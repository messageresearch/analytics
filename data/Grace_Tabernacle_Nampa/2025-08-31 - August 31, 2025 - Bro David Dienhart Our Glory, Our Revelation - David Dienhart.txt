Praise God. It's good to be here. Good to see each one here this morning. Amen. I'd like to start with number 447. He abides. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the pilgrim way for the hand of God in all my life I see. And the reason of my bliss, yes, the secret is this, that the comforter abides with me. He abides. He abides. Halleluah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the narrow way. For the comforter abides with me. Once my heart was full of sin. Once I had no peace within, till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree. Then I fell down at his feet and there came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter abides with me. He abides. He abides. Halleluah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the pilgrim way. And comfort abides with me. He is with me everywhere and he knows my every care. I'm as happy as a bird and just as free. For the spirit has control. Jesus satisfies my soul since a comforter abides with me. He abides. He abides. Halleluah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the narrow way. For the comforter abides with me. There's no thirsting for the things of the world. They've taken wings. Long ago I gave them up and instantly. All my night was turned to day. All my burdens rolled away. Now the comforter abides with me. He abides. He abides. Halleluah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the pilgrim way. Oh, the comforter abides with me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know that last verse? Go jump to that real quick. I get the words messed up here. Long ago, I gave them up and instantly, you know, when we turn it over to God, we quit trying to do it. You commit it to him. He's going to take it away. He's going to take care of that for you. And I was just the reason I don't know this song popped into my head because I was just for some reason thinking about I used to have a smoking and drinking problem and I remember my mom was like you know she she raised me right and uh I tried I remember one time in my car I was like I'm done smoking I threw him out the window you guess what I was doing the next day but when I gave it to God amen he took care of that for me it I have no desire whatsoever for those things Amen. Praise the Lord for that. Amen. Amen. Number 441. So now I know where I'm headed. [Laughter] [Music] On Jordan's stormy banks I stand and cast a wishful eye toward Canaan's fair and happy land where my possessions lie. I am bound for the promised land. [Music] bound for the promised land. Oh, who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land. For all those wide extended plains shine one eternal day. There God the sun forever rains and scatters night of way. I am bound for the promised land. I am bound for the promised land. Oh who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promise land. No chilling winds nor poisonous breath can reach that healthful shore. Sickness and sorrow. Pain and death are feared and felt no more. I am bound for the prois land. I'm bound for the prois land. Oh, who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land. When shall I reach that happy place and be forever bless? When shall I see my father's face and in his bosom I am bound for the promised land. bound for the promised land. Oh, who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land. One more time. I am bound for the promised land. Am bound for the promised land. Oh, who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Number 497, a stand. [Music] A wonderful [Music] Savior is Jesus my Lord. A wonderful Savior to me. He hideth my soul in the cl of the rock. Where rivers of pleasure I see, he hideth my soul in the cliff of the rock that shadows a dry thirsty land. He hideth my life in the depths of his love and covers me there with his hand and covers me there with his hand. A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord. He taketh my burden away. He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved. He giveth me strength as my day. He hideth my soul in the cliff of the rock that shadows a dry thirsty land. He hideth my life in the depths of his love and covers me there with his hand. And covers me there with his hand. With numberless blessings each moment he crowns and filled with his fullness divine. I sing in my rapture. Oh, glory to God for such a redeemer as mine. He hideth my soul in the cl of the rock that shadows a dry thirsty land. He hideth my life in the depths of his love. Then covers me there with his hand. And covers me there with his hand. When clothed in his brightness, transported I rise to meet him in clouds of the sky. His perfect salvation, his wonderful love. I'll shout with the millions on high. He hideth my soul in the cliff of the rock that shadows a dry thirsty land. He hideth my life in the depths of his love and covers me there or with his hand and covers me there with his hand. Amen. Amen. As we get ready to go to prayer this morning, that little old chorus number 144. [Music] What a lovely name, the name of Jesus. Reaching higher fall than the brightest star. Sweeter than the songs they sing in heaven. [Music] Let the saints proclaim. What a lovely name. What a lovely name. The name of Jesus. Reaching higher fall than the brightest star. Sweeter than the songs they sing in heaven. Let the saints proclaim. What a lovely name. [Music] Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Brother Trevor, this is Terry. Good to see you guys back. God bless you. I missed you. Amen. Um, got a couple prayer requests here. We want to remember our brother Paul who's uh down there preaching for the Saints in Salt Lake this morning. Amen. Actually, I think they're done already. I think they start at 9:00. My wife was teasing the kids. She said, "Man, you guys wouldn't be able to make it to church." Amen. But, uh, just pray for them. Pray for the good service and just bring them home safely tomorrow. Amen. Uh, brother Sergey's written here saying, "I request prayer from my aunt. She has heart issues recently. She has fainted in a grocery store." And so, amen, we just want to remember her. Whatever the whatever's going on there. Amen. We know a healer. Amen. Amen. Uh, Brother Ivan's asking, he has an unspoken prayer request uh for himself. Want to hold him up in prayer this morning. Amen. I know there's many others, many other requests out there. Amen. I'm going to ask you, Brother Trevor, do you want to come take these before the Lord this morning? If you have something on your heart this morning, you need something. Amen. He's more than able. [Music] Lord bless you guys, saints. [Music] Heavenly Father, thank you Lord Jesus for this morning, this lovely morning. Lord, not just because the sun is shining, Lord Jesus, because but because the sun s o n is shining in our hearts. I trust each one of us, Lord, has been drawn here by inspiration, Father. And so we come here hungry. We come here needy, asking for you to meet us, Lord Jesus. And we believe that you will, Lord Jesus, you've heard the requests that were spoken here, Father. And we just ask that for each one, that you be gracious to each one, Father. Brother Paul preaching, I pray that you just be with him this morning and the saints there in Salt Lake. Father, just have your way with them. Speak to their hearts, Lord. Speak to every need. We pray, Lord Jesus. Lord, and these who are not feeling well, Father, we just ask that you be with them or who are needing a touch &gt;&gt; in their hearts for their health, Lord. You know who they are, Father. You know the hearts of the children that have these petitions on their hearts, Father. And we just lift them up before you, Father, and ask for your grace, for your mercy, Lord, for your healing power, for every unspoken request. and I have my own, Father. And for every uplifted hand, Father, we just commit those to you, Lord Jesus. And give us hearts to receive the answer when you give it, Lord. And perhaps it's not what we expect, but Lord, we know that you will answer. We bless the remainder of this service, Father. Just ask that you'd be with our speaker, Lord, whoever he is this morning. I believe brother David just be with him Lord Jesus and speak to every heart here father the needs of the people bless the tithes and the offerings and the cheerful giver Lord we love you Lord and we thank you in the precious name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. We have a special this morning. our brother uh Pavo and Job. Welcome all visitors. God bless you. Goltha's path is long Blood flowed from the brow. How much torment suffering in the eyes. My beloved Jesus Christ gave his life on the cross. He accepted all the pain and grief. I could never forget that old rugged cross. It stands between heaven and the earth. By his death, Christ reconiled us to the creatator and redeemed us by his precious blood. Make me Lord to know the mystery of your love which you brought to us on the earth. Then can I walk calmly and firmly on the earth midst the storm among tears. I could never forget that old rugged cross. It stands between heaven and the earth. By his death, Christ reconiled us to the creatator and redeemed us by his precious blood. Oh, hear me, oh man, and the voice of my song. Why linger you, oh why do you wait? What will you repay him for the divine gift? What will you give for thee? Spilled blood. Earth's gift dawn light. Joy of the days ahead. The Lord created it for you. He calls. Oh come friend. Don't pass him by. In him you will find joy and peace.

I could search for all eternity long and find there is none like you. There is none like you, Lord Jesus. No one else can touch my heart like you do. I could search for all eternity alone and find there is none like you. Amen. Amen. As we get ready as we get ready to ask our brother David to come would like to sing that little chorus. Uh 953. How great are you Lord? How great is your mercy? Amen. How great are you, Lord? How great is your mercy? How great are the things that you have done for me. How great are you Lord in your loving kindness is filling my heart as I sing. How great are you Lord? How great is your love reaches to the heaven. How great is a heart that sought and rescued me. How great are you, Lord? How great is your mercy. [Music] How great are the things that you have done for me. How great are you, Lord. Your loving kindness [Music] is filling my heart as I sing. How great are you, Lord? [Music] How great is your love? It reaches to the heaven. How great is a heart that sought and rescued me. How great are you, Lord. How great is your mercy. How great are the things that you have done for me. How great are you, Lord, how great and kindness is filling my heart as I sing. How great are you, Lord? God bless you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to see everyone with us. More came out than I thought would, but we're grateful. God bless you, brother, sister, from up there around Sandp Point. And we're thankful for everything that God has given us. And we're here happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning. But the greater revelation is we are in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are his house. and that we have come here as an example of assembling together. And I believe the portion of the body is right here this morning assembled together. But we're in his house. His house is the bride. The Bible said, "You are his house." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're thankful for that and thankful for the mercy of God to reveal himself to us. I had quite a intensive battle bringing this getting this together and still don't know how it's going to come out. I'm depending and I have depended and always depend on the Lord. He's always on time. And uh God knows exactly what you need. If you've come here to focus on a man, you'll go away disappointed. But if you'll take your focus off of me and bring your focus on the word that's here in your midst, you won't go away disappointed. If you'll pull on him, God will speak back to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm nothing but just a servant to serve God, to serve the people. And I have nothing in myself as a man to do anything. And but I know God's on time. And I I know he's willing to speak to our hearts. So God bless you this morning. Musicians can thank you for the song service. appreciate it. Thank you for this special. It certainly was the blood that redeemed us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; But there's another part of redemption and that's coming to claim what he redeemed. You know, he he didn't do the claiming then. He paid the price for your redemption then as a mediator through the ages. But in the end here, the book had to be opened. Amen. And that was his book. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And that was our book. &gt;&gt; Amen. That had to be opened &gt;&gt; in this day. He had to claim what he purchased. &gt;&gt; And that's the great mystery of our day and our hour is those people that he claimed are coming alive and maturing &gt;&gt; in himself. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because it had to be he had to come forth a headstone which we see the picture made of him in 1963 in Sunset Mountain. Who was that? It was a sign in the heaven. The headstone coming to unite with his bride. The ministry of himself would be opened &gt;&gt; in bride form. And so this is a great a great thing &gt;&gt; to be assembled today in our day and to see a message like this of his coming &gt;&gt; and no brother sister don't know I can stand here before you I don't know who's making it and who don't but there's one thing I'm certain of and can know and you too personally you can know &gt;&gt; and God can reveal this to you and you know that you know &gt;&gt; and you become I'm burdened for the people because you don't know. And let me say this right off the get-go. Only the predestinated seed can know &gt;&gt; and have the revelation of this hour. &gt;&gt; Only the predestinated seed because they were in him before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; They were in him when he came to give his life for you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me say this. Everything you and I have need of being that seed. Everything is in that seed. &gt;&gt; Everything that that you will that will be manifest. Everything the bride is to manifest. Everything you are to manifest personally in that body is in that seed already. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You see, you don't realize the bride realizing it though she'd done made it. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; She's already risen with him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. That's why she's certain of the resurrection &gt;&gt; because that rapture is in her to be manifested. &gt;&gt; So, thanks be to God. Stand with me if you will this morning. And I hope you prayed for me because remember, I'm not up here to tell you what I think. I pray God will just speak his word, speak his will, and it will move your heart because this isn't a group affair. This is an individual affair, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes, we do assemble in a group here, but it's an individual affair. &gt;&gt; God is pulling out himself, making himself known. &gt;&gt; That's what the seals were about. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's to make himself known. He unveiled himself. And only the bride, only his wife can come to that unveiling, can see that unveiling. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when he unveils himself, he don't unveil himself to everybody. &gt;&gt; He unveils himself to his bride, his wife. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's what she's a partaker of in this hour day. I know that seems strange to some people, very radical. You think, "Well, brother David, you speak too deep." No, it's just speaking too too simple. &gt;&gt; Because the deepness of God is simplicity. It's so simple that you and your intellects cannot know it. &gt;&gt; It takes the divine revelation given by God for you to see it. That's what God has preserved. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he would make himself known to his people. &gt;&gt; And what is it? He's making himself known to himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Our heavenly father, how grateful we are to stand and to me standing, quivering, shaking, but knowing that anointing is coming upon me. Lord, I just receive it. I pray that you would take the words that are spoken this morning and bring them real, Lord, to such a reality, to such a realization to your little bride of her position, her positive position in this hour, to let her see where she's standing, Lord, because the seals were open. The mystery of who she was, the mystery of himself in bride form, the mystery was made known. Those seals held that mystery. That seventh seal was the mystery Lord revealed. And Lord, that little bride is that mystery. &gt;&gt; Her names were in that book. That mystery unlocked who she is. And Lord, your prophet said that on page two, paragraph 12 of Rising of the Sun. He said he's the one that opened that mystery. And what is it? It's the bride seeing where she come from, who she was in, how she would be manifest, and how she would be known in the end. Oh God, what a great revelation. What does it do for your little bride, Father? Oh, what it gives us is such an expectation. We don't know, but what's right here this morning? Loved ones could walk into this room. Who would see them? Your bride would see them. We don't know how they're going to meet. We don't know when they're going to meet, but Lord, we know we're going to meet them. May this revelation come to every individual, Father, to realize they are a part of you, always was, and that they are the logos revealed beneath the rema. They are the unveiled word in the word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray that you'd grant it as I ask this in thy name, the Lord Jesus Christ, giving this myself fully to you to say things that David knows nothing about, Lord, and realize it's the seed of God among us. It's Jesus Christ among us, friends, unveiling his word to his people. &gt;&gt; We give you praise for this reality in Jesus' name. Amen. Wow. &gt;&gt; All right. I'd like you to turn with you me in your Bibles to Psalm 62. Just start a scripture here. And I just go on in the word as we feel like the Lord would have us to read. And this has been a very unusual time for me the last couple two or three days. And yet out in prayer two or three days ago, this was revealed so simple. It's so clear when you go to bring it, it's like you're telling a story. It's strange, but it's there. And God knows how to speak it, knows how to reveal it, knows how to give it to you. How many will trust him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you're not here by chance this morning. you're here because God brought you here and he give you and will open his word to you if you're willing to receive him. But you've got to let go of yourself. &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure this out. You can't figure it out. I'm going to tell you right now, the message of the hour cannot be figured out. &gt;&gt; There's not enough study to give it to you. &gt;&gt; But there's a hunger in your heart and there's a pull towards God. There's an answer to that pull &gt;&gt; and we have the answer to it. &gt;&gt; How many believe we've had a we have a perfect interpretation of the word by a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; Then don't you try to add to that or take from it. &gt;&gt; This message is the perfect interpretation of the word. These seven thunders could not be made known. We need to know, the prophet said, but it'll take a vindicated prophet to bring it out. Then who's it going to be revealed to? Those that are in him, his seed. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying who is and who isn't. I don't know. I'm just thankful for the revelation to know that I am his seed. &gt;&gt; And his seed will conquer every gate of the enemy. &gt;&gt; They're already more than conquerors. You don't fight a battle. We're fighting a battle. I fought a tremendous battle to be here this morning. But you're not fighting a battle to get victory. You already have victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're just here to manifest victory &gt;&gt; because our victory is our faith &gt;&gt; and our faith in us. The believer is the faith of God &gt;&gt; in you moving. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 68, perfect faith. He said, "The believer is the faith of God moving in you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. So Psalm 62, we could read the whole chapter. Beautiful chapter. I've gone to this many, many times. But verse seven, in God is my salvation and my glory, the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God. &gt;&gt; Let me read it one more time. In God is my salvation. You believe that this morning? I ought to hear an amen from everybody this morning. In God is your salvation. What are you looking for for salvation? Who are you looking to? &gt;&gt; Amen. He's your salvation. &gt;&gt; He was manifested in some form. He was the one that died for you. He was the one that bled for you. Amen. Is that right? He's the one that paid the penalty of death. He paid the penalty of the law. He fulfilled the law. Amen. In his son. What was this son? Himself. The fullness of himself. &gt;&gt; Then where were you then? You're his seed. Where were you? He's the seed. &gt;&gt; Then you had to be in him. &gt;&gt; Then when he died, you died with him. When he rose, you rose with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's already done. &gt;&gt; You've already risen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "What do you mean by that? You've done pass from death to life. So in God is my salvation and my glory. &gt;&gt; My glory. Who's my glory? The Lord is my glory. Amen. Who's his glory? You are his glory. &gt;&gt; You say prove that. The Bible said the h the wife is the glory of her husband. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Jesus said, "I give them my glory." Amen. &gt;&gt; Chapter 17 of John said, "I give you I give them my glory. I give to you my glory. My glory is given to them." &gt;&gt; And he said he wouldn't share his glory with another. But the bride is not another. &gt;&gt; She's himself. She's the word. She's the seed. She's Christ manifested. &gt;&gt; And if Christ be in you, I make it through this message quicker than I thought. If Christ be in you, I'm going to have you be seated just a second. It won't hurt you to stand. If Christ be in you, then the revelation of God is manifested in you. &gt;&gt; Christ in you is God great revelation. Christ in you is who you are. &gt;&gt; That's the new birth. &gt;&gt; That's the birth word. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. So Christ in you would be the mystery of God revealed in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, you may be seated. I want you to turn with me to Revelation 10. Herein is our message. You know that there do you realize that there's a little book in the book? &gt;&gt; That's called the bride book. &gt;&gt; There's a little book in the book in there's a little book within the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that steady because because we we've been through it. I took a whole series on that. about two years ago. But there's a little book within that book and that little book is only it's the it's the wedding or marriage certificate. The prophet said it's the marriage certificate. It show it reveals who he marries. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It reveals the names of his bride &gt;&gt; by revealing the mystery of himself. The full mystery. It's the full mystery of God. It was sealed on the backside. So, let's read this before I go too far. Revelations chapter 10. No, let let me just read this first. Revelations 5 51. And I Yes. No, I'm just going to read. I'll come back to that. Revelations 10. I'm sorry. I'm just I've got to follow. It may seem like it's a little jerky in this, but I just want to follow what he does here. Revelation 10 verse one. I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud. Amen. How many would say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many would realize that that's what he said would happen in Acts 1 verse 9-11. He would return again the way the same way he left. &gt;&gt; Clothed in a cloud, hidden in a cloud. He would come again that same way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then what are we beholding? We are being prepared to meet him in the air. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How are we being prepared? Because the the head is uniting with the body. &gt;&gt; It's an invisible union. It's a marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're growing into that maturity of himself. &gt;&gt; This is the message of the hour. This is the opening of the seals. This is that latter rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. We grow, we drink, we drink, we drink. Where are we growing into? The full stature of himself. &gt;&gt; Because in order to finish the mystery, Jesus Christ had to be manifest in bride form. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there you are. So now we know that Revelation 10, I seen this mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head. We find that in Revelations 1, John speaking, giving the oversight of the whole revelation. Then begins in the church ages, he's seeing, he's writing what he sees. But notice he said, "I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and turned to look, turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having been turned, I see seven candlesticks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I see seven church ages. And then one in the midst of those seven church ages, clothed in a garment like a woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; He said she he was clothed not in a man's garment, clothed in a woman's garment because the son of man was being manifest mediating mediatorial through those seven ages. Amen. I'm going to come to that down here in just a minute. He had to mediate for what he purchased. He had to be an intercessor for what he purchased. He had to be on the throne of his purchase. But here's John seeing him. He was he had a white wig on. He He was a sun shining in its strength. Amen. Is that right? And when John, the type of the bride, saw him, he fell as a dead man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's a good place to begin right there. Let it let yourself die to yourself and die to the fact of what you are and see him. see him manifested. See him. Amen. All right. So, so he he we I just we bring that in. Then at right at the end, he begins to say what the seven stars were, what the seven candlesticks are, and then he begins right into the message of the church ages. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But at the end of the church at the seventh church age, he now has another turn &gt;&gt; and he calls the bridegroom has made himself known and caught the attention. Now it comes to that third pull of the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. First pull, second pull was to get the attention of the bride. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But the third pull would catch the bride. &gt;&gt; And that's the opening of that hidden sealed word. &gt;&gt; I'll go that any further than that because I'm going to tell you that word who that word was that was sealed. The Bible makes it very clear. And that word would be sealed up to the end. But at the message of the seventh angel of Revelation 10, his message was the seventh seal made known. Made known. Amen. That's exactly what it was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's it's one mystery. Mysteries revealing a mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because notice in Revelation 10:7, it said the mystery of God would be finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not mysteries, mystery. But it took those seven mysteries in every one of those ages. A mystery, a me a mystery coming forth. What? To do what? To bring to full maturity, a headship. God and his bride is one. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, there was a sealed book. We know we know the the whole book was sealed, but there's a there's a there's there's a Well, let me just I'm trying to get ahead of myself. Let me hold back here. All right. Verse two. No. and and and in clothed with a cloud and a rainbow in his head and his face that were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. Same thing John saw in Revelations 1. All right. Then because what was he speaking of? That which was which is and shall come. Amen. John was witness of that. &gt;&gt; The bride is witness of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. All right. So we see here in verse two, and he had in his hand a little book open. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse five was closed until he took the book. &gt;&gt; And when he took the book, what was written in that book now opened. &gt;&gt; And he cried. He said he had a little book in his hand. He said, "Behold, in his hand, he had a little book open. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roar, and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. Amen. And the revelation of the seventh seal went to those seven thunders. So, brother Ram said, see, it's connected together. &gt;&gt; And John was forbidden to write. We can go to the scripture. We know he was forbidden to write what those thunders said. And it couldn't be known until the message of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. What they said, but what they said, Satan can't get. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If they said it, if he written before that, he would try to pervert it. &gt;&gt; Try to put his own interpretation to it. But this is one thing he can't get. &gt;&gt; Because he can't know it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Only the elect seed can know this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, just hold that in mind. Only the predestinated seed is going to know the secret of Revelation 8:1. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a mystery, but when it's revealed, it's now a secret that the public doesn't know. And the public, you say, "Well, who's the public?" The public is everyone that's not bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm not saying who's bride and who isn't. I'm telling you that's the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope every one of us are in here. &gt;&gt; I'm believing that with all my heart. I'm not putting anybody in. I can't put anybody out. I couldn't even put my own self in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or out. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But because he revealed and is revealed to individuals that they always were in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no way to get out of him. &gt;&gt; There's nothing can take you out of him. &gt;&gt; When he rose, you rose with him. &gt;&gt; You have nothing to grumble, nothing to murmur about, nothing. Because God in all thing, I don't care how how hot the battle is, how great the battle is, God has control absolutely of every bit of that and has a purpose in you going through it. &gt;&gt; He's got an eternal purpose. You're not by here by chance. God has made has a purpose for you, an eternal purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's going to he's going to fulfill that purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't be anything but what that seat is. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's exactly &gt;&gt; there's been two seeds all along, &gt;&gt; but Abel by revelation knew to do something different than the other seed. &gt;&gt; Abel was the seed of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which was the seed of his father Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cain Adam was not Cain, excuse me, was Adam was not Cain's father. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, that shouldn't be a question here about anybody. Right. &gt;&gt; Because because if because he's not even found in the lineage of Adam at all. &gt;&gt; That's correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; If he was the firstborn of Adam, he'd be in the lineage, but it wasn't the lineage. Abel, Seth replaced Abel. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Cain killed Abel. &gt;&gt; Because of the revelation he had. He had a true revelation of what God wanted. And God vindicated it to Cain. and he saw it vindicated, but he couldn't receive it nor accept it &gt;&gt; because he was a different seed. &gt;&gt; Eve was the mother of all living, but Adam was not the father of all living. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. That's scripture. You say, "I've never heard that before." Well, I'll tell you. It wasn't eating an apricot, and it wasn't eating an apple that made Eve see she was naked or Adam. Right. &gt;&gt; It was an it was an an adultery affair. &gt;&gt; You know that. We know the scripture and that clearly places it out here. And there's not a denomination in the country that'll accept it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it exposes that denominational system. &gt;&gt; Because because Cain built his own little system and brought the fruits of the field thinking that's what God would respect, the works of his own hand. And God said, "I want nothing to do with your works. It's my works that I'm going to express." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to reveal it to Abel so he'll do my works. &gt;&gt; You know that Bible said that you're God's workmanship created in in union with him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are his workmanship created in union with Jesus Christ. You are his workmanship created in Jesus Christ unto good works &gt;&gt; which I have to pump up and work up and do every day. Absolutely not. What you need to do, you've already been ordained to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which he hath before ordained that you would walk in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. There you are. &gt;&gt; Now, where are we standing? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, so it has nothing to do with your affairs of and it's not that you don't have your desire is to please him, but you're going to make mistakes right up to the time you have a body change. You're going to fail and make mistakes. &gt;&gt; God is not judging you by your mistakes. He's judging you by the revelation of himself in you. &gt;&gt; That's the blood. He already covered it. The blood's there. Covers every sin. He's looking through the blood and see you perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Satan's there pounding at your door saying, "Oh, you can't make it. You can't have this." &gt;&gt; Who says you can't have it when the Bible said it's yours? &gt;&gt; Now, it's whether you can believe it or not. &gt;&gt; The seed cannot deny the scriptural promises given to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. They can't They can't deny that. &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; That's got it. All right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's certainly got it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because with that, you can't f Listen, the seed of God cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seed of God is an eternal thought made manifest, spoken by a word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The seed is the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the word can never fail. &gt;&gt; The letter will pass away, &gt;&gt; but not the word. right here. &gt;&gt; This Bible right here, the letter, &gt;&gt; the letter will pass away. &gt;&gt; But this word that can contained in this letter can never pass away because it's God's thoughts expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God's thought. We already been through it here. Two or three meetings ago, I preached on the logos. You remember that? The voice of my beloved calling us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're looking at So, let's go. Let's go here over here now to Ezekiel chapter 2. Ezekiel chapter 2 verse 9 and 10. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. And when I looked, behold, a hand was sent unto me. Ezekiel the prophet. And when I looked, behold, a hand was sent unto me. And lo, a roll of a book was therein. Now remember, this book was not, brother Bram said, this book is not like this book. Talking of in Revelation there, it's a roll. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. sealed but seven seals on the backside. Meaning at the end. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Meaning our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we know we've come to the end. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; We have it identified. We can we can spend a whole sermon on how that end is identified. But we know we've arrived. &gt;&gt; Time is running out. &gt;&gt; Time is being swallowed up under eternity. &gt;&gt; Time and eternity are blending. Who's going to win? &gt;&gt; Eternity. &gt;&gt; Eternity. &gt;&gt; Swallows up time. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what is our walking? We're walking right in eternal life to a body eternal change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, in verse 10, and he spread it before me. I like that. He spread it before me. And it was written within and without. It was written within. Something in the book was written. It was in the book. Now, we find over in Jeremiah that there was he purchased the land, paid the price, redeemed a land. Is that right? The brother said, "You buy the land and when we're coming back, because we'll be back in 70 years according to prophecy, and you can you have a right and you can show the evidence that you own the land." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That you own the land. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, I want the bride to know you own something. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he owns something &gt;&gt; and he's purchased it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's calling now. Calling. The message the hour is calling for his bride to come sit where she belongs in position by his side in his throne. &gt;&gt; Got it? &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. So, so this is what we're doing. Listen, you may have laughed at that. Let me just tell you something. I don't not talking about any person. We're not laughing. But look it, when you say, "I got it." &gt;&gt; I don't believe that just comes out of a happen chance. &gt;&gt; You say you got something, it's going to live through you. &gt;&gt; It's going to be manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just something you guessed at. Something when you say you got it, something's quickened inside of you. &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; And there's still more to get. Amen. As he reveals his word, there's still more to get. Brother, sister, there's still more of him I need. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But the word is be continuing being opened. Opened. Opened. One step at a time. We're walking with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so and the spread before me. It was written within and without. And there was written therein lamentations, mourning, and woe. All right. Now, we're in a tremendous day. &gt;&gt; We're in the second coming of Christ. I'm not pulling any punches. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this is not fully fulfilled fully yet, but it's where when is it? You say, "Brother David, what is the fulfillment of that?" The meeting of him in the air, but he's come right now. He's here and he's unveiling himself to his bride &gt;&gt; and he has to make manifest himself in bride form to fulfill the prophecy of Genesis 2. &gt;&gt; Again, &gt;&gt; I say the prophecy because why did Adam take his wife to redeem her? Keep her from death. Is that right? &gt;&gt; What did Christ do at the cross? He took you. You were in him and he took you in himself &gt;&gt; and paid the penalty &gt;&gt; of your heir &gt;&gt; and paid the penalty of death. &gt;&gt; He paid the penalty of the law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which which to transgress the law was death. You had no way it out. It put you in jail, but he got us out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, there was grace before the law, during the law, and after the law. It was grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. Now, I don't have I won't go any further with that, but it was a book written. I want to emphasize it was written within &gt;&gt; and without. Jeremiah, as I said, purchased land. He put the evidence. He sealed there was an evidence that he left open. And Revelation 6:1, we can read the evidence open. John said, "I I saw these seals opened." Amen. I seen a white horse. But but but there's something written within that those seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. That it took the seventh angel to reveal. &gt;&gt; It wasn't William Brandham revealing anything the man. It was the son of man. &gt;&gt; It was the king &gt;&gt; put the sword in his hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sent it down and and sent the word down to his seventh angel to open it. That's why I That's why I don't like anybody that'll water down this message. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's not to be watered down. &gt;&gt; It's to be lived. And you can't live it in yourself. It takes the one who brought the message to unveil himself in you who is the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so we see here then that in and let's go over here now to Revelations 5. Revelations chapter 5. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. &gt;&gt; So there's something written within. Now remember those that evidence that Jeremiah put within was the revelation in the time that it was to be made known. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was sealed where? in an earthn vessel. &gt;&gt; We were sealed in an earthn vessel. &gt;&gt; The word the word that was to come in our day went to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Sealed. We were that mystery of himself. Just like Eve was sealed in Adam. &gt;&gt; Before Eve could be manifest, she was sealed in Adam. &gt;&gt; Are you Are you with me? &gt;&gt; She was a mystery of Adam. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ. Now, the there's a three-fold purpose of God, a three-fold mystery that he unveils this seventh seal. First of all, the first fold that all that God was, he poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So, God in Christ was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. You were a mystery in him then. &gt;&gt; He was the full book. &gt;&gt; He was all the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was, it was in him. And he went to Calvary and he died and he rose again. And now he mediates because he has to build a bride. He has to have a bride. And that bride he poured out his life for her. And by the elements that were poured out of him, he would create and make his own bride. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And the the church ages were as a wheat plant. The life starts out as a seed. That's where you began. I'm talking to the bride now. You were that seed. In that seed was a mystery. &gt;&gt; And that that seed began to grow and it grew first age, second age, all the way down until it come and went into the ground again because it had to die. Unless it died, it couldn't be made known or manifest. &gt;&gt; Except a seed died. John 12. Except it died, it can't rise again. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But to show the resurrection, it started coming out in Luther as a little blade. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; What did the life the life of the seed the life of Christ was manifest in a blade? Then it then those that followed denominated that word and it passed that life passed from that over into Wesley. &gt;&gt; Sanctification. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; What is that? Tossel. Then it went from that tossle and they denominated and then life kept moving on. You can't shut the life out. The life has got to come back to what originally was. &gt;&gt; I hope you don't miss that. The life has got to come back to what it originally was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then the life went out from that went into Wesley out of Wesley into Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Now remember those three are under a man age. Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, still under a man age, under reformation. &gt;&gt; And they were carriers of one life. &gt;&gt; It came out of one, went into the other, went the other until it come to a shuck. And the shuck was so close to looking like the real seed, but you opened it up. We've heard brother Bram preach this many time, but you open it up and there's no seed there. But there is a little bud way back in there, but you think that was the seed because it was in the formation of a seed, &gt;&gt; but it was a shuck, &gt;&gt; right? But the seed is still coming up &gt;&gt; because the seed had to come back to an original seed. And the original seed is spoken word. &gt;&gt; Spoken word is the original seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this little bride being the thought of himself is a spoken word seed bride. &gt;&gt; It's not some fly by night. She's a spoken word seed &gt;&gt; of himself &gt;&gt; to be presented here as it was in God taking Eve out of Adam. &gt;&gt; He didn't take another spirit. He took the feminine spirit which was Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Put it himself Adam into another form. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Iorphied. It was Adam. He morphed in another form taking on another mask. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. And so I'll I'll hold it right there and then we'll come back to 51. And so you seen a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven sealed. Then we see in verse eight we saw who had conquered who had the right to take the book who had the right to re to take that and it was the lion coming forth. Amen. It was a lion because he was the king. And he came forth as a simple lamb because it was the lamb in the form of the lamb. He paid for our penalty of sin. And he's the one that conquered. Who did? God did. &gt;&gt; It's not another brother, sister. It's not two, three gods here. It's one God coming down in three offices. God in Christ. Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's your three second fold. God in Christ. Christ. Now where in you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Where's Christ now? Where's the revelation of God now? Where is it being manifest now? In the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then who's among us, friends? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon made a statement on a message. Who do you say this is? He said, it's Jesus Christ among us, friends. &gt;&gt; Who do you say it is? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram wasn't pointing to the man saying, "Who do you say it is?" He was pointing to the revelation of the son of man coming through him and saying, "Who do you say this is that knows the secrets of the heart, can tell your thoughts, can tell your address, can tell you who you are, and now comes along and takes the book in his hand. He was the one that conquered for it. And now he opens it up." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And reveals a sealed secret. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go on with our message. Daniel 12. Daniel 12. We see over here in in Daniel. Thought I had that marked. Okay. Daniel 12:9. And I heard, but I understood or excuse me, I'll just read verse eight. and I heard but I understood not. Then said I, oh my Lord, what shall then said I, oh my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. The words are closed up. In the beginning was the word &gt;&gt; and the word was with God. &gt;&gt; How was it with God? It was in the thinking of the eternal. &gt;&gt; Those thoughts of God are eternal thoughts and they were in the in the in the secret. It was his secret. It was in him &gt;&gt; to be expressed in word and he expressed it in word and the word was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So the so you see now there's this it comes down here and he said and go thy way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end. &gt;&gt; Okay. Paragraph 524 of Christ the mystery. But he had to redeem her which is his body. She has to be redeemed in order to come to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Unless you're redeemed, how you going to come to him? &gt;&gt; So, the great thing, the song sung by the blood of the cross, &gt;&gt; we're redeemed. &gt;&gt; We'll just take a side note right here and go over here to Peter and see what Peter said in First Peter 1 19. But with the precious blood of Christ, as a lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was fore orained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last day and last times for you by who by him do believe who by him you who by him believe in God that raised him from the dead and gave him glory and faith and hope and your hope you and excuse me and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God. Seeing that we purified our souls in obeying the truth through the spirit with unfeign love of the brethren, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently, being born again, not of corruptible seed, but that but of incorruptible seed by the word of God. Amen. That liveth and abideth forever. Verse 18, I I left that out. For so much as you know, this is I for Excuse me. Verse 18. For so much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things. Amen. As silver and gold from your vain conversation, received by tradition from your brethren, but with the precious blood of Christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's redeemed it. And so he has redeemed her. He had redeemed her which is his body. She has to be redeemed in order to come to him. Do you see it? Oh my. See, it couldn't have happened then. What couldn't have happened then? What we're talking about this morning, the words were still sealed. Though he paid them. Paid for them. Are you Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It was his property. Those words in that book were his property. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Where were the book? In the hand of the original owner. Cuz because it was forfeited. It came back to the original owner. Is that right? What was that book? An abstract deed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abstract mean it was searched all the way back. All the way back. And it was original. And it was the original seed word. You recognize then I trust that you'll see what what you've what God has purchased for you. Brother, sister, let me just say this. Everything he purchased for you is absolutely yours. &gt;&gt; He purchased everything that Adam lost and gave it back to us. &gt;&gt; He purchased it. He paid for it. And now he comes to claim and make known what he purchased and his rights of purchase. &gt;&gt; And that you are his eternal property. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whatever property he owns, you own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, so he said now, so you see now that he he couldn't have happened then the redemption. He couldn't. In other words, he couldn't have opened the book then because the redemption is going on. Going on through what? Seven ages. Amen. So, the redemption's going on. Now, you see the seals. See, the redemption is not fully completed until he comes to claim his possession. He's got to claim his rights. &gt;&gt; He's got to claim the book. He's got to open it. He's got to bring her to himself. You remember Eve could not come to Adam by herself. God brought her to Adam, &gt;&gt; right? Go back in Genesis. See if that's not what he God brought her to Adam. And he's carried us on eagle's wings to himself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He brought us to recognize who we were and where we come from. &gt;&gt; That's what the seals opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's now we're beginning to understand and see what the thunder said. &gt;&gt; But see, it's not open. You say, "Why? Everybody could." No. No. It's not open to the public. It's open to the bride. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is the word of God made manifest in flesh. And that can be only Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today in bride form and forever. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? What he was, he is &gt;&gt; only in another form. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; see, it's time to get out of this fear and scare. &gt;&gt; You don't know who you are. &gt;&gt; You don't know what's present here. Many don't know it. &gt;&gt; There's something happening. The world knows nothing about it. Church entities knows nothing about it. And a majority of the message people don't know about it. &gt;&gt; You say, "How can you say that?" because it's a little group that comes out of it at the last. &gt;&gt; So, what are we going to do? He's given you a book to feed on. He's given you the word to feed on. Why aren't we? Because Satan's keeping you too busy with other things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what? He hates the revelation of this because he knows that by the word &gt;&gt; in that word in that seed is your body changed. &gt;&gt; And if you go to believing that, what's going to happen? That's right. &gt;&gt; If that's quickened to you, there's a people out here that won't listen to his garbly goop and trash. See, you're you're too busy to go out. You're too busy to feed on the word. You're too busy to feed on an open book. You're too busy. &gt;&gt; That's his business today. &gt;&gt; We need to stop and and realize and take note and give preeminence to the one that means something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All these other things are passing away. Everything you see is temporal. But we look not at the things which are seen, &gt;&gt; but the things which are not seen, for the things which are not seen are eternal. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so we go on. Now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming. But someday, and someday isn't yet, someday is this day. This scripture is fulfilled. The someday is on us. &gt;&gt; The someday is when he took the book, put it in the hands of the seventh angel to reveal it. That was the someday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the someday is when it's revealed in you. &gt;&gt; You come to your someday. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? And someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you what, he's still getting the book. &gt;&gt; If there's still someone else that's got to be redeemed and has been redeemed, excuse me, has to recognize who they are, then he has to make that known to them. &gt;&gt; But when that last one is made known, there still may be a little period of time, but the door is shut. When the last one that was ready went into the marriage, the door was shut. I don't know when that day is. &gt;&gt; We don't know when that moment is that we're going to meet our loved ones. I don't know that moment, but I know I'm in the day of the moment. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the hour of the time of the moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we shouldn't we should be giving our whole self. You have a choice to make. It's either give yourself to self or give yourself to the word &gt;&gt; and let it live through you. Amen. One has to have preeminence over the other one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know it it makes you seem radical, makes you odd, makes you different, but we're meant to be different. We're not somebody that's not different. If our if our husband was different, we're going to be different. &gt;&gt; If that seed was different, the seed today, which is himself in the bride form, is different. There's no beauty we would desire her outwardly. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that inward beauty of the revealed word manifested in the simplicity of him of the word himself. A word bride. &gt;&gt; He's the word groom. What would the bride be? The word bride. &gt;&gt; Not another word. Himself. &gt;&gt; I'm not getting to a lot of things I had in here, but I don't care. It doesn't matter as the Lord leads. But look what he said. His church is himself revealed. [Music] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 250. Christ the mystery of God revealed. And the only way you're saved is to know him by revelation. &gt;&gt; You can't pump it up. You can't work it up. But you can give yourself and yield yourself and let him work through you and open his word to you. &gt;&gt; Who's standing in the way? You're standing in the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he's going to do everything he can to get you out of the way. I don't care if it means breaking everything you have. He's going to waken you up on the day that you're in the way. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? How many say amen to that? Know that that's what's happened and it's happening. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll turn things upside down to get you to realize that he alone &gt;&gt; is your salvation. He alone is your revelation rock. He is my rock. He is my revelation. Yes, &gt;&gt; he is my glory. &gt;&gt; There is no other glory. I I I am his glory. He is my glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The church is himself revealed. Do you see it? What is the church? It's the expressed word made manifest. &gt;&gt; Glory. That's her position. That's who she is. Amen. &gt;&gt; She's a wife of the word. Her husband is the word. &gt;&gt; Her husband is the creator of heaven and earth. Her husband is the deity. Her husband is is eternal. Her husband is the word living. &gt;&gt; That makes her everything her husband is. She is. &gt;&gt; She's under headship. She's sovereign. &gt;&gt; She's a sovereign like him under headship. &gt;&gt; Amen. My &gt;&gt; we have his mind. What am I saying when I say that? I don't have my I'm not led by my own carnal mind. I'm led by his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This little bride has the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; So what so what's he say here? He said now you see mediatorial but someday he comes forth to get this book. He's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him. For that's the believer the words in the book. Now tell me what was sealed up. The words in the book. &gt;&gt; Then who's the words in the book? The believer. You, me, the believer is the words in the book. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So it's see it's you can it's written within. &gt;&gt; You're the word written within and without. Everybody has the word. Everybody has the letter. But he has not made us the ministers of the letter. He's made us ministers of the logos, the spirit, the voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that logos means a thought or concept put into word. So he expressed his eternal thoughts of you and I and man the thoughts of himself and put it into word and hid it in the word in the back part of his mind and would not let it out and make it known they were sealed up until this day when he would open those seals and would loose himself and the little book she in that book would come to the realization this is my positive position and place. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why there's a book within the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's sealed. It's written within and without. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not ministers of the letter. The letter's here. I'm not doing away with the letter. I believe the letter, but there's a secret behind this letter. &gt;&gt; And this letter wasn't sent to everybody else. This letter was sent to the bride and the bride will read between the lines and know what he said in the letter. &gt;&gt; She's going to know what he said in the letter. &gt;&gt; And your life being an outward portrayal is going to manifest something that's inside having the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; It's just like a marriage on the outside. There's a revelation of a marriage that's spiritual. &gt;&gt; That's reflecting the bride and Christ. &gt;&gt; And as the bride is subject to her husband, &gt;&gt; so will the bride be subject to the word. And they're one. They're not divided. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You see, we thought marriage and divorce was something. It was something all outward. Oh, it's all outward. That's great thing. It's something inward that's a reality. And the outward is revealing a mystery inside. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; I trust you can see that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. All right. And the words in the book and the word, you are the believer. The words and the word is him. And all that's in that and all that's in that he come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written in the book before the foundation of the world. He was slain as a lamb. And today his word manifesting the same thing he did there. She can't recognize another headship. No sir. There's no bishop, no nothing. She recognizes one headship. That's Christ. And Christ is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Now &gt;&gt; he said over here he said God fully manifest in Jesus Christ. First fold fully manifest in Jesus Christ. God fully manifest. &gt;&gt; Then the bride was there in him. &gt;&gt; How many say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God's fully he was fully manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what was he? It was God's great secret of his revelation in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said Christ in you is God's great revelation. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So you are God's great revelation in Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Boy, that that seals it forever for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You talk about a seal &gt;&gt; to the day of your body change. That seals it. &gt;&gt; When you recognize your place in Christ. Amen. All right. God's great secret, great light of revelation, it's always blinded the wisdom of this world. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's always blinded them. The light will do one of two things. It'll either open your eyes or blind you. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; It was sent. It was sent. The the Pharisees, Sadducees, when he was manifested, he's be elub. The little woman at the well said, "He's Messiah." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What made the difference? &gt;&gt; She was a predestinated seed waiting for the light of that word to fall and and the and the water of the word to come upon her and it struck that seed and brought out what that seed was. And what it was was Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. It wasn't some other person. It was her glory. &gt;&gt; It was her rock. &gt;&gt; Rock means revelation in the Bible. Go back and shalom and see if the prophet didn't say that. God is my revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the scripture 62 of of Psalms, he said, "God is my rock." God is my revelation. God is my rock. Twice he said that in there. My refuge, my strength, my my my peace. Everything about everything he is. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we have and are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; You can't trust this outer man. As has been said right here by pastor. You can't put any trust in the outer man. &gt;&gt; God don't put any trust in it. Why would you put trust in it? &gt;&gt; God trusts his own word. &gt;&gt; And if you be in him, you're going to trust the word. You're going to you're going to fulfill the scripture no matter what it feels like, no matter what your reasoning says, no matter how unusual it means. &gt;&gt; How much of a death it causes you to die to your own ideas and your own self and come under the headship of the word. &gt;&gt; Whether it's in marriage, whether it's in our walk, whether it's in our house, whether it's in our home, whether it's out in the public, &gt;&gt; we have one thing we're manifesting. &gt;&gt; That's Jesus Christ. That's present tense here. taking a bride out of here, but turning a bride in himself, taking her to a home, taking her to a rapture. The because and in order for that to happen, the rapture's got to be in you already. &gt;&gt; How is it in you? &gt;&gt; Revealed in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. Now, so she can't recognize another headship. Her headship is Christ, and Christ is the word. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Church age book, page 332. If any man eats of that bread, now Paul, Brother Bram's talking about partial realization and perfect realization. &gt;&gt; You find what he said in there. He said like they fed mana in the wilderness, but then the next day they were hungry. &gt;&gt; So they had partial, it meant something, but partial realization. But when he, the true bread, came, now watch what he said. He said, "And here he is today in his word." Here he is today in his word. &gt;&gt; See, as I said, the whole church systems have the letter. &gt;&gt; But unless they're the mystery in that Bible, unless they're the word opened, &gt;&gt; as I said, the letter wasn't sent to them. The letter was sent to us. &gt;&gt; The whole Bible is sent to the bride. &gt;&gt; The letter sent to us. We have the ability by God to read the letter. We know because we have his mind &gt;&gt; what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, sister. &gt;&gt; Goodness sakes. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, if any man eats of that bread that came from heaven, he will never hunger again. Talk about realization. &gt;&gt; He said, he said he does not need to come back and eat again. Now, just stop and think about that. He said once other words brother Brham's not saying don't feed on the word &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; how many gets hungry and wants more of the word certainly &gt;&gt; but that is a satisfying that word now watch what else he goes on to say with it he said he said the moment he parttook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no need any longer for a shadow no need for a partial salvation he is the whole of it &gt;&gt; yeah Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, he's the whole of it. &gt;&gt; Just like Jesus isn't a part of God, he is God. &gt;&gt; Not just a part of God, he is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Veil behind skin. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. He came through a woman. &gt;&gt; How'd you come? You didn't come virgin born through woman, but you came through a woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there is a virgin birth. &gt;&gt; And this little bride is virgin born. &gt;&gt; The word birth, she's a wordborn bride. Virginborn bride. She's not touched by manhandling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. She is a She is She She go back to seat is not of her shuck. She is Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; A virgin word bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Virgin born. She's virgin born. Birth, spiritual birth, not natural. &gt;&gt; And the promise, Brother Brandham said in the message um this this day the scripture fulfilled. He said, "What's come on the scene and what was promised to come on the scene is a royal bride." &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? He said she's to come on the scene. The promise is that she'd be here on the scene. Then who is she? She's himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. The See, we didn't we didn't visualize the second coming that way because the bride coming forth is the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. What for? Back to Eden. Because when she steps back into Eden, it's it's the family again. &gt;&gt; Perfectly brought back. Right back to Eden. What's the next step? The on the three-fold. Christ in you, ready for the garden again. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Right here. Back to Eden. You see where we're at? All right. So, now we're ready to step over. We're coming ready. Every member of the bride has to be ready. She'll be absolutely under perfection of his word. &gt;&gt; Not perfection physically. Perfect word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Perfect. Because he's already said she's perfect and complete. &gt;&gt; And she said there's no sin against her. &gt;&gt; The blood has cleansed her and she stands there perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. See? So it so you can't you can't make something imperfect when he said it's perfect. And if you're in Jesus Christ, you're perfect. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your outer man isn't perfect, but your outer man isn't &gt;&gt; isn't who I am. &gt;&gt; It's this inside of the inside. The third pull is who I am. &gt;&gt; First pull was was flesh in the hand. Second pull was spirit. Third pull was the opening of the word in the soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, nobody can touch that unless that seed laying there to be opened. &gt;&gt; And that was a mystery until it was opened. And it was sealed in this book. &gt;&gt; And this and this book, there's a book that little book. You notice the Bible said in Revelation 10, it said they called it little. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, it's not it's not something else. It's still the book. But brother Brandham made it very clear that the book of life, the book of life, the lamb book of life, the book of of of life or the or the or the there's another name, two or three other names named for it is the same book &gt;&gt; titled each one of them. &gt;&gt; See, they're they're the same book. &gt;&gt; But but he said in a section of that book, &gt;&gt; there's another record. And he said those names in that record could never be removed &gt;&gt; for they are the names of his bride. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Now I've got I know I've got to hurry. My time flies. All right. So the whole of it Jesus isn't a part of God. He is God. Now it's the same thing in the bride. She is him. Now, I'm going to bypass a lot because I' I've got to, but let me just bring out these things right here. God's great secret has always blinded the wisdom of the world. They can't get it. They just don't understand it. Satan don't understand it. None of the rest of them understand it. And those who are but just those who are predestinated to understand it. How God and Christ are one. They make him three every time. They certainly will. Notice next. Secondly, the manifested Christ in you. Christ. God in Christ. Christ in you, the hope of glory, the great manifested God in Christ, now Christ manifested in you. Look, this is what I want to get to. What was once God's great secret, mis great mysterious secret in his mind, how many know he had it in his mind. He didn't let it out. He kept he said he kept it was in there in the word. It was constantly being manifest, but he didn't let it out. Other words, he didn't reveal it yet. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's in the word. You can't take you can't take this secret out of the word. Even though John was forbidden to write it. It's not something Brother Aram said it's not something outside the word. He said it's and it's not something written in the word. It's something it wasn't written in the word. But he said you can't take it out of the word because it's hid in the word. &gt;&gt; So it's hid there. &gt;&gt; So you are the hidden secret. &gt;&gt; Boy, if that don't set it on fire, &gt;&gt; I don't know what will. You're the hidden secret of You are the hidden secret of himself. &gt;&gt; So you are the whole &gt;&gt; fully revealed manifestation of himself here at the end. The complete revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said a mouthful there. &gt;&gt; The complete revelation. The whole of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? &gt;&gt; So be it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now &gt;&gt; Christ in you makes the complete revel makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing. &gt;&gt; He you tell me. Just tell me what the prophet said. He interpreted it. Isn't that what he said? Christ the mystery of God revealed. Christ in you is the center of the revelation. Christ is the center of the revelation. He's the little wheel. Christ in you makes him the center. And and and I mean Christ in the Bible makes the Bible a complete revelation of Christ. And he said Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of his of the whole thing. &gt;&gt; You tell me what denomination's preaching that. &gt;&gt; No denomination. Right? &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about denominational spirits amongst this message people. &gt;&gt; They aren't preaching this. &gt;&gt; They can't preach this. They can preach a Pentecost, but that's not our message. &gt;&gt; We believe in Pentecost. We must come through Pentecost, but Pentecost made way for himself &gt;&gt; to come down in manifestation. And so, we turned the corner and raised higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now we're following what heaven opened. We're following him right out of heaven. Riding on the same power &gt;&gt; because heaven opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we follow the word that proceeded out of his mouth. That's our absolute. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so I'm going to hurry here with this. I hate to bypass some of this. But Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing. You want to know what word complete means? Complete means finished. Complete means ended. And complete means concluded. &gt;&gt; So you are the complete. You are the finish. You are the conclusion. And you're the ending of the whole thing. And so see what God's trying to do. &gt;&gt; He makes you the complete revelation the whole thing. And brother Bram said, "See what God is trying to do." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If this isn't preached, that's not feeding the bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's got to be preached. If you're going to preach the word for the season, what I'm telling you is the promised word for this season manifested. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. This me this day, these scriptures are fulfilled. The hidden word is now opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The book has been opened. The marriage certificate is open. I know that I'm his wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you know, but I'm telling you what I know, and I'm a witness of that. Do I need more of him? Yes, because I haven't come to a body change. Maybe it's just waiting for other. I don't know. But one thing I do know, I can't get enough of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got to have him every day. He's brighter, clearer, just as clear, more clear all the time. Clearer and clearer and clearer. And it just seemed like it's just a perfect message with a perfect word. It's a perfect and when that which is perfect is come here. &gt;&gt; That which is in part is done away. &gt;&gt; We are part of we are the whole of &gt;&gt; glory. That was good. Boy, I got a lot out of that one right then. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Right there. Right there it is. &gt;&gt; I think we can close the book and say amen and go home. &gt;&gt; Amen. But look, what was once God's great secret, mysterious secret in his mind is now, now, now, now put in the hearts of the believer. That is the body of Christ. What once God's great secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest. Think of it. &gt;&gt; But God's great mystery, what the eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then given and then given. Not have to do a work for it. And then given. How many's willing to receive it? Let go of yourself. Give up yourself and live for him. &gt;&gt; No matter how much of a height it takes off you, how much contrary it is to your thinking? Just lay yourself down. Say, "God, I'm here not for any other purpose but submitting myself to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not here willing to live for self. We got a choice. Every day you die daily. You take up your cross and follow him. &gt;&gt; Do what the word said do and quit trying to interpret it some other way than what the word said for you to do. That's all there is to it. &gt;&gt; And don't you put your thinking to this message and say, "Well, Brother Brown didn't mean that &gt;&gt; or he meant something else. He meant just this message is a perfect interpretation of the word. And when that which is perfect has come, &gt;&gt; it's going to set you in the condition and the in the right position and the place for a body change. &gt;&gt; And we're looking for the third coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Brother, how you going to figure that one?" Why? The second coming is what we're seeing. He come again to do what? Receive you unto himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't he say he would come again? Did not he say he would come again and receive you that where I am, you may be also? How's that going to happen unless the word's unveiled to you? &gt;&gt; And the secret of the books opened up. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm not saying you won't meet him in the air. Yes, we'll meet him in the air. But without this revelation, this invisible union spiritually unveiled in you, you will never be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the truth. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's exactly right. &gt;&gt; So, see that word, that secret, that word in there is something beyond what you see written. &gt;&gt; There's a revelation contained in there that only the bride can read. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, they everybody saw the seals. John saw them, but there was a revelation contained in what he saw outward written. There was inveiled in there. was hidden from &gt;&gt; everybody and open to the bride. &gt;&gt; You see, we need to know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now let me just I got to find a place to quit here. I got to close. All right. Okay. We know what the new birth is. It's Christ revealed in you. Amen. That's Jesus Christ, the new birth revealed in you. And if you have and if and if he hasn't been revealed in you, there's no birth yet. &gt;&gt; And listen, revelation is not something you hope you have. It's something you know you have. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right. It's a knowing, not a hoping. &gt;&gt; It's the It's the evidence of things hoped for. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. It's the substance of things hoped for. &gt;&gt; What was God's thinking? Was it substance or wasn't it? &gt;&gt; Sure, it was substance. He thought it wasn't just happen chance. He created by what he knew. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you were substance. You were real. You were existing in his thinking. &gt;&gt; It was substance. &gt;&gt; All right? And evidence. Faith is the evidence of things hoped for. So, it's got to be faith first. It's got to be revealed first. That's why Brother Brandham said there's an invisible union taking place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a marriage. We're going to a full marriage at the wedding supper. We understand what he said there. We're going to that full celebration of a union. &gt;&gt; Then we step right back out and that third coming is stepping with his bride right back out of the millennium. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So see where we're at. &gt;&gt; We're further than you think. &gt;&gt; We just go on living and we should be living just every day. But brother, sister, if you're God's predestinated seed, everything that he ever was, everything you ever will be, everything that he was is in that seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. When that seed's opened, it's going to be everything he he was, &gt;&gt; everything he is, and everything he ever will be. It isn't something written. Now, I could we'll just I'll just have to take a part two on this because I can't finish it. But he said, and I've got many things I wanted to bring out in the first seal, a few quotes in there, but I'll just leave it. He said, 'I always thought that it was something sealed on the back of the book and it wasn't something wrote in the book, but it turned out that it it was made known that he cannot do that. It isn't something that's written in the book. It's something that's been hid in the book. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; For whosoever shall take one word from it or add to it. So, it's a mystery that's been in the book in these seven church ages. Amen. All right. Now, now remember the old testament is not complete without the new. What did he say? And masterpiece the old testament and the new testament is husband and wife. &gt;&gt; You have two halves make a whole. All right. Now he said so it's and new could not be complete without the old. So we could not be complete without the old &gt;&gt; and he can't be complete without the new. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what watch. See, if you were for if you were in the fornowledge of God, his thoughts of himself, then you are becoming a part of God. And the only way you can be a son of God or a daughter of God, you had to be a part of God. And God isn't complete without you. [Music] &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; Okay, there it is. So, he's not complete without you. It has to be. So what was in the back part of his mind that he would reserve to the end? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like in Eden, he created had all the creation. There it was. There was the man and look at the woman had to come forth. She was the capstone revelation of the whole creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. She was the capstone of it. &gt;&gt; Everything was complete in Adam. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But she but he was not complete until that portion of himself was made manifest. &gt;&gt; So she was the capstone. Other words, Jesus Christ the capstone or headstone in the bride form. It's got to be in this hour. &gt;&gt; We don't have another message to manifest. We have the headstone to manifest. &gt;&gt; Of the whole body. For without us they couldn't be made perfect. The whole weight of the thing lays right here. Unless that book was open. John wept. If there's no man worthy, how could there be a rapture? Even though he paid the price of redemption without the claiming of the book, there'd be no body change. &gt;&gt; So, you see, the book's already been claimed &gt;&gt; because we're looking for a body change. We're looking for a meeting in the air. Now, I'm going to finish up right here. I'm just going to keep closing this off. I'm sorry to take so much time. I thought maybe well I never mind what I thought. All right. &gt;&gt; See, if you were in the fornowledge, you are the complete revel. He's not complete without you. Okay. Now, that's right. Because there's only one only one resource of eternal life, and that is God. And him alone has eternal life. Now, and you were a part of him in so much that you were an attribute or his thinking of himself in the beginning. Amen. So how did he bring you out? How did he bring you forth? Through a spoken word. &gt;&gt; So the spoken word was the original seed, &gt;&gt; not the written word. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Not the rema. &gt;&gt; No. The Bible didn't say that. It said in the beginning was the word &gt;&gt; and the word was with God &gt;&gt; and the word was God. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it was a spoken word seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the Bible was put into written form. &gt;&gt; Amen. And did not he come in written form? I mean, did not he come outwardly and took on a form as a son? Is that right? He comes and takes on the form of a bride. But there's a mystery in there &gt;&gt; that's unveiled. &gt;&gt; You see the outward. God sees what's inside. And what's inside will be worked out because I've already ordained the works you should do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There it is. All right. &gt;&gt; So, it's going to be his works through you. &gt;&gt; And his works through you is to believe on him whom God has sent. &gt;&gt; And if you believe on him whom God has sent, the works of Christ will be manifest through you because it's his life living through you. And you're going to hear and you're going to receive the word of promise for this age, &gt;&gt; for this time &gt;&gt; and this season. &gt;&gt; You're going to receive the revelation of it. &gt;&gt; You have to see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now because he thought of you in the beginning, it gives that little tug towards him. That's what has to be quickened because he he he because he thought of you in the beginning. Where'd he think of you in himself? The eternal thought of himself. He said he said and that because he thought of you in the beginning, it gives that little tug toward him. Anybody have a little tug toward him? &gt;&gt; That's the part that has to be quickened. Amen. If you're looking for God in simplicity, there it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's simple, &gt;&gt; but it takes revelation to see it. &gt;&gt; That's what it takes. &gt;&gt; Abel saw him in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Cain did not. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You see, the children of God see him in simplicity. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because it's revealed to them. &gt;&gt; They have his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what has to be quickened. Some of them will never be quickened. They just don't have it. That's all. What don't they have? That tug. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That that that representation in them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That seed to be quickened, be brought alive. So you see if so so just like if you put a grain of a corn of in the grain of corn in the ground know how however pretty it is if it don't have the germ of life in it can never be quickened but the germ of life has to be there first and he said when he come forth in the morning because I live you live also not only see watch what did he tell he brother Brandham said when he quoted that scripture the prophet said he was speaking to his bride because I live you live also Not only was he the beneficiary of the resurrection, but all those seed that was resting in God's great promise was a benefactor of that resurrection of life. Because he said, "Because I live, you live also." That was the breaking of the seal. Because he was brought up, so will everyone that's in Christ be brought up with him. I'm sure this morning, did you catch that? I I don't have time to go back on these things. I'm sure this morning that even we who believe it cannot comprehend what a great thing that was. Because he raised from the dead, we also have raised from the dead for we were in him. &gt;&gt; Because he raised from the dead, we also have raised from the dead because we were in him. &gt;&gt; The revealing of himself in you is the identification that you've come through the blood. &gt;&gt; There's not one sin that can be brought against you. Not one accusation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is not going to accuse you when you're in himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're freed from the law. &gt;&gt; The spirit of life hath made me free from the law of sin and death. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're ministers of the spirit, not of the letter. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I wish I could just have time to reiterate that, but that's it. All right. Now I'm coming to a close here. Just just hold on. I know that's not this the second time. That's not the third closure. All right. That right now. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. We know what the scripture said on that. And so we won't take that time. We will in another time maybe come back to that. Your life is gone and you are dead and your life is dead and you are hid in God through Christ and sealed in there by the Holy Spirit. The mind that was in Christ is in you and Christ in the Bible and the word is the same. Christ the Bible the word is the same. &gt;&gt; So if you be Christ, the prophet identified Christ the bride, the bride is Christ. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you So everything he said in the beginning, okay, then you and the word and God and Christ are the same. If you abide in me and my word in you, ask what you will, it'll be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you are planted in his death, burial, and resurrection, planted in Christ and receive his Holy Spirit life in you. Everything that you ever need, all everything that you have, you've got need of all the way through the journey is in you right then. For you are the seed. You become the seed. You are the seed. See God in his word. Now, what does a tree have to do when you plant it? The only thing you have to do, and I'm closing on these statements, the only thing you have to do is water it. And then it's got to drink. The leaves in it, the apples are in it. Everything's right in that tree. If it be an apple tree, if it's got it's got to drink. It's got to drink more than its portion. There is a great statement. Well, I read I read a few I've read a couple few verses here this morning, and I've done my job. You got to drink a little more than portion. &gt;&gt; Other words, it's pressing in. We press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling. &gt;&gt; As it drinks, it's got to drink. As it drinks, it pushes out. Pushes out leaves, pushes out blossom, pushes out apples. It's got to keep drinking, drinking, drinking in order to push out. Now we're and when we take a promise of God, drop it into our heart, we keep watering it with faith and it keeps pushing out, pushing out. Hallelujah. When Christ is planted in our heart, the Holy Ghost, the only thing you we do is drink in the word of God. And it pushes out salvation, pushes out divine healing, pushes out glory, it pushes out everything that we have need of is right in us when we're planted in Christ Jesus. All right. That's the seed. &gt;&gt; Everything that seed is has to be come manifest. Amen. Because why? It fell into good ground. He he he he broadcast the seed, spoke the seed, fell on this type of ground, fell on this type of ground, fell over here and thorns and fell over here. But it some fell on good ground. &gt;&gt; What ground? Predestinated ground. Planted ground. germ the weed he planted remember the farmer planted his seed good seed in the field &gt;&gt; and the waters came down but the waters fell on weeds &gt;&gt; it fell on hybrids &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; one called him be elsub one called him this one called him something else to call you but what about &gt;&gt; those that fell on good ground &gt;&gt; what are they going to manifest &gt;&gt; see so so the life the word the sun will bring up both seeds &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; that's Right? It falls the spirit or or does the body. If I if you were to kill me and I lay down here, you could pour all kinds of water on me. You put all the Holy Spirit on me. This body will do nothing. So the spirit is or is anointing your spirit realm, your spirit man, not the soul. Now it it it's it can be anointed. The spirit can be anointed. The anointing was for that seed in the soul. &gt;&gt; But it can fall on the spirit, which it does. Amen. Are you with me? Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it can make you do signs and wonders, but never be able to see the word for the season. &gt;&gt; And keep you from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I won't say anymore. You know what the Bible said, the rain falls on the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; It brings them to maturity, both of them. &gt;&gt; But one is able to receive and hear and manifest the word for the season. &gt;&gt; All right. Now you take that tree, plant it in the ground, okay? Water pushes out leaves, blossom, push out apples. And that's the way a Christian is. We are planted together in Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible fountain of life. We are planted in Christ and we just drink, drink, and drink and push out and everything we have need of for the earthly journey, divine healing, the power of God, and all these other things is in every individual that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. For you are planted in Christ. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost baptism. Yes, sir. Everything you have need of in this journey. Even the rapture is right in you then. The rapture is in us now. I'll prove it by the gospel. Those that he called, he justified. Those that he justified, he glorified. Those that he justified, he hath glorified. There's your answer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then in heaven today, we are glorified in the presence of God. right now. I'm just pushing out to it. Amen. Glory. God in his word. You believe it? All right. &gt;&gt; Stand with me and then don't play anything yet. I just want to read a couple things more. This is what we're looking for now. Now, just bear with me. This is the closure right here. What a great thing it is today, Lord, to know that we are now united with one spirit. One spirit, the Holy Spirit has got the word in his grip comes in us. And what a great thing it is, what a privilege to cut loose from the world, to unite ourselves to Jesus Christ. And to think that someday in a physical form with a body like his own glorious body, we will sit down at the table at the wedding supper and there be united and wed in marriage to him. to live as a bride and bridegroom through all times. That is to come through a ceaseless eternity. &gt;&gt; Lord God, may this not be a mythical thought to the people. And let me say this morning, but may it become such a reality till such hunger and thirst will set in the people that that they'll read their newspapers looking upon listening at the radio and the news and see its uniting time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The signs. What is uniting? We see the uniting of these other things. But what about the bride and the word uniting? &gt;&gt; All right. But but seeing it's uniting time. The signs are flashing. And to think of us standing to think of us now, now he's turned it to the bride. To think of us standing in a moment in a twinkling of an eye when the world won't even know what's going on. Won't know what's going on. But all of a sudden, you you'll see appear before you your loved ones that's gone on has come to unite with you again. And we'll be changed in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, and be caught up together to meet our Lord in the air. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You tell me if that's not what we're looking for right now. I look for it every day. I look for my loved ones to appear before me. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. My loved ones is everyone there in that theophony body is my loved ones. &gt;&gt; Amen. It can be my loved ones relations, but they'll tell you every one of them are my loved ones. &gt;&gt; That's my family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm looking for that appearing. Brother, sister, we're so close to that you can almost taste it. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's just a word to speak it, but I mean, it's that close. &gt;&gt; Because why? A bride's coming to her maturity. &gt;&gt; She knows who she is. She sees what she is. She sees her position and lining up with every word because she is the word. Her husband is the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, won't that be a time then to unite with him to be there forever and never have to be out of his presence again. Oh, won't that be a time? Just walking along someday and here appears somebody. Who is it? Mother. Amen. it. And that means a lot to me and probably a lot to others here that have lost a mother that was a real believer. See? All right. Amen. It ain't going to be long now. Just a few minutes, you're changed when you meet him. And we'll meet them. Then be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air. Oh, what a Oh, in a moment. In the twinkling of an eye. Say, "Here is brother Seard, the old brother that used to be at the church here. Why? Here's brother Dark. Why? Here's brother so and why lookucky here. They're all around me. What's the matter? Just in a few minutes. I know they've done appeared to me. It ain't going to be long now. I'm going to be changed now. Just in a moment. Just in a moment. Oh yes. In the And the morning breaks eternal, bright, and fair. I said that because that's what's ahead right now. That's where we're at. God has brought us up to date. &gt;&gt; We know where we're standing. This is our day. &gt;&gt; Thy light has come. &gt;&gt; Arise, bride. &gt;&gt; Thy light has come. &gt;&gt; You'll be sitting here one of these days all consumed in your little place and too busy to feed upon the opened word. and say, "I thought we were I thought there was to be a rapture happen before this tribulation." What are we seeing happening? We're seeing the fulfilling of the word, &gt;&gt; judgment. The judge has already took his stand. Amen. Amen. White-wigged. We see judgment's already struck the West Coast. &gt;&gt; We see judgment has already struck. He said, "It's already begun. &gt;&gt; It's heading right out into the full manifestation of those. We It's got to rapture out of here, brother, sister. We've got to leave." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before before that, before Israel even gets their message, we've got to be out. We got to be gone. They're waiting for us to leave. &gt;&gt; Just think of that. They're over there just waiting for us to get out of the way. &gt;&gt; Two witnesses to come to them. Bring to them what happened. redemption than sealing. What a beautiful promise. We see so many things. There's so many things that we could speak of happening in the nation, happening here, happening there. Everything just times and seasons perfectly put together through all these years. You see, I don't know, brother, sister. I may I may not be here. I I trust that I am I can be here and alive and remain to be changed and see my loved one. But if I'm not, look for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because I'm gonna come out. I'll be one of those. &gt;&gt; Maybe my wife will be late sitting here. I'll appear to her. I don't know. I don't know. But I know we're close. You must make yourself ready. &gt;&gt; If there's even a tug in your heart, then why not surrender? Why are you willing to keep living for self? yourself hadn't taken you nowhere. This old self man corrupted as it was, it is. God in his mercy has sanctified it and cleansed it and called it his own and come down and live inside of you and said, "I'll quicken your mortal body and bring it subject to my word." Now, how much better do you want it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me when I said that? If the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ shall also quicken your mortal body. Other words, I'll bring it subject to my word. Amen. Heavenly Father, as we stand here this morning, my heart's trembling. I know I've taken time, Lord, and it's not my will to do that. You know that. But Lord, I believe it's your will. Father, if Lord, help us. Just help us to realize the importance of what's taking place in this hour. I know you'll give revelation. Open your little bride's heart to these things. If some have been slack, some have been slothful. Lord, put something in that something that they need to said, "No more. I made a decision. I'm going all the way with my Lord. I'm going to press in toward that mark, for that goal, for the prize of the high calling. Listen, this bride has a very high calling. Wonder, do you hear him calling? Do you hear him calling to you this morning to let go and let that little tug in your heart be quickened? You said, "Well, Brother David, I've I've I've repented. I've been baptized." Yes, many have. they've aimed at but then they got relaxed. They didn't go any further. Oh God, let there be a true baptism. If there's any seed here yet that have not been truly born again, let there come a true baptism upon the seed in their soul. But Lord, if that pull is there and as they feed on that word, they're drawing life to quicken that seed within them. Quicken that seed, Lord. They keep drinking, drinking, drawing. Let's keep drawing. Lord, help us to keep drawing. Lord, I pray for everyone. I don't want a one in here to miss that rapture. I'm asking you to become so alive in them and the person of Christ to be known to them and made alive. That seed in them quickened and made alive. And they know you, the person, the word, not a feeling, not an emotion, not a coming to church. And we believe in coming to church. we but these things won't save us. &gt;&gt; It's knowing you. &gt;&gt; It's knowing you, Lord. And submitting ourselves completely to you. A lot's been said this morning. A lot could be said further. And if it be your will, maybe we could come back and take a part two on this. I don't know, Lord. There's so much more. But Father, I commit every individual here, every individual on the internet, everyone that's hearing this voice, may they truly hear the voice, Lord. May they truly realize they're the mystery hidden in the word. And when you said you opened that book, you opened everyone. Who was the book? The book was given to the bride. She is the book. She is the living book. She is the living word. That book, her name, that mystery in there called her name and she's in there. The mystery of yourself made fully manifest the complete revelation of the whole thing. Lord God, have your way. Have your way with every individual. And Lord, I ask this now in thy name, the Lord Jesus Christ. Let him make that decision right now. Decide it. Decide it. Die. Just die completely. Die to yourself. and say, "I'm not going to live for self anymore. I made the decision, Lord. I'm going to feed and water that seed in my heart. Fill me, Lord. Fill me and refill me. Fill me and refill me till I'm changed in the moment. Till I'm changed. Change. Not only inward change, but the inward change for the outward change. Grant it, Lord, for your glory and honor. I pray in Jesus name I pray." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister. &gt;&gt; Well, [Music] that on fire for Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I've asked him in my heart. I've given everything to him and I'm proclaiming in public that he is my Lord and Savior and I love him. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. We're going to come upon yours your confession in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, may this little sister be filled completely with your word for she's confessed publicly, Lord, that you are her savior, you are her salvation. She loves you and wants more of you. Then I say upon the ful upon her confession, I give to her the desire of her heart in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Feed on his word. Amen. Amen. Amen. Oh, I'd like to see a few more come up here and start confessing that. &gt;&gt; I know there's some in here that need to turn around and say, you know what the Bible said? He that will confess me before men, I will confess before my father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Don't you think little of her doing that. That was right. &gt;&gt; That took the Holy Ghost, sister. That wasn't just a That wasn't a That wasn't you. That was God in you. &gt;&gt; I believe him. &gt;&gt; I may not understand everything was said. I'm not asking her to. But one thing I do ask it touched her heart. &gt;&gt; How many of you has it touched? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See what I'm saying this morning? What happened here? What you seen? This little sister confessed what she did. According to God's word, God has saved her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say, God, fill her. &gt;&gt; Fill it overflowing. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed to declare myself. I love him with all my heart. &gt;&gt; I was a very young boy, but I didn't stop there. I went on. God filled me and he's refilled me and filled me. &gt;&gt; Filled me. He's still filling me &gt;&gt; with revelation himself revealing himself. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Where are we standing today? [Music] &gt;&gt; God bless that little sister for &gt;&gt; not ashamed to stand up and say, "I love him and he's my savior." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many raise your hands just as a sign say he's my savior. He's my salvation. He's my redemption. He's my my King. Amen. He's my Lord. He's calling for me for him to come me. Lay down everything else and give yourself over to me and let me work through you. &gt;&gt; Lord, with all of our hearts, &gt;&gt; you see these hands. &gt;&gt; There's nothing hid behind those hands. But what you know [Music] God be with you. &gt;&gt; I couldn't raise your hand. &gt;&gt; I say God help you to raise it &gt;&gt; and make it known. &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking. This message is not a certain class of people. It's for you. Every one of you here. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not I can preach the gospel. You know what? I can be anointed to preach this gospel. But what am I preaching? The anointing doesn't save a preacher. Many preachers will preach will preach the word. But don't preach the word for the season. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it wasn't their miracles, signs, and wonders. It was their teaching on the word. What were they saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; What are they preaching to you? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is it the word for the season or some other season? &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you, every one of you, if you aren't born again, you must be born again. &gt;&gt; Don't think you're going to get in by your good works and your merits. They're not going to they're not doing a thing for you. You must have a true baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul. &gt;&gt; And if you're hungry for God and there's a tug in your heart, I say give up and give way to him right now. you go out that door, it may be too late. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to make it point blank to you. I don't know, but I know we're very close. You may not even make it home. You tell me where are you spending eternity. &gt;&gt; Well, you tell brother David, I got an education. I'm not talking about your education. I'm talking about your soul. I'm talking about who's in that soul. Who are you feeding on? What is your motive? What's your objective? Where's your ambition today? &gt;&gt; What's your preeminence? Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Who Who is your absolute [Music] &gt;&gt; What's you playing that? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; I surren I say let it be a time of surrender this morning. I surrender all. You see these hands, Lord? I couldn't raise them unless there's something in me to raise my hands and to defy gravity. Lord, you made me raise my hands. Surrender all. You say, "Brother David, I don't have to surrender my hand." Answer that to him. You're not answering it to me. You're answering to him. He knows your motive. He knows your objective. I say let's surrender to him. Let's have it a time of surrender. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Let's give ourselves aresh to him then. I surrender all. I &gt;&gt; do you. All means all. All to thee, my blessed redeemer, redeemer, [Music] &gt;&gt; my husband, girl. You remember in Ruth where he took his shoe in a public witness that I've redeemed Ruth and Naomi. You remember the next the next chapter, I think it is, or maybe the same chapter. What was next? He took the book. He took Ruth to be his wife. &gt;&gt; He'd done the work of redemption. Then he took Ruth to be his wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He laid claim on what he purchased. &gt;&gt; That's what God's doing with the bride this morning. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's just surrender all.

And if the angel is stirring the waters, you need to jump in there. Amen. Amen. It's good to be identified with such a word that we have that we heard today.
