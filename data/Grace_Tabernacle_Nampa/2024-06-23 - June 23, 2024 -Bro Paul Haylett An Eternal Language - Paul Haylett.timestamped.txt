[17:48] coming Sunday June 30th 5:00 pm we will
[17:51] be having communion uh so uh we've been
[17:55] so busy sometimes it's easy to push
[17:58] something a day at a little bit but we
[17:59] need to drive that steak in the ground
[18:01] so next Sunday June 30th at 5:00 p.m.
[18:05] amen we'll have communion I want to
[18:07] share this right before we go into the
[18:09] word of God at Camp there's a sister I
[18:13] choose to keep her unnamed but uh it's
[18:16] been a little over a year that she had
[18:20] um voiced to me uh that she wasn't
[18:23] feeling well we' prayed with her and
[18:26] then it was about four or five months
[18:28] ago or whatever it's been that um maybe
[18:33] not that long but uh know what you're
[18:36] talking I'm talking about when we were
[18:38] up for the um banquet uh however that's
[18:42] long three or four months she expressed
[18:44] to me the doctors thought that she had
[18:49] Ms she had been suffering some symptoms
[18:53] they said this is clearly the symptoms
[18:56] of MS she she wanted to just keep it
[18:59] close to home but we prayed with her and
[19:03] um you know just believed and that was
[19:06] many of the unspoken requests that
[19:08] brother Paul had presented to you was
[19:10] this sister and uh we just uh believed
[19:13] we believe our God's A Healer right we
[19:15] can say Amen to that this morning he's a
[19:17] Healer amen we don't hope he's a Healer
[19:20] we don't wait for him to prove that he's
[19:22] a Healer we declare to the world he is
[19:26] our healer amen and uh so at Camp uh
[19:31] just a few days ago this sister
[19:33] approached brother Danny and myself to
[19:35] share a
[19:36] testimony and um as as she was there
[19:41] it's very emotional thing if you imagine
[19:43] your whole life just goes into a a
[19:45] pattern not good and she broke down in
[19:48] tears and at first I thought oh my we're
[19:51] maybe got bad news or something here and
[19:54] uh she gathered
[19:56] herself I'm healed amen prise the Lord I
[20:00] don't have the symptoms the doctors can
[20:02] find nothing am amen we Rejoice with her
[20:06] amen
[20:12] hallelujah and to those of you that have
[20:15] had something on that serious note I
[20:16] know our sister Andreas had a few bouts
[20:19] with this on the serious note when God
[20:21] heals you you cannot just walk away and
[20:24] simply say thank you it is a
[20:27] lifechanging event
[20:29] amen one you will never forget and one
[20:32] that we will bring as a testimony that
[20:34] day before the unbeliever before those
[20:37] who couldn't gather their faith around
[20:39] the word and we will become the
[20:42] testimony of the healing power and the
[20:44] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ I'm so
[20:46] glad the Lord includes us amen it could
[20:49] all be happening we'd say well praise
[20:51] God we've never had an issue like that
[20:53] in our church but I tell you look at it
[20:55] from the other side you've never had a
[20:58] chance chance to prove the word then
[21:01] amen we don't like that but God wants
[21:03] you to prove the word and he has
[21:07] confidence when these things come your
[21:09] way that you will stand with the word
[21:11] and prove it amen thank you Lord that we
[21:15] can prove the word amen hallelujah let's
[21:18] turn our Bibles this morning I want to
[21:21] speak to you uh on the title of an
[21:26] internal internal
[21:28] Eternal excuse me an eternal ex it says
[21:33] oh that says external somebody's
[21:35] spelling my spelling they're spelling
[21:37] who knows amen an eternal language amen
[21:41] we'll get this right an eternal language
[21:43] amen a language that's never changed
[21:46] amen we were in Christ before the
[21:48] foundation of the world and what he
[21:50] spoke about you was in you in that
[21:53] thought before the foundation of the
[21:55] world so encapsulated in you was God's
[21:58] thoughts God's words before there ever
[22:01] was in our mind a you an us amen it was
[22:05] already there it was already presented
[22:08] it was already ready to be expressed and
[22:11] the day come and here we are and God has
[22:13] given us an eternal language that is
[22:17] being spoken and my brother and sister I
[22:20] say thank you Lord because we don't have
[22:22] to back up and find a cross reference to
[22:25] see where we got off because the word
[22:27] never left the word amen and what's in
[22:30] you will never leave the word and thank
[22:33] you Lord for that amen let's turn I want
[22:36] to take a very interesting maybe maybe
[22:38] you'll find it normal um a thought out
[22:41] of Genesis 11 this morning vers 1
[22:44] through 8
[22:46] uh for a language to be Eternal it had
[22:49] to be as brother brandom teaches us it
[22:52] it has to be if you are Eternal then you
[22:55] had to be in Christ from the beginning
[22:57] you were not added into this plan of God
[23:01] he didn't say I wrote this story and
[23:02] oops I forgot you I'll put you in now
[23:05] brother brandom says if you are Eternal
[23:08] you always was amen somebody ought to
[23:12] say Thank You Lord on that that we
[23:14] always was amen but we'll see that that
[23:18] do things do change and how that things
[23:21] are introduced and how God corrects
[23:23] things and and how it comes so we'll
[23:25] start with verse one and the whole Earth
[23:29] was of one language and of one speech
[23:32] now when it uses language and speech
[23:35] there it's saying that we were all
[23:37] speaking as it would use whatever
[23:39] language you want to we're all speaking
[23:41] English French or this or that but uh
[23:44] being of uh one speech is a word
[23:49] denoting that they were in accord with
[23:51] one another of the same mind speaking of
[23:54] the same ideologies of the same
[23:57] convictions and and so one language one
[24:01] uh uh Speech and it came to pass as they
[24:04] journeyed from the East that they found
[24:05] a plane in the land of Shar and they
[24:07] dwelt there and they said one to another
[24:10] go let us make brick and burn them
[24:13] thoroughly that they uh had brick for
[24:16] stone and slime had they for Mortar and
[24:19] they said go let us build us a city and
[24:23] a tower whose top May reach into the
[24:26] heaven and let us make a name lest we be
[24:29] scattered abroad upon the face of the
[24:32] whole earth and the Lord came down to
[24:34] see the city and the tower where the
[24:36] children of men build it and the Lord
[24:38] said behold the people is one and they
[24:41] have all gone all have one language and
[24:44] this they begin to do and now nothing
[24:47] will be restrained from them which they
[24:50] have imagined to do go to let us go down
[24:55] and there confound their language
[24:59] that they may not understand one
[25:01] another's speech and the Lord scattered
[25:04] them abroad from then upon the face of
[25:07] all the Earth and they left off to build
[25:10] the city amen Heavenly Father we just
[25:13] ask you Lord help us to speak with
[25:15] Clarity this morning Father we love you
[25:18] we thank you for the word you've given
[25:19] us in this hour and Lord as we approach
[25:22] the word today we ask for your guidance
[25:24] open our hearts open our minds to
[25:26] receive you Lord in in this word in this
[25:30] hour every prayer request every Health
[25:32] need Lord every testimony we say thank
[25:35] you Father for the answer has already
[25:37] come and we have received it in the name
[25:40] of Jesus Christ we bless your name amen
[25:43] you may be seated since now there as we
[25:47] look at this uh we see that the people
[25:52] were there all in uh you might say one
[25:54] mind and one Accord and it was there
[25:57] that that it is that they are
[26:00] declaring uh we can build something that
[26:03] will get us into the heavens and it will
[26:06] give us a name it will uh bring
[26:09] recognition to us and otherwise we're
[26:12] going to just be scattered and in that
[26:15] we recognize you you have to catch
[26:17] little things the prophet of God says
[26:19] down through the message and a little
[26:20] bit much to just quote and guide each
[26:22] one this morning but if you study the
[26:24] message you'll know what I'm talking
[26:26] about and and we'll recognize this is
[26:29] the spirit of denomination so they
[26:31] believe they could build something that
[26:34] would be beautiful that would draw all
[26:36] the people together and in that they
[26:39] were coming uh uh to to prove what kind
[26:42] of people they were and truly they did
[26:45] now there is a a uh uh scripturally
[26:50] based uh uh premise of anything that can
[26:53] be broken will be broken so God's not
[26:56] going to let anything that is false
[26:58] stand it it will be broken and uh you
[27:01] know while the word has come in Earth
[27:03] and vessels my brother and sister the
[27:05] reason these vessels are not broken you
[27:07] often hear it's a spirit of denomination
[27:09] in my opinion I'll I'll very clearly say
[27:12] my opinion but my brother and sister
[27:14] there's a whole thing in the world today
[27:17] amongst the denomination that they come
[27:19] and they're justifying the means and
[27:21] behavior that they have and they say
[27:23] well God knows I'm broken well I'm here
[27:26] to tell you this morning my God is in
[27:28] the fixing business amen we're not going
[27:31] to just remain broken and use that as an
[27:34] excuse of why we do what we do react why
[27:38] we how we react and refuse to
[27:42] move by the word I'm
[27:45] broken good come as you are leave fixed
[27:49] amen amen that's what the Bible says
[27:51] that's what the word says that's what
[27:52] church is about come broken leave fixed
[27:55] amen if we leave fixed it's because we
[27:58] chose to leave fixed I mean uh broken
[28:01] sorry if we leave broken it's because we
[28:03] chose to leave broken amen because
[28:06] Deliverance is in the house of God and
[28:08] so we see how this is very much uh
[28:12] confined within the words that the
[28:14] prophet spoke of the day that we live in
[28:17] and as you see people trying to get into
[28:20] Heavenly places now my brother and
[28:21] sister I believe I could lift my hand
[28:23] for each and every one we want to dwell
[28:25] in Heavenly places do we not that's the
[28:27] world we want to live in not down here
[28:29] in this carnal dirt but in Heavenly
[28:31] places but you see we don't put
[28:34] ourselves in Heavenly places amen we
[28:37] create an atmosphere we uh stand on the
[28:40] word there's a lot to this and and we're
[28:42] going to be very brief but it is
[28:44] ultimately that we don't put oursel in
[28:47] Heavenly places we get into the presence
[28:49] of God the Holy Spirit pulls you and I
[28:52] up into Heavenly places no man can come
[28:55] you see worship you see things in
[28:57] churches where they have a rhythm a beat
[28:59] and they just keep at it and keep at it
[29:01] until people start to enter in my
[29:03] brother and sister they're preaching to
[29:04] the flesh amen they're not the word is
[29:07] what moves amen the spirit is what moves
[29:10] the Bride of Jesus Christ not the Flesh
[29:13] and so is this comes the people trying
[29:15] to get into Heavenly places now you talk
[29:17] about a real works gospel we're going to
[29:19] build us a tower and we're going to get
[29:21] up into Heavenly places and we're going
[29:23] to dwell up there in this glorious place
[29:26] we can do it
[29:28] but God said you know what if they get
[29:30] into that and I leave them in that
[29:33] position they will be able to accomplish
[29:35] almost anything they want by the flesh
[29:38] I'll tell you how powerful the flesh is
[29:40] my brother and sister it is enough to
[29:42] build a tower lift yourself up give
[29:45] yourself a big name and then dwell in
[29:48] that realm saying look what I have done
[29:50] but what God Said is you are uh strong
[29:53] when you are weak amen he says when you
[29:57] are in your low element in that flesh in
[30:00] the humanity that's when you're strong
[30:02] because you cry out amen every time we
[30:05] start to say you know what praise God I
[30:07] overcome this I I I my brother and
[30:10] sister that old Fox is going to come
[30:12] back and chew on your Vine he's not
[30:15] going to leave that alone amen so it was
[30:17] a concerted effort by man to produce the
[30:23] supernatural we live in a day that men
[30:25] believe I listen I I won't mention names
[30:28] but I listened to a man just a few days
[30:30] ago a little snippet a little clip and
[30:33] and uh he was declaring what he has done
[30:36] and he had a whole long list a laundry
[30:38] list of the things that he believed his
[30:41] ministry produced not one time did he
[30:44] recognize God in their midst it was
[30:46] about him and so we see that in this
[30:48] element they're building it and people
[30:50] around rally around it there's there's
[30:53] an estimated 100,000 people follow this
[30:56] man around the world quite a crowd my
[30:58] brother and sister but it's there that
[31:00] that's all they're going to have is
[31:02] their own Tower of
[31:04] Babel and when he falls they fall with
[31:07] him but the bride of Christ anchored in
[31:09] the word built up in the word nourished
[31:11] in the word lifted up into Heavenly
[31:14] places no matter what man falls they
[31:16] will stand the test of time on the word
[31:19] because they never were anchored in the
[31:21] man it was always Jesus Christ I say
[31:23] thank you Lord we can be anchored in the
[31:26] Supernatural amen
[31:28] we can build our own Tower to get into
[31:30] the Heavenly my brother and sister but
[31:32] I'd rather just submit myself to the
[31:34] Lord and let him take me into Heavenly
[31:36] places
[31:38] hallelujah amen so you see the day that
[31:41] we're living in and I hope that you
[31:42] don't mind me preaching this this way uh
[31:46] what the day that we live in there is a
[31:48] very strong anointed to come back to a
[31:50] unified voice can we as Believers of the
[31:53] message say Amen to that amen we stand
[31:56] here today saying you know what we need
[31:59] to go back get into the original word
[32:01] get back into Jesus Christ but you see
[32:04] there's always Twins and so Satan has
[32:07] his own twin and there is also a voice
[32:10] in this day that is here bringing Unity
[32:14] my brother and sister the prophet of God
[32:15] started all the way back in 1954
[32:18] preaching about the the uh uh uh church
[32:21] and how that they're going to come
[32:23] together and they're going to unify and
[32:25] if you don't uh get in with them amen
[32:28] the council you got to be part of the
[32:29] council you got to be part of this group
[32:32] this is where God's at have you seen how
[32:35] much brick and mortar they have placed
[32:37] since
[32:38] 1954 my brother and sister they have
[32:40] built and built and built and built and
[32:42] one by one churches denominations feel
[32:45] compelled to put their brick into the
[32:48] building they feel that they need to be
[32:50] identified and they're putting
[32:52] themselves in there because this is
[32:54] where God's at my brother and sister
[32:56] that was God in an image of their mind
[33:00] that was their God their image that they
[33:03] were building but by God's grace we've
[33:05] been given 2020 Vision amen I stand here
[33:08] today in the natural wearing glasses but
[33:10] spiritually God has come and says you
[33:12] don't need someone else's answer you
[33:15] just need to look in the word I'll give
[33:17] you Clarity in the word and it will draw
[33:19] us together to come to this place of
[33:22] heavenly places amen so Satan coming in
[33:26] a unified voice now you know you look at
[33:29] this and verse four said they said go
[33:32] let us build us a city and a tower uh
[33:35] whose top May reach into heaven and let
[33:37] us make a name so everyone wants to make
[33:40] a name for himself and if we're not
[33:42] careful the devil will try to get us to
[33:44] make a name for ourself but I tell you
[33:47] what I'd rather just be identified in
[33:49] Jesus Christ and be one of his nobodies
[33:51] amen but be standing there in his
[33:54] pleasure amen now look at this they're
[33:58] expressing a desire to be lifted up is
[34:01] that any different than
[34:03] you now think about it weigh the
[34:07] words I have a incredible desire to be
[34:11] lifted
[34:14] up but I want to do it the right way
[34:17] that's right I want to do it God's
[34:19] provided way amen I want to enter into
[34:22] that and be lifted up into Heavenly
[34:25] places in Christ amen
[34:28] that's the only thing that matters
[34:29] because we get lifted up our own self I
[34:31] just was reading a deal and I forget the
[34:33] guy's name now I recognized it at the
[34:35] time man very successful in his life and
[34:37] he's still
[34:40] dead be known be wealthy won't stop it
[34:45] but to be lifted up in Jesus Christ look
[34:48] how the word said you're not dead
[34:52] they're not dead they're
[34:54] asleep amen there's sure a difference
[34:56] between being dead and being asleep
[34:59] having a hope of the Resurrection Amen
[35:01] to rise up in the presence of God than
[35:04] to be so fabulously wealthy and
[35:06] successful and lifted up in your own
[35:09] mind and be
[35:14] dead they wanted to be lifted up and to
[35:17] be built up my brother and sister I'm
[35:19] pulling a lot of thoughts
[35:24] together to be built up does the word
[35:27] tell us to be built
[35:30] up but look how this so close parallel
[35:33] is of being built
[35:36] up Satan's so
[35:39] fantastic at taking everything God and
[35:43] restructuring that and making it a more
[35:46] glamorous image because for you and I to
[35:49] be built up we have to die amen for them
[35:53] to be built up they live they themselves
[35:57] live
[35:58] and we die the flesh says wait I want to
[36:02] live but the spirit says you need to
[36:06] die so it's such a clear
[36:09] concise
[36:11] imitation that's being presented to the
[36:14] people amen so it's there being built up
[36:18] by their interpretation or being built
[36:21] up by God's
[36:23] interpretation how close it is in the
[36:26] flesh but how how incredibly different
[36:31] the result in the end the
[36:33] destination amen so we see how God is
[36:36] moving now we see how they're natural
[36:39] they're building imagine never seen a
[36:41] church with such
[36:43] Harmony everyone in the same mind the
[36:45] same speech the same motivation with the
[36:48] same unction building this Tower because
[36:51] we're going to go into the heavens we're
[36:54] going to go see what's up there
[36:57] and all in one mind nobody complaining
[37:00] why is he a supervisor and I'm a brick
[37:02] pounder everybody is like this is our
[37:05] project this is our Church's goal this
[37:07] is the end result we are all in
[37:09] searching for and they come and one day
[37:12] God looks down and says no less they
[37:14] would actually
[37:16] accomplish what they wanted now look
[37:19] natural spiritual if they could not be
[37:22] allowed there in that time in uh Babylon
[37:26] if they were not allowed to move into
[37:28] Heavenly places then will God allow them
[37:31] to come into Heavenly places now no my
[37:34] brother and sister the prophet of God
[37:36] says his whole world Council of churches
[37:38] is a false Unity that they will all in
[37:42] the end find out they've been caused to
[37:44] be submitted to the Antichrist and the
[37:47] old time they thought they were
[37:49] equals but the whole
[37:52] time Nimrod had a
[37:55] plan Nimrod had had to focus and if God
[37:59] had allowed that to carry out ultimately
[38:01] when the tower was built they would have
[38:04] found out they had to bow down to Nimrod
[38:08] nimrod's whole goal was to be at the top
[38:12] of everything that the people themselves
[38:15] would find themselves caused to worship
[38:19] Nimrod amen that was the whole plan from
[38:21] the beginning not an equality thing but
[38:24] he had a plan that one day to spring it
[38:27] on them that I am and you will and if
[38:30] you
[38:32] don't and it's there I love how brother
[38:35] brandom puts these things together amen
[38:39] you see their natural language was one
[38:41] of unity but God confounds it and
[38:44] remember now this image this basis
[38:46] that's here is the rain falling on the
[38:49] just and the unjust amen so when you
[38:52] think about the power that God has given
[38:54] you I I you don't have to raise a hand
[38:56] you have to do it I just want you you to
[38:57] recognize have you ever followed the
[39:00] guidance of the word and called out his
[39:03] name and watched God come on the scene
[39:05] and change it every one of us here
[39:08] should have approached God in that
[39:10] fashion and said Lord I need you now I
[39:12] need a victory right now I need a
[39:15] defense right now and see God come on
[39:17] the scene amen I could bore you to tears
[39:22] with just my own experience amen we
[39:24] serve a God that hears us we we serve a
[39:27] God that listens to our need our hearts
[39:31] Cry he's right there on the scene to say
[39:34] I heard you and I will fulfill it amen
[39:38] I'll just share one little brief image
[39:40] that seared into my mind of knowing god
[39:42] is instant in season one time going down
[39:45] snow snowwy pass the roads had been
[39:48] clear it was about this time of year and
[39:52] it snowed four or 5 Ines mushy snow and
[39:56] the minute people ran over it turned
[39:57] into ice and I had unloaded wachi and
[40:01] and I'm going over to go up almost to
[40:03] Lyon and and uh I have one pallet on
[40:07] this
[40:08] semi-trailer and then all of a sudden a
[40:10] car hits the bank over here spins
[40:13] through traffic passes within a few feet
[40:16] of the nose of my truck and I stomped on
[40:19] the brakes and my trailer swung all the
[40:22] way out I'm in the second lane my
[40:23] trailer's over here rubbing on the guard
[40:25] rail and then the car comes over and
[40:27] hits the guard rail and starts going
[40:29] backwards towards it would have
[40:31] decapitated everyone in that car would
[40:34] have just cut the top out of
[40:37] it did I do anything Supernatural no I
[40:40] didn't snap my fingers but I said oh
[40:43] Lord help
[40:44] me and you've never seen a truck a
[40:47] semi-trailer straighten itself out so
[40:50] fast one minute it's over here pointed
[40:52] out like this and next minute it's
[40:54] perfectly behind me and still the car
[40:56] only missed the corner of the trailer by
[40:58] just this just a few
[41:00] inches and that was just Paul all by
[41:03] himself you can say well you know your
[41:06] trailer found traction you know this and
[41:09] that and whatever I know the hand of
[41:11] Jehovah come right down put his hand on
[41:13] that trailer moved it over not only did
[41:16] he spare me the circumstance he spared
[41:19] their lives amen that's our God instant
[41:22] in season we don't have to stop and say
[41:25] well I guess I'll just have to pray
[41:26] about this for years to get an answer
[41:29] for God sometimes God's answer takes
[41:32] time because he tests you with time
[41:35] that's it's time that proves that you're
[41:37] going to stick with him it's not if he
[41:39] doesn't answer I'm going away but you
[41:42] sit there and say you know what I know
[41:44] my god's got the answer and I'm going to
[41:46] be right here Lord when you come to give
[41:49] the answer amen and we see this a
[41:54] spiritual
[41:55] desire when this was all broken
[41:59] up nimrod's little plan he no longer had
[42:03] one voice with the
[42:07] people there was
[42:09] Luther there was
[42:11] Wesley there was
[42:14] Pentecost there was assemblies
[42:17] and this and that all these different
[42:23] voices we think it's done we think it's
[42:26] it's good it's
[42:28] settle but the spirit of
[42:31] nimrod didn't
[42:34] die wonder why we have tests today
[42:38] because the one spirit that one wanted
[42:41] to dominate your life is still wanting
[42:44] to denominate your life amen he hasn't
[42:47] went away he hasn't died amen there's no
[42:50] Tower of Babel in the sense of Tower of
[42:53] Babel but he's still been building Brick
[42:56] by Brick by Brick he's still opposed to
[42:59] you he still wants to bring you in
[43:01] subjection he still wants to rule your
[43:10] life so in a spiritual
[43:13] sense that spiritual desire of nimrod is
[43:16] still
[43:17] there the very desire and expression in
[43:20] a spiritual realm now let's go over to
[43:25] the book of Isaiah 14th chapter
[43:34] we find now how that
[43:37] Isaiah by Perfect Vision of God sees
[43:41] this whole
[43:42] picture now if you want to you can but I
[43:47] want you to understand the prophet of
[43:49] God fully declar that the spirit of
[43:52] nimrod was
[43:55] Lucifer it's who it is
[43:58] so that was the original
[44:01] attempt
[44:03] of overpowering the church overpowering
[44:06] the Believers the original attempt is
[44:08] here with Nimrod now Isaiah is speaking
[44:11] of nimrod here but he's speaking with
[44:13] the words o Lucifer how art thou fallen
[44:16] from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning
[44:19] how art th cut down to the ground which
[44:22] did weaken the Nations for thou Hast
[44:25] said in thy heart I will ass asend into
[44:28] heaven I will exalt my throne above the
[44:30] stars of God I will sit also upon the
[44:34] Mount of the congregation in the sides
[44:36] of the north I will Ascend above the
[44:38] heights of the clouds I will be like the
[44:41] most high this was nimrod's desire right
[44:44] here this is what he wanted to do
[44:46] because it's not actually the earth that
[44:49] is at State it's you amen that's what he
[44:52] wants because if he can pull the
[44:54] attention of the people and F focus it
[44:57] in another realm where they believe
[45:00] they're serving God but serving the
[45:03] devil amen then he knows at that point
[45:06] sincere people will sincerely read their
[45:08] Bible will sincerely worship will
[45:11] sincerely be in the house of God
[45:14] faithfully and be completely wrong right
[45:18] and so the very idea that they believe
[45:20] that they they are in the right place
[45:23] now this morning I'll just be open to
[45:25] you I was watching a little thing and
[45:28] and uh you know Sister Jerry's like why
[45:31] in the world are you looking at that uh
[45:33] I'll get to it in a minute but I want
[45:35] you to understand how carefully Satan
[45:38] can craft this to catch the attention of
[45:41] the people believing all is believing
[45:44] everything is lined up life is good my
[45:47] brother and S sister that's why the
[45:49] prophet of God said it's not a church
[45:51] experience it's not an experience with
[45:53] your pastor it's not an experience with
[45:55] this great man over here not in
[45:57] experience brother brandham says not
[45:59] once did I call you to follow me amen
[46:03] because he is declaring this has to be
[46:06] an experience with Jesus Christ because
[46:10] how clever Satan is we think the message
[46:12] is truth is it truth amen we think we've
[46:16] got truth but Satan can come right in
[46:19] amen remember brother Danny talking
[46:21] about adding another
[46:24] version a few more words
[46:27] changing it just a little bit make it a
[46:31] little more appealing for you to follow
[46:37] me that ain't going to happen is it I
[46:40] know that by the smirks on some of your
[46:43] faces and I say thank you
[46:46] Lord because we have failed if you
[46:49] follow
[46:54] me now look at this
[46:58] I will Ascend into heaven Nimrod says
[47:01] let's build a
[47:03] tower and we got Unity complete Unity
[47:06] amongst everybody to build a
[47:11] tower you know the tower is still being
[47:14] built that's
[47:18] right they're going to rise up at the
[47:20] heights of the clouds Heavenly
[47:22] places how clever he words that I will
[47:26] be like the most
[47:31] high pretty
[47:34] good they think they're just worshiping
[47:36] in a
[47:37] likeness only they're actually
[47:39] worshiping Lucifer that's right this
[47:43] probably not the most exciting sermon is
[47:46] it but it's what the Lord laid on my
[47:48] heart amen amen now let's look at this
[47:52] we would never fall for a nimrod
[47:55] gospel but sometimes we fall for this
[47:57] whole thing I can do enough work to get
[48:00] my way to
[48:02] heaven that's an old Nimrod Spirit
[48:04] coming along that I can just labor labor
[48:06] labor labor you know what it's not labor
[48:08] it's life amen it's not labor it's love
[48:12] amen so we have to come and approach it
[48:15] will those things produce it yes my
[48:17] brother and sister Faith will produce
[48:21] works period but works will never get
[48:25] you in favor with
[48:30] God
[48:31] so look at
[48:35] this I get myself lost forgive me we see
[48:39] here now Isaiah's prophecy in 14 and 12
[48:43] and uh then uh brother Brown makes this
[48:46] connection and says now this directly
[48:48] connects to Revelation 17 and 18 where
[48:51] the scripture is there I should have had
[48:53] that put up and and just put it on the
[48:55] screen but revelation 17 and8 is talking
[48:58] about Babylon and the fall of Babylon
[49:01] and you'll find that the wording there
[49:03] is so parallel it just puts it together
[49:06] brother brand makes this connection and
[49:08] says now Isaiah ties directly with
[49:11] revelation of what is happening and what
[49:14] will be there and so this this tying
[49:17] together and because I don't want to
[49:18] draw this out real long this morning but
[49:22] you know uh uh this ties so beautifully
[49:25] a little inspiration come from our
[49:26] brother Danny there it size together so
[49:28] perfectly with Cain and Abel amen
[49:31] they're right there Abel by Revelation
[49:33] amen now we're talking about an eternal
[49:38] language Cain is sitting there saying
[49:41] I'm going to build a bigger and better
[49:43] church it's going to be the Beauty and
[49:46] the size of my church that is going to
[49:49] make the difference now look how God
[49:52] comes down speaks to Cain and says you
[49:55] know what if you just I'm going to put
[49:56] it in this straight language if you just
[49:59] repent and come to the word you'll have
[50:01] Redemption too Cain sat there clearly
[50:05] premeditated rejected the word he did
[50:09] not want Redemption he did not want to
[50:12] be sitting under the headship of the
[50:14] Holy Spirit he wanted to make the
[50:16] decision he wanted to build it the way
[50:18] he wanted to worship he wanted the
[50:20] preaching like he wanted the preaching
[50:22] he wanted the church structure like he
[50:24] wanted the church structure and he said
[50:26] I don't don't need a holy spirit in my
[50:28] life I don't need a word to guide me I
[50:31] can do it
[50:34] myself true and brother Danny brought
[50:36] that so beautifully Cain says am I You
[50:39] My Brother's Keeper we are our Brother's
[50:44] Keeper amen we need to stand shoulder
[50:47] toosh shoulder we need to hold our
[50:50] Shield together and create a solid wall
[50:53] of faith not a little faith here not a
[50:55] little faith there there hold your
[50:57] Shield up amen hold this up my brother
[51:00] and sister and stand together word to
[51:03] word word to word as we the word made
[51:06] flesh in this day are standing together
[51:10] I need your prayers and I'm going to be
[51:12] bold enough to say you need my prayers
[51:15] because it's not about lifting this man
[51:17] up it's not about putting this person up
[51:20] it's about us lifting one another up by
[51:23] the word into Heavenly places lifting
[51:26] one another up by the word in the spirit
[51:29] I might be weak and my phone dings
[51:31] brother Paul praying for you in my heart
[51:34] there's something in my heart oh thank
[51:37] you do you know what I'm
[51:40] saying amen we need one
[51:43] another amen
[51:45] hallelujah so it's there Cain takes a
[51:50] position I have more
[51:53] Revelation than Abel
[51:56] imagine how it must have grad on
[52:00] Cain why did you kill a lamb
[52:05] Abel
[52:06] something spoke to
[52:10] me and said it's about the
[52:13] blood what are you talking
[52:17] about what are you talking
[52:21] about well my brother
[52:24] Cain why would god require
[52:28] this Pelt this hide of a lamb for
[52:35] covering why didn't he take a watermelon
[52:39] Leaf a palm
[52:41] frond why a
[52:44] lamb and it wasn't the lamb because the
[52:47] body of the Lamb was done away with the
[52:50] body of the Lamb are you with me the
[52:52] body of the Lamb was put aside my
[52:54] brother and sister but that covering and
[52:57] the blood was the covering they stood
[53:00] there in and he would have been there
[53:02] and saw all of this taking place them in
[53:05] the garden mom and dad what happened we
[53:07] don't want to talk about
[53:09] it the whole time Cain is over there
[53:12] saying you know what look how
[53:15] beautiful look how beautiful all this is
[53:19] they're outside of Eden but still Beauty
[53:23] in its original
[53:25] form the thistle was just starting to
[53:28] grow amen all of these prickly and
[53:32] Scratchy and are just starting to
[53:37] grow and he said you
[53:40] know he just brought a lamb I'm going to
[53:44] fill the altar clear
[53:47] full I'm going to fill it all
[53:50] up then you can choose I like this part
[53:54] of the altar a little better
[53:56] I like this part A little better I want
[54:00] this I like this and everyone started to
[54:05] view it in their own eyes now let's have
[54:08] a little rubber on the road here have
[54:10] you ever
[54:12] experienced I don't want to say that you
[54:14] have because that's not really fair for
[54:16] me to judge you but you ever experienced
[54:19] a time when you were right in your own
[54:21] eyes only to find out you're not right
[54:27] yes you realize a spiritual relationship
[54:30] with God that we are right in our own
[54:33] eyes but not
[54:35] right we could live a whole life out we
[54:38] could live a a a a life that people
[54:40] would glorify and give respect and honor
[54:42] to and it still not be right but it
[54:46] looked right and It produced good
[54:49] results no doubt
[54:51] Cain was
[54:53] good to his family
[54:57] but he led him down a road of
[54:59] chaos he led him down a road that kept
[55:03] them separated from
[55:05] God and ultimately he had to answer for
[55:08] Abel's
[55:09] blood that's nothing we want my brother
[55:12] and sister see so we see how this
[55:15] clearly ties with Cain and Abel Beauty
[55:18] versus blood what will we choose amen I
[55:22] I don't want to choose Beauty my brother
[55:23] and sister the blood is messy but the
[55:26] blood is where the cleansing and the
[55:29] life is amen hallelujah we see that
[55:33] natural every day uh sister April you
[55:35] know in Sharing uh things you know in
[55:38] her trips uh people they got blood
[55:41] flowing in them just like you do but if
[55:44] that is not cleansed it will kill them
[55:48] and we can say we have the blood today
[55:50] my brother and sister but if it's not a
[55:51] cleansing blood if it's not a healthy
[55:53] blood you know we were over there uh and
[55:56] in Israel and remember there was that
[55:58] place I don't think we ultimately went
[56:00] in for a few dollars you can go in and
[56:02] see what they claim as the original
[56:04] blood of Jesus Christ in a
[56:06] vial really along with how many
[56:11] spikes you see but people are walking we
[56:14] watched them we stood there uh we well
[56:18] where was we that wasn't Israel that was
[56:19] Belgium I'm sorry no wonder you look
[56:21] confused amen it was Belgium when we
[56:23] were walking there in that deal and
[56:25] here's this deal walk into the deal you
[56:26] had to give a little
[56:28] donation the buildings were almost the
[56:30] same that's what confused me just and
[56:32] and you had to give a little donation to
[56:34] go in and see this glass
[56:36] vial that they claimed was the blood of
[56:40] Jesus
[56:44] Christ can I sell you a
[56:48] spike would the spike save
[56:51] you if that was the literal blood of
[56:54] Jesus Christ which we know it wouldn't
[56:56] be because it would have spoiled and
[57:01] rotted because it wasn't in that
[57:05] context you know I I'm
[57:08] saved come on I'm going to be really
[57:09] blunt to you I hope this don't offend
[57:11] anybody but I had a man tell me well I
[57:13] tell you what we got a chair from
[57:14] Brother bram's house and it's in our
[57:16] house praise
[57:24] God is the chair going to save you
[57:32] sir the spirit of nimrod
[57:40] lives but the spirit of our Lord Jesus
[57:43] Christ lives
[57:45] also greater power amen greater things
[57:49] than these will you do greater things
[57:52] the Fulfillment of the manifestation of
[57:55] the word will do greater things and as
[57:58] the darkness settles in the light shines
[58:00] for you and I brighter than any ever age
[58:04] that's ever been the light is shining we
[58:07] are not going to fall under the darkness
[58:09] of Le oysa we were called to walk in
[58:12] that light we were called to accept the
[58:14] blood of Jesus Christ and the cleansing
[58:16] power of it we were called to hear the
[58:18] voice but it's not nimrod's voice we
[58:21] were called to works but it's not
[58:23] nimrod's works it's the word of God
[58:26] alive in you and I that's what the work
[58:29] is that's the word that's the blood
[58:31] that's the life taking place today is
[58:34] the word in you
[58:37] hallelujah
[58:39] amen hallelujah Beauty versus blood it
[58:42] was confusion then Bible is confusion it
[58:46] was confusion then it's confusion now
[58:49] that's why this word of God people come
[58:51] with New Revelations that are so
[58:53] confusing so far out on the limb my
[58:55] brother and sister that's not the Holy
[58:57] Spirit he didn't come to confuse you and
[58:59] I he come to give us a sound mind and
[59:02] peace in our souls and confidence in who
[59:05] we are in Jesus Christ not to bring a
[59:08] confusion where we say well that
[59:10] Revelation is just so far over my head
[59:12] if I could tell you how many times I
[59:14] wish I could tell you how many times
[59:16] that's been spoken to me well that
[59:18] Revelation was so far over my head but
[59:21] but I believe
[59:22] it you believe what
[59:26] my brother and sister that's not what
[59:28] God said he didn't come to wow
[59:30] you he come to redeem you and for you to
[59:34] truly have Redemption you must know what
[59:37] is redeeming you it's not a mystery oh
[59:41] this might not go overr right but it's
[59:43] not a mystery that's redeeming you when
[59:45] he come and said in this age forgive me
[59:48] for just using my own words he said I'll
[59:50] come in this age and all of the mystery
[59:54] of Jesus Christ will be be revealed
[59:57] because he knew that you would need to
[1:00:00] know who you were it's not about Jesus
[1:00:03] proving who he is it's about you knowing
[1:00:05] who you are and he said I'm going to
[1:00:07] make it so clear and so plain and and
[1:00:10] just hold that because in a minute I I'm
[1:00:12] going to tie it together I promise I
[1:00:15] mean a farmer minute or maybe worse yet
[1:00:18] a preacher
[1:00:20] minute
[1:00:21] amen How Great Is Our God amen amen
[1:00:26] now I I hope I'm not trying to bring
[1:00:29] kind of a deal but would you sing this
[1:00:32] song How Great Is Our
[1:00:34] God H some people don't like
[1:00:39] it sister Jerry comes in this
[1:00:42] morning why are you listening to that
[1:00:45] Paul she didn't understand the point I
[1:00:47] was searching
[1:00:48] for we could sit here stop the service
[1:00:51] right now we could sing the song from
[1:00:53] the depths of our heart How great is our
[1:00:55] God we would know who we were talking
[1:00:57] about but my brother and sister you go
[1:01:00] right out here in the churches of Babel
[1:01:02] and they are there I'm not even a waste
[1:01:05] of time describing it you're there you
[1:01:07] can't tell if it's a man or a woman you
[1:01:09] can't tell or what they're covered up
[1:01:11] with paint they're covered up with
[1:01:12] tattoos amen they're this way and
[1:01:14] they're that way and they're singing How
[1:01:16] Great Is Our God I want to know what God
[1:01:18] they're talking about amen they're not
[1:01:21] talking about Jesus Christ his word does
[1:01:24] not produce that he'll save them from
[1:01:26] that sir we won't hold tattoos against
[1:01:29] anybody we won't hold piercings against
[1:01:31] anybody but if you can't find
[1:01:34] Deliverance it's probably not
[1:01:37] God and they're
[1:01:39] singing I think they said there was
[1:01:41] 74,000 people in that
[1:01:46] Coliseum How Great Is Our God I have no
[1:01:51] problem with I hope this doesn't offend
[1:01:53] anybody I have no problem with people
[1:01:55] jumping
[1:01:56] twirling doing all this I just want to
[1:01:59] know if that's the Holy Spirit or
[1:02:02] another
[1:02:03] spirit amen the Holy Spirit proves
[1:02:07] itself amen we don't have to sit back
[1:02:09] and say now were they anointed of the
[1:02:11] Holy Spirit or was
[1:02:13] that well another little video I looked
[1:02:17] at the guy ran down the aisle I'm not
[1:02:19] going to try and imitate it because I'd
[1:02:20] probably hit my head off a Pew and you'd
[1:02:22] have to pack me up but run down the
[1:02:24] aisle w
[1:02:26] roll over and start throwing like a
[1:02:28] chicken and they all said that's the
[1:02:31] Holy
[1:02:33] Spirit that's
[1:02:35] Nimrod that's Nimrod my brother and
[1:02:37] sister God doesn't make light of his
[1:02:40] presence he doesn't make light of his
[1:02:42] word it's not a game it's not something
[1:02:44] where we're all going to step out of the
[1:02:46] aisles and Grace Tabernacle and film
[1:02:49] brother Paul as he's on his hands and
[1:02:51] knees howling like a dog and then
[1:02:53] crowing like a chicken and everybody
[1:02:54] like isn't this neat the holy spirit's
[1:02:57] come Nimrod has come in the church yes
[1:03:03] all is everybody okay nobody's too Shell
[1:03:06] Shocked I can't crow like a chicken so I
[1:03:09] won't even
[1:03:10] try but crowing like a chicken my
[1:03:12] brother sister is no evidence of
[1:03:13] anything other than you can crow like a
[1:03:15] chicken amen howling like a dog is no
[1:03:18] evidence other than you can howl like a
[1:03:20] dog amen getting on your hands and knees
[1:03:24] and rocking back and forth and growling
[1:03:26] is no more evidence that God is present
[1:03:28] in the building than someone who can
[1:03:30] rock on their hands and knees and growl
[1:03:31] like a dog amen but Nimrod brought that
[1:03:35] spirit in the beginning because he knew
[1:03:38] if I can't get into the sides of the of
[1:03:42] the Tabernacle of the host of God if I
[1:03:44] can't get there then I'll think I'll
[1:03:46] bring the people to think they're
[1:03:51] there I was going to say something a
[1:03:53] little stronger if you wonder why I
[1:03:54] stumbled around there but I I think I'll
[1:03:56] just settle on that little softer
[1:03:58] approach
[1:04:02] amen How Great Is Our
[1:04:06] God can be sung by
[1:04:10] everyone but that doesn't mean it's the
[1:04:12] same God Amen just because they mouth
[1:04:16] those words doesn't mean that Christ is
[1:04:18] in that vessel I hope I'm not too hard
[1:04:21] this morning am I this started out to be
[1:04:23] a happy sermon the more I studied it
[1:04:25] it's like I just drifted off to one
[1:04:27] side not
[1:04:30] really now look you and I don't speak
[1:04:33] every language right now there's many
[1:04:35] amongst us I I I'm a little jealous I'm
[1:04:38] a little envious there's those amongst
[1:04:39] us that speak multiple languages I
[1:04:42] haven't even mastered English yet but
[1:04:43] when I master English I'm moving on to
[1:04:45] another language amen so so you look at
[1:04:49] this we don't speak every language but
[1:04:52] Revelation comes in every
[1:04:58] language and you say why would you even
[1:05:00] bother to speak on that brother Paul
[1:05:02] because it hasn't been that long in the
[1:05:03] past where a man told
[1:05:06] me well people from this certain place
[1:05:09] don't have much
[1:05:10] Revelation they don't speak English and
[1:05:13] the prophet came speaking English so
[1:05:15] therefore they can't have the same
[1:05:16] Revelation that we have and I'm thinking
[1:05:20] I'm questioning your
[1:05:22] Revelation that sounds harsh don't it I
[1:05:24] don't mean to make life of that but for
[1:05:26] them to say that when the word says
[1:05:28] every nation Kindred tongue I never seen
[1:05:31] where God put the exclusion amen oh
[1:05:34] those of you pardon me we got enough
[1:05:36] here I'll get in trouble but those of
[1:05:37] you in Eastern Europe you cannot have
[1:05:39] the same revelation we have the message
[1:05:42] came to us
[1:05:44] first I can just see somebody coming
[1:05:47] along but the first shall be
[1:05:51] last see we got no position amen we
[1:05:55] we've been given Revelation comes in
[1:05:57] every language and I want to know you
[1:05:59] feel free to speak out what's the
[1:06:01] language of the holy
[1:06:03] spirit hly
[1:06:06] Spirit word the word sister Carrie you
[1:06:10] get a star Hallelujah the language of
[1:06:13] the holy spirit is the word and so when
[1:06:17] someone comes and says I've got a
[1:06:18] revelation we don't listen to their
[1:06:20] voice we take it back to God's voice
[1:06:23] which is the word and if it don't line
[1:06:25] up we just have to look at them politely
[1:06:27] say you got a choice repent or possibly
[1:06:29] attend another
[1:06:33] church we don't have to go and say oh oh
[1:06:37] oh this he's got a word from the
[1:06:40] Lord and fact I'm sorry to say this I've
[1:06:43] become a little bit cynical when people
[1:06:44] say well praise God I've got a word from
[1:06:46] the
[1:06:48] Lord okay why don't you go ahead and
[1:06:50] tell
[1:06:52] us and while you're doing I'm going to
[1:06:56] what brother B say was the urum Thum of
[1:06:59] our
[1:07:01] dayly where's the Holy Spirit
[1:07:03] reside in the
[1:07:06] word so you just go ahead and give me
[1:07:08] your dream give me your word and we'll
[1:07:11] just judge it right
[1:07:13] here but we're too nice you know what
[1:07:16] our problem is Saints we're too nice
[1:07:19] they got a word from the Lord that's
[1:07:21] nowhere in the word won't fit and we
[1:07:24] just we just want to to be nice it's our
[1:07:26] brother we just leave it be and Nimrod
[1:07:29] says I
[1:07:31] mean if they swallowed that one have I
[1:07:34] got another one for
[1:07:35] them you wonder how people started out
[1:07:38] in the word end up somewhere else
[1:07:41] because they refused either from some
[1:07:44] ill-gotten idea of of being nice what is
[1:07:47] kind can I ask you a question what is
[1:07:50] kind we are a group of Believers here
[1:07:52] this morning what is kind here inside
[1:07:54] this building this
[1:07:56] morning amen we're not kind when we let
[1:07:59] our brother and sister slide off the
[1:08:01] word we're not kind when we let evil
[1:08:03] spirits come in the door and sit down
[1:08:06] with us that's not love that's not
[1:08:08] kindness we are kind when we are bold
[1:08:11] enough to say brother that doesn't fit
[1:08:13] the
[1:08:14] word and I'm asking you as your friend
[1:08:17] as your brother come back to the word
[1:08:19] not back to what you thought was God in
[1:08:21] the middle of the night amen amen
[1:08:26] I I hope I'm not out of line here to you
[1:08:28] this morning amen do you see my brother
[1:08:31] and
[1:08:32] sister the language of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:35] there's only one language if it's the
[1:08:37] Holy
[1:08:38] Spirit you know it's
[1:08:40] interesting I read an account of where
[1:08:42] in one church service two people got up
[1:08:44] spoke in tongues and it was interpreted
[1:08:47] and they come in direct conflict with
[1:08:50] each
[1:08:51] other which one we going to believe
[1:08:55] that brother snubbed me at the last
[1:08:57] fellowship and this brother bought me
[1:09:00] dinner no that that's not a good one no
[1:09:04] sir we're mature enough we're going to
[1:09:06] pick up our Bible and it might possibly
[1:09:09] be neither one of them's right right
[1:09:13] amen because brother Bram taught us you
[1:09:15] don't bring those things you don't
[1:09:16] disrupt the preaching of the word h for
[1:09:19] those things so when people rise up out
[1:09:21] of the deal and they start they can be
[1:09:24] wrong just simply because they didn't
[1:09:26] wait on the Lord they felt I've got to
[1:09:29] speak this word right now but God
[1:09:37] says he doesn't have a different voice
[1:09:40] in a different
[1:09:42] place I don't think it's time or place
[1:09:45] to really focus on this but I'll just
[1:09:47] give you the briefest glimpse of what it
[1:09:49] is when people rise to a level they
[1:09:52] believe they're higher than the word
[1:09:55] it's a time in South
[1:09:57] Africa and you'll see this
[1:10:00] attitude of a man calling out the
[1:10:04] people the holy spirit is not in
[1:10:08] America he's left the holy spirit's not
[1:10:12] in South America he's
[1:10:14] left the holy spirit is not in Asia and
[1:10:18] he went right down all the
[1:10:20] continents the man was from Zimbabwe and
[1:10:23] pardon my brothers and sisters but no no
[1:10:26] reflection to to Africa but that spirit
[1:10:30] that was on him he just cut everything
[1:10:33] right down they don't have it they don't
[1:10:35] have it they don't have it they don't
[1:10:37] have it they don't have it only we have
[1:10:42] it now how much research would it take
[1:10:44] in your
[1:10:46] Bible to see if that lined
[1:10:49] up but I saw 5,000 people jump to their
[1:10:53] feet scream and stom p and March around
[1:10:56] in circles utter
[1:10:59] chaos and it
[1:11:01] was because God didn't call for one man
[1:11:06] to replace Jesus
[1:11:08] Christ
[1:11:10] amen anyone who wants to replace him you
[1:11:13] can tell the spirit of nimrod has come
[1:11:15] to that dling place is that straight
[1:11:17] enough I think that time is we got to
[1:11:19] come to the place that we quit tiptoeing
[1:11:22] around some of these spirits that don't
[1:11:23] line up with the word you know they're
[1:11:26] not on the word but they believe the
[1:11:27] message for 50 years that is what they
[1:11:29] call what do they call that uh
[1:11:33] oxymoron in some cases we can simply cut
[1:11:36] the oxy off of
[1:11:41] it you see but we accept it we don't
[1:11:43] want to hurt anybody's feelings well
[1:11:45] I'll tell you what my brother and sister
[1:11:46] yes God might call that man to
[1:11:49] repentance but that doesn't mean that
[1:11:51] you have to cater to that Spirit till
[1:11:53] God calls him to repent
[1:11:55] repentance
[1:11:57] amen
[1:12:00] hallelujah oh I'll tell you what I think
[1:12:04] the Lord understands my circumstance so
[1:12:06] he's going to alter his word for me
[1:12:10] because of my current
[1:12:13] circumstance
[1:12:15] no
[1:12:20] sir but maybe the Lord really cares
[1:12:23] about these people so much he's going to
[1:12:24] compromise the word for them
[1:12:29] no I'll tell you what right now the
[1:12:31] Bride of Jesus Christ do not need a
[1:12:34] compromise we weren't called to
[1:12:36] compromise in fact this bride has one
[1:12:39] attribute that makes her separated from
[1:12:41] the rest of the world and that is the
[1:12:42] attribute just give it to me straight I
[1:12:45] just want the truth amen whether the
[1:12:48] minister is a quiet minister or he's a
[1:12:50] jump up in the air and click his heels
[1:12:52] Minister I know the truth when I hear
[1:12:55] the truth and I'm not going to not
[1:12:57] receive it because this brother Stomps
[1:13:00] and shouts and slobbers and this brother
[1:13:02] he's too quiet for me oh you say brother
[1:13:04] Paul what what no I hear these things I
[1:13:08] just couldn't get anything out of the
[1:13:09] service cuz that brother just just was
[1:13:12] well I mean he leaped six feet in the
[1:13:14] air off the off the platform I I just
[1:13:16] couldn't receive that did he tell you
[1:13:22] truth that other brother was way too
[1:13:24] timid
[1:13:25] I'm really looking for someone like
[1:13:28] Paul I need somebody like the Apostle
[1:13:31] Paul somebody that's just bold I can't
[1:13:33] receive it from a timid person like
[1:13:37] Timothy you wouldn't receive Timothy's
[1:13:42] message
[1:13:45] H
[1:13:47] wow
[1:13:49] no my
[1:13:52] four no more
[1:13:55] right well don't worry about it you
[1:13:57] won't be
[1:14:02] there so in the day we're
[1:14:06] living the prophet of God uses speaks
[1:14:10] very much about
[1:14:12] language and he also brings it in
[1:14:14] extended
[1:14:16] context to tell us that if we're going
[1:14:18] to receive it we have to confess it so
[1:14:21] we've got to put what we believe into
[1:14:23] language we've got to come to the place
[1:14:25] that our
[1:14:27] voice it doesn't matter what language as
[1:14:30] we call it but our voice must speak if
[1:14:34] we're going to receive it that's right
[1:14:37] so we come to this
[1:14:39] place the language of the Bride the
[1:14:42] redeemed do you guys know her have you
[1:14:45] met her amen amen hallelujah
[1:14:55] I'm cutting out stuff that's why
[1:14:57] mentally going yeah ch
[1:15:00] ch brother Brown standing before us
[1:15:03] declaring to
[1:15:07] us I
[1:15:09] preached what Paul
[1:15:12] preached feel free to speak out what was
[1:15:14] the significance of that did Paul need
[1:15:18] to defend
[1:15:21] himself no
[1:15:27] what was he
[1:15:30] doing Jesus Christ the same
[1:15:33] yesterday today
[1:15:36] forever the same
[1:15:39] language the same word the same life and
[1:15:43] he was just declaring I'm standing here
[1:15:46] today not in defense people have said
[1:15:48] well he was trying to defend what he
[1:15:50] spoke no they totally missed it they had
[1:15:51] no Revelation they were over here
[1:15:53] thinking nimrods thoughts it wasn't
[1:15:56] nothing about that he was making a
[1:15:58] declaration that this is the fulfilling
[1:16:01] of today we have seen yesterday yes sir
[1:16:06] amen and we know what the word has for
[1:16:08] the future but there has to be an
[1:16:11] expression of the word it must come in a
[1:16:13] language and the language my brother and
[1:16:15] sister God chose to bring it in this day
[1:16:17] I I hope you don't mind me saying this
[1:16:19] it wasn't brother brandom's voice amen
[1:16:22] that's the man he chose to use but the
[1:16:25] voice was the
[1:16:26] word the voice was the word and you say
[1:16:29] but brother Paul I don't know if your
[1:16:31] example you're fixing to give fits right
[1:16:33] but my brother and sister as Cain and
[1:16:35] Abel are standing there yes your brother
[1:16:39] his blood is crying from the
[1:16:43] earth he's dead but the blood still had
[1:16:46] a voice amen our lord Jesus gave his
[1:16:50] life his blood for you and I and that
[1:16:53] blood is still still crying today it is
[1:16:56] still calling out to us today I've
[1:16:59] redeemed you you are sinless you are my
[1:17:02] perfect little Bride come live in the
[1:17:05] glory I have to give to you come in the
[1:17:08] life I have given to you come in the
[1:17:11] power I have given you that blood is
[1:17:13] still crying out amen we can preach
[1:17:16] about oh we received this and we got
[1:17:18] that and I got this Revelation is the
[1:17:20] blood crying out your name today I say
[1:17:23] thank you Lord
[1:17:25] thank you Lord it come in word form
[1:17:28] today amen so you know what happens by
[1:17:32] God's grace we get a revelation we get
[1:17:34] to check every other voice against the
[1:17:38] original that's
[1:17:41] right you know science says brother
[1:17:43] Brown says it that our voice is still
[1:17:46] floating out
[1:17:47] here I'm glad God wipes some things
[1:17:51] away cuz this voice right here it's
[1:17:55] spoken things I would never want to hear
[1:17:59] repeated but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:18:01] is spoken and that same Jesus our Jesus
[1:18:06] is here today speaking amen now I want
[1:18:09] to just ask you a question we got we
[1:18:11] need to close I want to ask you a
[1:18:13] question you're washing the
[1:18:15] dishes anybody here never washed a
[1:18:19] dish okay youngsters are forgiven you
[1:18:23] older people
[1:18:25] starting at Donna's
[1:18:27] age
[1:18:30] older you're washing the dishes you're
[1:18:33] mowing the lawn you're driving down the
[1:18:38] road and a voice
[1:18:41] speaks do you know what I'm talking
[1:18:47] about as a Believer can you trust that
[1:18:49] voice yes
[1:18:52] sir the reason is is because the word is
[1:18:55] in you and that voice is not speaking to
[1:18:58] this
[1:18:59] flesh that voice is speaking to the
[1:19:03] Inner
[1:19:04] Man and the inner man amen by saying
[1:19:08] amen I believe that is what changes the
[1:19:12] flesh Nimrod wants to start on the
[1:19:15] outside and work his way in our Lord
[1:19:19] Jesus Christ wants to start on the
[1:19:21] inside and work his way out and amen
[1:19:25] that's the difference that's right
[1:19:26] that's the difference my brother I tell
[1:19:29] you it's just incredible I've got so
[1:19:31] many things I could say right now but I
[1:19:33] don't want to keep you too long amen now
[1:19:37] look at this I do want to I do want to
[1:19:39] really focus on this for just a
[1:19:41] minute now I'm not judging anybody if
[1:19:44] you didn't bring a Bible today but just
[1:19:46] in context everybody has a Bible right
[1:19:49] should be no reason why anybody in this
[1:19:51] church does not have a Bible amen and
[1:19:54] I'd really courage it bring it to church
[1:19:56] amen so everyone has a Bible but not
[1:20:00] every Bible speaks the same language to
[1:20:03] everyone right that's
[1:20:10] right listening to a little video
[1:20:15] clip this woman won't name her she's
[1:20:19] like I know the Bible says I shouldn't
[1:20:21] preach but the Lord and I were having a
[1:20:24] conversation one day and he said for you
[1:20:27] I make this
[1:20:30] exemption and a whole church of people
[1:20:32] Rose to their feet I'm not exaggerating
[1:20:35] oh praise God God told her she can do
[1:20:40] it no
[1:20:43] Nimrod told her she could do it sir and
[1:20:47] I'm sorry it sounds judgmental but I'm
[1:20:48] going to say it they don't know the
[1:20:50] difference between our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:53] and nimrod
[1:20:55] right they cannot tell the
[1:20:58] difference what kind of spiritual
[1:21:00] discernment is that I'm not judging them
[1:21:04] don't misunderstand me I want to see
[1:21:06] them saved but until they can come to
[1:21:08] the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ which
[1:21:11] is the
[1:21:13] word then nimrod's just got a lot of
[1:21:16] people building bricks and building a
[1:21:19] giant Tower we can make it there on our
[1:21:23] own
[1:21:25] it shocks me when things that if they
[1:21:28] would pick their Bible up okay I'm
[1:21:30] talking to us
[1:21:32] too just pick your Bible up you would
[1:21:34] see what you're doing is not
[1:21:37] right but we ignore
[1:21:40] it because God spoke to
[1:21:43] us he did it's right here find the page
[1:21:48] find the paragraph the
[1:21:50] verse if it doesn't go through this
[1:21:53] filter it shouldn't go through your
[1:21:56] filter if that's a little straight
[1:21:58] forgive me but it's the truth amen so
[1:22:02] it's not the same language amen what
[1:22:05] brother Danny give to us in Camp those
[1:22:06] of you weren't Camp uh you wouldn't kind
[1:22:08] of know but what brother Danny lay out
[1:22:10] in Camp you won't know because you don't
[1:22:12] know what I'm thinking I don't know what
[1:22:13] I'm thinking amen but he was speaking
[1:22:16] about
[1:22:18] Cain God gave the option of
[1:22:23] redemption to
[1:22:25] Cain gave it right there if you'll just
[1:22:29] repent and believe Cain I'd redeem you
[1:22:35] the Serpent's Seed had an
[1:22:39] opportunity for
[1:22:41] Redemption now you tell me God's not
[1:22:43] full of grace and mercy amen he offered
[1:22:46] it right there to Cain and said if you
[1:22:47] would just
[1:22:49] come but you see in his heart he
[1:22:51] couldn't there's no way you know why
[1:22:54] because it was already another language
[1:22:56] another voice had filled that space up
[1:23:00] and because of that he was not
[1:23:03] able imagine how different the story
[1:23:06] would be if Cain had just Fallen to his
[1:23:08] knees and said forgive
[1:23:11] me how different that and those of you
[1:23:14] who think you've sinned too much for God
[1:23:16] to redeem you here is an absolute son of
[1:23:20] predition the seed of The Serpent and
[1:23:23] God offered him eternal ET life now you
[1:23:26] think of whatever mistake you made in
[1:23:28] this life would keep you from receiving
[1:23:30] the word of God that's a lie of the
[1:23:32] devil because God offered it right there
[1:23:35] to the very seed of the serpent
[1:23:39] Redemption and we are Sons and Daughters
[1:23:41] of God called of him in his mind before
[1:23:44] the foundation of the world don't let
[1:23:46] some devil speak some language to you to
[1:23:48] cause you to hold back from receiving
[1:23:50] forgiveness Redemption washing of the
[1:23:53] water of the word that that's a lie that
[1:23:55] came right from the pit of Hell
[1:23:58] hallelujah
[1:23:59] hallelujah you know it was another voice
[1:24:01] that captivated
[1:24:03] him I I'm just bouncing over some of
[1:24:05] these notes sorry I just have more notes
[1:24:07] than we have time Amen brother Chris
[1:24:09] come and preach the rest of that sermon
[1:24:10] about time amen time don't exist in
[1:24:14] God's realm and we're right now just
[1:24:15] going to claim we're in God's
[1:24:17] realm but look at this my brother and
[1:24:20] sister how God would work in such a
[1:24:22] fashion that he would come down and and
[1:24:24] just speak to this and we see this
[1:24:27] manifested in Cain's life but it's
[1:24:30] offered to you and I as an example to
[1:24:33] recognize there is nothing going to keep
[1:24:35] you from the presence of God nothing
[1:24:38] going to keep you from standing on the
[1:24:40] sea of Crystal Before the Throne of
[1:24:42] almighty God and worshiping the devil
[1:24:45] throws a scarecrow throws a scarecrow
[1:24:47] throws this throws on Amen as it would
[1:24:50] be puts a flat tire on your spiritual
[1:24:53] car I'll tell you what we should say
[1:24:56] well my spiritual car has got a flat
[1:24:57] tire I'm going to get out and walk if
[1:25:00] that's what it takes I'm not going to
[1:25:01] sit here by the road of life and just
[1:25:03] say look what Misfortune give me look at
[1:25:06] circumstance gave me I couldn't serve
[1:25:08] God because I did this I can't serve God
[1:25:11] because of that I can introduce you to a
[1:25:13] brother back East that murdered a man
[1:25:15] and God come to him in prison am man in
[1:25:18] a real natural real life prison and told
[1:25:21] him very clearly you're my son you're
[1:25:24] redeemed rise up and take the promise
[1:25:27] and he rose up and took the promise and
[1:25:30] it wasn't long after that they paroled
[1:25:31] him supposed to be
[1:25:33] life but God had given him life and God
[1:25:36] said I'm going to bring you to the place
[1:25:37] I can feed that life and it's not in the
[1:25:40] prison it's going to be in the house of
[1:25:41] God hallelujah he believed it it is a
[1:25:45] little bit humorous how the brothers
[1:25:47] said you know the first few years after
[1:25:49] he's out of prison he'd hear a knock on
[1:25:51] his door and the devil had come in
[1:25:54] anoint his mind they're coming to saying
[1:25:56] that's was a mistake come with
[1:25:58] us but he finally realized spiritual
[1:26:02] natural I'm not in prison any
[1:26:05] longer amen there's no devil in hell
[1:26:08] going to come and knock on the door and
[1:26:10] say look hug that was a little mistake
[1:26:12] there you're still lost no my brother
[1:26:15] and sister it's about time for us to
[1:26:16] realize there's two voices in the church
[1:26:19] and you get to see Nimrod in action you
[1:26:21] get to see Nimrod expressing himself and
[1:26:23] Nim

[1:26:29] good with his words he was Stronger he
[1:26:32] was better looking had

[1:26:46] shouldn't be proud of those things but
[1:26:49] I'm telling you God doesn't want our
[1:26:50] personality he doesn't want our
[1:26:51] education he doesn't want how polished
[1:26:53] we are are he wants us to give up and
[1:26:56] let him have his way in our life he
[1:26:58] wants us to stand up and say Lord you

[1:27:40] undertone to what they're saying some
[1:27:43] are
[1:27:44] believing in general Jesus got to prove
[1:27:47] a point to them doesn't got to but I
[1:27:48] mean he's intends to prove a
[1:27:50] point and

[1:27:57] I'd be a little long but you can look it
[1:28:00] up in your Bibles go back it says father
[1:28:02] glorify thy name then came there a voice

[1:29:10] outsider you're now of the House of
[1:29:13] David amen you might be the Wild Olive
[1:29:16] Branch but I didn't care there I'll take

[1:29:33] you study a little too much uh preachers
[1:29:36] excuse you know is what that is the
[1:29:38] people therefore that stood by and heard
[1:29:40] it said that it
[1:29:42] thundered oh my maybe this is the
[1:29:44] foundation of the Thunders
[1:29:48] Doctrine I asked that up at camp but do
[1:29:50] we believe the Thunders yes I believe
[1:29:53] them with every ounce is that's within
[1:29:54] me every time God opens his voice or
[1:29:57] speaks his voice to us amen it shakes
[1:30:00] Heaven and Earth you say well I I didn't
[1:30:02] really see anything well you just wait
[1:30:04] till the other side when maybe they'll
[1:30:06] be kind enough to say come in sit down
[1:30:09] here in your personal
[1:30:11] viewing and you'll see hordes of demons
[1:30:14] trying to settle down upon
[1:30:17] you and the voice of our
[1:30:19] beloved speaking and the demons cringing
[1:30:28] and the Lord
[1:30:29] said speak in my name amen you know what
[1:30:33] that means don't
[1:30:35] you let your voice have the same
[1:30:38] Authority as my voice okay homework who
[1:30:43] of you have confidence to speak like
[1:30:46] that I'm not shaming nobody but that's

[1:32:26] middle of the
[1:32:27] table and then they joined hands and
[1:32:29] started
[1:32:31] praying and in the
[1:32:32] middle in the middle of that prayer

[1:37:34] amen
[1:37:35] hallelujah amen let's let it not be our
[1:37:38] own
[1:37:39] conclusion let's come to a
[1:37:42] place morning noon and night speak my
[1:37:44] Lord
[1:37:46] speak and I'll be quick to answer thee
[1:37:50] Hallelujah
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:37:58] can I just throw one more thing at
[1:38:00] [Music]
[1:38:03] you you know the upper room wasn't so
[1:38:06] incredible because they spoke in
[1:38:11] tongues the upper room was an incredible
[1:38:14] experience because every man and woman
[1:38:18] that was there in that presence
[1:38:22] recognized who they
[1:38:25] were that's what made the
[1:38:27] difference you can't receive the baptism
[1:38:30] of the Holy
[1:38:31] Ghost and live in that presence and not
[1:38:34] know who you
[1:38:36] are but when they were there in the
[1:38:38] presence of God settled down and moved
[1:38:41] through that room if they hadn't already
[1:38:44] experienced it each one of them
[1:38:47] realized this is the words of life and I
[1:38:51] have life and they receive that you say
[1:38:56] brother Paul why did you bring that up
[1:38:58] because too many people think because
[1:39:00] they had a upper room type
[1:39:06] experience jumped out of my seat ran all
[1:39:09] the way around the church
[1:39:11] screaming I've got
[1:39:14] it 30 days later I just feel defeated I
[1:39:19] I don't know if I'm
[1:39:20] saved that's not the result of an upper
[1:39:24] room
[1:39:25] experience that's the result well I hope
[1:39:28] you like my punchline of you forgetting
[1:39:31] who you
[1:39:33] are and every one of those people that
[1:39:36] was there the Tower of Babel at some
[1:39:39] point gave up their individual
[1:39:43] walk to be part of a false movement
[1:39:51] [Music]
[1:39:54] do you know God never asked you to give
[1:39:56] up who you
[1:39:58] are I want you to think about
[1:40:01] it seems how you're own part of this
[1:40:06] cult am I speaking too
[1:40:10] blunt when someone asks for you to give
[1:40:12] up who you are you question
[1:40:16] that because you are fearfully and
[1:40:18] wonderfully made God Made You Who You
[1:40:21] Are
[1:40:23] and he just wants to express himself
[1:40:25] through you Hallelujah maybe we'll have
[1:40:28] a part two

[1:40:35] hallelujah I actually just cut off all
[1:40:38] the good
[1:40:39] stuff oh

[1:40:47] but you have
[1:40:49] suffered amen 220 Hallelujah

[1:40:56] don't know if it's warm where you're at
