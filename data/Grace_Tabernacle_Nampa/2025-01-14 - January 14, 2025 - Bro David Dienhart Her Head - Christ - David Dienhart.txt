TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you this evening. Amen. Good to be here. Amen. Amen. I'd just like to start with number 661. Victory in Jesus. I heard an old old story. How a savior came from glory. How he gave his life on Calvary to save a wretch like me. I heard about his groaning of his precious blood atoning. Then I repented of my sin and won the victory. Oh victory in Jesus my savior forever. He sought me and he bought me with his redeeing blood. He loved me where I knew him and all my love is due him. He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood. I heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealing how he made the lame to walk again. And he caused the blind to see. And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit." And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory. Oh victory in Jesus my savior forever. He sought me and he bought me with his redeeing blood. He loved me as I knew him. And all my love is due to him. He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood. I heard about a mansion he has built for me in glory. And I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea about the angels singing and the old redemption story. And some sweet day I'll sing up there a song of victory. Oh, victory in Jesus my savior forever. He sought me and he bought me with his redeeing blood. He loved me and I knew him and all my love is to him. He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flow. Amen. Amen. Number 144. What name the name of Jesus reaching higher far than the brightest star. Sweeter than the songs they sing in heaven. Let the saints proclaim what a lovely name. Soon he'll come in. Clouds of gloryy. Saints of every rain shall behold his face. With him enter heaven city ever to proclaim. What a lovely name. What a lovely name. The name of Jesus. Reaching higher fall than the brightest star. Sweeter than the songs they sing in heaven, the saints proclaim. What a lovely name. Amen. Amen. Let's uh yeah, let's stand. We'll sing that little course number 247. Heal me, O Lord.

Lord, just touch him. Amen. Uh I got a a text before I got to service tonight. Um uh cousin Elizabeth is uh they're getting ready to start her some another round of oral chemo. I don't know what the difference is, but um and um she went in to the doctor and they tested her I think calcium levels and they were like dangerously high. Uh and the doctor said he would have put her into the ER but he didn't know if she could take it. So, um he sent her home, has her drinking a bunch of water and she'll go back in. But they're just praying the Lord just bring those levels down. Amen. Just be with her. Amen. and want to remember our sister April. Continue to remember our sister Dorcas. Amen.

I um when when uh Nathaniel sent that text out for Elizabeth, he had a tag on there or a you know, little thing on there for uh that L Fontaine song, Something Keeps Holding Me. I like to sing that tonight. Amen. Sometimes we don't understand why, but I don't know. It just gets me. Something keeps holding me. It is. I I mean, there's been times going through different situations like why why why can't I? It's because it's real to us. It's realer than anything in this world could ever be, right? Amen. The trial of this world was getting closer. The pole I felt was more than I could bear. And I was on the verge of giving over the strength I within myself just wasn't there. Something keeps holding me every day. I see. Helping me faithfully to overcome my trial. guiding me constantly, giving me victory. He's a reality, but something keeps holding me. Satan laid before me his temptation of his desire to steal away my faith. But I have found inside the revelation, the strength I need to keep me in his grave. Something keeps holding me every day. I see helping me faithfully to overcome my trial. guiding me constantly. Give me victory. He needs a reality. And something keeps holding me. Cuz something keeps holding me. Every day I see helping me faithfully to overcome my trial. Guiding me constantly. giving me victory. And he's a reality. Something keeps holding me. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Number 114. created me a clean heart. Song's just been on my heart. Ask him every day. Lord Jesus, create in me a clean heart. Renew a right spirit within me. Seems like anytime we touch the things of this world, we get out there and do things. Just clean me once again, Lord Jesus. Amen. Create in me a clean heart. Oh. Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart. Oh, oh God. And renew a right spirit within me.

How many willing to give their life away? To him. Not just give it away, but give it to him. If you're going to give it, give it to him. Amen. Aren't you glad a fountain's open? &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a place that we can come to to worship. There's a provided place. Not this building. I'm glad it's provided.

Otherwise, don't use his name in vain. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't just ask in vain. Ask in faith coming. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Can hold that confession of faith. And notice what your confession is. A confession of faith. Amen. So, believe in your heart. Believe the word. It's revealed to you, then confess it. God's word is going forth, and it can't return to him void. Amen. That's right. Amen. Okay. While we're standing, I'd like you to turn with me to Ephesians chapter 1, verse 22 and 23. I want to title this her head, Christ. And I'm speaking of the bride, the bride's head, Christ. She has one head, &gt;&gt; only one head. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. She's not a double-minded bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. She can't be married to two heads at one time. If she is, she's an adulteress. You can't be double-minded. Amen. You can't be divided in opinion. Amen. You can't you can't be divided over here and married to this and married to that. You've got one head that you're submitted to. I'm talking to the bride. Is there any bride here tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're talking to the bride. Amen. So, Ephesians chapter 1 verse 22. And hath put all things under his feet. That's his body. Notice who he put it under. He put all things under his feet. and gave him him. Who is he? And gave him here's the answer. Gave him to be the head over all things to the church. Who's the church? The separated ones. The body of Christ. That's the church. Now watch verse 23. Which is his body. The church is his body. He's he's he's the head of the body, which is his body, and the body is the fullness of him. She's the finished mystery of Christ. &gt;&gt; She's the message of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She is the open book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the book opened, it was revealing the bride. It was revealing you. It was unfolding, unveiling his thought that you were his eternal thought before the foundation of the world. Until this book was opened, we couldn't be qui awakened. But when this book opened, we've awakened. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now being awakened, remember prophet said it took those seven thunders to awaken her. &gt;&gt; Amen. That which is the mystery of the seventh seal. It took those seven thunders to awaken her. &gt;&gt; And then a year later, he says, and he said, they have not recognized. They're calling for revival. They're calling for revival and have not recognized the awakening of the bride. And there we're 63 years later. Is there a bride awakened? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I can say personally by revelation and you ought to too. I was in his mind existing. I was I was I was alive and real in his thoughts and was ordained to be here in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. And always was his eternal possession. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it took the opening of the book. It took the opening of the word for me to realize it. &gt;&gt; But I always to that I always was. It wasn't based on my works. It's based on his his his grace and his his um purpose. Amen. That he purposed in himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That ought to make me shout amen. And we could go home right now. That's good enough for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. We never did the thing to merit it. He gave you an ear to hear. You had a listening post already put inside of you. And when the word come forth, you were able to discern the word. &gt;&gt; Not many can discern the word in this hour, but there's a bride that has discernment. &gt;&gt; Because she has the mind of Christ. Heavenly Father, I'm asking you to bless your word tonight. I'm asking you, Lord, to have your way with every individual heart. And Lord, open my mouth, Lord. And and speak the words of life because Lord, the life is in the body. The opened word is in the body, Lord. And we realize that we always were your thoughts expressed in a word. And Father, we are that spoken word seed, which is what you've sent in our time and our day to to to to show us the way. We've received the perfect interpretation of your word by divine vindication and that which is perfect has come. And Lord, we're we're gloring in that perfect. And we thank you for the perfect ministry of yourself that has been opened and has been spoken as you said it would be in our day with a with a with a with by you yourself coming down in a simple man and holding that sword. He said, "It fit my hand." And by the word, we've come to the realization of who we are. We give you praise. We give you thanks. And it's our victory because you are our victory. And that victory is revealed in us. And we have become your victory in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Colossians chapter 1 verse 18. Very familiar, similar verse. And he is the head of the body. Everybody understands that. Pretty easy to understand. He is the head of the body. Who's the body? The flesh and bone of him. Brother Bram said the body. The bride will be the flesh and bone of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said that's the bride. And so so she's the flesh and bone of him. And he is the head of the body, the church. Who is the beginning? Who is the beginning? The firstborn from the dead. Oh, hallelujah. Aren't you glad the death seal is broken? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad that the death you've passed from death unto life? I'm so thankful that I can say by revelation, and this is how the bride lives in this hour, by revelation, that we can say I've passed from death to life. I can say that I died with him. Paid the penalty of sin in his body and raised up victorious over death, hell, and the grave. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I couldn't be something different than I was in him before the foundation of the world. I have to come in my season to manifest that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. We have one head. And the bride only follows one head. And she's married to one head. &gt;&gt; She has no other preeminence. Her preeminence is one head. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he that this goes right on. Who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things in all things all things he might have the preeminence. Praise be to God. Are you willing to give him the preeminence? You know what preeminence means? The oversight to every little even to every every move you make. Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all these other things shall be added unto you. Just let him be first. Seek him first. Where is the kingdom of God? It's in the people. It's in the bride. The word made alive, made life in you, is the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And that is alive and well. Amen. Amen. Seek that first. &gt;&gt; Amen. and all these other things that you're so anxious about and can't figure out and why it is. He said, "I'll I'll I'll give it to you." Amen. Amen. All these other things will be added. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. All that the word ever said about you will be finished and done. Praise the Lord. All right. I'd like you to go with me now. So, what are we doing? What are we doing here? We're we ought to be giving up all &gt;&gt; to one head because he is the head in all things. The firstborn from the dead that in all things. All things. Why not give him all things? Then let's give him everything. Amen. Let's lay our veil. We said here the last time we spoke, lay our veil on his shoulders. You're married to him. He's your head. You have no other head. Amen. You're dependent upon him. We ought to be dependent. Not independent, but dependent &gt;&gt; upon him in all things. &gt;&gt; He has the preeminence. Are you willing to give him all things? We don't have brother sister. The bride is not a girlfriend boyfriend relationship. &gt;&gt; The bride is his wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he goes home with her. He governs the finances that you have. He does everything that a head would do. Amen. And if he gives it for you to do, fine. But he's given it to you. He leads you. He guides you. You're led by him. It's not I had my time with him. Bless God. I was in church and go home and live another life. &gt;&gt; No, you're not. It's not a boyfriend girlfriend relationship. It's a one relationship. one head. You're married to one head. &gt;&gt; The marriage, how many know the marriage has come? The union is now, not at the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have the union now. &gt;&gt; We're in union with him now. &gt;&gt; We go to the wedding supper to celebrate a union. &gt;&gt; Is that right? We're going to sit down at that table. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen. All right. And we're right here at that door right now. Amen. We're right here. We're ready. Maybe the next before we leave this building. I don't know when we're going to meet those loved ones, but they're going to be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're going to resurrect. And at the same time they resurrected, we expect an earthquake at the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when Christ arose, there was an earthquake. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And frankly, we've already we've had a great earthquake already happened. I mean, the earth has quaked and broke the seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. that thundered out. That's right. Amen. But we know we know that when that earthquake in in I don't know why I'm getting on this, but we know that earthquake in Alaska 1964, Brother Brandham said he was officially put out of the church. He was officially crucified. He said that's what that meant. And he said judgment was striking the West Coast. And you can see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. 60 62 years later, we see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we see it. We see LA. We see all of that West Coast under judgment. We can see it. It's going everywhere. It's going around the world. Amen. What's it leading up to? Amen. Two witnesses that go to to Israel. But what they waiting for us to get out of the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. Now, you talk about the earth being plagued. Wait till those two prophets come on. Not wait. I won't be here. I hope you're with me. I'll be gone. But they're going to have to stand that. And that's And what is it for? It doesn't plague Israel. It plagues those those Gentiles out there, Rome and the rest of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. Now, I won't get into that's another message, but if you can tell I've been into the fifth and sixth seal, but anyway. Okay. So, so let's give everything to one head. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Peter 3:11. And under that, under that understanding, under this that we've read and this that we have under one head get to second Peter here. Okay, let's just take verse 10 with it. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night. We know that. We know it's it's it's already in progress. It's coming already as a thief. They don't know what's happening. The world doesn't know what's happening. Most of most of message people don't know what's happening because God's taken a bride out of that. Not everybody that says, "I believe the message is going to be in the rapture." Did you know that? Everybody that has the revelation of what that message brought will be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. All right. So, because the only people that have perfect love, the capstone of perfect love is the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of people have felioial love, which is no nothing wrong with that. I have a felio love for my wife. She has for me. It's a human love. Amen. And that's good. That's fine. We need more human love. We need that love. That's part of that's part of the process. But the capstone is perfect. It's agape love. Amen. We grow up into that stature. And that's Christ himself. And that's who the bride is. You remember the scripture said that Christ remember he titled his sermon when he preached the seventh seal he said he said I mean not the seventh seal preaching but the when he when it come to the time for it to be open to the bride Christ the mystery of God revealed that's exactly what it is Christ is the mystery of God revealed then if Christ be in you the mystery is opened in you you want to know what the new birth is the mystery Christ revealed in You &gt;&gt; you are the mystery revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because whatever's in your soul is who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're sitting here tonight. Whatever's on the inside of the inside is who you are. &gt;&gt; That is who you are. That identifies you. That's who you are. &gt;&gt; You can have all kinds of sensations and feelings in your spirit, but that spirit, if that word's in the soul, that spirit will come under obedience to that word. And when it comes obedience to that word, what's happening? The word's made flesh in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember what the prophet said, the soul controls the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's a nature. That soul has a nature. And there's two natures in your body right now. There's a nature of an old man which is battling against you, and there's a nature of eternal life, which is Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many know that's true? Go back and read communion. That's exactly I'm not speaking of two souls. You only there's only one soul and that's Christ and you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so, but there is two natures and and those two natures are there an emnity against one another. &gt;&gt; But greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, second Peter 3:11 says this. He said, "But that the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein shall be burned up." You say, "Oh, brother David, how can you say?" I said, "It's coming as a thief." We We haven't come to that point yet. A lot of it around us, you may think it has, but it's coming to that place. We know that. But it does but it's not just an overnight thing. It's it's a progress of coming to that. But how does he come to that as a thief? Amen. What's he got to do first? Take us out of here. Remember he said his coming to us. His coming to he's coming to take the bride would be as a thief. He gets up at the ladder up in the nighttime when nobody no public around and he knocks on the window of of uh Romeo or Juliet and says come. We just read it. We just sang it. Come away. The spirit and the bride say come. What do they ask you to come to? Come to yourself. Come to your position. &gt;&gt; The ministry of the word is telling you your position that always was. You just need to recognize it. &gt;&gt; You're his word. You're his word living and you're his word in action. You are his faith. Other words, you the believer, the bride is the the substance, the revelation of God. The bride is paragraph 68 of perfect faith. The bride is the believer is the faith of God moving in you. What is that faith of God? That is perfect faith. It's God's own faith. And that's your identification. And faith is a revelation. And so you are the believer is the substance of God expressed right here in in your body, in my body, in a many membered body. &gt;&gt; Amen. With with different ministrations of that one head. &gt;&gt; Don't try to be somebody else. You just be yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. But be sure you know. If you don't know, you need to know you're born again. &gt;&gt; Because when you're born again, you know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know it because it'll identify itself with the word. It can't leave that word. It will identify itself because it was the thought of God to begin with and here to be manifest. And he put his thought in the word. Amen. And so we believe every everything in this Bible. Amen. Is that right? I don't hear an amen. &gt;&gt; You believe everything here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. But there's a thought behind this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul said, "We don't minister the letter. We minister the spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not ministers of the letter. Everybody has the letter, but we're ministers of the thought that's behind this letter. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the spirit of what this that's why he said we read between the lines. We're able to discern what he's saying between the lines. It was a letter sent to us. But the ministry is the thought expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are that thought expressed. &gt;&gt; That's what makes the bride such a mystic. That's what makes her peculiar. That's what makes her odd. &gt;&gt; Because she's in a direct relationship. She's in a love relationship with God himself, &gt;&gt; with Jesus Christ himself. And she's entered into the place of worship. She has no desire to leave. &gt;&gt; There's one place of worship and that's in Christ. And you cannot worship him except you be in Christ. You cannot call Jesus the Lord owner, your your head without having the Holy Spirit saying that within you. &gt;&gt; Right? All right. So, second Peter, I haven't got to verse 11. Okay. Now, seeing then after seeing what he's doing, how he's coming, what's going to happen, seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of person ought we to be? There you are. What manner of person ought we to be in all holy conversation? That's manner of living. Conversation is a manner of living. It's your manner of living. What manner of people ought we to be in all are living in action and deed. Amen. What manner of people ought we to be seeing these things will be dissolved. What manner of people ought we to be when we see our head is the word. Amen. You can't make you cannot you cannot direct your way. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; Every one of us in here cannot direct his own steps. &gt;&gt; You cannot direct your own way. You can't lead yourself. &gt;&gt; You're incapable of leading yourself. It's either God or Satan leading you. &gt;&gt; It comes down to there's only two powers. You're either led by the Holy Spirit dwelling abiding in you or you're led by a wrong spirit. You're you've got to you're a sheep. You have to be led and someone's leading you. Something a person is leading you. And if you say, "Well, I can lead my own self." No. Then you've got the enemy leading you &gt;&gt; because your enemy happens to be this man. I'm This is enemy right here. This old carnal self &gt;&gt; that's in my way every day is my enemy. It's emnity. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And emity means it's my enemy. &gt;&gt; And we are commanded to bring it under obedience every day. Isn't that what he said? He's your head. Give your all to him and follow him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 9:23 said, "If you'll follow me," Jesus said, then deny yourself. Deny yourself. Take up your cross daily and follow me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Deny yourself. Give yourself to him. And when it comes down to making decisions, make it with the word. Amen. Lean on God to reveal his word. Let him reveal. Let him lead you. Guide you. Let him direct your Let him, Brother Ram said this. He said, "Lord, lead me, guide me, direct me in what pleases you." And he said, "Without faith, it's impossible to please him." &gt;&gt; So, how's he going to lead us? By faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you led by faith, then your leadership is perfect. He's guiding you. He's leading you. He can't make a mistake in leading you. His ways are perfect. And if you're relying on him, your way can't be anything but perfect because you're in him. Your way is perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you think about it, what I think about it. I have all kinds of thoughts about it. I don't understand how he leads me. You don't have to understand how the shepherd leads you. You need to trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to give yourself to him. He's your shepherd. Let him lead you. He can't lead you astray. He's got to lead you into all truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. Then what manner of people ought we to be in all holy conversation, all all manner of living and godliness. Amen. &gt;&gt; What's godliness? Like God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. We are we are not this is a direct quote brother Brandham he said we are not creatures of time. Amen. Who do you think you are then? He said you're we're creatures of eternity. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; We're not creatures of time. We are creatures of eternity. &gt;&gt; All right. eternity. There's only one person that's eternal, and that's God. &gt;&gt; And if we're creatures of eternity, we had to be the thought of himself &gt;&gt; to begin with. That's why he'll never share his glory with another. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he he will share his glory with you because you're not another. The bride is not another. She is him. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so we see here the bride. We're not creatures, as I said, we're not creatures of time. We're creatures of eternity. We are spoken word creation of God. We are a spoken word creation. The written word, this written Bible has only been what, the last 250 years, maybe three, that we have this in written form. &gt;&gt; The original seed was not written word. It was spoken word. Amen. Are you with me? The original seed is spoken word. &gt;&gt; And you're the original seed. Before it was before it was any emotion, sensation or anything. It was the word. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. And when the eagle comes on the scene, a flying eagle and the seals are open, brother Bram said the eagle steps on the scene. Every age had to live under the anointing that they had. First age lion, then ox, then man. And Pentecost, it went from Luther Wesley to Pentecost was still reformation under man. The Pentecostal experience which every one of us need to come through. The Pentecost was the restoration of the gifts. &gt;&gt; Many are still under that. They haven't entered in to the opened word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm saying I'm not saying who is and who isn't. I'm saying many of people are back. We believe the gifts, but the emphasis isn't on the gifts now. It's on the word itself. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody's doing away with gifts. Nobody. I've I've had gifts. I've met gifts. I've prophesied. I've spoken tongues. I believe in every one of those things. But you can have every one of those things anointed by the genuine spirit and go to hell &gt;&gt; because the word is what makes the difference. The word, the person, the word in you. And you're the expression of that word. You came on the scene because the book was opened. &gt;&gt; The book was opened. The book is not a book of leather like we have or this Bible. That's not the Bible is, by the way, the full redemption. I mean the the full re the the book of redemption. Yes. But the book spoken of is not a book like that. It's himself. &gt;&gt; It's himself. &gt;&gt; He opened himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord we have it in written form. We're not doing away with written form. But as long as you got an intellectual knowledge of the letter, it won't do you a bit of good. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You have to have revelation. God said, "I'll reveal myself." and he'll only reveal the message to his bride. &gt;&gt; That's what makes the difference was revelation. That was the difference between Cain and Abel was revelation. &gt;&gt; That the only difference &gt;&gt; they both sacrificed. They both had a church. &gt;&gt; And you can and I I can tell you right now, they could both be anointed by the hol by the Holy Ghost to do those works. But one had the revelation of what God wanted and and meant for the hour and the season and the time &gt;&gt; and that makes the difference today. &gt;&gt; One can enter into the full word. One can enter but till before the eagle with that eagle anointing came. Amen. It turned to the word itself completely. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, we had the the restoration of the gifts of Pentecost and the baptism of the Holy Spirit. And we all have to have the baptism of the Holy Spirit. But remember, you cannot be born again unless the Holy Spirit falls on a predestinated seed in your heart. The ground had to be pre-prepared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That word had to be laying there for it to be quickened. And that's the only way that you can have a real birth. And when you have a birth and you're going to discern the message of the hour, you're going to see the message of the hour and you're going to realize and accept the message of the hour and your life will express it. &gt;&gt; Because it's revealed to you. And there's the true evidence right there of agape love. Because brother Bram said love was not the evidence of having the Holy Ghost. Yeah. I don't even hear an amen. You know, that's what he said. He said the evidence was having a true revelation and a and of the hour and the time and the message of the hour. That's what he said. And he took us right back to the scripture in in St. John in in St. No in yeah St. John 16. He'll show you these things to come. He will teach you and show you those things revealed. Brother Brandham said he will reveal it to you. Having a clear understanding of the hour, receiving the word for the season, Brother Brandham said, is the genuine evidence that the Holy Ghost is living in you. &gt;&gt; And if it's the Jeanwide evidence of the Holy Ghost in you, then you have a genuine evidence that you are in and have agape love. &gt;&gt; That's 1 Corinthians 13. Without turning to it, be saving time. 1 Corinthians 13 said, "I could do all these things. I could I could I could well, you could you could preach. You could do all the He said, "I can have knowledge of the of the of the of the uh let's just read it." Amen. Let's go over to 1 Corinthians 13. I'll take that side step just a minute since I'm on that point. 1 Corinthians 13th. Though I speak with tongue of men and angels and have not charity, I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol. Charity is the capstone. It's Christ. Charity is a person. Charity is God himself. Charity is him in you living. Right? &gt;&gt; And the only ones that can have charity is them that are in Christ to begin God to begin with. &gt;&gt; Just think of that a minute. People are they can they can have knowledge. They can they can have wisdom. They can have all those things and still not have charity. Let's go on and read. I speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not charity. I'm become as a sounding brass or tinkling symbol. And nobody, brother, sister, we don't don't even think for a minute. I don't believe in speaking in tongues. I do. But the word for the hour and Brother Bram said this ministry and I I'll come to that in a minute. But they can they're anointed by the genuine. That's why you better be careful how you speak against an anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Judas was anointed. He was given power to cast out devils. And he was a son of predition. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Balam was anointed with the same Holy Spirit that Moses was anointed with. same Holy Spirit. What was the difference? Not the not the sign. He could his prophecy, Balam's prophecy is still happening. Those that bless Israel will be blessed. Those who curse Israel will be cursed. His prophecy still living on. He couldn't prophesy anything different. Then what was the difference? His teaching was not the word for the season. &gt;&gt; And Moses's teaching was perfect. There's your difference. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that brother Ram said we ought this is a mystery that came to pass after the opening of those seven seals. How those things could be anointed. Everyone we believe in signs. We believe in miracles. We believe in and in in prophecy and they prophesy the truth. You can be baptized with the Holy Ghost every day of your life. And brother Brandham said it's just a temporal gift for you. The real gift is your soul down in there that can receive and hear the word. He said and that's the evidence of this charity. You don't know you have can say the Lord the Jesus is my Lord. You can't see charity or know charity without without him in you. &gt;&gt; Unless you're born again, you cannot call Jesus Lord. Oh, you could you could say it, but it doesn't mean anything. It's a tinkling symbol. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you don't know him as Lord. &gt;&gt; The born again know him as Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so uh Oh, I was going to say, so Balum, what difference was was this teaching? He said, "Where? Why? They're all the same. Let's all come together. We're all the same." And brother Brandham said it was an un the Lord the word God said it was an unpardonable sin and he never forgave Israel for that. And the same spirit same Holy Spirit was anointing two men and Kora they had signs and wonders and they followed Moses' message you can say to the letter but they had the same spirit of Ba they had the same teaching of Balum. They come against the ministry of the day of the hour. Do you know, brother Bram said Moses was the anointed word in his day and he turned right around and said the seventh angel is the anointed word for our day. See, we we cannot we have to be careful what we say about this message. &gt;&gt; We're not following a man. We are following his message. But God separated himself to that one man. And without that man's message, you will never know this Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will never understand it. You'll never have an understanding of it. That's right. No way. You cannot interpret it yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. We already have a perfect interpretation. That's what God sent a prophet for. The prophets were the interpretation of the word for their season. And brother Brandham said the seed of God that could receive the life of God was the very interpretation of the word for their season. But God used a prophet to interpret it. We are not the interpreters. We are the interpretation of it. &gt;&gt; But God used a prophet and put the sword in his hand. And I want you to know whose sword it was. It was the king's sword. It wasn't a sword. It was the king's sword. It was the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we better start feeding on the book. You expect to go home and make a rapture, you better start consuming the book. You better start eating the book because when you you don't have nothing else to do, he said he said that book wasn't even be even able to be taken by a man. &gt;&gt; No way. He said no one was worthy to open that book or loose it or even look upon it. And here we find the ministry of the seventh angel. God used to interpret that book. Open it. That was his ministry. And when he opened the book, he opened up us. It was you because you were the book. Amen. So when he opened that book, what happened? It loosed you to your position. You were positionally placed because remember what the prophet said. He opened those seals. And what were those seals opened for? To show the bride where she came from, who she is, and where she's going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We needed that open book. &gt;&gt; Without the open book, even though the price was paid at Calvary, but he had to open the book to claim what he redeemed. Well, you say how can how can you listen? Brother Brandham said he stepped forward right at the end of the age. The end of the seventh age, Christ stepped forward and took the book and opened it. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; What means by stepping forward? Because if he steps forward, he's leading the way. You just follow him. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, every predestinated seed that was in that book will have to come to the position. They that were ready went in the marriage with him. went in with him in the marriage. Amen. All right. And then then what? When? What? How? When the last one comes in, what happens? The door shut. Not another one can come in. No. Not. And yet the ministry will go right on for a season. Preaching to the eternal loss. And yet the message being preached is for the bride and the church. You say, "Why the church?" because they're a sanctified people. And by ministering that message, that opens the door for them to bless you and do what's right. And in the judgment, they get are given eternal life. They can't be in the bride. But they're good people, sanctified people. I won't go into all that. I've already been through a series on that. So that's truth. Amen. All right. So the bride is the faith of God moving in you active. What's moving in you that that that faith in you is active. It's living. It's leading and it's directing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Into all truth right into a body change right into the rapture. That's exactly what it is. You've already got the rapture. Listen, the rapture is going. The move is on for the bride. He saw the preview her marching. Right. &gt;&gt; She was going. The rapture is going. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's already going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's on the go right now. And when that last one, when that little bride recognizes what it is, the rapture, he said, will go. Not come. Go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. People don't even realize a lot of I'm well I say people I it's it's not my business to know who but I'm thankful it's an individual affair &gt;&gt; and I can know that and you can know that and it's a it's more real than I'm have my look at my body here stand more that it's more real than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the brother prophet said it's already happening. It's already taking place. The rapture is taking place. And how do you know that last one hasn't raptured and come to who they are? See, &gt;&gt; see, it's a rapturing up. Revelations 4:1 wasn't just an uh it was a spiritual rapture of John, which is a type of the bride. He was caught up, seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Brother Brandham said he was raptured up. Amen. All right. So, see, where are you seated? Where are you? Where's God in? Where where's the God of Elijah today? Amen. He had to follow him, didn't he? Elijah Elisha had to follow. And three times Elijah tried to get him to terry. You know, I've got to go here. Why don't you tar here? I've got to go here. Why don't you tar here? I got to t here. No, he said, I'm not going to leave you. &gt;&gt; When he was called, he left everything. When El when Elisha was called by Elijah, &gt;&gt; God told him to go call Elisha to sit in your room. Amen. He knew he's coming down the end of his ministry. And Elisha actually these we sing a song. These are the days of Elijah. Actually, these are the days of Elisha. &gt;&gt; Because under her messenger, she's the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; This is the days of Elisha. It's the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what that's the mystery of his coming. That's the seventh seal mystery is his coming of how he comes and when he comes. I could read it right out of the book. I've got it right here. Christ the mystery. He said that's the seventh seal and that's what I'm speaking to you today. He said that's what I'm opening up to you. I've never brought it because it was he couldn't bring it because that was the silence of Revelations 10 when it opened. But it opened. Brother Bram said, "Notice it's opened." And the opening, the silence meant it was a mystery, but it was known and is known to the bride. Amen. Amen. It was only shut for a season because it had to be shut because that's exactly trying to note that's what John couldn't write. And brother Bram said that seventh seal revelation is the revelation of his coming. Amen. Are we going to meet him in the air? Yes, sir. But without this revelation, you won't be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say that's pretty blunt, brother David, that that's the truth. &gt;&gt; You say you scare us. It shouldn't scare you. It should rejoice. &gt;&gt; It shouldn't be a scary thing to you. See, see, if you're not sure when when a person when a man is when a person is double-minded, they're not sure of where they're standing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They're fearful, &gt;&gt; right? They're they're fearful about what they're doing. They're not sure of what they're doing. Amen. It's confusion. The middleman, Brother Aram said, is the worst place to be. &gt;&gt; Here's Adam that believed the truth. Here's Satan that didn't believe. And Eve was in the middle. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a man that's gung-ho. This will make a great present. The other one says, "Oh, he's a hypocrite." And then the other one in the middle doesn't know what to do. And brother Brandham said that's the same way it is in religion in Christianity. He said there's always the middle one that don't know what to do. He said that's the bad place to be because he's double minded. He doesn't know which way to go. He's caught in between. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't Don't be caught in between. Start feeding on the book. Start eating the book. Quit quit him hh hh hh hh hh hh hh hh hh hhawing around with so many other things and start eating the book and God will take care of the rest of it. &gt;&gt; The very escape you need is written right here right here in this message of the seventh angel. The eagle message and we're under that eagle anointing. What is it? Revelation flying high. Even we can find that eagle anointing right in there between Elijah and Gahhesi when the Syrians said, you know, the king was talking about, well, who's letting who's letting those those king of Israel know what's going on? Every time I show up, he's not there. Who now? Which one of you doing that? He said, well, it's not us doing it. It's a prophet. Well, let's go after that prophet. So, they surround Syria. I mean they surround Israel, surround Jerusalem or I don't if he was in Jerusalem at the time but wherever Elijah was they surrounded him and Gahesy looks out the window gets up in the morning and his seat legs start trembling as our brother said one time I kind of like like the way he said it the knees start shaking and started trembling he says master he said just relax there's more of us than them &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and and then that prophet which was an eagle, he turned around and said, "God, open that boy's eyes." He sent his anointing of what he saw, asked God and sent that same anointing on him. And I tell you right now, how our eyes, our eyes come open, unless God sent an eagle. &gt;&gt; Because otherwise, you're still under the man age. &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? You have to live to that time. And that that is the word again. Amen. You're not an you weren't a chicken to begin with. You're an eagle. The only thing you'd hear the scream is of an eagle. &gt;&gt; That's the only voice you know. &gt;&gt; Okay. So he said, "Open that boy's eyes." And when he opened his eyes, there they were chariots of fire all around him. And so that that settled Gahesy. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wasn't afraid of them anymore. He said, "Here you are. Okay, come on. Come on. Call it on there. more more of us than you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Makes you pretty bold when you realize what you are and who you are and where you're standing. Bold in the spirit. Not bold in your nature. Bold, but bold in the Holy Spirit. Stand toe-to-toe with that devil. &gt;&gt; My computer started acting up my printer. I said, "Satan, take your hands off it. Lord, touch this computer." And then paused. Wouldn't print. All of a sudden, started printing. Amen. Amen. Just here recently, this may sound strange, but I it's not anything I did, but when you're inspired to do something, act upon the spirit of the moment. &gt;&gt; Let the leadership of the Holy Spirit, you've given yourself to him, trust him in everything you do. He'll order your way. He'll order your steps. And if it's off the word, get away from it just as quick as you can. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. down visiting a few months ago in Arizona. It was when the hummingbirds were still feeding and everything. I walked out one morning, we were getting ready to go and there was a dead hummingbird. The Lord put it in my heart to ask for the life of that hummingbird. And you know what? He raised from the dead. Oh, now, brother David, listen. Don't tell me he doesn't mean to the little things that if he meant that to that little thing, what about what about the rest of it? What about your life? What about your leadership? What about him guiding you? &gt;&gt; Why are you questioning what he made you to be? Why are you finding fault with it? &gt;&gt; God made you the way you are. Start feeding on the book. Start opening the word. Start start putting that as the head over all everything else. and do what the Holy Ghost said for you to do and quit your fearing about doing it. Do what he said to do. Let go of everything and give it all to him and do what he said to do. He'll take care of the rest of it. You don't have to fear, well, if I do this, if I do that, if I stop doing this, what are people going to think? Where am I going to get my money? Where am I going to do this? Where am I going to do that? Let's stop being double-minded and get down to one head, one God, one mind. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. A double mind means wavering. You're wavering. Amen. You remember, you remember, let me just say this before that. His church bride, his church is himself revealed. Yes. &gt;&gt; His bride is himself revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And that's when Christ reveals to himself personally to you, the mystery is revealed. That brother Bram said is the new birth. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so Jesus Christ revealed in you. Jesus Christ the new birth. This is exactly how I said that. Jesus Christ the new birth is revealed in you. Amen. Right. Now, the bride is not double-minded. James 1:8 said, "A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways." Double-minded means wavering, uncertain, divided in interest. He's wavering. He's uncertain and he's divided in interest. His interest is divided. He's not fully for Christ. See, see now I just keep reading here what I wrote down here. Wavering uncertain divided. Your heart is not fixed in Christ alone. A double-minded man. His heart is not fixed in Christ alone. For you to live, for you to live is not Christ alone. Remember what Paul said, for me to live is Christ. To die is gain. My heart, your heart should be fixed on one head. &gt;&gt; And everything we do ought to ought to be ought that little wheel in the middle of the wheel ought to ought to direct everything you do. &gt;&gt; And it will not take you off of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will not it will not it cannot take you from away from the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he is the word and you're in him. You're the word. Amen. You can't deny the word because you are the word. All right. Now, so you are double-minded. You can't be married to two heads at the same time. The word says so. It must be one head. &gt;&gt; The bride, the prophet said, is heavenly minded, and heaven consists of the word. Amen. All right. She's not leaning to her own understanding. Proverbs 3:5. She doesn't lean to her own understanding. She's following him. I'm not saying Satan will try to get you to lean to your own understanding. He'll put you try to get you. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about what the soul believes. &gt;&gt; It will not lean to your own understanding. It tried to bring that in. There's a correction right there. You know it. You discern it. There's a discerner that discerns the enemy. I don't care how slick he is, how how un how he comes in that Holy Ghost in you will discern who it is. &gt;&gt; When you hear a voice out here, the Holy Ghost will discern. It'll give you discernment. In fact, I got a quote on that. Let me just say what he said in that quote here. He said this. Now our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see and what we hear. Our eternal our eternal destination is not altogether determined and he he's preaching this in discerning the body of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Okay. 59 81259 he said our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see and what we hear but it's determined on what discernment you have of what you see and what you hear &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; why one can discern what they hear the other one said that's not the truth that's that's a lie they didn't catch it what the what the apostle what the what The Pharisees and the Sadducees, how they discern Jesus Christ, he's Beloveub. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The little woman at the well discerned it and said, "You're Messiah." &gt;&gt; What's the difference? Their discernment. &gt;&gt; She didn't see a beautiful man all in robes, but she saw a man that knew the secrets of the heart, and that was the word of God. &gt;&gt; That was the living word to her because she had discernment. She had she was predestinated. had a predestinated seed there. That was a that was a a a hearing post to hear the true word. And she didn't make that up. She didn't figure it out. She didn't go to a book about it. She discerned it right there. We know that when Messiah cometh, he'll do these things. But who are you? He said, "I am he." That's all she need to hear. That put her on fire right there. She left that old clay water pot and started drinking from a fountain. just what we sang about. There is a fountain open. &gt;&gt; Amen. That never runs dry. All right. &gt;&gt; Paul was not disputing with them. Okay. Now, let's just take something here if you don't mind. Brother Brandham said. Now, no man, now we're talking about discernment. Now, watch. No man, no person, no woman, boy, girl, I don't care who he is, is fit to go in the pulpit or even claim to be a Christian without being filled with the Holy Ghost. You want more? We're coming on communion. All right, watch what he says. He said, "You have no right to the Lord's supper or any communion, feet washing, or anything until you've been cleansed by the holy fire of God." Why? Because you're coming up here saying, "I'm in communion. I'm in fellowship with him." And then go out and live another life. Not what what's Paul saying here? Paul's not Paul was not disputing with them for taking the communion. Their act was right, but their discernment was wrong. &gt;&gt; There it is. For taking the Lord's supper is the commandment of the Lord, but to take it unworthily, not discerning the Lord's body. What have we been saying tonight? The discerning of the Lord's body. What is the Lord's body? It's his body. It's the full fullness of himself. You are taking those sacraments saying you are one with him. &gt;&gt; If you aren't one with him, you just heard what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Amen. So get right with him. Get things right. Come and take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have no right to take it. Now, there's going to be people take it that won't even hear that. But there's no right to take it unless you are filled with the Holy Ghost. And we want we don't want people to stop taking. We want them to take it. And there's people that should be taking it that won't. And what's it doing? It's showing them they have no place with him. See, it's it it you know it. I know that. He said it's a showdown. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you don't take it, you have no communion with me. &gt;&gt; If you do take it unworthily, then what did he say about taking it unworthily? See, so what are we going to do? We going to have to make our calling election and sure, aren't we? By the word. &gt;&gt; So, let's get start getting oursel in the right position with him and approach him in the right way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. Then you're going to see other things start happening and what's what's holding it back will be broken. All right. Now he said here he said for taking the Lord's supper commandment of the Lord but take it unworthily you don't discern the Lord's body is where the wrong lays those Christians who taking communion and not living the life Christianity Christianity is a experience and life and these Christians were just living any kind of like making a poor example of their profession and Paul said that's that's the cause many are sick and weakly among you And many are asleep. And asleep means dead. Because they haven't discerned the body of the Lord. The body of the Lord is his word living and in action. It's his body. Amen. Amen. Okay. Now, and we call ourselves Christians have no trait to take communion unless we are living above a reproach of the world. We have no right. The communion are for those who are living right as an example of Christianity. &gt;&gt; That's pretty straight, isn't it? &gt;&gt; You know what? I like it straight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's not to hurt you. That's to deliver you. &gt;&gt; Okay. May I pass this to you? And we're going to come to a close here. very soon. Very quick. All right. Now, I didn't finish 1 Corinthians 13. And he said, "Though I have the gift of prophecy, understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could move mountains, remove mountains, have all faith and remove a mountain, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profitth me nothing. Amen. Think of that. It's strict, isn't it? See how strict it is? But it was sent. Who is this all sent to? Who is this word speaking to? Speaking to his seed, to his life. Amen. Amen. All right. Now, first second 1 Corinthians 2:14. Let's just close here on this if we can right here. Second 1 Corinthians 2:14. I could read a lot of the second chapter. I love that that second chapter of of first Corinthians. Let's start with verse 12. Well, let's start with verse 11. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so, the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. The only way you can know the things of God is by the spirit of God. Okay? Now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of God that we might know. Know is revelation know is knowing substance. He said that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also notice we speak not in the words. Words have a carry weight because words is a thought expressed. Not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. Amen. So you're proving things spiritual by the spiritual. All right. Now, but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God. Now listen to this. The natural man does cannot, excuse me, but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God. For they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them because they are spiritually, here's your word, discerned. They are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual, is there anybody spiritual in here? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, but he that is spiritual by the spirit birth word in you. He that is spiritual judgeth all things. Yet he himself is judged of no m. Amen. We're not standing under man's judgment. We are standing before his judgment. And he opened the book and he already judged his bride. The bride's already been judged. That's why she doesn't stand before the judgment. All right. Now, so he himself judged a man. For who hath known who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. Now, brother Brandham said, he said, the prophet being there, he said, now we're in the seeing time. Amen. Because the prophet, the light, the interpretation of the word is coming forth the message and that's the light to walk in. He said you walk in that light. Thy light is come. All right. And then but he said now watch. He said but now there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye. That's the last moving faculty of the body is beyond the eye. I mean beyond the eye. There's no moving faculty. The next Why would he say the next? Because this is what the bride moves into. The next is Christ is excuse me is the intelligence which is Christ itself or himself. See the next beyond the moving of the eye the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself who controls the whole body. That's the capstone. And the prophet said this message is the capstone message. &gt;&gt; He said another place it's the headstone message. So what have we moved into? You have the mind of Christ which is the word himself in you. &gt;&gt; You've moved up. You've turned a corner. No longer are you preaching the message of Pentecost because the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way. If it fell on the seed, what'd it do? It was sent for one purpose, to make way for the Holy Ghost to come right down in perfection back to the word again. What is it then? It's the word. In the beginning was the word. God expressed his thought and you're his expression. So what is the portion the bride holds? The bride's portion is the manifestation or revelation of the word. Amen. This word went out. The book's been opened. Who was it open to? And then it was given to John and no man could read it. But now he was commanded, "Take the book. &gt;&gt; It's yours. Take it. It's been opened." Now he commanded to feed it. He said, "Eat it." &gt;&gt; And then John said, "Give me." He told the angel, "Give me the book." &gt;&gt; It's my property. It's revealing who I am. It's positionally placing me. And we go back to Genesis. Genesis, if if you'll turn with me over there real quick to Genesis. Genesis 2. Look at this real quickly in Genesis 2. And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam as he did the second Adam. Are you with me? I said that so you'll know. And he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh and stood thereof. And the rib which the Lord had taken from him made he a woman. So he made the woman out of Adam. So what was that woman? What was Mrs. Adam? She was the sealed mystery in Adam. Eve. You say Eve wouldn't even name. But the woman was the mystery sealed in Adam. So, Adam was put to sleep, opened up, and the elements poured out to make the mystery. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about when Jesus went to Calvary, I would, you were in him then. Amen. We were that mystery that still had to be unfolded. There was a capstone. There was a capstone happening in Eden that finished the mystery and that was the woman. You're the mystery of the book. &gt;&gt; You are the mystery. You are the mystery of Revelation 107. You are the finished mystery. So, so there he come forth and she come forth, but it was a period of time there because she couldn't she didn't Adam never saw her yet and she never saw Adam yet. Here's what it says. And made he the woman and brought her unto the man. If we go to Exodus 19, Moses said, "I've carried you on." God said through Moses, "I've carried you on eagle's wings and brought you to myself." Who brought who to himself? I brought you to myself. And when Eve met Adam or Mrs. Adam met Mr. Adam, Mr. Adam said, "She's bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. She's me." &gt;&gt; So what happened when they opened the book in this hour? What happened? See out of a out of the second Adam come Eve come Mrs. Adam Mrs. Jesus Christ. The book is opened and she comes to her position. She awakens. This is who I am. This is my positive position. And God said himself, rising of the sun, she is him. Adam said, "She is me. She's bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh. And I'll call her woman because she come out of me. and she has a womb to bear my life. Amen. All right, I went through that pretty fast. That's a message in itself. Okay, I'm closing now. When a when a man now may I pass this to you? When the supernatural comes in, that's the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. Seventh seal paragraph 35. When the supernatural comes in, underline in in where many see the supernatural. Many see it. Many are still under working under the gifts. Many are are are praising the Lord and and and having all kinds of emotions. And I believe in that. And I believe in praising the Lord. And I believe rejoicing. And they're all doing that. And under the same Holy Spirit I've got. they have. But there's a difference between the bride and I'm not saying who's under that and who isn't. I'm just saying they're there. We know that. Brother Brandham said this. This is a mystery that had to be should be spoken on and preached about. Amen. It's what he said. And and and so we see then that it comes back to the word itself. The word made way for the word himself to come right down in perfection. Back to that word again. All right. Now, now you're coming. See, the bride's been coming and is coming into perfect faith, perfect perfection that cannot fail. That faith never fails. And so, when a man lives by faith and walks by faith, I mean substance faith, substance faith. Revel Hebrews 11:1 faith is the substance and it's the evidence. That's why I said it's the evidence of things not seen. All right? He is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ. There now you're getting into bride material. You're getting into rapturing condition. Amen. I'll just leave that. That's a lot of quote I could read, but I'll pass it. Jesus lived in a world no one knew about. He was an odd person. a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was. And the bride is walking in a perfect faith in the perfect God of what she is. It's exactly the same which he was. He lived in perfect faith of a Christian. If we lived in a perfect faith, see, and that's the way with all believers, they're a mystic as he was a mystic. I'll bypass some of this. And he was talking in riddles. They didn't understand him. And many think the prophet spoke in riddles. But he did that for a purpose. You know the brother said he did that to thin down his crowd. &gt;&gt; He spoke it in a way that some would leave some would ponder. He said that if you're interested in knowing where unveiling of God. Okay. But he said it but the bridal discerned the difference. They discern it just like Peter did. Where would we go? Thou hast the words of life. Okay. I'm happy today to be one of them being identified by the word which is Christ. Being identified identified with his word which is him. If I'm in Christ I am his word for he is the word. Therefore all that he was I am. And all that I am he was. Amen. Being dead in him we are identified with him. What he is I am. Amen. Amen. Could you compare a Christian today with them Christians long ago? How the disciples walked in the power of the spirit, moved by the Holy Ghost, just a prisoner. I preached the other night, a prisoner to the word and will of God. He couldn't even move until God moved him. Wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that? Let me tell you what he said. She's got to and she will. And I say, that's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. We see it. 63 years down the road, we see it. I know it's true. Amen. Then you know, if you abide in me and my word in you, then you know who you are. And this is where he said, "We need a going back to the desert." He said, "Now she's going, she's going back." Brother Brham said, "She'll go back. She's on her road now. She'll make it. She'll be there." And brother Brandham said down here, he said, "Now, don't try to manufacture something." And we've tried. We strained. We've we've paid. We've labored. And we had until we had no voice and try to manufacture something and soup up something and all these things find it to be a total failure. We need a going back to the desert, right? Yes, sir. Camp meetings and struggles. Why not just give up? That's what you ought to do. See, go back. Give up. What's the words going back? I just read it. Going back where? back to the word. She's going to be going back. She's going, Other words, she's going back to what she was in the beginning. She'll be here at the end. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Do you love him? Amen. We are remember Balum's teaching. We're We are the same. Brother Brandham said, I'll just leave you with this. We are not the same. You are a separated people, holy unto the Lord, dedicated to the word and the spirit of God to bear fruit of his promise in this day. And you're not of them. I know that's awful strong, but that's the truth just the same. Dedicated to a service in this last day. Come out from among it. Amen. Amen. Thank the Lord. Let's stand together. Sorry that I took a little overtime in your thinking. But God thought to finish it. So, so I'm thankful that you've had patience. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the word of this hour in this day that we have been open to us. The book has been opened, Lord. The purpose of Calvary. That was the purpose, Lord. The full redemption's come forth. He bought us. Now he had to claim what he had bought and redeemed and the full redeeming, the full redemption. Lord, we receive it and we see it. And it's through that precious blood that we are redeemed. We are we are bought. We are your prisoners. We are prisoners of yours. We are your property, your possession. We give thee thanks, Lord. Let these words go deep into every heart. Those that have ears to hear will hear what the spirit they'll hear what the spirit and the bride say. And so, Father, this was on my heart. I've delivered. I believe what you had in my heart to believe to deliver, not knowing even how it would be delivered, but I believe you've delivered it. Now, you bless it now and have blessed your word. Continue to bless your word here, veiled behind skin. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Is Brother Isaac. Brother Isaac, could you come and just finish out of many song or songs you want to sing? Amen. God bless you. Amen. Uh song that just came to me was so glad I'm yours, Lord. Amen. Just thinking about the sermon and what we sang before. Give myself away. I'm yours, Lord. Amen. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours. So glad your mercy has followed me. So glad you found me and set me free. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours. So glad your mercy has followed me. So glad you found me and set me free. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Just as we close tonight, um, blessed be the Lord God Almighty. It's a good question. You can pull that one up. B flat. From Father in heaven, we love you. We lift your name in all the earth. May your kingom be established in our praises as your people declare your mighty word. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come.
