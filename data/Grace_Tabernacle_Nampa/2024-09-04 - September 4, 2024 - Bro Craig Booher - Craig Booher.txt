good to be here we had a wonderful fellowship at brother Chris's last night just just just felt a warm welcome we're talking about the Lord and the presence of the Lord came so sweetly in that house as just a wonderful and I believe that's what real Fellowship is is when we Fellowship around the things of God we appreciate each other and we appreciate that but you know it's it's the God is what brings us together so uh I have my family with me Anna Josiah Samuel Aaliyah and uh they're with me I'm happy to have them we uh done a camp up in North Idaho and brother Paul invited us down here this is the first time we've ever been in these parts but we feel we certainly feel welcome uh we're pastoring a church there in Meridan Connecticut Overcomer Tabernacle and so just fighting a good fight looking for the return of the Lord Jesus and he's on his way and we're looking forward to his return let's stand our feet and we'll go straight to the word of God is it is it possible for me to get just a little more on these floor monitors I don't want to blast to hurt nobody uh Isaiah we'll turn to Isaiah 35 I have a little a little lengthy scripture reading probably about 10 verses uh Isaiah 35 verse one I love the word of God am I love the message and uh the message is not complete Until It's Made flesh in us and uh so we want to be hearers and doers yes sir and we want to manifest Jesus Christ to a dying age Isaiah 35 is everybody there amen the Wilderness and the solitary Place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and Blossom as a rose and it shall Blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing and the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it the Excellency of Carmel and Sharon and they shall see the glory of the Lord and the Excellency of our God strengthen ye the weak hand hands confirm the feeble knees say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong and fear not amen say unto them yes that are of a fearful heart be strong and fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even the god with recompense and he will come and save you verse five and then the eyes of the blind shall be opened the ears of the death shall be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as a heart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall Waters break out and streams in the desert and the parch ground shall become a pool in a thirsty land Springs of water and in the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes and a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fool should not he therein no lion shall be there nor any ravenous Beast shall go up thereon it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there amen and the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting lasting Joy upon their heads and they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee amen I want to preach tonight on the way of Holiness amen if you have a need you'd like to lift before almighty god let's just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father you see our hands and our hearts that are lifted as we come into your presence this evening and we come Lord not as bystanders to observe but we come as Believers to receive Lord May the Holy Spirit Lord finish the great work you have begun in our lives and may the word of God find a resting place in our hearts in our homes in our families in our church Lord May the spirit of God have preeminence and Lord we just give you complete control speak to our hearts give us what we have need of we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you thank you so much you can have your seats this scripture is beautiful and it has a compound uh meaning to it an application rather as we know that we're reading about the Millennium and uh it has also a spiritual application that applies to us today and uh a highway as the Bible said there shall be a highway and a way a highway is a prominent Road and uh that was even back then Rome was famous for making their roads but the scripture you find is commentaries if you study commentaries they express difficulty trying to understand what exactly this scripture means there shall be a highway and there shall be a way and uh God has always in all ages provided a way for his people amen if God is wanting to get us to a place God will provide a way for us to get there how many believe this blessed Bible is God's way it's God's program it's God's Plan of Salvation and the Bible is the map to eternal life that we are sure to get there we're sure uh not to fail if we follow the word of God and uh there are only two ways there is a right way and there is a wrong way there is man's way and there is God's way and you cannot go right and wrong at the same time you can only go the right way as you follow God in other words that you cannot follow man and God at the same time you must follow God how many want to follow God there's 45,000 denominations and everyone believes something different but everyone believes that they are right now there is a right and there is a wrong surely not everyone is right and we don't want everyone to be wrong and the Bible said there is a way that seeth right that's right but that way the end is death and we don't want the way that seems right we want the way that is right and that way is by the Bible praise the Lord so to refuse the right way is to take the wrong way that right to re reject the Holy Ghost is to reject life eternal so it it it it is uh a caution to us to study where we are going because there is only one right way amen and it behooves us to study what we're doing and the direction that we're going and we cannot go wrong with the word of God and the blood will never fail us if you pull up that scripture there in John 14 verse one this is familiar to us as we kind of get our footing this evening these are Jesus words he said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am ye may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know and Thomas saith un him Lord we know not whether thou goest or how can we know the way and Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life and no man can come unto the father but by Me Jesus was saying at Calvary that he opened up the way that God is no respector of persons black man white man yellow man whosoever will if he wants life there is a way provided for that man and there is a way that we have desired life there is a way for us to receive life and Jesus destroyed the workings of the devil that day at Calvary he destroyed the power of the enemy Satan was knocked out and his backbone was broken that day how how many believe that God became a man and God paid our price and he made a way that we could live and Satan lost the battle and Jesus said I am the way and that way is a way of Holiness praise the lord we know that Jesus had connected God and man so man could return back to God again so Jesus when he said I am the way he was the way of Holiness bear with me just for a moment in Acts chapter 19 I want you to look at these scriptures here in the New Testament sa in verse one I've got it I got the scriptures here for you so you don't have to turn there it said Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and he desired of him letters to Damascus us to the synagogue that he that if he found any of this way that's right whether they were men or women that he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem now he was looking for those if he found any of those in this way in the New Testament the word way is expressing the Believers the gospel El the Bible calls it the way of the Lord the way of life the way of Salvation go to Chapter 19 Verse 8 it says it again here and he went into the synagogue and he spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God but when diverse were hardened and believed not but spake evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and so on and so forth so once again the scripture when it's speaking of the Gospel is calling it the way notice chapter 24:14 if you'll pull that up for me it says and this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy yeah so worship I the god of my fathers praise the Lord so the way of Holiness the New Testament calls it the way and and now this sounds confusing and I want to preach on this this evening there shall be a highway and a way amen and as I was saying commentaries really don't fully you read them they can't seem to get their footing on it it's a little difficult to understand stand but but there's a there's a spiritual symbology here and brother Brandon brought great light to this uh watch this now as we uh out of expectations it said God said in Isaiah 35 there shall be a highway and many of you dear nazarenes used to sing a Highway of Holiness now there shall be a highway and and is a conjunction it ties your sentence together and a way and it should be called the way of Holiness not the Highway of Holiness amen but the way yeah now watch this a correct road is built so water washes the trash to one side or the other and he said you would either be real cold or starchy or fanatic and then he breaks a sentence the way watch this the way is right in the middle of the road right towards Calvary right up the middle of the road so there shall be a highway and a way and the way is the middle of it and the road is made so it's so the water runs to each side of the ditch amen one time brother brandom was preaching and he had said something of this nature and and this manner had come out to speak to what brother brandham was saying and he did not know brother brandham was behind him and he said brother brandham certainly had bad driving ethics as he said that you're driving down the middle of the road and brother brandham was behind him and he didn't know it and brother brandham spoke up and said brother you think too Earthly he said that's a Earthly Road the man said you'll get in a head-on collision if you ride in the middle of the road and brother Bram said I'm not talking Earthly I'm talking Heavenly and this is a oneway road we're not going backwards we're going all the way hallelujah how many believe that he said you got to quit your Earthly thinking this is a one-way road now the way of Holiness is in the middle of the road now not everyone on the highway is going to make it that's right so there is a Highway and there is a bunch of people traveling on it right but the way is in the middle amen if you will pull up the patmas vision I want you to see this here brother bam said you know I've always tried to be this and our Lord has always revealed it to me there's an extreme and another extreme but right in the middle of the Road lays the truth that's right praise the Lord see there are isms in both sides of the ditch and so when he said there is a highway there are people going off the road but there is a way that is right in the middle and he said the Lord revealed this to me there are two ditches right and when you're driving you're constantly correcting yes right amen when you're driving you're constantly moving and I know as a minister as a Christian I have felt this way in times of my life and then after a few years you come over here on the other side and you you has anyone ever experienced that you used to be over here and then life's bitter blows give you maturity and you come over a little bit said if I could go back I wouldn't have been maybe so heavy-handed or I wouldn't have thought it that way you know and all of us that's part of life am that's right and we're driving we're trying to stay right in the middle of the road and you'll find that every truth has two ditches right the godhead you've got trinitarianism over here and you've got Oneness over here but the truth of it is right down the middle of the road you've got marriage and divorce brother brandom said there were two thoughts you've got predestination and you got free choice you've got faith and you've got works and every truth is right in the middle isn't that wonderful praise the Lord now brother brandham said now just like tongues tongues is written in the Bible the Bible said forbid not speaking in tongues but what happened is the Pentecostals began to lean real hard on Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2 and 4 but there's nine spiritual gifts what happened to the other eight but what happens is men begin to lean one way and when they lean one way they end up in the ditch we believe in the whole counsel of God we believe in every word of God can you say amen God send the tongues God send the gifts and brother brandham said if the devil can't keep you from seeing truth he'll make you go overboard with it right every false Doctrine is built off truth amen we can we've seen that in our own in our own ranks and brother brandham said now if you're a little emotional he said you'll go off on this ditch he said if you're a little scholarly and a little intellectual he said you can go off in this ditch and he said now this side will condemn that sideen that's the and so the emotional ones will be throwing off on the starchy ones and the starchy ones will be throwing off on the emotional ones but we can pull from both sides it's amazing the human beings so if we're not careful we can go from the frying pot to the frying pan yes sir amen praise the Lord Brother Brenham said now the first organization was the Catholic Church from 325 ad all the way up to the 1500s with Luther one denomination then Luther was the second brother bandom said Luther was the second denomination and then zwingley broke off this one broke off this one's splintered this one's splintered now we've got 45,000 I think it's more than that 45,000 denominations that splintered off have you seen that Among Us truth comeing a splinter and Splinter and Splinter and it's this everyone will quote a quote and point to the scriptures and then brother Brandon said the Pentecostals split and split and split until they're divided into hundreds and then brother Bram said this he said now have you ever studied the history of Revival a Revival signifies a move of God and power and every time God moves Satan moves also yes sir he said the Welsh Revival he said quickly insane in institutions filled up Wesley day pecul people did peculiar things and and uh Satan was mocking the goodness of God and Luther's day he said the miracle laid in the fact that he could be sound and sane in the midst of Fanatics then listen to this he said have you been aware of this last day Ministry you have noted the same invasion of false Wicked Spirits it has to be that way and I hope you and Trust you're spiritually minded enough to get that to capitalize upon it so I'm not trying to make you suspicious but we should be Discerning that's right and we should start with ourselves it's so easy to judge someone else but it can be kind of hard to judge yourself that's right to check your motives and to search your own heart how many want to be pure-hearted and God lord search me if I'm wrong I want to be right and I don't care what that costs me if I have to humble myself and we can never underestimate the power of Satan to deceive that's it God forbid that that we should underestimate his powers to to come and deceive us we must stay under the word of God as our protection now brother brandom said the two spirits of the last day are formal and fanatical that's right direct quote he said those are the two Spirits he said Satan is always trying to counterfeit and he will shake things before you to get you off track that's right so you must stay with the scriptures amen constantly like like Eve you must stay fortified behind the word of God now brother this is amazing brother brandom said if a man is unstable in the word he's vulnerable to isms that's it amen have you ever seen that some people repeat the mistake if you are not solid in the scriptures that means that you can fall in either ditch you get pulled off to every wind of Doctrine and you're all over the map and we're no stronger than our faith and adherent our adherence to the word of God we need Revelation more than anything we need Revelation by the spirit to discern amen amen Matthew 7: 13 we're in an hour where we have got to put on the full armor of God really know our standing in Christ Matthew 7 verse 13 enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there be which go thereat because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few there be that find it now brother brandham said the Lord was giving a Stern warning to that dispensation amen he said because they thought they were right and they were really struggling with God in flesh right yeah that's right because he was the word made flesh and it was the closing of the Jewish dispensation and they're trying to to grasp it and they're having a hard way to go about this and Jesus tells them enter ye in at the Straight Gate for broad is the way that leads under destruction but narrow is the way that's it that leads to life sometimes we are forced to make a choice of which way we're going to take and a good example of that is Abraham Abraham and lot they had a choice before them and brother brandham said that Abraham chose the harder way and he said lot chose the easier way as he cast his tent toward Sodom he said because things were easy down there he said but many times the easy way is the wrong way he said when you follow Christ you'll be hated and persecuted and all will be against you he said but you must come with your own confession and your own faith in Jesus Christ amen it's not always with the multitude no sir right it's not always easy matter of fact that's when my battles began now he said lot followed the path of popularity yes sir had good job opportunity a lot of money he said he said but he made the wrong choice and brother bandham said that God will bring us to a place where we must make a choice amen of which way we're going to take and the devil will offer you some really good benefits y that's right oh yeah and brother brandham said millions times billions will miss the gate that's right I'm not trying to scare you right but he said millions will go the broad way now watch this narrow way is you and Christ alone that's it now we're for everyone we want everyone to win we want everyone to be saved Jesus is not willing that any would perish but when it comes to this walk it is you and God alone that's right the pastor will point the way the prophet will point the way the Evangelist will point the way the Bible will point the way but at the end of the day it's about you and God God don't make cookie cutters everyone is fearfully and wonderfully made they're made differently and God has a different purpose for every individual now the spirit of organization is the Broadway yes sir it is for years when brother brandham uh preached on denominationalism I thought it was the physical entity right and recent years I realize denominationalism is a spirit and that we must discern the spirits whether they be of God Amen and the only way to do that is by the word do not go with the crowd go with Christ the straight and the narrow way and brother brandham said the straight and narrow way is the middle of the road that's right amen amen how many want to walk with Jesus and go that straight and narrow way may God keep us there now that way is misunderstood when you walk with God you're misunderstood because the spirit don't always make sense right that's it sometimes people accuse you of having different motives and objectives and but walk with God Amen it don't really matter at the end of the day that's right walk with God if you hear from God you stand on that and it it'll come out you may have to bear the reproach of the word but it'll work out praise the Lord the way of Holiness is the word of God amen amen April 11th 1960 brother brandham has an incredible Vision he has a a vision of well just before the one I'm going to speak of this were a couple Visions connected he saw a vision of uh I think three ladies and a man they wanted to build a meeting they were building a building and as they were building it a ray of light came out and and the building exploded and in the vision the men and the women came with nail guns and said we're going to rebuild it and what happened is brother Brandon was pressured to do meetings but God told him don't do it and he said I felt the nudge not to do it but I wanted to help him and he said so I was going to do it anyway and he said when the time came for me to preach he said my throat shut up and he said for nine days days of fever he said I couldn't even whisper and he said I I looked at MAA and said why in the world do this happening go sometimes I wonder if I'm even called 1960 you all don't go through those kind of things just just preachers go through that I thank God brother Brandon was real I tell you if he didn't tell us that we would be discouraged preachers and MAA you know what MAA tells him she says God knows about it she said stop that and she corrected him that's that's right and he said thus sayith the Lord he said men and women will end up at your door and they're going to tell you reschedule the meeting he says they're going to come to the door and brother bandham told it before it happened he said they're going to come to the door he said tell them no and he he refused it so in this vision he saw the wall open up and he saw the blue sky and he said a Bible was in the sky and out of the Bible came a cross and out of the Cross walked the Lord Jesus right out he said I think it was the second or the third time that he ever saw him and Jesus said you're waiting on your commission he goes you just it's already here you've got to accept it he said just like salvation is already here all you got to do is accept it that's right then he says the most incredible thing he's looking for the third pole to be fulfilled his ministry and the Lord said it's already been confir you just got to accept it then he said this you walk with too many that's it he said to walk with the Lord is to walk alone now this is the third poll this is the words the third pole the word coming forth he said to walk with me that's it you must walk alone Hallelujah so now the ranks are thinning brother brandom is now coming to his commission the word but in order to walk with the word he must walk alone he must be un misunderstood he might he's going to be rejected it is a straight and a narrow way but it is the way of Holiness that's right it is a word that'll bring a bride right down the middle of the road it is a word that'll restore the Bible back to the people again Hallelujah to walk with me you walk alone he said you've catered too much to the organizations praise the Lord and I believe that's all of us Amen to walk with this word you will walk alone amen that's right amen that's right now I want I want you to see this brother brandham because he's walking with the word he said I preach against the women all the other Pentecostals are lowering the standards and now they're becoming offended at Holiness Preaching that's if you look at the those old Pentecostal in the 1940s to the 1960s sir it is a drastic change Chang what the Bible never changed hair started getting cut brother brandom Elijah the uncompromising Elijah is pounding it over the pulpit and people are resenting it they love his crowds but they're resenting the preaching just get to the praying amen amen and brother brandom we don't know this until after the seals he's beginning to develop a complex that's right amen yeah it's hurting him because he's walking with the word and to walk with the word you walk alone and now as best friends Jack Moore Gordon Lindsay men that had seen the boy raised from the dead seen Mir countless Miracles the Mexico Miracles the dead baby Rose they saw the prophecy never failed but they still turn away and he said the more I preached the worse it got listen to this he said I became nervous I become I'm a neurotic kind of person I felt insufficient for the job and he said you know I thought God why did you call me I have failed so now because he's an uneducated man he's a bootlegger son he feels like he is failing right he's starting to get a complex he's thinking I'm not the man for the job right brother brandom said I had almost a nervous breakdown two or three times credible see rejection is affecting the prophet rejection affects us amen right sure does we really need to be spiritual at these times to walk with the word amen because this is not a congregation thing and we thank the Lord for the body of Believers you remember brother brandom taught an outer court and inner court and the holies of holies how many remember that the outer court is the message community and man of falls out in that Community but it is about you and God in the holies of holies we cannot stay in the outer courts God's calling us to the hidden life to the land of adoption amen that's right that's exact you in the word alone you in the presence of God Alone Hallelujah it ain't the community sir sir the complex begins to change brother brenham's attitude yes sir you never would have discerned it I couldn't discern it I studied very closely I couldn't discern that this was happening until he tells us about it ex right and he said well if they won't hear me I'll just head off into the mountains you know what he says he said I'll just trap ma up there that's right thousands of miles away from Walmart that's right I'll grow my beard out I'm not going to leave the Lord when God gives me a vision I'll stomp out like Elijah thus sayith the Lord yeah and I'll go back and he said when God ain't using me I'll catch some big fish sounds pretty good you know the story and as brother brandham is driving there God begins to speak to him and he said you have lost the love for the people that's it right there rejection Y and he said I have called you to a much higher office than the prophets of old dear God that's right he said you have lost the love of the people and as brother brandham is is talking about this he refers to an experience that he had in 1961 January in Los Angeles at a men's breakfast he preaches and he said I was tearing the hide off of them and he said Denny Henry who was a Baptist came and put his arm around me and said brother brandom that could have been the 23rd chapter of Revelation and he said he began speaking in tongues knowing knowing nothing of the gifts of the Spirit and then the interpretation came forth as we know there were three people that interpreted it and when it was interpreted it was the spirit speaking because thou H has chosen the narrow way amen the harder way and thou has walked in thine own choosing see he said Moses had to make his Choice yes sir thou has picked the precise and the correct way and he says and a correct decision it is my way amen he said underlined my way the Holy Spirit speaking back because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits you what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself which will make come to pass the tremendous victory of love divine amen amen so when brother Brandon was walking with the word he was walking alone and he was misunderstood and he was rejected and to walk the straight and narrow way amen will cost us something amen amen that's right it will exactly when everyone else says it's okay but you say I'm staying with the word amen amen amen that's right it hurts amen and the rejection is painful yes sir brother brandham said that God has given us a road map to power he said when I have crossed this country so much he said I can tell you how long it'll take me to get to a destination within 15 minutes and sometimes he said I HIIT it right on the dot he said see I've covered it so much I just know it and brother brandham said that's the way God wants us to know this Bible That's Right amen he wants us to covered inside and out I think more than just memorization I think he wants us to know it uh by our experience he said now his road map is our Bible and the Bible road map leads to power and he said and Faith leads you to power and power produces the promise so the way the way of Holiness leads us to power which produces the manifestation of God's word in our life praise the Lord Lord many times people get detoured but the holy spirit will bring us to Pentecost every time I'm talking about reality Pentecostal reality and he said now some people when they're born again he said they sat right in the middle of the road with their eyes on Christ can I go just a few more minutes he said finally they get over on so much knowledge and wisdom that they know it all and he said and you don't know nothing that's right and if you don't do that he said you run off on the other side and have a bunch of wildfire of fanaticism but right in the middle of the road is the true sound unadulterated gospel and power of God he said it's the power of almighty God not fanaticism or formality it is the power of God he said the great Heroes of Faith have walked the middle of the road pulling from both sides not fighting the other side but ping from both sides how many can say amen and when we stand on the word the mountain will crumble when we stand on the word the sickness will crumble when we stand on the word the Red Sea will move back and Devils will tremble when you stand on the word hallelujah everything will fall to your left or to your right and he said just stay with the word the moving of the holy spirit is in the middle of the road amen that's where the moving of the spirit happens is when you walk the straight and the narrow way amise don't follow the crowd amen right let God speak to you amen amen let God speak to you as an individual how to dress how to conduct yourself how to walk amen you believe that brother brandom said brother there's a middle of the road there's where the true gospel is preached and real Bible signs and wonders are following the real Sweet Holy Spirit leads the church that's the kind of church to go to an intelligent Church preaching the word standing on the word with a full whole gospel sermon the real spirit of God everything in the spirit everything decent everybody in order everything in love that's the kind of church we want how many would say amen that's the kind of Christian I want to be I want to be right down the middle of the road the Bible tells us Hebrews 11:5 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and he was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God for without faith it's impossible to please God and he that cometh of God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek himen the Bible tells us that all the days of Enoch was 365 years so that means that that Enoch did not start walking with God till he was 65 that's when Enoch made his first step 65 years praise the Lord anyone over 65 here how sad that's pitiful they're like that's something to be proud of the keeping power of God that's that's wonderful that's that's near the age when Enoch started walking with God there was a time he took his first step remember your first step 300 years he walked with God 300 years of faithfulness and Enoch means dedicated amen committed amen devoted faithful wholehearted singl minded how many want to be Enoch Enoch walked with God but but he had to First make a step and to walk with God you must walk with the word amen that's right every individual that walks with God walks with the word that means walking in the light of the age walking in the message of the hour and Enoch never missed one word he amened the word of God when God revealed it to him he rejoiced in it and he walked in it and we can only walk with the word when we agree with the word your heart says amen how many say Amen to the message Enoch was a type of the seventh age that's right that we would walk with God God would have a bride that walked with God and he pleased God because he believed God and he walked with the word of God that's a type of you amen that's a type of me that's a type of the raptured group and brother Ram said Enoch kep every word he said how many Enochs would there be today when God speaks in 1 Corinthians 11 about our hair or Deuteronomy 225 in our dress or or you know walking in the light of the word of God he said how many Enochs would we have he said but notice Jesus walked with the word amen he was the word he said he walked unconscious he believed what God Said was true and the words must be fulfilled and he know that his life was to fulfill them he said and you're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism amen walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying attention to the right or to the left just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God if your neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep walking with God Enoch one day walked like that and you know what he done he walked all the way home to be with God he said he got so far up the road he did not want to come back again he said walk with God doctor says you're going to D die walk with God he said now God God promised you I'll never leave you nor forsake you you have your ups and downs don't worry you're going to go through Brier patches right you're going to go over sharp rocks and Bluffs and hillsides and through the mountains and over the waters but walk with God one time he was walking he was just 300 years of Walking with God and brother brandham said all of a sudden gravitation begin to let go how many are looking forward to that day Pastor Paul comes out preaching the word and all of a sudden you feel yourself going through the ceiling walk with God one of these days gravitation will lose its hold and he said he left this path he he said he kissed his wife goodbye and he walked down an old familiar path he said and all of a sudden he started stepping up until he stepped up on the King's Highway and he said he walked with God until he left and he was into the presence of the Lord amen GL there shall be a highway yes and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness amen he said a good road is built the highest part is in the center and it lets the trash wash off both sides and when a man really comes to Christ and got his eyes centered on Christ he said if he's a little emotional he'll be fanatic if he's a little cold he said be on the other side just be a cucumber over there on the other side he said but the main thing is in the middle of the road with enough spirit in you to keep you warm and moving amen amen knowing enough to keep yourself under The Obedience of the spirit just as the spirit moves you not till or not after but just as the spirit moves you amen amen you see when a man is converted his eyes is set towards couch Calvary he if he's a little nervous he don't watch he said he'll go to The Fanatic side if he's a little scholar he'll becomeing the starchy side but right in the middle of the road is the same sane sensible Born Again Spirit Le endowed Church of the Living God right straight down the road to Christ the real coming from both sides one went one way one went the other shows fanaticism scholarly two stiff bow he said but they know more about the word than they do the author to know the word is not life that's it but to know him that's right is life how many say Lord I want to be balanced that's it I want to be a balanced man yes sir I want to be quick to hear and slow to speak that's it Lord I want to be solid I want to be sane I want to be mature amen I want to be Discerning Lord I want to be patient Lord how many say Lord keep me in the middle of the road let me walk in the way of Holiness let me walk with God yes sir yes sir let us stand our feet I want to walk with God I want to be solid Lord I want to be a word man I want to be a man of the word I want to be a woman woman of the word we want to be a church of the word amen amen I want to please God Enoch please God because he believed God we just take a moment as the musicians would like to come just just bow our heads in his presence just on a Wednesday night on a middle of a work week our minds can sometimes be so distracted from the busyness of the day let's just take a moment just to talk to the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we just coming out of Isaiah 35 Lord to many people there's no grasp of what that is saying you've sent a message Lord to show us the bride how she should walk in the middle of the road where there's just enough room for you and her we thank the prophet when you said why don't you walk with me Lord we want communion with the Holy Spirit Lord May the spirit of Truth direct our hearts to walk in the scriptures I pray Lord God for each and every one as we know Lord that we are capable of getting complexes we are capable of going off into either ditch Lord would you help us tonight is we're different creatures and you know your creature Lord would you stabilize Our Hearts by the Holy Spirit make us pure in our thoughts and our minds help us to be neutral in our position and not leaning to one side or the other but Lord letting the spirit guide us down the middle of the way God I pray that you would help us not to buckle to the pressure of the crowds and the expectations lord of the crowd but Lord may we walk with you may we walk with this message Lord may we keep our eyes on you and not on everything around us I pray May the spirit of God move upon every heart give us understand understanding of this Lord I ask in jesus' name that the Holy Spirit would move over every heart in such a way Lord that you'll just give us solid footing under our footsteps and Lord that you'd help us to make another step of Faith dear God bless your people Lord bless your people Lord that want to be in that Kingdom we want to be there with you together and knowing there will be millions that will go off under the broad way and end up in the ditch Lord Keep Us by your keeping power thank you for a message to keep us in the middle of the road help us not to get out of Step Lord I pray in Jesus name you give us Grace and we ask it in Jesus mighty name amen amen uh can I have someone help me sing that this song can you sing that what is that sorry brother I didn't mean to put you on the spot everybody love the Lord if you'll sing that for me brother blow through me holyy Spirit flow through me that's our prayer Lord flow through me Holy

hour Spirit Lord through me we lift our hands Lord as I my hands to worship and to magnify Thy Name Lord yes Lord ohly Spirit through me I think something that we can all benefit from was brother brandom's transparency amen that a prophet of God that had 30 to 40 Visions a day and spoke to God in ways that most men will never would actually be so transparent as to say I developed a complex because the people would not receive me and if and I thank God for that because he's showing the humanity is our weakness and that every one of us can be that way every one of us and it can cause us to misstep and it isn't sinful desire it isn't like I want to sit on a bar stool or you want to sit on a bar but it it is our human weakness that the devil attacks and I thank God that he he showed us this because it shows that we must stay under the influence of the word coming to church is so important to stay under the influence of the word to listen to the message and not look at the crowd don't follow the crowd follow the word of God God how many would say Lord just keep me right on that narrow way and that is Jesus said that is my way sometimes you'll be misunderstood and you'll be rejected sometime you may not be pop but you'll find it's God's way which is the harder way do you love the Lord tonight everybody appreciate the word of the Lord let's just give the Lord a hand clap
