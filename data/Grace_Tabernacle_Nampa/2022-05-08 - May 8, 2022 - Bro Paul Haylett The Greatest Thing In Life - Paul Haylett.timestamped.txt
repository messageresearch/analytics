[41:02] in our church we're looking forward to
[41:05] voices crying out in a language that we
[41:08] don't understand but they do
[41:10] and to see them rising up you see my
[41:13] brother and sister if the lord tarries
[41:17] many more years there'll be a whole new
[41:19] generation rise up and there has to be
[41:21] those of the word for their generation
[41:24] that overcome the circumstance of the
[41:27] age
[41:28] and so god is still bringing forth that
[41:31] generation
[41:32] and we say thank you for that lord and

[41:39] each and every one of you

[41:48] hugging but
[41:51] god bless you we love you and i thank
[41:53] you
[41:54] saints that
[41:55] i get to this is just from my heart i
[41:57] get to come to church
[42:00] and and go to church as it were with a
[42:02] group of people that love the lord amen
[42:05] we're not here because there's some kind
[42:07] of
[42:08] a reward for attendance
[42:11] there is actually a reward for
[42:13] attendance amen but that comes in
[42:15] another way and we're not here just to
[42:17] be socially gathered together or compare
[42:19] our latest fashions
[42:21] but we're here because there is
[42:23] something burning down in our soul that
[42:25] we want to serve the lord we want to be
[42:28] found in his presence we we want to be
[42:31] able to express ourselves
[42:34] and as i spoke to the church wednesday
[42:36] night sometimes we come to church and
[42:38] we're under a great burden
[42:40] the cares of life are strong and the
[42:42] devil would try to tell you you're a
[42:44] hypocrite because somewhere in the
[42:45] service you start to rejoice and you're
[42:48] praising god but my brother and sister
[42:50] we're not hypocrites
[42:52] and we are not imposters
[42:54] but when you come into the presence of
[42:57] the king of peace
[42:58] when you come into the presence of
[43:00] almighty god you say well i i had an
[43:04] attitude when i came to church and it's
[43:06] gone now that's because you came in his
[43:08] presence
[43:10] and he takes that away from us and takes
[43:12] that burden from us and
[43:14] we get to come and just worship the lord
[43:17] and come into his
[43:20] presence
[43:24] god bless you brother
[43:26] yannick sister sharon

[44:07] of what we're going to do but brother
[44:09] george gave me permission he says
[44:11] brother paul i'll be there to do

[44:30] things in my mind i do want to pass them
[44:32] before brother george and not blindside
[44:34] him so uh but may 20th to the 22nd and
[44:39] uh
[44:40] i also have you know normally
[44:42] i don't know
[44:43] how to put this but
[44:45] i had a very good visit with brother
[44:47] dwayne and sister coney fair yesterday
[44:49] and they were traveling
[44:51] and
[44:52] they're going to try to come into the
[44:54] states
[44:55] uh sometime in this next week
[44:58] and um
[45:00] if they can make it brother dwayne is
[45:03] not vaccinated which almost in this day
[45:06] and age we live in is like
[45:10] but
[45:12] he's desiring if they'll let him into
[45:14] the states they're going to come
[45:16] and
[45:17] lord willie
[45:19] this coming sunday
[45:21] um
[45:22] this coming sunday if um they can make
[45:25] it in the states
[45:26] i've asked brother duane if he would
[45:28] minister for us
[45:29] and now this is presumptuous and sounds
[45:32] but i
[45:33] i'll just throw it out here right now
[45:35] if brother dwayne cannot make it i'm
[45:38] asking my brother david to take the next
[45:40] sunday
[45:41] um
[45:42] so we just want to take advantage of
[45:44] this opportunity of brother dwayne
[45:46] coming through
[45:47] on their way to see their daughter and
[45:49] grandchildren oh and son-in-law amen
[45:53] so
[45:58] yeah just please continue to lift up our
[46:00] family
[46:01] amen
[46:03] um
[46:04] you know there's something the lord laid
[46:06] on my heart and kind of unique i
[46:08] struggle to title it
[46:10] until i come across a quote which we
[46:11] will share with you today
[46:14] that
[46:15] touched my heart and just confirmed
[46:18] my my thought was very close
[46:20] but when i got to see it as it were in
[46:22] print it struck me and i knew that's the
[46:24] right thing and i want to speak to you
[46:27] this morning on the greatest thing in
[46:29] life
[46:30] now we could put an s on that because
[46:33] actually we're going to be preaching in
[46:34] plural this morning but the greatest
[46:37] thing we know is jesus christ god bless
[46:40] you sister emmy
[46:42] sean and brother jason
[46:45] the song service i said after present
[46:47] jason come out i started crying
[46:50] every song that was played the special
[46:52] that was sung this morning or the song
[46:55] service this morning every bit of it
[46:57] spoke to me i was like thank you lord
[47:00] i just uh just
[47:02] the thanksgiving that i could give to
[47:04] the lord for speaking to our hearts
[47:07] amen and as we look at this and and i i
[47:11] just want to say thank you to our
[47:13] brother chris as he mentioned he called
[47:15] me yesterday and he says brother paul i
[47:17] know you're under a great burden
[47:19] is there anything i can do
[47:21] to take that help take that burden away
[47:24] if you need me to minister you need
[47:25] anything done i'm here to take that away
[47:28] and i say thank you brother chris
[47:30] amen just the the blessings of god uh
[47:34] every word that's been spoken this
[47:35] morning has spoken to me
[47:37] so we could take this and take it from
[47:39] the greatest thing in our life which is
[47:41] jesus christ but taking the prophet's
[47:43] words we can come in and we could make
[47:45] that plural the greatest things in our
[47:48] life because it's absolutely singular in
[47:51] the sense that god is over all things
[47:54] he's in control of all things he has
[47:57] predestinated ordained all things but he
[48:00] has allowed it to be broken down into a
[48:03] different you might say uh uh a pieces
[48:06] or or um oh i don't know i'm struggling
[48:08] for the word but to be broken down to
[48:11] come to us and bless us in different
[48:14] ways in different seasons and in
[48:16] different things and and i'm thankful
[48:18] today and i just pray that we'll be able
[48:21] to speak the word in such a fashion to
[48:23] bless you today let's turn in our bibles
[48:26] to the book of revelation the 21st
[48:28] chapter
[48:30] amen now i want to be very presumptuous
[48:32] this morning parents
[48:36] parents with young children i should say
[48:40] i had a epiphany
[48:42] at grace kids friday evening
[48:47] now if there's misunderstanding here or
[48:49] lack of communication i will accept the
[48:52] blame so please don't
[48:54] become upset
[48:57] but when i ask the children about the
[48:58] ten commandments
[49:02] i got a lot of blank looks
[49:05] parents i ask you
[49:08] make sure
[49:09] no matter how young they are
[49:12] that the ten commandments
[49:15] might be old testament but it's not an
[49:18] old word
[49:22] step in make sure your children know
[49:25] work with him
[49:27] i'm not i've never been one to be able
[49:29] to memorize things very well i remember
[49:31] as a kid i struggled terribly
[49:34] whether it was church
[49:36] vacation bible school whatever the
[49:38] situation would be that they wanted you
[49:40] to memorize things i pretty much just
[49:42] wanted to quit and go away because the
[49:44] minute i stood up in front of other kids
[49:47] or an instructor or whatever i i just
[49:50] blank slate forgot every drop
[49:53] but i would encourage you in your own
[49:55] home in your own place there to anchor
[49:58] these things
[49:59] in their hearts
[50:01] the gospel of jesus christ is reflected
[50:04] in the ten commandments
[50:07] amen
[50:10] and i saw
[50:12] a new heaven and a new earth
[50:14] for the first heaven the first earth
[50:16] were passed away
[50:18] and there was no more sea
[50:20] and i john saw the holy city
[50:23] new jerusalem coming down from god out
[50:26] of heaven
[50:27] prepared
[50:29] as a bride adorned for her husband
[50:33] now if i could just step out be slightly
[50:35] precise this morning
[50:37] i believe john was looking down to this
[50:39] age and seeing the bride of this last
[50:41] day
[50:42] clothed in the word of god
[50:45] amen because he saw the age that was
[50:48] going to come and actually be presented
[50:51] as a bride
[50:53] now through the ages all of those ages
[50:56] thought that that was the imminent
[50:57] coming of the lord
[50:59] but there is an imminent coming of the
[51:01] lord
[51:02] and we are i believe with all of my
[51:04] heart in that season
[51:07] amen
[51:09] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[51:11] saying behold the tabernacle of god is
[51:14] with men
[51:15] and he will dwell with them
[51:17] and they shall be his people and god
[51:20] himself shall be with them and be their
[51:23] god
[51:24] this is not a distant god saints this is
[51:26] not a god out in the ether
[51:29] this is not a god sitting high on a
[51:31] throne somewhere with no care about your
[51:34] life this is a god that is going to be
[51:37] with you and in you and not only in you
[51:40] but he's going to possess you
[51:48] once upon a time a man was speeding and
[51:50] was pulled over by a police officer
[51:54] and the police officer come and says sir
[51:56] you were driving excessively
[51:58] excessively enough that you could be
[52:00] arrested
[52:01] and the man told the policeman he says
[52:02] be careful what you do i am a friend of
[52:06] the governor
[52:07] and the policeman stood there for a
[52:09] moment looking at him
[52:11] and said so sir you say your friend of
[52:13] the governor yes i am
[52:15] is the governor
[52:16] your friend
[52:21] we stand today
[52:23] not only claiming jesus christ as lord
[52:25] and savior but we can claim him as
[52:28] husband as bridegroom we can claim him
[52:31] as having possessed us
[52:34] oh hallelujah
[52:43] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[52:45] their eyes
[52:46] there shall be no more death
[52:49] neither sorrow nor crying
[52:51] neither shall there be any more pain for
[52:53] the former things are passed away
[52:56] and he that sat upon the throne said
[52:58] behold i make all things new and he said
[53:01] unto me right
[53:02] for these words are true
[53:05] and faithful
[53:07] and he said unto me
[53:09] oh hallelujah
[53:11] it is done amen hallelujah the very key
[53:16] words in our lord jesus christ spoke at
[53:18] calvary when he said it is finished
[53:22] my brother and sister what's he doing
[53:23] he's declaring to you and i don't worry
[53:27] about the end result i've took care of
[53:29] it
[53:30] it's done
[53:32] hallelujah
[53:34] oh my i get excited this evening this
[53:38] morning whenever it was
[53:40] it is done i'm alpha and omega the
[53:42] beginning and the end and i will give
[53:44] unto him that is a thirst of the
[53:46] fountain of the water of life freely he
[53:48] that overcometh shall inherit all things
[53:51] and i will be his god and he shall be my
[53:54] son but they're fearful see what satan's
[53:56] trying to do we've preached on this
[53:58] before but i felt led to just take the
[54:01] thought today from here
[54:04] satan is trying to make you fearful
[54:08] but the fearful and the unbelieving and
[54:10] abominable and murderers and
[54:12] whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters
[54:14] and all liars have their part in the
[54:17] lake which burneth with fire and
[54:18] brimstone which is the second death
[54:22] i want you to look at verse 8 real
[54:24] careful
[54:25] is there anything in verse 8 that god
[54:27] will not forgive us
[54:31] not one thing
[54:33] in verse 8 that god will not forgive us
[54:35] of
[54:37] so the reason these people will burn
[54:39] in the lake
[54:41] is because they wouldn't come
[54:43] and submit
[54:44] to the blood of jesus christ
[54:47] in other words
[54:49] their choice
[54:52] the welcome mat is out
[54:54] the light is on the door is open
[54:56] but some people will refuse
[54:59] to be a participant of the word of god i
[55:02] say today lord help us surrender lord
[55:05] help us be humbled help us lay ourselves
[55:08] down
[55:09] hallelujah
[55:11] oh
[55:13] hallelujah
[55:14] and there came unto me one of the seven
[55:16] angels
[55:18] which had the seven vowels full of the
[55:20] seven last plagues
[55:22] and talked with me saying come hither
[55:25] i will show thee
[55:27] the bride
[55:28] the lamb's wife
[55:30] oh hallelujah
[55:32] thank you lord jesus this morning
[55:35] your grace your mercy your kindness to
[55:37] us
[55:38] father open your word to us like never
[55:41] before
[55:43] lord we just come this morning and
[55:44] surrender to your will to your guidance
[55:48] lord help us to be quiet
[55:51] and wait on you
[55:53] father that you could speak to our souls
[55:56] in a world lord that is increasingly
[55:58] busy increasingly loud
[56:01] increasingly
[56:03] disruptive
[56:06] lord help us to find a quiet peace
[56:09] a quiet place
[56:11] to discover your presence
[56:15] touch us with your word this morning i
[56:16] ask in the name of jesus christ amen it
[56:20] may be seated saints
[56:25] it is good to each and every one of you
[56:28] you know
[56:29] it's easy to say we have visitors but we
[56:31] don't really have visitors because
[56:33] every son and daughter of god is part of
[56:35] the body of christ and
[56:37] we just claim that we claim our position
[56:40] in the body of christ so those who have
[56:42] not fellowshipped amongst us in the past
[56:45] i say god bless you and welcome and i
[56:46] pray the lord would bless you today
[56:49] amen
[56:50] as we look through the word saints
[56:52] we can see this wonderful plan of god
[56:55] isn't that it's amazing you know house
[56:57] to some people all things are negative
[56:59] they opened the bible i remember talking
[57:01] to a man one time he says well i don't
[57:03] even like reading the bible and i i just
[57:05] couldn't help but ask him why and he
[57:07] says well it said i'm going to hell
[57:11] now that's a pretty strong statement my
[57:12] brother and sister because i picked up
[57:14] this same word the same book that he did
[57:16] and it told me i was going to heaven
[57:19] and so it's there and that perspective
[57:21] that we take to the word of god is
[57:24] determining what we see amen
[57:26] and so you know it is there that we have
[57:29] to look through the word and we see this
[57:31] beautiful this wonderful plan of god and
[57:34] you know we start in genesis and i
[57:36] struggled in placing these notes because
[57:38] i wanted to lay this foundation out but
[57:41] i didn't want it to come negative on
[57:43] mother's day to preach about eve
[57:46] you know it would be like oh my now
[57:49] where are we going with this but we'll
[57:51] lay a little foundation my brother and
[57:52] sister that you can see the beauty of
[57:55] the position god chose for you in the
[57:58] body of christ amen he didn't choose you
[58:00] as a failure he didn't choose you as
[58:02] what transgressor but he chose you as
[58:05] his very wife the lamb's wife amen so we
[58:09] start in genesis and we see this uh
[58:11] display of god's creative power isn't
[58:14] that incredible i i was just thinking
[58:16] about this and and on on my computer in
[58:19] the offices is uh uh the you know photo
[58:23] whatever you call it just constantly
[58:25] different photos going across the screen
[58:27] and uh to see beautiful places that the
[58:29] lord has blessed us to travel and and to
[58:32] be and you know it just reinforced in my
[58:34] heart how that this creation of our lord
[58:37] jesus christ uh almighty god made this
[58:40] creation and how it is so beautiful you
[58:43] go and you see the sun rise you see the
[58:46] sun sets you see the mirror of a
[58:48] mountain lake and you see all these
[58:50] things and there's something stirs
[58:52] within us and you know we we just
[58:54] recognize this display of god's creative
[58:56] power and you look at this and if you
[58:59] just stop for a moment and was to think
[59:01] about the most beautiful thing that you
[59:03] have ever seen and realize that it is
[59:05] only a foretaste of the beauty that is
[59:08] in our lord jesus christ it is only a
[59:10] down payment of the beauty of uh serving
[59:14] our god amen and so as it's there we
[59:16] recognize that these beautiful things
[59:20] and when we see genesis the third
[59:23] chapter
[59:26] some might get the impression things
[59:28] went sideways
[59:30] get the impression that this beautiful
[59:33] plan of god that was starting out
[59:36] somehow got derailed and how that satan
[59:39] had wormed his way in and and brought a
[59:42] destruction and satan would like to
[59:45] remind now those of you that weren't
[59:47] here wednesday night
[59:48] we have to go back just for one moment
[59:51] just a little bit and and be reminded
[59:53] now that in spite of satan's rebellion
[59:56] he got kicked out of heaven and cast to
[1:00:00] the earth and woe to the inhabitants of
[1:00:02] the earth but you see the holy spirit
[1:00:04] god himself was poured into the
[1:00:07] inhabitants or some of the inhabitants
[1:00:09] of the earth and satan got down here and
[1:00:11] recognized the same adversary he faced
[1:00:14] in heaven he is facing today and the
[1:00:18] same adversary that whipped him in
[1:00:20] heaven is here on the earth today and
[1:00:23] god chose to put himself or pour himself
[1:00:26] into you and i as vessels of honor
[1:00:30] hallelujah and that's why we can come
[1:00:32] and when satan thinks he has advantage
[1:00:34] my brother and sister god comes right on
[1:00:36] the scene and anoints you god comes
[1:00:39] right on the scene and empowers you god
[1:00:41] comes down and reminds you of the things
[1:00:44] that you already know that you would be
[1:00:46] able to stand and say that's right i'm a
[1:00:48] son of god i'm a daughter of god and
[1:00:51] satan is already defeated
[1:00:54] i'm not looking for victory come on
[1:00:56] saints i want you to understand this i'm
[1:00:58] not here this morning looking for
[1:01:01] victory i already have victory in the
[1:01:04] name of jesus christ i don't have to
[1:01:07] hope that i can be an overcomer
[1:01:10] i already am an overcomer by the word of
[1:01:14] god
[1:01:15] and problem is as we look at what's
[1:01:17] right in front of us
[1:01:19] we look right in front of us and that's
[1:01:20] all we see but we've got to lift our
[1:01:22] eyes and say god has a plan
[1:01:25] god has a plan for me
[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:30] yes sir do you know if you drive a car
[1:01:32] down the road and you're one of those
[1:01:33] kind i'm sure there's someone here like
[1:01:35] that today and i don't mean it
[1:01:36] derogatory but do you ever follow a car
[1:01:39] and you see it it kind of bebops from
[1:01:41] line to line and seems to wander all
[1:01:43] over the place
[1:01:44] you know they're not necessarily
[1:01:46] inattentive
[1:01:48] professional drivers will tell you
[1:01:50] they're looking at the road too close
[1:01:53] in front of their car
[1:01:55] if they would lift their eyes
[1:01:57] and look out in front of them
[1:01:59] they would drive a much truer path on
[1:02:02] the road
[1:02:03] and that's sometimes how christians
[1:02:05] believers kind of bobbing right and left
[1:02:08] in their life and sometimes as a pastor
[1:02:11] you get a little nervous
[1:02:12] or are they are they anchored well my
[1:02:14] brother and sister i'm going to believe
[1:02:16] they're real sons and daughters of god
[1:02:18] i'm not going to judge them otherwise
[1:02:20] but i do believe i will declare they're
[1:02:22] looking too close in front of them
[1:02:24] they're not looking out at the plan of
[1:02:26] god for their life they're looking at
[1:02:27] their circumstance which is the pavement
[1:02:30] that disappears under the hood of your
[1:02:31] car
[1:02:40] so genesis 3 happens and
[1:02:43] many people express it and i i'm
[1:02:45] learning to not take everything that
[1:02:47] everybody says as concrete because i
[1:02:50] have made statements in such a fashion
[1:02:52] that taken as concrete would leave one
[1:02:54] to believe that paul had a problem here
[1:02:56] there whatever
[1:02:58] so i'm learning i'm learning that that
[1:03:00] this plan of god isn't what paul thinks
[1:03:04] it's not what this one thinks or this
[1:03:06] church thinks but it is what god thinks
[1:03:09] amen so it is that satan uh you know
[1:03:13] coming there in the garden and and uh
[1:03:16] coming as it were and he starts to come
[1:03:19] up and as the scripture says he beguiles
[1:03:22] eve
[1:03:23] now my brother and sister we'll look at
[1:03:25] that and it seems like oh what a utopia
[1:03:27] we would live in if that hadn't happened
[1:03:30] but you see god saw this great big
[1:03:33] picture he saw something so much greater
[1:03:36] than you and i amen as it would be we
[1:03:39] would not see the expression of the
[1:03:41] saints of old that were willing to die
[1:03:43] for their faith we would not have seen
[1:03:45] the supernatural power as the apostle
[1:03:48] paul being bitten by the serpent we
[1:03:50] would not see those that were willing to
[1:03:52] sacrifice all for the gospel we would
[1:03:54] have saw none of that but those are
[1:03:56] attributes that god desired to be
[1:03:59] expressed and god said i'm not doing
[1:04:01] this to be as it were cruel to my
[1:04:04] children but i'm doing this that the
[1:04:06] power that is in me who i am might be
[1:04:09] expressed to the world that they could
[1:04:11] see just truly how great their god is
[1:04:14] but i want you to catch this now it's
[1:04:18] also that we could see just how great
[1:04:21] god is in us
[1:04:23] amen if we're sitting here thinking
[1:04:26] we're little puppets little muppets
[1:04:28] little something to be manipulated
[1:04:30] you've missed the whole point of god god
[1:04:32] looking for someone he could pour
[1:04:35] himself into that could manifest the
[1:04:37] word of god and prove to satan once and
[1:04:40] for all it was not just a chance that he
[1:04:43] was defeated and cast out but it was the
[1:04:46] plan of god
[1:04:48] i say thank you lord we're here this
[1:04:50] morning because of a plan
[1:04:53] not an accident just say well i was born
[1:04:55] in a church i was born in a family in
[1:04:58] this that believed in god i was this
[1:05:00] that had nothing to do with it god chose
[1:05:03] you for who you are
[1:05:07] oh that's why our children must rise up
[1:05:09] and they must have a personal experience
[1:05:12] with the lord because mama and dad can't
[1:05:14] get them in a rapture mom and dad cannot
[1:05:17] pave the way for them but mom and dad
[1:05:20] can do the word of god as we spoke to
[1:05:22] the kids the other night and they can
[1:05:24] train their children up and believe that
[1:05:27] promise when god said you train the
[1:05:29] child up he will not depart
[1:05:32] people say about my my child he's
[1:05:33] backslid he's gone
[1:05:35] well i'll tell you what i was just
[1:05:37] talking with a brother
[1:05:38] recently
[1:05:40] he started to share with me what's
[1:05:41] happening in their church
[1:05:45] he said people
[1:05:46] sometimes don't know how to respond i've
[1:05:48] spoke this in this church
[1:05:51] but a young man
[1:05:55] it's all tattooed up
[1:05:58] he said he looks rough
[1:06:02] looks just really rough
[1:06:05] come in the house of god just a few
[1:06:07] weeks ago
[1:06:10] gave his heart back to the lord
[1:06:13] is he any less a christian than you and
[1:06:15] i because he's got tattoos
[1:06:18] no sir this right here my brother and
[1:06:20] sister is going to be left behind it is
[1:06:24] the soul that god valued and then he's
[1:06:27] sharing these things that's happening
[1:06:29] how they're having baptism of young men
[1:06:32] and women that have been raised up in
[1:06:34] the church and backslidded stages in
[1:06:36] their life and god is coming back to
[1:06:38] them and wooing them
[1:06:41] oh don't tell me god has lost his touch
[1:06:45] that god's plan has been derailed
[1:06:48] oh look at this and i'm telling you i'll
[1:06:51] just be bold
[1:06:52] i'll be bold my brother and sister i'm
[1:06:55] claiming the holy ghost for everybody
[1:06:58] inside this body of believers we are not
[1:07:01] going to let satan have one
[1:07:04] not one
[1:07:07] amen we have a promise and i've chosen
[1:07:10] we were just discussing this and my
[1:07:12] brother and sister look if we're
[1:07:14] believers we're believers and if we're
[1:07:16] anything else we're unbelievers
[1:07:18] i was called to be a believer
[1:07:21] i wasn't called to have some lukewarm
[1:07:24] straddle defense relationship with god
[1:07:26] i'm not here to say why doesn't god
[1:07:29] answer my prayer while i live any old
[1:07:31] kind of life i want to live i want
[1:07:35] my god to answer my prayer so i'm going
[1:07:37] to meet god's qualification
[1:07:41] forget about this it's too hard
[1:07:45] hallelujah
[1:07:47] reminds me of a story i read about a
[1:07:49] young man going through military
[1:07:50] training become a 101st airborne in the
[1:07:53] us army
[1:07:54] and uh somebody asked him he says um
[1:07:57] what was it like the first time you
[1:07:59] jumped out of an airplane
[1:08:01] he said i didn't jump
[1:08:05] no you have your
[1:08:06] you have your parachute badge you jump
[1:08:08] to an airplane no he says my sergeant
[1:08:11] threw me out
[1:08:16] i pray god would just overcome
[1:08:18] our reservation
[1:08:20] oh i don't want to be presumptuous but
[1:08:21] maybe god would adore or ordain me to
[1:08:24] come and be the one that throws you out
[1:08:26] of the airplane
[1:08:27] hallelujah i wouldn't want to be rude i
[1:08:29] wouldn't want to be out of place but my
[1:08:31] brother and sister whatever it takes
[1:08:34] that we can get our wings
[1:08:36] whatever it takes to be able to find
[1:08:40] faith in the word of god
[1:08:42] hallelujah
[1:08:44] that man went on to be one of the
[1:08:46] uh
[1:08:47] more decorated not the most but more
[1:08:49] decorated soldiers
[1:08:52] this served in
[1:08:54] in world war ii
[1:08:56] my brother and sister
[1:08:59] if we could just see what god has in
[1:09:00] store for us
[1:09:02] we could just see what god really wants
[1:09:05] us to be
[1:09:07] how precious that would be
[1:09:12] now satan
[1:09:13] got cast out of heaven he lost the
[1:09:15] battle
[1:09:17] and he's believing that he can do the
[1:09:18] same thing in this day believes he can
[1:09:20] come down right
[1:09:22] first adam and eve
[1:09:24] prophet of god speaks of these things we
[1:09:26] come down to the second adam
[1:09:28] amen there's an eve as it were in this
[1:09:31] day and satan's believing he can come
[1:09:34] and usurp his own beguiling ways to the
[1:09:37] bride of this age but what he's missed
[1:09:39] my brother and sister is the same word
[1:09:41] as i already said the same word amen
[1:09:44] that was there is here now but what he's
[1:09:47] really missed
[1:09:49] is this bride of this age has become the
[1:09:52] word
[1:09:53] we're not looking for a word to come
[1:09:55] deliver us my brother and sister the
[1:09:57] word is already here it's already in me
[1:10:01] it's already in you
[1:10:04] oh we stumble and we fall and satan says
[1:10:07] i got you but my brother and sister we
[1:10:10] have resurrection life amen we might
[1:10:13] stumble but we rise again amen satan
[1:10:16] might think you're defeated but we rise
[1:10:19] again
[1:10:21] whoa hallelujah
[1:10:23] oh
[1:10:24] my
[1:10:25] amen amen
[1:10:31] lamb's wife she's so in love with him
[1:10:38] you know i love to read and i'm sorry i
[1:10:39] just throw these little things in
[1:10:43] reminds me
[1:10:45] of a story i read once
[1:10:48] about relationships
[1:10:54] young man and young woman on their
[1:10:55] honeymoon worldly people
[1:10:57] on their honeymoon
[1:10:59] and a real hanson debonair man comes up
[1:11:07] says hey i want to dance with you
[1:11:09] speaking to this young man's wife
[1:11:11] very pretty girl i want to dance with
[1:11:13] you
[1:11:14] she looks up at her husband
[1:11:17] and she says okay
[1:11:19] her husband's stunned
[1:11:22] he's
[1:11:24] stunned but she walks this man across
[1:11:27] the floor
[1:11:29] kind of over where no one's at
[1:11:33] and proceeds to tell him who do you
[1:11:35] think you are
[1:11:38] to come into my life
[1:11:40] with your charm
[1:11:42] with your seducing voice and all that
[1:11:45] you have thinking that you could come
[1:11:48] you see this ring
[1:11:50] this says i belong to him
[1:11:55] and turns and walks back
[1:11:57] and her husband's like did you change
[1:11:59] your mind she says no my mind was made
[1:12:01] up
[1:12:03] already
[1:12:05] oh hallelujah i got my mind made up and
[1:12:09] i won't turn back
[1:12:11] hallelujah
[1:12:13] that's the kind of bride that's on the
[1:12:15] earth on this day right here this is a
[1:12:18] reflection of genesis the third chapter
[1:12:21] and it's filled with the holy ghost
[1:12:24] empowering a bride that says whoa devil
[1:12:27] you seduce me once you won't do it again
[1:12:30] i'm uh married see the ring i belong to
[1:12:34] him
[1:12:37] i hope you don't mind i'll get a little
[1:12:38] excited this morning
[1:12:40] amen you know we sing that song he's got
[1:12:43] it all in control
[1:12:45] we either believe it
[1:12:47] or we don't
[1:12:49] i personally saints and i hope each one
[1:12:51] of you can lift a hand or lift your
[1:12:52] heart and say i believe it
[1:12:55] i'm not here to be seduced by the devil
[1:12:58] to break a vow i made to god i am sold
[1:13:01] out
[1:13:03] oh hallelujah and i'm not only sold out
[1:13:07] i'm in love with him
[1:13:09] this is not a meal ticket for me this is
[1:13:11] not some avenue for a better life i'm in
[1:13:14] love with him and whether it's for
[1:13:16] richer or for poor for better or for
[1:13:19] worse for health and all what my brother
[1:13:22] and sister i'm sold out
[1:13:24] that's where my position is
[1:13:27] hallelujah
[1:13:28] now look i shared this quote on
[1:13:30] wednesday but it just struck my heart
[1:13:34] i wonder
[1:13:35] what it would be tonight if we could
[1:13:37] climb above the heavens of heaven
[1:13:40] and look at this great drama as it's
[1:13:42] getting set together now fixing to come
[1:13:45] to pass of god and the devil coming to a
[1:13:48] showdown
[1:13:49] i'm so glad that i'm on the winning side
[1:13:52] can we make a declaration today i'm on
[1:13:54] the winning side amen i decided i'm with
[1:13:58] my lord jesus christ i'm standing with
[1:14:01] him i'm sold out with him i made a vow
[1:14:04] to him
[1:14:05] now look at this if we could climb above
[1:14:07] the heavens of heaven i touch on this
[1:14:09] wednesday i just want to very briefly
[1:14:11] touch this again the prophet of god the
[1:14:14] word of god is talking about heavenly
[1:14:16] places my brother and sister we don't
[1:14:18] have to worry about going in a rapture
[1:14:20] to look back to see what god brought us
[1:14:22] through but we have been ordained by the
[1:14:25] word to rise now into heavenly places
[1:14:29] and when we're living in heavenly places
[1:14:31] you might have tough days you might have
[1:14:33] tough circumstances but you can look
[1:14:36] back and say the battle is already been
[1:14:39] won the victory's already been given to
[1:14:42] me i don't have to be buffeted by the
[1:14:45] devil because he's got a bluff
[1:14:48] hallelujah and if you're living in
[1:14:50] heavenly places you're looking down on
[1:14:52] the devil
[1:14:55] he's not in a position of authority in
[1:14:57] your life you're living in a position
[1:15:00] you look down on the devil and you've
[1:15:02] got to learn to say devil why would i
[1:15:05] come down to the pit with you when i can
[1:15:08] rise in heavenly places with my lord
[1:15:10] jesus
[1:15:12] oh thank you lord jesus
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:16] hallelujah
[1:15:18] amen it's getting set together fixing
[1:15:21] come to pass of god and the devil
[1:15:23] coming to a show down do you have your
[1:15:24] name in there

[1:15:30] is your name in this yes
[1:15:33] come on saints
[1:15:34] you'll say well i don't see my name in
[1:15:36] there yes it is because god's in you and
[1:15:38] you were in god
[1:15:39] amen so you're right there with this
[1:15:41] showdown god's already given you victory
[1:15:44] because he is victory
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:47] oh
[1:15:49] i don't know could i could you humor me
[1:15:50] this morning and just repeat those words
[1:15:52] right here i'm so glad
[1:15:56] that i'm on the winning side
[1:15:58] amen nobody likes to be on the losing
[1:16:01] side
[1:16:03] it's just a human nature
[1:16:08] i'm so glad
[1:16:10] you realize let me put this i'm gonna
[1:16:12] get a little sidetracked forgive me just
[1:16:13] say a quick prayer for me here
[1:16:15] but you realize that every one of us
[1:16:17] follows something or someone
[1:16:20] people talk about the message of the
[1:16:22] hour and they say they follow that
[1:16:23] william branham they're in a cult
[1:16:26] if they're baptists they have their man
[1:16:27] their nazarene their methodists they're
[1:16:29] catholic they're mormon they all got
[1:16:31] their man but you know my brother and
[1:16:33] sister i come across a lovely little
[1:16:35] quotation i'd read it to you perfectly
[1:16:37] correct if i had my phone here
[1:16:39] but you see
[1:16:40] no one
[1:16:42] ever criticizes
[1:16:46] you oh
[1:16:50] sister jared you remember how that was
[1:16:53] i'm just you know i do this it's the
[1:16:56] pressure
[1:16:57] pressure gets to me
[1:17:01] oh those that criticize you these won't
[1:17:03] be the perfect words those that
[1:17:05] criticize you are doing nothing
[1:17:14] they criticize you because you're doing
[1:17:15] more
[1:17:17] than them
[1:17:21] you imagine
[1:17:22] come on there'll be folks right here in
[1:17:24] this church and i don't mean to be too
[1:17:25] personal to you but there's people here
[1:17:27] that are struggling with this giant
[1:17:30] called the devil in their life
[1:17:32] but if you just realize this devil is
[1:17:35] actually doing
[1:17:37] nothing
[1:17:39] and that's why he's criticizing you
[1:17:43] he's a jealous
[1:17:44] he's a jealous god with a little little
[1:17:47] little little little g
[1:17:52] because one he knows he doesn't have
[1:17:53] eternal life
[1:17:55] he contains no healing virtue you know
[1:17:57] god poured creative power into you
[1:17:59] whereby the laying on of hands and the
[1:18:02] prayer of a righteous son or daughter of
[1:18:04] god brings healing virtue
[1:18:06] satan never healed a single one
[1:18:09] because as the scripture says that had
[1:18:11] two demons
[1:18:13] competing against each other
[1:18:15] no
[1:18:16] no my brother and sister i'm getting
[1:18:18] sidetracked forgive me
[1:18:20] i got a pile of notes so big if i come
[1:18:22] to preach it you'd had to brought a
[1:18:23] basket of lunch
[1:18:25] amen now look
[1:18:27] we need to apply this even more saints
[1:18:29] brother david knows what i'm talking
[1:18:30] about
[1:18:30] and that spirit's been getting on chris
[1:18:32] lately you notice that anyway sorry
[1:18:34] about that but look at this my brother
[1:18:36] and sister now is it what it happened
[1:18:38] here as we get closer to the culmination
[1:18:41] of the age these things are coming in a
[1:18:45] greater force
[1:18:46] these things are being manifested in a
[1:18:49] greater force as a coming of the age a
[1:18:52] culmination of the age is coming and so
[1:18:54] it's there satan sees just as we're
[1:18:57] looking for the rapture
[1:18:59] satan's seeing the clock wind down on
[1:19:01] his time
[1:19:03] and he's getting desperate
[1:19:05] well i hope you are desperate devil amen
[1:19:08] because this bride of christ has already
[1:19:10] been uh uh
[1:19:12] revelated to see
[1:19:14] uh your tactics and who you are
[1:19:17] amen now let's look i got a lot of
[1:19:19] quotes hope you don't mind them today
[1:19:21] amen now i want you to notice i believe
[1:19:23] that god is just as tangible in this
[1:19:25] room tonight as the light is on my hand
[1:19:28] so no doubt there was light shining on
[1:19:29] his hands do you believe that now notice
[1:19:32] get the fundamental foundation first
[1:19:34] that divine healing is in christ
[1:19:39] can you imagine that people that call
[1:19:40] themselves christians don't believe in
[1:19:42] healing
[1:19:45] you talk about the devil doing real
[1:19:48] slick deal there
[1:19:54] this really struck my heart saints
[1:19:56] because of my granddaughter
[1:19:59] it struck my heart deep because of my
[1:20:01] granddaughter
[1:20:05] and he is as present and just as close
[1:20:08] to you as the light that's shining on
[1:20:10] you now
[1:20:11] now i would like you to measure if you
[1:20:13] were standing in the light i would want
[1:20:15] you to measure this separation from you
[1:20:18] in the light
[1:20:20] hallelujah you couldn't measure it
[1:20:23] that's the infinite he's forever and
[1:20:27] forever he knoweth the beginning he
[1:20:30] now how the devil fights this wonderful
[1:20:33] truth of divine healing
[1:20:35] marks it up
[1:20:37] oh somebody the church is going to wake
[1:20:39] up to the fact and realize that they
[1:20:42] have
[1:20:42] oh we're getting down to my title here
[1:20:45] they have the very greatest one
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:50] the greatest things that they had and
[1:20:52] the greatest blessings outside of
[1:20:54] salvation they turned it down
[1:20:58] so here is divine healing to believe
[1:21:00] that god is in control of my life and
[1:21:03] the time and the season is there and if
[1:21:06] the affliction still resides in my flesh
[1:21:09] it does not matter i'm not looking to my
[1:21:11] flesh i'm looking to the word of god and
[1:21:14] the word of god said i'm healed
[1:21:16] oh you fanatic you yes throw me in there
[1:21:19] with him
[1:21:20] throw me in there with him i'm already
[1:21:23] healed
[1:21:24] amen
[1:21:27] claim your affliction put it before the
[1:21:29] throne of almighty god and declare i'm
[1:21:32] healed
[1:21:33] it's done
[1:21:35] [Music]
[1:21:42] someday
[1:21:45] look at this
[1:21:47] someday prophet preaching this
[1:21:50] 1953
[1:21:52] someday
[1:21:54] the church
[1:21:55] is going to recognize
[1:21:58] my brother and sister we can stand here
[1:22:00] this morning without boasting without
[1:22:02] stepping on a limb on thin ice we can
[1:22:05] stand here and say this is the day
[1:22:08] this is the someday the prophet of god
[1:22:11] was talking about that we can step out
[1:22:14] take possession of this believe it with
[1:22:16] all that is within us all but i don't
[1:22:18] see the manifestation of healing in your
[1:22:21] body well i'll tell you what the healing
[1:22:24] of my soul is so much more important to
[1:22:26] me than the healing of my body but i
[1:22:29] give the healing of my body to my lord
[1:22:33] what you desire lord
[1:22:35] people say well he died and never did
[1:22:37] get healed
[1:22:39] well
[1:22:40] if you make it to the other side
[1:22:43] with that kind of attitude
[1:22:46] you'll see some young man
[1:22:49] sprinting running jumping praising young
[1:22:52] woman sprinting running jumping praising
[1:22:55] and you'll wonder
[1:22:57] where's their affliction
[1:23:00] i don't know how many of you would know
[1:23:01] brother ballroom up in canada
[1:23:04] but here is a brother that has been
[1:23:05] afflicted in his flesh forever
[1:23:08] and as he gets older it's getting harder
[1:23:10] and harder for him to walk he kind of
[1:23:12] drags a leg i don't know all what what
[1:23:15] exactly was wrong with him but you know
[1:23:17] i mean as far as what
[1:23:18] the names would be but i just know my
[1:23:20] brother ballroom and here's a man that
[1:23:22] goes along with this deal and just
[1:23:24] barely moves but here's a man whose
[1:23:27] faith every time i would talk to him his
[1:23:30] faith has stretched the boundaries and
[1:23:33] his faith is growing while his body is
[1:23:36] diminishing his faith is growing and
[1:23:40] he's declared hallelujah the lord showed
[1:23:43] me i've got a new body waiting
[1:23:46] oh that's the kind of faith i want grace
[1:23:49] tabernacle to have i'm not looking at
[1:23:51] this world and these afflictions i'm
[1:23:54] looking to who i am and i am the word
[1:23:59] i am not a weary man i am the word
[1:24:03] that's right
[1:24:04] that's right oh people say that's too
[1:24:06] weird you don't know your bible if you
[1:24:08] think that's weird
[1:24:10] hallelujah
[1:24:12] oh yeah
[1:24:14] yeah see someday the church is going to
[1:24:15] wake up to that fact
[1:24:17] and he's the greatest one
[1:24:20] oh my goodness my brother and sister
[1:24:23] look at that i'm sorry i'm excited
[1:24:25] i'm excited
[1:24:27] oh
[1:24:31] did you catch that
[1:24:33] one of the greatest things
[1:24:36] outside of salvation
[1:24:39] search the message you're not going to
[1:24:40] find brother brown talking about a big
[1:24:42] church a big car a nice house
[1:24:45] he's not going to talk about those
[1:24:46] things being amongst the greatest
[1:24:48] outside of salvation
[1:24:50] so now he's just anchored our healing
[1:24:53] as one of the greatest things that god
[1:24:56] give us outside of salvation
[1:25:00] whoa
[1:25:02] thank you lord
[1:25:03] well we choose to major on other things
[1:25:07] yeah
[1:25:09] yeah
[1:25:16] yeah lord i'll leave that alone
[1:25:19] thank you lord
[1:25:26] close as the light some day the church
[1:25:28] is going to wake up to that fact realize
[1:25:30] the very greatest one the greatest
[1:25:32] things that they had the greatest
[1:25:33] blessings outside of salvation they
[1:25:35] turned it down
[1:25:41] i don't know why i feel led to just
[1:25:42] drive this home
[1:25:44] drive at home saints
[1:25:46] you say but brother paul i've been
[1:25:47] praying for healing for years just keep
[1:25:49] praying it's good for your character
[1:25:52] it keeps you humble
[1:25:54] it keeps you down on your knees before
[1:25:56] the lord the devil would like you to
[1:25:58] give up and say you know what whatever
[1:26:00] it was that's afflicting you is yours
[1:26:02] forever and as long as you step into
[1:26:04] that realm it will be
[1:26:08] step over here in faith
[1:26:11] grab a hold of a giant chunk of faith
[1:26:14] amen
[1:26:16] they turned it down many times i found
[1:26:18] the heathens over there in africa the
[1:26:19] missionary told them the days of miracle
[1:26:21] is past
[1:26:22] and the poor fellow is walking around
[1:26:24] packing mud idols trying to get healing
[1:26:27] through mud idols because they know
[1:26:29] their fathers god winked at their
[1:26:31] ignorance
[1:26:32] you get this saints god winked at the
[1:26:34] ignorance in the days gone by but we
[1:26:36] have the opened word in our day god
[1:26:39] doesn't have a wink for you
[1:26:42] god isn't sitting here giving you the
[1:26:44] little wink my brother and sister god
[1:26:47] said i have sent a prophet to restore
[1:26:49] the word it is now restored and you
[1:26:52] don't have a wing you have the word
[1:26:55] take the word
[1:26:57] don't look for the wink take the word
[1:27:00] i'm sorry i'm getting too loud here
[1:27:02] forgive me hallelujah
[1:27:06] amen
[1:27:09] god went to their ignorance had healed
[1:27:10] them through believing in the god of
[1:27:12] their mud idol
[1:27:14] but the theology of preachers today and
[1:27:16] of churches and things that deny the
[1:27:18] power of god to heal now notice friend
[1:27:20] one day for instance the electric lights
[1:27:24] there was a time when a man would have
[1:27:26] fought if they'd have been told somebody
[1:27:28] let me i can't hardly read that
[1:27:31] there was a time when a man would have
[1:27:33] thought that if they had told somebody
[1:27:35] 500 years ago that they'd have an
[1:27:37] electric light like that the person
[1:27:38] would have said the person was crazy
[1:27:41] but there was a man one time who down in
[1:27:44] his heart believed that there was
[1:27:46] that he could catch that electricity and
[1:27:48] he got a kite and a key and he fished it
[1:27:51] out of the skies
[1:27:53] hallelujah well i'm telling you what
[1:27:55] people will say show me faith i don't
[1:27:57] need to show you faith it's right here
[1:28:00] all i got to do is believe that faith is
[1:28:03] present with me
[1:28:04] amen the prophet of god said everything
[1:28:07] you need to make the rapture is already
[1:28:10] in you so quit running quit running quit
[1:28:13] running and stop and say lord release
[1:28:16] what is already in me today
[1:28:20] you gave it to me before the foundation
[1:28:22] of the world lord release it
[1:28:24] help me to be surrendered so you can
[1:28:26] release it that's right amen amen
[1:28:30] amen
[1:28:32] preach it
[1:28:33] that's it
[1:28:34] seen a little video once of a man
[1:28:39] that just cast his paycheck and he comes
[1:28:41] out and a couple guys go to hold him up
[1:28:47] and finally they bully the man into
[1:28:48] handing over his wallet
[1:28:52] but he reaches out
[1:28:54] and he grabs a lamp pole
[1:28:57] and he grabs the front
[1:28:59] of the man's coat
[1:29:01] and the man is pounding him
[1:29:03] blood flying everywhere pounding
[1:29:08] him you think what's he doing
[1:29:13] and then
[1:29:14] you hear the siren
[1:29:19] and the man starts screaming
[1:29:21] let go of me let go of me let go of me
[1:29:25] and he's pounding on this man with
[1:29:27] ferocity because he realized what the
[1:29:29] man was doing
[1:29:31] yeah he got a piece of the man his
[1:29:33] wallet
[1:29:34] but the man got all of him
[1:29:36] and it's about time saints we take the
[1:29:38] devil by the throat and we don't let go
[1:29:41] until he is vanquished
[1:29:44] not listen a little bit oh get away from
[1:29:45] me devil quit bothering me devil no
[1:29:47] don't torment me devil come on the song
[1:29:50] says it's a midnight hour if you should
[1:29:53] find you're in a prison in your mind
[1:29:56] give up
[1:29:57] no
[1:29:58] fight
[1:29:59] fight
[1:30:01] call out the name of the lord call his
[1:30:03] presence around you and the devil's
[1:30:06] going to say okay you can let me go now
[1:30:08] no you're vanquished you're defeated
[1:30:11] i overcome you by the word of my mouth
[1:30:15] by the blood of the lamb
[1:30:17] oh
[1:30:18] hallelujah oh hallelujah
[1:30:24] oh my
[1:30:25] he fished it out of the skies now listen
[1:30:27] look at this
[1:30:28] and when he it run down the string or it
[1:30:31] hit into the bottle he stopped it up and
[1:30:34] he began to scream i got it i got it
[1:30:37] he had it
[1:30:38] but he didn't know what he had
[1:30:41] that's what the church
[1:30:43] the matter with the church today they
[1:30:45] got something
[1:30:46] but they don't know what they got
[1:30:49] now i don't want to sound too harsh to
[1:30:50] you saints but if we're sitting here
[1:30:52] with a little something in our life
[1:30:54] besetting sin
[1:30:56] doubts and fears that cause you to sit
[1:30:58] down on the word of god
[1:31:02] you don't know what you've got
[1:31:05] because if you knew what you had
[1:31:08] you would rise up in authority not in
[1:31:09] yourself
[1:31:10] not in yourself you would rise up in
[1:31:13] authority and say you know what i've
[1:31:14] already been loosed
[1:31:16] satan is already defeated now why am i
[1:31:19] surrendering to an enemy that's carrying
[1:31:23] a surrender sign
[1:31:29] i hope that's not offensive
[1:31:31] but it's time for us
[1:31:33] to quit surrendering to a defeated foe
[1:31:38] it's time for us to say you know what
[1:31:40] the word of god says i know i don't look
[1:31:42] like it
[1:31:43] i look battered and beaten
[1:31:46] but the word says i'm victorious
[1:31:49] so regardless of what you look like
[1:31:51] satan i'm not going to surrender to you
[1:31:54] come on saints
[1:31:56] we need to come and rise up we need to
[1:31:58] take possession of what god has given us
[1:32:00] instead of sitting around i don't know
[1:32:01] what it is god wants me to do yes you do
[1:32:04] he wants you to live an overcoming life
[1:32:06] he wants you to be filled with the holy
[1:32:07] ghost he wants you to sing praises to
[1:32:10] his name he wants you to testify to the
[1:32:12] heaven that he is the king of king don't
[1:32:15] tell me you don't know what god wants
[1:32:16] you to do
[1:32:18] amen the word has clearly showed us that
[1:32:20] i don't want to be offensive on that
[1:32:22] saints but it's time we start calling
[1:32:23] white white and black black amen and get
[1:32:26] to the point that we can stand up on the
[1:32:28] word of god stand up on your own two
[1:32:30] god-given empowered feet
[1:32:33] amen
[1:32:35] hallelujah
[1:32:36] now as we look at this
[1:32:39] and i i'll be open i i i shared
[1:32:41] wednesday night where i got this from i
[1:32:44] was listening brother barry
[1:32:45] minister up in the
[1:32:47] the uh banquet that we went to and i
[1:32:50] just love this so much i just can't get
[1:32:51] it off my mind
[1:32:53] amen
[1:32:56] it all has to do with our proximity to
[1:32:58] christ
[1:33:01] i can see jesus christ
[1:33:03] he's on the top of that mountain over
[1:33:05] there
[1:33:06] that mountain called mount calvary
[1:33:08] he's all the way over there
[1:33:11] no sir
[1:33:13] no sir
[1:33:15] he's off the cross saints
[1:33:17] don't come back try and put him on the
[1:33:18] cross again and again and again the
[1:33:20] scripture says that's what happens to
[1:33:22] those that will never be able to come
[1:33:25] back
[1:33:26] get right up close how about we just
[1:33:28] throw our arms around him amen get so
[1:33:31] close to him you won't need binoculars
[1:33:34] you won't need nothing because you'll be
[1:33:35] feeling him amen oh it's not about
[1:33:37] feelings well i'm telling you my brother
[1:33:39] and sister i hope this don't sound too
[1:33:40] personal my wife's sitting in the back
[1:33:42] of the church with grandchildren today i
[1:33:44] can't feel her right now but i know what
[1:33:48] it is to wrap my arms around her so you
[1:33:51] can go through life and have
[1:33:52] circumstances say i don't feel the
[1:33:54] presence of lord right now but you can
[1:33:56] also stop and say i know he is with me
[1:34:00] i was with him this morning i was with
[1:34:02] him last night i was with him this and
[1:34:04] so i know by the word and the promise of
[1:34:07] the word is right here so i don't have
[1:34:09] to go by a feeling
[1:34:11] because i already know i got him
[1:34:13] and he's got me
[1:34:16] yeah yeah thank you lord so your
[1:34:19] proximity to christ will determine the
[1:34:21] light by which you see revelation
[1:34:26] well of course jesus christ is coming
[1:34:28] back
[1:34:30] if that's all the deeper your revelation
[1:34:31] is you could be almost any religion
[1:34:33] isn't that give you a feeling of freedom
[1:34:36] that you could be any religion you want
[1:34:40] no sir
[1:34:41] there's no
[1:34:42] feeling of freedom
[1:34:44] in something so mundane and watered down
[1:34:48] something so washed out
[1:34:51] well i have no problem drinking
[1:34:53] dancing and smoking
[1:34:56] because i jesus died for me
[1:34:59] that's good i'm not going to criticize
[1:35:00] you
[1:35:02] but something's missing in that feeling
[1:35:05] something's missing in that relationship
[1:35:08] huh
[1:35:09] and i don't mean to bash on those things
[1:35:12] amen
[1:35:14] look revelation doesn't come from casual
[1:35:16] interaction
[1:35:19] you know where revelation comes from
[1:35:20] saints
[1:35:21] intense
[1:35:23] intense
[1:35:24] interaction
[1:35:26] intense proximity
[1:35:28] with our lord jesus christ is where
[1:35:30] revelation comes from
[1:35:32] people will say things like well i read
[1:35:34] the same scripture the same quote and i
[1:35:36] don't see what you see
[1:35:39] no wonder they think people in the
[1:35:41] message can be arrogant
[1:35:44] i can't help it that i
[1:35:46] read my bible and it speaks to me
[1:35:50] i can't help it i read the message
[1:35:52] and it speaks to me
[1:35:56] can't help that
[1:35:58] i i can't say okay lord just shut it off
[1:36:02] i can't do that
[1:36:04] years ago when i was a young man
[1:36:06] teenager accident
[1:36:08] moved away ran around all over the
[1:36:09] southwest
[1:36:11] slept on porches and couches and floors
[1:36:13] and slept in my vehicle more than i'd
[1:36:15] like to admit
[1:36:16] and yet even in that stage of my life
[1:36:18] god was speaking to me
[1:36:20] because i couldn't turn it off
[1:36:23] god wasn't going to allow it to be shut
[1:36:25] off
[1:36:27] oh my brother and sister
[1:36:36] so know one of the great gifts that god
[1:36:39] would give to the bride of christ
[1:36:41] you'll see this expressed in the message
[1:36:43] and i was going to put the sermon that
[1:36:45] brother brown talked about it primarily
[1:36:46] but i didn't get to it
[1:36:49] but brother branham comes to a stage in
[1:36:50] his life in his ministry
[1:36:53] he's
[1:36:56] prayed for healing
[1:36:57] thousands upon thousands tens of
[1:36:59] thousands healed
[1:37:01] he's cast out demons he didn't cast them
[1:37:03] out the holy ghost did
[1:37:06] all these things happening people
[1:37:08] finding deliverance and understanding in
[1:37:10] the word
[1:37:12] and then god starts to deal with the
[1:37:13] prophet
[1:37:17] and his prayer starts to be
[1:37:19] lord help me
[1:37:21] be more sincere
[1:37:25] his prayer wasn't
[1:37:27] i want to show the world
[1:37:30] i want to be the most powerful
[1:37:31] evangelist i want to no
[1:37:34] what did it do it started to humble him
[1:37:36] down
[1:37:37] and he started looking at this right
[1:37:39] here and said you know what this old
[1:37:42] flesh
[1:37:43] is not sincere enough
[1:37:45] it was a gift actually that god gave him
[1:37:48] you say it's not a gift to be manifested
[1:37:51] the world to prove how do you prove
[1:37:53] sincerity
[1:37:55] you know there is a proof for sincerity
[1:38:00] doing
[1:38:01] what you said you would do
[1:38:04] it is the key of sincerity
[1:38:07] from the heart freely doing
[1:38:09] but here's a prophet
[1:38:11] lord help be more sincere
[1:38:14] i've been all these years
[1:38:17] made it to around 50 years old and
[1:38:19] suddenly decides he's not sincere enough
[1:38:23] god help us saints
[1:38:25] help us
[1:38:27] to come to a place where we realize this
[1:38:30] is a gift god has given us that we could
[1:38:31] see a need for a greater sincerity
[1:38:35] amen
[1:38:37] oh look at this now
[1:38:40] see
[1:38:46] prophet's answer
[1:38:49] for sincerity
[1:38:51] was to get into the word more that's
[1:38:53] right
[1:38:54] he didn't go out and read a book on how
[1:38:55] to be sincere
[1:38:57] he didn't go ask some psychologist or
[1:38:59] something now what is a guy got to do to
[1:39:01] be sincere
[1:39:02] he got in the word amen and as more of
[1:39:05] the word got in him the more of the word
[1:39:07] poured out of him
[1:39:10] and it was there that god looked down
[1:39:11] and said my son is sincere
[1:39:13] it wasn't
[1:39:14] by some other action
[1:39:17] so getting the word
[1:39:19] how about it come on
[1:39:21] want to get in the word
[1:39:23] come on saint somebody lift a hand
[1:39:25] somebody cries somebody do something
[1:39:27] amen we're not we're not just i'm not
[1:39:29] trying to just get your amen i'm wanting
[1:39:31] you to say amen because it's then you
[1:39:33] saying so be it
[1:39:35] it's me saying i want to be more sincere
[1:39:37] lord so be it
[1:39:39] amen
[1:39:40] now let me hurry along here because i
[1:39:42] got so much you know here's the problem
[1:39:44] we have
[1:39:45] saints and i hope this don't stomp on
[1:39:47] anybody's toes
[1:39:49] but we have too many people today
[1:39:50] promoting the message
[1:39:54] we are not here to promote the message
[1:39:57] we are here to promote jesus christ
[1:40:00] see promoting the message is just us
[1:40:02] becoming another denomination
[1:40:05] amen hallelujah so this message is not
[1:40:08] what we're promoting it's christ that we
[1:40:10] promote because it's christ that makes a
[1:40:11] difference you say well brother paul
[1:40:13] it's what brother brown said sure it is
[1:40:14] but whose words was it in the beginning
[1:40:23] well i got a big long quote here are you
[1:40:25] guys okay
[1:40:27] okay
[1:40:30] but when the blood cell was broken the
[1:40:31] lamb
[1:40:32] the life brother i'm talking about the
[1:40:34] sacrifice here the life that was in the
[1:40:37] blood cell was animal life it would not
[1:40:39] coincide with human life but when the
[1:40:41] blood cell of emmanuel was broken then
[1:40:44] his spirit the life that was in the
[1:40:46] blood cell of emmanuel returns back
[1:40:48] which is none other than the holy spirit
[1:40:50] itself
[1:40:51] and the worshiper once with the holy
[1:40:53] spirit in him his heart becomes changed
[1:40:56] now not from an intellectual view of the
[1:40:59] bible or a conception of any creed but
[1:41:02] from an experience from a witness of the
[1:41:05] resurrection jesus said ye are my
[1:41:07] witnesses
[1:41:10] after
[1:41:13] the holy spirit comes upon you not until
[1:41:15] the holy spirit comes were they
[1:41:17] witnesses they could not witness until
[1:41:20] the holy spirit
[1:41:21] for he is the witness the bible says no
[1:41:24] man can call jesus a christ only by the
[1:41:26] holy spirit
[1:41:28] amen so you know some people say well i
[1:41:31] walked into church and i just felt it
[1:41:33] and i knew that was holy spirit
[1:41:36] come on the devil's an impersonator he's
[1:41:38] an outright fraud actually
[1:41:41] amen
[1:41:42] outright fraud
[1:41:44] yeah
[1:41:47] you notice how the
[1:41:48] devil never
[1:41:50] have you know have you guys gotten any
[1:41:52] you know your car warranty
[1:41:54] has expired
[1:41:56] and uh
[1:41:58] that big bucket full of money you spent
[1:42:00] at amazon and ordered all these things
[1:42:02] and now you just need to give your
[1:42:03] credit card to confirm it
[1:42:06] well if i had ordered it you would
[1:42:08] already have my credit card
[1:42:10] have you noticed
[1:42:11] that they never call you up and say hi
[1:42:16] i'm a fraudster
[1:42:19] and i need your credit card number
[1:42:22] expiry and
[1:42:24] the code on the back because i'm going
[1:42:26] to drain your account
[1:42:28] and not only that i need your bank
[1:42:30] account number oh and while you're at it
[1:42:32] throw your social security card in the
[1:42:34] mix also
[1:42:36] no no the devil's much more slippery
[1:42:38] than that
[1:42:40] he comes along and gets people to
[1:42:41] believe
[1:42:42] that they are totally committed they're
[1:42:44] totally on board but yet they're just
[1:42:46] doing what they want to do and believe
[1:42:49] that they have some special token
[1:42:52] reminds me of a time
[1:42:55] little story
[1:42:57] man had a little token
[1:43:00] and he went i think it was disneyland
[1:43:02] goes up to pay for his deal and they
[1:43:04] said it's like 40 bucks and he pulls the
[1:43:06] token out and says hey it's discounted i
[1:43:08] have a token
[1:43:15] i hope you see the humor
[1:43:16] the clerk says without a chocolate one
[1:43:18] or vanilla
[1:43:22] come on nothing to do with it
[1:43:24] nothing i hope you catch my point
[1:43:26] nothing to do with it but people have
[1:43:28] their token
[1:43:30] wrong kind of token
[1:43:32] prophet of god showed us so clearly what
[1:43:34] the token was that was the word the holy
[1:43:36] ghost in us
[1:43:39] there's our token it's not chocolate and
[1:43:41] it's not vanilla but it works hallelujah
[1:43:45] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:43:47] amen let's stand up watch something take
[1:43:50] place what a display could you imagine
[1:43:51] the omnipotent unpresent omnipresent
[1:43:54] omniscient infinite god would ever let
[1:43:57] the devil defeat his purpose
[1:43:59] couldn't happen no not god he will never
[1:44:02] do it when he looked at his family in
[1:44:05] the garden of eden when little adam and
[1:44:07] eve and her lovely little head laying on
[1:44:10] adam's shoulders as he moved through the
[1:44:12] garden
[1:44:14] now remember what brother brown says
[1:44:15] these these artists painted eve as a
[1:44:17] hideous
[1:44:19] do you realize connotation of that they
[1:44:21] were anointed by the devil to try to
[1:44:23] make the bride of this age look like the
[1:44:25] filthiness out there
[1:44:27] that hideous little bride they tried to
[1:44:30] make believe was eve my brother and
[1:44:32] sister was nothing more than satan's
[1:44:34] life manifested in the artistic form
[1:44:36] because this bride is beautiful
[1:44:38] this bride is the very beauty of god's
[1:44:41] eye she's got his heart amen and it is
[1:44:44] there she doesn't just have his heart
[1:44:46] she has him
[1:44:47] hallelujah she has him so the devil
[1:44:50] trying to make eve look like some kind
[1:44:52] of hideous is trying to make the bride
[1:44:54] of this age think that she's going to be
[1:44:56] a filthy uh oh my goodness street
[1:44:58] walking whatever of a bride not going to
[1:45:01] happen
[1:45:02] it worked once devil but it won't work
[1:45:04] again
[1:45:06] little adam and eve her lovely little
[1:45:08] head lying on adam's shoulders he moved
[1:45:10] through the garden and if the winds
[1:45:12] blowed and little eve said oh adam said
[1:45:14] peace be still and the wind stopped and
[1:45:17] the lion and the tiger followed them
[1:45:19] they was kittens
[1:45:20] oh my isn't that beautiful
[1:45:23] in the evening when the sun was going
[1:45:25] down and they went to the cathedral into
[1:45:27] the palm trees or whatever trees it was
[1:45:29] in eden and they began to worship a soft
[1:45:31] mellow light god the logos come down
[1:45:34] over the tops of the trees and he said
[1:45:36] children
[1:45:37] have you enjoyed yourself today on the
[1:45:39] earth
[1:45:41] i've come down to kiss you good night
[1:45:49] god forgive me because i get busy so
[1:45:51] tired sometimes i give
[1:45:54] i give so little i get down to the end
[1:45:55] of the day and
[1:45:57] you've heard the radio ad you know
[1:46:01] we have these cars we have this we have
[1:46:02] that we can do this and we'll do that
[1:46:04] and finance this and then all of a
[1:46:05] sudden it changes over and over
[1:46:08] [Music]
[1:46:10] we only had
[1:46:21] that's what the devil wants our evening
[1:46:23] conversation to be
[1:46:29] you realize why we should be picking up
[1:46:30] our bibles
[1:46:32] we should be getting down on our knees
[1:46:35] because he wants to come right down
[1:46:37] in our midst
[1:46:39] and kiss us good night amen
[1:46:43] can you imagine little old me
[1:46:46] not accomplished it much in my life a
[1:46:48] high school dropout been blessed with a
[1:46:50] good family
[1:46:52] and god wants to come down every single
[1:46:54] night and kiss me good night
[1:46:58] all our hearts should be humbled saints
[1:47:01] that god would love us so much he would
[1:47:03] come down to kiss us good night
[1:47:08] we're too busy listening to them
[1:47:15] wow
[1:47:17] yeah
[1:47:18] yep
[1:47:20] lay them down at sleep and he laid all
[1:47:22] of his animals down to rest through the
[1:47:24] night and the father said that's good i
[1:47:26] like the way it's done
[1:47:27] do you think that heavenly father will
[1:47:29] be defeated
[1:47:32] in his purpose
[1:47:35] you think of god that's powerful enough
[1:47:37] to do that would be defeated in his
[1:47:38] purpose
[1:47:40] even though satan has done what he's
[1:47:42] done it's an impossibility
[1:47:45] he will not be defeated he's given us a
[1:47:49] perfect assurance that we will not have
[1:47:51] to be scared of anything
[1:47:55] oh hallelujah
[1:47:57] amen
[1:47:59] oh my brother and sister
[1:48:03] now i want to go back just real quick
[1:48:04] we're going to close
[1:48:06] seems almost impossible that we could
[1:48:07] have something and not know what it is
[1:48:12] i want you to think about that
[1:48:18] could i ask you to do a little personal
[1:48:19] homework
[1:48:24] go home
[1:48:26] car whatever it is go sit in the park
[1:48:30] look through your life and ask yourself
[1:48:34] why you think
[1:48:35] that god chose you
[1:48:40] exceptional intelligence
[1:48:43] great physical strength
[1:48:46] great reasoning
[1:48:49] what could it be why god would choose us
[1:48:55] you see god
[1:48:58] placed
[1:49:01] i had another word here but i'm going to
[1:49:02] go with brother david
[1:49:05] god place that seed
[1:49:08] god never lost a seed yet right that's
[1:49:10] what his word says
[1:49:12] god doesn't get out there and say now i
[1:49:13] planted these yesterday are these peas
[1:49:15] or corn or squash or what is this
[1:49:18] i don't know what i've done
[1:49:20] no sir god's never lost one
[1:49:23] he's put those seeds in that place and
[1:49:25] some seed comes up in some difficult
[1:49:27] times and places but you know what my
[1:49:29] brother and sister god is revealing to
[1:49:32] the bride
[1:49:33] through her proximity to the word
[1:49:36] who she is and where she's at in this
[1:49:38] great economy of god and as you look at
[1:49:41] this now
[1:49:43] who put the scarecrow up
[1:49:48] who put the scarecrow just visiting with
[1:49:50] individual here recently
[1:49:52] and i just asked him
[1:49:54] you know i'm getting that no filter old
[1:49:56] age things creeping up on me really fast
[1:49:59] so how did you come to the message
[1:50:02] well i worked with this guy and um
[1:50:05] he was a fanatic
[1:50:07] he was just
[1:50:08] really just
[1:50:11] a religious fanatic
[1:50:16] and he was telling me all about this man
[1:50:18] that god had set down to correct the
[1:50:20] word and my mind was like going uh now i
[1:50:24] don't know how that can be how
[1:50:26] then another guy i worked with come
[1:50:27] walking up and said he's just a
[1:50:29] religious fanatic he's just a religious
[1:50:32] freak you stay away from him and he said
[1:50:34] i stood there and i was like but i like
[1:50:36] this man
[1:50:39] so now i like a religious fanatic a
[1:50:42] religious freak
[1:50:44] and i don't like you
[1:50:49] strange how god works
[1:50:52] and the more this guy told him that he's
[1:50:54] in a cult
[1:50:56] the more he decided he'd go see what it
[1:50:58] is because this guy is real nice and
[1:51:00] he's over here saying don't worry about
[1:51:02] him over there god loves him too
[1:51:04] so this guy hates him this guy loves him
[1:51:07] he decided i think i'll go see what the
[1:51:09] one who's doing the lovin has and he
[1:51:11] said i walked into church and before i
[1:51:13] walked out that night i realized i was
[1:51:16] not just a sinner but i was a sinner
[1:51:19] saved by grace
[1:51:21] and it was real grace and it was real
[1:51:23] love and it was a real life
[1:51:27] and then i went back to work and the guy
[1:51:29] says i hear you went over to his church
[1:51:31] and got saved and he said yes i did and
[1:51:34] then he started hating me
[1:51:38] imagine
[1:51:39] what was it just a man living his life
[1:51:41] working in a factory
[1:51:43] every time a piece of steel come up bang
[1:51:45] against the deal he reached out and
[1:51:46] pulled the lever now you'd think they
[1:51:48] could build a machine to do that
[1:51:50] but that man needed a job to stand there
[1:51:52] next to that man so he could witness
[1:51:54] what's this man's job just make sure the
[1:51:56] piece of steel was in the right place
[1:51:58] you know what god's job was
[1:52:00] to make sure both of them were in the
[1:52:02] right place
[1:52:04] that was god's job because the seed was
[1:52:06] already in him god didn't have to run
[1:52:07] down there and say whoa i got to put a
[1:52:09] seed in this man
[1:52:13] oh hallelujah i'm getting so sidetracked
[1:52:14] you guys got to stop doing that to me
[1:52:16] amen
[1:52:18] look at this
[1:52:19] amen will not be defeated he's given us
[1:52:21] a perfect assurance i say thank you lord
[1:52:24] amen hallelujah hallelujah amen so we
[1:52:28] don't we don't know but it's see it's
[1:52:30] just satan putting this
[1:52:32] but look at this word saints
[1:52:36] this might be a little personal you
[1:52:38] don't have to lift no hands you don't
[1:52:39] have to do it
[1:52:42] but aren't you amazed
[1:52:45] how
[1:52:46] the holy spirit's come down
[1:52:49] and identified every satanic seed
[1:52:52] the devil tried to leave in your garden
[1:52:56] all doubts amen
[1:52:59] all fierce
[1:53:01] all these seeds that the devil poured
[1:53:02] out
[1:53:03] god says no problem i've got a gardener
[1:53:07] i've got a gardener he'll come
[1:53:10] you don't worry about it
[1:53:11] you don't worry about it
[1:53:13] amen
[1:53:14] and the same
[1:53:16] is revealing the hidden mysteries of god
[1:53:19] this is not just god that shows up at
[1:53:21] church for a picnic
[1:53:23] this is not god that comes and has
[1:53:25] ceremony
[1:53:26] this is a god that's a living god
[1:53:29] it's a living fire that's coming my
[1:53:31] brother and sister to burn the dross out
[1:53:33] of us and prepare us i say thank you
[1:53:36] lord for we don't have just this little
[1:53:38] pandering of whatever we don't print a
[1:53:41] sermon a month in advance because that's
[1:53:43] what we do we rely i can't tell you i
[1:53:47] can't speak for anybody else but i want
[1:53:48] to tell you my brother and sister oh let
[1:53:50] me put it like this
[1:53:53] every song that was saying every song
[1:53:55] that was played before the service
[1:53:57] i'm not lifting people up here i want
[1:53:58] you to know i'm talking about my god
[1:54:01] every song played before the service
[1:54:03] every song that was saying every special
[1:54:04] this special that was saying
[1:54:06] this morning
[1:54:08] was thoughts words and whatever that
[1:54:10] crossed upon my heart this morning in
[1:54:12] the early hours
[1:54:14] now i want to throw something out to you
[1:54:16] in closing here
[1:54:18] did god anoint them
[1:54:20] because i was preaching what i was
[1:54:22] preaching
[1:54:23] did god anoint me because they were
[1:54:25] singing
[1:54:26] what they were singing
[1:54:28] or did god come down
[1:54:30] and touch every single
[1:54:33] one of us that's god in our presence
[1:54:37] saints there's no great man there's no
[1:54:40] person with some kind of great influence
[1:54:42] this is god speaking to you in your
[1:54:45] garden speaking to me in my garden
[1:54:47] because he is in love with his bride and
[1:54:50] he's coming down in the cool of the
[1:54:52] evening as it were to speak to her and
[1:54:54] say i hope you had a good day
[1:54:57] and if we haven't had a good day my
[1:54:58] brother and sister then we were probably
[1:55:00] looking at our circumstance and not him
[1:55:07] amen
[1:55:12] i gotta close out i cannot just leave
[1:55:14] this saints okay please forgive me it's
[1:55:16] a little long i hope your mother's day
[1:55:18] lunch is not burning amen take take
[1:55:21] mother to the restaurant give her the
[1:55:23] day off okay
[1:55:24] amen
[1:55:26] now look at this expectations i don't i
[1:55:28] don't mean to be try to be funny i don't
[1:55:30] i don't mean it that way
[1:55:31] now this is not to be humble or to show
[1:55:34] off but from the bottom of my heart i
[1:55:35] wish i had a place where i could work
[1:55:37] while in these meetings that's right so
[1:55:39] i wouldn't have to even take up an
[1:55:41] offering or something that's the truth i
[1:55:43] just dread the thoughts of taking up an
[1:55:45] offering don't you do you don't
[1:55:48] don't know why but i've often seen that
[1:55:50] three things that hinder a minister
[1:55:52] that's right
[1:55:54] that's it that's exactly right
[1:55:56] yeah ouch
[1:55:58] you realize he's not talking to most of
[1:56:00] you there's like three guys here
[1:56:02] four whatever that he's like yes sir
[1:56:06] yeah
[1:56:08] yeah yep
[1:56:11] three things that hinder a minister one
[1:56:14] main three things one of them is money
[1:56:17] and the other is women the other is
[1:56:18] popularity
[1:56:19] that's exactly right and when a man gets
[1:56:21] to a place he just has to scream
[1:56:24] this is why sometimes i raise my voice i
[1:56:26] kind of feel bad it's like lord i don't
[1:56:28] i'm not trying to qualify in this i'm
[1:56:30] i'm sorry i just get excited i can't
[1:56:32] help myself
[1:56:36] yeah
[1:56:37] and i don't get to do it at home when
[1:56:38] i'm studying because our bedroom is
[1:56:40] right next door to my office and it
[1:56:41] wakes sister jerry up
[1:56:45] and her grumpy sister jerry is not good
[1:56:51] one of them's money
[1:56:53] women popularity exactly right when a
[1:56:56] man gets to a place he just has to
[1:56:58] scream and cry and carry on and think so
[1:57:01] much
[1:57:02] of money
[1:57:04] now i'm just going to say it i'm
[1:57:06] just tired of apologizing or trying to
[1:57:09] get people to understand me
[1:57:12] you know i don't even know who in this
[1:57:13] church
[1:57:14] gives anything
[1:57:16] i don't know whether you give a dime or
[1:57:18] 10 million
[1:57:20] well i might notice if you gave 10
[1:57:21] million
[1:57:24] and you know why
[1:57:26] i chose to take that route
[1:57:29] because i recognized it one time in my
[1:57:31] life
[1:57:32] that there's an influence
[1:57:34] how you treat people
[1:57:38] so in case any of you ever felt like i
[1:57:39] was drilling down on you for some reason
[1:57:43] please dismiss that because you see
[1:57:45] you might be the most steady tithe payer
[1:57:48] you might be doing whatever you might
[1:57:49] not be doing nothing at all
[1:57:51] i like the liberty
[1:57:53] that if god lays it on my heart i can
[1:57:55] preach it
[1:57:56] i don't want to be bound up by any idea
[1:57:58] that this family they must they surely
[1:58:01] give more than this family this does
[1:58:03] this and that does that
[1:58:05] no sir i'm sorry you gave unto the lord

[1:58:13] church you know don't let them take
[1:58:15] communion if they're not paying ties you

[1:58:21] god and i want you to set your life
[1:58:24] according to the word on the altar
[1:58:26] before god not paul's altar not paul's
[1:58:29] opinion not paul's position but your
[1:58:32] position before christ
[1:58:34] because you see in the end
[1:58:36] i won't be able to force you to anyway
[1:58:40] then all i've done is alienate you
[1:58:43] okay
[1:58:44] when you get down before the lord

[1:59:06] with money no brother paul has a problem
[1:59:07] with money
[1:59:09] oh some of you looking real nervous now
[1:59:14] paul has a problem with money
[1:59:20] my sister intestify we grew up pretty
[1:59:22] poor
[1:59:23] not super poor
[1:59:25] not dirt poor
[1:59:27] just above dirt poor
[1:59:29] first leaf pour
[1:59:32] i've had an insecurity
[1:59:35] my whole life
[1:59:37] when it comes to money
[1:59:40] and my wife says why don't you buy that
[1:59:41] for yourself i know you want it
[1:59:45] i only have 50 in the swallow to mine
[1:59:47] and that's going to take 40 of them and
[1:59:48] that ain't worth it
[1:59:52] an insecurity i'm not talking about i'm
[1:59:54] some superior deal i have an insecurity
[1:59:56] saints
[1:59:58] i have another insecurity if you want to
[2:00:00] know this morning
[2:00:01] and that would be that i would stand
[2:00:03] before god and be responsible for the
[2:00:04] money you gave him that's right you
[2:00:07] didn't give it to paul you gave it to
[2:00:09] him
[2:00:10] i have an insecurity lord don't let me
[2:00:12] waste your money
[2:00:15] pray for me okay
[2:00:17] pray for me
[2:00:19] amen
[2:00:25] reminds me i
[2:00:26] hope i can just steal this moment from
[2:00:28] you
[2:00:29] years ago i i lied to the church
[2:00:34] i was talking about
[2:00:35] buying pickups and how i like the
[2:00:38] certain pickup but i'll never buy one
[2:00:42] then it got down to be like what was
[2:00:43] that sister jerry december 28th
[2:00:47] and the accountant gets a hold of us and
[2:00:48] says i recommend that you go find
[2:00:51] something you think you need or want
[2:00:53] because you are paying an incredible
[2:00:55] amount of taxes
[2:00:57] and it was like what do i want i don't
[2:00:58] need any more tractors i don't need a
[2:01:00] truck i don't need this i don't need
[2:01:01] that
[2:01:02] a pickup
[2:01:08] but you know the devil got into that
[2:01:11] somebody in the church
[2:01:13] looked me in the face and said i know it
[2:01:15] was our money that bought that pickup
[2:01:19] now i don't like to talk about money
[2:01:21] it's really personal to some people to
[2:01:23] me it's just like a hammer
[2:01:24] amen
[2:01:26] some of you if you go out in your garage
[2:01:28] you'll realize you own five hammers
[2:01:31] you don't come to church boasting i have
[2:01:33] five hammers
[2:01:35] if you want to boast i've got like 40
[2:01:37] screwdrivers anybody can beat that
[2:01:39] brother ivan probably would
[2:01:42] no
[2:01:43] but you know saints god blessed me that
[2:01:45] year and
[2:01:46] we made 300 000 that year
[2:01:50] it's a lot of money
[2:01:52] i've never seen that much money in one
[2:01:53] spot
[2:01:55] and a banker says you better go buy
[2:01:56] something
[2:01:58] now you got to understand i split that
[2:01:59] it doesn't all come to me
[2:02:01] i went and bought a pickup but the devil
[2:02:02] got into that and this brother become
[2:02:05] convinced
[2:02:06] that it was the money of the saints
[2:02:08] bought paul
[2:02:09] a pickup
[2:02:11] and i could not convince him otherwise
[2:02:16] my complex just got more complex
[2:02:22] so i'm making that point
[2:02:26] sometimes the complex for money isn't
[2:02:28] that the preacher took it all and spent
[2:02:30] it he might be twisted up in a knot
[2:02:33] going the other direction
[2:02:36] and it still affect him
[2:02:39] popularity
[2:02:42] that's not one i've ever had to worry
[2:02:43] about
[2:02:44] we can just skip right on over that one
[2:02:46] real quick amen amen so you got to
[2:02:49] scream for money you got to cry you
[2:02:51] ought to carry on think so much of money
[2:02:52] forgets god he's gone
[2:02:54] that's all there is to it that's right
[2:02:57] we have to meet expenses and so forth
[2:02:59] and the next thing when the greatest
[2:03:00] respects for women now i want you to
[2:03:02] know the prophet of god had a sense of
[2:03:04] humor for those that you're going to
[2:03:05] outrun me and read this way before i get
[2:03:07] there
[2:03:08] amen
[2:03:10] i have the greatest respects for women
[2:03:12] christian women i think that a good
[2:03:14] woman is one of oh
[2:03:16] now look what brother brahms talking
[2:03:18] about here
[2:03:20] talking about good gifts
[2:03:23] blessings
[2:03:24] he says a good woman
[2:03:26] is one of the best gifts one of the best
[2:03:27] blessings
[2:03:29] one of the best
[2:03:30] oh
[2:03:32] amen come on
[2:03:34] come on saints i want you to see i don't
[2:03:36] believe the prophet was just speaking
[2:03:38] words out here i believe this was
[2:03:40] anointed
[2:03:41] amen i think a good woman is one of the
[2:03:43] best gifts that god could give a man
[2:03:45] outside of salvation i believe that a
[2:03:48] good woman but i better keep still right
[2:03:51] there
[2:03:52] those are reading with me
[2:03:55] i married a little fat girl up there
[2:03:58] tell me
[2:03:59] you guys think i wrote sister jerry here
[2:04:01] at the church
[2:04:02] you guys think i've thrown sister jerry
[2:04:04] under the bus i haven't even started
[2:04:08] i haven't even got close the prophet of
[2:04:10] god said i married a little old fat girl
[2:04:13] imagine how his life felt
[2:04:16] oh my goodness
[2:04:18] i married a little fat girl up there i
[2:04:20] love her with all my heart i never seen
[2:04:23] one to take her place i say god is god
[2:04:26] has blessed us brothers can we say amen
[2:04:29] god has blessed us with one of the best
[2:04:31] gifts outside of salvation and we ought
[2:04:35] not let the devil come and put some nice
[2:04:38] shiny model some shiny this or something
[2:04:40] shiny that it might have a oh oh i'm not
[2:04:43] even stepping out of line the prophet of
[2:04:45] god spoke these words and that little
[2:04:47] girl she had a good figure
[2:04:48] how'd he
[2:04:50] know he's a man
[2:04:53] because he looked doesn't mean he lost
[2:04:55] it
[2:04:56] but they can have a good figure and have
[2:04:59] an attitude they'd fight a buzzsaw
[2:05:02] in a barrel
[2:05:06] yes
[2:05:07] so i know i like his words right because
[2:05:10] he's speaking to us as men
[2:05:13] so i know as long as i stay a christian
[2:05:16] i'll feel that same way
[2:05:18] did you catch the depth of what he just
[2:05:19] declared right there if he was to
[2:05:22] backslide he was telling you i would be
[2:05:24] subject to the same spirits of the world
[2:05:27] out here if i wasn't serving god
[2:05:31] oh brothers if we have struggles then
[2:05:34] get close get that proximity to the word
[2:05:37] get so close to christ you can't see it
[2:05:39] and the prophet of god even dwelt with
[2:05:41] that and said hang that cross on your
[2:05:42] mirror and when it's there you look to
[2:05:45] that cross
[2:05:50] oh hallelujah that wasn't too
[2:05:51] straightforward was it the next thing is
[2:05:53] popularity when sometimes god can give a
[2:05:55] man just a little bit a few friends or
[2:05:57] something and they which we all love
[2:05:59] friends now don't get me wrong i just
[2:06:01] love friends but when you get to
[2:06:03] thinking
[2:06:05] maybe you've had a little
[2:06:07] audience
[2:06:09] of people or something a little above
[2:06:10] the average begin to think
[2:06:13] look who i am brother
[2:06:15] you're on your road right down
[2:06:18] there
[2:06:19] right then that's right
[2:06:21] so it should be that way god knows
[2:06:23] what's best
[2:06:24] that's true you have to watch that satan
[2:06:27] sure throws it out there
[2:06:29] awful
[2:06:30] flowery
[2:06:31] but if we stay just under the blood
[2:06:34] and you pray that i will now remember
[2:06:36] i'm i could fall but if you keep praying
[2:06:38] for me and god keeps loving me i'll make
[2:06:40] it
[2:06:41] now that's a recipe for every one of us
[2:06:43] under this rule let's just keep praying
[2:06:45] for one another let's keep lifting one
[2:06:47] another up we'll make it
[2:06:50] oh but if the devil ever divides us
[2:06:53] he can just sit back and watch us
[2:06:55] cannibalize each other
[2:06:57] come on
[2:06:58] let's be men and women enough to say
[2:07:00] lord i don't like that spirit that
[2:07:01] causes me to criticize
[2:07:03] i don't like that spirit that causes me
[2:07:05] not to want to be around them lord
[2:07:07] humble me that i can love my brothers
[2:07:09] and sisters
[2:07:10] amen because he says but if you keep
[2:07:12] praying for me and god keeps loving me
[2:07:15] i'll make it
[2:07:16] hallelujah god will continue to love me
[2:07:18] then amen hallelujah
[2:07:21] i love that let's just go back a little
[2:07:23] reminder
[2:07:25] i think that a good woman is one of the
[2:07:26] best gifts that god could give a man
[2:07:29] outside of salvation
[2:07:31] brothers sisters
[2:07:33] we're here it's mother's day
[2:07:35] we're blessed with the greatest
[2:07:37] blessings
[2:07:39] as it would be if time terry some of our
[2:07:41] young sisters will get married that fall
[2:07:42] in love get married supposed to fall in
[2:07:44] love first young ladies i make sure
[2:07:46] clarify that
[2:07:48] fall in love get married
[2:07:51] but you know what comes before that can
[2:07:52] some of you young ladies
[2:07:55] young men answer what comes before
[2:07:57] that
[2:08:03] no parents you can't cheat
[2:08:07] the holy ghost
[2:08:10] the holy ghost comes before them
[2:08:13] you see
[2:08:14] god will still be gracious he was to
[2:08:16] jerry and i
[2:08:18] but i'm telling you it's a terrible
[2:08:19] price to pay
[2:08:21] find the young man find the young woman
[2:08:23] get it all set in order
[2:08:26] and then you'll be able to sit here and
[2:08:28] look at this quote and say that's the
[2:08:30] truth
[2:08:31] that's the truth that's the truth
[2:08:34] hallelujah hallelujah oh sister emmy
[2:08:37] musicians please come i got several more
[2:08:39] thoughts here
[2:08:41] but let me just throw this out to you

[2:08:44] the summary of the greatest things now i
[2:08:45] know this is not all-inclusive
[2:08:48] but salvation eternal life
[2:08:50] and there's so much encompasses in that
[2:08:53] healing is one of the greatest things
[2:08:55] that have been given to us godly wife
[2:08:58] is one of the greatest things given to
[2:09:00] us and i'm just going to add to this in
[2:09:02] this sense young ladies

[2:09:32] the right preacher
[2:09:36] no
[2:09:37] cry out for it
[2:09:39] cry out for it
[2:09:41] amen amen
[2:09:44] revelations 2 21 9
[2:09:46] says come hither i'll show you thee the
[2:09:48] bride the lamb's wife my brother and
[2:09:50] sister the word clearly shows us this is
[2:09:52] season
[2:09:53] this is the season
[2:09:55] the lamb's wife is on display
[2:09:57] and then she's walking on the earth
[2:09:59] today
[2:10:00] and it's by her testimony that this
[2:10:03] gospel is being shared
[2:10:06] this gospel being shared
[2:10:08] you know reminds me this happened in
[2:10:11] chile quite a few years ago
[2:10:14] if i could remember the believer's names
[2:10:17] the sergio says nazareth would know them
[2:10:20] lovely sister
[2:10:25] young man been raised in the message and
[2:10:27] his parents kept sending him message
[2:10:29] books
[2:10:31] him and his wife would throw him in the
[2:10:32] trash now in chile you have to
[2:10:34] understand the trash deal is usually
[2:10:36] about yay so
[2:10:38] off the ground
[2:10:39] you put your trash up there to keep the
[2:10:41] dogs or anything out of it
[2:10:44] this sister is out there looking at the
[2:10:46] trash and here's this fresh white
[2:10:49] book
[2:10:54] and she's like i wonder what that is
[2:10:58] yeah i know seems kind of odd that god
[2:11:01] would let his word get thrown in the
[2:11:02] trash
[2:11:04] so that someone else
[2:11:06] could come
[2:11:07] i also know a brother that got his off
[2:11:09] the back of a toilet in a public place
[2:11:14] sister pulled the book out
[2:11:16] started reading it
[2:11:18] took a little step stool out there and
[2:11:19] climbed up on it looked in the trash and
[2:11:21] fetched out a couple more
[2:11:24] and every week when the trash got put
[2:11:26] out she started just going out there
[2:11:27] because she knew they'd be there and
[2:11:29] pulling his message books gives her
[2:11:31] heart to the lord
[2:11:34] it's so empowered
[2:11:36] what god has done for her that she goes
[2:11:38] one day and knocks on the door
[2:11:40] [Music]
[2:11:42] he answers the door she's got a whole
[2:11:45] handful of message books
[2:11:47] she's like how could you take something
[2:11:51] so precious
[2:11:55] and throw it away
[2:11:58] [Music]
[2:12:01] oh i don't know could we say yes lord i
[2:12:03] need a neighbor like that
[2:12:06] or would we say oh lord i hope i don't
[2:12:08] have a neighbor like that
[2:12:10] every week
[2:12:13] she went and preached him a sermon
[2:12:15] on the doorstep
[2:12:17] of his house
[2:12:18] until he finally gave his heart back to
[2:12:20] the lord
[2:12:22] she said i'm not your mother i'm in a
[2:12:24] position better than your mother i am
[2:12:26] your sister in christ
[2:12:29] and you cannot abandon
[2:12:32] something of such value
[2:12:34] such treasure
[2:12:37] finally his heart started breaking
[2:12:39] young man's wife was like don't let her
[2:12:41] bother you like that
[2:12:42] but she gave her heart to the lord
[2:12:44] before he did
[2:12:46] i don't know

[2:12:59] of course is our lord jesus christ the
[2:13:01] holy ghost but my brother and sister
