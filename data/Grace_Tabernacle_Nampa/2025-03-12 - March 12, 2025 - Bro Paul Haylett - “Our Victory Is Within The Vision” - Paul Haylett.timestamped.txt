[37:50] his wife's name I thought it was Katie
[37:52] is that right yes it is let's remember
[37:55] them I believe God's doing something
[37:57] brother Mass has been reaching out and
[38:00] um you know I I just uh I love that
[38:02] young man uh with a huge chunk of my
[38:05] heart and uh we just want to lift him
[38:08] and Katie up in prayer amen now I don't
[38:13] know that we Fellowship so much you know
[38:16] just the way things are sometimes but
[38:18] brother Salim and his sister sister
[38:20] Wonder been fellowshipping coming as
[38:23] much as they can sometimes we don't see
[38:26] them uh but uh work is varied and uh
[38:30] brother Salim is in need of work and uh
[38:33] we just want to lift that uh before the
[38:36] Lord uh that the Lord would just provide
[38:39] him a job sister Wander wants a job that
[38:43] allows her to come to church she's
[38:44] probably at work right now and um you
[38:48] know uh sometimes I hear a few Sundays
[38:50] ago uh I'll just be blunt about it she
[38:53] fell asleep in
[38:55] church but we probably would have all
[38:57] also if we had worked almost the whole
[39:01] night so we just want the Lord to come
[39:03] on this scene for brother Sim and sister
[39:07] wonder and uh in the whole works the
[39:09] Lord's in control but uh they got family
[39:13] that's supposed to be in transition uh
[39:15] Refugee status to come here uh and seems
[39:19] like all of that's went into slow motion
[39:21] uh we want God's perfect will amen my
[39:24] daughter jool Lin sister jool ly has uh
[39:28] uh you might say a little bit
[39:29] self-inflicted but she has quite a
[39:31] school load that she's working a job and
[39:34] and trying to do her schooling so we
[39:37] want to definitely um
[39:40] uh you know lift her up before the Lord
[39:43] amen and uh my sister sister Susan has
[39:48] been notified that her job is ending so
[39:52] we want to help her by praying for her
[39:55] amen so I don't know if we missed a
[39:58] prayer request uh we've missed any
[40:00] acknowledgments um uh the Lord forgive
[40:03] us and uh just help us the Lord knows
[40:07] amen I want to speak to you thank you
[40:09] musicians a lovely song service
[40:11] appreciate our musicians amen some of
[40:14] them are awall but um the Lord knows
[40:17] that also and uh we will do you guys
[40:22] know what awall
[40:26] means absent without
[40:31] leave anyway um don't want to be labor
[40:35] that I want to speak to you tonight uh
[40:37] on uh a thought our Victory is within
[40:42] the vision and uh we take this out of uh
[40:46] message we'll get to it here in a little
[40:48] bit uh and you will catch this at that
[40:51] time but remember our Victory is within
[40:55] the vision amen so when when you see
[40:58] what God has done in our day every drop
[41:01] of what the opening of the word was here
[41:05] to give the bride victory in leoda we're
[41:09] not here he didn't bring us this far to
[41:11] abandon us or to see us lose the battle
[41:14] but it every drop of it is to bring us
[41:17] into a position of Victory now I believe
[41:20] that was brother Kenny caps here a few
[41:22] years ago now brother Kenny is a very
[41:24] Lively guy I was kind of thinking we
[41:26] might ought to bring him here and get
[41:27] some of us a little more lively also but
[41:30] brother Kenny uh you know was making the
[41:33] point that uh why do we need to wait
[41:36] till then to do our Victory lap and when
[41:40] you think about that my brother and
[41:41] sister now this is not to cause us to
[41:44] just go running wildly around the church
[41:46] you can have your Victory lap in your
[41:48] prayer Closet in your car at work or
[41:51] whatever but you see we're always
[41:53] looking off somewhere into the future
[41:55] that oh we're going to have this victory
[41:57] but the word says we have Victory now
[42:00] and so let's just believe the word and
[42:02] act upon that today and and let the word
[42:05] speak to our heart let's turn in
[42:07] Proverbs
[42:08] 28:19 very common scripture I just
[42:10] preached on it here uh recently as part
[42:13] of a thought there but uh it just come
[42:15] back to me as we were looking and saw
[42:18] these things in the message and uh I
[42:21] just uh got a little excited amen now
[42:24] the Lord just help us tonight proverbs
[42:27] 2918 where there is no vision the people
[42:31] perish but he that keepeth the law happy
[42:35] is he amen Lord we ask you for your
[42:39] blessing upon the word in the name of
[42:41] Jesus Christ amen God bless you good to
[42:45] see you my friend amen you may be
[42:49] seated now when you look at the
[42:51] definition of vision uh it it says it's
[42:55] an ability to see but it's also an
[42:58] ability to think or plan the future and
[43:01] so it's easy for us to look into the
[43:04] past and uh many times now but as we go
[43:08] I think this will all fall in place I
[43:10] trust that it does uh but we can look
[43:12] into the past and we can see our
[43:15] victories and we can also see our defeat
[43:18] and Satan certainly would cause us to
[43:20] focus on our defeat and it seems as
[43:24] though Satan whenever we would look in
[43:26] the past and say boy I I see this time I
[43:29] see Victory there I saw the Lord coming
[43:32] on the scene now often times we talk
[43:35] about don't be looking back but my
[43:37] brother and sister sometimes I think it
[43:39] maybe is good for us to stop and look
[43:42] back and see what the Lord has done as a
[43:44] reminder now when Israel was going
[43:46] through the Wilderness and crossing over
[43:48] the Jordan God stopped them and they put
[43:51] these pillars these landmarks and they
[43:54] were there not for the moment to glory
[43:56] in but for other generations to be able
[44:00] to see that there was a victory that
[44:03] there was an overcoming and so let's not
[44:06] talk about it in an arrogant I did this
[44:08] sister Jerry and I just visiting about
[44:10] this today it's not the fact that we can
[44:13] say I was here I prayed for them I
[44:15] preached this service but it is more
[44:17] like the privilege that God gave us to
[44:20] be part of what he was doing it is not
[44:23] us not one portion other than as a
[44:26] surrender vessel and then the Lord says
[44:29] I'm going to use you and I give you the
[44:32] privilege to be part of my plan part of
[44:34] my work maybe part of a Deliverance
[44:37] probably part of a healing whatever it
[44:39] might be we were given the privilege to
[44:41] be part of that and so it's not so bad
[44:44] sometimes to see the past and certainly
[44:47] here in the present if we are not seeing
[44:49] the Lord move in our midst today
[44:52] something's missing there should be a
[44:54] time of desperation if we are not seeing
[44:58] God present in our lives now my brother
[45:01] and sister when we look into the future
[45:03] our problem is is often times we look at
[45:07] it and say you know when this happens
[45:10] well my brother and sister that's your
[45:13] thought God didn't say I'm going to
[45:15] redeem you save you deliver you uh heal
[45:18] you when this happens he gave us a word
[45:22] and that word is as solid as the very
[45:24] Earth we stand on today more solid he's
[45:27] the one who created this Earth more
[45:29] solid than this Earth we stand on and he
[45:32] doesn't put conditions on it the way we
[45:35] do now my brother and sister he does put
[45:37] conditions like when it comes to
[45:39] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:41] we don't go live like the world immerse
[45:43] in the world act like the world and
[45:45] claim the Holy Ghost now people do claim
[45:48] that but they're actually fooling
[45:50] themselves when they claim that because
[45:52] God says I'm going to wash you I'm going
[45:53] to prepare you then I'll fill you amen
[45:56] so look at that but we don't want to
[45:58] make that too complicated and you see
[46:00] much of this is actually expressed under
[46:03] man's Vision so we see today a man has
[46:06] got a vision and and this is not nothing
[46:09] wrong with that but man has a vision but
[46:12] what the prophet showed us very clearly
[46:13] is we need to make sure our vision lines
[46:16] up with God's Vision because we can have
[46:19] a vision of our own of what we believe
[46:22] God should do or how he should do it and
[46:25] actually miss the mark now as you study
[46:28] and listen to the message you'll know
[46:29] that these are words that the prophet of
[46:31] God said so we're not here to create our
[46:34] own Mark we're here to have our lives
[46:37] hit the mark of the word now it's going
[46:40] to take the word to guide us to the word
[46:43] right amen it'll never be flesh never be
[46:45] carnal man never be intelligence never
[46:47] be the the Natural Things taking us to
[46:50] the word but it's always God so I want
[46:52] to ask you the last time that you had an
[46:55] aha moment amen
[46:57] there was an element right there that
[46:59] you did not go back to and say man I'm
[47:02] so glad I figured this out it's always
[47:05] just that the aha moment God opening the
[47:08] word you're listening to the prophet
[47:09] you've picked up your Bible suddenly
[47:11] something ties together something speaks
[47:14] to you and you know that flesh did not
[47:16] do that intelligence did not do that
[47:19] learning did not do that that is the
[47:22] presence of God that's the Holy Spirit
[47:24] guiding you amen into the
[47:28] word well thank you Lord amen now you
[47:32] see my brother and sister we've got two
[47:34] sides of this we got man's vision and uh
[47:38] you know if you read a little history
[47:40] you'll it'll talk about here in the
[47:42] United States and I believe every nation
[47:44] would be the same they give some credit
[47:46] to certain men who had a vision of what
[47:49] should happen and do that but my brother
[47:52] and sister we know according to the word
[47:54] of God even the great founders of this
[47:57] Nation right here they say oh George
[47:59] Washington Abraham Lincoln their Vision
[48:02] my brother and sister they had no vision
[48:04] it was God forming this nation to fit
[48:07] the scripture amen he did not write the
[48:10] scripture to fit what the nation would
[48:12] have ply become but the nation was
[48:15] formed to the scripture and did that so
[48:18] even these great men were then anointed
[48:22] by God to to speak to do to guide direct
[48:26] what whatever and it is that there is a
[48:28] vision that must take place and so as
[48:31] we'll see this we go away from man's
[48:34] vision and we'll go into uh brother
[48:37] bram's life for just a minute or two
[48:39] here my brother and sister you see how
[48:42] God use that and and many things the
[48:44] prophet of God is said in the past now
[48:48] people have said we believe this this
[48:51] happened here and this happened here so
[48:53] this must happen here but brother and
[48:55] sister you see
[48:57] the prophetic vision is going to
[49:00] override the carnal Vision there's
[49:04] nothing there that's going to override
[49:06] the word so we don't have to worry about
[49:08] it if people say oh this is we
[49:11] prophesied my brother and sister I don't
[49:13] want to speak any negative thing tonight
[49:15] but my brother and sister through the
[49:16] years I've heard a lot of prophecies
[49:19] that never came to pass now if we focus
[49:22] now do we agree with that no I'm not
[49:24] talking about denomination I'm talking
[49:26] about the word world I'm talking around
[49:27] the message and they prophesy these
[49:29] things they don't come to pass we can
[49:31] get uh doubtful we can say well this
[49:34] must not be but my brother and sister if
[49:36] you weren't the one that was there
[49:38] making the prophecy that doesn't come to
[49:40] pass you don't need to worry about that
[49:42] you need to stick with the vision of the
[49:45] word and stay with that because whatever
[49:48] is there good people godly people maybe
[49:51] misguided people whatever it might be
[49:53] but remember you're not responsible for
[49:56] their vision
[49:57] you're responsible for your vision so
[49:59] the prophet comes and he starts to open
[50:01] the word to us and my brother and sister
[50:04] the message as it has been preached has
[50:07] brought forth and is contained and I
[50:10] bear with my words many Mysteries yet to
[50:14] be
[50:17] revealed now you can take that and say
[50:19] wait it says all the Mysteries will be
[50:21] revealed but my brother and sister let
[50:23] me put it in this context there's men
[50:25] and women out here not even saved yet
[50:28] that I believe God has called the
[50:30] mystery still has to be revealed to them
[50:34] see we can bring it all in and say these
[50:36] things are all done but until it's done
[50:38] with the last one in the bride it's not
[50:42] finished and I say thank you Lord so we
[50:45] look at this this scriptural or
[50:47] spiritual vision something coming from
[50:49] the Lord revealed to man now my brother
[50:52] and sister you would look at that and we
[50:55] study the scripture we study stud the
[50:57] message and and we tend to say oh I see
[51:00] this now but remember every Revelation
[51:03] is a supernatural element that's right
[51:06] it has to be Supernatural God revealing
[51:09] his own word amen and he brings it to
[51:12] pass interprets it to his Believers to
[51:16] his people and it actually is much more
[51:20] Supernatural than we actually give
[51:22] credit for people say where is the
[51:25] supernatural every time the word is open
[51:28] to you a supernatural event took place
[51:32] otherwise we would be sitting here today
[51:35] intellectual Believers there's nothing
[51:38] wrong with being a smart individual a
[51:40] studied individual that understands and
[51:43] sees things but we need to constantly go
[51:46] back and let the spiritual element guide
[51:49] our understanding amen now look at this
[51:52] just a simple maybe too simple of an
[51:55] example but uh brother brandham you know
[51:57] originally his interpretation
[52:00] understanding about the horse riders and
[52:02] then he comes back later and says no the
[52:05] Lord revealed it to me this is what it
[52:07] was now you'd say oh oh that happened to
[52:10] the prophet it happens to you that's
[52:12] right it's happening to you today cuz
[52:14] God promised you could not be deceived
[52:18] and so everything that we might be to
[52:20] the edge of God's promise that you
[52:23] cannot be deceived is going to pull you
[52:26] you back into the word just as it did
[52:29] the prophet on some of these doctrinal
[52:31] things and so we look at that oh I'm not
[52:33] trying to put us there with the prophet
[52:35] but yet I am because everything that was
[52:37] poured into Christ was poured into the
[52:39] church and the first fruits the law of
[52:42] the first fruits means that everything
[52:43] that come to the prophet has come to you
[52:46] now we're not called to be prophets I'm
[52:48] not called to to uh uh prophesy and and
[52:51] do those things but yet you'll find that
[52:54] you actually are
[52:57] you prophesy when you stand up and say I
[52:59] am going to praise God and glorify him
[53:02] today I'm going to be an overcomer in
[53:04] this day and March out of the house you
[53:06] are prophesying your day that's exactly
[53:09] right and the people think out here in
[53:10] the denominational world that that's all
[53:13] a lot of them oh that's all crazy but
[53:15] it's the word that's right it's the word
[53:17] that's why the prophet of God said don't
[53:19] be letting those negative things that's
[53:22] right come out of your mouth because
[53:24] you're prophesying negative
[53:27] but let us speak the positive I'm going
[53:29] to be an overcomer today amen I'm going
[53:31] to serve God with all my heart mind body
[53:34] and soul the rest of this week I am
[53:36] going to walk faithful I'm going to
[53:38] stand on this and Satan you might try to
[53:41] Buffet me but the word says amen what
[53:44] are you doing you're claiming your
[53:46] position by Spoken Word now you can keep
[53:49] those silent if you want but I'm finding
[53:51] it's more effective when you speak it
[53:53] amen so it's there that something coming
[53:56] from the Lord is revealed to man that's
[54:00] Supernatural That's not a carnal thing
[54:03] too many people have carnal lied is that
[54:06] a word I almost said carmalized carnal
[54:10] lied they've carnal lied the move of God
[54:14] they just like yeah okay God's doing
[54:17] this but my brother and sister let's
[54:19] stop and realize every footstep is this
[54:22] not the word every footstep that you
[54:25] make has been ordered of the Lord that
[54:29] is a supernatural event taking place
[54:32] because he has already saw that
[54:35] footprint that step and has given his
[54:39] approval to it and if not my brother and
[54:41] sister it would be different but God is
[54:43] allowing us to walk the journey that we
[54:45] walk just like job amen he had to walk
[54:49] that Journey my brother and sister just
[54:51] like Gideon amen Gideon walked by that
[54:54] rock there at the wine press uh 100 if
[54:57] not a thousand times until one day
[55:00] Revelation strikes him it's not some
[55:02] little oh I have an urge but God come
[55:06] Supernatural Revelation and here is
[55:09] Gideon realizing he's talking to a
[55:13] rock and that rock is Christ amen and
[55:17] that Supernatural event taking place in
[55:19] Gideon's life changed him amen entirely
[55:23] amen now you think about these things my
[55:26] brother brother and sister and I and
[55:27] that's been a subject I haven't preached
[55:29] on for quite a while but you you know
[55:31] it's it's very interesting because just
[55:34] a few things changed it such as take
[55:37] them all down to the brook and have them
[55:40] take a
[55:41] drink is that spiritual yes it's very
[55:46] spiritual but without understanding from
[55:48] the Lord it just sounds like he's
[55:50] picking on these guys that that tend and
[55:52] put their face in the water and he's
[55:54] given these others but you see my
[55:56] brother and sisters a lot of spiritual
[55:58] uh scriptural depth into this of what he
[56:00] was looking
[56:04] for so at the opening of a word it was
[56:08] not a man's effort my brother and sister
[56:10] when the prophet of God comes and says
[56:12] you know uh in the middle of the night
[56:14] you know 3 4:00 and the Lord was speak
[56:17] excuse me speaking to me and and and
[56:20] these things we can look at that now we
[56:23] weren't there to to experience it but
[56:26] we're going to touch on some things
[56:27] about experience in a minute but I hope
[56:30] right now that I'm talking to a people
[56:32] that have experienced what it is to have
[56:34] God come and wake you up people who that
[56:37] know that God is speaking to you and
[56:40] it's time for you maybe to roll over uh
[56:42] put your face to the floor put that and
[56:45] and speak back to him not just say oh I
[56:47] have insomnia I can't sleep my brother
[56:50] and sister that might be the human uh uh
[56:53] uh diagnosis of it but most the time I
[56:56] would say that it's God waking you up
[56:59] God wanting to have a conversation that
[57:01] we were too busy in the day to have and
[57:04] he wants to speak to us amen so the
[57:07] opening of the word is not a man's
[57:09] effort cuz I can say right now no man
[57:12] can open the word amen you can study
[57:15] that you you read and you know I love to
[57:17] read and these people say we'll never
[57:19] fully understand the Bible until we
[57:21] learn Hebrew and the aramic I'll tell
[57:24] you we'll never fully understand the
[57:26] until we get sincere enough before God
[57:29] to come to the place he says I will
[57:31] reveal myself to you amen it's not about
[57:34] learning words and definitions it's
[57:36] about Christ himself in the written word
[57:39] revealing himself and education will not
[57:42] give that to
[57:44] you and so God is using men but God is
[57:48] not allowing man to take the rain amen
[57:51] amen we look at the church age book when
[57:54] you see what was written
[57:56] laid out there the seals when you see
[57:59] what is written out there my brother and
[58:02] sister they're the Deep things of the
[58:04] word you can't understand the age we
[58:07] live in without understanding those two
[58:10] books amen you can say well God's come
[58:13] there's going to be a Rapture my brother
[58:15] and sister what God's doing is leading
[58:17] us up to the Revelation and the
[58:19] revelation of the Rapture will be
[58:21] manifested in us it's not intellectually
[58:24] collected or put together in a library
[58:27] but it's actually leading us to that
[58:29] Revelation and so it's there within the
[58:32] vision amen inside the vision my brother
[58:35] and sister is our Victory it's not a
[58:38] victory that's just obvious to the world
[58:40] today I I I I would say some things they
[58:43] sound kind of a little harsh I guess I
[58:45] would say but my brother and sister
[58:47] people stab at the word they're trying
[58:49] to dig in they're trying to get a hold
[58:50] of this and they're standing up and
[58:52] saying oh the Lord told me my brother
[58:54] and sister the Lord told them something
[58:56] completely contrary to the word of God
[58:59] I'm sorry the prophet of God said God
[59:01] would never lead you away from his word
[59:04] and so we sit here today to see that God
[59:07] is bringing us to a place that the very
[59:09] Vision that we see as Sons and Daughters
[59:11] of godone is his vision it's not our
[59:14] vision now you know God's promise of the
[59:17] Mysteries being
[59:22] revealed can we explain all the
[59:24] Mysteries no
[59:27] where are they revealed
[59:32] at people are looking for a mystery
[59:34] explained on a written page projected on
[59:37] his
[59:38] screen but the real mystery the final
[59:41] mystery of who we are is revealed in
[59:45] this
[59:46] Tabernacle amen God is not putting his
[59:49] word out here for an intellectual man to
[59:52] dissect it like a sentence but he's
[59:55] revealing it and Sons and Daughters of
[59:57] God and vessels that he knows he can
[1:00:00] trust and that mystery is now starting
[1:00:02] to be revealed but my brother and sister
[1:00:04] as we look at this and say well Lord why
[1:00:06] me well that's really actually a very
[1:00:09] valid question because God's going to
[1:00:11] allow your Humanity to remain your
[1:00:13] Humanity he's not taking your Humanity
[1:00:16] from you and it's there as the Apostle
[1:00:19] Paul said I have this thorn in my f
[1:00:22] flesh lest I would boast
[1:00:27] be
[1:00:29] exalted so what's the Apostle Paul
[1:00:31] telling us without the thorn that's it
[1:00:36] he would exalt
[1:00:37] himself oh come on are We any humans
[1:00:40] here tonight amen I'll tell you it's
[1:00:43] there I think the preachers would would
[1:00:46] would definitely relate to this there's
[1:00:48] times God's allow you to be somewhere
[1:00:50] you preach something something
[1:00:52] Supernatural happens somebody gets
[1:00:53] delivered somebody gets healed and and
[1:00:56] you know and without the thorn of our
[1:00:58] flesh we would actually think we're
[1:01:00] something but God says I'll remind you
[1:01:04] that it's not you it's me in you amen
[1:01:07] and the only reason you're a vessel of
[1:01:09] honor is cuz I washed you amen amen amen
[1:01:13] and so then the mystery continues to be
[1:01:16] revealed in you and I amen now we look
[1:01:20] at the nature of a
[1:01:23] man I kind of phrase these these words
[1:01:26] here looking at retrospec at myself the
[1:01:30] nature of man a man labors when he
[1:01:34] should wait yeah and he waits when he
[1:01:38] should labor right amen you see we we
[1:01:42] never quite can get it right I can only
[1:01:45] imagine what it would have been like if
[1:01:46] we were allowed to see a very clear
[1:01:48] picture of the Apostle
[1:01:50] Paul we look at that and we just have
[1:01:52] such a vision of the Apostle Paul and
[1:01:55] truly we should he was God's vessel for
[1:01:57] the day and Supernatural but my brother
[1:02:00] and sister we' to went wait what are you
[1:02:02] doing
[1:02:04] Paul and Paul would be saying well I
[1:02:07] don't know I don't know if God wants me
[1:02:08] to come or go so I'm going to just go
[1:02:10] sew some tents Y and God's like you
[1:02:12] should have been packing Paul going over
[1:02:15] here but you see that's the nature of
[1:02:18] humanity and as we look at this we
[1:02:20] struggle with this because how many
[1:02:23] times I'm setting you up for something
[1:02:25] I'll just be honest okay I'm setting you
[1:02:27] up for something but look we
[1:02:30] labor when we should be trusting
[1:02:34] God and then the time comes that God
[1:02:37] says I'm going to perform
[1:02:39] this and we're going to just sit here
[1:02:41] and say I'm going to trust God and we
[1:02:43] should actually be in action that's
[1:02:46] right TR I messed up last time I went
[1:02:49] when I should have stayed now I'm going
[1:02:51] to stay even though God's saying
[1:02:53] go that's the nature of humanity
[1:02:57] we're we're out of time we're out of SN
[1:02:59] with God and Isaiah 55: 6-9 seek ye the
[1:03:04] Lord while he may be found call ye upon
[1:03:07] him while he is near let the wicked
[1:03:09] forsake his way and the unrighteous man
[1:03:12] his thoughts and let him return unto the
[1:03:14] Lord and He will have mercy upon him
[1:03:16] look at this the
[1:03:18] wicked turning back to the Lord and the
[1:03:21] word is promising God will have mercy on
[1:03:23] that man I'm telling you that's a
[1:03:25] supernatural thing that's right and to
[1:03:28] our God for he will abundantly pardon
[1:03:30] amen for my thoughts are not your
[1:03:33] thoughts boy how that is drilled home in
[1:03:36] the word my thoughts are not your
[1:03:39] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[1:03:43] saith the Lord this could leave us in a
[1:03:46] great Paradox where we're not sure what
[1:03:48] we should do uh you know waiting now I
[1:03:52] don't say this lightly I don't say it
[1:03:53] demeaning but I've heard many people
[1:03:56] that had obvious issues in their lives
[1:04:00] their marriage their children and they
[1:04:02] would say you know what I'm just waiting
[1:04:04] on the lord well that's wonderful why
[1:04:07] don't you wait on your
[1:04:09] knees amen not not you know with a mocha
[1:04:14] I don't think any of you drink those
[1:04:15] that's why I chose it I'm pointing to
[1:04:18] myself but you see we're waiting on the
[1:04:21] Lord while we're doing our
[1:04:24] thing and God God say you know your way
[1:04:26] of doing it it's not my way of doing it
[1:04:29] the way I want you to wait on me is to
[1:04:31] wait on me in my word wait on me in my
[1:04:34] presence wait on me in this life I've
[1:04:37] called you
[1:04:38] to not just your life not your idea of
[1:04:41] what waiting on the Lord is amen for my
[1:04:44] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[1:04:46] are your ways my ways sayith the Lord
[1:04:48] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:04:50] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:04:54] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[1:04:57] oh my brother and sister I want to ask
[1:04:59] you within this Vision or make a
[1:05:01] statement I guess within this Vision
[1:05:03] that the Lord is releasing through the
[1:05:05] open word there is Victory amen every
[1:05:08] bit of this message as we call it amen
[1:05:11] and I just frame it that way my brother
[1:05:13] and sister not not casting shadow that
[1:05:16] as we call it the message my brother and
[1:05:19] sister everything within that message do
[1:05:21] I believe every word brother Bram said
[1:05:23] was perfect well you know that's such a
[1:05:25] complex thing people getting whole
[1:05:27] arguments uh you know go out behind the
[1:05:29] church and Slug It Out so every word he
[1:05:32] said is perfect and I'll tell you what I
[1:05:34] actually have come to the Revelation
[1:05:36] every word he said is perfect it was
[1:05:39] perfect to God's will at that time that
[1:05:42] what was spoken the prophet didn't go
[1:05:44] out here on some kind of thing going out
[1:05:46] here into Neverland but you see God said
[1:05:49] it's perfect in this moment and now I'm
[1:05:52] taking you my brother and sister he
[1:05:54] didn't say hey look to the serpent and
[1:05:57] live and then look to the serpent and
[1:05:59] cross
[1:06:01] Jordan the serpent was perfect in its
[1:06:05] season and the prophet's words were
[1:06:07] spoken perfect in their season it was a
[1:06:11] coming out leading us to a crossing over
[1:06:14] to an entering in amen and the word had
[1:06:17] to be perfect for this season that we
[1:06:19] are in amen and so as we move forward we
[1:06:22] realize there wasn't a time I I've
[1:06:25] shared this to the church first time I
[1:06:27] heard amen a brother preach on the on
[1:06:29] the third poll I was like what in the
[1:06:31] world is he talking about Amen brother
[1:06:33] Harold hilderbrandt preaching right over
[1:06:36] there in the little church in Star
[1:06:37] doesn't even exist anymore and brother
[1:06:39] Harold preaching on on the third poll
[1:06:42] and I I'm just writing a note third pole
[1:06:44] with a big check mark like what is this
[1:06:46] but did you know God in his grace and
[1:06:48] mercy everything I picked up or listened
[1:06:51] to after that was third pole third pole
[1:06:54] third pole and I realized that was God
[1:06:57] in a season took me now let's not look
[1:07:00] at the prophet's message here but took
[1:07:02] me from a time that this was relevant
[1:07:05] everything the prophet was saying
[1:07:07] relevant you were him in him before the
[1:07:10] foundation of the world and that come in
[1:07:12] a right season for me and I latched on
[1:07:14] to that and my fears and my doubts that
[1:07:16] I was not even called started to Vapor
[1:07:19] away because I realized it wasn't
[1:07:21] yesterday it wasn't at that Altar and I
[1:07:24] was here at that altar but I made a
[1:07:26] mistake afterwards what do I do but to
[1:07:29] wake up and realize I'm a Son of God
[1:07:32] from before the foundation of the world
[1:07:34] and the third poll my brother and sister
[1:07:37] it wasn't based on when I saw it or it
[1:07:39] was revealed to me but God revealed it
[1:07:42] to me in that season amen amen and in
[1:07:46] that season I had a growth spurt
[1:07:49] amen amen that's right now this might
[1:07:51] not mean much to a farmer to anybody but
[1:07:54] a farmer but you know when you have corn
[1:07:57] about knee
[1:07:58] high and you're going to run now sorry
[1:08:01] about terminology but you're going to
[1:08:03] run a dammer Dyer through that and put
[1:08:05] little pockets in the soil to hold the
[1:08:07] water so it doesn't run
[1:08:09] off sometimes I think we as Christians
[1:08:12] need a dam or Dy or ran over
[1:08:15] us that the water of the word wouldn't
[1:08:19] just run off
[1:08:22] yeah but you know
[1:08:25] when you open that ground up you better
[1:08:27] be done because the
[1:08:30] combination of the disturbing of the
[1:08:34] soil the sunlight and
[1:08:38] oxygen within days corn it's taken weeks
[1:08:41] to grow this
[1:08:43] tall and when within days it will be
[1:08:47] this tall every year sister Jerry and I
[1:08:50] hope you catch the correlation of what
[1:08:51] I'm trying to express it's in the
[1:08:54] disturbing of our present condition
[1:08:57] that's
[1:08:58] it that's it and every year sister Jerry
[1:09:01] and I we have our little our little
[1:09:02] tradition as it were and we're standing
[1:09:05] out there and and you know it's June
[1:09:07] 25th and we're like man this Corn's not
[1:09:09] going to be like it was last year Fourth
[1:09:11] of July every year we're shooting for
[1:09:14] corn that's at least as tall as I am if
[1:09:16] not taller we love to boast our picture
[1:09:18] you know we love to you know
[1:09:22] anyway but here's this corn and you
[1:09:24] think it's not going to do
[1:09:27] it but the element amen the promise of
[1:09:30] the revealed word amen that's right
[1:09:33] every seed must bring forth of its own
[1:09:36] kind amen and in the disturbing of the
[1:09:38] soil it starts an action exactly that
[1:09:41] corn goes from knee high that's it to
[1:09:44] head high Y to beyond the touch of your
[1:09:48] fingers high in a very brief time this
[1:09:53] what God's wanting to do in our lives my
[1:09:55] brother and sister not us to sit here
[1:09:56] and say I've been a message believer my
[1:09:58] whole life and I don't see it no God
[1:10:02] wants to disturb us he wants to upheave
[1:10:05] us he wants to do this and give us a
[1:10:07] little spiritual oxygen that we would
[1:10:09] then have a growth spurt amen so the the
[1:10:13] vision the Lord's releasing through the
[1:10:15] open word there is Victory I want to be
[1:10:17] redundant about repeating that again
[1:10:20] you've chosen now brother brandham has
[1:10:23] uh uh come and and you know Victor Leo
[1:10:26] and the whole story brother brandham
[1:10:28] shares and the whole Prophecy of the
[1:10:30] speaking in tongues and and it's there
[1:10:32] that he's told because you have chosen
[1:10:36] the harder way yeah now I I don't I got
[1:10:39] to say this correctly because we don't
[1:10:41] want the devil to to discourage anyone
[1:10:44] but I'm telling you my brother and
[1:10:45] sister I thank God you chose the harder
[1:10:47] way yeah because you see what happens is
[1:10:51] is the easier way is a compromise yes
[1:10:54] sir the easier way is not the full word
[1:10:57] and and the Lord was encouraging brother
[1:10:59] brandham by these words uh spoken over
[1:11:02] him spoken in tongues and and he tells
[1:11:05] him you know there's going to be a great
[1:11:07] victory in love divine because you have
[1:11:09] chosen this direction these this this
[1:11:13] path you have chosen this harder way and
[1:11:16] I I hope you don't mind me just taking
[1:11:17] this Liberty but you see those words
[1:11:20] were spoken to brother brandom
[1:11:26] first
[1:11:27] fruits have you done your first fruits
[1:11:29] study yeah abolutely first fruits yes
[1:11:32] sir spoken over the prophet amen he's
[1:11:35] talking about you're going to receive a
[1:11:38] tremendous reward yes
[1:11:43] sir amen thank you and the message to
[1:11:46] the bride
[1:11:48] was stay with the word stand on the word
[1:11:52] don't compromise on the word move
[1:11:54] forward in the word trust God yes is
[1:11:58] that the easy way no it's the harder way
[1:12:02] now my brother and sister if God gave a
[1:12:04] prophet an open blessing for choosing
[1:12:07] the harder way that he would reward him
[1:12:09] what's God going to do for you and I
[1:12:11] right amen we're not going to stand here
[1:12:13] and say oh we're we're equal we're this
[1:12:15] or that but that was an outpouring of
[1:12:18] Prophecy that was given to the prophet
[1:12:20] and the prophet preached that word and
[1:12:22] that word is going to have the same
[1:12:24] exact effect upon the bride of Christ
[1:12:26] and she is going to have a tremendous
[1:12:30] blessing in love divine a victory in
[1:12:33] love divine because she has chosen to
[1:12:35] walk the harder way she didn't quit she
[1:12:38] didn't compromise she didn't say oh if
[1:12:40] God would just make this simpler I could
[1:12:42] continue on what he does is gives you
[1:12:45] the strength to stand in the battle and
[1:12:48] then blesses you for standing in the
[1:12:50] battle Hallelujah that's right are we
[1:12:53] doing okay that's right amen I believe
[1:12:55] it is a victory that was spoken you know
[1:13:00] Satan hates truth yes he does man I tell
[1:13:03] you he hates truth so bad he just
[1:13:06] desires to destroy it any way he can
[1:13:08] amen but did you
[1:13:13] know that whatever
[1:13:16] Satan stumbles you with that'll be the
[1:13:18] way I'll put it whatever Satan stumbles
[1:13:21] you with
[1:13:22] today and the prophet of God said when
[1:13:25] when the holy spirit moves upon you and
[1:13:28] you realize you've done
[1:13:29] wrong you repent right then amen don't
[1:13:32] push it down the road just simply and
[1:13:35] now repentance is so easy that we we
[1:13:38] can't hardly accept it exactly so easy
[1:13:43] yeah Lord I'm
[1:13:45] sorry instead we got to go crawl up the
[1:13:49] steps on our knees till they bleed and
[1:13:51] we've got to repeat hundreds of prayers
[1:13:54] and we've got to this and that and cower
[1:13:56] before God but that's not what the word
[1:13:59] showed us not what the prophet taught us
[1:14:01] so as you look at this we realize that
[1:14:03] Satan's still trying to fight Truth by
[1:14:06] inserting a certain element of tradition
[1:14:10] and we know what Jesus said about them
[1:14:11] men following their Traditions amen so
[1:14:15] what we got to do is just come to the
[1:14:17] place that you actually now bear with me
[1:14:20] if this doesn't come out quite right but
[1:14:23] I know it's right how's that for Eric
[1:14:26] I know it's right when Satan's fighting
[1:14:29] the truth in you with
[1:14:33] you just thank the Lord amen not a big
[1:14:38] deep thing that you've got to go into a
[1:14:40] ritual stop and thank the Lord Lord I
[1:14:43] Thank You For Truth I thank you for the
[1:14:46] word I thank you for the life I thank
[1:14:48] you for the way I thank you Lord but
[1:14:51] we've got a ritual I've got to oh I've
[1:14:52] got to do this I got to show God that
[1:14:54] that I'm truly sorry he knows your heart
[1:14:57] he knows what he's placed in you and
[1:15:00] what he placed in you was not defective
[1:15:03] and it was not insufficient trust God
[1:15:06] and say thank you Lord that you have
[1:15:08] given me the way the truth and the life
[1:15:11] right amen and then thank the Lord that
[1:15:14] he chose you to stay in the fight that's
[1:15:16] right
[1:15:17] hallelujah amen I'm telling you my
[1:15:20] brother and sister your witness you see
[1:15:23] I'm fixing to read a quote to you in
[1:15:25] just a minute but you see God only deals
[1:15:28] in Witnesses amen he's not into Theory
[1:15:32] no he's not into
[1:15:35] theology except when he is because when
[1:15:37] you understand what theology actually is
[1:15:40] Anointed with the Holy Ghost we
[1:15:44] study we
[1:15:46] read we
[1:15:49] comprehend but it's got to be anointed
[1:15:51] by the Holy Ghost word says you can't
[1:15:53] even say Jesus is the Christ without the
[1:15:55] Holy Ghost but I'll tell you within the
[1:15:58] last few days or hours many people have
[1:16:01] declared that Jesus is the Christ
[1:16:04] repeating the words by rot is not what
[1:16:06] God's looking for he's looking for a
[1:16:09] people that can say Jesus is the Christ
[1:16:12] with Revelation with understanding with
[1:16:14] anointing with the life that is spoken
[1:16:17] out of that and your you're prophesying
[1:16:20] yourself into your position amen amen
[1:16:23] that's exactly what it but not just just
[1:16:25] words anyone can repeat the words
[1:16:30] right you see God's looking for
[1:16:32] Witnesses of the real experience and you
[1:16:35] don't have to have a man speaking
[1:16:36] tongues over you no how much of the
[1:16:39] world today they're there pounding them
[1:16:42] on the
[1:16:43] back oh just speak in tongues just speak
[1:16:46] in
[1:16:47] tongues that's not what God called us
[1:16:49] that's just speak in tongues just
[1:16:52] believe that's right maybe maybe we need
[1:16:55] an element where we'll pound him on the
[1:16:56] back brother just
[1:17:01] believe but you see The Human Side likes
[1:17:04] this then we can go forth and say I had
[1:17:07] a supernatural event well I'm telling
[1:17:09] you when you can stand in the midst of
[1:17:11] leod DEA and stand on the word not back
[1:17:13] up stay in the fight and say I believe
[1:17:16] that is Supernatural amen we've come so
[1:17:19] common on this oh yeah yeah that's just
[1:17:21] that I'm telling you the devil my
[1:17:23] brother and sister it would ter ify you
[1:17:25] and I if we actually saw what Satan is
[1:17:27] stacked up against you and yet you still
[1:17:30] live amen right exactly right amen and
[1:17:35] the reason you don't need someone
[1:17:36] speaking tongues over you is because
[1:17:38] your eyes and your ears are open amen
[1:17:43] therefore the word says you're blessed
[1:17:46] prise the Lord yeah that's something to
[1:17:47] say Thank You Lord thank you Lord you
[1:17:50] see our Lord
[1:17:53] spoke this is this is the beautiful part
[1:17:55] my brother and sister the Lord spoke and
[1:17:58] we heard amen but not only did we hear
[1:18:01] we acted amen upon what we
[1:18:04] heard too many people can quote the
[1:18:07] message to you exactly forwards
[1:18:10] backwards tell you I met Brothers a good
[1:18:12] men I'm not I'm not saying nothing ill
[1:18:14] against them but I met brothers so smart
[1:18:16] that you start to say something and
[1:18:18] they'll tell you what message it is what
[1:18:20] paragraph it is and what page that
[1:18:22] paragraph is on and I'm just standing
[1:18:25] there going uh-huh uh-huh have no
[1:18:30] idea but you see there's one thing I do
[1:18:32] know
[1:18:34] yeah it's God's blessed me know him to
[1:18:37] know him that's exactly right amen
[1:18:40] that's right now I want to get into this
[1:18:44] quote which will finish up our service
[1:18:48] tonight it's only about seemingly a page
[1:18:51] or two
[1:18:53] long a personal experience with God I
[1:18:56] don't know if any of you have listened
[1:18:57] to that
[1:19:00] recently but it is pretty awesome
[1:19:04] sermon and that's the way it is when we
[1:19:06] go to talk about God let's get somebody
[1:19:09] who's got an experience who knows what
[1:19:11] they're speaking of and these Apostles
[1:19:14] had had the experience of Pentecost they
[1:19:18] were blessed they had Divine Joy now you
[1:19:22] see what separates that a lot of people
[1:19:25] have
[1:19:26] joy but to have a Divine Joy is a joy
[1:19:29] that came from God down in your heart
[1:19:31] not just happy
[1:19:34] person and their hearts were all
[1:19:36] bubbling over the whole world belonged
[1:19:38] to them and isn't it too bad we have
[1:19:42] lost that Joy tonight that Divine joy
[1:19:46] and what they once had and then I think
[1:19:48] of how that the world needs the
[1:19:50] experience that they had at that time
[1:19:53] now we think of
[1:19:55] Moses when Moses in a burning bush this
[1:19:58] sheep
[1:20:00] herder think about
[1:20:06] this divinely protected in
[1:20:09] Egypt floats in the Nile in an area
[1:20:13] clear full of
[1:20:16] crocodiles is fetched out taken into the
[1:20:21] palace
[1:20:25] you see other than what God deposited
[1:20:29] him his
[1:20:31] teaching came out of an Egyptian Palace
[1:20:34] that's right what's our
[1:20:37] excuse
[1:20:46] yeah this sheep H herder one morning
[1:20:48] walking along Old path where he had
[1:20:50] walked many times and there he was
[1:20:52] attracted by a burning bush just just
[1:20:54] like any of us would be come to find out
[1:20:57] the angel of the Lord was in this bush
[1:21:00] and now he speaks to
[1:21:02] Moses Moses had
[1:21:06] been a bitter failure
[1:21:10] amen I'd like to ask those tonight and
[1:21:13] those listening would you look at your
[1:21:16] life as a bitter
[1:21:22] failure it's pretty harsh self judg
[1:21:25] judement to declare my life is a
[1:21:31] failure I know some guys
[1:21:34] today in fact I know some sisters also
[1:21:38] today that would have told you before
[1:21:42] the Lord saved them and Drew them out
[1:21:45] they were a bitter
[1:21:48] failure wonder what the woman at the
[1:21:50] well actually thought about her
[1:21:52] life what did Ray think in the Midnight
[1:21:56] Hour when she was
[1:21:58] alone how did I end up
[1:22:05] here and now speaks to Moses Moses had
[1:22:09] been a bitter failure for yet knowing
[1:22:12] that God was going to deliver the
[1:22:15] children of Israel by
[1:22:17] him and if this hurts just go ahead and
[1:22:21] say ouch out loud if you want to
[1:22:25] yet knowing that God was going to
[1:22:27] deliver the children of Israel by him
[1:22:29] yet trying to do it within himself 40
[1:22:34] years before
[1:22:36] that yes sir you now have a little
[1:22:39] better understanding what Moses carried
[1:22:41] with him when he told God I can't do
[1:22:46] this this you need to find somebody more
[1:22:49] qualified 40 Years of caring the fact I
[1:22:53] killed a man because I thought I was
[1:22:56] going to deliver
[1:22:58] Israel I was the chosen
[1:23:01] man my way is going to work oh my
[1:23:06] brother and sister I think a lot of us
[1:23:08] would have to admit we maybe didn't go
[1:23:10] 40 years but we've been trying to do it
[1:23:12] ourself we've been holding on to our
[1:23:15] ideas of what the message meant and what
[1:23:17] it called us to do and I'll tell you
[1:23:20] what let me just forgive me if this is a
[1:23:22] little harsh but I'll tell you I see the
[1:23:24] evidence of that when I see people
[1:23:27] message Believers going everywhere they
[1:23:29] go judging everyone they come next to as
[1:23:33] though they were God and I'll tell you
[1:23:36] tonight I'm glad they are not God
[1:23:38] because they would have sent me to hell
[1:23:41] when God said you're my
[1:23:43] son amen so here's man in his approach
[1:23:47] say this is what I need to do to further
[1:23:50] the message to cleanse the message to
[1:23:53] purify yeah come on my brother and
[1:23:56] sister God did not call us to be the
[1:23:59] judge he said he would be the judge and
[1:24:02] we'll even show up at the white Throne
[1:24:04] judgment and we will stand there as
[1:24:07] judges but really what the word is
[1:24:09] declaring we'll stand there as witnesses
[1:24:12] to what the judge said it will be that's
[1:24:15] right amen not us saying you in you out
[1:24:19] you done you're finished you're no my
[1:24:21] brother and sister what will we testify
[1:24:24] at the white Throne judgment the word in
[1:24:27] me allowed me to overcome that and you
[1:24:31] had the same opportunity to let the word
[1:24:34] in you to overcome that that will be the
[1:24:37] testimony it won't be oh praise God no
[1:24:42] my brother and sister you see God has
[1:24:45] his plan let's line up with the plan
[1:24:50] hallelujah
[1:24:51] amen amen let's move on here
[1:24:58] had become a failure had lost all the
[1:25:02] vision of
[1:25:04] [Music]
[1:25:08] Victory I've been around the block a
[1:25:10] couple times my brother and sister one
[1:25:11] of the things is slipping into the
[1:25:14] message they're losing the vision amen
[1:25:18] of Victory that's exactly right now
[1:25:20] brother Bram hits it
[1:25:22] here lost all the vision of VI Victory
[1:25:24] and freedom for the people enslaved and
[1:25:26] I just wonder sometimes if we the church
[1:25:29] knowing that God has promised to deliver
[1:25:31] the church from its sin and from his
[1:25:33] sickness and to make us a people a salty
[1:25:36] people he doesn't say here A Perfect
[1:25:38] People my brother and sister he doesn't
[1:25:40] say the shining example a Pharisee of
[1:25:43] the message of the 21st century he says
[1:25:46] a salty
[1:25:48] person thank you Jesus that the Earth
[1:25:51] will hunger and thirst after and I
[1:25:53] wonder in our human efforts in our
[1:25:55] theologies and so forth and our great
[1:25:57] fine buildings so forth that as we tried
[1:26:00] to present to the people many years ago
[1:26:02] we found that it had failed and because
[1:26:04] we took it in ourselves to do so we took
[1:26:07] it upon ourselves to have new schools to
[1:26:11] educate our ministers and so forth we
[1:26:13] left off the real principle the real
[1:26:16] thing that God told us to receive was to
[1:26:18] let the Holy Spirit lead the
[1:26:21] church amen my
[1:26:24] I I actually breathe a sigh of relief I
[1:26:27] do not have to come here and guide this
[1:26:30] little church on my own Merit my own
[1:26:33] intellect my own ability what we got to
[1:26:35] do is come and say Lord I'm here to
[1:26:38] serve you I'm here to let you lead me
[1:26:40] and guide me I'm here to let you give me
[1:26:42] strength and in my time of weakness may
[1:26:44] you be made strong am amen and then
[1:26:47] people will say look the pastor is no
[1:26:50] more spiritual than we are praise God
[1:26:52] he's no more spiritual than you are
[1:26:55] you're the bride of Christ amen but it's
[1:26:58] Christ in us it's Christ in us moving us
[1:27:04] forward was to let the Holy Spirit lead
[1:27:06] the church we've left that off and as
[1:27:09] we've lost left lost our divine
[1:27:12] Joy the
[1:27:14] vision is dull now
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:20] amen some people wouldn't be happy at
[1:27:22] all to hear this preached to them in a
[1:27:23] message Church your
[1:27:25] vision is getting
[1:27:28] dull
[1:27:31] H now those are the prophet's words not
[1:27:35] mine are we good enough to go
[1:27:40] on people are not looking for the coming
[1:27:43] of the Lord and yet atomic bombs hanging
[1:27:46] in the hangers everywhere and the things
[1:27:48] that would destroy the world at once but
[1:27:50] people has lost their vision of the Lord
[1:27:53] because they have set times amen that
[1:27:56] the Lord would come at a certain time
[1:27:58] and they've done these all these things
[1:28:01] trying to do it with in themselves we
[1:28:04] must turn loose and let God do these
[1:28:06] things how can we do those things
[1:28:08] without the Holy Spirit and now Moses
[1:28:11] had been a bitter failure but out there
[1:28:13] now we see his attention attracted to a
[1:28:17] burning bush he looks through the
[1:28:19] burning bush to find out what the
[1:28:21] trouble was and walking close to it fire
[1:28:23] usually brings an attraction usually the
[1:28:26] Holy Spirit when it comes in a manner of
[1:28:28] fire attracts the attention of the
[1:28:30] people and when Moses turned aside to
[1:28:32] consider this Burning Tree that would
[1:28:34] not burn up God spoke to him a fresh
[1:28:37] Vision that's right oh I lift my hand
[1:28:40] tonight I don't know if you would but
[1:28:42] Lord I want a fresh Vision amen come
[1:28:45] Speak to My Heart Lord we have trouble
[1:28:47] here we have trouble there amen I'm not
[1:28:50] speaking of anything in particular but
[1:28:52] kind of particular travel across the
[1:28:54] country we get a preach for a church
[1:28:56] wonderful time in the Lord there's
[1:28:58] trouble in that church that's right amen
[1:29:01] there's trouble here there's trouble
[1:29:03] there there's trouble everywhere my
[1:29:04] brother and sister and if we're not
[1:29:06] careful we become weary and well-doing
[1:29:08] and our vision is there's always trouble
[1:29:11] Lord Deliver Us from the trouble how
[1:29:14] about Lord Deliver us from our vision
[1:29:16] amen
[1:29:17] hallelujah amen things that would
[1:29:20] destroy people lost their Vision because
[1:29:22] they' have set times
[1:29:24] the word would come at a certain
[1:29:26] time I can tell you about a half a dozen
[1:29:30] different times through the years the
[1:29:32] Lord is coming at this
[1:29:34] place on this morning at this time and
[1:29:38] we watch people sell houses businesses
[1:29:42] and and all kinds of things children not
[1:29:45] serving God they just like too bad you
[1:29:48] missed it y well I'll tell you what as
[1:29:52] long as there's breath in this body I'll
[1:29:53] claim my children children
[1:29:54] amen amen there'll be none of this well
[1:29:58] too bad I guess they missed it I'm going
[1:30:00] to fight for them amen amen it's not
[1:30:02] just cuz they're my kin I will fight for
[1:30:04] you and I will fight for your children
[1:30:07] amen your parents whatever it might be
[1:30:09] because you see that's the nature of a
[1:30:11] Believer amen amen
[1:30:15] amen fire usually brings attraction
[1:30:18] usually the Holy Spirit comes in a
[1:30:19] manner of fire attracts the attention of
[1:30:21] the people and when Moses turned aside
[1:30:24] to consider this Burning Tree that would
[1:30:27] not burn up you know the pillar of fire
[1:30:31] on the Bride of Jesus Christ has got the
[1:30:34] same fire amen as it was when it first
[1:30:38] fell amen we don't have to worry about
[1:30:40] it burning out what we got to do is keep
[1:30:43] in it and keep it in US amen it's no
[1:30:46] weaker today in the very midst of Le
[1:30:49] oysa the prophet showed us in the church
[1:30:51] ages the darkest age
[1:30:54] yeah and the fire is still burning amen
[1:30:57] sir and we know nothing great Revelation
[1:31:00] here the darker the night the brighter
[1:31:04] the light
[1:31:05] shines
[1:31:07] hallelujah we're there at brother
[1:31:09] Danny's and he had a brand new fire pit
[1:31:12] we had to test it out he told me I had
[1:31:13] to be part of the test
[1:31:15] drive and you know he's got a house and
[1:31:18] a shed and a fence and you know as that
[1:31:22] fire when it was down inside the fire
[1:31:24] pit there was hardly anything shown on
[1:31:27] the fence and the shed and the house but
[1:31:30] when brother Dany threw a little bit
[1:31:32] more wood in there and got the fire
[1:31:34] coming up out of the fire pit suddenly
[1:31:38] the fence was lit up the wood pile was
[1:31:41] lit up the shed was lit up the house was
[1:31:44] lit up you see we got to get enough fire
[1:31:48] but you know we're afraid of what the
[1:31:51] Joneses might say M about your
[1:31:57] wildfire wildfire is no
[1:32:00] proof but no fire at all is
[1:32:03] proof Lord help
[1:32:05] us Lord help
[1:32:08] us amen now I'm not a naturally just I
[1:32:12] want to clarify this so you don't mind
[1:32:14] here we're not quite late yet got one
[1:32:16] more
[1:32:18] minute I naturally in myself am not a
[1:32:21] guy to there's been times I've stood on
[1:32:23] this plat form and something inside of
[1:32:25] me I just felt like just running down
[1:32:26] the church and running around the
[1:32:28] outside but this
[1:32:30] flash it's like well what were the
[1:32:32] people
[1:32:35] think brother Isaac shut the video off
[1:32:38] brother Paul feels like
[1:32:41] dancing come on my brother and sister we
[1:32:43] are so caught up Amen in our little
[1:32:47] world what would people think of me what
[1:32:50] would people think of us what would they
[1:32:52] think of our church
[1:32:55] what would God
[1:32:57] think that should be the only question
[1:33:00] that we have what will my Lord
[1:33:04] think
[1:33:06] amen okay let me get going along here
[1:33:10] God spoke to him a fresh Vision By An
[1:33:14] Angel now watch Faith take hold right
[1:33:17] quick the old things are passed away but
[1:33:20] Moses now has a new vision he has a
[1:33:23] revelation
[1:33:24] he has an experience he had met God he
[1:33:28] had talked to God before that he had not
[1:33:30] met God he had only read and knowed what
[1:33:32] his mother had told him by hearing what
[1:33:35] his mother has said hearing what the
[1:33:36] pastor has said but now Moses has a
[1:33:39] personal experience and that's what the
[1:33:42] church needs tonight is to just stop
[1:33:45] studying so much
[1:33:48] theology come on my brother and sister
[1:33:50] we've heard it preached we got to study
[1:33:52] this we got to understand this we got to
[1:33:54] be able to explain this the prophet of
[1:33:56] God's countering this right here right
[1:33:58] now I wouldn't say he's doing away with
[1:34:00] it but he is putting context to it he's
[1:34:03] telling us you know what we need to do
[1:34:05] is put away quit stop studying so much
[1:34:08] Theology and get down to the Altar and
[1:34:10] pray until a personal experience burns
[1:34:13] down into the human heart and burns out
[1:34:15] all the dullness and gives a new vision
[1:34:19] I tell you I'm lifting my hand tonight
[1:34:20] Lord I want a new vision I don't want to
[1:34:23] be burdened down by the cares of this
[1:34:25] life and the troubles and the things you
[1:34:27] know how it is you know you you get a
[1:34:29] little older and and suddenly things
[1:34:31] that when you're young you just ignored
[1:34:33] them it'll take care of itself now we're
[1:34:35] going to try and fix
[1:34:37] it and that's a very bad disease for a
[1:34:40] pastor cuz instead of letting the Lord
[1:34:42] have control that's it in the church
[1:34:45] that's right he as a pastor tries to fix
[1:34:48] it that's right and it's strange they
[1:34:50] Boomerang and it gets worse y
[1:34:54] right because it's got the hand of man
[1:34:57] amen on it
[1:35:00] amen
[1:35:02] hallelujah look let me
[1:35:05] just talking about theology we need to
[1:35:08] know what we believe we got no excuse

[1:35:30] these things we believe and put more
[1:35:32] into knowing the author that's right
