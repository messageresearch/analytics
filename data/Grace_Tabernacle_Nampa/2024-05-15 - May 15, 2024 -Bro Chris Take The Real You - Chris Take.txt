Lord thank you we Alex that was wonderful if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to turn over to judges chap 6 man it's good to be in the house of God and always a um always a privilege whether our flesh feels like it or not that's right Spirit within us says yes so we're here amen you can start uh from the first slide there Gideon I want to minister tonight on the real you amen and in Judges chapter 6: 11 we'll read here tonight very familiar passage of scripture we're talking about Gideon but I wanted to key in on something right here to launch from this tonight um verse 11 and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in ofra a fun little study you can do in your devotions is look and see the different trees that God met his people under which o which was in Oprah and that pertained unto joash the azerite and his son gidan threshed Wheat by the wine pressed to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying do not did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites Gideon asked the Lord a question he says basically where is the god where is Jehovah and this is the Lord's response he says go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated tonight so the title like I said is the real you because there's there's you know we talked about twins for a while so there's there's two of you Titus amen so next time someone makes a joke about it say well it's true there's two of me amen I used to get teased like that growing up oh there's two two chrises well there is there were for a while I only knew one then I met Christ and I met the other one amen because I have a theophany you have a theophany you have the spirit of Christ inside of you you have your flesh man fighting your spirit man and the spirit man is the one that God called before the foundation of the world not this flesh this will R in the ground he called you and the real you is not the one who you know gets upset in traffic and and and makes mistakes and shortcomings that's not the real you if if you focus on that person you're going to get confused even more so if you focus on that person and your brother amen you're going to be offended that's right you're going to miss the the thing and and there'll never be Unity as as we think because we're looking for Unity of the flesh that's never going to happen that's right guess what when God comes and the Rapture happens there will not be Unity of the flesh at that point there'll be Unity of the spirit of Christ within us because we all come into Unity with Christ am this quote here Gideon never mind I got it right here says in the Mighty God unveiled before us whenever there's a title like that in the in the sermons because brother B's preached it a different couple different times I mean just go back every once in a while and listen to it because it's just mindblowing but he says that the old Badger skins what did it do it hid the glory of God from the people right the badger skins the reason the people couldn't see it because it was a skin that held it the glory of God was behind the skin and now the glory of God is behind your skin that's right and the Traditions don't see it it's inside the veil where his word was so brother is talking about the shakina glory of God is behind your skin amen wrap your little human brain around that one the shakina glory of God that presence that only the priests could come into contact with and and I was just reading in in uh numbers I'm reading through numbers right now and and there's all those Dayan and cor rose up said well we can we can basically take the office of the Levites or we don't need Moses and um they go to burn the incense and then God opens the Earth and swallows them all up right because they were trying to take that position but that presence that demanded the Levites and the priests and that presence that cast that judgment on those the whole families is a presence that lives it behind your skin first of all well that's the real you that's right that's the real you that's who you really are that's right and and once you've come to the place where where you you you've you've crossed and you your justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm talking to you amen because if if we if we fail that's is why brother B says the cross is important because if we fail to keep that preached people will go around a mess thinking they have the shanic glory behind their skins but there's a process to get there amen but those of you have gone that way gone that path and the devil says look at who look at the mess you are and I'm not talking about Sin and and habits that are just terrible I'm I'm talking about the little the silly ridiculous things that we do because we just have too much pride and and we can't keep our mouth shut and and you get the end of the day and you look back at what you did and you say oh my goodness the devil says comes along and he whispers he says see you're just a badger but you see in order for the Badger's skin to be there the badger had to give his life away that's right in order for our skin to be the sh to be the skin that covers sh of Glory we had to give ourselves away we had to lay ourselves out to be skinned skinned alive amen I mean it's it's a it's a process that that takes you giving up your identity your skin think about your skin right it it what forms you over your features and your bones and it gives you the look that you have it's that it's that thing that holds it all together but God said I need it that's right so give it away give your life away so the answer to Gideon's question the reason we read the scripture is because the answer to Gideon's question Where's God is the Lord's response is have not I sent thee in other words you're looking for God and he's right there exactly right he's behind your skin this is God talking to Gideon saying I've sent you you want to know where God is I sent you amen tonight you know what you just can't explain the word of God so tonight I I need you to just it well you should do this every time say Lord help me to catch what you're saying tonight because there's only so much you can say and God has to reveal it to your heart but the answer to where go where is God today where where is God today what's the answer have not I sent thee that's right where is God where where's the Prophet The Prophet died what's going to happen where then God said no I'm in you I'm in the bride amen the bride coming of Christ amen so you are Christ where where is God people say well God's not real or where is God and they're looking upstair up upstairs up to the universe above them and they're looking around them saying well where is God and all the while we're rubbing shoulders with them and it's shakina of Glory behind your skin amen you that's the real you that's right you think about the shakina glory of God hidden behind the skin of the Bride go back in in your in in the Old Testament and read about the power of that shika Glory why do we fall short because we give into the flesh that's right that's the only reason but that's not the real you that's right and if you can remember well that's not really who I am something in your thinking because God understands he created us he created our brain and our emotions and what we how we think and process things and so he gives us the scriptures into our own language not English human right he condens sended God who created the heavens and the Earth and and and and you talk about the smartest person in the world can't even hold a twinkle much less a candle to God's intellect but he brought it down so you could have digest it as a human and so when he says this is the real you it's something that triggers in your brain if you can believe it what is that fath Faith which is revelation amen because you're recognizing what did brother said if the bride could realize who she is she will be an invincible Army Amen in order for us to come to the position where we're ready for rapture we have to be an invincible Army so what are we doing we're chipping away at the things that beset us run the race and and and there's a cloud of many witnesses lay aside those things that so easily beset us what is Paul talking about he's talking about the pride of life and and vanity and bitterness and jealousy and these things that we hold on to and that's what he's talking about and Lord help me I have so far to go so inside this place you have the show bread and this is just a couple of scriptures just to set us into context here that we set the showbread up there before me y this is God speaking and then there was the Brethren sons of the coites were over the showbread to prepare it every Sabbath Sabbath so this this bread was was was always fresh Generations went by Century centuries went by yet this bread was always fresh there because it was constantly baked again you know David David and his men ate the showbread right the priest said well I have this bread here and so the word it's the word brother and says the show is Christ amen and and the word you talk about freshly baked bread the word is fresh every day amen but says the hidden Mana is to show bread it's Christ it's the bread that that's there and it's it's it's always the thing that I found fascinating about this is It's always current amen it's never outdated so you talk about fresh right these are all of the a the uh acronyms of the word fresh not stale crisp un I don't know why that's supposed to be untainted I think unfaded natural unprocessed unpreserved without preservatives guess those are the same thing clean clear pristine Untouched by the world original unconventional radical revolutionary restored these are all in the thesaurus for the word fresh this is Christ this is the word of God it's invigorated it's vibrant it's revived it's refreshing it's pure it's unpolluted uncontaminated tainted it's brisk this is the word of God Amen not your Bible that's right I was in the office praying it's like oh God we we sit with our coffee in the morning and our in our Bible and then we just miss you because we're reading a page that's right but God this is your Living Word this is God this is this is fresh this is crisp it's not processed there's no additives there's no preservatives it doesn't need preservatives it is life in itself amen it needs nothing to contain itself it is that's right it is the container amen it is there's nothing that can touch it and nobody can can excuse it no Generations can can forget about it they're going to argue about it and discuss it they can't forget it amen because it is the indelible foundation of the world because God spoke the world into existence the very Earth you walk on is the word of God the very body you walk in that that houses the kind of Glory of God is the spoken word of God because he created you amen when you walk outside and you see the trees you looking at the manifestation of the spoken word of God when you look at yourself in the mirror the mirror of the word of God not the glass mirror on your wall the mirror of the word of God you should see the real you not the mistakes that you have but the real you and as soon as you come into contact with that and you realize that the shakina glory of God is housed in this Badger skin you don't become arrogant you'll fall to your knees and say God are you serious you chose me to hold your sacred glory to be you to the world around you and he says absolutely I wouldn't have it any other way that's right before the foundation of the world he said this is the best way to display my word why because he wanted you amen he wanted you by his side for eternity and the only way to do that is to get to the place where you could be the shikina glory of God housed in human flesh that's right the real you identified Christ of all the ages he says in the Old Testament there was Badger skins that hid God he was in the shikina glory they was behind the badger skins before they become behind the badger skin the word was in most Now watch how the word comes because brother B says the word comes to the prophet first that's right and he says that's where you know if there's if there's word to be revealed that's it to a generation to an age it must come to the prophet amen once it's come to the prophet now you have access to it that's it and that's simply because that's the way God said it should be that's right don't try to figure out why that's right that's just the way God said it to be and there's there's a lot of different angles you can come to it so you can glean more more about the topic but don't pull your brains out trying to figure out why that's just what God Said So the word was in Moses so now God has this desire and I I I catch the parallel here God has this desire to bring the word to the children of Israel they're a mess they're in bondage you know 400 something years or whatever it was and around that time frame and and he'd spoken to Abraham and and and they they reference they referen the god of Abraham so they they need access to God firsthand there's a word that has to be brought to them and and in order to bring them out right so God God brings them out of Egypt but to in order to sustain you so God brings you out of the world but to sustain you you must be filled you must be filled with the glory of God so the word was in Moses the prophet he went up on the mountain he met the pillar of fire and it was spoke to him you catching the parallel he went down and performed the signs of the Prophet brought children of Israel out of Egypt to this mountain and then God came down and identified Moses by bringing him into that Pillar of Fire excuse me and veiling him no one else could go not any person to try to impersonate that they could not do it they died amen taking one man he went in behind there to the pillar of fire into the glory of God and into the shikan of glory and it was that position that Moses took that God was able to bring the word to the children of Israel okay and when he came out with that word for that age he was so shining with the glory of God till he had to Veil his face the people couldn't steadfast look upon him and that was the natural Veil natural always types the spiritual so it's the same thing today there's this when you are changed and God puts his spirit inside of you there's a veil that's right because the world can't look upon it that is why brother R says it's a secret amen why is it a secret because of it because of what he is that's right that's why it's a secret because of what he is he himself displayed through you has to be veiled amen the world's too dirty to contain it but you you with the flesh veiling the spirit of Christ inside of you then now you can walk Amen in the world that's right because God always hides himself in Simplicity that's right what is it when a man breaks through that Veil into the shikan glory now the world calls him a fanatic they can't see what's wrong but behind there there's no beauty of him he might not pronounce his words right he might not not dress just right he might not dress in clergy clothes she might not dress the way she think she ought to he's not talking about modesty he's just talking about you know well they didn't you know have I don't know brands of skirts whatever it may it may be but you see inside behind that Badger skin behind that human skin and there is the shikina glory and there is the power and there is the word in there is the showbread and the shik glory which is the light that makes light that ripens grain amen you Kansas people know that by your weat crops without that sun it won't light and until you come in behind that Badger skin until you get out of your old skin your old thoughts your old Creeds and come into the presence of God then the word becomes a living reality to you so you say Lord Make It Lord make your word more real to me and he's looking at you saying have not I sent thee that's it oh God I want to know you more personally and he's looking at himself in you saying if you would just realize who the real you is you would be closer than you've ever been before CU you're living in the presence he says eating the showbread that's only provided let me back up then you're awakened to the shikina glory the spirit man was asleep but then something came and woke you up the real you then the ible becomes a new book then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you're living in his presence eating the showbread that's only provided that day for believers priests only and we are priests royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people giving spiritual sacrifices to God he says but you must come into behind the veil to see the unveiled God and God is unveiled that's his word made manifest so okay there's there's a lot in that quote because he says he says the shakina glory is a the word becomes a living reality to you when you put aside your flesh your skin and you step into the word of God in other words you are giving up your own self for him to take the place of you amen and when you're in that position now he says you're eating the showbread that's only provided for the Believers he says but you must come into behind the veil to see the unveiled God so if you want to see the glory of God unveiled in your life you have to come into contact with the real you amen amen that's right in other words where is Christ Christ The Mystery of God revealed is sitting right here because it's oh my goodness see you just feel like you can't say it enough see it's it's you it's inside of you it's right there it's not something you need to go find you just need to look into the mirror of the word of God and say oh I see you Lord and he says yes amen I'm right here and he's unveiled where is he unveiled he's not unveiled in a in in the building of the church he's not unveiled in in in the actual message book He's not unveiled in the actual Bible he's unveiled because you see him in you amen you see the real you which isn't built and shaped in the image of God Amen we pray to the God within us we don't reach to pray for God beyond the stars because if you do that you're praying to the wrong thing right you're not pray you're praying to lowercase G God but when you say Lord and you and you're praying to the god that's within you the spirit of Christ that has risen up inside of you and changed you and made you a Dwelling Place of the shikina glory of God you need not go anywhere to access God right there with you the only reason you don't feel god with you is because you walked out of the gate and you walked as flesh that's it and God says if you'll walk back into the gate that's right back into the sanctuary you'll find me again and it's not you and your feet walking down walking across time it it's you coming to a place where you but the only way to see that Christ inside of you is in the mirror of the word say I want to see you God and he's waiting for you right here amen behind the veil amen and when he unveils himself that's why when you that's why Revelation changes who you are that's right because you you stop acting like somebody you aren't that's it because you see Christ so then you see Christ it's like it's like somebody who who didn't realize I don't know this is just going to be farfetched didn't realize they had arms they heard about arms and man arms and hands would be amazing and all along they're walking along everyone's looking at them saying you've got arms and hands and they're saying no I don't I wish I hadn't but I don't and then they see thems in the mirror and they realize they have arms and hands guess what that's going to permanently change their personality that's right because now they have arms and hands now they're going to do the things they always wanted to do because they have arms and hands I know that's goofy but it it's what it is you realize who you are now you stopped acting like you stop acting like Saul and you act like Paul you stop acting like Cain and you act like Abel you stop acting like Esau and you act like Jacob Israel you because you realize you're you realize you you are an heir to the son of the free woman amen not an heir to the bonds woman that's right imagine somebody who you know who who didn't know they had been liberated they were a slave for years they lived their life as slaves their identity was a slave and then they were free but they hadn't heard yet they continued to live like a slave but they were free you're free but you're continuing to live like a slave and then the message comes what are you doing you're free y amen you're not a slave anymore you haven't been for two weeks immediately that person changes their Dwelling Place immediately that person changes their identity they no longer belong to this master of the world they belong to the G to Christ I am a son of the king that's it that's right something changes amen something changes in you and what is that that is a revelation of the real you you which isn't some kind of Buddhist theology it's the revelation of Christ because Christ is veiled in your skin amen the shakana glory of God the same Glory that made Aaron's Rod butt into a tree lives inside of you so you can create worlds and live on them you say well yeah but faith and we're held back no the world around you you want a family to be a certain way you want a family create that world speak that world into existence you have the very ability to create that you want your family to be different speak amen speak the word of God how do you speak the word of God oh Lord I just thank you for who you are I thank you for your mercies I Praise You Lord I lift up my brother you're speaking the words of God and you're coming into contact with what a God out there know the god inside of you you've stepped down into a place that's why when you pray you have to pray yourself through the gate into the holy Place into the holiest of holies that's called breaking through and you have to drag yourself along I remember I gave the example you got to drag those emotions along with you they're going to be you know playing golf and doing other things but you drag them along or out fishing or hunting or fixing your bow or fixing your dirt bike those itions but you have to drag them through and as you come through and you pull through the sanctuary and the holy place and the holiest of holies your entire being becomes in tune and suddenly you you're praying and words are coming forth and you're in you're in what you're in the presence of God because you have stepped inward amen right that it's very popular in the world secularly SEC secular whatever you understand it's very popular people to go off and and and go into these uh they call it a um I can't remember what it is but basically you go into this dark room you can't hear anything see anything and you find yourself and you tap into who you are and people come out say wow you know it's amazing it's amazing I didn't know why I was so awesome well that's the natural and brother says says that I just read the quote today natural always types the spiritual because the devil can't create he perverts so if it's something out there and you say well there's got to be the right thing here in the word of God so you need to you need to find the real you go find yourself do it yes sir go find yourself you you meet you know friends at work say yeah I'm I'm finding myself they'll give you all kinds of advice and you don't want to take it but you're doing the same thing you say oh yes I'm on a journey to find myself too and that's what happened to Enoch he was on a journey to find himself and then he saw himself and he disappeared amen you're going to come face to face with yourself brother said that seventh angel looked familiar yes sir if he can come face to face with himself we can too and it was that face to face what that revealed Christ in our age you see he as the prophet had to come to that position because the word has to come to the prophet first so he had to come to that position so that we could have the word to bring us to the same place to see ourselves face to face the real you amen and God is unveiled that's his word made manifest that's what's going to make you shout act emotional the word of God coming alive to you you don't need no assistance the word just manifest itself inside of you sorry I don't know what's going on manifest itself inside of you and suddenly you cannot contain yourself anymore cuz yourself yourself is not yourself it's himself amen he says I I said see I sound like a fanatic praise God no he was Jehovah people tried to push him around saying he's just a good man ordinary man he was the Divine one God manifested In the Flesh seen now I want this quote here is to show you where how brother B talks about how God Jesus was all God yet he was all man that's right because you are in the same exact position yes sir you are all man but you are all God that's exactly right because the real you is the god inside of you okay so Jesus walked in flesh to know what it's like to be all God in stuck in flesh amen so that he could have mercy and understand your position that's right he says he says he was the Divine one God manifested In the Flesh see even the world gets confused because they saw man the Pharisees and the Sadducees saw a man it he was veiled veiled in flesh and the same thing has to happen today as in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man in other words it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so you're going to experience exactly this he says manifested in the flesh seen of angels preached on received up into the heaven see you can get really confused sometimes because you see the Flesh and the mess that it is but then you see God and the the spirit of Christ inside of you and God's saying look don't worry about it it's the two it's the two just keep the one in check sitting at the right hand of the father certainly he was God he was more than a man he was a God man he was man in flesh but he was God in spirit that's what he was God coming down to suffer Temptation and martyrdom to take sins upon himself that he'd pass on the human race bearing our sins himself okay further down because he he's talking about a conversation he had with with with a lady and further down he answers and he sayses because she says 'w Jesus wept so he was a man and he sayses I said he might have cried that's true on his road down to meet Lazarus he was human as far as human is concerned in his flesh he was human but is but his spirit in his Spirit he was God that's right praise the Lord s that's the same you were in the same position that is you right there there you are that is the real you the spirit who you are is the spirit of Christ inside of you veiled the sh Glory the real you he said I I cried that was a man crying he was man when he was crying going down to lazarus's grave but when he stood there and straightened that little frame up and said Lazarus come forth and the man that been dead four days come to life again that was more than a man the doctor gave you the bad news and you wept but then something came over you that's right what was that that was the real you the real you straightened up the flesh amen that was getting weak that's why in your weakness you're perfected because in your weakness then God comes in his strength and it's Paul says when I am weak then I am strong I am strong why because it's Christ in you it's the real you amen that's right that was God speaking through there Hallelujah God was in his son that was God speaking through mortal flesh corruption knew its master I love that line corruption knew its Master that's right you speak to the situation the flesh you look look your flesh which is corruption it knows who's the boss amen it knows who's the boss you just have to know that's who the boss is that's it he was man when he was up there on that mountain that night come down and looked all around that little fig tree there and there wasn't nothing to eat he was hungry he was a man when he was hungry but when he took five biscuits and two fishes and fed 5,000 people that was more than a man that God in the man Hallelujah he's talking about Jesus but he's talking about you that's right he was a man when he laid on the back of that little boat that night when 10,000 Devils of the sea swore they would drown him the little old Storm come up and a little boat pitching like a bottle stopper out there on that Lake like that devil said we'll drown him him tonight he was so tired virtue had gone out of him all day from preaching and healing till he was so tired the storm didn't wake him up but when the disciples woke him he's always activated by a call for help amen he's always activated when you ask him amen he's always there he's a gentleman and he's always there why is he always there because he's walking around inside of you he was a man laying there sleeping when he put his foot upon the rib of the boat said peace be still there that was more than a man that was God speaking through his son amen he was a man when he cried up there on Calvary my God why hast Thou forsaken me he died like a man you died like a man you gave up your life for his spiritually speaking you died you gave up who you are as as a as a man and pride and all of this stuff that you have and you gave it all up and you said Lord whatever you want me to do I am yours to do it whatever I no longer am the boss I am not in charge you did the same thing and then on your Resurrection morning he rose and brother B says you Rose with him amen amen we heard a beautiful sermon by our brother David around that you Rose with him he says I was there when Paul revered right I was there when Washington crossed Delaware and he says I was there what he's identifying I am I am an American so I was there he says now as a Christian as a Son of God I was there when he went to the cross and I was there when he rose again amen why were you there how could you be there how how could you be there there's only one way you could be there you were the seed of God inside of him amen that's right and you had a space of time to be expressed into that's exactly right and the same thing can be said for you God in amen he says he rose breaking the seals of death corruption rising to ascend to the father above showing that he was more than a man he was God in flesh that's it the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now why would the prophets say that why would he say that he said so much that only by Revelation you can catch between the lines that's it he's connecting it back to you amen say that's God then then where is God right now today he's right here UN in unveiled In the Flesh of the bride and when you can believe that when you can recognize that that's the real you you will no longer go around saying I am the son of flint and hanit take that's it because it's the real you that's it right I I if you were if you were an orphan and you didn't know you were an orphan and and and you had been a you know lost lost on the on a you know Wagon Train out west let's say and you you just got lost and Indians picked you up and you grew up with the Indians and all you knew was Indians and you thought you were an Indian and then somebody came along one day and told you says look you're not an Indian you're the son of the owner of of of all of the metal work on the west coast you're a billionaire I mean we're I think we're out of times here but whatever guess what you're going to stop acting like an Indian because now you know who you really are see they're goofy but the foolishness of preaching goofy examples but it's the same thing you were going along that's why you were sinning cuz you didn't know who you really were that's right that's why people struggle even sitting in church cuz they don't know who they really are exactly right you're you're free but you're still working the feel of the devil that's right even though you're free say well excuse me I thought I was free I know I went and my goodness the spirit of the Lord came down yes you are you just need to now deny that it's got to be a shift into your in even in your mind cuz it goes from your mind down to your soul that's it it got to be a shift in the greatest battle ever fought the Army up there has to realize we're not defeated right you know it's like the soldiers that are hiding in the trench thinking they're being shot at but the enemy's already been already ran off then finally somebody takes the courage to peek their head over the bunker they're fine but when you cower down to the devil cuz you you think you're still bound but you're free the Devil Himself is like my goodness I didn't think this guy was bright no there's a time it's like the Johnny Crow right but then tells the story he you're free you're free go ahead fly away but he was so long chained he couldn't accept it why it has to be Revelation your deliverance has to be Revelation to you personally and that's what keeps the devil at Bay is the Revelation that you get that you are no longer a child of the Bond woman amen that you're a child of the free he was all God yet he was man in Luke 17: 29 and 30 it says but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now in our day and age that we live in the son of man was revealed Christ was revealed to us and so we read this scripture and we say yes destruction and destroying and brimstone and everything coming down to the world around us but what was happening to the believer in this space of time amen always look to the positive amen always look to the positive there's a positive and there's a negative because God's going to hide himself in his word that's it during this space of the time Abraham was on the backs side of the desert and you can argue about the timelines but it was the same season lot's down there Abraham's out there and it was in that space of time where the Lord comes down robed in flesh and speaks to Abraham and through the spoken word the promises brought to pass amen he'd said it before but then God came in flesh that's right and stood there in front of Abraham and said Sarah shall conceive amen it was the spoken word planted the seed in the womb in Sarah's womb amen that was the promised son okay so the world we live in Christ has come down in flesh you and I but we're in this season and O in the days of lot this is where we are amen and guess what the spoken word is planting and bringing forth the promised son in your life exactly right that's the third pole that's it that's exactly it's that simple amen that's right they say the spoken word I got to like stand up and and and speak well yeah actually but you speak the word of God you you feed the word of God you you listen to the word of God you if if you let me put it this way and maybe this is a bit Blasphemous forgive me if it is but if you are if the shakina glory of God is behind your skin and you talk about the things of God you are God speaking you are this you are the spoken word you're life itself is the spoken word people say well I don't know why this happened well you kept saying it you kept saying it you speak it that's why you got to speak the positive create the atmosphere yeah why because you have the power because the real you because of because of the real you you have the power amen you have the power that's why when we speak the words Lord we bind every hindering Spirit In The Name of Jesus Christ do you know that that has to have an effect if a child of God says those word it has to have an effect the devil does not have a choice that's it you got issues in your home speak those words that's exactly you're going to meet with somebody and it's you know whatever it might be you just say God bind the spirit in the name of Jesus Christ those aren't just words we say that sound like we're spiritual and you know we're not like you know those people out there that are caught up in in all that stuff you know like Pentecostals and all that crazy stuff I you know I remember when Co was happening and what's that TV evangelist tried to bind the demon and all this weird stuff he has no author Authority the seven son of of CA said well this is pretty cool we're going to go try it out and they almost lost their lives because they had no Authority but if you know God and God knows you you have the authority because if God knows you and you know God the devil knows who you are you see before you even realize who the real you is the devil already knows that's why brother man say that the weakest Christian gets on his knees all hell trembles because they know you they know the real you amen and all the devil can do is is whisper lies to you to try to cons convince you otherwise that's exactly right and as long as he can convince you otherwise only for a season because a child of God will find Victory then he's got you I heard it said one time if the devil was going to kill you he wouldn't tell you about it he would just do it you see but he wants to whisper these things to you all Laden with fear and nothing nothing about faith there in Matthew 3:1 13-17 this is this is where Jesus comes and he is just gonna move this he is gonna be baptized by John says then cometh Jesus from galile to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him see the word came to the prophet that's it that's why John had to baptized Jesus because the sacrifice had to be cleansed and the word had to come to the prophet so so God Christ comes to John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me and the focus went from John the Baptist to Jesus you see the focus went from the prophet to Christ in our in our in our age that we the day that we live in and that and that's where where people get confused right because they they forget to move on that's it that's it but says God turns Corners that's it and he says that's where people always fall off the wall that's right and Jesus but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me and Jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness for the BR went through the same thing he says well you know maybe I'll just go into the woods and and live my life out there what was he saying he was saying I can't do this I can't baptize you but God came and showed him what's going to happen to him and and then showed him the hills what it was God encouraging the man to fulfill what God had called him to fulfill but he went through the same process but Jesus says look the word has to come to the prophet first you have to do this John Jesus answering said to him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon on him and L a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell says the same thing so he says here he says this is in in reference to the scripture he was man in one sense he was God in another sense he was man in flesh in spirit he was God we just went through that so did we the Dove came on the lamb so the dove like the spirit of God descended like a dove onto Jesus who was the lamb L the sacrifice and they to became one the lamb was one creature the dove was another creature and when the Dove and the man the Dove and the lamb United together God was manifested in flesh amen that's right and now are you ready for this hold on to your seats now he's manifested in your flesh by being adopted Sons and Daughters to the kingdom of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit when you were baptized then the Dove came down his Spirit came down and the two became one amen baptism of the Holy Spirit that's right and you become joint HS with the Lord Jesus Christ oh Church you got the power if you got the faith to use it that's it you see that's where we lack it we lack the faith what is Faith it's Revelation why do we lack Revelation because we don't feed on the word enough that's it or we don't put the emphasis enough on Christ that's right we're too busy trying to be Christians that's right rather than just serving God and getting to know God we're too busy trying to fulfill some kind of creed and fulfill some kind of thing that we think we have to do it and and we're completely missing God Lord help us right I mean help me I'm not perfect at all you see you see but we have the power we just don't have the faith to use it amen so if there's something lacking in your life you know what the problem is you don't have the faith to use the power that's it you don't need power that's it oh give us the power of God I want access to the power I need more power of Christ in my life no you don't you have all the power of Christ in your life you say God give me the faith to use iten you see there's there's you know Believers and miracles have happened in their life because they have the faith to use it you are that's right now all things must be done according to God's will of course but you lack we lack oh ye of little faith that's right that's what he says he didn't say oh you of little power he said oh you of little faith have not I been so long with you that's it you see Saints how not the Lord been so long in your life hidden behind your skin and you still lack the faith to use the power he's standing there saying you have all of it that's right if you just have the faith to use it and he's saying he said so then he shows you again how it's done sir he stood on the boat he oh ye have little faith have I been so long with you but he still stood on the and spoke to the storm why because he was showing them how to use it he was giving them Revelation amen cuz they saw the word in action that's it you see the word read when you read the word of God it comes into your soul and then you believe it it goes into action how's that how's that go Faith puts into action or something like that there's a quote maybe Brother David knows I can't remember but brother bam says fa I think he says faith puts the word into action so love came to the lamb oh Church you got the power if you got the faith to use it amen that's what we need Lord give us more faith today so where is is Christ today well I think we all know the answer to that question by now I would hope so Christ is in you the real you that's right the real you I you know it's hard to believe it and that's the point if it wasn't hard if it wasn't hard there be no character formed that's it it has to be hard it has to be hard to believe it it has to be hard to to have the faith to access the power of God because there would be no character so he puts you through the ringer so that you realize he puts you in a position whether whether by trial he puts you in a position by trial that's how he does it and then now you have no you have no other way but to have the faith he almost pushes you into a corner right job was shoved into a corner and what happened Christ came forth that's why the the Lord said go ahead to the devil go ahead and test job because I know what will happen how did God have that Faith because he knew what was in job that's it because he knew Job you know when the sons of God came together job was there too the real job was there amen job just didn't realize the real him was there but he was was here at the same time you're there but you're here at the same time but that's the real you this is the ne well brother this is the negative in the film yeah I'm my goodness I don't know I was still pretty young when digital cameras came out but I remember film Titus do you remember film cameras yeah cool okay guess if you have parents who are just stuck in the old ways and no matter how old you are you'll have film but you look at it it's the worst thing you ever saw in your life you know you hold up to the light it's terrible like my goodness and then you develop it and it's a beautiful picture and that there is you is your flesh now that's exactly right and then because that's not the real you that's it Lord help us to catch that that's why he says if you catch that I'm going to read between the lines for you right now if you can come into contact with the real you you will be an invincible Army amen that's what brother man saying that's what he say he says okay so as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there'll have to be a sheath waved again in the last days waving of the sheath what was the sheath the first one that come to to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheep in other words he was our example do you want me to switch to a handheld mic here let me switch first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheath so he was our example what what was he an example of of who we really are the real you the real you is that sheath that wave offering cuz he was the first one to come to maturity so that wave over you this this is what you need to look like this is what it really looks like you see God brought forth the word revealed Christ to you so you could see that's what I really need to look like that's the real me you saw that open up to you it had to be waved so that you knew what to become that's it Christ had to be revealed every part of Christ had to be revealed in the world in the age we living today because we need to be exactly like the first amen he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and we are the bride of Christ waving of the sheath what was the sheath okay the first one to come to maturity Hallelujah I'm sure you see I'm sure you see what I'm talking about do you see what he's talking about tonight do you catch it are you catching it the only way you can catch it is by faith it was waved over the people and the first time that will come forth for the bride age where we are today for the bride age for your Resurrection out of dark denominationalism he doesn't say denominations he says denominationalism because that's the same thing we're dealing with today that's why the message church is the mess is because it's denominationalism oh The Message Church the message will never denominate no it won't but there'll be denominationalism in the message and the only way for you to oppose that is to look to the chath look to the wave offering and says that's the real thing that's the real me that's what I need to be he says he says will be a message amen the message is the way she that's it that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power see we're not lacking power we're lacking the faith to use the power and waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there amen because I live ye live also speaking to his wife praise the Lord because I live ye live also what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is you see I was I was out running today and I was listening to a tape and I realized where the emotion lies the emotion lies you know because he says you know you got to have the emotion and I realize the emotion when it's sprung from the word like this that comes forth and you just can't hold on to yourself it's not the music provoking it it's the word of God provoking it that's the emotion we need to have he stand up here she shouting and spitting like I am right now the world says wow that guy's a fanatic why because the word of God within me is quickening something because I know this I heard this one time before the world was ever formed before there was ever a star in the sky I heard these words and now the deep is responding why because the real me was there not this guy that you see not this guy that you see but the real me was there that's right praise the Lord saints of God if if we could just catch a revelation of that we would stop fighting with one another that's right we would stop being so disagreeable we would stop being depressed we would stop getting mad at the person in front of us in the road I say that all the time because that's my problem guys mad the person behind us who's riding our tail we wouldn't even care that's it you know a true Son of God of God Son of Son of God cannot be provoked that's right I believe that yes sir and you say well I've been provoked I'm not a real Son of God no no no no no no the real you the real you can't be provoked all you have to do is say God increase my faith my Revelation so that more often than not the real me talks amen more often than not I act like the real me that's right you know when kids are growing up and they're transitioning from one phase in their life to the next every once in a while they we we call it regress they go back and they act like a baby he say hey that's not who you are you have to remind them as their parent you say look son you're not a baby anymore speak strong act like a man because that's what you are amen that's why Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things why it's time to transition it's time to step forward in maturity and say you know what I am not that anymore I am the Son of God Amen a excuse me a son of God M be Son of God actually go ahead you can say it it's not blasphemy because it's Christ in you it's Christ in you oh my goodness can we even catch a hold of that The God Who came down and created flesh to walk in as mzc The God Who came down and spoke to Abraham and says why did Sarah laugh behind the in the tent behind him the same God who who who went to the grave and and took your sins and rose again and and the same God who performed the Miracles and and and the prophet and the word that came forth and The Sword and the Hand this isn't just stories this is this is the reality this is the real you that's right you you know what can I say this you were there when he held the sword in his hand why were you there because you were a you're a brandom no no because it's God you're part of Christ so you stood there when the sword came down that you were right there you were a part of that because that's the real you he said well I wasn't born yet it doesn't matter you were always you always were amen amen oh God help us what a rection that and what a res Resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to may be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you know Saints this was the this was one of the the scriptures that he brother B uses as his campaign slogan and the more I learn about God the more revelation God gives me of his word I always come back to this scripture exactly right it wasn't just he didn't just use it to use it no there was an inspiration this is the model for the bright age amen when when you get to know more of Christ and God reveals the things in the scriptures to you and things in the message together to you all of a sudden the light bulb comes on and you think my goodness that's amazing you'll come back to this scripture that's right because you realize oh it's Christ that's it it's Christ where was Samson's Victory we've heard Samson mentioned a few times in the past few Services where was his victory he said well he was in the in the house in the grinding away and and the hair came back that was not his victory no that's right his victory was when he came into contact with himself Amen in that grinding house he realized who he really was amen he realized who he really was and the reason he was acting like that before is because he didn't know the Real hymn that's it that was his victory when he recognized the Real hymn and you know what happened he killed more in his death he was more successful in his death than in his entire life so let me ask you this are the footsteps of the righteous order of the Lord says why my goodness Samson made a giant mess did he if he didn't do what he did with Delilah he wouldn't have killed that many Philistines you see what I mean when I say when you realize the real you that's it he says well I did all this I made this mistake I I I I just I I I made this mistake that I cannot change in my life Samson couldn't either he didn't have any eyes that's right but he realized who he was he had to be there he had to come to that position the more I the more I feed on this saints of God the more I realize God his a a true son and daughter of God can do and make terrible mistakes yes sir but God's will is not lost that's he he he it's not that he uses those like oh it happened I I can use that he uses those that's it but remember says God gave us free moral agency so that the Adam and Eve would fall in the garden that's it see well God caus it to happen well kind of but they still had the choice that's if you can catch a revelation of that your past will stop haunting you that's it exactly if you can realize all of that that you did the mistakes that you made was God's hand that's that's exactly right Saints you will see the real you yes sir Gideon where was Gideon's Victory when he came into contact with himself that's it God said have not I sent thee and Gideon went away thinking why did he say that why did he say how why didn't he tell me where where the Miracles were why did he say have not I sent thee and then and then he went along and he went along and he went along and we say oh Gideon was weak that's why God set him down no no no no no he was right in the hand of God cuz the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord we either have to believe that or we don't it can't be applied to certain situations it's either all the time or it's not so Gideon goes down to the tent and what does he hear he hears about the bread of life and he says oh that's who I am you think oh you know Gideon just got the courage because he heard he was going to win no kide Gideon got the C courage because he realized who he was he says I'm the deliverer I'm the one that I'm the god that's why God said have not I sent thee he's right here that's what Gideon tried to do when he handed his son The Sword and said slay him slay the enemy you have the power to do it and his son couldn't do it and it came back to haunt him you see God takes us through things and then we we stand here you stand there with your brother saying slay it take the sword slay it why because Gideon knew who he was amen that's why Gideon grabbed the sword and took care of business amen so now where do you find your Victory that's it where do you find your Victory when you come into contact with himself that's it right there it is see that's terrible English brother Chris but it makes the point that's when you come into contact with the real you who's the real you it's Christ Christ in you the hope of glory the hope of glory the shakina glory of God that's the real you realization of who you are is your greatest Victory the real youen that's right Hallelujah not the son of your flesh parents not the daughter of your flesh parents the Son of God child of the king amen that's the real you amen and the only reason the fake you gets in the way it's because you stopped remembering the real you that's right that's why it's so important not to get too busy in life that's it because when you're busy in life and you're caught up with all of this stuff beyond what you should be and it's not in Balance where's the real you he's sitting hypothetically speaking on the Shelf but you pick up and you start reading about who do you start reading about I'm trying to close who do you start reading about yourself and you say you say wow I can do that wow I I can do that and and and you know what else you see in here you see some of your mistakes right you see you see David you know bash Sheba I mean big mistake it's there in the book but then you see the real you that's it and the real you said create in me a clean heartart oh God that's right and renew a right Spirit within me you see oh my goodness yeah let's bow our heads Lord Jesus the real me if we could just push back father the things that so easily beset us we would see the real Us in the mirror of the word of God and the Paradox Lord is that you give us the strength to do that it's the word in the word revealed in the word Lord I I pray you'd give us more faith you've given us the power you've given us all of all of yourself has been hoard out in the bright age we we are here we have access to the full complete person of Jesus Christ but we lack the faith amen God first of all forgive us for our iniquity forgive us for our laziness forgive us for being lukewarm for the times we get lukewarm and we we get caught up in life Lord and and help us father to to put to put you first Lord give us that Faith give us more Revelation that's it more revelation of your word so that we can see who we really are because we need that we need that to access our Victory Lord we just thank you tonight for your word I just to be honest Lord I don't I don't really have any words to say
