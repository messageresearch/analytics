[36:00] the things that we do
[36:02] amen I want to start with just a couple
[36:06] quick
[36:07] things here we

[36:11] remind everyone that this coming
[36:12] Wednesday Lord willing brother Marcus
[36:14] Becker will be here and uh
[36:17] would love to have had him for more time
[36:19] but I'm glad that the Lord had that spot
[36:22] in the schedule for us that we could
[36:25] have a little time together as a church
[36:28] with him we also have a brother and
[36:31] sister that is coming from the Ukraine I
[36:33] think to arrive here in
[36:36] earlier mid part of this coming week
[36:39] and you know I struggle with names but
[36:43] um anyway we just pray Lord would just
[36:47] be with our brother and sister give them
[36:48] traveling Mercies
[36:50] now Saints
[36:54] there's things in life that we don't
[36:56] understand
[36:59] challenges trials and tests
[37:03] and um
[37:05] I received in the last couple days a
[37:07] lovely email from our sister Andrea
[37:10] Grant
[37:11] and uh
[37:15] I really don't have to say this I don't
[37:18] want to start bawling but
[37:19] you know she's faced quite a challenge
[37:22] in the with her health and her body
[37:26] the last years and
[37:28] she just shared this lovely email uh
[37:31] and what was beautiful to me about it it
[37:34] wasn't so much about the condition that
[37:36] she's facing right now
[37:38] was the confession that she's actually
[37:40] making about that
[37:42] it's not so much as Satan's trying to
[37:45] put cancer back in my body
[37:48] as it was the quite lengthy
[37:51] sharing of scripture quotes and thoughts
[37:55] of declaring that of no other position
[37:58] but to declare that I'm healed amen I
[38:02] have no other position to declare my
[38:04] gods in control I have no other position
[38:07] and she shared quotes and and quotes
[38:10] about John Ryan and about those sisters
[38:12] that were in the line and they went home
[38:15] and got sicker but on the morning that
[38:17] that sister felt the coolness go through
[38:20] her body and she went to tell her
[38:22] neighbor and she gets to the neighbor's
[38:24] house and the neighbor is running around
[38:25] the house shouting Hallelujah to realize
[38:29] oh amen
[38:32] the Holy Ghost
[38:34] the healing presence of God had come
[38:36] through the neighborhood
[38:39] and our sister Andrea said
[38:42] I will be
[38:44] amen I will be found praising God
[38:49] when he comes to me
[38:51] amen amen
[38:53] but the doctor says
[38:57] the devil wants us to believe
[39:01] but it's beautiful
[39:03] to see someone say I don't care
[39:06] I don't care my God's in control
[39:09] amen I'm going to believe what the word
[39:11] says about me
[39:12] amen so he's trying to get
[39:15] uh to to come back and assault our
[39:19] sister
[39:20] and um but she has said I'm going to
[39:23] stand in faith I'm not going to waver
[39:26] I'm going to stand in faith and she
[39:28] declared I'm believing I'm Healed amen
[39:31] now my brother and sister the prophet of
[39:33] God shows us scripture shows us the
[39:35] prophet of God elaborates on this that
[39:37] that's the only position we can take we
[39:40] can't say well I don't know this and
[39:42] this and this and this and maybe if God
[39:44] chooses to heal me no wrong position we
[39:46] are healed in the name of Jesus Christ
[39:49] my I I just had a couple scriptures I
[39:52] wanted to share and so she's confessing
[39:54] she's healed she's confessing that she's
[39:57] standing with the word of God and for
[40:00] the word of God and I say this morning
[40:02] if you would join together with me we're
[40:04] going to confess with our sister that
[40:07] she is healed in the name of Jesus
[40:09] Christ that the power of God is greater
[40:12] right
[40:13] he that is within you is greater than he
[40:16] that is in the world and will stand here
[40:19] and we'll take God's position every time
[40:22] Lord help us to take your position every
[40:26] time
[40:28] amen
[40:28] hallelujah
[40:30] now Isaiah 53 and 5
[40:34] but he was wounded for our
[40:36] transgressions
[40:37] he was bruised for our iniquities
[40:41] you see my brother and sister I want to
[40:43] just interject this what the Lord was
[40:45] doing
[40:47] speaking through the prophet Isaiah was
[40:49] all about you and I
[40:53] am God didn't say there might be but he
[40:55] was speaking to the believer and that
[40:58] word is just a solid people it's Old
[41:00] Testament it's New Testament it's God's
[41:02] word
[41:04] amen
[41:06] he was bruised for our iniquity the
[41:08] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[41:11] and with his stripes we are healed can
[41:15] we say thank you Lord we give praise to
[41:18] you today Lord and say thank you from
[41:20] the depths of our hearts because your
[41:22] word says that by the stripes that were
[41:24] laid on you that we are healed and
[41:27] there's never been a scripture to take
[41:29] that away
[41:30] Hallelujah first Peter the second
[41:33] chapter
[41:34] verses 24 and 25.
[41:38] who his own
[41:40] self bear our sins in his own body
[41:43] on the tree that we being dead to sins
[41:46] should live unto righteousness
[41:50] by whose Stripes you were healed amen
[41:53] amen I say it's a finished work

[42:59] already had this thought already these
[43:01] things were laid out father
[43:03] and to say Lord how the testimony of our
[43:07] sister
[43:08] her Declaration of where she stands
[43:10] father to me father today it would be as
[43:14] though I could preach this sermon with
[43:16] the inspiration from our sister Andreas
[43:18] email
[43:20] but Lord you chose to give the
[43:22] inspiration for the word
[43:24] and then allow me to read that
[43:27] oh Father
[43:29] to be Lord in your mind to be in one
[43:32] Accord with you
[43:34] Lord to be able to stand and say
[43:37] my God is an awesome God
[43:40] this special song this morning songs of
[43:43] brother Jason
[43:45] brought
[43:46] for us to sing this morning Lord Jesus
[43:49] just testifies to me over and over again
[43:51] my God is in control
[43:54] my God is in control of all things Lord
[43:57] and regardless of what it looks like on
[44:00] the outside regardless of what
[44:01] circumstance may be coming an afflicting
[44:05] but lord it's not about our circumstance
[44:07] Lord Jesus it's about you and your word
[44:10] and we claim that word and we confess
[44:12] that word we believe that word and Lord
[44:15] we will stand upon that word today now
[44:18] Lord with our hands lifted up Lord our
[44:20] hearts lifted up father we claim healing
[44:23] for our sister Andrea ask you to come on
[44:26] the scene Lord that thy perfect will be
[44:28] done Lord our sister Elizabeth Lord our
[44:31] sister Erica and whatever needs Lord
[44:33] that there might be in this body and the
[44:36] body of Christ Lord we lift them before
[44:39] you father and no matter what kind of
[44:41] smoke screen that Satan might present
[44:43] Lord we're going to stand fast upon the
[44:45] word because you are our healer you are
[44:49] our savior you are our provider and we
[44:52] will testify that to our our last breath
[44:55] Lord now father we ask you to move and
[44:57] thy perfect will be done in the name of
[45:00] Jesus Christ
[45:02] amen and amen and amen hallelujah
[45:06] hallelujah God bless you Saints I want
[45:09] to speak to you today
[45:14] once again on the title or overall
[45:16] thought of our position of strength and
[45:18] you know it might not seem like
[45:20] sometimes these things were preaching on
[45:21] are really a position of strength but
[45:25] you see when the word is laid the
[45:27] foundation is laid in our soul
[45:29] then God can build upon that and so
[45:32] sometimes God builds
[45:33] then he has to stop
[45:35] and he has to then as it were tie in the
[45:38] rebar
[45:40] and you know when you build a big
[45:41] building
[45:43] you don't just build a building and then
[45:44] add everything after the fact
[45:48] but sometimes in the building
[45:50] of a large building and that's what you
[45:52] are because you have been built big
[45:54] enough to house the Holy Ghost
[45:57] I'm telling you you're not some little
[45:59] minuscule thing over here on the side to
[46:02] be pushed into the gutter but you are
[46:04] great big as it were mentioned amen the
[46:07] New Jerusalem my brother and sister some
[46:09] people are looking and God do what he
[46:12] wants to do but some people are looking
[46:13] as the building the New Jerusalem
[46:16] realize the New Jerusalem is Christ and
[46:19] his pride together
[46:21] that's the New Jerusalem God's not in
[46:23] buildings my brother and sister God
[46:25] chooses to inhabit buildings and he
[46:27] makes them sacred places but my brother
[46:30] and sister God's not into real estate
[46:33] amen but he is into you and I
[46:36] Hallelujah
[46:38] oh my
[46:40] let's just go here I want to speak to
[46:43] you this morning led by heavenly vision
[46:45] amen I like that
[46:48] brother Joss
[46:50] by being a small
[46:55] leadership important thing
[46:58] how we're LED
[47:01] well
[47:02] my brother and sister
[47:03] that's what's important
[47:06] we can be led by man
[47:08] we can be led by politics which is in
[47:11] essence man with the spirit on him
[47:14] you realize that's what all politicians
[47:16] are just men with spirits on them but
[47:19] we're not here to talk about the devil
[47:20] this morning so anyway
[47:23] look at this now as we stand here led by
[47:27] heavenly vision
[47:28] let's just go into the word
[47:31] my familiar scripture is it not
[47:35] yes
[47:37] I tell you what my brother and sister
[47:40] very familiar scripture
[47:43] because you see
[47:46] I can say today I don't mean to keep you
[47:48] standing but I'm happy to say today that
[47:51] we are not confined by the world we live
[47:53] in
[47:57] if we don't watch
[47:59] what Satan's doing
[48:01] he will try to build a laodicean hedge
[48:04] around you and I
[48:06] where all we see is the world
[48:09] now not that we'd be worldly
[48:12] but all we would see is the world
[48:14] we'd see the confusion in the land
[48:17] have you ever seen America
[48:20] so rampantly run by confusion
[48:25] I'm not a very bright guy and I don't
[48:26] say that to demean myself but in the
[48:28] whole picture I'm not a very smart guy
[48:30] but I know you can't print more money
[48:31] and get rich
[48:36] and I can't
[48:38] I can't declare that destroying the
[48:40] infrastructure of a Nation that's
[48:42] recorded right in Scripture
[48:45] destroy that and we'll be a better
[48:48] people
[48:50] and the wars and the rumors of wars
[48:54] troubles in the land
[48:57] our heart goes out
[48:59] those Saints have nothing to do with
[49:01] politics and the spirits of the age but
[49:04] once again we're seeing an offensive
[49:05] Ukraine Russia fighting destruction just
[49:09] coming everywhere you know the devil's
[49:11] rejoicing
[49:13] but you know who's rejoicing more than
[49:14] the devil
[49:16] the bride of Christ
[49:17] amen because we're seeing the word of
[49:20] God come to pass and if you read the
[49:23] emails in the texts and and those things
[49:25] that are shared coming from the
[49:27] Believers talking about everything we
[49:29] have has been destroyed praise God
[49:33] that takes something more than just
[49:35] humans
[49:36] not take something that is Supernatural
[49:39] because they're seeing a shifting
[49:42] they're seeing a moving they're seeing
[49:44] scripture being fulfilled they're
[49:46] rejoicing in that even though everything
[49:48] that they own in life has been taken
[49:51] from them
[49:52] that would be nothing short of God
[49:56] stress and strain on the mind the
[49:58] greatest battle as the prophet said
[50:02] I just did some reading in the early
[50:03] hours
[50:05] following this thought
[50:09] year over year
[50:11] mental instability is what some of them
[50:13] politically want to call it
[50:18] has been increasing
[50:21] not exponential my brother and sister it
[50:23] didn't go from nothing to 50 or
[50:25] something like that but just a steady
[50:28] increase
[50:30] some research says that the reason of
[50:33] this
[50:34] is a lack of Hope
[50:38] aren't you glad our hope
[50:41] it's been Anchored In Jesus Christ it's
[50:43] not anchored in the world we live in
[50:48] but see we're not exempt from those
[50:50] things we can have as it were
[50:52] things in our life chemical imbalances
[50:55] hormones all these kind of things
[50:58] but you see we've been given a place to
[51:00] let off the pressure we've been given a
[51:03] place that we can come and say you know
[51:05] what I'm stressed
[51:07] I feel
[51:09] we don't like to use words like this but
[51:11] I feel depressed or I feel discouraged
[51:13] or I feel distressed
[51:16] and if you notice what happens then God
[51:18] comes right in
[51:20] something comes and that is gone
[51:25] and we're able to
[51:26] grasp beholds
[51:28] I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God
[51:31] and this world is not
[51:35] my home
[51:38] oh Hallelujah Hebrews 11. we'll start
[51:42] with the verse 13.
[51:44] these all died in faith not having
[51:46] received the promises but have seen them
[51:49] afar off now my brother and sister
[51:52] that's actually very encouraging because
[51:53] you see these people didn't pass from
[51:55] this Earth saying we never saw a promise
[51:57] but they saw them even though the
[52:00] Fulfillment now my brother and sister I
[52:02] want you to catch this hopefully I don't
[52:03] keep you standing until you'll pass out
[52:05] but I want you to understand having seen
[52:08] them afar off is not that it took not
[52:11] did not take place in their life but
[52:13] they're looking to the Fulfillment of
[52:15] that promise so there was attributes and
[52:18] things of the promise that come out in
[52:21] their life it come out in their
[52:22] day-to-day life but the Fulfillment or
[52:25] the maturity of that promise was still
[52:28] out in front of them okay you understand
[52:30] me amen so it's there they were
[52:33] persuaded of them and embrace them and
[52:36] confess this is what oh my brother and
[52:38] sister I hope it'll get emotional this
[52:40] morning but this is what struck my heart
[52:42] in relation of sister Andrea's email
[52:44] mail to me and what I was studying what
[52:48] I already had recorded in my notes is
[52:50] the fact that it you're persuaded and
[52:53] you've embraced it and then you believe
[52:55] it so much you confess it
[52:57] oh it's one thing to have something
[52:59] anchored down in the heart but it's
[53:01] another thing by brother and sister to
[53:03] believe something so strongly that you
[53:06] will step out against all thought all
[53:09] opinion all circumstance and say I
[53:12] believe this
[53:13] oh Hallelujah amen they confessed that
[53:17] they were strangers and pilgrims on the
[53:19] Earth
[53:20] for they that say such things declare
[53:22] plainly that they seek a country and
[53:25] truly if they had been mindful of that
[53:27] country from whence they had came out
[53:29] they might have had opportunity to have
[53:32] returned but now they desire a better
[53:35] country that is a Heavenly wherefore God
[53:38] is not ashamed to be called their God
[53:40] isn't that a position my brother and
[53:42] sister they said many many Mighty Men
[53:44] come in that day and said didn't we do
[53:47] many mighty works in your name and he
[53:49] says depart from me but to be my brother
[53:51] and sister that we have come that God is
[53:56] happy to be called our God
[53:58] oh Hallelujah for he has prepared for
[54:01] them
[54:02] City Heavenly Father we ask you this
[54:05] bless the service today
[54:06] Lord just
[54:08] father anoint us Lord just to speak your
[54:11] word amen anoint Hearts to receive
[54:14] father
[54:15] oh Father we thank you
[54:18] we thank you for the life we thank you
[54:20] for the work that you're doing
[54:23] we just ask you to come and
[54:25] Lord open our Horizons as it were open
[54:28] our our hearts let us be so hungry
[54:32] let our thoughts be on you father
[54:35] we ask for this guidance in the name of
[54:38] Jesus Christ amen you may be seated
[54:41] Saints
[54:44] I hope you all don't mind I get a little
[54:45] excited today
[54:48] amen just this has been such a beautiful
[54:50] thought
[54:52] now remember the Saints of the ages
[54:54] they were living to the very moment my
[54:56] brother and sister as their lives either
[54:59] were taken from them or they'd live the
[55:01] Fulfillment of their life and they lived
[55:03] to the very moment still believing they
[55:05] were still persuaded they were still
[55:07] embracing the promise and confessing the
[55:10] promise and I say Lord let us be in that
[55:12] position in our life let it never come a
[55:15] time that we would look back and say I
[55:16] once was on fire for God but may we get
[55:19] up every morning of every day of our
[55:21] lives and say Lord I Thank you for what
[55:24] you have done you've poured that fire
[55:26] that life in me and Lord I thank you for
[55:29] that because you see my brother and
[55:31] sister the fire waivers the flame
[55:34] waivers
[55:36] for lack of food
[55:40] and you'll find that Satan comes and
[55:42] what is the first thing you try to do he
[55:44] takes us away from praying he takes us
[55:46] from reading our Bible he takes us from
[55:48] fellowshipping this is why true Godly
[55:51] Fellowship is important not Fellowship
[55:53] where we get together and talk about all
[55:55] kinds of nonsense but a fellowship that
[55:57] we come together what are we doing we're
[55:59] feeding one another's flame and God
[56:02] called us by the word to come and be a
[56:04] helper in Feeding of the flame and so I
[56:08] pray that God would just anoint each one
[56:10] of us oh Lord not to gossam not to speak
[56:12] ill not to speak of vain things but to
[56:15] come feed the flame of the Holy Ghost in
[56:17] each other's lives amen so it was there
[56:20] look at these Saints of old my brother
[56:22] and sister they come from the rich and
[56:24] they come from the poor and every class
[56:26] of life in between and something
[56:28] happened to them and it was a change in
[56:31] the Dynamics of their life now we we
[56:33] read you know when brother Branham was
[56:36] talking about mechanics and Dynamics my
[56:38] brother and sister it's one thing to how
[56:40] of the body as it were the car it's
[56:43] there it's got wheels it's got
[56:44] everything that's necessary might even
[56:46] have a functioning battery the windows
[56:48] will go up and down this stereo work the
[56:50] lights will turn on but if you can't get
[56:53] it to move and that's the problem we're
[56:55] seeing in the day that we live in is
[56:57] there's not enough dynamic in the church
[56:59] to get it to move from its position to
[57:02] another position but I'll tell you what
[57:04] God has come down he's put the mechanics
[57:07] the Dynamics that power of the Holy
[57:09] Ghost and it's there my brother and
[57:11] sister that it's there that we no longer
[57:13] want to stay where we were it's not a
[57:16] matter of ministry coming and saying oh
[57:18] church you've got to move forward you've
[57:20] got to move forward you need to move out
[57:22] of this no my brother and sister it's a
[57:24] body of Believers anointed by the very
[57:27] Life of Christ that say I want to move I
[57:30] want to change my position I want to
[57:32] change the dynamic of my life
[57:35] oh people are waiting for something to
[57:37] move them but it should be right there
[57:39] if we're feeding it it will come to life
[57:41] it will move us
[57:43] amen because I'm telling you right now
[57:45] this flesh
[57:46] likes this flesh and this flesh likes
[57:49] this flesh enough this flesh will
[57:51] convince this flesh not to move
[57:55] God sent a prophet that's good God sent
[57:57] a prophet but did the word that came
[57:59] through him spark something in US did it
[58:02] bring something to life that we would
[58:04] say praise the Lord I'm going to get up
[58:06] this morning and take another step
[58:09] closer I'm going to get up this morning
[58:11] and I'm going to let this old flesh die
[58:13] just a little bit more
[58:15] and we say oh brother Paul don't seem
[58:17] like I'm making progress well I'm
[58:19] telling you God knows what you're doing
[58:21] and God knows what he's doing in you and
[58:23] so just leave it let the Lord amen let
[58:26] the Lord do the work
[58:28] every work that man has ever done all
[58:30] through scripture God had to go back and
[58:32] fix it
[58:34] that's right amen
[58:36] what happened
[58:38] their focus changed
[58:46] I'll share a little story with you about
[58:48] Focus
[58:50] I was once told this story by minister
[58:52] in Africa
[58:54] they took a minister
[58:57] on a great field trip and I've been
[58:58] sister Jerry and I've been on one of
[59:00] these so I can tell you how great this
[59:01] is a great field trip to Krueger
[59:05] and you know you can't just camp
[59:06] anywhere so you got to Camp inside these
[59:08] little compounds and you know it's just
[59:10] a very unique interesting
[59:13] um experience and even then still you
[59:15] know a delivery man left a gate open on
[59:17] one of those compounds and sister Jerry
[59:19] and I of course slept right through and
[59:21] if we had left our door open maybe we
[59:22] wouldn't be here right now
[59:24] but somebody left the gate open and in
[59:27] the middle of the night I guess they
[59:28] were shouting and people running to and
[59:31] fro and headlights shining and somebody
[59:33] inside the compound had went outside to
[59:36] go to a vehicle and there's a lion
[59:39] but that's the reason you're inside the
[59:40] compound is so there is no Lions outside
[59:43] your door
[59:44] but somebody left the gate open but
[59:46] anyway the lion you know afraid was
[59:49] happening it fled they searched the
[59:51] whole compound couldn't find it but
[59:53] that's the kind of world as as this
[59:54] brother charity says this is a world
[59:56] where the animals are loose and the
[59:58] humans are in the cage
[1:00:00] and so it's there my brother and sister
[1:00:02] they're on this wonderful experience
[1:00:05] and they're out in the middle of Kruger
[1:00:07] National Park
[1:00:09] and a brother says can you get me to a
[1:00:11] telephone and there was like is it an
[1:00:14] emergency brother he says no I just want
[1:00:16] to check my brokerage account
[1:00:19] I agree sister Carrie what
[1:00:23] so they found you know this is a three
[1:00:26] four five day experience and they found
[1:00:28] a phone for him and a couple days later
[1:00:31] maybe it was the next day I don't
[1:00:32] remember exactly it's like can we find
[1:00:33] another telephone
[1:00:35] and they're like
[1:00:36] I need to check my brokerage account
[1:00:39] you know
[1:00:41] the brother told me he says
[1:00:43] we was thinking about inviting the
[1:00:45] brother back to preach at the church
[1:00:47] but we realized his Focus was not really
[1:00:50] upon what God had offered him his Focus
[1:00:54] was on his brokerage account and so we
[1:00:56] just drove him to the airplane airport
[1:00:58] and bought him a plane ticket and sent
[1:01:00] him home so he could look at his
[1:01:01] brokerage account
[1:01:02] see it's important what our focus is my
[1:01:05] brother and sister we come into the
[1:01:07] house of God and if our focus is
[1:01:09] somewhere else we're going to walk out
[1:01:10] of the house of God and your spiritual
[1:01:12] brokerage account will have just went
[1:01:14] down but if we invest in the things of
[1:01:17] God and we're focused on the word of God
[1:01:19] our spiritual brokerage account keeps
[1:01:22] building up building up oh wouldn't you
[1:01:24] want to be a spiritual millionaire amen
[1:01:26] when I say that I just use that as a
[1:01:28] context to come to the place that our
[1:01:31] light is lit and it's Burning Brightly
[1:01:33] amen not just saying we're message
[1:01:36] Believers but the Life of Christ
[1:01:38] actually burning within us that it's
[1:01:41] visible amen so it's there what happened
[1:01:44] to the Saints of old my brother and
[1:01:46] sister the change of their Dynamics what
[1:01:48] it was was their focus had changed no
[1:01:50] doubt they were the butcher the baker or
[1:01:52] the Candlestick maker and people started
[1:01:55] say some things happen have you ever
[1:01:56] noticed that about people some things
[1:01:58] happened about them my brother and
[1:02:01] sister what was it their focus had
[1:02:03] changed and that God started to come and
[1:02:05] have preeminence in their life and when
[1:02:07] he has preeminence my brother and sister
[1:02:09] oh let me say it this way if God has got
[1:02:12] preeminence in our lives it will be be
[1:02:15] obvious
[1:02:17] people say well I don't want them
[1:02:18] judging me forget about us judging you
[1:02:21] what about God judging you amen what
[1:02:23] about God saying I want to be on display
[1:02:25] in your life in fact I am on display in
[1:02:29] your life
[1:02:30] hallelujah amen so you see what it is
[1:02:33] the Focus changing look how that changed
[1:02:36] my brother and sister where we don't
[1:02:38] sing this world is not my home just as a
[1:02:41] song
[1:02:43] it comes from deep within us this world
[1:02:45] is not my home what you focused on that
[1:02:49] and you had to make a decision right we
[1:02:52] have to make a decision what is my home
[1:02:58] I don't choose this Earth
[1:03:00] I don't choose the spirit of this Earth
[1:03:02] because well we see what it's producing
[1:03:06] now people sometimes think
[1:03:08] oh if I could put it this way people say
[1:03:11] well Brother Paul's pretty judgmental
[1:03:12] I've been told that not that far in the
[1:03:14] past you're judgmental
[1:03:16] no actually please don't believe that
[1:03:19] because this is going to sound very
[1:03:21] heady of me
[1:03:24] but I've been blessed with an ability to
[1:03:26] just state facts as they are without
[1:03:27] having emotion attached
[1:03:30] in other words when I see somebody who's
[1:03:31] destroying their life or their life is
[1:03:33] being destroyed by the spirit of the age
[1:03:35] I can declare what I see
[1:03:38] but it doesn't mean I have emotion
[1:03:39] attached to that as though I would do
[1:03:43] because I would trust by now vote me out
[1:03:45] as a pastor if you don't feel this way
[1:03:47] that you would know my heart my motive
[1:03:49] my desire that I I could if I would you
[1:03:52] know I've shared with you about being a
[1:03:53] manipulator and people get nervous when
[1:03:55] people start talking the preacher said
[1:03:56] manipulate in church I'm nervous
[1:04:00] but you realize there's another side of
[1:04:02] that that if I could I would put every
[1:04:04] one of us into Heavenly places right now
[1:04:06] I would take us into a place that would
[1:04:09] be my heart's desire to just say the
[1:04:11] right things do the right things preach
[1:04:13] the right things that would cause each
[1:04:14] one of us to be filled with the Holy
[1:04:16] Ghost and moving in the right direction
[1:04:17] but somebody will be saying I was
[1:04:20] manipulated
[1:04:22] well praise the Lord
[1:04:24] praise the Lord I'm glad I've been
[1:04:27] manipulated this world is not my home I
[1:04:29] look at it everywhere I go and I say
[1:04:31] Lord please let me out of here I want
[1:04:34] out of here Lord I want to escape this
[1:04:37] zoo that we call Earth
[1:04:39] amen now look at this these Saints of
[1:04:42] Hebrews 11 the culture of their day the
[1:04:45] culture of their lives changed
[1:04:48] they no longer were focused now don't
[1:04:51] get me wrong Saints
[1:04:52] I do believe that God In Balance
[1:04:55] has no problem with you gaining as it
[1:04:58] would financially or World things as
[1:05:00] long as you put him first
[1:05:03] the moment that we put something else
[1:05:05] before God
[1:05:07] there's where our Trouble Comes and you
[1:05:09] know there's just as many poor people
[1:05:10] going to go to hell as rich people so it
[1:05:13] isn't about your financial picture it's
[1:05:15] about your desire and what your focus is
[1:05:18] on
[1:05:19] amen you know there's a family I won't
[1:05:22] declare from where they're at they like
[1:05:24] to remain Incognito but my brother and
[1:05:26] sister there's a family that the brother
[1:05:28] has shared with me personally a long
[1:05:30] ways from here
[1:05:32] and he says you know what when we as a
[1:05:34] family not just me and my wife but my
[1:05:37] children and my sons and their wives and
[1:05:39] my daughters and their husbands when we
[1:05:41] started putting God first and he said
[1:05:43] when I mean first I mean really first
[1:05:45] like we wouldn't even leave the office
[1:05:47] for work when without asking God to give
[1:05:50] us the wisdom for every decision and
[1:05:52] everything and he said from that day on
[1:05:54] he said brother Paul I don't know any
[1:05:56] other way to say it but the money
[1:05:58] started pouring in and we started giving
[1:06:01] it out and it started pouring in even
[1:06:03] greater and it just kept going
[1:06:05] exponentially and he says no one even
[1:06:08] really knows how many millions of years
[1:06:10] passes through our hands because we
[1:06:13] choose to remain anonymous we choose to
[1:06:16] drive older vehicles we choose to be
[1:06:19] low-key we choose to do this and I'm
[1:06:21] telling you I know he's saying the truth
[1:06:23] because when there was needs in in Chile
[1:06:25] the brother gave tens of thousands of
[1:06:27] dollars as per into those needs and my
[1:06:30] brother and sister said please he said
[1:06:32] brother Paul don't don't don't even
[1:06:33] share my name
[1:06:36] I'm not one bit of credit this is God's
[1:06:38] money he just trusted me to have it for
[1:06:40] a moment and pass it on so see we we got
[1:06:43] to get away from this idea that that if
[1:06:45] uh we've been blessed as it were in the
[1:06:47] natural life that we can't be spiritual
[1:06:49] no I say my brother and sister at
[1:06:51] whatever tool Satan would desire to use
[1:06:54] against you we as Sons and Daughters of
[1:06:57] God have overcome that amen so if it's
[1:07:00] money women popularity this that or the
[1:07:03] other whatever it might be God's already
[1:07:05] given us an ability to overcome that and
[1:07:08] he didn't do that because we are the
[1:07:10] best of the best in the flesh my brother
[1:07:12] and sister he did that because he looked
[1:07:14] at a people and said I see something in
[1:07:16] them I see a life in them and what was
[1:07:19] he looking at in the reflection he was
[1:07:21] looking at himself he wasn't looking at
[1:07:23] our flesh he wasn't looking people I'm
[1:07:25] trying I'm trying quit trying and let
[1:07:28] God see his own reflection in your life
[1:07:30] young people you say it's hard to serve
[1:07:33] the Lord and I say it is but quit
[1:07:36] looking at your own life and look at
[1:07:38] Christ and say you know what lord it's
[1:07:40] you and it's going to only be you that's
[1:07:42] going to bring me through this world
[1:07:44] unscathed amen because the minute we
[1:07:47] start looking at the flesh all kinds of
[1:07:49] things pop up
[1:07:51] yeah
[1:07:53] oh now look at this the cultures the
[1:07:55] ideas
[1:07:57] see what is culture my brother and
[1:07:59] sister
[1:08:00] culture is tied in ideas and customs and
[1:08:04] social behavior
[1:08:08] oftentimes what we really see in culture
[1:08:10] is a more focus on social behavior
[1:08:15] but I'm telling you
[1:08:16] the Lord would just knock some of these
[1:08:18] we'll just pick on the young men
[1:08:21] if the Lord would just knock some of
[1:08:22] these young men in the head a little bit
[1:08:24] get all of their neutrons and ions and
[1:08:27] whatever else all lined up and they
[1:08:29] would look in the mirror and they'd go
[1:08:30] oh I went in public like this
[1:08:33] but you see culture
[1:08:35] has come
[1:08:37] and it's set a dynamic in front of them
[1:08:40] and I know I've mimicked this a lot and
[1:08:42] I probably shouldn't
[1:08:44] but just one more time
[1:08:47] these young men just saw one the other
[1:08:49] day
[1:08:49] walking like a bow-legged chicken
[1:08:54] because that's the way you got to walk
[1:08:56] to keep your pants from falling off
[1:09:00] and they got their belt cinched tight
[1:09:03] below their bum
[1:09:05] and then they walk like this
[1:09:08] to keep their pants up
[1:09:10] and you ask them why do you do this
[1:09:14] my identity
[1:09:16] no it can't be your identity there's
[1:09:18] another million of you
[1:09:20] that's not your identity that's cultures
[1:09:25] identity
[1:09:27] well I should say laodicean culture
[1:09:31] identity
[1:09:32] because you know we have a culture
[1:09:35] oh Hallelujah if we are in the right
[1:09:38] place if we're preaching the word
[1:09:40] unadulterated we as message Believers
[1:09:42] have a culture and that culture is word
[1:09:45] first amen no other substitute no
[1:09:49] delusion nothing it is the word and only
[1:09:52] the word that's what matters and when
[1:09:54] the word becomes so strong in us they
[1:09:58] can take a little snippet for DNA and
[1:10:00] all they'll come back with it looks to
[1:10:02] me like this must be a Son of God this
[1:10:05] is not a son of laodicea I find no DNA
[1:10:09] matching cane I don't find any uh DNA
[1:10:13] matching Nimrod I don't find any
[1:10:15] Babylonian genes in them I only find the
[1:10:19] very nature and the life of Jesus Christ
[1:10:22] and it's flowing through their veins we
[1:10:25] don't have to hunt and Peck to find it
[1:10:27] Well we take a little snippet of what
[1:10:29] they wear yeah that looks like they are
[1:10:31] Godly it take a little snippet of this
[1:10:33] or a little snippet of that but I say
[1:10:35] they let God take a sample as it were of
[1:10:38] every part of our being and if that part
[1:10:41] don't pass the God test then Lord take
[1:10:43] us back again and wash us again and put
[1:10:47] us in the fire again that everything
[1:10:49] that we are every fiber of our being
[1:10:52] would pass the test it said son or
[1:10:55] daughter of God
[1:10:57] Hallelujah and that's what happened with
[1:11:00] these Saints my brother and sister of
[1:11:02] Hebrews 11 we see through the word do
[1:11:05] you notice how beautiful this is that
[1:11:07] God did not hide their mistakes
[1:11:10] amen that's right sometimes we get a
[1:11:13] little embarrassed you know because well
[1:11:14] I've made a mistake and I I think I'll
[1:11:16] just quit going to church because I
[1:11:17] don't want to oh no I'm sorry God
[1:11:18] already broadcast it
[1:11:21] amen you you think you're going to hide
[1:11:22] your mistakes no I'm sorry the word says
[1:11:24] whatever is done in secret will be made
[1:11:25] open but if you're amongst the body of
[1:11:27] Believers they're going to look at it
[1:11:29] and say well pray to the Lord
[1:11:30] brother so and so sister so and so that
[1:11:33] sure was a blunder I wonder what that
[1:11:35] shoe tasted like
[1:11:39] and then it moves right from there
[1:11:42] and God says
[1:11:45] I'm not going to hide your mistakes
[1:11:48] but I will glorify
[1:11:51] oh
[1:11:53] I will glorify
[1:11:55] myself
[1:11:57] in you
[1:11:59] oh the world's out here
[1:12:02] look at them but I want to know what God
[1:12:05] said about it did God say welcome my son
[1:12:08] welcome my daughter I pour my spirit
[1:12:11] into you my brother and sister don't be
[1:12:13] worried about what the world says about
[1:12:14] that but it's when God comes and doesn't
[1:12:17] like what he sees then we've got a real
[1:12:20] something to worry about
[1:12:22] but we see how God is moving this is
[1:12:25] what touched these Saints in Hebrews 11
[1:12:27] a record of that amen why now I had a
[1:12:30] whole bunch of stuff I was going to add
[1:12:32] to this but I left that out amen not for
[1:12:35] your my sake your sake actually because
[1:12:37] you see you would have said amen to it I
[1:12:39] know you would have but it took me
[1:12:41] another hour to have preached it so
[1:12:43] we'll just acknowledge the fact that
[1:12:45] we'll come because you know as it would
[1:12:47] be uh you know what the message is you
[1:12:49] know what the word is amen we've been
[1:12:51] changed someone say amen and why because
[1:12:54] we decided to be no because we've been
[1:12:57] Reborn
[1:12:59] amen that's when the blood of Jesus
[1:13:01] Christ took an old nature washed it out
[1:13:03] put a new nature in there and said
[1:13:05] you'll no longer be but now you are
[1:13:10] you are not my people
[1:13:14] we could sum that up real real
[1:13:17] full right there you're not my people
[1:13:20] but now
[1:13:21] you're my people
[1:13:23] and you know how it is whether you're a
[1:13:25] gangster or a sports
[1:13:27] nut or whatever it is people want to be
[1:13:30] your people
[1:13:33] yeah have you ever noticed that
[1:13:35] I was in Home Depot the other day
[1:13:37] I thought it was pretty ironic I saw I
[1:13:40] don't remember the name on The Jersey
[1:13:41] now I think it was Miami Dolphins Jersey
[1:13:43] I'm not sure but I think it was
[1:13:46] I saw three
[1:13:48] I think there must have been brothers
[1:13:49] because they all had the same name and
[1:13:51] number on them
[1:13:52] might have been a family identity number
[1:13:55] but all walking around with kind of a
[1:13:58] blue and whatever light blue shaded deal
[1:14:01] with somebody's name on the back
[1:14:05] and I felt like sorry I'm just warped
[1:14:07] but I felt like going um is that your
[1:14:10] brother down there
[1:14:11] but you see the problem is they're
[1:14:13] having identity crisis
[1:14:15] they don't know who they are so they
[1:14:17] have to find someone to identify him and
[1:14:19] as they identify more into these things
[1:14:22] of the carnal into laodicea they
[1:14:24] identify Less in who they are I want you
[1:14:27] to see this and you say well what's that
[1:14:28] got to do with anything because that's
[1:14:30] what Satan's doing and the prophet of
[1:14:32] God if you want it I could take you
[1:14:34] through the Long Trail the prophet of
[1:14:35] God said this is where they are are you
[1:14:37] a Christian no I'm a Baptist they put on
[1:14:40] a Baptist Jersey what are you I'm a
[1:14:42] Nazarene I'm a this I'm of that they're
[1:14:44] putting on an identity that's not an
[1:14:46] identity God called them to because he
[1:14:49] called us to identify as Sons and
[1:14:51] Daughters of God he called for us to
[1:14:53] identify as the bride of Christ amen and
[1:14:57] that's not a jersey my brother and
[1:14:58] sister and that's about some identity
[1:15:01] that's external that's deep down in the
[1:15:03] soul that's what God has called us to
[1:15:06] amen so what happened amen they come to
[1:15:09] a place the scripture says that you know
[1:15:11] they could have went back
[1:15:13] amen if they had wanted to
[1:15:17] can we go back
[1:15:20] well of course we can
[1:15:22] I don't mean to argue with you but of
[1:15:24] course you can go back
[1:15:27] the potential
[1:15:28] is there
[1:15:32] and Satan's there all the time
[1:15:35] using a phrase here a phrase their event
[1:15:37] here a something here and let me put it
[1:15:40] this way
[1:15:42] a little stumbling on our part
[1:15:44] and Satan's are always there to give a
[1:15:47] helping hand
[1:15:49] say I've just been trying to tell you
[1:15:51] for 25 years you're not really a
[1:15:54] Christian
[1:15:55] or if you want to be identified with a
[1:15:57] Christian that's fine put the Jersey on
[1:16:01] and just go off in that identity
[1:16:04] but you see they were offered an
[1:16:07] opportunity to go back and yes you were
[1:16:09] right brother David
[1:16:10] but I want you to see it my way
[1:16:13] amen
[1:16:19] could they go back
[1:16:20] I'm going to say yes they could
[1:16:23] there's always potential
[1:16:26] but you see they actually had to be able
[1:16:29] to recognize
[1:16:32] that other position
[1:16:36] now what has God done to our Saints
[1:16:39] is the world first and foremost
[1:16:42] no what's he done he's blurted and it's
[1:16:45] getting more blurred all the time it's
[1:16:47] fading away people are like don't you
[1:16:49] know who this is had somebody oh yeah
[1:16:51] yeah you know now I knew what they were
[1:16:53] talking about because there's been
[1:16:54] different things even shows up in farm
[1:16:56] magazines advertisements for Yellowstone
[1:16:59] and this guy's like do you know the
[1:17:01] character Ben and Yellowstone and I said
[1:17:03] oh I've been to Yellowstone
[1:17:05] you have yeah I was like maybe 10 years
[1:17:09] old or something but I've been no I'm
[1:17:11] not talking about that I'm talking about
[1:17:12] television show I said I don't know who
[1:17:14] they are
[1:17:16] see this thought that I'm preaching to
[1:17:18] you was in my mind
[1:17:19] I'm sorry
[1:17:21] I don't know who they are
[1:17:23] people that are unfaithful to each other
[1:17:25] Liars cheats and thieves and murderers
[1:17:28] and all of these I'm sorry I don't know
[1:17:30] who they are but I do know who Jesus
[1:17:33] Christ is well I'm a Christian too he
[1:17:35] was just telling me you were in a bar
[1:17:38] maybe you were witnessing
[1:17:42] or maybe you were just the witness
[1:17:46] you see my brother and sister
[1:17:48] it says they say such things for they
[1:17:52] that say such things declare plainly
[1:17:54] that they seek a country you know what
[1:17:56] it's coming down to our language is even
[1:17:58] changed we're not even saying this same
[1:18:01] thing and this is why I brought out
[1:18:03] money earlier I want to tie the ribbon
[1:18:05] for you it's there that we can be and
[1:18:07] God can bless us with a good job good
[1:18:09] Investments good things in our life but
[1:18:12] my brother and sister that didn't become
[1:18:13] the focus of our life our focus is
[1:18:15] Christ and all this is just peripheral
[1:18:18] and it's there that what we start to
[1:18:20] speak a language it's a different
[1:18:22] language than the world it would be like
[1:18:24] us getting off a plane I don't know
[1:18:26] where China Japan Korea uh Africa
[1:18:29] whatever we can't speak that language
[1:18:31] but when God comes on the scene he can
[1:18:33] draw from every nation Kindred and
[1:18:36] tongue and we speak the same language oh
[1:18:40] that's a supernatural power of God
[1:18:42] because our focus is not on the carnal
[1:18:44] it's not focused on what we have done or
[1:18:47] acquired Folk it's because they desire a
[1:18:51] better country amen they're Desiring a
[1:18:54] Heavenly country something that's there
[1:18:57] and God is not ashamed to be called
[1:18:58] their God for he has
[1:19:02] prepared
[1:19:03] them a city
[1:19:05] is that a Dwelling Place
[1:19:08] he has prepared them to be a Dwelling
[1:19:12] Place
[1:19:14] oh
[1:19:15] and someone say thank you Lord
[1:19:18] amen
[1:19:21] see we can try being mindful to being
[1:19:23] focused
[1:19:25] if we came to church just to put this
[1:19:27] out
[1:19:28] if we come to church to be focused today
[1:19:30] and I pray every one of us did
[1:19:35] when we think about the pot roast or
[1:19:37] lunch
[1:19:38] or what we need to do Monday morning
[1:19:43] we can choose to focus on that
[1:19:45] but when we come mindful of the things
[1:19:48] of God
[1:19:49] we literally and I think somebody will
[1:19:51] say Amen to this we literally have to
[1:19:53] take that and put it aside it doesn't
[1:19:57] just happen
[1:19:58] it doesn't just wow what am I going to
[1:20:01] do this afternoon I'm going to eat more
[1:20:02] than I should and I'm gonna lay down and
[1:20:04] take a nap and then I'm gonna call so
[1:20:06] and so and see if their family wants to
[1:20:07] fellowship and and that can consume our
[1:20:09] Sunday
[1:20:11] because it starts in thought and then it
[1:20:12] becomes deed
[1:20:14] and so our Sunday's consumed with the
[1:20:15] idea we're going to eat nice food take a
[1:20:17] nap and go visit someone
[1:20:18] and we walk out and somebody says I've
[1:20:20] seen this happen before it's
[1:20:21] embarrassing when I said I've seen it
[1:20:23] happen before it happened to me
[1:20:25] and somebody says uh hey what'd the
[1:20:28] preacher preach on this morning
[1:20:30] uh I remember it was in the Bible
[1:20:34] any
[1:20:35] um red I think it was two quotes maybe
[1:20:38] three
[1:20:41] thank you for being mindful
[1:20:44] thank you for focus
[1:20:47] that's why people get fired from their
[1:20:49] jobs
[1:20:52] they're not even mindful
[1:20:54] oh we could go off in another thing and
[1:20:56] I could tell you it's right in the
[1:20:57] scripture whatever you are in the house
[1:20:59] of God is what you will be in your life
[1:21:01] external people say no no no no I'm very
[1:21:04] diligent at work I don't believe you
[1:21:09] and I imagine you're
[1:21:10] boss that's got a job review
[1:21:13] that will agree with me also
[1:21:19] a Heavenly country
[1:21:22] now see my brother and sister they
[1:21:23] Saints of the ages they were living in
[1:21:25] the very moment these scriptures are
[1:21:27] written about believing they were
[1:21:29] persuaded they embraced it they
[1:21:31] confessed it and something changed
[1:21:33] Dynamics in their life
[1:21:35] does that sound familiar
[1:21:39] yeah
[1:21:40] that's what happened to me
[1:21:42] do you know because of this I'm going to
[1:21:44] be very bold this morning I'm actually
[1:21:46] identified in Hebrews 11.
[1:21:49] oh my name doesn't appear there but I am
[1:21:51] in Hebrews 11 because I am a Son of God
[1:21:54] and I have overcome the world it was God
[1:21:57] in Me no no no no God chose not in
[1:22:00] Hebrews 11 to list all of their faults
[1:22:03] my brother and sister he talked about
[1:22:05] faith and he talked about their courage
[1:22:08] and he talked about who they were and
[1:22:10] what they were called to do and I find
[1:22:12] myself in Hebrews 11 because I know that
[1:22:15] in spite of my weakness my failure my
[1:22:18] shortcoming God's not listing that
[1:22:20] that's a devil that's listening that
[1:22:22] it's God that's listing what's good
[1:22:25] about me what's beautiful and what's of
[1:22:28] purpose amen and what is there rich and
[1:22:31] mighty
[1:22:32] oh Hallelujah
[1:22:35] you see because it comes down to a time
[1:22:37] this world's not our home
[1:22:39] the culture of their lives
[1:22:41] oh yes as I said already they can go
[1:22:43] back
[1:22:44] they can go back if they wanted to
[1:22:46] now look at this
[1:22:48] I'm gonna do a little jumping around
[1:22:50] here Brothers I want to go over here if
[1:22:53] we'll go forward here to Perfection amen
[1:22:56] that's what we want right
[1:22:58] we're looking for perfection
[1:23:01] then what does that real
[1:23:04] Royal 100 Christian that's born again of
[1:23:08] the spirit of God
[1:23:09] oh look how closely he's identifying
[1:23:12] this he is not leaving one thing to
[1:23:14] doubt here then what does that real
[1:23:16] Royal 100 Christian that's born again of
[1:23:19] the spirit of God whose name was written
[1:23:22] in the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:23:23] foundation of the world who let come let
[1:23:26] go what made they hold to God's
[1:23:29] unchanging hand so this definitive
[1:23:31] description of this individual has one
[1:23:34] thing in common and that is they hold to
[1:23:37] God's unchanging hand
[1:23:39] oh my brother and sister when I was a
[1:23:41] kid we used to go play in the graveyard
[1:23:44] and we would shout and we would run but
[1:23:47] most of our running we were looking over
[1:23:49] our shoulder and most of our shouts was
[1:23:50] to let everybody know we were still
[1:23:52] alive
[1:23:56] but look what God's doing
[1:23:59] he's putting something in the believer
[1:24:01] that he can walk through laodicea
[1:24:05] and he doesn't care
[1:24:08] let me just go on
[1:24:09] what is it in their heart that's
[1:24:12] hungering for something Yonder
[1:24:14] oh for those said the Bible that do so
[1:24:18] plainly confess by their testimony their
[1:24:22] life that they seek a city to come whose
[1:24:24] Builder and maker is gone oh I want my
[1:24:27] life do you want your life to testify
[1:24:30] that I am seeking a city I'm seeking
[1:24:33] something beside becoming rich in
[1:24:35] laodicea the kind of influential and
[1:24:38] laodicea popular in laodicea I'm looking
[1:24:41] for a city
[1:24:43] oh Hallelujah
[1:24:46] and what is that hunger in your heart
[1:24:48] this morning to want to stand in his
[1:24:50] presence what is that hunger in your
[1:24:52] heart this morning the reaching out with
[1:24:55] all that's in you all your soul in your
[1:24:57] life is crying for something to you say
[1:25:00] I don't care what comes and goes
[1:25:04] do you realize now look
[1:25:06] to the UN
[1:25:08] how do I say this
[1:25:10] because it's not like I'm trying to be
[1:25:12] negative on those that aren't
[1:25:14] but maybe of those that are overly
[1:25:17] ambitious
[1:25:19] you know that can be almost as much as
[1:25:20] the curse is not being ambitious at all
[1:25:24] I mean it can actually come back and
[1:25:25] haunt you
[1:25:26] just talking to a brother the other day
[1:25:28] and he made a comment to me
[1:25:30] and I said brother
[1:25:31] I looked him right in the face
[1:25:33] I said brother
[1:25:35] I think even your garage is OCD
[1:25:41] and his wife just
[1:25:44] I didn't even need a comment out of him
[1:25:48] thank you sister
[1:25:51] being an overachiever
[1:25:54] can be almost as much as a curse as
[1:25:57] being an under
[1:26:00] Neath we need balance in all things
[1:26:03] and as the Holy Ghost brings balance in
[1:26:05] our lives then we're able to come and
[1:26:08] there is if you don't mind me putting it
[1:26:10] this way there is a hunger in the human
[1:26:13] for certain things I know people that
[1:26:15] could sit for Endless hours on the River
[1:26:18] Bank casting a hook out in the water not
[1:26:21] catch or even get a single nibble and it
[1:26:24] would come back tomorrow and do it again
[1:26:26] and I know men that if they are there
[1:26:28] and after 30 minutes something hasn't
[1:26:31] nibbled on their line no we're either
[1:26:32] moving to a different spot or we're
[1:26:34] going home and it's there my brother and
[1:26:36] sister that you'll find the different
[1:26:38] Natures the different hungers that
[1:26:40] people I have seen men amen that would
[1:26:43] climb to the peak of the mount sweat and
[1:26:46] and be a break where they slip in the
[1:26:49] rocks and do whatever just for the sight
[1:26:51] of an elk
[1:26:54] rump going over the ridge
[1:26:57] and come home and say did you have a
[1:26:59] good hunting trip brother yes
[1:27:03] where's the rack
[1:27:04] on the mountain
[1:27:06] still living
[1:27:08] but I saw him
[1:27:09] at eleven thousand feet
[1:27:12] what are you doing at 11 000 feet that's
[1:27:14] where airplanes go
[1:27:16] but you see there's a hunger in them to
[1:27:18] do this
[1:27:19] now I hope you can catch where I'm going
[1:27:22] there's a hunger in us to attain natural
[1:27:25] thanks
[1:27:27] oh how much greater the hunger should be
[1:27:30] for us for the spiritual things of God a
[1:27:34] hunger that we can just see ourselves oh
[1:27:36] I I used to get in trouble in school all
[1:27:38] the time I fortunately I had some
[1:27:40] teachers they were experienced they knew
[1:27:42] what was happening and so you know Mrs
[1:27:44] Gerke English teacher she used to say
[1:27:46] okay Paul what's today's daydream about
[1:27:51] oh I don't know I mean I no go ahead
[1:27:54] tell me I'm not going to criticize you
[1:27:56] you're already gonna have to write I
[1:27:58] will not stare out the window 500 times
[1:28:00] so just share with me
[1:28:03] because it was that nature
[1:28:06] I didn't care I had no hunger
[1:28:08] for prepositions and you all notice that
[1:28:13] I know how to structure a sentence it
[1:28:14] starts with a capital letter and has a
[1:28:16] period on the end that's how you
[1:28:18] structure a sentence
[1:28:22] but you see
[1:28:23] I want to drive this home
[1:28:26] while we don't think it's obvious
[1:28:28] not only is it obvious to God but it's
[1:28:31] obvious around
[1:28:32] what we're hungry
[1:28:34] what is it we're hungry
[1:28:36] I say Lord let it be obvious what we're
[1:28:40] hungering for let it not be confused
[1:28:43] where people want to know is he really
[1:28:44] excited or is it part of this but let it
[1:28:47] be so obvious my brother and sister but
[1:28:49] the prophet of God I just read yesterday
[1:28:51] the prophet of God says what happens is
[1:28:53] when people are that way they start
[1:28:54] calling them fanatics
[1:28:57] so do we want to be mainstream or do we
[1:28:59] want to be fanatics
[1:29:01] if a fanatic gets me into heaven I want
[1:29:04] to be a fanatic if mainstream gets me
[1:29:07] into the ballpark
[1:29:09] you can take that two-way ballpark
[1:29:11] meaning the phrase close
[1:29:14] or
[1:29:16] whoopee ballpark
[1:29:19] would we want to settle for just being
[1:29:21] in the ballpark
[1:29:22] no sir see there's something about the
[1:29:25] expression now I find it interesting
[1:29:27] that brother Brown was preaching about
[1:29:29] Hungary in the sermon perfection
[1:29:31] right because it is my brother and
[1:29:34] sister what we're hungering for amen and
[1:29:37] what is it come on
[1:29:39] what made they hold to God's unchanging
[1:29:41] hand what's in their heart that's
[1:29:42] hungering for something Yonder for those
[1:29:44] said the Bible that do so plainly
[1:29:46] confess by their testimony in their life
[1:29:48] that they seek a city to come whose
[1:29:50] Builder and maker is gone what is that
[1:29:52] hunger in your heart this morning to
[1:29:55] want to stand in his presence what is
[1:29:57] that hunger in your heart this morning
[1:29:58] the reaching out with all that's in you
[1:30:02] all your soul and all your life is
[1:30:04] crying for something till you say I
[1:30:06] don't care what comes and goes I want to
[1:30:09] say my brother and sister is that where
[1:30:11] we're at and if we're not there let's
[1:30:14] just press into this let's press into
[1:30:16] the hunger of being there that we don't
[1:30:19] care what comes and goes we just want
[1:30:22] more of Jesus Christ
[1:30:24] Hallelujah let it not be some kind of
[1:30:26] church Mantra but let it be something
[1:30:28] moving and stirring in the soul of Sons
[1:30:31] and Daughters of God that we identify
[1:30:34] with Jesus Christ first and everything
[1:30:36] else comes afterwards
[1:30:39] now I want to take you back brother
[1:30:41] Joshua you'll take me there or brother
[1:30:43] Mason to Hebrews 11.
[1:30:46] verses 36 through 40.
[1:30:48] and uh look at this
[1:30:51] where do we stand here Saints
[1:30:54] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[1:30:56] and scourgings Yea moreover of bonds and
[1:30:59] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[1:31:01] sauna sunder were tempted
[1:31:06] now I want to interject this to you
[1:31:09] because we're not tied to logs and
[1:31:11] throwed to the Hogs
[1:31:13] and we're not thrown from the bridges to
[1:31:14] the Rocks below
[1:31:16] and we're not sawing asunder
[1:31:19] but you'll notice
[1:31:21] temptation
[1:31:22] was considered persecution
[1:31:27] simple
[1:31:28] Temptation now the devil changes tactics
[1:31:31] now as it were men would go to prison
[1:31:37] men would be charged with crimes for
[1:31:39] such things
[1:31:42] that you will not find a single
[1:31:44] indictment
[1:31:46] for temptation
[1:31:48] the devil has free reign
[1:31:55] I'm just going to get right down on the
[1:31:56] rubber on the road today Saints
[1:31:58] you walk in the grocery store on a
[1:32:00] simply task that would not be considered
[1:32:02] anything but normal and you go right in
[1:32:05] there and Satan has set the stage for
[1:32:07] temptation to stand in the grocery store
[1:32:10] and it goes both ways for men and women
[1:32:12] and so you go you set about to just
[1:32:15] simply go to the post office or whatever
[1:32:17] it might be and Satan has set Temptation
[1:32:20] in front of you not a single law against
[1:32:22] it
[1:32:25] he has free reign
[1:32:31] and we'll look at that
[1:32:34] and see
[1:32:37] and they were slain with a sword and
[1:32:38] they wandered about in sheepskins and
[1:32:40] goat skins being destitute afflicted
[1:32:43] no law
[1:32:45] against affliction
[1:32:48] and no law
[1:32:49] against torment
[1:32:52] of whom the worthy world was not worthy
[1:32:54] they wandered in deserts and in
[1:32:56] mountains in the dens and the caves of
[1:32:58] the earth and in the big cities and the
[1:33:00] little cities in the countryside
[1:33:03] in Idaho and Oregon and wherever else
[1:33:06] you can remember
[1:33:09] and the word says
[1:33:11] they were not worthy of these people
[1:33:14] right you wonder why the world doesn't
[1:33:16] like you my brother and sister because
[1:33:18] you are such a contrast to the anointing
[1:33:20] that is upon them that they look at you
[1:33:22] almost as though you are an armed enemy
[1:33:25] because in the spirit realm you are
[1:33:28] the spirit that is in them has a
[1:33:30] conflict with you where they can come to
[1:33:32] the place where they instantly uh do not
[1:33:36] like you they're instantly bothered by
[1:33:38] your presence they're instantly
[1:33:39] aggressive they're instantly rude all of
[1:33:42] these things and you say why did that
[1:33:43] person do to me because this is not
[1:33:45] about Flesh and Blood this is about
[1:33:47] principalities and powers of darkness
[1:33:49] and it's time my brother and sister that
[1:33:52] we grasp the idea that the devil really
[1:33:54] doesn't like us
[1:33:57] it's time for us to get back we've been
[1:34:00] trying to be friends with the devil you
[1:34:02] know kind of like they say in the
[1:34:03] country good fences make good neighbors
[1:34:05] the devil don't care how good your fence
[1:34:07] is he hates you anyhow
[1:34:11] amen and you see what he's doing
[1:34:14] and these all having obtained a good
[1:34:16] report through faith received not the
[1:34:18] promise
[1:34:19] God having provided some better thing
[1:34:22] who's the US here Saints
[1:34:24] yeah we're the US
[1:34:27] amen don't point it off to somewhere
[1:34:29] else don't put it off to this great
[1:34:31] preacher and that great family it's
[1:34:33] great no my brother and sister we are
[1:34:35] the US God having provided some better
[1:34:38] thing for us that they without us should
[1:34:40] not be made perfect now you know there's
[1:34:43] several different ways you can analyze
[1:34:45] this and because that's the way I
[1:34:46] approach things I like to break it down
[1:34:48] I like to see what Webster's got to say
[1:34:50] in the diet go out and different things
[1:34:52] about this my brother and sister that
[1:34:54] they without us are not made perfect so
[1:34:56] you can look at it we'll take this one
[1:34:58] first that they without us are not
[1:35:00] complete in other words the puzzle needs
[1:35:02] one last piece
[1:35:03] and we're the peace and they are the
[1:35:05] puzzle of righteousness and Holiness so
[1:35:07] the last piece must be righteousness and
[1:35:10] Holiness amen for us to be plugged in
[1:35:13] that for it to be perfect but there's
[1:35:15] also another sign of it my brother and
[1:35:17] sister that God chose this age and he
[1:35:19] said in this age will be the completion
[1:35:21] of the Fulfillment of the revelation of
[1:35:24] the mystery of Jesus Christ and it's in
[1:35:26] that and God said it's going to take a
[1:35:28] special person to bring that word and
[1:35:31] it's going to take a special person to
[1:35:33] receive that word amen and so they
[1:35:36] without us come down to the place that
[1:35:39] someone's got to be standing there
[1:35:40] receiving the fullness of the revelation
[1:35:43] of Jesus Christ but when we receive
[1:35:46] fullness God gives credit all the way
[1:35:49] back through time and says my bride he
[1:35:53] doesn't say just a bride of this age or
[1:35:54] bride of that age but it's his bride and
[1:35:57] when we called of God right we were
[1:36:00] called to Philadelphia to Ephesus we
[1:36:02] want to call back to the those days we
[1:36:04] were called now we were called to stand
[1:36:06] here today and God said it's for those
[1:36:09] that will come and I will make them all
[1:36:11] perfect with these that I place in this
[1:36:14] day and pour my spirit in poor
[1:36:16] Revelation the fullness of the mystery
[1:36:19] up that into them and when they receive
[1:36:22] this word because they are the word and
[1:36:25] something in them has such a hunger such
[1:36:28] a desire I've got to is life easy I'll
[1:36:32] tell you no life is not easy there are
[1:36:35] trials there are Temptations but others
[1:36:37] say I've done enough I've heard enough
[1:36:39] I've seen enough I'm done
[1:36:42] and you get down and say oh God help me
[1:36:45] help me Lord as Peter was Lord Jesus
[1:36:49] save me oh because there's something in
[1:36:52] us that brings us and what is this my
[1:36:55] brother and sister it's not anything
[1:36:57] that we said or done it's not anything
[1:36:59] that we could do but what happened you
[1:37:01] say well do you see visions
[1:37:04] depends on what you want to call a
[1:37:06] victim
[1:37:07] I see visions
[1:37:09] I See Vision Saints God's opened my eyes
[1:37:13] to see the supernatural of revealed word
[1:37:16] and in that I see the vision of who I am
[1:37:19] in Jesus Christ I need to see a vision
[1:37:22] of an event or a time or a place I just
[1:37:24] need to see who I am and you just need
[1:37:27] to see who you are oh I should included
[1:37:31] that quote now I wish I would have me
[1:37:33] you know the quote when the prophet of
[1:37:34] God says when the church sees who she is
[1:37:37] and then behind that she will
[1:37:41] oh Hallelujah I'm saying we're in the
[1:37:44] season of she will she has she is
[1:37:49] oh look at this my brother and sister
[1:37:51] why because our Focus has shifted from
[1:37:55] oh
[1:37:58] I don't mean this offensive
[1:38:00] our Focus has shifted
[1:38:04] from the message
[1:38:07] to Jesus Christ
[1:38:11] scripture says all that says they're
[1:38:13] Jews
[1:38:14] are not Jews
[1:38:17] I think I'll leave that there
[1:38:19] some people find that offensive
[1:38:21] I'm sorry my brother and sister
[1:38:24] I know Mormons that believe brother
[1:38:26] Branham was a prophet amen
[1:38:29] what
[1:38:30] because he fits every criteria the
[1:38:34] Mormon church has
[1:38:36] for a prophet
[1:38:39] but who do they quote
[1:38:46] oh Hallelujah
[1:38:50] yeah
[1:38:52] now look at this
[1:38:54] God having provided
[1:38:56] some better thing for us
[1:38:58] that they without us should not be made
[1:39:00] perfect now look some better things for
[1:39:03] us people say you think I've had a
[1:39:05] person that says that message believer
[1:39:07] say this to me
[1:39:08] you think they were saying this you
[1:39:11] might say critical you think that we
[1:39:14] have more
[1:39:16] than they had
[1:39:18] and they say that in a sense of almost
[1:39:20] like you think
[1:39:22] we have more than they have
[1:39:25] I can't really explain it all to you
[1:39:27] Saints and I can't really find the right
[1:39:28] words but yes I do
[1:39:30] and you know why I do because my Bible
[1:39:33] told me so
[1:39:35] um
[1:39:36] do we make a Doctrine out of it and
[1:39:38] we've got a big banner raised up you
[1:39:39] know that like Grace Tabernacle is
[1:39:40] better than everybody else no sorry we
[1:39:42] go just the opposite lift everyone
[1:39:44] around you compliment and love everyone
[1:39:46] around you why because that's what the
[1:39:47] prophet taught us through the word amen
[1:39:50] not to make ourselves hidey and
[1:39:52] high-minded amen see you see we've been
[1:39:55] re blessed my brother and sister to
[1:39:57] receive the final voice
[1:40:00] all right amen absolutely oh somebody
[1:40:03] interpret that final voice for me
[1:40:06] it depends on how you come about that
[1:40:08] because in a way I would say there's no
[1:40:10] wrong answer
[1:40:11] a final voice has been a prophet
[1:40:15] of our day
[1:40:16] an Elijah Ministry they're coming broke
[1:40:20] the bread for us and you notice they
[1:40:23] didn't have to run down to Eddie's
[1:40:24] Bakery and get more bread
[1:40:28] we didn't have to reinvent the message
[1:40:31] to get it to fit our marriages Our lives
[1:40:35] our children and us as individuals
[1:40:38] that bread just keeps being broken amen
[1:40:41] it just keeps coming
[1:40:43] have you ever I know you have because
[1:40:45] I've heard you confess it but you know
[1:40:47] you're going through a little something
[1:40:48] in life and you say you know Lord I need
[1:40:50] a little encouragement and you'll either
[1:40:52] pick up a book or tape and there's your
[1:40:54] answer
[1:40:56] my oh my what happened the master come
[1:41:00] and just broke a piece off the loaf and
[1:41:04] handed it to you oh hallelujah thank you
[1:41:07] Lord he's still breaking bread for us
[1:41:11] oh my oh my oh my now look we want to
[1:41:14] just kind of come to the place of um uh
[1:41:17] do we think we have more than they did
[1:41:20] and I come to the place that I'm going
[1:41:22] to say right now that it's in the word
[1:41:24] right amen that he had something special
[1:41:28] for us that's what the word says now
[1:41:30] let's just go right in here to Jehovah
[1:41:33] Jireh amen
[1:41:37] and let's let's look at this
[1:41:40] but Mary when the angel met her she
[1:41:43] didn't doubt God
[1:41:44] said behold the handmaid of the Lord be
[1:41:46] it unto me according to Thy word that's
[1:41:49] an amen
[1:41:50] for those of you who don't know how to
[1:41:51] read between these lines that right
[1:41:53] there is an amen
[1:41:55] and never was there anything like that
[1:41:57] done before
[1:41:59] that's it
[1:42:01] you mean we don't have to go to prove
[1:42:04] the revealed word of the hour by taking
[1:42:08] it back
[1:42:10] had a brother talking to him on the
[1:42:12] phone the other day and he said brother
[1:42:13] Paul he says you'd be surprised what an
[1:42:15] uproar it can be when someone in your
[1:42:18] church that you thought was solid
[1:42:21] and says you can't preach on that
[1:42:23] because brother Branham never even
[1:42:24] mentioned that scripture ever once on
[1:42:27] tape
[1:42:29] oh
[1:42:30] I don't know if I'll have much Bible
[1:42:31] left
[1:42:34] because it's only a matter of time the
[1:42:35] next one will come along
[1:42:41] I've read my Bible cover to cover in a
[1:42:44] single day
[1:42:45] their Bibles about that thick
[1:42:48] because they've limited eliminated this
[1:42:50] that hurt this that corrected and this
[1:42:53] that offended their mama and that
[1:42:55] offended their granny and this offended
[1:42:56] their children and pretty soon they got
[1:42:58] no Bible at all
[1:43:00] right but you see some would never dare
[1:43:02] desecrate their Bible that way
[1:43:05] but they have
[1:43:11] she just took God at his word
[1:43:14] right she did oh let me get back where
[1:43:16] it was there never was anything like
[1:43:18] that done before so she's on new Turf
[1:43:20] man I mean somebody's going to say
[1:43:21] there's something wrong with you girl
[1:43:23] and if we think we've had persecution I
[1:43:26] wonder what we would think of what Mary
[1:43:28] went through
[1:43:29] I don't mean to be crass
[1:43:31] but she
[1:43:33] started
[1:43:35] showing it
[1:43:40] she started showing in her flesh she had
[1:43:44] come face to face with God Amen it was
[1:43:49] not a theological thought it was a real
[1:43:52] actual event taking place in her body
[1:43:56] and it changed her forever
[1:43:58] oh Hallelujah
[1:44:01] oh amen she didn't question she didn't
[1:44:05] reason she just took God at his word and
[1:44:08] went along rejoicing telling people she
[1:44:10] was going to have a baby knowing no man
[1:44:13] and when that had never been done before
[1:44:17] oh wouldn't it be fine if all these
[1:44:19] Mary's here tonight would take that kind
[1:44:21] of an attitude wouldn't it be wonderful
[1:44:23] if all the people would take that
[1:44:25] attitude don't question
[1:44:28] God's just going to be rough with you
[1:44:30] Saints not rough with you but my brother
[1:44:32] and sister that is a spirit that is
[1:44:35] coming in the message you see people
[1:44:36] that are leaving they are there quitting
[1:44:39] people still in church but they say well
[1:44:41] like they do about the Bible I believe
[1:44:43] this is inspired I don't believe this is
[1:44:45] inspired do you believe this and then
[1:44:47] others radically the other way
[1:44:49] everything brother Branham said is
[1:44:51] inspired well my brother and sister I
[1:44:54] want to tell you you've got to find the
[1:44:56] balance in the middle of all of this
[1:44:57] because if you start questioning you
[1:45:00] will find the questions never end
[1:45:02] you will find you will question yourself
[1:45:04] right out of serving God
[1:45:06] amen and you can go the other way and
[1:45:09] get so radically consumed into it that
[1:45:12] you come oh I tell you sorry to put it
[1:45:15] to you this way but I got a friend
[1:45:16] that's a pastor of a church and had a
[1:45:18] family leave his church because when he
[1:45:20] would read a quote like this they'd he
[1:45:22] didn't give the uh uh
[1:45:28] now tell me what they're focused on
[1:45:31] every word is Anointed
[1:45:35] Lord forgive me I don't mean to make
[1:45:36] light
[1:45:37] but what does a uh uh uh mean
[1:45:44] you see my brother and sister we got to
[1:45:46] have a balance
[1:45:48] we're going to find that balance
[1:45:51] and I've got to find a balance and cut
[1:45:52] this off somewhere
[1:45:54] amen she just took all his word wouldn't
[1:45:57] it be fine all the Mary's would do this
[1:45:58] don't question if God so says so that
[1:46:01] settles it that's all that settle as if
[1:46:04] God said so that makes it right now he's
[1:46:06] the final voice on all
[1:46:10] what's the final voice
[1:46:12] come on people all get called up no it's
[1:46:15] a final voice the prophet that they're
[1:46:17] saying is that absolute is saying that
[1:46:21] God is absolute amen saying that it's
[1:46:25] God that is the final voice and if God
[1:46:28] said so that makes it right now he's the
[1:46:30] final voice on all authority has all the
[1:46:32] authority of everything God has the
[1:46:34] supreme authority
[1:46:37] and I'm going to take it this way
[1:46:39] because I believe you have a balance my
[1:46:41] brother and sister when God come down
[1:46:43] and he put the word of God in a
[1:46:45] prophet's voice and his heart I mean as
[1:46:47] it is that he's studying I was just
[1:46:49] reading and he says now I was fixing to
[1:46:52] preach this talking about in the seals
[1:46:54] and vials and whatnot I was fixing to
[1:46:57] preach this and as I was going getting
[1:46:59] prepared to go out to do this the Lord
[1:47:01] told me don't
[1:47:03] that's it
[1:47:06] because you already preached it
[1:47:08] in The Sixth Seal supernaturally
[1:47:13] wow
[1:47:16] what if God hadn't intervened
[1:47:19] he would have come out and tried to
[1:47:20] explain it all
[1:47:22] out of this when God had already
[1:47:24] anointed it in the word to be revealed
[1:47:27] oh no I know it sounds like I'm a critic
[1:47:30] but just trust me I'm not
[1:47:32] I just believe what the supernatural has
[1:47:36] declared
[1:47:39] amen
[1:47:40] so as we look here I want to hurry along
[1:47:42] here
[1:47:43] see man that man's idea of perfect
[1:47:46] I don't know I wouldn't want to put
[1:47:48] anybody on the spot but we'll all have a
[1:47:50] different idea of what is perfect
[1:47:54] yeah
[1:47:56] it's kind of like this
[1:47:58] I'll use a very simple analogy
[1:48:03] man cuts a board 80 inches long
[1:48:06] he looks at that board
[1:48:08] tape on it perfect
[1:48:11] another man like some of you I mean
[1:48:14] people
[1:48:16] stretches the tape on there
[1:48:19] and says um
[1:48:21] that's seven feet 11 inches and 99 99
[1:48:25] thousandths
[1:48:29] it's not 80 inches
[1:48:37] I farm with GPS
[1:48:42] yesterday I was betting wheat ground
[1:48:45] it told me all through the day
[1:48:47] everything is perfect
[1:48:49] that my rows were within a whole inch
[1:48:53] of what I desired for him
[1:48:57] sister April what happens when you only
[1:48:58] get within an inch
[1:49:05] I think my rows are perfect
[1:49:10] yeah
[1:49:12] see our idea of what perfect is
[1:49:14] is irrelevant
[1:49:17] God has the idea of what Perfection is
[1:49:22] yes so you see our idea of perfect in
[1:49:24] God's idea perfect amen we're looking
[1:49:28] for a man with no flaws I haven't found
[1:49:30] him yet sorry Brothers
[1:49:32] but I haven't found him yet but God's
[1:49:34] looking a Flawless God is looking for a
[1:49:37] submitted man
[1:49:39] he doesn't need the perfect man he needs
[1:49:41] a submitted man because he's a perfect
[1:49:43] God and so when we let a perfect God
[1:49:46] into our life with no hindrance and
[1:49:48] fully submit to him God looks down on
[1:49:51] our life which we see mistakes others
[1:49:53] see mistakes and God says I see
[1:49:55] Perfection because I see a submitted
[1:49:58] soul I see a man who's willing to let me
[1:50:01] do what I want to do and when that man
[1:50:04] will allow me to do what I want to do I
[1:50:07] will use him to fulfill my word and you
[1:50:10] are fulfilling his word today Saints oh
[1:50:12] forgive me for yelling I'm just excited
[1:50:15] amen what is it it's also a perfect is
[1:50:18] to coming into maturity
[1:50:20] see you cannot Harvest imperfect wheat
[1:50:25] so what is imperfect wheat can be a lot
[1:50:27] of things but it could come down to just
[1:50:29] simply immaturity
[1:50:34] people are like why did that I've had
[1:50:36] people ask me this brothers and sisters
[1:50:38] that come from big cities we we were you
[1:50:41] know flying over you know Montana
[1:50:44] and we looked out the window and here's
[1:50:46] these columbines and they've left all
[1:50:48] these spots down in the bottom
[1:50:51] the bottom they never harvested and they
[1:50:53] went on left it is there something wrong
[1:50:56] with that weed
[1:50:57] it all saw them yeah
[1:51:01] something very terribly wrong with it
[1:51:03] really
[1:51:04] yeah it's called immaturity
[1:51:09] now I want to ask you this is a little
[1:51:10] personal y'all don't look at each other
[1:51:11] okay just all look straight ahead no
[1:51:14] Taps on knees or nothing
[1:51:20] you all know some immature people don't
[1:51:22] you
[1:51:26] Brother David quit being a spoiler
[1:51:30] because I know you're not going to look
[1:51:31] over at sister Diane
[1:51:38] do you know that immaturity Satan can
[1:51:41] anoint that
[1:51:42] to be a stumbling Stone
[1:51:47] because someone would see someone else
[1:51:49] and it seems like God's answering their
[1:51:51] prayers
[1:51:52] see it's like God's doing this God's
[1:51:55] moving
[1:51:56] people can come to the place they
[1:51:59] actually I I can't remember the word
[1:52:01] just passed over my mind there
[1:52:04] um
[1:52:05] envious they become a little bitter
[1:52:09] towards people like who do they think
[1:52:11] they are
[1:52:14] stand still
[1:52:17] and let the sun move
[1:52:21] he'll burn
[1:52:23] be careful what you ask for
[1:52:25] you know I always get that humor I've
[1:52:26] said it many times here brother Jewel I
[1:52:28] do not pray for patience
[1:52:30] don't worry about it brother Jewel
[1:52:31] patient's going to come to you whether
[1:52:32] you like it or not
[1:52:34] amen
[1:52:35] but the thing is
[1:52:37] we've got to lay in the presence
[1:52:39] God's not going to take you out and
[1:52:41] stick you in an oven somewhere and just
[1:52:43] burn you
[1:52:45] he's going to let you lay in the
[1:52:47] presence of the Sun
[1:52:49] I prayed and prayed and prayed and
[1:52:52] prayed for an answer
[1:52:56] the make-believer unbeliever says God
[1:52:58] doesn't hear my voice and they walk away
[1:53:00] the real believer says Lord answer I
[1:53:03] know you said you would you hear my
[1:53:05] prayer You Hear My Cry Lord I need to
[1:53:08] hear from you and then God comes and
[1:53:10] lays it in the word and says Be Still
[1:53:12] be still and know that I am God
[1:53:17] Lord help us be still
[1:53:20] oh because you see we have a supreme
[1:53:22] authority Saints okay let me come let me
[1:53:25] come here amen I've got to hurry along
[1:53:27] here
[1:53:31] God's intention for his creation man
[1:53:34] is to express his words
[1:53:37] that alone could stand all by itself it
[1:53:40] doesn't need any other explanation with
[1:53:42] it in Genesis Adam was given the word to
[1:53:44] live by a life lived by the word would
[1:53:47] be the word expressed
[1:53:51] now we serve a God that changes not same
[1:53:54] yesterday today and forever so that
[1:53:57] right there speaking about in Genesis is
[1:54:00] applying to you and I right now right
[1:54:02] here today
[1:54:03] and life live by the word would be the
[1:54:05] word expressed that is true is it not
[1:54:08] but did Adam live by that word no
[1:54:11] because he was to live by
[1:54:14] every word
[1:54:16] now in my defense Church in my defense
[1:54:20] I'd like to speak to the jury
[1:54:22] you wonder why brother Paul Harps about
[1:54:24] those people
[1:54:25] that just twist
[1:54:28] one word
[1:54:34] I showed that to brother Sergey the
[1:54:36] other day I can't even remember the
[1:54:38] exact words myself
[1:54:41] to add one word
[1:54:45] to the truth
[1:54:47] is to take
[1:54:49] a word away
[1:54:54] I would never take anything from the
[1:54:56] word yeah you did
[1:54:59] because you added something to it
[1:55:01] so you water down you know the
[1:55:03] government says it was necessary for us
[1:55:05] to add a couple trillion in new cash
[1:55:08] into the market
[1:55:12] they added but what did it do
[1:55:14] took away
[1:55:16] your dollar went from being worth 89
[1:55:18] cents to 81 cents
[1:55:21] but they had it no they took away
[1:55:26] that's what the devil does amen
[1:55:30] amen every word and he failed to take
[1:55:32] heed to every word then there are rose
[1:55:34] Moses what a great mighty man he was yet
[1:55:37] he also failed to live by every word and
[1:55:39] that Prophet the type of the great
[1:55:41] prophet to come failed in Anger to obey
[1:55:45] the word oh God help us never to be
[1:55:47] angry amen and there was also David the
[1:55:49] great king of Israel man after God's Own
[1:55:51] Heart but he failed by adultery and when
[1:55:54] he was tempted but eventually in the
[1:55:57] fullness of time there come one the head
[1:56:00] even Jesus who also must be tempted to
[1:56:04] see if he would live by every word oh my
[1:56:07] brother and sister we say oh praise the
[1:56:10] Lord I got a spirit of love but Jesus
[1:56:12] overcome love I can do this but do you
[1:56:15] realize my brother and sister that God
[1:56:17] was not just putting that out for you
[1:56:19] and I to see this oh I I have a temper
[1:56:22] Lord help me Jesus overcome a temper I
[1:56:25] can do this too my brother and sister do
[1:56:27] you realize God was proving that flesh
[1:56:32] could bear every word
[1:56:37] or we could say well as of course Jesus
[1:56:41] no no he wasn't testing Jesus he was
[1:56:43] testing flesh
[1:56:45] proving our flesh
[1:56:48] following the recipe of the word can
[1:56:52] overcome amen every temptation
[1:56:55] so look at this now
[1:56:58] failed in Anger there's also David king
[1:57:00] of Israel man after God's Own Heart
[1:57:02] failed by adultery when he was tempted
[1:57:04] but eventually in the fullness of time
[1:57:06] now that's why I had to go back do you
[1:57:08] realize what the fullness of time is my
[1:57:10] brother and sister
[1:57:11] I cannot go back and say I'm going to
[1:57:14] live I'm going to study every word that
[1:57:16] Paul preached and I'm going to stay only
[1:57:18] on what Paul preached
[1:57:21] well he preached the word didn't he he
[1:57:24] preached truth
[1:57:26] but did he reveal
[1:57:27] the mystery
[1:57:34] he spoke the words
[1:57:36] see there's the little key
[1:57:39] he spoke it
[1:57:41] but he didn't
[1:57:43] reveal it
[1:57:46] you needed someone to take the spoken
[1:57:49] word
[1:57:49] and bring it out in such a fashion that
[1:57:53] you see God didn't bring it by education
[1:57:54] or explanation he brought it by
[1:57:57] Revelation and that's the special key
[1:58:00] element we were talking about earlier
[1:58:01] that I've got something greater for you
[1:58:04] because he was not going to come down
[1:58:05] just anoint one man as a messenger to
[1:58:08] the word right prophet of God I can't
[1:58:10] replace him I can't be and man would I
[1:58:12] not want to have been him but I tell you
[1:58:14] what it is my brother and sister it
[1:58:16] didn't stay a one-man Ministry
[1:58:19] it become a revelation to the whole body
[1:58:23] of Christ to the bride it became
[1:58:26] Revelation to her that each one could
[1:58:29] come and I say could go to Africa it
[1:58:33] could go to Antarctica to South America
[1:58:35] to China to wherever and the same
[1:58:38] Revelation is present
[1:58:41] amen they heard a voice
[1:58:44] that voice was alive it was speaking
[1:58:48] oh come on
[1:58:50] amen but eventually in the fullness of
[1:58:54] time coming as time is closing fullness
[1:58:56] means full time has come to the fullness
[1:58:58] of this and it's coming down and what is
[1:59:00] happening there the mystery
[1:59:03] by Revelation is revealed
[1:59:06] we all had to go to the mystery
[1:59:09] Resource Center
[1:59:13] you can take that two ways we did have
[1:59:14] to go to the mystery Resource Center
[1:59:16] but we don't have a Mecca
[1:59:21] hmm gotta hurry
[1:59:24] must be tempted to see if he would live
[1:59:26] by every word that proceeded out of the
[1:59:27] mouth of God let's go right along here
[1:59:29] hurry fastball then with Satan Foyle
[1:59:32] look isn't that awesome I say thank you
[1:59:34] Lord we finally got the recipe through
[1:59:37] all the ages that foiled Satan and for
[1:59:40] here was one who lived by it is written
[1:59:43] I hope this changes your perspective of
[1:59:45] when you hear the preacher preach about
[1:59:47] it is written because it was not just
[1:59:49] hey we're going to mimic Jesus this was
[1:59:52] a revelation of overcoming power and to
[1:59:56] unlock the key and the power power come
[1:59:58] out and any son or daughter of God who
[2:00:01] operates that key in sincerity can
[2:00:04] unleash that power amen and so there it
[2:00:07] is you want to foil Satan release the
[2:00:10] power for him is one who lived by it is
[2:00:13] written in the Masterpiece of God
[2:00:14] overcome by
[2:00:17] preaching a new message
[2:00:20] no
[2:00:22] reflecting
[2:00:25] oh
[2:00:26] have you ever watched them solar panels
[2:00:28] that move with the Sun
[2:00:29] pretty cool
[2:00:31] you're sitting there and you're like
[2:00:32] that just moved
[2:00:34] but you can't prove it moved because
[2:00:36] it's not moving when you finally looked
[2:00:37] at it
[2:00:38] and then it moves again
[2:00:40] and pretty soon you find yourself
[2:00:41] fascinated just staring at that thing
[2:00:44] waiting for it to move
[2:00:50] and finally it did
[2:00:52] only it didn't move near as much as we
[2:00:54] thought it should
[2:00:57] you're God's reflector
[2:01:00] yeah
[2:01:01] and I watched you and I know you're
[2:01:03] moving
[2:01:05] and as a minister I think they should
[2:01:07] have moved more
[2:01:10] but God's in control
[2:01:12] because when the reflector is following
[2:01:14] the sun it doesn't care what the
[2:01:17] spectator thinks
[2:01:20] it's following the sun that's it
[2:01:27] foreign
[2:01:30] given to the Cross as the perfect Lamb
[2:01:33] of God for the perfect sacrifice and on
[2:01:35] the tree he received the wounds unto
[2:01:36] death that we by him and because of him
[2:01:39] might eat of the tree of life and then
[2:01:42] that life really given when enable us to
[2:01:45] overcome and express the word of God
[2:01:48] isn't that so beautiful
[2:01:51] now look at this we'll finish this off
[2:01:53] sister will you come and now these sons
[2:01:55] have gone who by him overcome are given
[2:01:59] the privilege of the paradise of God and
[2:02:01] the constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ
[2:02:04] there will never be any separation from
[2:02:08] him whether he goeth his bride will go
[2:02:13] what is his he shares with his beloved
[2:02:16] on a joint air relationship now catch
[2:02:20] this next line
[2:02:21] the secret things
[2:02:24] will be revealed
[2:02:28] um
[2:02:29] why do you think you understand I don't
[2:02:32] see it that way it's never been revealed
[2:02:34] to me I don't know why it's not for me
[2:02:38] to say but I do know as his bride
[2:02:41] he's been talking to me

[2:03:24] something or I thought something Lord
[2:03:26] forgive me and then I'm reminded his
[2:03:29] Perfection is different than my
[2:03:31] perfection he is not looking at me
[2:03:34] through my eyes he's looking at me
[2:03:36] through his eyes and the prophet of God
[2:03:38] said when he looks at us through his
[2:03:40] eyes he's actually looking through the
[2:03:41] blood
[2:03:42] and all he can see is the blood

[2:04:19] by heavenly vision and not a church
[2:04:21] Revelation it's not a man's idea but
[2:04:25] it's God himself coming down and
[2:04:27] revealing himself because there is
[2:04:29] something greater been left for us in
[2:04:32] this hour and that is to walk in the
[2:04:34] fullness of the revelation of Jesus
