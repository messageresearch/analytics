if I could I just wanted to read a scripture if that's okay I was just reading this a few days ago when it touched me Psalm 91 I think it's very fitting for what we're going through yeah Psalm 91 verse 1 and it says he did wealth in a secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of all of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him I will trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror of night out there by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday at Thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh be only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high the habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague the plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder a young lion and the dragon shall doubt trample under feet because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he had known name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation will Saints legisla Heavenly Father Lord we just come father and we're so thankful father to

babe you're the brain the reason man my god [Music] amens good to be in the house of the Lord today and just to be able to come and worship him once again and while we are not here you might say in the physical body together we are here in the spirit and the Spirit of the Lord to be able to come and worship the Lord together today and I think that's a beautiful beautiful thing the Lord's given us I just want to encourage everyone to follow the website to look for any announcements that would be there so if you are wondering what schedules might be or or anything that would be coming up just go to Grace Nampa dot org obviously if you're streaming you you know that and don't hesitate to call or text prayer requests other needs brother Ivan brother Jason myself just send off a phone call a text something if if you need some help or have a question amen we I talked to a brother George yesterday and as much as we would love to have him come if he did come he would just be speaking to you through the live streaming and so we thought it would be best to have him come when we can enjoy him in person plus it wouldn't be fair of us to impress upon him to have to travel at this time so we're just going to work on having brother George come back when all of this comes back to normal amen god bless you thank you so much this morning amen the challenge of doing things differently is actually good for us I think makes us kind of grow a little bit and so that's that's a wonderful thing amen so God's blessings to each and every one of you Saints we we certainly love you and would prefer to be right here together the this morning but we just take this time and do what the Lord lays upon our hearts and I want to speak to you this morning on these presents distractions and there's a season here that we will find that there's a lot of distraction around us the the world my brother and sister is caught up in all kinds of things we we have people believing declaring that this is this is something the Chinese have done to us but my brother and sister it's not a conspiracy it's not a warfare yet you know a lot of things are going to change it's true they're going to change currencies if they can they're going to take advantage of the people put them back under bondage if they can but my brother and sister to the bride of Jesus Christ this is nothing more than a distraction and the more we focus on that the more we're distracted from something else and so the Word of God will come to pass that's one thing we know for certain I believe we can all say amen to that that the word will come to pass and so these things that we see around us whether they're conspiracy or not is irrelevant the bride has the word she is becoming the word and so as the word is unfolded the bride responds to that and as brother Branham taught us my brother and sister in the sermon I always get the title a little mixed up in the sermon actions as how I always remember it but you know my brother and sister every time that we take a step forward and do an action God brings a reaction you say amen to the word you're saying so be it so then that releases the power of the word you said amen to and and you move forward into that and so that is what a God has called us today so if we would just stand this morning and just respect to God's word want to turn to Joshua 23 1 through 8 and we'll just take our thought from that this morning because just by God's grace we'll we'll just take a little vision here of these present distract and placed these things in the right context for for us amen Joshua 23 verses 1 through 8 and it came to pass a long time after that the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age and Joshua called for all Israel and for the elders their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them I am old and stricken in age and ye have seen all that the Lord your God hath done and to all these nations because of you for the Lord your God is he that hath fought for you behold I have divided unto you by law these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from Jordan with all the nations that I've cut off even unto the Great Sea westward and the Lord your God he shall expel them from before you and drive them out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as the Lord your God has promised unto you be therefore very courageous to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left that G come not among those nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods neither cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them but cleave unto the Lord your God as you have done unto this day Heavenly Father we just ask Lord for blessing upon your word Lord as the Saints are in their homes today father just asked Lord that you would just come and meet them father where they are at father may we be joined in spirit this morning Lord as though we were here in the house of God father - to rejoice to partake father of your word today Lord if the word brings correction Lord let us receive correction as it brings blessing let us rejoice and say Amen to the word father ask for your guiding hand of mercy today in the name of Jesus Christ you may be seated amen you know I'm just looking and then the world we live in today there's you know all kinds of definitions and different online dictionaries and all kinds of interpretations of words but this morning I just want to just take a basic description of the word distract is to take attention away from someone or something and direct it to someone or something else and we look in the world we live in today that certainly Satan is doing his very best to distract us and he is presenting all kinds of things around us now my brother and sister we are human God made us this way so he understands humans and we are here today some might be worried about their economics and some are worried about their health and and all kinds of different things that that is being taken place some you know their jobs are going away because that they can't go to work and some you know it is something else but basically we can look at this and realize that one of Satan's tactics is to distract us from our real job or real calling that God has in or life today and so if we get too distracted too worried about all these things around us we will have a tendency as humans to draw our attention from what it should be place it somewhere else and you know this would be a something of contention maybe and I don't mean it in that sense but my brother and sister most of us would do well to not trying to multitask it's hard to immerse ourself into all of the world and think that we can serve God and still be immersed in the world no my brother and sister we need to focus the scripture doesn't tell us seek you first a good job and then you'll be able to help the church the scripture tells us seek you first the kingdom of God that's our first priority it's the very top it is the climax of what we would be focused on and so as we seek you first the kingdom of God then all of these other things shall be added unto you and so we don't want to try and turn the recipe around we don't want to try and say well Lord in this day it's different two priorities are different my brother and sister God's priorities or God's priorities and they last through the ages so as we look at that let's just I just would call your attention to this that we would not get too caught up by the distractions of this world and make sure we stay focused on what God has called us to these are unprecedented times there is no doubt about that we my brother and sister are seeing incredible things happening as in some cases you might say nerve-racking things that are happening but my brother and sister this is what it is to taste and see the unfolding of the word in our day now no age has ever been easy my brother and sister you look maka the Saints on the day of Pentecost they didn't just have it easy and got the Holy Ghost and went on there was struggle and there was travail the Dark Ages had tremendous struggle and travail and yet the prophet of God points to or brings our attention to the fact that when persecution comes upon the church comes upon the Bride of Christ that that is the time that the church actually flourishes so in weak have a comfort zone we tend to settle into that so we're coming into a time unprecedented time to experience these things but my brother and sister what we're also seeing is the word coming to pass being fulfilled in and you might say a greater fashion or a quicker fashion than ever before because the word will come to pass and so this right here this plague as it would be pandemic they call it of this virus brother and sister I believe is just a foretaste of what is going to befall this earth and so I say thank you Lord and a reason to be focused is because my brother and sister this will become the norm hallelujah it seems extraordinary and unprecedented now but it will become the norm because the scripture says that plague shall come upon the earth in the latter day so we look at this my brother and sister how tremendous this is and I would say because of the technology the internet all of this that most of us by now have heard or seen quotes of brother branham's words concerning germ warfare and these kind of things and and what I want to just touch on this morning my brother and sister is one we see how that these things are coming to pass but you know sometimes it's going to become a reality for it to really affect us in God's provided way of healing brother Branham says here let me pass something here quickly as our times are going listen did you know the Bible predicts in the last days that there'll be a germ warfare so my brother and sister if the Chinese did it if the Russians did it if we did it in the United States meaning my brother and sister it's irrelevant the Bible as brother brown lasers predicts it in the last days so this will happen regardless of who they say is responsible you know everybody says this come from some Chinese guy eating a half cooked bat my brother and sister it doesn't matter what it came from the Bible predicts it to happen so it will come that diseases will break out upon the people and will fall on everyone without the baptism of the holy spirit but with the angel or who had charged over these plagues was given orders to touch no one in whom the mark was why how much kind of teachers why let me go back here why how much kind of teachers have we got to be brethren to get the church in order to be in that condition and I want to put a pause here the church in order to be in that condition immune amen you see the preaching of the word will bring the church into a condition that she is immune now we can go down and we can get a shot in the arm and if you'll go right here in God's provided way of healing and go into the next paragraph or two you'll see how brother Branham is talking about he is standing there with a sore shoulder because of all the shots they just give him to go overseas now I want to just kind of break out on this for just a moment my brother and sister if I could we'll just hold the quote up on the screen but you look at this my brother and sister that diseases would break out upon the people and will follow on everyone without the baptism of the Holy Spirit you see we got to be careful if we focus on the disease we've missed the point the point was not to be concerned about the disease the focus was on the Holy Ghost not the virus amen so there's a prophet of God is laying this out he shows us it will break out upon the people and it will fall on everyone my brother and sister that's a pretty clear declaration in my mind net that it will fall upon everyone but with angel or who had charge over the plagues as given orders to touch no one on whom the mark was now Philippians 3 and 14 we'll go there for just a second now I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus you see in Philippians 4 I mean 3:14 here my brother and sisters are pressing for the fullness of the Holy Ghost people get the idea my brother and sister that we get the Holy Ghost I've got the Holy Ghost that's all there is there's no more but my brother and sister the prophet of God teaches us that there is a greater in filling in other words we can be anointed and remember the brother Branham put it I guess I call it the sliding scale he said you can be anointed on the flesh all the days of your life and go to hell so there was annoying thing that only made it to the flash level and we can have the Holy Ghost but we must have many reef fillings and as often as we refill it will determine how full we are of the Holy Ghost so if we can go for days weeks and months and not really refill it my brother and sister you're not going to be in a position to say well I'm completely full of the Holy Ghost but you will look and realize as I have used this analogy for years and I maintain that is accurate that the Holy Ghost is gasoline to the believer as gas is to the car and so if you don't fill it up it will run out and so you'll see sometimes in the lives of believers that they will will kind of get caught up in things of life and you you can tell in their approach sitting in the house of God how they conduct life you can see that something is dwindling away there's no longer an enthusiasm not a fire there not an amen for the word but it's just coming that they're just existing they're struggling maybe not trying to maintain we weren't called to just try to maintain my brother and sister we were called as the overcomer and I hope you can say amen to that so it's there he gave orders to touch no one on whom the mark was and we know now as we look at this that the Holy Ghost the mark of the high price a high mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus so our focus now remember as we have touched I didn't preach that here so it's kind of just some references I made but my brother and sister you see when our focus that when you focus on something you can't be looking in the other direction and be focusing on something else and so our focus and our action is the prophet of God speaks he he talks about an action he was talking about people stepping out claiming their healing and as they stepped out into the aisles and stepped to the altar he's talking about how their action will bring a reaction and so when you press to the mark of the high calling that is an action and it must bring a the action God will not watch you press and not reward you as it were for that pressing but as you press into the mark of the high calling the filling of the Holy Ghost we become stronger and stronger and stronger in the word amen now look brother branham in the end of this quote he says why how much kind of teachers have we got to be brethren to get the church in order to be in that condition you see it's not going to be just a simple God sent a prophet if you believe God sent a prophet you've got it covered our teaching at this stage of the message should be far beyond my brother and sister God sent a prophet should be what we're speaking to the unbeliever who's searching and hungry for something more but when we have people who have said in church for years and the message that they're being given day by day God sent a prophet just believe that my brother and sister they're setting these people up for a great disappointment because you see the Holy Ghost my brother and sister is what is going to make us immune to this world not only these diseases and viruses and whatever but immune to the spirits and of all of these I won't go into it this morning but all of these spirits that are here in the world that are fighting against the bride of Jesus Christ all of those if we want to be immune it's going to take something where we dig into the word and not just that this kind of to the preachers right here amen this would be you know to our ministry amen why how much kind of teachers have we got to be we can't just be some slacks lawful you know just easy does it want to make everybody happy my brother and sister we're not going to make everybody happy we can't make everybody happy I don't remember which one of those old ministers that there's quotes out there about but it might even have been Spurgeon that said it that if you go to church and you don't offend someone you haven't really preached you think about it amen this two edged sword can't come in our presence and Pat us on the back that's not what the two-edged sword is about the two edged sword is to cut away every little thing of the spirits of the age that's trying to connect itself to us that two-edged sword is there to trim that back off amen so it's there but we need to be we need to have we need to follow we need to support the kind of teachers that would bring us to the place that would get the church in order to be in that condition immune Satan wants to distract us from that he wants to tell us now Saints I believe this I believe in preaching an encouraging message and I believe all the years that I've pastored here then I I believe I can make the claim that I preached an encouraging message but my brother and sister there comes a time that we need to call white white and black black and we need to come down and settle these things because it's not about us sitting here as some big happy church it's us being ready and being immune to the spirits of this age to the diseases and viruses of this day this is what our purpose is amen not just to say there's a church in our community and and stand upon that alone now the times that we're living in there are different times they're difficult times you know brother Brown talks about it we have in our midst of our church those that have saw this we have got generations actually still on the earth now even all these years later from brother Branham that bet they're quite old aged right now but they have gone from horse and buggy to this space age the prophet of God talks about that probably the greatest time in history of mankind that man went from the horse and buggy to being there to see a spaceship going into outer space and you look at that and realize what's going on now my brother and sister we have all kinds of things that are happening in the day and age that we're living in everything that's done in the physical has something in the spiritual and my brother and sister we've got now I've referenced this before it's it's kind of in incredible stuff I just saw reference to it again the other day that they are now doing this hologram projection I don't remember the right words but you know they could literally project an image that would look like this here and you wouldn't even see me could totally block me out then just to projecting an image and you look at that and they're thinking how is developed or why it was developed was for warfare how many soldiers could could then proceed to you know assault or advance on something and somehow an image would be projected out there that looked just like the trees the graphs or whatever that was already there now I want to bring just a small reference my brother and sister when you take that kind of idea and put it back into the spiritual world Satan is here is part of his distraction as he is getting people to project an image that they are Christians when behind that image is not a Christian life it is not a Christian behavior not a Christian atmosphere all this is always a tinder subject not a Christian a dressing dress code now my brother and sister the prophet of God he speaks very clearly that if you don't touch on the clothes line religion you're not preaching the gospel well we don't beat on that but it ought to be something that we would pay attention to amen so we don't want to say we're Christians and behind that image be something that does not line up with the word and so as you look Satan's distraction and we're coming and we're watching we're seeing these things being manifested is that we're seeing the church becoming worldly but yet projecting an image that they are Christ chosen my brother and sister these two things will not reconcile the church cannot be worldly and be Christian period there's no way to project the world and project Christ at the same time so as we look at this we'll see the times that we're living now in Romans 8:14 we will see here my brother and sister how that God would bring things in such a way that it would dis cut out you might say the wiggle room that we would come and say well I'm a Christian but I I've got this other issue or I've got now we have issues but when we give it over to Christ we should fully give it over to Christ now romans 8:14 said for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God so this would show us very clearly that if a person is led by the Spirit they will produce what is defined as a son of God the Spirit of God cannot produce something else it can only produce itself now remember we shared this last few services we shared my brother and sister the DNA the engrafted now if God is truth and we are of his DNA then what we will produce the word proves his truth the word produces truth we're engrafted into the word amen we're the firstfruits well then we will be nothing but truth so the Spirit of God then they are the sons of God that will produce the life of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father now this spirit of adoption my brother and sister is what the Holy Ghost bringing Liberty the mark of the high calling in our life my brother and sister is also you might say the sign of having received the spirit of adoption because we're no longer than bound by this yoke of bondage the spirit of bondage that spirit of bondage is where fear is coming it's being injected now I know this might be a little direct but my brother and sister if you are sitting here today and you are sitting under a spirit of fear this is not just fear but Satan is trying to bring you to a bondage now you say well well you know I wouldn't let the devil put me in bondage but if you have fear he's already putting this yoke papania amen but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us now you know I as I was studying or thinking on this my brother and sister you see we're coming in a time that people are catching a little glimpse of what it may be if times got more difficulty in our nation and not to go into the political realm but all of those things are encapsulated in the fulfilling of God's Word and you know I saw a little deal the other day that said if you like you know empty shelves in the grocery store something of that nature empty shelves in the grocery store if you like this welcome to socialism and you look at what's happening is people are are the reason my brother and sister the shelves are empty in America today is not because of necessity and just a few weeks ago everything that was needed to live or exist here in the United States was on the Shelf in abundance and what we are seeing is fear this is the yoke of bondage being placed upon the people that is causing them to fear and their fear is causing them to go and behave in irrational fashions now Satan my brother and sister is not just putting this but this bondage of fear on the people that they're going to go hoard up all the products out of the grocery store but this will then consume them and will become the distraction of their life because fear does not remain just simply a fear of a cat or a dog or a fear of something like that fear is all-consuming and it will come to a place that it moves into their life and then you will have people and I'm speaking in a spiritual sense this morning you will have people that will start to look through their life and where they should have confidence should have faith they will have fear they will start coming to a place that fear will consume them to the place coming through maybe a natural outlet will come to a place that they will get up every single day of their life and say I don't think I have the Holy Ghost and when Satan gets them to that point he won't actually convince them now we're not talking about just going out here and delving into sin or not caring but my brother and sister the blood of Jesus Christ was not a one-time antidote it covers you and I for every single moment of our life every failure every struggle every trial it's there the blood of Jesus Christ is to cover us but if Satan can inject this this bondage of fear this distraction upon him then the people will see that their life is not worthy it's not adequate and they will judge themselves much harsher than God's Word would judge them until they come to the place that they have no hope and they quit and that will be the ultimate thing that Satan would desire so he is he brings forth this spirit of fear it is coming into society into mankind now there is no doubt that they can use this to manipulate a society there's no doubt my brother and sister as it's been mentioned by many look how easy it was to close down the churches as far as the physical body of this it said so no doubt my brother and sister these things will come in that word but Satan's dealing in a spiritual place when he deals with the Bride of Christ he knows this bride is not caught up and she's not living in her a McMansion driving her fancy stuff reveling in that that's not the goal the desire or the focus of the Bride of Christ so Satan's not going to go out in that realm and try to deal with them we'll touch on that in just a minute amen so we have not received Amen I like verse 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage he's telling us it's not here it's not for you if you have been influenced by it don't receive it Amen give them back that box of snakes amen hallelujah you know sometimes we got our society reading a few blogs online and stuff and people are like oh our nation is suffering oh my brother and sister we don't know what suffering is we've become so soft as a nation so soft as a people and that the fact that we have some struggles here are and people are saying we're suffering but regardless of how you judge this verse eighteen still covers it for our reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us it wouldn't matter what suffering we have right now my brother and sister the reports still coming out of Venezuela people are still going in the forest pulling leaves off of trees trying to make food out of just random leaves and plants and whatever because there's nothing on the shelves of the store literally what's photographs are are sent out of that nation show grocery stores with nothing on the shelves so in America we're still not suffering amen but it's not that that we're looking to now the trumpet gives an uncertain sound brother branham said some very very interesting things here he said now Paul said in the scriptures like training a soldier a soldier to a sound now a soldier has got to learn the sound of his of the bugle or the trumpet he doesn't know if the go blows whether to charge or whether to retreat if he doesn't know the difference what kind of a mixed up army would you have you see this is one of the things when you bring this over in a spiritual realm my brother and sister there's a lot of mixed-up things out here there's a lot of that we got people that are saying the prophets got to come back amen there's people saying well we've got two natures and we're fighting against one nature so we must have two souls we've got all kinds of nonsense my brother and sister but you see the real truth of it is somebody didn't train them that's what it comes round to you say well well if they're the bride they should just know but you see my brother and sister God put this ministry in the scripture to come and and be one that would encourage and lead and also teach you say well we can get all that we've got it all well that's fine then why are they mixed up Oh a man did it to them really if a man did it to them and mixed them up then that mean God's got men who can give them the right things to get it correct praise the Lord the enemy would certainly triumph over a bunch of soldiers that were no better trained than that amen that's what's the matter with our churches today we're trained them on Creed's differencing one to the other we've got to be united we got to know a trumpet then which is the trumpet they say the gospel trumpet that's it the word of the Living God is the trumpet don't mix nothing with it o my brother and sister when I look around here is as I talk to different people and and just interact with different things people say well brother Paul I've been told you sure hit on this go back to the word go back to the word well my brother and sister I think it's important that we go back to the word because even right here through the message see I might I might you know be redundant here in the pulpit about the word the word the word just go study the whole message people and you will find the Prophet over and over and over from beginning to end as a common thread or theme through it all go back to the word not will never become old that's just a my part of this message is understanding acts 2:38 you got to stay with the word amen this gospel trumpet that's it the word of the Living God is a trumpet don't mix nothing with it and I would say this if they would be passed along or people doing this my brother and sister if you cannot produce a scripture you say the prophet of God said and you can't produce scripture to back it up then your interpretation of what the Prophet said is wrong it's a day and age we got to come to the time go back to the word don't mix nothing with it don't have somebody play a French harp and another one blow a bugle you know I did this one time even with the same same music one time ministering down in Arizona I got the sisters one of them on the piano and one on the organ and we started off and they were playing the same music and then the sisters they said actually was harder than you think because in music you're always blending yourself together you're working to bring it together but we started off and and we I forget now exactly the right terms to use but we started off and they were playing exactly the same music and then one of them started playing it oh it was in a different key and then in the end the other sister sped up and was actually out running as it were music wise and then you know I had the privilege asking the church I said which one of those could we understand you see my brother and sister we got for it to be understood we got to get onto the same page we got to get onto the same line we got to get onto it not your version not my version but the words version amen so if we're out here playing a French harp and another one's blowing a bugle nobody knows what to do it brings confusion as Paul was talking about training a man to a sound and just as that sound is he knows exactly what to do because the bugler has got orders and from the chief captain and when he sounds this trumpet the army knows just exactly the place to advance or where to the withdraw or whether to turn right or left what to do by the sounding of the trumpet and this gospel trumpet that has blown in this age my brother and sister was not an uncertain sound it was not something to leave a people in confusion of what doctrine or what place or a prophet coming back but this word left a clear your sound a clear command to the church and one I say this again in my redundancy forgive me but take it back to the word and if you can't find word to back up your idea your theology and when I say word not some cherry-picked Scripture but continuity through the Word of God then my brother and sister lay that thing aside find something that's got continuity hallelujah well we got all these ideas because we can cherry pick whatever we want well praise the Lord I'm going to stick with something that started in the scripture in Genesis and finished in Revelation and that's what we're going to stand upon hallelujah now look at this my brother and sister as he's talking about now this bunch of soldiers this training this this place that we would come to you know this is what happens when confusion and Satan's got in the distraction into the church I know of a certain situation and then there is is or I should maybe say was several different ministers in the church their pastor was gone away and no longer there left one brother preaching to the church this idea and another brother in the church preaching this idea and another brother preaching his idea all of them preaching their idea what happens the people start getting confused and they're trying to blend this all together and they're not finding continuity what it does is it becomes ideas of our own become distractions from the Word of God we're not here to present our own idea but we're here to come as the prophet of God said right here this gospel trumpet that's it the word of the Living God is the trumpet and so as we look at that we realize you know what the Word of God Jesus Christ the same yesterday too in forever amen and that word of god will give a certain sound now my brother and sister if we believe that we have now let me just touch on this for a second people say we have more revelation as it were right now been given more they hadn't any other time through the ages I would agree with that that's the truth but what we preach today needs to be able to be taken back in time and stand before men such as Paul and pass the word test because you see Satan's distraction is to actually get us off people now all this might stir somebody up if they're listening but my brother and sister we're not here you say well Satan's trying to get us off brother branham's ministry get us away from the word say only what the Prophet said well my brother and sister brother Branham took us back and said I preached what Paul preached and so we could take this back further say Satan is trying to get us off of what Paul preached so let's not just take what we believe back to what brother Branham said and support it by scripture in quotes let's take it back to what Paul preached and if we can't support what we're preaching would not pass Paul's scrutiny then maybe we should put that on the shelf and wait for something else but you look at this you see we have been given and I say this in fatica ly today we have been given something that is a certain sound something we can anchor ourself to we can sit here and say you know what I can place my life my family my wife my children onto that and anchor into that and not betray my family amen but we know the devil is a worthy adversary is he not and so Satan's distractions are tailor-made for you and I never in ages gone by my brother and sister has things been more convenient we can get anything at our fingertips I don't have my phone with me but literally our phone we'll get us anything we want a best restaurant near me hamburger near me tire shop near me gas station near me I do crazy things like sit down at the computer and say what is the best religion you might think I'm silly but the reason I do that is because somebody's programming that computer and those people have their own message their own distraction their own and you say as message believers you say well brother Paul that just shows that's ridiculous that you would type something like that in but I'm not trying to think like a message believer I'm trying to think like the person out here that knows there must be a God and they are searching for something and they are trained in this mentality that they would sit down at the computer and type in what is the best religion and when they get a result out of that it might impact their life forever I know for a fact we have witness to people and they have they have been excited they are just amazed at what we're telling them and tell they went home and they typed in the computer who is William Branham but you see my brother and sister what they missed out of the whole thing just like I was speaking to you earlier don't look about the disease the fact that the Holy Ghost will shield us from the disease so we're not looking to the disease we're looking to the Holy Ghost and these people what they miss my brother and sister to lay this in how Satan works in his distraction this message is not about William Branham this message is about Jesus Christ but if he can get the people to focus on William Branham then they look on there and go all here's some kind of man net in the terms of the world says this guy was off in left field they're not interested because they're and then I'm not getting caught up but yet they like you and they like what they heard but the distraction that Satan brings takes them to and the focus comes off of the gospel and goes to the man and that Satan's distraction and in many a church in the world today the people hold their pastors to such a high esteem that the focus has gone from the gospel and what the Bible says to the Apostle or the pastor what do you want to call it many of them raise them up so high they got to get them up to the top of the list because you see there's a starts apostle that's early in the alphabet and it's in front of the rest and so they got to get it up there certainly apostle comes before pastor so they think then an apostle can come and then dominate the church with their own idea my brother and sister so far out to lunch so far out there they've got an idea a perverted idea of what it's all about and they come and they want to plant the seed I'm the apostle I'm the apostle my brother and sister I don't care what they are if they're not on the word they don't mean much amen they want to have influence on the church be humble come in the church sit down integrate yourself dig into the word offer the word to the people not ideas amen hallelujah so you see what happens is is the round round church oftentimes we've got a French heart plane over here and a bugle playing over here and usually I'm sorry when I put this when it's not on the Word of God my brother and sister usually they're bugling their own horn it's not God's horn it's their own horn listen to me listen to me listen to me well sorry not gonna happen now James 1 verse 6 I think this is pretty good I like this I've always liked this scripture but let him ask in faith nothing wavering God's not looking for the guy that's like well Lord if maybe possibly this could be God wants you to have enough confidence enough focus that when you stand on the word and you say Lord this needs to happen for the benefit of my family for my church for whatever it is Lord I'm calling your name you need to be able to ask in faith not not hope faith nothing wavering it says for he that wave earth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord o my brother and sister God doesn't want a double-minded Christian he doesn't want the guy who wants to have you know a Monday business mentality and a Sunday gospel mentality he wants you to have a gospel mentality seven days a week he wants you to be anchored in the word because you see when you get to the place that you're not wavered in other words there's no distraction when you're not wavering my brother and sister you're not looking to the right or to the left you are focused on the Word of God for our day and you are looking at that not wavering you're sold-out in other words to Jesus Christ and if you are not sold out then there'll be something that blows you this way something that blows you this way there will be influence coming to a man's life and that he will be then moved by those influences and bring himself to a place that he would say well you know I feel like maybe this and then he'll come and preach something else and then he moves over and he's anchored into that somebody else will preach something he's anchored into something I tell you my brother and sister we've had right here in our congregation that there has been folks namely female come into the church press so horrible and they would their words would be that brother Paul preaches too hard my brother and sister obviously the gospel had not been preached hard enough to them to even cause them to dress correctly but yet they can go somewhere and be perfectly comfortable as a message believer my brother and sister the prophet of God made this statement and these are not the exact words but he said we ought to be to the place we preach sin out of the church now we're not speaking about the individual but when a woman who claimed to be a message believer would come with clothes so tight it would stretch the very buttons of their blouse and then they would say they're preaching too hard you understand what I'm doing I'm laying the foundation we're not wavering will preach that sin out of the church this church grace Tabernacle better off without that spirit because that spirit will just be a distraction it'll be teaching our young girls that this is this person's accepted and that that kind of clothes is okay now I'm not picking on sisters I'm talking about the spirit that would come that people could waiver and the men hat standing here that should be preaching strong enough to put that out of the church if they don't preach strong enough to put that out of the church that church will not be immune not Church will catch every virus and I'm speaking spiritually that church will catch every virus that there is in the world today oh lord help us no I don't you know I want to preach a positive gospel just as much as anyone but Saints there's only one way to preach that and that's not waiver off of the very word of God that we claim to believe let that matter not let not that man think he shall receive anything of the Lord that's pretty exclusive is it not so we can't be wavering on one thing over here and then think that we're going to come over here and God's gonna bless us sorry I preached so hard I'm sorry Saints if you're at home and that cut to the bone text or call and we'll bring bandages it's about time Saints we're seeing the signs of the time that's pointing to an end time plagues and curses and things coming talking my brother and sister the governments of what they're going to do and we're seeing the Muslims and the Catholics and we're seeing the the all these Lutheran's and piss Kop aliens and all this all some of them even to the point they're calling the Pope Papa oh my brother and sister we coming back to the time amen the scripture shows us very clearly how those times would draw all of them right back in and it's happening so it's not a time for us to be pussyfooting around trying to preach a gospel that just makes people happy we'd be better off to stick with the prophets words when he said preach sin out of the church a smaller church that's pure is better than a large church that's filthy amen amen the Devils are worthy adversary and I would agree with that Satan's distractions are tailor-made for us you know you can go in different places I think those brother Ivan that shared that with me you know over in countries like Ukraine and different countries over there in Europe you can go get a professionally handmade tailored suit way cheaper and you can buy a suit over here of the same quality so it's tailor-made for you and I bring that example up because when something is tailor-made for you it fits you perfectly if you know whatever your physical being would be proportionately that suit fits you perfectly and Satan has a worthy adversary he Taylor makes our distractions for us in other words what distracts one brother or sister or one family over here or church will not work for someone else or another family or another Church so Satan comes and his distraction being tailor-made for us amen he has looked at our personal makeup of who we are and how we think and what affects us he looks back into our upbringing our childhood he looks into the weaknesses of our character you might say he looks at our complexes and and you know people will say I have no complexes then you're not human you're computer of some kind of robot he looked at your family you look at your job you look at your finances he'll even look at the kind of friends you choose and I say that I want to emphasize on that almost more than some of these others my brother and sister you'll find that when people now this is not a one size fits all so don't think I do but my brother and sisters a lot can be analyzed or understood by the kinds of friends people choose now I believe life needs to have a balance and I believe there needs to be a time and a season we simply live life in other words you can sit down on somebody's couch and you can just laugh and and have a good time but there also needs to be a time that the Word of God is part of our fellowship and when we come together as believers to fellowship and it's all frivolous laugh and jokester and when I say that I'm not talking about one particular evening I'm talking about that's what it is all the time you can look maybe a new family would come into the church you can look at what people they're attracted to it's kind of funny I'll probably offend somebody by saying this but it's pretty funny have you ever noticed the optimist and the conspiracy theorists are never never in true fellowship the conspiracy theorist says the whole government the whole world is here to destroy me to rob for me the optimist is praise the Lord the government changed that the laws this way in that way I'm going to go out and find a way to put that to my advantage you'll find they never go together the guy who thinks he's not really saved he all gets up every morning and wonders if he's really saved is not going to hang out in a very tight fellowship with the guy that looks at it and says you know what the blood of Jesus Christ was spilt for me he sealed me before the foundation of the world I am in him and he is in me and I'm gonna fulfill the word and I'm gonna be victorious and the man who's over here I don't even know if I'm safe they're not gonna have good fellowship you can see by the kinds of friends or what is being drawn together my brothers and sisters so Satan looks and he even looks into friendships of how he can come and sometimes it's to throw a wrench in the fent friendship but oftentimes he just follows that and you know you'll find my brother and sister and you'll say well we're obviously other Paul but there's more to it than this we won't take time to dig into it but my brother and sister you'll see a family I'll have I have a family in my mind right now an example but obviously would not would not ever name that but they move somewhere they move there because they believe they needed to do that for the spiritual welfare of their church but over time they start hanging out with a certain group of people and my brother and sister when one of that group woke up one day and says the message is false they fell like dominoes one family to another family to another family to another family like a domino buh-buh-buh-buh-buh mo they were the ones that hung out together there was something there but when that same movement you might say that same influence come through right across the valley the same members of the same church men sitting under the same ministry they woke up and said oh my goodness look what's happening we need to invite brother so-and-so and his wife and family and brother so-and-so and his wife and family and brother so-and-so and wife and family and we need to have a prayer meeting you see my brother and sister because they were of a certain fellowship and this other was of a certain fellowship and the devil looked at that and said oh I know how to use that becomes his tactic his distraction you know he even looks at what we listen to and what we read you name it as a distraction it's tailor-made for you but my brother and sister what we need to remember is these are just distraction what's going on in the world today they're posting the numbers like somebody you know even asked on the Internet there there's like how come they're not talking about the amount of people that don't have that virus and the amount of people who have recovered from the virus all you hear is a thousand people have died a thousand people have died a thousand people have died wait the flu killed more than that but you see the spirit of fear is being injected they can shut down industries that shut down airports and travel and everything and say this what we must do so they're injecting the fear this is Satan's distraction but the bride wasn't called right remember Saints these things out here outside of the Word of God are distractions amen so it's not something for us to do so we look at this now I want to just come you know back and tie this together as we close we'll look at this and and the message my brother and sister is not a message God's gospel it's not a message of uncertainty and if what you've been feeding on Saints leaves you uncertain you need to get down on your knees and you need to ask God to bring certainty in your life because the Word of God the trumpet of truth the gospel trumpet does not bring uncertainty into our lives it brings certainty now the prophet of God shows us that he spoke at this with this way that Ephesians parallels Joshua so as we would look once again and draw out of Joshua 23 going kind of back to where we started you'll see right here that it says be therefore very courageous to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses now there's people around the message that are so nitpick contentious about what said that they would be going oh that was the law that was the law were not under the law well good the prophet of God said it Ephesians parallels Joshua so to those that want to carpet that you can carpet that but here it is that we can take this so be their very courageous to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of the message and messenger to Laodicea I don't think I'm out of line to even put it that way sounds a little harsh doesn't it hallelujah well I don't mean it harsh but what we got is some people that want to just throw their darts wherever they throw their darts and just call it well that's just how it was no here's the word Ephesian age Ephesian gospel our day needs to be very courageous to keep and do all that is written in the book my brother and sister don't let Satan distract you into an ism I sometimes just marvel as I look at these people that think the rapture is over and we're in the Millennium my goodness by running a sister you can't go to a store but what you about have to look at the floor tiles or the ceiling tiles to walk through a store and you know what this is going to be kind of a this will probably get me in trouble but I I and I mean this kindly because we are what we are but my brother and sister it isn't even so much the agent we're looking but we have we have people men and women that ought to be doing something different and they go into the store in their t-shirt and spandex sometimes that's just as distracting I mean just because well anyway I'm gonna get myself in trouble it's as big a distraction if it was a pretty girl in spandex I mean they got they got their body flopped everywhere and they're walking along and they're this and we're living in a day they don't care no one cares there's no propriety there's no nothing no holiness left in them or whatever I am I am I just show it to the world my brother and sister we are coming to a time we need to be courageous it took as Joshua was speaking to those people he told them be courageous well we're living in a day it's going to take some people that are courageous that are going to look into the Word of God for our hour and say I don't care what anybody else says about this I'm going to keep this word to the letter no I'm not illegal Asst no no one's forcing me to do this I'm doing this because I believe it and I am NOT going to be distracted from anything else my brother and sister as I was going to say there I marvel at people that would say we're in the Millennium I don't think in the Millennium I'm gonna have to worry about viewing all of that out there scripture says we're going to walk out on the ashes of the wicked not follow behind them in where mark or Walmart or by Mart or Kmart let's don't get distracted let's go back to the work the word says be courageous live it do it stand on it and don't be afraid see one of the problems we have is oftentimes it's the way it's always been in the world you can repeat it often enough you can take an untruth and repeat it often enough and people will believe it let's have courage to stand up and say if it doesn't line up with the word I'm not going to call it a message myth a brother introduced me to that term sometime back here and and it's a it's a definitely a deal because you see we use that to cover things that people are preaching and teaching and living that don't line up with the word well they've just it's just you know a myth my brother and sister we don't need myths let's step beyond the myth that's nothing more than Satan's distraction to say well the brother didn't know so he could therefore promote it no my brother's sister if it doesn't line up with the word it's off the word prophet of God said it even stronger night in he said if it don't line up with the word it's an antichrist spirit Saints don't get distracted stick with the Word of God we can live we have this kind of courage that we can stand do every word hallelujah sister Emmy would you come a little you it's hard when you don't get to see all the saints faces and you don't get to do that so we miss you guys very much but we want to be faithful just to present these things that the Lord's laid upon our hearts and not to just skip over them brother Sergei I was joking with sister Geri this morning if you had not introduced streaming to our church we would all be sitting at home today but I'm glad I'm glad we have this I'm glad we can come together and preach this gospel stand on the Word of God you see the message of the hour of the gospel our Lord Jesus Christ the word promised to deliver us to a final position in Jesus Christ that final position is not a position where we stand before him and hear the words depart from me I never knew you my brother and sister the final position for the bride Jesus Christ this word is to stand before him one day and hear those beautiful words well done my good and faithful servant amen this gospel will is and will produce a life worthy of the gospel amen that's what it's doing my brother and sister and our Lord Jesus he made that promise to us and he will deliver hallelujah hallelujah you know I just had a song that I wanted to sing here and then we'll just have brother Jason close us out in a couple songs amen I'm living by faith amen I'm so glad God's given us that ability to live by faith and God bless you Saints we love you in the Lord just keep praying this virus pray it right out of our neighborhood amen we'll stay immersed in the blood of Jesus Christ we know it can't get to us there amen hallelujah I care not today what tomorrow

Lord well I enjoyed that especially right from brother Ivan the scripture he read right through to the sermon this morning and I really love that quote from the trumpet is an uncertain sound you know it's I've seen a lot of I guess back when we had our civil war here the north and the south there was always a trumpet and if there was somebody or a group that got overwhelmed he'd hear that retreating trumpet but I was just thinking no the word that was preached this morning it does it gives a certain sound and there's something within our hearts that just Wells up and goes no we need a charge amen I just thank the Lord for that certain sound amen and I want to sing that song number eight I keep listening for that different sound amen as we get ready to close a man this morning I'm
