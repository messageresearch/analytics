with us amen as we get ready to receive our pastor let's sing number 254 i'm so glad he found me i was on the mountain wandering from the fountain when i heard my savior calling me he said come to me relenting and of yours is repenting and i will lead you out when [Music] he found me put his arms on around me and he let me of his own oh and all the joy of knowing [Music] my homemade glory [Applause] [Music] now i will love him ever i'll stray [Music] and when i see him love will still grow ponder in that happy land beyond [Music] put his arms all around me and he let me [Music] oh the joy of knowing [Music] [Applause] amen good to be in the house of the lord today amen happy to have our brother sergey holm he's down here working with me the first of the week in the church and he said you know um just pray we're gonna he didn't say i hope he said you know we're gonna deliver our load in texas and we're gonna be back for for sunday and so just thank the lord for traveling mercies amen and also we want to remember our brother vasily somewhere between here and the east coast and so we just want to lift him up in prayer god bless you to our visitors today as i pray you enjoy your time here amen let's not forget the needs of the saints in the ukraine just such an ongoing very quickly changing uh situation we're seeing we're seeing god do the miraculous and yet it you know doesn't strike the world that way but we're seeing areas little pockets where uh the russians have complete control and yet the believers are able uh to pass through uh to safety and and in some cases not even meeting in an area that's considered occupied not even meeting um you know a russian patrol or or being stopped and uh then the situation you know changes in such a fashion now look how god works every time he's promised that he would deliver his saints through the ages he delivered shadrach meshach and abednego out of the fire can you scientifically explain that know what it is it's god fulfilling his word and we're seeing in this last hour he promised that he would protect his saints that nothing would come against them now that doesn't mean my brother and sister that somewhere a son or daughter of god might not suffer in the flesh but the thing is is we are looking at the promise of god that he has given to us and we're holding to that promise we're not just taking it lightly but we're we're taking that in faith amen as brother chris just sang the song it's it's our faith that's going to hold us and not our mental abilities or our knowledge and so let's just remember those saints there so many things to share that it would be a distraction of time but god is working god is moving on their behalf and um just once again as as a note just so you'll know that the church we have been giving to that and we are planning in the next few days to give again and um so just be uh aware you know your prayers are more important than your money so we can put such a great emphasis on money but your prayers are are much much more important than money and so let's just continue to lift the saints there up in prayer and you know i just want to put as a side note every one of us is currently in our own exodus so we look at you know those believers fleeing from the war zones and we see that exodus and how strenuous it is but we need to remember every one of us is in our own exodus and every one of us and i just i don't know why i feel led to say this but just as on my heart what we need is food and water in our exodus and without spiritual food and without the holy ghost we'll never finish this exodus but with the spirit of the lord upon us and the word of god before us we can finish every battle every journey be victorious in all things so let's just remember as a side note as i spoke to the other day we don't have to worry about the nations we've got to worry about as revelations 3 shows us he says i would that you would be hot or cold and so let's be hot amen let's be on fire for the things of god trusting the lord amen remember your prayer changes things so today we're just really happy to have my dear friends brother abel sister hattie uh just a joy to call them friends and you know let's just enter into the word today and just receive what god would have for us now remember we've checked all our pitchforks at the door so we don't have anything to throw over to them or to them or even maybe husband to wife or wife to husband or parents to children we're all here to receive from the lord today so we just invite our brother jay just another song if you have one and invite our our brother to come amen just to preach the word to us today god bless you saints oh and especially to our guests uh we are having a fellowship in the basement when it's done and we would love for you to stay in fellowship with us god bless you i'll sing that course he is my everything he is my all he is my everything he is my all [Music] he is my everything both praise and small he gave himself for me made everything new he is he is my hand oh yes bob's great and small always take his life for me is [Music] amen praise the lord god bless you this morning it's good to be in the house of god this is where we come to recharge as we sing the world is falling apart the bride is rising up she's getting ready this is the most exciting time to live because this is the time where the word is make it becoming flesh this is the time where all we have heard is coming to materializations so we thank god for opening our eyes the eyes of our understanding in this hour so because now we have heard but now we are seeing so we thanking god for his grace and mercy and for uh every single thing he's doing in our lives uh it's uh it's amazing what god is doing like the brother was saying from the people from ukraine so you realize that god is always has been always with you regardless of the conditions regardless of the time he always there until when you start realizing when you are at the wet hand or you have a very difficult situations when you call upon his name is the present help in time of need that is the god you are serving this morning and then we are glad to be called his children thank you brother paul and the family for the invitations and uh we thank you very much it has been very good to be here been uh taking very good care of us and god bless you and uh it's good to see each and every one of you here brother dean hart and every single one brother jason god bless you then my friend there is coming taller and taller god bless you all amen so that is maybe all that i can say now shall we stand god the word of god amen if you have your bible at the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen that's why we are here let us open our bibles in uh genesis chapter 5 verse 21. uh and the bible uh if you have it oh praise the lord it's already up there okay genesis 5 21 the bible says and enoch leave six sixty and five years and we got methuselah and enoch walked with god now uh the word he walked with god uh after we got methuselah 300 years and begot sons and daughters so we understand by that that enoch was like one of us enoch was having a family enoch was saving a house because he have sons and daughters he has to put them in a house enoch was going to work or he know was maybe a farmer enoch was doing all these things but also he walked with god amen and then he says and all the days of enoch with 365 years and enoch walked with god and he was not for god for god took him amen it's very good to read the word of god yeah because for god is the one who doing these things and god took enoch he was a man walking he was a man doing all the things that men do but by the same time he was working with god let us pray heavenly father we thank you this morning began this as a great privilege to be in your presence we thank you father for this time for this assembly and for the pastor and for every single one of us we just commit the remaining of this service in your hand we thank you and bless your holy name in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you as you may have your seat so we see that uh the bible says enoch walked with god and then god took him so enoch is a type of believers because you see god want us to come up to the higher place god want doesn't want us to remain where we are god wants us to go higher and higher you see he said the natural is the type of the spiritual so it's in the natural man always advanced men always want to move forward actually you want you you the car you have right now it's not the car of 1965 because now you have all the technology inside the car you have the sensors you have the chips you have all these things they make it to run better than it was in 1965 for example because man is always trying to better themselves they want to move forward because actually the natural is the type of the spirituals because god wants us to come up higher he wants us to come where he is because the way i am i want you also to come amen so we see that god is willing and wanting us to come as much closer to him as we are and then because enoch is the type of believers and that word work in the bible uh it's a reference of an expression that means fellowship and obedience so work mean fellowship and obedience that produce results so when you are fellowshipping with god and your obedience to god is referred the manner it's referred basically to a manner of a life or a living that is near to god so it's basically you you how you are closer to god the manner of your life the manner of your living is as closer to god as possible that means walk with god amen so that's why enoch worked with god basically that means enoch was living a life so close to god every single thing he was doing was so close he was conscious of what god says he was aware of what god required and then he was walking very close to god and then because when you walk close to god every single thing becomes possible because god is your friend every single thing become possible because with god nothing shall be impossible in god's vocabulary there's not impossibilities if god every single thing is possible god wants us to come to his kingdom his kingdom where is ruling because a kingdom basically you have a ruler and you have subjects and then god is the ruler and we are a subject so he wants us to be ruled by him he want us to be ruled by the holy ghost he wants us to be ruled by the power of the holy ghost amen amen so and then the bible says in hebrew chapter 11 verse 5 hebrew 11 verse 5 the bible says it says here it says by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death end was not found because god has translated him amen so enoch was translated that she should not see death because god is the one who translated him he was just working with god and god is the one who's doing the work inside it's not you doing the work and your your only job is to obey god your only job is to trust god and your only job is to stay behind the word of god and when you do so now god is the one as enoch was working with god and god was making the transformation every single time you come to listen to the word there's something that is happening is that what the bible said don't forsake the assembling of yourselves because that's where things happened because when you come to church that way miracles happen it's where god is dealing with us the inside man is getting fed by the word of god and when the inside man is fed by the word of god the transformation is happening and you don't even know how it's happening but it's happening because god cannot lie amen praise the i feel good amen praise the lord and then he said enoch was translated that he should not see death and it was not found because god translated him for before his translation now listen to this he said before his translation he has his testimonies that he please god see the bible so precise he said he has his testimony that he pleases god amen and that word pleasing god basically means an essential aspect of life of believer basically uh the total commitment to god amen that is pleasing god when you commit yourself completely to god when you give yourself completely to god now that is pleasing god so that is please that's why the prophet of god says a a complete surrender to the all word of god and title you to the token when you completely surrender to god when you completely give yourself to god when you completely obey the word of god now you have access to the token and the token is the holy ghost and the holy ghost gives you power to do things that you cannot do the holy ghost gives you power to do things that yourself you cannot do prophet says that the holy ghost gives you three powers so it gives you the power of prayer it gives you the power of speech and it gives you the power of your holy life so because you cannot do these things by yourself you cannot manufacture the christian life you cannot manufacture how to live as a christian but you need god to come on the sins god they got inside working on the outside the one is inside of you is greater than the one who is in the world because he's the one who's doing the work he's the one who's performing all these things he's the one who's making the translations because enoch worked with god and god was pleased with finals and god translated enough and enoch was not because enoch was a brother like you and me enoch was weak and the prophet enoch is the type of the believers praise the lord it's a pleasing god is a total commitment to god's word so when you fully surrender all to god when we fully surrender all to god sometimes that we have it difficult sometimes because we are not completely surrendering to god so when you fully surrender to god and god is pleased with enoch in romans 12 verse 1 the bible says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service total commitment to god when you totally committed to god that is your reasonable service to god and now when you commit it to god and god will take control and god you see uh we talked about the young rich ruler he was not able to commit all to god he was he was reluctant he didn't want to commit all things to god in order for god to take control when you committed you see the the young boy who was having his lunch box with a for lunch going to school and then he heard that jesus was preaching he missed school that day and then he went to see jesus and then he he committed his lunch to jesus christ and when jesus speaks it lunch up and then he looked towards loaves of bread and fish and then when jesus blessed it and then he started multiplying and then he gave it to the disciples and then when they went start giving to people and they just cut one bread and the bread just become big again they did the bible they didn't go back to jesus again say uh my bread is finished give me another one i need to go to serve they never went back to jesus read it they said jesus bless the bread and give it to them and then they went in the midst of five thousand people the bible says the bible say five thousand men probably five thousand women and then maybe five thousand kids maybe it was fifteen thousand people because the bible says it fed five thousand men but the disciple never go back to the end of jesus again because this boy committed every single things to god when you commit every single things to god god does have a power of multiplications does the god does have a power of transformation god can change things can god can create where there's no creation amen praise the lord amen see the young rich ruler didn't catch that revelation he didn't know who he was talking to he didn't know in which presence he was in he was in the presence of the creator of heaven and earth the men who created the moon the man who created the sun the man who created every single thing because the bible says all things were met by him and for him and for his own glory praise the lord amen hey your reasonable service in the book of psalms chapter 103 the bible says he says bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord on my soul and forget not all his benefits my subject is the benefit of working with god that's my subject this morning the benefit of working with god now the bible says here bless this bless the lord all my soul within your soul the inside man the inside man that where god wants you to focus on you can focus on the outside man you can put on your suit you can put on your shirt but if you're inside man there's no room for god every single thing is nothing amen now what david says bless the lord on my soul and forget not all this benefit now listen verse or three all three said chapter three verse three says who forgive all thy iniquities that is the one of the benefit that when working with god who forget all the iniquities and then he says who in all thy diseases it doesn't matter what disease it is it doesn't matter what the name of the disease either they can name it cancer they can emit high blood pressure they can name it asthma or whatever more but our god is our god is healing us from all diseases amen it is specialized in things that are impossible amen he said who redeemed thy life from destructions who is delivering that from the stress so can we imagine if you didn't have christ where will you be yeah where will you be tonight you'll be all oh you'll be all depressed you'll be all depressed your life will be such a mess but god was rich in mercy amen who has plagued us from the hand of distractions who crown and deal with loving kindness and tend to mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good thing so that the youth is renewed like an ego amen this is not the assembly of old people this is not only a summary of young people this is the assembly where god is renewing our strength day to day amen praise the lord he's the one who's doing that he's the one who's making the translations amen enoch worked with god and it was not because god took him he took him bring him up to the higher ground say come up higher john that way revelation is that's why you can see me amen when we speak about benefits benefited mean that there is an advantage that come out of something that that is benefit there's an advantage come out from something you see when you go look for a job they say our job we have certain benefit that will give you we give you x amount of vacation time we'll give you a retirement account we'll do this maybe you have a three year three month of vacation i don't know if that exists no more even we will give you this and this maybe at this this other company also say no we do better we'll give you this benefit and this benefit and this benefit but the only thing we need to realize is that all those benefits are limited all those benefits are limited only god's benefits are unlimited so you can have all this benefit but they are limited but only god only got benefits look the love of god the love of god is unlimited benefit because the bible david once says where shall i go from thy spirits where shall i go from that spirit he said if i stand up in heaven that was there if if i go i make my bed down into hell you are there that is a benefit that is unlimited it doesn't matter what you have been where you have been what you have done where you have been but god's mercy endure forever he always looking for us look at adam god say adam adam where down god was looking for him look at the the teeth at the cross yes say lord remember me in your kingdom tonight yes it didn't go it was not baptized we don't have a record where it was baptized where he was sanctified justify we we don't know he was was he filled with the holy ghost we don't know but he was a teeth that he was his identity but in the presence of the sun in the presence of the transformation power in the presence of god god is the one who can change every single things god is the one who can change the course of your life god is the one who can change darkness to light he can change depression to a good life he can change sickness to healing he can change every single thing because he's the one is the same yesterday today and forever is loving kindness never ended that is our god praise the lord prophet of god saying the message greater than solomon is here 1963. he says here it says look at the church so the church is always looking back the church is always looking back say let's look up let's look up amen he says the church is always looking back say let's look up for the power are limited so their power are limited the power of the churches the power of people are limited now you want to understand and we have unlimited power for all things are possible to them that believe in god because when all things are possible that is unlimited that is unlimited so when you're working with god you have unlimited power every single thing is possible you you don't don't don't think that this will happen you the only thing you need to do is to trust and obey god is to trust and obey god the rest of the thing god will take care of that we don't know how he'll do it but he'll do it anyhow he said moses i want you to go with the children of israel and you'll cross this red sea looks like an impossible task but god knows what he's doing god is in control of every single thing praise the lord and then he says and a quickening part in the in the rising side in the rising of the sun he says the quickening power let us see is coming the quickening power stretches from death to life we were once dead by the quickening power of god he said the quickening power give us discernment that the only thing can give us discernment to know exactly to know what is wrong with you what to do what you have done and what you have not to have done and what should i have done and what will be the quickening power all these things is doing amen it gives you discernment amen so now when you're working with god you you have discernment because you have the holy ghost you have the holy ghost is very important oh yes because we felt we fought we fought the holy ghost impossible to be a christian to work a christian life because it's god himself who will do the work it's god himself will be leading you it's god himself who is in command he's the one who's in charge and that he will guide you in the right path and then he's the one who will give you discernment we'll let you know you have to do this you don't have to do this only the quickening power can do that amen praise the lord amen so our work with god come with many benefits in this life and life to come see uh peter once he went he says lord as a businessman we have forsaken every single thing what can i gain that is peter talking to the lord himself so what can i gain i we have forsaken every single thing to follow you but as far as i can see you don't have a house you don't have a house you don't have a boat the other day you borrow my boat you don't have a boat you don't have a house so what are my gaining when i'm following you that that spirit you read that in the book of luke on the book of mark he said what can i gain what happened jesus says peter no man no man has followed me he said he will get in this world i'll give him houses i'll give him lands that jesus himself saying i give him not one house he said houses i give him lands i give him brothers and sisters and in the life to come eternal life that is a benefit that is unlimited that the only god who can do that because all these benefits are limited but god one is unlimited praise the lord amen he not live a life that demonstrate the faith that was in his heart his life of faith was consistent constant and complete work with god that was enoch life it was consistent and complete work with god amen and then we see that when you're walking with god god introduce you to the supernatural that's right amen that's right exactly because it's natural for god to be supernatural amen that's exactly right it's natural for god to be supernatural so when we're working with him he introduces you to the supernatural amen because the supernatural means beyond and above the naturals it's something that is beyond and it's behind and above the natural you cannot explain it and then this is where god operates this is where in the realm where men and god are meeting together this is in the wrong way where the unbeliever cannot understand this is where man and god are meeting together that is in the supernatural that way you're reaching god that's where you come to god in prayer that where you have faith in the word of god and then the supernatural in following you because that way god wants to do amen praise the lord in the book of acts chapter 13 verse 22 the bible says and when he has to remove him he raise up david unto them david to be their king to whom also he give testimony and say i have found david the son of jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will so david was a man according to god's heart he was like like us yes sir that's right but he was a man according to god's own heart you see now see that part of david's call why call men according to one's heart because he has absolute faith in god it doesn't matter the opinion of father said goliath is big and you cannot reach him this is an impossible task to do but he was trusting in god completely and god was coming on on the scene you see elias was in contact with god was working with god was doing was in in relationship with god the bible says in book of james said elijah was a man of subject-like passion as we are but he pray earnestly that it might not rain and then it did not rain not only for one day but for three and a half years because now when you are walking with god god introduces you to the supernatural where things start happening when you start waiting upon the lord so those who are waiting upon the lord shall renew their strength so you just look to god say god this is difficult for me but it's not difficult for you i just commit my life to you i just commit this situation to you this is what i have this is what problem i have this god i want you to come on the scene and then you just wait and god take they take over and then he says that he was a man of like passion as we are you see now in hebrew chapter 11 verse 1 he said now faith is a substance now faith is a substance or things up for the evidence of things not see for by hit the elders obtain a good report now because it is you don't see it but you believe it you don't know how it will happen but you believe god will make it happen you don't know what will happen what what the end result will come but god who is rich and mercy is in control amen praise the lord amen say verily verily i said to you that except a man is born again cannot see the kingdom of god the prophet come say seeing means understanding amen amen seeing men understanding the kingdom of god because you he says he says you can you can see but you cannot understand like the pharisees they were there but they could not understand he says seeing means understanding but the holy ghost will make you understand what god is doing because god himself will be believing his own word because it's god inside of you will be believing his own word he'll be saying amen to his own words because all it's about god amen praise the lord amen praise the lord he says uh the book of luke chapter 22 24 he said that this the disciples or the two that were going to the road to a mouse the way talking among themselves they could not understand what was going on and then the way torn up so we don't understand they were walking and then they were talking so we don't understand what's going on how jesus the king of kings could die i i don't understand see when you talk about him he comes yes and it was in the midst of them and the bible says he start talking to them it's not addressing their doubt started stressing their doubt it's that question did you you you didn't read what the prophet says yeah he didn't come say uh yeah i am yeah no no no no it's not it start by dealing with their doubt you didn't read what the prophet said and they keep walking and then invite they invite jesus for a dinner their house and then he allow now their eyes to open and they could see him now oh it's you and they appear to them and then they give them directions give them direction go there in jerusalem until we enjoy power and then he blessed them because they were working with them we with him because the bible says i will not leave you comfortless i'll come to you the world will not see me but you you will see me in another way you will start understanding what is my plan for this time what is my plan what am i doing with the modern event made clear by prophecies now we can understand their future home our our future home will be our life is not limited here our life is not like just hearing uh going to where coming going no allah we have a better purpose than that we have been called for a higher purpose we have been called to go up higher in the kingdom of god and then here with a stranger and going on going through this world but we have another kingdom that is waiting for us another land that is a beulah land that's a beautiful land in this one and jesus give us instructions about our future home about the event that's coming out about all these things and then we know who we are in the word of god we know our position in the word of god we're just not people like any other people but we know exactly why we are here because the prophet said this building was built for a purpose this building was here for a purpose uh likewise you are also here for for a purpose so we are does not hear absolutely and then it says here in the easter seal the tourists in 1965 in 19621 he says here he says i don't know if i did write that down okay say i will read this uh i didn't give that to the brothers but he said because they are chosen the neuropath the harder way that as work that you have worked of your own choosing you have choose the harder way because every single thing is a choice the way of life is a choice coming to church is a choice going prophet said even going to hell you can choose to but god doesn't want that every single thing is a choice but it says because they have chosen the narrow way the harder way does speak the correct and the precise decision and it is my way now the way of god are not easy ways the word of god is we are we we are like in the army we are being trained we are rugged people we are here to trust completely in god we don't rely on our might we don't rely on who what we have we rely completely on god amen he said because i chosen this narrow way it is my way he said and because of this momentous decision a huge another benefit coming a huge portion at heaven see working with god comes with benefits amen because they're choosing this a huge portion of heaven is waiting for thee what a glorious decision amen which is a hard decision you can be shy i know many brothers and sister who has been shined by their family to believe the word of god many of them i know you'll be mocked you you'll be called all kind of names it's a harder way but it's a precise and good decision and it's god's way that i want god's way to be my way i don't want my way i want god's way because if it's god's way it's god's leading if it's god leading i know exactly where i'm going i know my finality is secure i know where i'm going because god is the one who's leading me amen say what a glorious decision that's made he says this in itself which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in the law of divine that way the victory lies when we completely surrender to god when we completely surrender to god when you completely give it to god all your problems all your need all every single thing just give it to god don't keep that lord by yourself you're going with this lord every single time oh your mind your the battle of the man all your things of the past all these things just take that lord give that to the feet of jesus christ you see jesus was invited one time to the simon the pharisee he invited him the prophet said he invited jesus to mock him but when he arrived there this woman this prostitute say this is my opportunity i'll go i am choosing this i'll be choosing this hardaway everybody will be mocking me here this is my only time this is my own opportunity i don't know when i will see jesus again so i will do every single thing i can if they mock me that will be all right but at least i want to be at the feet of jesus if he checks me out that will be all right but i'll take my chance but look at the difference with the flankie or the men who bring the invitation uh from simon the pharisee he didn't take his chance he just arrived before the master before the lord of lords before the great i am the lord of the universe you're right he said jesus my master simon this the pharisee invited you and then he turned back the prophet said wow look at this man he didn't take a chance but this woman he was shining all town every single one knows him knew him he could not even go to the well in the morning he was going at 11. because every single one would laugh at him if he got seven because this is a prostitute look at this prostitute look at this process now he was going at 11. but look at god's mercy our god's grace is unlimited he just went by that time that she was there he meet with jesus at 11. he says oh give me water give me water say it's not customary for us to give you water and say no if you knew who you were talking to you will ask me whatever ever you see god is looking for when you have the seed of god in you it doesn't matter god who's reaching mercy it gives you an opportunity every single time is an opportunity that depends on our choices and this woman comes to simon's house and then he arrived he took his chances and then they didn't minister to jesus or anything and then she comes she got she bought she bought the perfume and she come and then she run he said master do you know what kind of woman this is jesus i didn't say anything she was ministering she was crying she wiped his feet it's a woman your many sins are second hallelujah god who's richard mercy should he take a chance to go and meet the master amen because every single thing is a choice you have to choose if you don't choose god is a gentleman he give us choices see one time brother billy paul says this testimony says when he was like a teenager or something you want to run away from the house or you want to go deep with grandma because you want to go here and there the prophet says i say i extend my hand like this say okay now which way do you want to choose everything is a choice which way you want to choose hallelujah you need to choose right you see emma's three three the bible say can two work together except they agree you cannot walk together if you're not agreeing now when you're working with jesus christ you'll be agreeing because we'll be ministering to you be speaking to you it should be an agreement it should be a contract because record when you are signing a contract both of you agree contract is not a dictatorship you see the centurion romans come to jesus say master my servant is sick did i say okay you want me to go to your house say no i don't i am a master i have people under me if i said to this guy he goes if i said to that one goes he goes i know also if you speak the word if you speak the word i know that my servant will be healed you see now the centurions was having much more revelations because he knew that jesus was having power over sickness power over he or over every single demons he was the master of the wind he know every single condition he can do anything he is god it's unlimited god he can do anything so this this centurions were standing there say master i i don't it was it was entering a contract with god a divine contract with god so you just said something he didn't believe in replacement because he could replace this servant he was not his brother he was not his son or daughter was she was a servant he could say do you have do you have a cousin who can take your place or do you have your nephew can take your place i have my business need to be running here no he didn't believe in replacement but to believe in restoration because god is always restoring god is always restoring he said i shall restore all the years all the years god will restore if your memory is fed in god will restore your memory if your your your health is fading god will restore your health if anything is failing god will restore your head look at job job was a man working with god he was working with god he was obedience to god he was surrendering every single thing to god he was giving gifts he was he he was a perfect man he was a believer amen and the devil was not happy with that say look at job look at him because you bless him you do all these things god say no i know what is inside of job i know what's going on with him now god restore every single things to job because our god is a god of restoration amen our god is a god of restorations praise the lord in the message there's only one way provided by god for anything i even like the taro there is only one way provided by god for anything prophet says enoch needed a ladder one day he had walked 500 years with god and pleased him he needed a ladder god provided him a highway walk right up home elijah needed a rope one time and god gave him a chariot with horses to it amen oh my god praise the lord samson needed a spear and god gave him a jawbone of world mule now if samsung will have said lord joe born i need a spear because the element of the finish time i think i need the spirit to go straight to them that is men reasoning your ways are not god's ways god said my ways are above your ways samsung was thinking spears better but for god's jawbone was the better and then he said i'll give you a job on and then with that job on it destroy one thousand more whatever more philistines because when god lily's match when god is in it he can god is the one who orchestrated all these things he said you see samsons beat down a thousand philistines with it god provided god provides your needs god has a way amen god has a way for our needs god has a way it doesn't matter how long that takes it doesn't matter the conditions it doesn't matter say i have pray i pray i pray i don't know lord i don't know how to pray no more i pray i pray no god does have a way the ways of god when you fully surrender to god when you fully give it all when you're fully committed to god god will take over amen god will take over it doesn't matter how long that takes that's right you're trusting god because god is working on both hands god is working on both hands you see the prodigal son he went away but when he went away god was already working inside of him maybe he's my son i don't understand oh lord i've prayed for a long time i pray lord i pray god say be still and know that i am god i have my ways i have my ways i'll bring that son back to you that's right i bring that child back to you i'll do the miracles i am god i am a god of paradox i work miracles i am a paradoxical god i will do things that above your mind above even your thinking i am god you need to trust in me you need to obey my way you need to fully surrender to me and then when this prodigal son went and then when he arrived there and then one day he stood up and said oh my father's house is better than here it's god was dealing with him even when he was there god was dealing with him in whatever he was doing he was doing maybe do this i don't think this is right but yeah because we have so many people i will just do it but i don't think this is right god was dealing with him amen his father was praying lord my son one day my child lord i just trust i don't know how that will happen praise the lord it's already done prayers changes things prayer changes even the mind of god and then one day that boy comes back say master i'm just going back to my father i think at my father's house this better thing than here god who's working in both hands amen praise the lord he says from i thought not your thoughts neither your ways my ways said the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and i thought my thoughts then your thoughts amen we see that when we walk with god when we walk with god our god is taking the preeminence on us it's taking the prayer in us so when you take the premise you're becoming our guide through the holy ghost it's guiding you now the holy ghost is witnessing to you amen you see sometimes you may even drive in the road and then you feel i'm not going this way i'm going this way the holy ghost is working and then he says oh there were a bad accident right there god the holy ghost is so real as the time goes on it's so real the presence of god is so real and then you just feel the power of god inside of you that quickening power the power of most must most god inside of you and then it's guiding you okay so the bible says here he said therefore leaving the principle of the doctrine of of christ let us go unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and fifth of god of doctrine of baptism and of laying off hand and of resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and this will do if the lord permits because we need to come up higher god is requiring perfection by his word only by the word of god amen god is making us access the world of the supernatural then he says revelation 19 verse 9 and he said unto me right bless are they which are called at the marriage supper of the lamb and he say unto them these are the true saying of god amen we are blessed when god calls us it's a true saying of god you are blessed when god calls you when you come you're already blessed because when you god calls you it comes with a package of benefit and that package covers every single benefit every single need is in that package because god has already done it amen amen praise the lord say i am not worthy to come to your house that the central roman are saying i am not worthy but only god is worthy revelation chapter 5. let us read that amen revelation chapter 5 verse 1 the bible says it says and i saw in the right hand of him that set on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with the seventh seal and i saw a strong angel proclaim with loud voice who is ready to open the book who is west open the book and to lose the seal thereof now remember the roman centurion said to the lord i am not worthy i am not worthy but jesus here says who is worthy to open the book and they say and no man in heaven no man in earth under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon or a book you cannot even look at it he said i went much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me whip not be they lie on the tribe of judah the rule of david has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seal thereof and then on verse 8 it says and when he has taken the book the phobias and the four and twenty elders fell down before him the lamb having everyone there abs and golden veils full of others yes which are the prayers of the saints prayers changes things every prayer that you have been prayed says it was full of others which are the prayers of the saints so all the prayer of the saints were there and when this opens it was the time that all prayers when you pray to god just believe only believe all things are possible to them that believe you are already committed to god and god is faithful our god is faithful to make it happen amen praise the lord we praise the lord i'll read one more things here it says here he said they say come in just love here to teach the word and the pharisees and so forth but there was something about your teaching that was different talking about jesus christ he says and once inside the door maybe a humble heart no matter how humble it was but never to humble to for him to come in when you invite god it doesn't matter amen doesn't matter look abraham the bible says abraham hear many talk to god many times hear god voices many times but in revelation chapter 8 genesis chapter 18 now god was going to abraham amen now this time was god coming to abraham and abraham was to minister to god because in genesis 18 that was abraham standing up lord you need to rest i need to go bring this i need to come with this sarah can you bring this and then and then all these times god abram was telling sarah i have heard the voice of god god has spoken to me today god has by this time god come and sarah can hear god himself speaking amen because now sarah must also have the same rapturing faith like abraham you must have the something like enoch you must be also receiving the same word the same rapturing faith that abraham was having because god is taking care of each and every one of us all our prayers every single thing we hear when we totally surrender and committed to god god will take care of it just depend on our choices what are we choosing what are we choosing amen as i'm finishing here reading book of luke chapter 22 verse 18 the bible says for i say unto you are not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come john 6 44 says jesus therefore answer and say unto them not among yourself no man can come to me except the fathers which ascend me draw him first so only the father can draw you first he's the one who can call you first like enoch worked with god he pleased god and god took him because no man can come to god except god draw him first so if you are here this morning god has drawn you first if you believe god god is the one who has drawn you first if you trust in god is god doing these things because no man can come to me except my father draw him first hallelujah is that why enoch worked with god and then he was not because god took him in another way god draw him up higher said john come up higher no man can come to me except my father draw him first oh what almighty god we serve because he's the one who's doing all these things he's the one who draw you say draw me near to you lord i want to be much more closer to you than i have been before that is our god that is the god who we are serving the lord of the bible the same yesterday today and forever it never changes it's still the same god if you ever need if you have a situation if you have a load give it to the hand of christ give it to the feet of the cross it's here it can meet on it it can meet our problem it is god it's more taking care of us than we think he is keeping us more than we can even imagined like he is he's he is like the brothers in ukraine that's the brother you see god is taking care of his children he's taking care of his children no man can come to him except him throw him first that's why we are here that's why you have that longing of listening to the word of god longing to come to church longing to fellowship longing to praise god you that is god doing that is god calling you god attracting you attention god is the one who's doing all these things benefit of working with god there's so many benefit for working with god god will give you a clear vision god will show you what to do when you are confused my people shall never be in confusion no more god will straighten everything out god will make a thing right because he is god because he's taking care of us benefit of working with god introduce us in the world of possibilities in the world of sunnah supernatural because that is the way god is is so natural for him to be supernatural it's so natural for him to be that god who's provided all this benefit because that's exactly what you want to do shall we stand this morning praise the lord see when you get in this contract divine contract with god god will keep his part of the contract see the prophet speaking about the chinese laundry man see they'll cut this piece of paper in two they give you one you go with one every single one is keep is and god is always keeping his part very faithfully why whenever you left him you'll find him whenever you left god you'll go back and you'll find him look at the ten lepers they come they ask god can you kill us and then god healed all of them and then they went only one or two come back and then when they come back they found jesus where they left that's what the bible says they found jesus where they left you say where are the nine where are the rest you see where you left god you'll find him because he's keeping his part of the contract like this chinese laundry man so you bring yours then you bring ease okay perfect that's what god is doing our god is working mightily inside of the believers it's working inside of us it's it's dealing with us it's giving us solution to our needs of our problems our situations is still the same still acting the only thing you want a full surrender a full commitment a full commitment to god the prophet said enoch you know walk with god means enoch obey every word of god yes that's why the prophet said enoch obey every single word of god he says enoch walk with god whatever god says enoch never missed one word he walked with god what was he he was a son of god he was an ego that has been called to that day when you fully surrender to god when you fully give yourself to god because only god is able to do anything it can change these situations he can it's the master of the wind he can check the circumstances in our lives because that's what he want to do prophet says the blessings of god are here we just need to lift our hair and grab all those blessings because that's what god wants us to do because we have the benefit of walking with god like in the natural if you find a work they give you a benefit package but this package is limited but god package is unlimited because faith is unlimited is giving you many things it's it there's no impossibility with god the impossibility doesn't exist with god every single thing is possible to them that believe and then if you believe you can see the glory of god and that by faith many have a good report we talk about enough we talk about all this warrior in the book of hebrews 11 by faith by keeping their part of the contract by trusting completely in god don't be dismayed don't be dismayed don't be discouraged but stand on the promises of god when you stand on the promises of god god is able god is faithful god will keep it part of the contract because he's faithful that is our god that is who he is he's still the same he's still acting in 2022 because he's the same yesterday today and forever praise the name of the lord that is our god that is our message because this message the finality of it it's god dwelling in the believers it's not only on the book on the tape on the prophet that's good that i am in but god won't come and dwell inside of us now we may do the same thing again because the bible says what was in god he put in christ and what was in christ he put it in the believers now the believers become the representation of god now when they see you they see mrs jesus christ you have the same word you have the same power you have the same benefit now you can talk like god you can speak like god you can believe like god you can sing like god because oh it's god doing the benefit of working with god because enoch worked with god and he was so pleasing to god and god draw him higher amen oh it's good to be in church brothers because that's when god is speaking that when god is dealing with heart that when god is spilling to your inside man that man that is feeding on the word because the holy ghost when he comes he gives you the power to believe his word that's what our god is doing amen praise be the name of our lord shall we bow our head as we go the lord in prayer amen thank you lord father we thank you this morning no man has come to you except you draw him first and we are here because you have called us father we believe your word enoch walk with you and we are walking with you tonight today because you are our god once again we thank you for your grace if there's any need there's any situation if there's anything further we believe your world we are more than [Music] able to receive every single thing we ask in jesus name just commit the remaining of this day and this word for your own glory jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you benefit of working with god hallelujah introduce us to the supernatural amen when we walk with god amen introduce the supernatural it's real friend yes it is it's real you just need to obey god don't be wary not wary faith where is the enemy of faith when you pray committed to god doesn't matter how long that will take god is working on both hands brother bless you amen amen [Music] is [Music] is [Music] as i look back on this road i [Music] and if there's one thing i've learned in this life my redeemer is faithful and true my redeemer faithful and true to your testimony this morning everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and true my heart rejoices [Music] when i read the promise there is a place i'm preparing for you if there's one thing that i've learned in this life my redeemer is faithful my redeemer is faithful and true everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies are new my every teamer faithful and true you know when i look at verse one [Music] i just look at that it's almost like a sermon in itself a reminder of god stirring up our pure minds in remembrance he hasn't brought us here saints with no testimony we haven't come to this stage in our life to say i've never seen god i've never seen god work i've never seen god answer prayer but we stand here today as a people amen a body of believers that can say we see god on the scene we see answered prayers we see the moving of the holy ghost and i say thank you lord because while the world is out here stumbling around what is god who is god where is god how do we find god god is here my brother and sister and he's moving in the midst of his people amen aren't you glad you're god amen has brought you to a place that's kind of funny our brother chris just just negotiating a new job one of the things you have to talk about what are the benefits hallelujah well i'm telling you if you're not serving god with your whole heart mind body and soul today i challenge you as your friend as your brother as a pastor i challenge you find one benefit in this book that he has not honored that's it yes find one thing in the word of god that god has not come down and honored you say but i have a need in my life i've been praying for and god hasn't answered that prayer i want you as as brother barry brought out in the services we were in back east you know you need to stop and you need to look up and see just how great your god is we get our nose to the grindstone oh i don't want to go into all of this but my brother and sister this life we live in was meant for you to stick your nose on the grindstone and never lift it up to see who you are that's right amen to go through life just thinking this is what life is i was born i had a happy time in my childhood and i calm and now i just have to put my nose to the grindstone and this is all my my life as a man i listened to the other day he said if you are under the anointing of this world right now your golden years will not be gold [Music] but you see the golden years of the believer is our time right now here in the presence of god it's not going to be 65 70 75 we have no promise of those days but i have a promise for today amen amen i have a promise today of what i can receive yes sir amen this is not that we serve god just to get the benefit but something don't you love this something down in the soul says lord i want to serve you lord something inside of me just cries out to you i want to serve you lord oh hallelujah you know i'd like you to just kind of sing this little song as it were just a little praise and we'll sing another song or two but let's just real softly and from our heart just sing this little song thank you lord this little chorus thank you lord for saving my soul it should be something that we thank him every day every day lifting our our hearts up before him just to say lord as brother abel said where would we be saints without him what would our life be if god was completely absent from our life oh what wretched people we would be thank lord we you you today for saving my souls oh thank you lord for making [Music] thy great salvation so rich lord saving my soul thank you lord for making me you lord for giving to me thy great salvation [Music] hallelujah let's just sing another song and we'll bless the food and be dismissed and as i already stated i pray our visitors will just come fellowship with us we'd love to get to know you amen [Music] i sing praises to your name oh lord praises to your name o lord for your name is great and greatly to be praised i sing praises to your name in the name of the lord oh lord praises to your name oh lord for your name is

to be praised [Music] i give worship to your names lord worship to your name oh lord for your name is great and greatly to be amen did you enjoy that this morning you know it's just really hard not to just go ahead and preach a sermon over again but i think you all got it the first time but i just couldn't help myself i just got all kinds of notes and oh things you'd like to just say now did you
