[Music] with just anyone let me put it that way but he will share his glory with his bride forget how that scripture goes but anyway in isaiah but we know he'll share his glory with his bride so may he be glorified through his bride because the wife is the glory of her husband amen so we thank the lord for that just good to be in the house of god tonight amen thankful to have our pastor back and these uh others everyone that's been gone god bless you i um i was going to bring a certain subject here tonight that god really had laid in my heart and it's still on my heart but i realized and god changed moved me aside and brought i want to bring something else i pray that it'll just cap off kind of what we've been saying and and i'll bring that at a later time i just don't have time i realized i wouldn't have time tonight to do it i really need about a couple services to finish what we pretty much started sunday so i need a couple services to to bring that in deeper further into to an area of the church age book so i want to title this tonight his chosen generation his chosen generation god has a chosen generation amen if you'll stand with me let's just have a word of prayer i appreciate our visitors and i understood that the sister is a daughter of brother neville uh i believe we're looking at that you sister there you're you okay then you probably know linda wood your sister [Music] we knew her at bcf we knew her at bcf so we you look a little bit like your sister i can tell that now so uh god bless you trust it the word encourages your heart tonight amen it's good to be in it's good to be in not just the building but in the house of the lord a part of his body a part of himself amen let's have a word of prayer our heavenly father we do thank you for this opportunity now to to in this hour to be the very expression of yourself lord as you express this message to us and brought it through a prophet you are expressing your bride and lord we know that it's through that expression of a thought that we had in you and were in you before the world began that when you expressed it we come to ourselves in this hour the only way we could was through that thought expressed in a word we come direct from the thought of god lord and came down into his bodies of clay but lord we're going to leave these bodies of clay because the inside man the rapture has already taken place and already in progress so father we know that we have a new body waiting for us because we know that our name was in that record of eternal life we thank you for this now i ask you to bless your word circumcise these lips to your thoughts alone lord and father i'm not here intending to speak my own thoughts i want to speak your thoughts as you desire it to be may you accomplish your will may you accomplish your purpose in our gathering here tonight may we leave here raised to a higher plane in christ jesus our lord for in christ jesus our lord is everything the full complete realization lord of what we stand in in this hour we now thank you and praise you and give glory and honor to you in advance because we know number one you're present and you have all things in control we thank you jesus in jesus name amen amen his chosen generation isaiah 53 53 53rd chapter isaiah to start with isaiah 53 and starting with verse 1 and then i think we'll jump down to another part of this brother branham referred to this in the message the masterpiece and he said that this is the masterpiece as we kind of broke into that a little bit on sunday we realized that we see both him and her here because that's his masterpiece brother branham preaching the masterpiece took first our lord showing he was god manifested himself all he was in one person the masterpiece then brother branham said god's in the progress of building another bringing forth another masterpiece amen so so we see that that brother branham referred and said to us in this hour that the mystery of god under that seventh seal was in it was unveiled through the bible in a three-fold manner and and we went into those manners and i won't try to do i won't try to bring back so much what we said sunday because if i do that i'll never get through this one so you know you have a tendency as a minister to try to go back and pick up things because it's just all alive isn't that wonderful i know one thing the the word is becoming so alive and and he said it would be like that be just a real fresh outpouring of the holy spirit right at the end upon that body the bride and the word just becoming alive every day i just can't even stay up with it it's just becoming just quick and quick and quick and quick and it's just and you try to you know and it's just becoming one great picture and that is the full revelation of jesus christ and and we're glad that i'm i'm glad that i can say individually i'm a part of that and so verse 1 53 chapter 53 of isaiah who hath believed our report and we know one thing that the bride in this age under her messenger will be the final voice so who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed now i can tell you what the prophet said about that i believe what the prophet said about the word we don't need another interpreter about it because god will interpret his word through his prophets brother braham said we have the perfect interpretation of the word so we need to look around for other interpretation we have the perfect interpretation of the word by divine vindication and so see he said whoever who believes the report is who the report's revealed to that's what he told us he that can believe it believing it is has the faith in him to see it and and to receive it and so who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm and the arm of the lord of course is his word his arm is not shortened you know the scripture on that the arm of the lord revealed now i could take a lot in this but i want to jump down here let's take verse 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed the prophet told us to put your name in there amen and then he's then he goes on to say you know we know he's born our griefs all we like sheep have gone astray and and trying to turn everyone their own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all and then in verse 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment and this is what i want to get to who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken then i want to jump the first 10. yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief now listen when thou shall make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed for he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand you may be seated i'd like you to turn with me the first peter these two scriptures first peter 2. our brother chris had taken these scriptures and and we've taken them many times and we'll probably take them more times first peter 2 and i want to begin reading with verse 7 unto you therefore which believe he is precious and let me just back up a minute i missed something isaiah 53 he said he said who shall declare who shall and the question is who shall declare his generation well the answer was in the first verse that's who shell who is the arm of the lord revealed to is who shall declare his generation so and i'll come into just a moment here that what declare means in generation but in first peter 2 7 it says unto you be unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them now we know who you are you are that living stone you are that lively stone you are that elects amen you are the house of god amen and he said unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner i want you to notice the builders disallowed the cornerstone but now it's become the head amen and i think we're in that day i know we're in that day we had the prophet tell us too many times we're in the head age we've had the headstone come and appear and now is uniting with his body the head and the body are becoming one unit we we covered that pretty thoroughly on on sunday so i won't try to pick that up again but he said the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made the head of the corner and the stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed amen god had some foreknowledge of them and they were appointed to that amen is that right all right now verse 9 but you are a chosen generation amen you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that word peculiar it means a people for a possession and of course the chosen generation is election chosen a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises show forth is the meaning if you want to know the meaning of declare i'll show it to you right now it means show forth make known lead amen so so show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light i want to remind you of isaiah 60 thy light is come yeah and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee amen amen so i'd like you to go with me now to isaiah i'm excuse me deuteronomy i'm sorry i said isaiah deuteronomy i might add we you know we we spoke of that possession of peculiar people in exodus 19 4 moses speaking said you are you are a peculiar treasure moses told the people he said this is the saying of god to you you are a peculiar treasure and we know that this treasure which was once in one person are you with me our lord jesus is now is now in earthen vessels when once it was in one vessel now it's in earthen vessels amen amen so so now we see that it's getting a little loud you can turn that down a little bit reverberating in my ears here all right i'll get louder i'm sure anyway deuteronomy chapter 7. so you can look that up and i don't have time just to save time not go back to exodus this quote that to you but i want to go definitely to deuteronomy chapter 7 a minute now verse 6 for thou art unholy people amen unto the lord thy god the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth so if somebody says you think you're special yes sir by the grace of god i am special i am a special people a people called for his name amen amen so so we are a chosen we are his not just a we are his chosen generation and that goes on to say the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more number than any people you were the fewest of all people amen that is right few there be that find it many are called but few there be amen but because of the lord because but because the lord loved you and because he would keep his oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the lord brought you out with a mighty hand out of what now what are we brought out of dark denominationalism into the light the light shone amen and we are mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt now therefore that now therefore no excuse me know therefore that the lord thy god he is he is god the faithful god which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations amen amen the word declares i already said show forth make known generation the word generation in in in a word is of genealogy it's a series of children or descendants from the same stock same source amen from the same stock and from the same source other words they're the same kind they are a family a generation is a family it can be a family and it is a race hallelujah this is getting good i can't hardly stop now now number six it's a progeny offspring amen it's an offspring in other words many individuals of the same nature kind sort or species in other words a bloodline amen and i want to call it a royal bloodline the bloodline of the lord jesus amen that's his generation amen i'd like you to turn me to ephesians chapter one i've got just quite a little bit of scripture here so just bear with me ephesians chapter 1 and we'll begin reading we've read this many many many times but i must read it again ephesians 1 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us who are we talking about now with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ brother braham said that's not going to be that is present tense amen according as he hath chosen us in him praise the lord his chosen chosen chosen hello chosen generation which according as he has chosen us in him that ought to be enough to say amen and go home and be happy face everything you want to face whatever it is brother brahm said i believe that no christian and nothing happens to a christian by chance amen amen i don't care if you're in ukraine or over here nothing happens to a christian by chance amen amen so according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should see so with nothing of your works it's nothing of your works you can't it's just just jesus alone not jesus plus works amen salvation lays in the lord alone hallelujah it's nothing but the blood that's right nothing i want to say money want to say nothing but blood and my good works no no it's nothing but the blood amen amen it's christ and him alone that's where that's where you stand that's who you are and that's where you come from and this is his generation christ and him alone amen and so and so you see here we uh we find where i'm reading i get going okay chosen us before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love now did he mean that or didn't he mean that are we believers of that amen amen all right all right having predestinated us positioned us replaced us having predestinated or given us the place perdition replacing excuse me having predestinated us unto the adoption of children adoption is also placing place or destinate us unto placing unto adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of your will no so your will's out of it it's a good pleasure of his will amen to the praise of the glory of his grace is his grace sufficient for us to the praise and glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted he hath made us accepted he made you accepted you've already been accepted you've already been received the holy spirit in you if you're born again the dwelling the holy spirit in you identifies you've already been accepted you've already been received hallelujah all right you've already been accepted you've already been which he's made you wherein he has made us accepted he made us accepted in the beloved amen in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath past tense abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence then we don't have to worry about whether wisdom and prudence is going to come along because it's going to be there it's because it's a part of this germ of life this gene of life this person you are on the inside in that third realm that that that spoken word creation that new creature that is jesus christ revealed in you the new birth is jesus christ unveiled in you showing that you were the seed of god you were in god a thought of god the beginning with god before the foundation of the world you were in the first place in him amen and he is eternity amen now having made known unto us the mystery of his will good pleasure to yeah having made known to us the good the mystery of his will i'm thankful for that why do we have the why do we have such a glorious time in the mystery of his will because the mystery the full mystery has been opened the mystery that's been hid that john couldn't write the mystery that john couldn't write has been opened that's why we can come to ourself and see our position so clearly in this hour and walk in it talk in it live in it amen so having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure we know what the mystery of his will was jesus said what the father only knew but brother brennan i took it to you last sunday brother abraham said when jesus was glorified and went up and came back and and brought the revelation in the book of revelation the book of revelation is the full revelation of himself but it couldn't be fully known until the message of the seventh angel because that's what john couldn't write what jesus said he didn't know only the father and he said i don't because it's not given to me now to know it but he said when he came back and the revelation of jesus christ was given to him jesus christ then he said he said there that revelation was made known and brought to the bride amen now that's just kind of everything in a nutshell but you can look it up if you want the quote on it i got it amen so all right so i just want to say that having made known unto us who's us his generation has made unknown unto us the mystery of his will other words we are his offspring we are his race we are his family god is family god always wanted to be family and he's going to have a family and it's going to bring it all back to the way it should have been in the beginning amen that's exactly right all right so going back other words you're going to bring us back to an eden the eden again amen a full restored eden now having made known the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed notice where it was purpose in himself that in the dispensation that's a dispensing notice of the fullness of not time because when jesus came he came in the fullness of time to come through a woman we were we brought that out sunday amen that was the fullness of time but if you notice in the 10th verse here this is the dispensation of the fullness of times we are at the end sirs is this the sign of the end amen all right he said that mystery of that book he said being open that seventh seal brother graham said defines and tells us we have arrived we're at the end amen that's the only time that book could be revealed was in our day all right so he said in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen in whom in whom also we have obtained an inheritance amen amen being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council according to the purpose of him and we'll get into this more as we get into the message here i want to share some of these things with you being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will amen amen no so verse 10 i want you to note here this is something that prophet has said remember he said in the visible union he said remember what time is it sir he was asking people remember what time is it sir how many heard it say amen congregation says amen was it exactly right congregation says amen then we've got the now listen carefully then we've got the revelation in this last days for the message of the lord to gather his bride together hallelujah praise the lord we have the message of the lord in this last days to gather his bride together amen no other age has it been promised it's promise in this age amen now that now we know that that that the the we know there has to come a falling away first amen uh how's that i let me just get that real quick i think that's in um yeah that's second thessalonians let me just read that the way it reads here i didn't plan on this so let me just look at it here let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come that day the day of christ okay that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition now we know who he is amen it's been unveiled to us there shall not come so there was a turning of the point i'm trying to make there's a turning of the corner the churches the denominations put the word out this last day this last day pentecostal move organized move amen which was she came shuck put the word out prophet said it's dead it's dried up the spirits left it amen he said just put the word out there came a falling away but what happened the corner was turned into a bride age not another not a seventh age a bride time a seed time a bright age a raptured time he said amen what are we talking about life is in the grain again amen so there had to come that falling away for this message to be unveiled he said the message of the seventh angel was revelations 10 the opening of the book amen the seventh seal sealed that book that was the others his message amen in the days of the seventh angel the mystery of god the mystery this mystery we talked about here in ephesians would be unveiled yes amen all right so i just want to lay that background a little bit now he says so we have the message of the lord to gather his bride together no other age has it been promised it's promised in this age hallelujah and the prophet said always the messenger always comes at the end of the age amen all right now the purpose of god stands in election you know that the purpose of god stands in election the bible said romans 9 as it was purpose because it was purposed in himself so what he foreknew he elected by foreknowledge are you aware of that first peter 2 said first peter 1 2 said elect according to foreknowledge all right now it was god's purpose and we know what god's heart purpose was if you go to page 149 of the older church age book not the new one that brother george put out but the the older one page 149 the heart purpose of god was to have a bride of his own choosing that was his heart purpose that's quite a statement when you realize the heart purpose of god was to have a bride of his own choosing see because she was chosen in him so he said now he said it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him amen those words just leap at you in him she was foreknown and beloved before she was she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth it's already done thing he first loved you that's why you love him because he first loved you do you realize and get the revelation that he first loved you nothing shall be able to separate you from that love nothing nothing hallelujah amen and so she was she was redeemed by his blood she can never come into condemnation you know what that is judgment she can never come into condemnation she can never be in the judgment how about that she could never be in the judgment oh she'll be there but she's in his throne we're talking about the white throne judgment she'll never be in the judgment why because her book remember in the judgment there were books opened and then another book books and then another book the dead they were books every bit of what they ever did every war everything else was like a book it was right there it was red it was right before them their works everything then another book and those were judged out of that other book are you with me but there's another book not a another book so much but another but a section of that book of life amen there's a section which that's already been opened hallelujah and we are judged by that and those that book of life only contains names and the book the record of eternal life also contains names amen and that's been a mystery hallelujah that's been a mystery but it's been un unveiled in this hour that mystery that mystery has been opened brother madam said what sealed that book christ he christ is those seals then what would be the revelation contained in that book it would be the revelation of christ hallelujah hallelujah amen amen satan hates you if you get a hold of the who you really are you going to fight your tooth and nail because you've done you've done escaped he can't find you even every time he comes up against it the word comes up all right all right so i got to stop these running off these sides here and keep going she can never be in judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her that's romans 4. blessed is the man or the individual that god will not impute sin it can't be recorded against him it can't be imputed it can't be put on this record it can't even be accused because our judge said our judge said the case is dismissed there's no case against you why isn't there no case because there's no record against you amen i'm talking about the generation i'm talking about his people his bride his generation his offspring his race all right so now he said can never she can never be in the judgment because sin can't be imputed unto her this book of his now i'm going to tell you something here this is my words this the excuse me the book of his generation i said it like that which is his bride now i said it like that because you go back to genesis 5 1 and it says the book of the ju the book of the generation of adam then you go back to matthew 1 and it says and it says the book of the generation of jesus christ is that right then we go to revelation 10 2 and there's another book i wonder if the book could be the gener of of his generation his generation you know brother brown said god works in threes all right so he said the book of ice i just i'm writing is my note the book of his generation his bride the original seed spoken word is the original seed hello we'll get into that just a minute the original seed their names are recorded in a book their names are recorded in a book and that book in revelation 10 2 is called a little book a little book and the brother branham said it's called it's it's a section and i'll get that just right here in a minute making it a little book the word the word doesn't god doesn't mince words it's a little book and john was commanded to eat that little book is that right what's that little book contain the hidden revelation that god hid for our day and hour of his coming and his appearance here in the earth the way he said he would now amen amen all right so here now he said the book of the generation it's called in the revelation the little book it's also brother branham called it the bride's book amen the bride's book so it must be the a book of the bride his generation what's her what's where did she come from who is she brother brahm said there's only one book can tell you where you come from and who you are what were the seals open for to show her where she come from how she was in god at the beginning go back to adam and eve we'll find the same thing open the seventh seal opened right there is what's been opened to us the revelation of himself the mystery of himself has been opened amen all right and brother brown said you'll find that threefold purpose right back in eden between adam and eve he said hallelujah all right so so he said so he said the the book he said it's hidden a book tells you who you are where you come from shows you how you'd be in christ and how you'd be revealed here at the end brother braham said that's why the seals open that's what it opened amen what is it revealing christ christ is what the mystery of god revealed and in this message was to reveal the mystery of god would be finished amen amen amen i get a little excited forgive me all right now it's called the bride's book if we go to first john you go to first john with me real quick first john first john chapter 5. read this sunday but i'm going to read it again chapter 5 verse 11 and this is the record this book contains a record this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son and when he made his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed amen verse 10 of isaiah 53 amen are you that seed amen are you the seed all right so he said because he's that seed is that right he's that seed all right so and verse 12. or verse 11. and this is a record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his seed he that hath the seed the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life then this stone will be a stumbling amen because the stone is the word seed revealed amen the stone means revelation that's what is sown in the bible brother man said the rock anywhere you read rock god is my rock means god is my revelation amen all right so so we find then by this scripture we're finding that her name and i'm quoting now what the prophet said her name each of her members amen was written in a section of the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world it was written in a section brother brown said the book of life and the land book of life is the same book that's what he said this is the part i want to get into these things but i can't i can't get into it tonight i want to bring it out later time but he and we did bring in part of this and we'll at tonight even here but each of her members was written in a section there are there is a part of that book whose names can be removed there's did you know that yes all right not this book but the book of life they are there's there's names can be removed from that judas was others are probably even this hour today names removed by rejecting the word amen there's a lot more to be said on that part right there but that's why i wanted to keep it later their names can be removed but there's names that will remain that are not bright they get life that are given life eternal life at the white throne judgment amen but there is a section of this book whose names could never be removed amen section means a little book are you with me all right it's a little book but it's the full revelation of jesus christ it couldn't be written but it is brother brown said but we'll find where it's written because he said you can't take something you can't take that out of the word it wasn't written john was commanded to seal it up but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel it's going to be unsealed because it's now the time for it to be unsealed amen and if that was never unsealed there'd be no rapture for you and i right because he's not complete without us it's the names of his generation it's the names of his bride amen right there so so you see it's important it's got to be unloosed but it's not known to everyone it's just known to the bride alone now i don't know who that bride is but that mystery is only known to her only known to an individual in that body amen and the body of course is a is the is himself by the planting of one seed the purpose of planting the one seed is to bring up a many-membered body of the same seed many seeds are you with me but still one seed for every member of of the body of christ is christ all right so now god is so now each of our members was written in a section of the land book of life before the foundation of the world thus if god so designed that there would be where that there that there be those names are placed in this in a section of the lamb's book of life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept that see why because he's sovereign he chooses by election by shooting me by foreknowledge he elects excuse me amen are you with me he knew he knew every one of them but he can do as he will and he desires with his with his creation he's sovereign amen but he chooses or elects by foreknowledge all right now and that's just the next statement here god being sovereign he foreknew by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and him alone my goodness yeah his eternal possession brother paul it is his eternal possession and him alone she is wholly committed to him and she and he i love this he accepts the obligation he is her head for christ is the head of the church as sarah called abraham lord even so the bride is happy that he is her lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight john 12 24 if you want to turn over there it's one seed i'm just going to reiterate that here a minute in john chapter 12. and verse 24 except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit a grain of wheat is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will reproduce reproduce and multiply itself through a certain process during a certain period of time amen now you can see he's building his bride all right the single seed will die but in dying the life that was in it will come up into a plant which in turn will be the bearer or carrier of that life and we'll go more into this when i go on and go back into the other be the carrier of that life which is to come back to originality in a multiplied form come back to originality in a multiplied form hallelujah all right galatians 3 29 and if he be christ then are you abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise now watch what he said then paul goes on to not only narrow down this his definition but rather to finalize it for in galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with jesus and counted the seed children offspring as children of promise and promises having to do with election or the choosing of god and that is exactly what we've been saying these who are the royal seed are the elect of god now there is to be a royal seed in this hour if you go back to the message this day this scripture is fulfilled he said she's to come on the scene the royal seed to the royal promised son is to come on the scene in this last day it's a promise word for the hour she is to come on the scene amen what's the focus then christ in the formation of his bride amen what's the focus christ in bright form if we don't see that revelation we'll never meet him in the air because this has got to come on unlocked there's got to be a spiritual union take place an invisible union all right now so the seed is the ch is the seed children the children of promise these who are of the royal seed or the elect of god are predestinated for and only god we're in the mind of god and his thoughts see he said christ and his alone christ you are christ and his alone already finished already finished he said the seed was there amen hallelujah the seed was already there when when was the seed there when he went to calvary the seed was already there when he made his soul an offering for seed sin he saw his seed it was already there it's finished you died with him and when he rose up victorious over death you raced with him what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is to have this seed quickened in me to recognize i'm already accepted i'm already delivered i'm already my future my future is clear [Music] clear to where clear to a body change my future is already clear all the way to a body change i'm not saying you're not going to have struggles you're not going to have pressures in your life because it's all building the character of that seed amen but your future oh i don't know if i'll make it or not now with this revelation you'll know you made it or not because your future is clear those that he called him he justified those that he justified he has elsa what glorified hallelujah hallelujah already glorified brother madam said you've already got one waiting for you now who's going to take that out of the hand of god when that was already predestinated by him from the foundation of the world already in him already in his thoughts and all he did was come down here and speak the word and you responded because you always were in the word when he when melchizedek made abraham on the on on when he had the battle of he's you were already in melchizedek in the beginning was the word you were there now you bypassed your theophany comes straight out of the mind of god but you've got to understand you are his attribute you are his thought being expressed in a body of clay today because you always were eternal life amen amen oh let's get done with this i gotta get through this here okay now will you will you bear with me here all right now he said then so in very plain language now listen to this carefully in very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed it was in the mind not expressed how is it going to be expressed by word amen so not expressed until each or each of you you until you came forth in your designated decreed season now this is your season what what expressed you in this season brother branham said he burst his children by speaking his word that's how god brother brad said that's how god borns his children he used the word borns that's how god bursts his children is that in their season he brings the word of himself the word the mind of god the thought of god and expresses it for that season and you hear his word you're able to receive his word he that hath an ear to hear let him hear the word let him receive it amen is that right all right so when the voice is voiced in this hour it's being voiced out through a bride amen because she comes the final voice same voice then who's going to hear it i'll tell you who's going to hear it and show it forth will be that generation because that line of blood that light of blood that life in that blood will speak to other life we are we are absolutely sent here by god to present and to and to and to um uh you represent yes but i mean to um part yes thank you impart life to who believers that's our position for being here that's our calling here in this hour to live out and manifest the word of promise for this day because you're going to catch the revelation of this day and you're going to live the just or justified will live by that faith his faith amen because it was by the speaking of that word for the season you recognize your position he gives birth born through the word by the word amen that's that's scripture first verse peter i think it's first peter 1 23 we are born by what the word of god amen all right now so in very plain language each member came forth it became expressed and an expression is also manifestation of that word so it became expressed and took its place in the body thus the bride is the literal original seed thus the bride is the original a literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in the designation she is also called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came listen to this now here's your generation came from the same source came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god what will it be here in this union it'll be the son of man known again revealed again see the son of man amen think of this message we're taking it too lightly when you realize the son of man is revealed again where is he how do you know it's in me how do you know you have what you have here because it's in me here it is in me and it's making it identifying itself with the word there's my name amen all right so you came from the same source eternal with him and now manifesting god in a many-membered body whereas once god was manifested in one member even our lord jesus christ when i think of it he said denominations just leave amen it just they just pass off the scene when i see god's great purpose god's great purpose revealing himself amen and having first where was his purpose what was his purpose made known in election all right revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people amen amen now where is he do you see him he's here what manner of people are we to be what man or person are we what man or person all we to be we ought to be what we are amen all right now man now now oh he said now the fullness of the godhead bodily is in a people that he should have the preeminence the oversight the leading where's his generation then see you see his generation all right oversight declaring who's going to declare he's declaring it and you're manifesting his declaration all right romans turn with me to romans 8. i'm going through this just as quick as i can now romans 8. romans 8 and let's start with verse 29. listen carefully to the word for whom he did for no of course we all know verse 28 and that's why he said nothing happens by chance to a believer because of that verse 28. for whom he did for no is there anybody here he's for knew your name is on the book you know your name's in the book what do you have to fear the lord is my light and my salvation and whom shall i fear the war should rise against me i'll fear not even fear the war to be a thousand fallen one side and thousand on the ten thousand the other side but it shall not come nigh me satan cannot take you and just do whatever he wants to do with you god has to control it he watches over his word amen amen all right now he said okay 8 29 for whom he foreknew he also he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son when he went to calvary this our son our savior went to calvary he was born he had he had he was both masculine and feminist did you know that you were in him then amen so it's the same person in a many member body it's the same person now in as i said in fullness in his body bride all right now he was you he did predestinate be conformed to the image of his son watch that he might be the firstborn first born what would be the other born his generation the firstborn of many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he had called them he also justified and whom he justified we had already mentioned them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if god before us who's the russians i'm just saying that to bring comfort i'm not saying that to make fun if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's generation who's going to lay anything to the charge of god's bloodline who's going to lay anything to the charge of the bride it is god that justifyeth justify it it is god who declares you righteous amen it is god who declares you righteous amen all right who is he that condemneth all right good question who is it who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yet rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us amen amen amen amen who now watch it is he who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that is risen again and jesus said because i live you live also speaking to just anybody that would know speaking to his bride amen any son is the attribute of his father and this is invisible union any son is an attribute of his father just as you were in the genes of your father physically in the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him so were you sons of god and daughters of god and let me just add this in here in the genes of your father god before there was even a moon stars or molecule you were sons and daughters of god you were you are only the physical manifestation you came directly from the thought to the bot to this earth born under a a natural physical sexual birth that was your first husband that nature that's what the prophet said invisible union that was your first husband but you had that husband had to die and when he died he died you became eternally separated from it and now you have a new nature amen amen you are a new creation because god got a hold of what you were to begin with and said you're not his you're mine and in order for you to be mine he's got to die [Laughter] amen you said yes lord that's exactly what i wanted to do die and you can't have a new birth until you die spiritually dead amen spiritually to that old husband you die to it you have to die to be resurrected all right now so he said for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in god at the beginning for there's only one form of eternal life see you're the physical manifestation of god which is living now in you you're that physical manifestation of that god today amen how many believe god's made flesh among us certainly amen what would he do how does this flesh become his because he quickens it amen he's poured his blood out claims it as his own and then quickens it by his word to his word by his spirit mean to his word amen all right so neither he said that was he said for you for there's only one form of watch what he says here for there's only one form eternal life one form of eternal life and that was you why because you were in god you came to the earth already a part of god and when you heard the voice of god you came to it now you're being manifest in a through a physical body all right so there's only one form of eternal life and that's who you were in the beginning so that one form because you were there that one form of eternal life is you you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you was in your earthly father but you are manifested too in his image in the image of god you were made and you were manifested for his glory and fellowship of god and therefore as sure as your gene had to be in your father how many understand what it's saying as sure as your gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual gene had to be in god because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts oh brother sister what do we have to fear we aren't here by chance just running around we are directed we are controlled we are we are led i don't care whether you and your carnal mind reasons it and can figure it out or not quit trying to figure it out just believe and know know that he's leading and follow give way to him let go and give way to him take up your cross deny yourself and take up your cross and follow him he's leading follow him do you know he's leading then let go follow him let him have his way let him do things at your carnal mind that david i want to do things that david knows nothing about but i have complete confidence in him that he's leading then i can relax and let go [Laughter] oh brother david that's too radical i've got to have something i can put into it i've got something i can do about it if i can't reason it then it must not be god no if you can reason it you better quit your reasoning because you're flirting with another man when you go to reasoning anything about god's word now i'm not saying don't use reasoning you can use your reasoning you reason with things you do things certainly but if it disagrees with the word you better be dead to that reasoning amen or feelings or imagination or reasoning or conscience or memory amen all right oh i have to bypass some of this to get done all right now i got to get done because it's the only shot i got excuse me i didn't mean shot like that but you know it's only anyway all right now your spiritual gene had to be in god because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation world no way around it that's right no way around it that life being in you god's life being in you from the foundation of the world but to the elected god is calling they know it calling the virtuous bride the last day church the elect lady of our lord jesus christ how many believe that if then he's the word you believe that all right then the bride is always part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination when we want to hear the word around us we don't want that dominating female to come around us want that spirit all right then all right then the bride is always a part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination it'll have to be the word manifested to be the bride of christ he promises she's got to be the word the word not for his day he's not the word of his day she's the word of this day amen that he promised would be this day that's you well okay you're separated from unifor by from by spiritual death okay you're remarried again to the by spiritual death you died to that first union you're born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union not of your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life listen now i'm getting these major points that germ that was in you at the beginning found you where is that life where does that germ go from how does it travel what is it traveling through the word a promise for this hour spoken amen amen all right but down on the inside of that now watch what he's saying but down on the inside of that we're talking about that spirit realm down on the inside of that second realm how many know you first realm is flesh second realm spirit amen third realm is the soul all right so he said down in the inside of that second realm is the next realm which is the third realm is the soul and that's predestinated by god brother sister that's where the word opened amen that's why you are the open word you are the secret made manifest god has come in full view of you hid amen you seem you know him but this cannot be known to the public all right see you separated from your first union by spiritual death now that germ that was in you at the beginning found you so down in that third realm is the soul and that's predestinated by god there is where the real seed germ lays is in that third realm is in there let me say what he said on things that are to be he said the real you is the spirit of god the real you is the spirit of god therefore the word you are the word living and in action the bible said in hebrews 4 12 that the word of god is quick and powerful are you with me it's quick and powerful but that word quick and powerful means god means that the word is living and operative the word of god is living and operative that's why the prophet said that the bride is the word living and operative hey amen not just it's not it's not it's a living revelation a living revelation all right your old book is going with gone with your old union you stand perfectly god put it in the sea of forgiveness you stand perfectly before god thank you lord i believe that the bible said that amen your new life is in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate sure it's in the land book of life brother brahm said in a section of it amen are you are you with me here that's why it's such a mystery because she's she is she is a she is a very special person to christ he kept her head he just let it out gradually and said now at the end i'm going to open this thing up and it'll be rapture for amen and it's quite an escasy you know that's rapture a change all right i'm i'm really trying to get done here your marriage certificate where you're true watch what he said it's your marriage certificate where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold now you're not only forgiven but you're justified the word justified is as if not even regarded he said as though you never did it you've never done it amen not even regarded at all how is it done it's in god's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book in marriage is divorced and dead it's not even the memories of god it's not even in the memories of god amen you are justified therefore being justified romans 5 1 being justified by faith all right he said it was you was accused you was accused you never done it you never done it let me say that again ought to get more amens than that you never done it you did this you did that devil's accused you did this you did that which side you're pointing on this isn't the real me this germ is the real me this life that's this seed quick this life that's come alive in me is the real me this holy ghost in me you talk to him about it amen you're talking to me about it i'm telling you you're a liar satan because that book that word already declared me perfect holy and without blame amen holy and without blame justified i never did it in the first place the old union is in the sea of forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with he the bridegroom bore your shame himself took you took for himself for you in your place he took your place you were predestinated for him to be his bride before the foundation of the world the bible said so you are the predestinated seed how did you come to this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent eve it's no fault of your own but that's why you got to be born again see how simple the new birth is if you realize it's no fault of my own and i've been deceived into this thing and now god gives me an open door to come up higher amen amen are you with me why not accept it amen it's very easy to accept not reason no god made it very easy to believe his word he said just accept it claim it believe it accept it quit your reasoning about it quit trying to put your own opinion to it just accept it satan gave the opinion amen are you with me he made it complicated it's just simple just accept it believe it can you believe it amen amen it's your absolute all right you were deceived into it amen it's not your fault it ain't your fault now watch what he says you didn't you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you how can he impart how can he impart anything against the elect when they were in him to begin with if he imparts sin against if he imparts any of this stuff against him he's imparting it against himself he can he can't part sin to himself amen that's why he said just awaken awaken what awakened us the seven thunders that's exactly what awakened us the bride's awakened they have not recognized brother branham said what's been done he said these denominational spirits and everything floating around people they don't they haven't recognized what's been done still looking for it to happen still looking for it to happen he said it already didn't happen what they haven't recognized is the awakening of the bride her book's opened it's uncovered her life's uncovered that germ was to be me amen that germ that was to be me was in him was to be you before the foundation of the world god put your name on the lamb's book of life she is him always was him she only needed to recognize it by this message the word of our day she recognizes her position her positive position in the word for her day and time you are his eternal possession you are his kingdom you are the word made spirit in you manifesting him through this body the promised word made manifest today his race his offspring justified hallelujah i'm closing you are his eternal possession amen that's right watch it's the same holy spirit showing the same things that he did in that body of christ is now embodied in the body of his bride embodied exactly right now embodied in you embodied in his bride same seed same spirit same recognition same realization of who you are same realization of where you came from who you are where you're going that he had in fact she is him amen she is him bone of his bone flesh of his flesh word of his word she is this thought she is the she is a very expression of you are an attribute of god you're here to explain it to express it but manifest it you're not just anybody down here see here's what i'm trying to tell you i'm closing as i said i'm closing and that's not a second or third close i'm closing here's what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its kind that's right amen amen amen there you are every specie will bring forth of its kind you plant corn you're going to get corn you plant the word you'll get the word you plant eternal life you've got to come up with eternal life hallelujah amen but you need to eat the book i want people they just come to church they just do their they do their little categorical thing about coming to church once a week and i've done my duty no you need to go eat the book get along with god in prayer and eat the book feed on the word let him let let god show you what's in that book in the word here amen there you are let him point it to you in the scripture any true revelation will be absolutely vindicated by the word amen amen it's got to be it's got to lay in that word we had a word prophet brother sister he didn't just tell us his own thinking amen that's right okay but you're not married to the prophet the man you're married to the son of man the son of man who expressed himself through a son of man hello that mystery was revealed the message came forth and brother brahm said the lamb opened that book and handed it down to his seventh angel to reveal it to the people amen i quoted that sunday so you want to find out go back and listen amen all right now the law of reproduction brings that is that each specie brings fourth of its kind now i said i'm closing and i'm still preaching aren't i whatever seed started whatever seed that's genesis 1 11 you you recognize that scripture whatever seed started in the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride the true bride christ's seed will come to the headstone amen let me just say this brother brown said we're at the head now this this was preached in spoken words original seed a corner was turned amen and brother madam said here he is he's united the body and him are uniting as one amen and in fact the bride is making up that headstone amen because that headstone is manifested in the bride form hallelujah remember the mystery was inside the pyramid he said the white stone was in there and he said i had to go meet up with that consolation to get the revelation of that and he said that is that seventh seal amen all right he said i had to go get the revelation of what it was amen all right now we're at the head age it's uniting with the body the bride the marriage is come oh no brother david watch matthew 25 10 they that were ready went into the marriage with him and the door was shut are you with me that's not the wedding supper that's the marriage because the door was shut then we had the wedding supper amen they went into the marriage with him they went into marriage they went into union that's what this invisible union message is all about that's what christ the mystery of god revealed is all about christ in you is the mystery of god revealed amen all right so that so they went into marriage then that last one comes in the door shut amen amen hallelujah then we go into a remember what prophet said proving his word he said the rapture is going to the wedding supper he said we're all he said this is the marriage now amen the marriage has come amen amen that marriage is here he said he said the wedding supper the rapture is the wedding supper amen the whole the manifestation of the son of man unites the two together right here and what does that do he said it reveals the son of man again all right now watch what he says and i'm i'm closing and she will be the super she will be the super church a super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him they will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with him where united this is ordered to be united with him what where where is that uniting in the air all right they will be one now brother branham said they are because why he knew the headstone had come to unite no longer twain he said one all right they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we are now living bride is the final voice she is not speaking the wisdom of man or what man's wisdom teacheth but what the holy ghost teacheth amen paul said i did not come to you speaking the wisdom of man amen let's just stand together one more one more thing here now we see the promise being fulfilled boy that's a strong one now we see the promise huh yeah but i'm not yet just a minute now we see the promise being fulfilled christ i want to now i want to make sure we got that now we see it now we see the promise being fulfilled christ the true headship going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word as he did at the first in john 14 12. he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he do also where is his works being done right from the inside exactly right because he said the works
