humor in me he's going to join the other three million people on the oregon coast and uh so um anyway remember them in prayer amen just looking forward as we said our brother i mean our brother sergey holm and happy to see brother vasily home amen so and remember one another in prayer always always it makes a world of difference amen let's just go to our thought tonight and thank you so much brother jay's sister emmy lovely sound of a violin that is just a beautiful thing sister heidi i just appreciate that i want to speak to you tonight once again just following along even though we've kind of stepped away from the book of proverbs uh the wisdom actually all of these things have a root back into the proverbs and so i just pray that you'll see this i want to speak to you tonight on kind of a i don't know how you say it i've got a title and a subject the title being the wisdom of the ages is the wisdom of our day amen so as we look at these things we can go back through the bible and we can find that everything that's happening today i'm not just saying once in a while i'm saying everything that's happening today has a type already in scripture and so by its being into the word of god right by us diving into the word and consuming it you will not be shocked by what is happening in the world today the scripture says that in the end time there'll be wars and rumors of wars and you look my brother and sister of what's happening around us and we see these problems happening all over the world but you know the world's just as much paralyzed of china is going to take over taiwan and china is going to go to africa and the russians are going to do this and and people are are consumed by these fears of these things and and i want to also tell you that can can you hold your bible up amen this bible that just told you that there's going to be pestilence and famine and wars and rumors of wars also said that he would surround his children with a wall of fire that they would be more standing with us than against us he also said in this same scripture that he would deliver us from our afflictions he would deliver us from our fears and that he has a house waiting for you and i now we're gonna choose what portion of this that we focus on what portion of this scripture captivates you well hallelujah i'm going to be captivated by i'm a chosen generation i'm going to be captivated by i'm filled with the holy ghost i'm going to be captivated by the presence of almighty god that he said this work i began in you i am going to finish amen we have a choice the wisdom of the ages is the wisdom of our day and i want to talk to you about it's all about the key amen so let's turn in our bibles as it were acts 7 and 38 to start and why this is kind of a lengthy scripture i i didn't know where to to begin so much because it all just really speaks to me and we see these types that are happening in the day that we're living and by the way brother jason your text that you sent me i tried to get him to come but brother chad lamb is going to be preaching for brother rich at the end of september at their meetings if any of you can go i know that they'll be more than welcome uh to to attend we tried to get brother chad to come our way but he has a very tight schedule and so uh he said he'd be more than happy to come minister for us he says he knows a couple people in the church here uh has met them before amen and he was looking forward to coming and visiting and named some of them even by name imagine that so anyway i bring greetings to you from brother chad amen this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sinai and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto us not a dead oracle we'll touch on some things here in just in just a minute but you know it's it's not a dead word saints it's not something we're trying to pump life into it's alive whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turn back again into egypt now i don't want to keep you standing but i just want to make an emphasis before we move on you see i don't think there was any of them crept out moved away from hid in the bushes while the caravan as it were passed them by and then turned back to egypt physically but they had turned back in their hearts that's what brought them to the middle as the scripture says the wilderness of sin and brought them into rebellion now you think about this saints you can devise the timeline and you can say well it wasn't very long but i want you to think about this in the whole picture of the journey into the promised land that they get into the journey see it's not at the very beginning they're now not under bondage right they've had a deliverance and they're now moving in the journey but their heart actually was where they came from if that doesn't fit the day that we're living in and what's happening in the world around us people are like well i want to serve god i don't want to go to hell but i sure enjoyed whatever you can fill in the blank i sure enjoyed that and if it was legal if i could find a way to justify it i would go back to it think about that saying unto aaron make us gods to go before us for as for this moses which brought us out of the land of egypt we want not what has become of him what happened he went up on the mountain he's in the presence of god and because they didn't have moses they're micromanaging their relationship with god is that the kind of pastor you would want is that the kind of prophet you would want the prophet of god said what god's looking for is rugged christians the ones that can as it were pass through the wilderness without someone saying don't don't don't don't don't but you see just a little while just a short season of moses on the mountain they're already saying we need some other gods we need to liven up everything we need another god we need to do and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice into the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands i'm a pretty good christian i do good things i give to salvation army i give to the red cross i donate time at the homeless shelter i do all these things all good all good things but not a works gospel now look at this they rejoice in the works of their own hands you see we can have and now lord willing we'll tie this together we can have worship that lacks sincerity we can have worship that is as it were a mechanical action it feels good doesn't it feel good come the house of god i mean i just the music before the service i'm back there almost you know another little something the lord gave me on my heart just a few words you know and i feel like coming out here and saying sister emmy play this certain song because i want to sing this oh it feels good but without true sincerity it's just an emotion it's just a feeling yay you took up the tabernacle of mola now we know who molok was right they sacrificed their children to them i'm telling you the god of moloch is alive and pardon me keeping you standing here but right in not our midst here i don't believe but right in our midst people are like well i know the message and we have all of these rules and we have this and we have that but i want my children i want my children to be able to decide for themselves so if my son feels like because he's not converted it doesn't have the holy ghost so if my son feels like piercing his ears in his nose i feel obligated to let him do that till he has his own experience instead of son here's the word and the word says we don't do this the word says we honor this tabernacle the word says but no no we need them to decide for themselves no i'm sorry i'm not like that weird old-fashioned guy that says you know what in my house you're gonna hear truth in my house we're gonna serve god as for me and my house we've rejected laodicea and the modern christian spirit and we're going to speak truth young people expect to hear me tell you truth i don't want to multiply you you might grow up and serve not serve god or serve him in a different fashion that's fine but at least somewhere in the echoes of your mind you'll have heard truth or we can just sacrifice our children to molech and the star of your god rimfun figures which he made to worship them and i will carry you away beyond babylon our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into possession of the gentiles whom god drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of david who found favor before god and desired to find a tabernacle for god the god of jacob but solomon built him a house and house howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will ye build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest heavenly father we just ask you tonight lord as you just move in our midst lord i pray father that you would lord just come and be real before us lord now we know father that you will but lord we just have to present the atmosphere and i pray tonight lord that you would help us lord creating the atmosphere that you would come down and move in our midst and i pray father lord as as uh covet has run rampant around the world lord the pestilence of the end time now lord whether father we look at it as something that is to be fearful or whether we look at it as something that is already overcome what matters lord is that we continue to focus on you not letting the fears of this life not letting the cares of life this knowledge of this life lord be a hindrance to us but lord we ask thy will be done thy guiding hand be upon us tonight anoint us with your wisdom father that lord we can walk lord according to your ways we ask this in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now as you look at this my brother and sister i'll just try and move right along he says heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest and to me this is such an incredible question now i would encourage you tonight to personalize the question don't just look at it as a question in the scripture but personalize that amen that you would be able to say okay what kind of house what house will i build for the lord and we realize my brother and sister now you would look at this and take the word fabricate and that is to take and to build something now there's various uh offshoots of that definition psalm is to take ready-made things or some is to take and fabricate or build or mold or form to create something from scratch but we know my brother and sister that we're not doing something from scratch we are taking the very word of god that was placed in you and i before the foundation of the world now the prophet of god says it's just the water of the word that's coming down and touching the seed that's already in you so the water is what brings life to you so in this we know that it's by the word that we find life today and so we're looking and we have this question what kind of house do i want to build for the lord or maybe we'll put it out something that is actually happening what kind of house am i building for the lord so we can look at our own life and say you know what am i really sincerely coming and taking the word and applying it in its fullness to me see we can apply it in peace and portion and and come and fabricate as it were in a sense the house that we think god wants for us or we can then get sincere and get into the word and find the house that god has the blueprint that he has for your life and in that knowing that we're walking in the will of god we walk in complete confidence uh to be what god has called us to be and so what is the place of my rest you know it's always interesting and and i just take this from the days you know when my parents come into the message and and my mom and dad being you know good methodists at that time uh you know there was something of hunger in them they desired something more and you know they just kept going and as a small child at that time i got to travel with my mother to many meetings here across this valley of different evangelists different men and and you know it was there that when you get to see you get to see someone now this is uh the lord speaking here what is the place of my rest but i want you to see the reflection of his rest is you in rest amen it's when you come to that place where you can as it were let your hair down where you can come into a place of peace and and when christ comes into us and becomes we become that dwelling place and he is pleased to dwell in us and then that comes over and that atmosphere or that holy spirit moving upon us you'll see the change and the demeanor you'll see the change in the atmosphere around a person and so when the lord has come into his place of rest in your life it changes our whole outlook of what life is we're no longer worried about what is going on i have friends my brother and sister they they some christians some not whatever uh and and they are petrified of what is happening in our country right now but we look at it now i'm not comfortable with this myself but i look at this and realize according to the word this must come to pass so i say come quickly lord that means this all must come to fruition it all must come to pass but i'm still looking to the promise of his coming more than i'm looking to the chaos of the world that's bringing this about does that make sense to you amen so we have to just uh focus on this so uh how would we answer this question what kind of house are we building for the lord what what are we constructing are we sitting here tonight and i just speak in this general term are we sitting here tonight consumed with a fear or are we in a position where we are really not caring you see one's just as bad as the other one you're possessed by a fear of what is coming another one you simply don't care you see as christians you are concerned right and i would express the reason of this to say that is the scripture says and the prophet reiterates this we should be sighing and crying for the abominations in the cities we should be sighing and crying for the demise of a nation we should be sighing and crying for the ill that is befalling people as it would be in afghanistan in these countries and right here in our nation uh uh just uh atrocities as it were right here and so we shouldn't be in a place where we are fearful and we should not be in a place where we simply don't care but we should come and by applying this and just putting this before the lord and saying lord i cannot change this situation so i'll give it to you and i will trust you and then we always see amazing results can someone say amen to that we always see amazing results and and you know we look at this and and to take this question that is brought in verse 49 uh what kind of house will you build me now my brother and sister will see how that man with his carnal intellectual thinking uh has come through the ages sister jerry and i a few years ago privileged to to attend brother ivan sister nadia's wedding and then travel on up into europe ultimately going to belgium and preaching for a church there and visiting some old friends and we got to go into these cities like gint and i don't remember the name of some of the others and and cathedrals brother and sister churches that just boggle your mind you know 200 feet to the peak all stone and even my voice sounded good inside there sister jerry's like tone it down buddy and i'm in there oh me and it's just come out so perfect or at least i thought it was but you see this was the house they thought god had wanted them to build the great cathedrals it took thousands upon thousands of man-hours and great funds of the day to craft these great churches and so it was there they built these incredible cathedrals and they called them holy places now saints i'll just throw this in as a tidbit you know the prophet of god talks about being in rome and going through all those deals and seeing those monuments and how that they had been rubbed and touched so much they had to replace it they were hands wore off and feet wore off we actually literally there in some of those cathedrals in ghent we saw such a a great statue probably eight or ten feet tall uh well ten at least ten feet tall it was huge of the apostle paul and there was a little note there that you could make a donation because they was soon going to have to replace his feet for the like fifth or sixth time and and the toes were all disappeared and it was wore away and we got to witness a young woman come in and she put her money in the box and got a candle and the deal to light it and went over in front of this statue and placed her candle and lit it and started crying out i don't know what the language was for sure but she started crying out in great travail and this is what they thought god said build me a house they thought this is what it was all about so it was there they called them holy places but verse 48 says how be it the most high dwelleth not and temple made with hands as saith the prophet see he's not looking for that great big building and the prophet of god even indicted our generation in our nation of these people building these multi-million dollar churches when there would be these that across the nations in the other lands would would don't even have shoes and we had great cathedrals and and you know so you see my brother and sister that it's by the carnal intellect that we think that we're doing something great for god now my brother and sister the prophet of god even makes statements concerning that you know that that uh you know you you build you have a nice church to go through and take care of those things and and do that but you see we need to recognize it's not the size of the church that the man is in but it's the size of the god that's in the man see just a little bit of god my brother and sister will still yield results will it not come on we've all been there just a little bit of god will really bring a result but what happens when we get fully committed we just give ourselves to god we just lay it down on his feet and say lord thy will be done we see prayers answered we see lives change we see questions answered for us very personal things that no one could know but you and god and i don't say this concerning myself because i know this is much broader but we can see how there would be times that people would say you know what we we were talking about this in the car and we got to church and the the minister the pastor whatever preached on that or made reference to that almost as though there was a microphone in our car or in our house and there was my brother and sister and it's called the holy ghost amen and that's when god's trying to come down and confirm to you and i i'm in your midst i'm in the house amen it's not here that it's like well this only takes place when we're at church but my brother and sister he's not looking for the house built with the hands he's looking for that eternal home amen and so you look at that a little of god is good a lot of god is much better and that is what dictates the results can someone agree with me it's when we sincerely now you're going to hear me refer to the word sincerely tonight several times because there is a difference see even the commission that the angel spoke to the prophet if you will be sincere see he couldn't just come i've got a gift god's done this for me and i'm a prophet i'll just come and do this but you see he got results in direct proportion to the sincerity by which he manifested you say well brother paul what do you mean about that well let me give you this for an example the prophet of god under great stress the irs and all of these issues many checks wrote to his name and they were signed off and sometimes signed off and just given to someone else for a need the irs comes along and says you owe us all this money tremendous amount of money for the day when you think about it a hundred dollars in those days is the equivalent to 800 or so or more than 800 today so when people gave thousands imagine the comparison and the stress is so great the phone rings and a prophet of god steps out the door and says tell them i'm not here see by technicality he told the truth but in reality he created a false narrative then he goes to pray for a baby god says i ain't answering your prayer until you take care of this you see my brother and sister god doesn't want us to live a half-hearted half in half out careless carefree he wants us to be sincere he wants us to care you ever noticed now i don't know this happens to you but it happens to me sometimes seems like i go through some of my greatest challenges and i feel just almost like lower than dirt and i'm just struggling to even believe i'm a son of god and then i should even be a pastor and then the phone rings and somebody wants prayer happens more than you imagine the devil he's looking and he says now if i can beat them down if i can beat them and get them in a position where they don't feel like they can i get them condemned they're not going to have any confidence and how could you pray a prayer sincerely if the only thing you can think of is your own mistakes isn't that clever of the devil i want to give him a little praise tonight he's so clever but what he doesn't know is sons and daughters of god are overcoming the complex sons and daughters of god are coming to the place that when the devil starts to rise up and batter them that they actually say you know what it really isn't about me lord forgive me for my weaknesses but it's not about me it's all about you and i'm standing here claiming the blood of jesus christ and so therefore satan you have battered at the wrong door because beyond this door is not me the man in the flesh it is the presence of almighty god and we can move into that because you see as we keep surrendering to god we get better and better if you determine that way greater results i thought i'd get an amen out of that now look here i don't know it seems like a lot of feedback brother alex um now look here and god's only provided place of worship now the place the thing i want to speak about this morning is that god has only one place that the worshiper can meet god only one place through the ages many have sought for this secret place of god through all the ages even job wanted to know where he lived out if i could only go to his house and knock at his door joe wanted to find god's dwelling place because there god and his family is worshiped together in there something inside of us just compels us i want to be in the presence of god there's nothing like walking in the presence of god and just that atmosphere and it's just so easy to just break out into praise and into song and find yourself where it won't you guys won't find yourself in a tractor but wherever it might be you'll find yourself there and there's just an atmosphere there and you know god is in the cab with you you know god is in the kitchen god is in the living room god's there at the washing machine or whatever it might be and he's there in the you know uh cutting hair or working on a house or whatever it might be saints and it's there that we realize you know what god's allowed us to come in the house but not just as visitors not just as spectators but as family and to enter into that and and find that now he says here like yesterday in the message yesterday morning we find out that there is a possibility of a person to worship god in vain with sincere worship you know these are not people my brother and sister that are just coming into church now we witnessed plenty of that in different places and different times when we used to travel the other way to church you would come into town off of 45 or or 12th avenue and you'd come down into town and on sunday mornings in the summertime we'd see the boats lined up in the church parking lot and people walking in and their shorts and their tank tops and their flip-flops i i don't know that i really would say that's sincere by our point of view right but in their heart they were sincere they didn't go straight to the lake they went to church first now we can kind of view that with a little humor right but there was something in them that said it's sunday we need to go to church and fortunately for them their preacher their pastor doesn't preach as long so they know that in 45 minutes they will be headed to the lake and so you look at that see we find out there's a possibility a per person to worship god in vain with sincere worship god has all these things fixed out for us but the thing of it is we have to search to find where they are you see the everyone my brother and sister has a king james bible or even the various uh uh uh translations of the bible they have that bible and they read it and i know people my brother and sister that are very sincere maybe even more so than us about these things but because god has not opened their eye can somebody say thank you lord for opening our eyes in our ears that they read the bible year after year and and it's there they have the same conclusion they go to the same bible classes they go to the same interpreting revelation classes and and they they go and and it leaves them right in the same position and i want you i want you to catch this because it can be a trap to us and by the preaching of the word it affirms what they believe is truth but that doesn't make it so you see what we hear over and over again does not make what we hear truth it's revelation of the word that reveals to us what this scripture is i was just doing a little studying just a side note i was doing a little studying along this line right here and my brother and sister you'll find uh you know like the phrase out of uh psalms i think i don't know 21 22 uh chapter 21 or 22 there uh you know it's talking about god uh inhabits uh the praise of israel and you know we've heard that phrase you know god inhabits the praise of his people and then you have all these theologian-type-minded people rising up saying you know what just say god inhabits the praise of his people is not scriptural and it isn't to take the interpretation from psalms but tell me what is the revelation of that when you draw nigh unto him he draws nigh unto you the prayers of the saints comes as a sweet odor before the throne of god you see we can get so theologically minded and analyzing things that we would say well i don't see this but i want to know not by the theological i want to know by the reality that when we sincerely come before god and we call upon his name he said when you call upon my name i will draw nigh to you i will come into your presence i will respond to you but you say see satan would like to bring it to a place that that we have to put it in a box brother brown says god has all these things fixed out for us but the thing of it is we have to search to find where they are and we concern search blindly my brother and sister intellectually is what i would call blindly and we will come with an intellectual revelation but to come to a place that we truly would take god at his word and he said i will lead you and guide you into all truth i want to know how many of you actually pray that prayer i hope everyone in this building prays that prayer right there lord lead me and guide me unto all truth not just stopping and saying lord let me see more of the message now look i'm not stepping away from the message as in maybe it's not the truth i'm telling you open up the sight the broadness of it all and say lord lead me and guide me unto all truth because my brother and sister we can get so focused so narrow that we would miss many things that god would like to reveal to us but we've closed the door to those things you see the prophet of god brother branham himself never claimed to bring every revelation of our day to us you know i read you the quote the other day about how that gods chose to use the bride to finish or complete the word for this age my brother and sister what is it some say well if brother branham didn't preach on it you have no right to preach on it i i preached a sermon as some services at a at a church and and i got done and and i i preached you know a a kind of a semi confrontational you know i don't like to call it confrontational because it was never intended that way and i had a man come up to me and and say um what right have you to preach that and i said sir i don't necessarily understand what you're saying he said i did a quick search and nowhere i want you to catch the saints nowhere did brother branham preach on that scripture so see in their mind because brother branham didn't preach on it we as sons and daughters of god have no right to go there you know what that's called denominational spirit we want to limit you you've got to stay inside our preset boundaries but i'm telling you what has happened the word of god the holy ghost amen the holy ghost has come down and anointed god's people and opened eyes and opened ears and opened hearts and all of a sudden we realized this scripture right here the prophet preached over and over and over and over again driving it home and he preached this over and over and over again driving it home and then we come under anointing of the holy spirit we realize the scriptures he didn't preach on are dovetailed right to this they're not a conflict they're not a different doctrine they're not leading us away they're not putting anything out but the prophet of god left here in his own word said that god left some of this work for you to do and he says search the scriptures oh man now he was speaking to them in these words in them you think you have eternal life but they speak of me and you my brother and sister do you catch this tonight you yes it speaks of him and you have caught the revelation of that word concerning you and him amen not a conflict a continuity a dovetailing a bringing about an extension of the full revelation of the word for our hour amen not some new doctrine dragging us off to the wilderness but a word confirming in the hearts of sons and daughters of god that we are on the right path and the truth is now being revealed open up because the word says that all the mystery now i'm paraphrasing this but all the mystery of christ will be revealed now does that mean that we will know christ in his entirety never in a zillion years but we're not going to go out of this world blindly in confusion of who we are and who he is god fixed them for us i like that actually because see you can look at that in several ways some people say well there's a very guideline by which you have to do this but you see my brother and sister i kind of like to look at that quote and think you know what god knew that i would come stumbling along hey man it is old paul just stumble along reading something not understanding going on and just can't leave it alone keep coming back somebody says oh i read the bible last year well i made it out of the book of timothy [Music] because i couldn't leave it because every time i got to the end of it i was like go back and read it again paul you missed something and that's how i spent the year going back to the beginning and reading it again you see because god fixed it for us my brother and sister and when we recognize that whatever the confusion of this world do you ever sometimes just feel like your mind is just like too many things yeah that's me most days you know 40 phone calls a day and 38 of them because my car warranty is out you know that's the kind of thing that satan wants to distract you but the thing of it is we have to search to find where they're at and god put in you a desire to search for that paul told timothy to search and to be in season and out of season ready to give a word or hope that was within him amen now look at this my brother and sister now all these things are in there and we find sometimes i like to just come to shreveport where we just have about two or three weeks just to take 30 minutes a night and just on a teaching see just stay right in the word these secret passages and see where we could find out just how to get in now we know the prophet never did this right but he was expressing to them there is a teaching i hope you don't mind some people say you're reading between lines but i can also show you where i'm supposed to amen so i want to be faithful and pray over it not just randomly but you see the prophet of god is saying i want to come and i want to i want to take time and just show you how to get in well i don't know the lord is good to us i had to run to the truck stop today and buy an antenna for a truck and i wanted a certain one and had to just go to the flying j and caldwell to get it and hanging almost right next to i thought it was really paradoxical hanging right next to the antennas is like a 12 or 15 or something piece kit to open any car i was like wow i can go to the truck stop and become a carjacker but it struck me what struck me saints is god has given you an eye i hope you catch us he has given you an eye everything we need to go into the word and where others can't get in god said i give you the ability to go in and open up the word of god and get inside the promise get inside the revelation get inside the word for the hour amen we're not locked out god's given us he gave us this ability to go to the word and to pray over it and then the door opens and we see the word and how it comes together and other people i was just talking to a man actually the school teacher to me brother jason would know uh the little feedlot rob waters that we oh and and rob is a was a teacher when i was just in the seventh and eighth grade and a christian man and we just had this long lengthy conversation started out talking business and ended up talking about the things of god and you know you put little things out and and you know it you just realize they they don't see it you try and hint a little more and they they don't see it and they're not even picked in their interest to say what are you trying to tell me they just go over and go yeah yeah there's all kinds of things in the bible but we don't know what they are for the day well i can't tell you what's coming tomorrow as far as the carnal world is concerned but i can tell you what god will be doing to the bride tomorrow he'll be wooing her he'll be drawing her closer i don't want to get too mushy or romantic but he'll be slipping his arms around her and he'll be loving her he'll be telling her you are mine and i am your beloved oh hallelujah my brother and sister can you see now he says look at this you just watch you follow god's direction there's only one key oh i got too far here take 30 minutes a night just teaches stay right in the word these secret passages see where we could find out just how to get in and you just watch you follow god's direction there's only one key to each door that's right no other key no matter how much it looks like it god has no skeleton key we understand what skeleton key is that's one that opens every lock any lock doesn't matter what it is he's got no skeleton t just one key and now you've got to have that key or the door won't unlock no matter how sincere you are you still can't unlock that door i tell you what saints i don't mean to be bossy tonight but somebody i'll lift the hand and say thank you lord for revelation thank you lord for for being so kind and so loving lord to let me see you not just as a god out in the galaxy somewhere but to see you as a real living god living right here in my presence in fact living in me amen this tabernacle not made with hands amen god didn't come down he didn't want to rest in some holy building as it were he wanted to be in you and i amen hallelujah now you see the word sincere now you go into webster and all these different dictionaries and they have slightly different variations of it but i want to just draw out these two main key words that come with uh uh the definition of sincere and that is genuine and truthful now if we look at the face value of sincerity my brother and sister you'll find this and i pray god never allows me to to be that way and i never come across that way to you but you see the words can be spoken will be true but without sincerity the real depth or life of the words will never take effect or never have an impact upon you are you with me we can like a historian talk about god but you see i don't want a god of history do you i want a god that's real right here i want to talk about a word that has come down in our hour a life-changing life-giving word that is here today and i want to because of what god would do in my own life i want to be able to preach it to you express it to you remind you stir up your pure minds and remember in sincerity because you know one thing i've learned these young people right here all these young sisters brothers they've got a sincerity detector i mean i i think maybe even more so than any generation they have a sincerity detector and they just recognize that these are just words or whether this is true now i like to play games with my own granddaughter and i'll tell her just some just crazy little story sometimes i can get it so right she'll go grandpa's that true but most the time because i'm just having fun with my granddaughter she'll just be like now my brother and sister if we're preaching about an overcoming life we're preaching about being filled with the holy ghost walking so close to god that satan can't get in the car with us and then people walk out of church and say you think the preacher was telling the truth you see we've missed the sincerity factor we've missed the point where people actually think they can live an overcoming life in this day that we're living in and when that is missing then our young people will just view churches and just another activity like going to school or going to the park or going to the pizza parlor but if we can ever reach a point in sincerity that they look and say you know what i see in mom i see in dad i see god is real i see that they're not just talking stories this is real and in that my brother and sister you see then they start to catch the key that they themselves can trust god and they themselves can act upon the word of god and god will do the same for them but you see it has to be in sincerity if it lacks sincerity it will never be effective now the words can be true but lack sincerity but the impact of one who is genuine can you right now off the top of your mind think of someone who's impacted your life that was genuine shouldn't be too hard there's surely i would pray be someone that you literally could say you know what this guy was genuine he was he really and he had it this person wouldn't have to be a guy but i had an impact on my life they were sincere they were genuine and they had an impact now you look at that and you know take that in any form you want that wouldn't necessarily even have to for example be a christian but we'd prefer it to be now see when one is genuine and truthful and as anointed the words that they preach have an impact on us when the scripture says train up a child my brother and sister and when they're older they won't depart from that that won't come from somebody preaching in sincerely to them now i won't come to somebody talking about there is a god it that will come from someone who has a genuine love a genuine experience changing the lives that's why we don't just let anyone uh uh you know teach sunday school you don't let strangers come in you don't hire a sunday school teacher out of some kind of deal out here you don't hire a song leader out of some kind of deal you don't put a piano player or musicians in just out of some kind of deal out here my brother and sister but you'll find in the world we live in that's coming more and more churches that hire their musicians well i wouldn't even go there reminds me of a church service i watched amen about halfway through the song service actually you know you guys if you could see it right now you'd probably find it humorous about halfway through the song service this thing that looked like a sheepdog over there on the drums decided about halfway through the song service that he was going to let everybody know he was there you know below it in the captions was this is what happens when you just hire somebody from a website yeah you see we want somebody who's truthful who's anointed and going to have an impact on us see we don't need a history lesson what we need is genuine words from genuine believers you realize as i shared with you the other day you're called to a ministry did you know saints that your words have an impact on me you say well paul you're you're the pastor you're the preacher no i'm telling you the truth your words have an impact not one of us here is exempt from being impacted by the words that are spoken to us oh god help us if the words are negative derogatory have fear and no faith what kind of impact we're doing you imagine now this is a very poor analogy but it would be just like coming in to church and speaking words and then just slapping everyone you say why do you say slapping them because every negative and fearful word would be destroying the relationship that person has been building with god somewhere along the line every one of those relationships has to be restored that's why young people if i could just speak my heart to you tonight don't look at the human side as much as you look at god because the human side will always have some kind of little failure i'm not talking about pastors and young youth leaders and what going in sinning i'm just talking about you'll see that we can sometimes say oh yeah we'll do that and then time doesn't allow or circumstances don't allow don't get caught up in that look to god look to the word of god and never place your trust in the man place your trust in the word and then have a little bit of grace for those around you if they say yes we'll go do pizza or we'll go here you know uh we'll we'll go to the park and it don't work out and just you have to understand these things it's never so fixed in that realm because we're to look to christ not to a person in their ability in their time but we'll come and find out that if over and over someone tells you we'll do this and it never happens reminds me of a brother one time they were doing some stuff around the yard somebody called him up and they said hey do you guys want to go over here and go to go to this sporting goods store and um and do this and this and and he said oh brothers i can't go and they're like why what and he goes well i told my son if he would edge the yard his boy was pretty little the weed eater was bigger than he is he said i told my son if he would ed yard with the weed eater and i told my daughter if she would take the lawn tractor with the the clipping sweep and would sweep the yard that i would take him to ice cream they said oh you can do that anytime and he said no i promise them they're in the pickup they're driving down the road to dairy queen and his nine-year-old boy says daddy yeah son thank you for loving me you see how the boy saw it he didn't see it as just ice cream he saw this as a mouth and he saw that daddy chose him over some other brothers in going to cabela's you see my brother and sister the sincerity now that man wasn't i don't believe i don't believe he was sitting there going i'm going to impress my son no i can't go i don't think so i think it was sincere from his heart i made a promise to my son made a promise to my daughter i'm going to fulfill that promise even though i want to go to cabela's and spend money i don't have did you see the sincerity of his commitment and his son at nine years old grasped that already and expressed it as daddy thank you for loving me not even hey dad you fulfilled our contract see i wasn't how he saw it he saw it as he's loving me he's loving me see we have to have sincerity now i want to just hurry along here it's time to close mighty god unveiled before us brother branham says i was reading a story some years ago and in this story it said a great noble king i forgot the name of him just now i wasn't thinking about speaking of the story it perhaps fiction but it leads to a point that gives us a background on what we want to say this king he was such a noble king and such a great lover of his subjects till one day before his guard and his royalty he said today you see me for your last time for many years and his garden is noble said to him good king why do you say that are you going to a foreign country somewhere to become an alien and he said no i'm staying right here well said i'm going out amongst my subjects i'm going to become a peasant i'm going to cut wood with the wood chopper i'm going to till the ground with the toiler i'm going to prune the vines with those who prune the vines i'm going to be one of them in order to get a better acquainted with what they're doing and i love them and i want to be more acquainted with them personally they won't know me but yet i want to be acquainted with them in that way and the next morning with his delegates and all these people seeing him or the ones that was in the palace take off his crown and lay it down upon the seat the throne and take his robe off and put on peasants clothes and walk out among common people now in that little story they find out then about god and they said to the king king we want you we love you we want you to remain king but he wanted to become one of them to know them better that they would know him better really what he was it would display to them what he really was and that's what god did he changed himself from being jehovah god to become one of us that he might suffer he might taste death he might know what the sting of death was to take the penalty of death upon himself he laid aside his crown in his robe and become one of us you see my brother and sister he made a promise and he was sincere about that and he said you know what i'm going to do what it takes to redeem you and he saw this whole story and he said this is what i'll do i'll come down and i'll walk the barbershop i'll walk and sit in the truck i'll go work at the hospital i'll go and work in the steel shop i'll go wherever it is that they're at and i will toil with them and i'll make myself known that i can know them and they would know me that's the kind of god i can serve my brother and sister not not a god far out beyond the galaxies always just a few million light years beyond the eagle nebula it's hard to relate to a god like that but when you can sit there and saints these things happen in my life i know they happen in your life you can be sitting there and in your heart burdened over something and praying about it and within just a few hours the solution the answer has come and you know that god is listening this is not chance look saints if this is chance let's just go to las vegas i'm sorry to say it that way but if it's just chance if we just have great odds to speak i'm a winner i'm a winner and go to vegas and be a winner no no this is a god who hears our prayers here's our cries because he knows my brother and sister not just in a figurative way but in a real way he knows us he dealt tense with the poor well let's go back up he laid aside his crown his robe become one of us washed feet with the lowly dwelt in tents with the poor slept in the woods and in the streets with those that were under privilege he became one of us that he might understand us better that we might understand him better now we're leading up to a thought here okay this is all just the part i just when i'm reading it i just couldn't cut it off i just i was like oh my this is beautiful thank you lord stir in my heart amen now i think in that we find out that changing himself what he did if you'll notice he cometh the name of three sons he come in the name of the son of man and the son of god and the son of david he come as the son of man now in ezekiel 2 3 jehovah himself called ezekiel the prophet the son of man the son of man means a prophet he had come to he had come that way to fulfill deuteronomy 18 15 which moses said the lord our god shall raise up among you a prophet likened unto me he never called himself the son of god he referred to himself the son of man because he had to come according to the scripture see now do you understand that amen he had to make those two pieces of torn paper the old testament prophecy and his own character to be exactly the same so he come the son of man come in that form then we find after his death burial and resurrection he come on the day of pentecost as the son of god the spirit in the form holy ghost what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to his people in a different form like the holy spirit now i want you to catch this because there are some people we have dealt with and i'm just going to be blunt i'm tired of beating around bushes there's been people that have come and went in this church that actually said no you don't understand the godhead but it's right here saints like the holy spirit which is god it's not some other something it's not whatever the holy spirit is god and you say well brother paul that's elementary but that's because you have a revelation it obviously is not elementary to some people because they're saying no no no you're saying god and it's the holy ghost hmm well okay that's fine and i'm not mocking them but i'm just telling you saints there's spirits out there that will contest the word with you even though it's right here in front of them he come to deal through the church ages as son of god the holy spirit but in the millennium he comes as the son of david to sit on the throne of david king he was to take the throne of david he was on his the father's throne now and then he said he that overcometh will sit with me in my throne as i've overcome and said on my father's throne so he in the millennium he'll be son of david what is it the same god all the time just changing his mask i am to my wife a husband [Music] now here's i read all of that to get to my point because i thought that was beautiful did you notice the syrophoenician woman said now son of david have mercy he never even bothered him at all she had no rights to call him that see she had a key and she was trying to unlock something but it was the wrong key and you'll see that it appeared that our lord jesus was entirely indifferent to her and the reason we would feel like he was indifferent is because we're looking at this through our own human element i would never offend you i would never offend you i'd never offend you so even though you didn't call me correctly i'll answer you anyway god said no you have to have the right key and i am god and i change not so i can't go for generations and force you to have the right key and make a compromise here and then come back and make you have the right key again he said you'll have to have the correct key but have you noticed one thing the scripture says he will never forsake his own he'll never leave them begging bread so what does he do we in our human element say we'll compromise and let this be this way because we don't want what god do no i'll come and i'll anoint you to get the right key instead of compromising on the word instead of changing everything around making some special revelation or exception for the laodicean age god says no what i'll do is anoint my children in laodicea and i will lead them over here and i will by revelation give them the correct don't have to break the whole form of time and eternity to compromise for laodicea because it's such a horrible day no sir i will raise my people up and by revelation bring them and put the right key in their hand and anoint them to use the key and look what god did right here she had no claim on him as son of david he is he is the son of david to the jew now he come but when she called him lord there was no chasing her away there was no offending her there was no her saying i'll have you to know i've been in this message for 35 years no sir he anointed her to change her vocabulary he anointed her to change her approach to him she anointed her to come under that umbrella of the word and to fulfill the word according to the day that they were in and there she was anointed he was her lord then she got what she asked for now let me just put it this way as i would close amen when you come your declaration is i'm unworthy wrong key when you come and you speak all of these negative things remember the prophet of god said don't speak the devil's language you realize saints what the devil's trying to do he's trying to get you to take and put that key in there and rattle that thing and try and unlock it and try and unlock it and then we get discouraged because it's not unlocking the door is not open the power of the word is not coming being as it were dispensed upon us and and then we get discouraged and say god's not hearing my prayer i've heard that so many times saints people say god's not hearing my prayer but you're putting the wrong key in the lock and when you come oh i'm not worthy i'm not worthy the word says you're worthy the word says you're called the word says you're his wife oh my my brother and sister if he doesn't want us to approach him like a beggar he wants us to approach him like a wife now we can make all kinds of jokes and there's a little humor in my heart right here amen you never see my wife now look i say this just to make a point you're not going to see my wife coming begging she doesn't approach me that way she comes and says we need grocery money we need this we need that let's do this you know what's here i hope none of you brothers make your wife come honey the cupboards are bare the kids are starving their clothes are falling off because we're all so hungry please give me ten dollars no sir i think i know most you sisters you won't even talk to them you don't claim it come on are you following me tonight a little humor doesn't hurt us but but you know we're not to come as beggars the bride the wife look esther we've used that example before you so many times my brother and sister esther you go before him you go before him and if he don't receive you then esther you'll be banished to the back side of the deal and nothing but a concubine and you'll never see his face and i don't mean to be crass or crude but you'll never occupy his bed which is just a sign of intimacy you never have intimacy with him ever again that's a dire situation isn't it but i'm his wife i'm not just a queen i'm his wife and i have rights and i know where i stand i know where i stand when he calls me i come and when i have needs i also go before the throne you see my brother and sister what happens is is we have to approach it with the right key i can still i'm sorry i'm infatuated my mind esther is just this gorgeous girl and i don't mean it in a crass human form i just mean she had character she had all these things that would just be so desirable and i can see her she didn't come and lean on the post at the end of the deal there kind of flaunting herself like it is today i like this now some of you are probably guilty of this i'm not picking on you but don't you like it today so you get four or five young ladies because you don't see young men doing this young men have a whole different culture but you see four or five young ladies together and invariably one of them will be on the end and she'll be like i don't know what the deal is about the toe on the ground and the knee bent and i don't know what it is can you guys explain that to me but i want to balance this out i'll tell you what you'll see you'll see the young men invariably they'll be the one in the middle he's just there and everybody got their arms thrown over him and on one end or kind of next to one end will be the one guy over there everybody knows what he looks like everybody knows the real him but it's like i've got an image i've got to project and then 30 years later all these people will be gathered together and they'll pull this picture out and they'll go oh nobody says anything about the guy with the chubby tummy in the middle with all the arm straight around and they'll look down on the other look at him because he'll now be the fattest guy in the group but what is the key our correct approach to god not as beggars not as servants but as the bride of jesus christ there is our approach saints approach him with confidence not arrogance amen hallelujah you see because god it's not hiding somewhere in the galaxy sister emmy would you come god's not hiding off in the galaxy somewhere saints where's bride that's the way the word calls us in this day we're the bride and you know what that makes him bridegroom amen i'm telling you you go look it up there's some lovely quotes brother brown's talking about the honeymoon he said at least they should still be on the honeymoon this bride should still be in her honeymoon she should still be so in love this is my lord this is my provider my protector and i tell you what i think it's so wonderful i'm sorry brother ivan sister naughty but you know i just remember just the very afternoon that brother ivan and sister nadia got married and then they're standing there and here's brother ivan you know his sister nadia i don't mean to pick on you you know i love you my brother ivan's got his arms around the sister nadia's shoulder [Music] and it's drilled in my memory dare the man that would walk up right now and insult her trying to do something sister nadia she has a protector got to protect her and that's what we my brother and sister we're not here just people on this earth we have a bridegroom we're in the start you might say of this great lovely relationship this honeymoon we've got a protector we've got a provider he loves us in fact he's wild about us he's crazy about us and he'll do anything he can do for us my brother and sister that will let him you see i hate to admit this but sometimes it wouldn't hurt us men maybe read one of those romance books [Music] yeah all the young men back there are like whoa no no way well i'll tell you why i would say that because if we're not careful we lose the romance i'm not talking natural things i'm talking spiritually sometimes we lose the romance of just finding yourself sitting in your house in the car somewhere [Music] and just tell them i love you i love you so much i thank you lord for everything you've done for me lord you're so good to me you provide for me you see we lose that romance and we get cold and dispassionate almost like some marriages and it's just like yeah i love you come on saints this is a love affair let that be one of the keys that you approach god a soft heart a tender heart expressing from your heart lord it's not about i see the seals are open i see the church ages i see this chosen place of worship i see this and i see this [Music] but just simply to come to the place and put the key in i'm your wife i'm your wife and i love you man i'm so thankful that you chose me of all the people you could choose lord you chose me and put the romance as it were back into our relationship with the lord brother branham talks about i'm closing brother brown talks about old cold dry confessions [Music] now i say this a little bit but to drive the point home to you [Music] a couple been married for many years one day the wife comes to her husband she says honey you never tell me anymore that you love me the man stood there for a few minutes and he says well [Music] i told you i loved you on the day we got married and i guess if anything changes i'll let you know that's not our relationship with the lord that might be something that works in the world we live in today in a cold formal relationship with god but saints you're his bride let him know how much you love him let him know how it stirs your heart put the key in the door and unlock a closer relationship not a cold formal relationship but a relationship that if i could dare put it in these words a passion rising in you i have an opportunity not oh i got to pray but to say i got an opportunity to tell my bridegroom tell my lord i love him and i thank him for what he did for me today i thank him for the life he's given me i thank him for overcoming power i thank him for predestination that chose me before the foundation of the world i thank you lord and i want to just ask you as we close what kind of house are you building now i don't want you all go home sad now but this is a love affair you hold the key to the intensity of that love affair no one else holds the key prophet doesn't hold it pastor doesn't hold it no one else holds it but you you have the key to the intensity of this love affair with jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah oh lord you are so precious to me let's just stand worship the lord for a moment hallelujah i had no idea where the time when saints forgive me brother jay please help me [Music] [Music] to me and i love you [Music] if [Music] so gracious to me [Music] lord you are so great to me and i love you yes i love [Music] me [Music] and lord you are so faithful to me lord [Music] so faithful to me and i love if just let him know how precious he is lord you are so precious to me lord you are so precious to me and i love you yes i love you [Music] hallelujah hallelujah my redeemer is faithful and true hallelujah let this be a testimony as we dismiss tonight amen let that come from your lips a word of confidence spoken my redeemer is faithful and true he's always proven himself over and over and over again to be my provider amen to be my healer give my give me revelation give me understanding give me strength and when i feel discouraged and downtrodden he comes and he just simply wraps his arms around me and this reminds me your mind i chose you i love you and i'll never let you go oh what a feeling of peace and joy just flows sweeps over your soul when that voice just speaks down deep within you it says i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you just trust me just love me oh what a feeling what a feeling [Music] oh my my redeemer is faithful and true yes you are everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and true as i look back on the road i travel i see so many times he's carried me through and if there's one thing i've learned in this life my redeemer oh my faithful and [Music] everything he has said he every morning his mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and true my heart rejoices when i read the promise there is a place i'm praying for you and if there's one thing i've learned in this life my
