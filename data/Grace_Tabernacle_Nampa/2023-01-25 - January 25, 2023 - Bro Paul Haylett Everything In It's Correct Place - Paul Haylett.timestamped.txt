[15:58] number 1037 God in the valley you know I
[16:01] was just driving into town today
[16:03] I'm at a meeting with some people and uh
[16:07] song came on my heart started singing in
[16:10] the car
[16:11] I started to think you know
[16:13] we're up on the mountain
[16:16] I climbed mountains you know when I
[16:19] lived up in Washington for years did
[16:20] mountaineering and backpacking and those
[16:22] things
[16:23] when you're sitting up on top of a
[16:25] mountain a lot of times you look back
[16:26] down at the way you came up look at that
[16:30] path that route that plan that you had
[16:34] when you're down in the valley
[16:37] sometimes maybe you don't understand
[16:39] that plan but when you get up there and
[16:41] you can look back down on it
[16:42] [Music]
[16:44] just struck me you know sometimes when
[16:47] when that storm pushes us off the
[16:49] mountain pushes us back down to the
[16:50] valley sometimes we kind of forget that
[16:52] route
[16:53] it's easy to get lost in that storm you
[16:56] know maybe the fog whatever
[16:59] never forget that path
[17:01] I had a Bible here I'd hold it up that
[17:04] path
[17:05] that gets you back to the top of that
[17:06] mountain never forget that
[17:09] and one other thing that I thought about
[17:11] was back when I did that you know
[17:14] sometimes you'd do part of your hike at
[17:16] night maybe early morning the dark hours
[17:18] and you can only see as far as that
[17:21] headlamp
[17:22] as far as that goes and sometimes you
[17:25] don't know
[17:26] what's five feet past that
[17:28] could be at you know a thousand foot
[17:30] cliff it could be a lot of different
[17:32] things but the scary thing is sometimes
[17:34] in the day it's worse when you're up on
[17:37] that Glacier and it's white and that fog
[17:40] sets in
[17:41] never let that confusion get to you
[17:44] stick to the path
[17:46] if you stick to the path
[17:48] you'll always find your way back to the
[17:50] top amen
[17:52] amen
[17:53] life is easy
[17:57] [Music]
[17:58] when you're up on the mountain
[18:04] and you've got peace of mind
[18:10] like you've never known
[18:14] [Music]
[18:16] but then things change
[18:21] you're down in the valleys
[18:27] don't lose
[18:32] because you're never alone
[18:37] with a god of the mountain
[18:43] it's still God in the valley
[18:49] and things go wrong
[18:52] [Music]
[18:55] he'll make them right
[18:58] all right
[19:00] and the god of the good time is still
[19:07] God in the bad time
[19:11] the god of the day
[19:16] is still God in the night
[19:21] [Music]
[19:23] talk of faith when
[19:28] we're upon the mountains
[19:34] all come so easy
[19:39] when life's at its best foreign
[19:47] [Music]
[20:06] for the god of the mountain
[20:12] he's still God in the valley
[20:18] when things go wrong
[20:24] he will make them right
[20:29] look out of the good time is still God
[20:36] in the bad time
[20:40] the god of the day
[20:45] is still God in the night bye

[35:08] hey man aren't you glad you can sing
[35:10] that from your heart
[35:12] amen yours a lot of things that man
[35:17] desires and asks for
[35:20] but I think the greatest and most noble
[35:22] thing that we can ask for
[35:24] is more of our Lord Jesus Christ have
[35:27] him sweep over our life
[35:30] be under the shadow of his wing
[35:33] I just uh for just a second here this
[35:38] evening I want to just
[35:40] bring a tad bit to you and you know
[35:43] something uh sometimes you know we
[35:47] struggle with how to express things and
[35:49] a lot of times we don't speak things out
[35:52] because we're kind of nervous about the
[35:55] reaction
[35:56] and um I think that we ought to get over
[35:59] that we're brothers and sisters in
[36:01] Christ we're the family of God and
[36:03] there's nothing that we're shaming
[36:05] there's nothing that we're putting down
[36:07] in fact we just do our very best by
[36:10] God's grace to lift up and we uh visited
[36:14] Sister Miriam uh there in Meridian a
[36:19] week ago a week and a day ago
[36:23] and um our dear sister was in a very
[36:26] dark place just a very difficult place
[36:30] and
[36:32] um
[36:33] you've been praying for her
[36:35] and we've been praying for her and
[36:37] sister Jerry and I went last night
[36:40] and it was our sister Miriam
[36:43] that was sitting there
[36:45] we walked in the door to the visiting
[36:48] room and she was so happy she just just
[36:52] was bubbling
[36:53] and just over and over saying oh I'm so
[36:56] happy to see you tonight and let's
[36:58] continue to pray they have evaluation
[37:02] you know sometimes and this is the part
[37:04] I maybe struggle to say sometimes we we
[37:09] have faith we believe
[37:11] one thing that Sister Mary kept speaking
[37:14] over and over my God's in control he's
[37:17] in control he's in control
[37:20] but
[37:21] we just want to encourage our sister you
[37:24] know sometimes our bodies get a little
[37:27] out of balance and little things happen
[37:29] and I think they would describe this
[37:32] chemical
[37:34] but uh anyway let's just be praying for
[37:37] our sister that God would just
[37:39] completely touch her because my brothers
[37:42] and sisters those valleys can be pretty
[37:46] deep sometimes they don't look like a
[37:48] valley they look like a canyon and
[37:50] canyons are very closed in feel very
[37:53] confining but by God's grace she should
[37:58] come home tomorrow
[38:00] and I know her children she shared her
[38:03] children are like Mom when are you
[38:04] coming home so let's just lift her up in
[38:08] prayer keep lifting her up that this
[38:09] will just all settle out
[38:11] very well for her amen
[38:16] this afternoon sister Sue calling
[38:19] sharing with us at the VA they put him
[38:22] in brother Dan and I see you and the VA
[38:26] decided that this was beyond
[38:30] um for whatever reason we don't know
[38:32] those details but they sent brother Dan
[38:34] to Saint Alphonsus and
[38:37] um it was there that uh the words that
[38:40] they used as they they might have to uh
[38:43] how did they word that Jerry
[38:46] uh
[38:47] anyway
[38:49] when you interpret that it means they oh
[38:51] they were going to mechanically remove
[38:52] this that was the term in other words
[38:54] surgery and they did do that the lovely
[38:58] thing is is
[39:00] um you know kind of different to see how
[39:02] things work out
[39:04] um sister April
[39:05] it's on shift in the hospital
[39:08] and I told sister Jerry I says now if
[39:10] you and I walk up to the ICU and they're
[39:13] going to go bye sister April she just
[39:17] pushes the button and walks on in so she
[39:20] was able to go sent me a lovely picture
[39:22] of her and sister Sue she gave a hug
[39:25] prayed with her and so the Lord works in
[39:28] mysterious ways so just a real
[39:30] encouragement and then uh sister April
[39:33] also you know she has to be careful not
[39:35] to abuse that position but she's also
[39:37] able to inquire and brother Dan's out of
[39:41] surgery and the doctors believe all is
[39:44] well so we thank the Lord for that so he
[39:47] still has you know issues of blood
[39:49] thinners and different things that they
[39:51] have to do so just remember brother Dan
[39:54] for this back surgery just had now this
[39:57] issue and certainly our wonderful sister
[40:00] Sue remember her in prayer just keep
[40:03] lifting her up Sister April tried to
[40:05] convince her to just spend the night
[40:07] with her but
[40:08] she has a dog and needs her attention
[40:11] you know sister Sue I don't have to
[40:13] explain it so she had to go take care of
[40:16] the dog and uh those of you know Sister
[40:19] Rebecca page Peterson Paige I know
[40:22] Sister Sarah has been very good friends
[40:23] with her through the years uh sister
[40:26] Rebecca has had some struggles in life
[40:29] when we were there in Phoenix I was very
[40:31] encouraged as we walked out of the
[40:33] sanctuary to see her there in the foyer
[40:36] having watched the service been right
[40:38] there on the screen and because of our
[40:41] connection through the years I made a
[40:43] little comment to brother Ron how it
[40:45] made my heart so happy to see her and he
[40:47] was sharing with me how God's been
[40:51] willing her back
[40:54] the devil that Sly old Trickster
[40:58] but he is no match
[41:00] when our Lord starts wooing a son or
[41:04] daughter of God back
[41:06] and so definitely lift sister Rebecca up
[41:09] in prayer uh
[41:13] I want to speak to you tonight
[41:14] everything
[41:16] in its correct place
[41:18] and uh
[41:20] you know we just thank God thank you
[41:24] um and Amen brother Alex playing the
[41:28] piano brother Isaac song leading just
[41:30] appreciate that
[41:32] you know the Lord's blessed us I was
[41:34] just sitting down counting my blessings
[41:36] the other day and that didn't look like
[41:38] a rosary bead and uh but I was just
[41:41] counting our blessings and you know we
[41:43] have so much talent in our church
[41:46] my the Lord is just peeling the layers
[41:49] of the onion off and the talent is just
[41:53] coming out and I say thank you Lord and
[41:57] last but not least before we go into the
[41:58] service I am happy
[42:02] to see
[42:04] you home
[42:05] lots of emphasis on home
[42:09] but brother Sergey just shared their
[42:14] Hickory Bible Tabernacle
[42:16] um some of the details of Ukraine and
[42:20] those things so if you find a moment you
[42:23] can go back I believe last Wednesday I
[42:25] thought brother Sergey just did a a
[42:28] lovely job and it's a difficult it's
[42:32] actually a difficult thing to approach
[42:34] because uh there's there is just such a
[42:38] multitude of influences and different
[42:41] things involved that it'd be really hard
[42:44] to set in front of a group of people and
[42:47] just explain it and brother Sergey I
[42:48] thought you did a wonderful job
[42:51] um and uh we appreciate that let's just
[42:53] stand as we go into the word tonight
[42:56] um
[42:57] uh turn in our Bibles to Luke 19 and 29
[43:01] we'll read to the 40th verse
[43:04] and um I hope I believe it will but
[43:09] sometimes you just have doubts when you
[43:11] have you know Giant Steps between
[43:13] thoughts and I just pray that the Lord
[43:16] just uh just leads his dear children
[43:19] along tonight amen
[43:22] Luke 19 and 29
[43:26] and it came to pass when he was come
[43:29] nigh to bethesia and bethenia at the
[43:32] mount called the Mount of Olives and
[43:36] we were just there
[43:39] a few days ago
[43:41] bye a lot of days ago time is flying so
[43:45] fast
[43:46] called the Mount of Olives and he sent
[43:48] two of his disciples saying go ye into
[43:51] the village over against you
[43:53] and the witch at your entering ye shall
[43:56] find occult tide whereon yet never man
[44:00] sat
[44:02] now all the Cults I've ever been around
[44:04] in my life that a man never sat on were
[44:07] dangerous to get on
[44:10] amen so I just want to plant that little
[44:12] thought to you that um well
[44:16] God's got everything in its correct
[44:19] place
[44:22] did you find a cold tide where on yet
[44:25] never man sat loose him and bring him
[44:27] hither and if any man asks you why do
[44:31] you lose him thus shall ye say unto him
[44:35] because the Lord hath need of him
[44:39] and they were sent
[44:41] went their way and found even as he had
[44:45] said unto them
[44:47] now is that any Marvel to us
[44:49] that it would be just exactly what our
[44:51] lord Jesus said
[44:53] any Marvel
[44:55] and as they were losing the cult the
[44:57] owners thereof said unto them why Lucy
[45:00] the cult and they said the Lord hath
[45:03] need of him
[45:05] and they brought him to Jesus and they
[45:08] cast their garments upon the cult and
[45:10] they set Jesus there on
[45:12] and as he went they spread their clothes
[45:15] in the way and when he was come nigh
[45:18] even now at The Descent of the Mount of
[45:20] Olives the whole multitude of the
[45:23] disciples began to rejoice and praise
[45:25] God with a loud voice for all the mighty
[45:28] works that they had seen
[45:31] saying blessed be the king that cometh
[45:33] in the name of the Lord peace in heaven
[45:35] and glory in the highest and some of the
[45:38] Pharisees from among the multitude said
[45:41] unto him Master rebuke thy disciples and
[45:45] he answered and said unto them I tell
[45:47] you that if these should hold their
[45:50] peace the stones would immediately cry
[45:54] out Heavenly Father we ask for your
[45:56] blessing upon the service this evening
[45:58] thankful father to have a part of the
[46:01] body return back to us father just ask
[46:04] you Lord Jesus to just touch us tonight
[46:07] in your precious name amen you may be
[46:11] seated that was one thing I wanted to
[46:13] mention to you that about brought me to
[46:15] tears was to have our sister Miriam
[46:18] sitting there and and we are telling her
[46:21] that our desire to come and do and she
[46:25] said it was so happy because
[46:28] you are the only family I have and that
[46:32] is really what we want the atmosphere
[46:34] that we live in and we project as as a
[46:38] body of Believers to to not just be
[46:41] individuals just brushing by but to
[46:43] literally have a desire or feeling for
[46:46] family
[46:47] amen now as we look at this tonight I
[46:49] just want to Dive Right In and we look
[46:52] here and as Jesus is speaking to them
[46:54] and they come and they're there at the
[46:56] Mount of Olives and at the time of
[46:59] Jesus's time I did a little reading on
[47:01] this and the whole Mount was there
[47:04] covered with olives we had been up at
[47:07] the top of that um I guess you'd call it
[47:09] Hill it didn't qualify as a mountain but
[47:12] you're up there and
[47:14] um the guides had and brother George had
[47:16] arranged
[47:17] photographer uh there I think the man
[47:20] frequents that area of a lot and and uh
[47:24] quite a good photographer I mean a guy
[47:26] jumped up on a rail hanging onto a light
[47:28] pole leaning out just the right picture
[47:32] but then as we went down we visited a
[47:35] few little sites there was uh I don't
[47:37] remember what the name of that uh
[47:39] building and stuff was that we were
[47:41] there and went on down and here we come
[47:44] to uh the area that is reported as it
[47:48] were to be the Mount of Olives the place
[47:50] where this took place and you look at
[47:53] this and now it's just like seems like
[47:55] what's happening in the world just a lot
[47:56] of houses and twisty windy streets there
[47:59] a lot of traffic a lot of noise but you
[48:01] know if you can just stop and in your
[48:03] mind realize that how accurate things
[48:06] are really doesn't matter because our
[48:08] Salvation is not based upon that mount
[48:10] but we can go there and it makes it real
[48:13] to you as we sit in this Garden of olive
[48:16] trees and we're standing there enjoying
[48:19] a little talk that brother George shared
[48:21] and and uh the guide a few words and and
[48:24] you're there and you're just thinking
[48:26] how it must have been for our lord Jesus
[48:28] to have a little sanctuary as it was a
[48:31] little place that he like to come and
[48:34] maybe sit there in the shade maybe rest
[48:36] and but yet there is a supernatural that
[48:39] has taken place on this Mount and as we
[48:42] look at that my brother and sister the
[48:43] Supernatural That's taken place on the
[48:45] mount didn't stop when Jesus left not
[48:50] Supernatural was there it's in the
[48:52] natural it's in the spiritual it's in
[48:54] the types of the word that is presented
[48:57] to us and we can see what God is doing
[49:00] and how that he brings things about now
[49:03] let's just tie this together here is a
[49:06] village Jesus says you go over here to
[49:08] this village now there's very much a
[49:11] chance that Jesus had walked through
[49:13] that Village and that in a way is
[49:14] irrelevant because the fact is that he
[49:17] knew my discernment he knew my divine
[49:21] revelation that there was a cult and
[49:23] where it was tied and so as he's
[49:26] speaking to the disciples he's sending
[49:29] them on what seems to be a very simple
[49:32] little trip but my brother and sister
[49:34] was actually a divine revelation of God
[49:37] that was starting to be unfolded at this
[49:40] point in time and so he tells them you
[49:42] know what you go to the village and as
[49:44] you walk in the village there will be
[49:46] the cold but this is a part that strikes
[49:49] me and he is there and now this my
[49:52] brother and sister I hope you catch and
[49:54] can bring right back into today because
[49:56] when Jesus is sending them now on this
[50:00] little Mission if you would call that
[50:01] the cult is there and when they ask you
[50:07] he could have said not when but when
[50:11] you understand what I'm saying almost
[50:13] one is like if they ask you give them
[50:16] this answer but he's there giving them
[50:18] projecting to them they're going to ask
[50:21] you why are you losing the cold and I'm
[50:24] giving you the words to say and it
[50:26] strikes me how that our Lord Jesus
[50:28] Christ put in the word and told us not
[50:30] to even think about our answer now the
[50:33] reason my brother and sister we don't
[50:35] need to think about the answer because
[50:36] he has already given us the answer to
[50:40] the devil's question amen we have
[50:42] already been given it's been deposited
[50:45] down on the fleshly table of our heart
[50:47] and if we will just calm ourselves from
[50:50] the circumstance of life and just let
[50:52] that still Small Voice it will tell us
[50:55] what to speak I know many times I've got
[50:58] myself in conversations I remember one
[51:01] time witnessing to a lady and and as it
[51:05] come out in the way that I explain
[51:06] things of the godhead she got very angry
[51:09] and I wasn't following it and then she
[51:12] says well you're saying the Trinity is
[51:14] wrong and my grandparents have believed
[51:16] the Trinity my great-grandparents and my
[51:19] parents now and I do and you're saying
[51:21] we are all lost I say your faults and I
[51:25] was like oh my what if I got myself into
[51:27] Lord what do I do what do I do but you
[51:29] know I said the truth I maybe didn't say
[51:31] it in wisdom
[51:35] but God gives us wisdom
[51:37] we listen to that voice
[51:40] it's the voice of wisdom
[51:42] we can walk away and say maybe I should
[51:45] have said it different but later you'll
[51:46] realize
[51:47] you know what
[51:49] that comes from my heart I wasn't
[51:51] thinking about what I was saying that
[51:53] just came from my heart and
[51:56] we have the answer to the devil's
[51:58] question
[52:00] and so as those men are saying you
[52:02] imagine what it would be like some guy
[52:04] walks up he's untying your cult uh what
[52:07] are you doing well the Lord needs him
[52:09] you don't hear any question there was no
[52:11] argument they didn't call the police
[52:12] there wasn't no rancus about this there
[52:15] was something anointed about this
[52:17] situation that it was there that the
[52:20] words that Jesus had spoke had already
[52:22] provided the way and already provided
[52:26] the necessary ingredients and had put
[52:29] everything in that situation in its
[52:32] correct place and so as it is that they
[52:35] are there they're speaking and my
[52:37] brother and sister you know it's amazing
[52:39] as you look at the word that God even
[52:42] needed for this time for scripture to be
[52:44] fulfilled he needed some Pharisees
[52:47] so God includes some Pharisees into the
[52:50] equation there had to be some negative
[52:53] in that equation we say well we could do
[52:56] without the negative but I'm telling you
[52:58] tonight my brother and sister gone has
[53:00] placed negative in your life because you
[53:03] need that it so put us in our correct
[53:06] position sometimes it's dealing with our
[53:09] attitude sometimes in our position
[53:10] sometimes to shake us a little bit so
[53:13] Our Roots will go deeper and so we
[53:15] actually need Pharisees in this day and
[53:18] God put Pharisees into that that they
[53:20] would be there and say hey can't you
[53:23] shut these guys up but I'm here to tell
[53:25] you today my brother and sister there's
[53:27] nothing going to shut up the Bride of
[53:29] Jesus Christ amen the devil would like
[53:31] to silence her you make too much noise
[53:34] you're too Pro you're boastful you're
[53:36] arrogant these are all words that have
[53:38] been thrown out to silence the bride of
[53:40] Christ but my brother and sister we will
[53:43] not be silent we might fall down and
[53:46] have struggles in life our own self
[53:48] where we say oh Lord why did I do that
[53:50] or why did I say that or whatever it
[53:52] might be but my brother and sister the
[53:54] word has anointed you to have the answer
[53:58] oh thank you Lord
[54:00] and so we see how that God's word is
[54:03] perfectly orchestrated God put those
[54:05] Pharisees allowed them to be there give
[54:08] them a boldness to speak against Jesus
[54:12] oh they weren't speaking against Jesus
[54:14] they were talking about the disciples
[54:19] but if the disciples were just in the
[54:21] street
[54:23] screaming hollering whooping
[54:25] a good time
[54:28] you know they didn't have soccer back
[54:30] then I don't guess but you know if it
[54:32] was just a bunch of guys in the street
[54:33] going our team won yes yes yeah they
[54:36] never said a word
[54:37] but because these men were glorifying
[54:40] Jesus Christ we must silence them
[54:44] is that not the same Spirit of the day
[54:46] we live in
[54:48] my I mean you know I just saw a little
[54:50] video this this parent is in a in a
[54:53] school board meeting and and uh he says
[54:56] well I I have my deal but I want to
[54:58] deviate for just a second he said uh you
[55:01] know it's in your school Charter
[55:03] to um say the Lord's prayer before you
[55:06] start your school board meetings and um
[55:08] so you either need to start doing that
[55:10] or you need to uh take it out of the
[55:13] charter and if you take it out of the
[55:14] charter you'll all get kicked out
[55:16] what a challenge
[55:19] and they told him your time's wasting
[55:21] you need to get on blah blah blah and he
[55:22] says no you can't
[55:24] you can't make me
[55:26] and here's the rules
[55:28] you see they want to silence that voice
[55:31] they don't want that voice praising God
[55:33] they don't want that voice bringing a
[55:36] judgment and confrontation to them
[55:38] because down in their conscious they
[55:40] know they're wrong
[55:42] and so this is here where where the
[55:44] Pharisees are just trying so much to
[55:48] just silence it and as you see my
[55:50] brother and sister uh the beauty of
[55:52] God's word and if we sometimes in our
[55:55] struggles and troubles that we have if
[55:57] we will just stop and realize how
[56:00] perfectly orchestrated God's word is
[56:03] we are seeing the very signs that the
[56:05] word has said and the prophet lays it
[56:08] all out it seems I believe to the real
[56:11] believer it seems very simple and the
[56:14] world stumbled over it my brother and
[56:16] sister and such uh uh uh convoluted
[56:19] answers and contradictory answers and
[56:22] you know my the other day this guy you
[56:25] know I just was looking at a deal and
[56:27] this guy he had all of this stuff laid
[56:29] out it was actually a brochure a man
[56:32] gave us in a grocery store
[56:33] you remember the man Jerry
[56:36] and so I thought I'm just going to
[56:38] follow through this man's little
[56:40] guideline
[56:41] and he's got it my brother and sister if
[56:43] any of you got the covet vaccine you now
[56:45] have the Antichrist living in you
[56:49] see no real correlation to a spiritual
[56:53] platform
[56:54] just man's ideas that if you do this and
[56:57] if you do that and and if you allow them
[57:00] to take your money away from you that
[57:02] says in God you trust and give you a
[57:04] piece of plastic that's an antichrist
[57:06] Spirit now this might all well fit in
[57:08] I'm not going to argue with the man but
[57:10] it's not the Antichrist but look how the
[57:13] Antichrist has so veiled itself behind
[57:16] layers of the veil in this realm that
[57:19] they can't see the Antichrist Spirit
[57:21] come right in and goes to church with
[57:23] them they are looking to the outside
[57:25] it's a government it's this nation it's
[57:27] this person it's that event but my
[57:30] brother and sister they don't realize
[57:31] the Antichrist spirit is sitting right
[57:34] in church with them amen now I'll tell
[57:37] you what I want to do I want Grace
[57:38] Tabernacle to be so on fire for God that
[57:41] if the Antichrist spirit's sitting here
[57:43] in church he's sweating
[57:46] I don't want to be comfortable I want
[57:48] him to be sitting here going oh my I
[57:50] hope they get this service over soon I
[57:52] can't handle much more of this amen and
[57:55] I do believe God would allow us to bring
[57:57] the fire of the Holy Ghost down in this
[58:00] building and touch our lives that we
[58:02] would be so under the influence of the
[58:05] Holy Ghost that the devil would look at
[58:07] that and decide he'd rather try to Rob
[58:09] Fort Knox than try to get into your
[58:11] heart
[58:12] amen
[58:13] Hallelujah
[58:15] so brother Branham I want to take a
[58:18] little step here brother Branham shares
[58:20] with us story about how he had went to
[58:22] pray for a baby
[58:24] and he's there
[58:29] and as everything is coming to pass
[58:33] he's in the house
[58:35] ready to pray for the baby the vision
[58:38] comes before his eyes again and realizes
[58:40] either the mother mother-in-law I guess
[58:43] either way I'm right because it was
[58:44] Mother and one and mother-in-law to the
[58:46] other but anyway the the Mother-in-law I
[58:49] believe it is
[58:50] um
[58:51] anybody remember the story well enough
[58:53] was it mother-in-law
[58:59] Grand okay
[59:02] and then brother the vision passes
[59:04] before brother Brian May realize she's
[59:05] not there
[59:07] and then when she does come he wants to
[59:09] move the Hat
[59:16] wants to move the Hat
[59:18] but the vision passes before him again
[59:20] and he realizes I can't move the Hat
[59:24] so as you look at that you see now
[59:26] brother Branham was so under the
[59:28] leadership of the Holy Spirit now look
[59:29] at this look how much God wanted that
[59:32] Vision to come to pass there was no like
[59:34] well it'll be a test for for William
[59:36] Branham he might fail it God wanted that
[59:39] Vision to that healing to come to pass
[59:42] so much that he keeps bringing this and
[59:44] brother is reminded now and he wants to
[59:47] move the hat but realizes I can't do
[59:49] this and I want to say Amen my brother
[59:51] and sister I can't do this but God has a
[59:55] perfect position for every one of us a
[59:58] time and a season and everything is in
[1:00:00] place just like the cult had to be in
[1:00:03] the village just like they had to come
[1:00:06] and sing Hosanna to the king amen and
[1:00:09] I'll tell you let me throw this in
[1:00:10] because I'll just skip over it my
[1:00:12] brother and sister if we'll read that
[1:00:14] scripture and read it from the heart
[1:00:15] we'll realize that's a commission for
[1:00:18] you and I to be lifting praise to God
[1:00:20] Amen we I don't want no Rock doing my I
[1:00:24] worshiping for me I don't want or
[1:00:27] anything else I was called you was
[1:00:30] called to worship God hallelujah and the
[1:00:33] devil would try to bring us to a place
[1:00:35] that we could have this and we're
[1:00:37] struggling with this and struggling with
[1:00:38] that and things happen but my brother
[1:00:41] and sister be on that there should be
[1:00:44] nothing to stop us from saying I don't
[1:00:46] care if everything is falling apart I'm
[1:00:49] a daughter of God I'm a Son of God I've
[1:00:52] got children that want to serve God I
[1:00:54] got parents that serve God I'm going to
[1:00:56] lift my hands and say thank you Lord
[1:00:59] Hallelujah
[1:01:01] so brother Brian I'm sharing how he went
[1:01:03] to pray for it and as it is everything
[1:01:06] had to be in the right spot everyone had
[1:01:09] to be in the right spot and the prophet
[1:01:12] amen this Vision was not my brother's
[1:01:15] sister vague this PR this Vision was
[1:01:19] very specific and I want to just take
[1:01:22] this if you can follow me today my
[1:01:24] brother and sister God's got a vision
[1:01:26] for the bride of Christ and it's very
[1:01:28] very specific it's not for us to take
[1:01:31] what we want and leave out what doesn't
[1:01:33] fit but we ought to be looking at this
[1:01:36] Vision in print form and saying Lord I
[1:01:38] want to be in exactly the right spot in
[1:01:41] exactly the right place at the right
[1:01:44] time
[1:01:48] Hallelujah excuse me if I get a little
[1:01:50] excited
[1:01:51] I was supposed to be working today and I
[1:01:53] was reading amen
[1:01:57] imagine God cared so much
[1:02:05] it comes down that simple
[1:02:07] even a hat
[1:02:12] now how much more for us the bride of
[1:02:14] Christ with an open book
[1:02:17] exactly right
[1:02:19] what should I do in this situation it's
[1:02:21] right here in the book in The Vision
[1:02:23] what should I do what should I do what
[1:02:25] should I do it's right here in the
[1:02:28] vision amen now this is not to say that
[1:02:31] we had the revelation of it until it was
[1:02:34] revealed to us but God ordained that in
[1:02:38] the right place at the right time amen
[1:02:41] the vision would open before us now my
[1:02:44] brother and sister it's very interesting
[1:02:46] when we think about this something we
[1:02:48] all know but just to bring out tonight
[1:02:50] that God and so precise in his in his
[1:02:55] ways and his Works my brother and sister
[1:02:57] that each one of us at the right time
[1:03:00] comes to the opening
[1:03:02] of the same Veil
[1:03:04] but our Veil
[1:03:10] same Veil
[1:03:12] in other words no one can claim private
[1:03:14] interpretation or Revelation But
[1:03:17] ultimately we've every one of us come to
[1:03:20] that opening of the veil at a different
[1:03:22] time
[1:03:24] but it was our correct place to receive
[1:03:27] the opening of The Veil
[1:03:30] imagine we take we take the children and
[1:03:33] tell them now you've got to understand
[1:03:34] this you've got to understand this what
[1:03:36] we do is make a bunch of nervous wrecks
[1:03:38] out of a bunch of children because if
[1:03:40] they didn't understand it they would be
[1:03:41] thinking ah there's something wrong with
[1:03:43] but my brother and sister the day will
[1:03:45] be and I confess this as a positive
[1:03:47] testimony the day will be that the veil
[1:03:49] will completely roll back amen children
[1:03:52] being
[1:03:53] baptized children understanding who they
[1:03:56] are as Jesus Christ there's an opening
[1:03:58] of the veil but one day God will
[1:04:00] completely roll the veil back and the
[1:04:02] word will become so alive to them that
[1:04:04] everywhere they look is the prophet of
[1:04:06] God said everywhere sunrise sunset
[1:04:08] everything in the word and in life will
[1:04:11] be Jesus Christ
[1:04:13] amen because it has to be in its correct
[1:04:16] place
[1:04:18] and so as a prophet of God is is doing
[1:04:21] this when everything was in its correct
[1:04:23] place it loosed a supernatural event
[1:04:27] now that wasn't a supernatural event
[1:04:30] that lightning flashed across the city
[1:04:32] and people talked about I saw a
[1:04:34] constellation and I saw this or that but
[1:04:36] I'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:04:37] every time God comes down in our midst
[1:04:40] is a supernatural event and people will
[1:04:44] be saying the critics will say but where
[1:04:46] is God moving my brother and sister I
[1:04:49] believe I can raise my hand for you
[1:04:50] tonight we know God is moving it is not
[1:04:54] a question mark we have answered prayers
[1:04:57] we have healings we have deliverances we
[1:05:01] have things that have been given
[1:05:02] Revelation and so we are not sitting
[1:05:05] here saying where is it at where's it at
[1:05:07] because we can stand and say I'm a
[1:05:09] testimony I'm a testimony of where it's
[1:05:12] at
[1:05:13] Hallelujah
[1:05:14] and so they've come together in the
[1:05:16] Supernatural power is released and a
[1:05:19] baby is healed and lives are influenced
[1:05:21] lives are changed
[1:05:23] amen
[1:05:24] now you see as we go back into the
[1:05:27] scripture
[1:05:28] you know it's there that we see in this
[1:05:30] whole picture at least I hope you see it
[1:05:32] the way I see it
[1:05:34] but I have something special but it's
[1:05:35] there what we're seeing my brother and
[1:05:38] sister
[1:05:39] is the Angel of the Lord is Walking with
[1:05:41] the disciples
[1:05:43] going right up there and I I make this
[1:05:45] comment about the cult and been unridden
[1:05:49] but you don't have to worry about it
[1:05:50] because when Jesus sends you
[1:05:52] Can someone say Lord send me
[1:05:55] amen father it is I
[1:05:58] amen when Jesus sends you and he has
[1:06:01] given you a clear commission not
[1:06:03] something outside the word not some
[1:06:05] man's opinion not your opinion but when
[1:06:07] Jesus sends you my brother and sister
[1:06:10] you should not have a doubt that God is
[1:06:13] going to bring that to pass you don't
[1:06:15] have to go up there with a snaffle bit
[1:06:17] and they'll have to go up there with
[1:06:19] some Buckaroo saddle to deal with this
[1:06:21] cold my brother and sister they walked
[1:06:23] up they unloosed it and they took it
[1:06:25] down there they laid a garment over it
[1:06:27] and they helped Jesus get up on top of
[1:06:29] it my brother and sister that animal
[1:06:30] we're going to use this animal for the
[1:06:32] example that animal was under the same
[1:06:35] anointing of the Holy Ghost then God
[1:06:38] would lay on the heart and life of a son
[1:06:40] or daughter of God in other words that
[1:06:43] little cult had to obey the word amen
[1:06:46] hmm imagine that
[1:06:49] let's bring this in our modern day my
[1:06:51] brother and sister they were to Bull
[1:06:55] in a pasture
[1:06:57] now I'm not counterdicting what the
[1:06:58] prophet of God said but I want you to
[1:07:00] follow this there's a bull in a pasture
[1:07:03] and the prophet of God would have the
[1:07:05] same had the same instinct or we have
[1:07:07] the same Instinct he would be we'd be
[1:07:09] like where is the gun
[1:07:11] the prophet of God talks about perfect
[1:07:13] love
[1:07:14] I'd like to just bring this in another
[1:07:16] way my brother and sister that bull was
[1:07:19] anointed by the Holy Ghost
[1:07:22] that bull could no more have hurt the
[1:07:24] prophet then the word of God could fail
[1:07:28] and God give that as an example for you
[1:07:31] and I oh I hope nobody thinks I'm being
[1:07:34] negative here but it wasn't as much
[1:07:36] about just brother Branham as it was
[1:07:39] that he as a teacher was giving us a
[1:07:42] lesson of what perfect love will do in
[1:07:45] our life
[1:07:46] oh don't don't question that that it
[1:07:49] never worked for me
[1:07:50] I'd have to run
[1:07:53] not if you were under that anointing
[1:07:55] that's right
[1:07:58] God called you to be one to stand there
[1:08:00] you'd be anointed to stand and the bull
[1:08:02] would be walking away saying I don't
[1:08:04] know why I like that guy so much
[1:08:08] I really wanted to chase him down and
[1:08:12] kick him around a little bit but I just
[1:08:15] feel so
[1:08:16] so warm towards him
[1:08:19] oh yeah bulls have thoughts
[1:08:23] yeah
[1:08:26] so you see my brother and sister what is
[1:08:28] happening is we're seeing the word
[1:08:31] anointing the circumstance to come to
[1:08:35] pass that everything will be in its
[1:08:38] correct place
[1:08:47] I want to bring this out if I could
[1:08:50] when they went to go into the village
[1:08:55] Jesus give them as a word command he
[1:08:57] told them
[1:08:59] go ye to the Village that's against us
[1:09:01] here the next Village
[1:09:03] go in the village there's a cult untie
[1:09:05] the cult tell them it's for the Lord
[1:09:07] bring the cold back
[1:09:09] nowhere in that I hope you see this fine
[1:09:12] line nowhere in that did he tell them to
[1:09:16] make it happen
[1:09:20] they were following
[1:09:22] directions
[1:09:25] that's all they were doing
[1:09:27] they had no command
[1:09:29] to make a demand
[1:09:32] no command to wrestle a cult and bring
[1:09:35] it back unwilling
[1:09:37] so they literally
[1:09:39] were just following
[1:09:42] Jesus
[1:09:44] command
[1:09:46] any down to it
[1:09:48] didn't need to take away from it
[1:09:51] and I hope you really catch this they
[1:09:53] didn't have to make it happen
[1:09:58] all they had to do is follow
[1:10:02] directions
[1:10:04] why is that so hard for us
[1:10:08] I I say that with a bit of humor Saints
[1:10:10] why is that so hard for us just to
[1:10:14] follow
[1:10:15] directions
[1:10:17] but on one side over here can't do it I
[1:10:19] need a shortcut over here it's like I
[1:10:23] can't do it until I can do it perfectly
[1:10:27] he said just go in the village
[1:10:30] he didn't say now stomp on the outskirts
[1:10:32] and
[1:10:32] pray till you got the Holy Ghost
[1:10:35] stop on the outskirts and pray until you
[1:10:38] feel Worthy
[1:10:41] or powerful enough
[1:10:43] they told him just go amen
[1:10:46] and they're going to ask you and here's
[1:10:48] your answer
[1:10:50] you know I I'll preach to Paul for a
[1:10:52] minute
[1:10:53] I attend my wife just pulls her hair out
[1:10:55] you wouldn't notice it so maybe it's
[1:10:57] just theoretically but I tend to be a
[1:10:59] guy that I want to explain things to
[1:11:01] people
[1:11:03] and we'll be doing something and I'm
[1:11:05] explaining to him and Jerry's like
[1:11:14] care
[1:11:15] no you don't understand it's not about
[1:11:17] them it's not about you I feel the need
[1:11:21] to explain it
[1:11:24] God said
[1:11:26] the prophet elaborates on it
[1:11:29] you can't explain this gospel
[1:11:32] you cannot explain this word
[1:11:34] oftentimes we want to explain it so bad
[1:11:38] we make the mess
[1:11:40] it wasn't god making the mess we made
[1:11:42] the mess because we want the people that
[1:11:45] have the call to understand the reason
[1:11:46] we're taking they're told is because
[1:11:48] Jesus is down here on Mount of Olives
[1:11:51] and we have to take this call to him and
[1:11:53] if you understood that he was the
[1:11:54] Messiah and there's a no
[1:11:59] the Lord
[1:12:01] have need of it amen
[1:12:04] who's the Lord
[1:12:06] they might not even really understood
[1:12:08] but they were anointed
[1:12:11] amen I want you to understand my brother
[1:12:12] and sister when God anoints you and I to
[1:12:14] live this gospel amen he didn't tell us
[1:12:17] to go what is that Saint Francis or
[1:12:20] whatever that is that says uh you know
[1:12:22] you go testify of Jesus Christ speak if
[1:12:24] you have to
[1:12:25] amen you know you look at that my
[1:12:28] brother and sister now let me just move
[1:12:29] on so we don't take too much time
[1:12:32] I just want to put it this way Jesus
[1:12:34] said it was
[1:12:36] amen amen
[1:12:38] amen the word had prepared them with the
[1:12:43] word
[1:12:44] so all they had to do is speak what the
[1:12:47] word said speak amen amen amen go and
[1:12:51] you will see
[1:12:52] amen the cult is where it's supposed to
[1:12:54] be
[1:12:56] you know I mean imagine my brother and
[1:12:58] sister
[1:12:59] I still it strikes me make more than you
[1:13:02] I don't know but I tell you what my
[1:13:04] brother and sister when somebody gives
[1:13:06] you the answer before the questions ever
[1:13:08] asked you ought to stop and think about
[1:13:11] it
[1:13:11] amen and long before the devil ever
[1:13:15] asked the question of why you think you
[1:13:17] are amen God already had given us the
[1:13:21] answer we don't need to listen to The
[1:13:23] Devil's argument we need to give Jesus
[1:13:26] his answer
[1:13:27] the word has already given the answer
[1:13:31] amen now Isaiah 45
[1:13:35] says look unto me and be saved in all
[1:13:39] the ends of the Earth for I am God and
[1:13:41] there is none else
[1:13:44] now I'd like to ask you tonight
[1:13:47] what is your alternative
[1:13:52] there is no alternative
[1:14:00] look unto me be saved
[1:14:03] I'm God
[1:14:05] there's none else sorry if this was a
[1:14:07] white board we would just take all other
[1:14:09] options
[1:14:12] that's it
[1:14:13] only one option left
[1:14:17] can we honestly say isn't that where
[1:14:19] God's bringing us
[1:14:21] there's no option people say well you
[1:14:23] know if it doesn't work out be a
[1:14:24] Christian I can always go where
[1:14:29] aware that we had God erased it
[1:14:33] we got nowhere else to go
[1:14:36] where could I go
[1:14:38] for ye alone have the words of eternal
[1:14:42] life
[1:14:43] amen see how God's setting the stage why
[1:14:46] it's not that he's trying to force us my
[1:14:48] brother and sister he's actually
[1:14:50] bringing us to the correct position
[1:14:53] now you know I'm gonna put a few things
[1:14:56] off so I hope this doesn't doesn't
[1:14:58] um leave a gap too much
[1:15:01] but I I want to just bring this point
[1:15:03] out so here's Jesus standing in the
[1:15:06] midst of the olive trees on the Mount of
[1:15:08] olive
[1:15:09] and and as I said we have stood in that
[1:15:11] little Grove
[1:15:12] it's a beautiful type my brother and
[1:15:14] sister because you see oil is
[1:15:16] representative of Israel and as it is
[1:15:19] there that the word was in their midst
[1:15:22] and they couldn't see him
[1:15:25] so he's right there in their midst and
[1:15:27] very few people recognized him and now
[1:15:31] we realize that the olive oil is a
[1:15:34] representation of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:37] and the anointed word is in the midst of
[1:15:39] the church today and very few recognize
[1:15:43] him
[1:15:45] so I hope you catch that parallel there
[1:15:48] he's standing right there in the midst
[1:15:50] on the Mount of Olives in the midst of
[1:15:52] Israel and they can't see him and now
[1:15:54] he's standing here in the midst of the
[1:15:57] church and they can't see him and the
[1:15:59] Very type and Shadow of the anointing
[1:16:02] amen because the olive tree has a direct
[1:16:04] relationship to the olive oil amen so
[1:16:08] one must be there for the other to exist
[1:16:10] and it's there that we realize that God
[1:16:13] in the midst of the church my brother
[1:16:15] and sister was the very thing that they
[1:16:17] claim they say oh we have this we have
[1:16:20] this but yet the prophet of God are
[1:16:22] reading it today prophet of God says
[1:16:24] here is the real type and that is he was
[1:16:27] standing on the outside knocking trying
[1:16:31] to get in
[1:16:34] and they were like I don't know who that
[1:16:37] is out there we have everything we need
[1:16:42] but the word said
[1:16:44] that they were blind
[1:16:46] wretched
[1:16:48] naked
[1:16:50] and declared with confidence I have need
[1:16:54] of nothing
[1:16:57] see how that spirit's working and the
[1:16:58] age it's come right back my brother and
[1:17:01] sister we are coming right back as
[1:17:03] though it was a a oh what do they call
[1:17:05] that I can't remember you know where
[1:17:07] where the past comes alive again but
[1:17:09] it's there deja vu deja vu is what I was
[1:17:12] thinking it's like a deja vu in a sense
[1:17:14] that this is happening again and the
[1:17:16] Messiah is standing in the midst of the
[1:17:18] people
[1:17:19] and they can't recognize him
[1:17:24] you notice the Pharisees didn't call him
[1:17:27] Messiah
[1:17:29] but they recognized him for his
[1:17:32] authority and called him master
[1:17:35] but the Pharisees called many mastery
[1:17:39] now this comes out and brings out a type
[1:17:41] that the prophet of God I don't want to
[1:17:43] go into the whole thing I'll get
[1:17:44] sidetracked but the prophet of God has
[1:17:47] brought it down my brother and sister in
[1:17:48] the day we live in well actually it's
[1:17:50] all down through time
[1:17:52] many lords
[1:17:55] but only one
[1:17:57] Lord
[1:17:58] amen
[1:18:00] many
[1:18:02] can say these words be recognized by
[1:18:04] these words but that doesn't make it so
[1:18:07] that's right
[1:18:13] now
[1:18:14] let's just skip over a few things here
[1:18:19] in 59
[1:18:22] brother Brandon preaches where has thy
[1:18:24] strength gone Samson
[1:18:27] said oh my Israel when they got settled
[1:18:30] down when they was on the move all right
[1:18:33] it was all right as long as they were
[1:18:35] moving but when they got to Palestine
[1:18:37] and got settled down then they begin to
[1:18:40] act or want to act like the Philistines
[1:18:43] and the Gentile World they wanted a king
[1:18:46] and when they accepted Saul as their
[1:18:48] King they denied God as their King
[1:18:52] now my brother and sister uh you have to
[1:18:55] read between the lines a little bit
[1:18:56] forgive me
[1:18:58] but brother Branham goes skirts right
[1:19:01] down the edge of this without directly
[1:19:02] saying it as far as I know and that is
[1:19:05] when one took the leadership of
[1:19:08] denomination
[1:19:10] they made that King
[1:19:13] over their Kingdom
[1:19:16] this is what our church says
[1:19:19] not what God Said what our church says
[1:19:23] and we see how even in the day I won't
[1:19:26] go into it because sometimes this these
[1:19:28] things just seem to take a negative
[1:19:30] connotation but my brother and sister
[1:19:32] that spirit is Alive and Well in the
[1:19:34] land and people will take positions that
[1:19:37] no this is what said and this is how
[1:19:39] it's going to be now they're not seeking
[1:19:42] the leadership of the Holy Spirit right
[1:19:43] they're not asking the Holy Spirit to
[1:19:45] come down and lead them and guide them
[1:19:48] but they're actually taking a position I
[1:19:51] respect this person they're smarter than
[1:19:53] I more Revelation than I they have an
[1:19:56] office higher than I and they said and
[1:19:58] we follow but my brother and sister the
[1:20:01] word give us one to follow and it's Lord
[1:20:04] Jesus Christ
[1:20:06] amen dominion over our soul does not
[1:20:10] belong to man but it belongs to our Lord
[1:20:13] Jesus Christ so they wanted a king and
[1:20:16] when they accepted Saul as their King
[1:20:17] they denied God as their King and when
[1:20:20] man sets the word of God to the side to
[1:20:23] accept a rulership of a king in their
[1:20:26] life they are rejecting Jesus Christ
[1:20:29] amen rejecting God and when we accept
[1:20:32] denominational barriers and handshakes
[1:20:34] and classical things instead of the Holy
[1:20:36] Ghost well then we're denying God is our
[1:20:39] King I'm telling you I'm not here
[1:20:41] tonight to deny God as my king he is
[1:20:44] inequivocally my king amen the King of
[1:20:48] Kings not just a king but the king of
[1:20:51] kings and let there be nothing I say
[1:20:53] this just from my heart not even as a
[1:20:55] preacher not even a pastor not even in
[1:20:57] one just from My Heart Lord do not allow
[1:21:01] anything to rise to the throne in my
[1:21:04] life that would cause me to look away
[1:21:06] from you let it crumble before it ever
[1:21:09] gets to me Lord let it be if it would be
[1:21:12] business or prosperities or whatever it
[1:21:14] might be Lord let it crumble before it
[1:21:16] would destroy me and I would reject you
[1:21:18] as my king amen amen amen
[1:21:21] it finally LED them to an aham
[1:21:24] to a total backsliding they failed to
[1:21:26] recognize the real King when he come and
[1:21:29] that's the thing the churches has done
[1:21:31] today they've accepted all this other
[1:21:33] philosophy and doctorate and psychology
[1:21:36] and all these different things instead
[1:21:38] of receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:21:41] my oh my is that not powerful now the
[1:21:45] king
[1:21:47] is in the midst of the church
[1:21:50] I hope you're following me amen the king
[1:21:52] is in the midst of the church
[1:21:54] and get this it isn't that they just
[1:21:57] outright rejected it they don't even
[1:22:00] know it right
[1:22:02] right how could we have a king sit in
[1:22:05] our midst and not even know it
[1:22:08] but we can go right back in this thought
[1:22:10] that we are on right here and see Jesus
[1:22:12] right there and going right through
[1:22:14] Jerusalem going right through Bethlehem
[1:22:16] going right through Nazareth going right
[1:22:18] through all of these places and very few
[1:22:21] recognize that the king of kings was
[1:22:25] there in their midst
[1:22:28] oh my
[1:22:29] you know the word repeats itself
[1:22:32] amen the kings in the midst of the
[1:22:35] church and they don't know it they
[1:22:36] rejected it just exactly the way they
[1:22:39] rejected Jesus there so is the church
[1:22:42] rejecting him today why because they
[1:22:45] accepted an Earthly
[1:22:47] King amen
[1:22:49] my oh my
[1:22:51] what a position my brother and sister
[1:22:56] hmm
[1:22:58] had a thought there I was going to share
[1:23:01] maybe I wasn't supposed to
[1:23:04] so as we look at this
[1:23:08] my brother and sister we'll see how God
[1:23:10] is moving
[1:23:13] and I Marvel this will sound like
[1:23:15] brother Paul has no Revelation and has
[1:23:17] digressed
[1:23:19] hope you don't mind
[1:23:22] but I stop
[1:23:24] and I Marvel
[1:23:28] at all the nonsensical
[1:23:31] foolish
[1:23:33] ridiculous things
[1:23:36] I've done in my life
[1:23:43] give all of us a moment to ponder that
[1:23:52] and I'm going to put it in a little
[1:23:53] different way if you follow me
[1:23:56] God didn't care
[1:23:59] that you watch Jesus go by on the cult
[1:24:06] he didn't care that you had no reaction
[1:24:11] because there had to come a time
[1:24:16] and in that time amen
[1:24:19] you could not reject him
[1:24:23] even if your flesh wait our flesh did
[1:24:26] not want to
[1:24:29] we couldn't reject him
[1:24:32] it didn't matter that there was a
[1:24:34] Pharisee saying hey silence them this is
[1:24:37] not even truth we have the truth we've
[1:24:40] always had the truth silence them
[1:24:43] they don't matter who says now
[1:24:46] no no see how history repeats itself
[1:24:49] Saints
[1:24:50] but we're in the day
[1:24:52] that God by his mercy and his grace says
[1:24:56] up I'm not you I I need you
[1:25:00] I've got a time I've got a place
[1:25:03] and the correct place it's going to
[1:25:06] happen
[1:25:08] now that might be over simplistic
[1:25:11] of
[1:25:15] explaining I guess
[1:25:18] but my brother and sister I I'm so
[1:25:21] thoroughly believe
[1:25:23] the words of the prophet
[1:25:26] that when he says if you
[1:25:30] were in him then
[1:25:34] you will be in him
[1:25:37] now
[1:25:38] and if you weren't in him then
[1:25:42] you won't be in him now
[1:25:49] and then I asked the question what do we
[1:25:51] have to worry about that's right
[1:25:53] what do we have to worry about
[1:25:55] amen my brother and sister God has
[1:25:58] already put us in the correct place
[1:26:04] oh I tell you that makes my heart stir I
[1:26:07] just think Lord thank you oh and the
[1:26:09] devil reminds me of the foolish things
[1:26:15] but I just look back and say you know
[1:26:17] what Lord thank you for forgiving me
[1:26:20] not begging for forgiveness Saints
[1:26:22] understand not begging for forgiveness
[1:26:24] stand in that position and say thank you
[1:26:26] Lord for forgiving me because he's
[1:26:29] dealing from the position of a finished
[1:26:30] work so when we say Lord forgive me he's
[1:26:34] saying what are you talking about
[1:26:36] I like that now that's no license to
[1:26:39] behave in your way but the devil's a
[1:26:41] slippery old character amen now I want
[1:26:44] to just hurry right along here this
[1:26:46] quote right here the super sign
[1:26:48] amen this is a super quote that talks
[1:26:53] about a super sign
[1:26:54] amen
[1:26:56] but look at this he didn't come in the
[1:26:59] Polish of the world the way they
[1:27:00] expected him to come but what did he say
[1:27:03] a virgin shall conceive amen that was a
[1:27:07] sign that was a super sign a virgin
[1:27:10] shall conceive amen a super a super sign
[1:27:14] not a natural sign but a super sign a
[1:27:18] Virgil virgin conceiving see a
[1:27:21] supernatural sign Supernatural you think
[1:27:24] brother Brown was trying to convey to
[1:27:25] the people something Supernatural is
[1:27:27] taking place oh my
[1:27:32] amen never did before but she shall
[1:27:35] conceive what was it to be his name
[1:27:37] Shall be Called Emmanuel how will it be
[1:27:40] God and man will become one now my
[1:27:45] brother and sister if God started off on
[1:27:46] the plan for him and us to become one I
[1:27:51] tell you what it makes me nervous when
[1:27:53] people say we are not one I I'm I've
[1:27:55] gone over some of my nervousness because
[1:27:58] maybe they're not in those certain place
[1:28:00] yet
[1:28:02] and they will
[1:28:04] but for me I believe for you we sit here
[1:28:07] today a clear recognition that God's
[1:28:09] full intent for this hour for this
[1:28:12] message to come and the unfolding of the
[1:28:14] word and the Revelation the veil being
[1:28:16] broke to step in there and realize that
[1:28:19] there is nothing separating us from God
[1:28:22] now the veil is it rained the veil is
[1:28:26] gone and so God is there face to face
[1:28:30] and we have become my brother and sister
[1:28:32] as the scripture says we don't know what
[1:28:34] we'll be I'm paraphrasing this ah we
[1:28:37] don't know what it will be when we see
[1:28:39] him but we do know we shall be as he is
[1:28:44] oh you look at that we don't have to
[1:28:46] question what's it going to be like over
[1:28:48] there we're going to be little Gods amen
[1:28:50] and we're going to be worshiping Our God
[1:28:51] our Father
[1:28:53] oh I'll tell you what I get excited
[1:28:55] about that amen that God and man are one
[1:29:01] the super sign was that first man that
[1:29:04] God could come into all that God was he
[1:29:08] poured into Christ and all Christ was he
[1:29:10] poured into you
[1:29:14] um don't be thinking about a building
[1:29:16] with a with a bell tower and whatever
[1:29:18] else you are his church you are his
[1:29:21] dwelling place and he poured it amen now
[1:29:24] do you understand I wish I had a
[1:29:26] something I could pour it into I'm
[1:29:28] telling you my brother and sister when
[1:29:30] you get to the point that you have
[1:29:32] tipped it far enough
[1:29:34] you can't retrieve it
[1:29:38] he poured it into the church he didn't
[1:29:40] say now I'm going to have to take the
[1:29:42] church and pour it back into myself
[1:29:43] because the church is not going to be
[1:29:45] able to do this the church won't be able
[1:29:47] to handle this Revelation or I poured
[1:29:49] out more than it appears that they can
[1:29:50] hold
[1:29:51] no sir God committed himself do you do
[1:29:54] you follow me God committed himself and
[1:29:56] he poured it into the church he poured
[1:29:59] it into you he wasn't looking to see
[1:30:01] whether it would fit in your life or not
[1:30:04] because he knew it would
[1:30:06] he didn't have to say I'm going to see
[1:30:08] if this will work he knew it would work
[1:30:11] oh my
[1:30:13] God Amen I hope I'm not getting too
[1:30:16] excited tonight amen God the world could
[1:30:20] only see that God Manor won the super
[1:30:22] sign was that first man that God could
[1:30:24] come into all that God was
[1:30:27] he poured into Christ
[1:30:29] and all that Christ was he poured into
[1:30:32] the church super sign God and man
[1:30:36] together that was to be the Super sign
[1:30:39] of the last day when the entire Bible
[1:30:42] was to be fulfilled in the last days
[1:30:45] what was he doing he broke open the book
[1:30:48] he broke open the book Amen brother
[1:30:51] Trevor sister carry you right here but
[1:30:53] he started pouring it in and he didn't
[1:30:56] have to say I hope it will work I I hope
[1:30:59] it will fit I hope it will no he knew
[1:31:01] when this book was open when the seals
[1:31:04] was broke and he started pouring the
[1:31:06] word into a bride in this hour he knew
[1:31:10] that the bride could handle contain
[1:31:12] whole and be revealed in that word he
[1:31:15] didn't have to sit back and Hope
[1:31:20] amen
[1:31:23] yes
[1:31:25] entire Bible was to be fulfilled
[1:31:33] what does the word say
[1:31:37] at the sounding
[1:31:41] of The Voice
[1:31:43] seventh angel messenger amen
[1:31:46] the mystery of God see this is where I I
[1:31:48] don't understand where people struggle
[1:31:50] over this
[1:31:52] the mystery of God might be
[1:31:55] could have been should have been
[1:31:58] maybe have to abbreviate it
[1:32:02] you know when a author writes a book
[1:32:04] this is the world that it is now they
[1:32:07] figured out people so much
[1:32:09] I don't know what your favorite kind of
[1:32:10] book is it were if you were reading
[1:32:12] something but
[1:32:14] certain kinds of books
[1:32:17] need to be a certain length and they
[1:32:19] literally a man writes a story a woman
[1:32:21] writes a story and they say that's a
[1:32:23] good story but it's too long or it's too
[1:32:25] short
[1:32:26] so they figure out if you've ever read a
[1:32:28] book
[1:32:29] that just has a bunch of mindless
[1:32:31] details
[1:32:34] and she looks so pretty in that dress
[1:32:37] the blue shoelaces
[1:32:39] who cares about what color shoelaces
[1:32:41] she's wearing
[1:32:43] you know what that's called filler
[1:32:46] they're filling up the story
[1:32:52] but God's got another kind of filler
[1:32:55] it's called the Holy Ghost and it's not
[1:32:57] a story it's a life it's a reality
[1:33:02] and he's pouring it into you and I not
[1:33:05] needless details see that's what the
[1:33:07] modern church is trying to do say some
[1:33:09] of these details are needless but God
[1:33:11] says I'm going to pour the whole book
[1:33:12] Into You amen and what I'm going to do
[1:33:15] is put you in the correct place because
[1:33:18] in the correct place you'll be able to
[1:33:20] receive everything out of the book you
[1:33:25] won't come to a place and say well
[1:33:26] praise the Lord I'm full enough
[1:33:28] I'm pretty sure I can make the Rapture
[1:33:30] on this
[1:33:32] um no
[1:33:33] no he puts us in the correct place that
[1:33:35] we're like Lord whatever you have for me
[1:33:37] whatever I need Lord you just pour it
[1:33:40] out father I'm here to receive it I'm
[1:33:42] here to live it
[1:33:43] I want it to be
[1:33:45] amen
[1:33:47] amen oh get lost here
[1:33:51] okay a super sign a virgin shall
[1:33:54] conceive and this conception when it's
[1:33:56] brought forth will be God manifest In
[1:33:58] the Flesh a super sign they still won't
[1:34:02] believe it
[1:34:05] maybe some of those same Pharisees that
[1:34:07] were there asking Jesus Master tell them
[1:34:10] to be quiet
[1:34:12] maybe they were there for some of these
[1:34:14] other Miracles other Supernatural
[1:34:17] they still
[1:34:19] wouldn't believe it
[1:34:21] remember that man that challenged
[1:34:23] brother Branham
[1:34:24] to hurt that little girl
[1:34:27] so we can see you heal her
[1:34:31] see the spirit my it's like what do you
[1:34:34] think what do you mean hurt a little
[1:34:36] girl
[1:34:37] you have some kind of spirit forget
[1:34:39] about this man here what about the
[1:34:42] spirit that's on you
[1:34:44] wow but see the religious worlds like C
[1:34:47] wouldn't accept the challenge
[1:34:50] hmm
[1:34:52] no it's not how God works
[1:34:56] they don't believe it but it was anyhow
[1:34:58] still a super sign not a super sign
[1:35:00] they've got a Superman today now I want
[1:35:02] to just throw this out to you as a
[1:35:04] sideline here I've got to hurry it's
[1:35:05] already nine super sign they got a
[1:35:08] Superman today remember when Trump got
[1:35:10] elected
[1:35:11] a wave across America
[1:35:14] are Superman
[1:35:17] well he must have flew through the flame
[1:35:19] somewhere because his cape is singed
[1:35:22] and it doesn't look so super right now
[1:35:25] but I can give you this assurance
[1:35:27] God ordained a man named Donald Trump
[1:35:31] to be a president of the United States
[1:35:34] of America
[1:35:36] and no signs in any conflict but every
[1:35:38] world leader that's there and everyone
[1:35:40] with a yay and a nay and whatever they
[1:35:43] have is ordained to be in that correct
[1:35:46] place right now amen
[1:35:51] I read a little deal the other day
[1:35:52] somebody
[1:35:53] said well all they got to do is go
[1:35:55] assassinate Mr Putin
[1:35:58] my brother and sister the word of God
[1:36:00] give you an example going backwards the
[1:36:02] word of God is so powerful in protecting
[1:36:04] the prophecy
[1:36:06] that many a memoir was written about men
[1:36:09] who night and day
[1:36:12] dreamed and and strenuously pursued and
[1:36:17] the mental battle they faced of
[1:36:18] assassinating Hitler
[1:36:21] but never did it
[1:36:24] and it shows right there that people go
[1:36:26] into carnal mindsets
[1:36:29] and they think oh we have the answer
[1:36:31] we'll stop violence with more violence
[1:36:37] but the prophecy says
[1:36:40] not prophecy written on the page see God
[1:36:43] Denver gave the answer to all of our
[1:36:45] problems to the prophet
[1:36:47] we get to live it out
[1:36:50] because why
[1:36:51] sometimes the stress and strain
[1:36:54] is what it's going to take to put us in
[1:36:58] the correct
[1:36:59] place
[1:37:01] can somebody lift a hand and say thank
[1:37:03] you Lord
[1:37:04] I want to be in the correct place I want
[1:37:07] whatever happens in my life to place me
[1:37:09] right in that place Lord you want me to
[1:37:13] be
[1:37:14] not how I feel
[1:37:17] but what you want not my will Lord but
[1:37:21] thine be done amen amen let me just
[1:37:25] finish this
[1:37:27] uh
[1:37:29] but the church has got a super sign God
[1:37:32] back in the oh nope here I am moving
[1:37:35] here just a second
[1:37:40] um notice super sign they've got a
[1:37:41] Superman today they've got fictions of
[1:37:43] Superman all these other kinds of super
[1:37:46] things but the church hey he's talking
[1:37:48] to us the church has got a super sign
[1:37:51] God back in the church manifested in
[1:37:56] human flesh
[1:37:58] oh I'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:38:00] that is a super sign that we can sit
[1:38:03] here tonight with an absolute confidence
[1:38:05] knowing this is not a pipe dream this is
[1:38:08] not something we fell into or got
[1:38:10] convinced of but it really is God
[1:38:12] writing on the table of our heart
[1:38:15] tonight
[1:38:16] amen we don't have to look in the past
[1:38:18] somewhere but tonight God is riding on
[1:38:21] the tables of our hearts amen and he is
[1:38:24] writing this story that we are going to
[1:38:27] fulfill or are fulfilling right now he's
[1:38:30] writing this story and it puts you and I
[1:38:32] right in the correct place
[1:38:38] you know there was those books was
[1:38:39] written about the Left Behind series
[1:38:42] I never ever read them but I've read
[1:38:44] excerpts and stuff from it
[1:38:46] now my brother and sister a book to
[1:38:47] become such a bestseller of two-thirds
[1:38:51] of Christendom that thought they were
[1:38:53] saved left behind
[1:38:56] I'd like to talk about the other group
[1:39:00] I'd like to talk to the ones that the
[1:39:03] only book they would know would be the
[1:39:05] book that said I called you before the
[1:39:07] foundation of the world I have finished
[1:39:09] this work and I will finish the work I
[1:39:12] began in you and the words go on and on
[1:39:15] and on that's the book I want to talk
[1:39:17] about not the book that talks about
[1:39:19] being left behind and I as a circle back
[1:39:22] to finish this amen you come to the
[1:39:25] place my brother and sister as God is
[1:39:27] manifesting his word and the book said
[1:39:29] write the word
[1:39:31] who was speaking in the very beginning
[1:39:32] the word
