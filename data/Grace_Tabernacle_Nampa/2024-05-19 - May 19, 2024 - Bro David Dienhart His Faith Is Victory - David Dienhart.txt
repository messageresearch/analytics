a mental expression now let it come from our hearts Lord I want more of you I want to be like you amen I pray that all my heart I can say Lord make me like you when I was a young man working on a ranch Arizona I laid back in my [Music] bunk I had dream that I met brother brandom in that cabin you remember he talks about his little cabin you hear me singing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound he said well bless God old brother Brandon made it whether I met him in that cabin or not but I met him in the cabin and I was sitting across the table from him a round table he was sitting at the head and a setting just caddy corner from him we were fellowshipping in the word I'll never forget those eyes look just like he look through you well he was not brother Brandon brother sister you know what I'm talking about it wasn't the revelation of brother brandom it was a son of man revealing the son of man God was using the man we're not feeding upon the a man we're feeding upon the body word of the son of man and where that carcass is there the Eagles are gathered the word for the season that's brother brandom asked me he said what are we to be like David what are we to be like Brother David I looked at him I'm just a young man of 18 put my head down and raised the back up and he said to be like Jesus that's my desire that's what I want to be I want his character I want his life to be manifested [Music] is that your desire this morning I believe it is you wouldn't be here God brought you here Satan tried to do everything he could to stop this message from me bringing it this morning but he can't stop it if the message doesn't become flesh it's left on words on page it's got to become flesh in you got to become flesh in me that's who he's taking in a Rapture is himself amen he's taking himself he's got a little bride and that bride is himself I pulled up notes I had things I've written down for a month [Music] scratches God knows how to take the man out of the way [Music] I'll say one thing Lord keep working on me get David out of the way you know God only works so humility a humbleness where you can surrender your self surrender your mind surrender old man what are you going to rely upon yourself someday yourself in situations are we going to rely upon [Music] him so I couldn't even print out my notes this morning so I thought well I'll just bring the computer so I brought the computer cuz I it's on the table I have it printed out I saved it so I get in here and it wants to update now so the computer starts to update then it can't update and so it begins to unchange what it couldn't update and I've had that problem now for the last three or four times it's not updating not updating so I waited and waited these brothers know what I'm talking about they saw it I said the brothers brother Chris and it never did [Music] finish so you know what I'm not winging it I'm depending on the inner man amen that's right that's right I know the message's on my heart God saying why don't you just preach what's on your heart that's what you're going to hear yes sir for the glory of God thank you brother thank you sister I can't depend on this and I think God's teaching us I don't mean to be a baby but sometime we need to be a baby yes sir amen we need to weep before him him we need to Humble ourselves we need to come down off our high horses thinking we have something to do about it we don't have a thing to do about it we're absolute weaklings until we realize that absolutely we'll come to that realization how can you fully completely let go and give yourself to him you always want to put something into it aren't we and amen so let's bow our heads in prayer if you'll stand with me in his presence Lord Jesus Our Redeemer it's certainly our prayer to this little bride she has her prayer Lord let me come to fully complete Oneness with yourself and Lord let us lose sight of our own reasoning our thoughts and let us Lord we have not been given a guide of Flesh we've been given the inward man which is the word revealed and that's that's our guide that's our stability that's our comfort we rest in this Lord we rest in it I pray that you would fulfill your purpose now I don't care about time I don't care if it's 10 minutes 15 minutes what it is Lord that has nothing to do with it I believe believe Lord you want to speak to your people and you use man to do it I know one thing for sure I've been called to preach the gospel now Lord I'm depending on you and I'm thankful for that I don't depend on a computer I know you gave me those thoughts this morning but Lord I'm not depending on that I may not have a quote to go to but I've got it in my heart and I'm going to speak by your grace what your Prophet has already said and Lord let it be so you bring back to my remembrance in those hours of prayer that I've been in prayer to you and how you quickened your word and how your mercies are new Every Morning Lord I've just been so happy so much joy may you express now the joy it's in my heart express it to your people I'm depending on you now in thy name the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ amen amen while you're standing turn with me in your Bibles to First John forgive me if I snipple and snuff and something about preaching causes my nose to run I guess it's just the maybe the anointing maybe the inspiration it's like heating Mexican food my nose always runs maybe it gets good and hot and I like it hot and I pray that this word gets good and hot in your heart begins to melt away the old man and we turn our Reliance upon him because if you can't rely on him who are you relying upon who are you going to rely upon you can't make a Rapture in your reasoning you can't come to a body change in a mental conception it's got to be a divine revelation given by God he's the only one that can reveal it amen first John 5 let's begin let's read verse four my title this morning is his faith his victory his faith his victory for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world that's pretty straightforward whoever is born of God how are you going to be born of God unless you were a part of God to be born of God is to be a part of him in him before the world began and how do you say how do I know that because your heart's desire is him yes when you hear the truth you want more of it when you hear the truth of the word for the season you've got to have more of it amen you want more of it your heart's desire is more of of it amen for whatsoever is born of God what would they be if they were born of God if God brought something of himself who would it be it would be himself that's right so whosoever is born of God overcometh the world Cosmos World Order systems and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith Ephesians chapter 2 chapter 2 verse one and you hath he quickened now we heard the message Wednesday night you that were here the real you now brother Chris didn't know I had this on my heart and I'm expecting God to bring what's on my heart but I've had this on my heart over a month and I don't know how long he had it on his heart but this is true truth that you heard and been hearing who it is that you really are and you who's that you there well they say it's all of you yes it is but there's a part of him part of you that's you that's him that he quickens then when he's quickened that part it'll Quicken your whole mortal body and bring it subject to the word is that right absolutely because he said he that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you Romans 8:11 he that dwelleth in you he that raised up Christ shall also if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his Spirit Same Spirit that quickened him will Quicken you and bring it subject to the word amen so he that raised up the anointed word in you unveiled himself in you will also take your mortal body and bring it subject to the word amen all right and so and you ha the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince and the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience I want to jump down here verse four but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us when did he love you before you could even love him or even know how to love him he loved you Jacob I loved Esau I hated why because Jacob was the seed seed of who seed of God all right so even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ with who where's your ident identification then Christ even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ you were in him see you were in him when he come to this earth all that God was he poured into Christ you were there by grace are ye saved so it's not by works is it it's not by your works it's not by by anything you could do or even try to do God saved you before the foundation of the world he already placed you in Christ and saved you when you went to Calvary you were saved there before the foundation of the world he saw you saved before the foundation of the world God wanted to be bride did you hear what I said not have a bride he wanted to be bride amen yes to have a bride but he wanted to be Bri he had an attribute to be bride he had an attribute to be father he had an attribute to be husband he had an attribute to be wife had an attribute to be bride so it takes it completely out of your hands it's God's achievement amen whatever God does you never had a thing to you didn't put your hand in it you come in this world speaking lies you had you had you I'm talking about your your hand physical I mean not talking about your body body your your own physical flesh you the man didn't have anything to do with this it was God doing it all of it by grace are you saved verse six and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus while you're going through turmoil you're sitting in Heavenly places while you feel like you're defeated and you're you're going through pressures and you're nervous and yet you're peaceful simultaneously at the same time part of you has already risen the real you has already raised amen and here you are going through trials and stress and heartaches and yet all the time alive already raised and seated in Heavenly places in Christ prise the lord two Natures in the same body one God recognizes the other because of the blood he recognizes the blood his own life he does not recognize the other Hallelujah the outer man no good the inner man being the seed being the word quickened is life eternal life amen so you say Brother David how can I be seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and at the same time going through trials and test and feel like nothing because you have a dual you have that dual Duality did you know that you are you're a duel nature you're you have a twin that's against you amen but you have the word and you are the word and you're the Living Word on the inside of the inside so and hath raised us up together made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for he for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God you may be seated what is the gift of God eternal life the gift of God is Faith that's exactly right brother Brandon made a statement on perfect Faith paragraph 68 he said he said the believer is he said if you can just recognize yourself a Believer and know that you're a Believer he said and rely upon what you are as a Believer he said the believer is the faith of God that moves in you the believer is the faith of God that moves in you the believer is the revelation of God the substance of himself because faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen you are the faith of God the believer is the very Faith Of God you are God's Own Faith you're the revelation of God that moves in you in you amen all right brother brandham said in the message Christ The Mystery of God revealed you are his victory amen you're the word living He said this little bride is the word living and in action she's not another she's the word living and in action she's she is the life of light she is the light of life amen that's who she is that's what God made her to be she was in him before the foundation of the world she was existing in his thoughts she was eternal as he's Eternal she always was eternal amen because she was in him and when he brings the word and unveils himself it unveils you when the Seven Seals opened in this hour it unveiled you amen when he unveiled himself that's what the Seven Seals were the unveiling of himself it unveiled you it unveils yourself so you're both right now you're both dead and alive you say how can that be outside of you you're dead you like to read that let's go to Colossians Colossians chapter 3 verse one if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above how many's risen with Christ then what are you threatened for what are you f worried about what are you fearful of you've already raised you've already conquered death you've conquered hell you've already raised with him when he rose you Rose it does say I hope I make it I hope I make it which side are you looking at you've already made it are you looking on the outer man because of his mistakes and failures or are you looking on the inside that says you're me he unveils himself in you he unveiled himself in you how could he unveil himself in you because you are his seed amen he that's born of God overcometh the world right did he overcome the world then you've overcome the world he said I am the light what are you he said I am life he that hath the son hath life amen and this is the record that he's given to us eternal life and he that hath the son hath life St John or first John 5 he that hath the son hath life amen is that right so what kind of Life do you have is it you living is it the man living or is it Christ in you living which one will you accept as your guide we have a guide you have a guide amen is that right you have a guide that had you before the foundation of the world and knew the day you would come here and what hour you would come and sent you here to manifest the word for you are the word of the hour manifested and God is manifesting himself the word in Bride form in this hour that's the message of the hour amen amen so it only these things can only be known to her it's not known to everybody it's known to her who' he come for who's he coming for you say is he coming yes he's coming he's coming to take us out of here to a meeting in the air what's he doing he's uniting we've already seen The Headstone we've already seen it come forth we've already seen the sign of the uniting what do we expect now after the word comes it's got to have a it's got to have something Unite with and the head is uniting with the bride he's capping that bride off with what himself what did he say that you would be he said I'd build my church upon the revelation of who I am of the the church matures who is she she's the revelation of himself she has to be the revelation of himself she can't be another she's him amen she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she was in him when he walked the shores of Galilee she was in him when he when he had a headache she was in him when he took all the all the persecution he was in him when he took all your all your uh heartaches and all your troubles and and the chastisement of your peace you were in him you've already conquered the world is conquered what is the thing that conquer what is our Victory our faith he said we are the faith of God then who's our faith then if that's our faith and that's then we are his victory yes right amen we can't be something else other than his victory amen he you say well he's Victorious what about you he said I'm the light what about you is that right this is the message God is what light and in him well who's in him in him is no Darkness then walk in the light brother R talking about the cloud ring he said look at he's looking to the right to the thief he he that he um saved on the cross pardon and he's looking but he said watch that light that comes from me you ever see that cloud ring and see the the light that comes from him he said we'll walk in that light then what are we to walk in that light we have to be the children of light amen for thy light is come amen how many know his light has come the light of the word to walk in has come so walk in the light when he when he when he come in the earth he was the fullness of the godhead bodily then you had to be in him then to be in him now you had to be in him then and when he rose from the grave and conquered death you conquered it then it's not I hope I make it you've done made it you've already made it if Christ made it you made it but what is lacking the revelation of it our brother said what's lacking you have the power God's given you the power but what's lacking the Revelation to move that power to use that power so what are we asking for more than anything else is revelation he said that what the prophet said that's exactly what he said he said the power the revelation of the word cannot be overemphasized your need of Revelation amen cannot be overemphasized amen then who's going to be who is it going to be in this hour that's going to have the revelation of himself and the revelation of herself being himself where's that going to be it's going to be in his bride then what's going to be her headship what's going to be her guide what's going to be the very thing she becomes the Little Wheel in the middle of the wheel you cannot lean upon the outward man to lead you you cannot lean upon your reasoning to lead you you cannot lean upon your feelings to lead you amen one of the great mysteries of God in this hour that brother brandom in the message is this the end sir he said's asking God is this the time of the end sir he said he talked about those Mysteries and he said he said now by God's help the angel let me let me add to what he was reading what the the major Mysteries were he said now by the help of God and and by the by the grace of that angel of this hour and that's not exact words but I'm just saying what he said he said now he said let me express some of the other mystery he said one of them is the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation how many remember that it's not man's working it's not a sensation it's not how much you jumped and how much you shouted that is no not the evidence of you having the Holy Ghost how many know know the prophet talking about 1 Corinthians the 12th chapter said all these great workings of gifts and all these Miracles and all these things are the working of the Holy Ghost but it's not the evidence that the he's indwelling you you can have those things and still be lost and go to hell what takes the difference the difference is the unveiling of himself in you because he planted himself in you I want you to know something I want you to know that the germ and the Egg the ground and the Egg and The Germ is all him it has nothing to do with you as a person it's him when I saw that I about had a jubilee and about flew because you try to make you think well there's got to be something about me then if I'm the egg and he and you say well that was predestinated that's exactly right but you're getting part of the picture he's himself that egg and that ground he himself was The Germ of life to meet it it's revealing of himself by himself coming to himself see it takes the man completely out of the picture completely away thank you Lord you have total Victory if we just realize the victory we have in the position than where we are standing your stand in him is perfect your leadership of him is perfect prise the Lord his way is your way so who is it there that contraries you every time time you start to do something evil is present who's that evil Paul said in re Romans 7 oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this corruptness who's going to deliver me that I thank God through Jesus Christ I live by his mind I don't live by this mind I live by his mind Hallelujah he said walk in the spirit and you'll not fulfill the lust of the flesh that's right let's go to that just a minute in Galatians let's turn over here to Galatians just a minute and let's look at Galatians here just a few scriptures let me just read this he said verse I think it's verse 26 here remember the law and I just back to verse 24 the and now I'm talking about 3:24 he said wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith what was this our school Master the law because the law only showed you that you were a sinner you couldn't it only condemned you because you couldn't keep the law that right and every time you failed there it was right in your face and you couldn't do anything about it you had no release from it there it was but God allowed it to be covered but the Christ that died on the calvary wasn't a covering it annihilated it are you with me the blood annihilated that that curse but he took the law amen you're not under the law anymore if you're in Christ you're not under the law you're under Faith which is the Royal seed which is what Abraham's own seed which is Christ himself in you amen amen amen because we have the faith we have the revelation of God this is our stand this is who we are this is what's moving inside of us the believer is what are we talking about a True Believer you're a True Believer Christ has identified you he's given you his ring he's given you the clothing he's provided everything you need for that meeting in the air and he's come and provided it all he's given you the identification he's identified you the token of his own life identifies you in him then quit your worrying about what the flesh feels how it feels your mistakes and failures has nothing to do with that Inside Man where is your identification it's in him it's that inner man it's that inside man there's an outside and an inside man how many know the word said it and the prophet said it said quit listening to the outer man and take what he said in the Inside Man the Simplicity of faith God said it I believe it he's proven it he's identified me in him and that settles it I raised with him when he raised from the dead I rose up Victorious over all death all mistakes all failures all feelings all senses I conquered it all Darkness I've I've resurrected out of Darkness the wave sheath of the maturity of the word and its fullness is way back over the people in this hour with a firstborn coming up manifesting the fullness the maturity of the word how many know that today that wave sheath has identified you in him waved over you that you've got to come to that full Revelation you've got to come to that maturity and when the word opened up it came out brother sister listen the Pentecostal message was the the birthing it was the baby stage but you had to have a message of maturity come forth in this hour a corner had to be turned and what the Pentecost producer made wait for was the Holy Ghost himself to come right down back to the perfect world again back to himself again how is he standing here in this day it's himself in the bride form it's himself as a bride What's the Word of Promise today it's the word of promises made manifest in the formation of his bride go back to things that are to be it's exactly what he said what are we seeing we're seeing the word manifested in the formation of his bride amen these things had to come through a prophet first these things had to be spoken by a prophet first but who's here to receive the message if you can receive the message you are the message Lord you are the word of the hour you are the Word of Promise for the day you are the message what are you then you're the opened book you're the open word you are the unveiled Christ in you all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into his body his bride then where is he now you say in his church in the bride that's right but why oh well he's in the bride bless God he's in the bride how is he in the bride what makes him in the bride because God listen he met the Catholic priest there's three or four quotes on this he met the Catholic priest said God brother brandom God is in his church and everybody here would say amen that's exactly right we've said it over and over again God is in his church you believe that his church is the Bride of course the Catholic priest wasn't talking about that but he was still saying God's in his church and we say God is in his church brother Bram said no he said God is in his word amen help that to strike Lord how is he in the bride because the word's in you then you've already made it he's perfect so are you he's sinless so are you I'm talking about the real you brother Chris we're talking about the real you the real gift what is the real gift it's your soul down there that's the real gift Hallelujah that's eternal life that's who you are that's what God sees that's what he recognizes he's already conquered the curse of the law and mistakes and failures you're going to make them you're going to have them but if you don't even want to do them and when you have them that doesn't move that inside of the inside Revelation and unveiling of Christ it will not move that it can't move that it's unmovable you've received a kingdom which cannot be moved what is the kingdom it's the word unveiled in you what is the kingdom it's God's word Made Alive made life in you yes there's no defeat in that do you realize the bride cannot be defeated why she is the word that's why she can't be defeated that's why she can't come that's why I mean she can be deceived she can't be deceived why because the discerner is in her she's a part of the discerner she's in the word and the word can't be deceived I'm not talking about how much you carry a Bible around and how much you intellectually know what this says is it revealed in you that's the next thing the word the word itself is your Victory the word itself is your conqueror the word itself is your strength oh you say Brother David but that's not for me what makes you think it's not for you you're either going to say it's not for you or the inside's going to say it is then quit yielding to your flesh and to your past and to all your mistakes and what this person thinks and that person think get over your complex get over that fear he hasn't given you the spirit of fear but of power amen he's given you Faith then accept Faith go back to the word you'll find faith in the word you won't find it anywhere else your Victory lays in that faith that revelation of that word in you that's your Victory and it comes by hearing the word not by your works not by your failures not by your ups and down I fail every day you backslide every day that has nothing to do with that inside the inside still has peace the inside still seated in Heavenly places the inside still in Victory it's amazing you can have peace when you're in turmoil at the same time you just don't think that's PA look at Paul why outside he's despicable he's he bent over a little old Hunchback got welts in his back why but his words are powerful see he was one thing out outside but Paul never said follow the outside it doesn't matter what people think about you it doesn't matter what David thinks about me and David's going to give his reason why it can't be why it can't be why I can't do this why I can't do that I can do all things through Christ which strength me I am victorious over this I have conquered this your enemy is yourself the old selfman that's your enemy and he's defeated do you understand he's defeated huah you say well he is for today right now no he is all the time when you've met him he met you because the word was in you ready to be quickened Hallelujah and how could the word be in you then and not be in the word how could you how could the word be in you and you not be a part of the word how are you a part of the word you were the very substance of his own thoughts you were active you were you were alive you were in his mind and he said I've got to express it and when he expressed it you were that word and therefore you are my Witnesses because St John 15:27 said you are my Witnesses because you were with me from the beginning right and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word was life and the life was the light of men and you tell me where the voice is you tell me where the word is now we're talking different you tell me where the word is I'll tell you there's Christen now he's in a body form he's the word you are the word amen because the word was ordained predestined in you placed in you and God did it he said I'm going to be I'm going to be that man down there I'm going to be David I'm going to be that word I'm going to be living in a body of flesh called David he's going to be born of sinful flesh he's going to be born he's going to come in the world speaking lies but I've already recognized myself in him I've already predestinated when he hear that word that inside would come alive that inside would be quickened that inside would come alive and say that's what I am oh I say thank you Lord I looked in the mirror and said that's me that's me how many look in the word with an unveiled face and say and grow into the same image who's growing David's dying I just said Colossians I I moved off of Colossians let me go back to that a minute hold that spot Galatians but back to Colossians I mean Colossians in verse two set your affection see you seek those things which are above then where's above he that humbles himself shall be exalted what do you ex what do you humbling yourself to you humble yourself to who you really are you lay down this old man in your thinking and Die daily you deny yourself deny this man did not the prophet say that little light was laying inside of me ready to be quickened and he said it was quickened and then I was born again and I'm no longer the son of Charles and Ella Branham isn't that right well I'll let you know right now I'm no longer the son of Bob and Joan dehart I'm a new creation I'm a Living Word I'm the Living Word that's what I'm relying upon I'm not relying upon well my daddy was this and my daddy is that therefore I'm doing this and that's why no no I let go I have to deny that and take that word there is my identification there's who I am that's the real me that's the one that has peace like a river that's the one that's settled that's the one that's already risen and conquered death hell and the grave who is it who is it that's that word inside of me that word's come alive and I recognize my stand my stand is in him my stand is perfect then I stand before him perfect I stand before him sinless I stand before him absolutely complete the Bible said I'm complete in him now either you are or not it depends on where you want to put your trust depends on who you want to trust where are you putting your trust on the outer man or that inner man that birthed word that new creation a what are you what are you on the inside you are a spoken word creation that's how he birthed his son a spoken word creation he was both egg and he was germ had nothing to do with Joseph had nothing to do with Mary I an outside as the brother said Sunday or Wednesday this is an old Badger skin yeah yeah but I'll have you know the Badger don't live inside of that anymore because I've been changed my heart was a badger but no more I may have a badger skin but look who I am and I've come face to face with who I am and it wasn't a public show either and neither is it now amen but it's the seventh seal opened and I am that seal revealed the secret is made known and that secret has been unveiled inside of me and I hold that secret and it's worth more than any precious gold you could ever ask for I don't care what it is it's eternal life and I say let us yield ourselves completely let us skip ourselves over completely no more let us walk by the dictates of our outer man let's walk by the dictates of that unveiled unveiled mystery of God himself in you amen amen amen amen God help us you're the word so what is his faith and what is his victory if you are his victory which you are he said the bride is his very Victory then where is his faith you then that Faith becomes the Royal seed and you are royal seed and your promise was to be here in this age what is the promise it would be Christ himself not another it would be Christ himself veiled behind skin yours and mine a skin of failure a skin of faults a skin of everything about it but God said I've conquered and I'll put my I'll put my spirit inside of you I'll wash it bring it back subject to the word I Am The Germ and I am the I'm the very G I mean you are the I'm the gene of life I'm the germ and I am that egg that would receive it amen that ground that I predestinated to receive it do you get the picture that ought to set you absolutely free you had nothing to do in this that ought to turn your hearts and your ambition and your thoughts heavenward amen you had not one thing to do with knowing him you say if I could just get enough works if I could do enough things you can't do enough to do anything your ways are dead your ways it says it right here he said for you're dead set your affection on things above not on things on the earth so where are your affection where is our affections are we walking by faith he said the just shall live by faith just who the Justified the declared righteous that I've declared in my word to be righteous they shall live by my faith he's got to fulfill his word brother sister you realize God can't speak a word and not fulfill it there's got there got to be somebody here to fulfill that scripture one of them I'm one of them how do you know Brother David because what is revealed to me lines up this word and becomes alive to me it becomes the message of the hour it's the revelation God is Sovereign with that Revelation well give it to me I couldn't give it to you if you wanted but I'll tell you where you can go get it amen that's right it's in the word and if the word's not in you you can say all you want about Christ being in you but if that word's not in there and you're not recognizing the word for the hour something's wrong you're not truly born again you can act like it you can feel like it but the new birth is without sensation it's a divine revelation given by God himself in you that quickens that word to life you say well is there a feeling yes but that's no evidence you ever got it well I weeped I teared I did this I spoke in tongues I prophesied you can have all those things and still not be a child of God you can dress right you can let your hair grow out you can do everything you want to do with it and still not be a child of God you can have the baptism of your Holy Ghost every day of your life and go to hell because you're a Triune being and that little man on the inside is either that word or it isn't that word it's the seed or it isn't the seed amen your spirit man your second realm can be Anointed with that spirit filled with that spirit and still miss it because you can't recognize you can't live you can't accept the word for the season when it's preached in faith that ouer man's going to reason and I don't care it can be living and alive and it is alive in me still that outer man of David try to reason this out re why is this happening well I don't understand why this is happening I don't understand why my computer's going down I don't understand why this has got to happen this way because God's trying to teach David to quit relying upon computers quit relying upon the man's side and take me at my word am I not able I brought it to your attention yesterday when you were out there on that trail I brought it to you I revealed it to you can I not come back and do it again then where is our dependency where is your dependency is it on things is it on your reasoning is it not your feelings your UPS your Downs your mistakes your failures no if you want to look back at your mistakes and failures you're not you're telling me God's not big enough to take care of the matter well I know this and I forget what you know what does God say about it what does his word say about it where's your absolute you're reasoning with the word reasoning well this is Happ because this has happened because I did this and because of that this is going to happen forget your reasoning what's the word say then the simple faith that I'm talking about will take God at his word no other opinion about it no other s with it I I I love to shout I love to I love these things but that's not the evidence I've got the Holy Ghost the evidence is when I see this word a promise for this hour revealed in me and lived out that's the evidence and the carinal man will say but I see what you did and I see what you didn't do and I saw your mistakes and I saw your failures that's the devil doing that that's not God's word god already declared what you are now whether you want want to say in your heart Amen to it and quit your fretting over it and go on that's the victory that overcometh the world even our Revelation God's Own Revelation in me my faith our faith our revelation of Who We Are right amen that's exactly where it lays brother sister I say we better get desperate about it because God God how many know God himself the fullness of God and embodied Christ Jesus and God himself comes right back around and embodies himself The Same Spirit in the form of his bride the same one we've come from the same source that he came from same word manifested for this hour do you realize that the promised word of this hour his promised coming would be in Bride form you say well what do we look at we're waiting for a meeting in the air what are we looking for the last one to get to a maturity that realizes they're the head himself you're in Union with that head what are we here to manest the capping The Headstone message what form is it going to be and he capped off that bride and said this is me came right back on that top of that pyramid where was that headstone all the time where was that Unwritten word of Revelations 10 you say Unwritten yes John was forbidden to write it but brother random said don't you think for a minute that's not hid in the word in here here it's something in the word it's hid in the word but it's not going to be unknown or made known I mean revealed until this end time and that's the corner turn unless you turn that corner you want to run down the straight roll of a Pentecostal message go ahead but God has turned the corner amen you're not going to be perfected under a Pentecostal message that's not contrary to what he said that's exactly what he said because that Pentecostal message which is the is the new birth made way for the Holy Ghost himself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again back to the word again back to what the word again then where's the word again and who's the word I am the word you are the word he's the word and what is it then it's a Oneness of unity it's Oneness again you're the word and I'm the word guess what we are one under one headship and when we turn the corner the Sun come forth in its strength and we have to lay in the presence of that son ripening until we ripen into his very position his very place his who he is what he is that's the bride and she's revealing she's manifesting the son of man again amen that's exactly straight as I know how to take it amen amen that no reason to jump around on it so it's his faith who are you his faith his victory you're his faith and you're his victory no you say well Brother David what your preaching you know that's hard to swallow who's hard to swallow it this flesh man don't believe it but he's brought obedience to it because greater is he that is in me how about you than he that is in the world that inside of the inside man is not worldly this inside man I'm talking about this real me is perfect it's complete it's Christ himself right manifested through flesh good sounding words isn't it good sounding words but where's the Revelation pray for Revelation so somebody's going to have that as a substance well I believe in giving the word a right metal attitude then let's give it a right metal attitude this morning yes you think you're hid from what you're thinking God knows exactly what you're thinking amen amen amen oh well I can't be that I'll just be no you can be that God said you would be that God said this is the bride this is who she is she is the Revelation who are you you're Jesus Christ revealed the Virgin birth of the Bride is Jesus Christ there's no man handling in this virgin birth of the Bride no manhandling no sensation no man handling no denominational man other words flesh manhandling it's absolutely a working of God Perfect by God and she is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today why' he repeat that so many times because that's who you are can we walk forward now from this service recognizing walking at a higher plane than you come in here on recognizing you're a conqueror am you're a conqueror you're more than a conqueror how can I say how can I be more than a conqueror I always liked a minister many years ago had said you remember Muhammad Ali A priz fighter he said he was a prize fighter he was the he was the champion but every bit of that thousands he got guess what he went back and gave it to his wife that's that was what he said I go back and put it in the hands of my wife she takes care of it okay then she's more than a conqueror she partook of what he possessed yeah and become her possession yeah that's exactly what he's done for us amen I've given you everything and you're still belly aching I say quit your belly aching you that know where I'm coming from on that I dad always had a sign up in his office he's an insurance Salman he said quit your belly aching it's all written all in one letter quit your belly aching but it's all not divided out you'd have to look at it look at it oh that's what it's saying that's a revealed mystery and it's a revealed mystery when you can quit your belly aching and recognize that God's done everything he needs to do and you just need to go and possess what he's given if that faith is in you then go possess it if you have the Holy Ghost that I'm talking about living and abiding in you who is the word living not feelings but the word living recognizing the word for the season recognizing the hour you're living in then you then you might as well just quit your belly aing you have nothing to belly ache about nothing to complain about where's your complaining why you murmuring because you're looking at the other side you're not looking in allowing the word to lead you you say Brother David why you talking that way to us because I'm going through the same thing you don't think I have to fight trials and pressures where persecuted yet not cast down or how's that scripture go 2 Corinthians 49 go back and read it and yet all the time at peace seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus rejoicing have joy in my Heart full of joy and that the outward man feel like he's pushed down bent down beat down and the devil said see there see there you're not one of them or you wouldn't be doing the things you're doing but take him back to the word what did my Lord say about me go back to what's revealed to you see said there's my state there's my anchor where's the anchor it's within the veil anchors on the solid Revelation Rock and won't let go of that I don't care how bad the Seas get I don't care how much the boat is broken up I don't care what about it he's still in the ship and if he said we're going to the other side we'll go to the other side right what do you got the belly ache about then why don't we just be happy and realize that nothing can come your way he's not the author of frustration but of peace and you have that peace then let that peace umpire your heart and if the Empire said it's a strike then you settle it in your mind your carnal mind and let go of it it's a strike and go on you know what I'm talking about the Empire of a ball game what if they didn't have an Umpire what if you didn't have a street light everybody's trying to beat the street lights now the red lights because they don't because they're becoming what Lawless just what the Bible said they would become they'll beat the system if they can beat it they'll beat the system they don't care if the police said it they don't care if the magistrate said it but you and I God put those Powers there to God's going to say I'm going to see how you react to it even to the speed limits so don't let that little fox of that outer man don't let the devil come in your senses and declare you're something when you're not that don't let him make you believe that you're identified out here in this old man you're not ident this is not the real me I've already heard from me I've already heard from my theophany I was meant to be that to begin with but sin brought me down here to be tested so that God's attributes can be manifested in in me that's worth everything I said then Lord blessed be your name you've got a reason for me to go through that you've got a purpose for me to go through what I go through and you're perfecting your character you're beating it out of me God had a reason to let that computer fail God had a reason for me not to print this out because he's teaching me it's already in you then preach the message preach the inspiration I give you I've learned a great lesson that may not be so much for you and I but it ought to be for us us because we better not look negatively on what God if you say well God's in complete control bless God then what are you could quit belly aching about he can't allow it to come unless he allowed it he can't have it unless he did allow it then he's made a way out of it oh don't think for a minute I was starting to ding ding no anybody that knows the old typewriters know what I'm talking [Music] about push it over and you start again but you know what in all of that there was an inside man said just rest in me I've given it to you have not you said before out in prayer Lord I know you've given it to me if I don't use anything else then I know you can put it in my heart in my mouth to speak okay okay I'm going to try you on it thank God for victory despite David I still have Victory despite David I'm already free I'm still free despite what I did Satan said see you didn't have faith oh yes I do because that's what conquered it right are you with me amen I've learned a great lesson this morning God help me to quit relying on man's device I think we rely too much on man's devices and when it when it fails oh we failed we don't have the screen working anymore we don't have music anymore the piano is not being played what's that got to do with it God's going to have church anyway that right why are we fretting over those things why do we get fretful and scared to death you're relying upon something that God never sent for you to rely upon amen he's never given you that to rely upon how we going to go home in a Rapture when you try to live as close to sin as you can and compromise because of your feelings because of your reasoning because of what others around you is going to say don't tell me that's not right I'm a man also and don't think I don't get hit with that being a preacher yeah but where am I going to stand where's my stand what position am I going to take in this hour it's too late to be fooling around playing church I'm going to tell you right now it's too late right I said it was too late 25 and 30 years ago it's too late now amen you're either going to be what you're going to be you're going to be the truth or you're not the truth you're either in or you're out there's no halfway in between amen you either give yourself completely wholeheartedly over to this word and let him lead you or you're not now I'm talking about the inward I'm not talking about how you fail out here I'm talking about what is the motive inside are you going to give yourself completely over and then fail and then realize I never failed are you see what I'm saying or are you going to fail and say BL I guess that's it I fall I failed I guess I can't be a Christian I can't even live it he never asked you to live it he said I'll live it are you willing to yield completely with all your heart and sincerity and said I'm giving it over to you and walk out of this and say something you didn't want to say and have to ask forgiveness and still realize it's a finished work that you it doesn't move what you had in your heart from your heart to confess and say why don't you just turn around and say thank the Lord for the trial thank the Lord for the test thank you Lord we can thank him and we ought to be thanking him in all things why does the bible say that because this is the will of God concerning you what is it saying there it's saying that you're going through this by my directing and going through a trial and test to not move you you can't be moved out of me but to show you where your resting place where your where your peace is who you are and where you're standing I pray God help them to see it what we're saying here you can have two things working simultaneously at the same time do you hey raise your hand if you understand it what I'm trying to say to you you have two things happening simultaneously two Natures working but one is overcome one nature and the other can't overcome the other one is that right so where you going to rest where's your peace have you entered into rest what the Bible say when you enter into rest you have ceased from your own labors right I've ceased right not me trying to labor anything he's already sealed me off and said you're secure your owner is myself and it's a finished work that's what the seal signifies now either we believe that and we make a mistake we go right back over that and said but God you said or I say God I don't know understand what I'm going through you never said for me to understand it why because he's given us his mind hello now listen to this carefully his thoughts are higher than David's his ways are higher than David's so if he's given his mind then he's given me rest he's given me peace to know this that he's perfect in his way and his thoughts and he's made my way perfect and if he wants me to understand what he's doing as my shepherd he'll show me if he doesn't show me I still have confidence that he's in control and if you be that word heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall will never pass away and the prophet followed that scripture right up with this he said if you be that word heavens and earth will pass away but you canot fail you cannot pass away heavens and earth shall fail but I can't this little bride will not fail she cannot fall because she predestinated by me ordained by me it is me myself working in her and how can I fail therefore she can't fail she's as perfect as I am and she's LED perfectly and my ways are perfect and I made her way perfect you can sit there this morning and you can think I don't understand I'm trying to reason this thing out what's he trying to say I'm trying to understand forget it quit your trying to understand mentally I'm not explaining anything I'm telling you what the word word said and the revelation of it I can't explain this to you if I could it would be no more faith because faith is a revelation I can't explain it but whether you believe it or not now that's a different thing it's got to either register amen or I don't know about him he's trying to make himself something who does he think he is you see where we're standing crazy unusual to the world Heretics to the human reasoning how can they act so cra why they act crazy they gone off the deep end brother Trevor why have you gone off the deep end thank God I went off the deep end depends what end you want to go off if I go off the deep end then I'm swallowed up I'm over my head with the word and covered I've gone over listen the bride is the word cannot fail cannot pass away you might as well settle that and let it be fixed in your heart right now if you're a Believer you cannot pass away nor fail praise the Lord then rest in it the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I don't have a lack but what he will meet I don't care what the situation is he's going to meet that situation I will not lack he'll make me to lie down why because he's come in me ordering my steps making me to lie down in Green Pastures when I didn't feel like laying down but he maketh me to lie down because he is the energy he is the energy of this Branch amen don't try to come in some other way you've got to come through the door Jesus said I am the door to the Sheep full there can't come no other way but through him amen and in order to come through him you had to be in him to begin with amen that's exactly what it is I can't say who is and who isn't but by their fruit fruits they are known you notice Jesus said in Matthew 2435 heavens and earth will pass away but my words plural yeah shall not pass away You're the word I'm the word the body of Christ is the word every member is the word my words will not pass away amen it cannot return void do you realize that the word of God today you are that word cannot return void it's got to accomplish what it was sent to do so cheer up let me see a smile on your face amen start acting on the word how can you be anything but happy when you start acting on the word amen just take it you don't have to put your opinion on it forget your opinion of the outer man he'll give you your opinion he doesn't understand why it's happening go back and say but God you said the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord and all things work together for good to them that love God called according to his purpose and the steps are ordered amen is that right he's working in me both will and to do of his good pleasure I've raised from the dead already raised from the dead I'm not going to raise I've already raised all that's got to catch up now is the quickening power that changed me and res what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is he's risen in me I've risen with him then it's finished it's finished there won't be many new births but there's no reason why you can't be one of them if that pull is inside your heart you get to where the source is and quit you're running from the presence of God and start running into it let's stand thank you Lord maybe I can start closing on time for a while now no you know what I I'm going to I'm sorry I said that it's his leadership I'm depending on whether it's on time in our minds or our reasoning or it isn't I'm not depending on myself and I trust you're not depending on yourself because you're wretched remember in my flesh that is Paul said in me that is to say in my flesh there dwelleth no good thing amen then how can you let it lead you when God's given you his word to lead you oh you say but I just not I'm not intellectual enough to listen You'll quit your worrying about whether you're intellectual enough get him inside of you and bring these things to your remembrance what you need to know and show you isn't that what he said we go back to St John 16 would he not show you will he not hear what the word said will he not receive it then it's all given to you right there the spirit of God comes in he'll lead you into all truth amen when he the comforter has come he will lead you into all truth I just feel I need to read that let's and let me just let me just while you're standing here let me read that and then I want to finish something here just give me about just a few couple minutes here in think about that now well it just slipped my mind now let's don't read it then you're right John 16 thank you brother John 16 see Satan tried to hide that didn't he John 16 watch the evidence here and let start with about 13th how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you where's our confidence where's our confidence in the outer man our reasoning well you know I've got to have my beauty rest I can't go to church where's your reasoning did not he say to come can he not give you two hours of sleep and feel like it's eight he can give you eight hours of sleep in two it's our filthy reasoning that gets in the way I'm not just making that example I'm talking about anything it's your reasoning that gets in the way it's your old carnal self we limit him when he's unlimited right Hallelujah why don't we start living and walking with Christ as a as an def as a a invincible people army you can't be defeated live with him walk with him walk if you walk in the spirit Galatians said you'll not fulfill the lust of the Flesh and I was going to go over there let me just read that real quick for the flesh lusteth against the spirit see there but who are you the spirit capital S so the flesh lusteth against it what is

nature as long as you're living here in this body but you can rule it with the word and we are made Kings and Priests rulers we start we just need to rule our ground amen all right not everybody else's yours okay for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would then that sound like Romans 7 but Paul said I don't live by this mind I live by the mind of godj that's what he said right in that scripture but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law amen amen amen oh Satan will take the law and said but you did this you said this but God the judges come back and said there's no record there's no record of it there's no book that even declares it they're free they're in me case is dismissed you have no case Satan you have no case I think you ought to tell them that every day you have no case against me my judge and my the and my judge and my attorney said I am completely delivered and free I am perfect he said I'm perfect he said I'm complete and he said I'm in the blood under the blood and how can you be anything but under the blood be be perfect and
