I'd Rather Have Jesus and to let him leave and to be King above [Music] I'd Rather Have Jesus then anything this world of forced today than to be a king of a vast no man and be held incense transway and right there have Jesus anything [Music] this world affords today same into that tonight amen how beautiful to be thinking of the things that God has already said in order for Saints to know that by his grace and mercy now sometimes we just come to places in our life and God says you know what I want to as it were I want to um make a point I want you to see something I want you to understand something and you know when he opens our eyes of understanding and I believe each one of us can say Amen to that when we see that God does something that's beyond our Thinking Beyond our intellect and I was just reading a few mornings ago I guess it would have been last week uh and and uh the morning there and I come uh into first Peter and uh it's just a lovely book got a lovely many many lovely things and so this evening I would that you would kind of follow with me that I'm taking a thought out of this scripture now not to do away with what the scripture says here but I want to take as it were you might say an expanded thought uh from that and uh so I want to speak to you tonight the war within and the war without in other words the war on the inside and the war on the outside and if we just stand for the reading of the word tonight that was a beautiful beautiful song service appreciated that amen uh we just turned to First Peter the second chapter and the 11th verse and we're going to take a thought from that and uh like I said want to take this in kind of a expanded uh uh format as it were to be able to uh just draw a thought out of that first Peter the second chapter verses 11 and 12. dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly loss so talking in a Physical Realm now choose our words carefully here fleshly lust does not always mean as it were to the opposite if you understand what I'm saying it's the same in when you study it deeper to the context of coveting envying these kind of things but yet it does we don't want to skip over where it where it is at abstain from fleshly Lofts and this is a thought that struck me so solidly the other morning which war against the soul having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers now you're going to see that more and more saints that you are going to be considered the evil doer and those of the perverse nature right we're good is evil and evil is good they speak of you against you as evil doers they may by your good works which they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation Heavenly Father we just ask you to come tonight help me Lord father just to express this correctly give us guidance give us Direction be with each and every one who is not here tonight father for the prayer request Lord we think of our sisters Lord with cancer Lord we just ask you to touch each one of them Father Lord we love you we appreciate you we thank you tonight for your grace and your mercy in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated so as we look at this it struck me as I was reading it that it is there that it's telling us if you abstain from this then these things war against the soul and those words war against the soul struck me and I thought you know uh so much uh of the time my brother and sister uh we want to to look at things and uh we take things into you might say the personal realm or or the flesh realm and and if we're not careful the word of God the prophet talks about it a lot says that we should be as Sons and Daughters of God moved up into Heavenly places in other words you've got to move out of the place that uh your flesh is controlling your life and it doesn't necessarily mean that your flesh is doing evil but I believe all of us could could relate to a time that maybe something happens and it feels as though there is like a depression or something presses upon you you and it can be hard or difficult to break through that and so it's there in that realm that we want to realize that uh it is that uh this is a Warfare can we say Amen to that is definitely a Warfare this is not just we are coasting through a life trying by some intellectual or actions or checking the right box but truly it is a Warfare and so it is my brother and sister uh we recognize what the Warfare is about it is not that Satan cares really about the flesh now the flesh becomes the obvious key as it were of what Satan's influence is we we cannot be living in overcoming life and the flesh be under control to uh other Spirits so the the real gist of what I'm starting this evening is is this war is against the soul it is not my brother and sister a war against this flesh but it is a war against the soul and when we can catch that as a key a real key my brother and sister will realize what Satan is doing and what is happening around us in Ephesians the sixth chapter we could just look at that real quick the tenth verse he says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord now see he's not telling us to be strong in some kind of physical fitness or some kind of that all of those things are good in the right measure in the right place it is not for us to be strong economically it's not for us to be strong in personality but it is to be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might to put on the whole armor of God that you might be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil and while I don't want to get personal tonight I believe I could lift my hand for every one of us and say we have experienced The Wiles of the devil he is a very very clever I don't take that back I don't know why forgive me but when I think of the word Wiles I think as a comic that was very popular when I was a kid of Wiley the Coyote and so you know he was always there trying to outsmart the Roadrunner now look at how all the clevers if you're familiar with that cartoon all the clever things he tried my brother and sister and sometimes it seemed for certain it would work but the way the gist or the nature of that comic was that it just continually failed and I reason I bring that up is because that is what's happening in the day that we're doing Satan coming and he's Wily he's clever he's studying and he's setting the Trap but by God's grace amen the presence of God in our life we don't show up for the Trap amen God stops us God turns us God brings us another Avenue and so Satan constantly Desiring to overcome my brother and sister you realize when you see someone under the In the Flesh under the effects of Satan you are not looking at Satan's goal was he didn't say I'm going to go out and control their flesh he said if I have their soul and I conquer their spirit I have their flesh so he doesn't fight for the flesh he's fighting on a much greater scale and sometimes we stop and say oh Lord you know I I just feel this and I feel that but look at this my brother and sister they have put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not amen we're all familiar with this scripture we wrestle not against flesh and blood so we often times kind of see adversaries might say coming against us and we say Okay Lord we're not fighting against flesh and blood it's against principalities and powers of Darkness but my brother and sister we got to take this tonight if you would just give me liberty that we are not wrestling against ourself and Satan is not wrestling against you for your flesh but it's much deeper it's against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world now to be a ruler in the darkness of this world my brother and sister and they will acknowledge it in the world today a politician to be successful has sold his soul to someone it is simply impossible to rise to the highest echelons of power without having made promises and Promises must be paid and so there's always an agenda and the devil's always got an agenda no matter how beautiful it looks in the beginning there's an agenda and spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore taken to you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand don't be buffeted don't be blown around by everything that happens see this is not against flesh and blood my brother and sister even though it feels like it sometimes doesn't it just feels like it's just a frontal assault against our our body against our being but look how sneaky Satan is the very thing that he really wants he pushes into the background Satan never comes face to face to humanity whether it introduces a child or a teenager to their first cigarette or their first drink to the evils we won't even go into that portion tonight but the evils that is present in the world today he doesn't say when I introduce you to this you'll give me your soul in exchange he doesn't say that he says they're trying to keep you from what you rightly deserve this is your body isn't that familiar in the world we live in today this is your body you can do what you want with it and so what happens is is Satan never comes and tells them what he's really wanting but he puts that in the background now my brother and sister it's there and he tries to keep and put the focus as much as he can on the Flesh and we live now if I'm speaking to you tonight I am speaking to you just because I'm speaking to myself and so it's there that we we oftentimes find ourselves putting way too much focus on the flesh I want I need Satan puts focus on the flesh and to satisfy a certain ingredient or element that God placed in US he also puts focus on religion now when I put it that way he's not making Focus on you receiving the Holy Ghost he's not making focus on you finding a one-on-one relationship with him it is a focus on religion and religion inherently is a covering so as long as you feel covered then all is well and so as he puts his Focus as much as he can on the flesh my brother and sister it's in that place that we if we're not careful and not led by the spirit of God we will find ourselves living according to the Flesh and now this isn't even just the whole thing of the wickedness out here and I just hope this little analogy or example would would register with you they tell you through research that the first couple bites that you might take of something that would be sweet or let's just uh everybody likes chocolate well most everybody likes chocolate but you realize the first couple bites of chocolate that you take is the highest sensory value you will have the rest you partake in is because of the sensory value that touched you and you could eat a pound of chocolate and it won't taste one drop better than the first bite because that peaked your sensory now I share that because this is what Satan's doing in the world someone does something it Peaks their sensory value to that right there and it's not that they would go away and say this is as good as it gets they are constantly trying to come back to that point or exceed that point that's what causes people to take more and more and more drugs is because they're trying to reach that sensory value that they re received the first time and so even in the cares of life and the pleasures of life what Satan's doing is he's not focusing you don't see Satan saying hey you need to be concerned about your soul today Satan says why don't you be concerned about your flesh why don't you see if the pleasure of the day cannot reach this pleasure cannot reach this pleasure I know as a young man that I have to admit I kind of became an adrenaline junkie and that's what drives you as you're looking for the next Big Thrill you're looking for the next and whatever you might do that is of that nature you just gotta you gotta try and get back to that point and my brother and sister in that realm that is just trying to satisfy the flesh there is nothing of Eternal value there there is nothing that will carry you uh through the dark or hard times of your life and so puts this focus on the Flesh and he puts it as it would be to give us some degree of comfort on religion so it it comes as such of anointing that uh even my brother and sister Satan has been so clever I've dealt with I won't say I'll say a lot but it's not like we're talking dozens and dozens but I've dealt with plenty of people finally when you get down to the root of it they're angry with God I just watched a little clip the natural disaster that took place I don't know that it was actually in the country of Indonesia but over in that area horrific tragedy and the reporters interviewing someone and this young woman says if God would allow this I'll never acknowledge Him again how clever Satan is the scripture says these things happen to the righteous and the unrighteous but Satan's so clever to come in to call someone to say this caused death this caused destruction this affected my family this affected my life and God allowed that I'll never acknowledge Him ever again you see what has happened is they've come into a time of trouble 's in their life and they give the credit as it were to an Angry God that's how Satan has confused them and how he has so directed this that they they come and say God must be angry and I wouldn't serve an Angry God therefore I won't serve God at all I won't even speak his name my brother and sister sometimes these troubles of Life As I said taking this out of Ecclesiastes these troubles come to the righteous and the unrighteous to the rich and to the poor until the wise and the unwise they happen otherwise if I would say this our brother Mike oldtake being struck by someone driving out of control God must have been angry at him no God says I have a plan and I will prove that I am God and when that life is in you Desiring then you don't look at that and say why didn't God keep me from this we look at this and say Lord what is it you are doing I want to be a part of that if I have to give my life my brother and sister imagine Shadrach Meshach and Abednego walking up the ramp as it were being escorted pushed into their them poor as I've spoke before I feel sorry for them poor soldiers that had to give their life for an angry king but Shamrock Meshach and Bendigo didn't say oh my you know what brother this is malfunctioned we're being thrown into fiery furnace maybe we should have re we reconsidered we could have secretly serve God we could have bowed and then repented but there was something in them that says you know what I am not backing up I know who I am and I know what my God has told me and he said that I'm not supposed to bend my knee to any other God and I'm telling you my brother and sister we don't need a big statue somewhere to say another God there's Gods everywhere in this world right here God's of prosperity and a pleasure and of knowledge and all of this and there's many bowing their knee to those Gods but I want to be a Shadrach Meshach and Abednego the prophet of God said God knew what he was doing and he waited till they had been thrown in the furnace and he met them there couldn't he have done something different couldn't he have just changed the heart of the king couldn't he of course he could but he chose to let you and I go through some hard trials or fiery furnace and then he chooses to remind us it's not about our flesh that's not what the Bible is about it's not our flesh you know people look at this and seems unlike in the last while uh I I have dealt with people talk to people tried to encourage people along these lines and people you know they want to know why God hasn't fixed their relationships they wonder why God doesn't come and do something about their health and I don't mean to throw Brothers under the bus but I just remember one time a minister I'll just leave it at that you know he said you people that think you can take Pepsi and chips and pray over it and it'll be good for you foreign yeah I'm not real fond of green things but there comes a point in your life you start realizing that God created those for a purpose and there wasn't to be decorations and people look at this and they say why is my health as it is some people look at success or lack of they say why are they doing good and I'm struggling why are things like they are or see people who suddenly become prosperous and that destroy their families find people with that kind of success and they never acknowledge that God was behind it was always about themselves I I some are successful and call it luck some call it personal but all of that is designed to draw attention from one thing and that is the soul it demeans the value of a personal relationship of Jesus with Jesus Christ and puts it on external we have a whole religious thing happening in the world has been for quite a few years you know name it and claim it and you're a greater Christian the greater wealth that you have uh the more money that pours in I I have watched many testimonials one that I'm reminded of of this couple that you know went to these meetings went to a deal and and uh it became Revelation to them and and their prayers morning noon and night their prayers were for Success so they could do something for God and then success came giant house in Palm Springs big pool in the backyard exotic cars expensive clothes and jewelry and ultimately did Led them down the road that their children fell apart and they ended up in divorce is that God you see what happened Satan got them to turn their focus remember they started if you'll bless us Lord we'll do something for the kingdom Satan brought them to go over into the realm of the flesh now imagine that same couple if they had been true to their prayers to God and as the money flowed in they had given it to the right things and done I believe just like I believe in the Rich Young Ruler I believe God would have continued to prosper them and their family would have been intact and they would have been strong spiritual fortresses as it were but you see Satan has a way of getting the focus to turn to the flesh who doesn't want to live in a nicer house drive a nicer car wear nicer clothes it is just a matter of humanity but who would also like the temple not made with hands to be presentable to be clean and made ready for the greatest gift and the greatest guest there could ever be that is to look inward into the soul and not outward to the flesh but Satan come on let's be real Saint Satan anoints us we go shopping oh there's a better barbecue Milwaukee just came out with a better tool you don't walk into Home Depot or Lowe's or any of these places and walk out saying I need to read my Bible more you walk out with the plans in your hand for a bigger deck and a better this and a better that because Satan so cleverly has got us to stop looking at the soul and saying oh I want I desire this is it I must have that oh if I I say this a little bit in Jess but I say this in seriousness also if sometimes we had a great desire to possess more of God as we did to own more Milwaukee Tools I'm guilty I was just in there the other day I'm like Oh my look how nice these are oh if I just had this one I could do this and that but what they don't sell is five gallon buckets full of enthusiasm so you can own all the tools and never use them I hope you'll take that both ways we can have everything but if we never use it but Satan focusing towards these things and and so we look and and uh is designed to draw us away from actually stopping and taking time now Saints if you're with me that's fine you don't have to say Amen tonight or not I I just kind of was a little troubled struggled a little bit on presenting this because it almost sounds kind of pointed but I certainly don't mean it that way but my brother and sister we need to take the time to stop and just say Lord let me take this moment don't let the phone ring don't let the door be knocked upon the doorbell let me just take this time and just focus on my soul lord where am I what is happening in my life and what is my focus at this moment but Saints I don't know about you it seems around our house you get down to pray or you get down reading your Bible and your phone will ring someone will knock on the door the dogs bark at a sparrow and distract you see Satan's there because he doesn't want you to look in the soul realm he wants you to keep it at the flesh level read the Bible and see all the blessings that are in the Bible we tend to jump over the corrections somebody say Amen we jump over the corrections because it's hard for the flesh to come face to face with itself just it is when we get old it's hard to come face to face with your mortality um now let's look here at this rate I'm going to have you all crying out of something I don't know tonight and now how Satan tries to pervert this satisfying of the Soul that thirst for the soul do you know what I'm talking about what brother Brown's talking about first that's what brought us where we are tonight was that thirst it was an intellectual my brother and sister oh the message can be into electoralized very well but that is not what brought us here it was a thirsty it's what draws one out of a whole family why wouldn't we all just remain I've sat there with a brother and he explained to me how his family has just struggled so hard with him their relationship with him and I said why are they struggling brother and he said because when I witnessed the message to them they look at him and say of our whole family why you and he said I would sit down later by myself and say yeah Lord of my whole family why me but then God takes us in the realm and there's a thirst there is something that needs something and it has to be found he tries to give you everything to satisfy it he is so deceitful in these days of perversion this is a perverted world my brother and sister of this 1965. if it was a perverted World in 1965 what would you call it today and the insanity isn't all outside the walls people come right in I want my little boy I wanted a girl so I'm just going to turn my little boy into a girl and then they proceed to destroy lives because of perversion it's a perverted race it's a perverted people everything is perverted and has perverted so gradual think about this you know it's interesting when I was a little kid we lived oh I don't know exactly what it is I'm going to say three four miles Beyond Wilder and to the South is where my dad had a dairy and we as kids got such a novel idea we're going to ride our bicycles to Caldwell you know what our parents well they said you can do it go ahead you know what their warning to us was there was no warning about don't talk to strangers don't do this don't do that don't get run over on the highway but now you wouldn't hardly dare to put your children out there if you expected to see them again it's changed that much it's perverted so gradual until it's become the most deceitful age any human being ever lived in it's more deceitful than it ever was and so we see what this is and Satan says you know what I'm going to give you everything I can give you to satisfy the thirst you know it's a interesting story of a brother that I I don't know the brother but I know very much about him I know people very close to this brother backslid as a Young Man went out in the world married a young lady had a start of a family was wildly successful in business literally making millions of dollars a year had everything every kind of boat every kind of travel trailer every kind of vehicle Monster House and at 40 odd years old about 45 years old found himself increasingly unsatisfied with his life and because he was a very Savvy businessman he started looking around and saying you know what I've got a good family I've got money I've got all these things I have plenty of time why am I not satisfied and actually come to a place one day he got down as it were first time in years and said God what is this that's wrong with me and from that moment it was over and he realized I left God all those years ago and The Thirst has come back the story you might say has a great ending but it has a terrible ending he had family that were still in church and he started interacting with them and they started encouraging him he even went to a few meetings and stuff like that everything is okay because they're still going to the lake they're still taking their vacations to Europe they're still doing everything that they do but one day when he tells his wife I'm going to go back and I'm going to serve God within a week she filed divorce papers and found a good lawyer that cleaned him very thoroughly and then his question was Lord why would I be in my mid-40s sleeping on my own brother's couch we'll get to the answer in just a minute see there's you might call it a fight as it is because that's what happens in Warfare right there has to be a fighter it's not a war if you walk out and just run up the White Flag that's not war and Truce is my brother and sister are not the end or the cessation of warfare that is merely a delay of an ultimate uh uh settlement that must take place so you can come and say we're going to have a truce that's not the end of it too many people have a truce with the Devil they're waving a flag saying hey how about you don't bother me I won't bother you but my brother and sister this Warfare that takes place and tells Satan has the soul he will lie cheat steal and use every subterfuge he can to try to conquer that it's Warfare Can someone say that with me it's Warfare this is not a game we're in Saints we're not just going to church it's Warfare and it was all designed to draw attention away from the soul so here we have a battle going on to satisfy the soul you can satisfy I heard a brother put it this way he said the most unhappy person on Earth he used brother but I'm changing it to person on Earth is a backslidden believer most miserable person on Earth they don't want to be around anybody they don't want to talk to anybody they don't want no part of these things they go and they occupy their time here and occupy their time there but the truth of it is is they're not wanting to deal with the Warfare the scripture warns us about being weary and well doing I would ask tonight that you would give me the privilege to change that and not become weary in Warfare not sit down on the battlefield just because the battle has went for so long his mercies are fresh are new every single morning and so if we are there entering in then we will have the strength for the Battle of that day so as we look at this you say what was the answer for this this I call him young man now what was the answer for this young man that the Lord spoke to him when he said Lord how is it after literally being worth millions of dollars having this business and it's all collapsed around me what is it Lord and the Lord spoke to him and said one soul is worth ten thousand worlds and he realized the value he had placed was on the things of the flesh and God was giving him a wake-up call and saying the value I place on you has nothing to do with your flesh and fleshly things it has all to do with your soul and while his life was not good dealing with things of visitation and all this kind of things he found a piece in his life because he realized that God had just done him the greatest service that could be done and that would be to redeem this soul and bring it back and show the value of the Soul amen the prophet of God speaks of it many times a soul being worth ten thousand worlds you notice if you go study this and I've looked through just I don't know if I would say hundreds but maybe it was hundreds of of quotes related to this of comments related to this you'll find there's never a mention of the value of the Flesh in that equation never says your Soul's worth ten thousand world but your flesh is worth this and I tell you I say that in that context but the prophet of God did talk about the value of the Flesh and at that time I forget now what it was here I'm just getting all excited but you know what it is current I just looked it up today in case you want to know and it's currently under inflation you have about one dollars worth of elements in your body now if you don't mind your body being dismembered and your kidneys sold here and this Soul there and whatever else you might be worth a few hundred thousand okay it's kind of disgusting when you look study that part yeah healthy kidney in China could be worth as much as 245 thousand dollars oh very racist if you're white a Chinese kidney is worth considerably less I'm not sure why and I'm not going to find out why but look at this spoke you know the quotes you know the story as it were that we'll put 500 suits and I think it was 89 cents worth of elements inflation's got us to a dollar maybe a dollar and a half and we look at that what is it God's telling you look I'm sorry your soul on this side the scale worth ten thousand worlds your flesh on this side worth nothing and yet the devil causes us to Pander to the flesh over and over again now if this comes out a little hard just say ouch okay that'll be as good as an amen tonight just say ouch but you see my brother and sister God's wanting us to see that we are too focused he said you know what the prophet of God says what we need to do is get behind the veil which is to get Beyond the Veil of this flesh yet behind the veil into the Shekinah Glory and rise up into Heavenly places nothing about if your flesh wants to but I won't make it a direct quote tonight but the prophet of God lays the foundation that it would be more on the order of if you will allow yourself to I Die daily was the Apostle Paul's words could we hold to that could we take the Apostle Paul's words and say let them be my words prophet of God the Apostle Paul's teaching so tightly to the bride of Christ that I'm preaching Paul's message to you and they said oh that's good enough that's close enough no they said we're counting on that we're holding to that why because he knew that was a standard that God had placed that was you know as we use the term that was the gold standard are we going to hold the gold standard tonight Lord let me die daily let me die daily don't let my flesh rule you see the problem people have when they get caught under that anointing is they believe if they die daily that they won't enjoy their life but I'm telling you my brother and sister there's nothing like the Liberty that's found in Jesus Christ that's when you really start to enjoy life amen why because as we read the scriptures in our opening when we are caught up in that lust of the flesh there's a war taking place in US come on y'all quiet tonight my wallet's in the back office I got a 50 bill in there maybe I need to offer that for an amen but I know it's the truth because we're not much different all of us amen when we do and say and act upon things that we know have grieved the Holy Spirit it puts such a damper on us and such a Warfare in us that we will not be able to say oh brother I'm in Heavenly places it would be more like Lord help me but I feel like I'm plowing the gutter because we were never designed to be in that place let me say that again you as the bride of Christ were never designed to be in that place God designed you for Heavenly places that means that we cannot let Satan bring us to the place that our flesh is controlling our life we were designed to come to the place that if our flesh has not rulers hip over us we stop and say Lord forgive me and we say to our our spouses or our children or our parents forgive me because there's the Liberty from the Warfare we weren't designed to be under a Warfare condemnation is a Warfare conviction brings peace condemnation brings more distress now in Matthew 16 are we all right in Matthew 16 24 then said Jesus and to his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it now let's take this when he's talking about Savings in his life he's actually my brother and sister it's not out of context to say whosoever will decide to Forfeit the kingdom for their flesh is going to lose their flesh anyhow right because we just have a season don't want to sound morbid but kids when you're 12 13 14 15 20. 80 sounds old when you start knocking on the doorstep of 80 as it were you know you see the Mast of it just over the horizon don't seem very old at all do everything to preserve it you know some of them ex-hollywood people you know oh so and so she's had six face to live that won't do one thing for her she's preserving trying to preserve the flesh but we stand on the principles because he says you know what for whosoever will save his life will lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake see there's the quantifier not just losing it for something I went to the jungles and I went here and I went there and I helped the poor no you got to lose it for him shall find it for what is a man prophet of he shall gain the whole world right everything the flesh wants but come to a place that will lose his own soul see this is putting it right here in the balance before us Saints putting it very very balanced for us and what shall a man give in exchange for his soul well none of us will I don't believe ever how billionaire in front of our name but I can assure you that when God called the Rich Young Ruler he would have gladly gave him everything but he'd been given the opportunity he went to the market as it were and was given an opportunity Trade It trade it and follow me now I believe most of you would still recognize this I don't say this as Doctrine but I just believe in principle that it's true that the Rich Young Ruler would have said okay Lord I will sell everything I've got and I will give it to the poor and I will follow you see God puts in US gifts and it's just a personal thought okay nobody make Doctrine out of this don't take it but I want you to see what it is that what God's placed in you in ability that God doesn't just take that back when you serve him if you're good at math you get saved your memory doesn't you know you don't know how to do math now because you're saved no imagine the Rich Young Ruler saying I'll do that Lauren calls up his investment banker and says yeah the XYZ Company sell it and the guy's like okay what's going on just sell it well my sold for twice as much as we thought it would sell for then his investment bankroll call him the next morning and say did you know the stock in such and such tripled last night the whole time he's out Lazarus would have never been laying on the curb in sight of his mansion he would have said build a hospital and help this man and his investment banker would have called him up said you're never going to believe this but that old Barren ground you bought years ago on a whim outside the city is worth a hundred million dollars here more money because that was a gift God gave you now my brother and sister I hope you can make sense of this the gift that God has given us that matters I don't mean to be personal but some of you can do computer stuff and you can do it well in your company acknowledges you do that well and some of us we wouldn't have a clue but there's other things we do well there's things that we do and people would come and pardon me it touches those in the church here touches even myself and some people say they just drive a truck good you go drive that truck yeah see if you can even get it out of the parking lot but you know the gift that God has given us that we do well as we hear the word we hear the word of God it isn't a foreign sound to us it's real and it's alive and it makes a difference and the other part of that gift is when we have heard the word we're able to take that word and if you just bear with me digest that word and put it into action because it's not just hearing the word we must be doers of the word also my brother and sister what separates the bride from the rest of the world because we hear the word we receive the word and we act on the word and the word is changing us amen that is a gift from God oh otherwise we would teach the world we would teach the world how to do that but you can't amen see never in the scripture where you find Value placed upon them flesh you see the battle on the outside is real come on Saints there's some of you ought to be saying that's the truth the batter on the battle on the outside is the truth we can't diminish that and it seems to be the greatest battle prophet of God preached greatest battle ever fought we'd say okay it has to be the mind but you realize my brother and sister that these two still don't have any value the battle in the mind nowhere in the Scripture it says what would you give for your mind but these are the Avenues that Satan assaults us from but they're still avenues that are connected as it were in the flesh Hallelujah well won't we just argue on where the greatest battle takes place say only what the prophet said you're off the word well okay I'm not going to argue with you but I'm telling you I know people that can quote the Bible to you forwards and backwards they can quote the message to you forward and backwards and they have no battle in the mind and you know why because they can quote it no sir because it's settled in the soul you say they never have a battle oh oh they have a battle you know how the battle starts you can go study history and look back on this it's Town starts by the blowing of a horn or a trumpet and the waving of the penance now who's the devil going to fight for when he looks out and he blew the horn and he waved the pennant and he looks and all he sees is the blood of Jesus Christ where's the battle did the prophet of God not say that Brother David just quoted I don't know I think brother Chris quoted it here recently I know I quoted it here recently my brother and sister you know you get under the blood amen and if the Devil Comes under the blood with you he'd be your brother that's how powerful the blood is there's the answer to our Warfare is because we stand my brother and sister and decide we're going to settle this with the devil on our own and then we wonder why we get beat up like the seven sons of Siva amen then we're like oh why this happens and then we Face another battle because if our heart condemns us not then we have confidence so Satan's working the avenue to bring condemnation into our life so that when we come to church we can't worship because we got some other thoughts on our mind that we're saying oh Lord forgive me we're sending in church you know like a brother told me one time he says brother Paul I got so many things I need to set right with the Lord I said didn't said it right he said well I don't know the scripture says that if you take communion unworthily that you are guilty of the body and the blood of Jesus Christ and he said there's been so many times in my life I repented of things walking up the aisle to take communion were you sincere brother oh you better believe I was sincere so it would have been better if you had found a priest to make that repentance would have been better if you had done it two weeks ago is it not sufficient to have a harsh desire to take communion I think I broke his little little prison wide open I said Do You Realize as you were walking up to take communion the ghost said I will not allow you to take it unworthily and as he's walking up the aisle his heart is heavy Lord I said this Lord I've done this Lord forgive me he thought he was just saving face to continue to take go forward and take communion but does the scripture ask us not whether we have to confess again and again to be forgiven of our sin is one sincere repentance sufficient I ask you tonight is one sincere repentance sufficient then who's talking to him who's talking to him as a war counting the mind as part of the body part of the flesh it is the flesh that is talking to him but the Holy Spirit dealt with that brother so that he would not come and take communion unworthy and he was there just shocked breaking down in tears it's like you mean God cared enough to not even let me make it up there before I said Lord please forgive me I said brother God loves you that much amen but the flesh said my oh my have I confused you yet not even an answer oh my god well so the word what does it do it tells us put on the whole armor of God to guard ourselves let's not let the devil make this about our flesh Saints let's come to a place where recognizing who we are in Jesus Christ and when we recognize who we are and that we have the ability to step behind the veil into the very presence of Jesus Christ then my brother and sister let's not let Satan make this about your flesh let's not not let him now I'm going to ask y'all a personal question and most of you won't raise your hand some of you won't even blink but have any of you ever been offended let's see let me just look at your faces I hear no response I can just look at faces yep yep I can see it I know I offended brother Trevor him and I went out in the alley and fought amongst the trash cans and we got it all settled praise the Lord hallelujah but look at this my brother and sister why did we get offended well they were rude what would have happened if you'd have poured Grace and blood all over them well it might have changed them no it would have changed you by the ACT they would have changed you by the very Act of pouring the blood of Jesus Christ over them prayer amen and putting Grace on them so what do we do we get our feelings hurt we get emotions now look emotions can be my brother and sister a sensation I've told you all before about it and I'll just give you a very brief as a young child my mother's seeking seeking things of God wanting more of the Lord and going to a meeting I can drive you right to the the church building today tonight where it took place and my mom on the platform with a whole bunch of other people predominantly women and as the preacher come along and did almost like a Benny Hinn thing and if you don't know what that is you can Google it and a Benny Hinn thing and these people are falling down and I remember as a kid just being in awe to watch someone fall over and their head bounce off the floor that's not playing the man comes to my mother nothing happens my mom's like Lord please Lord please Lord please and a man does him grabs her forehead just looks at her goes on very next person bam very next person bam there were several in that group that were friends with my mother I rode home with my mother that night that memory is burnt in my mind I think my mom ran a stop sign drove down the center line everything just crying out to God why why why I tell you why all of her friends in a few short years had earrings plastered in their ears I'm not judging don't you misunderstand me hair is short is mine living any old way oh life was slain in the spirit oh my brother and sister God's leading his dear children alone God is protecting us God's not wanting to call a truce with the Devil the scripture says we would walk out on the ashes of the wicked we're not going to build a habitation next to them amen I'm not coming across too harsh am I I don't I don't mean it harsh see we're not going to let Satan bring offenses it's not gonna the Lord's not going to let us fall under false anointed brother Chris and I was talking about the other day I hope I don't steal his Thunder but my brother and sister false anointed ones at the end time listen to it read it it's actually a startling sermon when you think about the very fact that people can be so anointed and it not be an anointing on the soul it's on the flesh and so we don't want to be those people my brother and sister not being judgmental but we don't want to be those people that are just anointed on the flesh I wanted to make it down into the soul and if I have to pay a greater price a greater consecration then I say Lord let it come and let me pay that price because it won't do one bit of good to have it on our flesh all the days of our life and hear those words depart from me we want it to be the real thing my brother and sister we don't need envies and we don't need Strife coming in we need a a good holy ghost moving amen so let's not make it about the things related to flesh so well I felt about this I had people tell me before now if this applies to you please forgive me but I've had people tell me I I just I just that that didn't feel right it's a word it's a word don't tell me how you felt about it it was the word it wasn't me it wasn't the other preacher it was the word I don't care how you felt about it it was the word instead of saying Lord correct me Here I Am Lord correct me they wanted to correct the word now I'm telling you my brother and sister it'll never go anywhere they'll never go any deeper than their feelings if they let their feelings make those decisions now let's go here into this another quote out of the sermon thirst a little farther down greater should be the thirst of any soul for the Waters of life than to say you belong to a church The Thirst of the Soul can't be satisfied the real true thirst it can be perverted you can think you're all right when you join church but that isn't it that won't satisfy the genuine holy thirst for God it just simply won't do it it's just not there now David said in Psalms 42 7 here when the deep calleth into the deep at the noise of thy water spout the souls call does anyone ever experienced that yeah yeah come on we got a better response in this church than that don't we hey man we wouldn't be here tonight if it wasn't something deep within us crying you wouldn't let me be beating up on you there wasn't something deeper than just going to church otherwise we would just have church services that talked about how important we are and how good God is and all the blessings he's going to pour out and everybody's going to walk out saying that's good that's good and live lives that won't match the word I'd rather take the risk I believe oh my which one of those I can't think of which one of those preachers it was I think it was it doesn't matter you're right Jerry he said we got a choice you can be offended At Me Now or offended at me then take your choice yeah my I'm not looking to offend you the Soul's call look I've often used this in illustration if there's a fin on the fish's back it had to be put there for him to swim with he has need for that now what if he'd say I'm going to be a different fish I'm going to be a smart educated fish ah huh I'll just I'm going to believe some real theology I believe I don't have to have that fin he wouldn't get very far in the water would he and that's exactly right amen and what if a tree said now I know there had to be an earth first for me to grow in that's right I'm supposed to grow in the Earth but I'm going to be a different tree I want them to just set me out here in the middle of the street so I can be noticed see he wouldn't live very long see that's right when a deep calleth to the deep it takes more than joining a church it takes more than shaking hands with the preacher it takes more than living a good straight life it takes something to satisfy the inside of you that pours down from God right not Pours Down from church not Pours Down from here or from there it pours down from God amen two people too many people keep looking back to the church oh we have just had a conversation here the other day we have just the most dynamic pastor felt like saying you have scripture for that and when thou in laodicea have a dynamic pastor Thou shalt overcome all things no sir no sir dynamic is interpreted as our pastor has more personality than your pastor come on you never hear the word dynamic and dull in the same description you see what's happened you want to check it out spend the time go back what the prophet of God said they'll be looking for that really smart good-looking curly-haired guy that can hold their attention that's dynamic had a brother tell me one time he says well brother Paul he said nobody sits on the front row in our church I was like well praise God we have some he goes oh no it's not that they don't want to he says I just get so excited sweat flying everywhere and spitting now just nobody wants to sit there anymore because they have to take a shower and I thought well my goodness this brother he's not a get up there oh man I've heard a calf with a twisted gut sound like that I know that's a little rough we don't have Twisted God we're not calves we're Sons and Daughters of God there's something that's alive in us there's something alive in us my brother and sister something Dynamic when the word strikes us that we are like that's the truth did we have to process it in the brain I can guarantee every one of you when you've heard the word at times it was so real to you before you gave it thought you said amen yes because it struck in the soul not in the mind to be processed run across your neurons digested put in place restructured and determined that'll be good enough no sir there was something in the soul and it was a soul that responded not the flesh oh my brother and sister God help us amen oh Hallelujah see the tree doesn't want to live in the middle of the street a tree wants to be planted by rivers of Living Water that's where the real desire amen what is it wouldn't live very long that's right when the Deep calleth to the deep it takes more than joining the church the shaking of hands living a good straight life it takes something to satisfy the inside of you Pours Down I want to just make emphasis as you say you already read that brother Paul I want you to make it it takes something that poured down from God to satisfy this soul the Deep falling to the Deep at the noise of that water spout amen sister Ruth if you were to come Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen Hallelujah don't let Satan fool your Saints amen oh we get to enjoy the things in this flesh we get to enjoy life we get to you might say sure the Thrills of what life is [Music] but none of that will matter [Music] if the soul dies of starvation if the soul is weak the soul is dehydrated from the spirit of God all of this stuff here won't matter but when the soul has stood kind of a take from the word here under the water spout or the Fountain of God and just the waters the precious word of God the spirit of God falling on that person I don't say this lightly Saints but the wheels can fall off the car and you'll stop and say thank you Lord you've got something greater for me life can be difficult and you'll say Lord if this is the path you've called for me I'll walk in not in a cloud of depression not under not under this or under that I'm going to go beyond that I'm going to quit looking at my flesh could could maybe tonight I don't know is this not to pressure you but maybe it wouldn't hurt just to lift a hand and say you know what I'm not going to walk in this flesh I'm going to walk in the spirit of God I'm going to walk in his presence and and when my times and the clouds come I'm going to be reminded that I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God whether the sun is shining or not whether I have a job or not or whether their sickness has come my way or not I'm walking in the presence of almighty God not in my flesh the word has come has the word come my brother and sister then we are here in the presence of almighty God because he is his word and we are walking in the word don't let the flesh cause you to pull back from that whatever the time is I understand life is hard sometimes understand that I think this a little bit why the Lord laid this on my heart because sometimes you'll just stop and say Lord I'm about ready to throw my hands up the Lord says here read this read this you're in Warfare buddy and you're getting weary in the Warfare and I've already warned you don't do that come to the fountain refresh yourself get in let the spirit of God flow around you put the flesh it's hard isn't it can we admit that it's really hard to put the flesh to the side but I tell you if we're going to move Beyond the Veil we're going to have to take this Flash and we're gonna have to put it to the side and say let the spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me brother Jason come let's sing that song amen let's just Worship the Lord for a minute don't want to hold you much longer let the spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me Hallelujah did you ever hear that phrase like Peas on a dry cowhide Carnival Back Country down south phrase it's when people get so hardened In the Flesh and the spirit nothing touches them presence of God comes just bounces off moves away don't let that happen Saints let's just stand Worship the Lord for just a song or two [Music] oh fresh [Music] on me yeah is it not on the screen it is it is amen let's just start from the top again [Music] [Music] break me LD me more [Music] for all fresh on me oh spirit [Music] of the lingard [Music] oh fresh on me spirit [Music] Living God [Music] oh fresh on me or just share to the Lord now oh Break Me Lord man me more me tell me [Music] all fresh on me Hallelujah aren't you glad tonight you can say greater is he that is in you than he is in the world Amen let's sing that Let It Be Your Heart confession to your lord Jesus tonight you're giving him that position of preeminence that highest place of authority and in that position then he directs our life my brother and sister he can see Far Beyond the Horizon he can see the things coming before us he can see the things as it were coming down to us and he can say I'm going to turn my son I'm going to turn my daughter here I'm going to pause them right the scripture tells us to wait on the Lord oftentimes it's not a matter of turning us to the right and the left he's telling us just wait right where you're at wait right where you're at just let the presence of God be around you just wait right where you're at I don't know about you sometimes it's hard to wait I want something to happen and I'd like it to happen 10 minutes ago but sometimes the Lord just like to stop him wait on you I'll take care of everything in front of you Hallelujah Satan like a roaring lion from seeking whom he may devour the Bible tells me so many prayers but God has given us today is overcoming pounds oh greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world on the day of panic cause of rushing Mighty wind blew into the Opera and and baptized all of them with our power greater than any Earthly fall I'm so glad I got it too I'm gonna let the whole world know oh greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me then he that is in the word Satan like a roaring line roaming to and from seeking her any vow the Bible tells me so many Souls have been his prey to fall in some we got but God has given us today is overcoming powered oh greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me then he that is in the world [Music] the fellowship this Sunday now the one part of it we can
