[33:25] name amen
[33:28] amen I love
[33:31] him amen we have a number of prayer
[33:34] requests this morning I wanted to just
[33:37] share something I read recently with you
[33:39] this morning before we go to
[33:45] prayer it's from um deep call to the
[33:48] Deep 53
[33:50] 1104 says many in here believe in Divine
[33:53] Healing let's see your hand well that's
[33:56] very proof there's a fountain open
[34:00] somewhere the Deep calling to the deep
[34:02] and God tonight I've believed it all my
[34:09] life I believed it All My Life by God's
[34:12] grace he's helped me to confirm it and
[34:14] tonight I'm still searching
[34:17] wires pay attention to what he says here
[34:20] I found two wires that'll bring the
[34:21] visible power of God for Divine Healing
[34:24] into the
[34:25] individual he says that's two things I
[34:28] find one of them is love and the other
[34:31] is Faith and they're
[34:33] sweethearts and when God and when love
[34:36] gets married to Faith love always
[34:38] accompanies faith when you love God
[34:40] enough to know that he can't lie to you
[34:42] and I'm going to add in here he can't
[34:43] fail
[34:44] you when he says you love God enough to
[34:47] know that he can't lie to you it'll
[34:48] create faith in there that'll make you
[34:50] believe his word and every word he has
[34:53] said is positive
[34:55] truth and you accept it with an
[34:58] unadulterated faith and won't say no
[35:00] it'll produce just exactly what he said
[35:03] he would do the Deep calling to the Deep
[35:06] forget not all his benefits who
[35:09] forgiveth all thine iniquities and
[35:10] health all thy disease
[35:13] amen do you love him this morning do you
[35:16] believe him this
[35:17] morning when we quit
[35:20] looking at what we understand and what
[35:22] we see and we put the we put the word of

[48:25] fault amen you got to love it anyway
[48:28] brother Alex forgot to post a deal of

[49:02] and U I I I think it's wonderful I um my
[49:08] I'll get sidetracked here but I've known
[49:10] sister Rachel since when she was a
[49:13] little girl and then a gap of time and
[49:15] she's grown into a wonderful wonderful
[49:18] young lady uh daughter of God and Alex
[49:21] uh since brother Alex since moving out
[49:24] here few years ago uh you know is just
[49:28] uh uh proven over and over again in
[49:31] conversation and word and deed that uh
[49:34] he loves the Lord and uh it's just a
[49:37] beautiful thing to see them coming
[49:39] together and uh so wonderful amen once
[49:44] again you're all invited amen uh I just
[49:48] want you to know that sister Jerry and I
[49:51] will be gone I I put it this way in kind
[49:54] of humor but um I I've owed a couple
[49:59] Brothers uh uh visits to their church
[50:03] for a long time and uh so November 6th
[50:08] sister Jerry and I are are flying into
[50:10] Canada we'll have two different sets of
[50:12] meetings in Saskatoon Saskatchewan in
[50:14] Edmonton Alberta and uh we'll be home
[50:17] about the 19th so uh just trying to pay
[50:21] some debts and these debts come up
[50:23] before me because I tried to get both of
[50:25] these brothers to come
[50:27] and preach for us and they refused and
[50:29] said no you owe us we don't owe you and
[50:34] uh so um I'm trying to pay that debt so
[50:37] that then we can get them to come and
[50:39] Minister for us so in case you wonder
[50:42] what those are those are brother Dwayne
[50:43] fair and um brother Eugene Brawn so uh
[50:49] just really want to pay the debts so we
[50:50] can receive the blessings amen I also
[50:53] want to um I don't know there was a
[50:55] little complic ations about sending some
[50:58] of it but um just want you to know that
[51:01] you as a church have committed $5,000
[51:04] part of it's already gone so would be
[51:06] already in work and they put some kind
[51:08] of limitation on the sending so uh not
[51:12] all of it I don't know if it is all sent
[51:14] or not so uh to uh Word of Life brother
[51:19] Donnie Reagan's church has become a very
[51:21] focal point uh with many of the churches
[51:24] in that area actually send their
[51:27] contributions to the relief to to
[51:30] brother Donnie there's Brothers there
[51:31] that have just stepped to the Forefront
[51:34] uh and uh putting a a full effort into
[51:38] this work and uh uh brother Dar award
[51:42] being one of the key elements of that
[51:45] just going
[51:46] tirelessly uh to to support the people
[51:50] and uh if you have had the opportunity
[51:52] to see any of the video clip of uh them
[51:56] uh with with families with
[51:58] individuals uh you'll see the
[52:01] the evidence of the appreciation of what
[52:04] they're doing uh grown men you know us
[52:07] men we're Macho we don't cry in public
[52:09] right uh but see grown men break down
[52:12] and cry see families that um literally
[52:15] were to their last bit of food water Etc
[52:19] and many times they've had to Resort uh
[52:23] to uh actually carrying you know waiting
[52:26] through the stream because bridges are
[52:28] gone and doing this and so uh we sent um
[52:33] uh an offering or in the process of
[52:36] $5,000 uh to support that so uh I know
[52:40] that um as it is you're giving to this
[52:43] assembly that God will give blessings
[52:46] back to you for this labors amen uh and
[52:51] then we have on the left hand side of
[52:54] the church let's see one two two three
[52:57] rows up someone that um has been missing
[53:02] from our ranks and we've been missing
[53:05] her let's give a welcome home to Sister
[53:08] Sophie
[53:09] [Applause]
[53:14] amen amen we love you and appreciate you
[53:17] sister Sophie let's turn in our Bibles I
[53:20] want to preach to you this morning and
[53:22] as I told Brother Isaac in the back room
[53:25] thank you musicians appreciate the music
[53:28] uh in the back room I I pray this comes
[53:30] out there was so many ways that seem
[53:32] like the branches to this thought and
[53:35] and uh I've strugg struggled for several
[53:37] days now of what way to go and so in my
[53:40] Meandering please um uh hold on tight so
[53:44] we we don't lose you in our thought 1
[53:47] Timothy 4 1-7 I want to speak to you on
[53:51] a title of a change in our
[53:54] thinking and uh my brother brother and
[53:56] sister this is not I want to clarify
[53:59] right off the bat this is not a change
[54:01] in the word this is not a change or or a
[54:04] new uh Revelation or a new uh uh uh you
[54:08] know thought it's not about God's
[54:11] thought it's about our thinking and so
[54:14] we we appreciate the fact that God is so
[54:16] patient and so kind uh can you agree
[54:19] with that that God is patient and kind
[54:21] and and when our thinking and our
[54:23] thoughts have moved away from or
[54:25] meandered away from what God is thinking
[54:28] he is so wonderful to come as a guide
[54:32] would and and gather us up and say you
[54:36] know there's a branch in the trail here
[54:37] and it seems as though you were going a
[54:39] certain direction and I would like you
[54:41] to go this direction and and God is
[54:44] faithful I remember many years ago in
[54:46] Chile at a youth uh camp that uh they
[54:49] had a big hike and and uh it it uh is
[54:53] actually got a little humor to Sister
[54:55] Jerry and I because um uh there was many
[54:58] sisters older sisters definitely uh not
[55:02] in good shape to go hiking in the
[55:04] mountains and then all the young people
[55:06] left bag after bag full of water bottles
[55:09] and food and this and that for these
[55:11] sisters to
[55:13] carry and uh so sister Jerry and I was
[55:16] like you know some of these sisters
[55:17] aren't going to make it and we want them
[55:20] to make it and the only way we're going
[55:22] to help them to make it I hope you catch
[55:24] the spiritual context here is to lighten
[55:27] their load now the prophet of God told
[55:29] us that we lighten the load of our
[55:31] brother and sister by lifting them up
[55:33] before the
[55:36] throne and we want you to make
[55:38] it so we don't call it obligation we
[55:42] call it
[55:43] opportunity and so we're there and
[55:45] sister Jerry and I we hung back with
[55:48] these older sisters few older brothers I
[55:52] remember one old sister there and when I
[55:54] say old I'm I'm guessing probably coming
[55:57] close to 70 years old and uh she went on
[56:01] a hike in flipflops now I know some of
[56:04] you teenagers would do that but you
[56:06] shouldn't do that when you're older and
[56:09] uh so as we're going along this one
[56:12] sister would make it about a 100 yards
[56:14] sit down 100 yards sit down and uh
[56:18] finally we just started collecting up
[56:20] their stuff and and took their burden
[56:23] and started carrying it and you know
[56:24] when you've got a whole bunch of bags
[56:26] full of water bottles it actually it
[56:29] becomes a
[56:30] burden but we had this is my humorous
[56:35] moment a brother come back down the
[56:37] trail and he said brother Paul is are
[56:39] you and sister Jerry all right now here
[56:41] are sisters we've now collected up about
[56:43] eight
[56:44] sisters that are are just walking a
[56:46] little ways and resting and and uh the
[56:49] brother comes brother
[56:50] Paul are you and sister Jerry okay and
[56:54] we're like yes we're fine and then one
[56:57] of the brothers had a radio and it
[56:59] crackled it was a pastor you guys get
[57:01] down there now and make sure that
[57:03] brother Paul and sister Jerry are are
[57:05] not overburdened here and not whatever
[57:07] you know about making the TR The Climb
[57:09] it's Steep and we we don't want them
[57:13] to yeah check on brother Paul and sister
[57:16] Jerry here you're a deacon right yes sir
[57:19] take
[57:21] it and and that's you know how we as the
[57:24] body of Believers need to be we need to
[57:27] come and say I care about your burden
[57:29] and I I want you to make it I don't want
[57:31] you to be uh uh worn out and and uh you
[57:35] know not not be able to press to the
[57:37] mark of the High Calling 1 Timothy
[57:41] 41-7 now the spirit speaketh expressly
[57:44] that in the latter time some shall
[57:46] depart from the faith giving heeds to
[57:49] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[57:52] speaking lies and hypocrisy having their
[57:55] conscience Sears with a hot iron
[57:58] forbidding to marry commanding to
[58:00] abstain from Meats which God hath
[58:02] created to be received with Thanksgiving
[58:05] of them which believe and know the truth
[58:07] and this scripture right there verse
[58:09] three is why I do not promote being a
[58:15] vegetarian it's right there in the word
[58:18] what can I
[58:23] say for every creature of God is good
[58:25] and nothing to be refused if it be
[58:28] received with Thanksgiving for it is
[58:30] Sanctified by the word of God and prayer
[58:33] if thou put brethren in remembrance of
[58:36] these things Thou shalt be a good
[58:37] minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in
[58:40] words of faith and of good Doctrine
[58:42] whereinto thou Hast attained but refuse
[58:46] profane and old wives fables and
[58:49] exercise thyself rather into godliness
[58:53] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[58:54] word lead us guide us strengthen us
[58:56] today I pray in the name of Jesus Christ
[58:59] amen you may be
[59:11] seated I want to revisit this just a
[59:14] moment just to kind of interject a
[59:17] little bit of thought now I'm not saying
[59:21] that these are absolutes but just
[59:23] thoughts that as we're studying and
[59:25] praying over these things that have come
[59:27] and we see in verse one in the latter
[59:30] time some shall depart from the faith
[59:32] and my brother and sister not every one
[59:34] of these that departs from the faith is
[59:36] someone who goes off into some kind of
[59:38] Doctrine and and says that's false and I
[59:41] won't have anything to do with it
[59:43] sometimes the doctrine of Satan is just
[59:46] simply to bring people to a place you
[59:49] might say of extreme spiritual fatigue
[59:52] they come to a place that they look at
[59:55] that and they start to question does God
[59:57] really care and and their prayers that
[59:59] they pray sometimes seem as though
[1:00:01] there's no answer and it's in that realm
[1:00:04] right there that they start to look at
[1:00:06] that and as Satan is Whispering to them
[1:00:08] they come to a place that they realize
[1:00:11] that that they just don't have the faith
[1:00:13] to take a Holtz of the word like they
[1:00:15] should and in that it starts to work
[1:00:18] upon them and they give up but my
[1:00:21] brother and sister I would say today it
[1:00:24] takes more faith to believe Satan lies
[1:00:27] than it does to believe the word of God
[1:00:30] an entirely different Faith but still it
[1:00:33] takes more faith to believe that there
[1:00:35] was a man I I'm sorry I don't remember
[1:00:37] his name to to give proper credit to his
[1:00:40] quotation but he said you know it takes
[1:00:43] more faith to believe in The Big Bang
[1:00:47] Theory than it takes to believe in God
[1:00:50] the
[1:00:51] Creator amen cuz why haven't we had in
[1:00:55] the pot holes on the Prairies whether it
[1:00:57] be in the dtas into Canada why have we
[1:01:00] not had another spark on methane gas of
[1:01:03] rotting Cales that creates a whole
[1:01:05] nether creation coming forth my brother
[1:01:08] and sister it'll never happen they can't
[1:01:10] make it happen because it never happened
[1:01:13] in the beginning and so Satan comes and
[1:01:16] will give even the most ridiculous
[1:01:19] explanations of how things came to be
[1:01:22] and there are those that believe it but
[1:01:26] no son or daughter of God could ever
[1:01:28] believe that it was that amen we serve a
[1:01:31] God who said I'm going to make you
[1:01:34] unique amen I'm going to create you in
[1:01:37] the very image now my brother and sister
[1:01:40] sometimes you get a lot of young ladies
[1:01:42] together I I think as young men we kind
[1:01:45] of tend uh uh you know to to accept the
[1:01:49] fact that we just look like we look I
[1:01:51] mean this is who I am but you get young
[1:01:53] ladies together and and if they're not
[1:01:55] car ful they they get into that whole
[1:01:57] Spirit of comparison and they are saying
[1:02:00] well you know um she's a little prettier
[1:02:03] than I am she's this or she's got more
[1:02:06] beautiful hair or or whatever it is a
[1:02:08] little more uh fashion sense and dresses
[1:02:11] so good my brother and sister H that is
[1:02:14] a lie of the devil because sisters if
[1:02:17] God wanted you to look like six so and
[1:02:19] so they would all look the same but God
[1:02:21] didn't he said I've got a bouquet here
[1:02:23] and I created you to be you and I've
[1:02:26] made it for you in your body natural to
[1:02:30] become who you're supposed to be in your
[1:02:32] body spiritual amen it's not about the
[1:02:35] flesh my goodness I hope this don't
[1:02:37] sound too crass but at the funeral for
[1:02:39] brother Bob I'm looking at that one
[1:02:41] picture and and uh Brother David I I
[1:02:44] hope this doesn't sound weird but I'm
[1:02:46] looking at that one picture and I
[1:02:48] thought sister Joanne was absolutely
[1:02:51] beautiful in the prime of her life she
[1:02:54] was just a beautiful woman woman a
[1:02:56] beautiful sister amen I'm looking at
[1:02:58] that but you know my brother and sister
[1:03:01] we would hold on to that to the best of
[1:03:04] our ability When God says I want you to
[1:03:06] age gracefully in my word amen it's not
[1:03:10] about trying to stay some young thing
[1:03:12] and do the Botox and to do the this and
[1:03:16] dress like a child amen I tell you what
[1:03:19] now forgive me for saying it this
[1:03:20] strongly but I'll just get it out there
[1:03:22] there's nothing more disgusting than a
[1:03:24] mother trying to look like her daughter
[1:03:27] that's right
[1:03:29] amen you know when they start dressing
[1:03:32] acting walking talking be bopping like
[1:03:34] them amen there's something wrong amen
[1:03:37] God created us to age gracefully and the
[1:03:40] only true way to age gracefully is in
[1:03:42] the word of God Amen so we'll see this
[1:03:46] you know see what happens my brother and
[1:03:48] sisters sometimes the conscience being
[1:03:50] seared is simply the rejection of the
[1:03:53] word that they know is there they can't
[1:03:56] bring themselves to live what they know
[1:03:59] amen we could also call that iniquity
[1:04:03] but my brother and sister iniquity has a
[1:04:05] context that one knows it's
[1:04:09] right and let me put it my way doesn't
[1:04:12] have the
[1:04:15] willpower but when you come to a place
[1:04:19] that you will not receive the word
[1:04:22] that's
[1:04:23] right you end up with a conscience
[1:04:32] seared let me skip down to the verses
[1:04:34] that I really wanted to pull out of this
[1:04:36] context today if thou put the brethren
[1:04:38] in Remembering these things this is to
[1:04:40] you preachers here you put them in
[1:04:43] remembrance of these things Thou shalt
[1:04:44] be a good minister of Jesus Christ you
[1:04:46] see it's not how we articulate our words
[1:04:49] or whether we have dark wavy hair uh oh
[1:04:52] I'm sorry brother Chris I didn't mean
[1:04:53] that pointed at you uh
[1:04:56] you know you know brother Brown talks
[1:04:58] about that they choose the preacher that
[1:04:59] was just so so
[1:05:02] refined see none of that my brother and
[1:05:04] sister is what makes them a good
[1:05:06] Minister it's getting in the word
[1:05:09] studying the word eating the book and
[1:05:12] bringing the book to the people that the
[1:05:14] people would then have the same
[1:05:16] opportunity to have the same blessings
[1:05:18] and same Revelation coming from the word
[1:05:21] amen so to come and be uh in remembrance
[1:05:25] make us a good minister of Jesus Christ
[1:05:28] nourished up in the words of faith and
[1:05:30] good Doctrine where thou Hast attained
[1:05:33] but refuse now this scripture I I
[1:05:35] preached on this I won't name the church
[1:05:38] I preached on this quite a few years ago
[1:05:40] and I I I preached a sermon on old wives
[1:05:43] tales
[1:05:45] fables and um there was a lot of things
[1:05:48] going on in the message at that time and
[1:05:51] next thing I knew there was a rumor that
[1:05:52] I was quitting because I had called the
[1:05:55] mess message a
[1:05:57] fable but they totally missed the point
[1:06:00] my brother and
[1:06:01] sister if we're looking
[1:06:05] back bear with
[1:06:07] me look at this meeting here people
[1:06:12] healed people delivered look back at
[1:06:14] that look back here and no present tense
[1:06:18] expression of the Holy Spirit moving
[1:06:20] today you've turned that into a
[1:06:23] fable it's a story CU talking about that
[1:06:26] won't bring that to pass but that same
[1:06:30] God that was in those meetings in those
[1:06:32] days in us will produce exactly the same
[1:06:36] word which means you and I would be able
[1:06:38] to stand according to the word and say I
[1:06:42] am a son I am a daughter of God I count
[1:06:46] myself and am counted as a saint amen
[1:06:50] present tense word alive in the people
[1:06:54] today now now my brother and sister we
[1:06:56] all do it we look back on Good Times I
[1:06:59] just recounted a time on a mountain amen
[1:07:02] what was the name of that
[1:07:06] mountain eagle something I believe it
[1:07:08] was Eagle's View you could stand on the
[1:07:11] peak of that mountain which isn't really
[1:07:13] a mountain in our terms but and at that
[1:07:15] point on clear days you could see the
[1:07:18] Pacific and you could see the Atlantic
[1:07:21] so actually it was a pretty big mountain
[1:07:26] and it was eagles's view I believe is
[1:07:28] what they called that incredible place I
[1:07:31] can relive that my brother and sister I
[1:07:33] can relive of the young people that were
[1:07:35] in absolute utter rebellion and their
[1:07:38] parents not knowing what to do and when
[1:07:40] they go to correct their children their
[1:07:42] children would wave a finger in their
[1:07:44] face and say you touch me and I'll turn
[1:07:46] you into
[1:07:49] authorities and have parents come as
[1:07:51] we're going into that camp and say
[1:07:53] please pray for our son
[1:07:56] another family please pray for our
[1:07:58] daughter my brother and sister I tell
[1:08:01] you what if we are not living in the
[1:08:03] right place we will have a feeling I
[1:08:05] cannot do anything about this situation
[1:08:09] but when we're in the word like we're
[1:08:11] supposed to be in the word and we're
[1:08:13] believing and we're confessing the word
[1:08:15] we can look that brother and sister
[1:08:17] those families in the face and say God's
[1:08:19] going to do something God's going to
[1:08:22] change this situation and to see a
[1:08:25] Harden young man already bitterness
[1:08:27] etching him and to see him in an altar
[1:08:30] breaking down crying out to God to see a
[1:08:33] pastor's granddaughter who has already
[1:08:36] come to the place I'll dress like I want
[1:08:38] I think she was 15 years old I'll dress
[1:08:41] like I want I'll hang out with who I
[1:08:43] want to I'll listen to the music I want
[1:08:46] to and you can't do one thing about it
[1:08:50] and see that little girl in an altar
[1:08:52] crying out to God a life completely
[1:08:56] changed
[1:08:58] enough that it totally changed her whole
[1:09:00] friendship structure in
[1:09:03] school in the
[1:09:06] neighborhood my that's
[1:09:09] incredible but you see we won't do that
[1:09:12] by looking
[1:09:13] back we'll do that by looking in the
[1:09:16] word that's opened right here today the
[1:09:18] word that's alive in our presence today
[1:09:21] amen that has promised us a future but
[1:09:23] we can't just look to the Future
[1:09:32] you
[1:09:33] see we want to be good Ministers of the
[1:09:36] Gospel sometimes you have to put
[1:09:38] yourself on a limb you got to go where
[1:09:41] you're not comfortable to preach what
[1:09:43] God calls you to
[1:09:46] preach
[1:09:47] yeah I don't imagine that Elijah was so
[1:09:51] comfortable telling Ahab he had a devil
[1:09:54] on him
[1:09:56] but he did it
[1:09:59] anyhow
[1:10:02] now exercise thyself ra rather into
[1:10:07] godliness now my online dictionary
[1:10:11] doesn't really list the word godliness
[1:10:12] as a direct or complete word it takes
[1:10:16] Godly and adds to it and other forms as
[1:10:19] it says and godliness is a noun now I
[1:10:23] don't know one way or another about that
[1:10:25] my brother and sister because that part
[1:10:27] of English is kind of like saying I need
[1:10:30] to identify every piece of wood in my
[1:10:34] house I know them as studs and rafters
[1:10:38] and floor joist and
[1:10:40] trusses not whether it's himl white pine
[1:10:43] yellow pine
[1:10:45] Tamarac all I care about it's a board
[1:10:48] and it
[1:10:50] fits but see we get so caught up and I
[1:10:53] hope this doesn't offend anyone today we
[1:10:55] get so caught up in living the message
[1:10:58] that sometimes knowing this and knowing
[1:11:00] that do you believe this oh what group
[1:11:02] do you hang out with where's your pastor
[1:11:04] what's your affiliation do you believe
[1:11:06] the seals are open or not we get so
[1:11:08] caught up in all of this stuff that
[1:11:10] there's very little emphasis placed on
[1:11:13] godliness that's
[1:11:16] right it doesn't say become the
[1:11:19] consumate message
[1:11:23] politician to have some kind of social
[1:11:26] presence to be recognized have authority
[1:11:31] you have authority when you preach the
[1:11:32] word of God that's what the scripture
[1:11:34] says amen so it's there believing in God
[1:11:39] the importance of having a moral life
[1:11:41] well that's good I shared with you the
[1:11:44] other day my farmer friend he believes
[1:11:46] in
[1:11:47] God and married to the same woman I
[1:11:50] think about 40
[1:11:52] years I can assure you that but my
[1:11:55] friend Paul is a moral
[1:11:57] man does he know Jesus
[1:12:01] Christ that's what
[1:12:06] matters now listen to this full
[1:12:09] definition is
[1:12:10] divine Pious
[1:12:13] devout I want to ask you does that
[1:12:17] really make you
[1:12:19] Godly you see this was man's
[1:12:23] understanding that I hope you catch this
[1:12:25] here this was man's understanding of
[1:12:29] what being Godly was but I'm here I'm
[1:12:32] going to get a little ahead of myself
[1:12:34] sorry but I want to get it in context
[1:12:36] amen that's their idea of what being
[1:12:38] Godly is but my brother and sister God
[1:12:40] came along and changed our thinking
[1:12:44] changed it from uh just being Pious you
[1:12:47] know to being faithful in church or
[1:12:49] being a part of this God said no it's
[1:12:52] more than that there's something deeper
[1:12:55] and he changed our thinking and we sit
[1:12:57] here today and have starting to have let
[1:13:00] me put it that way we're starting to
[1:13:01] have an understanding of what godliness
[1:13:04] is my brother and sister to be like
[1:13:07] Jesus amen not a song out here what
[1:13:10] would and whatever they had about be
[1:13:12] like Jesus my brother and sister the
[1:13:14] real thing amen the one you don't have
[1:13:16] to quote in public the one you don't
[1:13:18] have to tell them you're a Christian
[1:13:20] that your life speaks so loud that they
[1:13:23] look at you and know you're a different
[1:13:25] individual they know you're a different
[1:13:27] nature and come from a different father
[1:13:31] doesn't mean they'll like it but they'll
[1:13:33] recognize it amen
[1:13:37] hallelujah what we want to do is
[1:13:40] Christians is focus on the right things
[1:13:43] amen there'll be no
[1:13:45] plaques I'm sorry to tell you the grace
[1:13:48] Tabernacle they'll be no plaques of your
[1:13:50] years of faithful
[1:13:53] attendance that has nothing to do with
[1:13:56] it maybe for work or school or whatever
[1:13:59] it might be vacation family time
[1:14:01] whatever it is that you miss church your
[1:14:03] salvation amen your godliness did not
[1:14:07] decline it's not so wishy-washy and
[1:14:11] temporal that it's like a graph of like
[1:14:13] you don't you guys love it you go out
[1:14:16] buy something with your credit
[1:14:18] card and well this is at least the way
[1:14:20] our credit card company is our credit
[1:14:23] score goes was up and down so
[1:14:26] fast can't hardly even keep track of
[1:14:31] it Capital One send you a deal your your
[1:14:34] credit score today creditwise
[1:14:37] today well actually I'm quite upset
[1:14:39] because sister
[1:14:41] Jerry has way better credit than I
[1:14:44] do but she's spending the money that
[1:14:47] holds my credit
[1:14:52] down such nonsense there's no such thing
[1:14:54] for for the
[1:14:56] Christian went on vacation wasn't at
[1:14:59] church for 2
[1:15:03] weeks with a suggestion on how you can
[1:15:06] build it back
[1:15:09] up come
[1:15:11] on see how the thinking of man has crept
[1:15:16] into the the the scripture crept into a
[1:15:19] spiritual life and so it's there my
[1:15:22] brother and sister let's focus on the
[1:15:23] right things the focus is not perfect
[1:15:26] attendance at church the focus is not
[1:15:29] how many scriptures you can quote the
[1:15:31] focus is not how many quotes you can
[1:15:34] quote it's not who you
[1:15:37] know cuz come on we're all doing pretty
[1:15:39] good we know brother
[1:15:42] George has not one thing to do with our
[1:15:46] Salvation not one thing of overcoming
[1:15:48] power in our life my brother and sister
[1:15:51] has nothing to do with that the only
[1:15:53] thing that matters is do we know Jesus
[1:15:56] Christ and when we know Jesus Christ he
[1:15:59] comes along and he will keep us to the
[1:16:02] place of what I would describe to you
[1:16:04] earlier as spiritual
[1:16:06] fatigue that's the place where job got
[1:16:09] and he didn't know if God really cared
[1:16:12] God help us cry out for help to the Lord
[1:16:15] before you let yourself come to a place
[1:16:17] that you don't know if God cares or not
[1:16:20] that's nothing but a lie from the devil
[1:16:22] trying to keep you from coming to
[1:16:26] Victory amen and victory is not a goal
[1:16:28] it's a life that's
[1:16:31] right now it might seem odd to pull this
[1:16:34] thought from these
[1:16:36] scriptures but if you'll bear with me I
[1:16:38] hope it'll make sense to you
[1:16:40] today in all my Years Around the message
[1:16:44] from just a
[1:16:46] child it's really
[1:16:48] interesting I've heard the same
[1:16:51] quotes used to defend opposing
[1:16:57] ideas now those quotes my brother and
[1:16:59] sister are
[1:17:01] right for one you might say and wrong
[1:17:04] for the
[1:17:06] other maybe it's wrong for
[1:17:12] both maybe even a remote possibility
[1:17:15] it's right for
[1:17:18] both but you see what happens these
[1:17:21] things that uh the prophet spoke and
[1:17:25] they're preached and they affect your
[1:17:27] understanding this is why we're not
[1:17:28] supposed to deviate from the word of God
[1:17:31] what's preached and what you hear
[1:17:33] affects your understanding and when
[1:17:35] something is preached to an extent that
[1:17:39] it is ingrained in you right that's what
[1:17:41] they do they start you off in
[1:17:43] kindergarten with two little rubber
[1:17:45] ducks and they're teaching you math and
[1:17:47] you have one rubber duck plus one little
[1:17:49] rubber duck and it starts working that
[1:17:51] way and it builds right up until we get
[1:17:54] all the stuff that those of you are
[1:17:55] smart enough to understand it to they I
[1:17:58] don't know is there something Beyond
[1:17:59] trigonometry or whatever that stuff is
[1:18:02] amen you know I I use that stuff every
[1:18:10] day yeah every
[1:18:13] day I might not know I'm using it and I
[1:18:17] know why I'm using it but I am using it
[1:18:21] you know that's kind of like the word of
[1:18:23] God in our life there's not every
[1:18:24] reation of the scripture that you
[1:18:26] understand there's not everything that's
[1:18:28] there that you can just say praise God I
[1:18:31] know what was happening right there but
[1:18:33] something in you because you are a
[1:18:35] Christian and the word has come to you
[1:18:38] you are living it the Devil comes and
[1:18:41] you don't have to stop and search out a
[1:18:43] scripture the Devil comes to bother you
[1:18:45] and you just speak it amen you don't
[1:18:48] know where the power come from well you
[1:18:50] do actually but not in the overall
[1:18:52] context right you in the overall context
[1:18:54] you know but not in the specific but you
[1:18:57] know that when you pray in jesus' name
[1:19:00] things
[1:19:01] change amen that's trigonometry in the
[1:19:04] spiritual world you might not explain
[1:19:07] every one of those little things but you
[1:19:10] know that when you approach God in the
[1:19:13] right fashion things
[1:19:21] change and many times let's face it
[1:19:24] doesn't matter brother Chris Brother
[1:19:25] David
[1:19:27] myself you preach things at the level of
[1:19:30] your
[1:19:33] understanding
[1:19:36] so one brother might preach on
[1:19:39] faith and literally by God's grace he
[1:19:43] has Faith lay hands on people and
[1:19:44] they're
[1:19:46] healed another brother preaches on faith
[1:19:50] and don't misunderstand I'm not
[1:19:51] demeaning this he is preaching in the
[1:19:55] realm of building to a faith that
[1:19:59] they're called to come
[1:20:01] to are you with me do you understand
[1:20:05] that so there's these levels that are
[1:20:07] there and that might even Define the
[1:20:10] very life of the minister that's
[1:20:12] preaching it I tell you this in humor
[1:20:15] brother juel if you ever listen to
[1:20:18] this but there was a a a a sister had
[1:20:21] come up for prayer now my brothers and
[1:20:24] sister ISS we need to recognize if
[1:20:26] people speak things and say it's thus
[1:20:28] sayith the Lord it better
[1:20:30] happen this is not a dartboard guessing
[1:20:33] game it better happen and I'm not
[1:20:36] touting brother juel I just know for the
[1:20:38] fact uh of these circumstances this
[1:20:40] sister coming to prayer line brother
[1:20:42] juwel was there under the anointing he
[1:20:44] said the words just burst forth out of
[1:20:46] him a year from now Sister you will have
[1:20:48] a baby
[1:20:50] boy and one year later she has a baby
[1:20:54] boy
[1:20:56] and then a little time went and she
[1:20:58] desired to have another child and could
[1:21:00] not and she come back for prayer and and
[1:21:03] brother juel laid hands on her praying
[1:21:05] in some meetings they specifically come
[1:21:07] to where he was at he laid hands on it
[1:21:10] and a year later that sister had another
[1:21:12] baby was it three children sister Jerry
[1:21:14] do you remember anyway at one point in
[1:21:17] time uh the sister comes up and talking
[1:21:20] to brother juwel and her husband comes
[1:21:22] and puts himself almost in the way and
[1:21:24] says don't you talk to my
[1:21:29] wife my brother
[1:21:32] sister sometimes God is just placing a
[1:21:35] man a vessel a
[1:21:39] tool in the right
[1:21:41] place let me tell you the rest of this
[1:21:44] story because it is funny then brother
[1:21:46] juel says sister Jerry come here let me
[1:21:49] lay hands on
[1:21:51] you brother juwel get away from her
[1:21:54] we are too old to be having
[1:21:57] children but look at this my brother and
[1:21:59] sister but there'll be another man that
[1:22:01] will approach the same situation and say
[1:22:04] sister we're going to be in prayer for
[1:22:06] you every single day till God gives you
[1:22:11] a
[1:22:13] child whole different
[1:22:16] approach same God
[1:22:25] so sometimes you know ministers preach
[1:22:27] what they understand they preach at the
[1:22:29] level and you know sometimes things are
[1:22:31] preached that aren't just really totally
[1:22:33] lined up you might say with the word and
[1:22:37] it's not
[1:22:38] intentional these are not deceivers
[1:22:40] these are not men who are coming as
[1:22:42] ravening wolves these are men that are
[1:22:44] preaching what's been preached to
[1:22:47] them and when what was preached to them
[1:22:50] didn't quite line up with the word it
[1:22:52] doesn't immediately God doesn't come and
[1:22:54] just let a bolt of lightning and and
[1:22:56] that's false and do sometimes he allows
[1:22:59] that to go for a season because he's
[1:23:02] actually training us and bringing us to
[1:23:04] a place my brother and sister that we
[1:23:07] can come and understand that God has
[1:23:09] more now I just want to ask you a
[1:23:11] question this morning does God have more
[1:23:13] for us amen so let's not put limitations
[1:23:16] out here like we got all the truth right
[1:23:19] now and and we're just going to do our
[1:23:21] group and those we associate no my
[1:23:22] brother and sister every one of us God
[1:23:25] has more for us and sometimes we don't
[1:23:28] even recognize what the more might be or
[1:23:30] how it might be manifested in our life
[1:23:32] because God is there and he's moving us
[1:23:34] along because you see if God dumped the
[1:23:38] fullness of Jesus Christ in
[1:23:42] us we'd Short Circuit the wires would
[1:23:46] melt and we would be nothing more have
[1:23:49] you guys ever seen copper wire
[1:23:52] explode it's pretty cool science class
[1:23:55] experiments like that if you have a
[1:23:56] radical teacher that locks the
[1:23:58] door you can take copper wire you can
[1:24:02] put it in the right substance helps
[1:24:04] create the atmosphere and you can do
[1:24:07] that literally you can watch copper wire
[1:24:10] vaporize and not even break the
[1:24:14] beaker that is containing the gas of the
[1:24:19] environment pretty
[1:24:21] incredible you look at these things my
[1:24:23] brother and sister if the fullness of
[1:24:25] Christ was dumped in US ah brother
[1:24:28] Vapor's here with us this
[1:24:30] morning because we couldn't handle it
[1:24:33] but you see God is raising us up into
[1:24:38] Heavenly places and there's Seasons that
[1:24:41] we just go along at a
[1:24:43] level and that's because what God has
[1:24:45] next for us we have to be prepared
[1:24:51] for my
[1:25:00] so the teaching places the wrong idea in
[1:25:02] people's minds and they can go for
[1:25:05] years with certain ideas in their minds
[1:25:08] now I'm going to be a little blunt and
[1:25:10] put this out my brother and
[1:25:12] sister but um people can have the
[1:25:15] scripture says Christ in you the hope of
[1:25:17] glory right is that what the scripture
[1:25:19] says yes but then you take the words God
[1:25:22] in you and they can't accept them
[1:25:25] yeah you see that's because someone has
[1:25:29] put a teaching in place that separated
[1:25:32] Christ and God that's right put a
[1:25:35] barrier in the godhead and they're
[1:25:38] looking at that saying no no it's Christ
[1:25:41] in you not God in you now those that
[1:25:44] have Revelation understanding of the
[1:25:45] word would look at that and go Wow Come
[1:25:47] on how'd you miss that but you see
[1:25:50] teaching has placed a barrier for them
[1:25:53] to receive that
[1:25:55] that's real life example that's not
[1:25:57] theoretical preaching right there so uh
[1:26:03] things are preached people understand
[1:26:05] them they hear them and the wrong
[1:26:08] understanding of the word is placed in
[1:26:10] people's
[1:26:12] minds you see we have to be careful my
[1:26:15] brother and sister we didn't we're not
[1:26:17] here on the Earth today to look like a
[1:26:20] Christian that's right we're not here to
[1:26:24] act like a
[1:26:26] Christian but we're here to be a
[1:26:29] Christian we're here to be the
[1:26:32] word and people will say but how can I
[1:26:35] be the word feeble ow me full of
[1:26:37] mistakes I don't know how we can be the
[1:26:39] word my brother and sister but my God
[1:26:41] said you are the word and all that was
[1:26:45] in Christ was poured into the church and
[1:26:47] we sit here today not with a little
[1:26:50] portion but actually a giant portion my
[1:26:53] brother and sister sister but we have to
[1:26:56] understand that God put a limitation as
[1:26:58] it were on what we are or what we will
[1:27:02] be because he knows who we
[1:27:07] are and so as we look at this we
[1:27:11] recognize I actually have the authority
[1:27:14] you know people stumble over
[1:27:16] this to create a
[1:27:18] world and go live on it
[1:27:25] but God knew our
[1:27:27] humanness so he put a limitation on
[1:27:32] that he said that you were a
[1:27:34] supernatural
[1:27:36] being but my brother and sister most of
[1:27:39] the time we get up in the morning and we
[1:27:40] think about yesterday what we said what
[1:27:42] we did and there's nothing Supernatural
[1:27:45] feeling about
[1:27:46] it but what does the word say right the
[1:27:49] word says we're
[1:27:51] Supernatural amen
[1:27:56] but let's understand this all this that
[1:27:58] we would see the feebleness of humanity
[1:28:01] and misunderstandings of the word now
[1:28:04] I'm not doing this for to do but you can
[1:28:07] just do it in your heart but how many of
[1:28:09] us have heard the preaching of the word
[1:28:11] and realized that our thoughts
[1:28:13] concerning certain subjects of scripture
[1:28:16] were just way off
[1:28:18] base so you see the season
[1:28:21] come that God said I'm going to reveal
[1:28:24] this to you he didn't say when they
[1:28:27] reach 40 years of service that's
[1:28:30] right I shared this with the young
[1:28:32] adults
[1:28:34] today for them to be
[1:28:37] examples to us
[1:28:41] Elders don't got to be 25 40 50
[1:28:45] 70 my brother and sister I have seen
[1:28:48] brothers that were quite
[1:28:51] aged smash their fingers
[1:28:55] and
[1:28:57] curse age is not the
[1:29:05] solution and I know a brother lives back
[1:29:09] East he boastfully shares this not
[1:29:12] boastfully that's not boldly boldly
[1:29:14] shares this driving down the highway one
[1:29:17] day and a car something cut him off he's
[1:29:21] getting a little steamed up said his
[1:29:23] little little girl said
[1:29:26] Daddy what sweetie the Holy Ghost
[1:29:29] doesn't act like
[1:29:35] that he said I lost all that steam
[1:29:37] really
[1:29:39] quick out of the mouth of babes that's
[1:29:42] right
[1:29:43] amen see there's got to come A change in
[1:29:46] our thinking my brother and sister
[1:29:47] there's no
[1:29:50] seniority look if it took brother Bob
[1:29:52] till he was a hundred years old to come
[1:29:54] to maturity he would live to be a
[1:29:56] hundred years
[1:29:58] old amen and if his testimony needed to
[1:30:01] be here on the earth and a hundred years
[1:30:03] old he would still be here today but God
[1:30:07] has a time your work is finished you are
[1:30:10] mature in Christ you have come to the
[1:30:13] fullness and just because somebody dies
[1:30:15] in their 40s doesn't mean that you know
[1:30:17] uh they had a greater Revelation than
[1:30:20] someone that takes
[1:30:22] 100 but understand my brother and sister
[1:30:25] but look at this John
[1:30:27] 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of
[1:30:31] Truth is come he will guide you into all
[1:30:34] Truth for he shall not speak of himself
[1:30:37] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:30:39] he speak and he will show you things to
[1:30:43] come my brother and sister this is the
[1:30:46] Holy Spirit the spirit of Truth working
[1:30:48] in you and I coming to a stage that
[1:30:51] every false Doctrine every false idea
[1:30:55] everything Satan's trying to plant in
[1:30:57] your life they'll come a day by the
[1:30:59] moving of the holy spirit that God will
[1:31:02] root that out and correct that put it in
[1:31:05] its correct place and in that will come
[1:31:08] a change of our
[1:31:11] thinking God's word didn't change it's a
[1:31:13] change of our
[1:31:15] thinking amen so you look at this
[1:31:19] understand spiritual insight
[1:31:25] Revelation is a simple word to
[1:31:27] use spiritual Insight my brother and
[1:31:30] sister whether you have a partial
[1:31:34] understanding partial Revelation often
[1:31:37] times a godhead falls into the realm for
[1:31:39] people coming to it of partial
[1:31:41] Revelation they start to understand they
[1:31:43] stumble a little bit because they were
[1:31:45] taught from a
[1:31:47] child Matthew 28:19 is the
[1:31:51] absolute unreplicated in the word
[1:31:55] in their context but it's the
[1:31:58] word acts
[1:32:00] 238 well just like they thought in that
[1:32:03] day these modern-day theologians they
[1:32:06] actually have the same Dee rooted idea
[1:32:09] that those were a bunch of wild people
[1:32:12] that were there that that was nonsense
[1:32:14] that was not the Fulfillment of the word
[1:32:16] even though God replicated it in
[1:32:18] scripture again and again and again so
[1:32:22] partial then we come to full
[1:32:25] understanding full Revelation my brother
[1:32:28] and sister here again this might sound a
[1:32:29] little strange to you I always
[1:32:31] appreciated how brother Donnie put this
[1:32:33] forth he said you know if a brother
[1:32:35] calls up and says you know what I I I
[1:32:37] want to come talk to you I'm getting
[1:32:38] married and my my uh fiance and I would
[1:32:41] like to come talk to you brother Donnie
[1:32:43] and you know the Man shows up at the
[1:32:45] office and walks in with a 12-year-old
[1:32:47] girl brother Donnie says I'm going to
[1:32:49] send the little girl home to her mama
[1:32:51] and him and I are going to have a talk
[1:32:54] you see my brother and sister God's not
[1:32:56] taking a bride that is immature he's not
[1:32:58] going to take a bride that don't have an
[1:33:00] understanding who she is and what she
[1:33:03] has committed herself to so the word has
[1:33:07] to come bring a maturity and in that
[1:33:10] maturity I I bring this point up and and
[1:33:13] I hope this isn't too much for anybody
[1:33:15] but I'm telling you the difference of
[1:33:17] the thinking and emotion of a
[1:33:20] 12-year-old girl and a 20-year-old girl
[1:33:23] is so radically it's though they weren't
[1:33:25] even the same
[1:33:30] being and you take that same spiritual
[1:33:33] growth it is so
[1:33:35] radical it's as though we're not even
[1:33:38] the same being that's
[1:33:41] right but whether Revelation is partial
[1:33:44] or full it has to align with all the
[1:33:46] word of
[1:33:47] God we cannot inject even one bit of
[1:33:52] air or our own thinking that's right I
[1:33:55] think this the conclusion is very
[1:33:58] obvious it must be this no it must be
[1:34:01] the word amen there's no room in there
[1:34:04] for our speculation there's no room for
[1:34:06] our assumption there's no room for for
[1:34:08] our
[1:34:09] conjecture it must be the word amen
[1:34:14] that's why I'm not boasting on myself
[1:34:16] but that's why I do my very best to
[1:34:18] preach what I term as a defensible
[1:34:20] message that if someone says but what
[1:34:22] you said about that that it's right
[1:34:25] here it's right here it's right here
[1:34:28] it's right here because otherwise our
[1:34:31] human thinking can take us down an
[1:34:33] Avenue that seems so close so
[1:34:37] appropriate that we're sure it's truth
[1:34:39] but it's just that one little
[1:34:43] Iota so spiritual Insight Revelation my
[1:34:46] brother and sister has to align with the
[1:34:48] word and one of those things it will do
[1:34:52] do you know that real true Revel will
[1:34:54] always bring us to a place of more of
[1:34:56] him and less of
[1:34:59] us a real Revelation is not I it's him
[1:35:07] am
[1:35:09] now it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:35:13] we'll put this up
[1:35:15] there please follow
[1:35:17] me just church denomination doesn't
[1:35:20] satisfy me someone say Amen to that if
[1:35:23] the scripture says one thing and the
[1:35:24] church teaches another that don't work
[1:35:27] if Jesus Christ lived in the apostles
[1:35:29] and done the signs that he was here on
[1:35:31] Earth it'll do it again if we'll get
[1:35:34] zeroed
[1:35:36] in this is not I believe a
[1:35:40] message this is I know my Creator I know
[1:35:44] my savior I know who he
[1:35:48] is not I
[1:35:50] heard our church had a Revival that's
[1:35:53] wonderful F did you that's
[1:35:56] it people go to church for years Revival
[1:35:59] after Revival never have a Revival
[1:36:01] themselves then that Revival is null and
[1:36:05] void the Revival should be there for you
[1:36:08] and you don't need a billboard
[1:36:10] collection of people fill the church
[1:36:13] careful with special speakers to have a
[1:36:18] Revival in fact most
[1:36:22] people I tell you most
[1:36:25] people are actually afraid of
[1:36:35] revivals because in a
[1:36:38] Revival you don't dictate what
[1:36:41] happens a real Revival I'm talking about
[1:36:45] you and your heart and soul and mind
[1:36:47] having a Revival you can't dictate that
[1:36:50] that's God's
[1:36:51] work and I hope I don't
[1:36:55] offend
[1:36:56] anyone but most of us are too held
[1:37:00] in and God's still prying our old habits
[1:37:04] thoughts Deeds words complexes out of
[1:37:10] us oh don't don't be offended I I I
[1:37:14] heard the same
[1:37:16] words
[1:37:18] H what we need is a
[1:37:22] Revival we got to get zeroed I don't
[1:37:24] care what the church says uh it'll group
[1:37:27] this or that oh Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:37:30] and all the other kinds of stuff and all
[1:37:31] these Creeds and all these things one
[1:37:33] way or another it's all right it ain't
[1:37:35] all right with me if the apostles hit
[1:37:37] the dot we can hit the dot too Can
[1:37:40] someone say Amen to that if we'll get
[1:37:43] zeroed in with God's word let our
[1:37:45] experience zero with his word let me
[1:37:48] read that again let our experience zero
[1:37:52] with his word
[1:37:54] they did it and if they did it why can't
[1:37:57] we do it if we'll zero in it'll do the
[1:38:01] same thing oh my my brother and sister
[1:38:04] but can you explain this can you explain
[1:38:06] that have you had this do you dream
[1:38:08] dreams do you write
[1:38:10] songs none of that matters my brother
[1:38:13] and sister if we're not zeroed
[1:38:16] in we got to get to the point that we
[1:38:19] become the word and the word becomes us
[1:38:23] amen cuz you can have all kinds of
[1:38:26] anointings and gifts and not hit the
[1:38:28] mark amen
[1:38:33] amen sister Jerry and I know a
[1:38:36] lady her
[1:38:38] husband argue up a storm with me over
[1:38:42] over the word of
[1:38:44] God said we are wrong said we're
[1:38:46] deceived said all these things and I'll
[1:38:48] say this boastfully I'm just telling you
[1:38:50] this man had an utter convincing
[1:38:52] argument and he believed his argument
[1:38:54] and not long after that occasion he left
[1:38:57] his wife for another
[1:38:59] woman now my brother and sister if the
[1:39:02] word produces that behavior his word
[1:39:06] produces that
[1:39:08] behavior I want to have a word that is a
[1:39:12] sin killing quenching amen cleansing
[1:39:18] Hallelujah grandma with the Brillo my
[1:39:20] brother and sister it hurts but you had
[1:39:22] clean elbows
[1:39:24] amen I want the word to be such I don't
[1:39:26] need to have a convincing argument I
[1:39:29] want God to give me a life that would
[1:39:31] convince
[1:39:34] hallelujah
[1:39:37] amen are we okay amen I don't know what
[1:39:40] time it is we still got just a minute or
[1:39:43] two okay this is going to be a little
[1:39:46] psychological Babel right my name's not
[1:39:49] Kamala but it might come out like a word
[1:39:51] salad
[1:39:53] our response to a statement is often
[1:39:57] influenced by our experience or lack of
[1:39:59] experience in the subject
[1:40:06] related let's just have two men talking
[1:40:08] about the Holy
[1:40:10] Ghost one has experience and one
[1:40:16] doesn't use the exact same
[1:40:20] words entirely different results
[1:40:27] can I just put it
[1:40:29] bluntly you can quote the message all
[1:40:31] you want we've got to have the goods to
[1:40:35] back it
[1:40:36] up but let me quantify that the prophet
[1:40:41] of God
[1:40:42] said if you have something that's been
[1:40:44] in your life and and you're there you
[1:40:47] want free of that you've went through
[1:40:49] the prayer line you've been prayed for
[1:40:52] whether the symptom changes or not you
[1:40:54] need to walk out and say I've been set
[1:40:57] free I'm delivered the same thing with
[1:41:01] healing you can have a disease or a
[1:41:05] condition and you get prayed for you
[1:41:07] claim that and let's make it easy to
[1:41:10] identify you've got a hip problem and so
[1:41:12] you walk funny and you're there and
[1:41:14] you're prayed for in the line and they
[1:41:16] in the name of Jesus Christ you've
[1:41:18] already healed and they walk out of the
[1:41:20] line and they still have a problem do we
[1:41:25] tell them not to worship God and claim
[1:41:27] their healing it's not what the prophet
[1:41:29] taught us Prophet said you leave from
[1:41:32] there I'm healed amen might not be one
[1:41:36] evidence anywhere around you that you
[1:41:39] have been healed but there certainly
[1:41:42] won't be any evidence if you don't claim
[1:41:44] your healing amen and so you do that
[1:41:48] Paul Ryan perfect example amen the the
[1:41:51] barber giving him a shave the barber is
[1:41:54] mocking him my brother and sister you
[1:41:55] guys do understand that from the story
[1:41:57] The Barber is not there going oh praise
[1:42:00] God the bar oh man you say you have what
[1:42:03] did he do yep God healed me and his eyes
[1:42:06] came
[1:42:07] open no more selling pencils for
[1:42:10] him amen my brother and sister what it
[1:42:13] took your confession sometimes it takes
[1:42:16] our own confession that there'll be
[1:42:18] something a besetting sin an issue in
[1:42:20] your life that you're troubling over and
[1:42:22] you need to stand up and say you know
[1:42:25] what God's already delivered me from
[1:42:26] this the symptom every symptom might
[1:42:29] still be there in your face but you have
[1:42:32] to step into the promise of God you got
[1:42:35] to step into your healing you got to
[1:42:37] step into your deliverance you need to
[1:42:39] step into Revelation amen amen oh you
[1:42:44] say step into Revelation yes the prophet
[1:42:46] of God said pray for Revelation that's
[1:42:48] stepping into it you're claiming that
[1:42:51] Revelation there's something there you
[1:42:53] you got for me Lord and I'm claiming it
[1:42:55] right now even though I don't even know
[1:42:58] what it is that's right
[1:43:02] my help us Lord amen sometimes we don't
[1:43:06] even know what God's got for us but you
[1:43:07] ought to be claiming it
[1:43:09] amen
[1:43:12] amen a little introspection here to zero
[1:43:15] in I wonder what does that mean to
[1:43:20] you prophet of God was talking about
[1:43:23] zeroing
[1:43:25] in I'll just be honest with you I hav't
[1:43:29] 100 years now but I had Old Faithful old
[1:43:34] cheap
[1:43:35] rifle and
[1:43:39] uh 300 Win Mag thing kicked like a
[1:43:43] mule I'd go shoot the target first shot
[1:43:46] usually was okay second was a little
[1:43:49] better after that I would Flinch like
[1:43:52] you can't believe
[1:43:54] cuz it was like being hit with a
[1:43:56] sledgehammer but you know in all the
[1:43:59] years I hunted with that
[1:44:01] rifle I only missed a little handful of
[1:44:06] shots oh you guys want to know this one
[1:44:08] off I have to share
[1:44:11] this I was at a place like job where I
[1:44:13] wondered Lord do you even hear
[1:44:16] me and went antalope
[1:44:19] hunting and I ended up seeing this this
[1:44:23] anvelope one hanging into my
[1:44:26] garage and realized once I started going
[1:44:30] up that way that the little Ravine that
[1:44:32] was there ran out turned into flat
[1:44:34] ground I got down on my belly I wanted
[1:44:36] this Antelope so bad I crawled through
[1:44:38] the little desert cactus till my
[1:44:40] forearms and my stomach was just filled
[1:44:42] full of
[1:44:44] quills and I got to the place that I may
[1:44:46] as well stood up and ran at the anvelope
[1:44:48] there wasn't a deal figured out the
[1:44:50] range about 500 yards
[1:44:55] and I did everything I thought I knew
[1:44:57] how to do and I pulled the trigger and
[1:44:59] here's Mr Antelope standing there
[1:45:01] looking at me like who are you
[1:45:06] fooling and Ed his feet and four feet in
[1:45:09] front boom my bullet hits Mr antalope
[1:45:12] runs this huge circle I thought he ran
[1:45:14] off the mountain he ran over the edge of
[1:45:16] the mountain I think he was leaving and
[1:45:18] the Lord said go
[1:45:20] back but that anvelope ran down there
[1:45:22] and all of a sudden he appears again
[1:45:24] runs back within a few feet I'm talking
[1:45:26] few feet of where he stood
[1:45:29] before my little brain started doing
[1:45:32] some
[1:45:32] calculus
[1:45:34] trigonometry let's see that was 4 feet
[1:45:38] low and 4 feet in front of
[1:45:41] him
[1:45:43] boom knocked him
[1:45:45] down now my brother and
[1:45:48] sister I had prayed a prayer that
[1:45:51] probably I shouldn't admit I
[1:45:55] prayed could you guess what that
[1:45:58] was Lord if you'll just let me kill this
[1:46:00] analou I'll never doubt you
[1:46:03] again that's not a very spiritual prayer
[1:46:06] for a
[1:46:08] Christian but God took it
[1:46:11] anyway how else would you have something
[1:46:14] I know one thing a bullet hit four feet
[1:46:15] in front of me I ain't sto until I'm off
[1:46:17] the
[1:46:18] mountain but my brother and sister you
[1:46:20] see God knows
[1:46:24] and so it comes to a time and a place
[1:46:25] that God is proving to you and I in the
[1:46:28] day that we live in he wants us to zero
[1:46:31] in and I say God will do anything to get
[1:46:34] you there you understand what I'm
[1:46:36] talking about
[1:46:39] scripturally God's Own word he won't
[1:46:41] cross his own word he won't take you out
[1:46:43] of his
[1:46:44] word but here God will do anything to
[1:46:47] zero you
[1:46:49] in he'll let you be sick
[1:46:54] he'll let you be tired he'll let you be
[1:46:57] discouraged he'll let you be
[1:47:02] broke he'll do
[1:47:04] anything to get you to come to the place
[1:47:06] you zero in on the word
[1:47:09] amen
[1:47:14] amen you see what's important to you is
[1:47:16] important to God
[1:47:18] Amen
[1:47:20] why otherwise how could God give this
[1:47:23] I'll be done in just a minute how could
[1:47:25] God say ask anything in my
[1:47:32] name come
[1:47:34] on the world asks and they get their
[1:47:38] Bentleys and they're Maseratis and they
[1:47:40] get that and they say see God's with us
[1:47:43] but he knew the bride of Christ would
[1:47:46] not ask a Miss
[1:47:49] amen more of you Lord amen less of me
[1:47:53] Lord more of you and he will honor that
[1:47:56] my brother and sister oh it's not about
[1:47:59] our wealth about our Fame about whatever
[1:48:01] it is he will honor your prayer less of
[1:48:05] me Lord and more of you and he'll answer
[1:48:07] that every single
[1:48:12] time okay are you guys okay for a few
[1:48:15] more minutes I I'm going to throw a a
[1:48:19] curveball I used to be able to throw one
[1:48:23] let's see if I can throw it
[1:48:25] today so in the last little bit I've
[1:48:29] come across several
[1:48:31] deals some ministers speaking about this
[1:48:34] and different things and we'll look at a
[1:48:37] time this is not a political rally but
[1:48:40] we're going to talk politics for a
[1:48:42] minute okay we're coming to a time we
[1:48:46] have a woman who's the vice president
[1:48:48] trying to be the president and there are
[1:48:52] those that are saying yep she's the
[1:48:54] Fulfillment of
[1:48:59] Prophecy trying to figure out who would
[1:49:03] agree she's a fulfillment of
[1:49:06] Prophecy of that woman that will
[1:49:09] come now in the later seean Church
[1:49:13] age but there'll be a powerful woman
[1:49:15] look at the year
[1:49:17] 1960 powerful woman now remember this is
[1:49:20] on tape to a powerful woman great woman
[1:49:22] shall eat either be president or be a
[1:49:24] woman representing the Catholic Church
[1:49:27] which I think it
[1:49:29] is we'll take over here someday and
[1:49:32] she'll rule this country this nation is
[1:49:35] a woman's nation and so you look at this
[1:49:38] my brother and sister and we'll look
[1:49:41] back I should have just went ahead and
[1:49:42] included it but I was afraid I'd be too
[1:49:44] long and I'm too long anyway so I might
[1:49:45] as well just made it longer but he even
[1:49:48] says in in another place vice president
[1:49:54] so we're looking at this and some people
[1:49:56] are here today to say this is the
[1:49:59] Fulfillment there here it all is this is
[1:50:00] what's going to happen Cala is going to
[1:50:02] win got to fulfill this scripture but my
[1:50:04] brother and sister we have to have our
[1:50:07] thinking aligned with God's thinking
[1:50:10] we've got to come to the place that
[1:50:12] we're not thinking our thought we are
[1:50:15] thinking and speaking God's thoughts
[1:50:18] amen and I only cherry-picked just a
[1:50:19] little bit knowing that if I got
[1:50:21] full-blown into this you got that think
[1:50:23] it was a political rally but we do now
[1:50:26] brother Brown also said as I said vice
[1:50:29] president so she's already fulfilled
[1:50:31] that so if some are worried about that
[1:50:33] it's already
[1:50:35] fulfilled now we come down here once
[1:50:38] more I got some other notes between
[1:50:40] these but I think they're a little bit
[1:50:41] redundant so I'll skip over them uh in
[1:50:44] the sermon once
[1:50:45] more now
[1:50:47] notice now what Delilah did to Samson
[1:50:52] when she kept wooing
[1:50:54] him oh you're a great man you are
[1:50:59] powerful but don't deceive me tell me
[1:51:01] wherein lith your strength and she loved
[1:51:05] him and she made love to him until
[1:51:08] finally he gave
[1:51:12] in and what did they do the first thing
[1:51:14] she did she had his secret taken from
[1:51:17] him
[1:51:19] well that's the same thing that happened
[1:51:22] and you readers and Bible students and I
[1:51:25] see a
[1:51:27] council the wooing that's right the
[1:51:30] wooing the
[1:51:33] wooing you realize how
[1:51:36] powerful we can be joined
[1:51:47] together the old path of Pentecost
[1:51:50] wanted to stay with the word
[1:51:54] and they adopted some Pagan ideas
[1:51:55] through Constantine and them and and
[1:51:58] brought as Ahab married Jezebel and
[1:52:00] brought in idolatry into Israel so did
[1:52:03] the church marry into romanism and bring
[1:52:06] in idolatry right straight back in the
[1:52:08] church again so here we have a church
[1:52:12] that the power of God is
[1:52:14] moving they don't want to be left out
[1:52:17] isolated because you have to understand
[1:52:19] if you study the full history that many
[1:52:22] of those church leaders who said we will
[1:52:25] never never never Embrace that somehow
[1:52:29] had an
[1:52:31] accident fell down the stairs in their
[1:52:33] own house ran over by their own Chariot
[1:52:37] many
[1:52:38] things what do you do you eliminate
[1:52:45] opposition or add a
[1:52:49] word right
[1:52:52] right and another word that's right and
[1:52:56] another
[1:52:57] word until the word is so watered
[1:53:01] down they think they're believing
[1:53:11] truth right back in the straight in the
[1:53:13] church
[1:53:14] again now you've got a little bunch of
[1:53:17] harlots on the same principles and now
[1:53:19] look what's taking place mother is
[1:53:21] wooing and again she's going to shave
[1:53:24] all your rights away from you God help
[1:53:26] that we'll never give it up it's this
[1:53:30] word or death now that's pretty strong
[1:53:33] words right there my brother and sister
[1:53:35] but old Patrick Henry when it came to a
[1:53:36] country said Give me liberty or give me
[1:53:38] death and was willing to stand behind
[1:53:41] that just for The Birth of a Nation
[1:53:43] right how about for the Salvation of
[1:53:50] souls the Council of churches putting
[1:53:52] themselves together uniting in
[1:53:54] Fellowship around Rome exactly what the
[1:53:57] Bible said it would do
[1:53:59] yeah the Holy Spirit came one in uh 1933
[1:54:03] Holy Spirit came one morning and told me
[1:54:05] seven things that would take place
[1:54:06] before this nation was destroyed one of
[1:54:08] them is that it's on an old paper here
[1:54:10] at the church many's looked at it uh how
[1:54:13] that we would go to war with Hitler and
[1:54:16] they how Germany would fortify and build
[1:54:19] the maano or the sigree line I believe
[1:54:22] it was 11 years before it's ever thought
[1:54:24] of and how that automobiles would
[1:54:26] constant constantly shape like eggs
[1:54:29] certainly is today and how that they
[1:54:31] would permit women to vote and in doing
[1:54:33] so they would elect the wrong president
[1:54:35] and this would be a woman stand up that
[1:54:37] would govern the United States not
[1:54:41] actually a
[1:54:43] woman but a
[1:54:47] church yes sir you see you can go back
[1:54:50] and find where it's talked about
[1:54:53] but he comes right here and says well
[1:54:55] it's not actually a
[1:55:00] woman if Kamala gets
[1:55:03] elected don't look at
[1:55:06] Kamala look for who's behind
[1:55:10] her it comes down to it what are you
[1:55:13] worried about if there's a bride in this
[1:55:16] last day don't look at the bride look
[1:55:19] who's behind her
[1:55:22] amen amen cuz you and I are not going to
[1:55:24] make a Rapture on our own
[1:55:26] Saints but Christ in you the hope of
[1:55:28] glory you are going to be victorious
[1:55:31] Overcomer and make a
[1:55:32] Rapture amen see it's not us it's
[1:55:37] him that's
[1:55:42] it hope you don't mind I say
[1:55:45] this you know it's got to be somebody
[1:55:47] behind her if you've listened to any of
[1:55:49] her talking
[1:55:53] yeah education yeah well we need to like
[1:55:57] yeah send um uh kids um they need
[1:56:01] School uh they they should they should
[1:56:03] be in school higher education yes yes
[1:56:07] they they should finish high
[1:56:09] school I'm just
[1:56:12] like oh
[1:56:15] mercy then I go my future is not in her
[1:56:19] hands that's right right thank you Lord
[1:56:23] cuz if it was my brother and sister we'd
[1:56:26] be in trouble but our future is in the
[1:56:29] hands of the king God Almighty the one
[1:56:31] who created heaven and earth amen made
[1:56:34] you and I individuals so unique that the
[1:56:37] world could identify
[1:56:40] you amen when I say that I'm talking
[1:56:43] about DNA and Etc so
[1:56:47] unique and God made us so unique he said
[1:56:50] I oh you
[1:56:52] brother tver
[1:56:54] Cox yes here you
[1:56:57] are right here in the palm of my hand
[1:57:00] praise the Lord yeah so unique he can
[1:57:03] identify
[1:57:05] us
[1:57:08] hallelujah my dad was a
[1:57:11] dairyman I don't know I think about the
[1:57:13] most he ever milked was about 90 cows
[1:57:16] back in that day was pretty good size
[1:57:18] knew every one of those cows by name
[1:57:22] my oh my and that was just a
[1:57:26] man almighty God thank you
[1:57:31] Lord yep not actually a
[1:57:36] woman but a
[1:57:38] church and I'm not saying this
[1:57:40] derogatory but there's still people that
[1:57:42] don't understand that it's not the woman
[1:57:45] that's
[1:57:46] right they're still looking still
[1:57:48] concerned oh she's the Fulfillment of
[1:57:50] Prophecy now she might be a tool that's
[1:57:52] God's using but it had nothing to do
[1:57:55] with what is taking
[1:57:56] place you know you guys have been to a
[1:57:58] puppet show
[1:58:00] before
[1:58:02] right that's what our Nations become a
[1:58:04] puppet
[1:58:06] show
[1:58:08] okay
[1:58:09] well I probably covered most of this
[1:58:12] well
[1:58:13] enough let me just close with this
[1:58:15] scripture 1 Corinthians 2
[1:58:20] chapter but if say is written I hath Not
[1:58:23] Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered
[1:58:26] into the heart of man the things which
[1:58:28] God hath prepared for them that love him
[1:58:32] you realize all that's prepared for
[1:58:34] you oh my but God hath revealed them
[1:58:38] unto us by his spirit for the spirit
[1:58:42] searcheth all things yay the Deep things
[1:58:44] of God for what man knoweth the things
[1:58:46] of a man save the spirit of man which is
[1:58:49] in him even so the things of God knoweth
[1:58:51] no man but the spirit of God now we have
[1:58:55] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:58:57] the spirit which is of god that we might
[1:59:00] know the things that are freely given to
[1:59:02] us of God now my brother and sister when
[1:59:05] we look at that verse right there if we
[1:59:08] do not know the things that have been
[1:59:10] freely given to us we need to reorder
[1:59:15] our life we need to restructure Our
[1:59:18] lives our family our household our
[1:59:21] priori ities if we don't know because
[1:59:25] right here it tells us we will know and
[1:59:27] so we ought to get very serious and get
[1:59:31] in there and know what is been given to
[1:59:34] us
[1:59:36] hallelujah all the nonsense knock it out
[1:59:39] of it brother Lonnie Jenkins knocked it
[1:59:40] out of me years ago when I answered some
[1:59:42] questions I said something about hoping
[1:59:45] to be in the Rapture or something like
[1:59:46] that and he just set me down in a chair
[1:59:49] and just give me the what for there's no
[1:59:51] such thing is hope when it comes to
[1:59:53] making a Rapture you are called to it
[1:59:56] you need to know that you're part of it
[1:59:58] and you need to let it show in your life
[2:00:00] that you know it's a part of you
[2:00:03] hallelujah amen not hope a certainty
[2:00:08] because it says you will know that's
[2:00:10] have that certainty I'm going to make it
[2:00:13] and then ask the lord lord if there's
[2:00:15] something in my life that it isn't
[2:00:17] lining up Let the spirit of Truth come
[2:00:19] and correct me bring me to that right
[2:00:23] place am
[2:00:24] [Music]
[2:00:29] Hallelujah which things also we speak
[2:00:31] not in The Words which man's Wisdom
[2:00:33] teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[2:00:35] teacheth we need a teacher all right
[2:00:38] Saints we need to be need to be
[2:00:40] taught and it's good that men ministers
[2:00:43] have a gift of of calling of being
[2:00:45] teachers but what we need more than the
[2:00:48] man with the calling of being a teacher
[2:00:51] is the holy SP Spirit teaching us
[2:00:54] hallelujah amen that'll teach young and
[2:00:57] old
[2:01:00] amen but what the Holy Spirit teaches
[2:01:03] Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual
[2:01:06] things with spiritual but the natural
[2:01:08] man receiveth not the things of the
[2:01:10] spirit of God for they are foolishness
[2:01:12] unto him neither can he know them
[2:01:14] because they are spiritually discerned
[2:01:17] that's
[2:01:18] right I'm sorry but knowing Greek Hebrew
[2:01:23] aramic none of that will
[2:01:33] matter don't want to get sidetracked
[2:01:37] here but he that is
[2:01:40] spiritual judgeth all things yet he
[2:01:42] himself is judged of no man for who hath
[2:01:45] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[2:01:48] instruct him but we have the mind of
[2:01:51] Christ
[2:01:53] okay one last very brief quote here and
[2:01:57] I'm done
[2:01:59] okay not even an
[2:02:03] amen Christ revealed in his own word I
[2:02:06] believe it it needs no interpreter for
[2:02:09] the Bible said that God does his own
[2:02:11] interpreting of the Bible it is of no
[2:02:13] private interpretation said Peter all
[2:02:15] right and all the scripture is divinely
[2:02:18] given divinely set in order and the
[2:02:20] whole thing is the Rev ation of Jesus
[2:02:25] Christ can you imagine someone would
[2:02:29] come in the presence of God and wouldn't
[2:02:31] be able to explain the
[2:02:33] seals I
[2:02:36] can I met a few Brothers I won't say
[2:02:39] where don't want to be derogatory for a
[2:02:42] part of the
[2:02:45] world they wouldn't be able to put it to
[2:02:50] words and I've known
[2:02:52] those that were given a book and didn't
[2:02:57] even read
[2:02:59] English and by God's Divine
[2:03:05] pleasure they read the
[2:03:12] book eskimo brother in the hospital a
[2:03:14] heart attack and Anchorage they flew him
[2:03:16] from the village he was from he's in the
[2:03:19] hospital wakes up in the middle of the
[2:03:21] night and it's like it's playing on a
[2:03:23] screen in front of
[2:03:25] him and he's reading
[2:03:28] it he got out of bed got dressed went to
[2:03:32] a nephew's house borrowed a
[2:03:35] snowmobile rode hundreds literally
[2:03:39] hundreds of miles across the tundra that
[2:03:43] God built in GPS that he gave them shows
[2:03:47] up at family's house walks in and tells
[2:03:50] them this message that brother Andrew
[2:03:52] has presented to you is the truth
[2:03:56] believe
[2:03:58] it oh my brother and sister we're so
[2:04:01] trumped into that we got to this and we
[2:04:03] got to that and it'll be this and it'll
[2:04:05] be that God loved their soul so much
[2:04:09] that he raised an elder that was weak
[2:04:12] and feeble and put such strength in him
[2:04:15] to ride a snowmobile for uh from bethl
[2:04:18] to chac across that my brother and
[2:04:20] sister most of us couldn't even find the
[2:04:24] trail and stand in front of them in a
[2:04:27] supernatural element and say this is the
[2:04:30] truth and died in Victory believing the
[2:04:34] word of God my brother and sister oh I
[2:04:38] need to quit divinely given divinely set
[2:04:40] in order and the whole thing is the
[2:04:42] revelation of Jesus Christ New and Old
[2:04:44] Testament where they for foretold of him
[2:04:47] coming do you realize that we're
[2:04:49] foretelling the coming of Christ
[2:04:52] yes everything that's in you coming to
[2:04:54] pass coming to maturity is telling of
[2:04:58] the coming of
[2:05:01] Christ my well you know the lamb
[2:05:05] Revelations tells us the lamb has a
[2:05:08] wife that's right and she has made
[2:05:11] herself
[2:05:12] ready she's not in a process of hoping
[2:05:16] to she is making herself ready why
[2:05:20] because she knows
[2:05:23] that he's coming for
[2:05:27] her oh my sister Ruth would you come
[2:05:31] I've got to
[2:05:33] stop he would do then what he got here
[2:05:36] and what he would do in this age to come
[2:05:38] see that makes him the same yesterday
[2:05:40] today and forever see like in Hebrews
[2:05:42] there when Paul wrote it he is God Jesus
[2:05:44] Christ yesterday of the Old Testament
[2:05:46] he's Jesus Christ today manifested in
[2:05:48] the
[2:05:50] flesh and he's Jesus Christ forever in
[2:05:53] the spirit to come see same yesterday
[2:05:55] today and forever and he ever lives to
[2:05:57] make his word live what it said it would
[2:06:00] do for that age amen what did he say it
[2:06:03] would do for this age right here come on
[2:06:05] my brother and
[2:06:06] sister he never give us an exemption
[2:06:09] card never said you'll never get sick
[2:06:12] you'll never get tired you'll never get
[2:06:13] discouraged you'll never this you'll
[2:06:15] never that but he did said I'll come for
[2:06:17] you hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus
[2:06:21] thank you Lord well I I I I I shouldn't
[2:06:25] even put it this way but I want to say I
[2:06:27] hope this made sense because you see
[2:06:29] I've been struggling over this for a
[2:06:31] little bit and if it didn't make sense
