want to do is love him love his holy name oh all I want to do is love him so glad I feel his love for me Jesus Paid the price of redemption [Music] my everyday my heart will praise him oh I'll never be the same all I want to do is n't it wonderful the Lord has given us the privilege when we get to heaven Saints we will sing the songs of redemption and you know I just caught in this thought when we realize we can sing something that even the angels will fall silent we'd say well they never fell they they don't have to do that but my brother and sister how great it is we see The Parables through the word of God how great it is redemption amen it is not just something of the failure but it is of the perfect plan of God to redeem us to call us I want to be able to lift my voice on the other side I want to sing loud and clear and to be able to sing from the depths of my soul to say thank you Lord for saving my soul oh Hallelujah God bless you Saints good to see each one tonight those who would not be with us we just pray the Lord would just come down and touch them be with them and say either home or travel or whatever the situation might be amen and uh you know I I don't know I imagine most of you that uh sister April has shared uh the last one she shared with us so I don't know if we're all on the same page but how my heart just broke for the little girl did she share that with you in the church here the little girl that burnt herself just missed her eye burned herself on the side of her face her ears shoulder let's remember they're nameless to us they're faceless to us but they have a soul and they suffer and let's just be faithful as as a church to to lift them up amen I I view it just my personal expression as uh sister April there in her humanitarian effort but she'll be a witness amen a light in the darkness that we may never more than likely would never have opportunity and and it has an impact Amen to realize that that God allows these things and places that and to by natural gifts that were given to be a doctor to touch lives but there is there the expression of one connecting as it is Woman to Woman you might say sister to sister and have them speak their words and she's there as she expressed I'm not there to try to correct I'm there to just live and let's just remember those those people amen I want to continue on tonight thank you musicians brother Tim appreciate that and uh we just appreciate the gifts that God has placed in the body I want to speak to you once again on our journey and uh you know as we travel it uh we uh go we see we encounter we experience and tonight we're going to take a trip on the Jericho Road and uh the Jericho Road my brother and sister obviously as we go into the scripture was uh not always a friendly place not always a place to feel comfortable in your travels not always a place that people were blessed and let's turn into a book of Luke the 10th chapter starting with the 25th the verse and this story that we're going to read and embrace tonight actually probably has a minimum of a half a dozen sermons contained within it encapsulated you might say and in that there's several different thoughts but this is the direction we feel led to go tonight and we we see you can go back in Luke 10 and catch the whole story but we see how this comes now and and Jesus is there you know the Pharisees and Sadducees and everyone's just they're just not happy here's somebody who has abandoned the program Lord help us to never have a program but here's someone who is abandoning the program and they're not happy now this is stuff that's going to be left to the Messiah when he comes this is the supernatural that would be given only to one of a superior spiritual position and here's this interloper who has broken the program amazing my brother and sister how it can be that the very one that they preach about they pray about and look forward to could be right in their midst and miss it entirely Lord help us amen keep us focused Lord that we don't miss it because of the program and behold of Luke 10 and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou and he answering and he answering said thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and he said unto him thou Hast answered right this do and thou shalt live this is not a long drawn-out explanation of creation of redemption of our place in the temple our place in the Kingdom it doesn't get much simpler in a very complicated way than this what did the prophet tell us he said God comes in simplicity and he reveals himself in the same amen but he willing this might have been Paul that was sitting here I'm sorry to say tonight but he willing to justify himself said unto Jesus and who is my neighbor Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell Amongst Thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there come down a certain you know there's nothing by chance I love how God lays this out the word says and by chance but it wasn't by chance God knew this man would walk down there come down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendeth more when I come again I will repay thee Heavenly Father we just ask you to bless the Saints tonight in your precious name amen you may be seated as we would look at this to go back into the scriptures we would see here my brother and sister that you know it's the unbeliever that always has the question of Temptation on their mind and it's always their way of trying to be provocative uh not constructively they believe it is but you know this this lawyer would have just loved to have proven a point uh on which uh Jesus would have looked negative and uh so it's there that we realize that as it is that uh the the spirit has always been here but my brother and sister it's even actually here today people would come and they would say well you know we just don't believe what you believe we believe you're caught up in this and that and isn't it amazing if I could just put it in this context tonight that when God gave a promise in this page of the Bible he actually gave the unbeliever something to declare compromise on this page of the the Bible so it all depends on the spirit of the reader as to what he actually gets from the page amen and so it's there that if we are looking for the positive we will see the positive if we are looking to the negative we will see the negative and you know they have a term in the modern day that we live in called cause cognitive dissonance and you know it's there that you know you can just fool yourself as their premise you read and you just believe what you want to believe and I say Amen to that amen because there's something down inside of me when I read this word and I study the message of the hour there's something inside of me says that is the truth believe it and my body you know my spirit says amen I believe that now am I here brainwashed well they did a really poor job because you know there's things in my life that I come up against and and I have to just to satisfy the flesh man man now I hope you follow me tonight there's things if I can put in this context there's things I Paul come up to that I have to satisfy for this flesh man which means I have to go back and dig into something to make sure it is what it says it is therefore I'm not going to just throw it all up and say whatever it is said I believe it I need to see as it were for myself and you know the prophet of God said if there's things that you don't understand you know I'm going to put this in my words don't make a big deal out of it don't stumble over this don't let it stumble you and cause you to turn back just put it on the shelf and you just wait and God will confirm it in his time and I can tell you tonight he's done that over and over and over in my life than I have had a question about something and then just seemingly out of the blue right it's not by accident it's not by chance it's the season that God says I'm going to Enlighten or give you Revelation concerning these things and there it becomes very clear to you now my brother and sister in that state we don't have to back up and say Lord forgive me because as I've said many times and it is a little thing that I don't know where I even got it from but I I I don't have a problem myself uh stating this that it's all right to ask God a question it's not right to question God there's a tremendous difference between those two and if I ask each one of you tonight what is the difference we would get you know the same same thing with different verbiage but my brother and sister God is allowing us to come as humans he created us to come and to get an answer or to ask the question to get the answer and the other is actually questioning as they say maybe the moral or fiber of the being in other words you can ask a question in such a way you're almost telling someone you're a liar right and still put a question mark on the end so we come we ask God questions and God says I'll give you answers just be patient so we look at this and see now that uh this lawyer is trying to trying to put this in such a way to put Jesus in a bad light but what does Jesus do he tells him you know what what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the word and I want you to tell me when you read the word what did it tell you and so what does he do now the lawyer probably being clever enough would look and say well if I deviate from the words of Moses in one iota I'm the one that looks bad here and so it's there that all he can do is respond with the word now whether he really believed that word and it really had effect in his life or not that's all he could speak and I want to throw this out to you this is why some of the greatest uh uh frauds going on in the world today in the name of religion are preaching the gospel and you would say Well they're preaching the word that's what they're saying that's what they're saying but my brother and sister it's not what come out of their mouth it's what's in their spirit and they're using the gospel for their own benefit they're actually twisting it while they're using the exact words and so here's a lawyer who is twisting but yet has to use the words because he himself cannot deviate from the word otherwise he marks himself so he says how do you read it and as I already shared with you we can read this a lot of different ways my brother and sister one of them coming back that is is uh just something that we'll uh probably go on in Bible study down the road here and just go real slow through the prophet of God showing us through the word the godhead but as we'll look at this now that we realize What's Happening Here with this lawyer is that he is going to have to Now voice his Revelation or how he reads the word see how Jesus has turned that around this is a long thing to go out but you'll see that's what Jesus actually did to the disciples he said who do you say I am it was no longer what you said Jesus it's no longer the words we can quote of your words but now we have to come and speak it back out and that's what God wants you and I today not as a test as it were but to be able to come because the word coming back from us not just what we took in but what's coming back from us defines us and as the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour we're asking God to reveal to us every Gap every shortcoming every void everything we don't have now this is not a message of knowledge that we quote it back to get into heaven but it's here that this bride of Christ wants to know who her bridegroom is he wants to know what he desires from her and so she is there in putting herself in a position that Lord I heard but now I want to speak because I want to be able to comprehend I want to be able to speak this out and to have a prayer every day of Our Lives Lord if I'm not right if there's something there correct me that is something we should do and so it's there that we find that uh the same scriptures my brother and sister that we would use Matthew 28 19 Acts 2 38 entirely different interpretations entirely different when they when they bring this back out and speak this back out they're going two different directions and we were just discussing this a little bit today but you witnessed to a trinitarian and they say well what do you believe and you tell them Acts 2 38 establish it in this scripture and they say that's what I believe so look how slippery Satan is to give them the word he doesn't talk Matthew 28 19 out of the Bible he doesn't chop Acts 2 38 or acts 19. he doesn't take any of these out of the Bible he just puts a Twist to it that the people are not fully understanding or grasping and so this lawyer quotes the scripture correctly he interprets this as it were correctly but underlying motive or Spirit behind it is an entirely a different Spirit another spirit that is that is Anointed there and so you know in the human intellect we've seen this in the message my brother and sister people can put almost any twist they want to put on the message and they can use that and come back to the Bible come back to quotes of brother Branham and say well this is correct but my brother and sister what did Jesus say what does the word say not a Twist but just the pure unadulterated word and so it's there you know he speaks out and gets it perfectly correct and says you know answering me says thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and so he was well versed in the scripture but he's standing there in a position that down in his heart there's something that he's trying to put a Twist on what is our neighbor who is our neighbor and this is what he comes back instead of just taking the word at face value you know I just read a quote of a man here years ago and somebody said hey you often you often say that um you will only tell the truth and he said yes that's what I say that's what I do and they said well what about if it's to your benefit or something and he says look if you just tell the truth you don't have to remember the story so we see now that Jesus is laid down to this lawyer a place not who do you lawyers say that I am but he took him back to the word because the word was there forever anchor the Torah was there forever angry it was what Moses said what Moses said what Moses said so Jesus doesn't say look there's a new promise there's a fulfillment of scripture here now he takes them back to the thing that they are anchored in they can tell that same story and he does and so he brings that out but it is there that he brings it in a way and being willing to to justify himself verse 29 he says and who is my neighbor now if he was trying to understand my brother and sister he would he would be there saying okay I need some clarity I don't understand but as a religious man and a lawyer he knew what the word said and so he's trying to then get something out of Jesus that he himself actually knew what the answer so he's trying to justify himself now my brother and sister he's just not really trying to understand he's trying to find fault and I just want to deviate for one moment if you don't mind that's what's happening in the day that Spirit never died there's a lot of people wanting to justify themselves they're trying to find faults somewhere else that they themselves will feel good about their position but my brother and sister just like this lawyer if he's not in the word he's out of the word amen if he wasn't in the right Spirit then he's in the wrong spirit amen and we have those same things happening today that people are speaking they're very qualified they have abilities but they're coming and they underlying in their Spirit have a fault to find with something now this is going to be maybe a little different way to put it but you'll have a little mercy on me they're trying to find fault with something they can't live but I can't live it either but I know the one who lives amen and that is what it's all about it's not our claim on him it's his claim on us and that sets us in a position because I make mistakes daily as the prophet of God said we backslide daily amen and so it's in that position that the critic is trying to find fault with something that they themselves are not happy with they themselves cannot live or do not see the revelation of it so they're their finding fault because everything if you go back and study you'll find that everything that Jesus spoke publicly every recorded words that we have that Jesus spoke you can take it back in the Torah and find its foundation he never brought one false Doctrine never brought one false interpretation never brought as it were one personal revelation every one of those is anchored in the Old Testament as prophecy amen so it's there now let's just look right here in in uh verse 30. what does Jesus do he doesn't go back he doesn't contest he doesn't go back and say you have a misunderstanding or you have a lack of Revelation now that's a human element that we ought to learn and that is is when you deal with people who don't see it like you you don't need to come and put their face in the book and prove them wrong you need to just give them space and it is there that as my dad used to say you give the old cow enough rope she'll hang herself amen so you just set back to just let it go because if they have a correct Spirit then God will bring them around to that position and open their eyes but if the spirit is not correct then God's not going to give Revelation to them because they're still babes as the prophet of God talking about teaching algebra amen so you look at this and see how that God has come now and Jesus answered and says this is how it comes a certain man he went down Jerusalem Jericho and uh was fell among Thieves and and when you read that basically you kind of can turn that around and the thieves fell on him amen so he's there and um they they uh stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and so we'll look at this now and just imagine on the Jericho Road a road you have traveled many many times and now as a priest you're coming down down here and here is a man who is pardon me for putting it straight but here's a man who is virtually naked if not naked laying on the side of the road but bloodied and battered and um you know the priests had to purify themselves they had to go through time of cleansing they couldn't touch unclean things and they couldn't and no doubt this man is traveling and he looks at that and to himself see now the lawyer is trying to justify himself but let's just take this a little deeper here is the priest and he's walking down the Jericho Road and he sees this man instead of saying you know what let's help this man let me even if I can't do it myself let me run to the inn and find those that can help and carry this man back to Doctor him but instead he looks at the man and says you know what I I I he's kind of beneath us maybe he knew the man maybe he deserved that hasn't been faithful in church lately so whatever has come upon him probably deserves it see you have to look into the human mind how it would be and all of the things that it would go thousands of little tributaries that take it off to this must be the will of God or this is that or this man's beneath me or you know what I'm wearing my best garments and I've got an appointment down here at the Sanhedrin and I can't you know and everything but he justifies himself that a man human a part of humanity is laying there and he justifies it to himself to just leave them there and walk on and as he goes the scripture doesn't deal with this but I don't believe because we're humans and I don't know about you but a pretty visual person myself if I had walked by that man laying bloody on the side of the road I I would have had a hard time just dismissing that out of my mind and so it's there that this priest puts different reasons various reasons and moves on and goes about his way and goes about his day and so it's there as it comes down so this priest has been a gone he's outside uh you know beyond site and likewise a Levi very much the same position as the priest the very religious of the day these were the god-called in of the day now my brother and sister the prophet of God talks about how we end up with women preachers can we remember exactly what brother Brown laid as a foundation of why the woman preacher raised up my brother and sister your brother Branham says they raised up because the men wouldn't do their job and so we'll look at the world we live in today how these Spirits have never changed and it's there that we'll find that these things are usually a result my brother and sister you can study history if you care to you study World War II and uh the the issues that happen prophet of God says the issues that happened in Russia were caused by the Catholic Church they turned to follow says I mean to communism because Catholicism failed them now there's not a sermon about Catholicism but but you see there's a there's always a something that brings about a result there's always something that is what I can't even think that it's right on the edge of my mind cause and effect cause and effect so now we have a levite also a very religious man also a man to go in and out of the temple has to be purified and they got up every day and there was ritual that they followed to meet their own imposed code of worship and so they're going now and he sees him and this is something that I find my brother and sister that is more remarkable if I could just depict this to you you know they are over by the piano is uh this this poor man who's been robbed and beaten and the priest he just moves over here on the left hand shoulder of the road and he doesn't even bother and he just keeps right on going but here it is the priest is caught in a little different anointing and he is there he sees the man he goes over he even stops and looks at the man and says yep pretty bad he's been robbed and he's been beaten yep that's too bad and then he goes back over and goes on down the road and there he is justifying to himself his response now my brother and sister you look at that and and we've seen the the failure you might say of ministry amen and I'm just going to be real blunt tonight people today are saying We only listen to tapes because the ministry has failed us well I'm here to tell you the word of God says there is faithful Ministry that will be on the scene at the coming of the Lord that's there for the perfecting of the Saints and I'm not doing this to lift up the preacher I'm here speaking this tonight to tell you that word of God will come to pass it isn't about me or Chris or Brother David or anyone else my brother and sister it's about the word coming to pass and if I can't count on that word of God coming to pass then what else can I not count on so I believe that in its entirety but yet we have these examples of these men that for whatever reason in the finery of their life they're not willing to touch this bloody and beaten man but look at this now a certain Samaritan as he Journey he come where he was and when he saw him he had compassion the first thing that touched his heart and I'm not going to go into it tonight of how I come across this thought but God just dealing with me of a circumstance amen and you look at that what happened this Samaritan now what is a Samaritan he was a Jew and a gentile cross oftentimes connected into pagan or ungodly worship everyone looked down on Samaritans they even accused Jesus of being a Samaritan because they were using that as a slur right but we'll find that God had called someone out of every nation Kindred and tongue I don't care how bad they have a reputation and how bad they have a reputation God called them they will respond amen because this word will come to pass now this certain man that regardless of wealth history will tell you that they were rich and poor they were of influence and unknown and still looked down on but the Samaritans themselves were a little bit prejudiced or racist or however you want to put it because the Samaritans themselves held certain books of the writings of Moses and it was there that they believed they had a finer or more accurate form of worship than the rest of the Jews did and so they themselves had their own words that they blasted back their own attitudes that they blasted back their own pushback on this and we'll find there that amongst them they had their ultra-religious and religious and zealots and whatever else amongst the the Samaritans and many of them said because we are the keepers of these books of the Torah of books of Moses that we actually have more Revelation look how this goes back and forth we've got more Revelation than the common old Jews over there do amen they just abused the law of Moses right and left and we've got the books we're the keeper of these books and we have the pure word for our day and yet they still have some muddy water over here to deal with and some things that they didn't have lined up either amen but look how God is using this now when we take that and the reason I brought that point out is you'll find that these Samaritans by and large were religious people and some had the truth I'm sorry how religious we are has nothing to do with it it's whether we have the truth or not amen so you look at this scene now this Samaritan he sees this man and he sees where he was and what does he do he might have traveled I'm just going to put it this way just be kind to me tonight the sidewalk was on this side of the road and he got off the sidewalk just like the levite only when he got over there his heart went out and he said you know what someone I don't know they might all been visual to each other the Samaritan might have seen the priest he might have seen the Levi and he might have thought mine they they should have helped this man and so as Jesus is talking to this lawyer he lays this story out and then he asked the question and he drops the balm you might say on them which one of these my words here which one of these is more spiritual and the lawyer himself had enough character and understanding to say hmm the one that actually helped the one that actually had compassion now we look at this and realize my brother and sister that every one of these had an equal opportunity but this my brother and sister was a place in a situation that I want to just bring and loop this back around to you tonight for a few minutes this was three classes of people the ultra religious the religious and a man that according to scripture made no claim at all he was just there a Samaritan now I hope this is not offensive in my short life I've dealt with all kinds of people I've been in meetings before where people would say how long has your family been in the message well my parents come in the message in 1970 or so oh long time long time why don't you ask me how long I've been in the message or that's even irrelevant how long has the message been in me but people judge that another one I've experienced through the years to be in meetings I marry it very very well to be there enjoying fellowship with this brother gentleman and finally goes well who's your pastor and I said well you know what there's been all this circumstance all this stuff and I don't want to explain it but we don't have a pastor right now and I am not exaggerating as I hold the conversation with this man and I said we don't have a pastor right now he just turns and walks off not having a pastor obviously took me out of the message not having a pastor obviously took me out of the will of God hmm and speaking of having pastors I've been with people who have said if your church ain't growing like exponentially the words not being preached but the prophet of God said our churches will probably get smaller not bigger so we have classes of people and how they approach this and how they look at the people we also have to deal with people who are judgmental over everything but their own opinion and so it's in that realm that God deals with this and so here it is uh Jesus is taking away from this lawyer his argument of dealing with these things and you know it we have to come and and look at this and why is it that God chooses the Samaritan well I can't answer that but in the um in the seven Church ages simonian Church age here um you see here he says you see the one difference between Israel and the rest of the Nations was God put God to one side and Israel was like any other nation and let me put this right here my brother and sister put God to the side and Grace Tabernacles like any other Church when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man put the leadership of the Holy Ghost Assad and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it hmm so it don't matter what title or position that we possess we have one connection and that is to have not only his name but to have his Spirit and the life amen otherwise we end up being a church just like the world the world and the church are all of the same lump just like Jacob and Esau were of the same parents but the spirit of God makes a difference it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the spirit of God in you for what without that Spirit you are reprobate and you are none of his and so I hope you're catching my connection right here we got a priest we've got a Levine but they had not one bit of compassion for this man there in fact he was beneath them but we have a man that we don't see an identity spiritually and he had something I'm going to believe that he was a Believer there was something in him that says it is my almost my my obligation as it were not just helping the man I wanted to kind of separate that tonight it's not just about oh I must help this man but there was something down in inside of him that says I am obligated as it were to express the Life of Christ to express the life of my God and His Spirit coming through me has to produce the word in flesh manifested amen otherwise we can just talk about it we don't need anything but just talk about it we can tell the story just talk about it but there has to be a life and my is there a lot of quotes that go with this but there has to be a life manifested and it starts with the spirit amen I hope I'm not baffling you with my my words amen now the likely we'll share this scripture in just a second but the likely does not mean they will and the unlikely does not mean they won't and we'll back that up with Matthew 21 and we see this little story this little Parable here but what think ye a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said Son go work today in my Vineyard and he answered and said I will not but afterward he repented and went and he came to the second and said likewise and he answered and said I go sir and went not wither of them Twain did the will of his father they say unto him the first Jesus saith unto them verily I say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you boy that was a hard statement I'm sure they were not the least bit happy with his words to tell them because they were there and they put up all this bold front they put up all this face about we are doing the will of God and I hope you catch it tonight amen I almost wish we weren't on the internet my brother and sister I want you to catch tonight there's been times that we have come and God wanting us to do something and we just held on drug our feet almost chained ourselves to the mast yeah but then God would deal with us and we'd realize I need to I should and we respond to God's call in our life and then we see the scripture here some are like gonna do it and they don't Lord help us I personally think this applies to every single one of us in the correct context of the times you know you get a bunch of preachers together I like to style these conversations because it gets awkward but you get a bunch of preachers together and we've quit preaching so many times we'd feel the encyclopedia clear what what is Paul's story I have quit preaching at least 10 million times but then God stirs you and you go this is what God called me to do I've got to do this and we all have this we've all got down in our our little dark valleys you know what I mean brother Trevor we're down there and the trees are so thick and the brush is so thick and we're just like I'll never make it back on the mountain I'm just quitting but then you sit down and something starts to Echo I'm not a quitter what is that God stirring us and we get up and we Press On so it is that we see now Jesus speaking to the lawyer and he's making a case does Jesus directly rebuke him tell him he's wrong tell him that he's off the word no he doesn't but what he does is he lays the story out and the words and the actions and the anointing on the man actually speaks in a fashion that no man's words could affect him as much as that as amen so it's there that it was not uh the office that they held it wasn't an outer identity my brother and sister that hindered either the priest or uh the uh um um um levite I was going to say the priest and the evangelist it wasn't the office they held and it wasn't an outward identity my brother and sister like my fine robes I might get them dirt it was something down inside it was something inside of them that actually hindered them from fulfilling the very words that the lawyer is quoting and the lawyer knows that he wouldn't have helped not man either I still to this day Marvel and wonder what did Jesus write in the dirt he wrote something powerful my brother and sister now I don't want to scrutinize that too much because God uses his word that he's riding on the tables of our hearts to do the exact same thing in our life the word he's writing on us is causing the same effect only we don't leave the word we repent but it's the same effect he's writing amen right there imagine fleshly table of our heart he's writing the word and we have that those feelings those times those things we look now and we say oh my that's me but what the difference is is that we as Sons and Daughters of God repent we don't turn and walk away in our sin and our unbelief amen so I think I say that brother Trevor amen praise the Lord because otherwise we just have a whole encyclopedia full of un dealt with issues in our life but God says nope nope so it is an issue of the heart amen it's not the identity but it's the heart and so it's their correct uh you know possessing the correct nature is much more important than we oftentimes really emphasize not right nature to have a Meek and a humble and contrite spirit to to not be lifted up not beheading not high-minded but to catch that and we'll look here and see in these that it's the actions that spoke very loud the identity on the Samaritan is nothing more than his ethnic identity it doesn't speak of office it doesn't speak a physician it doesn't speak of rich or poor it doesn't speak of anything else a realm of influence it just speaks and that's who he was but there was something in that man that he looked and saw that amen so what is Jesus doing he gives a word test to the lawyer and he's speaking my brother and sister of something that took place on the highway and not even a direct influence to this man but the whole Revelation or hidden meaning or story is very plain to the man and it's there that he realizes he himself while trying to trap is trapped and then I thank God for that amen that when the devil would like to trap us God comes around and springs that back where the word comes and puts the devil right back in his place amen where he cannot come and have free reign to throw out doubts and accusations he doesn't have free reign to be the accuser of the brother he's been put back in his place and he can still accuse but we can say it's under the blood it's not held to my account it's under the blood I've been forgiven it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness and the devil keeps coming and we just say that devil forget it hey you've been put back in your place we know who you are amen Hallelujah the answer was in the word and my brother and sister I'm coming I hope you don't mind I express it this way but I'm coming to be just a little short on people with all kinds of nonsense around the message because they have ideas my brother and sister we're message Believers are we not amen and we believe the Bible is our absolute so if it's in the Bible and God has given us a message let's take it back to the Bible run it through the filter and take it back to the word the message of the hour which is the word expressed in our day and live it do what the prophet said people are like well can we do this and can we do that and is this okay what does the word say what does a message say Amen if we want to compare to another religion let's go read their manual but we have a manual my brother and sister and it's right here and it's called the Bible amen and I I guess I'm getting a little short with people saying well you know now I've seen a picture I've seen a picture of brother branham's daughters and and their skirts were above their knee so you saw a picture what did the word say what was the painting that was painted for us now I just grabbed that as an example right but people are like off of a picture of brother Brown's daughters they're going to change their whole dress code believing they can justify their position by a picture and brother Brown let his daughters do that I'm just going to go out Lulu land you guys might just throw me out with the bathwater tonight we wouldn't have a clue that maybe three minutes five minutes 30 seconds before that brother Branham might have turned to his daughters and said Becky that skirt is too short or as the one picture Sarah it's not really appropriate Well we'd be 30 40 years later see see that's how I'm going to live like that right there see don't know that the prophet of God said you ought not be out here like that so what are we going to do now my brother and sister I can tell you there's churches where if we hiccuped the Deacon would probably drag you out give you a tongue lashing and I've been in churches that they practically and the message have moved to coffee and donuts in the sanctuary which into this are we going to go to we're message believers we're going to the word and that's our absolute right there in the word because I don't know where they're going and I don't know where they're going but just like Jesus spoke to this lawyer and said if you do this you live he didn't compromise on that he said you this is where it's at and you do it and if you're obedient to that you live oh my I hope this making sense to you amen what was it the answer was in the word Satan had the question my brother and sister but the word held the answer amen and in our day we have the answer to the devil's question the devil's out here going this way and going that way trying to read you find what a message believer is my brother and sister there's no redefining we believe this it is our absolute amen and this is what we are encountering on our road amen down to Jericho we're meeting thieves and we're meeting the spirit of the lawyer and we're meeting the real believer that has something in his heart where the word means something the life means something and we're going to encounter each and every one of those on this journey now what are we going to do the scripture says that we would not be of those that are tossed to and fro on every wind of Doctrine but we're anchored and this is my this is my life this is my faith this is who I am and we're anchored into that position because the road to Jericho has been proven by scripture not to be a very good road not a not a healthy road not a a good thing that's always going to happen my brother and sister the cares of life the careless of life those who could care less about your life are going to all be found on the Jericho Road now having preached this and there are several different thoughts and like I shared with you not going tonight but Lord dealing with me along this line I want you to understand tonight this is not about not helping or helping it's about the following of the leadership of the Holy Spirit right you say but we should Jesus said the poor will be with you always so we can't go fix the problem of every poor person out here you know you realize years ago just a tad bit of world history if you don't mind for a second you realize after World War II men like Eisenhower had a dream when they saw the dire poverty and starvation of Europe after World War II and they took a position that we have to raise this was part of the creation of the World Bank in their eyes we realized that it had a greater fulfillment but in their eyes they said we are going to make a concerted effort to raise the economy of the world that there would be no third world sounds good doesn't it if you've lived or traveled or passed through third world you realize third world can be really far down there they never they chose never to go beyond third world but I'm telling you I've been in places that would be fourth or fifth and then they realize they can't bring all of them up and they turned around and said for equality isn't that amazing that that is something that's come up now for equality's sake we're going to take everybody down to their level except for us that are the brains and of course we deserve better now you say what's this tie-in brother Paul a priest went by he has a good life that Levi went by had a good life we don't know what this man who was robbed on the side of the road what his life was but it obviously was beneath them in their mind and the Samaritans said I don't care your status I care for you right and that's the Gospel of Jesus Christ rich poor don't care about that care about you and your position has nothing to do with this position but it's our position and Jesus Christ amen and let us oh my I can just go on and on about this I'm sorry but the prophet of God just talking about how we should treat one another amen and he said that that sister and that Silk gown I think it was you know she's over here hugging the sister and The Gingham and the brother in The Tuxedo the fine suit is over here with his arms wrapped around a brother in the overalls their connection is brother nothing to do with the position in that but our position in Jesus Christ amen amen that's the testimony that we're going to leave on the Jericho Road that we love one another and we love the Lord and we will do what we can to help it and I was going back to this and you say well we we need to try and help everybody we come across we have to find a balance my brother and sister the leadership of the Holy Ghost because you'll find that Jesus passed many of multitudes at the pool of Bethesda and touched one life how do we explain that because in the multitudes the word of God shows us a small number is willing to receive eternal life now I heard it by a minister this way in closing if you offer eternal life to everyone they're going to say I want it when you show them the price tag very few say I'm willing to pay but I can't pay and you can't pay when we say I'm willing to pay we're actually giving our Lord Jesus Christ permission to pay our debt for us isn't that wonderful and I can give you a natural side of that it wasn't me it was actually the church but many years ago there was a need and we went to help this family pay this need and the company wouldn't receive money from us they said you have to have their permission to pay their debt and that's always struck with me our lord Jesus didn't come along and say I'm going to redeem you whether you like it or not he come and anointed us to come to a place that we'd say Lord if you could just pay my debt I can't pay it it's too large I need you we're giving him permission and I I close with this sister vika please I close with this right here the prophet of God showed us clearly that the Holy Spirit was a gentleman he doesn't Force anything but may we have the spirit of the Samaritan in our journey on the Jericho Road anoint us Lord day by day to know when and where and how then we'll know who our neighbor is not because we have revelation of our neighbor but because God revealed to us amen I have part two and three already in my brain here but I'll just stop right here at this thought this all come down to Saints the leadership of the Holy Spirit I've given money to people through the years only to see them spend it in every way but what they promised to spend it [Music] I have given money to people and had them come years later and say thank you it made such a difference in our life [Music] how come I didn't know the difference [Music] I couldn't have told you which one would have been responsible I don't want to give up on giving but we come to a a place where we realize just as Jesus weave this way through all the multitudes at the pool and stopped one man Lord I need that kind of divine leadership in my life I need that kind of leadership to know what to do when and where and how because you see the road to Jericho from Jerusalem it's quite a few miles there's mountains there's goalies and ravines brush and it's hot and it's dry and we get weary on that road to Jericho but it was a road it wasn't a dead end to the Wilderness it was a road there's a reason God called us on that road and there's a reason we're traveling the road so there must be a reason we're supposed to be there Lord help us on this road to Jericho Hallelujah God bless you tonight Saints I know this is a little bit different I felt different even as I studied it but I felt like I needed to share this amen because you see my brother and sister we're gonna pass a lot of people on the Jericho Road and God wants you to help some and some he just wants you to pray for and move on just like the prophet of God said you need that discernment of the Holy Spirit we're over here praying for someone that's in a condition and we're trying to pray off something God has put on their life and all we're doing is confusing the plan of God Lord give us wisdom on how to deal with those we meet on the Jericho Road a man let's stand and just sing a song or two before we're dismissed tonight amen [Music] [Music] let's just go ahead and sing that amen go and let God let go and let God have his wonderful let go and let God have his way your Sorrows will vanish your night turn today and let God have his way let's sing it again [Music] his wonderful way let go and let God have his way oh your Sorrows will vanish your night turn today let go and let God have his way 41 brother Gideon amen hallelujah [Music] to be like Jesus to be like Jesus [Music] on Earth oh my Lord [Music] oh [Music] from Earth to Glory I only have to be let's sing it again to be like Jesus Lord our prayer to be like Jesus [Music] on Earth to be like him from [Music] Earth to Glory [Music] I only have to be like in 119 brother Gideon amen Hallelujah aren't you glad tonight we can stand make this declaration it's not just a song it's a testimony I am redeemed I've been born again you know my brother and sister God never called us here to see us fail Satan's the one that throws this whole picture up and says now your failure you're a failure we need to go and ask God's opinion I think we're just like job I think God's over here and told the devil they're not going to deny me you can't come from and you can't take their life because they got eternal life so you'll never get that from them amen hallelujah [Music] thank God he justified me and of his fullness I will received of him oh I'm a brand new creation I'm a brand new man all things are passed away I've been born again more than a conqueror that's what I am I'm a new creation I'm a brand

found some Stripes I've healed oh I have found strength for my weakness to cover all my sins oh it's in Jesus Oh in Jesus it's in Jesus he's the one he's a rock salvation a firm foundation it's in
