[38:21] this problem and a child maybe that's
[38:24] discouraged
[38:25] and you start to look at that and you
[38:27] just forget
[38:28] all the promise
[38:31] EarthBound
[38:34] Earthbound we are not Johnny Crow
[38:37] amen
[38:38] the chain has been broken
[38:41] we've been set free been given the
[38:45] opportunity to fly in the heavenlies
[38:47] amen
[38:49] Hallelujah
[38:52] this morning we just want to
[38:55] just start off my uh
[38:58] just reminding I thought it was
[39:00] interesting with Adam Sister Sarah are
[39:02] home from hunting and others I've heard
[39:05] the Call of the Wild and they are gone
[39:08] to the mountains and so we're thankful
[39:10] for those that are back and just
[39:13] remember those that are hunting or at
[39:16] communions already been announced I want
[39:19] to preach on the thought or idea this
[39:22] morning of absolute faith in the word
[39:25] now I think it's interesting this last
[39:27] song cover me when my faith is gone but
[39:31] you realize my brother and sister
[39:32] there's no conflict in these statements
[39:35] to say that we have an absolute faith in
[39:37] the word because when we look into the
[39:39] human element
[39:41] we think we have no faith
[39:45] but I'm telling you I think you'll say
[39:48] Amen to this this morning when you get
[39:50] right down in the midst of your battle
[39:52] and your struggle and your
[39:54] discouragement
[39:56] and you hear a song
[39:59] you hear the word preached
[40:01] you read the word
[40:04] and something inside of you
[40:07] says huh
[40:10] devil
[40:11] I don't know why I was just listening to
[40:13] you
[40:14] but I do have faith I am
[40:18] a son or daughter of God
[40:21] and the devil says whoa that's not how
[40:23] the dialogue's supposed to go
[40:25] but remember this is the guy
[40:28] that was given his position
[40:31] by God
[40:34] he did not inherit this position
[40:37] he got to serve in that position at
[40:40] God's Liberty
[40:42] and then God says you know what
[40:45] you proved you can't be trusted
[40:48] did you just catch that
[40:51] it's been proved he can't be trusted
[40:55] and he got kicked out
[40:57] now I hope just hold that little thought
[40:59] in the back corner of your mind because
[41:01] you see today by God's grace we'll just
[41:04] touch on this in such a way to see how
[41:06] slippery the devil is because he's come
[41:08] and asserted even so far God said I'll
[41:11] let you make a claim on this Earth is it
[41:14] being your Earth
[41:16] I'll let you make a claim that this is
[41:19] all yours
[41:22] but God's going to come one day and once
[41:25] again remind the devil
[41:27] Mr Lucifer
[41:29] the guy in The Tuxedo you know
[41:31] devils are kind of grungy evil spirits
[41:34] are kind of grungy but Mr Lucifer used
[41:37] to walk freely into the courts of God
[41:40] walked freely in God's presence
[41:43] and was expelled forever
[41:47] man kicked out
[41:51] I'm gonna get ahead of myself but I want
[41:52] to just make this point right now
[41:56] go study the message you'll see where
[41:57] brother branham's talking about how that
[41:59] they chip away the diamonds found in the
[42:02] Kimberly mine he specifically says and
[42:05] they chip that away but they don't take
[42:07] those chips and throw them away they
[42:09] actually use them for other purposes
[42:15] and then he proceeds to say just as it
[42:17] was
[42:18] on the statue of Moses and being struck
[42:22] did you know that could never be
[42:24] duplicated
[42:25] you could take a statue like that carved
[42:28] out of stone and strike it a thousand
[42:31] times and never produce the exact chip
[42:34] that came off of that
[42:37] as it was in that time and the prophet
[42:39] proceeds to say and we were as a chip
[42:43] taken from our savior
[42:46] amen unique
[42:48] and useful and every bit as much God
[42:52] Amen as the original
[42:57] oh come on let that soak in every bit as
[43:01] much God as the original
[43:05] I was reading a deal here recently and
[43:07] they were saying you know the problem I
[43:09] wasn't talking about the message but
[43:10] they said the problem with these people
[43:12] is they think there is gods
[43:15] and I thought they're closer to the
[43:17] truth than you'll ever know
[43:19] because you see we come from him and we
[43:22] go back to him God didn't go down to the
[43:25] great Wallgreens of Heaven
[43:29] and find you on a Shelf
[43:33] you'll come from him
[43:37] I don't know of saints it got me excited
[43:40] when I read that
[43:41] because I thought you know what the
[43:44] truth of it is is the devil is trying to
[43:46] put his brand on everything
[43:49] but Mr Lucifer's already been evicted
[43:52] once and if you are a part of God and I
[43:55] am a part of God we have the authority
[43:58] to evict him
[43:59] amen we don't have to wait till the
[44:01] white Throne judgment we don't have to
[44:03] wait till the millennial season we don't
[44:05] have to wait all these times we can
[44:07] simply go back and say hey wait
[44:09] he's already been evicted
[44:12] thank you Lord
[44:15] I'll preach that again in a few minutes
[44:17] amen look now Saints I want to get
[44:20] started here look now we find strength
[44:23] in absolute Faith right the scripture
[44:25] tells us that a double-minded man is
[44:27] unstable and in all of his ways wavering
[44:30] to and fro being tossed around by the
[44:32] winds and so we want to find a strength
[44:35] and an absolute faith and it's there in
[44:37] that position of strength is when we can
[44:40] take the word of God and we look at the
[44:42] word and we can say you know what this
[44:44] this is who I am I'm looking at the word
[44:47] and it's not the the prophet of God
[44:49] telling us this is you it's not somebody
[44:51] else telling you it's you it's you
[44:54] yourself the great mystery and we'll
[44:56] talk on the mystery today the great
[44:58] mystery my brother and sister is seeing
[45:01] yourself in Christ
[45:03] when you see yourself in Christ you come
[45:06] and say well where do you belong I
[45:09] belong in him amen it's not I'm a member
[45:12] of a church or I follow a message you
[45:14] know I received an email here a few days
[45:17] ago uh and it was quite interesting
[45:19] because they're saying that I'm lying by
[45:21] Omission because I don't preach the
[45:23] dirty uh you know behind the scenes
[45:26] stuff of the message and you know these
[45:28] things you know as it would be and
[45:30] they're saying you know that you're
[45:31] deceiving the People by Omission but my
[45:34] brother and sister I will stand this
[45:36] morning maybe sound overconfident of
[45:38] everything that I have preached I can
[45:40] take back to the word of God Amen I'm
[45:43] not taking it back to as it would be in
[45:45] their terms like a dirty word the
[45:47] message I'm taking it back to the word
[45:50] of God because we have heard a voice and
[45:54] that voice was not come follow a group
[45:56] this voice was come follow me amen and
[46:00] it was not a voice of a man but it was
[46:02] the voice of almighty God God saying I
[46:05] have given you opportunity to come back
[46:07] into your original state and step into a
[46:11] position that was reserved for you
[46:13] before the foundation of the world now
[46:17] some people say what at the foundation
[46:19] of the world and from the foundation
[46:20] I'll just quote the prophet he said it
[46:22] was before amen so we look at that and
[46:25] realize that we being in the mind of God
[46:27] we're a part of the great plan so look
[46:30] my brother and sister we're going to
[46:32] find strength in an absolute Faith
[46:34] unwavering in the word of God in our
[46:37] hour see this bride can we say Amen this
[46:40] bride is not double-minded she's not a
[46:43] Believer today and an unbeliever
[46:45] tomorrow and then things don't go well
[46:47] and you need something to happen in your
[46:49] life so you come back and be a believer
[46:51] again so you don't feel guilty asking
[46:54] God for something no my brother and
[46:55] sister I believe this word this word has
[46:58] become our very life amen as this song
[47:01] says I've Got My Mind Made Up oh I'll
[47:04] tell you my brother and sister if we're
[47:06] not in a position this morning of being
[47:09] able to lift a hand and say I've Got My
[47:11] Mind Made Up then I encourage you to
[47:14] find a place of prayer find a place of
[47:17] complete surrender get down before God
[47:20] don't beg him like a beggar but come and
[47:22] say Lord your word says and I want to
[47:25] believe every single syllable of your
[47:29] word
[47:30] I don't want to have one thing you know
[47:32] one time I had a man uh talking and he
[47:35] kind of well he went ahead and went a
[47:36] different direction but he was there
[47:38] going you know there's some things that
[47:39] brother Branham preached that I just
[47:41] have a hard time agreeing with boy I'll
[47:44] tell you what I had so many alarm Bells
[47:46] going off now I can tell you this
[47:48] morning there's things brother Branham
[47:49] preached that I don't understand
[47:53] but I will never go as far as to say I
[47:55] don't agree with
[48:05] did you know in the process of beating
[48:07] the dross out of gold
[48:09] you lose a certain portion of the gold
[48:13] but that gold is not lost forever
[48:15] because they take it back and run it
[48:17] through the fire one more time
[48:20] now if there be any dross In Me Lord
[48:23] amen I know by the promise of your word
[48:25] you will not cast me away
[48:27] but you will take me back to the fire
[48:30] again
[48:31] and when I come from that losing that
[48:34] dross losing that besetting sin losing
[48:37] that distraction then God will come and
[48:40] he doesn't always hold me separate from
[48:42] that original goal he comes and he
[48:45] unites me back again
[48:47] won't lose the one
[48:50] Hallelujah
[48:52] Hallelujah let's have absolute faith in
[48:54] the word today amen let's just stand as
[48:57] we go into the word now look today
[48:59] Saints Paul's letter to the Colossians
[49:01] was not only for them
[49:03] you realize that as we read this and and
[49:06] you'll come and see how I'll directly
[49:08] tie this it's not me uh pardon me for
[49:10] putting it that way but directly tie
[49:12] this but you see uh Paul's letter uh to
[49:15] the Colossians was a letter that uh was
[49:19] to them in that day it was something
[49:20] that it was necessary to be preached and
[49:23] and uh bring correction and admonishment
[49:26] and encouragement to them but it was
[49:28] also a letter to the ages and we look at
[49:31] this and realize that God so chose my
[49:33] brother and sister not by accident
[49:36] you know God don't never has an accident
[49:39] you know we just had an employee did a
[49:42] little something and tore some stuff up
[49:45] and uh I wasn't real happy about it I
[49:48] mean after all I get whatever's left
[49:50] over at the end of the year
[49:54] and one of the other men that's working
[49:55] with us in the Harvest was quick
[49:59] quit to step in there
[50:03] as I was admonishing my employee this
[50:05] man was quick to step in there Paul
[50:08] it was an accident
[50:15] and I followed I said that's right
[50:19] this man wouldn't have just went out and
[50:22] done this just to tear things up
[50:25] it was an accident
[50:27] aren't you glad there's Grace
[50:31] oh my but our God Don't Make accidents
[50:34] he doesn't have accidents he isn't the
[50:36] author of accident
[50:37] he's intentional
[50:39] he's directional and he is faithful amen
[50:43] and so what this does is set the stage
[50:45] for us to have a place to come back to
[50:48] Anchor our soul
[50:50] because how would you anchor your soul
[50:51] on a shifting Target
[50:54] God was very legal today I've got to be
[50:56] very legal he's very gracious tomorrow
[51:00] oh I can live under grace but the day
[51:02] following you're back legal again and so
[51:04] you look back on yesterday and say man I
[51:06] was sure liberal under the grace
[51:09] I've got to go back and drive this back
[51:11] into legalism no God's consistent
[51:15] every day
[51:17] full of grace
[51:19] but full of expectation of a bride that
[51:21] will take the word
[51:22] so as he's there
[51:25] this letter to the church Through the
[51:27] Ages is seemingly by name to the church
[51:29] in our day allowed to see an agent the
[51:32] spirit of this age and Colossians 2.
[51:36] he said for I would that you knew what
[51:38] great conflict I have
[51:40] for you
[51:41] and for them
[51:43] at laodicea
[51:46] and for as many has have not seen my
[51:49] face in the flesh that their hearts
[51:51] might be comforted being knit together
[51:54] in Doctrine
[52:01] I believe in Doctrine
[52:04] I strongly believe in Doctrine
[52:07] amen but we can have all kinds of
[52:10] Doctrine and no love
[52:14] man what kind of family what kind of
[52:16] church what right
[52:19] um
[52:22] knit together in love and into all
[52:24] Riches of the full assurance
[52:27] come on Saints this scripture is so full
[52:30] it is so full my brother and sister that
[52:32] it's just oozing out of it
[52:34] unto the riches so full Assurance has a
[52:37] richness to it and the riches of full
[52:40] Assurance of understanding to the
[52:43] acknowledgment of the mystery of God and
[52:46] of the father and of Christ and in whom
[52:49] are HID all the treasures of wisdom and
[52:51] knowledge and this I say lest any man
[52:54] should beguile you with enticing words
[52:57] for though I be absent in the flesh yet
[52:59] am I with you in the spirit join and
[53:02] beholding your order and the
[53:04] steadfastness of your faith in Christ so
[53:08] he's declaring that you are steadfast in
[53:10] your faith even though there's times we
[53:12] feel weak we don't feel like we do but
[53:15] the truth of it is the word of God is
[53:17] declaring you are steadfast I think I'm
[53:20] going to believe the word over sir
[53:22] Lucifer
[53:24] and as you have therefore received
[53:26] Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him
[53:28] rooted
[53:30] and built up in him and established in
[53:34] the faith as ye have been taught
[53:35] abounding therein with Thanksgiving
[53:41] can I ask you a question
[53:43] how many got up this morning
[53:46] thank the Lord amen
[53:48] amen amen I don't say that as
[53:49] condemnation
[53:52] I don't say that as to make anyone feel
[53:55] bad
[53:57] but let's anchor that Amen in our life
[54:02] you know how we use this through the
[54:04] years
[54:05] well forgive me today
[54:07] I got up
[54:08] on the wrong side of the bed
[54:14] when did that ever have anything to do
[54:15] with life
[54:18] when did that have anything to do with
[54:20] us getting up and saying thank you for
[54:23] your word today hope
[54:24] thank you for life
[54:26] thank you for Revelation thank you for
[54:29] the Holy Ghost
[54:31] I remember a comment a man-made one day
[54:33] he says yeah I really agree with that
[54:35] phrase he said the problem is is the
[54:37] other side of my bed is a wall
[54:40] and maybe he would be have a right to be
[54:42] upset if he got up and hit his face off
[54:43] that wall over there no it's just a
[54:45] flimsy excuse Saints
[54:47] flimsy flimsy flimsy excuse
[54:51] what do we want to do is be giving
[54:54] Thanksgiving abounding therein with
[54:56] Thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil
[54:59] you through philosophy and vain deceit
[55:02] after the tradition of men after the
[55:05] rudiments of the world and not after
[55:08] Christ now lest I would jump on sorry to
[55:12] keep you standing but lest I would jump
[55:13] on and forget this little thought I want
[55:15] insert it here after the rudiments of
[55:19] the world
[55:22] brother Brandon Prince God of this evil
[55:24] age
[55:25] this is his world
[55:27] so when you're talking about the
[55:29] rudiments
[55:30] of the world
[55:32] you're talking about
[55:34] after
[55:35] the root
[55:37] Foundation Direction
[55:40] teaching
[55:43] corruption laodicea
[55:46] this world
[55:48] which belongs
[55:50] to Lucifer
[55:53] now I'm referring to him today because
[55:55] you see he was the prince
[55:59] that had access
[56:01] to the presence of God we'll give him
[56:04] enough respect of his office
[56:06] a prince
[56:08] who couldn't be happy being a prince
[56:11] and says I'm going to be king
[56:13] I'm going to rule over
[56:15] The Works of the most high
[56:18] I'm going to shove him out I'm going to
[56:19] have a coup
[56:21] and God says cool all you want
[56:24] cuckoo cuckoo
[56:26] won't do you any good
[56:31] after the rudiments of the world not
[56:32] after Christ for him to all the fullness
[56:34] of the godhead bodily and ye
[56:37] hmm I got so excited my office isn't
[56:40] very big at home but I managed to make a
[56:42] lap around it
[56:43] and ye are complete in him which is the
[56:48] head of all principality and power amen
[56:51] Heavenly Father we just asked for the
[56:53] blessing on the word today Lord help me
[56:55] be concise in your name we pray amen you
[56:58] may be seated Saints
[57:03] now as I was studying as it were for you
[57:06] might say something to preach on now it
[57:08] doesn't that doesn't quite sound right
[57:10] right but sometimes you can have a whole
[57:12] of something and you just don't know how
[57:14] to deal with it you don't know what to
[57:15] do with it but the Lord is faithful to
[57:18] come down and to open our eyes and give
[57:20] us a direction and so we look at this my
[57:23] brother and sister going back to verse 8
[57:25] beware lest any man spoil you you
[57:27] through philosophy and vain deceit after
[57:29] the tradition of men after the rudiments
[57:32] of the world and not after Christ for in
[57:35] him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[57:37] godhead bodily now look
[57:40] if you do not understand godhead
[57:43] you will struggle with the revelations
[57:46] is this your note
[57:49] well praise the Lord you mind if I read
[57:51] it
[57:53] you will struggle my brother and sister
[57:57] with the things of God what we would
[57:59] call the message of the hour you will
[58:01] struggle with that if you don't
[58:03] understand the godhead because you will
[58:06] have a conflict on where to place the
[58:09] authority at the time well you know what
[58:11] today we're going to just make sure that
[58:13] you get that settled once and for all
[58:15] now that is just anchored you see the
[58:18] problem we have is many of us had too
[58:21] much denominational uh spirits and talk
[58:24] teaching and tradition injected into the
[58:27] early days of the message amen because
[58:30] you see there was a season that there
[58:32] was a people that were called out and as
[58:34] they left Egypt my brother and sister
[58:36] they was all kinds the scripture calls
[58:39] it a mixed multitude and so the message
[58:41] had a mixed multitude and many of them
[58:44] thought the Lutheran Church really was
[58:46] anchored and so they brought a little
[58:48] bit of Lutheranism with them and they
[58:50] brought a little bit of the Baptist
[58:51] church and they brought a little bit of
[58:53] the Catholic church because these were
[58:55] things that were rooted in them and
[58:57] maybe help them or benefited them at one
[58:59] time in their life and so they drag
[59:01] those things over and teach those things
[59:04] as though they were message
[59:06] now my brother and sister I'll just tell
[59:08] you when uh uh uh the brother I can't
[59:12] even think of his name right now it was
[59:13] right there and it's gone but um started
[59:16] working on the message search and then
[59:17] they they uh uh
[59:20] what's that brother's name
[59:23] Neil havela
[59:25] when brother Neil had a revelation which
[59:27] wasn't really totally his Revelation
[59:28] there were others that were talking
[59:30] about this but he was the one that
[59:31] managed to grasp a lot of things and
[59:33] kind of get it together and you know I
[59:36] was raised up I just want to insert this
[59:37] to you so you can realize how these
[59:40] Spirits or Traditions can affect you and
[59:42] so sister Jerry and I not just I but
[59:44] sister Jerry and I as we started doing
[59:47] that we finally uh was able to uh get a
[59:50] a
[59:51] a version as it were of the eagle search
[59:54] program back then and there was things
[59:56] that we had been taught and God was
[59:59] starting to deal with us and there was
[1:00:01] things that we just didn't uh feel
[1:00:03] comfortable with uh things that were
[1:00:05] preached and the way the church was ran
[1:00:07] back in those days and we started
[1:00:09] searching these things out and back in
[1:00:12] those days you had to be very very
[1:00:13] precise in your wording because it it
[1:00:16] was a very concise deal that just it had
[1:00:19] to just fit in there you had to have it
[1:00:20] right but you know when things that you
[1:00:22] were taught and heard from the pulpit
[1:00:24] week after week year after year and you
[1:00:27] cannot find them in the message now as
[1:00:30] Time come on and that's been refined and
[1:00:32] is much easier to use and do that my
[1:00:35] brother and sister every once in a while
[1:00:36] I have just been like oh I remember that
[1:00:39] and once again almost like a reminder
[1:00:41] you type that in you search that it's
[1:00:44] nowhere to be found what is this this is
[1:00:47] a taking of a man Spirit denomination
[1:00:51] tradition and and injecting it in
[1:00:53] because they believed it and because
[1:00:55] they believed it so strongly surely the
[1:00:57] prophet spoke on it
[1:00:59] but that's not how it works we're not
[1:01:00] looking for something that was surely
[1:01:02] preached on we're looking for the word
[1:01:06] amen we are a word people amen so you
[1:01:10] look at this now I want to come back to
[1:01:12] verse 9 really drive this home for in
[1:01:14] him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[1:01:17] godhead bottling amen so is there
[1:01:20] anything in the revealed word that's
[1:01:22] outside of him
[1:01:24] he's the fullness
[1:01:26] right
[1:01:28] I want to drive this home he is the
[1:01:31] fullness
[1:01:33] there's nothing else outside of him
[1:01:37] and then the word says and ye
[1:01:41] are complete
[1:01:43] in him
[1:01:45] so if he is all the word
[1:01:48] everything of creation and everything of
[1:01:52] the mind and of the spirit of God and ye
[1:01:55] are complete in him now my brother and
[1:01:58] sister that means that what is in him is
[1:02:01] in you you were taken from that it was
[1:02:03] poured out as the scripture says so now
[1:02:06] I want you to see this if you are
[1:02:08] complete in him you will find that we
[1:02:11] could take a position and say well then
[1:02:14] we need nothing else
[1:02:17] but you see God has a program
[1:02:19] God says you know what I have all the
[1:02:21] word you have access to all the word but
[1:02:24] do you understand it
[1:02:26] so God comes and through the preaching
[1:02:28] of the word through a work of a prophet
[1:02:30] the prophets of the ages the apostles he
[1:02:33] puts this all together you might say
[1:02:35] collectively and lines this all out and
[1:02:37] my brother and sister now I'm not
[1:02:39] talking about any other culture or any
[1:02:41] other writing talking about English you
[1:02:43] don't want to be like Paul sometimes you
[1:02:46] know Sister Jerry will be reading a book
[1:02:47] I don't really care about what her book
[1:02:49] is I just want to know what the ending
[1:02:51] is and you can find that in the last
[1:02:52] seven pages
[1:02:55] but you don't know the story
[1:03:00] you just know they survived the airplane
[1:03:02] accident
[1:03:03] and lived happily ever after
[1:03:09] we need the whole book
[1:03:13] you can read the end of Revelation
[1:03:16] and see oh Lord come quickly and we can
[1:03:20] say Amen to Lord come quickly but my
[1:03:23] brother and sister that will not hold
[1:03:25] you in this day you need to be rooted
[1:03:28] and grounded you need to be anchored my
[1:03:31] brother and sister to come to the place
[1:03:33] that you literally will have the faith
[1:03:36] the strength the understanding to that
[1:03:38] day to say Lord come quickly because to
[1:03:40] the unbeliever they're not wanting the
[1:03:42] Lord to come quickly if they have any
[1:03:44] grasp and realize I'm not living it I
[1:03:47] never really desire to live it and
[1:03:49] there's coming a judgment day you want
[1:03:50] that delayed as long as possible it's
[1:03:52] only the True Believer are you with me
[1:03:55] only the True Believer that is standing
[1:03:59] there saying Lord come quickly the
[1:04:01] governments of this world don't want him
[1:04:02] to come quickly they're in their Heyday
[1:04:05] controlling billions of people they're
[1:04:07] in their Heyday that a bureaucrat now
[1:04:10] nobody even knows his name moving people
[1:04:12] in Nations like a chessboard and so they
[1:04:15] don't want nothing to change it's only
[1:04:18] the True Believer who's standing here
[1:04:20] today from the very depths of their
[1:04:21] heart my brother and sister the prophet
[1:04:23] preached it years ago we won't get into
[1:04:25] it because certainly there's some large
[1:04:27] churches being built in the message and
[1:04:29] I'm not derogatory of that but look at
[1:04:31] this the prophet of God says now if they
[1:04:33] believe the Lord is coming tomorrow why
[1:04:35] are they building these multi-million
[1:04:38] dollar Mansions when there's
[1:04:40] missionaries on the ground in Africa and
[1:04:42] these other countries don't even have
[1:04:44] shoes and barely enough food
[1:04:46] and big churches being built right
[1:04:49] exactly they're not looking for the Lord
[1:04:51] to come quickly
[1:04:52] no they were buying back in the day that
[1:04:54] brother Branham was speaking that the
[1:04:56] churches with their excess money were
[1:04:58] buying billions and billions in
[1:05:00] municipal bonds and things like that
[1:05:02] that were earning good interest to
[1:05:04] secure their future
[1:05:08] oh but brother Paul brother Brian said
[1:05:11] keep planting your potatoes yes he did
[1:05:13] he sure did
[1:05:16] hmm
[1:05:17] I don't want to get sidetracked this
[1:05:19] morning
[1:05:20] just read some really interesting things
[1:05:22] this week but
[1:05:23] so now look
[1:05:25] we are complete in him which is the head
[1:05:27] of all principality and power so I can
[1:05:29] say this morning my brother and sister
[1:05:31] all principality and power is in me
[1:05:34] some people say you would be taking too
[1:05:36] much upon yourself no I wouldn't
[1:05:39] I am in him he is in me I am ahead of
[1:05:43] all principality and power now it might
[1:05:46] only be the Little Kingdom that we call
[1:05:47] Paul
[1:05:50] nobody out there is gonna listen
[1:05:58] have I got that drilled down
[1:06:01] okay because to take this next step
[1:06:03] you have to be able to have that
[1:06:05] anchored amen
[1:06:07] did you know
[1:06:09] the word says
[1:06:11] that the fullness
[1:06:13] of the mystery
[1:06:15] of Christ would be revealed in this day
[1:06:17] amen right amen oh now so we can clearly
[1:06:21] see brother Paul that this meant this
[1:06:23] and this meant that and that goes right
[1:06:24] there and here's Jesus Christ and we see
[1:06:27] him for Heath but if you are only in
[1:06:29] that position you are missing part of
[1:06:31] the mystery and part of the mystery is
[1:06:34] sitting right here this morning this is
[1:06:36] a part of the very mystery of God that
[1:06:39] had never been revealed before and
[1:06:42] people say what are you talking about
[1:06:43] there's bride from every age but there's
[1:06:46] never been a bride from laodicea on the
[1:06:49] earth before and she's here now and this
[1:06:52] is the final voice to the final age
[1:06:55] sitting here today taking the word in
[1:06:58] and not just sitting on the word but the
[1:07:00] words alive and she's speaking it and
[1:07:03] she's living it she's declaring it and
[1:07:05] she's letting her life be conformed to
[1:07:08] that
[1:07:09] oh there's a hard part my brother and
[1:07:11] sister
[1:07:12] oh
[1:07:17] reminds me it was almost like a joke
[1:07:19] years ago
[1:07:20] man was chosen had an important position
[1:07:23] was chosen as employee of the year for a
[1:07:26] company
[1:07:28] and they give them all these Awards and
[1:07:30] vacation for his family and and uh uh uh
[1:07:35] certificates of deposit his reward all
[1:07:37] this stuff to do this and then they're
[1:07:40] interviewing him afterwards and they
[1:07:42] said so what did you do
[1:07:44] what did you do to be the employee of
[1:07:47] the year and the man not even thinking
[1:07:49] he said I just ignored all the company's
[1:07:51] rules and did it my way
[1:07:55] you think he ever won that award again
[1:07:57] I doubt if they come back and ask for
[1:07:59] the CDs and the vacation and the gold
[1:08:01] watch and everything back
[1:08:03] I can guarantee you he never won
[1:08:05] employee of the year ever again
[1:08:08] see in his mind
[1:08:10] he was greater than the sum of all that
[1:08:12] had been invested before him
[1:08:15] he didn't invest the millions he didn't
[1:08:17] make the company he didn't make the
[1:08:19] product it was just yes obviously he had
[1:08:21] good ideas and he had things but to come
[1:08:24] with an arrogance
[1:08:26] this is a point I want to drive home to
[1:08:28] come with an arrogance
[1:08:30] saying I know better than God
[1:08:35] if God would just run this church or run
[1:08:37] his message like I would have it'd be a
[1:08:40] much better message
[1:08:42] that is the height of arrogance
[1:08:45] the height my brother of ignoring all
[1:08:49] the investment
[1:08:50] of our Lord Jesus Christ before us
[1:08:53] we are apart
[1:08:55] and this part
[1:08:57] of laodicea could not have been revealed
[1:09:00] in Philadelphia
[1:09:01] it could not have gone back I I think it
[1:09:04] would have been so interesting
[1:09:06] to have seen
[1:09:08] the apostles awoke
[1:09:11] it would have been interesting to have
[1:09:14] actually been literally been there to
[1:09:16] watch the effect of Paul's preaching
[1:09:18] upon the people
[1:09:28] but I'm a part you're a part of this
[1:09:30] mystery amen not that mystery
[1:09:33] this mystery
[1:09:35] you're a part of the word that come to
[1:09:36] life in this day
[1:09:39] now my brother and sister we can do all
[1:09:41] kinds of wishings you know we hear
[1:09:42] people I wished I'd been born in the old
[1:09:44] west not me
[1:09:46] not me me and horses don't get along
[1:09:49] and uh I wouldn't want to I wouldn't
[1:09:51] want to have to go back
[1:09:53] but you see my brother and sister don't
[1:09:55] let men place it somewhere else or on
[1:09:57] someone else right the word says you're
[1:10:00] complete ye are complete in him amen so
[1:10:03] some would want to present it in a
[1:10:05] different light they would be there I'm
[1:10:07] telling you my brother and sister I know
[1:10:08] I come across like a broken record at
[1:10:11] pushing back against it but the spirit
[1:10:13] is strong the spirit is persuasive and
[1:10:16] people are like if brother Branham was
[1:10:17] here and they Veil that my brother and
[1:10:19] sister if brother Branham was here
[1:10:21] because they really want to say brother
[1:10:23] branham's coming back he's going to come
[1:10:25] back and he's going to finish and fix
[1:10:27] all the mistakes that God made before
[1:10:32] no no no no no no no
[1:10:34] no no no no no no no no no the word says
[1:10:37] that you
[1:10:39] Can someone say me because me is to you
[1:10:42] you is the me
[1:10:43] I will be the final voice with my
[1:10:47] messenger in that day now some people
[1:10:50] say yeah that just proves that brother
[1:10:51] Brown's going to be there no sir it's
[1:10:53] this preached this word that's been
[1:10:55] opened up this word that's been preached
[1:10:58] there's where the Prophet will come in
[1:10:59] he's not going to come and walk the
[1:11:01] streets and preach the coliseums and do
[1:11:04] all of this again my brother and sister
[1:11:05] no type in scripture for that so people
[1:11:08] are trying to point back to another day
[1:11:10] point to a different day point to a
[1:11:13] different solution point to a different
[1:11:14] way to make this happen
[1:11:20] so they have to present it in a
[1:11:22] different light
[1:11:24] they preach it as though you need
[1:11:28] something else
[1:11:30] and I say Amen to that
[1:11:33] I need more of God
[1:11:36] that's something that breaks Church
[1:11:38] Traditions that breaks the whole thing
[1:11:40] we're not going to go into Rapture
[1:11:41] because we attend a certain church with
[1:11:44] a certain pastor and we have
[1:11:45] acknowledged this or friendships or
[1:11:47] whatever my brother and sister we will
[1:11:49] go in a Rapture because we are complete
[1:11:53] in him amen not because we are still
[1:11:56] just trying or we hope but complete in
[1:12:00] him that doesn't Place anyone else in
[1:12:02] this equation
[1:12:04] there's there's no way it doesn't say
[1:12:06] you're complete in him Jesus Christ Plus
[1:12:09] naysayers of this message say that's
[1:12:11] what William Branham preached he
[1:12:13] preached that you need uh Jesus Christ
[1:12:16] plus William Branham and that just shows
[1:12:19] you the lying spirit that is on them no
[1:12:21] understanding no Revelation they are
[1:12:24] thinking that we are following the man
[1:12:26] like they followed the man and they got
[1:12:28] discouraged of the man and left the man
[1:12:30] but my brother and sister are we the
[1:12:32] bride of Christ can we say that we the
[1:12:35] bride of Christ are complete in him
[1:12:39] Jesus Christ we're not looking for a
[1:12:42] plus another Edition another deal but
[1:12:45] we're complete in him
[1:12:47] amen and that's a revelation they'll
[1:12:49] never get because they've never come to
[1:12:51] the place to be complete in him they
[1:12:53] never believed and trusted and
[1:12:55] surrendered and give a full gift of
[1:12:58] their life
[1:13:03] reminds me of a brother one time said
[1:13:05] well you know we'll never fully
[1:13:08] understand this to understand the word
[1:13:10] of God unless we go learn
[1:13:13] Greek and Arabic
[1:13:19] wow
[1:13:24] now some of you
[1:13:28] want to make this point
[1:13:30] some of you have a greater grasp
[1:13:35] I won't even embarrass anybody by saying
[1:13:38] what but
[1:13:39] some of you speak several languages
[1:13:45] I'm still working on English
[1:13:49] now if my spiritual state
[1:13:51] is dependent on me
[1:13:54] learning Greek
[1:13:55] and Aramaic
[1:13:58] I'm toast
[1:14:04] but God said huh I'll hide it from the
[1:14:06] wise and prudent now don't take that as
[1:14:08] knowing several languages is a bad deal
[1:14:11] hide it from the wise and prudent and
[1:14:13] I'll reveal it
[1:14:15] over here to these babies
[1:14:20] and when you take that that's even kind
[1:14:22] of interesting because Sammy speaks more
[1:14:24] languages than I do
[1:14:29] but that's not what he was talking about
[1:14:32] babes in Christ
[1:14:36] think about this now
[1:14:38] a babe not in their bad days in their
[1:14:41] good days
[1:14:43] when Mom or Dad say that's hot
[1:14:47] they don't go run down to the hardware
[1:14:49] store
[1:14:51] and get an industrial thermometer
[1:14:54] and stick it on there
[1:14:57] oh you're right Mom
[1:14:59] this would burn me
[1:15:02] they sure fire away I remember
[1:15:05] one time
[1:15:07] it was a grandchild
[1:15:10] and the daughter was saw our little son
[1:15:12] going over to the wood stove to put his
[1:15:14] hand on the wood stove and she's
[1:15:15] hurrying to get over there and her own
[1:15:17] mother
[1:15:19] said stop
[1:15:22] in the meantime the little kid
[1:15:25] whoa
[1:15:27] she says now you'll never have to tell
[1:15:29] him again
[1:15:31] seems cruel
[1:15:33] that you realize that's what God has
[1:15:36] allowed to happen in your life exactly
[1:15:37] right you realize that time after time
[1:15:40] the word of God has says don't don't
[1:15:43] don't don't don't don't
[1:15:49] are we all kind of regardless of nation
[1:15:51] Kindred tongue kind of the same aren't
[1:15:54] we sure
[1:15:55] don't do that
[1:15:57] something
[1:15:58] inside of us
[1:16:00] what are they keeping us from
[1:16:04] mom doesn't want me to put my hand on
[1:16:05] the wood stove mom's hiding something
[1:16:07] from me
[1:16:09] so what's God do
[1:16:11] he lets us
[1:16:12] learn the lesson
[1:16:18] oh
[1:16:21] you don't love your child you let them
[1:16:23] burn themselves no I love them a lot
[1:16:25] amen but I won't always be there to tell
[1:16:29] them don't
[1:16:31] and though God is omniscient omnipresent
[1:16:34] God is not going to follow you around
[1:16:36] whispering in your ear don't don't don't
[1:16:39] don't don't don't
[1:16:41] God wants you to grow up be a mature
[1:16:43] Christian where you look at that and say
[1:16:45] you know what I don't want nothing of
[1:16:47] the rudiments of the world I want those
[1:16:50] things that are of Christ I want those
[1:16:52] things that are of his word and so what
[1:16:55] does God let us do he lets us go out and
[1:16:57] get a taste as it were of the rudiments
[1:16:59] of the world and then we are their
[1:17:01] heartbroken Lord forgive me for what I
[1:17:03] said what I'd done what I looked at
[1:17:05] whatever it might be and we come my
[1:17:07] brother and sister and maybe the first
[1:17:09] time we touch it wasn't sufficient but
[1:17:12] God says I'll let you touch it again
[1:17:13] I'll let you be there again and I'm
[1:17:15] going to let it not be just me preaching
[1:17:18] at you but it will be by your own
[1:17:20] experience that you will touch the
[1:17:21] rudiments of the world and once again
[1:17:23] say Lord forgive me I don't want no part
[1:17:25] of this Slayer to see in world I want
[1:17:28] you Lord
[1:17:29] and then
[1:17:31] we start to come to the place that the
[1:17:33] devil throws it out and it looks so good
[1:17:36] and we just kind of do a litmus test is
[1:17:39] this of God
[1:17:40] or is this of the world
[1:17:44] and you become allergic
[1:17:47] to the world
[1:17:48] amen
[1:17:51] you know I worked with a man once I hope
[1:17:53] you can catch the point I'm making here
[1:17:54] I worked with a man once who had been a
[1:17:56] drunk alcoholic ruined his family
[1:17:58] just messed his whole life up
[1:18:01] finally got so low that he he finally
[1:18:03] admitted I'm alcoholic and he went to a
[1:18:06] different deal and never worked he just
[1:18:08] couldn't find a deal that worked so then
[1:18:10] somebody told him he says well you know
[1:18:11] this is a start of a new medical thing
[1:18:13] that they have here and so literally
[1:18:15] goes into an AAA type of a atmosphere to
[1:18:19] get over being alcoholic and the first
[1:18:21] three or four days this place has a bar
[1:18:25] whoever heard of a recovery place from
[1:18:27] alcohol law alcohol
[1:18:29] uh that has a bar and they said you're
[1:18:33] welcome to the bar and he goes in there
[1:18:34] oh my he was lost for four days straight
[1:18:37] but he went in there on the fifth day
[1:18:40] and he poured him some whatever it was
[1:18:42] and he drank it and then just a little
[1:18:44] bit he got sick
[1:18:46] and he was like oh man I must be
[1:18:48] catching a bug or whatever so they go
[1:18:50] through this whole pretense of taking
[1:18:52] him down setting him in the little
[1:18:53] doctor's office say check him out no
[1:18:54] you're fine he goes back that afternoon
[1:18:56] he's going to have him another drink
[1:18:58] drinks a little alcohol gets even more
[1:19:00] violently sick
[1:19:03] until he says now here I am dry
[1:19:07] for 10 years
[1:19:09] and if somebody opens any kind of
[1:19:11] alcohol or I can smell I'm like
[1:19:16] oh
[1:19:18] and he says Hey when the program's over
[1:19:20] admit it
[1:19:22] what they did to me
[1:19:24] when I wasn't looking they look oh he
[1:19:26] goes for this every time he goes in
[1:19:28] there he goes for this they despite that
[1:19:30] with some kind of drug that causes
[1:19:32] nausea and what it was is it put that
[1:19:34] and anchored such I hope you guys got
[1:19:36] your spiritual caps on anchored
[1:19:38] something so deep in him that 10 years
[1:19:42] later the smell of that causes his body
[1:19:46] to react
[1:19:47] and I'm telling you that's what God's
[1:19:49] doing to this bride in this day oh he's
[1:19:52] not making us super Christians he's
[1:19:55] allowing us to come to the place that we
[1:19:58] recognize the thing that blesses my life
[1:20:00] can you name what blesses your life
[1:20:02] today the thing that blesses my life I
[1:20:05] love and the thing of the rudiments of
[1:20:07] the world cause me to have a reaction
[1:20:11] that's not who I am
[1:20:13] oh Lord forgive me I looked I taste I
[1:20:16] heard I whatever Lord forgive me and
[1:20:19] then the word of God builds us up lifts
[1:20:22] us up takes and raises our spirit up
[1:20:24] into Heavenly places and God says this
[1:20:26] is what I'm doing I'm going to train you
[1:20:28] because you see I'm not going to take
[1:20:31] and change you
[1:20:35] I'm going against some of the culture we
[1:20:37] preach
[1:20:39] I'm not going to change you
[1:20:42] I'm going to reveal who you already are
[1:20:46] people are looking I'm looking for a
[1:20:49] change to get rid of this this sin and
[1:20:51] this is know what God's going to do is
[1:20:54] reveal to you who you already are
[1:20:58] God didn't speak you from the foundation
[1:21:01] of the world and then say well I'm going
[1:21:03] to send you to laodicea send you here
[1:21:06] and then when you get there I'll change
[1:21:07] you no sir he said I sent you there and
[1:21:11] when you get there I'm gonna reveal who
[1:21:14] you are
[1:21:17] and people are like I'm looking for the
[1:21:19] Lord to change me no I'm looking for
[1:21:21] Revelation amen because Revelation shows
[1:21:24] me who I am amen now look at this my
[1:21:28] brother and sister I gotta hurry along
[1:21:30] here restoration of the Bride tree
[1:21:33] I like this
[1:21:34] after Easter his raising he said go into
[1:21:37] all the world and I'm going to go with
[1:21:39] you
[1:21:40] as a living father has sent me and he's
[1:21:42] in me so I send you and will be in you
[1:21:47] now my brother and sister I'm telling
[1:21:49] you their Spirits moving in the land
[1:21:52] that refuse to be identified in this
[1:21:55] fashion
[1:21:58] and you say how
[1:22:03] how can they refuse to be identified in
[1:22:05] this fashion
[1:22:07] because they have no revelation of the
[1:22:10] godhead that's right
[1:22:11] amen
[1:22:13] they come out of religions they had God
[1:22:16] divided up diced up
[1:22:18] and they never fully rejected that
[1:22:21] they've never fully left that behind
[1:22:24] so they still got God in heaven
[1:22:28] Jesus Christ
[1:22:30] and the Holy Spirit
[1:22:33] and they got them occupying their place
[1:22:38] and they can't reconcile
[1:22:41] God in them amen that's right oh they
[1:22:44] can understand Christ
[1:22:46] because the scripture says it
[1:22:48] Christ in you
[1:22:50] but they can't see God in you
[1:22:52] and they will tell you you're wrong and
[1:22:54] you don't understand the godhead
[1:22:56] well I'm telling you I don't know a
[1:22:58] whole lot
[1:22:59] but I don't think that God allowed his
[1:23:01] prophet to go on and preach the modified
[1:23:06] 3.1 version
[1:23:08] of the trinity
[1:23:12] I'm with you to the end of the world the
[1:23:14] works the same that I've done to prove
[1:23:17] that I was you'll do the same things to
[1:23:19] prove that you are
[1:23:22] now can we just take a moment this
[1:23:24] morning and just lock in on this
[1:23:28] are we proving this morning yes sir amen
[1:23:33] or was that just for the prophet no
[1:23:38] no mamas
[1:23:40] you got every right to lay this hand on
[1:23:42] your child Amen in the name of Jesus
[1:23:45] Christ
[1:23:46] and expect a full Deliverance of the
[1:23:50] promise
[1:23:52] no we don't have to run
[1:23:55] call the pastor
[1:23:56] you got to drive across town pray for my
[1:23:59] kid that's got a fever no sir sister you
[1:24:02] will prove that it is God himself in you
[1:24:09] all we have to do is have the confidence
[1:24:11] oh wait man our flesh just a second
[1:24:14] brother Paul you were doing fine until
[1:24:16] we got to the point
[1:24:18] I'm gonna as I said preach a little
[1:24:19] counter to our normal verb this morning
[1:24:22] you have to have confidence in this
[1:24:24] flesh
[1:24:26] that's hard one for some of you to
[1:24:28] swallow
[1:24:29] might be hard for the preachers to
[1:24:31] swallow this morning
[1:24:33] you have to have confidence in this
[1:24:34] flesh because you see when this flesh
[1:24:37] has been fully surrendered to Christ
[1:24:43] it's no longer you
[1:24:45] but Christ in you
[1:24:49] see there's some boundaries we've got to
[1:24:51] break we've got some we've got some
[1:24:53] things that we have come up to a point
[1:24:54] we bump against that and we don't go no
[1:24:56] further I'm telling you I have
[1:24:58] confidence in this flesh
[1:25:00] as long as Christ is at the helm
[1:25:03] Filled from tip to toe
[1:25:06] I have confidence in this flesh this
[1:25:08] will manifest who I am
[1:25:11] oh does this flesh fail yes but you see
[1:25:14] my brother and sister we're not looking
[1:25:16] at the Flesh in that realm we're looking
[1:25:18] at the residence of almighty God we're
[1:25:22] looking at a place he says I will never
[1:25:24] leave you nor forsake you do you realize
[1:25:26] that on good days that means he's with
[1:25:28] you and on bad days he's with you and on
[1:25:32] sunny days he's with you and days that
[1:25:34] you are sick or you've come across a
[1:25:36] horrible accident on the highway he's
[1:25:38] with you
[1:25:40] when you're at work and a boss is
[1:25:42] persecuting you he's with you
[1:25:45] right
[1:25:46] amen yeah
[1:25:48] and if you don't have that flesh to the
[1:25:50] place that you can bring it back subject
[1:25:54] then you need to find a place and say
[1:25:55] Lord
[1:25:56] please work on my flesh
[1:25:59] oh but he said he'd be in you
[1:26:02] do we believe the word
[1:26:05] come on Saints don't get quiet on me do
[1:26:07] we believe the word or not
[1:26:09] I had a temper tantrum do you believe
[1:26:12] the word or not
[1:26:16] you're going to come to the place no
[1:26:18] these are not being preached to give us
[1:26:19] an excuse to have a tantrum
[1:26:22] but it's a recognition that we are
[1:26:24] coming closer and closer to a full
[1:26:26] submission to the word of God and that
[1:26:29] false Omission is what brings on a
[1:26:31] Rapture my brother and sister it's not
[1:26:33] how much Revelation that we have of the
[1:26:36] message explaining all of the things of
[1:26:39] the message so perfectly that's not
[1:26:41] going to take you into Revelation it's
[1:26:43] going to be as we started this scripture
[1:26:45] love
[1:26:47] now look I'm gonna throw another one can
[1:26:48] I throw another curveball at you the
[1:26:50] problem we have as as Christians as we
[1:26:53] say oh I love the word
[1:26:56] but did you know that we love the word
[1:26:58] under a filial anointing that's right
[1:27:05] and you know what loving the word under
[1:27:07] Ophelia anointing produces
[1:27:10] the same feeling you get
[1:27:13] from reading a good book
[1:27:18] I've read some really good books in my
[1:27:19] life books that I went back and have
[1:27:21] read probably a half a dozen times
[1:27:26] yes like that book like the story you
[1:27:29] like the way it unfolds
[1:27:31] filio love for a book
[1:27:34] now you say brother Paul I don't know if
[1:27:36] that's a real thing because filio is not
[1:27:37] really a material kind of thing but you
[1:27:39] understand what I'm saying
[1:27:42] but when we have an agape love
[1:27:45] for the word of God
[1:27:47] 's own love for his word you realize God
[1:27:50] loves his word
[1:27:52] an Agape God love a Godly love for the
[1:27:55] word my brother and sister you look at
[1:27:57] the Bible entirely different it becomes
[1:28:00] a brand new book to us because we no
[1:28:03] longer read it as it were history or
[1:28:06] reading it as do and don't we don't read
[1:28:09] it as an explanation we read it because
[1:28:11] there's something coming the prophet of
[1:28:13] God there's some says something comes
[1:28:15] off that page to you
[1:28:20] oh God let let our reading the book be
[1:28:23] that
[1:28:24] amen so I prove that I was you'll do the
[1:28:26] same thing to prove that you are I like
[1:28:28] that these signs shall follow them that
[1:28:30] are believers not make believers
[1:28:34] but Believers see these things that I do
[1:28:38] you'll do it and vindicate that you're a
[1:28:40] Believer come on I I hope you're with me
[1:28:43] this morning and I hope I'm not coming
[1:28:44] across too strongly but my brother and
[1:28:46] sister you want to prove
[1:28:48] to yourself
[1:28:50] Mr Lucifer and this world out here
[1:28:54] be a believer
[1:28:57] not a make-believer
[1:28:58] if God says it say Lord give me the
[1:29:02] strength the wisdom to live that
[1:29:05] and you know sometimes that is really
[1:29:08] hard
[1:29:09] because
[1:29:11] it starts cutting away on the flesh
[1:29:14] and we don't like that
[1:29:16] just like we don't like abrasive
[1:29:17] preachers we don't like the word to be
[1:29:20] too abrasive either y'all going to
[1:29:22] heaven now
[1:29:24] we're going to pass the offering played
[1:29:26] another time
[1:29:27] pay for your Passage
[1:29:31] God bless you all have a good day today
[1:29:33] get in around the gulf while the
[1:29:35] weather's still good
[1:29:36] I heard a preacher online say that to
[1:29:38] his congregation here recently
[1:29:42] Monday get in a good round of golf this
[1:29:44] afternoon
[1:29:46] well praise the Lord
[1:29:52] these things you'll do what will you do
[1:29:54] not by a manufactured life
[1:29:58] but organic just coming out of you will
[1:30:02] prove that you're a Believer the same
[1:30:04] works that I've done because the living
[1:30:06] father lives in me it ain't me that
[1:30:07] doeth the work it's my father and it
[1:30:09] won't be you doing the works it would be
[1:30:12] me in you doing the works see now you go
[1:30:16] into all the world Amen and look at this
[1:30:19] I just love this I hope this quote
[1:30:21] affects you like it did me amen did I go
[1:30:24] too far
[1:30:25] nope okay
[1:30:28] otherwise you're going to to uh to form
[1:30:31] what's known to me okay otherwise you're
[1:30:34] going to form what's known to me as a
[1:30:37] bride see all right I'll go with you and
[1:30:40] I you will be
[1:30:45] chip
[1:30:49] not just not just take this figurative
[1:30:51] take this with a spiritual thought let
[1:30:53] my brother and sister are not just math
[1:30:55] they got converted to Christianity
[1:30:58] no sir
[1:30:59] I am literally a part of my Lord Jesus
[1:31:03] Christ
[1:31:04] not something intellectual in the mind
[1:31:07] not something that Satan can come and
[1:31:10] argue with you my brother and sister
[1:31:11] don't you love DNA it's such an
[1:31:13] incredible thing in the world of of
[1:31:15] crime and all this they solve these
[1:31:17] things by just even you know follow a
[1:31:19] man I just read a little article here
[1:31:21] sometime back they followed this man he
[1:31:24] was so careful to leave no Trace until
[1:31:26] one day he's walking in the park and
[1:31:28] throws away a soda cup
[1:31:32] they snatched that cup
[1:31:34] they get the DNA
[1:31:36] proves the crime that he did
[1:31:40] DNA it's incredible
[1:31:42] I'm a chip
[1:31:44] now if the chip is part of the original
[1:31:47] then every spiritual marker that was in
[1:31:51] the original
[1:31:52] is in you
[1:31:54] oh that ought to have us out of our seat
[1:31:56] saying thank you Lord I can no more be
[1:31:59] lost than our Lord Jesus Christ himself
[1:32:01] could be lost that God's word could fail
[1:32:04] I am him he is me
[1:32:08] Hallelujah I'm born of his bone I'm
[1:32:11] flesh of his flesh
[1:32:13] what does it do it takes all the fear
[1:32:15] takes all the fear I don't know if I can
[1:32:17] live I don't know if I can do I can do
[1:32:19] this my brother and sister I'm telling
[1:32:21] you what we got way too many preachers
[1:32:23] that are preaching along the line of
[1:32:26] those ten spies that went into the
[1:32:28] promised land they're preaching along
[1:32:30] that we got a good message we got all
[1:32:32] this but you know if you have a little
[1:32:34] sin I mean after all we're flesh we
[1:32:36] can't overcome these things no I'm
[1:32:38] telling you I'm a part of him and he was
[1:32:40] proven to be sin free he was proven to
[1:32:45] be the Overcomer and he learned
[1:32:47] obedience by suffering and I don't
[1:32:49] expect anything else than that I want to
[1:32:52] learn obedience leave a suffering out of
[1:32:55] the equation I want to learn obedience
[1:32:59] to your word Lord amen amen people look
[1:33:03] at the suffering part and say I'm
[1:33:05] checked out
[1:33:06] no no
[1:33:09] look at The Obedience part
[1:33:11] amen
[1:33:13] you be my bride that's me
[1:33:17] my life will be in your body
[1:33:20] this is just too deep for some people
[1:33:22] because you know they just get all oh
[1:33:24] that's this just like a husband and wife
[1:33:27] is one person you and I are going to be
[1:33:28] one and that day you'll know that I am
[1:33:31] in the Father the father and me and I in
[1:33:33] you and you in me what is it the chip
[1:33:36] coming back to its rightful position the
[1:33:39] prophet of God says no other chip could
[1:33:42] go back into the statue of Moses and fit
[1:33:45] in that place no other manufacturer chip
[1:33:48] could be a perfect piece but the
[1:33:50] original would go right back into its
[1:33:53] place you wouldn't have to modify it you
[1:33:55] wouldn't have to do anything to it it
[1:33:57] would go back but you don't want to put
[1:34:00] it back because if you put it back then
[1:34:02] everything we say oh yeah I just I was
[1:34:05] there that my problems it was God's
[1:34:08] problem
[1:34:09] now free moral agency still Reigns we
[1:34:12] still make decisions our part of this
[1:34:14] body we coming from Christ he sent it
[1:34:17] down look the body that we call Jesus
[1:34:19] Christ was sent to the Earth to be
[1:34:21] proved
[1:34:24] what brother Paul no the prophet said it
[1:34:29] that body
[1:34:30] called Jesus Christ that body was sent
[1:34:33] to the Earth
[1:34:35] to be proved
[1:34:39] this body
[1:34:41] a chip
[1:34:43] off the old block of my daddy
[1:34:46] was sent to this earth to be proved
[1:34:51] yes oh look at that
[1:34:54] father in me I and you you and me hmm I
[1:34:57] just love that Satan just gets so angry
[1:34:59] at that
[1:35:00] because you see if you ever realize that
[1:35:02] you're not you that you are Christ
[1:35:06] oh that's on the fringes of the message
[1:35:08] I know of saints
[1:35:10] because we've turned the message into
[1:35:12] just another denomination
[1:35:14] yeah right
[1:35:20] right
[1:35:21] are you falling over the edge Paul
[1:35:24] yeah I'm falling over the edge
[1:35:27] I fell right into Christ
[1:35:31] see the Oneness of God
[1:35:33] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:35:34] and all Christ was he poured in the
[1:35:36] church there you are makes them all one
[1:35:40] now
[1:35:43] help me
[1:35:44] a lot brighter people here today than I
[1:35:46] am
[1:35:47] help me if you have something
[1:35:50] on a line
[1:35:54] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:35:56] and all Christ was he poured into the
[1:35:59] church and there you are makes them all
[1:36:01] one
[1:36:03] doesn't that include us
[1:36:07] is that simple enough
[1:36:09] English mathematics
[1:36:15] we might have to
[1:36:17] develop a new language here
[1:36:20] you see my brother and sister it's not
[1:36:22] all that was there
[1:36:24] was one
[1:36:26] the word included you and I
[1:36:29] were one amen
[1:36:31] well that ain't what the devil's been
[1:36:33] telling you is it
[1:36:34] yeah you got a choice today
[1:36:36] believe the word of God a prophet's
[1:36:39] message
[1:36:41] maybe I'll just be bold and include
[1:36:43] myself in there
[1:36:44] believe the word of God believe a
[1:36:46] prophet's message believe brother Paul
[1:36:49] or
[1:36:51] don't believe any of it oh no no we're
[1:36:54] willing to believe a portion of it that
[1:36:56] all that was in God he poured into
[1:36:58] Christ and all that Christ poured into
[1:36:59] the church well what is the church it's
[1:37:01] not brick and mortar Saints we're the
[1:37:04] church

[1:37:15] are one
[1:37:17] okay here let me back up there you are
[1:37:19] makes them all one now look now the
[1:37:21] bride or one tree of life
[1:37:26] thank you
[1:37:28] did I just read what I just read
[1:37:30] that the bride
[1:37:33] well wait let's go back to the Garden
[1:37:35] what was the tree of life
[1:37:37] was it a bunch of people standing around
[1:37:41] no no no no it wasn't a bunch of people
[1:37:43] standing around wait it was
[1:37:46] in theophonic form
[1:37:49] representation let me put it that way
[1:37:54] in other words like husband and wife is
[1:37:56] one Christ and his bride
[1:38:01] amen can somebody say it for me
[1:38:05] Christ and his bride are one
[1:38:10] oh that breaks the myth my brother and
[1:38:12] sister that we're a bunch of nothing
[1:38:14] that we're saved at Calvary and became
[1:38:17] something we always were a part of him
[1:38:22] oh devil we're gonna break your mental
[1:38:25] conception of the word amen I always was
[1:38:29] you always was
[1:38:32] and no wonder the devil's coming what is
[1:38:34] he going to do my brother and sister is
[1:38:36] he going to drag you away to hell no
[1:38:39] he's going to deceive You by you not
[1:38:42] claiming the full promise of God
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:49] oh
[1:38:51] my oh my
[1:38:53] same thing same Spirit same Works same
[1:38:57] sign
[1:38:58] everything else
[1:39:00] for the works that I do shall you do
[1:39:03] also how long all the world how much to
[1:39:05] every creature is that right
[1:39:07] now look at that my brother and sister
[1:39:09] look here I need to hurry along
[1:39:12] my
[1:39:14] I'm going to replace all the clocks in
[1:39:15] this church with the slow ones
[1:39:20] got one amen out of that
[1:39:23] Genesis 2 15 and the Lord God took the
[1:39:27] man and put him into the Garden of Eden
[1:39:29] to dress it and keep it so God gave him
[1:39:31] a job these people have an idea that as
[1:39:33] a Christian you're going to just sit
[1:39:34] around and do nothing
[1:39:36] are deceived the very first man on the
[1:39:38] earth God gave him a job amen
[1:39:42] and the Lord God
[1:39:44] commanded the man saying of every tree
[1:39:47] of the garden thou mayest freely eat now
[1:39:50] we're going to stop right here Saints
[1:39:51] for just a moment
[1:39:54] you realize there was only
[1:39:56] one tree
[1:39:59] that we weren't supposed to eat from
[1:40:01] that's right
[1:40:03] and the Tree of Life stood in the midst
[1:40:05] of the garden
[1:40:07] God
[1:40:08] intended for Adam
[1:40:12] to dig into the word
[1:40:16] he intended Adam
[1:40:18] to be a partaker of the spirit and the
[1:40:22] life and the nature and all of those
[1:40:26] things were Representatives God he
[1:40:28] intended a creation with no sin
[1:40:32] a creation with no sin and God still
[1:40:36] wanted him sin completely absent
[1:40:39] from the garden
[1:40:42] but that's not entirely true because you
[1:40:44] see the serpent
[1:40:45] was given Liberty
[1:40:47] but if they had just eaten from the
[1:40:51] correct tree
[1:40:52] the certain serpent would have never had
[1:40:55] opportunity
[1:40:58] young people listen to me
[1:41:01] the impacts of your life will be
[1:41:03] determined by the music you choose
[1:41:06] to listen to amen right right the
[1:41:09] impacts of your life will be determined
[1:41:11] by the things you choose
[1:41:14] to watch
[1:41:15] people say oh my parents they raised me
[1:41:18] in a very strict Church
[1:41:21] yeah you know I mean I've just spent all
[1:41:22] your houses recently going through all
[1:41:24] of your videos and your books and
[1:41:27] you know right
[1:41:29] no come on dad well we're cutting off
[1:41:31] all the excuses there's nobody coming
[1:41:33] around here forcing you to do anything
[1:41:34] amen it'll be what you choose amen
[1:41:38] amen you choose to feed on the things
[1:41:41] of the rudiments of the world
[1:41:44] and it will produce the rudiments of the
[1:41:47] world you choose to feed on the tree of
[1:41:51] life
[1:41:52] it will produce the life of the tree
[1:41:56] which is Christ oh adults did I just
[1:42:00] throw this all down on the young people
[1:42:03] excuse me young people for throwing this
[1:42:05] down on you adults
[1:42:12] hope this doesn't hurt but adults as
[1:42:15] good Holy Ghost filled God-fearing
[1:42:17] people if you wouldn't eat on it
[1:42:18] yourself then won't sit in your house
[1:42:21] amen amen that's exactly
[1:42:24] or maybe we are feeding on it God
[1:42:26] forgive us open our eyes so we can see
[1:42:29] that this is actually detrimental to us
[1:42:32] amen these things are there because
[1:42:35] he commanded the man
[1:42:38] of every tree of the garden thou mayest
[1:42:41] freely eat but of the tree of the
[1:42:42] knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall
[1:42:45] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[1:42:46] eat us thereof you shall surely die amen
[1:42:51] now I'm telling you I say this a tad bit
[1:42:53] to be humorous
[1:42:55] I'm not very happy with Adam
[1:42:57] because his actions Eve's actions
[1:43:01] caused me to work by the sweat of my
[1:43:03] brow
[1:43:05] and at 60 years old I'm tired of working
[1:43:07] by the sweat of my brow
[1:43:09] I'd like something a little simpler
[1:43:14] but that's just one portion of the curse
[1:43:19] that portion of the curse
[1:43:21] we can deal with
[1:43:23] but how are we dealing with the rest of
[1:43:26] the curse
[1:43:28] how are we dealing with the rest of the
[1:43:32] curse
[1:43:34] now I'm not going to get done today here
[1:43:36] Saints so we'll just do what we can here
[1:43:38] for a few more minutes
[1:43:40] amen
[1:43:42] look in this
[1:43:44] Sons and Daughters of God can never be
[1:43:46] one with Lucifer
[1:43:47] right
[1:43:49] do you realize that Adam the minute he
[1:43:53] took
[1:43:53] partook of the
[1:43:55] tree of Good and Evil
[1:43:58] it made him sick
[1:44:03] spiritually sick
[1:44:06] he knew
[1:44:09] now when I ask a very direct question
[1:44:13] when we do some of the things that we do
[1:44:17] what is the reaction
[1:44:20] do we walk away from the Tree of Good
[1:44:23] and Evil
[1:44:25] saying that was good
[1:44:28] no we don't
[1:44:30] we walk away and sometimes it bothers us
[1:44:33] for days weeks months and if we haven't
[1:44:36] properly dealt with it years
[1:44:40] and God left it there so you'd become
[1:44:43] nauseated
[1:44:45] of the taste of that tree
[1:45:00] notice it was by his believers
[1:45:03] huh look at this Saints it's just so
[1:45:06] beautiful it's by his Believers that he
[1:45:08] proves his word by
[1:45:10] God can't prove his word by an
[1:45:11] unbelievable he can only prove his word
[1:45:14] not by unbelievers it's only by
[1:45:15] Believers that he can prove his word no
[1:45:17] matter how much the rest of him claimed
[1:45:19] to be oh I believe brother
[1:45:22] see if you do God will prove it so
[1:45:24] because we look and we see the others
[1:45:27] now it sounds judgmental doesn't it
[1:45:29] but I'm telling you if you go out in the
[1:45:31] backyard and I'm telling you hey how do
[1:45:34] you like my apple tree
[1:45:36] and all you see is a prickly pear
[1:45:42] go ahead pick the fruit eat it
[1:45:45] it'd be almost like saying I dare you
[1:45:51] no
[1:45:53] no my brother and sister
[1:45:56] it's the fruit
[1:45:58] it's the fruit
[1:46:00] oh no even as a pastor I'm not going to
[1:46:02] come here start going up and down the
[1:46:04] aisles what's their fruit what's their
[1:46:06] fruit what's their fruit I cannot
[1:46:08] control the fruit you choose to produce
[1:46:10] you want to produce indifference I can't
[1:46:14] stop you from producing indifference if
[1:46:17] you want to be filled with the Holy
[1:46:18] Ghost and say I want the very Life of
[1:46:20] Christ to come flowing out of me then I
[1:46:24] can't change that either because then I
[1:46:26] would be I would be in control
[1:46:28] not God
[1:46:30] and then it would no longer be that
[1:46:32] you're a chip off the block
[1:46:34] you'd be a chip off of the church block
[1:46:38] a man blocked somewhere
[1:46:40] no matter how much the rest of them
[1:46:41] claim to be oh I believe brother see if
[1:46:43] you do God will prove it so because we
[1:46:45] look and see the others how can we say
[1:46:46] then see it's by True Believers that he
[1:46:49] proves his word not by those who say
[1:46:52] they believe but those who really
[1:46:54] believe it's by his believing children
[1:46:57] that he proves his word now he had the
[1:47:00] Believers the old crop had died off
[1:47:02] talking about Israel the unbelievers who
[1:47:05] said we couldn't take it he let every
[1:47:07] one of them perish why every one of them
[1:47:10] but the Believers who is left Moses had
[1:47:13] been taken to glory and the unbelievers
[1:47:16] had perished in the wilderness and this
[1:47:18] was their children
[1:47:21] why was it there was something happened
[1:47:22] the old denominational Spirit come out
[1:47:25] of Egypt with the parents
[1:47:27] you know now to catch the full context
[1:47:29] here I'm just taking too much time but
[1:47:32] uh catch the full context this was the
[1:47:35] spirit that had took them to Egypt 400
[1:47:39] years before
[1:47:40] they never got away from it never got
[1:47:43] delivered from that Spirit 400 so it
[1:47:45] wasn't just a journey out of Egypt that
[1:47:48] they took the spirit with them they had
[1:47:50] passed it
[1:47:51] oh parents
[1:47:53] young people Church
[1:47:56] they passed
[1:47:58] this attitude to the promise of God
[1:48:03] parent
[1:48:04] to children
[1:48:06] becoming a parent
[1:48:08] to the children becoming a parent
[1:48:12] to the children
[1:48:15] what do you want to pass families
[1:48:18] to your children that's it
[1:48:21] pass something to them that will give
[1:48:23] him Deliverance in laodicea
[1:48:26] not tradition of who we are where we
[1:48:28] come from and what we know and who we
[1:48:30] know but pass to them a living God pass
[1:48:34] to them the Holy Ghost pass to them a
[1:48:37] revealed word that's alive amen
[1:48:41] you see they could have done that just
[1:48:43] as easy as passing down from generation
[1:48:46] to generation a question mark concerning
[1:48:49] God's word
[1:48:51] amen
[1:48:54] hopefully I didn't come across too
[1:48:56] strong there
[1:48:57] but maybe I could just drive the stake
[1:49:00] home that we'd recognize we are the ones
[1:49:02] you say oh if they're meant to be saved
[1:49:04] they'll be saved sure go ahead commit
[1:49:06] your children to 30 years of unbelief
[1:49:08] and unhappiness when you yourself could
[1:49:10] lay a foundation of belief in the word
[1:49:13] of God
[1:49:14] when you could lay down a foundation
[1:49:16] that God's word is true we are weak and
[1:49:19] we make mistakes don't look at your
[1:49:21] parents mistakes look at the word look
[1:49:23] at the promise look at the life that's
[1:49:25] there it's our life we can claim this
[1:49:28] life
[1:49:29] instead we go on and we just pass what
[1:49:32] was passed to us because in the flesh we
[1:49:35] know no different
[1:49:36] get out of the flesh
[1:49:38] amen live in the spirit of Christ live
[1:49:41] in the word pass life into your children
[1:49:48] oh excuse me kind of strident there
[1:49:50] sorry
[1:49:52] amen
[1:49:53] see he let every one of them perish
[1:49:55] every one of them but the Believers who
[1:49:56] has left
[1:49:58] comes down now what is it a whole new
[1:50:00] generation
[1:50:02] this is a generation Saints
[1:50:04] some people say well
[1:50:08] um
[1:50:09] the parents had to have done something
[1:50:10] right their children went into the
[1:50:13] Promised Land
[1:50:17] you know what happened
[1:50:21] now some people take this wrong
[1:50:24] I'm sorry if you take it wrong
[1:50:26] God raised up voices in their midst
[1:50:30] and anointed the children
[1:50:32] to listen
[1:50:34] to The Voice
[1:50:37] no one told the children this this will
[1:50:39] come a day
[1:50:40] that this voice will lead you in the
[1:50:42] promised land listen to the voice now
[1:50:44] God anointed them
[1:50:46] why are you and your family believers
[1:50:49] and other parts of your family not
[1:50:51] right you were anointed to hear a voice
[1:50:54] and that voice moved you in such a
[1:50:57] fashion it wasn't that we look back and
[1:50:59] say well praise God give credit to this
[1:51:01] man give credit to that man my brother
[1:51:03] and sister Joshua Jehovah God
[1:51:07] had a voice
[1:51:09] and it made a difference to the people
[1:51:11] and when the parents at kadish barnia
[1:51:13] could not raise up and say Amen let's go
[1:51:16] take the land that would have been
[1:51:17] children
[1:51:18] that were there saying now weren't we
[1:51:20] taught
[1:51:22] wasn't this scriptural
[1:51:26] wasn't this the word
[1:51:28] that's our land
[1:51:31] and I can see that
[1:51:33] forgive me I'm not meaning to imply but
[1:51:36] I can see children
[1:51:38] and their parents don't respond they're
[1:51:40] looking at them
[1:51:48] oh parents
[1:51:51] shed Egypt
[1:51:53] get rid of Egypt
[1:51:55] let the language
[1:51:57] of the Promised Land
[1:51:59] be spoken in your house
[1:52:02] let the language
[1:52:04] of the Promised Land
[1:52:06] become our language
[1:52:08] and it was those group
[1:52:11] now I'm not going to go into all of that
[1:52:14] but the prophet of God
[1:52:16] I might have included that quote let me
[1:52:18] just move on real quick
[1:52:20] Hallelujah I'm proving this word by
[1:52:22] knowledge
[1:52:24] proving his word
[1:52:26] yeah there are to the Cross door and
[1:52:29] that was Believers Joshua Caleb that was
[1:52:31] the Believers they was the ones crossed
[1:52:33] over it's the only way God could do it
[1:52:34] now when the prophet of God says there's
[1:52:36] only two Believers passed over you've
[1:52:38] got to understand that God was looking
[1:52:39] at a dispensational change
[1:52:41] he was not counting the young people
[1:52:43] into this they were following
[1:52:47] you understand that they were coming to
[1:52:51] maturity and look how God does this
[1:52:54] there come an age
[1:52:56] where God said everyone older than that
[1:52:58] dies in the wilderness
[1:53:00] and that was because they were then
[1:53:02] under the anointing of a previous
[1:53:04] Ministry
[1:53:05] but God says I'm going to give credit to
[1:53:07] these young people now
[1:53:09] I was arising up under another Ministry
[1:53:12] and that Ministry is Anointed
[1:53:15] to take them into the Promised Land
[1:53:18] I I tell you what my brother and sister
[1:53:20] this would be a harsh statement but I'm
[1:53:21] just going to say it you look and this
[1:53:23] does not apply like a blanket but you'll
[1:53:26] look
[1:53:27] a lot of those that were with the
[1:53:29] prophet
[1:53:30] went into return Ministry went into all
[1:53:33] kinds of other things
[1:53:35] that went off got sidetracked
[1:53:39] now that sounds harsh because there's
[1:53:41] people that are in those positions that
[1:53:43] I love dearly amen
[1:53:45] but you will not convince him
[1:53:48] you will not convince them
[1:53:51] and neither should we criticize them and
[1:53:53] it might come across like I do but I
[1:53:55] honestly my heart I'm not
[1:53:57] but you see there come a day
[1:54:00] this is the word they come a day and God
[1:54:02] said everyone a dividing line right down
[1:54:05] through the message
[1:54:09] those are going to perish in the
[1:54:10] wilderness
[1:54:12] these are going to occupy the promised
[1:54:15] man
[1:54:17] now God judged as individuals
[1:54:20] just as he judges us today as
[1:54:22] individuals
[1:54:23] because not all that say they are the
[1:54:25] message or the message that's right
[1:54:28] that's right so look at this let me get
[1:54:30] focused
[1:54:31] they was the Believers they was the one
[1:54:33] that crossed over it's the only way God
[1:54:35] can do it is by his believing children
[1:54:37] you believe that all right his Believers
[1:54:39] was the ones that done it he used them
[1:54:41] to cross over with now I want you to
[1:54:44] notice he does that uh way in every age
[1:54:47] this is why I can make this I have
[1:54:49] confidence to make the statement I just
[1:54:51] made because he does it in every age see
[1:54:53] now I want you to notice he does that
[1:54:55] way in every age he does it every time
[1:54:57] by the same method he has to take
[1:54:59] Believers then in order to have
[1:55:01] Believers to meet that word he's got to
[1:55:05] predestinate it to that age you see it
[1:55:09] he's got to prodestinate this thing to
[1:55:11] be there to meet the challenge of the
[1:55:14] age
[1:55:17] oh look at that
[1:55:21] oh my
[1:55:22] I don't think you guys are going to take
[1:55:24] me out the parking lot and thump on me
[1:55:25] or anything so I'm just going to say it
[1:55:28] this is why my brother and sister we
[1:55:30] look at this message entirely different
[1:55:32] than preceding Generations that's right
[1:55:37] that's hard words
[1:55:39] some of it might be our parents might be
[1:55:41] aunts and uncles and whatever it might
[1:55:43] be but my brother and sister you see
[1:55:46] what it is is God's got to take
[1:55:48] Believers to do this and so what did he
[1:55:51] do he predestinated us coming right
[1:55:54] together with the word and meeting right
[1:55:59] there
[1:56:02] and what is it
[1:56:03] the challenge of the age now this is an
[1:56:06] interesting statement because I don't
[1:56:08] believe these words are just accidental
[1:56:09] it doesn't say the promise of your day
[1:56:12] as in to say our day is different than
[1:56:14] any other day is let me tell you young
[1:56:16] people that while your challenge you
[1:56:19] face in this day right now is a
[1:56:21] different challenge in one sense of the
[1:56:24] circumstance and never dreamed when I
[1:56:26] was a kid I remember the first time in
[1:56:27] school introduced to a computer and
[1:56:29] we're like ah this will never catch on

[1:58:43] around check tires check straps I'm
[1:58:45] standing out there looking down on
[1:58:47] Detroit Lake
[1:58:48] and suddenly all my hair
[1:58:51] this is what I still had
[1:58:53] stood up
[1:58:55] and I just turned around I really
[1:58:58] expected like to see a human or
[1:58:59] something there

[2:00:24] to happen when he come over and
[2:00:26] predestinates anything to happen in his
[2:00:28] word he had to prove his word to be so
[2:00:31] and when he predestinates anything to
[2:00:34] happen and says it will happen he knows
[2:00:36] that seed will be there just at that
[2:00:39] time oh I feel so fortunate that I I got
[2:00:42] introduced to the message it changed my
[2:00:44] life no God ordained you to be

[2:01:23] oh my oh my what time is it here
[2:01:26] oh my
[2:01:28] look come on Sons and Daughters never be
[2:01:31] one with Lucifer the Satan devil
[2:01:34] whatever you want to call it no more
[2:01:35] than light and darkness can be in
[2:01:37] Fellowship
[2:01:38] amen
[2:01:40] only be
[2:01:42] one
[2:01:44] with the one
[2:01:46] they came out of
[2:01:51] when you think about that think how
[2:01:52] rough Jesus was when he says you
[2:01:55] are of your father the devil
[2:01:59] that wasn't somebody whose theology was
[2:02:01] just a little messed up
[2:02:03] not someone who was the chip
[2:02:06] off of another spiritual DNA amen oh do
[2:02:10] we have one time for one very lengthy
[2:02:13] quote
[2:02:15] can we
[2:02:16] okay
[2:02:32] I skipped over some really good stuff
[2:02:33] there
[2:02:35] so the Bible is the complete revelation
[2:02:37] of Jesus Christ
[2:02:42] would somebody give me permission to
[2:02:44] just go ahead and insert a little
[2:02:45] thought yeah
[2:02:48] if the Bible is the complete revelation
[2:02:51] of Jesus Christ
[2:02:54] and we're a chip off of him
[2:02:58] then the Bible is a complete revelation
[2:03:01] of you amen
[2:03:05] no one else no other Spirit no other
[2:03:09] words no other influence should Define
[2:03:11] who we are because the Bible is now the
[2:03:15] complete revelation of the bride of
[2:03:19] Christ
[2:03:21] oh my brother and sister it's not some
[2:03:24] other Doctrine it's not some other
[2:03:26] ideology it's not some other Revelation
[2:03:28] it's the word
[2:03:30] it's the word
[2:03:32] amen it was wrote by the prophets
[2:03:34] Hebrews 1 1 and God uh who ends hundred
[2:03:37] times spoke to the followers by the
[2:03:39] prophets in this last day speaks to us
[2:03:41] through his son Jesus Christ which was
[2:03:43] the prophets all of them put together
[2:03:45] Jesus oh you know what
[2:03:48] we have a problem Houston
[2:03:51] because there's more Christ revealed in
[2:03:54] his own word than that one let's start
[2:03:56] over I could preach that a second time
[2:03:58] okay
[2:03:59] let us just read in a while we got time
[2:04:01] I believe I haven't got too many notes
[2:04:03] here to speak from if the Lord tarries
[2:04:05] why we'll try to get from them it
[2:04:08] doesn't take much notes does it the
[2:04:10] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[2:04:12] gave to him to show to his servants the
[2:04:14] things but shortly come to pass and he
[2:04:16] sent and signified it by his Angel to
[2:04:18] his servant John who bear record of the
[2:04:20] word of God and the testimony of Jesus
[2:04:23] Christ and of all things that he saw
[2:04:27] can I step out on the limb how well can
[2:04:30] brother Paul balance on this limb
[2:04:34] all things that jaw saw
[2:04:38] a prophet goes beyond the curtain of
[2:04:40] time
[2:04:42] and he's there
[2:04:44] and he shares with us his experiences
[2:04:48] and he comes back
[2:04:50] and he shares that and people are like
[2:04:52] that's witchcraft
[2:04:57] the prophet says you know I had a vision
[2:04:59] might have been a dream but I believe
[2:05:00] it's a vision
[2:05:02] and I heard the music Onward Christian
[2:05:04] Soldier and here come
[2:05:06] this church
[2:05:08] Swank it along sorry to damage your eyes
[2:05:13] and the prophet's heart just starts to
[2:05:15] cry out
[2:05:17] Lord is this all
[2:05:20] my Ministry
[2:05:22] accomplished
[2:05:29] but then he hears the sweet music Onward
[2:05:32] Christian Soldier
[2:05:37] you think Music Matters
[2:05:43] and here she come
[2:05:46] and here is the prophet says
[2:05:48] the bride from every nation
[2:05:51] dressed in their National
[2:05:55] costume costumes the clothes
[2:06:02] I'm getting all kinds of just
[2:06:05] inputs here that I just don't know what
[2:06:07] to do
[2:06:09] have you noticed God's granted me the
[2:06:11] opportunity to travel quite a bit
[2:06:15] there they are Marching to Onward
[2:06:18] Christian soldier in their
[2:06:22] Nation
[2:06:24] their clothes
[2:06:26] their
[2:06:28] and they're walking along
[2:06:30] marching I should say
[2:06:33] of course we see the prophet of God
[2:06:36] so skip back in line you know they got
[2:06:39] out of Step
[2:06:41] he's monishing them to get back in the
[2:06:43] correct step
[2:06:45] don't go watching that laodicean church
[2:06:47] don't go watching everything else just
[2:06:49] stay with the word
[2:06:54] okay let me go back here for a second
[2:06:57] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[2:06:59] gave to him to show to his servants
[2:07:01] things which must shortly come to pass
[2:07:03] and he sent it signified by his Angel to
[2:07:06] the servant John
[2:07:08] who bear record of the word of God and
[2:07:10] the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[2:07:13] things that he saw
[2:07:15] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[2:07:18] hear the word of this prophecy and keep
[2:07:20] the things which are written therein for
[2:07:22] the time
[2:07:24] is at hand
[2:07:35] he looked
[2:07:36] at the bride amen
[2:07:41] he saw you once walking
[2:07:43] he saw you in step
[2:07:46] he saw you by the word
[2:07:50] not by our flesh
[2:07:52] but what was our flesh doing
[2:07:54] getting out of Step
[2:07:56] and he didn't say you don't belong in
[2:07:57] the bride know what he do he admonished
[2:08:00] that Pride
[2:08:01] just get back in Step just get back in
[2:08:04] line everything will be all right
[2:08:07] oh God help us today Saints
[2:08:10] God help us today
[2:08:12] to realize the day the hour the
[2:08:16] atmosphere that we're in
[2:08:18] oh Hallelujah you know
[2:08:29] I want to drop back
[2:08:31] or just a moment
[2:08:33] so the Bible
[2:08:35] is the complete revelation of Jesus
[2:08:37] Christ amen
[2:08:39] the Bible these are my words is a
[2:08:41] complete revelation of the bride of
[2:08:44] Christ
[2:08:45] she's in him she's of him
[2:08:48] and these These are kind of Taken not
[2:08:52] verbatim from Brother Branham but in
[2:08:54] context of the idea
[2:08:56] as Eve was of Adam
[2:08:59] the bride is of the word
[2:09:02] now remember my brother and sister that
[2:09:04] Eve come out of Adam
[2:09:08] are you back to it
[2:09:10] she was a chip off of him amen
[2:09:13] this Bride is a chip off the word
[2:09:16] and the word of God's God in written
[2:09:19] form right
[2:09:20] so
[2:09:22] if
[2:09:24] the brides of the word and the word is
[2:09:25] of God
[2:09:27] then we are
[2:09:29] the word
[2:09:31] period you've heard this preach it's
[2:09:33] nothing new but ye are the word period
[2:09:40] because this is the age
[2:09:43] of the full revelation
[2:09:46] of Jesus Christ
[2:09:49] amen they will have to remember sing the
[2:09:52] song as we close the service today here
[2:09:55] comes the bride amen because my brother
[2:09:58] and sister this is the full revelation
[2:10:00] of Jesus Christ in the way he chose to
[2:10:03] reveal it
[2:10:04] not my concept not your concept
[2:10:07] oh my
[2:10:09] well Hallelujah
[2:10:11] can I admit that I lied to you and read
[2:10:13] one more quote
[2:10:16] that's right you're gonna like this one
[2:10:18] you're going to like this one
[2:10:23] a little story and then I'm closing
[2:10:28] I hope you like that sorry that it kept
[2:10:30] you here about 45 minutes plus
[2:10:33] there's a home Christian home and there
[2:10:35] was hey I told this to uh told this to
[2:10:38] this critic and in this home there was
[2:10:41] they believed in God they had a little
[2:10:42] boy there and he was scared to death in
[2:10:45] a storm lightning oh he was just scared
[2:10:47] to death and he would run under the
[2:10:49] tables anywhere when it would like when
[2:10:51] it was lightning so one night come a big
[2:10:53] storm out on the farm and where they
[2:10:55] lived and the trees was a blowing
[2:10:57] enlightening flashing getting late in
[2:10:59] the night and the mother said to junior
[2:11:00] said well now Junior you go upstairs and
[2:11:04] go to bed
[2:11:05] said now don't be scared go on up there
[2:11:09] amen so little Junior with his pajamas
[2:11:12] on went up the steps looking back
[2:11:15] about half crying we all know what it's
[2:11:17] talking about there we've done it
[2:11:19] he laid down and tried to go to sleep
[2:11:21] covered up his head he couldn't go to
[2:11:23] sleep that lightning flashing around the
[2:11:24] window so he said oh mama
[2:11:27] come up here and sleep with me well she
[2:11:31] said Junior nothing's going to bother
[2:11:32] you mothers you know how that would be
[2:11:35] that lightning can't hurt you he said
[2:11:37] but Mama come up here and sleep with me
[2:11:39] I used to have nightmares when I was a
[2:11:41] little kid I can remember many a time
[2:11:43] that my mama
[2:11:45] would come
[2:11:46] and lay down on the bunk bed with me
[2:11:49] and probably knowing that my mama was
[2:11:51] right there
[2:11:53] I fell asleep
[2:11:54] instantly
[2:11:57] and she would go climb back in bed
[2:12:00] I would sleep out the night
[2:12:02] there was some confidence
[2:12:05] that's it so the mother went up the
[2:12:07] steps laid across the bed with her
[2:12:09] Junior and she said Junior my little son
[2:12:12] mother wants to tell you something
[2:12:15] she said Junior we are a Christian
[2:12:17] family we believe in God can we say Amen
[2:12:19] to that we believe that God protects Us
[2:12:21] in storms we believe that and we believe
[2:12:23] that God takes care of his own and I
[2:12:25] want you to believe that Junior
[2:12:28] not don't be scared God is with us and
[2:12:31] he'll protect us
[2:12:33] Junior snubbed a few times
[2:12:36] mama
[2:12:38] I believe that too
[2:12:40] but when that lightning is so close to
[2:12:42] the window
[2:12:43] I like the feel
[2:12:45] the god that's got skin on it
[2:12:49] Hallelujah
[2:12:51] I tell you what I like to worship
[2:12:54] yes sir I like to live life and enjoy
[2:12:56] life with God Amen it's got skin on it
[2:12:59] sister Emmy would you come
[2:13:01] Hallelujah Saints what is this this is
[2:13:04] not
[2:13:05] a Doctrine for us to believe
[2:13:09] this
[2:13:10] is us being chosen of almighty God
[2:13:15] to be the very proof
[2:13:17] that he is here
[2:13:19] oh brother Paul are you saying Doctrine
[2:13:22] don't matter
[2:13:24] no what I'm saying is is
[2:13:28] the chip off
[2:13:30] of that
[2:13:32] can only produce
[2:13:34] that
[2:13:36] yeah
[2:13:38] the other side of predestination that
[2:13:40] makes me so happy
[2:13:42] God chose me
[2:13:45] to be him
[2:13:47] he chose me to be identified
[2:13:50] Mrs Jesus Christ he chose us Saints to
[2:13:55] express
[2:13:56] himself to this world
[2:14:00] you know I'm working on shortening my
[2:14:03] sermons because I cut this one in about
[2:14:04] half before I ever left the house
[2:14:07] it's not that we glory in preaching so
[2:14:10] much
[2:14:12] there's just so much to preach
[2:14:14] there is so much to share
[2:14:18] Hallelujah
[2:14:19] absolute Faith In The God Who took you
[2:14:23] from himself
[2:14:26] isn't that beautiful
[2:14:27] I want to dispel this idea that we were
[2:14:30] just out here and God chose to save us
[2:14:33] no sir
[2:14:34] God chose to make us
[2:14:37] to draw his us from his very being
[2:14:40] to place the very DNA of what a real
[2:14:44] Christian is in US
[2:14:47] from the beginning
[2:14:48] Hallelujah let's just rise sing a song

[2:22:56] you rubbing your tummies I heard
[2:22:58] somebody's stomach growl it might have
[2:23:00] possibly been mine
[2:23:02] but I'm telling you I just get so
[2:23:04] excited
[2:23:05] amen I don't think it's a natural
[2:23:08] excitement because be honest with you
[2:23:10] Saints it's not meaning for anybody to
[2:23:11] feel sorry but I'm so tired right now
[2:23:13] all I can think about is sitting down
[2:23:15] but something inside of me says Thank
[2:23:18] You Lord because no matter what happens
[2:23:20] my brother and sister no matter what
[2:23:23] happens the devil can't take God's own
[2:23:27] life where God put it
[2:23:31] he can't break in
[2:23:33] he can't get it
[2:23:34] [Music]
[2:23:35] oh Hallelujah can you say that life's in
[2:23:39] me that life's in me and there's no way
[2:23:42] the devil can get in here to take it no
[2:23:45] matter what happens around me know what
[2:23:47] happens to me
[2:23:49] the devil can't even get there and you
[2:23:53] want to know why that's so and I can say
[2:23:54] with such confidence because I'll take
[2:23:56] you back to the prophet's words
[2:23:58] when he says if you get under the blood
[2:24:01] and stay under the blood the only way
[2:24:05] that Satan gets to you is when you come
[2:24:08] out from underneath the blood and if
[2:24:12] you're under the blood
[2:24:14] and Satan comes under the blood
[2:24:18] he'll be your brother that's how
[2:24:21] powerful the blood is hallelujah so the
[2:24:24] devil cannot
[2:24:25] hey man oh don't come out to him Saints
[2:24:28] make him come
[2:24:29] make him come under the blood Hallelujah
