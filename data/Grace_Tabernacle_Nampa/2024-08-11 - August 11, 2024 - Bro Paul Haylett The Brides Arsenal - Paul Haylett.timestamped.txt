[22:03] bought a
[22:04] pair and we have them sitting in our on
[22:07] top of our piano as a

[33:49] go into the word thank you brother Chris
[33:51] I really enjoyed the song service it
[33:53] kind of fit with uh a lot of things um
[33:57] that we have
[33:58] been thinking on uh I have to admit I
[34:01] have uh uh just had a a lot of Mind
[34:06] battle in the last while here but the
[34:09] Lord just gave me a lovely little
[34:11] breakthrough it wasn't it wasn't uh in
[34:14] the way you'd normally think a
[34:16] breakthrough would come but um you know
[34:20] um
[34:22] just through the study of
[34:25] Sarah and she speaks out those words
[34:29] saying you know will I have pleasure
[34:31] with my Lord again and looking back to
[34:35] the Natural Things of Life The Joy of
[34:37] Life a married couple and she wants to
[34:40] know are you're saying I can go back to
[34:42] that position and something just really
[34:46] reached out of the word to me and said
[34:49] that's what's been troubling you Paul
[34:51] you've
[34:52] actually kind of lost that Joy a little
[34:55] bit it's kind of circumstances of
[34:58] stripped that away and and you know I
[35:02] believe you know very much so that that
[35:05] the word of God knows our very need for
[35:08] the day we live in and um I I just was
[35:12] like L Lord I Want My Joy with my Lord I
[35:16] I want that pleasure to serve you and um
[35:20] you know it's just to me a miracle I
[35:23] just like Suddenly It's like the
[35:26] barriers that had been holding me back
[35:29] just vaporized and suddenly you're just
[35:32] like thank you Lord uh we we can right
[35:35] here today Saints have pleasure in our
[35:39] Lord amen the cares of Life are strong
[35:42] but they're going to still be there we
[35:44] don't have to remain subject to them we
[35:46] don't have to let that rule our life all
[35:49] of the financial things we would suffer
[35:51] health things we' suffer everything's
[35:53] going to still be there but that does
[35:55] not have to stop us from having having
[35:57] pleasure in our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[36:02] so I would just like to turn and this
[36:04] scripture we we spoke last Sunday make a
[36:07] little more emphasis uh 2 Corinthians
[36:10] the 10th chapter veres 3-5 I want to
[36:13] last week we we spoke on uh the the uh
[36:19] Jeremiah 50 and in verse 25 there it
[36:22] says the Lord hath opened his Armory and
[36:25] hath brought the forth the weapon of his
[36:28] indignation and um I just want to just
[36:31] come here in 2 Corinthians 10 3-5 and
[36:34] we're going to take this from being
[36:36] God's Armory to the bride's Arsenal and
[36:40] that's what we'll title it today because
[36:43] you see everything that our lord Jesus
[36:45] went through and we'll touch on this
[36:47] probably again but everything our lord
[36:49] Jesus went through he went through for
[36:52] our sake he did not need to go through
[36:55] it for his sake even though the word
[36:57] says that he learned obedience by
[37:01] suffering now my brother and sister did
[37:04] our Lord Jesus
[37:06] Christ need
[37:08] to or was it for a greater
[37:11] purpose was he Christ in the flesh not
[37:16] subject was there some kind of rebellion
[37:19] in him was there something that uh uh
[37:24] God In the Flesh needed perfecting
[37:28] you see we have to realize or catch the
[37:30] very fact that that he went through that
[37:34] for our
[37:35] sake amen less we would think that there
[37:38] was some
[37:44] imperfection for though we walk in the
[37:47] flesh we do not war after the flesh for
[37:51] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[37:55] carnal and often times
[37:57] times we would look at that and our mind
[38:01] immediately says right this is not the
[38:03] bow the spear this is not uh the the
[38:07] sword this is not but I also want you to
[38:09] look at it from this point of view for
[38:11] the weapons of our Warfare are not this
[38:14] carnal
[38:15] flesh this flesh is not going to take
[38:19] care of or
[38:21] conquer it is not us but Mighty through
[38:25] God to the pulling down of strongholds
[38:27] casting down imaginations every High
[38:30] thing that exalted itself against the
[38:32] knowledge of God and bringing into
[38:34] captivity every
[38:36] thought boy I tell you what I I I'm
[38:39] still working on that amen bringing
[38:42] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[38:45] of Christ Heavenly Father we just ask
[38:47] you to bless this time together Lord
[38:50] bless these precious Saints father as we
[38:52] uh go through life father we celebrate
[38:55] birthdays and anniversaries Lord we
[38:57] celebrate milestones in our lives and
[39:00] how quickly the time passes how quickly
[39:02] the years evaporate but father we know
[39:05] that we're not moving into old age we're
[39:08] moving into eternity and father let us
[39:11] have a joy in our heart a song in our
[39:13] lips father as we give praise to you for
[39:16] the days that you give us Lord for the
[39:19] victories that we have won the things
[39:21] that we have overcome now father we make
[39:24] a commitment today Father to let your
[39:26] word touch Our Lives Lord let it have
[39:28] such an impact that we leave here today
[39:31] A changed people Lord one filled with
[39:34] more joy more Victory more Faith Lord
[39:37] more uh of everything every virtue
[39:40] father that you've given us let it be a
[39:42] increased and abounding today we ask in
[39:45] the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[39:53] seated now I want to just go back to
[39:56] Jeremiah 5 for just a moment as we would
[39:59] look at this just as a reference the
[40:02] sound of battle is in the land and of
[40:05] great destruction and we are living in
[40:08] such a time that even historians are
[40:10] declaring that it is just as great of
[40:14] chaotic time has ever been on the earth
[40:17] the equivalent of the Cold War from
[40:20] Years Gone by all of these things that
[40:22] are happening uh the spies are in the
[40:25] land some positive some negative and
[40:28] we're looking at alliances made that you
[40:30] would say why would that Alliance be
[40:32] made but we realize that it's part of
[40:35] scripture being fulfilled and as we'll
[40:37] see that uh my brother and sister that
[40:40] that uh you look back in history just to
[40:42] give you an example China and Russia
[40:45] have never been friends and yet today
[40:47] they are signing alliances they're
[40:49] talking about Mutual support uh in the
[40:52] time of warfare they're talking about
[40:54] supplying things to one another and so
[40:57] you see that the maturity of time has
[41:00] come and brought us to a place that
[41:02] truly the sound of battle is in the land
[41:05] and there is definitely a great
[41:07] destruction and uh we would move forward
[41:09] here today to Matthew 4 and we'll look
[41:12] at this verses 1-10 because we're
[41:15] looking that man has always uh
[41:18] experienced some form of warfare there's
[41:21] always been starting with Cain and Abel
[41:23] there's always been uh someone trying to
[41:26] take the life of another and we look at
[41:29] our lord Jesus here in Matthew 4 in the
[41:32] first verse he says uh uh Jesus was led
[41:35] up of the spirit Into the Wilderness and
[41:38] there was a purpose that he was being
[41:40] led to the Wilderness it wasn't for just
[41:42] a nice hike but he was led there to be
[41:45] tempted of the devil now this is God
[41:48] setting a stage my brother and sister
[41:51] and you can look at this and realize
[41:53] today that just as our lord Jesus was
[41:56] led into the wilderness Wilderness to be
[41:57] tempted so God has allowed you to be
[42:00] living here in leoda in this time he
[42:04] allowed it he didn't force it upon you
[42:07] he allowed it because our tempting and
[42:10] our test must come also we do not get a
[42:13] free pass that's why this cannot be your
[42:15] mother's religion or your daddy's
[42:17] religion or grandma or Grandpa's
[42:20] religion it's got to be your religion
[42:22] it's got to be your experience and so
[42:24] God's going to allow you to be led into
[42:27] to the Wilderness that is called leoa
[42:30] and it's here in this time my brother
[42:32] and sister now we we don't want to get
[42:34] confused about a lot of these things
[42:36] we'll be preaching at times about the
[42:39] bride Age and and these things but as we
[42:42] are coming my brother and sister into
[42:44] Perfection God is still knocking the
[42:47] dross out of you and I and I don't know
[42:50] about you but I have some dross that I
[42:52] acknowledge I not need knocked out of me
[42:55] there's things in my life that I stop
[42:57] and say Lord is that still there I
[42:59] thought I'd dealt with that years ago
[43:01] but yet it's rared its head up again
[43:04] amen and so when he had fasted 40 days
[43:07] and 40 night he was afterward uh
[43:10] hungered and when the tempter came to
[43:12] him and said if thou be the Son of God
[43:15] command that these Stones be made bread
[43:18] and he answered and said it is written
[43:20] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[43:22] every word that proceedeth out of the
[43:24] mouth of God and then the devil taking
[43:27] him up into the holy city and setting
[43:29] him on the Pinnacle of the temple and
[43:31] saith unto him if thou be Son of God
[43:34] cast thyself down for it is written he
[43:36] shall give his angels charge concerning
[43:39] thee and in their hands they shall bear
[43:41] thee up lest at any time Thou shalt Dash
[43:44] thy foot against a stone Jesus said unto
[43:47] him it is written again Thou shalt not
[43:52] tempt the Lord thy God again the devil
[43:55] taketh him up into exceeding High
[43:57] mountain and showeth him all the
[43:59] kingdoms of the world and the glory of
[44:01] them and saith unto him all these things
[44:05] will I give thee see here's the
[44:06] foundation of the God of this evil age
[44:09] right he he never got rebuked for you
[44:11] have no right to promise these things
[44:14] there was no rebuke to that he had
[44:16] control but my brother and sister his
[44:18] control praise God we know is only
[44:21] temporary amen but it's there he says I
[44:24] shows him and all all these things give
[44:27] you if thou will fall down and worship
[44:29] me then said Jesus unto him get thee
[44:32] hint Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[44:35] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[44:38] shalt thou serve now we look at this
[44:40] great hour of Temptation This great time
[44:44] when Jesus himself uh could have
[44:47] actually used a number of things you see
[44:49] he could have fallen back Beyond it is
[44:52] written he did not need to say it is
[44:54] written because he was the word and and
[44:57] so as the word he could have said Satan
[45:00] I bind thee and Satan would have been
[45:02] bound but you see for your sake and for
[45:05] my sake he allowed these things to
[45:08] continue on he gives Satan his
[45:11] opportunity and in that opportunity God
[45:14] was proving a point that is so of Great
[45:18] Value to you and I today it is something
[45:21] that is so important but you know
[45:23] sometimes I think In the Heat of the
[45:24] battle we kind of forget that we've been
[45:26] given this weapon and this is here in
[45:29] the brides Arsenal in the day that we
[45:31] live in today uh this has been given to
[45:35] us could someone say Amen thank you Lord
[45:39] this has been given to us this is no
[45:41] longer we must go and ask for
[45:44] it or desire a way to use it it has been
[45:49] given in a fullness to you and I now my
[45:53] brother and sister I I I hope you don't
[45:56] mind today this is probably going to be
[45:58] about an eight or 10 part uh uh deal but
[46:01] but I decided I I I'm not going to hurry
[46:04] through it I I'm just going to go and
[46:06] we'll just preach whatever part it comes
[46:09] and and you guys may or may not be happy
[46:11] to get out early or maybe you won't get
[46:13] out early who knows but as you look at
[46:16] this and we must realize uh uh in this
[46:19] hour of great Temptation Jesus could
[46:21] have just simply bound Satan he had that
[46:23] authority to have bound him amen and we
[46:27] look at this that that um he was laying
[46:31] a foundation for us he knew what we
[46:34] would encounter in our life he knew
[46:36] every struggle if the Lord would come
[46:38] today he could tell you everything from
[46:42] your past that you might have even
[46:44] forgotten and he can tell you what today
[46:47] would be and he could tell you what your
[46:49] tomorrow's will also be but he chose
[46:53] this pattern of letting us live it out
[46:55] he chose this pattern of not uh causing
[46:58] us uh uh to either relax oh he's got it
[47:02] covered but for us to pursue the word
[47:05] amen to pursue the life to uh present
[47:08] ourselves as the word says a Living
[47:10] Sacrifice to our Lord Jesus Christ and
[47:14] uh so it's there if if Jesus had just
[47:17] simply bound Satan and said you know I'm
[47:19] ignoring you and and uh we would have to
[47:22] come uh my brother and sister and
[47:25] according to the word as we know it we
[47:27] would not be able to replicate that in
[47:29] the fashion that our lord Jesus would
[47:31] have that God would have bound Satan we
[47:34] would not have been able to replicate
[47:36] that in that exact fashion but God
[47:39] through his word has come and set in
[47:42] place something that you and I can
[47:44] follow and every single day we can stand
[47:49] upon the word of God in the hour we live
[47:52] in in the struggle that we're in and we
[47:55] can declare it is WR written amen that
[47:58] is something that we ought to maybe hold
[48:01] on to a little closer than we have in
[48:03] the past cuz I I'm just going to make an
[48:05] assumption today and I hope you don't
[48:07] mind but I don't think that you're much
[48:08] different than I am and sometimes in the
[48:11] midst of our battle we start thinking
[48:13] about wo is me wo is this situation what
[48:16] am I going to do how can I do this what
[48:19] will take place and we get so focused in
[48:22] that when God actually wanted you and I
[48:24] to come to the same place that our Lord
[48:27] Jesus was and look Satan in the face and
[48:30] just say it is written amen my name is
[48:34] written in the Lamb's Book of Life it is
[48:36] written amen I'm not here depending on
[48:39] your opinion Satan of what my life is
[48:43] and who I am but it is written and I
[48:46] stand in that position and I will be
[48:48] unmoved from that position amen amen so
[48:52] he's setting in place something we can
[48:54] use every single day now if we'll put
[48:57] that in the Forefront of our everyday
[48:59] life we'll be able to stand in the
[49:02] storms of life and be able to say you
[49:04] know what the word says the word says it
[49:07] is written and I believe this message of
[49:11] the hour that God sent to us he used a
[49:14] prophet he ordained it he Vindicated it
[49:16] and he brought it back and laid it
[49:18] before us and even more so than that he
[49:21] gave you Revelation to understand the
[49:23] word that was
[49:25] spoken because if everyone understood
[49:27] the word that was spoken my brother and
[49:29] sister the message would be the greatest
[49:32] collection of people in the world today
[49:35] but they can't believe it they can't
[49:38] understand it they don't comprehend it
[49:40] so therefore they put it to the side and
[49:43] say well this just can't be we we are
[49:45] more established we have more people we
[49:48] have more but the word is right there in
[49:50] front of them but they can't understand
[49:52] the word amen just as it was everyone on
[49:56] the face of of the Earth in Jesus day
[49:58] should have been able to say it is
[50:01] written but they rejected it he became
[50:04] be elub and he became a soothsayer he
[50:07] become you know all these other things
[50:09] that they labeled him with because God
[50:12] has Reserve that for a select group of
[50:14] people and we don't say that to be
[50:16] boastful but we say that with
[50:18] Thanksgiving in our hearts Lord thank
[50:20] you for your grace that you opened our
[50:22] eyes and opened our ears amen and the
[50:25] word the point being the word should be
[50:28] the point of our spear it should be the
[50:30] point of our thoughts it should be the
[50:32] point of our reaction and our voice it
[50:35] should be the point of everything of our
[50:37] life now brother brandom says in Jesus
[50:40] Christ the same yesterday today and
[50:42] forever now remember this that I make
[50:45] this quotation the word of God will
[50:48] defeat Satan anywhere any time any place
[50:54] on any condition
[50:57] amen let me repeat that again any
[51:02] condition there's not a condition on
[51:04] this Earth my brother and sister that
[51:06] the word will not defeat this is not us
[51:09] going raw raw raw This Is Us believing
[51:12] the word and the word is there that
[51:15] Satan cannot overpower it it cannot the
[51:18] only way he can take it away from us is
[51:20] if we give him the key now think about a
[51:23] key I'm going to go after church here
[51:26] I'm going to go around the parking lot
[51:27] cuz I want to select a really nice car
[51:30] I'm going to look at your cars and I'm
[51:31] going to take my key and I'm going to
[51:33] just put it in the the door of your car
[51:36] and unlock
[51:38] it
[51:42] no we have the key my brother and sister
[51:46] and the only way it can be unlocked is
[51:48] for us as Sons and Daughters of God to
[51:50] give our key to the devil
[52:01] amen otherwise there's no way for the
[52:04] devil to open the
[52:06] door imagine if there was only one key
[52:09] on the face of the Earth you might as
[52:10] well not have a
[52:12] lock because anybody could just walk up
[52:15] to your car or your
[52:17] house Amen to those of you that it would
[52:20] apply your gun
[52:23] safe there would be no be no need for a
[52:26] key
[52:28] the word of God will defeat Satan
[52:30] anywhere any time any place on any
[52:33] condition the word of God Alone it is
[52:37] written will defeat Satan no matter who
[52:39] he is what form he comes in where he's
[52:43] at it will defeat Satan now that is
[52:45] truth the written word of God so this is
[52:50] not a special Revelation my brother and
[52:52] sister that's given that will unlock the
[52:54] door once you have special revelation
[52:57] amen so some man studying some man
[52:59] working some man doing no my brother and
[53:01] sister well the Revelation that God has
[53:03] given to you the whole key to it all God
[53:06] Gave You amen no man preached it no man
[53:10] revealed it no man did this it was God
[53:13] God used men but it was God who give you
[53:15] the key to unlock it all and when you
[53:17] caught the revelation of baptism that
[53:20] was God giving it to you when he gave
[53:22] you the revelation of certain seed it
[53:24] was God giving it to you the marriage
[53:26] and divorce just go down the list of all
[53:28] these things it wasn't man that gave it
[53:31] it was God himself giving directly to
[53:34] you the key of the word to open it in
[53:36] your life to bless
[53:38] you and defend
[53:41] you now John 1 and we all know John 1
[53:45] but we're going to go into that in the
[53:47] beginning was the
[53:49] word amen now we come down here to verse
[53:52] 11 where I want to just kind of keep
[53:54] this concise and he he came into his own
[53:58] and his own now this is by race and
[54:00] Creed my brother and sister in a sense
[54:03] he came into his own and his own
[54:04] received him not but as many as received
[54:07] him can someone say Amen but as many as
[54:11] received him to them gave he power to
[54:14] become the sons of God even to them that
[54:17] believe on his name which were born not
[54:20] of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor
[54:23] the will of man but of God and the word
[54:26] oh I love this the word was made flesh
[54:29] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[54:32] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[54:35] of the father full of grace and truth
[54:38] now we're going to look at this my
[54:39] brother for just a second here he was
[54:42] given uh we have been given the power to
[54:48] become this is not of
[54:51] works this is not we were worthy we were
[54:54] smart enough what
[54:57] ever now what is this
[55:00] word
[55:05] become there's lots of
[55:07] definitions and I get to Cherry pick my
[55:09] own because I'm
[55:12] preaching but it ties in
[55:15] appointed we have been given
[55:19] power because we were
[55:22] appointed we're appointed as sons of God
[55:25] and Daughters of God that also connects
[55:27] into
[55:29] predestinated there is part of the
[55:31] appointment now appointed to be
[55:34] Abraham's spiritual
[55:36] seed can someone say thank you Lord that
[55:38] we Are Spiritual seed today amen that we
[55:42] were in Christ from before the
[55:44] foundation of the world that is
[55:46] something should always stir our hearts
[55:49] shouldn't become old and and just a
[55:51] common phrase to us but to know that we
[55:54] were appointed of God to become Sons and
[55:58] Daughters of God before there was a
[55:59] foundation of this very world and we
[56:02] were appointed to hear the word without
[56:05] that being appointed you say brother
[56:07] Paul we know this that's right I'm just
[56:09] here to stir up your pure Minds in
[56:11] remembrance today amen just to Stir It
[56:13] Up that you won't get LED astray by
[56:16] thoughts of this world and and the the
[56:18] cares and the disappointments and all
[56:21] the little things that Satan is so good
[56:23] at doing to us amen so he here it is you
[56:26] were appointed to hear the
[56:28] word now when you think about that my
[56:31] brother and sister I I think you know
[56:33] that that we want to be careful about
[56:35] drawing out too much of each individual
[56:38] story but I I know most of you well
[56:41] enough to know that that how God chose
[56:45] to appoint the word was settled long
[56:50] ago but the actual manifestation of him
[56:54] appointing or revealing or exposing the
[56:57] word in you is such a unique it's a
[57:00] lovely story and I I think that it Bears
[57:03] a reminder to each and every one of us
[57:06] how that we would come because you will
[57:08] see the type and the anti-type you will
[57:10] see uh some would say I've always been
[57:13] in church but not everyone that was in
[57:15] church with you is still
[57:17] here amen and some would been out
[57:19] steeped in sin in the world today caught
[57:22] up in all of the things of the world
[57:25] today and sitting in the same
[57:28] environment but one day God exposes the
[57:32] light on a seed that before the
[57:34] foundation of the world he placed in you
[57:36] and you tell me how he did
[57:40] that well I heard the word
[57:44] preached a lot of people heard the word
[57:47] preached something in me just
[57:51] believed
[57:53] how cuz you were born in sin and shaped
[57:56] in iniquity come into this world
[57:58] speaking lies how did it settle on
[58:02] you because God
[58:04] himself had you in his family
[58:07] album you were there have always been
[58:10] there he knows you by name he knows you
[58:13] by your heart's cry he knows you in
[58:15] every facet of your Humanity he knows
[58:18] you and he placed that word and he put
[58:21] something in you that when you heard the
[58:23] word you were able to act upon it
[58:26] amen I I I can think of there's
[58:29] sometimes very funny stories and I won't
[58:31] bring them out I would like to but it's
[58:33] not always nice and I'm trying to break
[58:35] the Habit amen but I'm telling you my
[58:37] brother and sisters some of the
[58:39] experience that we have it just causes
[58:41] us to step back in Wonder of how it is
[58:45] that we receive the word how it is that
[58:47] we come to a place and a time I can
[58:50] share with you examples of a man sitting
[58:52] on a bar seat a brother sitting on a bar
[58:54] stool and some somebody there in their
[58:57] Town very prominent message church and
[58:59] somebody in the bar talking about these
[59:01] people and this man rars up and he just
[59:04] unloads on these guys about they're
[59:06] wrong they don't know you're just
[59:08] repeating gossip and you're just doing
[59:10] that and they're all shocked and they
[59:12] were like wow we didn't know you cared
[59:14] that much about it and he stopped and
[59:16] thought I didn't know I cared that much
[59:20] about
[59:22] it but you see something from maybe a
[59:25] troubled childhood in the midst of a
[59:28] current church or a past church I mean
[59:31] and he he's there and and he's got
[59:33] reasons the reason I don't
[59:35] believe but then he realized you know
[59:38] what I believe in enough to sit and
[59:40] blast my very best friends that they
[59:43] don't know what they're talking about
[59:44] that this is truth this is life God is
[59:47] real this message is real and those
[59:50] people are holy people
[59:52] amen and then his body obeyed his
[59:55] confession
[59:57] and he found himself in church serving
[59:59] God again and now today is a blessed man
[1:00:03] but you see my brother and sister
[1:00:05] there's got to be something that causes
[1:00:06] you to act on the word many hear the
[1:00:09] word yeah many have heard the word and
[1:00:12] many have walked away from the word that
[1:00:14] they
[1:00:17] heard but there's those that are going
[1:00:19] to act on the word those that are going
[1:00:23] to say Amen to the word now whether you
[1:00:25] say Amen am men out loud or in your
[1:00:28] heart I I believe that's somewhat
[1:00:30] irrelevant I would encourage you every
[1:00:32] once in a while just test your vocal
[1:00:34] cords and say Amen out loud might shock
[1:00:37] you to hear your own voice confessing
[1:00:39] the word but it'd be good for
[1:00:42] you
[1:00:44] amen so to say Amen to the
[1:00:48] word don't you just love how the prophet
[1:00:51] brought this he says when people say
[1:00:53] amen to the word it's like go get them
[1:00:56] sick them Hallelujah who wants to sick
[1:00:59] the word on the devil today amen can we
[1:01:02] get an amen just to sick the word on the
[1:01:04] devil today Hallelujah don't want to sit
[1:01:07] back and be a bystander we want the
[1:01:09] devil driven out amen we want him to be
[1:01:13] I tell you years ago we had this great
[1:01:15] big dog named Cody and it was so amazing
[1:01:18] you know I at the time would be
[1:01:20] frustrated with Cody because we would
[1:01:22] have a car driving the
[1:01:24] driveway and and and people wouldn't
[1:01:26] even get out of their car because Cody
[1:01:28] would run up to their car and here's
[1:01:31] their door and Cody's looking in their
[1:01:33] car and people would just sit there with
[1:01:35] a look on their face but you know I
[1:01:39] appreciate it as life went on
[1:01:41] unfortunately it took me a little too
[1:01:42] long sister Jerry says I never love a
[1:01:45] dog until it's dead but you know I did
[1:01:48] recognize that Cody had something
[1:01:50] special about him because people just
[1:01:52] didn't get out of their car and roam
[1:01:54] around your place because Cody was there
[1:01:56] to greet them now my brother and sister
[1:01:59] our little dog teddy he can run out and
[1:02:01] he can Yip and Yip and Yip and Yip and
[1:02:04] it won't matter no one's really afraid
[1:02:07] of Teddy so it all depends on how you
[1:02:10] want to present your view of the Gospel
[1:02:14] concerning the devil amen you can be the
[1:02:17] little guy who stands there all muscular
[1:02:20] if you guys ever noticed Teddy's got
[1:02:22] these just biceps on his little legs
[1:02:24] there you know big chest but he's a
[1:02:27] stall amen Cody on the other hand years
[1:02:32] ago would walk out
[1:02:38] there people climb back in their
[1:02:42] car now what are we going to be to the
[1:02:49] devil
[1:02:53] Y come on it's it's okay to have a
[1:02:56] little Joy amen or do you want to be one
[1:03:01] that in the eyes of the Devil comes out
[1:03:03] there and says Jesus Christ is the same
[1:03:06] yesterday today and forever and you
[1:03:10] can't convince me any
[1:03:14] different the devil would come and say
[1:03:16] well you got to be baptized in this
[1:03:20] fashion in that fashion and and you know
[1:03:23] this is and because there's there's way
[1:03:25] more of us baptized like this then there
[1:03:28] are a view you have a misconception of
[1:03:30] the word but God never recorded once my
[1:03:32] brother and sister their baptism in
[1:03:36] scripture not
[1:03:38] once so it's there when we say Amen to
[1:03:41] the word we unlock the prophet says we
[1:03:44] unlock the word in our life and it
[1:03:48] starts to take effect so you see all of
[1:03:51] these things that we have been appointed
[1:03:52] to not one of them did we do it not one
[1:03:55] of those did we bring it amen it's not
[1:03:58] really you it's Christ in you and as we
[1:04:02] sit here today with Christ in us we
[1:04:05] cannot sit here today Saints I hope I'm
[1:04:07] not speaking too harshly but we cannot
[1:04:10] sit here today if Christ is in us and
[1:04:13] not change we cannot sit here and see
[1:04:17] the word the open word and not respond
[1:04:20] to it there is something inside the
[1:04:23] Bride of Jesus Christ she has to say say
[1:04:26] Amen to the word she has to open up and
[1:04:29] say I receive this and when you receive
[1:04:32] this in the right Spirit the right
[1:04:34] attitude the prophet of God says it has
[1:04:36] to change
[1:04:38] you I believe that amen so it's Christ
[1:04:42] in you amen and Christ coming out of you
[1:04:46] amen it's not just I collected up so
[1:04:48] much of the Holy Spirit I can say I've
[1:04:51] got the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit has
[1:04:53] to flow through you
[1:04:56] amen flow through me holy spirit amen
[1:04:59] because when you have any body of water
[1:05:02] and you Dam it up the prophet God speaks
[1:05:05] about this you Dam it up it becomes
[1:05:07] stagnant you tell me that if there's a
[1:05:10] Christian says I'm filled with the Holy
[1:05:12] Ghost but it's not coming out of him
[1:05:16] what does the holy ghost look like when
[1:05:17] it's
[1:05:19] stagnant the Holy Spirit cannot be
[1:05:24] stagnant it's God himself amen that
[1:05:27] would be the position of saying well
[1:05:29] I've heard God he spoke he said this he
[1:05:32] said that I don't see anything new
[1:05:34] that's stale I'm going to leave it no my
[1:05:37] brother and sister God can't be stale
[1:05:39] and he only becomes stale in our life
[1:05:41] when we don't let it flow through US
[1:05:44] amen when we have barely enough of the
[1:05:47] Holy Spirit to keep us living there's no
[1:05:50] way my brother and sister that you're
[1:05:52] going to have it flowing out of you so
[1:05:55] when you come to the place that it flows
[1:05:57] into you and doesn't flow out you are
[1:05:59] going to end up in a stagnant
[1:06:01] relationship with the Lord and probably
[1:06:05] everyone around
[1:06:08] you you see people I I'm always
[1:06:11] surprised that people that not not
[1:06:14] everybody but some people have a push
[1:06:16] back uh uh in the message about uh
[1:06:19] manifested Sons and Daughters of God now
[1:06:21] if you go on the internet and you'll
[1:06:23] look at this they will actually talked
[1:06:25] about the manifested Sons and Daughters
[1:06:26] of God as though that's some kind of
[1:06:29] evil messed up thing but it shows you
[1:06:31] how uh um lacking they are in Revelation
[1:06:35] because if Christ is in you it's got to
[1:06:39] make itself known yeah amen there is no
[1:06:43] such thing as a hidden
[1:06:46] Christian there will be something that
[1:06:50] manifests out of you amen because the
[1:06:53] word manifested is something on display
[1:06:56] or an Evidence if we are a Christian and
[1:07:00] there's no evidence as brother brandham
[1:07:02] talks about the court trial there's no
[1:07:04] evidence to convict us of being a
[1:07:07] Christian then are we really a
[1:07:10] Christian can somebody answer that for
[1:07:13] me
[1:07:15] no if there's no evidence to convict you
[1:07:18] of being a Christian then you're not a
[1:07:21] Christian is that
[1:07:24] blunt needs to be
[1:07:26] blunt
[1:07:28] amen we are not Christians in name only
[1:07:32] amen we are Christians by The Life of
[1:07:34] Christ manifested through US amen
[1:07:38] now when we come to that place my
[1:07:40] brother and sister there has to be
[1:07:42] something that's expressing the
[1:07:43] authority of the word over our life
[1:07:46] that's why we have so many people today
[1:07:49] and I I'm not saying this judgmental but
[1:07:51] we have so many people today that very
[1:07:54] very little of their life is an Evidence
[1:07:57] of Christ being present and then they
[1:07:59] tell you that the Lord spoke to me and
[1:08:01] gave me this Revelation the internet's
[1:08:03] clear full of it God come to me last
[1:08:06] night and said this and this is going to
[1:08:08] happen but there's nothing there to give
[1:08:11] evidence that Christ is present now I
[1:08:14] know I know he used a donkey
[1:08:17] once but I think you will find out that
[1:08:20] that donkey was a consecrated
[1:08:22] donkey he was a espcially chosen donkey
[1:08:26] they didn't just grab any wood in the
[1:08:28] Corell that one was chosen of God
[1:08:30] because that donkey actually had an ear
[1:08:33] to hear and an eye to
[1:08:37] see you imagine the donkey's
[1:08:40] mind I we all have our thoughts of what
[1:08:43] probably donkeys would be thinking I
[1:08:46] know if the donkey was like me he would
[1:08:48] be only concerned with his next
[1:08:51] meal but God had a special donkey and
[1:08:55] it's sees the
[1:08:57] angel and it had more
[1:09:02] sense
[1:09:04] chosen now if God can choose donkeys
[1:09:07] surely we can recognize how incredible
[1:09:11] God's choosing is for us how that we
[1:09:14] could of all the people on the Earth
[1:09:16] today come to a position to recognize
[1:09:19] that God has chosen us now my brother
[1:09:22] and sister when we express the authority
[1:09:25] of the word over our life now this will
[1:09:28] be a little straightforward forgive me
[1:09:29] but this is just what we're going to
[1:09:31] speak amen when we have people my
[1:09:34] brother and sister that will willfully
[1:09:35] set the word to the side they are
[1:09:39] actually saying I do not give the word
[1:09:43] authority over my
[1:09:48] life come on that's pretty blunt we find
[1:09:50] reasons we have what we call excuses now
[1:09:54] you don't need to lift your hands but I
[1:09:56] do believe if you would disagree with me
[1:09:58] go ahead and lift your hand but we have
[1:10:01] excuses we got a lot of reasons why we
[1:10:04] didn't well why don't we come up with
[1:10:06] some reasons why we did amen I followed
[1:10:10] the word why because the word has
[1:10:13] dominion over my life I am subjected to
[1:10:18] the word I I am in subjection the word
[1:10:21] is going to rule my life and and when we
[1:10:23] do we're telling the world that the word
[1:10:26] has authority over us people would say
[1:10:29] well couldn't you just do this or settle
[1:10:31] for this my brother and sister when
[1:10:33] you're under Authority amen as it is you
[1:10:37] know uh when that Centurion comes to
[1:10:40] Jesus and he says look I'm a man under
[1:10:42] Authority and when I say come they come
[1:10:45] when I say go they go how about what we
[1:10:48] would come and submit ourselves so much
[1:10:51] to the word of God that when the word
[1:10:53] says come we come and when the word says
[1:10:56] go we go instead of coming and offering
[1:10:58] our reason why we can't why don't we
[1:11:02] simply say Lord I'm here I submit myself
[1:11:05] I want to see the word manifested in me
[1:11:09] amen now look at this brother brandham
[1:11:11] talks about this a little bit when
[1:11:12] they're talking about the Trinity uh and
[1:11:15] and here it is a a person void of
[1:11:20] expression is not really alive you see
[1:11:24] if a person is a person he has
[1:11:28] personality and so it it must be my
[1:11:30] brother and sister that when we are void
[1:11:33] of
[1:11:38] expression I have what I consider to be
[1:11:40] a dear friend I went to school with him
[1:11:43] forever High School Farms out Beyond us
[1:11:46] there trying to witness to this this man
[1:11:50] this
[1:11:51] friend and he told me Paul he goes maybe
[1:11:55] maybe you don't feel this way but for
[1:11:58] me uh uh religion is a very deeply
[1:12:03] personal private thing not to be shared
[1:12:08] or talked
[1:12:10] about and it struck me as much as I like
[1:12:13] this man his name is Paul
[1:12:15] also that's not why I like
[1:12:20] him but you see how Satan had come and
[1:12:25] come up and put the barrier before
[1:12:29] him that we don't talk about it don't
[1:12:32] talk about my soul I don't talk about my
[1:12:34] sin I'm a good person I keep it very
[1:12:39] private well I'm here my brother and
[1:12:42] sister according to the word we're
[1:12:44] supposed to share our faults I've got
[1:12:47] time if you guys want to
[1:12:51] share we can laugh about that right
[1:12:55] but you realize in the course of
[1:12:57] conversation Fellowship Etc we do share
[1:12:59] our
[1:13:00] faults we do share I need prayer I have
[1:13:03] sickness I have this weakness I have
[1:13:05] this troubles I have and and it comes
[1:13:07] out sooner or later we end up being
[1:13:10] transparent even if we don't think we
[1:13:13] are so when the word has authority over
[1:13:16] our life we then start to express what
[1:13:21] has authority over us my brother and
[1:13:23] sister now when we are in that we have a
[1:13:26] personality we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:13:28] God we are not just some mechanical
[1:13:31] thing but we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:13:34] God so I want to ask you what
[1:13:35] personality are we going to manifest we
[1:13:38] will manifest the personality of the
[1:13:42] word by the Revelation which you
[1:13:45] have you say I know brothers so and so
[1:13:48] sisters so and so they're a person of
[1:13:49] great faith why are they a person of
[1:13:51] great
[1:13:54] faith because they're exercising it
[1:13:58] yeah you don't exercise your faith you
[1:14:01] end up with arms this size right
[1:14:04] here you exercise your faith and Faith
[1:14:07] starts to be manifested to you and it
[1:14:10] becomes something by the nature I want
[1:14:12] you to see how much God intertwined our
[1:14:15] very human nature is that when we in the
[1:14:19] natural we we start to exercise and we
[1:14:23] start to do and and pretty soon it
[1:14:25] becomes manifest that we can uh you know
[1:14:27] climb the mountain or run the mile or do
[1:14:30] whatever lift this weights it it it
[1:14:32] manifest it you can't do all of that
[1:14:34] without a manifestation and when we
[1:14:36] consume the word my brother and sister
[1:14:38] and eat the word we will find that it
[1:14:41] will be manifested in us when we're
[1:14:44] receiving the word the word starts to
[1:14:46] show on the outside of us and I'm sorry
[1:14:49] but I take this from something brother
[1:14:50] Donnie Reagan preached many years ago
[1:14:52] and it might not be perfect in its
[1:14:54] wording but the thought will be and he
[1:14:56] says there's people that sit on their
[1:14:58] couch and eat Cheetos and drink diet
[1:15:01] Pepsi all the time and then come to
[1:15:03] church and say brother Donnie I don't
[1:15:05] feel good pray for
[1:15:09] me brother Donnie says you if you would
[1:15:11] exercise and eat right you wouldn't feel
[1:15:15] like you feel you wouldn't be in that
[1:15:17] condition so what you need to do is
[1:15:19] change your diet Amen brother Adam
[1:15:21] preaches that to me all the time brother
[1:15:23] Paul change your diet quit eating that
[1:15:26] Sugar amen and I think brother Adam you
[1:15:29] sound like my wife but anyway um but you
[1:15:33] see my brother and sister what is
[1:15:34] happening is when the word comes in you
[1:15:38] cannot help but have the word come out
[1:15:42] it will come out it will manifest itself
[1:15:46] and it's there that the word my brother
[1:15:48] and sister now going back to the title
[1:15:50] the bride's Arsenal the prophet of God
[1:15:53] tells us that the word
[1:15:55] is the very defense first line of
[1:15:58] defense that we have as Sons and
[1:16:00] Daughters of God it was the first line
[1:16:03] that Jesus went to he went right to the
[1:16:05] word and he had consumed the word
[1:16:07] because he was the word but you and I
[1:16:10] consumed the word we become the word and
[1:16:12] the first thing that comes out of us
[1:16:14] when we have consumed the word is the
[1:16:17] word amen we don't have to go and get an
[1:16:20] opinion of a psychologist we don't have
[1:16:22] to go over here and get an opinion of a
[1:16:24] medical doctor we got to go over here
[1:16:26] and get a opinion of a PhD and a doctor
[1:16:30] of theology my brother and sister we
[1:16:33] consume the word and the word is the
[1:16:35] very first thing that comes out of us in
[1:16:38] a time of great need amen you will be
[1:16:41] there a time of desperation you will be
[1:16:44] there and the very first thing that will
[1:16:46] come out of you will be the
[1:16:49] word because that's what God has
[1:16:52] instilled in you he's placed the word at
[1:16:55] the highest level of your life and that
[1:16:58] is the first thing that comes out
[1:17:03] amen God being
[1:17:07] misunderstood that's the reason that
[1:17:09] people cannot believe in miracles
[1:17:11] today because they don't have anything
[1:17:13] in them to believe with right my
[1:17:26] they've got to have something in there
[1:17:28] to believe with when the spirit of God
[1:17:31] is in a man he'll say Amen to every word
[1:17:34] of God and every miracle of God but as
[1:17:39] my mother used to say you can't get
[1:17:40] blood from a tum because there's no
[1:17:42] blood in it and that's the same way you
[1:17:46] can't get belief out of an unbeliever
[1:17:49] because there's nothing there to believe
[1:17:53] with my brother brother and sister I was
[1:17:55] just listening I I I won't say who and
[1:17:57] what but I was just listening to a
[1:17:59] testimony of a brother talking about
[1:18:01] when he was quite
[1:18:04] young
[1:18:05] and there was an accident right in front
[1:18:07] of their
[1:18:09] Church a car had pulled out in front of
[1:18:12] a truck or a truck had pulled out in
[1:18:14] front of a car I don't remember the
[1:18:16] whole side of the car was smashed
[1:18:18] in and the wife was okay and the
[1:18:22] children were okay
[1:18:24] but the man in the car was slumped over
[1:18:27] the seat and the wife was holding his
[1:18:29] neck holding his head and she's
[1:18:31] screaming one continuous
[1:18:34] scream and they ran over
[1:18:37] there and a brother come to one side of
[1:18:39] the
[1:18:40] car oh let me put this in the pastor was
[1:18:44] preaching an anointed service and then
[1:18:46] said I think that's enough we'll stop
[1:18:48] right here and
[1:18:49] dismissed and they're outside now and
[1:18:52] this accident takes place
[1:18:56] the woman
[1:18:57] screaming one brother reaches in past
[1:19:00] her lays his hand on the chest there is
[1:19:02] so heartbeat there's no breath starts
[1:19:09] praying NE brother runs over there leans
[1:19:12] over him lays his hand on her and he's
[1:19:16] praying this brother went to the other
[1:19:18] side of the car him and another brother
[1:19:22] and the one brother had took the pulse
[1:19:24] and said there's no
[1:19:26] pulse the wife was a
[1:19:30] nurse and she checked the pulse and
[1:19:32] she's screaming he's dead he's dead he's
[1:19:40] dead and the whole church crossed the
[1:19:43] street surrounded the car started
[1:19:49] praying one brother
[1:19:51] testifies after this is all over
[1:19:54] he said by God's grace I felt virtue of
[1:19:58] life pass by
[1:20:00] me they're there hunched over reaching
[1:20:03] in praying for him and he said I felt it
[1:20:06] pass by me and all of a sudden the man
[1:20:10] sets
[1:20:12] [Music]
[1:20:15] up and starts to
[1:20:18] breathe oh multitude of witnesses no
[1:20:23] heartbeat no bre
[1:20:26] now my brother and sister we can come
[1:20:29] and we can
[1:20:30] say that that he was just knocked
[1:20:34] unconscious but it was interesting you
[1:20:36] said at that point I believe it was the
[1:20:38] the yeah the the truck the truck driver
[1:20:41] is walking around in circles in the
[1:20:43] street
[1:20:44] cursing I've killed him blank blank
[1:20:47] language I've killed him I killed him I
[1:20:51] killed him and he said but that one
[1:20:55] there was not able to overcome
[1:20:59] Faith could not change the wall of faith
[1:21:02] that had come around this man and as it
[1:21:05] was the brother still possesses the the
[1:21:08] U newspaper
[1:21:10] clipping where the newspaper
[1:21:12] acknowledged miraculous recovery and the
[1:21:15] man was a
[1:21:18] doctor miraculous
[1:21:21] recovery so many injuries should have
[1:21:24] died from his
[1:21:27] injuries but he did if they' have stood
[1:21:30] back and said well I guess that's God's
[1:21:32] will don't know what don't know why but
[1:21:37] but they were Believers and we believe
[1:21:39] in life we believe in life at the
[1:21:42] spiritual level we believe in life at
[1:21:43] the natural level we believe in life
[1:21:46] because we serve a living God we don't
[1:21:48] serve a God that just sits back and says
[1:21:51] well I can't do nothing about this we
[1:21:53] serve a God that can be moved by our
[1:21:55] prayer be moved by our need be moved in
[1:21:58] desperation be moved in our seeking of
[1:22:01] the word amen we have that kind of God
[1:22:04] that we serve amen you can't get belief
[1:22:07] out of an unbeliever but I'll tell you
[1:22:09] what you put Believers together and
[1:22:11] there can be so much belief in the word
[1:22:13] of God that it will bring life back to a
[1:22:16] man bring life back to those spiritually
[1:22:18] dead can bring it back we should not be
[1:22:21] bound by that circumstance or that be a
[1:22:24] hindrance an to us of we can't because
[1:22:26] of this we can't because of that we
[1:22:28] should be able to stand and say because
[1:22:31] the word says the word says it's going
[1:22:33] to happen because the word says I
[1:22:36] believe the word and I have this Arsenal
[1:22:40] that God has given to me and the word is
[1:22:43] the first and foremost of the Arsenal I
[1:22:46] have God said it the prophet of God puts
[1:22:48] it this way he said that it is there in
[1:22:51] time tested Memorials of God he says
[1:22:54] that the word uh being here and being
[1:22:57] still being uh um how am I I'm going to
[1:23:00] lose my thought the word still being
[1:23:02] here still being effective a Vindication
[1:23:05] of the word proves it's a - tested
[1:23:09] Memorial that God put the word here and
[1:23:13] put it down and says when you have
[1:23:15] doubts when you have fears when you have
[1:23:18] things in your life look to the word
[1:23:21] there's the memorial that you need to
[1:23:23] look to the word word he uses that
[1:23:26] example Brother David Nash preached it
[1:23:27] here in the church one time that as they
[1:23:29] crossed over Jordan there in the dry bed
[1:23:32] of Jordan they picked up a rock and
[1:23:35] carried it out and they built a memorial
[1:23:38] that has stood the test of time that
[1:23:40] their children would say Daddy what is
[1:23:43] this Memorial about this Memorial is
[1:23:45] about the time that God came on the
[1:23:47] scene for us and it is left here to stir
[1:23:50] our remembrance I'm telling you my
[1:23:52] brother and sister we are here today
[1:23:55] with a Time tested Memorial that when we
[1:23:58] have fears and doubts and we feel weak
[1:24:00] and we feel incapable we can look back
[1:24:03] to this word and say there's the proof
[1:24:06] my God is real he's on the scene he's
[1:24:10] living
[1:24:12] hallelujah
[1:24:14] hallelujah amen and if there's nothing
[1:24:17] to believe
[1:24:20] with no wonder they don't have an answer
[1:24:23] to Satan
[1:24:25] question no wonder they have no moral
[1:24:29] compass they have no
[1:24:38] security no way to
[1:24:41] respond when Satan
[1:24:44] says I'll give you all of this if you'll
[1:24:48] Bow Down and Worship
[1:24:51] me because they've got nothing to answer
[1:24:54] with
[1:24:56] we see
[1:24:58] children
[1:24:59] adults
[1:25:02] bowing because they've got no
[1:25:04] answer to
[1:25:07] Satan but we are not those people we are
[1:25:11] Sons and Daughters of God and the same
[1:25:13] God that come on the scene amen for you
[1:25:16] and I if we would just stir up our Pure
[1:25:18] Minds we remember the times that God has
[1:25:20] moved in our midst moved in our families
[1:25:23] when we were almost in the near
[1:25:24] catastrophic accident when these things
[1:25:26] have happened when it seemed like
[1:25:28] nothing could help nothing could change
[1:25:30] God come and changed it can we say Amen
[1:25:32] to that today we have our own time
[1:25:35] tested Memorials of our God is on the
[1:25:38] scene and he's living today amen we
[1:25:41] don't have to go look back to some day
[1:25:43] in the past amen oh hallelujah oh in the
[1:25:47] hour of
[1:25:48] Temptation when they have no answer this
[1:25:51] bride of Christ in this hour my brother
[1:25:53] and sister we have an
[1:25:55] answer oh Hallelujah it is written amen
[1:25:59] it is written if I don't feel like it if
[1:26:02] I don't see it if I feel isolated it
[1:26:06] doesn't matter it is written amen and I
[1:26:10] believe the written word of God
[1:26:13] hallelujah oh the hour of Temptation we
[1:26:16] must have Christ the word you
[1:26:20] know as I was talking there
[1:26:25] I'll get
[1:26:26] myself manifested sons of God you know
[1:26:31] expression now look at this my brother
[1:26:33] and
[1:26:36] sister getting lost in my own
[1:26:41] notes we have an
[1:26:44] agreement but you know agreement often
[1:26:47] times is based on opinion and
[1:26:50] feelings I don't know who to embarrass I
[1:26:53] guess I'll embarrass myself
[1:26:56] myself that's not a good example to use
[1:26:59] myself oh
[1:27:01] well how often has our opinion
[1:27:07] changed how often has your emotions
[1:27:12] changed can we count on
[1:27:15] them but did you know those are in part
[1:27:18] of the mixture that God uses of us
[1:27:21] believing the word us living the word us
[1:27:24] saying Amen to the word there's an
[1:27:28] opinion that is something that's closely
[1:27:31] held and important maybe only to
[1:27:38] you Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:27:40] today and
[1:27:41] forever if no one else agrees my opinion
[1:27:46] is
[1:27:49] yes he is the same yesterday today
[1:27:52] forever
[1:27:54] emotion when I hear the preaching of the
[1:27:57] word and I remember stirs my mind to
[1:27:59] remember
[1:28:00] things I I don't want to bring this to
[1:28:03] to to just myself
[1:28:06] but many years ago the highway doesn't
[1:28:08] even resemble itself but many years ago
[1:28:12] me as a backsliding kid in a pickup that
[1:28:15] slid off a highway held from falling to
[1:28:19] a several hundred foot Ravine by one
[1:28:22] rock
[1:28:25] I cannot help when I think about that
[1:28:29] but have
[1:28:31] emotion God cared enough for
[1:28:34] me to put that one ordained Rock brother
[1:28:38] Trevor the rock that was called to wedge
[1:28:41] itself against a tire to spare my
[1:28:47] life they hooked a chain on that pickup
[1:28:50] and they moved it not even an inch in
[1:28:53] the rock fell off in the
[1:28:55] canyon I tell you that rock was
[1:28:58] supernaturally set right there for me
[1:29:02] and I can remember as a boxid young man
[1:29:05] I can remember being so profoundly
[1:29:07] affected I thought oh my
[1:29:10] goodness Lord forgive me now I'm sad to
[1:29:13] say it didn't last I slid right back to
[1:29:15] where I was
[1:29:16] at but I'll tell you one thing I know
[1:29:20] the memory of what God did for me has
[1:29:24] never
[1:29:25] left he was on the scene my God was
[1:29:30] there for me can you say amen
[1:29:39] hallelujah okay calling Jesus on the
[1:29:41] scene I want to hurry up
[1:29:47] and
[1:29:49] Hallelujah notice let us remember he
[1:29:51] also created our bodies and won't our
[1:29:54] bodies have to obey him amen you
[1:29:58] surrender uh your thoughts to him
[1:30:01] Surrender Your Life to him Surrender

[1:30:09] and you can't quit drinking surrender
[1:30:11] that life to him and watch you'll drink
[1:30:13] no more if you're a habitual smoker and
[1:30:16] tried to give it up and can't do it Just

[1:30:20] Happens he'll make that body come back
[1:30:22] in subjection to to the word yes sir but
[1:30:25] you've got to surrender it to him you've
[1:30:28] got to believe him he made our bodies

[1:30:55] telling you Saints I want to drive this
[1:30:57] point home I have dealt with Believers
[1:31:01] that when you'd be talking to them they
[1:31:02] come to you about a situation and when
[1:31:04] you're talking to them they remind you
[1:31:07] but we have free moral
[1:31:09] agency what do you mean by
[1:31:12] that you have the privilege to go like

[1:33:46] life see that's a beauty of it my
[1:33:48] brother and
[1:33:51] sister I hope this is not too Direct
[1:33:55] seems like people brother Brown talks
[1:33:57] about it in the sermon why people are so
[1:33:59] tossed about but we are right here today
[1:34:02] people saying I don't know if I have the
[1:34:04] Holy Spirit I felt like I had it last
[1:34:06] Sunday I don't know if I have it no now
[1:34:09] my brother and sister what you've got to
[1:34:10] do is stop and say am I the same
[1:34:16] person that I
[1:34:21] was is my desire do i s sin and glory in
[1:34:26] it or the minute I say something wrong
[1:34:30] there something inside of me oh Lord
[1:34:33] forgive me start examining your life
[1:34:37] your reactions your actions because you
[1:34:42] see to come to the place we see Christ
[1:34:47] Living in
[1:34:49] us there's the place we're moving
[1:34:52] towards not our attendance not whether
[1:34:55] we can quote the message but Christ
[1:34:58] Living in
[1:35:01] Us and how do you exercise Faith
[1:35:05] muscles you don't do that my brother and
[1:35:07] sister sitting on the couch so to
[1:35:09] speak but exercise those Faith muscles
[1:35:13] that you can stand and when you're faced
[1:35:16] with the greatest trials and Satan
[1:35:18] speaking to you trying to lure you away
[1:35:22] you'll be able to be anointed to say it
[1:35:25] is written those won't just be words it
[1:35:29] will be the very Life of Christ in you
[1:35:33] speaking as Christ spoke my brother and
[1:35:36] sister this is part of the message this
[1:35:40] is the life that we come not to hold to
[1:35:45] Orthodoxy you know the message has its
[1:35:47] own
[1:35:50] Orthodoxy mhm but the prophet of God
[1:35:53] himself said
[1:35:54] Christ is moving on yeah he made a
[1:35:58] corner yes they
[1:36:00] didn't amen so we cannot take Orthodoxy
[1:36:04] in the human element and say this is it
[1:36:07] and you know I want to throw this
[1:36:08] spinner at you
[1:36:10] here what did the prophet mean when he
[1:36:12] said read between the
[1:36:17] lines come on we can interpret a lot of
[1:36:20] different ways I'm going to let you
[1:36:21] interpret it for yourself
[1:36:23] but when it comes to reading between the
[1:36:25] lines not it's not you and I figuring
[1:36:26] out what the prophet was trying to say
[1:36:28] it's in between the lines that the Holy
[1:36:31] Spirit speaks to
[1:36:32] you there's the place between the lines
[1:36:35] that it's you and Christ and the word
[1:36:39] amen that's where it is it's not us to
[1:36:41] insert print between the lines but it's
[1:36:45] the space and time for him to speak to
[1:36:49] us and we understand then what the word
[1:36:52] is speaking to the bride can I read one
[1:36:56] more
[1:36:58] quote at this point I'm only two minutes
[1:37:03] late
[1:37:06] amen now you
[1:37:11] see very end of his
[1:37:13] ministry the day that brother brandham
[1:37:16] preached this I would have been four
[1:37:18] years old
[1:37:24] is that right four years
[1:37:28] old I don't know what that means I just
[1:37:31] had to share
[1:37:34] it just a few days before Prophet goes
[1:37:37] off the scene he's preaching
[1:37:40] leadership and he says
[1:37:42] this Jesus alone can lead you to that
[1:37:45] eternal life there's no church no
[1:37:48] denomination no preacher no priest no
[1:37:51] nothing else can lead you to it you must
[1:37:54] be led by him the only one that can lead
[1:37:56] you could you imagine him leading you
[1:37:59] out of his
[1:38:01] word which that's him and if he is the
[1:38:05] word and you're a part of him won't you
[1:38:08] be part of the word yes amen are we part
[1:38:11] of the word amen this is the beauty of
[1:38:14] this my brother and sister we don't
[1:38:16] become just
[1:38:19] followers we become the word oh
[1:38:22] Hallelujah
[1:38:24] the word of God wants to pour the Waters
[1:38:26] of Salvation uh upon um today to
[1:38:31] identify him today like the apostles
[1:38:33] identified him like Luther like Wesley
[1:38:36] like in the people in the days
[1:38:37] identified him this another age it's the
[1:38:40] word the word said these things that
[1:38:42] we're seeing taking place now is
[1:38:44] predicted to take place in this hour so
[1:38:47] accept Jesus Christ and let him lead you
[1:38:51] to eternal life amen there's the
[1:38:55] confidence that we have that I can look
[1:38:57] at this and say it is written amen we
[1:39:01] have no other goal but the word leading
[1:39:05] us into eternal life not following a
[1:39:10] man not following a church not following
[1:39:13] a movement following the word now as we
[1:39:17] were doing I'm going to close on that
[1:39:19] sister VI if you would come
[1:39:21] please musicians
[1:39:24] you look at this my brother and sister
[1:39:26] this is just the start of the bride's
[1:39:29] Arsenal because you see if we don't have
[1:39:32] the word it won't matter all the other
[1:39:35] qualities that we might have we have to
[1:39:37] have the word and so part one the
[1:39:41] bride's Arsenal aren't you glad you know
[1:39:44] the old phrase sorry goes way back to
[1:39:47] whatever the bride's loaded for bear
[1:39:50] she's got everything she needs she's
[1:39:52] she's got you know just all kinds of
[1:39:55] weapons she's got all kinds of things
[1:39:57] and and she just walks with confidence
[1:40:00] and and She's Not Afraid how many of you
[1:40:02] are afraid of the
[1:40:06] dark nobody's Afraid of the Dark good
[1:40:10] [Laughter]
[1:40:12] good now I ask this is just very carnal
[1:40:16] motivated
[1:40:18] question if we're afraid of the dark do
[1:40:20] we feel better if we have a weapon
[1:40:25] I'm telling you you feel much
[1:40:30] better I can tell you my brother and
[1:40:32] sister as we close this out what it is
[1:40:36] and how it feels many years ago hunting
[1:40:39] with a friend very close to Hell's
[1:40:42] Canyon we were elk
[1:40:44] hunting and we would hunt till it was
[1:40:46] dark and then walk back to
[1:40:48] camp and we would cook our food in the
[1:40:51] dark and usually it was later than we
[1:40:53] wanted before we went to bed but we'd be
[1:40:57] there and I remember one night I'm
[1:40:59] laying
[1:41:00] there and uh I'm like you know I I feel
[1:41:04] comfortable I've got a I've got a
[1:41:06] pistol um anything would come
[1:41:11] around hope this isn't too personal but
[1:41:13] I woke up and I thought I I need to go
[1:41:16] outside and hide behind a
[1:41:18] tree and about that time we decided it
[1:41:22] had to be m M lion but out outside of
[1:41:26] our camp right there was
[1:41:35] this and with a
[1:41:38] gun I still didn't feel
[1:41:45] secure but I had to use the
[1:41:48] restroom and I thought it just passed by
[1:41:51] our camp it's fine and about that time
[1:41:54] this long scream
[1:41:57] Screech and I'm
[1:42:01] like go back to
[1:42:07] sleep the Lord spoke to
[1:42:11] me did I not
[1:42:16] say I am your
[1:42:19] Sanctuary I am your protection your

[1:42:40] camped in
[1:42:42] echoed and I was Lord I believe every
[1:42:44] word of it I believe every word of
[1:42:47] it and then there was one more
[1:42:51] scream and I I
