[34:38] you know
[34:40] let's stand
[34:43] and turn in our Bibles to Ephesians
[34:45] chapter 5.
[34:50] I was going to read a quote but I think
[34:52] I'm going to save it for another time
[34:54] Ephesians chapter five
[34:56] verse
[34:58] 14.
[35:01] I left the scriptures out so everyone
[35:04] had to turn in their Bibles
[35:07] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 14 to 33.
[35:15] wherefore he saith awake thou that
[35:17] sleepest and arise from the dead and
[35:19] Christ shall give thee light
[35:21] see then that you walk circumspectly not
[35:24] as fools but as wise
[35:27] Redeeming the time because the days are
[35:29] evil
[35:35] where wherefore be not unwise but
[35:38] understanding what the will of the Lord
[35:40] is and be not drunk with wine wherein is
[35:43] excess but be filled with the spirit
[35:45] speaking to yourselves in Psalms
[35:48] and hymns and spiritual songs singing
[35:51] and making melody in your heart to the
[35:53] Lord
[35:54] give giving thanks always for all things
[35:56] unto God and the father in the name of
[35:59] our Lord Jesus Christ
[36:01] submitting yourselves one to another in
[36:03] the fear of God that's powerheads
[36:06] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just ask
[36:08] that you would just be with us tonight
[36:10] Lord that you would speak to our hearts
[36:12] Lord Jesus that everything you have for
[36:14] us Lord would be delivered to our hearts
[36:17] Lord Jesus and that father you would
[36:19] just touch it with your presence and
[36:20] your anointing Lord father whereas if it
[36:23] is the words of God it will to do just
[36:25] that Lord may you remove all the words
[36:27] of man Lord it be only your words
[36:29] tonight we ask we love you Lord we thank
[36:32] you may you bind every spirit that will
[36:33] be hindrance Lord tonight in the name of
[36:36] Jesus Christ we pray amen
[36:39] amen you may be seated
[36:43] this screen still isn't
[36:46] working
[36:47] okay
[36:49] all right
[36:51] well we will try to uh
[36:55] to uh
[36:56] work off the iPad and that
[36:59] um so we are in verse 22.
[37:03] Ephesians chapter five now
[37:05] um tonight I'm going to do something a
[37:07] little bit differently with the with
[37:09] Ephesians 5 verse 22.
[37:12] um I'm first of all I'm going to ask you
[37:13] to
[37:14] did you forget the jokes
[37:17] and I'm gonna speak I'm gonna speak to
[37:20] to this is going to be uh directed
[37:23] towards and see if this is working here
[37:26] is this one working
[37:29] it's turned on
[37:33] okay go go to the title slide we're
[37:35] gonna
[37:36] praise the Lord we're gonna labor
[37:38] through this I guess
[37:46] okay well
[37:48] the devil's mad
[37:50] so we're going to speak on tonight the
[37:53] balanced home and I wanted to take the
[37:55] subject of the man's position
[37:57] and so you think well why are we reading
[38:00] why submit yourselves unto your own
[38:02] husbands as unto the Lord in verse 22
[38:04] because we're going to take and we're
[38:05] going to use that to look at where a
[38:07] man's position is now we as as
[38:10] Christians as message Believers we we're
[38:12] all are very excited about the bride and
[38:14] the bride being in her position
[38:17] and in doing so we we leave and we we
[38:21] push into evangelism to to get people
[38:23] excited and to get to to preach the Deep
[38:26] things of the message and the Seven
[38:27] Seals and all of these things but did
[38:30] you know that if your home is not in
[38:32] Balance according to the word of God you
[38:34] will never be in your position
[38:36] I don't care how much you know about the
[38:38] Bible I don't care how much about the
[38:40] prophet about the message if your home
[38:42] is not balanced according to the word of
[38:44] God
[38:45] you will never be in your position as
[38:47] the bride of Christ
[38:49] home life is not just for Dr Dobson or
[38:52] Gary Chapman home life is for Christians
[38:55] and God has has set forth very clearly
[38:58] in his word exactly how that should look
[39:01] at it look like now you look at me and
[39:03] especially since I shave them looking a
[39:05] lot younger you think wow what would you
[39:07] know well I'm going to ask you to to to
[39:10] to Journey with me because I am learning
[39:13] and I'm sharing with you what I've
[39:15] learned I don't know everything
[39:17] over the past few years my wife and I
[39:19] have labored and we have uh in in tears
[39:22] prayers and frustrations and sometimes
[39:25] tears how do we raise our children how
[39:28] do we
[39:30] model our home towards the word of God
[39:33] how do we
[39:34] have that family
[39:36] whose children love to be at home who
[39:38] who they they they love Mom and Dad they
[39:40] they want and this perfect harmony
[39:44] according to the scriptures
[39:45] we we heard of different different
[39:47] classes for raising kids that we tried
[39:50] and we got some good things but we
[39:52] always come to a point where we said
[39:54] well this this isn't it
[39:57] and so God began to deal with my heart
[39:59] and he and he spoke to her and he said
[40:01] just start preaching it
[40:04] and you think well that's that's a bit
[40:06] foolish Chris like don't you think you
[40:08] ought to know it before you preach it
[40:09] well actually you preach as a minister
[40:11] we all have a Ministry You Preach where
[40:13] you live
[40:15] so as I study this to minister it I'm
[40:19] taking it and I'm applying it to my home
[40:22] so it's been a rough past few days
[40:25] because the devil knew we were going to
[40:27] preach this tonight
[40:28] so
[40:29] the lord loves everything in balance and
[40:31] I have a couple scriptures here you just
[40:33] forgive me and you can just leave it on
[40:35] this slide these were after thoughts
[40:37] um and it's in Proverbs 16 verse 11 if
[40:40] you want to jump over there with me just
[40:42] one little verse here
[40:45] Proverbs 16 verse 11.
[40:49] it says adjust Weight and Balance are
[40:52] the Lords so
[40:54] the Lord really likes a balance now in
[40:59] this picture
[41:00] you have the left side and the right
[41:01] side of the road and you have the center
[41:03] lane okay now we understand cars you
[41:04] know you go in One Direction you you
[41:06] drive on the right side you're going the
[41:07] other direction driving the left side
[41:08] but God's road is one way
[41:11] did you know that God's Road's one way
[41:13] so we walk the center line on God's Road
[41:17] and you you never have the whole road
[41:19] unless you have the far left and you
[41:22] have the far right
[41:24] so in this scripture here it says
[41:28] um
[41:28] it just went in the balance of the
[41:30] Lord's all the weights of the bag are
[41:33] his work now Solomon is referencing the
[41:36] law of Moses that talks about a man and
[41:39] you shouldn't carry uh uneven weights in
[41:41] a bag
[41:42] just even weights are in the bag that's
[41:45] what the Lord told them in the Mosaic
[41:47] law so Solomon's referencing that but
[41:49] he's saying hey God loves a balance
[41:52] but all the weights are in the hand of
[41:55] God
[41:56] the far left and the far right are in
[41:59] the hands of God the devil is in the
[42:01] hands of God so God uses all of these to
[42:05] build this robe that we're walking down
[42:08] go with me back to Ephesians chapter 5
[42:10] verse 22.
[42:13] it says wife submit yourselves unto your
[42:15] own husbands as unto the Lord so
[42:19] this is not about a man having control
[42:22] this is not about the men controlling
[42:25] but this is some this is to mirror your
[42:28] relationship with God
[42:30] and
[42:32] even though it's our subject man's
[42:34] position every
[42:36] every man every boy every woman every
[42:39] girl should understand a man's position
[42:41] because if you know a man's position you
[42:43] know when a man's not in position
[42:46] you can either pray for him or you can
[42:48] say
[42:49] um
[42:51] you talk to my pastor before you talk to
[42:53] me right
[42:54] so in verse 23 4 the husband is the head
[42:58] of the wife even as Christ is the head
[43:00] of the church and he is the savior of
[43:02] the body now I want you to forget
[43:04] message culture
[43:07] the husband is not the um the uh with an
[43:10] iron fist you I am in charge of this
[43:12] home you will do as I say that is not at
[43:15] all what a man's position is let's
[43:18] finish the scripture we're never going
[43:19] to get to where we're going tonight
[43:22] therefore even as Christ is the head of
[43:24] the church so in other words the husband
[43:25] is the head of the wife as the Christ is
[43:28] the head of the church see too many
[43:30] times we separated we say oh there's God
[43:33] and there's
[43:34] me as a man or there's God and there's
[43:36] my husband but it's the same
[43:39] relationship
[43:41] the same it should be the same that's
[43:43] the man's position so Christ is the
[43:45] perfect example therefore as the church
[43:47] is subject unto Christ so let the wives
[43:49] be to their own husbands and in
[43:51] everything and and you don't have to be
[43:53] married to be in your position as a
[43:55] woman
[43:57] right okay there was headship in your
[43:59] life whether it's your father your
[44:00] grandfather your uncle your whatever it
[44:02] is there's different men that got places
[44:04] in your life for you to be for them to
[44:07] be your headship so husbands love your
[44:09] wives even as Christ also loved the
[44:11] church and gave himself for it that he
[44:14] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[44:16] washing of the Water by the word now can
[44:20] you take me to the um
[44:23] the first quote
[44:25] now brother Brown says here when you
[44:28] when you take a man that's now this is a
[44:31] bit funny
[44:33] but I don't um we don't mean it as such
[44:35] but
[44:39] hang on
[44:47] so he says when you take a man that's so
[44:50] sisified
[44:51] he may all right be balanced up all
[44:54] right now what he's saying is he may
[44:55] look everything like a man
[44:57] but there's something wrong and when you
[44:59] take a woman and wants to chop her hair
[45:01] and wear a pair of overalls and get out
[45:03] there and God bless I'll tell you
[45:04] there's something wrong A woman has the
[45:07] I only I bring this quote in here to
[45:09] show you that a woman and a man have
[45:10] their position a woman has a feminist
[45:12] spirit and a man is masculine we know
[45:14] that and you know that does a woman look
[45:17] right tries to be act like a man so in
[45:19] other words
[45:19] he it's not just because you know none
[45:22] of your sisters are wearing overalls and
[45:24] out there saying you know bless God I'll
[45:26] tell you right because that's what he
[45:27] says if you listen to him none of you
[45:29] guys are none of you you are doing that
[45:32] but it's not just those things you know
[45:35] sometimes we take uh things a little bit
[45:38] too literal and we say well well I'm not
[45:40] doing that but we're doing something on
[45:42] the other side here you can act like a
[45:43] man without wearing ever wearing
[45:44] overalls or ever cutting your hair
[45:46] you can have a masculine spirit so men
[45:49] men can have a feminist spirit
[45:52] they just you know
[45:54] their pushover all right they're too
[45:56] soft that kind of thing but a man is
[45:58] supposed to be a man but a man
[46:01] who's a real man of God
[46:04] is not cruel
[46:06] he's not a bully
[46:08] he's not rough
[46:10] oh he's roughing Rough and Tumble you
[46:12] know with the boys that kind of thing
[46:14] he's tough
[46:16] but he's not a brute he's not a beast
[46:21] that was for the Apes we were the next
[46:24] step
[46:25] so next slide
[46:29] now one thing that we know and we've
[46:31] been Faithfully taught here is that our
[46:33] position
[46:34] is our strength
[46:38] your position in the word of God
[46:41] directly correlates to your position in
[46:45] the home
[46:48] you see it let's not separate them
[46:51] anymore
[46:53] they're the same thing
[46:55] the home should be the word of God we
[46:59] don't have church and and the message
[47:01] and and dad's not sitting in the corner
[47:03] with headphones and never teaching the
[47:05] kids and he's just you know listening to
[47:07] the tapes he's out of balance that's
[47:09] that's not in the home
[47:12] and the wife is stewing in the corner
[47:15] saying well you know well no it's it's a
[47:18] balance and when it's balanced it's a
[47:20] beautiful Harmony
[47:25] so
[47:26] next slide
[47:28] so Christ's leadership now
[47:32] when it says that the husband is the
[47:33] head it means the husband is the leader
[47:38] that's what headship is headship is
[47:40] leadership if if it's anything but if
[47:43] it's anything outside of love it's
[47:46] dictatorship y'all want to go down to uh
[47:49] Venezuela
[47:51] now none of us none of us say hey sign
[47:54] me up or go to a dictator's country
[47:56] right it's control husband doesn't
[47:59] control the wife husband doesn't control
[48:01] the children as a as a man if you try to
[48:04] control your environment
[48:09] you breed rebellion in your environment
[48:13] Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft so
[48:15] your your kids aren't listening to you
[48:17] or or or or things are going right your
[48:19] wife you know she she's not she's not
[48:21] you know doing what you want her to do
[48:23] you don't you don't get after your wife
[48:26] you say okay
[48:28] I'm not leading in the right direction
[48:31] I'm leading in the wrong direction
[48:33] leadership is applying the word to your
[48:36] home
[48:37] not just to yourself it's not about us
[48:39] anymore
[48:41] it's not about us at one point in time
[48:43] we were single it was about us
[48:47] we serve God we made sure we were taken
[48:49] care of you know it was easy right took
[48:50] a nap when you want
[48:52] wherever you want when you want you're
[48:54] free of responsibility
[48:56] but then you take on this position as a
[48:59] man of a home
[49:00] now everything stops with you
[49:06] everything should be there is never a
[49:08] good reason as a man
[49:11] to raise your voice
[49:13] and yell
[49:14] and I'm probably the worst offender
[49:17] there's a never now I'm not talking
[49:18] about emergencies don't get too literal
[49:20] I mean in your home when you're dealing
[49:22] with your home you sh there's never a
[49:24] good reason to raise your voice if
[49:25] you're raising your voice you waited too
[49:28] long if it's if it's a situation with
[49:32] your children and you're raising your
[49:33] voice it's because you've lost patience
[49:35] because you didn't act soon enough
[49:39] Sometimes the best thing you can do is
[49:40] say you know what you go sit on your bed
[49:42] in your room I'm gonna go take five
[49:44] minutes and then we're gonna deal with
[49:45] this
[49:48] you don't need to raise your voice
[49:50] you know the the big thing in the world
[49:52] is is the the alpha male Like the Wolf
[49:54] right
[49:55] and uh guy you know guys young guys love
[49:58] that yeah like post a Howling Wolf on
[50:00] their Instagram and say you know
[50:02] forget the haters it's the Lone Wolf
[50:04] right but all of the all of the
[50:07] information that Maine Society knows
[50:09] about wolves actually was completely
[50:10] proved to be wrong because the original
[50:12] studies was of a wolf pack in
[50:15] captivity and the studies was yeah you
[50:18] know the strongest wolf comes in kicks
[50:19] out the other wolf and takes over the
[50:21] pack
[50:22] and then these guys decided to go and
[50:24] study wolves in the will in the
[50:25] wilderness for like 10 20 years or more
[50:28] and they found out everything they knew
[50:30] about was completely wrong a wolf pack
[50:32] is a family
[50:34] the alpha male is Dad guess what dad
[50:36] eats last in the wolf pack
[50:39] he makes sure the kids and his wife have
[50:41] the food that they need first then he
[50:43] eats
[50:45] you see when when it's like hey that's
[50:47] Dad's food that's control
[50:49] that's communism
[50:52] do you want a socialistic household or
[50:54] did you want to do you want a democracy
[50:56] actually brother says the best thing is
[50:58] a good King
[50:59] a good God-fearing King and that's what
[51:01] you want to be you want to be the king
[51:01] of your home
[51:04] okay you don't need um
[51:06] we don't want to get flagged
[51:08] um
[51:11] so
[51:12] next slide
[51:15] John 10 verse 1 to 5.
[51:23] John 10
[51:26] one to five
[51:28] really really I say unto you he that
[51:30] interest not by the door into the
[51:32] Sheepfold but climeth up some other way
[51:34] the same as a thief and Robber but he
[51:37] that interest in by the door is The
[51:39] Shepherd of the sheep so he's got
[51:41] nothing to hide right because he's a
[51:42] Shepherd to him that the Porter openeth
[51:45] and the sheep hear his voice and he'd
[51:47] call his own Sheep by name and Lead it
[51:49] them out and when he puteth forth his
[51:51] own sheep he goeth before them and the
[51:53] Sheep follow him for they know his voice
[51:56] and a stranger will they not follow but
[51:58] will flee from him for they know not the
[52:01] voice of strangers
[52:04] okay that's the last verse so
[52:07] Christ
[52:08] is the best example there is
[52:11] next slide
[52:14] he is he says he says I am the Good
[52:17] Shepherd
[52:18] and know my sheep and have known of mine
[52:21] now in Ephesians 5 it says just stay on
[52:25] that slide there Ephesians 5 it says
[52:27] um
[52:29] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[52:31] also love the church the husband is the
[52:33] head of the wife as Christ is the head
[52:35] of the church okay so you don't have to
[52:37] have very much deductive reasoning or
[52:39] very much common sense to realize that
[52:40] the husband should mirror Christ in how
[52:43] he conducts how he takes care of his
[52:45] home how he leads
[52:48] okay you wanna you wanna you know if
[52:50] you're in the business world and you
[52:51] want to be a good leader you read books
[52:53] about leadership and you lead read books
[52:55] uh written about leadership by people
[52:58] who show leadership
[53:00] okay one of the most popular persons
[53:02] today is Jocko willink he was uh he was
[53:04] a Seal Team Six he was a he was a uh I
[53:07] don't know captain or whatever
[53:09] but
[53:10] you read from men who have experience
[53:12] right Christ
[53:14] has the most experience
[53:17] ever ever right he's Eternal so he's
[53:20] already known how a home should go be
[53:23] way before there ever were homes
[53:27] by the way at home is not a house
[53:29] a home is in a house
[53:31] now sometimes like I said it's it's all
[53:35] in balance
[53:36] it's all in Balance so so you gotta you
[53:39] know a man's position could be is to
[53:41] provide for his family but if all he
[53:43] does is work
[53:46] he's out of balance
[53:49] so you know there there's a few
[53:51] different there's a few different
[53:52] building blocks to a marriage
[53:54] one of them is financial but if if all
[53:56] you do is focus on financial you neglect
[53:59] the spiritual emotional physical
[54:02] well-being of your family
[54:06] so it's it's in the balance so we want
[54:08] to know well what's the best way what
[54:10] what what is man's position now man's
[54:13] position is in the home and in the
[54:15] church and in the community so whether
[54:19] you're married or you're single or
[54:21] you're not married yet it doesn't matter
[54:22] this sermon applies to you whether
[54:24] you're a man or a woman
[54:26] you sisters need to know this
[54:29] because here's here's where the devil
[54:31] likes to slip in he came up with this
[54:33] really cool thing and you've heard me
[54:34] talk about it called the news feed
[54:39] so mainstream media doesn't understand
[54:43] the balance of a man and a woman they
[54:45] don't
[54:46] they don't
[54:48] so if you're not careful
[54:51] as a woman you begin to think
[54:54] this is how a man should act
[54:57] this is how a man should be
[55:00] okay
[55:01] you read books about men romance novels
[55:05] right there are certain ones that are
[55:07] okay you know
[55:10] but if you're not if if you are getting
[55:13] the wrong impression of a man then you
[55:16] meet a boy or you're already married you
[55:19] look at your husband and say why are you
[55:20] being so rude and rough
[55:23] when he's in his position and you're not
[55:27] because you have the wrong perspective
[55:29] of what a man should be so you need to
[55:31] know what a man's position is in the
[55:33] Bible just as much as you need to know
[55:35] what your position as a woman is
[55:39] because position is what
[55:43] strength
[55:45] you want to be a strong Christian he's
[55:47] coming to church and you and you you're
[55:49] reading the seals book and you're
[55:51] reading the church age book
[55:52] and
[55:54] nothing your life is struggling
[55:57] your home
[55:58] where are you at home
[56:00] our pastor just said well I think it was
[56:02] Sunday you know what what do you do
[56:03] Monday this is Monday this sermon is
[56:06] Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[56:08] Saturday Sunday
[56:10] that's what this is
[56:13] and this is God's word none of this is
[56:16] mine
[56:17] this is God's word and and and and so if
[56:20] we're not too careful we focus on that
[56:22] and we we neglect our home
[56:26] preach to me the seals
[56:29] talk to me about the seal I use the
[56:31] seals because you know it's around the
[56:33] message message culture again you know
[56:35] it's considered the highest right
[56:37] at least that's how I would I the circle
[56:40] that I grew up in looked at it that way
[56:41] okay I mean really because Christ is
[56:43] that but Christ is the seal so you want
[56:46] the seals opened your home
[56:50] that means dad sometimes you put the
[56:53] kids to bed
[56:55] guess what
[56:56] your that comforter to your wife
[57:00] you're helping your wife you just
[57:02] fulfilled the seven seal
[57:04] because you were acting like Christ
[57:07] you see there there's some things in in
[57:09] that we're taught in the met in the in
[57:12] the Bible that you can't necessarily put
[57:14] a b c d
[57:16] as a checklist
[57:18] not every time
[57:20] is it right
[57:22] you know you can't expect your husband
[57:23] to put the kids to bed every single
[57:25] night there's things that he has to be
[57:27] doing that are his position
[57:29] but it's a balance you say oh well you
[57:31] got to do everything and then you just
[57:33] sit on the couch
[57:36] now
[57:37] as a man you got to sit on the couch
[57:39] sometimes we work hard
[57:43] you see when a man is sitting because
[57:45] the Bible in Proverbs 31 it says the uh
[57:49] the husband
[57:50] okay you know what I'm gonna botch it so
[57:52] let's just
[57:54] proverbs 31.
[58:08] her husband is known in the gates when
[58:10] he sitteth among the Elders of the land
[58:16] so if we're not careful
[58:19] okay
[58:23] I I have seen relationships where the
[58:25] man
[58:27] goes too far
[58:28] to be helpful
[58:30] and he's not where we need him
[58:36] okay
[58:37] so men make sure that you're in the
[58:39] balance
[58:40] if you're if you have a duty in the
[58:42] church
[58:42] on a Sunday on a Wednesday
[58:45] you need to be in that Duty
[58:49] your wife should be taking care of the
[58:51] children because you are in you are
[58:53] working you were into you can't take
[58:55] your kids to the job site you can't have
[58:57] your kid sitting on a lap and you're at
[58:58] your home when you're on a meeting
[59:00] you need to be focused on what you're
[59:02] doing because guess what if you're not
[59:03] focused on that you're out of your
[59:05] position and your home life and your
[59:07] family they start to fall apart because
[59:09] your children and your wife forget your
[59:12] position
[59:13] and it's your fault
[59:16] sometimes we have to look at our wife
[59:18] and she's upset we have to say
[59:20] sweetheart
[59:21] can't do that right now I've got to take
[59:23] care of this
[59:25] In Love sometimes even in love with with
[59:27] the right attitude she might be a little
[59:29] bit upset
[59:30] but you're not telling her get out of
[59:32] here you're you're talking in love
[59:36] okay
[59:37] ologist so happy tonight
[59:40] next slide
[59:43] so a man's role or his position next
[59:45] slide
[59:47] so the man is The Shepherd of the home
[59:53] now when when a shepherd
[59:55] takes the Sheep somewhere
[59:57] he doesn't
[59:59] he leads them
[1:00:02] he's the ship the Sheep they don't know
[1:00:06] where the best grass is
[1:00:08] the shepherd does Shepherd says Hey the
[1:00:10] grass looks good over here eat over here
[1:00:12] and guess what what's the classic
[1:00:14] example the Sheep eating under the fence
[1:00:19] so sometimes you know their family gets
[1:00:22] to looking over
[1:00:23] the classic word the Joneses
[1:00:26] and they think well why can't we be like
[1:00:27] that
[1:00:29] so one some of the hardest times that I
[1:00:31] have to deal with as a husband as a
[1:00:34] father is when my kids come to me and
[1:00:36] they want to do something and I say no
[1:00:38] we don't do that and they ask me why
[1:00:40] they do it and they is somebody in the
[1:00:44] church
[1:00:47] that's really really hard
[1:00:50] but Dad we have to do that
[1:00:54] we are not raising we are not
[1:00:57] responsible
[1:00:58] for those other children
[1:01:02] can have compassion because I had to
[1:01:04] live that growing up
[1:01:06] that was the pastor
[1:01:10] this group wasn't
[1:01:11] super great
[1:01:13] they had all the fun
[1:01:15] without me
[1:01:18] but I thank God today that my parents
[1:01:20] said no
[1:01:21] because none of them serve God
[1:01:24] that's not a boast on me that is not a
[1:01:26] boss on anything that is
[1:01:28] my father was in his position when it
[1:01:31] came to that situation he knew there are
[1:01:34] boundaries and there are limits and
[1:01:36] guess what I felt safe at home
[1:01:38] and on the subject of control since we
[1:01:40] since we have some older youth here
[1:01:43] one time I was out with with my friends
[1:01:46] who were not believers they were most of
[1:01:48] them were good there was One Bad Apple
[1:01:51] says about that
[1:01:54] and uh good Christian boys except for
[1:01:56] one
[1:01:57] but we were out and and I stayed out
[1:02:00] late it wasn't even that late I got home
[1:02:02] at like 11 30.
[1:02:04] and
[1:02:06] we were hanging out more so than I ever
[1:02:08] had before and I was I I was enjoying
[1:02:11] myself this is cool hanging out with the
[1:02:13] boys you know there were some dirty
[1:02:15] jokes that happened
[1:02:17] I'm guilty
[1:02:18] and I came home not to my dad calling me
[1:02:22] or yelling at me when I walked in the
[1:02:24] door he was just sitting in his chair
[1:02:26] he's normally a couple hours already in
[1:02:28] bed I walk in the door and he's just
[1:02:30] sitting in his chair waiting for me
[1:02:34] and he said hey hey Chris I hate that
[1:02:36] he's like good night love you God if I
[1:02:38] went to bed
[1:02:39] that had more effect on me
[1:02:42] than him standing up and saying what
[1:02:44] were you doing out so late because I was
[1:02:46] convicted
[1:02:48] because he showed me he knew
[1:02:51] what was going on where I was
[1:02:54] and that's it I never did it again
[1:02:58] because I didn't want to
[1:03:00] ever have to see that
[1:03:03] do that again right he was leading by
[1:03:06] example
[1:03:09] you will the Bible says
[1:03:12] wives submit yourselves unto the
[1:03:15] husbands not husbands make your wife
[1:03:16] submit
[1:03:18] okay next slide
[1:03:21] now
[1:03:22] um desperation says now how can you have
[1:03:25] faith in your wife if you don't love her
[1:03:26] that's infilio you know sometimes you
[1:03:28] have to put a little few more sentences
[1:03:30] in the quotes to get the context now how
[1:03:32] about Agape to God how can it be if you
[1:03:35] don't love him now here's where I want
[1:03:37] to get to you if you said you love your
[1:03:38] wife and never tell her about it and
[1:03:41] never sit down and make love to her
[1:03:43] express it to her kiss her hug her and
[1:03:46] tell her she's the best cook in the
[1:03:48] country and all the things that you know
[1:03:51] and how pretty she is and how much you
[1:03:53] love her if you don't do that she'll
[1:03:56] never know it
[1:04:00] that's the way if you do love her you
[1:04:03] express it
[1:04:05] you can't say oh I'm not a touchy kind
[1:04:07] of guy I'm not no sorry
[1:04:11] you gotta get rid of that guy
[1:04:13] you need to
[1:04:14] love your wife Solomon says ravish her
[1:04:19] how to make you a little bit
[1:04:20] uncomfortable
[1:04:23] take her behind the door right
[1:04:27] okay
[1:04:29] she is your sweetheart
[1:04:32] see them boys are sneaking her in the
[1:04:34] back but they'll remember this one day
[1:04:35] when they're married and they'll
[1:04:36] appreciate me for saying it
[1:04:41] she's your sweetheart you put passion
[1:04:43] into loving her
[1:04:46] it's not enough to provide a home it's
[1:04:48] not enough to help with the kids it's
[1:04:50] not enough to to to help in the kitchen
[1:04:52] once in a while but the man did
[1:04:54] she told him get out of there you know
[1:04:57] so you don't have to make it a habit
[1:05:00] I'm just kidding
[1:05:02] it's not enough to do those things
[1:05:05] it's because you have to balance all of
[1:05:08] it
[1:05:09] now I didn't let me see if I can pull
[1:05:11] this up really quick I always
[1:05:13] forget directly how to say this quote
[1:05:16] but Theodore Roosevelt
[1:05:18] he said I wish to preach not the
[1:05:21] doctrine of
[1:05:24] ignable ease
[1:05:27] but the doctrine of the strenuous life
[1:05:33] now
[1:05:34] it's
[1:05:35] a lot of work and very strenuous
[1:05:38] sometimes to Hold Your Position
[1:05:43] if you many times there's stories of
[1:05:46] heroic events in battle that were just
[1:05:49] simply
[1:05:50] the soldiers held their position
[1:05:56] they didn't get in they didn't push
[1:05:58] forward they held their position
[1:06:01] and it gave the victory
[1:06:03] the same thing happens in your family
[1:06:06] when if you take this and Lord willing
[1:06:09] will will do a few parts
[1:06:11] and you start to apply this word not my
[1:06:13] words the word of God to your home guess
[1:06:15] what it's going to cause strife
[1:06:19] it's going to cause problems because the
[1:06:22] devil says say what
[1:06:26] and you're going to want to run to to
[1:06:28] YouTube and run to the movies but put a
[1:06:31] movie on not run to the movie theater
[1:06:33] right you're going to want to escape and
[1:06:35] say well just I'm just too tired today
[1:06:37] I'm sorry
[1:06:40] we're not allowed to be too tired to
[1:06:42] serve God right
[1:06:44] we must gird ourselves up to for the
[1:06:46] battle every day correct we have no
[1:06:49] problem as Believers talking about that
[1:06:51] but
[1:06:53] as husbands and fathers we say well I'm
[1:06:56] just too tired today
[1:07:00] you're not taking care of your family
[1:07:01] you're not in your position
[1:07:04] because you're too tired no we We Don't
[1:07:07] Preach the doctrine of ease but of the
[1:07:10] strenuous life
[1:07:12] God has called us to a battle and that
[1:07:15] includes
[1:07:16] taking care of your home
[1:07:18] now that doesn't mean as a man you have
[1:07:20] to stand on your feet 24 7.
[1:07:24] but that means in your position holding
[1:07:27] your position
[1:07:30] and
[1:07:31] wives
[1:07:33] you should help him in that position
[1:07:37] you should want him to stay in that
[1:07:40] position
[1:07:41] you should when you see him starting in
[1:07:44] his position because you're going to
[1:07:45] know what his position is
[1:07:47] you gotta stand behind him and say you
[1:07:50] got it
[1:07:52] even though that might mean things
[1:07:54] change for you
[1:07:57] you gotta say you got it and you push in
[1:08:00] with him
[1:08:05] the Lord puts a lot of
[1:08:08] emphasis on marriage marriage is the
[1:08:11] oldest
[1:08:13] is it institution or Constitution
[1:08:15] institution marriage is the oldest
[1:08:18] institution in the world it just sounds
[1:08:19] weird to use that word there but
[1:08:22] it is God started Genesis chapter 2
[1:08:24] verse 15.
[1:08:29] and the Lord God took the man and put
[1:08:31] him into the Garden of Eden I don't have
[1:08:32] it in the slides and dressed to dress it
[1:08:34] and keep it
[1:08:35] and the Lord came out of the man saying
[1:08:37] hey you know here's the trees Verse 18
[1:08:39] and the Lord God said it is not good
[1:08:40] that man should be alone I will make him
[1:08:42] and help me for him
[1:08:44] and out of the ground the Lord God
[1:08:46] formed every beast of the field
[1:08:48] Adam name them verse 21 and Lord God
[1:08:50] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[1:08:53] and he slept and took one of his ribs
[1:08:56] and close up the flesh instead thereof
[1:09:01] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[1:09:03] from the man made he a woman and brought
[1:09:07] her unto the man now there's a very
[1:09:09] important
[1:09:10] point to that scripture
[1:09:15] and this Ruffles feathers sometimes
[1:09:21] so I say this in complete love
[1:09:22] because I want you as sisters in this
[1:09:25] church as a minister
[1:09:27] associate Minister here I'm responsible
[1:09:31] that you be the best
[1:09:33] you can be
[1:09:36] you are part of man you come from man
[1:09:41] you cannot do it on your own
[1:09:45] you have to have leadership
[1:09:49] Brothers
[1:09:51] do you realize the responsibility you
[1:09:54] have
[1:09:55] when a woman cannot even be
[1:09:58] her full potential without the
[1:10:01] leadership of a man
[1:10:05] and you can be single you can be your
[1:10:07] father or it can be another another you
[1:10:10] know figure in your life but it's
[1:10:12] leadership
[1:10:18] you cannot come to your full potential
[1:10:20] without the leadership of a man because
[1:10:22] you come from man
[1:10:26] foreign
[1:10:30] see this isn't a run the aisles kind of
[1:10:32] service so don't worry I'm not expecting
[1:10:34] it uh next slide
[1:10:37] so we just read that quote where brother
[1:10:39] Adam says you got to tell her how pretty
[1:10:41] she is you got to tell her what a good
[1:10:42] cook she is
[1:10:44] you know don't critique your wife's
[1:10:46] cooking
[1:10:49] in the right moment you sneak in and
[1:10:51] you've seasoned it a little bit more
[1:10:55] tell her it's the best thing you ever
[1:10:56] had
[1:10:58] because then
[1:11:00] should be like well I don't know what do
[1:11:02] you think can make it better right then
[1:11:04] there might be a discussion okay but
[1:11:05] don't just tell your wife you know I had
[1:11:07] a young couple we were we were visiting
[1:11:09] them and they're freshly married and and
[1:11:11] he asked me he said he said he asked me
[1:11:14] about that and I started laughing I was
[1:11:16] like I was like bro no
[1:11:20] and he didn't like my answer it was
[1:11:22] funny he did he was he was like what's
[1:11:24] the problem see Man versus women now
[1:11:27] you're coming together you totally do
[1:11:29] two different viewpoints I told the
[1:11:31] young people on Sunday morning
[1:11:32] the best mirror you can have is marriage
[1:11:35] you say wow I act like that
[1:11:38] so love communicated is love received
[1:11:45] not love in a box love communicated
[1:11:50] is love received it could be a box of
[1:11:53] chocolates it could be a kiss on the
[1:11:55] lips a kiss on the cheek a little hug it
[1:11:57] could be a little date
[1:12:04] you see
[1:12:06] it could be a little washing of the
[1:12:07] dishes I'll put the kids to bed tonight
[1:12:10] love communicated there's a whole
[1:12:13] spectrum of how we receive love
[1:12:19] love communicated is love received
[1:12:22] and that's a that is a two-way street
[1:12:26] next slide
[1:12:29] in uh time-tested Memorials of God
[1:12:32] and it was talking about men losing
[1:12:34] their affections for their wife and they
[1:12:36] don't love them as they did when they
[1:12:37] were sweethearts shame on you you ought
[1:12:40] to do it she's always your sweetheart
[1:12:42] absolutely
[1:12:43] that's the part she should be and you
[1:12:46] should treat her like that oh never let
[1:12:48] that little honeymoon cease because it
[1:12:51] isn't going to in heaven going to be
[1:12:54] just perfectly one there
[1:12:57] he says again in the same sermon I don't
[1:12:59] know if I put it right there yet and we
[1:13:01] should never forget to honor each other
[1:13:03] now I'm talking about husband and wife
[1:13:05] honor each other always be sweethearts
[1:13:07] never let it cease
[1:13:10] you don't chew your sweetheart out
[1:13:14] you buy her flowers
[1:13:17] even if she says no don't
[1:13:21] don't bother
[1:13:23] the best thing I learned when she says
[1:13:24] don't that's what she wants it the most
[1:13:31] so next slide just so before I so I know
[1:13:34] where I'm at okay
[1:13:36] so back to the scripture here it's not
[1:13:38] husbands make your wife submit hurry up
[1:13:40] make their wives no it's it's wives
[1:13:42] submit yourselves unto your own husbands
[1:13:44] as unto the Lord
[1:13:47] so it's to God when you submit your
[1:13:49] heart and you give your heart to your
[1:13:50] husband you're giving it to to God
[1:13:52] okay submission now if you look up in
[1:13:55] the concordance strong concordance and
[1:13:57] you pull up the word submit in the
[1:13:58] scripture
[1:14:00] it this word submission here is is a
[1:14:03] Greek word and it's a military term
[1:14:05] meaning to arrange a troop divisions in
[1:14:09] a military fashion under the command of
[1:14:11] a leader in non-military use it was it
[1:14:14] was a voluntary attitude of giving in
[1:14:16] cooperating assuming responsibility and
[1:14:20] carrying a burden
[1:14:23] that's what submission is do you see any
[1:14:25] part in there that says
[1:14:28] you're the servant you're the slave
[1:14:34] she's not your slave
[1:14:37] you are her leader and that's a
[1:14:39] voluntary when it says wives submit is
[1:14:41] saying wives
[1:14:43] give in
[1:14:46] cooperate assume the responsibility of
[1:14:51] your position and carry the burden
[1:14:55] so the yoke is easy
[1:14:57] and the burden is lied
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:01] because it's God's position so as soon
[1:15:03] as you do this everything becomes easier
[1:15:05] in the home and husbands you have to if
[1:15:09] this isn't how your home is working
[1:15:10] right now you have to pull that out
[1:15:15] maybe there's a part of you that's not
[1:15:17] lined up with the word of God because if
[1:15:19] if the man is not subject to God
[1:15:23] his wife will never be in submission to
[1:15:26] him
[1:15:28] and the children are underneath the
[1:15:30] submission of the
[1:15:32] father and mother
[1:15:34] the the the continuity of the family the
[1:15:37] harmony of the home will never be there
[1:15:39] the ballots of the home will never be
[1:15:41] there unless dad is submitted to God now
[1:15:45] the wife can serve God still
[1:15:48] right but the home will be out of
[1:15:51] balance
[1:15:53] unless the man is in his position
[1:15:59] is submitted to God because who's our
[1:16:02] best example our best example is Christ
[1:16:04] right
[1:16:07] and what did what did Christ have to say
[1:16:09] about
[1:16:11] being in submissive being in submission
[1:16:16] to the Lord to Christ
[1:16:21] hang on here
[1:16:25] he said he was bound to the will of the
[1:16:28] father he walked into the pool of
[1:16:30] Bethesda I think it was if I got the
[1:16:32] wrong name forgive me he walked into
[1:16:34] there
[1:16:36] he could have healed everybody
[1:16:38] but we classic story we all know this
[1:16:40] but he didn't he went to the one person
[1:16:42] the one man and healed him of his
[1:16:44] infirmity and then he walked out because
[1:16:46] that was the will of the father
[1:16:49] you see how it's not cut and dry say
[1:16:51] well God can heal he's going to heal no
[1:16:57] it's it's not it's it's whatever God is
[1:17:01] leading you to
[1:17:03] so God LED Jesus to heal one person he
[1:17:08] was completely subjected completely
[1:17:11] submitted to the headship of the father
[1:17:12] that is the same position men have to
[1:17:15] take
[1:17:18] you can't find your you can't make up a
[1:17:19] decision where you're gonna go what
[1:17:21] you're gonna do
[1:17:24] maybe don't pray for God's will maybe
[1:17:26] just
[1:17:28] serve God
[1:17:30] maybe just learn more about him maybe
[1:17:33] just feed on the word more the best
[1:17:35] thing I can do as a man when I see my
[1:17:38] house in turmoil is start spending more
[1:17:41] time with God not more time telling my
[1:17:43] wife to get under control and get
[1:17:45] spanking getting after my children and
[1:17:47] putting them and you need to listen up
[1:17:49] and do all this stuff no
[1:17:52] there's chaos
[1:17:54] go to the word
[1:17:57] it's a very simple it's a very simple
[1:17:59] equation but we are complicated
[1:18:03] because as soon as you
[1:18:06] you're going to go home I hope
[1:18:08] if this steps on your toes I hope you
[1:18:11] can go home and say we're gonna do this
[1:18:14] we're going to change our home
[1:18:16] we're going to bring this home into
[1:18:17] balance
[1:18:18] all of a sudden you're going to have the
[1:18:20] worst headache you ever had in your life
[1:18:23] if you're gonna wake up in the morning
[1:18:24] you're going to be so tired now what did
[1:18:26] I do yesterday your back's Gonna Hurt
[1:18:31] it's just the devil
[1:18:34] right
[1:18:38] just the devil coming in
[1:18:40] now
[1:18:41] you can be a uh because we have young
[1:18:44] people here you
[1:18:46] can go and you can start help bringing
[1:18:48] balance in your home
[1:18:50] if your home is not the way it should be
[1:18:53] just layer on forgiveness slather the
[1:18:58] love of God
[1:19:00] don't be found
[1:19:02] be found innocent
[1:19:06] if you have a bad attitude I don't care
[1:19:08] I don't care
[1:19:10] what Mom and Dad are doing
[1:19:13] you can still have the right attitude
[1:19:16] because you are responsible for that
[1:19:19] and you can start to learn now what it
[1:19:22] means to have a balanced home because
[1:19:23] one day at the Lord should teres you
[1:19:26] will be in that position and you don't
[1:19:27] want to repeat the cycle because if you
[1:19:29] just carry the bitterness that you have
[1:19:31] in your heart
[1:19:32] in to your future
[1:19:35] you will repeat exactly what you hate
[1:19:38] about your parents
[1:19:41] to the T you will repeat it the only way
[1:19:44] you can break the cycle is with Christ
[1:19:50] and
[1:19:51] Christ has a role in the home
[1:19:55] Christ has a position very top that's
[1:19:57] his position but you know what what's
[1:19:59] the one thing that God does speaking of
[1:20:01] a man being in his position and wanting
[1:20:03] his family to be in position and
[1:20:05] balanced home what is the number one
[1:20:07] thing God doesn't does he's a gentleman
[1:20:10] and he never forces you to do anything
[1:20:14] a man should never Force his wife to do
[1:20:17] anything
[1:20:20] you will lead in love
[1:20:23] he never he never forced it you know you
[1:20:26] lead your children
[1:20:28] because if you just force your children
[1:20:30] into obedience as soon as you're not
[1:20:32] around they'll be the wildest kids in
[1:20:34] church
[1:20:35] when I see families as a whole as a unit
[1:20:38] together and I see Mom and Dad in strict
[1:20:41] control
[1:20:42] I am very wary of their children
[1:20:45] because as soon as mom went down and
[1:20:47] around they're the worst bunch of them
[1:20:50] but I see parents who are like now
[1:20:52] there's a balance I'm not talking about
[1:20:53] the ones who can't control their kids
[1:20:55] but I see I see kids who are who have
[1:20:57] the confidence to speak up and to talk
[1:20:58] and hey you know what's going on and Mom
[1:21:01] and Dad might have to say hey quiet down
[1:21:02] right but
[1:21:05] the kids are confident in their
[1:21:07] atmosphere and they feel that they can
[1:21:09] be themselves so when I see the family
[1:21:11] as you and I say oh that's how those
[1:21:12] kids act and sure enough Mom down around
[1:21:17] you want to know if you want to know
[1:21:19] your if you want to know your kids are
[1:21:21] in too much of a control ask how they
[1:21:23] act when you're not around
[1:21:25] if they're out of control you are too
[1:21:27] controlling
[1:21:30] and there's a balance right okay but if
[1:21:32] you ask say how oh your kids are so well
[1:21:35] behaved they get my kids wow
[1:21:39] wow you're doing the right thing because
[1:21:42] we want we don't want
[1:21:45] Titus I don't want you to serve God
[1:21:47] because I told you to
[1:21:50] because as soon as I'm not around and we
[1:21:52] have many examples of this in the
[1:21:53] message you're going to stop serving God
[1:21:55] I want you to serve God because you love
[1:21:57] God
[1:21:58] I want my daughter I want my kids to be
[1:22:03] obedient respectful
[1:22:05] because they want to
[1:22:09] and control never brings that out in
[1:22:13] them
[1:22:14] it never does
[1:22:16] and
[1:22:18] and so I knew this was going to happen
[1:22:22] I pray Lord help me stay keeping the
[1:22:24] channel
[1:22:26] the next slide here
[1:22:28] so likewise your husbands dwell with
[1:22:30] them according to let me just get a time
[1:22:33] check here dwell with them according to
[1:22:35] knowledge giving honor unto the wife as
[1:22:38] unto the weaker vessel
[1:22:40] okay so that's scripture
[1:22:44] that scripture okay we'll save that for
[1:22:46] the next one and as being heirs together
[1:22:48] of the grace of life that you're wait a
[1:22:52] second
[1:22:54] that your prayers be not hindered
[1:22:58] what happened to the scripture in the
[1:23:00] message that's its culture what happened
[1:23:04] no I know there's some circles where
[1:23:06] this stuff is taught well taught and you
[1:23:08] see the fruits of that
[1:23:09] you see the fruits of that
[1:23:12] but as a broad spectrum
[1:23:15] what happened to the scripture that your
[1:23:17] prayers be not hindered oh I need uh you
[1:23:20] know I just need a closer walk with God
[1:23:21] wife shut up and sit down
[1:23:24] they don't go together
[1:23:27] it's not about how much you know or how
[1:23:30] many tapes you listen to
[1:23:32] it's about is your home in balance
[1:23:36] that your prayers be not hindered
[1:23:41] boy that hits me home it's home for me
[1:23:46] that your prayers be not hindered that's
[1:23:48] I'm I'm my my burden tonight is to get
[1:23:51] you to see just how serious God looks at
[1:23:54] a marriage and a family unit
[1:23:57] it's not just something that we do
[1:23:59] because he's handsome and kids are cute
[1:24:02] guess what that wears out
[1:24:06] and we say they say oh wow we've heard
[1:24:07] that a million times
[1:24:09] but it does
[1:24:11] it's a fact
[1:24:13] love never wears out
[1:24:15] Christ never wears out
[1:24:18] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:24:20] forever
[1:24:23] I was listening to
[1:24:27] or I was
[1:24:28] there's this quote where the brother man
[1:24:30] tells a story about the the girl who
[1:24:32] went out with the guy with cute feet
[1:24:35] right he smelled good
[1:24:38] see the devil give you any excuse
[1:24:40] and we laugh at that and we say
[1:24:44] cute feet but yet he plays the guitar
[1:24:49] so you're attracted to him
[1:24:52] or he's got a nice car
[1:24:55] right
[1:24:58] let's leave the Halos
[1:25:00] to the angels
[1:25:04] next slide here
[1:25:06] if you've wandered a way out in the
[1:25:08] world and you women's got to acting
[1:25:10] worldly and you men's got to letting
[1:25:13] them do it
[1:25:15] shame on you
[1:25:17] you're supposed to be the boss of the
[1:25:19] house you're the ruler the Bible said
[1:25:22] the man shall rule
[1:25:23] Now watch how
[1:25:25] brother immediately brings us back into
[1:25:27] balance not a dictator now a floor mat
[1:25:30] what he's saying is she's not your floor
[1:25:32] mat
[1:25:34] he made him a help meet a sweetheart
[1:25:40] okay so men you want a sweet heart
[1:25:45] lead your home
[1:25:48] you want a wife who's in her per
[1:25:50] position
[1:25:51] get in your position
[1:25:57] next one
[1:25:59] Christ
[1:26:00] is the perfect example
[1:26:04] how should a man be what kind of you
[1:26:06] know young ladies growing up
[1:26:08] I know don't I mean don't think about it
[1:26:11] but five years six years eight years fly
[1:26:14] by
[1:26:17] you want to know what kind of man you
[1:26:19] want to find
[1:26:20] okay
[1:26:22] guess what
[1:26:24] unfortunately if you frequent camps most
[1:26:27] of the time the guys who are the good
[1:26:29] ones aren't popular
[1:26:38] you if you're looking for a boy and you
[1:26:40] look at you're looking at a boy
[1:26:42] and you say you know kind of like him
[1:26:45] watch him after church
[1:26:48] what does he do
[1:26:49] if he splits
[1:26:52] move on
[1:26:54] you can come back later and check up on
[1:26:56] him
[1:26:57] because God could have done changed his
[1:26:59] life right
[1:27:01] you can't excuse them for good
[1:27:04] I know people
[1:27:05] who are married today fine Christian
[1:27:08] couples who he said sorry sister you
[1:27:11] need to get right with God
[1:27:12] and she wouldn't go right with God and
[1:27:15] then they got together
[1:27:16] now she didn't do it because of him but
[1:27:18] he just said hey things are going to
[1:27:19] work out like that right but he he he
[1:27:21] still likes her he watches from afar
[1:27:25] but you watch him
[1:27:27] he didn't stalk her Gabriella
[1:27:33] [Laughter]
[1:27:36] I got the why dear eyes when I said he
[1:27:38] watched her from afar
[1:27:44] so you watch that man what does he do is
[1:27:46] is he is he is he's on the front row or
[1:27:49] is he a couple rolls back is he serving
[1:27:51] God is he is he the nice guy or is he
[1:27:54] the
[1:27:55] now guy can can a guy can be athletic
[1:27:59] and still be on fire for God okay
[1:28:02] but watch where they're emphasis is
[1:28:05] what's their focus okay now husbands
[1:28:08] bring this right back to where we are
[1:28:10] tonight what's your focus
[1:28:13] there's things that I want to do in my
[1:28:15] life
[1:28:16] and I struggle with them
[1:28:19] because I realize
[1:28:22] I can't I can't really do that right now
[1:28:27] so I'm giving that up
[1:28:30] because right now
[1:28:32] my focus is my family
[1:28:35] now as most of you know I travel some to
[1:28:38] minister
[1:28:39] so I have to put make sure they're good
[1:28:42] they're set they're ready they know this
[1:28:44] is a family thing
[1:28:46] I'm not just going off say see no and my
[1:28:49] wife has to be in her position because
[1:28:50] she's got to take care of the kids you
[1:28:52] think you think about sister Branham
[1:28:55] I think it was a sermon I was just
[1:28:58] listening to today which is choosing of
[1:28:59] a bride I think he says
[1:29:00] he hadn't hardly been home for 15 years
[1:29:05] he said she's Snow White hair is gone
[1:29:08] because of the stress
[1:29:10] you think my goodness if you were too
[1:29:12] carnal you look at that say my goodness
[1:29:14] that guy needs to take care of his
[1:29:15] family better but he was in his position
[1:29:17] and she was in hers
[1:29:19] so
[1:29:21] we have a baseline in the scriptures of
[1:29:24] what our positions are
[1:29:26] and then from that each is different for
[1:29:29] each individual
[1:29:36] all right
[1:29:39] next slide
[1:29:42] if all of this comes into place
[1:29:47] the balance of the home the home is
[1:29:49] balanced
[1:29:50] it's
[1:29:51] beautiful Harmony
[1:29:55] next one
[1:29:56] but I would have you know that the head
[1:29:58] of man is Christ now this is the format
[1:30:02] this is the format of a family
[1:30:04] but whatever you know the head of every
[1:30:05] man is Christ the head of the woman is
[1:30:09] the man and the head of Christ is God
[1:30:17] there are certain things now remember
[1:30:18] what I just said I just said that
[1:30:20] there's a baseline in the description
[1:30:21] for our positions
[1:30:23] now God's not going to ever ask you to
[1:30:25] do anything that doesn't line up with
[1:30:26] his word okay you understand that
[1:30:28] but
[1:30:30] brother Isaac here
[1:30:31] I'm called to the ministry the minister
[1:30:34] brother Isaac is not but that doesn't
[1:30:36] mean he has to be ministered to be in
[1:30:37] his position
[1:30:38] he has his position Caleb was called to
[1:30:41] the mountain Manasseh to the plains
[1:30:45] positions
[1:30:47] okay
[1:30:49] so when you're when you have the
[1:30:51] position that you're supposed to hold
[1:30:54] God will call you two certain things
[1:30:58] certain things by your personalities now
[1:31:00] brother Branham talks about he says
[1:31:02] he's talking to or they're talking about
[1:31:04] he's talking about
[1:31:05] a strain in the family
[1:31:08] he's specifically is an example of a
[1:31:10] young man and his family and different
[1:31:12] things and the strain in the family was
[1:31:15] that they just couldn't say they were
[1:31:17] sorry
[1:31:18] and brother makes attempts he says no
[1:31:20] matter how perverted you get that'll
[1:31:23] stay in your flesh
[1:31:25] okay so I'm laying a little Foundation
[1:31:28] here very well something I'm about to
[1:31:29] say
[1:31:31] so there's strains in your flesh there's
[1:31:33] there's gold veins right hidden things
[1:31:36] from your family that are in you you
[1:31:38] know we laugh about Irish German but
[1:31:41] it's true
[1:31:42] its personalities now the holy spirit
[1:31:45] gives you the ability to control those
[1:31:48] personalities but not in the fact that I
[1:31:51] have the Holy Ghost I can now do
[1:31:52] whatever I want
[1:31:54] I can cross those no if you're if you're
[1:31:58] a man who who who is drawn to to to you
[1:32:01] know anger and height don't take up
[1:32:03] boxing
[1:32:06] don't start taking up finding because
[1:32:08] you're gonna you're gonna gravitate to
[1:32:10] that side of you
[1:32:12] so that's not for you some guys can box
[1:32:14] every day of their life and never face
[1:32:16] them I don't okay
[1:32:19] whatever boxing baby was the wrong
[1:32:21] example but guys can do so and never
[1:32:23] phase them
[1:32:25] some guys can can get into hunting and
[1:32:27] fishing no problem
[1:32:29] of the guys there's a there's a there's
[1:32:31] a channel in them where where the men in
[1:32:34] the family all the way back years and
[1:32:35] years and years and years like to just
[1:32:37] neglect their duties and just be out
[1:32:39] fishing and hunting
[1:32:40] you're gonna have to control that okay
[1:32:43] so now
[1:32:45] women can have
[1:32:48] can have the tendency
[1:32:50] to lead
[1:32:51] because you have to lead your children
[1:32:53] children you got to sell that little boy
[1:32:55] you straighten up right you got to be
[1:32:56] you can be a leader of your home
[1:32:59] in your position so if a woman has a
[1:33:02] tendency to be a strong leader she has
[1:33:05] to watch
[1:33:06] where she positions herself in the home
[1:33:10] for example
[1:33:12] this is strict example it says each
[1:33:14] family on their own each unit on their
[1:33:16] own
[1:33:18] you have personality traits you have to
[1:33:20] be cautious of okay
[1:33:24] some families some couples it's okay if
[1:33:27] she does the budget
[1:33:30] but
[1:33:31] men you have to know where the money's
[1:33:34] at and what's going on because that's
[1:33:35] your position
[1:33:38] you're a man that's
[1:33:40] the economics of the home
[1:33:43] we don't want the CEO not knowing what's
[1:33:45] going on right he gets annual or
[1:33:47] quarterly reports where the money's
[1:33:49] being spent he knows where money is
[1:33:50] going he has to because he's in charge
[1:33:52] of the ship
[1:33:54] so maybe she does the books whatever
[1:33:56] I was going to be very transparent and
[1:33:58] bless my wife that can't work in our
[1:34:00] home my wife starts doing the budget
[1:34:03] if you're not careful what happens is
[1:34:05] then you say oh honey how much money can
[1:34:07] I have
[1:34:08] wow
[1:34:10] that is a terrible situation being
[1:34:13] because she is in the leadership
[1:34:15] position now for you
[1:34:20] they say well I you know finances isn't
[1:34:22] my weakness then make it your is it my
[1:34:24] strength then make it your strength
[1:34:25] there's books there's things you can do
[1:34:28] I had to I didn't know a sweet clue
[1:34:30] about money when I got married and I let
[1:34:33] my wife do the budgeting and it caused
[1:34:35] contention and resentment in our
[1:34:37] marriage to where she was more in charge
[1:34:40] in charge I don't know like using that
[1:34:42] word because it's so she was in the
[1:34:44] leadership role
[1:34:47] I am I'm a software developer for Cisco
[1:34:49] I don't have us a clue what they spent I
[1:34:53] don't need to know
[1:34:54] because they are my leadership
[1:34:58] if I knew more about the money than they
[1:35:00] did they would be under my leadership
[1:35:02] you see what I'm getting with this
[1:35:06] so we have to make sure are there things
[1:35:08] in our home that that we need to balance
[1:35:10] out
[1:35:11] you say well maybe maybe she's you know
[1:35:13] she can do the the majority of it but
[1:35:15] she's working the budget under your
[1:35:18] leadership
[1:35:20] no honey I think we ought to put more
[1:35:21] money here this month less money here
[1:35:24] and I'm sorry you wanted to to do this
[1:35:26] over here but we ought to do that here
[1:35:30] because you're the one in charge and you
[1:35:32] need to know what's going on you need to
[1:35:33] have a trajectory for the future
[1:35:36] because finances is one of I'm going to
[1:35:39] steal brother Jack Duff's thing here is
[1:35:41] one of the four tires of marriage
[1:35:44] is finances and if you've got a flat
[1:35:46] tire it's really hard to drive somewhere
[1:35:49] okay
[1:35:51] he puts the four tires as finances
[1:35:53] emotional mental physical
[1:35:57] spiritual
[1:36:00] last quote here
[1:36:02] I think it's the last quote Yeah
[1:36:06] they will love him love his and will
[1:36:08] have his potentials for he is their head
[1:36:10] and they are his subjects subject to his
[1:36:12] head headship of Christ was his notice
[1:36:15] what Harmony now I'm I'm pulling this
[1:36:17] this is the spoken word is the Original
[1:36:19] Seed you think well this is a this is a
[1:36:21] quote for for a sermon on the seals no
[1:36:23] no no no because all the quotes are for
[1:36:26] where we live
[1:36:27] notice what Harmony Jesus never did
[1:36:29] anything until scene of the Father the
[1:36:31] father showed him first
[1:36:33] see leadership
[1:36:35] showed him first
[1:36:37] you and your children to put emphasis on
[1:36:39] devotions in the morning show them first
[1:36:43] Harmony between God and Christ see John
[1:36:45] 5 19 so will the bride and he shows her
[1:36:48] his word of life he shows her and she
[1:36:52] receives it she never doubts it nothing
[1:36:54] can harm her not even death that is the
[1:36:57] same relationship you have with your
[1:36:59] husband you are in safety when you
[1:37:01] follow his leadership men you want your
[1:37:05] wife you say man I want my wife to be
[1:37:06] and secure and safe get in your position
[1:37:10] and lead your family
[1:37:14] the shepherd carries the Sheep over his
[1:37:16] shoulders
[1:37:18] carry your family on your shoulders
[1:37:22] she never doubts that nothing can harm
[1:37:23] or not even death for if the seed be
[1:37:25] planted the water will raise it up again
[1:37:27] here is the secret ready here's the
[1:37:29] secret you want to know what's the
[1:37:31] secret to a good marriage what's the
[1:37:33] secret to a balanced home here it is the
[1:37:35] word is in the bride and the mind of
[1:37:36] Christ to know what he wants done with
[1:37:38] the word
[1:37:39] and she does it in his name she has thus
[1:37:41] said the Lord then it is germanized so
[1:37:43] the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is
[1:37:45] grown and serves a purpose that is home
[1:37:48] life
[1:37:49] that's not just because revelation of
[1:37:51] the word of God will bring a balance in
[1:37:53] your home
[1:37:55] Revelation and intellectual knowledge of
[1:37:59] the message are very very close
[1:38:05] and if you're not careful as a man
[1:38:06] because we want to you know we're
[1:38:08] excited about the word and this I hope
[1:38:09] we should be we want to know more about
[1:38:11] the word if we're not careful we cross
[1:38:13] that and it becomes an intellectual
[1:38:15] knowledge of the message
[1:38:18] and then our family begins to get
[1:38:20] neglected now I I say that I need to be
[1:38:22] careful because maybe that's not a
[1:38:24] situation here in the church
[1:38:26] because I've noticed that sometimes we
[1:38:28] as individuals we can get stuck in the
[1:38:30] past
[1:38:33] so I say that because there's a
[1:38:34] situation growing up where a man in the
[1:38:36] church put all his emphasis on listening
[1:38:38] to tapes and he didn't work
[1:38:40] he didn't show up to church on time and
[1:38:42] his family was neglected so
[1:38:45] I had to be careful to not speak to you
[1:38:47] past
[1:38:49] the day I was pondering is especially as
[1:38:52] as a minister
[1:38:53] you know there's situations especially
[1:38:55] in your family right situations your
[1:38:57] children
[1:38:58] are not your wife is not your mother
[1:39:02] if your mother did hurts past hurts to
[1:39:06] you don't get stuck in the past
[1:39:08] when we when we got converted
[1:39:11] we got to live it of our past
[1:39:14] so don't look at your wife
[1:39:18] and accuse her
[1:39:20] because you never forgave your mother
[1:39:24] don't look at your children and accuse
[1:39:26] them because you never forgave your
[1:39:28] sister
[1:39:30] okay you see behaviors say wow they're
[1:39:32] locked in just like my sister and then
[1:39:34] you just rail on them because you're
[1:39:36] still mad at your sister
[1:39:38] or you rail on your wife because you're
[1:39:40] still mad at your mom
[1:39:43] we have to let the past go
[1:39:45] because we want Harmony in our home we
[1:39:48] want the balanced home
[1:39:51] and if we have the balanced home
[1:39:54] my we'll have some church
[1:39:58] the home is where you spend
[1:40:01] every day of your life
[1:40:05] so let's make that the best it can be
[1:40:08] right
[1:40:10] but
[1:40:13] this gospel this sermon
[1:40:15] is not the sermon of ease
[1:40:19] like Theodore said it's the string it's
[1:40:22] strenuiosity it takes hard work it takes
[1:40:26] Blood Sweat and Tears
[1:40:29] but
[1:40:30] it's worth it
[1:40:32] we'll use that saying around our house
[1:40:34] say well for something that's hard to do
[1:40:36] if we don't want to do it we say well
[1:40:38] you won't regret it
[1:40:40] and it's true
[1:40:42] if you begin to apply what's the
[1:40:44] scripture says about a home whether
[1:40:46] you're you know tonight was the focus
[1:40:47] was on men but it doesn't matter
[1:40:50] you begin to apply this whatever
[1:40:52] position you hold
[1:40:53] husband wife daughter son
[1:40:58] you can begin to apply the balance
[1:41:02] and you must realize that all the
[1:41:05] weights of the bag are the Lords
[1:41:09] see God doesn't care about our God does
[1:41:12] he does care but he's not focused on the
[1:41:15] current perspective
[1:41:17] he's focused on the goal think about you
[1:41:20] when you were your worst
[1:41:21] but God just said hey it's okay
[1:41:24] because she's lining up more he's lining
[1:41:27] it with my plan
[1:41:29] so out here on the other side this is
[1:41:31] where I'm worried about
[1:41:32] and this is just going to lead you there
[1:41:36] so maybe your home's not what it needs
[1:41:37] to be
[1:41:39] maybe you don't have the control
[1:41:41] to be in a position of a man to begin to
[1:41:43] bring your home into position
[1:41:46] do you have to remember that all the
[1:41:48] weights of the bag are the Lord's even
[1:41:51] when they're being improperly used
[1:41:54] because everything perverted
[1:41:57] perversion unrighteousness is
[1:41:59] righteousness perverted
[1:42:01] but God uses those things
[1:42:04] uses those things to put us into
[1:42:07] position
[1:42:08] let's bow our heads
[1:42:11] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:42:13] we thank you Father
[1:42:16] tonight Lauren
[1:42:18] tough words
[1:42:19] tough things to to take and
[1:42:22] take home and live
[1:42:24] but Lord
[1:42:26] they're so so important
[1:42:31] because that's home is where everything
[1:42:33] starts that all starts there Our Lives
[1:42:37] where we'll grow up and
[1:42:39] they'll grow up and get married or I
[1:42:41] grew up I then I got married my life
[1:42:43] started there am I at home I once was a
[1:42:46] kid I once was a six-year-old running
[1:42:47] around once was a teenager
[1:42:52] home is where it all starts
[1:42:55] and Lord we want to we want to we want
[1:42:58] to balance that out
[1:43:00] because we want to get out of here we
[1:43:02] want a rapture
[1:43:04] we can't bring our home into balance
[1:43:06] we'll never be in our position help us
[1:43:08] Lord may you just drive that home in our
[1:43:10] hearts Lord
[1:43:12] tomorrow we wake up and we're tired
[1:43:15] help us to to just
[1:43:18] remember
