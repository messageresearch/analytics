[39:06] you know we're gonna we're gonna uh talk
[39:09] about a mother today
[39:11] where we're picking her right out of
[39:13] this scripture
[39:14] we're going to talk about her and we're
[39:17] going to see what a
[39:18] mother's love what it would bring about
[39:22] and what the presence of god can do
[39:26] when when god is in the house
[39:29] amen so let's just stand as we would go
[39:31] into second kings we just want to
[39:34] uh just uh speak to you today the oil
[39:38] is sufficient amen so we just
[39:41] take this right out of the scripture
[39:43] today out of second kings the fourth
[39:45] chapter
[39:46] verses one through seven amen i think
[39:49] it's a very familiar
[39:51] uh story to each and every one of us
[39:54] uh but today we're just going to uh
[39:57] pull something right out of this just a
[40:00] little portion
[40:01] uh to to grab a hols of and uh
[40:04] make a point about it my brother and
[40:06] sister uh
[40:07] and uh you know we we just i had another
[40:11] title which i
[40:12] will just use as a subtitle you might
[40:14] say uh as we go along
[40:16] uh to bring about a point second kings
[40:19] the fourth chapter
[40:21] verses one through seven now there cried
[40:24] a certain woman of the wives of the sons
[40:27] of the prophets
[40:28] unto elisha saying thy servant
[40:32] my husband is dead she is now a widow
[40:35] thou knowest the servant did fear the
[40:38] lord
[40:39] and the creditor has come to take unto
[40:41] him my two sons
[40:43] to be bond men and elisha said unto her
[40:46] what shall i do for thee
[40:48] tell me what hast thou in the house and
[40:51] she
[40:52] said then handmaid hath not anything in
[40:54] the house
[40:56] save a pot of oil
[40:59] then he said go
[41:02] and borrow the vessels abroad
[41:06] of all thy neighbors even empty vessels
[41:09] borrow not a few now you imagine the
[41:13] stir that went through the neighborhood
[41:15] that morning
[41:16] when she and her children are knocking
[41:18] on every single house saying i need
[41:21] every empty vessel you've got i will
[41:25] return them
[41:26] but for now i need them and i need them
[41:29] speedily
[41:30] amen everybody thought what is going on
[41:33] at their house
[41:35] hallelujah well i'll save that for just
[41:38] a minute here
[41:40] amen and when thou art come in
[41:43] thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
[41:45] upon thy sons and shalt pour out unto
[41:48] all those vessels
[41:50] and thou shall set aside that which is
[41:52] full
[41:54] so she went from him and shut the door
[41:56] upon her and upon her sons who brought
[41:58] the vessels to her
[42:00] and she poured out and it came to pass
[42:03] when the vessels were full
[42:04] that she said unto her son bring me yet
[42:06] a vessel
[42:08] and he said unto her there is not a
[42:10] vessel more
[42:12] and the oil stayed then she came
[42:17] and told the man of god and he said go
[42:20] sell the oil pay thy debt and live thou
[42:24] and thy children of the rest
[42:27] heavenly father we ask for your guiding
[42:29] hand today

[43:05] morning lord may we respond
[43:07] father we're not here to race one
[43:09] another father to get into your presence
[43:12] but father you are more than sufficient
[43:14] for each and every one of us
[43:16] and lord we just ask you now come and
[43:19] lord as it was on the day of pentecost
[43:22] when
[43:22] you broke yourself into licks of fire
[43:25] and come upon the people
[43:27] we would ask you this morning lord may
[43:29] your holy spirit come down in our midst
[43:31] this morning
[43:33] father move lord lord in each one
[43:37] in each circumstance each state of life
[43:41] and state of mind
[43:43] lord we need you and we thank you father
[43:46] because you said if we would welcome you
[43:48] invite you that you would come in our
[43:51] midst and i believe that this morning
[43:53] and ask for your hand of mercy may we
[43:55] express this
[43:57] correctly in a fashion that is pleasing
[43:59] to you lord
[44:00] in the name of jesus christ amen you may
[44:02] be seated
[44:04] hallelujah now as we look at this today
[44:08] i just want to kind of come along i
[44:10] wouldn't call it a bible study
[44:11] i'm not a very good teacher as it is to
[44:14] just break things down line by line
[44:16] but as we would look today my brother
[44:18] and sister just want to
[44:19] come and and the lord be gracious that
[44:22] we could uh
[44:23] just catch uh the types and shadows now
[44:26] just
[44:27] doing some reading and brother branham
[44:28] talks about being a typologist
[44:31] uh talks about how he can draw these
[44:33] things out of the
[44:34] out of this scripture and how you can
[44:36] make those comparisons
[44:38] and see what is what by these types and
[44:41] today we want to just use this as it
[44:43] were as a type
[44:44] because my brother and sister i don't
[44:46] believe old or new testament
[44:48] that this is just something that is
[44:51] history but this bible my brother and
[44:53] sister
[44:54] is a living bible amen this word of god
[44:57] is
[44:57] living and it will live just as big in
[45:00] our life
[45:00] as we will give it room to grow amen you
[45:03] know isn't it interesting
[45:05] uh that you can take and the environment
[45:09] will control the growth and it doesn't
[45:11] matter whether you're talking about
[45:12] livestock
[45:13] or or you know plants or whatever it
[45:16] might be or the human
[45:18] relationship and that's why when you
[45:20] come into a world my brother and sister
[45:22] that is a very tightly controlled world
[45:25] a world where
[45:26] everything uh must conform uh and i'm
[45:29] talking more in a natural
[45:31] sense you will find that people while
[45:33] they would uh
[45:34] grow but they don't grow to their full
[45:36] potential
[45:38] and what we want to do today is grow in
[45:41] our lord jesus christ to our full
[45:43] potential
[45:44] uh to raise up into a position where god
[45:47] is pleased not only with us but
[45:49] our life is then such a perfect
[45:52] reflection of our lord jesus christ
[45:54] that uh people as we would look down
[45:56] through the time
[45:57] my brother and sister i used to have
[45:59] kind of a a different outlook on those
[46:02] people that almost thought brother
[46:03] branham was god
[46:04] i used to think what was wrong with
[46:06] those people but lord help
[46:08] us live a life that would be so
[46:11] reflective of jesus christ
[46:13] that people would say this is not a
[46:16] normal person
[46:17] amen otherwise we can take on the cloak
[46:20] of religion or the cloak of christianity
[46:23] and we can say i am a message believer
[46:25] but as i shared the quote with you i
[46:27] believe it was on
[46:28] wednesday night brother branham says so
[46:30] you say you're a believer you believe
[46:32] these things
[46:33] that just shows you can read amen so we
[46:35] want more than just
[46:36] reading we want the life that is in the
[46:39] gospel right
[46:40] now my brother and sister that's what
[46:42] the gospel is is the life
[46:44] behind amen so we can say well i read my
[46:48] bible i listen i do all of these things
[46:50] but if we don't pursue the life now when
[46:53] i use that word pursue for those who are
[46:55] very
[46:56] technical people i'm not talking about
[46:58] us doing it
[46:59] it's god doing it us right because see
[47:01] we've never
[47:02] uh went after god we never pursued god
[47:05] god's
[47:06] always pursued us but we can stand here
[47:09] today
[47:10] and say thank you lord that that little
[47:12] spark of life that was inside of
[47:14] us has now caused us as it were to
[47:18] pursue the word
[47:19] amen for wherever the carcass is the
[47:22] eagles will be gathered
[47:24] so there had to be something that drew
[47:25] the eagle to that carcass
[47:27] amen and so we just look today for these
[47:30] things of god and i hope this will be a
[47:32] blessing
[47:33] when we're finished today so where we
[47:35] have
[47:36] this as the scripture uses the word and
[47:38] i will use those words
[47:40] a certain woman amen not named by name
[47:43] but
[47:43] uh identified and here she is uh
[47:47] speaking uh to the prophet sharing with
[47:49] the prophet
[47:50] giving a reminder she says you know my
[47:53] husband was a god-fearing man
[47:55] he was a faithful man and and we've come
[47:58] into this circumstance and
[48:00] no doubt my brother and sister i i would
[48:02] think that elisha would have known
[48:05] her husband but there might have been
[48:07] enough sons of the prophets that
[48:09] it might not have been a close
[48:10] relationship but she's there now before
[48:13] elisha
[48:14] saying you know what i i want to remind
[48:16] you i want to
[48:17] bring this up before you that my husband
[48:20] is dead
[48:21] and he was a god-fearing man he feared
[48:24] the lord
[48:25] and now we have a creditor and this
[48:28] creditor has
[48:29] come and maybe served warning left a
[48:31] notice upon the door
[48:33] that this debt will be collected and uh
[48:36] we
[48:36] intend to take your sons as a
[48:39] bond men and they are going to labor now
[48:42] my brother and sister you know in the
[48:44] world of the bond men
[48:45] they never worked for the same wage as
[48:48] the free man did
[48:49] so as a bond man was there working he
[48:52] might be getting a
[48:53] pittance towards the debt because they
[48:55] would say well
[48:56] we've clothed you we fed you we did all
[49:00] of this for you
[49:01] so you know instead of earning just for
[49:03] an example instead of earning the
[49:04] hundred dollars a day
[49:06] maybe the bond man might earn ten and so
[49:09] it was there it would take a long time
[49:11] to pay off a debt and so these young men
[49:14] did not have a very bright future in
[49:17] front of them
[49:18] they were they were looking and no doubt
[49:21] you know in their self they were
[49:22] thinking oh my how did we
[49:24] end up my dad served the people was in
[49:27] the ministry
[49:28] was faithful to god how can we end up
[49:32] here many a preacher's kid has fought
[49:36] that
[49:38] yeah amen now you see with the creditor
[49:42] at the door
[49:44] this mother has come to a place that she
[49:47] says you know what
[49:48] i'm not going to take this situation
[49:50] laying down
[49:51] these are my children oh
[49:54] saints i want you to think about it
[49:56] these are my children
[49:59] amen i'm not going to take this laying
[50:01] down because these are
[50:02] my children and oh yeah they'll be free
[50:06] in a few years and that they'll be
[50:08] delivered you know sometimes we get that
[50:10] way as parents you know
[50:11] our children are headed towards the
[50:13] world and we like well we gave them to
[50:15] the lord
[50:15] and you know we know they'll be back why
[50:18] don't you fight for them now
[50:20] amen why don't we stand up and say
[50:22] badmin you know creditor
[50:24] you can't have them in the first place
[50:28] there are children
[50:36] yep wants to take my sons
[50:40] to labor to pay a debt do you know
[50:43] that's exactly how satan works
[50:46] reminds me of that see he's trying to
[50:48] convince us saints that our children
[50:52] must end up in the world because
[50:55] we sinned they must end up there if
[50:59] they're ever going to have a real
[51:01] experience with god they'll have to have
[51:03] something to be forgiven for
[51:05] well my brother and sister we were born
[51:07] in sin shaped in iniquity we don't have
[51:09] to go pile anything else on the load to
[51:11] add to it
[51:12] to make it worthwhile hallelujah i tell
[51:15] you there's nothing better than to see
[51:17] our children
[51:18] and i pray god that will give us the
[51:20] kind of testimony here in the church
[51:22] in our families to see our children
[51:24] rising up
[51:25] and have an experience with the lord
[51:27] amen to realize i don't have to go out
[51:30] there
[51:30] and taste of all of that i don't have to
[51:33] eat the filth to know what the good
[51:35] is and i tell you my brother and sister
[51:38] we'll come and we'll stand someday
[51:40] and we'll look at ourselves and say did
[51:42] i do all that i could do
[51:44] i look at my own life i look at my
[51:46] children and god's blessed me with good
[51:48] children
[51:48] i got a son i'm unashamed to say that he
[51:52] isn't doing all that he knows to do and
[51:55] he knows all to do
[51:56] but he's got to make a decision is it
[51:58] worth the effort
[52:00] my brother and sister will look back in
[52:02] life i can assure you
[52:03] and everything that was good we will
[52:05] determine it was worth
[52:07] the effort amen you know it's there we
[52:11] spend i read a deal it was kind of a
[52:14] you know thing about the golden years we
[52:16] spend all our lives
[52:17] saving our money and we come to the
[52:19] golden years and we spend our gold
[52:22] trying to live a few more years
[52:25] and so it's there that we come my
[52:27] brother and sister to realize whatever
[52:29] we pay right now
[52:31] on the behalf of our children is worth
[52:34] the investment amen because we
[52:38] send the pattern must repeat no my
[52:41] brother and sister my brother gideon
[52:42] retrieved
[52:43] many years ago preached a sermon i don't
[52:46] remember the exact title
[52:47] but i just always in my mind titled it
[52:50] the cycle breaker
[52:51] amen we've got a god that is here to
[52:54] take care of the debt
[52:55] he's here to take care of the
[52:57] circumstance he's here to break the
[53:00] cycle my brother and sister we look at
[53:02] life now i'm talking spiritually
[53:04] we look at life in the cycles of life
[53:06] and death but how about as sons and
[53:08] daughters of god
[53:10] we look at the cycle as in just simply
[53:12] life amen
[53:13] because you see if we ever had eternal
[53:16] life
[53:16] the prophet of god says we always had
[53:19] eternal life
[53:20] if we ever work his we were always his
[53:24] amen it's not something that comes and
[53:27] goes amen just as i was sharing the
[53:29] other day
[53:30] in question and answers you know my
[53:32] brother branham you know answers a
[53:33] question there
[53:34] about someone wanting to know if someone
[53:36] could drift away
[53:38] would god bring them back and the
[53:39] prophet of god says that if they were a
[53:41] real
[53:42] true believer the real true seed of god
[53:45] god would bring them back amen now this
[53:48] is not my brother and sister obligation
[53:51] in the sense that we as humans look at
[53:53] obligation
[53:54] we say well i promise that i would do
[53:57] this
[53:57] so no matter whether i feel like this or
[54:01] not
[54:01] i need to go do this my brother and
[54:03] sister god has no such feeling
[54:05] god is there says i by my word i had
[54:08] none greater to swear by
[54:10] so i swear by myself and so i
[54:13] am here more than happy in fact if i
[54:16] could put these words in there
[54:18] god is thrilled to fulfill his promise
[54:21] to you and i
[54:22] it is not i have an obligation
[54:25] it is i said it i said it because i
[54:28] meant it
[54:29] and i meant it because it's mine and i'm
[54:31] claiming what is
[54:32] mine hallelujah you see what god is
[54:36] doing
[54:37] amen now you know look my brother and
[54:40] sister
[54:40] life is full of patterns and they say
[54:43] that you know
[54:44] different times of life different years
[54:46] different things you know
[54:48] and uh you know it's interesting i i'm
[54:51] not throwing
[54:52] jerry under the bus but some time back
[54:54] she said you know
[54:55] i'm surprised paul that you're still
[54:56] farming because uh it used to be that
[54:59] every seven years you changed
[55:01] jobs and you know my brother and sister
[55:03] i've stuck with this one because i'm
[55:05] just dumb as dirt
[55:06] and dirt grows things and so i'll just
[55:07] grow things amen
[55:09] but look at this my brother and sister
[55:11] how god comes
[55:12] and he comes in a pattern as we were
[55:14] talking about there at beth
[55:18] hmm bethesda
[55:21] boy i don't know why that's such a
[55:22] tongue twister to me
[55:24] amen bethesda my brother and sister the
[55:26] scripture
[55:27] says that that the angel of the lord
[55:29] come down
[55:30] in a season in a certain time that was
[55:33] according to god's calendar that was
[55:34] according to god's timing
[55:36] there was no man could set there even if
[55:38] he had the world's biggest abacus at
[55:40] that time
[55:41] and run all the numbers he would ever
[55:43] figure out when the angel was coming
[55:44] back
[55:45] but my brother and sister we have a
[55:47] greater promise is that not what the
[55:49] word for our
[55:50] hour declared we have a greater promise
[55:53] and we
[55:53] know when the coming of the lord is amen
[55:56] oh people
[55:56] say no you don't no you don't oh but we
[55:59] do my brother and sister
[56:01] we know when the coming of the lord is
[56:03] well you say oh the rapture i wasn't
[56:05] talking about the
[56:06] rapture i was talking about the coming
[56:08] of the lord amen and the coming of the
[56:11] lord he comes where he's invited
[56:13] he comes where he is welcome he has come
[56:16] where the prophet of god said
[56:17] he is entertained amen so we can bring
[56:21] the lord into our presence amen
[56:23] and base in that presence any time my
[56:26] brother and sister
[56:27] you will never cry out to god you will
[56:29] never yield yourself to him
[56:31] and speak out from the heart and him
[56:34] ignore you
[56:34] you say but he sometimes doesn't answer
[56:36] our prayers my brother and sister
[56:38] no god always answers prayer he doesn't
[56:41] work on
[56:41] our calendar amen he works on his own
[56:44] timepiece
[56:45] amen but god has always come he said
[56:48] i'll be with you
[56:49] even in you so if he's in you does that
[56:51] mean oh that the door is slamming as he
[56:53] leaves right now
[56:55] or the door is so to speak slamming as
[56:57] he just came right now
[56:58] know my brother and sister he's here
[57:01] he's here
[57:02] thank you lord he's here hallelujah
[57:05] and so we have this friend i mean
[57:08] there's no greater friend than jesus
[57:11] even so that sometimes in the human
[57:13] element we we definitely like to have
[57:14] friends but there's no greater friend
[57:16] than our lord jesus
[57:18] now elisha says unto her you know what
[57:21] shall i do for thee
[57:22] now my brother and sister she didn't
[57:24] come to find a few kind
[57:26] words you know maybe you can have a
[57:29] fundraiser
[57:30] a raffle maybe you can have a bake sale
[57:33] gather up a little money maybe you can
[57:35] make a deal with the creditor
[57:37] that he would let you make payments and
[57:39] let your son say free
[57:40] no she wasn't looking for those kind of
[57:42] things she wasn't looking my brother and
[57:44] sister
[57:45] for just a few kind words she came
[57:48] for a solution and we sometimes i
[57:51] believe now this might seem a little
[57:53] strong
[57:53] but we come to church sometimes for the
[57:56] kind words we come
[57:57] to church sometimes my brother and
[57:59] sister just to hear something that might
[58:01] lift our spirit
[58:03] but i want you to come to church for the
[58:05] solution
[58:06] amen not just the band-aid not just
[58:09] enough ointment to cover the wound
[58:11] amen but to come for the solution to
[58:14] your problem
[58:15] you need healing then come with your
[58:17] heart made up
[58:19] i'm healed you need a deliverance come
[58:21] with your heart made up
[58:23] i am delivered amen you need something
[58:26] out of the word of god
[58:27] then come and say lord the prophet of
[58:30] god told me
[58:31] to pray for revelation above all
[58:34] else so lord i'm going to pray for
[58:36] revelation
[58:37] i want to see more of you lord
[58:39] hallelujah
[58:41] oh my brother and sister you see what we
[58:43] got to do
[58:44] is forget about just receiving a few
[58:46] kind words from the priest and a pack on
[58:48] pat on the back you know and just come
[58:50] to the place that we
[58:52] actually reach out and get a horse of
[58:54] god
[58:55] amen because when you get a hold of god
[58:57] god will send the right person
[58:59] or send the right to come around and
[59:01] bring a solution to your problem but you
[59:04] can touch the kind old priest
[59:06] you can come and have the preacher
[59:07] anoint you with oil and lay hands on it
[59:10] but my brother and sister if you don't
[59:11] ever get in the spirit
[59:13] you don't ever get connected to god then
[59:16] all you're doing is coming into a
[59:18] tradition well when i don't feel good i
[59:20] come to church now don't get me wrong
[59:22] i'm not speaking against this
[59:23] it's scriptural but you know i went to
[59:25] church they prayed for me
[59:27] nothing changed well probably you got
[59:29] what you were expecting deep down in
[59:31] your heart
[59:32] oh god help us not to be a hindered or
[59:35] turn to the side
[59:37] now i oh i'm going to get my foot in my
[59:39] mouth this morning amen
[59:40] well praise the lord jerry didn't polish
[59:43] my shoes and
[59:44] so i won't have to taste the shoe polish
[59:46] anyway but look my brother and sister
[59:48] just because your healing didn't come
[59:51] there's no reason for you to deny that
[59:54] it's already took place
[1:00:00] well hallelujah brother paul i'd sure
[1:00:02] like to see the manifestation of it
[1:00:05] get behind the veil where the shekinah
[1:00:08] glory dwells
[1:00:10] get in there and get so immersed in god
[1:00:12] but then i might start acting real
[1:00:14] religious or funny or something brother
[1:00:15] paul
[1:00:16] well i'll tell you what i'd rather act
[1:00:18] real something funny to the world my
[1:00:19] brother and sister
[1:00:20] and receive a promise from god than i
[1:00:23] would to be all prim proper my ties just
[1:00:26] right
[1:00:26] my shoes are just right this is just
[1:00:28] right that is just right and i'm as dry
[1:00:30] as an old stick in the barnyard
[1:00:33] oh hallelujah
[1:00:39] you see elisha said unto her
[1:00:42] what shall i do for thee now my brother
[1:00:44] and sister i'm going to step out a long
[1:00:45] ways i didn't provide all the quotes and
[1:00:47] the foundation for this so
[1:00:49] it might be a good time just either
[1:00:50] trust me or not but please trust me
[1:00:52] my brother and sister you see as the
[1:00:54] prophet of god was dealing
[1:00:56] in our generation in our time and people
[1:00:58] would come in the line
[1:01:00] you know he didn't have an instantaneous
[1:01:02] insight
[1:01:03] to their life many times they stood
[1:01:06] there
[1:01:07] for just a moment of people were hushed
[1:01:09] and reverent
[1:01:10] and he stood there for a moment and he
[1:01:12] even declares this in words when he says
[1:01:14] now
[1:01:15] as it were now pardon these are just my
[1:01:17] words my spirit amen the holy ghost in
[1:01:19] me is connecting with you
[1:01:21] so we've got a data port we've got a a
[1:01:24] thumb drive whatever you want to call it
[1:01:26] the little usb
[1:01:27] stick and he's putting it in there and
[1:01:29] he's making a connection
[1:01:30] and when he makes that connection then
[1:01:33] he starts to name
[1:01:34] names dates places circumstances my
[1:01:36] brother and sister or many times he just
[1:01:38] says
[1:01:39] you know sir you have heart trouble go
[1:01:41] away god has healed you
[1:01:43] amen so it didn't always have to be a
[1:01:45] great big story but sometimes brother
[1:01:47] branham felt led to add the words amen
[1:01:49] to give you might say the dialogue to
[1:01:52] give this a breakdown of what is going
[1:01:54] on
[1:01:54] now imagine how that family felt or
[1:01:57] those people felt
[1:01:58] you know when the prophet of god shares
[1:02:00] to the whole wide world
[1:02:01] that uh you know this this woman she was
[1:02:03] over here at this
[1:02:04] church in this hospital this church this
[1:02:06] church this church
[1:02:08] and she come and she had a demon she's
[1:02:09] getting worse and she comes in there
[1:02:11] and brother branham is dealing with her
[1:02:14] and you know when brother branham starts
[1:02:15] to talk about her life
[1:02:17] she starts screaming don't say it don't
[1:02:19] say it but brother branham says oh no
[1:02:21] problem see your husband has the same
[1:02:23] issue
[1:02:23] my brother and sister uh you know it
[1:02:25] didn't take rocket scientists to figure
[1:02:27] out who the prophet of god was talking
[1:02:29] about
[1:02:30] people get all nervous while they're
[1:02:31] talking about us well sometimes we us
[1:02:34] need talked about amen sometimes we
[1:02:36] ought to have enough courage to say lord
[1:02:38] i'm the one lord i'm the one that the
[1:02:41] holy spirit's doing this
[1:02:43] or coming or moving for a certain reason
[1:02:45] i am the one
[1:02:47] amen my brother and sister brother
[1:02:48] branham calls people out
[1:02:50] you know the reason this is happening
[1:02:51] you're doing this in your life
[1:02:53] you think that man in the flesh
[1:02:55] appreciated
[1:02:56] it being put out to the world but when
[1:02:59] that man
[1:03:00] delivered of that spirit and got out of
[1:03:03] his flesh and got into the spirit
[1:03:05] he was thanking god he wasn't
[1:03:08] embarrassed he wasn't whatever he said
[1:03:10] lord
[1:03:10] thank you thank you i've been delivered
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:14] hallelujah and i say lord whatever it
[1:03:17] takes reveal to us our shortcomings
[1:03:19] our failures whatever it might be lord
[1:03:21] that we could come into this place
[1:03:23] so here elisha says unto her what shall
[1:03:26] i do for thee and
[1:03:27] i can imagine there's a pause my brother
[1:03:29] and sister
[1:03:30] that is taking place what is he doing
[1:03:32] elisha is getting into the mind of god
[1:03:35] he's connecting with her spirit and god
[1:03:38] is dealing with him
[1:03:39] and now my brother and sister if you
[1:03:41] just let me be presumptuous for a minute
[1:03:43] this morning
[1:03:44] i believe elisha knew that there was a
[1:03:46] miracle on the way
[1:03:48] i believe elisha knew that something was
[1:03:51] fixing to happen
[1:03:52] he wasn't just giving her an exercise
[1:03:56] he wasn't just giving her something to
[1:03:58] occupy her time
[1:04:00] but he was then connected to her and i
[1:04:03] tell you my brother and sister
[1:04:04] i think that we should come to the place
[1:04:07] when we
[1:04:07] not just the house of god but just
[1:04:10] coming one another
[1:04:11] in our daily lives we ought to get to
[1:04:14] the place that we
[1:04:15] know there's a miracle on the way we
[1:04:17] know that god is present and that he is
[1:04:19] working
[1:04:20] and he is working for our good amen
[1:04:24] so you know he then says
[1:04:27] i believe this is the connection now now
[1:04:30] pardon me for putting it this way but we
[1:04:31] live in the 21st century
[1:04:33] after the little circle that no one
[1:04:36] could see
[1:04:37] quit going around elisha says
[1:04:40] tell me what's in your house
[1:04:47] oh i want you to understand saints how
[1:04:49] god works
[1:04:52] i don't think they were probably
[1:04:53] sleeping on the floor but it's possible
[1:04:56] maybe the only thing in their house was
[1:04:59] a cruise of oil
[1:05:01] but you see god oh hallelujah
[1:05:04] god will take what is in your life
[1:05:07] already
[1:05:08] and god will use that for your
[1:05:11] deliverance
[1:05:12] god will use what's in your life right
[1:05:14] now
[1:05:15] and he will use that to deepen our
[1:05:18] experience you know say lord sweep my
[1:05:21] life perfectly clean
[1:05:22] no god will use my brother and sister
[1:05:25] the clutter as it were
[1:05:27] of our life now i just want you to grasp
[1:05:30] this what a question
[1:05:31] that he says what hath thou in the house
[1:05:35] think about it what do we have in the
[1:05:38] house
[1:05:40] come on saints what do we have in the
[1:05:42] house if elisha was talking to you and i
[1:05:46] what could we offer to elisha as in
[1:05:50] our house amen would it bring
[1:05:53] a miracle or would it hinder
[1:05:57] a miracle oh my brother and sister we're
[1:06:01] not just living
[1:06:02] in just some realm where hey i'm a
[1:06:04] spiritual person
[1:06:05] you know that was the whole fundamentals
[1:06:06] of the two soul doctrine i can behave
[1:06:08] this way here
[1:06:10] and go to church and be this person here
[1:06:12] my brother and sister that's not what
[1:06:14] it's about
[1:06:15] it's important what is in our house
[1:06:18] amen talking about the natural house and
[1:06:21] the spiritual house
[1:06:23] what is in the house lord
[1:06:26] help us come to a place that what's in
[1:06:29] our house
[1:06:30] will bring about or facilitate a miracle
[1:06:33] or a move of
[1:06:34] god not something that would be
[1:06:38] well you know uh look the prophet's
[1:06:40] asking
[1:06:41] about what's in my house so i'll just go
[1:06:43] ahead
[1:06:44] and um it'll be all right he won't
[1:06:47] notice
[1:06:50] come on saints it's house cleaning time
[1:06:54] it's time for us to get the house
[1:06:56] cleaned up it's time for us to get ready
[1:06:59] for a miracle to happen
[1:07:01] you say well brother paul what kind of
[1:07:02] miracles are you expecting well i'll
[1:07:04] just let your imagination answer your
[1:07:06] question
[1:07:07] but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:07:08] sister us having rapturing faith
[1:07:11] in a world full of doubt and fear look
[1:07:13] at the last few months that we've had
[1:07:15] everything they peddled if you've looked
[1:07:17] at the news whether it be a television
[1:07:19] or online you know the cable stuff
[1:07:21] or wherever it might be fear fear
[1:07:24] fear fear fear you're going to die

[1:07:29] happen we're all going to be living on
[1:07:31] the streets
[1:07:32] this is the end of america this is the
[1:07:34] chaos
[1:07:35] my brother and sister i didn't include
[1:07:37] it i don't believe this morning
[1:07:38] but the prophet of god someone asked him
[1:07:40] hey minister
[1:07:42] what are we going to do about all these
[1:07:45] children
[1:07:46] and the prophet of god is talking there
[1:07:48] and he says you know what
[1:07:50] what we got to do is we got to get it to
[1:07:52] the state that we get this communist
[1:07:54] spirit
[1:07:55] you know because that's what the prophet
[1:07:56] of god said about russia right
[1:07:58] the catholicism opened the door amen the
[1:08:02] people got to the place that if this is
[1:08:04] god
[1:08:04] we don't want it and they went on i oh
[1:08:07] my brother and sister i'm just getting
[1:08:08] sidetracked
[1:08:09] but i tell you what happens is if we're
[1:08:12] not living
[1:08:12] christ in front of our house oh help us
[1:08:17] if we're not living christ in front of
[1:08:19] our house we'll wonder why our children
[1:08:21] become
[1:08:21] atheists and communists and whatever
[1:08:24] else's
[1:08:26] yeah see there's got to be something in
[1:08:28] the house that shows these
[1:08:30] children god is real nothing better than
[1:08:33] good parents amen nothing better
[1:08:35] than a church that god's alive and
[1:08:38] moving and
[1:08:38] the word of god is being brought forth
[1:08:41] in liberty
[1:08:42] hallelujah now look my brother and
[1:08:44] sister what's in the house
[1:08:47] well
[1:08:51] not handmade hath not anything in the
[1:08:54] house
[1:08:57] wonder what size that little pot of oil
[1:09:00] was
[1:09:01] what's it take to make a pot
[1:09:05] a voss as some would say
[1:09:09] vase if you're american
[1:09:13] balls i don't know how big
[1:09:17] she's got a pot of oil was this thing
[1:09:21] so big that our sister you know had to
[1:09:23] jack it up on a chair
[1:09:25] later to use it no my brother and sister
[1:09:28] you see
[1:09:30] little is big when god is in it
[1:09:35] we don't need some fantastics we need
[1:09:37] god
[1:09:38] in it hallelujah she says all i've got
[1:09:41] is this little pot of oil
[1:09:42] now let's follow these words for just a
[1:09:44] few minutes here amen the stage is being
[1:09:47] set
[1:09:48] because our god is in control so he
[1:09:50] tells her then
[1:09:51] makes no connection gives no explanation
[1:09:53] that would throw a lot of us right out
[1:09:56] because we would god to explain this to
[1:09:58] us before we could ever activate our
[1:10:00] faith
[1:10:00] to take a hold of this now i want to
[1:10:02] know why you want me to borrow all these
[1:10:05] vessels i want to know why i need to go
[1:10:07] to every neighbor and get not just a few
[1:10:09] i need to know what and what am i going
[1:10:11] to do with whatever you're going to do
[1:10:13] when it's all over so if you'll tell me
[1:10:15] i'll have enough faith
[1:10:17] to actually believe that you're going to
[1:10:19] do something
[1:10:20] no why don't we just get to the place we
[1:10:22] just believe the word
[1:10:24] amen when the word comes forth and says
[1:10:26] repent
[1:10:27] my brother and sister let's not go well
[1:10:29] do i really have oh this is a catch some
[1:10:31] people will stumble over this

[1:11:09] lord anoint me i want to repent
[1:11:12] sweep the house lord
[1:11:15] sweep the house reminds me of a story i
[1:11:20] read once
[1:11:21] about this this lady there was a point
[1:11:24] to it i won't go into the whole story
[1:11:26] but this lady hired an elderly lady to
[1:11:29] clean her house
[1:11:31] the lady needed some extra help and uh
[1:11:34] income and so she hires this lady older
[1:11:37] lady to sweep the house
[1:11:39] but this lady had labored for her 80
[1:11:41] some years of her life and
[1:11:43] and her back was kind of hunched and and
[1:11:45] she couldn't really straighten up
[1:11:47] and you know every day this lady went
[1:11:49] through the house
[1:11:50] she wiped down everything she washed
[1:11:53] everything
[1:11:54] she swept everything and one day
[1:11:57] this uh rich lady or the the lady of the
[1:12:00] house
[1:12:02] a friend come over and she said i don't
[1:12:03] know why you keep this woman
[1:12:06] because the floor is spotless but look
[1:12:08] at the cobwebs
[1:12:10] and the lady answered and said she
[1:12:13] is taking care of everything she
[1:12:17] can see
[1:12:23] god open our eyes open our eyes lord let
[1:12:26] there not be
[1:12:27] one hindrance that we would come with
[1:12:31] one thing
[1:12:32] we didn't see
[1:12:35] anyway going on in the story the lady
[1:12:37] says well well the cowboys or whatever
[1:12:40] and she said that's fine
[1:12:41] that's my fault i should have knocked
[1:12:43] him down yesterday
[1:12:46] you see my brother and sister you can't
[1:12:48] fix what you can't see
[1:12:50] and that's the same comes with
[1:12:51] revelation in the word of god you can't
[1:12:53] believe
[1:12:54] what you don't see amen god open our
[1:12:57] eyes
[1:12:58] open our eyes lord let us see it lord
[1:13:01] let our hearts believe it
[1:13:02] right hallelujah so it's there
[1:13:06] he tells her go borrow these vessels
[1:13:09] and uh of all your neighbors not just
[1:13:11] those you got along with
[1:13:13] that might have been awkward huh knock
[1:13:15] on the door of somebody you wasn't
[1:13:16] really friends with
[1:13:17] i know you and i don't get along too
[1:13:19] well but i need all the empty vessels in
[1:13:22] your house
[1:13:24] well you know there comes a time the
[1:13:25] anointing can you only imagine what
[1:13:27] egypt looked like when israel under that
[1:13:29] anointing
[1:13:30] pillaged the egyptians for their food
[1:13:33] their carts their ox and all of these
[1:13:35] things
[1:13:36] they went with the confidence hallelujah
[1:13:38] well let us not be afraid to knock on
[1:13:40] the door and say
[1:13:41] if you got an empty vessel inside of
[1:13:43] your house it needs to go to my house
[1:13:47] hallelujah because i got a miracle on
[1:13:49] the way
[1:13:50] i got a supernatural move of god coming
[1:13:53] to my house
[1:13:54] hallelujah amen borrow not a few
[1:13:59] and when thou art come in now look at
[1:14:02] this my brother and sister there's so
[1:14:03] many types in scripture
[1:14:04] that tie to this we're not going to go
[1:14:06] to them all this morning
[1:14:08] or even just a handful but my brother
[1:14:10] and sister you see the ark
[1:14:12] my brother and sister at the time of the
[1:14:14] flood the ark
[1:14:16] the door had to be shut before the
[1:14:19] blessings fell
[1:14:20] wait blessings that was a curse no it
[1:14:22] was only a curse my brother and sister
[1:14:24] to those that were outside the word
[1:14:26] everyone that was inside the word it was
[1:14:28] a blessing
[1:14:29] hallelujah it all depends on what you're
[1:14:32] looking at
[1:14:33] amen you get to looking at laodicea and
[1:14:36] how filthy it is
[1:14:37] well praise the lord you're getting an
[1:14:39] idea what sodom looked like amen
[1:14:42] we're not here to look at the the world
[1:14:45] out here and say oh oh oh
[1:14:46] horrible horrible you know what no my
[1:14:48] brother and sister we should be sighing
[1:14:50] and crying
[1:14:51] but you know what you ought to look at
[1:14:52] that because he said he's not coming
[1:14:54] back
[1:14:54] until the world looks like sodom
[1:14:57] that's a little hard to pray for isn't
[1:14:59] it lord let the world hurry up
[1:15:03] and look like sodom
[1:15:09] brings us to some paradoxes doesn't it
[1:15:13] i'll tell you what it does it breaks
[1:15:15] your heart when good people
[1:15:18] out here are caught and they think
[1:15:21] they're serving god
[1:15:26] you know it's kind of scary when you see
[1:15:29] brother branham
[1:15:30] talked 60 years ago
[1:15:34] how that that spirit would be such in
[1:15:35] the church that they would say well
[1:15:37] praise god i'm sealed i've got the holy
[1:15:39] ghost
[1:15:39] i can drink a little bit i can dance a
[1:15:41] little bit i can do all of these things
[1:15:44] and it don't bother me we are living
[1:15:48] in that day
[1:15:51] we are living i have got friends men
[1:15:53] that are good men they got good families
[1:15:56] they're caught up in a world that that
[1:16:01] they can go and drink smoke cigars
[1:16:04] dance all these kind of things and say
[1:16:07] i've got the holy ghost
[1:16:10] oh my brother and sister the prophet
[1:16:12] warned us said that you could be
[1:16:13] anointed
[1:16:14] in this flesh all the days of your life
[1:16:19] we need something deeper than just on
[1:16:20] this flesh
[1:16:22] we need something my brother and sister
[1:16:24] that can't be taken away
[1:16:27] hallelujah
[1:16:30] thou shalt shut the door
[1:16:33] you see now her being obedient to what
[1:16:36] elisha
[1:16:38] told her to do required that every
[1:16:40] portion
[1:16:41] now some would say you know this sounds
[1:16:43] like legalism in the church well
[1:16:45] that's good my brother and sister if you
[1:16:47] want to call it legalism that's fine
[1:16:49] but you'll find over and over again in
[1:16:51] the bible that god expected his word to
[1:16:53] be followed word by word
[1:16:55] amen we can't cut out a paragraph we
[1:16:58] can't rearrange it
[1:16:59] god wants it done the way god wants it
[1:17:02] done
[1:17:03] and so he tells her now when you come in
[1:17:05] shut the door upon thee and upon thy
[1:17:07] sons only them
[1:17:08] in the house as it were and shalt pour
[1:17:11] out
[1:17:11] into all those vessels now shall set
[1:17:14] aside that which is full
[1:17:16] so she went from him shut the door upon
[1:17:19] her and upon her sons
[1:17:21] who brought the vessels to her and she
[1:17:23] poured out
[1:17:25] oh now saints now don't get me wrong we
[1:17:27] have our ups and downs we have our days
[1:17:28] we have our struggles
[1:17:32] when's the last time you poured out
[1:17:35] that's it come on i'm not talking about
[1:17:38] just praying
[1:17:39] that's right i'm talking about when was
[1:17:42] the last time
[1:17:43] we poured out come on church
[1:17:46] let's get some rubber right down on the
[1:17:47] road so we can go somewhere
[1:17:49] amen if we're not pouring out saints
[1:17:51] we're not going to get filled back
[1:17:52] up right but if you don't pour out
[1:17:56] the oil just becomes stagnant oil you
[1:17:59] see
[1:17:59] oh i'm going to jump ahead of myself but
[1:18:01] i want to make the point right now you
[1:18:02] see
[1:18:03] elisha did not tell her to go fill the
[1:18:05] back patio
[1:18:06] full of jars of oil you see the oil
[1:18:09] would have ended up with pollywogs and
[1:18:11] all kinds of this and that
[1:18:13] and dust upon it or whatever so while
[1:18:15] the oil was
[1:18:16] fresh he tells it go sell the oil there
[1:18:19] are so many types we won't even be able
[1:18:21] to
[1:18:21] come close to touching them this morning
[1:18:23] but my brother and sister
[1:18:24] sons and daughters of god you and i
[1:18:27] this morning operate on the holy ghost
[1:18:31] you realize that we cannot go out here
[1:18:34] and
[1:18:34] feed on the things of the world and live
[1:18:36] a godly life
[1:18:37] we every time that we start putting
[1:18:39] something else in the vessel
[1:18:42] amen we end up sputtering and spitting
[1:18:45] and whatever else
[1:18:46] my brother and sister but when the oil
[1:18:48] is in the vessel
[1:18:49] then the life that is in the oil is in
[1:18:52] you and i
[1:18:53] and then we can live right through this
[1:18:56] most wicked time
[1:18:57] we don't have to cry say we're going to
[1:18:58] go hide in the mountains somewhere
[1:19:00] we can stand we can send our kids if you
[1:19:03] choose to
[1:19:04] send them to public school it's actually
[1:19:05] a waste because they've proven now
[1:19:07] that about 60 65 percent of the time in
[1:19:10] public school
[1:19:11] is used for other things other than
[1:19:13] educating your child
[1:19:14] so uh if you want to just waste a
[1:19:16] portion of your child's life you'll
[1:19:18] probably send them to public school
[1:19:19] but if you want to educate your child
[1:19:21] you'll probably have to bring them home
[1:19:23] amen and start teaching something based
[1:19:26] out of the bible
[1:19:27] and isn't that wonderful you can step
[1:19:29] right out the door
[1:19:30] and uh there is a little bit of flora
[1:19:32] and there's a little bit of fauna
[1:19:34] and there's a little bit of mountains
[1:19:36] and there's a cloud and there's a sun
[1:19:37] and a moon and there's stars
[1:19:39] and there's a river and there's a fish
[1:19:41] and a frog my goodness do we need to
[1:19:43] coop kids up in a building
[1:19:44] by somebody that don't even know their
[1:19:46] own gender to tell our kids they don't
[1:19:48] know their gender
[1:19:49] so that we can tell them that the world
[1:19:51] was come from moss on a pawn
[1:19:53] and a spontaneous spark come on my
[1:19:56] brother and sister
[1:19:58] it's about time we got a grip on what's
[1:20:01] happening out there
[1:20:02] amen you talk about the pond with the
[1:20:05] moss and the methane gas
[1:20:06] that is our public schools hallelujah
[1:20:10] and the spark that they got is there is
[1:20:12] no god and it doesn't matter what you
[1:20:14] are or what they do to you
[1:20:16] it's all good because we're free well
[1:20:20] bondage was considered ultimate freedom
[1:20:23] yeah look at the roman empire
[1:20:26] you'll find the perfect historical
[1:20:28] example
[1:20:30] the highest form of freedom we do
[1:20:32] anything we please and it killed them
[1:20:37] did i miss that point amen
[1:20:41] so what did she do she goes from the
[1:20:43] prophet
[1:20:44] now i didn't bring a message book out
[1:20:46] here with me but symbolically
[1:20:48] she goes from the prophet how far did
[1:20:51] she get
[1:20:52] not very far from the prophet why
[1:20:54] because she took his words
[1:20:56] in her heart she took his words in her
[1:20:59] mind
[1:21:00] and so she only could get as far away
[1:21:03] from
[1:21:04] as it were the prophet as far as she got
[1:21:07] away from the word
[1:21:08] so if she was in the word the word was
[1:21:11] in her
[1:21:12] then she was if you catch my point this
[1:21:14] morning she was
[1:21:15] in the prophet right she was right there
[1:21:17] with him
[1:21:18] amen and i tell you my brother and
[1:21:20] sister it don't apply any different
[1:21:22] you can't reject the message of this
[1:21:23] hour and say that you are in jesus
[1:21:25] christ because this message of this hour
[1:21:28] is jesus christ amen so as close as you
[1:21:32] state to the word is how close you'll be
[1:21:33] to christ
[1:21:35] hallelujah oh my
[1:21:38] so she went she shut the door upon her
[1:21:41] and her sons
[1:21:42] now my brother and sister if you want to
[1:21:44] talk about something that might catch
[1:21:46] the attention
[1:21:47] of a child is to see parents following
[1:21:50] the word
[1:21:51] exactly that's right don't tell me our
[1:21:54] kids
[1:21:54] aren't smart enough to figure this out
[1:21:58] we don't fool anybody in fact our kids
[1:22:00] in most cases have
[1:22:01] really got us wrapped around their
[1:22:03] finger because you know you've got
[1:22:06] my well we won't go there praise the
[1:22:08] lord
[1:22:10] we'll save that for another day
[1:22:14] so what she do closes the door
[1:22:18] her sons start bringing vessels to her
[1:22:22] you know what she started doing
[1:22:26] trying to figure out what was going on
[1:22:33] no she took
[1:22:37] her little pot of oil i'd pick that
[1:22:40] thing up except for i'll
[1:22:41] end up dumping them on the floor and
[1:22:43] then i'll have to clean up the mess
[1:22:44] and we'll just i don't know
[1:22:48] maybe it was about like that something
[1:22:49] that a sister
[1:22:51] could handle and her son imagine
[1:22:55] this is going to take faith saints this
[1:22:57] wasn't just something that she just went
[1:22:59] well praise the lord son throw it down
[1:23:01] here and we'll fill her up
[1:23:04] no the human sense said there's only
[1:23:07] this much oil
[1:23:11] the human sense would say i'm not sure
[1:23:13] what it would be
[1:23:14] that i'm going to pour the oil from my
[1:23:18] jar
[1:23:18] into this jar and from that jar into
[1:23:22] this jar
[1:23:23] you see that's where the human element
[1:23:25] would take us there's only so
[1:23:27] much oil oh but when you will just
[1:23:31] follow the word and say you know what
[1:23:33] god would not have brought this word
[1:23:35] would not have given me this word would
[1:23:37] not have opened this word up to me
[1:23:39] for me to sit down with some kind of
[1:23:42] mathematical formula
[1:23:43] to figure out how it would be because i
[1:23:45] can tell you what the mathematical
[1:23:47] formula would be
[1:23:48] as you poured the oil from vessel to
[1:23:50] vessel it would decrease because it
[1:23:52] would always leave a residue
[1:23:55] so if you're going to do this in the
[1:23:56] kernel you're going to decrease and
[1:23:58] decrease and decrease
[1:23:59] until all you've got is a bunch of
[1:24:01] vessels that got oil on them and a
[1:24:03] dropper two on the floor here and there
[1:24:04] but if you just take that word and you
[1:24:07] said you know what this is what god
[1:24:08] asked me to do
[1:24:09] he asked me to go repent get baptized
[1:24:12] amen
[1:24:12] he said he'd fill me with the holy ghost
[1:24:14] amen i'm just going to pour it out
[1:24:16] i'm just going to let it happen i'm
[1:24:18] going to see what god's got in store for
[1:24:20] me
[1:24:21] and she must have been there something
[1:24:23] happening oh my brother and sister
[1:24:25] something happening when she pours that
[1:24:28] first vessel full of oil
[1:24:30] and then she lifts it back up oh i don't
[1:24:33] know what her vessel looked like
[1:24:35] it might have if she had went by sight
[1:24:38] looked in there and there's no more oil
[1:24:40] in there you don't know i don't know
[1:24:43] man i don't think that vessel had to
[1:24:44] suddenly be bubbling out the top
[1:24:47] oh it might have been that she could
[1:24:49] have looked at my
[1:24:50] by walking by sight she might have said
[1:24:53] whoa i just poured it all out
[1:24:54] but wait i have this much and that
[1:24:56] vessel's full bring me another
[1:25:00] bring me another i need god to come on
[1:25:02] the scene he came on the scene yesterday
[1:25:05] i need him to come on the scene today
[1:25:08] i'm going to
[1:25:09] pour it out i'm gonna believe god is
[1:25:13] coming on this scene today
[1:25:15] i believe god's gonna move in my life
[1:25:17] today
[1:25:18] i believe god's will will be done today
[1:25:21] get more room for the holy ghost in
[1:25:24] their house
[1:25:26] oh hallelujah oh not i got this i got
[1:25:30] that my brother and sister
[1:25:32] let my house let your house be
[1:25:35] overflowing
[1:25:36] amen let every single vessel you can
[1:25:39] find oh hallelujah
[1:25:43] oh so what's happening here
[1:25:47] amen the word
[1:25:50] amen remember in the beginning was the
[1:25:53] word
[1:25:54] and the word was i think it's a funny
[1:25:56] funny little cartoon
[1:25:58] man's got a gun and he asked this other
[1:26:00] gentleman he says how do you
[1:26:02] how do you work at this thing what do
[1:26:03] you do he said you pointed at something
[1:26:05] and pulled the trigger and the guy says
[1:26:06] that's all and he said that's all
[1:26:12] my brothers and sister god's not going
[1:26:15] to self-destruct the bride of christ for
[1:26:17] following his directions
[1:26:22] exactly right so what does he tell her
[1:26:28] thou shall shut the door upon thee and
[1:26:30] upon their sons and shall pour out
[1:26:32] into all those vessels and now shall set
[1:26:35] aside
[1:26:36] that which is full amen
[1:26:42] he wasn't just telling her for the sake
[1:26:44] of convenience
[1:26:46] just pour a little into every vessel
[1:26:48] pour it full
[1:26:50] pour it full i know one just anointed by
[1:26:53] the holy ghost saints
[1:26:54] i don't believe you want to just be
[1:26:55] anointed by the holy ghost
[1:26:57] hey man we want god all the way down on
[1:27:00] the inside
[1:27:01] amen amen how's that song go jesus on
[1:27:05] the inside

[1:31:27] my brother and sister she knew what the
[1:31:30] world out there would do
[1:31:31] to her children and when they did come
[1:31:34] out of that debtor's prison as it were
[1:31:36] they wouldn't be the same they would be
[1:31:38] marked or they would be scarred
[1:31:40] they'd be changed in such a fashion he
[1:31:43] would not recognize him and she wasn't
[1:31:46] willing to give
[1:31:47] her children up to a system that would
[1:31:49] put any other mark than the mark of the
[1:31:51] holy ghost
[1:31:53] hallelujah no other mark we're refusing
[1:31:57] to allow any other mark to be placed
[1:32:00] upon that

[1:32:11] what i hear a lot of people now don't
[1:32:13] get me wrong i'm trying to be negative

[1:32:16] words and no action behind it
[1:32:19] come on if footsteps are going to be
[1:32:21] possession my brother and sister
[1:32:22] we can't sit down on the job and say
[1:32:25] well praise the lord
[1:32:26] wherever i go spiritually whatever god
[1:32:29] does for me
[1:32:30] is going to be mine wait you haven't
[1:32:32] moved
[1:32:34] you haven't moved all you've got
[1:32:38] is a size 10 possession
[1:32:42] you don't have a land you don't have a
[1:32:44] nation
[1:32:45] you don't have a spiritual promise
[1:32:47] you've got a size
[1:32:48] 10 possession i need nothing to boast
[1:32:52] about especially when there's people
[1:32:54] around the saints that are marching
[1:32:56] forward you say well i don't know about
[1:32:58] them
[1:32:58] they act a little too spiritual for me

[1:33:01] you what they're doing my brother and
[1:33:02] sister

[1:33:10] might say brother paul you're being
[1:33:11] presumptuous

[1:34:55] snagged a carp

[1:35:54] could pray for you they could anoint you
[1:35:55] with a gallon of oil

[1:37:14] nothing to do with me because if i pass
[1:37:17] from this current life right here
[1:37:20] i'm passing right into the presence of

[1:37:59] fought every inch of grass get in the
[1:38:02] spirit saints
[1:38:04] amen oh
[1:38:07] amen look at this now okay here we go
[1:38:11] whether there's giants whether there's
[1:38:13] atheists whether there's infidels
[1:38:15] where there's cold
[1:38:20] i can deal with infidels and i can deal
[1:38:22] cold formal church
[1:38:28] deacons will you make sure the pastor
[1:38:29] doesn't have a button
[1:38:32] make sure he's got a lifesaver
[1:38:37] because we got our whole sunday planned
[1:38:38] out to the minute
[1:38:40] and if he preaches too long today
[1:38:44] we're not going to be able to go down to
[1:38:46] our favorite mexican restaurant that's
[1:38:47] not open
[1:38:48] anyhow
[1:38:52] come on saints god's tired of our
[1:38:57] god's tired of it god's looking for some
[1:38:59] people that have enough courage to stand
[1:39:02] up and say
[1:39:03] you're talking about me it's me
[1:39:07] oh remember when the prophet was there
[1:39:09] at mishawaka
[1:39:11] remember when he samira's mission walker
[1:39:12] and that colored brother is sitting
[1:39:14] there beside him
[1:39:15] here he is here he is
[1:39:19] hallelujah how about we get to the place
[1:39:21] we're so anointed of god
[1:39:22] that we'd be going saints are you
[1:39:24] looking for the holy ghost here
[1:39:26] he is he's right here he's on the front
[1:39:29] oh oh he's on the second row
[1:39:31] he's on the third to fourth to fifth the
[1:39:32] sixth
[1:39:34] oh he's here now some people say oh
[1:39:37] paul's went nuts again well i want to go
[1:39:40] nut amen because i'll tell you one thing
[1:39:43] as long oh somebody will probably gripe
[1:39:45] at this but look
[1:39:46] as long as god would allow me you as the
[1:39:49] people led of god will allow me to be
[1:39:51] the pastor
[1:39:52] we will not slide into a cold formal
[1:39:55] church
[1:39:57] i will come and i will grab your hands
[1:40:00] and i will
[1:40:00] shake you out of your seat if i have to
[1:40:03] but we are not going to become
[1:40:05] some cold formal yep the prophet said it
[1:40:09] i believe it it might come to pas
[1:40:12] i mean it'll come to pass come on
[1:40:20] look we're going to be cold and formal i
[1:40:22] recommend we all become mormons
[1:40:27] or at least pentecostals pentecostals
[1:40:29] are are more exciting
[1:40:31] the mormons have a much better church
[1:40:33] supported financial system though
[1:40:37] they'll own you money for a house a farm
[1:40:40] anything you know because if you don't
[1:40:41] pick the payments they get to repossess
[1:40:43] it it's theirs anyhow
[1:40:45] you just took care of it for them but if
[1:40:48] you want to get excited let's go be
[1:40:49] pentecostals
[1:40:52] we might run around around and round and
[1:40:54] round
[1:40:55] and not figure out where we went that's
[1:40:57] right
[1:40:59] come on saints i am trying to be a
[1:41:00] little funny i want to shake you out of
[1:41:03] your deal
[1:41:04] we were called to be cold and formal
[1:41:06] brother paul you just don't know my
[1:41:08] circumstance i don't but god does
[1:41:10] amen why don't you ask god to shake the
[1:41:14] bat

[1:41:17] bats in the belfry get god to shake the
[1:41:19] bell free

[1:41:30] stay back and say well i believe the
[1:41:32] days of miracles past
[1:41:33] oh i don't know don't do that don't look
[1:41:36] like a
[1:41:37] that don't look like a child of abraham
[1:41:39] no matter how
[1:41:40] far along the promise seemed to hold out
[1:41:43] well it went
[1:41:44] on talking about abraham went on for 25
[1:41:47] years
[1:41:48] but instead of abraham getting weaker he
[1:41:50] got stronger all the time
[1:41:52] for he knowed it would be a greater
[1:41:55] miracle
[1:41:56] all the time well ask the lord for
[1:41:59] healing
[1:42:00] don't be sitting there saying well i
[1:42:01] haven't got my healing got my healing

[1:42:05] days go by
[1:42:06] it will be a greater miracle

[1:42:21] recently
[1:42:22] just a little something i happened to
[1:42:24] come across and he made an awesome point
[1:42:27] and and uh if i'd have thought of this i
[1:42:29] would have brought my phone out here
[1:42:31] and he held up his cell phone pulled it
[1:42:33] out of his back pocket you know how
[1:42:34] these skinny jeans
[1:42:35] preachers are you know go lift weights
[1:42:38] right before you go to church so your
[1:42:40] arms are pumped up
[1:42:41] wear your son's t-shirt your skinny
[1:42:43] jeans come out
[1:42:48] that was probably a bad image
[1:42:52] pulls his phone out he made an awesome
[1:42:54] point though pulls his phone out
[1:42:58] he said we live in such
[1:43:01] an instant age
[1:43:06] and all over the church
[1:43:19] lord i want healed
[1:43:26] no trust no patience
[1:43:31] he knowed it would be a greater miracle
[1:43:34] all the time oh
[1:43:38] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:43:41] my brother and sister that's what god's
[1:43:43] doing
[1:43:44] amen imagine how that little lady felt
[1:43:48] that little sister felt
[1:43:50] her arms are getting tired her mind is
[1:43:52] thinking well
[1:43:53] this is enough this is enough but he
[1:43:56] told her
[1:43:57] to keep filling them full she kept right
[1:44:00] on
[1:44:01] filling them full and her sons got
[1:44:04] involved
[1:44:05] they got to see the hand of god moving
[1:44:08] they got to see a miracle
[1:44:09] unfolding they got to see the word of
[1:44:12] the prophet
[1:44:13] coming to pass you know the problem we
[1:44:16] have saints this way too many people
[1:44:18] have just enough personal doubts about
[1:44:21] what they believe
[1:44:22] that their children pick up on that
[1:44:23] that's right
[1:44:25] you know what they say now i know we're
[1:44:26] headed a little random here forgive me
[1:44:30] did they say that a dog and a horse
[1:44:34] can both sense your fear
[1:44:39] i remember one time a guy walked up to
[1:44:42] this dog
[1:44:43] the owner says whoa he bites and the guy
[1:44:45] said this dog ain't biting me walked
[1:44:47] right up grabbed that dog by the scruff
[1:44:49] of the neck started wrestling around the
[1:44:50] guy's life
[1:44:52] there was a guy with him and said cool
[1:44:54] he ain't biting me either
[1:45:01] yeah that guy landed on the other side
[1:45:04] of that four foot fence
[1:45:06] that dog invited me from out here
[1:45:09] [Laughter]
[1:45:13] come on saints if we believe it
[1:45:18] let's make sure parents come on parents
[1:45:20] listen to me if we believe it make sure
[1:45:22] your children
[1:45:24] know you believe it
[1:45:27] live it in front of them tell them this
[1:45:30] is the truth and this is why it's truth
[1:45:32] it isn't truth
[1:45:33] because i said so it isn't truth because
[1:45:35] brother branham said so
[1:45:37] it's truth because the word of god said
[1:45:40] so
[1:45:41] and we stand on the word we believe the
[1:45:43] word we are the word
[1:45:45] and watch it children i'm going to keep
[1:45:48] pouring kids
[1:45:49] you just keep believing you keep
[1:45:52] believing children
[1:45:54] that god's in the miracle-working
[1:45:56] business
[1:45:57] god is in the saving business god is in
[1:45:59] the healing business
[1:46:01] god is in the delivering business
[1:46:04] hallelujah
[1:46:05] hallelujah what was she doing my brother
[1:46:07] and sister

[1:46:14] another a jug of oil here i sure hope
[1:46:16] this works i don't know what i'm doing
[1:46:17] with this
[1:46:18] you know what at the point i don't think
[1:46:19] she had a clue
[1:46:21] that's why i think she went back to the
[1:46:23] prophet
[1:46:24] and said i you know i'm just going to
[1:46:27] make up a number
[1:46:29] i've got a hundred vessels of oil in my
[1:46:32] house
[1:46:35] what do i do now
[1:46:38] well i tell you what you do because now
[1:46:42] i hope you catch this time
[1:46:44] the holy ghost is what fuels you and i
[1:46:48] that's why you can't get one filling and
[1:46:50] just go on
[1:46:51] and on and on and on you've got to have
[1:46:53] another refilling another refilling
[1:46:56] for years i have typed it to the car
[1:46:58] imagine we're going to go to chicago
[1:47:00] amen we jump even in brother david or
[1:47:03] brother bob's a little prius amen
[1:47:05] why you know they make i i burn more gas
[1:47:08] starting my vehicles than they do
[1:47:10] driving around town
[1:47:13] but we won't get in their car and think
[1:47:15] we are driving to chicago
[1:47:18] without filling up the tank
[1:47:22] that's what the holy ghost is fill up
[1:47:25] the tank
[1:47:27] fill up the vessel live life to the
[1:47:30] fullest
[1:47:31] stop fill up the vessel live life to the
[1:47:34] fullest again
[1:47:35] stop fill up the vessel hallelujah
[1:47:40] i've said this for years that this
[1:47:43] young people especially this i find it
[1:47:45] very responsive in
[1:47:46] in south america young people i tell
[1:47:48] them you can be
[1:47:50] almost anything on this earth that you
[1:47:52] want to be
[1:47:53] and serve god there's a few jobs um we
[1:47:57] all know obviously
[1:47:58] you're not going to take and serve god
[1:48:01] you want to build the airplane you're
[1:48:04] going to serve god you want to fly the
[1:48:05] airplane you can serve god you want to
[1:48:07] jump out of the airplane you can serve
[1:48:08] god
[1:48:10] you want to be a brain surgeon i
[1:48:13] remember one meeting i said you can be a
[1:48:14] brain surgeon this young man jumped up
[1:48:16] and said
[1:48:16] hallelujah that's what i want to be
[1:48:18] brother paul
[1:48:20] okay finally after all the meetings i
[1:48:23] found somebody that actually
[1:48:25] wanted to be my brother and sister
[1:48:29] just make sure the vessel is full
[1:48:34] the oil is sufficient
[1:48:37] okay let me hurry let me let me hurry
[1:48:41] here
[1:48:42] oh my
[1:48:47] let me just go right on down here
[1:48:50] do you realize now i just want to make
[1:48:52] this point do you realize that she was
[1:48:55] pouring out the miracle was growing by
[1:48:58] the moment
[1:49:04] now the word doesn't show us how many
[1:49:06] vessels but it's irrelevant
[1:49:07] because she had a little jar and now
[1:49:10] she's filling
[1:49:11] vessels over and over and over again
[1:49:16] hallelujah i get excited thinking about
[1:49:19] that
[1:49:20] amen oh now look
[1:49:25] i said this earlier but this is really
[1:49:26] where it was at my notes little
[1:49:29] is big when god is in it
[1:49:32] look we're now in our sister's house
[1:49:34] we're looking
[1:49:36] you know what we see oil
[1:49:40] right she's pouring oil vessel
[1:49:44] to vessel to vessel
[1:49:47] but if we looked at it from god's eyes
[1:49:50] that house would have been clear full of
[1:49:53] the shekinah glory of god
[1:49:56] angels would have been present they
[1:49:58] would have been there
[1:49:59] what would it was it oil in the house
[1:50:03] no he's in the house
[1:50:06] he's in the house there's where the
[1:50:08] difference at he's in the house
[1:50:11] my brother and sister you need a miracle
[1:50:13] in your life you need a miracle in your
[1:50:14] family you got a circumstance you think
[1:50:16] is
[1:50:16] just unfixable and curable or one
[1:50:18] whatever
[1:50:19] get him in the house amen don't sit
[1:50:22] there and say well if if get him in the
[1:50:24] house
[1:50:25] amen hallelujah and when the vessels
[1:50:28] were full she said unto her son bring me
[1:50:29] yet
[1:50:30] a vessel and he said unto her there is
[1:50:32] not a vessel more
[1:50:34] and the oil stayed in other words it's
[1:50:36] saying there that the oil
[1:50:38] my brother and sister i believe i might
[1:50:39] be interpreting the scripture forgive me
[1:50:41] if i am i don't mean it for any other
[1:50:42] reason
[1:50:43] but i believe when she finally got done
[1:50:45] she looked back in the very original
[1:50:47] vessel
[1:50:47] and it had the same exact amount of oil
[1:50:52] it never diminished and she looked
[1:50:55] around if she had walked from room to
[1:50:56] room
[1:50:57] every single vessel that she got
[1:51:00] completely full
[1:51:02] was still completely
[1:51:05] oh hallelujah man i tell you what i'd
[1:51:08] like to preach to that household
[1:51:10] because everywhere you went there would
[1:51:12] have been oil hallelujah
[1:51:14] they'd have been the holy ghost
[1:51:15] everywhere you went now look at this i i
[1:51:17] want to just go
[1:51:18] a minute longer here amen look it's come
[1:51:21] to a place friend
[1:51:22] i shared this quote wednesday night i
[1:51:23] want to share it again it stirred my
[1:51:25] heart enough
[1:51:26] it's come to a place friend where the
[1:51:27] world is so awful it's going to make you
[1:51:29] prove
[1:51:30] every inch of ground you stand on
[1:51:32] satan's going to do it and it's coming
[1:51:34] to a time
[1:51:35] where impersonations and carnal thinking
[1:51:38] is going to be circumcised from the real
[1:51:40] true body of christ
[1:51:42] see what's happening are ideas my
[1:51:44] brother and sister
[1:51:45] that god will do this and god will do
[1:51:47] that and we can do this and we can do
[1:51:49] that
[1:51:49] god's trimming them away amen he's
[1:51:52] cutting us right back to the true word
[1:51:55] amen not to a man-made theology not to a
[1:51:58] tradition
[1:52:00] amen not to be message whatever's you
[1:52:02] know hyphenated i'm a message mormon i'm
[1:52:05] a message baptist i'm a message
[1:52:06] methodist
[1:52:07] no my brother and sister cutting us
[1:52:09] right back to jesus christ
[1:52:11] the message amen so you look at that now

[1:54:24] something that makes this bible
[1:54:26] live again oh hallelujah
[1:54:30] can you imagine my brother and sister in
[1:54:32] such a short time
[1:54:33] this sister by going back now look it
[1:54:36] all depends on how you view it some
[1:54:37] people get nervous about these things
[1:54:39] i myself for years have been had been
[1:54:41] are kind of a little nervous when people
[1:54:43] start doing this
[1:54:44] but sometimes you just see how god's
[1:54:45] word is so what did she do
[1:54:47] she went back to the prophet elisha
[1:54:50] the prophet elisha was not god but he
[1:54:53] was
[1:54:54] god's point of contact for her
[1:54:57] and we had a point of contact in our day
[1:54:59] that brought a word my brother and
[1:55:01] sister
[1:55:01] we cannot go to him he has gone from the
[1:55:04] scene
[1:55:05] but the word and the message that he
[1:55:07] himself
[1:55:08] said that jesus christ amen is our
[1:55:11] prophet
[1:55:12] oh so what are we doing we're going to
[1:55:15] our prophet
[1:55:16] and he's giving us guidance and imagine
[1:55:18] she goes
[1:55:19] in such a short time talk about the
[1:55:22] power of the word
[1:55:23] she goes from such a short time her
[1:55:25] children going to be taken
[1:55:26] by the creditor to become bondsmen
[1:55:31] to completely free and not only that god
[1:55:33] gives sufficiency for her
[1:55:35] to live off of going forward
[1:55:39] she didn't wake up the next morning and
[1:55:40] say lord what are we going to do about
[1:55:42] today
[1:55:43] no god solved that problem he said i
[1:55:46] filled my holy ghost up in you
[1:55:48] amen it seeped into the very fiber of
[1:55:51] your being
[1:55:52] it cannot be separated not even with
[1:55:55] fire not even with force
[1:55:58] no hallelujah i'll tell you how sure it
[1:56:02] is
[1:56:02] when people ask the prophet of god
[1:56:04] questions about what would happen to
[1:56:05] those that were buried
[1:56:06] in the sea and those that were burnt up
[1:56:08] and he said what will happen is
[1:56:10] i'm paraphrasing it those ashes those
[1:56:12] molecules come right up out of that sea
[1:56:15] they'll come every one of them because
[1:56:17] they know their place in the body
[1:56:19] it wasn't just flesh it was flesh of his
[1:56:22] flesh
[1:56:23] it wasn't bone it was bone of his bone
[1:56:27] god can no more forsake himself saints
[1:56:30] he could no more forsake you and i
[1:56:32] than he could forsake himself because we
[1:56:35] have become flesh of his flesh
[1:56:37] and bone of his bone we are jesus christ
[1:56:40] but if it's down in your bones it's down
[1:56:44] in your heart and soul
[1:56:45] it's down in the fiber of your being
[1:56:48] when he calls that word home
[1:56:50] right down to the very morrow of our
[1:56:52] bones right into the very depths of our
[1:56:55] soul
[1:56:55] and i just read where the prophet of god
[1:56:57] said you might not even be leaving just
[1:57:00] quite right
[1:57:00] but god sees your heart and he
[1:57:03] oh my brother and sister if we are off
[1:57:07] i have confidence now look a individual
[1:57:11] shared with me here the other days
[1:57:12] thought i kind of have a little bit of a
[1:57:15] more liberal
[1:57:16] view on we can't be deceived and we're
[1:57:18] just we're talking just having a
[1:57:20] conversation
[1:57:21] and i shared with him i said brother no
[1:57:23] i don't have a liberal point of view i
[1:57:25] have confidence
[1:57:26] [Music]
[1:57:27] i have confidence god won't let me be
[1:57:30] deceived
[1:57:31] oh it ain't what paul's gonna do paul
[1:57:33] can be deceived
[1:57:35] paul can be deceived but oh get the holy
[1:57:38] ghost inside of me
[1:57:40] get the holy ghost inside of you immerse
[1:57:43] us to the morrow of our bones and the
[1:57:45] oil of the holy ghost
[1:57:47] and you will not be deceived because
[1:57:50] god could not forsake his own word
[1:57:53] oh hallelujah well it's that
[1:57:57] holy ghost and fire and it's keeping me
[1:58:01] alive
[1:58:02] oh keeping me alive
[1:58:11] [Music]
[1:58:14] oh jesus is keeping me
[1:58:17] alive oh don't you love it it's
[1:58:20] all over me and it's bubbling up
[1:58:24] inside all bubbling up inside yes
[1:58:28] it's bubbling up inside well it's
[1:58:32] all over me and it's bubbling up inside
[1:58:37] oh jesus is keeping me alive
[1:58:43] for it sanctifies me holy and it's
[1:58:46] keeping me alive
[1:58:49] oh keeping me alive yes it's keeping me
[1:58:53] alive
[1:58:54] for it sanctifies me holy
[1:58:57] and it's keeping me alive
[1:59:15] yes it's keeping me alive well i
[1:59:18] prayed it down from heaven and it's
[1:59:21] keeping me alive
[1:59:24] why jesus is keeping me alive
[1:59:30] hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord
[1:59:34] hallelujah you know this world we live
[1:59:37] in will suck the life right out here
[1:59:39] i'm thankful god keeps pouring something
[1:59:41] back inside of me
[1:59:43] hallelujah you know i just want to just
[1:59:45] thinking about this song
[1:59:46] this lady this sister amen
[1:59:50] he paid a debt he did not owe
[1:59:53] elisha could have just said well god
[1:59:56] will be with your sons
[1:59:57] [Music]
[1:59:59] he'll protect them in their time of
[2:00:01] bondage
[2:00:03] and in the permissible will of god
[2:00:05] they'll come one day and be free again
[2:00:08] [Music]
[2:00:09] no god said this is what i send prophets
[2:00:12] on the scene for
[2:00:14] to set my children free hallelujah
[2:00:18] sometimes i use the supernatural and
[2:00:20] sometimes i use
[2:00:22] the supernatural and when i say that
[2:00:25] there actually is a difference
[2:00:26] you see she had to pour tangible oil
[2:00:29] out of a vessel into other vessels
[2:00:33] and when this was all over she had to
[2:00:34] carry that oil
[2:00:36] down to the marketplace and she had to
[2:00:38] sell it
[2:00:42] or the supernatural might have been when
[2:00:44] the debtor creditor
[2:00:45] opened his book one day a page was gone
[2:00:52] and so is the memory of it amen
[2:00:56] hallelujah god chose to use that
[2:01:00] supernatural himself
[2:01:02] and said i can't even find it it's gone
[2:01:06] the sea of my forgetfulness
[2:01:09] it's gone oh hallelujah are you with me
[2:01:12] saints
[2:01:13] see god could have said well i'll just
[2:01:14] make a for you and i'll do this and i'll
[2:01:17] do that no
[2:01:18] no god said what i'm going to do is all
[2:01:20] you got to do is just repent
[2:01:22] just get baptized and then step forward
[2:01:25] in confidence
[2:01:27] lord i want the holy ghost you see we've
[2:01:30] got to we've got to be a bowl of jelly
[2:01:32] and we've got to be so contrite
[2:01:34] but you see there's a degree of
[2:01:35] confidence sense that we as sons and
[2:01:37] daughters of god should have
[2:01:38] he said oh could we practice that
[2:01:42] the lord said the lord said
[2:01:46] the lord said his word said his word
[2:01:50] said his word said
[2:01:53] [Music]
