[32:39] amen
[32:40] you know saints just thinking about this
[32:42] i know um hopefully i'm not speaking out
[32:44] of turn i think
[32:46] brother sergey they're going to go on a
[32:48] little trip to be with some family uh
[32:51] and we want to
[32:53] pray for them on their little travels
[32:55] whatever days that comes and
[32:57] our brother pavel sister joy are going
[32:59] to be traveling up to washington and
[33:02] so we just want to just remember
[33:03] traveling mercies i think
[33:06] the
[33:07] sister sarah and her husband
[33:10] our
[33:14] brother adam sister sarah and the family
[33:16] are going to be traveling to arizona in
[33:18] a few days and
[33:19] we just want the lord traveling mercies
[33:21] with them
[33:23] and anyone else who might be out so
[33:26] let's just go right into the word
[33:27] tonight have quite a bit on my mind and
[33:31] i just want to move right along i want
[33:33] to just speak to you on once again on we
[33:36] are witnesses and um in this in the
[33:39] title of uh what are
[33:42] what my house
[33:43] what our house would say about me or
[33:46] what my house would say about me
[33:48] and we just want to carry that thought a
[33:50] little bit further
[33:52] to realize my brother and sister as um
[33:56] god is so gracious right he puts the
[33:57] mirror of the word in front of us aren't
[33:59] you glad god's got such a beautiful
[34:01] mirror he puts the mirror of the word in
[34:03] front of us that we as sons and
[34:06] daughters of god will not accidentally
[34:09] i want you to think about this the devil
[34:11] would like us to overlook those things
[34:14] in our life
[34:15] he'd like us to kind of justify
[34:19] certain things but god puts a mirror of
[34:20] the word
[34:22] and he causes us to look into that
[34:24] mirror
[34:25] and we see
[34:27] some people say well it's our
[34:28] deficiencies
[34:31] you have no deficiency
[34:33] if you are in jesus christ you have no
[34:37] deficiency
[34:39] unrecognized potentials
[34:42] absolutely
[34:43] but no deficiency amen
[34:46] what my house says about me let's stand
[34:48] and go into the word this evening uh
[34:50] first corinthians the third chapter kind
[34:53] of lengthy here saints in a portion of
[34:55] these scriptures really don't apply to
[34:57] my thought but they're so good i just
[34:59] couldn't pass them over have you ever
[35:01] come to that portion you know did let me
[35:04] just share this did you know
[35:06] that research shows that the first three
[35:10] bites of anything
[35:12] will be the greatest sensory
[35:15] effect upon you
[35:18] everything else that you eat
[35:21] is in the impulse
[35:24] of those
[35:25] sensory moment
[35:28] are you with me
[35:30] that
[35:31] pie that cake that chocolate
[35:35] it's just the first bit
[35:37] that you're trying to meet again but
[35:39] your body will never actually have the
[35:41] same sensory
[35:42] reaction but that is the human element
[35:46] in the spiritual element every time we
[35:50] go into the word
[35:52] it is a greater experience to us
[35:56] than it was before
[35:58] nothing is a past memory nothing is oh i
[36:01] remember when the holy spirit moved me
[36:04] but that moment that the spirit is
[36:06] moving in our midst even tonight is a
[36:09] greater experience than you have ever
[36:12] experienced in your life
[36:14] hallelujah isn't that wonderful aren't
[36:16] you glad we don't live in the flesh
[36:19] amen otherwise we would be as the
[36:21] prophet of god said always looking back
[36:23] always looking back remember the
[36:26] meetings remember the time remember the
[36:29] but god has moved upon us that this
[36:31] moment
[36:32] is our moment
[36:34] to experience the greatest experience in
[36:37] jesus christ that we've ever had amen
[36:39] hallelujah hallelujah first corinthians
[36:42] the third chapter starting the first
[36:44] verse
[36:44] and i brethren
[36:47] oh this is pretty rough scripture okay
[36:49] i hope everybody you're standing up but
[36:51] get your seatbelts on
[36:54] i'd love
[36:55] i'm looking forward the day we meet the
[36:57] apostle paul
[36:59] hallelujah no holds barred
[37:01] tough as nails
[37:03] walk away knowing he loved you
[37:05] to the max
[37:08] and i brethren could not speak unto you
[37:10] as unto spiritual
[37:12] but as unto carnal even as into babes in
[37:15] christ
[37:16] i fed you with milk
[37:19] can you agree with me this is pretty
[37:20] rough
[37:22] i fed you
[37:24] with milk and not with meat for hitherto
[37:27] you were not able to bear it and neither
[37:30] yet now are you able
[37:32] for ye are yet carnal
[37:34] for whereas there is among you envying
[37:37] and strife and divisions are ye not
[37:39] carnal and walk as men
[37:42] for one
[37:43] for while one saith i am of paul and
[37:45] another i'm of apollos
[37:47] are you not carnal
[37:50] who then is paul
[37:51] and who is apollos but ministers by whom
[37:55] he believed even as the lord gave to
[37:58] every man i have planted apollos watered
[38:02] but god. gave the increase
[38:05] i love that saints right there
[38:08] so then neither is he that planteth
[38:10] anything
[38:12] old preachers
[38:14] hear this
[38:16] so then neither is he that planteth
[38:18] anything and neither is he that watereth
[38:20] but god
[38:21] that giveth the increase let us always
[38:24] give the glory to where it belongs
[38:26] amen now he that planteth and he that
[38:29] watereth are one and every man shall
[38:31] receive his own reward according to his
[38:33] own labor
[38:35] for we are laborers together see that's
[38:38] a very key word right there together
[38:41] with god
[38:44] right
[38:45] we just been bound by the word of god
[38:47] directly
[38:49] with god
[38:52] come on
[38:54] you're bound directly this is not little
[38:57] me down here oh woe is me i'm not worthy
[38:59] i'm this i'm that no you are bound
[39:01] directly by the scripture by the apostle
[39:04] paul bound directly to god as a fellow
[39:07] laborer amen
[39:10] hallelujah
[39:12] hallelujah
[39:16] and ye are god's husbandry
[39:18] and this is really the start of my keith
[39:21] for the thought tonight ye are god's
[39:23] building amen according to the grace of
[39:25] god which is given unto me we don't have
[39:28] a laodicean revelation
[39:32] which is jesus christ there's our
[39:34] foundation
[39:35] now if any man build upon this
[39:37] foundation gold silver precious stones
[39:39] would haze stubble see how this is
[39:40] declining
[39:42] every man's work shall be made manifest
[39:44] for the day shall declare it because it
[39:46] shall be revealed by fire and the fire
[39:49] shall try every man's work of what sort
[39:52] it is
[39:53] lord we ask for your blessings upon this
[39:55] evening upon your word in your precious
[39:57] name we pray amen you may be seated
[40:00] saints
[40:05] now as i said paul speak speaks pretty
[40:07] straight to the church and as he's there
[40:10] he's telling him i couldn't even speak
[40:12] to you i couldn't even come to you in a
[40:14] spiritual element i had to come to you
[40:17] and bring this down at the base level
[40:19] and so it's there as he is speaking he's
[40:22] speaking now my brother and sister let's
[40:24] not be ashamed uh the worst thing we can
[40:26] do
[40:27] as christians as as even as new uh
[40:30] christians babes in christ is to try to
[40:34] impersonate a mature christian it is it
[40:37] is nothing to be ashamed of if there's
[40:39] things of the scripture and the
[40:41] struggles of life that we simply
[40:44] recognize i'm not coming to a maturity
[40:47] and instead of acting like we're great
[40:49] and spiritual my brother and sister we
[40:51] should just simply say you know what uh
[40:53] god's still working on me but i'm
[40:55] telling you he's not done with me yet he
[40:57] hasn't left me behind and i love that
[41:00] how the prophet of god you know that man
[41:02] come and said i did this and i did that
[41:04] and then i went back out in sin and i
[41:06] don't even know brother branham what to
[41:08] do and and there's another example of a
[41:10] young woman i don't even know and
[41:12] brother branham tells them very simple
[41:13] he said if there's a yearning in your
[41:16] heart if there's a desire in your heart
[41:19] then god's not finished with you amen i
[41:22] love that simple thing because i don't
[41:24] know about you there was times in my
[41:26] life when i thought you know i know i
[41:28] didn't i i know i didn't blaspheme but
[41:31] surely you know after you crash the car
[41:34] so to speak enough times they're not
[41:36] going to let you drive any longer but
[41:37] you know the lord comes back and there's
[41:39] something a song service tonight touched
[41:41] my heart thinking you know what there it
[41:43] is i i have stumbled i have fallen i
[41:46] have you know struggled but there's
[41:49] something inside that's always stirring
[41:51] always moving nudging us forward you
[41:53] know as it would be the voice get up get
[41:56] up
[41:57] if you read about those that experience
[41:59] the baton
[42:00] death march in the philippines and
[42:02] there's many of these stories i remember
[42:04] reading a very moving story this man
[42:07] says the only reason i'm alive today is
[42:09] there was a fellow another soldier that
[42:11] was a friend of mine and when i
[42:13] collapsed on the road and they were
[42:15] coming and they would ban at them and he
[42:17] said this man was there and he would
[42:19] tell them i am your friend and in the
[42:22] name of friendship stand up
[42:26] how about we be that to one another
[42:28] as brothers and sisters in christ we we
[42:30] want to just come on get back up you
[42:33] stumbled but get back up and keep
[42:35] walking because there's something that
[42:37] god has for us to do now he says here i
[42:40] fed you some milk and i fed you uh you
[42:43] know not really with meat but you know
[42:46] here here's because th this thing that
[42:49] is
[42:50] you know the gospel as it would be
[42:56] you can't handle it
[43:00] do you really understand the depth of
[43:02] that indictment
[43:05] if i preach
[43:07] the message of the hour to you
[43:10] straight you can't handle it
[43:15] that's pretty rough
[43:18] aren't you glad tonight we're not
[43:20] boastful
[43:21] we're just declaring what the word said
[43:22] but aren't you glad tonight that you can
[43:24] hear the word preach
[43:25] it don't need to be watered down it
[43:27] don't need to be buttered up you can
[43:29] hear it preach direct it can come down
[43:32] as it were even pierce you to the very
[43:34] depths of your soul and you would say oh
[43:36] lord forgive me that is something in my
[43:39] life and what do you do you come back
[43:41] for more
[43:42] you don't become offended you don't say
[43:44] well i've i've eaten i'll come back when
[43:46] i'm i'm you know need to feed again no
[43:49] there's something in you that you come
[43:50] back and my brother and sister i want to
[43:52] take from the word tonight and emphasize
[43:54] to you that's nothing less than the holy
[43:57] ghost in you because otherwise we in the
[44:00] human element would say this is just too
[44:02] rough this is too abrasive i want more
[44:04] milk
[44:08] well i mean you can do a lot of things
[44:09] with milk
[44:11] amen
[44:12] you can butter up
[44:18] are you with me
[44:20] and then you can make ice cream out of
[44:22] it
[44:23] to soothe our spirit
[44:28] you can make some of those sweet cream
[44:30] pies
[44:33] but does it bring maturity
[44:37] there's no maturity
[44:39] no matter how sweet
[44:41] we butter this up
[44:44] it brings no maturity
[44:47] and paul just threw it right in their
[44:49] face
[44:50] said you know and you're not even ready
[44:52] for it now
[44:53] so what this is saints i want you to
[44:55] move over tonight i was afraid brother
[44:56] trevor he was just stomping all over
[44:58] things i got nervous brother jay stumped
[45:00] all over things i was getting nervous
[45:02] but you look at this my brother and
[45:04] sister now look at what happens is what
[45:06] paul's really saying to them is you lack
[45:10] maturity this is not some special
[45:12] revelation my brother and sister we can
[45:14] recognize a lot of things in the word of
[45:16] god and not live to that standard it
[45:18] takes maturity and we say oh lord why
[45:20] can't i do this it takes maturity
[45:23] amen you know people think we're going
[45:25] to get to heaven as it were this is kind
[45:26] of the metaphorical thought that people
[45:28] have and everybody's going to be just
[45:30] down but i'm telling you you get to
[45:32] heaven and you're going to meet veterans
[45:33] you're going to meet battle scarred sons
[45:35] and daughters of god who have fought
[45:37] satan on every front can i say that and
[45:40] drive it home to you if there's
[45:42] something in your life that you're
[45:43] struggling with they have fought satan
[45:46] on every front
[45:48] and they won
[45:50] hallelujah that's the kind of people
[45:51] we're going to meet when we get there
[45:53] and but here's the thing that's so
[45:54] beautiful when they see you as it were
[45:57] metaphorically walking into heaven
[45:59] they're not going to see a bunch of lily
[46:00] white oh praise the lord
[46:03] they're going to see battle scarred
[46:04] veterans their own self
[46:06] oh praise the lord thank you lord unless
[46:08] of course you don't want to pray for
[46:10] patience
[46:13] maybe you won't have that scar on you no
[46:15] i'm here to tell you you'll have that
[46:17] scar whether you wanted it or not
[46:19] amen
[46:21] anybody praying lately for patience
[46:24] hallelujah i have to admit i have been
[46:26] and i i sometimes i get up in the
[46:28] morning and i say lord what was i
[46:30] thinking
[46:31] but i tell you what it's working
[46:34] amen so look at this now he's telling
[46:36] them
[46:38] you got to you're lacking maturity and
[46:40] look how he quantifies this now the word
[46:42] quantify i use that quite a bit my
[46:44] brother and sister but you see what he's
[46:46] doing is he's taking measure of their
[46:49] position and and showing them where you
[46:52] are now my brother and sister
[46:54] if you're standing at a scale for height
[46:56] or a scale for weight or you've got a
[46:58] measuring cup in your hand you can't
[47:00] take a measuring cup and and uh and and
[47:04] fill it full and say i have one cup and
[47:06] i'm going to claim this as a whole
[47:07] gallon it don't work it is what it is
[47:10] right so you take measure and you see
[47:13] this and and he says you know the reason
[47:15] i know you're lacking maturity and i
[47:17] want you to think about this saints
[47:18] the reason i know that you're lacking
[47:20] maturity that you're still carnal is
[47:23] because i can look around and see envy
[47:25] and strife
[47:27] and divisions
[47:28] isn't this interesting he didn't come on
[47:31] bear with me he didn't come and put a
[47:34] measurement on all the sisters skirts
[47:36] you know and the knee and hair and this
[47:39] and that and he didn't look in that my
[47:41] brother and sister he he didn't have to
[47:43] go that deep
[47:45] he saw envying strife and division
[47:49] and it says look you guys are immature
[47:53] have you ever noticed that when we get
[47:55] right
[47:56] get anointed of the holy ghost all the
[47:58] other little peripheral things
[48:00] just fall right in place
[48:03] i remember time talking to a brother and
[48:05] he was talking about he said and brother
[48:08] brown talks about this only he was
[48:09] dealing with the denominational spirit
[48:11] which we shouldn't have to
[48:13] but you know a brother was telling me
[48:14] goes oh just i'm preaching about clothes
[48:17] in our church all the time and it just
[48:19] seems like it gets worse and we were
[48:21] just visiting i'm good enough friends
[48:22] with this brother and i just said you
[48:24] know brother um
[48:26] maybe
[48:28] you know country folk you know i'm
[48:29] talking about maybe you're barking the
[48:30] wrong tree
[48:39] if we get the holy ghost in
[48:45] all the rest is take care of itself
[48:48] don't do this don't do that don't do
[48:50] this don't do that you should this you
[48:51] should
[48:52] skip the holy ghost in
[48:54] and when the holy ghost gets in
[48:56] there's only so much room in this vessel
[48:59] when the holy ghost comes in it just
[49:00] starts pushing everything else out
[49:04] and you see we can turn into a message
[49:06] of do's and don'ts
[49:08] and still have the don'ts
[49:13] he says you know
[49:15] you got these envy strife division
[49:18] he says are you not carnaling you're
[49:19] walking as men
[49:21] now look at this getting to the point
[49:23] here i got nervous
[49:24] look what the stature of the perfect man
[49:26] is my brother and sister
[49:28] it is not the stature of a perfect man
[49:31] is not a checklist for you and i to just
[49:34] simply say oh here we are i'm so nice to
[49:37] everybody i can check this off
[49:39] what the stature of the perfect man is
[49:43] is the act absolute diagram of the
[49:46] maturity of the bride of christ the more
[49:50] mature she becomes the higher she rises
[49:54] and i like preaching it this way as you
[49:56] look at that pyramid of the statue of
[49:58] the perfect man it is actually showing
[50:01] you the diagram of yourself
[50:04] are you with me
[50:06] the closer you get to perfection the
[50:08] less of you there is
[50:10] it just simply comes down less of me
[50:12] less of me less of me less of me less of
[50:15] me and the less there is of you and i
[50:18] the more of god is on the scene
[50:21] hallelujah and so there the maturity
[50:23] comes not because we can say our church
[50:25] just loves everybody
[50:28] i remember one time visiting a church
[50:30] and you know a brother had told me he
[50:31] says oh our church is just one of the
[50:33] most loving churches well what i didn't
[50:35] realize what he was trying to tell me is
[50:36] every grandmother in that church was
[50:38] planning on hugging me before i got out
[50:40] the back door of the church and so you
[50:42] know it was just like one of the most
[50:43] huggy churches i had ever been to in my
[50:45] life amen sister jerry you know they
[50:48] asked her to stand on one side by the
[50:50] back door and i was on the other side
[50:52] i'm greeting the brothers and every
[50:54] grandmother in that church decided that
[50:56] that young man as they termed me
[50:58] needed a hug from them and you know you
[51:01] talk about awkward saints because as
[51:02] time went on and the church is emptying
[51:04] out the older sisters got younger and
[51:08] younger
[51:09] and it got to the point it was just
[51:10] plain embarrassing
[51:12] that's not the kind of love that we're
[51:13] looking at
[51:15] we are looking at the kind of love that
[51:17] binds us my brother and sister to the
[51:20] word because you know if you love the
[51:23] word you will love your brother and
[51:25] sister around you you can't help it
[51:28] amen oh i'm so in love with the lord and
[51:30] i don't like you
[51:32] no it don't work that way the closer we
[51:34] get to christ the more we will love one
[51:36] another but propriety should ring
[51:39] right we should never cross the lines
[51:41] talking about oh it's because of love
[51:43] amen but he's showing this now how this
[51:46] is coming in the statue of person
[51:48] perfect man expressing maturity in the
[51:51] bride of christ so what happens as the
[51:53] apostle paul is preaching to them there
[51:55] has to be a reconciliation or a way to
[51:58] fix the corinthians problem or laodicean
[52:02] problem and it is there as we start to
[52:04] come into maturity now my brother and
[52:06] sister we come in maturity
[52:09] because we get older
[52:14] no
[52:16] no sir
[52:18] i've seen some really immature
[52:22] 60
[52:24] year old
[52:26] two or three month
[52:28] people
[52:30] anyway we won't go into any details
[52:35] maturity is because you experience fiery
[52:38] trials
[52:39] when god starts to mold the faith in you
[52:42] starts to mold a character in you and
[52:44] the scripture tells us that we ought to
[52:46] rejoice because of those trials no amen
[52:48] how many of you was rejoicing today
[52:52] oh none of you had trials today oh my
[52:55] this is supernatural not a single trial
[52:58] in the church today well look let me
[53:00] stand up here for you
[53:02] hallelujah look but what's god doing
[53:04] he's bringing us to maturity i'm telling
[53:06] you my brother and sister i'm kind of a
[53:08] little light-hearted i hope you don't
[53:09] mind tonight but i'm telling you what
[53:11] happens is it's the first time you ever
[53:14] pray for yourself for someone near you
[53:17] or just someone you don't even know and
[53:19] you see god answer that prayer there's
[53:21] something that energizes you and you say
[53:24] i know for a fact my god is a prayer
[53:26] answering god this is not as it were a
[53:29] theory in the word this is a reality
[53:32] that i know and somebody comes along oh
[53:34] that's that's gone no i'm telling you
[53:36] it's present right now whether you
[53:39] believe it or not i know it is a fact
[53:41] what is that doing it starts to bring a
[53:43] maturity into us and the next time we
[53:45] face a challenge
[53:47] we're not so hesitant
[53:52] and when god comes on the scene we're
[53:53] not so hesitant until it becomes the
[53:56] very forefront
[53:57] of our daily life
[53:59] is our first thought is go to the lord
[54:02] our first thought is to go in prayer our
[54:04] first thought is to go before the throne
[54:07] and there's a maturity that's coming my
[54:09] brother and sister
[54:11] now i hope i'm making sense tonight
[54:13] hallelujah i patched together a lot of
[54:15] thoughts and it wasn't because i didn't
[54:16] have thoughts it's because i had too
[54:18] many
[54:19] amen now look at this i want you to just
[54:22] grasp this in verse 5 he says
[54:24] who then is paul paul speaking about
[54:26] himself who then is paul and who is
[54:28] apollos but ministers by whom you
[54:30] believe now look i want to lay this out
[54:32] to you my brother and sister there's
[54:34] nothing wrong with having ministers that
[54:36] are prominent in your life i say lift a
[54:38] hand tonight and thank god for the
[54:40] ministers that moved you along in this
[54:43] in the word of god and helped you in
[54:45] times of need and trouble and praise god
[54:48] but look at this paul is telling us the
[54:51] apostle paul uh who is paul who is
[54:53] apollos but ministers
[54:56] whom he believed
[54:58] even
[54:58] as the lord gave
[55:00] to every man
[55:01] see not an exclusive right of one manner
[55:04] or one or two
[55:06] i have planted
[55:08] apollos watered
[55:10] but god gave the increase
[55:12] so then
[55:14] neither is he that planteth anything or
[55:15] he that watereth but god that giveth the
[55:17] increase and i want you to take this
[55:19] increase my brother and sister and i
[55:21] want you to apply it mentally if you
[55:23] would tonight in your thoughts of of
[55:25] increase of the building we're talking
[55:27] about building a house so as god is
[55:29] moving and he puts a seed of faith in
[55:32] you anyone got a seed of faith tonight
[55:34] amen and so it is there by the preaching
[55:36] of the word that that seed of faith is
[55:38] watered and it starts to bring an
[55:40] increase and this increase isn't bushels
[55:43] that we put in a greenery but this
[55:45] increase is the faith that god has given
[55:48] to us because without that faith you
[55:50] can't even believe the word
[55:52] you can't even apply the word to your
[55:54] life without that so god is bringing
[55:56] this and so we want to see no matter how
[55:59] small it is my brother and sister now i
[56:02] could just go kind of weird on you on
[56:04] some of these things maybe i just will
[56:05] for just a second if you don't mind amen
[56:08] when you're raising a wheat crop it is
[56:10] now july the wheat almost looks
[56:12] completely yellow but if you cut the
[56:15] stem open at the first or second node
[56:18] and if the pith
[56:20] is still soft
[56:22] that means it can take moisture
[56:24] to the head
[56:28] you can say i'm not going to waste the
[56:29] water and you don't irrigate it and you
[56:31] might have
[56:32] 55 pound wheat
[56:35] but if you take the effort
[56:38] to irrigate that
[56:41] as long
[56:42] as there's still life in this stock
[56:47] and you'll grow 60 plus pound wheat
[56:50] which
[56:51] as a farmer equates to money
[56:54] and some say
[56:56] i hope you're following me some say you
[56:58] know as a christian i'm just struggling
[57:00] all the time
[57:03] are you watering
[57:06] are you too lazy you want water
[57:09] what god has given you are you watering
[57:11] it let me tie it back to you in this
[57:13] sense the prophet of god showed us very
[57:15] clearly he says you will get out of
[57:17] church what you
[57:20] expect
[57:23] if you expect to go home blessed you're
[57:25] going to pour something out
[57:27] but if you expect it just be another
[57:28] night
[57:30] you'll hold back
[57:32] save it
[57:33] for when apollos
[57:35] is preaching
[57:42] come on i got brother pavel here is my
[57:44] ally two paul's together here we can't
[57:46] pick on paul
[57:47] amen
[57:48] now look at this he he tells him you
[57:50] know look you're gonna receive your own
[57:52] award according to your own labor see
[57:55] and i hear this all the time i'm not
[57:57] defending the preacher i'm not defending
[57:58] myself but you know i i'm just don't
[58:01] have a spiritual life because of the
[58:02] pastor
[58:04] come on the word says you're going to
[58:06] get rewarded for your labors
[58:08] amen you outwork the pastor you might
[58:10] get rewarded more than the pastor wow
[58:12] that's a novel idea isn't it
[58:15] but we have a quote where the prophet of
[58:16] god said you won't go no higher than
[58:18] your pastor
[58:20] good if i stall out on the ladder i
[58:22] expect you
[58:24] well i don't know if i should encourage
[58:25] you to poke me with a sharp stick
[58:28] but if i stall out on the ladder i want
[58:29] you to keep pushing me
[58:31] come on saints be with me
[58:33] amen don't just say well our pastor
[58:34] seems to be going through a hard time
[58:36] and we're just all
[58:38] no start pushing him
[58:40] come on pastor what's the problem
[58:43] we're going to pray for you in fact
[58:44] we're going to lay hands on you right
[58:45] now whether you like it or not
[58:48] because we want more we have greater
[58:49] expectation
[58:51] amen so now look at this the apostle
[58:54] paul is telling him you know it's
[58:55] according to the grace of god which was
[58:57] given unto me my he's such a bold
[58:58] speaker
[58:59] as a wise master builder i have laid the
[59:02] foundation
[59:03] and now i've turned it over
[59:06] for someone else to build on it
[59:09] do you know we can take and i would take
[59:11] me all night to tie all these loose ends
[59:13] for you we can take this and apply this
[59:16] directly
[59:17] because the prophet of god says you know
[59:19] what
[59:20] i preached
[59:22] what paul preached
[59:24] did he not
[59:25] he laid that as a foundational stone i
[59:29] preached what paul preached and now paul
[59:31] preached that i have laid the foundation
[59:34] and i've now left it for others
[59:37] to build upon
[59:40] oh come on think about it saints key
[59:42] ingredients
[59:44] we've got something to build upon
[59:47] you know this might sound
[59:49] kind of bad but
[59:51] if the lord rung you up tomorrow and
[59:53] said i give you the option to determine
[59:55] whether brother branham come back or not
[59:59] what would you take
[1:00:05] be pretty cool though
[1:00:07] hang out with the prophet
[1:00:10] hopefully you got call waiting because
[1:00:11] there's going to be 3 million phone
[1:00:13] calls in front of you
[1:00:16] can i tell you from my heart and i don't
[1:00:17] mean this as
[1:00:19] fleeting or
[1:00:21] if god said paul d you want the prophet
[1:00:23] to come back i would say no
[1:00:26] you know why
[1:00:27] the foundation's been laid
[1:00:30] we don't need to change anything i'm
[1:00:31] going to make a rapture you're going to
[1:00:32] make a rapture my brother and sister
[1:00:34] because the foundation has been laid and
[1:00:37] you have been anointed to build on that
[1:00:40] foundation not sit and wait for someone
[1:00:42] to come do it for you but to take the
[1:00:44] word of the hour and say you know what
[1:00:46] this goes here and this goes here and
[1:00:49] this piece fits in here and i need a
[1:00:52] window here and it's time church for us
[1:00:54] to turn a corner and we are anointed by
[1:00:57] the word of god to build the house
[1:01:05] now lest anybody
[1:01:07] especially our sister joy who doesn't
[1:01:09] have a clue what kind of crazy people
[1:01:11] she's visiting
[1:01:13] unless anyone misunderstand me my
[1:01:14] brother and sister
[1:01:16] i still in my heart would look to the
[1:01:18] day when we get to
[1:01:20] hug the neck shake the hand of our
[1:01:22] precious prophet
[1:01:24] but you see he gave me all the material
[1:01:29] god gave me all the material used a
[1:01:32] prophet to lay it out for me i've got
[1:01:34] the blueprint i've got the direction to
[1:01:37] build the house
[1:01:38] amen i'm not going to end up with it
[1:01:40] we're with an upside down and backwards
[1:01:41] house because i've been given a chance
[1:01:44] now look my brother and sister he says
[1:01:46] but let every man take heed how he
[1:01:47] buildeth there upon
[1:01:49] right we don't want to build a haphazard
[1:01:52] amen for
[1:01:54] noah for other foundation can no man lay
[1:01:57] than that which is laid which is jesus
[1:01:59] christ
[1:02:01] do you see what the apostle paul just
[1:02:03] did
[1:02:04] he switched from i've been anointed of
[1:02:06] god to lay this foundation from you for
[1:02:08] you
[1:02:10] and then he just totally cut himself out
[1:02:11] of the picture
[1:02:13] and said the foundation here now is
[1:02:14] christ
[1:02:16] so it's here it's time for you it's been
[1:02:18] provided he was preaching that same word
[1:02:21] that took him out of the scene and then
[1:02:24] put the whole focus on jesus christ
[1:02:26] aren't you glad today that we can take
[1:02:28] this what we believe right back into the
[1:02:31] word and realize why god did what he did
[1:02:33] in the time that he did it because i'm
[1:02:36] telling you and let me just i'll move on
[1:02:37] from this thought it's really my thought
[1:02:39] tonight but can you imagine if the
[1:02:40] prophet of god was still here
[1:02:42] for one it'd be very old but that's
[1:02:44] irrelevant to god
[1:02:46] did you realize in the day of cell
[1:02:48] phones and drones and this and that
[1:02:54] he'd be mowing his yard
[1:02:56] and turn around
[1:02:58] and his yard would be clear full of
[1:02:59] people
[1:03:01] and these are these are things these are
[1:03:03] the truth saints
[1:03:05] i've talked to brothers that were there
[1:03:07] and you know what some of them's
[1:03:08] questions would be
[1:03:11] not deep things
[1:03:12] of the mysteries of god
[1:03:15] some of them would be as simple as
[1:03:17] brother brown would it be wrong
[1:03:20] if i bought a red car
[1:03:26] you have your chance face to face with
[1:03:28] the prophet
[1:03:30] and somebody's told you it's evil if you
[1:03:32] drive a red car do you know if you drive
[1:03:33] a red car
[1:03:36] do anybody in the church drive
[1:03:38] a red car
[1:03:40] my husband yeah
[1:03:44] lord this husband thou hast given me
[1:03:49] you say brother paul you're joking but
[1:03:51] see i want you to catch
[1:03:53] the fallacy of this kind of idea
[1:03:56] it's not all about deep spiritual things
[1:03:59] people are caught up
[1:04:01] you know what should i do should i buy a
[1:04:03] house
[1:04:06] well i wouldn't buy a house and i
[1:04:08] wouldn't save any money and i wouldn't
[1:04:09] have any 401k i would put it in the
[1:04:11] offering plate an envelope that said for
[1:04:12] the pastor
[1:04:18] but what did the prophet of god say
[1:04:21] somebody tell me
[1:04:23] keep
[1:04:24] planting
[1:04:25] your
[1:04:26] potatoes
[1:04:29] that means every one of you ought to
[1:04:30] have a 401k or whatever it would suit
[1:04:33] your matter
[1:04:34] don't ask me i'm broke
[1:04:36] but
[1:04:37] you know
[1:04:38] so the prophet of god is laying this out
[1:04:40] see we can't cross the foundation the
[1:04:42] apostle paul laid which is
[1:04:44] jesus christ
[1:04:47] no matter what is spoken in our day we
[1:04:49] can't cross that foundation
[1:04:52] and you can declare i i don't encourage
[1:04:54] you to say it to their face or whatever
[1:04:56] but when you see people behaving
[1:04:57] otherwise you can look at them really
[1:04:59] and say you know what no it's not a
[1:05:01] problem brother sister you're just
[1:05:03] immature
[1:05:06] in the flesh you know how that would go
[1:05:08] over
[1:05:10] now look at this every man's work verse
[1:05:12] 13 shall be made manifest so we know the
[1:05:15] day is coming right for the day shall
[1:05:17] declare because it shall be revealed by
[1:05:20] fire and the fire shall try every man's
[1:05:23] work of what sort it is
[1:05:25] so there is there is the the ultimate
[1:05:29] test of this house that we are building
[1:05:33] is whether it will stand the fire my
[1:05:35] brother and sister and i want to just
[1:05:36] take this i'm not saying there's a
[1:05:38] direct correlation but i want to just
[1:05:39] take this over and the scripture talks
[1:05:41] about fiery trials and people are then
[1:05:44] saying well this fire that's going to
[1:05:46] test our work is is judgment time it's
[1:05:49] in the future no it isn't my brother and
[1:05:51] sister it's right here fiery trials it's
[1:05:53] right here the little things whether
[1:05:54] it's in our health or finances family
[1:05:57] relationships or whatever it might be
[1:05:59] not things that need to be done or
[1:06:01] reconciled or whatever it might be and
[1:06:03] it's there the fiery trials take place
[1:06:05] right here and you're seeing people
[1:06:07] singed
[1:06:09] people's relationship with the lord
[1:06:13] burning up
[1:06:15] because of something
[1:06:17] that's taking place right now
[1:06:19] now brother branham says right here in
[1:06:20] the seven church ages
[1:06:23] i've jumped quite a bit so i hope you
[1:06:25] don't mind because i just realized
[1:06:27] earlier i had way too much stuff
[1:06:29] now then here we're coming to a
[1:06:30] conclusion just ignore that one
[1:06:34] as the eternal logos god was manifest in
[1:06:36] the sun now i want you to dwell on this
[1:06:38] really i want you to focus please can i
[1:06:40] can you really really focus on this
[1:06:42] because this is deep
[1:06:44] amen
[1:06:45] as was manifested in the sun and in
[1:06:47] jesus dwelt all the fullness of the
[1:06:49] godhead bodily we can say amen right and
[1:06:51] that eternal one was the father manifest
[1:06:54] in flesh
[1:06:56] and thereby gain the title of son
[1:07:00] see that still baffles people even
[1:07:02] around the message when it comes to the
[1:07:03] godhead
[1:07:05] they still because of past teachings
[1:07:08] want to separate the son
[1:07:11] out from the father
[1:07:13] but look how brother branham so clearly
[1:07:15] puts this
[1:07:16] manifest in the flesh thereby gain the
[1:07:18] title of son
[1:07:20] oh
[1:07:21] can you grasp this those of you that
[1:07:23] read ahead
[1:07:24] amen
[1:07:25] even so we so what did he do the prophet
[1:07:28] of god says now look what i'm doing is i
[1:07:31] quit looking back in history right now
[1:07:34] and i'm going to put this right now so
[1:07:36] that you will realize i'm talking to you
[1:07:39] about that right now
[1:07:41] this is the time for you to focus on
[1:07:44] this not looking back here but right
[1:07:47] here right now
[1:07:49] amen
[1:07:50] so there he gained the title eternal so
[1:07:53] even so we
[1:07:54] eternal
[1:07:56] in his thoughts
[1:07:59] thank you lord
[1:08:00] whoa thank you lord eternal in his

[1:08:11] here i want to bring clarity in our turn
[1:08:14] now that word can be defined in several
[1:08:17] different avenues
[1:08:19] but it can also mean
[1:08:22] in our
[1:08:23] time
[1:08:26] right we can't go back and say you know
[1:08:28] what i really want to be a believer in
[1:08:29] the philadelphian age

[1:10:14] can someone say thank you lord
[1:10:17] and those
[1:10:19] i love this quote i just got so excited
[1:10:22] those eternal thoughts
[1:10:24] now manifest in the flesh
[1:10:27] you realize the way this is worded i
[1:10:29] believe the prophet's words are
[1:10:30] intentional
[1:10:33] those thoughts now manifest in flesh
[1:10:35] that puts it past tense saints that's
[1:10:37] right
[1:10:38] now not future
[1:10:40] now
[1:10:45] those eternal thoughts now manifest in
[1:10:47] the flesh are the sons
[1:10:50] of god
[1:10:52] even as we are so
[1:10:54] called
[1:10:56] that's who i am hallelujah that's who i
[1:10:59] am tonight amen that's what the word
[1:11:02] said i am and that's what the holy
[1:11:04] spirit moving right in our midst tonight
[1:11:06] is telling you and i what we are what
[1:11:09] are we we are the manifested sons of god
[1:11:14] we are the word coming out in flesh and
[1:11:18] it's not just a semblance my brother and
[1:11:20] sister it is the same word it is the
[1:11:23] same life it is not just some definitive
[1:11:26] uh example of the logos but it is the
[1:11:29] very life of jesus christ come right
[1:11:32] down from eternity
[1:11:35] now those of you that just can't help
[1:11:36] your self for reading ahead
[1:11:40] sometimes i like to just put blinders up
[1:11:42] here
[1:11:46] we did not become seed
[1:11:48] by the rebirth
[1:11:54] oh hallelujah
[1:11:57] it wasn't when i said lord forgive me of
[1:11:59] my sin
[1:12:00] and i repented and i went and got
[1:12:02] covered by the blood of jesus christ and
[1:12:05] it wasn't when i got baptized and it
[1:12:07] wasn't when i finally found a voice to
[1:12:09] raise in church to be able to praise my
[1:12:11] god my brother and sister it was not
[1:12:14] becoming seed by the rebirth we were
[1:12:16] seed and therefore were reborn for whole
[1:12:20] hallelujah only the elect can be reborn
[1:12:25] look what god has given us a very clean
[1:12:28] sign a very uh a clear vision
[1:12:33] excuse me i'm getting excited tonight
[1:12:34] i'm sorry
[1:12:37] hallelujah
[1:12:41] this if there's any argument of whether
[1:12:43] you
[1:12:44] became or always was
[1:12:47] there's the answer right there
[1:12:49] because we were seed
[1:12:52] is the reason
[1:12:54] we could be quickened
[1:12:57] you don't have revelation of the word my
[1:12:59] brother and sister because you got
[1:13:01] baptized
[1:13:02] you don't have revelation of the word
[1:13:04] because you receive the holy ghost see i
[1:13:06] hear it preach that way sometimes we
[1:13:08] receive the revelation of the word
[1:13:10] because we were always in the word we
[1:13:13] have always been the word and will
[1:13:16] always be the word
[1:13:18] and you say oh brother paul i i had uh
[1:13:21] i i had a quote not cut it out
[1:13:24] talking about stumbling it was you know
[1:13:30] that stone
[1:13:32] the chief corner
[1:13:35] and the unbeliever stumbled over it
[1:13:39] not once
[1:13:41] not twice
[1:13:42] they stumbled over it until they never
[1:13:44] went down that path ever again
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:48] but do you realize oh i'm getting so far
[1:13:50] off track do you realize that didn't
[1:13:52] mean they quit going to church
[1:13:54] it don't mean they quit reading their
[1:13:55] bible it doesn't mean they quit praying
[1:14:00] they quit
[1:14:01] approaching the throne amen
[1:14:04] and the prophet of god shows us so
[1:14:05] clearly how they now set up their own
[1:14:08] throne
[1:14:10] speaking
[1:14:11] of the beast
[1:14:13] what brother brown call it
[1:14:15] a form
[1:14:16] of denominational worship
[1:14:19] oh saints
[1:14:21] hold on to this liberty
[1:14:23] that christ has given you for you to be
[1:14:26] able to go down to your knees and go to
[1:14:28] the throne and say lord give me
[1:14:30] revelation of your word i want to see
[1:14:33] you
[1:14:34] you're my bridegroom you're my husband
[1:14:36] you're the one i love not a building not
[1:14:39] a name here
[1:14:42] not paul
[1:14:44] not apollos
[1:14:47] but christ
[1:14:49] oh hallelujah i want to just do you mind
[1:14:52] if i just read this all straight through
[1:14:54] i have kind of slaughtered it with my
[1:14:56] starts and stops now then here we are
[1:14:58] coming to a conclusion as the eternal
[1:15:00] logos god was manifest in the sun and in
[1:15:03] jesus dwelt all the fullness of the
[1:15:05] godhead bodily and that eternal one was
[1:15:08] the father manifest in flesh and thereby
[1:15:11] gain the title of son
[1:15:14] even so we oh hallelujah eternal in his
[1:15:17] thoughts in our turn our season became
[1:15:20] the many members spoken word seed
[1:15:23] manifest in flesh god didn't leave us in
[1:15:26] spirit form
[1:15:27] manifest in flesh and those eternal
[1:15:29] thoughts now manifest in the flesh are
[1:15:31] the sons of god even as we are so called
[1:15:35] we did not become seed by the rebirth we
[1:15:38] were seed and therefore we were reborn
[1:15:40] for only elect can be reborn because we
[1:15:43] were seed is the reason we could be
[1:15:46] quickened in non-seed there's nothing to
[1:15:49] quicken
[1:15:51] i tell you what if god's just stirring
[1:15:53] your heart the least bit you just hold
[1:15:54] on amen you just claim it hallelujah did
[1:15:57] you love that
[1:15:58] i'm telling you that's just some
[1:16:00] beautiful scriptures amen manifested out
[1:16:03] through the message right there amen
[1:16:13] oh my
[1:16:17] i'm so tired i could sit down in this
[1:16:19] chair right here
[1:16:20] and go to sleep right now
[1:16:22] and i'm so excited i think i could run
[1:16:24] laps around this sanctuary for the next
[1:16:26] 30 or 40 minutes
[1:16:28] hallelujah there's just something in my
[1:16:31] soul
[1:16:32] amen that just has me so excited to see
[1:16:36] the word open up to us and it's telling
[1:16:38] you oh if i could put it this way go
[1:16:41] jolly go
[1:16:43] amen you can make the goal keep going
[1:16:46] johnny
[1:16:48] hallelujah
[1:16:52] hallelujah
[1:16:53] now hebrews 3 1
[1:16:56] wherefore
[1:16:57] holy brethren partakers of the heavenly
[1:16:59] calling did we not just read some of
[1:17:01] this calling
[1:17:03] consider the apostle and high priest of
[1:17:05] our profession christ jesus who is
[1:17:07] faithful to him that appointed him right
[1:17:10] so what is this here
[1:17:12] go back to what the prophet said
[1:17:16] he
[1:17:17] got to take the position of son
[1:17:21] by stepping
[1:17:23] into the flesh amen
[1:17:32] can i ask you a question tonight
[1:17:35] you promise
[1:17:36] to answer
[1:17:39] would you rather
[1:17:41] see jesus
[1:17:43] christ tonight
[1:17:46] has god stepped into
[1:17:48] his flesh
[1:17:51] or would you rather
[1:17:53] see jesus christ tonight
[1:17:56] stepped into your flesh
[1:18:02] many people saw him
[1:18:04] in the flesh of jesus christ
[1:18:07] and it did not one thing for them
[1:18:10] but i can assure you tonight's saints
[1:18:12] when we see christ stepped into this
[1:18:15] flesh
[1:18:16] we will never ever ever be the same
[1:18:21] we can't see and experience that and
[1:18:24] walk away from that people say i
[1:18:25] followed the message for 30 years and
[1:18:27] realized i'd been deceived
[1:18:29] no you didn't follow the message for 30
[1:18:31] years because if you ever step into that
[1:18:34] position of seeing jesus christ stepped
[1:18:38] into or god let me put it not you into
[1:18:40] your flesh
[1:18:42] there is absolutely no way you can turn
[1:18:45] around and say i was deceived i'm
[1:18:48] walking away from this my brother and
[1:18:50] sister it's one thing to see an event
[1:18:53] take place it's another to be a part of
[1:18:56] what is taking place
[1:18:58] oh hallelujah
[1:19:01] he was faithful
[1:19:02] to him that appointed him as also moses
[1:19:04] was faithful in all his house for this
[1:19:07] man was counted worthy of more glory
[1:19:09] than moses and so much as he hath
[1:19:11] builded the house has more honor than
[1:19:14] the house
[1:19:15] for every house is builded by some man
[1:19:18] that he that built all things is god
[1:19:22] hallelujah
[1:19:23] look at this my brother and sister you
[1:19:25] say i thank the lord i study i study my
[1:19:28] bible i pray
[1:19:30] and and
[1:19:31] revelations coming
[1:19:33] yes sir what did the prophet say don't
[1:19:36] say i have the holy ghost
[1:19:39] come on i'm going to turn the words here
[1:19:41] i can't defend them but i hope you
[1:19:42] understand the spirit prophet of god
[1:19:44] said don't say i have the holy ghost
[1:19:47] say the holy ghost
[1:19:49] has me
[1:19:51] now i want to throw this at you okay and
[1:19:53] if i if i am uh wrong
[1:19:56] feel free to correct me
[1:19:57] i believe tonight we could make this
[1:19:59] statement
[1:20:01] i do not have revelation
[1:20:04] revelation
[1:20:06] has me
[1:20:07] hallelujah what could i ever ever in
[1:20:11] this mind
[1:20:12] hallelujah you know i want to encourage
[1:20:14] you guys i always speak down on myself
[1:20:16] going through some old stuff and found a
[1:20:18] a school i don't know what they call it
[1:20:20] now but you know
[1:20:22] test they they tested me
[1:20:25] yes sir i want you to know
[1:20:28] i am 51 proficient in english
[1:20:34] hallelujah
[1:20:36] thank you lord
[1:20:37] amen i was not a complete failure
[1:20:41] i was 51 percent proficient
[1:20:44] but i tell you god will lead you by your
[1:20:46] own skills
[1:20:48] and i maxed it out on mechanical ability
[1:20:51] praise the lord so if you need me to
[1:20:53] build a new pulpit call me
[1:20:56] you need me to articulate anything in
[1:20:58] english and and put the proper grammar
[1:21:00] um i don't know call one of these other
[1:21:02] sisters or
[1:21:06] but you see
[1:21:07] i'm so thankful tonight
[1:21:10] i don't have revelation
[1:21:14] god said
[1:21:16] that's my seed
[1:21:18] he's identified in my thoughts he's
[1:21:21] identified in eternity and i promise i
[1:21:24] would never leave him nor forsake him i
[1:21:28] promised i would lead him oh hallelujah
[1:21:32] i would lead him into all truth and so
[1:21:35] it don't matter what my english
[1:21:36] proficiency is the revelation has come
[1:21:40] down and taken the halts of you and
[1:21:42] taken the holds of me that we can walk
[1:21:44] through this life and the world says but
[1:21:46] the greek says i don't care what the
[1:21:48] greek says i want what the spirit said
[1:21:51] hallelujah
[1:21:53] how do we know that that greek wasn't
[1:21:55] just another intellectual man that god
[1:21:57] was hiding it from
[1:21:58] hallelujah
[1:22:00] look at this now
[1:22:02] as the man who builded the house hath
[1:22:04] more honor than the house
[1:22:11] you know we as humans need a little
[1:22:12] pride right
[1:22:16] we often just eliminate pride out of our
[1:22:19] vocabulary because it's like well you
[1:22:21] know we're christians we don't have any
[1:22:22] pride
[1:22:24] you realize if you didn't have some
[1:22:26] pride
[1:22:27] i'd be looking at people tonight in
[1:22:28] church and filthy clothes
[1:22:31] with food on your face
[1:22:35] come on
[1:22:36] kind of a rude way to put it isn't it
[1:22:43] now i'll leave that one alone
[1:22:47] but you see
[1:22:49] that same kind of pride in the right
[1:22:51] context
[1:22:53] is what causes you to recognize
[1:22:56] i want to be all the word said
[1:22:59] yes sir are you with me
[1:23:01] no no don't take okay i might have
[1:23:03] missed the actual
[1:23:04] intellectual point of that but don't
[1:23:07] don't take that wrong
[1:23:09] we don't believe because we're proud
[1:23:12] but because revelation has us
[1:23:14] there's something in us that says you
[1:23:16] know what
[1:23:18] children before you go to the table
[1:23:21] wash your hands wash your face
[1:23:24] leave your muddy boots at the door
[1:23:27] our house is not a pig pen
[1:23:30] what is that
[1:23:31] that's the same
[1:23:33] from the carnal and to the spiritual
[1:23:35] that causes you to come to the house of
[1:23:37] god and say lord i'm hungry tonight
[1:23:40] i've washed myself
[1:23:42] i've presented myself now lord
[1:23:45] i'm here to feed on the word i'm here to
[1:23:49] take this word and fill my plate amen
[1:23:53] and i'm going to eat it and then what
[1:23:55] happens amen you know i was going
[1:23:58] through my phone erasing a lot of
[1:24:00] pictures you know i don't know if you
[1:24:01] ever do that you you take a picture of
[1:24:03] something and the first one don't seem
[1:24:04] good you take another one and next thing
[1:24:06] you know it was on something like burst
[1:24:08] and you have 23 pictures of the same
[1:24:10] thing
[1:24:11] and i was just cleaning up some stuff
[1:24:13] out of my phone and
[1:24:16] my
[1:24:18] sister sharon i come across the picture
[1:24:19] when you were baptized
[1:24:26] little girl it's not real big now
[1:24:28] but little girl
[1:24:31] i'll come across all these pictures of
[1:24:32] different kids i have a had a i have a
[1:24:35] picture in my phone of the graham family
[1:24:41] titus was how big
[1:24:42] sister sarah
[1:24:50] just a little guy
[1:24:54] what are we doing church
[1:24:56] we're coming
[1:24:57] to maturity
[1:25:00] the rapture will come when we are ready
[1:25:04] to take the rapture
[1:25:06] let's not go build another house
[1:25:09] you know i mentioned in service the
[1:25:11] other day about these people are like oh
[1:25:12] you know the millennium's over and now
[1:25:15] we can just do whatever we want
[1:25:17] wrong house
[1:25:20] come on
[1:25:23] they took the foundation that paul laid
[1:25:26] and they started building this way in
[1:25:28] that way
[1:25:30] and they said you know what
[1:25:32] i don't have enough
[1:25:34] tuba force to build this room
[1:25:37] so i'm just gonna build the rafters four
[1:25:39] feet apart
[1:25:40] and i'm gonna put the studs four feet
[1:25:42] apart and i'm just gonna nail it it'll
[1:25:44] be all right
[1:25:47] it doesn't stand the test of time saints
[1:25:49] we have a firm foundation and the master
[1:25:52] builder
[1:25:53] is worth
[1:25:55] all that we can give him
[1:25:58] he is our all he is worthy of this honor
[1:26:03] of this glory amen that we can stand
[1:26:07] upon this now let me just move along
[1:26:08] right here real quick amen
[1:26:11] it's pretty cool my brother and sister
[1:26:13] in this context of the scripture to be
[1:26:15] identified as the one that built the
[1:26:16] house right as much as he had builded
[1:26:19] the house has more honor than the house
[1:26:21] but we have as it is you and i control
[1:26:24] how this house is built
[1:26:27] isn't that right you say well paul i
[1:26:29] don't know yeah
[1:26:31] the prophet of god said the holy spirit
[1:26:33] goes
[1:26:34] where he's invited
[1:26:37] you want to build a strong house
[1:26:39] keep an invitation out
[1:26:42] amen
[1:26:43] keep an invitation out you want to build
[1:26:45] a strong house every house is builded by
[1:26:47] some man so we get to be identified as
[1:26:49] one building the house and that is as it
[1:26:52] is our testimony our life my brother and
[1:26:55] sister but i tell you what it's one
[1:26:57] thing to be identified as the one
[1:26:58] building the house it's another to be
[1:27:00] identified by the one
[1:27:03] who built the house
[1:27:04] hallelujah it's one thing to say i'm a
[1:27:06] christian i've been serving the lord
[1:27:08] this is good how about when god
[1:27:10] testifies through you
[1:27:12] when god testifies this is my house
[1:27:15] might be a teenage girl it's my house
[1:27:17] might be an old man my house might be
[1:27:20] whatever my house
[1:27:22] god identifying himself as i read it i
[1:27:24] don't want to go back and and go back to
[1:27:26] it but it's there as it's manifested
[1:27:30] in this turn
[1:27:33] oh hallelujah can we give just a little
[1:27:35] praise to the lord because he chose to
[1:27:37] manifest himself in us
[1:27:40] hallelujah god's decision
[1:27:42] god's decision not our decision amen
[1:27:45] hallelujah i want to move real quick
[1:27:47] here
[1:27:48] first peter 2 5 love this scripture

[1:28:23] the aisles

[1:29:22] also
[1:29:24] as a lively stone
[1:29:27] are built up
[1:29:28] do you realize this is a present tense
[1:29:31] statement
[1:29:35] you could say it's a past tense also but
[1:29:38] you can
[1:29:39] in my very much mangled english
[1:29:43] defend
[1:29:44] all the things you know you guys know
[1:29:46] and adjectives and prepositions and you
[1:29:49] know that kind of stuff
[1:29:59] he also as lively stones are built up a
[1:30:04] spiritual
[1:30:05] house
[1:30:07] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:30:10] sacrifices accepted
[1:30:13] to god acceptable to god
[1:30:15] by jesus christ
[1:30:17] what did he do he stepped down in that
[1:30:19] form as we just read to accept
[1:30:23] our praise
[1:30:24] as an element as the scriptures see
[1:30:28] that you shell out five hundred thousand
[1:30:30] dollars to have a house bill
[1:30:33] and you go there
[1:30:36] and it's not your house
[1:30:40] i wanted a window here brother brian
[1:30:43] talks about this and the message things
[1:30:45] i want this like this now i decided it's
[1:30:47] better if it's this way
[1:30:50] saints i'll just close sister ruth
[1:30:53] this is god's house
[1:30:56] let's build it
[1:30:57] the way god wants it built
[1:31:00] let's build it under the moving of the
[1:31:02] holy spirit
[1:31:04] you know i i'll just be honest with you
[1:31:06] i don't know any of you suffer from this
[1:31:07] but some of us think we can fix things
[1:31:11] some of us think you know there's an
[1:31:12] issue
[1:31:13] i can fix this
[1:31:14] i'm pretty good with that
[1:31:17] it's probably not a good trait for a
[1:31:18] pastor
[1:31:20] because sometimes i just like
[1:31:24] look i remember now i've got to pray
[1:31:26] about that i can't can't go over there
[1:31:29] do this this and this it'll all work out
[1:31:32] no
[1:31:33] we've got to let god move
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:36] i want this house i want my house i want
[1:31:38] your house
[1:31:39] to be the house that god built
[1:31:41] i want it to be the house that the lord
[1:31:43] looks down and says that's my child
[1:31:46] and i pour my revelation into them i
[1:31:50] pour my spirit
[1:31:52] into them
[1:31:53] hallelujah
[1:31:54] i could preach those other three or four
[1:31:57] pages from memory but we'll just stop
[1:32:00] hallelujah also as lively stones
[1:32:03] are built up a spiritual house
[1:32:05] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:32:07] sacrifices acceptable to god
[1:32:12] no word saints i'm going to take you
[1:32:14] back to our quotes earlier
[1:32:16] no word
[1:32:18] declaring that i called you
[1:32:21] i anointed you
[1:32:23] i manifested you and then i will look
[1:32:25] you in the face and depart from me
[1:32:28] no way you can put those together
[1:32:30] you are either in him
[1:32:32] or you never was
[1:32:35] that simple when the devil starts
[1:32:37] chattering at you just remind him i'm
[1:32:39] either in him
[1:32:41] or i never was but this heart is crying
[1:32:44] out saying lord i love you lord i want
[1:32:46] to serve you lord lead me guide me lord
[1:32:49] i need you
[1:32:51] hallelujah let the devil get down where
