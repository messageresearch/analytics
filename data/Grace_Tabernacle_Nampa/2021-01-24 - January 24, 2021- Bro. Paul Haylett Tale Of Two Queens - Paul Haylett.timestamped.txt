[29:29] why don't you come brother
[29:31] take these knees to our
[29:38] [Music]
[29:39] god lord you this morning i had
[29:42] something on my heart that little
[29:43] portion of a quote if it's all right i
[29:46] said lord if you want me to bring this
[29:48] you haven't called me
[29:49] [Music]
[29:50] and i just i thought well lord it's all
[29:54] in your hands
[29:55] it's taken out of the unveiling of god
[29:59] paragraph 21 he said may the lord had
[30:01] his blessings to the reading of his word
[30:03] he just read the scriptures
[30:06] now my subject this morning i trust that
[30:08] god will reveal this
[30:10] how many thankful for revelation i
[30:13] cannot
[30:13] be thankful enough for the revelation of
[30:16] the word given
[30:18] by his grace to us and each time
[30:22] i trust that god will reveal this and
[30:24] each time if you
[30:25] take the tapes and listen and hope and
[30:29] trust that you have had a spiritual
[30:31] understanding of what god has been
[30:34] trying to get over to
[30:36] the church without saying it right out
[30:38] yes
[30:41] see it's a thing sometime we have to say
[30:44] things in such a way that it might
[30:46] thin down it might bring some to go out
[30:50] some to leave some to ponder over
[30:54] but that's done purposely
[30:57] it must be done that way
[30:59] [Music]
[31:01] then it might be that some would say you
[31:03] mean god would purposely do a thing like
[31:06] that
[31:06] he certainly did he does yet
[31:14] i'm moving on down you read between you
[31:16] read afterwards i
[31:17] like to read the whole quotes for
[31:19] several here but
[31:22] he said a little further down he said
[31:24] you can't explain
[31:25] faith it's something that you believe
[31:31] and it's so solid that there's nothing
[31:33] else will take its place
[31:35] hallelujah thank the lord amen let's bow
[31:39] our heads for a word of prayer
[31:41] our heavenly father we bow reverently in

[43:43] amen you know
[43:47] if we didn't have a place to let off the
[43:49] pressure
[43:51] you know you look out in the world and
[43:53] you see people
[43:54] they hardly even acknowledge god and the
[43:57] very nature that they have
[44:00] they just simply take the cares of their
[44:02] life and cast them over their shoulder
[44:04] and go on part of that you say man
[44:07] they're fortunate but you see part of it
[44:09] is they don't realize they have an
[44:10] accountant coming
[44:12] and we as believers you know the whole
[44:14] terminology they have in the world today
[44:16] these people are woken
[44:19] well i'll tell you isn't it amazing how
[44:21] satan comes and he
[44:23] impersonates that because there's no
[44:25] greater awakening
[44:28] than a man or woman being awoken to the
[44:31] fact they're sons and daughters of god
[44:34] and so satan come along and grab that
[44:36] terminology and
[44:38] placed it on a thought where people feel
[44:41] like oh yes
[44:42] we're so culturally or whatever it might
[44:45] be
[44:46] uh woken but i'm telling you my brother
[44:49] and sister
[44:50] there's no awakening that they can have
[44:53] unless it's in jesus christ that can
[44:55] even come
[44:55] close to what god has done for you and i
[44:58] amen
[44:58] it's just such a beautiful beautiful
[45:01] thing and
[45:02] you know this morning i'm very happy in
[45:04] my heart

[45:18] lovely thing

[47:24] insight i
[47:25] actually mentioned something to brother
[47:27] george
[47:28] of something of a recent conversation
[47:31] and
[47:31] it's interesting saints because those
[47:34] people who
[47:35] were there brother george being a part
[47:38] of that household
[47:39] sitting at the table riding in the car
[47:42] hearing conversations being parts of
[47:44] conversation
[47:45] and i mentioned this a little thought to
[47:48] brother george and he says brother paul
[47:49] that's not the way
[47:51] everyone takes it he took me back in
[47:53] history
[47:54] as it were laid the whole foundation of
[47:56] what was happening
[47:57] carried it right on through give me a
[47:59] whole different perspective
[48:01] of of what we're looking at so it's nice
[48:05] and
[48:05] and it's always good i'm happy myself to
[48:09] be able to count brother george as a
[48:11] friend
[48:12] so uh be praying for this services and
[48:15] uh so saturday evening february
[48:17] 6 7 p.m questions and answers so please
[48:21] turn them in
[48:22] and then we'll have a regular sunday
[48:24] service
[48:25] and then brother george will be
[48:27] unfortunately not able to stay very long
[48:29] to be going
[48:30] home so amen let's uh just uh
[48:34] stand and go into the word i want to
[48:37] speak to you once again on the overall
[48:38] thought of redemption's manifestation
[48:41] uh i want to talk to you this will be a
[48:44] multi-part
[48:44] uh uh part here uh the tale of two
[48:48] queens
[48:50] uh is not something that we can preach
[48:53] in one
[48:53] service and do it justice uh
[48:56] so what we're going to do is come and
[48:59] and uh
[49:00] it would be very familiar to you uh we
[49:03] just want to
[49:04] touch but you see my brother and sister
[49:06] in studying
[49:08] uh the message uh you you
[49:11] you always have a foundation of
[49:12] scripture you study the message
[49:15] you realize that when they say history
[49:18] repeats itself that is a true statement
[49:22] because we
[49:23] get to see now by god's grace brother
[49:26] david said revelation
[49:27] allows us to look in the word and
[49:29] realize the very spirits that were
[49:31] moving at a certain time and place
[49:34] have come back on the scene again and
[49:38] that is good because the holy ghost fell
[49:40] on the day of pentecost and he's falling
[49:42] here with us
[49:43] in our pentecost amen and we see the
[49:46] power of god
[49:47] moving stirring people amen
[49:50] answering questions prophet of god said
[49:54] if there's a biblical question there is
[49:56] a biblical answer
[49:57] amen so we don't have to assume and we
[50:00] don't have to
[50:01] to give up we can just wait upon the
[50:04] lord
[50:05] let's turn in the book of esther and
[50:08] like i said this will be
[50:09] very familiar speaking
[50:12] of vashti and um
[50:16] you know i want you to remember now in
[50:18] our in our
[50:19] graph that we have or the basis we're
[50:22] looking at
[50:23] near never never never not nearly as
[50:26] exciting to
[50:27] talk about the negative side of it it is
[50:30] talk about the bride of christ
[50:32] right to talk about revelation in the
[50:34] opening of the word
[50:35] overcoming power rapturing faith all of
[50:38] these things my brother and sister
[50:40] are are the very uh cream you might say
[50:42] to a son or daughter of god
[50:45] but yet we always want to lay a good
[50:47] solid foundation
[50:48] and um you know sometimes we we realize
[50:51] little things may be lacking uh and uh
[50:54] the foundation points that we need to
[50:56] make and god help us
[50:58] that we build a complete foundation
[51:00] under the word not just our pet topics
[51:03] and so let's just start here now
[51:06] the first ten verses are laying the
[51:09] foundation here of
[51:11] of what is coming to pass uh
[51:14] uh and how this come to pass that vashti
[51:17] would find herself in this position
[51:19] we'll start with verse 11.
[51:21] to bring vashti the queen before the
[51:23] king with the crown royal
[51:24] to show the people and the princes her
[51:27] beauty
[51:29] for she was fair to look on but the
[51:32] queen vashti refused to come at the
[51:34] king's commandment by his
[51:35] chamberlains therefore was the king very
[51:38] roth and his anger burned in him
[51:40] then the king said to the wise men which
[51:43] knew
[51:44] the times
[51:48] interesting insertion
[51:51] in this scripture they knew
[51:55] the times for so was the king's manner
[51:58] towards all that new
[52:00] law and judgment and the next unto him
[52:03] now i'm going to just totally slaughter
[52:05] these words i i even looked at some of
[52:07] them and their pronunciation and
[52:09] and three minutes later i couldn't
[52:12] articulate it and next to him was
[52:15] karcencha
[52:24] the seven princes of persia and media
[52:26] which saw
[52:28] the king's face which sat the first
[52:31] in the kingdom what shall we do into the
[52:34] queen vashti according to the law
[52:36] because she hath not performed the
[52:38] commandment of the king a hazardous
[52:41] by the chamberlains mimikin answered
[52:45] before the king
[52:46] and the princes vashti the queen hath
[52:48] not done wrong
[52:50] to the king only now saints i'm going to
[52:53] ask you today
[52:54] you got to look beyond the surface of
[52:57] this story
[53:00] she's not done wrong to the king only
[53:02] but also to all the princes and to all
[53:04] the people
[53:06] that are in all the provinces of the
[53:08] king hazarus
[53:10] for this deed of the queen shall come
[53:12] abroad unto all women
[53:14] now let's not forget sisters the
[53:17] representation of the church
[53:20] as a woman yes sir
[53:23] for the deed of this queen shall come
[53:25] abroad into all women so that they
[53:28] shall despise their husband in their
[53:30] eyes
[53:31] when it shall be reported the king
[53:34] hazardous commanded vashti the queen to
[53:36] be brought in before him but she came
[53:38] not
[53:38] likewise shall the ladies of persia and
[53:41] media say this day until all the king's
[53:43] princes
[53:44] which have heard the deed of the queen
[53:46] thus shall there
[53:47] arise too much contempt and wrath
[53:52] if it please the king let there go a
[53:54] royal commandment from him
[53:56] and let it be written among the laws of
[53:58] the persians and the medes
[54:00] and that it not be altered that vasti
[54:02] come no more before the king
[54:04] a hazardous and let the king give her
[54:07] royal estate unto another
[54:09] that is better than she
[54:15] and when the king's decree which he
[54:17] shall make shall be published throughout
[54:19] all his empire for it is great and truly
[54:23] it is great all the wives shall give
[54:26] their husbands honor
[54:29] both to great and small and the saying
[54:32] pleased the king and the princes and the
[54:34] king did according to the word
[54:36] of mimikan for he sent letters into all
[54:38] the king's provinces
[54:40] and to every province according to the
[54:42] writing thereof and to every
[54:44] people after their language and every
[54:45] man should bear rule
[54:48] in his own house
[54:51] and that it should be published
[54:52] according to the language
[54:54] of every people amen the word of god
[54:57] says that this
[54:59] bible this word which is
[55:02] the written words of god
[55:06] must go to every nation kindred
[55:09] and tongue heavenly father we ask you
[55:12] today lord just help me articulate these
[55:15] thoughts lord that i
[55:17] been studying and trying to
[55:20] understand lord to have a correct view
[55:23] of a correct vision of
[55:25] we ask father that you would just move
[55:27] in our midst today
[55:28] guide us lord let us speak only
[55:30] according to thy word
[55:32] in the name of jesus christ amen you may
[55:35] be seated
[55:39] so as we would look at this story my
[55:41] brother and sister
[55:43] i just felt a great
[55:47] connection as it were and reached out to
[55:50] me
[55:51] that we would be looking in not those
[55:54] days
[55:56] so long ago but we would be looking into
[55:59] the season that we live in now and
[56:03] how that we would uh be able
[56:07] to take and and
[56:11] grasp the spirits amen as it is you know
[56:15] we recognize that spirits come and go as
[56:18] it were but they don't die
[56:20] so you'll see a spirit in an age but
[56:22] it'll appear once again
[56:24] and if we remember my brother and sister
[56:26] at this time that we are living in
[56:28] is the evidence of the pale horse rider
[56:31] which was a mixture of
[56:33] all of those deceptive spirits of the
[56:35] ages
[56:36] that had come into our time and and
[56:39] they're all mixed together
[56:40] and it's not darkness it's not absolute
[56:44] evil that on its appearance it's not
[56:47] good it's just this mixture and people
[56:50] then because of the spirits of the age
[56:52] are comfortable
[56:54] because the scripture says that they
[56:55] would have the very appearance
[57:00] of godliness but they would so deny the
[57:04] power
[57:06] so appearances are good in the business
[57:08] world i like to read and
[57:10] i like to do that and they tell you that
[57:12] you have just a small fleeting
[57:14] opportunity
[57:15] to impress someone your appearance and
[57:18] how you present yourself how you
[57:19] articulate yourself gives you just a
[57:21] moment
[57:22] to leave the impression with that person
[57:25] but my brother and sister
[57:26] impressions are not nearly as important
[57:29] as the character behind the individual
[57:32] a nice suit an articulate language
[57:35] a polite behavior all of these things
[57:38] can leave an image but it does not
[57:40] necessarily mean that the person
[57:42] is what that image represents and so as
[57:45] we look at this i want to just go
[57:48] through here kind of uh steady as we
[57:50] would go
[57:51] today i still want to come back to verse
[57:54] 13
[57:55] and we recognize the king said to the
[57:57] wise men
[57:58] which knew the times my brother and
[58:00] sister i tell you
[58:01] it is a wise man or woman in the day
[58:03] that we live in
[58:05] that knows the times that we are living
[58:07] in
[58:08] amen if we miss the sign of the time
[58:11] then we can look my brother and sister
[58:13] at the word of god we can read it as a
[58:16] historical factor
[58:17] we can take all of these things but when
[58:20] by revelation we recognize
[58:23] that it is here and i'm going to just
[58:24] throw this little nugget out
[58:26] because it will come in the next service
[58:28] or two concerning uh
[58:29] the tale of two queens but you see
[58:32] esther
[58:32] comes in this same season in the same
[58:35] circumstances of
[58:36] of a life and uh she is reminded
[58:40] by mordecai that it is for a time
[58:43] such as this and i want to remind you as
[58:47] the bride of christ that it is for a
[58:50] time
[58:50] such as this that you are come
[58:54] amen god wanted you in another age
[58:56] that's where you would have been
[58:58] but it is in this day this age these
[59:01] circumstances
[59:02] these temptations and this overcoming
[59:06] power of the holy ghost
[59:08] that is a season god chose for you and i
[59:11] amen we should not stop and say well i
[59:13] hope or i would
[59:15] try to i'll try to be the overcomer i'll
[59:18] no no declare what god thought of you
[59:21] declare what god's plan was for you
[59:24] i am the overcomer i am the one
[59:27] chosen for this day and that reminds me
[59:29] we did not lift them up
[59:31] brother chris and sister christian and
[59:32] the family off
[59:34] spending a few short days together
[59:37] in a little holiday i want to remember
[59:39] them in prayer
[59:40] amen so you look at this and realize
[59:43] that it's a wise man that knows the
[59:45] times and
[59:46] so we see how this action took place
[59:50] we see what what is coming and and how
[59:52] that there
[59:53] is a reaction to this action
[59:56] now i can assure you my brother and
[59:58] sister that avashti
[1:00:00] response was not something that just
[1:00:02] popped up it was not some sudden
[1:00:05] act of rebellion but it is something
[1:00:07] that had started to raise up into her
[1:00:10] now look at vashti herself she had been
[1:00:13] raised to the very
[1:00:14] pinnacle amen now the pinnacle for her
[1:00:17] was queen
[1:00:19] amen and she had been raised to the very
[1:00:21] pinnacle she's the queen of the kingdom
[1:00:23] she's got every benefit and every
[1:00:25] blessing of her position
[1:00:27] now i just want to remind you not to go
[1:00:29] into this but it's just come upon my
[1:00:30] mind
[1:00:31] to remind you that the prophet of god
[1:00:33] says that you and i
[1:00:34] are living below
[1:00:40] come on queen amen
[1:00:43] let's accept all that god has given to
[1:00:47] us
[1:00:47] in our position amen
[1:00:50] we should possess all that is in there
[1:00:53] now look at this see she had
[1:00:55] every benefit and every blessing of her
[1:00:57] position
[1:00:58] she had authority my brother and sister
[1:01:01] to
[1:01:01] call and to send and desire something
[1:01:04] no doubt the finest of clothes and
[1:01:06] whatever might have been
[1:01:08] uh that she would have desired the
[1:01:10] finest of food
[1:01:12] and to elevate her friends as it were
[1:01:15] around her
[1:01:16] but the problem vashti had was she
[1:01:19] forgot
[1:01:20] how she got there vashti did not become
[1:01:23] the queen
[1:01:24] upon her own merit she had become
[1:01:27] the queen upon the king's favor
[1:01:31] and when she come to the place that she
[1:01:33] no longer
[1:01:34] cared about the quality and merit of the
[1:01:37] king's
[1:01:38] favor she felt that she had rose up to a
[1:01:41] place
[1:01:42] that she in herself was self-sufficient
[1:01:47] now i want you to understand and we'll
[1:01:49] hit on this in in
[1:01:51] in future services here but my brother
[1:01:53] and sister the prophet of god
[1:01:55] in through the seals you'll find it in
[1:01:57] the seals you will find it in the church
[1:01:59] ages
[1:02:00] you'll find where god is dealing with
[1:02:02] the fact that there is on the earth
[1:02:04] today
[1:02:06] one who calls herself queen she's vocal
[1:02:09] about this she says that she
[1:02:11] is the queen of heaven but then the
[1:02:13] prophet of god
[1:02:14] comes and this is actually what brought
[1:02:16] me into this story
[1:02:18] of the tale of two queens is there is
[1:02:21] one
[1:02:21] there my brother and sister that is
[1:02:23] vocal she has told the world
[1:02:25] of her delicacies of the things that
[1:02:28] she's partaking in
[1:02:29] but she forgot how she got there and so
[1:02:32] now
[1:02:33] she believes she is self-sufficient she
[1:02:36] believes that she has the authority
[1:02:38] and she has the position to do anything
[1:02:41] she pleases
[1:02:42] but we see now that vashti forgetting
[1:02:44] how she got there
[1:02:46] she forgot who had placed her in that
[1:02:49] position
[1:02:50] and i've spoken on this in the church
[1:02:52] and no doubt will again at some point in
[1:02:54] time
[1:02:55] but we must remember my brother and
[1:02:57] sister the difference of these
[1:02:59] relationships
[1:03:00] is so obvious or so apparent it was
[1:03:03] that vashti didn't even want to come
[1:03:06] when
[1:03:07] called but we will look at the life of
[1:03:10] esther
[1:03:10] and when esther saw a need when esther
[1:03:13] saw something she desired
[1:03:15] she went what a difference one had to be
[1:03:18] called
[1:03:19] and one had a desire to come to the
[1:03:21] presence
[1:03:22] amen what a difference my brother and
[1:03:24] sister that makes and
[1:03:26] people can say well we are christians
[1:03:28] and if god wants something from me
[1:03:30] then you know he can let me know i've
[1:03:32] heard people make statements like that
[1:03:34] but i'll tell you i believe this bride
[1:03:36] of christ in this last age
[1:03:38] is there saying you know what my lord my
[1:03:40] king what can i do for you
[1:03:43] how can i serve you what can what can i
[1:03:46] do that would bring
[1:03:47] pleasure to you she's not there living
[1:03:50] by a book of rules that says on this day
[1:03:53] this time this place this way
[1:03:55] i have to do something but she has a
[1:03:57] heart's desire
[1:03:59] to want to be in the presence of that
[1:04:02] king
[1:04:02] and if i'm not careful i'll preach
[1:04:04] myself uh too far ahead here
[1:04:06] uh meaning as in next week or week after
[1:04:10] so you see by the reason of her position
[1:04:14] she was brought up into this position
[1:04:17] where she was as it were the first lady
[1:04:20] of the nation and it's there that i find
[1:04:23] interesting and i want to throw out to
[1:04:25] you
[1:04:26] that it is because she was
[1:04:30] beautiful now we'll see
[1:04:34] actually a metamorphosis or transition
[1:04:37] in this story of the nature of the whole
[1:04:40] picture but you see the king says
[1:04:44] i want to show you guys
[1:04:47] how beautiful my wife is
[1:04:51] lest it would trouble some of you i
[1:04:52] won't go into a great extent
[1:04:54] of my imagination of the beauty
[1:05:00] of vashti she must have had
[1:05:04] hair that was not comparable anywhere in
[1:05:07] the kingdom
[1:05:09] she must have had those looks
[1:05:13] go study it brother branham even
[1:05:16] sometimes makes some pretty
[1:05:18] bold statements a fine
[1:05:22] figure of a woman
[1:05:25] amen i'll just leave it at that
[1:05:30] but here's vashti satisfying no doubt
[1:05:34] every imagination of what one might say
[1:05:38] is a beautiful woman
[1:05:40] but you notice not just hearing these
[1:05:43] verses but going all through that
[1:05:45] not one mention of her character
[1:05:50] not one mention of her being called
[1:05:54] unless becoming atomic fodder is a
[1:05:58] calling
[1:06:00] not one mention of her calling
[1:06:04] not me one mention of what she was
[1:06:07] actually
[1:06:07] doing for the kingdom except for
[1:06:12] sowing the seeds of rebellion
[1:06:18] that would be the legacy of vashti would
[1:06:20] be that she
[1:06:21] was sowing the seeds of rebellion now
[1:06:24] let's just have our little tea party
[1:06:26] everyone
[1:06:30] and the chamberlain comes and says the
[1:06:32] king has called for you to come
[1:06:36] you can't tell me there's not influence
[1:06:40] when she in front of them said
[1:06:44] leave i'm not coming
[1:06:48] let me type that to you today in the
[1:06:50] moving of the holy spirit
[1:06:54] the holy spirit coming down in our
[1:06:56] presence coming in our church services
[1:06:58] coming in our lives however it might
[1:07:00] come
[1:07:02] and we refuse to respond
[1:07:06] you see how that seed of rebellion can
[1:07:08] come in and and
[1:07:09] you know it would be in reading and
[1:07:11] studying here
[1:07:13] coming across some lovely quotes and you
[1:07:15] know brother branham ties one of those
[1:07:17] to
[1:07:18] how in the wooing how satan coming and
[1:07:21] wooing
[1:07:22] this bride of christ he come in there
[1:07:24] and he wooed her with lovers and then
[1:07:28] brother branham types those lovers right
[1:07:30] into the trinity
[1:07:32] you see he wooed them into that and then
[1:07:35] they won't move from that
[1:07:36] even though the scripture is right in
[1:07:38] front of them and to realize that acts 2
[1:07:40] 38
[1:07:41] is the fulfillment of the book of
[1:07:43] matthew
[1:07:46] 28 19 is not a standalone my brother and
[1:07:48] sister
[1:07:49] acts 2 38 is the fulfillment or the
[1:07:52] explanation
[1:07:53] of that and it comes down but they won't
[1:07:56] move
[1:07:56] they've been wooed to that and they
[1:07:58] refuse to move from that
[1:08:00] and so then they have to cut god up in
[1:08:02] three pieces
[1:08:03] and they've got to convolute him and yet
[1:08:06] history
[1:08:07] if you'll study these things out and
[1:08:08] we'll touch on them in a future service
[1:08:11] because brother branham ties this
[1:08:12] together
[1:08:13] but you'll see my brother and sister
[1:08:15] what we call mariology today which is
[1:08:18] where
[1:08:18] they have lifted up and worship mary as
[1:08:22] the queen of heaven
[1:08:23] my brother and sister it is actually a
[1:08:26] demonic
[1:08:26] spirit that was taken from sun gods and
[1:08:29] moon gods and all of these things
[1:08:31] and then they said we got to get this
[1:08:33] somehow into modern day christianity
[1:08:36] so they just change names but they don't
[1:08:38] change the spirit
[1:08:39] amen so i can tell you that let me just
[1:08:42] flip this over to you
[1:08:44] amen we don't use the same name
[1:08:47] we don't have a vashti
[1:08:50] in the church but we have vastly spirit
[1:08:57] and so you just change the names but the
[1:08:59] spirit remains the same
[1:09:01] and so then we move on and we call that
[1:09:05] religion but you see
[1:09:08] when one comes to a place
[1:09:12] where there is you might say authority
[1:09:16] when there is influence the prophet of
[1:09:19] god i read the quote to you the other
[1:09:21] day i do believe the prophet of god says
[1:09:23] whenever we come into a place to be an
[1:09:24] influence for god
[1:09:26] we must humble ourselves daily
[1:09:29] that we would not be lifted up and not
[1:09:32] forget
[1:09:32] the reason of our position
[1:09:36] not forget how it is that we got here
[1:09:38] how it is that our sin and past life is
[1:09:41] behind
[1:09:41] us to come and just be religious people
[1:09:45] amen you see as i said before
[1:09:48] nothing's mentioned of her character
[1:09:50] only her beauty
[1:09:52] now there is a quotation that says time
[1:09:55] takes away beauty
[1:09:57] but it reveals character
[1:10:01] that's why i believe somebody i know a
[1:10:04] sister that had an apron that used to
[1:10:05] say
[1:10:07] don't marry or something for beauty
[1:10:11] how does that go sister jerry remember
[1:10:14] sister linda had that
[1:10:16] hey man don't marry for looks marry for
[1:10:20] cooking because looks don't last but
[1:10:21] cooking does
[1:10:23] something of that nature amen i think i
[1:10:26] slaughtered that
[1:10:28] but you know time will take the beauty
[1:10:30] away
[1:10:31] the handsome man i can give you
[1:10:33] quotations where brother branham's
[1:10:34] talking
[1:10:35] about i'll come in here and here's a a
[1:10:37] young man
[1:10:38] and uh here he is straight and tall and
[1:10:41] and strong
[1:10:42] and you know uh just hair and here's a
[1:10:45] a young sister in the beauty of life and
[1:10:49] she's standing there so
[1:10:50] so straight and so beautiful and you
[1:10:52] come back in a few years and the man is
[1:10:54] uh
[1:10:55] graying and and stooped over and the
[1:10:57] sister there is gray-haired
[1:10:59] and stooped over from carrying these two
[1:11:02] or three babies
[1:11:03] and so you just see the natural
[1:11:05] culmination of life
[1:11:07] brings about this transition in our
[1:11:09] lives amen
[1:11:10] and it don't matter we can't circumvent
[1:11:12] it you can go through life and eat the
[1:11:15] healthiest of of everything that you can
[1:11:17] eat
[1:11:18] and uh you know do everything you want
[1:11:21] and you'll wake up one day there'll be a
[1:11:22] gray hair there
[1:11:23] amen and then you'll wake up another day
[1:11:25] and that gray hair left
[1:11:27] amen so you know we have to be careful
[1:11:29] about how
[1:11:30] we place ourselves and how we do that
[1:11:33] and we should not forget how
[1:11:35] we get here amen i've got to this
[1:11:37] position
[1:11:38] now in romans my brother and sister the
[1:11:40] romans the
[1:11:41] the 12th uh chapter
[1:11:45] um we would come here
[1:11:48] and take these words for i say through
[1:11:50] the grace given unto me to every man
[1:11:52] that is among you
[1:11:54] not to think of himself more highly than
[1:11:57] he ought to think
[1:11:58] but to think soberly according as god
[1:12:01] hath dealt to every man
[1:12:02] the measure of faith oh i'll tell you my
[1:12:06] brother and sister
[1:12:07] i might not have the faith that you have
[1:12:10] been given
[1:12:12] but i want you to know i want to do
[1:12:14] everything i
[1:12:15] can to live to the utmost of the faith
[1:12:18] that god has given me
[1:12:20] it is not me comparing to you you carry
[1:12:23] comparing to me but you and i looking at
[1:12:26] what god has given
[1:12:28] us and saying lord i want to fulfill
[1:12:31] all that you have called me to be if you
[1:12:34] have called me bring forth thirtyfold
[1:12:36] lord then lord i wanna bring forth
[1:12:38] thirtyfold
[1:12:39] you called me to fiftyfold i wanna bring
[1:12:42] forth fiftyfold
[1:12:43] if you have called me to a hundred
[1:12:45] praise god
[1:12:46] i wanna bring forth a hundredfold i want
[1:12:49] to be
[1:12:50] what you wanted me to be not comparing
[1:12:54] to another because you see
[1:12:57] the measure of faith dealt to one
[1:13:01] might be more or it might be less
[1:13:04] than what was dealt to you amen now i'm
[1:13:08] going to just take this
[1:13:09] in this aspect to drive this point home
[1:13:12] if we start comparing ourself
[1:13:15] well i'm as spiritual as brother so and
[1:13:17] so
[1:13:18] i'm as faithful i read my bible i pray i
[1:13:22] feel anointed to the spirit
[1:13:23] just as much as he does praise lord i'm
[1:13:25] doing good what if he's only been given
[1:13:28] a measure of faith to bring 50 fold
[1:13:30] but god called you for a hundredfold
[1:13:34] you're self-limiting yourself but let me
[1:13:37] also turn it around
[1:13:39] you've been given measure for 50 fold
[1:13:41] and you compare your life to a
[1:13:43] hundredfold
[1:13:44] and you always are disappointed you're
[1:13:46] always struggling
[1:13:47] you're always depressed that you're not
[1:13:49] the kind of man that that one
[1:13:51] is why can't i be what he is if god
[1:13:54] dealt him a greater measure of
[1:13:56] faith my brother and sister you cannot
[1:13:59] be
[1:14:00] that person but god's not saying well
[1:14:03] i'm sorry i turned you out because you
[1:14:05] weren't what this person was
[1:14:07] the only measure we have is to go
[1:14:10] to the will of god the measure of faith
[1:14:13] dealt to us
[1:14:14] what the word said about us and take a
[1:14:18] holds of that my brother and sister
[1:14:20] and live it to the extreme and when i
[1:14:22] say the extreme i mean if there is 50
[1:14:25] fold there
[1:14:25] you live it to 50 fifty-fold push until
[1:14:28] the limit
[1:14:31] not waiting for some other measure
[1:14:36] but living to the measure of faith that
[1:14:39] was dealt to you
[1:14:42] you see the problem we have sometimes we
[1:14:47] touched this on the
[1:14:48] touched on this the other day if we're
[1:14:50] not careful
[1:14:53] we get to feeling quite well of
[1:14:55] ourselves
[1:14:57] we quite honestly tell ourselves
[1:15:02] that we are more than we are
[1:15:07] kind of reminds me years ago and i say
[1:15:10] this in light not judging the young man
[1:15:12] but we had a young man that
[1:15:13] come and we had some work on the farm
[1:15:15] that needed done
[1:15:18] and this young man says yes i know how
[1:15:20] to drive a tractor
[1:15:23] and we said okay you're going to have
[1:15:26] these five people
[1:15:27] we have this bean field that has to be
[1:15:29] rogued it had two different kinds of
[1:15:31] beans in it
[1:15:32] the one kind of bean was scattered
[1:15:35] randomly
[1:15:35] some kind of a cross somewhere along the
[1:15:39] line
[1:15:40] and we said you're going to drive the
[1:15:42] tractor and
[1:15:44] these guys are going to go and pull the
[1:15:45] plants that need to be taken out and
[1:15:47] they'll throw them on this
[1:15:49] deal mounted on the back of the tractor
[1:15:51] and you'll drive to the end
[1:15:53] you have the ease of driving up and down
[1:15:55] the row
[1:15:56] uh while they're pulling out the the off
[1:15:59] type
[1:15:59] beans but you have the labor of getting
[1:16:02] to the end and you have to shovel it all
[1:16:04] off by yourself
[1:16:07] so the trade-off hope you follow this
[1:16:11] young man okay we can do that we can do
[1:16:13] that he gets on the tractor
[1:16:15] grabs a hold of the shifter
[1:16:20] and we're like he doesn't know what a
[1:16:22] clutch is
[1:16:26] have you ever drove a tractor before yes
[1:16:29] yes
[1:16:31] what kind
[1:16:34] well i admit i drove a tractor that you
[1:16:38] just pushed the little pedal forward
[1:16:40] and it drove you see
[1:16:44] it's human nature to raise ourselves up
[1:16:47] into
[1:16:49] a higher place than we really are
[1:16:53] i think that's a lot about how the rich
[1:16:55] ruler ended up
[1:16:56] where he was at is he actually
[1:17:00] had accounted more to himself
[1:17:04] you see king hazardous recognize the
[1:17:07] effect that rebellion would have on his
[1:17:09] kingdom
[1:17:10] my brother and sister the prophet of god
[1:17:12] in preaching you can follow this
[1:17:13] continuity
[1:17:15] if you're aware of it all through his
[1:17:16] sermons you see what brother branham was
[1:17:19] doing
[1:17:19] as he was dealing with the denominations
[1:17:21] in the early times
[1:17:23] he was trying to get them just to be
[1:17:25] aware
[1:17:26] of how the seed of discrepancy had come
[1:17:28] into the church
[1:17:30] he wasn't accusing them of being the
[1:17:32] seed of discrepancy
[1:17:34] he wasn't accusing them of being
[1:17:35] anointed with an antichrist spirit
[1:17:38] he wanted them to be aware but the
[1:17:40] season for being aware
[1:17:42] and the season for action my brother and
[1:17:44] sister are interconnected
[1:17:46] if you are aware there comes a time that
[1:17:49] you must
[1:17:50] act upon that you can't sit back and say
[1:17:53] praise the lord
[1:17:54] if i do this i will make a rapture and
[1:17:56] then just talk about
[1:17:58] it there has to be an action take place
[1:18:00] and
[1:18:01] king of hazards recognizes the effect
[1:18:03] that this spirit of rebellion would have
[1:18:05] on his search
[1:18:09] and he said if this is continued in our
[1:18:11] church it's going to produce a church
[1:18:14] that puts christ on the outside
[1:18:17] amen wanting to get in but not in
[1:18:21] and the people talking about him talking
[1:18:24] about what he can do what
[1:18:26] he has done and what he will do in the
[1:18:28] future
[1:18:29] but wouldn't even let him inside to do
[1:18:31] the work
[1:18:34] see that spirit of rebellion comes in
[1:18:36] such a fashion
[1:18:37] that's why brother branham said that a
[1:18:38] religious spirit
[1:18:40] is the most dangerous of all the spirits
[1:18:43] because it's the one that talks about
[1:18:45] god glorifies god but won't serve him
[1:18:49] and when we talk about serving my
[1:18:51] brother and sister anything
[1:18:53] short of a hundred percent is not true
[1:18:56] service
[1:19:00] have you ever been in a restaurant i'll
[1:19:02] tell you i i got to experience something
[1:19:05] it was a little bit daunting in one
[1:19:07] sense but
[1:19:08] i accepted the challenge and when we
[1:19:10] were in phoenix
[1:19:12] uh brother ron peterson he said brother
[1:19:15] paul tomorrow morning
[1:19:16] uh the old brothers meet for breakfast
[1:19:20] over here at this place you want to come
[1:19:22] and i was like i'm not an old brother
[1:19:25] but i wanted breakfast so i i went
[1:19:29] and we go out there and my brother and
[1:19:31] sister i want to drive this point to you
[1:19:32] what service is
[1:19:35] now this is a two-edged sword when we
[1:19:36] talk about it in the natural
[1:19:38] so here's this fairly long table full of
[1:19:40] brothers i was by far the youngest there
[1:19:43] just
[1:19:43] to you know but
[1:19:47] this whole table full of old brothers
[1:19:49] and and the young lady comes
[1:19:51] and obviously she knew all of these guys
[1:19:54] call them by name
[1:19:55] and whatnot and ask them if they wanted
[1:19:57] their regular their coffee their regular
[1:19:59] way
[1:19:59] did they want their orange juice with a
[1:20:01] touch of sprite
[1:20:03] do you want this do you want that and
[1:20:05] she obviously knew that and this young
[1:20:06] lady
[1:20:07] you you just hardly would think about
[1:20:09] something and she
[1:20:10] she would have it right there and then
[1:20:12] she went to take orders
[1:20:15] and um some of the brothers are like i'm
[1:20:16] going to eat something different today
[1:20:19] and then they went right back to their
[1:20:20] conversation
[1:20:22] and finally she comes back to them do
[1:20:24] you know what you want oh i haven't even
[1:20:25] looked at the menu
[1:20:28] and this young lady just patiently stood
[1:20:30] there
[1:20:33] she never expressed one bit
[1:20:36] of attitude
[1:20:40] one brother apologizes saints i want you
[1:20:43] to catch this
[1:20:46] and she looked at him and says my job
[1:20:50] is to serve you
[1:20:53] oh that we could talk to our lord jesus
[1:20:56] like that
[1:20:57] that we could bring from our heart lord
[1:20:59] my job
[1:21:01] what i was called on this earth to do
[1:21:04] lord
[1:21:05] is not have an attitude but my job is to
[1:21:09] serve you anyway
[1:21:13] lovely young lady
[1:21:16] we're all done i hope you see the humor
[1:21:19] of this
[1:21:21] i decided in the natural i saw a reason
[1:21:24] why
[1:21:24] she's so happy to wait on these and
[1:21:27] practically every one of those brothers
[1:21:29] got up they ordered a ten dollar
[1:21:31] breakfast and gave her a twenty dollar
[1:21:32] tip
[1:21:34] and when they walked out of there she's
[1:21:36] like see you guys next monday
[1:21:39] come back
[1:21:43] but my brother and sister if i if you
[1:21:45] could catch the point i'm trying to make
[1:21:47] see she recognized she didn't have an
[1:21:50] assurance that the tip would be what it
[1:21:52] was
[1:21:52] but she had an attitude or or a
[1:21:56] expression of i'm gonna serve you
[1:21:59] first and see what the reward will be
[1:22:03] afterward oh i tell you my brother and
[1:22:06] sister we as sons and daughters of god
[1:22:08] we need to not question what the reward
[1:22:11] is going to be we need to not
[1:22:13] focus oh lord if i serve you do i get to
[1:22:16] have eternal life
[1:22:18] we need to serve him from the depths of
[1:22:20] our heart because there's a desire
[1:22:22] as the bride of christ to serve him
[1:22:26] oh hallelujah if i serve my husband will
[1:22:28] he give me nice clothes and nice this
[1:22:30] and nice that
[1:22:31] no my brother and sister love your
[1:22:33] husband amen do all that you can
[1:22:35] serve your husband amen and if he
[1:22:38] doesn't respond like you think
[1:22:40] the prophet of god said grab him by the
[1:22:42] shirt front and tell him if he doesn't
[1:22:44] change
[1:22:47] no he said
[1:22:52] pray that's what changes things
[1:22:57] now look at this i'll get sidetracked
[1:22:59] start preaching to our sisters now you
[1:23:00] sisters start
[1:23:01] serving better wait you already served
[1:23:04] better than we serve you
[1:23:05] so anyway we'll go on
[1:23:09] i didn't say that did i see
[1:23:12] he recognized the effect that rebellion
[1:23:14] would have on his kingdom
[1:23:16] and we see perfectly my brother and
[1:23:18] sister i hope you're in tune with me
[1:23:20] because you start studying the message
[1:23:22] you'll see this reoccurring thing
[1:23:24] popping up over and over and over and
[1:23:26] over again how the people wanted god to
[1:23:29] perform first and they would serve him
[1:23:32] after when the reality was
[1:23:35] god says serve me first and i reward you
[1:23:38] i will give you even to the half of my
[1:23:41] kingdom
[1:23:42] by a reward eternal life for your
[1:23:44] service
[1:23:45] for your love for your adoration but we
[1:23:48] as humans want to see
[1:23:49] something first and as we reference and
[1:23:52] cross-reference this
[1:23:54] we recognize the connection between the
[1:23:56] spirit
[1:23:57] and the church we'll see how that the
[1:23:59] churches in the day
[1:24:01] amen brother branham preaching in the
[1:24:02] indictment and other places
[1:24:04] my brother and sister we're looking at
[1:24:06] today how the church has come
[1:24:08] and they have said you know what we we
[1:24:10] all want to serve god we want to worship
[1:24:13] god
[1:24:13] we want to be identified with god but we
[1:24:16] want to really run this our own way
[1:24:18] amen says scripture types it out in the
[1:24:20] parable or story as it were
[1:24:22] of seven women one husband you don't
[1:24:25] have to provide for us you don't have to
[1:24:27] do nothing for us
[1:24:28] we just want your name and that's what
[1:24:31] we have in the world today
[1:24:33] is churches amen that simply are wanting
[1:24:36] to do what they want to do
[1:24:38] but they want to claim the name of jesus
[1:24:40] christ
[1:24:41] saints of grace let's make sure we never
[1:24:44] go there
[1:24:45] let's make sure that we serve god
[1:24:48] because we want to be personally
[1:24:51] identified with him
[1:24:53] we want to be known as his wife hence
[1:24:57] the the term bride amen that we take
[1:25:00] this
[1:25:01] so we recognize the connection between
[1:25:03] the spirit
[1:25:04] and the church when the holy spirit has
[1:25:07] liberty
[1:25:08] you will find a church that is filled
[1:25:10] with the power of almighty god
[1:25:12] you'll see answered prayers you'll see
[1:25:14] people happy to be serving god
[1:25:16] when you find a church that has deviated
[1:25:19] into their own interpretation
[1:25:20] of what god desires for this day my
[1:25:23] brother and sister you will find a
[1:25:25] church
[1:25:25] then is starting to operate in its own
[1:25:27] authority and when god says come they
[1:25:30] can look at him and say i ain't coming
[1:25:33] see that spirit that attitude is there i
[1:25:35] ain't coming
[1:25:36] and they believe that there's no
[1:25:38] consequence but we see in this story of
[1:25:40] a hazardous
[1:25:41] my brother and sister he knew if that
[1:25:43] spirit spread through the kingdom
[1:25:46] that then he would just lose it all that
[1:25:48] it would all fall apart
[1:25:49] and hence he says i have to do something
[1:25:52] now
[1:25:53] my wise men my men who recognize the
[1:25:56] season the time that we're in
[1:25:58] what do we do and they said you what
[1:26:00] you've got to do is let it be known
[1:26:02] that she no longer is even considered
[1:26:06] royalty
[1:26:09] i would say there would be nothing worse
[1:26:11] in a position to walk around the rest of
[1:26:13] your life saying
[1:26:14] i once was the queen past tense
[1:26:18] not identified in the day that i am the
[1:26:21] queen
[1:26:22] but i once was the queen why are you no
[1:26:24] longer the queen
[1:26:26] because i wouldn't listen to the king
[1:26:30] now look through the scripture saints
[1:26:32] see how that the prophet of god breaks
[1:26:34] this
[1:26:35] all down and shows clearly how that at
[1:26:37] one point in time
[1:26:38] could be identified we are the queen
[1:26:41] they still say
[1:26:42] i'm the queen of heaven but they no
[1:26:44] longer have
[1:26:45] any authority in the kingdom of god
[1:26:49] amen they have lost all authority they
[1:26:51] have been put out
[1:26:52] and while she might have still used his
[1:26:55] name
[1:26:57] she was no longer of him are you with me
[1:27:01] you see we had well let me tie this
[1:27:04] together here get ahead of myself too
[1:27:05] far
[1:27:06] revelations 3 17 see this would
[1:27:09] identify the spirit of our day but my
[1:27:11] brother and sister would also identify
[1:27:13] the spirit of vashti
[1:27:15] because thou sayest i am rich and
[1:27:17] increased with goods and have need of
[1:27:19] nothing
[1:27:21] and know us not that after you have
[1:27:23] rejected the king
[1:27:25] you are wretched miserable poor
[1:27:28] blind and naked
[1:27:31] you realize what happened to vashti they
[1:27:34] didn't take her out in the backside the
[1:27:36] desert and throw her out there for the
[1:27:37] wild dogs
[1:27:39] saints they actually took her to the far
[1:27:41] corner
[1:27:43] of the king's house
[1:27:47] and they put her there and she never
[1:27:51] fellowshipped in the body of believers
[1:27:55] again she never saw the king again she
[1:27:59] never talked to the king again
[1:28:01] every communication what you might say
[1:28:03] is vashti became
[1:28:05] a prisoner of her own
[1:28:09] creation amen
[1:28:12] and you'll find my brother and sister
[1:28:13] when we as sons and daughters of god
[1:28:15] dealing with the things of life i'm
[1:28:17] going to speak straight to you here
[1:28:18] we deal with the things of life the
[1:28:20] issues of weaknesses of our flesh
[1:28:22] and when god comes says i'll deliver you
[1:28:24] of that and we won't respond to the holy
[1:28:26] spirit
[1:28:26] we will end up in a prison of our own
[1:28:29] creation
[1:28:30] and people will say it was god's fault
[1:28:32] it was the church's fault it was the
[1:28:33] pastor's fault
[1:28:34] my brother and sister it is of their own
[1:28:36] creation
[1:28:37] vasti could have said yes just as easy
[1:28:40] as she said no
[1:28:42] and you and i can say yes just as easy
[1:28:45] as we can say
[1:28:46] no and so we don't want to come to a
[1:28:49] place in our life where we look and say
[1:28:50] i'm in this position
[1:28:51] because of this message of the hour i'm
[1:28:54] here because of this
[1:28:56] person and because of that person no you
[1:28:58] had a choice yes or no
[1:29:00] amen and often times we say no because
[1:29:03] of
[1:29:04] our feelings our emotions our weaknesses
[1:29:07] our little complexes
[1:29:09] we say no because it requires radical
[1:29:11] change in our life
[1:29:12] we say no because it will cause us to
[1:29:14] actually be exposed to the body of
[1:29:16] believers
[1:29:17] that's right amen
[1:29:21] i've shared this before and i just make
[1:29:22] note of this
[1:29:24] when you see the holy ghost moving in
[1:29:26] the midst of a people
[1:29:28] you will see people breaking away
[1:29:31] from bonds that have held them i
[1:29:33] remember being back east i'll just kind
[1:29:35] of keep it vague
[1:29:36] probably last time i shared this i spoke
[1:29:38] too much forgive me
[1:29:39] but my brother and sister the power of
[1:29:42] god's starting to move when the holy
[1:29:44] ghost is unleashed and people are
[1:29:45] willing to say
[1:29:46] oh lord speak to me
[1:29:49] and families coming up and speaking to
[1:29:52] brother jewell brother jewell just asked
[1:29:53] me to be part of it
[1:29:55] and it's there and they're speaking the
[1:29:57] deep
[1:29:59] secrets of the problems
[1:30:02] of their families
[1:30:06] any volunteers
[1:30:10] you know why there isn't in the flesh
[1:30:15] because we're ashamed embarrassed
[1:30:18] we don't want the world to know that but
[1:30:20] you know what happens when the holy
[1:30:21] ghost starts to move
[1:30:23] the holy ghost comes and moves upon the
[1:30:25] believer
[1:30:27] so strongly they want to be right with
[1:30:29] god more than they care what you
[1:30:31] think about them they want to be right
[1:30:35] with god and be delivered of this spirit
[1:30:38] more than they care what any human on
[1:30:41] earth might say about them
[1:30:44] but you see it's got to break through
[1:30:45] the power of pride
[1:30:48] and self-preservation to get into that
[1:30:51] element
[1:30:53] and then they come and they confess deep
[1:30:55] dark secrets that you say oh my goodness
[1:30:58] really can that be true well it can be
[1:31:00] true my brother and sister
[1:31:02] because somewhere along the line they
[1:31:03] said no
[1:31:05] but oh god rich and mercy come along and
[1:31:07] the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:31:09] moves upon them and they say yes lord i
[1:31:11] want free
[1:31:13] yes lord i want delivered yes lord i
[1:31:15] want the holy ghost
[1:31:18] and god comes and delivers them and they
[1:31:21] stay delivered
[1:31:22] amen hallelujah that's a point my
[1:31:26] brother and sister
[1:31:27] getting out of prison for the day is not
[1:31:30] a pardon hallelujah
[1:31:33] two queens two
[1:31:37] natures
[1:31:40] completely opposite in character amen
[1:31:44] this queen replaced by another
[1:31:48] we'll get deeper into these things as we
[1:31:49] look at the church ages and look at what
[1:31:51] brother brown says about these things
[1:31:53] but this queen has been replaced by
[1:31:55] another now look what it is she got
[1:31:57] replaced
[1:31:58] with a queen that fit the nature
[1:32:02] of the king oh hallelujah not a
[1:32:05] rebellious queen
[1:32:06] not a queen that says it's my way
[1:32:10] ah anyway lord forgive me
[1:32:14] song of my childhood just popped in my
[1:32:15] head i promise i
[1:32:18] i won't speak it out okay you don't have
[1:32:21] to spank your kids to get them
[1:32:22] quit singing that you see
[1:32:26] this queen replaced with another
[1:32:30] god didn't just throw another person in
[1:32:32] there
[1:32:34] god chose one that fits so perfectly
[1:32:40] for the season coming not a queen that
[1:32:44] fit the idea of a queen of days gone by
[1:32:47] but a queen that was fit to rule in
[1:32:49] laodicea
[1:32:52] not to live to to rule back somewhere
[1:32:55] else
[1:32:56] but leo decia she's a queen that was
[1:32:58] chose for laodicea
[1:33:00] amen this true queen is so perfectly
[1:33:03] tailored

[1:33:06] taylor so she is so
[1:33:08] perfectly formed to fit
[1:33:13] this other this this king amen she
[1:33:16] wasn't of her own nature
[1:33:17] trying to be pressed into but she was
[1:33:20] tailored to fit the very nature of the
[1:33:23] king
[1:33:24] and she is so perfect oh i hope you get
[1:33:26] this she is so
[1:33:28] perfect in his sight she he thinks she
[1:33:31] is him
[1:33:34] come on did you catch that she is so
[1:33:36] perfect
[1:33:37] in his sight that the king looks at her
[1:33:40] and says she is me i am her she is me
[1:33:44] amen that's where the prophet of god
[1:33:46] speaks these words out of scripture
[1:33:48] talks about these things right bone of
[1:33:50] his bone amen spirit of his spirit flesh
[1:33:53] of his flesh
[1:33:54] right because she is him
[1:33:57] hallelujah he's not looking at something
[1:33:59] that hoping one day
[1:34:00] she will be like him but he sees her
[1:34:04] and says she is me this bride of mine
[1:34:08] this queen of mine is me
[1:34:11] hallelujah so conformed to the word of
[1:34:14] god

[1:34:17] myself forgive me we'll come upon these
[1:34:19] things again but
[1:34:20] amen so much like the king his nature
[1:34:24] his desire
[1:34:25] what he longed for so much like him he
[1:34:28] says i'm going to give you an equal
[1:34:29] place in my kingdom
[1:34:30] my brother and sister do you know in
[1:34:32] business in business if you want to form
[1:34:35] a corporation you want to form an llc or
[1:34:37] whatever
[1:34:38] you be real careful if you have partners
[1:34:40] that aren't flesh and blood and maybe
[1:34:41] even them
[1:34:42] but uh you know you want to leave
[1:34:46] yourself even the most margin of control
[1:34:51] start an llc brother trevor and i are
[1:34:55] going to go into business together
[1:34:56] building tiddlywinks

[1:35:41] trust
[1:35:42] a queen with a character
[1:35:46] that he hasn't have to question what
[1:35:48] she's going to do
[1:35:49] he knows that she cares about him
[1:35:54] and his kingdom she's going to serve him
[1:35:57] in fact she's going to become an advisor
[1:36:00] to him
[1:36:01] honey do you see this that comes out my
[1:36:04] brother and sister you know in the story
[1:36:06] of esther
[1:36:07] she says you know what this guy's gonna
[1:36:09] wreck wreck the kingdom he's gonna cause
[1:36:11] all kinds of divide and trouble
[1:36:13] and murder and death and whatever else
[1:36:15] and i can't
[1:36:16] let that happen to my husband's kingdom
[1:36:20] now you can say well it was all about
[1:36:21] the jews know my brother and sister if
[1:36:23] you look
[1:36:24] study and find the continuity she was
[1:36:26] looking out
[1:36:27] for her husband's kingdom
[1:36:30] in more than one way that's right right
[1:36:33] because she was
[1:36:34] a queen of heaven amen and a queen to a
[1:36:38] kitten
[1:36:39] hallelujah she's watching out for that
[1:36:42] she cares
[1:36:44] given an equal place in the kingdom
[1:36:47] see one living only of the blessings of
[1:36:49] the kingdom and one desiring to full
[1:36:52] fill all the king asked of her see this
[1:36:55] is the tale of two queens
[1:36:57] two spirits in the framework
[1:37:00] of the christian church there's two
[1:37:03] queens on the earth today my brother and
[1:37:05] sister
[1:37:06] there's two queens one making her
[1:37:08] profession that she's queen
[1:37:09] and one that almighty god says this is
[1:37:11] my queen
[1:37:13] i don't want to be the one standing
[1:37:14] around saying i'm the queen i'm the
[1:37:15] queen i'm the queen and everybody knows
[1:37:17] you're not
[1:37:18] amen but to be one where the king would
[1:37:21] say this
[1:37:22] is my queen and i have according to the
[1:37:26] word even given to her the half of the
[1:37:28] kingdom
[1:37:29] because she will rule and reign with me
[1:37:33] hallelujah now i'm going to get very off
[1:37:35] into this and we'll touch it again
[1:37:37] but the prophet of god talking about how
[1:37:39] it is my brother and sister
[1:37:41] this bride of christ she's not going to
[1:37:43] go through this judgment
[1:37:44] she's already left and then she comes
[1:37:47] back
[1:37:48] to sit with him in the judgment
[1:37:51] hallelujah so you're going to be in
[1:37:52] judgment my brother and sister but
[1:37:54] you're going to be there with your king
[1:37:57] and you're going to have a divine
[1:37:59] judgment you're going to have a divine
[1:38:02] understanding you're going to have a
[1:38:03] divine compassion
[1:38:06] now this will just touch on this and i
[1:38:08] don't mean to make a point
[1:38:09] but you hear a lot of people guy holds
[1:38:11] the door for him praise the lord
[1:38:14] it's like a cup of cold water he's gonna
[1:38:15] have eternal life
[1:38:17] i've run into people that have dispensed
[1:38:19] eternal life to everything under the sun
[1:38:21] my brother and sister
[1:38:22] for everything under the sun
[1:38:26] but i'll tell you on that day it will be
[1:38:27] a divine
[1:38:29] judgment it won't be our neighbor was so
[1:38:32] kind
[1:38:33] to us because see you're going to have a
[1:38:36] hard time
[1:38:37] tying together a man who's blasphemous
[1:38:41] and gave you a bag of potatoes so
[1:38:42] therefore he's got eternal life
[1:38:45] and have a hard time in the natural
[1:38:47] balancing things out
[1:38:52] but on that day you bride queen
[1:38:55] we're going to sit there with a divine
[1:38:57] judgment
[1:38:58] amen not an emotional judgment
[1:39:01] not analytical judgment not a judgment
[1:39:04] from history
[1:39:05] but a divine judgment that you will be
[1:39:09] able to speak according to the word of
[1:39:11] god and the will of god
[1:39:13] why because you know the mind of your
[1:39:15] husband
[1:39:16] oh isn't that beautiful to know the mind
[1:39:18] of your husband
[1:39:20] i tell you my brother and sister i find
[1:39:22] it so lovely in the natural
[1:39:24] amen now i've seen brothers you know
[1:39:27] this one brother told me says now
[1:39:28] brother paul he says i want you to
[1:39:29] understand something
[1:39:30] he said i act annoyed in public when my
[1:39:34] wife
[1:39:34] finishes my sentences i was like i
[1:39:38] noticed that
[1:39:40] but he said truly i'm actually pleased
[1:39:43] because my wife knows me so well
[1:39:47] the same wife who finishes my sentences
[1:39:50] knows exactly how i like my socks folded
[1:39:54] she knows exactly how i like my
[1:39:56] breakfast
[1:39:57] she knows exactly how i like my clothes
[1:40:00] in a closet
[1:40:01] she knows exactly how that when we're
[1:40:03] going on a trip
[1:40:04] that i like to leave at an exact time
[1:40:08] and she's always ready he said so
[1:40:11] just to keep her unsettled in how old
[1:40:14] men get
[1:40:16] keep her unsettled i always that grumpy
[1:40:19] can't i finish my own sentence
[1:40:22] i've been there before when the sister
[1:40:23] was like you're not capable
[1:40:28] and then they smile at each other and
[1:40:29] hold hands as they walk off
[1:40:32] oh my look
[1:40:36] tale of two queens two spirits in this
[1:40:38] framework of the church
[1:40:40] let me hurry right along here now
[1:40:43] we have different religions and we have
[1:40:45] different motives and different
[1:40:46] theologies but our christian religion is
[1:40:48] based solemnly
[1:40:50] upon death burial and resurrection in
[1:40:52] the second coming of the lord
[1:40:54] oh it's a it's an important question and
[1:40:58] as we are now approaching to my
[1:41:00] most sincere thoughts we are living in
[1:41:01] the very shadows of his second coming
[1:41:04] there to my way of seeing it by the
[1:41:06] light of the scripture
[1:41:08] there is not one hope left for the
[1:41:11] church
[1:41:11] outside of the second coming of the lord
[1:41:15] now my brother and sister do you follow
[1:41:17] that
[1:41:19] some people say see there's just no hope
[1:41:22] that's not what he's saying the second
[1:41:24] coming of the lord
[1:41:25] but let me divide this down in two parts
[1:41:29] there is his spiritual or presence that
[1:41:32] has come which some people just freak
[1:41:34] out and they're like
[1:41:35] oh oh presents perugia oh this is
[1:41:38] horrible it's a false thing
[1:41:40] no perugia is true the misuse
[1:41:44] of perugia heresy however you want to
[1:41:47] say it
[1:41:48] the misuse of that is false but the very
[1:41:51] fact that god has come right down in our
[1:41:54] presence and is present with
[1:41:55] us this morning is an absolute biblical
[1:41:59] prompts of almighty god
[1:42:01] he said i'll be with you even in you
[1:42:04] amen so his presence is here now those
[1:42:07] who took that doctrine
[1:42:08] and said god's already come and we can
[1:42:10] act like a bunch of rebels because it's
[1:42:12] already done deal so now we can go act
[1:42:14] like the world
[1:42:15] because we've been sealed my brother and
[1:42:17] sister you talk about an anointing
[1:42:19] that has to be upon these people that
[1:42:21] say i
[1:42:22] i've got the holy ghost but i can now
[1:42:24] have permission to act like the devil
[1:42:28] make a lick of sense does it amen so you
[1:42:31] know it's like well
[1:42:32] i'm a carpenter but i like to burn my
[1:42:34] work down
[1:42:40] you see the presence of almighty god
[1:42:42] once in the heart and mind and soul of a
[1:42:44] son or daughter of god
[1:42:45] leaves them in such a love affair that
[1:42:48] is so deep
[1:42:49] that as the prophet of god says now i'm
[1:42:51] getting ready to go to africa
[1:42:53] and if i was to go and get a hold of my
[1:42:55] wife and tell her now my dear wife if
[1:42:57] you go with any
[1:42:58] other men if you do this if you flirt if
[1:43:01] you this that and the other
[1:43:02] when i come home you're divorced and
[1:43:04] then he turns it right around
[1:43:05] and says and she reaches up and gets a
[1:43:07] holes in front of my shirt and says mr
[1:43:09] branham
[1:43:10] if you are over there and you do
[1:43:11] anything and you this that and the other
[1:43:13] when you come home
[1:43:14] you're going to be divorced and the
[1:43:15] prophet of god says wouldn't that be a
[1:43:17] lovely home
[1:43:20] then brother brown says and i wouldn't
[1:43:22] hurt her for nothing
[1:43:25] because i love her
[1:43:28] now look at this relationship as a
[1:43:29] christian my brother and sister
[1:43:31] even if these perugia people that have
[1:43:33] this idea that now because god's come
[1:43:35] and they're sealed they can behave in
[1:43:37] the old wicked old way
[1:43:38] my brother and sister they defy the very
[1:43:40] words of a prophet they say they believe
[1:43:43] see that shows you right that that
[1:43:44] spirit is not right because you can't
[1:43:46] take it through the word
[1:43:48] so i tell you here we are my brother and
[1:43:50] sister are living in a time the second
[1:43:52] coming of the lord
[1:43:53] i'm here to declare you there'll be a
[1:43:55] lot of people that might question and
[1:43:56] say
[1:43:56] paul you don't know what you're talking
[1:43:57] about but i'm here to tell you this
[1:43:59] morning
[1:44:00] he is here the prophet of god himself
[1:44:03] said he
[1:44:04] is here is that the physical coming of
[1:44:07] the lord
[1:44:08] no my brother and sister it is not but
[1:44:10] he said that he would come
[1:44:11] anoint you and i with his holy spirit he
[1:44:14] would come and manifest himself to us
[1:44:17] and the prophet of god says these
[1:44:18] different ways that god comes
[1:44:20] and shows himself he called it in morphe
[1:44:22] when he comes in more faith
[1:44:24] it's all god so god moving in our
[1:44:27] presence the holy spirit dealing with
[1:44:29] our young people dealing with our old
[1:44:31] people
[1:44:31] dealing with everyone and we say that oh
[1:44:34] my brother and sister you imagine if you
[1:44:35] just pull
[1:44:36] oh well it's our emotion it's not the
[1:44:39] presence of god
[1:44:45] you know what you become in that
[1:44:47] scenario
[1:44:49] callous you become so calloused
[1:44:54] that you'd say i don't need to be moved
[1:44:57] i've got the holy ghost i can be angry
[1:45:00] demanding rude
[1:45:04] and it doesn't matter
[1:45:07] it does matter the prophet of god didn't
[1:45:10] make that
[1:45:11] references and influence of the holy
[1:45:14] ghost being a dove
[1:45:16] just to fill up time in a church surface
[1:45:21] he was speaking to the very nature that
[1:45:24] we would
[1:45:25] search for and long for and desire to
[1:45:28] become
[1:45:30] as we're now approaching my most sincere
[1:45:32] thoughts we're living in the very shadow
[1:45:33] of the second coming
[1:45:34] there to my feelings it is by the light
[1:45:36] of the scripture there is not one hope
[1:45:38] left for the church
[1:45:39] outside of the second coming of the lord
[1:45:42] i want you to
[1:45:43] think about the day we're living in
[1:45:45] right now right here in the united
[1:45:47] states
[1:45:48] the world is in its wild pandemonic
[1:45:51] condition now that word my brother and
[1:45:52] sister
[1:45:53] is not pandemic
[1:45:58] it is rooted in pandemonium
[1:46:04] yes sir all through my childhood
[1:46:08] my early adulthood and unfortunately
[1:46:10] late adulthood
[1:46:12] every person who ever climbed the fence
[1:46:15] at the congressional buildings got shot
[1:46:18] dead
[1:46:20] until now and they moved the barricades
[1:46:24] out of their way
[1:46:26] and somehow there's an investigation
[1:46:28] somehow
[1:46:31] the side doors on the portico
[1:46:34] of the congressional building were just
[1:46:36] all unlocked
[1:46:39] a total breach of
[1:46:42] protocol and security that's taken place
[1:46:45] for
[1:46:46] 200 years
[1:46:48] just happened to happen
[1:46:55] and a man gets the congressional medal
[1:46:59] of freedom for telling them people
[1:47:02] you can't come in here we don't even
[1:47:05] know what a hero
[1:47:06] is anymore
[1:47:10] and a poor woman who just happened to be
[1:47:12] in the wrong place at the wrong time
[1:47:14] had no business being there but is about
[1:47:16] as dangerous
[1:47:17] as a book end gets shot dead
[1:47:20] while people ripping computers off of
[1:47:23] desks
[1:47:24] monitors off of walls paintings off of
[1:47:27] walls
[1:47:28] waltz right out nothing happened
[1:47:31] if this doesn't fit pandemonium
[1:47:36] i don't know what does it's chaos my
[1:47:39] brother and sister
[1:47:41] yeah the world
[1:47:44] in its wild i don't know if i'm even
[1:47:47] pronouncing it right
[1:47:49] y'all forgive me that's what happens
[1:47:51] when you
[1:47:52] ignore school and then drop out of it
[1:47:56] this wild pandemonic condition has got
[1:47:58] completely out of control
[1:48:00] of every man-made organization in the
[1:48:02] world
[1:48:03] kings cannot hold their subjects no more
[1:48:07] neither can dictators hold their
[1:48:10] subjects anymore
[1:48:11] democracy cannot hold its subjects
[1:48:15] anymore
[1:48:16] and there is no hope left with the
[1:48:18] second coming
[1:48:19] of the lord jesus i tell you what i
[1:48:22] believe
[1:48:23] this was spoken for this hour
[1:48:26] right here amen absolute pandemonium
[1:48:32] this man burns a car he's giving an
[1:48:34] expression
[1:48:36] a protest this man burns a car he's a
[1:48:39] domestic terrorist
[1:48:41] if that is not pandemonium even the
[1:48:44] leadership
[1:48:45] is in absolute confusion they don't know
[1:48:48] right from wrong left from right they
[1:48:50] don't know good from evil evil from good
[1:48:53] we are living in the time my brother and
[1:48:55] sister this was spoken
[1:48:57] in 1957 but the title to me
[1:49:00] declares it all at the second coming of
[1:49:03] the lord
[1:49:05] hallelujah we're going to see this kind
[1:49:07] of things happening
[1:49:08] and this is where we are at today amen
[1:49:12] we are at i you know what i could say
[1:49:15] this
[1:49:15] this right here could be pulled out and
[1:49:17] made into a
[1:49:19] a uh uh uh uh what would you call it i'm
[1:49:21] trying to think of the words amen
[1:49:23] a current events this could be brought
[1:49:25] in taunt to our homeschool kids and
[1:49:27] public school kids
[1:49:28] as a current event this is what's
[1:49:30] happening a prophet of god
[1:49:32] stood up under the anointing preached
[1:49:33] the word and said you're going to see
[1:49:35] complete pandemonium
[1:49:36] come into our nation you're going to see
[1:49:38] illogical things
[1:49:39] you're going to see things that are so
[1:49:41] far out of the word of god my brother
[1:49:42] and sister
[1:49:43] that it will just boggle your mind might
[1:49:46] even terrify you
[1:49:47] but don't worry when these things appear
[1:49:50] look up
[1:49:52] look up your redemption draweth nigh why
[1:49:56] the spirit of two queens
[1:50:01] that's right now i won't go into it
[1:50:03] because it's a little deeper and i'm not
[1:50:05] one that usually likes to just jump into
[1:50:06] all these things but
[1:50:08] my brother and sister the prophet's
[1:50:09] testimony of a season
[1:50:12] coming of a leadership
[1:50:15] there's never been an inauguration with
[1:50:17] so many women with purple dresses on
[1:50:21] the has been
[1:50:24] the wannabe
[1:50:29] now i say this with a little humor
[1:50:30] please forgive me
[1:50:33] you need to make sure when you start
[1:50:35] looking at this stuff and making up your
[1:50:36] mind
[1:50:39] that you look at it from god's view not
[1:50:42] our view
[1:50:43] because i would say none of these apply
[1:50:45] because none of them are beautiful
[1:50:49] but you see we don't understand exactly
[1:50:53] the words the prophet was anointed when
[1:50:54] he was talking about a beautiful woman
[1:50:57] in what context was that beautiful in
[1:51:00] what way was that expressed i
[1:51:02] honestly have to say i would not know i
[1:51:05] would not know so any one of them that
[1:51:07] was there might have completely
[1:51:08] fulfilled that
[1:51:09] or maybe none of them did but it doesn't
[1:51:12] matter because i can give you a quote
[1:51:14] right now where brother branham said
[1:51:16] he's going to come maybe maybe in 15 in
[1:51:18] 25 years maybe in 50 years
[1:51:21] maybe a hundred that's right
[1:51:24] well do the math from that date we've
[1:51:26] got a ways to go
[1:51:32] hallelujah
[1:51:35] sister vika i don't know if you're ready
[1:51:38] right now or not
[1:51:40] but
[1:51:43] christ the mystery or christ revealed in
[1:51:46] his own word i mean
[1:51:48] now the next thing happened we're going
[1:51:50] to shift corners right here saints
[1:51:52] it's when it's all gathered up into that
[1:51:54] one person jesus christ
[1:51:57] bride and body
[1:52:00] at the physical return of the lord jesus
[1:52:03] making his three times when he's brought
[1:52:04] to earth killed crucified raised up
[1:52:06] manifesting himself
[1:52:08] in the form of his body which
[1:52:11] is his bride don't ever let
[1:52:14] somebody try to take away the
[1:52:17] significance
[1:52:18] of who you are in this
[1:52:22] message okay and now look i know
[1:52:25] i'm misunderstood and it sounds like i'm
[1:52:28] kind of anti or pushing back but
[1:52:30] i'm not i believe in balance amen
[1:52:33] but you look at this my brother and
[1:52:34] sister a prophet of god clearly saying
[1:52:36] right now
[1:52:37] that manifesting himself am i reading
[1:52:40] the right words
[1:52:41] in the form of his body which is
[1:52:44] his bride so what we have right here
[1:52:48] it's not all about a prophet that
[1:52:50] brought a message
[1:52:51] there has to be a bride to fulfill
[1:52:55] this form this position this place
[1:52:59] this identity what other word can i use
[1:53:02] to fill in that place
[1:53:03] my brother and sister there has to be a
[1:53:06] bride
[1:53:07] that will be part of that body will be
[1:53:10] blended together with our lord jesus
[1:53:12] christ
[1:53:13] and his bride remember i made the
[1:53:15] comment earlier that esther would be one
[1:53:17] that was such of the nature such as the
[1:53:20] form she was such that she would just
[1:53:22] mold her fit right in there and become
[1:53:25] one with her king
[1:53:26] amen that's you and i we have been
[1:53:29] formed we have been tailored that's the
[1:53:30] word i'm looking for
[1:53:31] we've been tailored by the word of god
[1:53:34] not
[1:53:35] man's form not man's idea not man's
[1:53:38] manipulation can we say amen to that
[1:53:40] that we are so tailored by the word of
[1:53:43] god the moving of the holy spirit
[1:53:45] that we blend into our lord jesus christ
[1:53:48] and we become one with him amen we're
[1:53:51] not off to the side we're not secondary
[1:53:54] to the show god pulled it right in and
[1:53:56] said you know what
[1:53:57] you are flesh of my flesh bone of my
[1:53:59] bone spirit of my spirit
[1:54:01] you are me i am you hallelujah
[1:54:05] and it's their see which is his bride
[1:54:08] the woman you get it she is part of his
[1:54:12] body
[1:54:13] and the woman and the man is just so
[1:54:15] close
[1:54:16] together till they're just almost they
[1:54:19] are the same hallelujah
[1:54:21] oh hallelujah look what the prophet of
[1:54:23] god did he come along and put a little
[1:54:24] quantifier on there
[1:54:26] they ought to be anyhow amen and i'd say
[1:54:29] to anyone that's married
[1:54:31] and they don't have that kind of
[1:54:32] relationship husband and wife
[1:54:34] do something about it because it is
[1:54:37] possible
[1:54:37] to become so close that you are one in
[1:54:41] spirit
[1:54:42] in mind not in the physical body but in
[1:54:45] a spiritual body
[1:54:46] to be part of the body the kingdom of
[1:54:48] almighty god
[1:54:49] the prophet of god says this body can't
[1:54:52] move without all its parts
[1:54:54] oh hallelujah they ought to be anyhow
[1:54:58] there they are see they just exactly
[1:55:01] manifested the same
[1:55:04] you catch the english of that it's
[1:55:06] talking about the lord jesus
[1:55:08] and his wife the bride the woman
[1:55:12] amen just exactly manifested
[1:55:16] the same there's none of this the lord
[1:55:20] told me to do something i know it
[1:55:22] doesn't seem
[1:55:22] it seems contrary to the word but the
[1:55:24] lord told me to no no they're going to
[1:55:26] manifest the same
[1:55:27] we are going to become the pitcher
[1:55:30] of the word oh hallelujah i'm sorry i
[1:55:34] just get excited
[1:55:35] she is a part of him because she was
[1:55:37] taken out from him
[1:55:39] and the bride way back when in the first
[1:55:42] century you know that we had a perfect
[1:55:44] example of a church back there way back
[1:55:46] when oh we had the dark ages i mean what
[1:55:49] he said is it
[1:55:52] and the bride today
[1:55:55] do you believe in the literal
[1:55:56] manifestation of a message
[1:56:01] you see if we don't then we can take
[1:56:02] whatever part we want because it's
[1:56:04] abstract
[1:56:05] and in the abstract you can draw out
[1:56:07] whatever part of the abstract that you
[1:56:08] want to draw out
[1:56:10] but in the literal manifestation and the
[1:56:14] bride today is taken out from the body
[1:56:16] of christ
[1:56:17] that's why you always were different
[1:56:20] that's why you never fit in in school
[1:56:22] that's why you never fit in the world
[1:56:23] you never fit in that
[1:56:24] because you're not of that body you're
[1:56:27] of this
[1:56:28] body the body of jesus christ amen and
[1:56:31] the bride today is taken out from the
[1:56:32] body of christ
[1:56:33] which is acting and doing just exactly
[1:56:36] like he
[1:56:37] said it would do for this day
[1:56:40] brother christian our little
[1:56:42] conversation this is why i believe
[1:56:44] this is the manifestation of the message
[1:56:47] of the hour
[1:56:48] it is not because a sign took place here
[1:56:51] a supernatural event here
[1:56:52] a thought or a heart was discerned there
[1:56:54] a healing took place
[1:56:55] over here it's because this message is
[1:56:58] producing
[1:56:59] a people a people who are not bound by
[1:57:03] fear not bound by law not
[1:57:05] bound by ideology they are bound by a
[1:57:08] love
[1:57:08] for jesus christ amen and he said this
[1:57:12] is what the word would
[1:57:13] the bible said this is what would be
[1:57:15] produced in this day amen
[1:57:17] hallelujah let me just read it all in
[1:57:18] continuity here and the bride today is
[1:57:21] taken out from the body of christ which
[1:57:22] is acting and doing just
[1:57:24] exactly like he said it would do for
[1:57:27] this day
[1:57:28] the bride the queen
[1:57:31] king and queen hallelujah
[1:57:35] well there might be two queens on the
[1:57:37] earth but one of them's got power and
[1:57:38] authority and half of the kingdom
[1:57:40] hallelujah aren't you glad god didn't
[1:57:42] just give you a worldly queen spirit
[1:57:46] amen you know the one that struts itself
[1:57:48] up and down the street and says i am
[1:57:50] rich
[1:57:51] and i have need of nothing hallelujah
[1:57:54] god help us sister emmy would you come
[1:57:56] hallelujah you know saints
[1:57:59] we have this lovely lovely
[1:58:04] experience today
[1:58:09] our sister vika amen god been dealing
[1:58:12] with her heart
[1:58:13] amen amen and as the lord deals with our
[1:58:17] young people
[1:58:18] old people whoever it might be people
[1:58:21] amen as god deals with him we want to
[1:58:24] saints create an atmosphere
[1:58:27] what the word says we will be let us be
[1:58:30] we don't want to we don't want to put
[1:58:33] any kind of
[1:58:34] men's ideas because when we put
[1:58:37] men's ideas into it we end up with men's
[1:58:40] results
[1:58:42] and so far i look around this world and
[1:58:45] they're not doing too well
[1:58:47] more money more wealth more whatever
[1:58:50] than ever before and less of god
[1:58:54] but god said that he would pour himself
[1:58:58] out this is kind of a paraphrase
[1:59:01] he poured himself out in this generation
[1:59:05] did god have to hold back what he poured
[1:59:06] out
[1:59:08] no sir he poured all of himself and we
[1:59:11] were here to receive that
[1:59:13] and by god's grace and god's mercy we've

[2:00:37] we've been given this just gorgeous
[2:00:41] beautiful position as sons and daughters
[2:00:44] of god
[2:00:45] and as a word would come to pass we

[2:00:49] looking in a world that increasingly is
[2:00:52] caught up
[2:00:54] i just read a little deal the other day
[2:00:58] this young girl she's 17 years old
[2:01:02] sing some kind of spanish
[2:01:05] pop hip-hop mixture or whatever

[2:01:19] fingernails is now famous and
