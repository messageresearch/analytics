our brother scott and amen to welcome him into our midst not just as a visitor but now as a brother here in the church god bless you brother scott we are so happy uh to have you with us and look forward as the lord would tarry to many days many times of fellowship amen hallelujah well just to clarify something brother sergey is i i happen to ask sister yulia in the foyer he is probably going to be home tomorrow so we're thankful for the lord uh just to give him that job that he was searching that load he was searching for to come home so we're very happy to do that sister toma i pray that you have a lovely lovely trip home as lovely as flying in this time can be but god bless you all your connections and all your travels amen so well saint i found the perfect formula for brother paul not preaching too long and that is don't charge your ipad very much and therefore you can't preach too long so and then also i want to just put everyone to rest sister jerry and i are doing just fine she just decided to sit on the other side of the church so all is well there amen let's just stand and uh go to the word once again uh age old proverbs i want to just kind of go back we're going to just take some thoughts as we find them we want to place placing value in the correct place and we want to start actually in the new testament and uh ii corinthians and kind of take a uh modern more when i say modern i mean new testament new covenant uh um a foundation for our thought tonight and uh so second corinthians the fourth chapter starting with the first verse therefore seeing we have this ministry now remember saints every one of us has ministry this is not a there's a preacher in the pulpit and i'm just here to go to church we have a ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty now i want to tell you saints just uh just give you a little example of how satan would throw things or put things in your path i uh recently just purchased a an object or a thing and and the man as he was filling out the title he says i'm willing to write any value in what i sold it to you for you just name it i'll put it on here and so it would be easy to take a value that is the true one and say i don't have to pay as much sales tax if we lower the value but you see we have rejected renounced the hidden things of dishonesty now let me put it to you in this context as a pastor you would never know if i told that man oh cut the price in half see that would never never never you come to your knowledge but you see i could never preach truth to you with the hidden things of dishonesty it's tainted many a man and we have to guard ourselves to remain completely honest in all things regardless whether it costs us in the flesh cost us financially emotionally we have to be honest not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts can we say amen to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earth and vessels the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed heavenly father we just thank you lord for your word ask you to move tonight in our midst speak to us father lord let it be fresh from your throne we pray lord for every need every request every circumstance lord named or unnamed uh brother kerry brother kerry brother trevor sister kerry on vacation lord uh with the family lord each and every one our sister sue every one father that would not be here with us tonight just ask you lord just to come and be fresh to them brother prashant sister concha father just remembering each one that's a part of this assembly we ask for your guidance now in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated hallelujah i hope i don't speak to you tonight like i was speaking to everyone else today and i kept just my thoughts were too far ahead and i kept jumbling up my word so lord help me tonight that i i won't jumble this up to you as we look here in ii corinthians as we have just read we look at verse seven but we have this treasure in earth and vessels and often times saints we have read this scripture and uh you know if we're not careful we'll just simply look at the earth and vessel we'll look at this and say oh my you know uh god in us you know uh christ in you the hope of glory many people struggle with that i've heard people before say if god is in me where is he at my brother and sister we we don't want to get caught up in trying to discern what it is and i propose to you tonight that while we are looking at these scriptures as we are studying this thought we won't talk i i really appreciated the leadership of the holy spirit had no idea what brother jason was going to sing he had no idea what i was going to speak on but this last song my brother and sister was just very moving to me because it is there if we are not careful the devil will keep dredging up everything that we've ever every mistake and maybe even worse than ourself in the greatest battle ever fought uh dealing with our own mistakes is that we would be anointed to dredge up everyone else's mistakes also so god help us that we would be able to take the mercy and grace of god apply it in our life today and let the talk not be of whether we are worthy or not not to talk of our failures but tonight we want to talk on the place that god chose to put his treasure now if we'll look at this and realize the value that the word of god is right heavens and earth shall pass away but god's word will never fail so we're talking about something that is not even using the word intrinsic would not even cover the base of the value of the word of god to sons and daughters of god the word was spoken has never failed it's the same yesterday today and forever and that word is the very life of a believer so we want to look tonight at not just uh this vessel this earthen vessel which is prone to its mistakes prone to its shortcomings prone to many things but my brother and sister it is the place that god deemed worthy a place that god said i can clean that right the word of god shows us very clearly that god will not place his spirit in an unclean vessel he will not place his spirit in a dirty vessel so my brother and sister the word of god shows us clearly that we must wash the vessel inside and out it must be spotless and god pours himself in it and the word has declared that he has amen that the power of verse 7 may have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency not just the base value my brother and sister but the excellency of the power may be of god so there's going to be a people that are going to in the eyes of god be exceedingly worthy can someone say amen tonight exceed exceedingly worthy to be filled with the spirit of god not just oh i'm just barely getting by but come to the place to realize that god is the one who does the cleansing god does the sanctifying god does the filling and god in the beginning we call it predestination did the choosing of the vessel he wanted to pour himself in so you can stop and i'm going to speak this a little strong right here you can make a decision you can choose to look at your failures and those failures around you and dwell on them or you can choose to choose to choose oh god help us to choose to be one that says you know what the excellency of the power of god in me was god's decision not mine so therefore if god can't make a mistake he did not make a mistake when he said i'm going to pour my excellency into you hallelujah somebody ought to actually be excited about that come on saints i know maybe a long week so far but you're not amending me you are ameniting the word of god you're telling god thank you that you chose me to pour yourself into amen so you know as i said you can talk about the failures but we want to choose to talk tonight about the place that god chose to put his treasure now my brother and sister the scripture talks about how that they would be places that those that and will i think i have that in here if not i meant to but people will will put their treasure in places that the moth will eat and it will canker your choice my choice or we can recognize who we were called to be and say that's where i'm putting my treasure i'm going to put myself in the place god wanted me to be in now remember as i spoke to you and i have quotes to back it up if anybody needs me to defend it but my brother and sister the word of god is not self-fulfilling god wanted you to do your part he wanted me to do my part so we can't just sit back and say if god wants this to happen it'll happen you know that's kind of like you know just saying well if if i'm to get a good job they'll call me while i sit on the couch at home it don't work that way my brother and sister the self-fulfilling side of god is you being anointed to stand up and say i believe i am one that was called i believe that the treasure of god has been placed in me and i'm gonna move into this position and claim it i'm going to act on it now in proverbs we'll take this now to to uh collect this uh thought and put it into place tonight uh my son if i will receive my words and hide my commandments with thee so my brother and sister it's not hiding the commandments as it were somewhere else you've got to hide that in you so that thou incline thy ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding yea if thou criest after knowledge and lift us up thy voice for understanding if thou seekest her as silver and searches for her as for hid treasures now my brother and sister we can live in a day to day well let me finish this then thou shalt understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god now my brother and sister many times in the age that we live in the word of god says it will happen we are watching it come to happen that people start to search the word of god they will search the message they're trying to find something different they're trying to find as it were something more and they're not waiting for revelation they're not waiting for god himself to open up their eyes and their ears they're they're they're just looking and you know often times when we come outside of the will of god trying to put together maybe something of a new revelation as it might be that we'll do that and we come up with wrong conclusions but as we look at this word right here this is not a man this is not a a woman this is not a brother or sister who is trying to come to be the most knowledgeable or be the one of the greatest understanding but this is one who's actually simply crying out to god they are not looking to man they're not looking to answers from man but seeking the answer from god and so when they become in in a place that their heart and their desire is so strong that they constantly as the scripture says those that sigh and cry for the wickedness in the city the prophet of god said if you have the holy ghost you will be sighing and crying for the abominations in the city so it's there that you see that example what the holy ghost would move upon sons and daughters of god to cry for the sin out there how much more would the holy ghost move upon you and i to cry for more understanding and more of god and so as we are there it's satan is there to distract us i tell you i'll just i'll just be bold to put it this way i have recently just praying lord help me have a better prayer life a stronger prayer life i don't want to just pray oh lord there's this problem over here in this problem over here i want to pray in the spirit i want to be able to claim the victory of those things that i see no evidence of victory i want to be anointed to pray for victory and claim it right there even though the devil and the world would say you can't claim that victory that's not victory right now but i believe this word i believe what the word has said and i want to live in that realm where i can look out in a need yes i'll be bold and say it tonight maybe i see something in a in the body of believers here that troubles me something that i struggle with and i don't want to sit here and just moan and groan oh lord if they would just oh lord if they could oh lord i want to stand up and say lord your word promise these are sons and daughters of god i believe that the victory has already been declared and i'm claiming it today so therefore i'm going to stand up and say victory is in the camp hallelujah oh some of you say well i don't know i don't feel like much victory well i'm here to tell you you might just fulfill what you feel come on saints i feel defeated then you're gonna approach everything in front of you with a spirit of defeat oh i'm going by my feelings brother paul well you go by your feelings my brother and sister it doesn't work very well doesn't work at all reminds me one time some brothers was hunting and their set up their tent uh just a little ways from the creek and there was a little trail went down to the creek a little bank there it was dark out and one of the brothers said well guys i i'm going to get up here and i'm just going to he had to call in nature and he said i'm just going to go off over here and and one of the brothers says well here's my flashlight and he said i don't need a flashlight i can just kind of feel my way along a few minutes later or not even minutes they hear a great big splash he felt his way along all right he felt it right over to the bank and fell in the crick now my brother and sister i hope you can see and make the context of that to realize it's not about feeling it's about knowing amen it's about us knowing who we are and knowing that god didn't come down and pour his holy spirit and call a vessel that would spend its whole life saying i'm unworthy i'm unworthy i'm unworthy it's time for us as a bride of christ to stand up and say if god chose to pour the excellency of his treasure into me i must be worthy hallelujah come on saints this is not a raw raw this is a stepping stone or foundational stone for you being able in the face of all challenges be able to say i'm victorious hallelujah amen now let's look at this word taken here in context of of uh of proverbs 2 the word treasure reference number 4301 now i love this i got excited my brother and sister when you see this because the very first words of this treasure in reference to this scripture is secret storehouse did you know come on are you with me tonight saying so i'm going to harass you until somebody comes alive do you realize i'm not picking on anybody you're just the closest a secret storehouse the world doesn't see what god has chosen to hide in each one of you the world cannot see will not see it's a secret remember the prophet of god said that what is going to move i'm just paraphrasing it the moving of the holy spirit in these last times will not be a public display it is a secret storehouse of god himself poured into you and i god didn't just say well i got to put myself i got to pour my spirit somewhere i guess i'll just pour it here and i'll just pour it there no my brother and sister he knew exactly where he was pouring it you wouldn't go down here and put your money in a bank that was advertising that it was going broke you wouldn't go out here and bury your money in something that was fixing to fall in the canyon amen god knew exactly god didn't look down and say i just hope that these people don't fail in laodicea i i hope that they don't give up in this last hour god looked down and said i'm going to pour myself into this vessel right here because this vessel is predestinated to be an overcoming vessel this vessel is going to be one that when it gets difficult they might a waiver they might be pushed to the side they might be buffeted but they will stand they will not give up and when it gets difficult they will get more determined to serve me hallelujah god didn't say well i just hope my brother and sister that's not how god works amen god knows amen so a secret storehouse aren't you glad tonight that you are a secret storehouse of the holy ghost in laodicea amen i tell you i get excited about that the definitions go on to be secreted valuable hidden riches hallelujah imagine how god looks at you now you know esther being one of my favorite ladies in the bible favorite sisters you know when esther come and stood in the 48 to go to the king she put on the very best of her rags to see the king no sir do you understand my brother and sister how the king dressed the queen was not a reflection of the queen it was a reflection of the king and the scripture says that we've been clothed in righteousness revelations 19 amen we're not clothed in rags my brother and sister we're not as the scripture also describes in the book of revelation standing here naked but we've been closed with the righteousness of almighty god because it's not a reflection we think oh oh it's so difficult especially young people i you know i i get made fun of her people look at me or snicker or this and that because you know how we live and what we believe my brother and sister do you understand it's not a reflection of you it's a reflection of the king they're snickering the king but god clothed his bride in his very righteousness because that's a reflection of him oh my goodness are you getting this tonight saints come on i don't you know i don't want to just keep harassing you but i got 10 bucks can i get an amen amen hallelujah now if god be with us then where are all the miracles i really like this quote a good thoroughbred christian knows where the storehouse of god is they know he doesn't say they're studying or searching for or hoping he's speaking of a past tense state of knowledge they know a good thoroughbred christian knows where the storehouse of god is they know that they are born of the word can someone say amen the word is made flesh amongst them no sir he says in them see there's a struggle you say well brother paul you don't have a struggle with that i know but a lot of people do they think god's present with them they struggle with the idea that god's in them that the manifestation of jesus christ the lord jesus christ on the earth today is not him in that same physical body that went to calvary that manifestation of him today is you people struggle with that the word is made flesh in them every word that god says they don't different with it they say it's right amen and amen they punctuate it with an amen every time amen amen something in them see it's not a mental conception it's not just something of knowledge it's something in them it's something that is responding to the word and taking them to that position that something in them punctuated what is it that causes them to punctuate it himself back to the scripture christ in you the hope of glory the very life jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he do also amen go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and these signs shall follow them that believe amen you see we're not looking at a gospel that's declining my brother and sister you look here in the day that we are living uh and this might sound a little harsh but we're looking in the day that we're living look around the pentecostal movement is getting more worldly all the time you look in the denomination more worldly all the time you look at the various offshoots of holiness getting more worldly all the time my brother and sister this word of god as a prophet of god talked about how long revivals last in the moving of the holy spirit if you want to stay around i'm hoping for a rapture myself but if you want to stay around you'll find this true word of god will not decline it will not falter it will not compromise it will not give up and it will not in the sense of hiding from persecution go underground it will always be lived openly the life of the believer will always be lived before this world so as we look and realize my brother and sister as we are coming into these times we have to make sure that we place our value in the correct place we'll come to a time and i know i hit on this once in a while but i keep having you know push back as it were and different people that don't don't agree but my brother and sister i i'm telling you i don't i don't really want to fuss about it it's just a spirit that's there and getting stronger every day now the prophet of god says here that the true believer right the thoroughbred christian knows where the storehouse of god is you know that's really something that's actually kind of a little fuss around the message right people talking about where the storehouse is where the storehouse is well the prophet of god is telling us the word is our storehouse amen now i would put it this way that the word expressed through the message meaning the word of god expressed through the message is the sore house for the believer we are not having to go and try to go to a certain place to be doled out a certain amount of something at a certain time but god through revelation is speaking to the hearts of sons and daughters of god that we can come and realize that the storehouse is right there now the prophet of god tells us my brother and sister that if you want to get closer to god get down on your knees and pray and ask god to reveal himself to you and i i just say you don't have to no one please lift your hand but i want to ask you do we do that do we get down on our knees and say lord i need you to reveal yourself to me or do we sit back and hope that somehow we just find things to keep us encouraged i would say my brother and sister let's get down on our knees let's not sit back and say oh well you know if god wants my brother and sister that is a very feeble very feeble approach to the word of god well if god wants well of course he wants look at what the prophet of god says go look it up yourself amen sometimes good for you to do homework go look what brother branham says about john 3 16. there's enough power in john 3 16 to save the world but how many people actually accept it how many people really applied john 3 16 correctly ouch okay put your seat belts on i don't say this with anything more than to make a point to you the word express through the message is a storehouse for the believer and now look my brother and sister you will find quotes just look up storehouse you'll find quotes where brother branham talks about the tabernacle being the storehouse and a lot of people feel very strongly today about the tabernacle being the storehouse but you'll also find quotes where brother branham says that the tabernacle has problems so if we're going to just take word for word now look don't don't pick on me folks here or anywhere else don't pick on me but if we're going to just take say only what the prophet of god said the storehouse has problems but you will not find a single quote to support the idea that brother branham thought the bible had one single problem he said the bible from beginning to end genesis to revelation dovetails and has not one mistake because it is the written word of god so even though you've got three more quotes that say the tabernacle might be the storehouse and only one quote that says that the word is a storehouse my brother and sister this was a prophet he is not a prophet of the people he is not a prophet of an age in that sense he was a word prophet amen his whole goal his whole desire his whole presentation was to take you and i back to the word not a location we're not muslims we don't have a mecca we don't got some certain place we have to go worship but the word of god is our absolute amen it is the place that we can anchor and there is the storehouse that we can feed on and it don't matter if you're in the jungles of south america you're in the deserts or jungles of africa you're in the far north in the cold or the far south in the cold wherever you might be that storehouse is there and the door is open to feed us hallelujah you know there'll come a time now the prophet of god eludes to this and i i don't know how it will be because he says in other places things that seemingly would would not go together but my brother and sister i believe that we'll come to a time that it won't be just a little cake walk and then we take a rapture there's gonna be a squeeze the prophet of god talks about a time that a squeeze is gonna cause the bride to go into desperation and desperation's what's going to get her in the face of god did he not say that amen and so you look at this what it's going to be what if this church becomes a storehouse what if it comes you know a warehouse what if they come and and no longer able to say we know that you know them and them and them and we deny you the right to get together them what if you find yourself isolated you don't have a telephone any longer you don't have this what are you going to do with her up and blow away no sir you're going to go to the storehouse you're going to go right in there the door is open you're going to feed feed feed and rapturing faith is going to come to you and you'll remember what the word of god is he'll lay it on you and you will understand it you'll confess it and god will honor that i tell you my brother and sister don't let ourselves be caught up in the denomination idea that we just have to do this and we have to do that but come to the place that god would come and put our priorities put our values in the right place hallelujah oh hallelujah i'll have to say amen to myself tonight amen and i don't like preachers that amen themselves amen now look here i hope you weren't if any of you weren't offended about what i said right there but it's the truth it's the truth we have to realize that the storehouse is the treasure of the word of god the holy ghost that was poured in you the life that is in you i'll share this i shared this with sister jerry today i read a book many years ago i can't even tell you where this took place i'm thinking it was like england or europe or something and and these men wanted to steal this big diamond but there was such security around this diamond that it was impossible to get to the diamond without setting off the alarm so what they did is they went to every public display everything every picture they could get of this diamond and they made a a uh uh a counterfeit diamond that looked exactly like the diamond that was worth so much and they knew that the alarms would go off when they got close to the diamond but you see they chose an avenue that would be contrary to the thinking of man and so they got themselves all prepared and they got ready and got entrance into that room and boldly they didn't try to creep up there they knew the alarm would go off they took the fake diamond went into the room and where all of the lasers were shining that were the alarm they just simply took their fake diamond pulled the real one out set the fake one in there and went and went back up into the ventilation of the building and when security flooded into the room and they come in there and they're looking for somebody who has stolen they see the diamond and they come to a conclusion that it was a false alarm and while they're concluding it's a false alarm the thieves are getting away you realize saints satan don't have to take you away from this message he's just got to set something that looks like the message we'll have the right doctrines we'll dress walk talk do everything just right and we'll place value in that but the only place we can place value is in the real word of god you know the holy spirit says that we would not even be able to call jesus the christ without the holy ghost but yet the world's full of people that say jesus is the christ what does it mean you'll only be able to discern the real jesus christ in our midst my brother and sister with the holy ghost so it's not a matter of how many books or how many tapes or what church we attend or who our pastor is it's that experience that relationship of jesus christ in our life is why the scripture can say it would deceive the very elect if it were possible because with the holy ghost in you it's not possible but just as an individual as a man or a woman or a young person it would be possible to be deceived that's why it's so important that we get the holy ghost because then we truly can say that jesus is the christ because we know him hallelujah well i could share another little story but i won't go there i won't go there maybe can i can i go there thank you for giving me permission once upon a time years ago these people had a little project and some of them were makeup artists you know not as in trying to make you know weird stuff but like well maybe you'd call it weird stuff so what they were their little project was is and all men involved i i think this is the funny part the men got together all the men involved were in it together and they studied videos of each other's mannerisms and then the makeup artist made this man like this man and then they tried to see if they could fool the wife sounds fun actually but did you know in the end they couldn't fool a single one of them because there's no way to impersonate the personality and one of them come in greeted his wife and laid the mail down on the counter and she stopped and said what's wrong with you and because the man doesn't know he's like well what do you mean and she says you haven't got the mail in 20 years i hope you get my point amen that's why we must know christ himself as it were personality because we would know him so personal the devil could come in any form and could not fool us because we know him personally not just a representation of him not just a as it were an image of him but the real jesus christ in our midst hallelujah now are we all right now you want to know where our hearts are the scripture tells us that uh in matthew 6 19 lay not up for yourself treasures upon earth or moth and rust doth corrupt right so any treasure on earth is going to corrupt and where thieves break through with steel but lay up for yourself treasures in heaven where neither moth nor roth doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also so as you look at this my brother and sister you know you look at that it says for you where your treasure is is where your heart is at and now i i say today tonight wanna know where your heart is oh lord search my heart that's what david he cried out to the lord lord search my heart well let's just stop and look what our treasure is there's where our heart is at where's our treasure the real bride of christ my brother and sister she has a different heart you realize this examination is not for the faint of heart you know many people are like i don't want my preacher to preach like that i don't want him to to do that i don't want it down in such a personal level in fact i would prefer that the preacher never make eye contact with me in church i in fact i want him to just look i had a brother tell me this once and it was just he says you know brother paul sometimes you'll go preach somewhere and you realize people just they're just not agreeing with you and i said my yeah i know what you mean brother he goes you know what i do he says if they don't have a clock in the back of the church i just stare at the spot the clock should be and i preach and some of you hmm no my brother and sister this is a personal gospel it's not a gospel that we hope and pray that the preacher don't step on our toes we should come to church saying lord let him come and if there's something shy in my life something that shouldn't be there let him deal with it lord i give you permission lord to come and just bear me by the holy spirit people are like well the preachers got it out for me maybe it's god that's got it out for you maybe he wants to shed these things in your life so that you can come into a proper position so you see this kind of examination is not for the faint of heart this is not for the person that just wants religion come on my brother and sister i've said this before and i know i'm misunderstood i've been kind of hacked on this but if we're just coming to church for religion's sake let's go be mormons they have way more programs they have baseball teams basketball teams they have well anyway hallelujah those of you that dance they even have dances in their church so we're looking for a church for fun well hello there's a lot of churches have a lot more fun reminds me one time we're down in phoenix we're driving around and a brother tells me he says hey brother paul see that big church right there i thought it was like a college campus and he says no no that's like one of the biggest churches in phoenix and did you know that their summer baseball league has 400 men show up to play and i said wow i asked how do you know it goes oh i work with a man change churches so he could be on a team over there that's what i want church to be about hallelujah who's got the winningest team who's won the intercollegiate church championship 10 years in a row no sir i'm here because i want god to cleanse me wash me prepare me because i want to go in the rapture amen hallelujah so this is not for the faint of heart but this kind of examination is for those who are committed to be what they're called to be nothing like falling short my brother and sister of the goal that you have set before you and so you look at that now if you want to look about the treasure the value of the treasure in us see you can't place that value on yourself right the scripture already says that it's in him because if you place this value on yourself as we use this uh phrase which is kind of a take off from the scripture that pride cometh before the fall you know if we start getting lifted up hey we we grace are more message than they are we're more message than they are we're more spiritual than they my brother and sister that's not what it's about it's about us preparing ourselves to be washed by the water of the word to fulfill what god called you amen hallelujah proverbs 11 verses 1 and 2 i like this scripture a false balance and abomination to the lord so if we don't balance things in our life we judge things unfairly unbalanced we are an abomination to the lord but a just wait is his delight when pride cometh then cometh shame but with the lowly is wisdom god help us to put that to work in our life amen we're here my brother and sister not to place a value on this vessel but to place a value on what he has placed in this vessel and if we value what's placed in this vessel then we do what is best for the atmosphere of the holy spirit remember brother branham says that the holy spirit's like a dove very timid when you find boastful and arrogant people my brother and sister you very rarely find the moving of the holy spirit in the sermon door inside the door brother brown says the eyes open we look at flashy things remember everything that glitters is not gold i've done a lot of prospecting and fool's gold which is iron pyrite shines a lot brighter than real gold but the value in it be sure that your eyes see the right thing amen i'll just throw this in because i just recently read it brother brown i'm talking about how the churches would come to a time that they would choose their ministry because he was tall good-looking had dark wavy hair uh oh not tall not good looking don't have dark wavy hair we got trout we got trouble so we got problems but go look the quote up i'll let you do the homework on what the profit of god said oh i can't help myself he said that real believers a real church now i'm paraphrasing this a real church real believers want a man they don't care what he looks like they want a man that will get in the word of god and tell them the truth look at the difference tall good-looking wavy hair my it never was wavy and it's well it was wavy it's waving goodbye but but the american people this this is us saints we've just seen so much of god god's been so good to us until we don't recognize him it becomes you say let's go down to the meeting to some neighbor who's preaching well so and so oral roberts oh oral roberts is a great man of faith oh he has a if you'll excuse the inspection a bulldog grip he will stand there and throw that big hand down and holler three or four times and if nothing else he will scare the devil out of you he has such a bulldog grip and he believes it and god honors it or roberts is my bosom friend a mighty man of faith oh i've heard oral roberts before you say well brother branham is down there oh yes i've seen brother branham stand up there and it'd be a discernment and tell the people i've seen that before the trouble of it is you've seen so much of it it's become so common to you till it doesn't give the results it ought to give you realize saints right here in grace god has walked the aisles of this church over and over again we have felt the presence of god strongly and people walk out into the foyer and tell you of their troubles and their problems and the things in their life why weren't they here getting rid of those things why weren't they taking god at his word at his promise and saying i want deliverance from the spirit that's bothering me tormenting me binding me why why is it my brother and sister because we've seen god do so much it's become so common until it doesn't give the results that it ought to give god help us saints i'm not condemning no one i'm put myself right out here on the pew i'm preaching to myself tonight but see if we want results we've got to expect results we've got to claim results and we've got to actively pursue results not sit back and say if god wants if god wants god wants you to stand up and claim what is rightfully yours god's not going to force you you know i've set in services as a young man now figuratively my brother and sister this seems humorous but in reality it's not at all i've sat in services where the preacher believing had discernment believing he had cause would come and come right down in the sanctuary and maybe grab a young man like brother sean's hand and reach down here and go boy you are going to the altar and literally drag them out of their seat to the altar you know what it did to that young man yeah he knew there was things in his life that weren't right he wants to serve god but it shamed him it didn't move him it shamed him and he's embarrassed because now everybody's like what's he doing what's going on with him but when the holy spirit comes down in our midst and the word of god speaks to our heart and we won't respond it's not hey i just didn't want to go up there you're not telling brother paul or any other preacher no you're telling god no let's start placing value where we should let's start pursuing as it were the excellence of what god has placed in us and not put this low value that if i feel like i'll respond you know the old phrase if the shoe fits wear it we know that phrase i think it's a worldwide phrase i've heard it spoken africa i've heard it spoken europe i've heard it spoken south america i've heard it in australia i've heard it here in the united states and canada if this shoe fits wear it why are we so resistant because we're not placing the right value we're not placing the right value not placing it in the right position are we okay tonight hallelujah you know i think we'll just stop right there sister emmy would you come i'll just read the last of this quote i've got it highlighted the trouble of it is you've seen so much of it it's become so common to you till it doesn't give the results that it ought to give i say tonight saints from my heart and like i said i'm preaching to paul he's on the pew it's time for us to place value where we ought to place value it's not how we dress or how people view us isn't it so silly isn't it so silly we worry about what people think about what we do or how we look or what's going on in our life we're so consumed with the idea it's important that these people look up or look up to us or think well of us what we should be consumed with is lord what are you pleased because i tell you if we have a church of like-minded believers no one's going to look at you and say well we dress a little better we have a little better car a little better house we have a house we have this we have that but nobody cares nobody cares if we have a church full of like-minded believers we're all going to be here desiring a moving of the holy spirit in our life a washing of preparing as it were and knowing the best part of rejoicing that god would not pour the excellency of himself into just any old vessel but he chose you he chose you he anointed you he washed you he prepared you and he's going to redeem you oh my brother and sister i was thinking about adding another little portion to the scripture and maybe we'll just bring that out in another time but you look at this and realize we wouldn't be here tonight if it wasn't for god's will if it wasn't for god's disney this world would have consumed us already oh god help us saints i pray just just take time i ask you that's all i can do is just ask you take time ask god reestablish the value of who he is in our life and who we are in the word hallelujah you know i'd like to sing that little song the same god amen just reading as i studying for this and looking through things you know i'm brother branham making the point it's the same god he goes and he names all these different events that took place in scripture and then he makes this emphasis it's the same god my brother and sister we read the song same god part of the red sea amen same god brought darkness on egypt and light and goshen the same god my brother and sister where some were there and and and you know we look in the dark ages and and we see the christians being forced out on the ice and you know they stripped them naked that's embarrassing isn't it some of us would turn back because we just simply wouldn't be naked as it were physically because the gospel we'd say nope ain't doing that but god's so anointed a man who is a guard [Music] that he is there took off his sword took off at everything and laid it down on the ice and he told the man that was turning back he says don't do this this is real this is real the man continued and this man started shedding his clothes as he walked out upon the ice because he saw god in flesh real before him i want to be that kind of believer i want to be that kind of man that would be able to stand up and say this is of god and i don't care what it is going to stand out here on the ice in a bitter cold day and freeze to death and i'm willing to do it he could have just been a secret believer could have walked away from there as a soldier and said i think that's right you know i'll i'll embrace that but he was willing to stand up and say i want to be counted i want to be counted he placed a value where the value should be placed oh the same goes i look back on history see the mighty god but i can't keep on dwelling on some past memory cause he's a saint god who's living in me oh the same god is spoke to that woman at the well he's the same god as wonders to marry to tell the same god who did sea he's the same god who's living in me [Applause] the same god who created all the heavens and all the earth came back living in jesus there's power but now in these last days i'm beginning to see that it's the same god who's living in me yes the same god is spoke to the woman at the well he's the same god as wonders too many to tell the same god who hearted the raging breathing he is the same god who's living in me [Applause] oh the same god who created all the heavens and all the earth came back living in jesus there is power [Music] i'm beginning to see that it's the same god who's living in me yes the same god spoke to the woman at the world is the same god whose wonders too many to tell the same god who hearted the ranging [Music] [Applause] can we say amen tonight hallelujah aren't you glad it's the same god now just go back through your bible go look up every miracle every supernatural event every time that one that was lost and dying one that wasn't worthy one that was struggling you never find jesus christ condemned him he constantly offered you might say the olive branch to them to lift them up to encourage to strengthen i say tonight i might have spoke things it seemed like i was kind of chipping away at you tonight well i want you to know my heart is let's make sure we're placing values on the right things because you see my brother and sister tying into this and i shortened this all up because i wanted to be done by now prophet of god makes reference and ties this very thought right to the rich young ruler and said all god was trying to do was to give get him to give his all but he couldn't place the right value in the right place god help us saints i just want to stir your pure minds in remembrance hallelujah well soon and very soon we are going to see the king soon and very soon we are going to see the king well soon and very soon we are going to see the king hallelujah hallelujah we're going to see the kingdom be any rivers we must cross should there be any mountains we must climb god will supply all the strength that we need keep us safe till we reach the other side oh soon and very soon we are going to see the king yes soon and very soon we are going to see the king go soon and very soon we are going to see the king hallelujah hallelujah we're going to see the king they're going no dying there we are going to save [Music] [Applause] we are going to see the king [Music] [Applause] soon and very soon we are going to see the kingdom [Music] hallelujah there we are going to see the kingdom oh no more crying there we are going to see the king hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Applause] very soon we are going to see the kingdom soon and very soon we are going to see the king hallelujah hallelujah we're going to see the king well i'm going up in the first resurrection [Music] hallelujah resurrection yes i'm going up for you i'm going up well

yes i'm going up i'm can we just give him a little praise tonight oh hallelujah lord we love you hallelujah hallelujah you know saints if god lays something on the preacher's heart have enough grace to know that god loves you more than the preacher loves you and the preacher loves you with everything that's within him if the shoe fits please wear it god bless you you're dismissed so so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you
