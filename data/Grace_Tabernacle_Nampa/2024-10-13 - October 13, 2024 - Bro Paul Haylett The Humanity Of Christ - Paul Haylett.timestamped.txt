[36:16] to have a fellowship here at the church

[36:22] um that can all be sorted out I guess
[36:26] and um so have a little Fellowship here
[36:29] at the church following uh just uh
[36:32] remember the family in prayer you know
[36:35] brother Bob had a good long life uh got
[36:39] to see the mighty hand of God in his own
[36:42] life in his family uh but um in those
[36:46] places and people he rubs shoulders with
[36:49] uh but still it leaves a void amen and
[36:53] um every loved one that passes on
[36:56] brother sister leaves the void so let's
[36:59] just remember all of that amen well
[37:03] praise the Lord let's turn in our Bibles
[37:05] I want to speak to you this morning on
[37:07] the humanity of Christ and uh you know
[37:12] it uh often times if we're not careful
[37:16] we put we put the Lord so far out there
[37:20] that he actually becomes
[37:24] Untouchable and uh we lose lose the
[37:27] context of
[37:29] scripture when it says that he knows the
[37:31] feelings of our infirmities we we lose
[37:34] that context we we start thinking that
[37:37] it's just almost impersonal Satan would
[37:39] like to turn it into an impersonal God
[37:43] that we serve but he is very very
[37:45] personal and uh we can see that all
[37:48] through scripture how that that God uh
[37:51] is is personal enough that it actually
[37:54] scares mankind that's right God can be
[37:58] so personal that man just is like oh my
[38:01] what but remember why run from him he
[38:05] knows the thoughts and the intents of
[38:08] our hearts amen so we can run and hide
[38:12] and he still knows oh yeah and it didn't
[38:14] change a single thing in our life except
[38:17] for we did a lot of running that's right
[38:20] and and uh and Satan loves that Satan
[38:23] you know and it's even evident in the
[38:26] very nature of humanity the fight or
[38:29] flight and Satan wants us to always run
[38:34] he wants us to run away from problems
[38:37] run away from our reality oh did I say
[38:40] that out
[38:41] loud run away from our own
[38:46] reality that if I run far enough I
[38:49] somehow will leave it behind but I'm
[38:51] sorry it is who you are until you have a
[38:54] new birth that's exactly right and at
[38:56] the new birth amen we can stop turn
[38:59] around and fight amen say it no running
[39:04] no longer running Satan I finally
[39:06] recognize who I am in Jesus Christ and
[39:10] this is something worth fighting for
[39:14] hallelujah oh no not not that we're
[39:16] afraid to go to
[39:19] hell but for the joy of serving him amen
[39:22] for the joy of who we are in Jesus
[39:26] Christ am am amen let's turn in our
[39:28] Bibles amen the humanity of Christ let's
[39:31] turn in our Bibles to Hebrews the 5th
[39:33] chapter
[39:35] 8-14 and uh very
[39:38] common uh scripture for
[39:40] us amen sister suoth I forgot to thank
[39:44] you for the gifts but I appreciate that
[39:48] amen very much and uh God bless each one
[39:52] of you Hebrews 5 and 8 though he were
[39:57] son so his identity is already
[40:01] settled amen that's right identity is
[40:04] already
[40:07] settled yet he learned yet learned he
[40:11] obedience by the things which he
[40:13] suffered yes sir and being made perfect
[40:15] so he come through the suffering just
[40:17] fine and being made perfect he became
[40:20] the author of Eternal salvation unto all
[40:23] them that say Jesus Christ is is a
[40:31] savior see there's a problem we're
[40:33] running into in the world today how
[40:35] Satan has Twisted the
[40:37] word just having a conversation with a
[40:40] gentleman the other day and I make him
[40:42] nervous we're we're we've been friends
[40:44] since all the way back in school known
[40:47] this man for
[40:49] forever every time I get near him he
[40:52] always reminds me that religion is a
[40:54] very personal thing and you don't have
[40:55] to talk about it
[40:59] few days ago he looked me in the face
[41:00] and says now Paul I'm a
[41:02] Believer it was all I could do maybe I
[41:05] shouldn't have restrained myself but it
[41:07] was all I could do to keep from saying
[41:09] and the devil believes also that's
[41:12] right sir it takes obedience that's
[41:17] right the author of Eternal salvation to
[41:20] all them that obey him called of God a
[41:23] high priest after the order of MDC of
[41:26] whom we have many things to say and hard
[41:29] to be uttered seeing ye are dull of
[41:31] hearing you are now remember I I I'm not
[41:35] one to call back to things remember
[41:37] recent service here about hearing yes
[41:40] sir so many things are tied to our
[41:43] Hearing in the natural your hearing the
[41:47] loss of causes a fundamental erosion of
[41:50] the mind which they call
[41:53] Alzheimer's and
[41:56] Dementia it has to do with our
[41:58] balance so many things are tied in
[42:01] hearing
[42:03] natural but spiritual that's right
[42:05] absolutely
[42:07] right for when the time you ought to be
[42:10] teachers you have need that one teach
[42:12] you again which be the first principles
[42:15] of the Oracles of God and become such as
[42:19] have need of milk and not of strong meat
[42:22] for everyone that useth milk is
[42:24] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[42:27] for he is a babe but strong meat belong
[42:30] to them that are of full age amen are we
[42:33] of full age today Saints even those who
[42:36] by reason of use yes sir amen got to use
[42:39] it got to get out you got to fight you
[42:41] got to believe you got to confess that's
[42:43] right that's right yes sir have their
[42:47] senses exercised to discern both good
[42:50] and evil Heavenly Father we ask you to
[42:53] bless this time in the name of Jesus
[42:55] Christ amen you may be
[43:02] seated now if we would turn first Peter
[43:05] 2 21-
[43:11] 2 as we look at this Humanity of Christ
[43:14] I want to bring it down on a personal
[43:18] level of
[43:20] how oh you'd say yes of course God would
[43:23] understand us he created us but my
[43:25] brother and sister it's much deeper his
[43:27] understanding than we
[43:29] comprehend verse 21 for even here unto
[43:33] were you called because Christ also
[43:35] suffered for us leaving us an example
[43:39] that we should follow his steps now I
[43:42] would like to say wouldn't it seem like
[43:44] it would be so easy just simply to look
[43:47] down and say I'm going to follow these
[43:49] steps but how clever Satan is to put so
[43:53] many distractions in our lives so much
[43:56] he confused uses us we have times when
[44:00] people that we respect so much and view
[44:02] so much and and yet they seem to fail
[44:05] they seem to waver and and if we're not
[44:08] careful we start looking at them and not
[44:10] at Christ and just as it is you know we
[44:13] can walk out on the water my brother and
[44:15] sister do you realize walking out on the
[44:17] water is not nearly as complicated as we
[44:21] think it is if we could just look Beyond
[44:24] ourself as long as we look at self we'll
[44:27] never walk on water amen as long as we
[44:30] look at self we'll never rise into
[44:32] Heavenly places as long as we look at
[44:34] self we'll never attempt to climb out of
[44:36] our Valley but when we look Beyond
[44:38] ourself and look to Christ and Christ
[44:41] Alone we'll find that we can then uh
[44:44] take his example and we can take a holdz
[44:47] of that example and realize it's it's
[44:50] not being a Christians not for sissies
[44:53] in fact being Washed by the wave of the
[44:55] spirit of L de is the that's the
[44:59] weakling route is just to let go and
[45:02] wherever it takes me I'll go whatever it
[45:04] was meant to be was meant to be a good
[45:06] story Satan but that's not the story of
[45:09] a son or daughter of God a son or
[45:11] daughter of God was not meant to drift
[45:13] my brother and sister but they were
[45:15] meant to hold on be anchored in the Rock
[45:18] Amen and it takes strength to hold on to
[45:20] the rock it is not something that we do
[45:23] for a moment or a season of time but it
[45:26] is something something that you
[45:27] determined in your mind in your heart
[45:29] soul and your body that I'm going to
[45:31] hold on to the Rock and whatever storms
[45:34] may blow you'll say I'm still holding on
[45:37] and then you'll realize when the storm
[45:40] has passed it wasn't you your strength
[45:42] waned long ago but it was him holding
[45:45] you holding on Amen and when he's
[45:48] holding you amen you can stand this test
[45:51] of time amen that we should follow in
[45:55] his steps who did no sin
[45:57] neither was guile found in his mouth and
[46:00] I want to just not get sidetracked but
[46:02] my brother and sister the word of God he
[46:04] doesn't hold sin against our account so
[46:07] when you read this and you say well okay
[46:09] that was Jesus Christ he did know sin do
[46:12] you realize in God's eyes you did no sin
[46:17] that's right you fit in this scripture
[46:19] you are a part of this economy because
[46:22] God said no my blood has washed over
[46:24] them has washed them wider than and snow
[46:27] and I see nothing because I'm looking at
[46:30] them through the blood amen blood my
[46:33] brother and sister so I I want to use
[46:36] the word symbolic but it is so ingrained
[46:40] into the very uh plan of God that that
[46:44] blood more powerful amen more powerful
[46:47] my brother and sister than any one
[46:49] thing you know how deceiving Satan is
[46:53] I'll share this with you sister Jerry
[46:55] and I come across a little clip the
[46:56] other today this man is talking about
[46:59] how that they found a cave and in there
[47:01] they could see there was a stain and
[47:03] they scraped some of that and they went
[47:05] and tested the DNA have you guys seen
[47:08] this amen and they tested the DNA and in
[47:11] there was an unidentified DNA and they
[47:15] also found the DNA of
[47:21] Mary really oh people rejoicing they
[47:25] found God's de DNA they found the blood
[47:28] of Jesus Christ and the DNA of Mary and
[47:31] the DNA of God Amen here of Jesus Christ
[47:35] but my brother and sister there was not
[47:37] one part of that we understand by the
[47:40] word that was tied back to Mary God used
[47:43] her for an incubator and if Mary Rose up
[47:45] today like there are longing for her she
[47:48] would say you guys are deceived amen
[47:51] because this was not me and God this was
[47:56] God Alone alone amen so there's no way
[47:59] to take this DNA back to Mary Mary would
[48:03] deny it if she was here today but how
[48:06] clever they are to be able to tie the
[48:09] whole story together of
[48:12] maryom Amen it's a religion unto its own
[48:15] my brother and sister and if we're not
[48:17] careful we'll take it in the birth of
[48:19] the word are you with me in the birth of
[48:22] the word people will then say Oh yes
[48:25] this is of God but it's also got this
[48:28] with it no I'm sorry it's of God and of
[48:31] God Alone this is not a word that takes
[48:34] man to make it happen man is the subject
[48:37] the tool that God uses to manifest and
[48:40] bring his word to pass but you'll never
[48:42] get there and find that in that great
[48:45] book it'll be written that you and Jesus
[48:49] Christ it's Christ alone it's the word
[48:52] alone it's his life alone that brings
[48:55] life in US
[48:57] amen that's right and it's so easy how
[49:00] these things can be slid in
[49:03] there who did verse 22 who did no sin
[49:06] neither was guile found in his mouth who
[49:10] when he was
[49:12] reviled when I read this scripture my
[49:14] brother and
[49:15] sister verse
[49:18] 23 I don't want to use the word condemn
[49:21] cuz that wasn't it
[49:23] convicted this convicted my heart I
[49:26] still find in the right time in the
[49:28] right place I want to push back I want
[49:31] to react to this I want to let them know
[49:34] what is right and
[49:36] wrong who when he was reviled reviled
[49:40] not again Lord help us amen when he
[49:44] suffered he threatened not amen amen but
[49:49] committed himself to him that judgeth
[49:52] righteously
[49:54] amen we would like to think that we have
[49:58] good judgment Would we
[50:02] not and our judgment is so flawed we
[50:05] can't even recognize the
[50:07] flaw our judgment is so prejudiced or
[50:11] biased that we can't even recognize it
[50:15] you know you're pretty close to truth
[50:17] when you recognize you're wrong about
[50:18] the
[50:20] truth
[50:22] bet see because that's what the word was
[50:24] meant to do is to cause us to recogn
[50:28] where we were short
[50:31] amen who his own self bear our sins and
[50:34] his own body on the tree that we being
[50:38] dead to sins should live un
[50:40] righteousness by whose Stripes you are
[50:43] healed for you were a sheep going astray
[50:46] imagine
[50:47] that you know as I've shared with you
[50:49] Church before I still have occasional
[50:51] bouts of vertigo if you meet me on the
[50:54] highway you might want to pull off in
[50:56] McDonald whether you want to go there or
[50:57] not just till I'm
[51:00] passed but I I want to tell you and
[51:03] hopefully you can see this little
[51:06] analogy when you have
[51:09] vertigo you think you're walking a
[51:12] straight
[51:14] line but you're not
[51:19] amen and sometimes as you learn to
[51:21] recognize the natural symptoms I want to
[51:23] be healed of this amen amen
[51:27] yes I'm almost scared anymore to climb
[51:29] on top of Machinery cuz I can be
[51:31] standing up there 2 feet on solid metal
[51:35] and suddenly
[51:38] just that's not not a good feeling right
[51:42] but you see we're a sheep going astray
[51:45] and if we had a witness of those sheep
[51:47] they would say praise God we're on the
[51:49] straight and narrow way but they're
[51:51] actually going
[51:53] astray but are now returned and to the
[51:56] shepherd and the bishop of our souls
[51:59] where we once was drifting away God has
[52:03] come now often times people think that
[52:06] Christians are arrogant because the very
[52:08] fact that they would say God save me
[52:11] from The Wretched wreck of this world
[52:13] that I was am and they say well you're
[52:16] no different no that's true that's right
[52:19] I'm no different there's still this
[52:21] Humanity that's standing here it still
[52:24] has flaws it still has weaknesses but
[52:26] I'll tell you what it has that it never
[52:28] used to have is a desire in its soul to
[52:33] serve you Lord I'm going to stand on
[52:35] your word I want to go forward I want to
[52:37] walk the way you called me to walk and
[52:40] that didn't use to exist but it does now
[52:42] more each and every day more and more
[52:46] and more and that will be right there
[52:48] that one day I believe this just my own
[52:50] little personal glimpse of it that Enoch
[52:53] not the perfect man we think he was but
[52:56] he was perfect in his approach to God
[52:59] and one day I could see Enoch walking
[53:02] and he's there saying Lord I just want
[53:04] to please you and that next step was a
[53:07] little higher I want to serve you Lord
[53:10] that next step a little higher it wasn't
[53:12] some oh you're so perfect Enoch go now
[53:16] but he was there expressing a heart's
[53:18] desire of who I want to be Lord who you
[53:22] call me to be and who I will be amen
[53:27] amen cuz if we're only just hoping to
[53:30] achieve that's it you'll spend your
[53:32] whole lifetime hoping amen that's right
[53:35] but somewhere along the line the word
[53:37] says that you're going to speak your
[53:39] confession will become your
[53:43] identity that actually scares
[53:47] me even though it's wrote on chalkboard
[53:49] in our
[53:52] garage don't let anything negative
[53:56] you
[53:57] know are you any of you with me I'm not
[54:00] hopefully I'm not out on the plank off
[54:02] the pirate ship amen and we'll find
[54:05] ourselves speaking negative even though
[54:07] we know that that's not who we are and
[54:10] that's not what we want to accomplish
[54:11] and that's not what we've been anointed
[54:13] to do but Satan is so clever to get in
[54:16] there and he has broken the
[54:19] communication and what we know to
[54:23] do when I would do good
[54:27] evil right is
[54:29] present in the broken
[54:32] communication with
[54:34] me the heart
[54:36] says but the brain says that's it and
[54:41] then whichever one has preeminence at
[54:43] that moment
[54:46] that's that's right praise
[54:50] God
[54:51] Amen I'll tell you what I'm not afraid
[54:53] to admit today that I was a sheep going
[54:55] astray but I don't plan on staying
[54:57] astray and I don't want to be astray
[55:00] today I want to stand on the word
[55:02] because I was going astray but I'm no
[55:05] longer going astray because of the
[55:07] humanity of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[55:11] now humanity is a quality of being human
[55:15] now in the world we live in they say now
[55:16] that they have developed robots AI that
[55:20] are so realistic that at a reasonable
[55:22] distance or whatever you can't separate
[55:25] them from Humanity they make them look
[55:26] so and act so my brother and sister what
[55:30] they don't have is a soul that's right
[55:34] and no chip brother pant no grain of
[55:38] sand is ever going to give them a soul
[55:41] amen no conscience of the rights and the
[55:44] wrongs amen none of that can come
[55:46] because that was a gift of our creator
[55:48] that's right Hallelujah and now humanity
[55:51] is benevolent and kind and charitable
[55:54] now my brother and sister you look at
[55:55] this in the world today you'll find that
[55:58] that just watching a little on the
[56:00] street interview and and they said well
[56:04] are a Christian I used to be well why
[56:05] aren't you now well God is not the kind
[56:09] loving God that everybody says he
[56:11] is now I don't know backstory my brother
[56:14] and sister but I tell you what I have
[56:17] grieved I have grieved the Holy
[56:21] Spirit Come on can we say amen I have
[56:24] grieved the Holy Spirit and he was kind
[56:27] and he was compassionate and he was
[56:30] loving and he come back and brought me
[56:32] back into Fellowship not a God that
[56:35] casts me to the side not a God that says
[56:38] oh you failed one too many times you're
[56:40] done amen but a kind benevolent God Amen
[56:45] that is there one who loves us his grace
[56:49] is sufficient for our life and he was
[56:53] the author of your life that's it with
[56:56] some variable in there right permissible
[56:58] will that's right but let's not go to
[57:00] seat on permissible will God knew what
[57:02] our life would be he knew some would be
[57:05] drunks and prostitutes on streets he
[57:07] knew people would be murderers he knew
[57:10] what people would be and he said I'm
[57:12] going to save them anyhow I'm going to
[57:14] claim that Soul
[57:17] anyhow the devil would say it's so
[57:19] tarnished it's so black it's so whatever
[57:22] and God says hey I tell you what I got
[57:24] more than a three-step plan
[57:26] amen I've got a whole book that I wrote
[57:29] and I'm going to give them and they're
[57:31] going to be anointed to eat that book
[57:33] and when they eat the book it's going to
[57:34] be belly it's going to make their belly
[57:36] bitter to look back and say oh Lord what
[57:39] I did to grieve you but Lord I want more
[57:42] of the book give me more of your word
[57:45] amen amen that's he was kind he knew
[57:48] what we needed for
[57:50] restoration you know for some people as
[57:53] I've shared before met a brother back
[57:55] east had killed a
[57:57] man amen become a Christian in
[58:01] prison boy it just doesn't seem like
[58:03] that's a perfect
[58:05] recipe but it
[58:08] is it
[58:10] is amen a perfect recipe that's right
[58:13] cuz in that same prison God chose to let
[58:16] him out but in that same prison now
[58:18] there's dozens of Believers when's the
[58:20] last time we went into a Maximum
[58:22] Security Prison sat in the cafeteria and
[58:25] talk to people who killed people who did
[58:29] horrible things God knows what he's
[58:32] doing that's exactly
[58:35] right cuz I'm telling you there's no
[58:37] degrees of sin so what's the difference
[58:39] between you and a murderer that's
[58:41] exactly right
[58:44] yeah well people say the scripture says
[58:48] God wrote the scripture let him divinely
[58:50] interpret it yes sir amen cuz maybe I I
[58:54] I don't know if the Lord will have me
[58:55] preach this or not but I've just been
[58:57] mulling over a thought my brother and
[58:59] sister that maybe it's time for a
[59:02] changing of our
[59:05] thinking we've got it all boxed
[59:09] up but it might not be the same box that
[59:12] God's
[59:15] using I'll tell you what I would say
[59:17] thank you Lorden amen because you know
[59:20] I'll give us a little history lesson
[59:21] here amongst the
[59:23] Puritans they live so pious
[59:27] but history records that down inside
[59:29] they were full of
[59:32] anger because they were trapped in their
[59:35] own
[59:36] piety did I say that right
[59:40] yeah trapped within themselves of their
[59:43] own righteousness yeah that's it and the
[59:47] word says our righteousness is filthy
[59:51] rags imagine I would stand before you
[59:53] and tell you I'm so much more of a
[59:56] Christian than you and I would be
[59:58] presenting this and God would be looking
[1:00:00] down seeing a man in filthy rags why we
[1:00:05] see
[1:00:07] ourselves as this great
[1:00:10] overcoming almost
[1:00:15] sinless
[1:00:16] seething
[1:00:19] inside Lord help us amen Lord help us
[1:00:23] let me look through your lens Lord not
[1:00:25] mine right amen but God knew what we
[1:00:28] needed for restoration aren't you glad
[1:00:30] you know our brother da he he rest does
[1:00:33] restoration work on all kinds of of
[1:00:36] potteries and different things like that
[1:00:39] even a few paintings and and whatnot and
[1:00:42] and uh one day he was sharing with
[1:00:44] me to do uh
[1:00:49] restoration it it don't matter how good
[1:00:51] your paint is or how original your paint
[1:00:53] was or somehow you figured exactly what
[1:00:55] to do to make that just
[1:00:58] if we joked about this you turn Paul
[1:01:03] loose with this magnificent piece of
[1:01:05] pottery that's been
[1:01:07] broken what are you going to put it back
[1:01:09] together with well I'll tell you my
[1:01:10] brother and sister subf Flor adhesive
[1:01:13] will hook almost anything
[1:01:15] together but it won't restore that
[1:01:19] Pottery back to its
[1:01:22] original right right
[1:01:26] you know you can buy subfloor adhesive
[1:01:29] Home Depot big tubes
[1:01:31] $77.99 you imagine how much Pottery you
[1:01:33] can fix with that but it's not the right
[1:01:36] thing that's right so as we're trying to
[1:01:40] bring Restoration in the church through
[1:01:42] our own thinking through our own process
[1:01:45] through our own approach to things we
[1:01:48] just end up with a mess and it's all
[1:01:50] done it's glued together they don't
[1:01:53] smoke they don't drink they don't dance
[1:01:55] they don't do this they don't do that
[1:01:57] but it's not the perfect
[1:02:00] restoration God says I'll come and
[1:02:03] restore amen everything that's been
[1:02:06] eaten and taken away and everything
[1:02:09] that's been broken and everything I'll
[1:02:11] restore that will we let him do it his
[1:02:14] way or will we do it our way amen and
[1:02:17] when we do it our way we wonder why it
[1:02:19] never quite works
[1:02:21] out
[1:02:22] amen hallelujah our need for restor
[1:02:26] ation Can someone say thank you Lord for
[1:02:28] restoration of the word in our life amen
[1:02:31] not just to say I've got the word and
[1:02:34] this is what's correct but let the word
[1:02:36] be you that's it and when the word is
[1:02:39] you then you match the miror perfect
[1:02:41] image of the original amen
[1:02:47] amen it's not made possible by religion
[1:02:50] yes sir in fact sometimes I think
[1:02:52] religion actually makes it worse yes sir
[1:02:55] amen amen
[1:02:58] self-help Hallelujah I love self-help
[1:03:01] yes sir man I couldn't get it right the
[1:03:05] first time but now I read a book and
[1:03:07] it's going to be
[1:03:09] perfect no my brother and sister
[1:03:11] self-help is not an answer sir amen
[1:03:14] there's only one book that's got the
[1:03:16] answer in it but you got to have the
[1:03:18] Holy Ghost to even interpret this book
[1:03:21] correctly amen without the Holy Ghost it
[1:03:24] just becomes another book we read that
[1:03:26] is a form of selfhelp are that's exactly
[1:03:30] right
[1:03:32] amen yes sir and it won't make a
[1:03:35] difference if the pastor or the priest
[1:03:38] gives you
[1:03:40] Absolution you are forgiven cuz I said
[1:03:46] so the scripture says they're ravening
[1:03:48] wolves that's it there's only one way to
[1:03:51] fix it that's it that's through the word
[1:03:54] that's it through a restoration of a
[1:03:56] man's soul back to Jesus Christ amen to
[1:03:59] be able to look at the word and say you
[1:04:01] know what that's me that's it help me
[1:04:05] Lord forgive me Lord that's me David was
[1:04:10] in that position amen when it was spoken
[1:04:12] to him and it was there of the sheep and
[1:04:15] it was there and David passed righteous
[1:04:18] he was not in a righteous
[1:04:20] position but he passed righteous
[1:04:22] judgment amen and said that man ought to
[1:04:25] be and he told him that's you David and
[1:04:28] David didn't dig out books and say I'll
[1:04:30] prove to you that's not me I'm the king
[1:04:34] I'm above reproach I'm above this I've
[1:04:36] been a message Pastor I've been a
[1:04:38] Christian I've been no David said oh God
[1:04:41] forgive me amen because the word come
[1:04:45] right down to his soul and said you know
[1:04:47] what I I see I see that's what I've done
[1:04:51] I see that's who I am God forgive me
[1:04:55] that's right and God told David it's
[1:04:57] going to cost you David that's it but I
[1:05:00] forgive you that's it people get
[1:05:02] mistaken at the idea that they go out
[1:05:05] and sin
[1:05:06] willfully that it's just oh forgive me
[1:05:08] Lord and just march on no sir God this
[1:05:12] might not come out right so don't judge
[1:05:14] it by Paul's words but God will extract
[1:05:16] a price from your life amen Saul
[1:05:21] Paul man we don't know this for a fact
[1:05:23] cuz we couldn't dig into his mind
[1:05:26] but my brother and sister it seems to be
[1:05:28] very clear through history that Paul
[1:05:30] speaking of some of those Thorns they
[1:05:32] weren't all physical amen Paul would
[1:05:35] have relived some of those Saints yes
[1:05:38] sir that he had slain as he stood there
[1:05:41] and held their cloak imagine now a man
[1:05:44] committed to God at this stage of his
[1:05:47] life God using him as an oracle to speak
[1:05:49] the word and change lives and go to
[1:05:52] sleep at night and have images y yeah
[1:05:56] right that's it maybe he saw Steven's
[1:06:01] face Maybe Steven come every night not
[1:06:03] as a ghost not as a haunt but as a
[1:06:07] memory and Paul would say oh I have a
[1:06:11] thorn in this
[1:06:13] flesh did that stop him from being an
[1:06:16] oracle of God preaching the truth
[1:06:19] standing up laying it down straight that
[1:06:21] it could so strong and so straight it's
[1:06:24] lasted the ages amen that's pretty
[1:06:27] strong and that's pretty straight to
[1:06:28] last the ages my brother and sister but
[1:06:31] God still allowed Paul to have to deal
[1:06:33] with that that's it oh help us Lord
[1:06:38] amen you
[1:06:43] know I I
[1:06:45] actually have several books like
[1:06:49] this you
[1:06:51] know how to wire a house electrical how
[1:06:55] to wire a
[1:06:57] house I don't know why I ever you know
[1:06:59] forked over the five bucks to own a book
[1:07:01] that says how to wire a house I know how
[1:07:03] to wire a
[1:07:04] house
[1:07:06] amen but sometimes you know the
[1:07:09] feebleness of
[1:07:10] humanity just needs a reminder if Isaac
[1:07:14] was here brother Isaac was here he would
[1:07:17] say I know what you're talking about
[1:07:19] Paul because you know what's happened
[1:07:21] I've messed up wiring a three-way switch
[1:07:24] so many times
[1:07:26] that now my way of fixing a three-way
[1:07:28] switch Isaac come do this three-way
[1:07:32] switch I don't care it's in the book
[1:07:35] that's
[1:07:36] it I still sometimes get
[1:07:39] confused on the leg Yeah and which one
[1:07:43] comes to the ground and comes back
[1:07:45] and get it all wired
[1:07:52] up take a tester go over to the other
[1:07:55] box the little light comes
[1:07:58] on how can that light come on and the
[1:08:00] light that this little tester light
[1:08:03] comes on and the light
[1:08:05] doesn't amen but that's what we got for
[1:08:07] religion today that's it right yeah yeah
[1:08:10] the real light that we really are trying
[1:08:12] to get lit up doesn't come on but we
[1:08:15] have tested
[1:08:17] it but then when you get that right so
[1:08:21] now why
[1:08:22] didn't Why didn't
[1:08:26] well he did but he
[1:08:28] didn't why didn't God just give us a
[1:08:32] book and we
[1:08:37] can how to be a righteous
[1:08:40] man get up in the
[1:08:42] morning wash your hands three times make
[1:08:46] sure they're pure before you pick up the
[1:08:48] book and uh then read at least 32 verses
[1:08:56] short prayer Lord don't worry about the
[1:08:59] rest of the world today bless
[1:09:03] me why didn't he just give us something
[1:09:06] like
[1:09:07] that but every one of us pick up this
[1:09:10] book but I want to ask you a very
[1:09:13] straightforward question does it always
[1:09:21] speak come on there's parts of this book
[1:09:25] we would stumbled the rest of our life
[1:09:27] over what it
[1:09:28] meant the theologians and the wise men
[1:09:31] the wise and The Prudent are still
[1:09:33] stumbling why do you understand that's
[1:09:36] it because he said it's not just about
[1:09:39] giving you the book it's about making
[1:09:41] the book live in you that's it and when
[1:09:44] the book lives in you we can be of a
[1:09:47] lower IQ and I say that because that's
[1:09:49] kind of where I fall my brother and
[1:09:51] sister not no super smart person you can
[1:09:53] be of that lower etron of the IQ and it
[1:09:57] speaks to you and it's real and it's
[1:10:00] living and it's
[1:10:01] powerful amen but the wise and The
[1:10:05] Prudent are still going looking oh
[1:10:07] there's been another another
[1:10:10] dialect found in Northern Iraq we got to
[1:10:14] go learn it see if it applies to the
[1:10:18] word well why don't you just get
[1:10:20] Revelation that's it why don't you
[1:10:22] instead of spending time and all that
[1:10:24] brain wave why don't you just get close
[1:10:27] to God and let him show you what the
[1:10:30] book
[1:10:31] says hallelujah you know there's a
[1:10:33] difference in school some of you I know
[1:10:35] are very brilliant very smart God bless
[1:10:38] you for
[1:10:39] that some of
[1:10:42] us we got to put our hands on it right
[1:10:46] but once we've ever put our hands on it
[1:10:49] we can do it again and again and again
[1:10:53] and again amen
[1:10:56] had a person asked me one time this is
[1:10:58] actually even before we started putting
[1:10:59] GPS on tractors how do you make your row
[1:11:02] so straight brother
[1:11:03] Paul I made these rows so straight
[1:11:06] because of the million crooked rows I
[1:11:09] made before
[1:11:12] it and that's what God's doing in your
[1:11:15] life did he stop you red lights flashing
[1:11:19] someone running out in your life don't
[1:11:21] go there no God just let you go he let
[1:11:24] you make that mistake and then he
[1:11:27] inspired you out of his book to realize
[1:11:31] that's not what it's about that's right
[1:11:34] and brought us back but our next attempt
[1:11:36] might not been much
[1:11:39] better I know this isn't necessarily
[1:11:41] fitting but it's a good analogy when I
[1:11:43] was a young man first started
[1:11:46] farming I could start on the Square edge
[1:11:48] of a
[1:11:49] field and I had an edge to to drive down
[1:11:54] to put the first Rose in and by the time
[1:11:58] I got down there to about where sister
[1:12:00] Alice is at it looked like I was riding
[1:12:05] cursive no matter how I
[1:12:08] started but then now we're at the other
[1:12:11] end I'm not going to walk back there
[1:12:13] then as we come to the other end
[1:12:16] suddenly we have another
[1:12:18] reference and somehow the Crooked rows
[1:12:21] just start getting straighter and
[1:12:23] straighter until literally your last
[1:12:25] pass through the field would be back
[1:12:28] straight
[1:12:29] again but you would look in the middle
[1:12:32] and it' be like that's
[1:12:35] confusion but you see my brother and
[1:12:37] sister that's what God's doing with you
[1:12:39] and I don't go looking back in the
[1:12:41] middle of your field you look where God
[1:12:44] started in your life and you look where
[1:12:46] God is finishing in your life and he'll
[1:12:49] take care of everything we used to joke
[1:12:51] that there's more corn out there because
[1:12:53] the rows were longer
[1:12:57] but my brother and sister God is working
[1:12:59] we need to look to this Finish Line we
[1:13:01] don't need to look back to that midpoint
[1:13:03] of our life where we made mistakes I I
[1:13:06] know a a brother awesome wonderful
[1:13:08] brother amen when the more I got to know
[1:13:10] him he started telling me about all the
[1:13:12] false doctrine that he had got his
[1:13:14] family in and all the issue that had
[1:13:17] been there and I said well okay brother
[1:13:19] it was just inspiration the Lord
[1:13:20] speaking I said brother but where's your
[1:13:22] family now he said every one of my
[1:13:25] family is serving God Amen in truth
[1:13:27] today I said then don't look at the
[1:13:29] middle of that field don't look at it
[1:13:31] when you were 30 years old not really
[1:13:34] serving God like you should have been
[1:13:36] and your your you know son is is uh you
[1:13:39] know just
[1:13:40] following in Dad's
[1:13:43] footsteps right amen need need him
[1:13:47] following dad's footsteps now that's
[1:13:50] right amen
[1:13:52] right so what did he do he come he come
[1:13:56] right down to our
[1:13:58] level stepped right in there and said
[1:14:00] you know what I'm going to come and in
[1:14:02] fact I'm going to come in such a fashion
[1:14:04] that the world's going to call me
[1:14:06] illegitimate I'm going to lower myself
[1:14:08] so low that the identity associated with
[1:14:12] my name is
[1:14:16] illegitimate wow that's pretty low but
[1:14:20] I'll tell you pardon me I wouldn't want
[1:14:22] to offend anybody but he's come in this
[1:14:25] hour right here of what they said was
[1:14:28] illegitimate is proving to be God's work
[1:14:32] right amen it's not man's works it's not
[1:14:35] what kind of pedigree that we can put
[1:14:38] amen but it's whether the Life of Christ
[1:14:40] is in the man amen that's right amen and
[1:14:43] if the life is in the man it don't
[1:14:45] matter what he has where he's been who
[1:14:48] he knows cuz he knows him that's it
[1:14:51] that's right
[1:14:55] amen so what's he
[1:14:58] doing almighty God came down to our
[1:15:01] level to woo us to come to his that's it
[1:15:07] that's don't stay where you're at no let
[1:15:11] me show you amen where I came from amen
[1:15:15] that's where you belong that's
[1:15:18] right he wants to lift us up to his
[1:15:20] level amen Heavenly places in Christ
[1:15:23] Jesus many have been there amen I hope
[1:15:27] every hand in this building would go up
[1:15:29] that we could say I've been in Heavenly
[1:15:31] places I have had Jesus Christ standing
[1:15:34] right with me he's been with me in the
[1:15:37] morning the noon the evening the
[1:15:39] Midnight Hour he's with me I've been in
[1:15:42] his presence he's been here with me yes
[1:15:47] sir
[1:15:50] amen that's his level that's it where's
[1:15:54] our level
[1:15:56] I'll tell you what he'll take you places
[1:15:58] that legalism will never take you amen
[1:16:01] you can be a Pharisee you can stand and
[1:16:03] say I've done all of the law it did the
[1:16:05] Rich Young Ruler not one bit of good
[1:16:07] that he had followed everything
[1:16:09] perfectly his heart was not in it amen
[1:16:12] he was unable to press out of his own
[1:16:15] place his own position to press out of
[1:16:18] that and say I'll claim that out there
[1:16:20] it's the
[1:16:21] unknown amen it's the unknown my brother
[1:16:23] and sister amen until a man has ever
[1:16:26] been there amen look prayer line people
[1:16:31] coming you notice that they get to a
[1:16:34] certain place they didn't just walk
[1:16:36] right up they got to a certain place oh
[1:16:39] they were being respectful no there was
[1:16:42] a presence there it was unknown to them
[1:16:45] they were nervous about that
[1:16:52] presence it won't harm you that's right
[1:16:56] that's right come into that
[1:16:58] presence step Across the Threshold of
[1:17:00] your own life and your own
[1:17:02] inhibition it won't hurt you well I
[1:17:05] believe but I've never been in that
[1:17:07] presence then quit stopping amen keep
[1:17:10] walking and walk right into that
[1:17:13] presence there's nothing there saying
[1:17:14] don't come any
[1:17:16] closer he amen
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:21] legalism the
[1:17:23] law can ever take you there there
[1:17:26] no that's why we got to be real careful
[1:17:28] when the spirit of legalism starts to
[1:17:30] show up now you got to get this right
[1:17:33] you got to hit that Mark you got to hit
[1:17:34] this you got to hit that you got to hit
[1:17:36] that I I've told y all about this before
[1:17:38] and I hope you catch the analogy of it
[1:17:40] amen we went to Sun Lakes many years ago
[1:17:42] amen it was brother Jason's fault that I
[1:17:44] even got a hold of a golf club and went
[1:17:46] out there on the course with them you
[1:17:48] know kind of like you guys know brother
[1:17:50] Jason H not quite the way the story is
[1:17:53] but it's the way I like to tell it amen
[1:17:56] and brother Jason's like you know if
[1:17:57] you're not a chicken you you'll just get
[1:18:00] a hold to one of these and you'll do so
[1:18:01] I'm out there you know and these
[1:18:03] brothers some of them you know they they
[1:18:04] go all fairly regular pray for
[1:18:08] them but they're you know they're
[1:18:10] standing there and I'm like okay I was I
[1:18:12] said I'll be the last that's fine and
[1:18:14] these brothers some of them you know
[1:18:19] just wow another one big curve but it
[1:18:23] comes right back lands with in and
[1:18:25] here's
[1:18:27] Paul and they're all like Paul you're
[1:18:31] natural thank
[1:18:33] you until about the ninth hold brother
[1:18:37] Jason looks at me and
[1:18:39] goes you're going to break your wrist
[1:18:41] like that you are holding the club you
[1:18:42] got the wrong hand on the top and wrong
[1:18:44] one on the bottom and your wrist turned
[1:18:46] like that you're going to bust your
[1:18:47] wrist this is how you do it oh I want to
[1:18:50] do it right
[1:18:59] wait we already played the fourth
[1:19:03] hole and no matter how hard I tried to
[1:19:07] hit the ball
[1:19:09] correctly there way I hope you follow me
[1:19:14] their
[1:19:15] way finally we got down the last couple
[1:19:18] holes on the golf course and I said
[1:19:19] Brothers I'm rebelling I got a hold the
[1:19:21] club there said yeah you'll break your
[1:19:23] wrist that's what the every uh uh
[1:19:25] teacher whatever tell you you're going
[1:19:27] to break your wrist swinging like that
[1:19:28] and I said well it hasn't broken yet and
[1:19:31] I got a hold of that yeah you know wrong
[1:19:34] hand forward you know and the breaking
[1:19:36] of the wrist
[1:19:38] it the last two
[1:19:42] holes all the rest of their balls had
[1:19:44] drifted off a little bit mine went right
[1:19:49] down see this
[1:19:52] proves I'm right
[1:19:56] and you're
[1:19:58] wrong what did it prove
[1:20:03] nothing nothing because there comes a
[1:20:06] lesson when we serve God our way that
[1:20:08] you can't go any further
[1:20:12] amen the brothers one of them pointed it
[1:20:15] out to me I respect the brother he said
[1:20:16] brother Paul you have to realize you're
[1:20:18] hitting it all the way to the green but
[1:20:20] this is like a little mini course you
[1:20:23] know these these half the
[1:20:26] distance and you'll never hit it the
[1:20:29] full distance holding it like that
[1:20:32] because you can't put enough power in
[1:20:36] it you know what I
[1:20:39] did I gave up golf forever right at that
[1:20:44] moment and that's what happens when
[1:20:46] people can't come over find overcoming
[1:20:49] power because they're trying to move
[1:20:52] forward their own way
[1:20:56] and they won't wait and learn those that
[1:20:59] wait upon the Lord amen they won't wait
[1:21:03] they won't learn and they get to a
[1:21:05] certain point and they say you know what
[1:21:06] I just can't overcome this well quit
[1:21:08] doing it your way let God do it his way
[1:21:13] Hallelujah now I'm way off time here way
[1:21:16] off time amen so look at this let's look
[1:21:21] for just a moment let me hurry through
[1:21:23] this look for how he come down for you
[1:21:25] and I an eternal God now down at our
[1:21:30] level amen that in itself is incredible
[1:21:34] amen that an eternal God would care
[1:21:36] enough about you and I that he would
[1:21:38] leave the ramparts of heaven where all
[1:21:40] heaven and all Earth actually worshiped
[1:21:43] him and he would come down and SLO
[1:21:45] through the dust of Nazareth amen the
[1:21:47] road to emus and slog where animals had
[1:21:50] been you understand what I'm saying
[1:21:52] there's nothing pretty about this amen
[1:21:55] so he came to our level and what's even
[1:21:57] greater than that is he cares about your
[1:21:59] infirmity that's it the devil would like
[1:22:02] you to believe that well that's just how
[1:22:04] it is amen I'm telling you I'm sorry I
[1:22:06] don't want embarrass anybody but whether
[1:22:08] it's a struggle of the heart and of the
[1:22:10] mind my brother and sister it's just the
[1:22:13] word that fixes the problem amen it's
[1:22:17] not us we cannot do one people say well

[1:22:22] sister until you've been there you won't
[1:22:24] don't know the battle that's being faced
[1:22:26] and how in the human element it's
[1:22:28] impossible to change but when you ever
[1:22:31] get in the presence of almighty God Amen

[1:22:47] the word
[1:22:51] amen right here's Jesus bring
[1:22:55] Eternal truth extracting it is it okay
[1:22:59] amen extracting it out of the
[1:23:03] word and here's the
[1:23:05] apostles I'm a better preacher than you
[1:23:08] there's more hits on my sermons on the
[1:23:10] internet than yours amen I've been
[1:23:12] invited to more churches than you I I'm
[1:23:14] the greater of the
[1:23:20] Apostles really
[1:23:25] the King of Kings is over here
[1:23:28] extracting the gold of the word amen and
[1:23:32] we're here worried
[1:23:34] about who's the greater amongst us
[1:23:38] amen Lord help us amen all I can say is
[1:23:42] is Lord help us
[1:23:46] amen we're nothing but specs in the
[1:23:49] kingdom of God that's exactly right
[1:23:51] Hallelujah
[1:23:57] let's look for a moment just how he came
[1:23:58] to
[1:24:00] us
[1:24:02] so it's there
[1:24:04] that he come
[1:24:07] and this man that changed our lives
[1:24:10] Chang the
[1:24:12] world in John 4: 6 and
[1:24:18] 7 we know the scripture so well now
[1:24:21] Jacob's Well was there and Jesus there
[1:24:23] for being wearied with his journey set
[1:24:27] thus on the well and it was about the
[1:24:29] sixth hour and there cometh a woman of
[1:24:30] Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto
[1:24:34] her give me to
[1:24:37] drink your savior yeah come down so
[1:24:42] low he's
[1:24:44] weary and he's
[1:24:47] thirsty reminds me of my work
[1:24:51] day your work day yeah
[1:24:55] come down he said I'm going to be like
[1:24:57] you amen amen now let's jump CU I I kind
[1:25:01] of wasted it's not waste forgive me but
[1:25:04] I used time amen let's go to Matthew
[1:25:08] 4 now as we look at Matthew
[1:25:11] 4 here he is
[1:25:14] hungry then was Jesus led up the spirit
[1:25:17] to the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:25:19] devil but when he had fasted 40 days and
[1:25:22] 40 nights he was afterward hungry
[1:25:25] hunger now I I say this if you don't
[1:25:27] mind me putting a little
[1:25:29] humor this is a hard one for me because
[1:25:33] I'm hungry about every four
[1:25:36] hours forget 40 days and 40 nights just
[1:25:39] four
[1:25:42] hours but he went out
[1:25:45] there not to prove he could fast for 40
[1:25:49] days and 40
[1:25:51] nights he went out there to come back
[1:25:55] that
[1:25:56] I yes I'm going to be selfish here that
[1:26:00] I would
[1:26:03] realize it's not the
[1:26:06] natural it's not these things he fasted
[1:26:10] 40 days and 40 night and when the
[1:26:12] tempter come un him he said if thou be
[1:26:14] the Son of God command these Stones be
[1:26:17] made
[1:26:20] bread how many times in our I'm going to
[1:26:23] say
[1:26:25] frustrations have we misused the word of
[1:26:28] God misused the power of God misused the
[1:26:33] intent of God but here he is what's he
[1:26:38] doing he's showing us in a time of
[1:26:40] Hunger frustrations and whatever that's
[1:26:43] the time to go back to the word amen not
[1:26:46] to go to Natural not to look to Natural
[1:26:50] not to try and satisfy it with natural
[1:26:53] but he says the answer is it written man
[1:26:54] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:26:56] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:26:58] mouth of God but here again it shows our
[1:27:01] lord Jesus loved us so much amen that he
[1:27:05] suffered a
[1:27:07] hunger that we may never some of you may
[1:27:10] have but many of us will never fast 40
[1:27:13] days and 40
[1:27:15] nights now we come down here and this is
[1:27:18] a little bit uh of the same we're back
[1:27:22] into John 46 and 7
[1:27:24] and as we look at this my brother and
[1:27:27] sister uh it's there that we'll see in
[1:27:30] John 46 and 7 same as it was there about
[1:27:32] being weary uh being thirsty we see John
[1:27:36] 19 and
[1:27:38] 28-30 and Jesus knowing that all things
[1:27:42] now now I want you to catch a
[1:27:43] correlation between these two uh and
[1:27:46] Jesus knowing that all things were now
[1:27:48] accomplished that the scripture might be
[1:27:49] fulfilled said I
[1:27:52] thirst The Thirst he experienced on the
[1:27:57] cross let's just look at it for natural
[1:27:59] for a moment so much more
[1:28:03] severe than even the thirst after
[1:28:06] traveling and is sitting there at the
[1:28:10] well I
[1:28:16] thirst I hope you catch
[1:28:20] this we got to
[1:28:22] separate natural
[1:28:26] I'm not talking about just a glass of
[1:28:27] water no that's right we got to separate
[1:28:30] natural amen from a thirst of the Soul
[1:28:34] that's right amen and when the soul is
[1:28:36] thirsting don't satisfy it with
[1:28:38] something else that's exactly let it be
[1:28:41] satisfied by the presence of almighty
[1:28:44] God and I tell you I'm one of those guys
[1:28:47] forgive me but there's times I have
[1:28:51] tried to satisfy natural I mean spirit
[1:28:54] spiritual with natural that's right
[1:28:56] H right amen
[1:28:59] amen I'm not ashamed to admit it no now
[1:29:04] we go to Matthew 4
[1:29:07] 1-3 and
[1:29:10] so here again my brother and sister this
[1:29:14] is not about thirst or hunger about
[1:29:18] Temptation that's right so these kind of
[1:29:21] all tied together just
[1:29:27] Temptation the
[1:29:30] devil knows you better than you know
[1:29:35] yourself
[1:29:39] am imagine how awkward it
[1:29:42] be if each one of you in appropriate
[1:29:45] fashion I just followed you around all
[1:29:47] the
[1:29:49] time until I had your life categorized

[1:34:20] whosoever will save his life shall lose
[1:34:22] it and whosoever will lose his life from
[1:34:23] for my sake shall find it for what is a
[1:34:26] man profited if he should gain the whole
[1:34:28] world and lose his own soul or what
[1:34:30] shall a man give in exchange for his
[1:34:32] soul for the son of man shall come in

[1:34:49] amen now my brother and sister you say
[1:34:51] what's that scripture got to do with
[1:34:52] suffering because if you truly die to
[1:34:55] yourself to serve the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:59] you are going to suffer
[1:35:04] amen is this suffering worth the gain
[1:35:07] you bet
[1:35:09] yes or would we
[1:35:11] rather have a
[1:35:13] more pacifistic
[1:35:17] religion devil if you don't fight me I
[1:35:21] won't fight you you can make that
[1:35:26] compromise and obedience we talked about
[1:35:28] this in young adults this
[1:35:31] morning Hebrews
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:35] 58-14 though he were a son yet he
[1:35:37] learned obedience by the things which he
[1:35:41] suffered how are you going to learn
[1:35:45] obedience
[1:35:47] reading a self-help
[1:35:51] book no sir
[1:35:54] no my brother and sister no
[1:35:57] it it
[1:36:00] takes obedience
[1:36:03] amen and being made perfect it became
[1:36:05] the author of The Eternal salvation to
[1:36:07] all them that here again acknowledge he
[1:36:10] exists no obey
[1:36:14] him amen called of God and high priest
[1:36:16] after the order of mzd of whom we have
[1:36:19] many things to say and hard to be
[1:36:20] uttered saying you're all dull hearing
[1:36:24] wow my my brother and sister you could
[1:36:27] offend so many people in so many
[1:36:29] churches you're dull you can't hear a
[1:36:33] thing but what forget about what man
[1:36:35] would say what does the word say that's
[1:36:37] right the word says they're Dole of
[1:36:41] hearing and sometimes we are too I want
[1:36:44] to balance that for when the time you
[1:36:46] ought to be teachers you have need for
[1:36:48] one to teach you again what be the first
[1:36:50] principles of the Oracles of God and
[1:36:53] have become such as we have need of milk
[1:36:56] and not of strong meat come on let's
[1:36:59] take it back to the Natural for a minute
[1:37:01] you go into a restaurant you order a
[1:37:03] nice big old
[1:37:04] steak who's my guinea pig Titus front
[1:37:08] row ready volunteered front ranks always
[1:37:12] r at the front of the charge into the
[1:37:14] enemy that's the guys who sit at the
[1:37:16] front so we all I know there's only so
[1:37:18] many seats on the front row but if you
[1:37:21] really want to show everybody who you
[1:37:22] are you get on the front front row and
[1:37:23] tell him I'll be the first in the battle
[1:37:26] anyway imagine brother Titus and I go to
[1:37:28] a restaurant brother Titus I know he
[1:37:30] doesn't really like steak but um it just
[1:37:34] yeah so but um he orders a steak the
[1:37:38] waitress says how do you want this he
[1:37:40] says I want it just like this this and
[1:37:43] this do you want mushrooms yeah go ahead
[1:37:45] and put some mushrooms on it how do you
[1:37:47] want that okay about 15 minutes later 20
[1:37:51] minutes later waitress comes with this
[1:37:53] gigantic glass of
[1:37:58] milk walks
[1:38:01] away uh I didn't order
[1:38:04] that oh sir the reason you got that is
[1:38:07] we determined that you're not mature
[1:38:11] enough to eat that
[1:38:13] steak you imagine how In the Flesh that
[1:38:17] people would be so offended oh yes they
[1:38:20] would be
[1:38:22] livid how dare you determine I'm not
[1:38:25] mature enough to eat that
[1:38:28] steak do you realize down in many hearts
[1:38:32] they're exactly the same way when it
[1:38:35] comes to that spiritual meat right I've
[1:38:39] been a Christian for 40 years how dare
[1:38:41] you say that this steak this meat is too
[1:38:45] much for
[1:38:47] me but when it's not the preacher
[1:38:50] judging it's God judging
[1:38:54] God says no you're not mature enough to
[1:38:56] handle
[1:38:57] this you're an immature Christian I
[1:38:59] don't care how many years you've went to
[1:39:01] church how many plaques you got for
[1:39:03] perfect attendance how many committees
[1:39:06] and boards and councils that you have
[1:39:08] set on you're immature that's right and
[1:39:12] it's there by the display of behavior
[1:39:14] yes sir the
[1:39:17] immaturity but you see my brother and
[1:39:19] sister you take the bride of Christ amen
[1:39:23] she has got that eagle anointing amen
[1:39:27] amen and she will dig in and she will
[1:39:31] fight for it amen hallelujah now I hope
[1:39:34] you don't mind I need to kind of skip
[1:39:36] over a couple other things here just a
[1:39:38] few more quotes and a few more
[1:39:45] scriptures seven Church
[1:39:48] ages brother Brown says here a quick
[1:39:50] look of these scriptures involve the
[1:39:52] Lord Jesus Christ overcoming will bring
[1:39:54] out the truth of this proposition
[1:39:57] Matthew 4 wherein Jesus was tempted of
[1:39:59] the devil to overcome personal
[1:40:01] Temptation Of Satan by the word and by
[1:40:04] the word only amen right that's right
[1:40:06] back to the scripture right he didn't go
[1:40:08] quoting something else out of somebody
[1:40:09] else's book he took him back to the word
[1:40:12] amen in each of the three major trials
[1:40:15] that corresponded exactly with the to
[1:40:17] the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the
[1:40:19] lust of the flesh the lust of the eye
[1:40:21] and pride of life Jesus overcome by the
[1:40:23] word eve fell to uh to the personal
[1:40:27] Temptation Of Satan by failing to use
[1:40:29] the word Adam fail in direct
[1:40:31] Disobedience to the word but Jesus
[1:40:35] overcame by the word and right now let
[1:40:38] me say this is the only way to be an
[1:40:42] overcomer also it's the only way that
[1:40:44] you can know if you are overcoming
[1:40:47] because the word Can't Fail amen amen
[1:40:52] what an assurance it's not going to be
[1:40:53] based on my pastor told me you know uh
[1:40:57] you know depart from me but my pastor
[1:41:00] said no my brother and sister when you
[1:41:02] put it back to the word and it's the
[1:41:04] word that gives direction to your life
[1:41:07] amen amen
[1:41:09] hallelujah now notice again how Jesus
[1:41:12] overcame the world's system of religion
[1:41:14] when he was repeatedly badgered by the
[1:41:16] theologians of his day he constantly
[1:41:18] applied the word he spake only what the
[1:41:20] father gave him to speak there was not a
[1:41:23] Time time when the world was not utterly
[1:41:25] confused by his wisdom for it was the
[1:41:27] wisdom of God Amen now you look at this
[1:41:31] this is where God sent Jesus Christ down
[1:41:35] for you and I in such a fashion that
[1:41:38] instead of just telling us it can be
[1:41:40] done he showed us
[1:41:43] how that's what's important that we
[1:41:47] actually now know how amen now I don't
[1:41:50] want to Badger you I don't want to bully
[1:41:52] you I don't want to be but my brother
[1:41:53] and sister don't go whining if you don't
[1:41:56] have God in your life that's it he has
[1:42:00] showed you amen it's here it's in his
[1:42:03] word amen if the devil is beating you up
[1:42:08] now I know we're all Christians here so
[1:42:10] the devil never beats any of us
[1:42:12] up except for this
[1:42:15] morning and maybe by this afternoon come
[1:42:19] on let's be realistic let's be
[1:42:21] realistic I'm glad that spiritual black
[1:42:24] eyes don't show up because I'd sure hate
[1:42:26] to stand up here and preach to you and
[1:42:28] everybody be like wow Paul's got
[1:42:31] shiners my brother and sister but what
[1:42:34] happens this is part of the whole
[1:42:36] process going
[1:42:38] back God allows you you know as it is
[1:42:42] the boxer the guy there you know and
[1:42:44] they're doing their things have you ever
[1:42:47] boxed I have okay I don't want to use
[1:42:50] you because I don't want a shiner
[1:42:53] brother Andrew you ever
