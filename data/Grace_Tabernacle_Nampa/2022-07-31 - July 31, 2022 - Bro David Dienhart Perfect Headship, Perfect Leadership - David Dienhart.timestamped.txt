[18:29] chris if you'd come

[18:34] this morning she asked that she
[18:36] just lift her up she doesn't know when
[18:37] she'll be able to come back to service
[18:39] because of dan
[18:40] being down and now so she's been looking
[18:42] after him and he has a consult coming up
[18:45] next week with a surgeon to deal with
[18:47] his back issues so we want to lift
[18:49] him up in prayer
[18:51] and then sister sue if you're listening
[18:53] right now
[18:54] i just had this thought crossed my turn
[18:56] on the prayer lines
[18:57] listen to the prayer lines
[18:59] amen i believe in
[19:01] dan's healing not only in his healing
[19:03] but i believe
[19:04] god will restore him so amen this may be
[19:06] just a knock on the door
[19:09] i'm just gonna be bold like our pastor
[19:10] just as we get older we get bolder
[19:13] so we're just gonna claim brother dan
[19:15] amen his healing and also lord would
[19:17] just touch his heart
[19:19] we want to remember sister miriam
[19:21] dean hart this morning she's not feeling
[19:23] well she just needs a touch on her body
[19:25] and let's just lift her up in prayer and
[19:27] if you have any needs on your heart
[19:29] raise your hands or heavenly father
[19:31] brother chris if you come

[19:42] to believe it to come to pass let's bow
[19:44] our heads
[19:46] heavenly father lord jesus
[19:48] lord and you were here lord jesus you
[19:51] imparted to the people
[19:53] that they would ask

[19:56] seek they would find
[19:59] lord that first step in faith lord jesus

[20:03] because it shows that we trust you lord
[20:05] we have faith that lord you are a god
[20:07] who who answers prayer lord we don't put
[20:09] requests to be known of others but we
[20:12] put these requests forward because you

[21:52] note here then i'll ask for the paul to
[21:54] come just wanted to thank everybody for
[21:55] last sunday i forgot wait a sunday so
[21:58] everybody was here but thank you i know
[22:00] my wife and i were pleasantly surprised
[22:03] and
[22:04] it's not really hard to surprise my wife
[22:06] especially she has those woman
[22:08] intuitions
[22:09] and so we want to say thank you it was
[22:12] really is really special and
[22:14] and uh
[22:15] i was given a new binder i haven't used
[22:17] yet
[22:18] because i haven't
[22:20] finished collecting all the songs we
[22:22] were cleaning up the song book so as
[22:23] soon as that done
[22:24] is done you're going to see me with a
[22:26] fancy new binder
[22:28] so just i can't remember who who gave
[22:30] that
[22:32] that's alice it was alice
[22:34] okay well alice you just wait
[22:38] i thought it was i was like wow this is
[22:39] really cool it has my name on it's all
[22:41] bold letters and
[22:43] song leader song book so i'm looking
[22:45] forward to be able to use it because
[22:46] this one is literally falling apart
[22:49] so i don't think that i can't remember
[22:50] the last time i even changed this so
[22:52] brother paul why don't you come so again
[22:54] i just wanted to say thank you for my
[22:55] wife and i it was it was it was really
[22:57] special
[23:06] isn't it nice to go to a church that we
[23:08] can just be human
[23:10] yeah
[23:11] not too human
[23:13] but human enough just to enjoy life
[23:16] well i think most of you would have saw
[23:19] uh
[23:20] on the
[23:21] church whatsapp that brother yannick
[23:24] sister sharon
[23:25] and now have a beautiful little addition
[23:27] to their family and uh
[23:30] you know he kind of looked trust up with
[23:32] some extra hardware there in the picture
[23:34] but
[23:35] i'm sure that when that's all taken away
[23:37] he's going to just be a really handsome
[23:39] little guy
[23:41] marian neville amen so
[23:44] just
[23:45] looking forward to seeing
[23:47] that little guy see them in church amen
[23:52] sister april has uh
[23:55] just
[23:56] shared with us that
[23:58] she will be in town the end of this
[24:01] coming week as she has to meet a moving
[24:03] van imagine i think that's commitment
[24:06] and
[24:07] anyway i don't know that she will want
[24:09] or need help but i just want to lay this
[24:11] out before you that
[24:14] maybe you could just put that in the
[24:15] corner of your mind that if she needs
[24:17] some help that we could just show her a
[24:20] warm welcome to our assembly
[24:22] and uh offer a little bit of help and
[24:27] you know any commitment that big the
[24:29] devil's gonna fight so she just has a
[24:31] couple situations that she needs the
[24:33] lord to just come and intervene in
[24:35] and one of those is the selling of her
[24:38] home and she's already had
[24:40] people who commit and then back out so
[24:43] we just want to lift her up in prayer
[24:47] to
[24:48] be able to sell her house
[24:50] and
[24:52] so
[24:54] just
[24:56] i reference it this way i think you
[24:58] would understand brother sergey senior
[25:00] which in my little vocabulary is sister
[25:03] yulia's dad
[25:07] shared with me this morning
[25:09] and a need and i was communicating with
[25:13] our sergey
[25:14] which is how
[25:16] i often view
[25:18] brother sergey as our sergey
[25:21] community property sister yulia
[25:25] but anyway i was just communicating with
[25:27] brother sergey today and and he was
[25:30] sharing with me the sunrise on highway
[25:33] 30 in wyoming was beautiful this morning
[25:36] and uh
[25:37] it
[25:38] if you understand our brother you know
[25:40] that means it's pedal to the metal
[25:42] towards home
[25:43] and uh but um there's a need a a
[25:47] brother vladimir
[25:50] ivano ivanov
[25:53] ivano
[25:55] they lived in the city of mariopol and
[25:59] at this point in time
[26:02] to his knowledge their house has
[26:04] actually been completely destroyed all
[26:05] their possessions everything has been
[26:07] destroyed
[26:09] they have fled
[26:10] and this is part of the dynamics that
[26:13] only those people who live there and
[26:15] understand those things that works for
[26:17] me because they have fled to russia
[26:20] and of all things you would think they
[26:21] would be fleeing somewhere else but
[26:23] there is a connection in culture and all
[26:26] of that there that that would be hard to
[26:29] for me especially to explain
[26:32] but they have
[26:34] left the city and they fled and i had
[26:37] the name of the little town in russia
[26:38] but that was irrelevant and they're
[26:41] definitely in a tight position
[26:44] so
[26:45] while
[26:46] money will solve things right but um
[26:50] let's lift them up in prayer they're not
[26:52] the only families not the only believers
[26:54] that are experiencing this kind of
[26:56] turmoil where they're being uprooted and
[26:59] going somewhere else and finding it very
[27:02] difficult to reestablish
[27:05] he shared that the brother has a job he
[27:08] makes 500 dollars a month and rent a
[27:11] loan no utilities nothing new no food
[27:14] nothing else but rent alone takes 320 of
[27:17] the 500 dollars
[27:19] so um we just definitely want to lift
[27:21] them up in prayer
[27:23] and uh we are
[27:25] we don't want to jump the gun but we are
[27:27] we're working in a process with our our
[27:30] brothers to see what we can do
[27:32] what is the best avenue to help them so
[27:35] our first avenue is prayer
[27:38] and so let's just remember all of them
[27:40] today
[27:42] and uh just that god would be able to
[27:46] give an answer to the saints that are
[27:48] there in that turmoil and as the brother
[27:51] worded it in his letter
[27:53] he is used to
[27:55] uh being the one
[27:57] according to the scripture it's better
[28:00] to give than to receive and
[28:02] but he said it's very difficult for him
[28:04] to come into a situation to say can
[28:06] someone please help us
[28:08] so
[28:09] amen our prayers do we believe this this
[28:12] morning our prayers move mountains
[28:15] and so let's start with that first
[28:17] mountain with prayer and let god open
[28:20] all the doors that is necessary for the
[28:23] believers for the saints in ukraine
[28:25] russia
[28:26] on their behalf uh we just want to lift
[28:29] that now i want to take just a moment uh
[28:32] here i have the little um
[28:35] sunday school
[28:36] volunteer sheet and
[28:38] i think this is wonderful
[28:40] uh some of the names on here
[28:43] i think probably forgot that they are in
[28:45] sunday school
[28:47] so they wanted to help they want to
[28:49] volunteer they want to do something good
[28:52] but we want to kind of keep this all in
[28:55] perspective
[28:56] that
[28:58] we're not going to let you skip your
[28:59] sunday school class to help another
[29:02] and especially to help the the babies to
[29:05] hold the babies so
[29:07] each one of you i'll put this sheet back
[29:09] up but we are going to be moving forward
[29:13] uh to come back into sunday school i
[29:15] take full responsibility for a lot of
[29:18] this gap in time
[29:19] but we are we're moving forward to do
[29:22] this
[29:23] and i would just ask that those that
[29:26] were teachers last year
[29:28] if you or
[29:30] two years ago
[29:32] three years ago
[29:35] well we'll move on quickly from that
[29:39] those of you that were teachers in the
[29:41] past
[29:42] i would like a personal yes or no
[29:45] of whether you want to teach again
[29:48] and then we'll move forward
[29:51] to those
[29:52] that have
[29:53] offered to help
[29:55] and to do that we want to just kind of
[29:57] get this as it were
[29:59] from the top down
[30:01] to establish the teachers first
[30:03] and then to be able to
[30:06] help maybe give some of the young
[30:08] younger people young people a chance to
[30:12] you know step up and be a helper
[30:14] as it were because that's a lesson that
[30:16] is good for us all to learn to be able
[30:19] to be servants to one another
[30:21] and
[30:22] so i would like to hear
[30:24] uh from from the previous teachers
[30:28] uh whether you feel led to be a part of
[30:31] that
[30:32] there's something else that's also in
[30:34] the works but i want to get sunday
[30:36] school established before we step into
[30:38] the next phase
[30:39] so if you all just lift us up in prayer
[30:42] and just help us
[30:44] sometimes it's it's difficult we get
[30:46] busy in life and
[30:49] you know you want things to just be
[30:50] perfect and absolutely ready and
[30:53] everything so you delay delay and
[30:55] nothing really changed so we're just
[30:57] going to go forward now and work on
[31:00] getting everything in the perfect order
[31:02] as we go
[31:03] so um
[31:04] once again those that were teachers in
[31:06] the past please give me a definite yes
[31:09] or no
[31:10] and i'm going to be kind of like the
[31:12] little kids viewed their parents
[31:14] and maybe
[31:16] means no
[31:18] so
[31:19] i'm looking for a definite yes or no and
[31:22] uh
[31:23] that way we can start leaning on others
[31:27] uh maybe strong-owning different people
[31:32] pushing twisting
[31:34] coercing what are all the words that go
[31:36] with that
[31:38] so we can get re-established back in
[31:39] sunday school for the sake of our
[31:41] children
[31:42] so i love you all and god bless you and
[31:46] so
[31:47] just just remember this family there in
[31:50] russia
[31:51] and
[31:52] let's dive into the word this morning
[31:54] amen god bless you
[32:00] amen

[34:12] why do you love the lord
[34:16] because he first loved you
[34:20] that's a great revelation
[34:22] i pray that god be quickened every
[34:23] individual that's
[34:25] here this morning
[34:27] that you realize christ loved you
[34:31] the only way that you could love him is
[34:32] that he first loved you and if he first
[34:34] loved you what do you have to fear
[34:38] because nothing shall be able to
[34:40] separate you from his love
[34:43] amen nothing
[34:45] nothing present nothing future nothing
[34:48] past
[34:50] above below
[34:53] anything
[34:55] is able to separate you from his love
[34:59] but we need to come to that rest and
[35:00] that peace that
[35:03] here it is love
[35:06] where is it it's in a body form
[35:10] amen christ himself is our love
[35:13] that's love
[35:14] where is it today in bride form
[35:17] same christ
[35:19] same one
[35:21] hallelujah
[35:22] amen thank you brother sister god bless
[35:25] you appreciate the songs this morning
[35:26] the
[35:27] leadership of the song i
[35:30] just exactly
[35:32] told brother jason i said no question it
[35:34] was in prayer actually i said lord i
[35:36] know you've laid on his heart what's
[35:37] needful here
[35:39] and it just certainly has gone along
[35:40] with this
[35:42] brother vladimir i think was a pastor
[35:46] in
[35:48] mary opal
[35:49] and i was in his home
[35:52] and ministered in his house in that
[35:54] little assembly there so
[35:56] i certainly
[35:58] am happy
[36:00] that the lord has got him out of there
[36:04] and he has his hand on him
[36:06] and we are praying and holding him up in
[36:08] prayer because prayer changes things
[36:12] amen
[36:15] this morning what's on my heart
[36:17] i pray that
[36:20] god would give us grace
[36:22] because it may appear a little scratchy
[36:26] but something that's been laid upon my
[36:27] heart you know a minister really
[36:30] needs to receive it first before he
[36:31] presents it to an assembly
[36:34] and what i'm speaking this morning
[36:36] appeal or reply excuse me to me also
[36:41] i'm a part of your body i'm a part of
[36:43] this assembly
[36:46] but it won't leave the word
[36:48] but i pray that it'll be received as
[36:50] such as it will be light
[36:52] upon your pathway
[36:55] how many is willing to receive
[36:56] correction from the lord
[36:58] i am too
[36:59] in fact that's what i desire every day
[37:01] the bible says we would receive it
[37:04] if we
[37:05] any little thing if you're born again
[37:07] the prophet said any little thing that's
[37:08] wrong he'll show you
[37:12] questions and answers 1964 he said he'll
[37:14] show you
[37:15] he'll reveal it
[37:17] so i pray that you would just give me
[37:19] the grace and liberty as a minister of
[37:21] the gospel to preach it's on my heart
[37:23] because i do not believe it's my
[37:24] thinking
[37:26] i believe this is what he wants
[37:28] and so
[37:30] i will have to stand someday before all
[37:32] of us
[37:33] here
[37:34] and give answer for what i said
[37:37] you believe that
[37:38] i do too
[37:40] and that makes me tremble
[37:42] because i must be certain
[37:44] and every minister should be certain
[37:46] that what they're bringing is with the
[37:48] word does not deviate we don't have a
[37:51] right to put our own thinking in
[37:52] anything
[37:54] of god's word
[37:56] let god
[37:58] bring forth what he wants we are just
[38:00] servants who's greater the servant or
[38:02] the one the servant serves
[38:07] the greater is the one he serves
[38:10] so don't look at the ministers being
[38:12] anything special
[38:13] you're the special
[38:16] but together we're part of him
[38:19] we're special in his sight
[38:21] amen
[38:22] amen let's bow our heads for a word of
[38:24] prayer and why don't we stand
[38:26] in honor of his presence
[38:28] you're in the presence of the king
[38:32] i believe that with all my heart i pray
[38:34] that each one of us would become so
[38:36] aware of that
[38:38] every day moment by moment daily living
[38:40] that we are in the present you are in
[38:42] the presence of the king
[38:44] amen heavenly father our father
[38:48] we're so glad that we can say our father
[38:53] because you're the head of this
[38:55] body of believers worldwide
[38:58] you're the head and lord there's nothing
[39:01] even can happen as your prophet said but
[39:03] what you have allowed it
[39:06] you're in control of your bride
[39:09] you're in control absolutely divine
[39:12] control over her and lord we get
[39:15] sidetracked many times because the devil
[39:17] in his sinus and subtleness will try to
[39:20] sidetrack us we're fighting a great
[39:22] battle a mighty battle the greatest
[39:24] battle ever fought every day
[39:28] but moment by moment daily lord your
[39:30] mercies we see from your word and
[39:32] showing us what our authority is
[39:35] in you
[39:37] and lord we thank you for this reality
[39:40] in revelation and lord your word and i
[39:44] pray that it'll be that way this morning
[39:45] your word will be a lamp unto our feet
[39:49] and a light to our pathway
[39:51] and i pray that we go out of here
[39:53] rejoicing over the fact that you love us
[39:56] so much
[39:58] you would make yourself known to us
[40:00] individually
[40:02] and reveal yourself to us
[40:04] we pray for further revelation you said
[40:06] the greatest thing that we could ask for
[40:07] was revelation of the word and it cannot
[40:10] be overemphasized the need of it
[40:13] and so god we pray that you would reveal
[40:15] your word bless your word
[40:18] and move me out of the way the lord the
[40:20] man is not seen
[40:22] but your voice is heard
[40:25] and that you are seen
[40:27] we pray for thy glory
[40:30] in jesus christ's name we ask these
[40:32] things
[40:33] amen
[40:34] amen
[40:35] i'd like you to turn with me to genesis
[40:37] chapter two i have three scriptures
[40:39] while you're standing
[40:40] i have many scriptures this morning
[40:43] and i want to take and i want to be very
[40:45] sensitive to the holy spirit here
[40:48] on what we bring
[40:50] to the people
[40:52] our steps are ordered do you believe
[40:53] that
[40:54] nothing happens by chance to a believer
[40:57] it's all ordained of god to a christian
[40:59] brother brahms and we know a christian
[41:00] is not just a term lightly used a
[41:04] christian by definition is one
[41:06] tabernacling deity
[41:08] it's actually christian means
[41:10] christ-like
[41:12] amen and so that's what we are here to
[41:15] bear that's what we're here to fulfill
[41:18] because we know the son of man is
[41:20] revealed again in our day it's back to
[41:23] wheat time it's back to seed time
[41:25] amen it's back to the himself again
[41:28] among us amen
[41:30] but it's the form that stumbles people
[41:32] so many times is the form we come in
[41:35] amen but it's the same person
[41:38] we have lights go out i don't know what
[41:39] lights went out anyway
[41:41] all right
[41:42] i think you still well you can still see
[41:44] me and i still see you so it's all that
[41:46] matters i've ministered sometime when
[41:49] the lights went out completely in the
[41:50] dark continued right on the lights come
[41:53] back on the devil just couldn't stand it
[41:55] he doesn't like the light so
[41:59] we know that has a better meeting than
[42:01] just human light i mean
[42:03] electric
[42:05] amen
[42:06] but you know what you're the light of
[42:08] the world
[42:09] because you possess the very literal
[42:11] life of christ
[42:13] as a bride and so therefore you are the
[42:15] light
[42:17] and the light shining in darkness today
[42:19] amen
[42:20] genesis 2
[42:22] starting with verse 23. i want to title
[42:25] this perfect headship
[42:27] perfect
[42:28] leadership
[42:30] perfect headship
[42:33] perfect
[42:34] leadership now you can't add to perfect
[42:36] you can't take away perfect
[42:38] we might be able to in our term as human
[42:40] term perfect but when it's god's term of
[42:42] perfect nothing be added or taken away
[42:46] his word his will
[42:48] perfect will which is his word is
[42:51] flawless
[42:53] and that's a that's a
[42:55] deeper meaning than perfect
[42:57] it can't be flawed nothing it's ability
[43:00] to be flawed it's light you can't put a
[43:02] shadow of turning to god
[43:04] amen and it's because when you put a
[43:07] shadow to it you add something or take
[43:08] from them from it
[43:10] so may we understand and realize
[43:13] that it's to only believe
[43:15] is what god's looking for
[43:18] amen genesis 2 23
[43:20] and adam said i want you to notice who
[43:22] said
[43:24] adam
[43:26] said
[43:28] this is now bone
[43:30] of my
[43:32] bones
[43:34] now we know the story here we could back
[43:36] up and god put him in a deep sleep and
[43:38] took from adam he didn't take another
[43:40] something outside of adam he took from
[43:43] adam
[43:47] and made he a woman
[43:50] and brought her to the man we also
[43:51] understand that adam's spirit which was
[43:54] feminist and masculine both that
[43:56] feminist spirit which was not another
[43:58] spirit it was
[44:01] adam's spirit
[44:04] the woman received
[44:07] and we're tied together in the binding
[44:09] tie of the same holy spirit
[44:13] of christ
[44:15] amen so he said and adam said this is
[44:18] now watch what he said bone of
[44:20] my bones
[44:24] and flesh of
[44:25] my flesh
[44:29] other words she
[44:31] is me
[44:34] okay
[44:35] bone of my bone flesh of my flesh she
[44:37] shall be called woman because she was
[44:39] taken out of man
[44:42] and she was meant to
[44:44] bring forth life
[44:46] she was a woman
[44:49] a man with a womb
[44:51] therefore shall a man leave his father
[44:53] and mother and cleave unto his wife
[44:56] and they shall be one flesh
[45:02] and they were both naked the man and his
[45:03] wife and were not ashamed i want you to
[45:05] go with me over here to
[45:07] revelation chapter
[45:09] 3.
[45:21] other sister i'm not preaching to find
[45:23] accolades
[45:24] i don't care anything about that not
[45:26] wanting to find
[45:28] uh
[45:30] seeking
[45:32] popularity
[45:34] i don't care anything about popularity
[45:37] what i want to do
[45:38] is bring the word for the season not
[45:40] only bring it but live it
[45:44] that should be the heart desire of every
[45:45] one of us
[45:48] because where the blood is applied is
[45:50] out of the word for the season
[45:52] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[45:54] light the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[45:56] us from all sin
[45:59] amen you're under the
[46:01] washing of the water of this word this
[46:03] morning
[46:05] amen i hope we can have an attitude to
[46:08] allow it to be god speaking to you
[46:10] personally that's my heart's desire
[46:14] revelations 3
[46:16] 14
[46:19] and unto the angel that's the messenger
[46:21] of the church of the laodiceans right
[46:23] these things saith
[46:26] the amen we know the amen is absolute
[46:30] saith the amen
[46:32] the faithful and true witness
[46:34] the beginning of the creation of god
[46:38] the beginning
[46:40] of the creation
[46:41] of god
[46:42] hebrews chapter 10. i want you to hold
[46:45] that in your heart because
[46:53] this thing saith the amen
[46:55] the beginning
[46:58] of god's creation of himself in flesh
[47:02] amen
[47:07] hebrews
[47:09] chapter 10
[47:11] and verse 5
[47:13] wherefore
[47:14] when he cometh into the world
[47:17] when he cometh into the world he saith
[47:20] sacrifice and offering thou what is not
[47:22] but a body hast thou prepared
[47:26] me
[47:28] and i want to i want to
[47:30] we know when realized that was god the
[47:32] son
[47:34] god himself
[47:35] created himself a body
[47:37] stepped into that body that was the
[47:39] fullness of the godhead bodily
[47:42] believe that
[47:44] god was fully manifested in the human
[47:46] temple called the masterpiece
[47:49] that was the second adam but i want to
[47:52] take this a little deeper than that
[47:55] i want to come to the light of our day
[47:56] there's a body prepared for me
[48:02] i'm talking about me individually
[48:04] who i really am there's a body prepared
[48:07] sacrifice and offering he's not
[48:09] requiring
[48:11] some outward
[48:12] giving of a lamb or or
[48:15] or some kind of works affair to try to
[48:17] merit salvation
[48:19] salvation is a finished work
[48:22] amen but there is a body he has prepared
[48:25] he has prepared a body for me and you
[48:29] bride
[48:31] you may be seated
[48:37] but a body has self-prepared me
[48:40] who
[48:42] there was a body prepared for ever
[48:48] there was a body prepared verge adam
[48:50] said this is now bone of my bones
[48:54] this was in me this was abiding in me
[48:56] this come in me this was a this was me
[48:58] and and i i've got to manifest and bring
[49:02] forth that portion of me in their season
[49:07] but when god came to the earth in the
[49:09] manifestation of himself jesus christ
[49:12] the word living made flesh
[49:15] i was in him
[49:17] you were in him there was a body
[49:19] prepared for me
[49:21] amen and the revelation of who you are
[49:24] is contained right there
[49:27] amen because when because if you were in
[49:30] god's thinking and i pray that god will
[49:32] open this up and we know that the that
[49:34] the bride
[49:36] the
[49:36] existed in the thoughts of himself
[49:39] eternally they were his eternal thoughts
[49:42] of himself
[49:45] when he came to the earth and manifested
[49:47] himself in the fullness of the godhead
[49:49] bodily in that man i was in him that was
[49:52] a body prepared for me
[49:56] amen everything that god would judge me
[49:59] by cannot be judged contrary to that
[50:02] body
[50:04] because i was in him and i was in him
[50:07] i never i was always in him
[50:12] amen
[50:14] see so he said here he says now
[50:16] he is standing in the midst of the
[50:18] church this is a quote brother branham
[50:19] as he stands there revealing who he is
[50:21] in this last stage he calls himself the
[50:24] author
[50:25] of the creation of god this is another
[50:28] creation this has to do with the church
[50:35] right
[50:38] this
[50:38] this has to do with the church this is a
[50:41] special designation of himself
[50:47] this is a special designation of himself
[50:51] he is the creator of that church
[50:54] where were you created
[50:56] in christ
[50:58] how is he created spoken word
[51:00] how does he create his bride through the
[51:02] same way spoken word
[51:06] amen but they but where was you at the
[51:09] beginning you were in him
[51:11] you came to the earth in him
[51:14] everything that god required was
[51:16] provided in him
[51:20] you were perfect in him you still are
[51:22] perfect in him
[51:24] amen
[51:26] you the bible says you were you were
[51:28] accepted
[51:29] in the beloved
[51:31] case dismissed
[51:34] the revelation that you have personally
[51:36] is the revelation of jesus christ in you
[51:39] showing that you were in him already
[51:41] when he came to the earth he lived the
[51:43] life that god accepted for you it's
[51:46] finished
[51:50] and he couldn't unveil that he kept out
[51:52] of hidden mystery of that threefold
[51:54] purpose of how god all that god was he
[51:56] poured into christ and all that christ
[51:58] was he's poured into his body
[52:01] he kept that a hidden mystery but
[52:03] letting it out gradually until the end
[52:05] time when the seventh seal
[52:07] of those seals were broke
[52:12] amen
[52:12] because he comes to you personally it's
[52:14] like he did the little cousin
[52:17] he came to her personally none of the
[52:19] other cousins knew about it he came to
[52:20] her it wasn't a public show he came to
[52:23] her perfect perfectly on time he said do
[52:26] you know the reason why i'm here
[52:30] i'm looking for a wife
[52:32] and he unveiled her himself and his
[52:35] purpose for being here and brother
[52:37] branham said and in page 149 of the
[52:40] church age he said god has a heart
[52:42] purpose
[52:44] god has an eternal purpose a heart
[52:46] purpose to have a bride of his own
[52:49] choosing and that will he do amen
[52:52] when he came to the earth and manifested
[52:55] himself for our redemption i was in him
[52:57] i went to the cross in him i raised up
[52:59] with him
[53:04] how can god judge me
[53:06] unperfect when he shows me that i am
[53:08] perfect
[53:10] in him
[53:13] not physically perfect
[53:15] i'm not talking about this physical
[53:18] the phys i was not physically i was in
[53:20] his mind but i came into this body but
[53:23] we're there
[53:25] who was i there in him i was the living
[53:28] word in him that he said i can do
[53:30] nothing except my father show me
[53:33] i was in that spirit when he came i was
[53:36] in god who manifested himself in him
[53:40] amen and how do i know i was in him
[53:43] because that same spirit now lives in me
[53:45] identifying itself by keeping the
[53:47] promise of the word and recognizing it
[53:50] in our day
[53:51] and it's revealed to me
[53:56] amen he said he said he would reveal it
[53:58] when he would come he said i will show
[54:00] you things to come i will reveal my word
[54:02] i will hear it in you and reveal it to
[54:05] you he said bro man said there's your
[54:07] evidence of whether you have the holy
[54:08] ghost or not
[54:13] it keeps you
[54:14] lined with the word
[54:17] it's not your living it's his living
[54:20] now he lives in you
[54:23] you and him
[54:25] pouring out his life in you
[54:27] you and him are not separate you are one
[54:30] he's just himself in another form
[54:33] all right i don't want to get ahead of
[54:34] myself here let's let's go back here but
[54:37] just take these things step by step but
[54:39] he said but a body has self-prepared me
[54:41] i want to want you to see that
[54:43] individually
[54:45] for you
[54:47] a body has been paired was prepared for
[54:49] you

[55:26] or you'll never be able to meet him in
[55:28] the air
[55:29] you'll have to see that yourself
[55:32] you can't see it in yourself you're not
[55:34] enough studying to make you see it
[55:36] yourself it takes the work of the holy
[55:37] ghost in you

[56:10] word was his body
[56:14] amen he said and that word is his body
[56:20] amen it is his body a complete
[56:22] revelation of himself is his body
[56:26] hallelujah who finished the mystery of
[56:28] adam
[56:31] adam and eve
[56:33] made her the complete revelation of adam
[56:41] but she had to be manifest in her season
[56:43] in her time that's why it takes
[56:45] revelation
[56:46] but revelation comes by hearing the
[56:48] truth of this
[56:49] ministered
[56:54] amen
[56:58] the mystery of adam was revealed today
[57:01] the seals were tore off so the mystery
[57:02] of jesus christ the finished mystery
[57:05] could be revealed
[57:07] unveiled
[57:10] a mystery hidden and
[57:13] opened is an unveiling
[57:16] amen
[57:20] all right so
[57:24] he said he goes on he says he is the
[57:26] creator of that church heavenly argument
[57:27] created his own bride he created his own
[57:30] bride
[57:32] where were we created
[57:36] amen
[57:37] where were you
[57:40] there's only one book that tells you
[57:42] where you come from who you are and
[57:43] where you're going
[57:45] that's this book
[57:47] but it was sealed with seven seals
[57:50] the little book of revelation held the
[57:52] complete total mystery divine revelation
[57:56] and completion of himself the complete
[57:58] revelation of jesus christ
[58:00] that's where you stand
[58:05] amen that's where you stand
[58:08] that is your message
[58:10] remember the message of this hour was
[58:12] sent to you to come in and live in you
[58:15] to take you home
[58:18] the message of the hour is set brother
[58:20] braham said for the rapture of the bride
[58:22] for the going home of the bride amen
[58:26] amen
[58:31] see you find yourself you were already
[58:34] in him you were in the head
[58:38] then where's the rest of the body has to
[58:39] be manifest
[58:42] hallelujah
[58:45] all right so he said he said now i've
[58:48] come i come i low in the volume of the
[58:50] book it is written of me can you see
[58:52] your were you written
[58:55] we couldn't see that clearly it was a
[58:57] hidden thing but when that which is
[58:59] perfect has come we can see as he sees
[59:02] us
[59:09] amen
[59:11] that's why there's no fear the bride is
[59:12] not fearing
[59:14] what is it going to be we've already
[59:15] realized that we were already in him
[59:17] every seed is going to bring forth of
[59:18] its kind
[59:21] we are just a many member body a a
[59:24] varied member of himself a god of
[59:26] variety
[59:27] amen but it's all one headship it's all
[59:30] one word it's all one life flowing
[59:32] through the body
[59:37] all right so
[59:39] he said i come in the volume of the book
[59:41] to do thy will
[59:44] faith without works is dead
[59:47] i've come to do thy will
[59:50] but it's got to be revealed first
[59:54] amen it's got to be our our confession
[59:56] should be a confession of revelation
[1:00:00] hold fast the confession of your faith
[1:00:02] unmovable
[1:00:04] how can you say if it's not revealed to
[1:00:06] you then how do you know you truly
[1:00:08] believe it
[1:00:12] amen you're confessing what you believe
[1:00:16] and you wait for that because the just
[1:00:18] shall live by faith
[1:00:20] we aren't here just to press our own way
[1:00:22] and figure out our own way we have a
[1:00:24] perfect headship
[1:00:26] a perfect leadership
[1:00:30] now my subject
[1:00:33] consider your ways
[1:00:36] follow your
[1:00:40] head consider your ways and i'm speaking
[1:00:44] to every one of us that's me included
[1:00:47] consider
[1:00:48] our ways
[1:00:50] are we following the head
[1:00:55] what are we following have you given him
[1:00:58] headship
[1:01:00] satan is quick at trying to discourage
[1:01:02] you from giving yourself completely over
[1:01:05] to a total dependency upon god
[1:01:08] he will discourage you right and left
[1:01:10] he'll try to do everything he can to get
[1:01:12] you to look at who you're not
[1:01:14] instead of who god sees you are
[1:01:18] he'll point out your failures point at
[1:01:20] your faults and i can point back to him
[1:01:21] and said i never had a failure nor a
[1:01:23] fault because all my faults and failures
[1:01:25] were in a perfect body
[1:01:28] done away with
[1:01:30] by a perfect blood
[1:01:35] and we all have failures and faults but
[1:01:37] that's not what god's looking at
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:42] he's looking at himself the message of
[1:01:44] the hours to unveil himself
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:50] all right now
[1:01:55] he said so as the spirit of god he came
[1:01:59] down and created he said he heavenly
[1:02:01] bridegroom created his own bride
[1:02:04] as the spirit of god he came down and
[1:02:06] created in the virgin mary the cells
[1:02:08] from which
[1:02:09] his body was
[1:02:12] born
[1:02:15] i was in that creation
[1:02:19] i was right there in that creation
[1:02:23] when he came forth as a created word
[1:02:25] spoken word i was in him
[1:02:28] how can you be so sure because romans 8
[1:02:30] 11 said if the spirit that raised up
[1:02:32] jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll
[1:02:34] quicken your body sub bring it subject
[1:02:36] to the word
[1:02:38] he'll lead us in the word he'll reveal
[1:02:41] himself to us
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:47] all right
[1:02:49] so
[1:02:50] he says
[1:02:52] when he created mary the cells in which
[1:02:53] his body was born i want to repeat that
[1:02:56] he created the very cells in the womb of
[1:02:58] mary for that body
[1:03:03] you were there in that creation
[1:03:07] i can just hear the red say what case
[1:03:11] case is dismissed
[1:03:13] they have the token life which i only
[1:03:15] see and i can't see their failures i
[1:03:17] can't see their mistakes i can't see any
[1:03:20] of these things
[1:03:22] because i and them will discern those
[1:03:24] failures and mistakes and they're quick
[1:03:25] to say yes lord i will not do that again
[1:03:28] forgive me
[1:03:30] if you need to go to someone else and
[1:03:32] ask forgiveness
[1:03:34] make it right that's the holy spirit in
[1:03:36] action
[1:03:39] and as long as you harbor that you'll
[1:03:40] become bitter you'll become on an island
[1:03:42] you'll be a turtle and a shell
[1:03:45] you'll have nothing to do with anybody
[1:03:46] else
[1:03:47] and we see that happening that's a
[1:03:49] cancer that's the devil's work
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:55] so when i go to hear anything don't go
[1:03:57] like a turtle in your shell now said
[1:03:59] doesn't apply to me
[1:04:00] it applied to me
[1:04:02] and it applies to every one of us
[1:04:05] but i'm trying to point out and bring in
[1:04:07] your remembrance where your position is
[1:04:09] to try to show you before i really get
[1:04:11] down to my subject
[1:04:13] i want to show you here
[1:04:15] where you're called in who you were
[1:04:17] where you are and where you still are
[1:04:21] amen remind us of this that we may
[1:04:24] realize that we have a perfect headship
[1:04:27] a perfect leadership and we can depend
[1:04:30] on it perfectly and we don't have to
[1:04:32] figure out how it's working
[1:04:37] amen we don't have to go about and try
[1:04:39] to do works and all this we just simply
[1:04:41] say yes lord that word is your word you
[1:04:44] said when you put forth your sheep you
[1:04:46] went before them and the sheep followed
[1:04:48] you because they knew your voice
[1:04:52] is that right they know your voice
[1:04:58] and and they'll and they'll go in and
[1:05:00] out and find pasture
[1:05:03] and he'll put it forth to sheep i'm
[1:05:04] referring to saint john 10 verse 3 and
[1:05:07] when he put it forth as sheep he went
[1:05:09] before them
[1:05:12] and the sheep followed him
[1:05:15] you need a shepherd
[1:05:16] you cannot lead yourself
[1:05:19] somebody every day is leading you to do
[1:05:21] what you do the attitude you take the
[1:05:23] motives you take everything something is
[1:05:25] leading you
[1:05:28] and there's only two powers
[1:05:32] there's only two powers that's the power
[1:05:33] of the enemy
[1:05:35] which is perversion of the real truth
[1:05:37] and the power of god which is eternal
[1:05:39] life
[1:05:41] one of those is leading us in everything
[1:05:43] and oh god may we become so conscious of
[1:05:46] your presence and of your pr your
[1:05:48] presence in us and through us
[1:05:51] may our focus be
[1:05:53] not no longer blurred but focuses on one
[1:05:56] person christ
[1:05:58] in us
[1:05:59] christ where is this headship
[1:06:01] i'll get to that in just a moment you'll
[1:06:03] find where this headship is
[1:06:07] if you find where the headship is coming
[1:06:09] back to what we i i can't begin finish
[1:06:12] it because it's gone too far in between
[1:06:13] now but here it is love if we find where
[1:06:16] the headship is here in his love
[1:06:23] amen
[1:06:24] amen so
[1:06:31] the last adam of him it was said low a
[1:06:34] body has self-prepared for me
[1:06:38] god not mary provided that body
[1:06:41] mary was the human incubator she carried
[1:06:43] the holy child and brought him to birth
[1:06:45] it was a god man
[1:06:47] mary was a type of pentecostal
[1:06:49] organization
[1:06:52] went to organization see
[1:06:55] god poured out the spirit upon him and
[1:06:57] out of that pouring out he brought forth
[1:06:59] a bride that was right in that plant
[1:07:03] and they organized it became a shuck and
[1:07:05] it protected it until finally
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:10] when the message began to begin realize
[1:07:13] the shuck had to pull away
[1:07:17] and identified itself to be a shock
[1:07:19] but where is what's beyond the shock
[1:07:22] the seed itself
[1:07:25] the wheat itself
[1:07:26] the son of man himself is revealed
[1:07:28] that's why we had to have that revealing
[1:07:31] to wake us up
[1:07:33] himself revealed
[1:07:36] amen how can we come to him unless he
[1:07:38] opens and unveils himself to us his
[1:07:42] purpose to us
[1:07:45] god's heart purpose what's god's heart
[1:07:47] purpose his central theme his central
[1:07:49] purpose was have a bride like unto
[1:07:51] himself that be himself made manifest
[1:07:56] amen he said i'll make it known i'll
[1:07:58] unveil it completely in the end
[1:08:01] and it'll be assignments at the end
[1:08:04] and we need not to play games anymore we
[1:08:06] need to recognize our leader
[1:08:09] we need to recognize our headship
[1:08:12] we need to give ourselves
[1:08:13] unconditionally unreservedly completely
[1:08:15] over and forget about your feelings and
[1:08:17] your emotions and what this one said and
[1:08:19] this one didn't say in something else
[1:08:21] and realize you have your focus on one
[1:08:23] headship
[1:08:26] and he will not lead you away from the
[1:08:27] word he'll lead you into the full truth
[1:08:30] of the word
[1:08:32] amen
[1:08:35] amen all right so
[1:08:38] he said
[1:08:40] he was of the he said he was a god man
[1:08:43] it was a god man
[1:08:44] you believe the bride
[1:08:48] the bride i'm not talking about the
[1:08:50] outer man
[1:08:51] she's outer man so was jesus
[1:08:55] are you with me
[1:08:57] but in that was his father my father
[1:08:59] worketh hitherto and i work because he
[1:09:01] knew who he was he followed that
[1:09:03] leadership my father worketh hitherto
[1:09:06] and i work i have that connection with
[1:09:08] my father
[1:09:11] and he said that same
[1:09:12] that same harmony
[1:09:14] that's got to exist between him
[1:09:17] and his bride
[1:09:21] amen
[1:09:22] it takes a lot of shaving down you're
[1:09:24] gonna go through sufferings and trials
[1:09:26] and heartaches and but it's all for a
[1:09:28] purpose god will not allow that to come
[1:09:30] upon your way except it be for a purpose
[1:09:32] to bring forth himself in revelation and
[1:09:36] reveal to you who you are
[1:09:40] that's what it's all about
[1:09:42] let him do his work
[1:09:45] he's not going to allow you to go
[1:09:46] through anything but what is good for
[1:09:48] you

[1:10:01] and joined
[1:10:03] he was the new creation god
[1:10:06] man and god met and joined
[1:10:11] that settles it
[1:10:12] take that you devil
[1:10:16] you can't move me out of my position
[1:10:17] that's my position
[1:10:20] amen

[1:10:27] him

[1:10:31] i've never was in him and then left him
[1:10:32] i'm still in him because his spirit is
[1:10:35] in me identifying i was in him
[1:10:39] there is the rock that he would build
[1:10:41] his church on
[1:10:44] or is the revelation
[1:10:46] of what he would build his church on was
[1:10:47] a revelation of himself
[1:10:50] in you
[1:10:52] the baptism of the holy ghost is the new
[1:10:54] birth
[1:10:56] amen
[1:10:58] it opens up
[1:11:00] a new creation it reveals a new creation
[1:11:04] a spoken word creation how is he
[1:11:06] creating his sons and daughters the same
[1:11:09] method he always used by the word by
[1:11:12] spoken word

[1:11:15] to keep you away from feeding on the
[1:11:17] spoken word and it's season
[1:11:21] hallelujah and you can't receive who you
[1:11:24] are what you are unless you come through
[1:11:25] the interpretation of god's method and
[1:11:27] way through a profit
[1:11:30] vindicated profit
[1:11:36] and as you feed and as you feed

[1:11:41] but things begin to unveil to you and
[1:11:43] unveil what's the unveiling the
[1:11:45] unveiling of himself until you see
[1:11:48] that he's unveiled himself in a form

[1:11:53] manifestation and revelation of the son
[1:11:55] of man
[1:11:59] amen

[1:12:39] they can't grow into any other way
[1:12:42] they have to grow up into him
[1:12:46] they receive the holy ghost it changed
[1:12:48] them just like abraham and sarah were
[1:12:51] changed they were changed so they could

[1:13:33] you see your position what's my position
[1:13:35] now where am i seated
[1:13:37] i'm seated in heavenly places
[1:13:39] brother baron said that's the bride's
[1:13:41] position
[1:13:42] that you're positionally placed
[1:13:45] positionally placed in christ you are
[1:13:47] now seated in heavenly places
[1:13:50] in christ
[1:13:56] having received the same life in you as
[1:13:58] a token that you were in him already
[1:14:01] and you're not ashamed to let that be
[1:14:02] identified
[1:14:04] because your everyday living and life
[1:14:05] here is himself made manifest
[1:14:08] we ought to keep that in mind we're not
[1:14:10] here just to float around we're not here
[1:14:11] for any other purpose but to be the very
[1:14:13] manifestation of himself hallelujah
[1:14:17] that's a high calling
[1:14:21] and we're pressing toward the mark for
[1:14:22] the prize of that
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:27] we're pressing toward the mark for the
[1:14:28] prize of that high calling
[1:14:31] there is a high calling we're in the
[1:14:32] midst of a high calling
[1:14:34] what are we we're as queen we're
[1:14:37] sovereignty under headship
[1:14:40] he's our king he's our headship we have
[1:14:42] one thing that's obey his word
[1:14:45] and i can't obey it in my own human self
[1:14:48] i have nothing in me to obey that like
[1:14:50] that but it takes the working of himself
[1:14:52] and me will keep me will hold me and
[1:14:54] he'll live out what i'm to here to live
[1:14:59] it's all in him
[1:15:02] it's all him
[1:15:04] so what are we doing what are we letting
[1:15:06] dominate our lives
[1:15:10] it's not him who is it
[1:15:12] if something come between you and i who
[1:15:14] is dominating
[1:15:16] when you brought us something else
[1:15:17] besides his leadership and his word he
[1:15:19] wants you spoke to you about and you
[1:15:21] just keep bowing to another thing what
[1:15:23] is it it's a spirit of idolatry
[1:15:29] and say you have it i'm saying that's
[1:15:31] what it is
[1:15:33] did you catch you did you follow me
[1:15:35] that's what it is i'm not saying you're
[1:15:37] idolaters i don't believe there's
[1:15:39] anybody if there is you need to repent
[1:15:41] and get right and get the holy ghost
[1:15:43] because the holy ghost don't point that
[1:15:44] out to you you've got a wrong ghost
[1:15:51] you got a wrong headship
[1:15:53] that's the truth i don't mean that to be
[1:15:55] funny that's exactly the truth because
[1:15:57] he made a promise if he's in you the
[1:15:59] leader he's also going to discern where
[1:16:01] you're going and what you are and who
[1:16:02] you are you don't have to sit down and
[1:16:03] trying to figure it out let go of your
[1:16:05] own thinking and your own humanness and
[1:16:07] give way and give over to him
[1:16:10] completely
[1:16:12] and a submission and surrender
[1:16:16] because any time you ball to something
[1:16:18] outside of his direct leadership it's a
[1:16:20] purp what it is is a spirit of fear
[1:16:27] amen i
[1:16:28] i know that was hard but that's exactly
[1:16:30] what it is may god open it to our heart
[1:16:32] our eyes to see and ears to hear
[1:16:35] amen
[1:16:40] because i've come written in this book
[1:16:41] and this little book was opened and hate
[1:16:43] and satan hates that book
[1:16:48] he has nothing when that's revealed in
[1:16:49] the bride and recognizing what she is
[1:16:51] and that she does the greater works
[1:16:53] she's an invincible army
[1:16:56] it's a complete rev that little book
[1:16:57] contained the complete revelation of
[1:16:59] christ
[1:17:00] complete revelation of jesus christ
[1:17:04] amen that's why i was that's why i was
[1:17:06] sealed back there that book of
[1:17:07] revelation was the revelation of jesus
[1:17:10] christ a little book brother branham
[1:17:12] said it was the bride book
[1:17:14] amen
[1:17:16] amen all right
[1:17:18] let's go to job 23
[1:17:22] and so
[1:17:23] man and god met and joined
[1:17:25] he was the first
[1:17:27] of this new race i want you to notice he
[1:17:30] was the first
[1:17:32] of this new race what was this race god
[1:17:36] god
[1:17:37] manifested in flesh not another god was
[1:17:43] the lord was
[1:17:44] manifested in flesh and he was the
[1:17:47] beginning of that new race
[1:17:49] the beginning of the creation
[1:17:52] of god
[1:17:54] god creating himself
[1:17:57] in a in a body
[1:18:00] amen
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:05] i pray that god will reveal to you that
[1:18:07] you were in him already
[1:18:09] that that's where your revelation lays
[1:18:12] it's all contained in him
[1:18:14] every bit of it's contained in him
[1:18:18] you are contained in him
[1:18:20] you live the life that you are meant to
[1:18:22] live in him god can't see you in any
[1:18:24] other way you are he is your
[1:18:28] identification
[1:18:32] he is your identification
[1:18:34] you are identified everything he did
[1:18:37] obeying the father's word was applied to
[1:18:39] you
[1:18:41] and you know that because when the holy
[1:18:43] spirit comes in you it doesn't vary it
[1:18:45] doesn't change it does the same thing
[1:18:48] moves you a direct shoe and guides you
[1:18:51] in the word
[1:18:53] amen in your portion in your parts to
[1:18:56] play
[1:18:57] in the body
[1:18:59] but that little spoonful is no different
[1:19:02] than chemicals in the whole ocean
[1:19:04] it's the same word
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:08] did you follow me on that
[1:19:10] all right
[1:19:11] now
[1:19:13] i went instead of going to job
[1:19:16] job 23.
[1:19:18] you see if you see that then if you see
[1:19:21] what i'm trying to tell you you died
[1:19:22] with him you are already resurrected
[1:19:29] i didn't mean to have you swallow so
[1:19:30] hard
[1:19:32] but you're already resurrected it's just
[1:19:35] the body's got to catch up
[1:19:37] you've already got rapture you've
[1:19:39] already got rapture inside of you
[1:19:41] brother brahm said don't let that choke
[1:19:42] you he said you may not believe that let
[1:19:44] me say it again he said the rapture is
[1:19:46] already in you working
[1:19:48] you've already raptured
[1:19:51] he said everything you need for this
[1:19:53] journey including the rapture
[1:19:55] is in you now he said don't let that
[1:19:57] choke you he said you're already you've
[1:19:59] already got rapture in you now
[1:20:02] you've already raptured brother brown in
[1:20:04] fact he said what's coming forth in this
[1:20:06] hour is the rapturing bride coming forth
[1:20:11] amen you say all these are just cliche
[1:20:14] no they're more than cliches brother
[1:20:16] sister i won't accept that this is life
[1:20:19] this is the truth it's not something you
[1:20:21] just yeah we could sure we bring it
[1:20:24] through an avenue of our mental thinking
[1:20:26] but it's got to become a revelation and
[1:20:28] when it's a revelation it's your
[1:20:29] property there's nothing going to speak
[1:20:31] you out of it nothing to take you away
[1:20:32] from it you're sealed in them
[1:20:36] he's already revealed himself
[1:20:39] i'm sealed to the day of my redemption
[1:20:41] i've entered in i've entered in
[1:20:45] to his rest
[1:20:47] and i've ceased
[1:20:48] from my own labors
[1:20:50] you get a hold of that once you'll go
[1:20:52] out of here skipping a new tune
[1:20:55] you cease from your own labors
[1:20:58] now god's going to move you and he's
[1:20:59] going to do through he is going to act
[1:21:01] to you in unusual ways radical to your
[1:21:03] human thinking
[1:21:04] upside down to your human thinking
[1:21:06] unusual times unusual ways he's going to
[1:21:09] manifest himself he's going to fulfill
[1:21:11] his word because god is unusual he's not
[1:21:13] usual to our human thinking
[1:21:16] but this is where you know who you've
[1:21:18] met this is where you know that you know
[1:21:20] who's in you
[1:21:22] and where this headship is
[1:21:26] so he's creating many sons to himself
[1:21:28] how by the never failing method
[1:21:31] the word
[1:21:34] are you with me that's right all right
[1:21:38] aren't you glad you belonged to him
[1:21:41] this is the true revelation of god
[1:21:44] this was his purpose the purpose took
[1:21:46] form through election
[1:21:49] so guess what
[1:21:51] you never had any more to do with it
[1:21:52] than
[1:21:53] jacob did
[1:21:58] boy i thought somebody would have a
[1:22:00] shout at least amen
[1:22:04] do you see that
[1:22:06] he loved you
[1:22:09] i love jacob before jacob was even born
[1:22:12] for jacob did any works good or evil i
[1:22:14] wasn't basing what i my love upon his
[1:22:17] works
[1:22:22] is that right
[1:22:23] because jacob had the seed jacob alone
[1:22:26] was the seed
[1:22:30] jacob i loved
[1:22:32] he's myself he's me
[1:22:35] he's a shyster but he's me
[1:22:38] but god wasn't identifying himself under
[1:22:40] shysterism neither will he identify
[1:22:43] himself under emotionalism
[1:22:46] but he's identifying himself
[1:22:48] through the promised word for jacob
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:53] in its season
[1:22:55] he come forth desiring that birth right
[1:22:56] above everything i've got to have it he
[1:22:58] didn't even know intellectually humanly
[1:23:00] know what he was even desiring
[1:23:03] until he met
[1:23:04] the newell
[1:23:05] until he met the god that gave it to him
[1:23:08] then he come out a changed man
[1:23:11] he come out a limping prince
[1:23:13] amen he with me
[1:23:15] he come out wrestled with god until he
[1:23:16] found out
[1:23:18] god
[1:23:19] i've been bucking against you all along
[1:23:24] lord from this time on what is your will
[1:23:27] what would you have me to do
[1:23:30] i'm dependent upon your leadership i'm
[1:23:32] dependent upon you to guide me i'm not
[1:23:34] going to question that i'm not going to
[1:23:36] question it at all because i know that i
[1:23:38] know you're in me
[1:23:40] and greater is he that is in you than
[1:23:42] anything could upset your way any way
[1:23:44] shape or form
[1:23:46] amen
[1:23:50] that's when you know
[1:23:52] amen
[1:23:53] that's right it's a knowing it's a
[1:23:55] revelation
[1:23:58] god chose that even from the very
[1:24:00] beginning what separated came from abel
[1:24:02] revelation
[1:24:04] the only difference brother brahm said
[1:24:06] that was the only difference
[1:24:10] so he probably made it he made a a stand
[1:24:13] right there and said i've never change
[1:24:15] that to my seed to my elect
[1:24:18] i will reveal my word and that's what i
[1:24:22] recognize
[1:24:25] i'll take care of it he'll bring you to
[1:24:27] you remember the bible said i'm
[1:24:29] bypassing these scriptures just to quote
[1:24:30] them out but i know my thoughts
[1:24:33] concerning you
[1:24:37] i say thank the lord
[1:24:39] i don't know my thoughts but he knows
[1:24:40] his
[1:24:41] my thoughts he already has my thoughts
[1:24:44] he already knows about me knows
[1:24:45] everything about me and he said i'm
[1:24:47] gonna give you i'm gonna i'm not they're
[1:24:49] not thoughts of evil
[1:24:51] they're thoughts of good
[1:24:54] his thoughts about me is not of evil
[1:24:56] but of good to give you
[1:24:59] and me an expected end
[1:25:02] what is my expected end keep your eye on
[1:25:04] the goal out here what is your expected
[1:25:06] end
[1:25:07] i'll be with him live in him have always
[1:25:09] lived in him and i'll have a body like
[1:25:11] him
[1:25:13] amen expect it in i'll bring you to it
[1:25:16] i'll bring you to it
[1:25:18] it's out of your works it's out of that
[1:25:20] but i reveal it to you and you're not
[1:25:22] ashamed to let go and let the revelation
[1:25:25] declare itself
[1:25:29] if i bowed to you and said oh i'm afraid
[1:25:31] of what the people are going to say then
[1:25:33] i then i have what have i done
[1:25:35] i've not followed my guide i've not
[1:25:38] followed my head
[1:25:39] amen i'm adding something to it i'm
[1:25:41] taking away listen brother sister his
[1:25:43] leadership is flawless
[1:25:49] his leadership over you is absolutely
[1:25:51] perfect
[1:25:52] flawless can't be added to can't be
[1:25:55] because you're absolute is his word
[1:25:59] your absolute is how god interpreted his
[1:26:02] word for the season you say well i think
[1:26:04] it means this what did he say through
[1:26:06] the one he interpreted it through
[1:26:10] i have a right to put our mind and our
[1:26:12] thinking to that
[1:26:15] if that's the case god didn't need to
[1:26:17] send us a message
[1:26:20] he had to make it known i the lord will
[1:26:22] do nothing
[1:26:26] until i first reveal my secrets through
[1:26:29] my servants the prophets and you were
[1:26:31] there to receive the secret
[1:26:34] hallelujah

[1:26:40] nobody

[1:31:20] what's that to you
[1:31:22] i'm going to come to that scripture
[1:31:24] it's going to have to hit us right where

[1:31:28] light on our path if you don't have the
[1:31:30] light how do you know what's in air
[1:31:34] light expressed unveils expresses
[1:31:38] light doth make manifest
[1:31:41] darkness working of darkness something

[1:31:49] you're the people of this book he didn't
[1:31:51] want you to get the fact that you're the
[1:31:52] message of that monk
[1:31:54] he doesn't want you to see that that
[1:31:55] you're the vision that he had of himself
[1:31:58] in full revelation he doesn't want you
[1:32:00] to see that you're the part of that
[1:32:02] vision
[1:32:06] you are the vision
[1:32:08] you are the message
[1:32:10] of the seventh angel you are what god
[1:32:12] wanted to do his heart purpose you're
[1:32:15] fulfilling that purpose
[1:32:19] i don't mean to scream at you
[1:32:21] but you have to understand
[1:32:24] god made me thus
[1:32:28] if i scream it doesn't mean i don't like
[1:32:29] you
[1:32:30] it means i love you
[1:32:36] i know he said yeah brother david yeah
[1:32:39] sure sure you do
[1:32:41] sure you do you'd be sweet and kind and
[1:32:43] mellow yeah john the baptist would have
[1:32:45] too
[1:32:47] you know and
[1:32:48] there's different ones in the bible that
[1:32:50] jesus wouldn't have looked on with anger
[1:32:56] okay
[1:32:58] but i choose to follow my head
[1:33:01] because his head's revealed to me
[1:33:03] and i know what i'm speaking is divine
[1:33:05] love
[1:33:06] for you if i didn't have that i need to
[1:33:09] be at this i need to be out somewhere
[1:33:11] and say god i will not take a substitute
[1:33:14] i will not accept nothing else but
[1:33:16] yourself
[1:33:20] if i can't if i can't manifest yourself
[1:33:23] through me if you if i can't have the
[1:33:25] real then i'm asking you to take my life
[1:33:28] and let me live no more here i will not
[1:33:31] be a make-believer i will not be one
[1:33:33] that's a a a hypocrite
[1:33:38] you say you prayed that absolutely many
[1:33:40] times
[1:33:42] and i meant what i prayed
[1:33:44] i don't want to be that lord if i can't
[1:33:46] genuinely manifest you under the promise
[1:33:48] of the word of this hour i don't want
[1:33:50] nothing to do with this
[1:33:51] i want you to take me and don't let me
[1:33:54] stand before you someday with just a

[1:40:30] if you put the kingdom of god which is
[1:40:32] in you first these other things will be
[1:40:34] added unto you
[1:40:39] i just pray god encourage you in the way
[1:40:41] you should go and discourage you the way

[1:40:47] ministry
[1:40:51] the care of this assembly i said god
[1:40:54] encourage us in the way we should go and
[1:40:55] discourage us in the way it isn't right
[1:41:01] that's exactly right
[1:41:03] it isn't about your position it's about
[1:41:05] anything it's about following the lord
[1:41:06] because every position of him is not
[1:41:08] little or big

[1:42:10] when he became
[1:42:12] manifest as word i was in that word
[1:42:16] thereby i know i have a body waiting

[1:42:44] i hope you're catching your position
[1:42:48] david isn't melchizedek
[1:42:51] but the one i'm going to enter into is
[1:42:55] and i've already been identified in him
[1:42:57] because i've already heard from my
[1:42:58] theophany
[1:43:00] that theophany is eternal
[1:43:03] never did begin never did end
[1:43:06] and with that reality of knowing that i

[1:43:28] have to try and work up and pump up try
[1:43:31] to live it it'll live itself
[1:43:32] automatically
[1:43:36] amen you don't have to pump it up and
[1:43:39] work it up you just need to let go and
[1:43:40] let god have his way
[1:43:42] all right let's see if i can get through
[1:43:44] this a little quicker
[1:43:48] i'd like to go to psalm 828
[1:43:51] i mean
[1:43:52] psalm 18
[1:43:54] 28
[1:43:56] and the bible brother paul or job said
[1:43:58] he performeth the thing that is
[1:44:00] appointed for me he performed with it
[1:44:03] i want to finish that scripture he said
[1:44:05] for he performeth the thing that is
[1:44:07] appointed for me
[1:44:09] did you catch that he
[1:44:11] and the bible said in psalms that he
[1:44:13] will perfect those things concerning me
[1:44:17] amen
[1:44:18] psalm 138 he will perfect that which
[1:44:20] concerneth me
[1:44:24] and my going out and coming in is all
[1:44:26] preserved
[1:44:29] amen
[1:44:30] it's already preserved
[1:44:36] i'll never leave you i'll never forsake
[1:44:39] you
[1:44:41] what do you have to fear nothing can
[1:44:42] come your way nothing can happen to you
[1:44:44] except i allow it
[1:44:47] what a perfect what a perfect union
[1:44:50] what a perfect relationship between a
[1:44:53] husband
[1:44:54] and his wife
[1:44:57] amen
[1:44:58] psalm 18.
[1:45:07] some of these i couldn't i didn't have
[1:45:08] enough markers to mark so i turned to
[1:45:10] them all right psalm 18
[1:45:14] 28
[1:45:15] for thou will light my candle
[1:45:17] the lord my god will enlighten my
[1:45:19] darkness
[1:45:21] for by thee have i have i run through a
[1:45:23] troop and by my god have i leaped over a
[1:45:25] wall
[1:45:27] as for the for god his way is perfect
[1:45:29] amen
[1:45:30] the word of the lord is tried
[1:45:33] amen
[1:45:35] the word of the lord is tried he is a
[1:45:37] buckler to all those that trust in him
[1:45:41] in him
[1:45:42] for who is god save the lord
[1:45:45] or who is a rock revelation save our god
[1:45:49] it is god that girdeth me with strength
[1:45:51] and maketh my way im perfect
[1:45:57] did i say something wrong
[1:45:59] i just added two letters
[1:46:04] he's made my way perfect
[1:46:07] not imperfect
[1:46:09] but
[1:46:10] perfect amen amen amen that's just how
[1:46:14] slight the devil is just change it a
[1:46:16] little bit
[1:46:18] oh you're not perfect
[1:46:21] it just depends on what side of the body
[1:46:23] you're talking
[1:46:24] about and what side you you want to deal
[1:46:27] with
[1:46:28] inside i'm as perfect as god is
[1:46:31] outer man
[1:46:33] depends on god totally comple well
[1:46:35] inside too but i'm saying it's imperfect
[1:46:39] so if you're looking perfection for
[1:46:40] david just come right down and say well
[1:46:42] bless god i'm perfect
[1:46:48] no i beg your pardon you're looking at
[1:46:50] the wrong person
[1:46:54] but if i speak through faith i am
[1:46:57] perfect
[1:46:59] all right
[1:47:00] now
[1:47:02] saint john john 10 3 i already mentioned
[1:47:04] to you isaiah 30 21.
[1:47:08] i say i've got to hurry i don't like to
[1:47:10] hurry you know i don't like to hurry
[1:47:12] anybody say amen
[1:47:18] paul you can use that one if you want
[1:47:20] all right isaiah 30.
[1:47:29] in fact you can be redundant with if you
[1:47:31] want
[1:47:32] okay isaiah 30
[1:47:35] and verse 21
[1:47:38] leadership and thine eyes there excuse
[1:47:40] me thine ears
[1:47:42] shall hear a word behind thee behind
[1:47:44] thee behind thee
[1:47:47] or inside of thee
[1:47:49] thy ear shall hear a word behind thee
[1:47:53] saying this is the way
[1:47:56] walk you in it and you know it sounded
[1:47:58] like a great big
[1:47:59] huge voice like lightning and thunder no
[1:48:03] no it's a still small voice
[1:48:07] but you know it
[1:48:09] because they know my voice
[1:48:11] and a stranger they'll not follow you
[1:48:14] know you have to be trained to learn to
[1:48:15] hear his voice
[1:48:17] it's there but you got to be trained you
[1:48:19] have to be trained just like a child has
[1:48:21] to be trained to one voice
[1:48:26] you have to be trained god trains us to
[1:48:29] hear that voice and none other
[1:48:31] and when you hear that voice and realize
[1:48:33] you're an absolute weakling and when you
[1:48:35] realize that you'll give yourself over
[1:48:36] to that one that's strong you'll give
[1:48:39] yourself to your strength
[1:48:42] my strength doesn't lay in david
[1:48:46] my strength is in him
[1:48:47] he's my strength
[1:48:49] all right then if i know that then i'm
[1:48:51] going to surrender to the strength why
[1:48:53] should i follow a weakling
[1:48:58] amen i'm following my strength
[1:49:04] that's right that's right all right now
[1:49:07] so you're going to hear that behind you
[1:49:08] saying this is the way walk you in it
[1:49:12] when you turn
[1:49:14] you're gonna have turns
[1:49:16] you're gonna have things change
[1:49:18] when you turn to the right hand and when
[1:49:20] you turn to the left god will say i want
[1:49:23] you to forsake that what are you gonna
[1:49:24] do turn it or not
[1:49:30] and you know it's god talking to you i
[1:49:32] want you to forsake that but lord but
[1:49:34] don't add your reasoning to it
[1:49:36] don't put your imagination on it forget
[1:49:39] about what people are going to think
[1:49:40] about you
[1:49:41] forget about all the works you did in
[1:49:43] building your great altar
[1:49:45] and all your fine works to produce it
[1:49:47] where you are forget about all of that
[1:49:50] and follow me
[1:49:57] oh that's too radical
[1:49:59] that's too out of my reason you know god
[1:50:01] expects us to reason he does as long as
[1:50:03] he agrees with the word
[1:50:07] are you with me
[1:50:08] all right okay
[1:50:12] okay i'm just going to skip through
[1:50:13] these i got to get to a point here you
[1:50:15] bear with me
[1:50:18] psalm 16 7 do as david did brother brown
[1:50:21] said he said put your let's just turn
[1:50:23] there we're right in in near psalms here
[1:50:25] just turn over to psalm 16.
[1:50:28] [Music]
[1:50:29] my wife what he gets after he said it's
[1:50:31] not psalms i guess it is psalms but it's
[1:50:33] psalm
[1:50:34] 16.
[1:50:36] i mean the bible does say the whole book
[1:50:38] is psalms
[1:50:39] but it's psalm 16. i don't have to be
[1:50:42] bothered with that anymore she corrected
[1:50:43] me a long time ago on that
[1:50:47] i learned my lesson
[1:50:50] i'm thankful for a good wife
[1:50:53] hey i'm not i mean that
[1:50:56] she's the other part of me
[1:50:59] amen i thought some brothers are the
[1:51:01] same men
[1:51:05] i'm not complete without her
[1:51:10] amen she was my eternal mate
[1:51:12] she is my eternal mate i believe we were
[1:51:15] meant to be together from eternity
[1:51:18] that was a revelation in my heart when i
[1:51:20] married her
[1:51:22] now we know your secret of being married
[1:51:24] 51 years
[1:51:27] yeah that's right
[1:51:30] and it'd be 151 if time went on
[1:51:34] amen i love her that much
[1:51:37] i'm not saying that hope to get a good
[1:51:38] meal when i get home now
[1:51:40] no
[1:51:41] no
[1:51:42] i would say if anyone at any time at any
[1:51:44] place
[1:51:46] she's a sweetheart
[1:51:48] i don't know how she thinks about me as
[1:51:50] being a husband
[1:51:51] but well yes i do i can't say that
[1:51:53] truthfully
[1:51:58] let me let you a little secret
[1:52:01] we have a love affair
[1:52:05] now don't you get the wrong thought
[1:52:06] about that
[1:52:09] she's one with me
[1:52:12] it is a love affair and we ought to have
[1:52:14] a love affair with god in fact we ought
[1:52:16] to be in so loved with god lord
[1:52:18] just your nod is all i need this is what
[1:52:21] i want you to do yes lord
[1:52:23] i'll go anywhere you want me to i'll go
[1:52:24] any place you want me to at any time you
[1:52:26] want me to and nothing else is then in
[1:52:28] my way when you say go
[1:52:33] amen
[1:52:36] that's exactly what it has to be
[1:52:41] otherwise you've got something else
[1:52:42] that's taking predominance preeminency
[1:52:45] all right
[1:52:46] now
[1:52:47] so
[1:52:47] psalm 16 7 says i will bless the lord
[1:52:50] who have given me counsel my reigns also
[1:52:54] shall instruct me in the night season i
[1:52:57] have set the lord always before me
[1:52:59] there's what you have to do right there
[1:53:02] daily
[1:53:03] we die
[1:53:04] daily
[1:53:05] to ourself
[1:53:07] i have set the lord always before me for
[1:53:09] because he's on he's at my right hand
[1:53:12] what's your right hand
[1:53:13] power and authority
[1:53:16] where's your power and authority lay see
[1:53:17] it's in him the word
[1:53:19] it's inside the headship is inside we're
[1:53:21] coming to that in just a moment
[1:53:23] he said he said therefore he said i have
[1:53:25] set the lord always before me because he
[1:53:27] is on my right hand i shall not be
[1:53:31] moved
[1:53:33] therefore my my heart is glad and my
[1:53:36] glory rejoices and my flesh also shall
[1:53:39] rest
[1:53:40] in hope you say brother david that was
[1:53:42] speaking of christ at calvary yes it is
[1:53:44] but it also applies to me whatever
[1:53:46] applies to him applies to me did you
[1:53:48] know that the same word brother brahm
[1:53:50] said written in the scriptures
[1:53:51] concerning him concerning you
[1:53:55] did you know that
[1:53:56] that's what he said
[1:53:57] that's exactly right
[1:53:59] you're in the volume of the book
[1:54:02] amen all right let's see here proverbs 3
[1:54:05] 4 says lean not to your own
[1:54:07] understanding
[1:54:08] but in all thy ways acknowledge him and
[1:54:10] he shall direct thy path
[1:54:13] thy paths right hand left hand when you
[1:54:16] turn to the right or to the left
[1:54:18] this is the way
[1:54:20] walk in it
[1:54:22] all right
[1:54:23] now
[1:54:25] second corinthians 4 18 said we should
[1:54:27] not look at the things which are seen
[1:54:28] they're temporal but look at the things
[1:54:30] that are not seen
[1:54:32] that's
[1:54:33] eternal
[1:54:35] so lord sharpen our focus to see what we
[1:54:38] should see psalm philippians 2 13 said
[1:54:42] that it's god
[1:54:43] which worketh in me
[1:54:46] god which worketh in you
[1:54:49] born again god working in you both to
[1:54:52] will
[1:54:53] and to do
[1:54:56] to will and do
[1:54:57] i don't know how you get any better than
[1:54:58] that to will and do
[1:55:00] his good
[1:55:02] pleasure brother i said what do we have
[1:55:04] to do let him
[1:55:08] he's in there
[1:55:10] you let him
[1:55:11] you say what authority do i have let him
[1:55:13] a wife lets her husband have headship
[1:55:15] over her
[1:55:18] well that's a whole message itself i
[1:55:19] preached that before but
[1:55:21] you want to know what the key is on his
[1:55:23] shoulders
[1:55:25] he opens and shuts
[1:55:27] no other one
[1:55:28] you want to know that he's got
[1:55:30] responsibility over you you've given it
[1:55:32] to him
[1:55:34] he's obligated he accepts the obligation
[1:55:37] of absolutely having right to do what he
[1:55:39] wants with you and through you
[1:55:41] because the bible said today with this
[1:55:43] open word it's god it's jesus christ
[1:55:45] working in and through his bride
[1:55:51] he didn't finish some works he had to do
[1:55:52] but now he does it in and through the
[1:55:54] bride to finish to complete his works
[1:55:58] he works in and through the bride that's
[1:56:01] in the mess you pick up your pen and
[1:56:02] write if you want to pick it up that's
[1:56:04] what he that wasn't brother brown's
[1:56:05] thoughts
[1:56:08] people want to say well that's just his
[1:56:09] thoughts well i'll have you know pick up
[1:56:11] your pen and write wasn't his thoughts
[1:56:14] that was god writing through his pen
[1:56:18] amen all right
[1:56:20] zechariah 4 6 not by power nor by by
[1:56:22] might or my power but by my spirit
[1:56:25] saith the lord amen
[1:56:32] therefore if we know that is god working
[1:56:34] in us both to will and to do of his good
[1:56:36] pleasure then quit your murmuring
[1:56:40] that's what the bible said that's the
[1:56:42] next verse verse 14
[1:56:44] then let us not murmur let's go to
[1:56:45] philippians there real quick and just
[1:56:47] point that out to you philippians

[1:57:35] lord i'll let down the net at thy word
[1:57:42] lord mayest help us to walk that way at
[1:57:44] thy word
[1:57:48] you know what you're absolute because
[1:57:49] you can't add to or take from it you
[1:57:50] know what you're absolute because
[1:57:52] heavens and earth will pass away but thy
[1:57:53] word won't
[1:57:55] so what other absolute do you have
[1:57:58] you've got to have an absolute
[1:58:01] either absolute's going to be yourself
[1:58:04] your own self motivation
[1:58:06] what you think is better than god's word
[1:58:09] or it's going to be god's word
[1:58:11] or it's going to be the message of the
[1:58:13] hour
[1:58:15] which is god's word

[2:03:38] church and we must be that type of
[2:03:40] christian for him to receive the wheat
[2:03:43] has to get ripe
[2:03:47] and listen we're far beyond what he's
[2:03:49] when he said that
[2:03:51] i believe you're seeing the weed of the
[2:03:53] golden brown
[2:03:54] you know brother david there just isn't
[2:03:56] very many i don't care how many there is
[2:03:58] the point is there is
[2:04:01] it's not how many god doesn't look in
[2:04:03] the mini he looks at those he ordained
[2:04:06] i don't know who that is it's none of my
[2:04:08] business
[2:04:10] i just preached the truth
[2:04:12] i'm not here to judge anybody by that
[2:04:14] but by their fruit
[2:04:16] they are known
[2:04:19] what is the fruit what did brother bam
[2:04:21] say the fruit was the word for the
[2:04:23] season

[2:04:51] unveiling of the word in you
[2:04:54] that's christ in you
[2:04:56] christ in you is god's great revelation
[2:05:00] that's his purpose right there

[2:05:04] things here that i just hit the tops of
[2:05:06] amen
[2:05:09] but you're led by the control room the
[2:05:11] control tower you're controlled by the
[2:05:14] tower on the inside of you brother brahm
[2:05:16] said that's the soul
[2:05:18] the person in there is pulling the
[2:05:20] levers making the buttons work and
[2:05:21] everything he's controlling whoever in
[2:05:24] your soul is who you are

[2:05:42] you've got to hold to that little wheel
[2:05:43] in the middle of the wheel and let it
[2:05:45] stabilize every move and every motion
[2:05:47] you make
[2:05:48] every thought that you have may it be
[2:05:51] controlled by this tower on the inside
[2:05:53] of you because god is setting right in
[2:05:55] his word of this hour that's you he's
[2:05:58] sitting right in the word of his hour of
[2:06:00] this hour in the evening light showing
[2:06:03] forth the light
[2:06:04] amen
[2:06:08] that's right it's what he is
[2:06:13] and when you can master and god give you
[2:06:15] grace to master your human ability
[2:06:18] god doesn't need your human ability
[2:06:23] like i said the rest of the afternoon
[2:06:25] talking about perfect strength and
[2:06:27] perfect weakness
[2:06:29] amen
[2:06:31] the only thing you can do to beat the
[2:06:33] devil is rely on christ and humbly
[2:06:35] humble yourself humble yourself humble
[2:06:38] your
[2:06:39] self
[2:06:42] and let him lead you
[2:06:45] see you'll never do it any other way
[2:06:47] your intellectual powers will never do
[2:06:48] it
[2:06:49] just rely on him he's the shepherd it
[2:06:51] ain't the sheep's business to keep the
[2:06:52] wolf away it's the shepherd's business
[2:06:54] but the sheep must stay with the
[2:06:56] shepherd in order to stay safe that's my
[2:06:58] safety zone is in christ in christ in
[2:07:01] christ and christ is the word that's the
[2:07:04] safety zone
[2:07:08] you have to know him as the person
[2:07:11] christ in you your redemption is a
[2:07:14] person
[2:07:16] and the revelation of that person in you
[2:07:19] identifies you're redeemed he come to
[2:07:22] redeem his thoughts of himself that's
[2:07:25] what he come to redeem

[2:07:53] you can get just away from your own
[2:07:54] worldly thinking humble yourself before
[2:07:56] god then you've got more power than the
[2:07:58] man that runs all over the building and
[2:08:00] makes a big lot of noise see because you
[2:08:02] have been able to conquer yourself
[2:08:06] and commit yourself to christ
[2:08:09] you see
[2:08:10] humble yourself and commit yourself
[2:08:13] to christ that shows true humility
[2:08:17] when you commit yourself fully into his
[2:08:19] hands
[2:08:20] even every word you speak even every
[2:08:22] breath you take even every beat of your
[2:08:24] heart every fiber of your being commit
[2:08:26] it to him
[2:08:28] amen
[2:08:30] that's really power when you humble
[2:08:32] yourself before him i say god let me
[2:08:34] have your humbleness
[2:08:37] let me have your humility
[2:08:42] amen to where david isn't seen
[2:08:45] christ is seen
[2:08:50] yourself in the
[2:08:51] sight of the lord and he shall lift you
[2:08:53] up humble yourselves therefore unto the
[2:08:54] mighty hand of god that may exalt you in
[2:08:56] due time casting all your care upon him

[2:11:55] something else that takes its place
[2:11:57] but sin won't rise again so a body is
[2:12:00] going to raise it'll be me but it won't
[2:12:02] be sin in it
[2:12:03] it'll be a young man
[2:12:05] just exactly what god had in his thought
[2:12:07] to begin with
[2:12:12] all right
[2:12:13] now
[2:12:15] let's start dude i don't want to get
[2:12:16] sidetracked on this
[2:12:18] then came
[2:12:19] remember the lord's how the time is that
[2:12:21] the lord's house should be built
[2:12:23] what's the lord's house his body
[2:12:27] how's it going to be built
[2:12:29] by the word
[2:12:31] god builds his body by the word
[2:12:34] all right
[2:12:37] you've got to let him build the body
[2:12:41] all right
[2:12:42] then came the word of the lord to haggai
[2:12:45] the prophet saying
[2:12:47] is it time for you o ye to dwell in your
[2:12:51] sealed houses and this house lie waste
[2:13:01] i'm pausing because i want this to go
[2:13:03] deep this is for you this is for us this
[2:13:05] morning
[2:13:09] every one of us
[2:13:13] and we're talking about the body of
[2:13:15] christ assembled here in this house
[2:13:19] amen all right
[2:13:24] the people say the time is not no excuse
[2:13:26] me it is it time for you oh ye to dwell
[2:13:29] in your sealed houses every one of us
[2:13:31] got good houses
[2:13:33] i don't know of anybody here that's a
[2:13:34] pauper and not living in a nice home
[2:13:39] thank god for it i'm not i'm not against
[2:13:41] that thank god he's blessed us
[2:13:42] abundantly
[2:13:45] i'm poor yet i'm very blessed
[2:13:49] we should never be afraid to be poor
[2:13:51] because prophet said we're all poor
[2:13:55] that's right
[2:13:59] all right but we're poor or poor in the
[2:14:01] world's thinking
[2:14:03] in the world's
[2:14:05] what money doesn't make you rich or poor
[2:14:09] amen that's just that's just man's
[2:14:11] interpretation
[2:14:12] okay now
[2:14:14] it's time for you oh ye is it time for
[2:14:16] you to dwell in your seal houses in this
[2:14:18] house lie waste now therefore thus saith
[2:14:22] the lord of hosts consider your ways
[2:14:28] you have sown much and bring in little
[2:14:29] you eat but you have not enough you
[2:14:31] drink but you're not filled with drink
[2:14:34] you you clothe you but there is none
[2:14:36] warm and ye that earneth wages earneth
[2:14:38] wages to put in a bag with holes
[2:14:42] thus saith the lord of hosts consider
[2:14:46] your ways
[2:14:49] i pray that god will drop this into
[2:14:51] every individual here from the pastor
[2:14:56] to the youngest child
[2:14:59] and every one of them in between
[2:15:01] that all of us
[2:15:04] the ministry
[2:15:05] especially me
[2:15:08] will realize
[2:15:10] what we're here for
[2:15:13] amen
[2:15:15] consider your ways
[2:15:18] go up to the mountain and bring wood and
[2:15:20] build a house
[2:15:22] and i will take pleasure in it and i
[2:15:24] will be glorified saith the lord you
[2:15:26] look for much and lo it came to little
[2:15:28] and when you brought it home i did blow
[2:15:30] upon it why saith the lord because my
[2:15:33] house is that is waste and you run every
[2:15:36] man unto his own house
[2:15:40] that's potent
[2:15:42] let me read that scripture again
[2:15:46] i'm talking about leadership here
[2:15:48] there's something there's something
[2:15:50] amiss here when god will not allow his
[2:15:53] house to lie waste
[2:15:57] i'm not saying it's waste but you've got
[2:15:59] to recognize
[2:16:02] what are the elders here for
[2:16:04] what is the ministry here for what are
[2:16:07] you here for
[2:16:09] why have you associated yourself in here
[2:16:13] let's do everything we can in one mind
[2:16:15] and what accord
[2:16:17] to give attention to the lord's
[2:16:18] leadership and what he's saying here
[2:16:22] amen we must make this house under the
[2:16:25] headship of the work
[2:16:27] not your feeling
[2:16:33] it must come under the headship of the
[2:16:34] word not the woman
[2:16:38] i'm talking about denominationalism
[2:16:40] dominating female
[2:16:42] but of the headship of the word it's the
[2:16:44] ministry it's the pastor it's the
[2:16:45] deacons it's the trustees to bring
[2:16:47] everything under the headship of the
[2:16:49] word
[2:16:53] amen
[2:16:55] and let this place prosper as a
[2:16:58] lighthouse
[2:17:00] but what we got to do consider our ways
[2:17:06] consider what the prophet said about it
[2:17:08] consider what the word said about it
[2:17:11] it's not just some whim it's thus saith
[2:17:13] the lord he said because of mine house
[2:17:16] that is waste and every man run into his
[2:17:19] own house therefore you put your house
[2:17:21] above the other house
[2:17:25] amen we all have these things we all
[2:17:28] meet it every day i'm telling you this
[2:17:30] struck me right between the eyes i said
[2:17:32] i had to go and repent and repented many
[2:17:34] times lord i am here for one thing and
[2:17:37] that's to raise up your word i don't
[2:17:39] care where i am
[2:17:42] we have a duty here to god
[2:17:45] we have we have been we have not only we
[2:17:47] have a duty to the people we have a duty
[2:17:50] to god to serve our purpose where he's
[2:17:53] got you
[2:17:54] and do it according to the word
[2:17:59] you have no right to preach i say yes i
[2:18:00] have every right to preach that
[2:18:05] amen
[2:18:07] i'm a minister of this gospel
[2:18:10] amen and god definitely i've had to show
[2:18:13] you our leadership our headship let me
[2:18:16] just read this to you right here i was
[2:18:18] going to hit it i told you i'd hit it
[2:18:20] let me just get this to you our headship
[2:18:22] is a kingdom
[2:18:24] our headship
[2:18:26] is a kingdom
[2:18:28] we're not we're predestinated of him
[2:18:30] we've come from the same source he came
[2:18:32] from i think i made that very clear
[2:18:34] but he said then our headship is a
[2:18:36] kingdom the kingdom of god is within you
[2:18:39] said the bible the kingdom we are not a
[2:18:41] denomination we belong to a kingdom the
[2:18:43] kingdom is the word of god made spirit
[2:18:45] and life in our own life
[2:18:48] bringing every
[2:18:50] to pass every promise of this day as it
[2:18:52] did in the day when the word and god was
[2:18:54] won and the word and god is one in his
[2:18:56] church today making it the headship of
[2:18:58] the body that is redeemed to bring the
[2:19:01] message the headship of the body that is
[2:19:03] redeemed to bring the message
[2:19:08] amen
[2:19:09] i wish i could stress that the way know
[2:19:11] what
[2:19:12] amen
[2:19:15] redeemed to bring the message what is
[2:19:17] the bride
[2:19:18] what is she she's the final voice
[2:19:23] the bride is to be the father messenger
[2:19:26] is the final voice
[2:19:29] the final trump
[2:19:36] amen
[2:19:37] where is that voice where is it today
[2:19:40] it's in the bride what is it by coming
[2:19:42] of christ son of man revealed before us
[2:19:45] we shouldn't take that lightly we should
[2:19:47] recognize where he's at
[2:19:53] it was so simple though many it passed
[2:19:55] right through
[2:19:56] except the bride and she's the only one
[2:19:59] it could only be revealed to her
[2:20:01] i'm talking to bride i'm talking to ones
[2:20:03] that can receive the word we need to
[2:20:05] make sure make sure you're following him
[2:20:10] you'd have little women just a little
[2:20:12] feeling well i feel you better make sure
[2:20:13] it's with according with the word
[2:20:16] brother abraham said you make sure it's
[2:20:17] him and when you're sure it's him then
[2:20:19] you press yourself right on through
[2:20:21] amen
[2:20:23] god's obligated to make sure it's the
[2:20:25] truth he's the discerner he's obligated
[2:20:27] to discern in you to discern the truth
[2:20:30] from error
[2:20:33] amen
[2:20:37] and the word and god is one in his
[2:20:39] church today making it the headship of
[2:20:41] the body that is redeemed to bring the
[2:20:43] message of the last day and be taken up
[2:20:45] from the dead in the resurrection go
[2:20:46] back and restore again as adam and eve
[2:20:49] in the beginning
[2:20:52] in the garden of eden
[2:20:53] the threefold mystery of god
[2:20:56] his body
[2:20:58] oh my
[2:21:00] god's perfected in what three
[2:21:03] what's our next step what's his third
[2:21:04] coming what's his coming now
[2:21:06] we come back to the earth in a
[2:21:07] millennium
[2:21:10] but the mystery of his coming is
[2:21:11] happening
[2:21:14] think of that
[2:21:15] how
[2:21:16] where we ought to be standing today
[2:21:18] we shouldn't have to be shoved and
[2:21:20] pushed into anything
[2:21:21] we should recognize the word as our head
[2:21:23] and our absolute and be up and doing it
[2:21:30] not looking to your own selfish motives
[2:21:32] and objectives in your own self and
[2:21:35] putting that over the needs of the body
[2:21:40] amen
[2:21:41] i'm guilty you're guilty every one of us
[2:21:42] are guilty but it's time we
[2:21:45] consider our ways
[2:21:56] you are his kingdom you are his eternal
[2:21:58] possession
[2:21:59] as i said david is not my head it's
[2:22:01] christ alone
[2:22:02] he you in your soul birth is my head
[2:22:08] amen
[2:22:09] okay i want to finish this excuse me
[2:22:12] getting a little bit sidetracked there
[2:22:14] almost sidetracked exactly verse 10
[2:22:16] therefore the therefore the heaven over
[2:22:18] you has stayed from dew
[2:22:20] and the earth has stayed from her fruit
[2:22:24] because my house
[2:22:26] lies that is waste what was he telling
[2:22:29] him go back and rebuild the house
[2:22:33] i'm here for you to come back and do
[2:22:35] your position that i've called you to do
[2:22:37] this is my ordained leadership go build
[2:22:39] the house but all but i but but but make
[2:22:42] excuses remember how jesus brought the
[2:22:43] excuses this one brought an excuse i've
[2:22:45] got to go visit this i've got a i've got
[2:22:47] a cow in the ditch or whatever it was i
[2:22:49] forget what it was go back i got to bury
[2:22:51] someone let the bird dead bury the dead
[2:22:53] i've got i gotta excuse excuse excuses
[2:22:58] it's your own selfish motives if god's
[2:23:00] calling you to do something individually
[2:23:02] and i don't know what he is or isn't but
[2:23:04] what he is you have one thing to do
[2:23:07] give yourself to it
[2:23:11] but it's painful brother david yeah it's
[2:23:13] painful
[2:23:14] it may be painful it may be contrary to
[2:23:17] your will but you have to do it anyway
[2:23:19] if god's called you to do it
[2:23:21] a double-minded man is unstable in his
[2:23:23] ways
[2:23:26] unstable why because his interest is
[2:23:30] divided he's divided in interest
[2:23:34] he's he's trying to live between the two
[2:23:36] realms
[2:23:38] this the soul realm and the physical
[2:23:40] realm trying to live between two realms
[2:23:42] and god's saying but this is the way
[2:23:43] walking in it
[2:23:45] i've asked you to give yourself i've
[2:23:47] asked you to give yourself a hundred
[2:23:48] percent to this body
[2:23:50] to the and you're afraid of doing it
[2:23:52] because you're afraid of what will
[2:23:54] happen
[2:23:58] i'm talking this seems like a little bit
[2:24:00] vague but i am doing that for a purpose
[2:24:03] trusting the lord to quicken it to you
[2:24:04] individually what he's speaking to you
[2:24:14] now watch what he said here
[2:24:17] then it's a rubbable
[2:24:19] verse 12 the son of sheltiel and joshua
[2:24:22] the son of josedec the high priest with
[2:24:25] all the remnant of the people obeyed the
[2:24:27] voice of the lord their god and the
[2:24:29] words of haggy i the prophet as the lord
[2:24:31] their god had sent him and the people
[2:24:33] did fear before the lord
[2:24:35] that's the right attitude
[2:24:39] then spake haggai the lord's messenger
[2:24:42] amen then spake haggai i the lord's
[2:24:45] messenger in the lord's message
[2:24:49] then spake haggai the prophet messen the
[2:24:52] messenger in the lord's message
[2:24:56] he said unto the people saying i am with
[2:24:59] you saith the lord
[2:25:00] do you realize what he's telling you i
[2:25:03] am with you
[2:25:05] just
[2:25:06] act upon what i've asked you to do
[2:25:08] and don't fear the consequences that the
[2:25:10] devil is wanting to build up as a
[2:25:12] mountain before you
[2:25:20] he's asking give us our whole self to it
[2:25:23] like the rich young ruler that rich
[2:25:25] young businessman
[2:25:28] brother brown called him that he's
[2:25:29] speaking to the businessman's
[2:25:30] conventions
[2:25:32] rich young ruler he said yeah he said
[2:25:34] but there's one thing they'll lack us
[2:25:36] even the lord loved him
[2:25:38] but you're lacking one thing
[2:25:40] you've got your eyes on your money
[2:25:42] you've got your eyes in your business
[2:25:44] and you're not willing to give it up
[2:25:48] but i'm calling and you asked me about
[2:25:50] eternal life but he refused to follow
[2:25:53] the leadership of the person of eternal
[2:25:56] life christ
[2:25:57] don't let us come to that place
[2:26:00] let us consider and i'm including myself
[2:26:03] brother sis you have to realize not
[2:26:04] pointing anybody i'm pointing myself
[2:26:07] consider your ways
[2:26:09] i'm speaking to everybody in here
[2:26:12] what's your motive and objective for
[2:26:13] doing what you're doing
[2:26:17] is the is the word have the headship
[2:26:19] over the whole thing is it for the word
[2:26:21] headship is it for that or is it for
[2:26:23] self or is it for something else
[2:26:27] i'm gonna finish with the scripture here
[2:26:30] but let me just read on further
[2:26:32] and so and then the lord stirred up the
[2:26:34] spirit of jezebel urged because jerubal
[2:26:38] stirred him up
[2:26:39] the message ought to stir us up
[2:26:42] it ought to get us to consider ourselves
[2:26:43] we ought to go to prayer and then say
[2:26:45] lord show me what am i am i doing you
[2:26:48] search me lord search me see if there be
[2:26:51] anything in me that is standing before
[2:26:53] your way and what you will for me to do
[2:26:58] that'll be our prayer
[2:27:00] that would be exactly a desperate call
[2:27:02] to god
[2:27:04] because i'm telling you the devil is a
[2:27:06] tricker
[2:27:07] you'll lay a snare every way you can
[2:27:09] he'll get you to believe something it's
[2:27:10] not the truth he'll get you to reason it
[2:27:13] out he'll get you to reason it forth
[2:27:18] amen and reason why you can't do
[2:27:21] what the lord's called you to do
[2:27:23] and give yourself over to it completely
[2:27:26] so that so that it may prosper
[2:27:34] i want you to stay where he's called you
[2:27:36] to stay absolutely right but god is not
[2:27:39] an author of confusion
[2:27:43] amen
[2:27:44] amen if he called you to be a certain
[2:27:46] sort of thing then give your whole self
[2:27:48] to it and let him lead you in that
[2:27:50] if he called you over this is something
[2:27:51] else let him lead you in that
[2:27:53] don't try to mix the two
[2:27:55] it don't mix
[2:27:57] don't try to mix the word with your own
[2:27:58] ideas your own feelings and your own
[2:28:00] senses
[2:28:01] and your imagination don't you add to it
[2:28:03] or take from it you just go back to god
[2:28:05] and say you say well i don't know if i
[2:28:07] agree with you brother david you don't
[2:28:08] have to agree with me but the one thing
[2:28:09] i am asking you to do is go before the
[2:28:11] lord and say lord what is that your will
[2:28:14] what you would you have searched me
[2:28:16] search me
[2:28:18] and let him search you
[2:28:22] then stand up
[2:28:23] say lord i believe what you've said to
[2:28:25] me no matter what my wife husband thinks
[2:28:29] this job that job some other job or
[2:28:31] whatever it is maybe if i'm to do a job
[2:28:33] that i'll do the best i very best i can
[2:28:35] then you've called me to that if you
[2:28:37] called me to another job and to take
[2:28:38] care of it let me get in my place
[2:28:40] because we need to come to that place of
[2:28:42] complete unity and dependency and
[2:28:45] complete submission to the word of god
[2:28:48] for the house of god to prosper
[2:28:50] and i'm not saying everybody's going to
[2:28:51] believe the same thing it won't but i'm
[2:28:53] telling you every position every
[2:28:55] born-again christian everyone that's
[2:28:57] born of the spirit of god every elect
[2:28:58] seed has got to come to that position
[2:29:04] where you have one focus
[2:29:06] not a blurred focus one focus
[2:29:09] i will do your bidding lord i don't care
[2:29:11] where you use me where you send me i'll
[2:29:13] give everything i can to that call
[2:29:17] and you mean it
[2:29:25] i don't care what you think about it or
[2:29:26] what i think about it or anybody else
[2:29:28] thinks about it
[2:29:30] consider our ways
[2:29:36] and the spirit of joshua son of jose
[2:29:38] deck the high priest
[2:29:39] and they and and and uh and the spirit
[2:29:42] of all the remnant of the people and
[2:29:44] they came and did the work in the house
[2:29:46] of the lord of hosts their god
[2:29:50] there you are now the word of god would
[2:29:52] prosper
[2:29:53] now the house will be built
[2:29:56] and you'll see the works of god manifest
[2:29:59] amen we're not looking for prosperity
[2:30:01] and money to flow in and numbers and
[2:30:03] numbers no it may go the other way
[2:30:06] less and less
[2:30:08] but it'll prosper spiritually
[2:30:13] if we let it go undone
[2:30:15] then what is it is it the house that's
[2:30:18] left undone
[2:30:19] because we got other things
[2:30:22] we're trying to divide ourselves with
[2:30:24] i speak to myself i have to deal with
[2:30:26] this you have to too
[2:30:28] are we going to follow our perfect
[2:30:30] headship
[2:30:31] which is a kingdom in you the word in
[2:30:34] you is your kinship
[2:30:40] i'm just going to get this off my heart
[2:30:41] i just told you it's going to be a
[2:30:42] little scratchy
[2:30:44] but that's the truth you do with it as
[2:30:46] you will to do and i want you to follow
[2:30:48] the lord's will
[2:30:50] i'm not asking you to follow a man's
[2:30:51] will follow his will
[2:30:54] but i pray god
[2:30:56] if you are build fulfill the holy ghost
[2:30:58] you're going to have a sensitivity of
[2:31:00] what spirit around you is trying to
[2:31:01] influence you i guarantee it you're not
[2:31:04] going to come under a false spirit
[2:31:08] you're going to recognize that spirit
[2:31:09] and what it's doing
[2:31:11] and what are you going to do there's got
[2:31:12] to be raising a standard the holy ghost
[2:31:14] himself will raise a standard against it
[2:31:18] amen
[2:31:20] okay i know i'm taking time and i'm just
[2:31:22] about
[2:31:26] done verse 3 of chapter 2 says who is
[2:31:29] among you that saw the house in her
[2:31:31] first glory
[2:31:33] who who was it among you that seen jesus
[2:31:35] christ
[2:31:37] in her first glory and see it repeated
[2:31:39] again today
[2:31:41] have we come to that again
[2:31:43] see
[2:31:46] we didn't see that in his first but a
[2:31:47] prophet told us and let us look through
[2:31:49] his eyes and saw that bride marching the
[2:31:51] first and saw the same one come back
[2:31:53] again
[2:31:56] is that right
[2:31:59] saw her in her first glory and when she
[2:32:01] come to the in her time at this time we
[2:32:03] saw her in her glory again what is the
[2:32:05] bride's glory himself
[2:32:07] christ himself
[2:32:13] amen
[2:32:16] yet now be strong those rubble verse 4
[2:32:18] saith the lord and stronghold joshua son
[2:32:20] of jose deck the high priest be strong
[2:32:23] although you people of the land saith
[2:32:25] the lord and work for i am with you
[2:32:28] saith the lord of hosts
[2:32:31] that ought to be enough
[2:32:34] amen
[2:32:35] amen now
[2:32:42] just look at the scripture here real
[2:32:44] fast if i want to go there or not
[2:32:46] i don't
[2:33:03] remember said a double-minded man is
[2:33:05] unstable in his ways
[2:33:06] don't let that man think he's going to
[2:33:08] receive anything of the lord see he's
[2:33:10] uncertain of his position
[2:33:13] your focus is divided your vision is
[2:33:15] blurred
[2:33:16] your eye is not single
[2:33:21] it's not
[2:33:22] we're not de-christianizing anybody i'm
[2:33:24] just saying
[2:33:25] don't let it become blurred
[2:33:28] god refocus
[2:33:30] let our focus be single
[2:33:35] and then you follow what the lord shows
[2:33:37] you to do
[2:33:39] and don't you give way to nothing else
[2:33:43] amen
[2:33:44] because then
[2:33:46] everyone is in their position in the
[2:33:48] body
[2:33:49] then you'll see the body of christ which
[2:33:51] is the house of god prosper amen
[2:33:55] amen there's not going to be a confusion
[2:33:57] don't be a confusion spirit
[2:34:00] something is not right when there's that
[2:34:02] confusion god is not the author of that
[2:34:04] everyone in their position doing exactly
[2:34:06] what the lord showed them to do and
[2:34:08] given themselves to it well you make
[2:34:10] mistakes yes but the mistakes will be
[2:34:12] identified and corrected and you'll
[2:34:14] answer to that and quicken and i say
[2:34:17] answer me you mean you respond to it the
[2:34:20] correction
[2:34:23] then you'll see a house then you'll see
[2:34:25] a christ then you'll see things moving
[2:34:27] amen
[2:34:29] and sin can't even come back to the door
[2:34:31] except it be uncovered
[2:34:34] that's right
[2:34:36] amen you want to see god act that way
[2:34:39] i'm not sure i want to come to a church
[2:34:40] like that well then that's your choice
[2:34:43] but light when it's preached is going to
[2:34:45] uncover
[2:34:46] wrong
[2:34:48] and when you walk in the light as he is
[2:34:49] in the light it's a glorious liberty for
[2:34:52] where the spirit of the lord is there's
[2:34:54] liberty
[2:35:01] he told peter even though peter casts
[2:35:03] out devils and and and he'll cast out
[2:35:05] devils and everything before he was
[2:35:07] converted
[2:35:09] amen don't take that as your evidence
[2:35:13] amen but i'll say it on the other hand
[2:35:16] if he could do that under a
[2:35:18] non-conversion what do we ought to do
[2:35:19] under conversion
[2:35:22] is that right we have a word that's nigh
[2:35:24] even in thy mouth what is that word
[2:35:26] that's not even in the mouth the word of
[2:35:28] faith
[2:35:33] amen and you know when that faith is
[2:35:35] spoken it's not your faith it's god's
[2:35:37] faith and heavens and earth will pass
[2:35:38] away but that has to happen
[2:35:42] it's because it's not your makeup your
[2:35:44] idea and you're impressed it's
[2:35:46] absolutely the revealing of the word
[2:35:48] himself in your mouth and you speak it
[2:35:50] god reveals this thought and is still a
[2:35:52] thought until you speak it
[2:35:54] and it's got to happen
[2:35:56] that's the church of the living god
[2:36:02] okay
[2:36:06] let's go to let's go to saint john 21

[2:37:11] hide not thy face far from me and and
[2:37:13] let i'm putting out thy servant away in
[2:37:15] anger
[2:37:16] thou hast been my help leave me not
[2:37:19] neither forsake me o god my salvation
[2:37:22] when my father and mother forsake me
[2:37:23] then the lord will take me up teach me
[2:37:26] thy way oh lord and lead me in a plain
[2:37:29] path
[2:37:30] because
[2:37:31] of mine enemies deliver me not over to
[2:37:34] the will of mine enemies for false
[2:37:36] witnesses are risen up against me and
[2:37:37] such as breathe out curate i had fainted
[2:37:40] lest i had believed to see the goodness
[2:37:42] of the lord in the land of the living
[2:37:45] wait on the lord be of good courage and
[2:37:47] he shall strengthen thine heart wait i
[2:37:49] say
[2:37:50] on the lord
[2:37:52] amen
[2:37:53] john
[2:37:57] you're the only one that's going to
[2:37:58] answer this question
[2:38:01] but i'm going to leave it with you
[2:38:03] and we could spend some time on it
[2:38:05] that guy's going to spend a whole
[2:38:06] message on it but i think we'll just end
[2:38:08] it right here
[2:38:09] it's john 20
[2:38:11] 20 john 21 22.
[2:38:25] jesus and this is peter here peter let
[2:38:29] me just i don't mean 22. i'm sorry

[2:38:44] so when they had dined this is at the at
[2:38:47] the lake they said cast their head on
[2:38:50] the other side they realized it was
[2:38:52] christ speaking because
[2:38:53] peter was kind of discouraged he said
[2:38:55] well
[2:38:56] he said i guess it's over with i think
[2:38:58] i'll go back fishing
[2:39:04] you know one time he did follow jesus
[2:39:06] and gave up his fishing
[2:39:09] and i'll make you fishers of men
[2:39:11] but now you know what's going to happen
[2:39:13] now i guess well i know how to fish so
[2:39:15] i'll go back to fishing
[2:39:16] but watch what here's here's god and
[2:39:20] jesus in verse 15. so when they had
[2:39:22] dying jesus saith the peter he didn't
[2:39:23] say it to the rest of them maybe they
[2:39:25] heard i don't know but he was addressing
[2:39:27] peter
[2:39:28] and i want you to know that he's
[2:39:30] addressing each of us this morning
[2:39:34] simon son of jonas
[2:39:38] lovest thou me
[2:39:40] more than these
[2:39:45] these
[2:39:47] can be them
[2:39:49] this
[2:39:50] that
[2:39:52] we know what it was in peter's case he's
[2:39:54] being called
[2:39:57] as a pastor
[2:39:59] as an apostle
[2:40:01] over the sheep
[2:40:03] amen are you with me
[2:40:08] but he said he asked peter lovett thou
[2:40:10] me
[2:40:12] more
[2:40:14] maybe he was fishing
[2:40:17] he could have been a fisherman
[2:40:19] maybe or something else
[2:40:22] but i you have to know what these mean
[2:40:27] loveth thou me but the question is
[2:40:29] do you love me
[2:40:31] so much
[2:40:32] that you would forsake all and follow me
[2:40:35] in what i ask you to do
[2:40:38] maybe he's asked you now maybe he hasn't
[2:40:40] maybe he will
[2:40:44] but loveth thou me
[2:40:46] i say i'm taking it personally to david
[2:40:48] love us thou me more than these david
