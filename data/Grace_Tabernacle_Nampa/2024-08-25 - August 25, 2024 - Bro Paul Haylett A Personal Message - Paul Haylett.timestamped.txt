[30:26] made those words which just struck me so

[32:37] amen hallelujah let's just stand and
[32:41] just take a
[32:43] moment I think that just an inspiration
[32:46] of my heart there as I was still seated
[32:48] there let's just take a moment lift our
[32:51] hands and thank the Lord for what he's
[32:53] done for us he has done so much for us
[32:56] and I think it's just good for us just
[32:59] to just come you say it's not very
[33:01] spontaneous brother Paul but you know
[33:04] sometimes uh just uh putting out that
[33:07] effort to say Lord I thank you I thank
[33:11] you Lord Jesus for your grace your mercy
[33:13] Satan would come in this hour Lord he's
[33:15] doing everything he can to disrupt the
[33:17] bride of Christ but Lord for us to be
[33:20] raised in Heavenly places in you we must
[33:23] be in you and you must be in us and Lord
[33:26] we're here today to say thank you for
[33:28] that Lord just ask you to speak to every
[33:31] need Lord many requests no doubt that
[33:33] are not even pinned or posted today but
[33:36] father we would ask you Lord just to
[33:38] come and move on behalf of the Saints
[33:40] may your presence come and move us today
[33:43] by your Holy Spirit we say thank you
[33:45] from the depths of our hearts Lord and
[33:47] we bless your Holy Name hallelujah
[33:50] hallelujah hallelujah let's turn in
[33:52] Revelations 3 uh verse 18- 22
[33:58] and uh we will draw out of this um it
[34:02] goes right into a quote I'm going to
[34:04] read also has this uh scripture in it uh
[34:09] Revelations 3 and18 I counsel thee to
[34:13] buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[34:16] thou mayest be rich and white rment that
[34:18] thou mayest be clothed that the shame of
[34:21] thy nakedness do not appear so we
[34:25] recognize my brother and sister in the
[34:27] world we're are living today they have
[34:29] no shame of their nakedness and uh they
[34:32] they don't even recognize in a spiritual
[34:34] context that that they are not clothed
[34:38] by the word and uh so it is there that
[34:41] the shame of thy nakedness does not
[34:43] appear and anoint thine eyes with isav
[34:46] that thou mayest see as many as I love I
[34:49] rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore
[34:52] and repent behold I stand at the door
[34:55] and knock and if any man hear my voice
[34:58] and open the door I will come into him
[35:02] and will sck with him and he with me
[35:05] when I read verse 20 I often think about
[35:08] those Saints on the road to we at the
[35:11] beckoning our lord Jesus went in and SED
[35:14] with them but if they had not beckoned
[35:17] him he would have passed on his way but
[35:21] there was something real burning in
[35:23] their hearts and they said hey you you
[35:25] need to come in we need more of this
[35:28] fellowship please come and sit with us
[35:31] and it was there in the breaking of the
[35:34] bread amen Revelation come he revealed
[35:39] himself to them and my
[35:45] imagine they're just scuffing their feet
[35:47] along on the road to
[35:50] Emmas they're
[35:52] dejected they feel like something's
[35:56] malfunctioned and at the breaking of the
[35:59] bread now I just put it this way it's
[36:01] how I see it in the scripture they
[36:03] skipped their way back where they
[36:06] drugged their feet to go they were full
[36:09] of joy and they rushed back to tell of a
[36:14] revelation God had given them now I
[36:17] don't want this to sound too harsh but
[36:19] my brother and sister we have
[36:20] Revelations come God speaks to our heart
[36:23] about things in our lives and we just
[36:25] keep on dragging our feet something's
[36:27] wrong
[36:28] something's wrong we should have a joy
[36:31] in our heart we should be so full of of
[36:35] this presence that God has given us in
[36:38] this hour that that we go through the
[36:40] ups and downs of life let's face it amen
[36:43] I always feel better when the sun is
[36:45] shining amen now I say this kind of in a
[36:49] little bit of a pun but uh just visiting
[36:51] with some brothers uh from uh the state
[36:54] of Washington uh
[36:57] the sister Alice lives there she knows
[36:59] what I'm talking about and you need to
[37:02] fall in love with liquid Sunshine that's
[37:05] what you need to fall in love with that
[37:07] but you see I'm glad God called me here
[37:09] I don't know what he how he called you
[37:11] but I'm glad that I'm here because
[37:14] liquid sunshine just doesn't work for me
[37:17] I need the real
[37:20] sunshine and when you know Sister Jerry
[37:23] bought me a a lamp here a few years ago
[37:25] and I forget what they call them I call
[37:27] it my depression lamp amen and that's
[37:29] the one you sit under at Vitamin D
[37:32] whatever it is that lamp shining on you
[37:34] and and I can just does feel good
[37:36] sitting under that lamp and then I broke
[37:39] it and I haven't had one for quite a
[37:41] while and and I I think that's why I'm
[37:43] so
[37:45] depressed but look at this my brother
[37:47] and sister we have a
[37:51] light we have a
[37:53] presence that nothing in this world can
[37:56] take away amen let's not let the cares
[38:00] of Life beat us
[38:02] down take a hold to the word Let It
[38:05] Shine Let It Shine Let It Shine don't
[38:10] hide it under a bushel no Let It Shine
[38:15] one of these days we ought to have the
[38:16] kids sing that to us
[38:18] amen as many as I love I rebuke and
[38:20] chasen be zealous therefore and repent
[38:23] behold I stand at the door and knock and
[38:25] if any man hear my voice and open the
[38:27] door I will come into him and will Su
[38:29] with him and he with me to him that
[38:32] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[38:34] in my throne even as I also overcome and
[38:37] I'm set down with my father in his
[38:39] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[38:43] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[38:46] Heavenly Father we ask you to come every
[38:48] prayer request every unspoken request
[38:51] every need father Lord you are here Lord
[38:54] and we are more than capable to
[38:56] withstand the onslaught of the enemy
[38:59] Lord we have the word we have you in our
[39:02] life now father we just need to let that
[39:05] Joy shine forth father let you uh speak
[39:08] to our hearts in such a fashion Lord
[39:11] they experienced on the road to emus
[39:14] father that was not just a little try to
[39:17] encourage but the word was being broken
[39:19] and father I believe in this day that
[39:21] we're living in the word is still being
[39:23] broken it is still being open to us it
[39:26] is still given to us to Su upon it now
[39:29] father I ask you to bless this service
[39:31] today every need every circumstance bind
[39:35] every contrary spirit and loose the Holy
[39:37] Spirit I pray in the name of Jesus
[39:39] Christ amen you may be seated
[39:43] amen now I don't say this is a poll but
[39:46] don't you just love your church age book
[39:48] amen I believe when I read the church
[39:51] age book that it it uh uh maybe I didn't
[39:54] word that quite right it's not I believe
[39:56] I know that it actually opens up many
[39:59] other things to me I I when I read it I
[40:02] I start to realize there's certain
[40:05] aspects of the message that we read or
[40:07] scripture that we read and uh we read
[40:11] that in you might say our interpretation
[40:14] our thinking uh uh what we've
[40:16] experienced in life and brother Bram
[40:18] says here in the church age book uh that
[40:22] uh he says it's a scripture here again
[40:24] uh behold I stand at the door and knock
[40:26] and if any any man hear my voice and
[40:28] open the door I will come into him amen
[40:32] now my brother and sister I just want
[40:34] you to answer this to yourself today did
[40:37] you open the door amen there's the key
[40:41] right there it's not a matter whether
[40:42] he's knocking or not it's now an action
[40:45] that's up to you and I did we open the
[40:48] door or did we leave the little chain
[40:51] you know how it is uh some residents
[40:53] have it motel rooms the little chain
[40:55] that slides in the slot only allows the
[40:57] door to be opened so far you might look
[41:00] through that crack and see Jesus my
[41:02] brother and sister but that is not him
[41:04] coming in to S with you you have to
[41:06] completely open the door and so it's
[41:09] there he says I'll come into him and Su
[41:11] with him and he with me to him that
[41:13] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[41:16] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[41:20] am sat down with my father and his
[41:22] throne now my brother and sister we are
[41:25] this is such an incredible scripture to
[41:27] me
[41:28] because he has now given to us a glimpse
[41:31] of the reward of being an overcomer now
[41:35] I I just uh want you guys to break your
[41:37] nice quiet studious thoughts this
[41:39] morning and kind of stretch a little bit
[41:42] uh get up on the edge of the nest put
[41:44] your little uh claws in there and let's
[41:46] flap some wings amen and just let the
[41:48] Lord know that we're going to praise him
[41:50] today but aren't you happy today my
[41:53] brother and sister that the reward to
[41:56] the Overcomer can we say I'm an
[41:58] overcomer amen the reward to the
[42:00] Overcomer my brother and sister it's not
[42:03] a fruitless labor but it is a labor that
[42:06] truly has reward in it amen and so here
[42:11] it is brother brandham goes on to say
[42:13] and you can catch that right here in in
[42:15] uh uh the quote there's a great deal of
[42:18] confusion over this verse because so
[42:20] many personal workers use it in a
[42:23] personal evangelism as though Jesus were
[42:26] at the hearts door of every sinner
[42:28] knocking for admission it would then be
[42:32] said that if the sinner opened the door
[42:34] the Lord would come in but this verse is
[42:36] not talking to individual Sinners amen
[42:40] so you'll see that that it is not so
[42:42] much that that God has come down uh to
[42:46] knock at the door of every sinner now
[42:50] don't get confused because he does come
[42:52] and knock at the door of every sinner
[42:54] but the prophet's talking about the
[42:56] church age here
[42:57] and representing what happens or or the
[43:00] atmosphere of that age so the Lord would
[43:03] come in but the verse is not talking to
[43:05] individuals the whole message is a
[43:10] uh I practiced that word and I can't get
[43:12] it out now summation as does every
[43:15] message in every age in verse 22 it says
[43:18] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[43:20] the spirit saith into the churches so
[43:23] it's not dealing with individuals at
[43:25] this point of time but it's dealing with
[43:28] the churches with the church age that is
[43:31] coming and God has come and certainly in
[43:35] the day that we live in and he has been
[43:37] knocking amen but you'll see that the
[43:40] door not being opened does not bring the
[43:43] presence of Christ in there and so we'll
[43:45] just go on here so this is the message
[43:48] to the Church of the last
[43:50] age this is a condition of the leod dean
[43:54] church as its end nears it is not a
[43:58] personal message to one person it is a
[44:01] spirit telling us where Jesus is Christ
[44:05] has left the church is this not The
[44:08] Logical result or end if the word is put
[44:12] outside for creed Holy Spirit disposed
[44:15] of for popes Bishops presidents
[44:18] counselors Etc and the Savior set aside
[44:21] for a Works program or church joining or
[44:24] some time of conformity and I think
[44:27] Saints one of the worst things we can do
[44:29] is conform to the message we're not here
[44:33] to conform to the message we're here to
[44:36] catch a revelation of the message and
[44:38] when we catch the me Revelation of the
[44:41] message you'll say but I am conforming
[44:44] but if it's by Revelation nothing can
[44:46] take it away from you no other
[44:48] explanation no other circumstance no
[44:51] trial of life no fiery darts of the
[44:54] enemy nothing will take it away from you
[44:56] but if you you just
[44:58] conform sooner or later you'll find an
[45:00] easier path you'll find an easier
[45:04] way and so as he says here uh sometime
[45:09] conformative Church system what more can
[45:11] be done against him see this is what's
[45:15] happening in the religious world today
[45:17] Saints is not just simply a a spirit
[45:21] causing people to interpret and to do
[45:23] this but this is actually a direct
[45:26] assault
[45:27] against our Lord Jesus Christ amen when
[45:30] you refute repudiate or refuse his word
[45:34] that is actually a direct assault
[45:36] against him brother brandham says this
[45:38] is the apostasy this is the falling away
[45:42] this is the open door to the Antichrist
[45:45] for if one came in his father's name
[45:47] Jesus and was not received but rejected
[45:50] then there will come another with his
[45:52] own name liar Pretender and him they
[45:56] will receive
[45:57] John 5:43 the man of sin that son of
[46:00] predition will take over now as we look
[46:03] at this my brother and sister is this
[46:05] not what we see in the world today amen
[46:09] I I try to not focus too much on this
[46:12] but I I was just the other day typed
[46:14] into a search engine about you know
[46:16] truth and and uh the the sharing of the
[46:20] truth and I hope you don't mind my
[46:23] slightly warped humor but you know it
[46:25] brought up a video
[46:27] of a Pentecostal woman
[46:29] preacher and uh she's there in the
[46:32] Pulpit hair about the length of mine uh
[46:35] I'm sorry I just need you to catch an
[46:36] image here I'm not degrading the woman
[46:39] she's just probably living all that she
[46:41] knows but she's there in a pant suit
[46:43] short hair a woman preacher and she's
[46:46] standing in the Pulpit telling a full
[46:48] church we'll settle for nothing less
[46:51] than the whole
[46:54] truth and I don't say that derogatory to
[46:57] them I hope you follow me but you see
[46:59] how subtle Satan has come to take all
[47:02] these different positions and they stand
[47:06] and say we'll stand for nothing less
[47:08] than the truth but
[47:11] not and then right below that search
[47:13] engine said you might also be interested
[47:16] in this and it went on in a whole
[47:19] another little topic that um was the
[47:22] question uh so Jesus said that they
[47:25] should not women should not dress like
[47:27] men and what is the difference a robe is
[47:31] a
[47:32] robe and they explain the scripture
[47:36] away this is the hour we're living in
[47:38] this is what the prophet of God is
[47:40] talking about here that they have come
[47:42] in the very House of God and they have
[47:45] taken his word and they have mollified
[47:48] the people with kind words and
[47:50] intellectual words and Inspirations the
[47:53] people are there saying oh yes that's
[47:55] good I'm fine but my brother and sister
[47:58] it's a spirit that is already been
[48:01] prophesied for the age the day that we
[48:04] live in and it's there and it's now
[48:06] being manifested now let's go on here
[48:09] Matthew 24 mentions signs in the heavens
[48:12] concerning uh this last day just before
[48:15] Jesus comes I wonder if you notice such
[48:17] a sign recently fulfilled as to portray
[48:20] the very truth we've been discussing
[48:22] that truth is that Jesus has been
[48:24] steadily pushed aside and until in the
[48:27] last age he's pushed outside the church
[48:30] recall that in the first age it was
[48:32] almost full orbit uh Church of Truth and
[48:35] he's talking about Sun and the Moon
[48:37] there yet there was little air called
[48:39] the Deeds of the nicians that kept the
[48:41] circle from being full then the next age
[48:44] more Darkness crept in until the ball of
[48:46] light glowed less and darkness covered
[48:49] more of the circle in the third age it
[48:51] was eclipsed still more and in the
[48:53] fourth age which was the Dark Ages the
[48:56] light had all but gone now think on
[48:59] this the church shines in the reflected
[49:02] Light of Christ he is the son can we say
[49:05] Amen the church is the moon and thus
[49:08] this orb of light is the Moon it had
[49:11] decreased from almost a full moon in the
[49:13] first age to a sliver in the fourth age
[49:16] but in the fifth age it began to grow
[49:19] and in the sixth it took a great step of
[49:22] growth forward and in part of the
[49:24] seventh age it was still
[49:28] growing when suddenly it stopped short
[49:30] and waned almost to
[49:34] nothingness what year did the prophet
[49:37] say America would receive Christ or go
[49:41] into
[49:43] judgment
[49:46] 1956 so we see clearly the time that the
[49:50] church was growing there was many signs
[49:53] and wonders powerful moves of God great
[49:55] times of repentance but then it comes to
[49:59] a place they had to make a decision and
[50:02] they made their decision and we don't
[50:04] criticize them for making the decision
[50:06] they made because my brother and sister
[50:08] the prophet of God said it's only the
[50:10] bride of Christ that can receive the
[50:13] revelation of Jesus Christ so it's there
[50:16] that they come to a place that that
[50:18] they've went as far as they can go amen
[50:20] have you ever went for a hike with some
[50:22] friends that are obviously much maybe
[50:25] younger much uh better Fitness whatever
[50:27] it might be and and you just simply come
[50:30] to a place that you say I have to sit
[50:32] down I have to stop right here I'm too
[50:35] tired to go on amen sister Jerry and I
[50:38] was uh with the youth in Ang go Chile uh
[50:41] quite a few years ago and they went on a
[50:43] hike to what is called Eagle Mountain
[50:45] and uh we we're going up there and and
[50:48] uh the deacons all had little
[50:50] radios and um uh they're they're calling
[50:54] on the radio and we can hear them them
[50:57] and they're saying uh uh watch out for
[50:59] brother Paul and sister Jerry they're
[51:01] older and and we don't want to lose them
[51:04] in the forest so watch out for them but
[51:06] the reality was brother Paul and sister
[51:08] Jerry had this sister's handbag and this
[51:11] sister's bag and this bag full of water
[51:13] and this bag over here of some snacks
[51:16] and we had this we look like pack
[51:19] mules but you see my brother and sister
[51:22] what is happening is there is a time
[51:25] that the people feel like because now
[51:28] I'm not judging these people don't
[51:29] misunderstand me but they all felt like
[51:31] because they were dying on this trail
[51:33] that surely we were dying on this Trail
[51:36] but I'll let you know right now this
[51:38] bride of Jesus Christ is not dying in
[51:40] leoa she is Victorious she's an
[51:43] overcomer she has taken the word and
[51:46] she's rising up not declining she's come
[51:49] to a place where God is pouring the
[51:51] strength into her it's not my strength
[51:53] it's not your strength it's his strength
[51:56] that he's pouring out into this bride of
[51:58] this day because he said I will give to
[52:01] the Overcomer and he said and I'm
[52:04] guaranteeing you're an overcomer you
[52:06] know sometimes co-signing a bank loan is
[52:09] not such a good idea but I'm telling you
[52:11] our Lord Jesus Christ come and our
[52:13] Redemption he signed his name our name
[52:16] is there only because we're agreeing
[52:18] with him he is the one that is backing
[52:20] the whole thing he's the one that is the
[52:22] strength and the force and the presence
[52:24] behind the whole thing and this bride
[52:27] that believes is going to be an
[52:29] overcomer because he said so it's not
[52:32] our strength it's not I failed I I must
[52:35] be a loser no my brother and sister when
[52:38] we fail is the time that God can take
[52:42] over he's not waiting for us well you
[52:45] know I'll let them burn their strength
[52:46] then I'll help them finish he can't do a
[52:49] thing for us until we completely rely
[52:52] upon him and if we complete that and let
[52:56] him uh uh uh come and do what he desires
[53:00] to do my brother and sister he takes
[53:02] very good care of us and I believe we
[53:04] can say Amen to that amen so I lost my
[53:09] place door of every sinner uh knocking
[53:12] for admission it would then be said that
[53:14] sinner opened the door the Lord would
[53:16] come in but this verse is not talking to
[53:18] individual Sinners the whole message has
[53:20] a summation as does every message in
[53:24] every
[53:25] age oh my brother and sister it's
[53:28] powerful when you think about that just
[53:31] stop and think about what's happening
[53:33] anybody had a trial this last week amen
[53:36] I think every hand here if we be honest
[53:37] we've had some sort of something that
[53:40] has come amen so what happens my brother
[53:43] and sister is we tend to view ourself in
[53:46] a critical light and God tends to view
[53:49] us as a people he's already purchased
[53:51] he's already uh holds the title deed we
[53:54] look at it as failure he looks at said
[53:56] it is character building amen but what
[53:59] really comes down to the Crux of this is
[54:01] he that hath an ear amen not everyone's
[54:04] going to listen but he that hath an ear
[54:06] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[54:09] so this message uh to the Church of the
[54:12] last age you see as we're coming here
[54:15] it's coming that the church being that
[54:18] reflection and darkness creeping in more
[54:21] and more and
[54:23] more an age the prophet of God said
[54:25] would be
[54:27] otic and it
[54:29] is he didn't say we were exempt from
[54:32] that he didn't say that none of this
[54:35] will affect you in fact the Book of
[54:36] Ecclesiastes says these things happen to
[54:39] the rich and the poor to the righteous
[54:41] and the unrighteous my brother and
[54:42] sister to realize that you're in Warfare
[54:46] and warfare is not predictable to the
[54:48] man who is fighting but it is there that
[54:51] we can express who we are we're not
[54:53] going to sit down on our sword we're not
[54:55] going to sit down and say whatever
[54:57] happens happens we're going to stand up
[54:59] and say yes I am weak and I have been
[55:01] bled I have suffered but I will still
[55:04] fight to the very end that's an
[55:07] overcomer the one that does not give up
[55:09] is the Overcomer not the one with a
[55:11] shiny armor that never had a battle
[55:14] never had a trial always seem to
[55:16] understand and have control of
[55:17] everything that's not the Overcomer the
[55:20] Overcomer will be battles scarred they
[55:23] will be bloody and they will still be
[55:25] standing saying I'm here to serve my God
[55:29] Amen so look the apostasy the falling
[55:32] away this is the open door for the
[55:35] Antichrist I'm just going to paraphrase
[55:37] some of this amen he wasn't received he
[55:40] was he was rejected but you see there's
[55:44] come others who have come the liar The
[55:48] Pretender and you look at this it is
[55:51] there my brother and sister as this
[55:54] comes and the the last eclipse of the
[55:58] moon you can tie it back into history
[56:01] here the the prophet of God it says the
[56:03] last eclipse of the moon was a total
[56:05] eclipse it waned to a total darkness in
[56:08] seven stages in the seventh stage total
[56:11] darkness came as the pope of Rome Paul I
[56:14] 6 went to Palestine to make a holy tour
[56:18] of Jerusalem he was a first pope to ever
[56:21] go to Jerusalem the pope is named Paul I
[56:24] 6 Paul was the first messenger and this
[56:27] man goes by that name notice it was this
[56:30] six or the number of man so taking the
[56:33] name but still being identified under
[56:37] the anointing of being man Amen brother
[56:39] Bram says it's not a coincidence and he
[56:43] went to Jerusalem the moon or the church
[56:45] went into total darkness you see what's
[56:48] happening here is sometimes we we I'm
[56:51] not saying we're deceived or we're we're
[56:53] not doing but we're looking we're
[56:55] looking looking maybe I should say Paul
[56:58] is looking so I don't infringe on any of
[57:01] you we're looking for total darkness out
[57:03] there the prophet of God's telling us
[57:06] total darkness is behind us it's
[57:10] already
[57:12] happened now I want to have you lift a
[57:14] hand again if you feel to do it how many
[57:17] of you fight fight fight seems like it's
[57:20] an endless
[57:23] fight you know why cuz you're in total
[57:27] darkness out
[57:29] there but we're not in total darkness in
[57:33] here we're in the light of the
[57:34] revelation of Jesus Christ in here but
[57:37] when you are walking in this world right
[57:39] now you are surrounded by complete
[57:43] absolute Darkness you say well I I
[57:47] sometimes just feel really low I feel
[57:49] yeah that's what it's like to walk
[57:51] through the darkness my brother and
[57:52] sister amen I I joked about being afraid
[57:55] of the dark here while back here in
[57:57] church and I it was kind of interesting
[57:59] to see a lot of you uh reactions you
[58:02] know some of you put on a bold face but
[58:04] but you know there was a little
[58:05] something there I realized they're
[58:07] afraid of the darkness well I'll tell
[58:08] you it all depends on where you're in
[58:10] the Darkness at if you're
[58:13] unfamiliar places the darkness doesn't
[58:16] bother
[58:18] you praise God I'm Not Afraid of the
[58:20] Dark I can walk out to the car in my
[58:22] driveway in the
[58:24] dark but let's
[58:28] place I see our sister Sarah's not here
[58:31] today Lord touch her but you go hiking
[58:35] brother Adam hunting you go in Far Away
[58:38] places and you know there's mountain
[58:39] lions and you know there's bears and you
[58:41] know whatever you have a whole different
[58:44] approach to walking around in the dark
[58:46] amen you know it's it's a just the
[58:48] atmosphere depends on where it's at and
[58:51] I hope you can follow my little analogy
[58:53] when you're in the house of God you're
[58:55] serving God Faithfully you're there
[58:57] amongst the Saints of like Precious
[58:59] Faith walking in the darkness of this
[59:01] world is not near the challenge when
[59:03] you're by yourself when you have no
[59:05] Fellowship when you're outside and
[59:08] you're facing all of this without any
[59:10] encouragement and the Devil comes in and
[59:12] starts to just nitpick and nibble away
[59:14] at your experience at your Revelation at
[59:17] who you are and my brother and sister
[59:19] that's why the devil likes to isolate
[59:21] people he likes to get them out on their
[59:23] Fringe and then start telling them God
[59:25] didn't send a profet there's no such
[59:27] thing as this there's no such thing as
[59:29] that days of Miracles are passed God
[59:32] doesn't do this that was this and it's
[59:34] there it's just the nitpicking away and
[59:36] when people are isolated spiritually
[59:39] that takes a toll let's not fool
[59:41] ourselves it takes a toll it starts to
[59:44] ease up on us and then pretty soon
[59:46] staying in bed on Sunday morning seems
[59:49] like a very logical thing to
[59:53] do but that's not what the word said
[59:57] the word said don't forsake so you see
[1:00:00] Satan likes to isolate and then once he
[1:00:03] isolates he starts to work on that you
[1:00:06] can watch it in nature how that uh wild
[1:00:09] animals specifically more like coyotes
[1:00:11] and wolves tend to
[1:00:13] hunt they pick one out of the herd
[1:00:16] isolated and then gang up on it amen I
[1:00:21] tell
[1:00:22] you so we see the pope goes to Jerusalem
[1:00:26] the church goes into total
[1:00:30] darkness prophet of God says this is it
[1:00:33] this is the end and the generation shall
[1:00:35] not pass away until all things fulfilled
[1:00:38] even so Lord come quickly now I I've
[1:00:42] I've got through the negative part are
[1:00:44] we all still doing okay amen we'll move
[1:00:46] on into the positive part in the
[1:00:48] busyness of Life anybody very
[1:00:51] busy isn't that strange in the world we
[1:00:53] live in you know it used to be you know
[1:00:56] that people I I I can speak from the
[1:00:58] world of being a farmer it used to be
[1:01:01] farmers were some of the most faithful
[1:01:02] churchgoing people now they Farm seven
[1:01:06] days a week because that's what it takes
[1:01:08] to make
[1:01:10] it but if you have God on your side you
[1:01:13] don't have to farm seven days a week but
[1:01:16] you see they've left Christ on the
[1:01:19] outside now they're doing it under that
[1:01:22] sixth age
[1:01:23] anointing and they're trying to fulfill
[1:01:25] fill it on their own so uh in the
[1:01:30] busyness of life it's easy to forget
[1:01:32] that these things are coming to pass
[1:01:34] we're living life we're working we're
[1:01:36] doing and my brother and sister I
[1:01:38] believe I believe it's all my heart I
[1:01:39] don't have the research to back it up
[1:01:41] but I just believe it that we would be
[1:01:43] stunned if we literally had on Page in
[1:01:46] front of us all of the things that have
[1:01:49] been fulfilled in the scripture since we
[1:01:52] have become adults or been believer
[1:01:57] understand I think it might stun us so
[1:01:59] many little keys in the
[1:02:03] scripture that have been fulfilled we
[1:02:06] didn't even see
[1:02:08] it it would be encouraging to know would
[1:02:10] it but God didn't say you'll serve me
[1:02:13] because you see it coming to pass he
[1:02:16] said you'll serve me because it's in you
[1:02:18] it's in your heart it's in your soul not
[1:02:20] that you have evidence that's why my
[1:02:22] brother and sister we don't want to get
[1:02:24] too caught up now I hope this doesn't
[1:02:26] offend anyone but we see people around
[1:02:29] the message that say I believe the
[1:02:30] message cuz it's Vindicated if it wasn't
[1:02:33] Vindicated would you believe
[1:02:37] it there should be something inside of
[1:02:39] us that is actually the Vindication that
[1:02:42] the soul says Amen to the word of God
[1:02:46] that ought to be what makes it
[1:02:47] believable and livable and desirous to
[1:02:50] us not that we can pull out a long list
[1:02:53] this and this and this and this and this
[1:02:55] my brother and sister that's not what
[1:02:57] it's about it's about that personal
[1:02:59] experience and going back to my title
[1:03:02] today my brother and sister we'll we'll
[1:03:04] run into a little bit of a paradox here
[1:03:06] but you'll find that that uh it makes
[1:03:09] sense okay a personal
[1:03:13] message amen do you realize I can take
[1:03:17] what the prophet of God said and the
[1:03:19] word of God and prove to you amen that
[1:03:23] this message of this day that came and I
[1:03:27] just spoke out of one side of my mouth I
[1:03:30] got to speak out of the other and was
[1:03:36] Vindicated was not Vindicated to the
[1:03:38] world it wasn't Vindicated to message
[1:03:42] churches it was Vindicated to
[1:03:46] you that's what God was doing he was
[1:03:50] proving to you it's not now pardon me
[1:03:54] for using the word or
[1:03:57] organization it just seems to be the
[1:03:59] word that comes to my
[1:04:01] mind was not proven to the organization
[1:04:03] of the message it was not proven to the
[1:04:06] churches of the message it was proven to
[1:04:11] you because there'll come a time the
[1:04:14] prophet of God prophesied that the doors
[1:04:16] will be
[1:04:17] closed amen they have a hard time
[1:04:19] turning this one into a warehouse unless
[1:04:21] they plan on packing everything in but
[1:04:23] it won't stop them from shutting it down
[1:04:27] amen you know when we bought the church
[1:04:29] the people who looked at it right before
[1:04:31] us the only people who looked at it
[1:04:32] before us wanted to make a daycare out
[1:04:34] of
[1:04:35] this and so there's lots of uses that
[1:04:38] they can they can use it for but I
[1:04:41] believe we'll see that come to pass that
[1:04:44] the day will come that they will just
[1:04:46] say no we have determined that you're
[1:04:48] preaching hate that you're preaching
[1:04:51] discontent doing all these things and
[1:04:53] those things will come to pass and if
[1:04:55] we're not careful we're so busy looking
[1:04:57] forward at what's going to take place
[1:04:59] before the coming of the Lord that we
[1:05:01] have missed all these hundreds of things
[1:05:03] that the Lord has done already in our
[1:05:06] midst in our families in this body of
[1:05:09] Believers we need to get clarity to
[1:05:13] realize God never stopped moving he's
[1:05:16] not waiting for a certain Bell to chime
[1:05:19] a certain thing he's moving God's moving
[1:05:22] God's moving he's never stopped moving
[1:05:24] my brother and sister
[1:05:26] because the word will not wait for
[1:05:28] anything or anyone amen hallelujah so we
[1:05:34] see this it's coming right before our
[1:05:36] eyes now brother brandham gives some
[1:05:38] clarity here when he said this passage
[1:05:40] is not to the individual but to an age a
[1:05:43] church as the whole and we see that
[1:05:46] coming to pass amen all kinds
[1:05:51] of
[1:05:53] lunacy that would qualify lunacy
[1:05:56] taking
[1:06:01] place you see this also fits what the
[1:06:04] prophet told us the world is gathering
[1:06:07] in a
[1:06:08] building and they call it a house of God
[1:06:11] brother brandham said it's a
[1:06:13] lodge and so we're seeing that coming to
[1:06:16] pass today and we have to be but now on
[1:06:19] a really move to the good stuff you know
[1:06:21] there has been a paradigm shift amen
[1:06:24] have have you guys experienced the
[1:06:25] Paradigm Shift amen where we believe the
[1:06:28] message kind of coasted along you know
[1:06:30] and then a paradigm shift come and we
[1:06:33] realize it's later than we think amen
[1:06:36] it's a time for us to get serious about
[1:06:38] serving God we know it's true it's been
[1:06:41] confirmed in our own heart mind and soul
[1:06:44] and it's time for us to get serious
[1:06:46] about this and then people come and they
[1:06:48] want to know what happened to you I'll
[1:06:50] tell you what happened to you the Holy
[1:06:52] Ghost is what happened to us it's a move
[1:06:54] of God Chang ing Our Lives getting us
[1:06:57] ready because the Lamb's wife hath made
[1:06:59] herself ready she says I'm not going to
[1:07:01] wait till the last minute I'm going to
[1:07:03] get everything in order so that when I
[1:07:06] hear behold the bridegroom cometh that I
[1:07:08] don't have to fuss over this I caught a
[1:07:11] revelation of what is in the word amen
[1:07:14] this is not a man's Revelation this is a
[1:07:16] revelation that come from God the
[1:07:18] prophet of God laid out these little
[1:07:20] things in these cute little stories
[1:07:22] don't you just love the stories the
[1:07:23] prophet shared such as the the the armor
[1:07:26] meat Packer son and and the little wash
[1:07:29] girl you know and and he says I'm coming
[1:07:32] back for you is that sound familiar amen
[1:07:35] I'm coming back for you sounds very
[1:07:37] familiar to me my brother and sister
[1:07:39] it's a promise that he made and it will
[1:07:42] come to pass she believed it she spent
[1:07:45] her evenings sitting there sewing that
[1:07:47] gown and I don't know by Revelation she
[1:07:50] knew the day somehow something had come
[1:07:53] to her and while they they are all
[1:07:56] mocking her and they're all doing she's
[1:07:58] standing on the front porch with maybe
[1:08:00] just nothing but a little case that had
[1:08:02] the most personal of things there and
[1:08:04] she's standing on the porch and they're
[1:08:06] ridiculing her until they hear the
[1:08:10] rumble now there's no time at that point
[1:08:13] my brother and sister to run find
[1:08:16] oil there's no time at that place to say
[1:08:19] you know what give me a moment I'll sew
[1:08:21] my own wedding garment no that season's
[1:08:24] passed that season's being behind us and
[1:08:27] Satan would so
[1:08:30] subtly are any procrastinators
[1:08:35] here you know I'll just let you know
[1:08:37] just how this works there's
[1:08:40] procrastinators
[1:08:42] here
[1:08:44] yeah I had a friend once most
[1:08:47] industrious man I think I ever met in my
[1:08:52] life he said you know I used to say ah
[1:08:55] I'll do it
[1:08:57] tomorrow and his
[1:09:00] father-in-law would tell
[1:09:02] him one of these days there won't be a
[1:09:06] tomorrow and he wasn't speaking in
[1:09:07] religious terms one of these days there
[1:09:09] won't be a tomorrow you need to take
[1:09:10] care of business
[1:09:12] today and then his father-in-law got
[1:09:15] crippled and he realized this robust
[1:09:18] strong man one day poof Works no
[1:09:22] longer and that was he was actually
[1:09:24] reason Young when that took place and he
[1:09:27] said I will do today what I need to do
[1:09:30] today and he found out it wasn't any
[1:09:32] more
[1:09:33] work this is the point I want to get to
[1:09:36] you know it's no more work to do it
[1:09:40] today than it is to do it
[1:09:45] tomorrow it takes the same amount of
[1:09:49] preparation to be
[1:09:51] ready and in that Satan would love to
[1:09:54] make us procrastinate
[1:09:56] ators amen so here it is the parad shift
[1:09:59] taking place it's no longer God speaking
[1:10:02] to a
[1:10:04] church no longer just speaking something
[1:10:06] to an age but the message to this age
[1:10:10] has become a personal message to his
[1:10:13] bride now you know uh there's the little
[1:10:19] things that the prophet of God shares
[1:10:20] with
[1:10:21] us speaking about you know the love
[1:10:25] letters that would be mailed to him and
[1:10:28] and his wife would be writing in there
[1:10:30] that she had put the kids to bed she'
[1:10:34] done the laundry folded the laundry done
[1:10:36] all of these things brother Brown says
[1:10:38] I'm reading between the lines and I see
[1:10:41] that everything that she's saying there
[1:10:43] is I love you and I miss you and and
[1:10:47] he's reading that now if you and I pick
[1:10:49] up that letter and we just look at that
[1:10:52] letter it says H well I guess she had
[1:10:54] nothing better to do than to tell them
[1:10:56] she does
[1:10:58] laundry and of course they're married so
[1:11:01] you know this some of these things are
[1:11:03] going to you know be shared you know I
[1:11:05] got the kids to bed yep they're you know
[1:11:08] his kids as much as her kids and you
[1:11:11] know done this and done that but really
[1:11:13] as the prophet of God explains it to us
[1:11:15] because he gives us insight to this this
[1:11:18] is really a love story
[1:11:20] unfolding she's saying I love you and
[1:11:24] the children and love you and we miss
[1:11:27] you and we want you back and we're
[1:11:29] looking for your return and and it's all
[1:11:32] in that letter that a stranger reading
[1:11:35] it would not get and we are in this day
[1:11:38] I'm sorry to say this kind of direct
[1:11:40] where people don't think that in the
[1:11:42] message that reading between the lines
[1:11:44] was for a prophet only if it was only
[1:11:46] for a prophet he could have kept it to
[1:11:48] himself and not confuse the water but it
[1:11:50] wasn't to a prophet only it was a love
[1:11:53] letter that was sent to the church and
[1:11:56] in that love letter you and I anointed
[1:11:58] to read between those lines are
[1:12:01] realizing this is a personal message to
[1:12:04] me amen not to the bride or the church
[1:12:07] any longer Saints we're beyond that this
[1:12:09] is not about you and the message this is
[1:12:12] about you and Jesus Christ this is no
[1:12:15] longer about our church and what our
[1:12:17] church does it is between you and Jesus
[1:12:21] Christ period And when we read between
[1:12:24] those lines we start to realize I I
[1:12:27] understand I I am I am missing my Lord
[1:12:30] Jesus Christ I I want to see him I want
[1:12:32] to be closer to him and I say Lord help
[1:12:35] us amen so this message to this age has
[1:12:40] went from just a declaration of
[1:12:43] doctrines and
[1:12:47] theology I was listening a little bit to
[1:12:50] a minister I I won't even name
[1:12:53] names and uh it preach ing a phenomenal
[1:12:56] service and somebody wrote in the
[1:13:00] comments oh what a wonderful Thunders
[1:13:07] message okay if that's what you got out
[1:13:09] of it he is speaking with authority with
[1:13:11] strength you believe you got to take it
[1:13:13] back to a Doctrine that's what they were
[1:13:14] trying to do those others chimed in on
[1:13:16] it we we're re reinforcing a Doctrine
[1:13:19] we're reinforcing our thought you missed
[1:13:22] it that was a personal
[1:13:25] expression from God to you amen a
[1:13:30] personal message my brother and sister
[1:13:32] not a calling together of a great group
[1:13:34] now this is going to sound pretty crass
[1:13:36] and I hope you don't get offended by
[1:13:38] this but my brother and sister you got
[1:13:40] to take care of your own self you got to
[1:13:43] take care of your relationship you got
[1:13:45] to take care of your life and your
[1:13:47] family I can't take care of it for you
[1:13:50] it is impossible for me and it is
[1:13:52] impossible the same for you to my family
[1:13:55] this becomes personal you can't get the
[1:13:57] token in your house without you doing it
[1:14:01] the preacher can't bring the token and
[1:14:03] deposit it in your house you deposit the
[1:14:06] token in your house amen and how do you
[1:14:09] do that you start reading between the
[1:14:11] lines and realize this is Christ talking
[1:14:15] to you amen he's using another voice he
[1:14:18] might be using whatever it might be but
[1:14:21] it's God talking to you not you my
[1:14:24] brother and sister hoping that your
[1:14:26] pastor can do something for you but it's
[1:14:29] the Holy Spirit coming in set an
[1:14:31] atmosphere that the Holy Spirit speaks
[1:14:34] to your heart gives you the answers you
[1:14:36] need gives you the strength you need
[1:14:38] because this is a personal message amen
[1:14:43] if not we will become another
[1:14:48] denomination and the prophet of God said
[1:14:50] this
[1:14:52] message will not denominate
[1:14:57] if it becomes
[1:14:59] Collective we will
[1:15:01] denominate but if it's at the personal
[1:15:04] level I don't like saying it this way it
[1:15:07] sounds a little harsh I probably sound a
[1:15:09] little harsh this morning do I okay
[1:15:13] thank
[1:15:15] you but you see my brother and
[1:15:20] sister it's coming down so narrow edged
[1:15:24] right
[1:15:27] if we make it a church or
[1:15:31] group we're on the wrong
[1:15:35] side he didn't come to save the church
[1:15:39] he come to save
[1:15:40] you and he
[1:15:43] will he has Can someone say amen amen so
[1:15:49] you
[1:15:51] know a love letter means a lot more when
[1:15:54] the person it's intended for reads
[1:15:57] it
[1:16:00] yeah I I I'll just share just a little
[1:16:02] bit off to the side here you know Sister
[1:16:05] Jerry has this great big box hid out in
[1:16:06] our house it's got all these love
[1:16:09] letters and one day she'd cleaning and
[1:16:11] pulled this box out and I started
[1:16:13] thumbing through it and I I was
[1:16:18] like hope you catch the pun I was
[1:16:23] appalled how bold old I
[1:16:27] wasbe somebody dated my daughter and
[1:16:30] wrote letters like this I'd slap his
[1:16:32] head off if I knew
[1:16:33] that but you
[1:16:35] see I was wanting to convey a message to
[1:16:39] this
[1:16:40] girl that she had no doubt that I was in
[1:16:44] love with
[1:16:48] her no doubt do we have any
[1:16:53] doubts we should
[1:16:56] the letter is very strong it's very
[1:16:59] straightforward I redeemed you I've made
[1:17:03] the way for you I shed my blood for you
[1:17:05] I've forgiven you of every
[1:17:08] transgression nothing will be held
[1:17:10] against you my brother and sister he's
[1:17:13] made it so clear to us who we are it's a
[1:17:17] personal
[1:17:21] message there was a brother one time
[1:17:23] shared a little deal and he was making
[1:17:25] analogy ande preaching to a church back
[1:17:27] east and he says now any of you robbed a
[1:17:30] bank he's just thinking that's a safe
[1:17:32] analogy you know any of you robbed a
[1:17:34] bank you know you know unless you've
[1:17:36] robbed a bank none of this will apply to
[1:17:38] you and there was a brother in the
[1:17:39] church and he's
[1:17:44] like but maybe it was just for him he
[1:17:46] knew he had come to the place that his
[1:17:50] life was fully destroyed prisoned for 25
[1:17:54] 5 years everything being what it was and
[1:17:58] by the grace of
[1:18:01] God somebody asked this brother do you
[1:18:04] know what Grace is oh let me tell you
[1:18:06] what Grace is I know what Grace is well
[1:18:09] my brother and sister the word says that
[1:18:11] if we are guilty of one thing we're
[1:18:13] guilty of all of it oh we should know
[1:18:16] what Grace is that God has come and it's
[1:18:19] a personal message that whatever
[1:18:21] situation you had I had anyone had we
[1:18:25] can look at that and say it was God who
[1:18:27] come I didn't need some blanket
[1:18:29] forgiveness God come specifically to me
[1:18:32] and forgave my situation
[1:18:36] Amen brother back east Great Big Brother
[1:18:41] in prison for
[1:18:42] murder supposed to be in there for life
[1:18:46] God come on him he got a message book in
[1:18:48] the prison God come on him so strong
[1:18:51] changed him so radically my brother and
[1:18:53] sister that in the prison right there
[1:18:55] they're all stunned Something's Happened
[1:18:58] to this man and it was a few more years
[1:19:01] it didn't happen just overnight but then
[1:19:03] they put him before the parole board and
[1:19:05] they turned him loose and it was there
[1:19:07] my brother and sister nothing short even
[1:19:10] the warden said this is a miracle but we
[1:19:13] serve a God that has Miracles amen we
[1:19:16] are Miracles we are the kind of people
[1:19:19] that believe we're not looking for past
[1:19:21] but we know what it means now if if it's
[1:19:25] prophesied that in this age Christ is on
[1:19:27] the outside of the
[1:19:28] church this conversation with the bride
[1:19:31] has become a very personal
[1:19:33] one it's not broadcast to the world
[1:19:37] anymore we're still going to see Souls
[1:19:39] being saved don't don't misund
[1:19:40] understand me but you see this is slowly
[1:19:43] narrowing down because when the last
[1:19:45] soul is saved it's
[1:19:48] finished we don't need not speaking ill
[1:19:51] of this but we don't need a Billy Graham
[1:19:53] Crusade
[1:19:54] we don't need these kind of things the
[1:19:57] word of God shows us very C clearly that
[1:20:00] now is the the sifting or the you know
[1:20:03] uh uh
[1:20:04] um oh I forgot the word it was right
[1:20:07] there do you understand what I'm talking
[1:20:09] about on the wheat floor amen
[1:20:13] so another thing that just strikes
[1:20:18] me we have Eagles out there on the lake
[1:20:21] and we get to see them every once in a
[1:20:22] while some pretty almost like
[1:20:24] Supernatural things you know driving on
[1:20:27] our way to church on Sunday
[1:20:29] morning maybe about here to the back of
[1:20:31] the church an eagle flying at our ey
[1:20:34] level along with us right down the
[1:20:37] highway on the dam right there and it
[1:20:40] even looked over at
[1:20:42] us and I mean I wanted to tell him first
[1:20:45] off he like hey did you know you're
[1:20:46] going 38 miles an
[1:20:48] hour but it really struck
[1:20:51] me here it is
[1:20:56] the eagle anointing of our
[1:20:59] age it's got the power it's got the
[1:21:01] strength it's got the
[1:21:04] confidence everything we
[1:21:07] need it could easily stay
[1:21:10] perched on a limb somewhere and said I'm
[1:21:13] capable of
[1:21:15] that are you with
[1:21:18] me but it's time to get off the
[1:21:20] limb shake out the old feathers and say
[1:21:24] not only am I capable of that I am going
[1:21:27] to do that I will Fly Like an Eagle I
[1:21:31] will come to the presence of God and I
[1:21:33] will do that and you know Eagles
[1:21:35] understand Eagle language you know isn't
[1:21:39] amazing I tell you Jerry and I hope this
[1:21:42] isn't for squeamish people Jerry and I
[1:21:45] coming to church one day we could see a
[1:21:47] goose out on the
[1:21:48] ice and we came
[1:21:51] home and it looked like they were having
[1:21:53] Church
[1:21:55] all the eagles gathered around what had
[1:21:56] been a
[1:21:59] goose now how do you attract that many
[1:22:01] geese I mean uh
[1:22:05] Eagles you hear the
[1:22:08] scream and when the eagle screams the
[1:22:10] eagle understands the
[1:22:12] scream and this is the day the eagle
[1:22:16] Revelation has come and you look at you
[1:22:21] my we wouldn't even fill the front two
[1:22:23] rows of some of the church churches in
[1:22:24] these
[1:22:26] neighborhoods but their Scream was a
[1:22:29] different kind of
[1:22:31] scream what they hear is a different
[1:22:34] voice but to hear an eagle now Look What
[1:22:38] the Lord says in Isaiah 41:10 fear thou
[1:22:41] not for I am with thee be not dismayed
[1:22:44] for I am thy God I will strengthen thee
[1:22:48] yay I will help thee yay I will uphold
[1:22:51] thee with the right hand of my rightous
[1:22:54] iess have you experienced this amen I
[1:22:58] tell you God is so gracious my brother
[1:23:00] and sister he said I'm with you and
[1:23:02] don't be dismayed I'm your God and I'm
[1:23:05] going to strengthen you this this
[1:23:07] applies to us amen
[1:23:10] hallelujah let me move right along here
[1:23:14] who do you say this
[1:23:19] is I want to ask you what do you feel
[1:23:22] like
[1:23:23] today do you Feel Like an
[1:23:30] Eagle come on don't look at me this
[1:23:34] way y all look
[1:23:38] nervous well let me shock
[1:23:41] you I don't feel like an eagle right
[1:23:49] now but I know I
[1:23:52] am that's all that matters
[1:23:55] is that we know that we are
[1:23:58] equals amen you might not get up in the
[1:24:02] morning amen I woke up about 3:00 this
[1:24:05] morning with my hip hurting and I laid
[1:24:08] there in bed for a while and I finally
[1:24:10] is like I might as well just get up my
[1:24:13] brother and sister that doesn't make you
[1:24:16] feel
[1:24:18] overpowering strong Overcomer it makes
[1:24:21] you actually feel feeble
[1:24:25] hm very feeble feel strong one day and
[1:24:29] feel crippled the
[1:24:31] next but this has nothing to do with
[1:24:36] this I know I'm an eagle I know I was
[1:24:40] called of God I know that this work he
[1:24:43] began in me he will finish I know this
[1:24:49] and no matter what this flesh no matter
[1:24:51] the torment of the mind or of the body
[1:24:54] no matter the the suppression of your
[1:24:57] spirit where you just feel like have I
[1:24:59] done something wrong Lord what have I
[1:25:01] done and then you know Satan will come
[1:25:04] and say have you ever done anything
[1:25:07] right and you can't really give an
[1:25:09] answer to
[1:25:11] that but there's something down inside
[1:25:14] that you hear in this scream of the
[1:25:16] eagle that says but you are
[1:25:19] mine I claimed you I called you I
[1:25:22] provided for you it was was my blood
[1:25:25] that washed you it is my life that flows
[1:25:28] through your veins and it is me that's
[1:25:30] going to carry you
[1:25:32] through and then you put your old wings
[1:25:34] out and you say Thank You Lord thank you
[1:25:38] Lord I I will overcome I am an overcomer
[1:25:43] not that I hope to but I
[1:25:45] am Amen brother Brown says here who do
[1:25:48] you say this is God May men and women no
[1:25:51] longer hold on to traditions and creeds
[1:25:54] but may they come out of that thing and
[1:25:56] give their lives completely to God and
[1:26:00] believe not just trust upon the theory
[1:26:03] and the things of man but trust in a
[1:26:05] living God my brother and sister I just
[1:26:08] watched a little documentary thing and
[1:26:11] and these people are climbing places in
[1:26:12] the world that they said years ago were
[1:26:16] unclimbable and you know they're willing
[1:26:18] to trust I never pronounce it correctly
[1:26:20] but but they're willing to trust they
[1:26:22] will take and drive uh a pitton Paton
[1:26:26] whatever it is into a crack in a
[1:26:29] rock put their hook upon that and trust
[1:26:33] their very life to a little piece of
[1:26:36] metal
[1:26:38] carbide and how well they drove it in
[1:26:40] the crack of The
[1:26:43] Rock and we struggle to trust
[1:26:47] God tells you it's a greater battle than
[1:26:50] we've ever thought greater battle than
[1:26:52] we've ever recognized men trust their
[1:26:55] very life to those
[1:26:57] things and God having proven himself
[1:27:00] over and over again we struggle to trust
[1:27:08] him while these holidays this was
[1:27:11] preached 12 and 27
[1:27:13] 1964 while these holidays are going on
[1:27:16] this the cry still is who is this what
[1:27:19] is it what's it all about religious
[1:27:22] people say the same thing and it's the
[1:27:24] same Lord Jesus made flesh in his
[1:27:28] people
[1:27:30] according anointing his word for the
[1:27:34] bride God making himself flesh in you
[1:27:36] and I I want to ask you are you really
[1:27:44] you come on are you really
[1:27:51] you are we not getting it
[1:27:57] if you're the bride of Christ you're not
[1:27:58] really
[1:28:01] you one flesh right our marriage vows
[1:28:04] reflect that one
[1:28:07] flesh you're not really you you're
[1:28:11] Christ here in this testing ground the
[1:28:14] prophet of God said let it come down to
[1:28:17] prove who you are and he
[1:28:20] is he is proving we are not flesh
[1:28:24] we are not this we have attributes of it
[1:28:27] amen come on I won't go I get too caught
[1:28:30] up in examples sometimes I'm sorry but
[1:28:33] it's no longer see it's the same Lord
[1:28:35] Jesus made flesh in his people anointing
[1:28:38] his word for the bride and they can't
[1:28:41] understand it they're also tore away in
[1:28:45] leoda till they don't know what it's all
[1:28:48] about I want to ask you is this about a
[1:28:51] better
[1:28:52] career is this about a better house a
[1:28:54] newer car is this about a better clothes
[1:28:58] is this about you know I mean these are
[1:29:00] all segments of it don't don't
[1:29:02] misunderstand me it's not just about
[1:29:04] finding the right person to marry them
[1:29:06] that's
[1:29:08] important but without Christ in the
[1:29:10] equation what have we got you can meet
[1:29:12] the nicest person on Earth but without
[1:29:15] Christ amen we can have the best job on
[1:29:17] Earth but without Christ amen if you
[1:29:20] don't think so just look at the world
[1:29:22] we're living in today my brother sister
[1:29:25] is people are wealthier at the top end
[1:29:27] of the scale wealthier than ever and
[1:29:29] crazier than ever I'll just leave it
[1:29:31] that simple
[1:29:33] amen people in their
[1:29:36] 60s you know like sister Jerry and
[1:29:39] I building 10,000 square foot houses for
[1:29:43] two people to live
[1:29:45] in
[1:29:49] insanity and I I could go on and on but
[1:29:52] I'm going to try and hurry here
[1:29:56] they can't understand it they're so tore
[1:29:58] away and Leo to seea till they don't
[1:30:00] know what it's all about and the prophet
[1:30:01] said there'll be light in the evening so
[1:30:04] where are we looking for it Lord come
[1:30:07] Lord bless each one amen you see it all
[1:30:10] depends on where we're
[1:30:13] looking hallelujah what are we looking
[1:30:16] for
[1:30:17] Saints our Focus every day should be
[1:30:20] Lord I want to come a little closer to
[1:30:22] you I I want to do something for you
[1:30:24] Lord I I want to stand here Lord knowing
[1:30:28] that you are in
[1:30:29] me I want to reflect that
[1:30:34] amen you see when Christ was outside the
[1:30:37] church the church got to interpret the
[1:30:41] word in the way that pleased
[1:30:43] them but we're here you see they created
[1:30:46] their own
[1:30:49] narrative now I doubt if you guys
[1:30:51] followed that much and I I wouldn't
[1:30:52] expect you to
[1:30:54] but you're seeing now in the
[1:30:55] denominations this whole uh alternate
[1:30:58] lifestyle we'll keep it politically
[1:31:00] correct alternate lifestyle stuff you
[1:31:04] see one by one it is
[1:31:06] fracturing the denominational
[1:31:10] churches they will stand I just watched
[1:31:13] a whole deal was a meeting uh amongst
[1:31:16] methodists and um and they're standing
[1:31:20] there on one side of the aisle you might
[1:31:22] say is saying but the Bible says
[1:31:24] and people on the other side of the
[1:31:26] aisle but we have to be
[1:31:30] relevant in other words we don't need
[1:31:32] the word we need
[1:31:35] relevance and then you're seeing Oh the
[1:31:38] C clergy should at least be well the
[1:31:42] clergy is no different than us and when
[1:31:45] they're all
[1:31:46] done they're now an inclusive
[1:31:51] church and the Bible
[1:31:58] put on the
[1:32:01] Shelf I hope our bibles are not on a
[1:32:05] shelf I hope our bibles are dust
[1:32:09] free I hope you wear out your Bible I'll
[1:32:12] buy you another
[1:32:14] one you see but the minute Christ got
[1:32:17] put
[1:32:18] outside the door was opened and the
[1:32:22] demons flooded in
[1:32:25] in if we're not careful we focus on that
[1:32:29] but the truth of it
[1:32:31] is it's lip to
[1:32:33] ear Jesus Christ speaking to you
[1:32:37] today
[1:32:40] personally now this might not be the
[1:32:42] most exciting message my brother and
[1:32:43] sister but I have to just share with you
[1:32:46] you won't get to blame me you won't get
[1:32:49] to blame the preacher across the country
[1:32:52] you won't get to blame the visiting
[1:32:53] preacher preachers we won't get to blame
[1:32:55] brother Chris or Brother David you see
[1:32:57] this is a personal thing and you should
[1:33:00] be excited about it being personal
[1:33:03] because God's not offering it to you
[1:33:05] second-handed he's offering it to you
[1:33:09] personal amen you know when Jerry and I
[1:33:13] were courting many years
[1:33:16] ago um there was young lady's a good
[1:33:18] friend of sister Jerry's known her I
[1:33:20] think all her life
[1:33:21] practically and um you know she was she
[1:33:24] was a great encourager of the whole
[1:33:26] thing you know instigator might be a
[1:33:29] better
[1:33:31] word but you see the problems that Jerry
[1:33:34] and I have
[1:33:35] today I cannot go back and say Janette
[1:33:39] it's your
[1:33:41] fault
[1:33:43] well there might be some Merit to
[1:33:48] that you see it's what we have done with
[1:33:52] it
[1:33:54] it's what we've
[1:33:56] applied what we've fed what we've
[1:33:59] brought to
[1:34:02] fruition I think it's time
[1:34:05] Saints the actions in our
[1:34:09] marriages in our
[1:34:11] children in our
[1:34:14] church that we have the courage to stand
[1:34:16] up and take full accountability for that
[1:34:25] brother Alex would you
[1:34:28] come I just want you all to leave so
[1:34:33] happy amen are we ready to take
[1:34:35] accountability for
[1:34:37] that brother Brandon preaches several
[1:34:40] time through the message you know about
[1:34:42] trying to get warmed by a painted
[1:34:45] fire I don't want a painted
[1:34:48] fire I want the real
[1:34:51] fire I want to be able to stand in say
[1:34:54] it hurt it hurt like you can't believe
[1:34:57] to bring my life subject to the
[1:34:59] word that I'm so glad I did because now
[1:35:04] the holy spirit that fire is down inside
[1:35:07] changing my life changing my family
[1:35:10] changing my marriage changing my
[1:35:12] children changing everything around me
[1:35:14] changing and that brought to church and
[1:35:16] changed our
[1:35:18] church you see it's a
[1:35:20] personal personal
[1:35:25] [Music]
[1:35:31] message do you personally want to
[1:35:35] change you personally want the Holy
[1:35:38] Spirit to come
[1:35:39] down take a Hal of Our
[1:35:43] Lives take bitterness and anger
[1:35:48] stubbornness all the little besetting
[1:35:52] sins do we we want him to come and just
[1:35:54] so personally deal with
[1:35:57] us that we could finally come to a stage
[1:36:00] of our life we didn't offer an excuse we
[1:36:03] offered a complete surrender forgive me
[1:36:06] Lord forgive
[1:36:09] me I want to change I want to be what
[1:36:12] your word says I am I want to live the
[1:36:15] life you promised me I want to be a
[1:36:19] change in my
[1:36:20] church amen you might find it awkward if
[1:36:24] someone says I am going to change Grace
[1:36:28] Tabernacle you might become leery of
[1:36:30] someone a preacher I'm going to change
[1:36:33] Grace Tabernacle and you think now what
[1:36:35] is he going to do but if you understood
[1:36:38] that he was looking for God to change
[1:36:40] him and he knew when God changed him it
[1:36:43] would change this
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:45] church are we willing to go that far
[1:36:49] claim it as our own personal
[1:36:51] message not just something brother
[1:36:53] brandom spoke to a bunch of people we
[1:36:56] believe it we identify with it but to
[1:36:59] actually take
[1:37:02] ownership of this
[1:37:04] message not as something we follow not
[1:37:07] something that we believe in but
[1:37:10] actually taking
[1:37:13] ownership of this
[1:37:17] message if the word says it he would
[1:37:20] create a clean heart in us then we
[1:37:21] should be saying I have a clean heart
[1:37:24] amen he says if he would deliver me from
[1:37:27] all of my afflictions then we should be
[1:37:29] sent here today saying I'm
[1:37:32] free but we have to make a personal
[1:37:36] claim he was preaching to

[1:37:45] but it's pretty easy have you guys ever
[1:37:47] practice Pitchfork
[1:37:50] religion you know the preachers
[1:37:52] preaching
[1:37:54] and you
[1:37:56] know that's pretty
[1:37:59] straightforward that probably needs to
[1:38:01] go over
[1:38:04] there oh not here that goes over
[1:38:09] here how about we just stand up and say
[1:38:13] Lord I want to take accountability to
[1:38:17] that that's for
[1:38:19] me that's for Me Maybe if it's just the
[1:38:22] smallest degree
[1:38:25] that's for me the prophet said I'll say
[1:38:29] Amen to that we want to follow the
[1:38:32] message right amen we ought to say Amen
[1:38:35] to the hard things as much as we say
[1:38:38] Amen to the things that we
[1:38:41] love personal message God tailored it
[1:38:45] just for you not to punish you Saints
[1:38:47] I'm not here speaking this morning to
[1:38:49] punish anyone I'm here this morning
[1:38:51] speaking that when we take person
[1:38:53] personal accountability that this is my
[1:38:56] message God sent a prophet just for
[1:39:02] me guaranteeing me to make the Rapture
[1:39:07] amen that's not
[1:39:08] selfish that's an understanding of what
[1:39:11] God and the value he placed upon you
[1:39:14] that he would send a prophet just for
[1:39:18] me
[1:39:19] amen
