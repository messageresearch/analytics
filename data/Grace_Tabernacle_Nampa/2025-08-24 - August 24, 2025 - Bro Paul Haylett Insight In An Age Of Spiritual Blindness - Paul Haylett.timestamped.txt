[15:09] I heard an old old story.
[15:14] How a savior came from glory.
[15:19] How he gave his life on Calvary
[15:23] to save a wretch like me.
[15:28] I heard about his groaning
[15:32] of his precious blood.
[15:35] atoning.
[15:37] Then I repented of my sin and won the
[15:44] victory.
[15:47] Victory
[15:49] in Jesus
[15:51] my savior
[15:54] forever.
[15:56] He sought me and he bought me with his
[16:02] redeeming blood.
[16:05] He loved me.
[16:07] I knew him. And all my love is due him.
[16:14] He plunged me to victory
[16:19] beneath the cleansing flood.
[16:24] I heard about his healing
[16:28] of his cleansing power revealing
[16:33] and he come
[16:35] to walk again and he caused the blind to
[16:40] see.
[16:42] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,
[16:46] come and heal my broken
[16:49] spirit."
[16:51] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[16:57] the victory.
[17:00] Oh victory
[17:03] in Jesus
[17:05] my savior
[17:07] forever.
[17:10] He sought me and he bought me with his
[17:15] redeeing blood.
[17:19] He loved me where I knew him and all my
[17:24] love is due to him. He plunged me to
[17:31] victory
[17:32] beneath the cleansing flood.
[17:37] I heard about a mansion
[17:41] he has built for me in glory.
[17:46] And I heard about the streets of gold
[17:51] beyond the crystal sea
[17:56] about the angels
[17:58] singing
[18:00] and the old redemption
[18:03] story.
[18:05] And some sweet day I'll sing up there
[18:10] the song of victory.
[18:14] Oh, victory
[18:16] in Jesus
[18:19] my savior
[18:21] forever.
[18:23] He sought me and he bought me with his
[18:30] redeeming
[18:31] blood.
[18:33] He loved me.
[18:35] I knew him.
[18:38] And all my love is to him. He plunged me
[18:44] to victory
[18:47] beneath the cleansing flood. One more
[18:50] time.
[18:52] Victory
[18:54] in Jesus
[18:56] my savior
[18:59] forever.
[19:01] He sought me and he bought me with his
[19:07] redeeing blood.
[19:10] He loved me as I knew him. And all my
[19:16] love is to him. He plunged me to victory
[19:24] beneath the cleansing flood.
[19:30] Amen.
[19:31] Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[19:36] Hallelujah.
[19:38] Amen. And let's just uh
[19:43] let's just stand as we get ready to go

[19:59] is love
[20:03] vast as the ocean.
[20:08] Loving kindness
[20:13] as a flood.
[20:18] When the prince
[20:22] of life, our ransom
[20:28] shed for us.
[20:32] his preious blood.
[20:39] Who is love
[20:43] will not remember?
[20:49] Who can see
[20:54] to sing his praise?
[21:00] He will never
[21:05] be forgotten
[21:10] throughout hell.

[29:36] We are very thankful that we can bring
[29:38] these requests before you this morning
[29:42] because we know there's a fountain open.
[29:45] We know redemption.
[29:48] You've given redemption. You paid the
[29:50] price, Lord, for us.
[29:53] We've come here not to leave the same as
[29:55] we came in.
[29:58] Lord, we're determined to leave closer
[29:59] to you.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; We're calling on you for revelation,
[30:04] Father,
[30:06] because Lord, we know we're saved by the
[30:08] revealing of the word in our hearts.
[30:13] And Father, we're expecting you to
[30:14] speak.
[30:16] We're expecting you to take the
[30:19] instrumentality of man and speak your
[30:22] mind this morning to predestinated
[30:25] hearts that are able to receive and hear
[30:28] the word.
[30:30] Now, Father, these requests have been
[30:32] made. You know, every one of them.
[30:35] Lord, many traveling, many outworking,
[30:39] &gt;&gt; many sick, not feeling well. Those
[30:42] online, Lord, we bring every one of them
[30:45] before you. They've been mentioned now
[30:47] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; May every one of them be met.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; We expect that Lord because we ask in
[30:54] faith believing first of all that you
[30:57] hear us and that we know because you
[31:00] hear us we have our request now.
[31:03] Heavenly Father
[31:05] Lord may every one of these be met.
[31:07] Every unspoken request be ministered
[31:10] now. Lord, we give you praise because we
[31:13] know that if we ask anything in your
[31:16] name, you will do it. We expect it. We
[31:18] know we'll receive the answer. In the
[31:21] name of Jesus Christ, we do pray and ask
[31:24] these things. And say as we clear this
[31:29] prayer, Lord, we say amen because we
[31:32] know it's so.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen, Jesus.
[31:40] Amen. Thank you, brother David.
[31:43] Um, you may have your seats. I have an
[31:45] announcement to make and as we do, we'll

[31:49] a special for us this morning. Amen.
[31:52] Um,

[32:09] remember the number, one of those two.
[32:11] Uh, church age books for the believers
[32:12] there in Colombia and Mexico. And, um,
[32:16] so they've been trying to raise the
[32:19] funds to be able to do that. our church
[32:20] has given uh $5,000 towards that. So, uh
[32:24] just to be a part of that so that um
[32:28] those believers there can receive that.
[32:29] Amen. So, I just want to share that with
[32:32] everyone. Praise the Lord for
[32:35] the ability to do that. Amen.
[32:49] [Music]
[32:57] I stand accused.
[33:03] There's a list a mile long of all my
[33:08] sins,
[33:12] of everything that I've done wrong. And
[33:16] I'm so ashamed.
[33:21] There's nowhere left for me to hide.
[33:25] This is the day
[33:31] I must answer for my life.
[33:39] My fate is in the judge's hands.
[33:48] But then he turns to me and says,
[33:57] "I know you.
[34:02] I love you.
[34:06] I gave my life
[34:11] to save you.
[34:15] Love paid the price
[34:20] for mercy.
[34:24] My verdict,
[34:28] not guilty.
[34:32] How can it be? I can't begin to
[34:38] comprehend
[34:40] what kind of grace would take the place
[34:45] of all my sin.
[34:49] I stand in awe
[34:52] now that I have been set free.
[34:57] And my tears roll up as I look at that
[35:00] cross.
[35:02] cuz it should have been me.
[35:06] My fate was in the nail scarred hands.
[35:15] He stretched them out for me and said,
[35:24] "I know you.
[35:29] I love you.
[35:33] I gave my life
[35:38] to save you.
[35:41] Love pay the price
[35:46] for mercy.
[35:50] My verdict,
[35:54] not guilty.
[35:58] I'm falling on my knees to thank you
[36:02] with everything I am. I praise you.
[36:06] So grateful for the words I heard you
[36:12] say.
[36:16] I know you.
[36:20] I love you.
[36:24] I gave my life
[36:29] to save you.
[36:33] Love paid the price
[36:38] for mercy.
[36:42] My verdict.

[37:10] I see that blood, I'll pass over you.
[37:13] Not guilty. Praise God. Sister Melody
[37:16] got a song for us as well. Amen.
[37:38] [Music]
[37:57] You may wonder why I sing his praise
[38:01] every chance that I get.
[38:06] You may wonder why I raise my hands or
[38:11] why I shout amen.
[38:15] You may wonder why tears fill my eyes
[38:19] when I hear the old rugged cross.
[38:24] You may wonder why I live for him, why I
[38:29] serve him at any cost.
[38:33] [Music]
[38:35] But if you knew what my life was like
[38:40] before Jesus came and made things right
[38:45] and saved me from the mess that I was
[38:50] in.
[38:53] And if you only knew where I would be,
[38:58] had it not been for Calvary,
[39:02] then my friend, you would
[39:07] understand.
[39:11] Looking back on how far I've come and
[39:16] how much he has blessed.
[39:20] All the joys that he has given me.
[39:25] Despite my sinful past.
[39:29] No greater friend have I ever known than
[39:33] this one who walks by my side.
[39:38] And oh what a difference
[39:42] since he came into my life.
[39:48] And if you knew what my life was like
[39:53] before Jesus came and made things right
[39:58] and saved me from the mess that I was
[40:02] in.
[40:06] And if you only knew where I would be,
[40:11] had it not been for Calvary,
[40:15] then my friend, you would understand.
[40:41] And if you only knew where I would be,
[40:46] had it not been for Calvary,
[40:50] then my friend, you would
[40:55] understand.

[41:33] song. Just want to sing the chorus

[45:51] is to be filled with the spirit fire.
[45:58] My purpose is to worship you alone.
[46:10] Open up my soul
[46:15] to worship and adore.
[46:21] Hallelujah. Be a fragrance
[46:25] offered to your throne.

[49:47] a risen
[49:51] lamb,
[49:53] my comfort
[49:55] [Music]
[49:58] and my king.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just take this moment. Just
[50:05] lift our hands. Just pour your heart out
[50:08] to the Lord. Just give praise to him.
[50:11] He's so wonderful when we stop and we
[50:13] think of all the things he has done for
[50:16] us. Amen. That he has led us and he has
[50:19] guided us. He said, "I'll be with you
[50:22] even in you." And we testify today that
[50:24] he is. Oh Lord, we thank you for your
[50:27] grace, your mercy today. Lord, I thank
[50:30] you for what you're doing in the lives
[50:32] of your sons and daughters. Lord,
[50:35] Father, you're calling a people home.
[50:37] Your people, a people who were once not
[50:40] a people, but now are your people.
[50:42] Father, we just thank you, Lord Jesus,
[50:45] for what you are doing. I ask you, Lord,
[50:47] bless your people today. Bless the
[50:49] saints, Father. Lord, move beyond this
[50:52] man and speak to the hearts of each and
[50:55] everyone for the needs of their
[50:57] individual life. Lord Jesus, that we
[50:59] might be able to lift our eyes and give
[51:02] praise to the King of Kings, Lord of
[51:05] Lords. We thank you, Lord Jesus. How we
[51:08] thank you today. Hallelujah. Is it good
[51:12] to be in the house of the Lord today?
[51:15] Amen.
[51:17] Hallelujah.
[51:21] just have a couple things here just real
[51:23] quick to to go over uh just to share
[51:27] with you. Uh amen. Uh
[51:33] Sunday school will start on uh the 7th
[51:36] of September, a little later than
[51:38] normal, and I apologize for that. Uh we
[51:42] will only have two classes this year. Uh
[51:45] and remember parents uh you'll need to
[51:47] have your children here by 9:45
[51:50] and so that they can participate. And um
[51:55] we have uh want to lift up a young man
[51:58] who contacted me a couple days ago was
[52:00] unfortunately unable to be here today.
[52:03] Uh, brother Emanuel uh is here going to
[52:06] um the university to Boisee State uh
[52:09] from Ghana and uh he just desires to uh
[52:13] fellowship here with us. So please
[52:16] remember brother Emanuel in prayer. The
[52:19] Lord just make a way has a few
[52:21] challenges as in transportation
[52:23] uh lives very close to the the
[52:25] university there. So I believe the Lord
[52:28] will have a solution. Amen. to to help
[52:31] our brother Emanuel get here to the
[52:32] services. And I always I I just never
[52:36] like putting it this way. I I've always
[52:38] through the years been a little
[52:40] embarrassed myself, but um anyway, uh I
[52:45] just want to
[52:47] greet our sister Sarah, sister Anna, and
[52:51] brother, I'm sorry I don't know your
[52:53] name, so I'm just going to have to
[52:54] identify you as her husband.
[52:58] And I've always been embarrassed about
[53:00] that through the years. It's like to be
[53:02] identified as someone, you know, sister
[53:04] Jerry's husband. But God bless you. So
[53:06] good to see you guys. And and uh good to
[53:10] um see brother Manasse, Sister Katie
[53:12] here this morning. And uh it seems like
[53:15] we have a guest or two here. And each
[53:17] one of you saints, it's just good to see
[53:19] you. Amen. And uh so as we we look
[53:24] forward to what the Lord's doing in our
[53:26] lives, um I think there'll be several of
[53:29] us that will be gone this next Sunday.
[53:32] Uh um it would be uh our niece uh Beth,
[53:39] Sister Beth, is graduating from RN
[53:42] school. I say medical, but I don't want
[53:44] you to think she's a doctor. She's just
[53:46] an RN. Just u nothing, you know. No.
[53:50] quite an accomplishment. Amen. In the
[53:53] day that we live in just she's pressed
[53:55] through. There's times that she said
[53:57] this is too much and she just kept
[53:59] pressing and pressing and uh this this
[54:02] next weekend she graduates and uh so
[54:05] we'll be down in Salt Lake City. Um and
[54:09] uh uh there at her graduation. She's
[54:12] such a wonderful girl. We love her very
[54:14] much. So this next Sunday, Brother David
[54:18] Deanhart will be ministering and uh just
[54:21] be praying for that. Amen. I want to
[54:24] speak to you this morning. Thank you
[54:25] musicians. What a wonderful song
[54:27] service. Amen. Just touch my heart. I
[54:30] thank the Lord for that. And um so as we
[54:34] look at this today, I want to speak to
[54:36] you on uh insight in an age of spiritual
[54:40] blindness. Now, it might sound
[54:42] judgmental for me to say it's an age of
[54:45] spiritual blindness, but that's what the
[54:47] scripture says. It would come to a time
[54:49] that people would be spiritually minded
[54:52] uh and uh not have the power thereof.
[54:55] So, they have this thought of of we we
[54:58] have understanding, we have the word, we
[55:00] have all of these things, but yet not
[55:03] really understanding what what God is
[55:06] saying. Because you say, "Brother Paul,
[55:08] are you being judgmental?" No, I'm being
[55:10] realistic because if you understand
[55:13] something, you do it. If you really
[55:17] believe something, you do it. And so,
[55:20] we're living in a day that people say
[55:22] they believe the word of God. Don't want
[55:24] to change a single word, but do. And I
[55:28] know that's very stark, very direct, but
[55:31] that's the day the word said would come
[55:33] to pass, and it has. Amen. So insight is
[55:38] also another word for insight would be
[55:40] understanding. So God has granted to you
[55:43] understanding in an age of spiritual
[55:46] blindness. And I think that we should be
[55:49] able to lift our hands and give praise
[55:51] to God that he has given us
[55:53] understanding of his word. He's speaking
[55:55] to us. Amen. Brother Brandham told us he
[55:58] says of things to pray for in your life.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation. Amen. And so
[56:04] without revelation,
[56:07] uh, we we can just read it and read it,
[56:09] read it, not understand it. And if you
[56:12] don't understand it, you won't apply it
[56:13] to your life. Amen. Oh, I'm just
[56:16] terrible with names. I I spot your
[56:20] brother hiding
[56:22] back there. God bless. It's not. Oh, he
[56:25] sure looks like him. Okay. I had to put
[56:28] my foot in my mouth anyway. So, well,
[56:30] God bless you. Glad to have each and
[56:32] every one of you here today. Let's turn
[56:34] in our Bibles to 1 Corinthians 2. Amen.
[56:38] Verses 1-16. Quite lengthy. We'll read a
[56:41] portion of it and allow you to be
[56:42] seated. Um,
[56:46] you know, sometimes these things linger
[56:48] in your thinking for quite a while. And
[56:51] and uh part of that is that you don't
[56:53] quite know how to put it all together.
[56:55] But the Lord didn't ask us to figure out
[56:58] how to make it come to pass. He just
[57:00] asked us to believe it. And when we
[57:02] believe it, he brings it to pass. So we
[57:05] thank the Lord for that. Amen. 1
[57:08] Corinthians 2 chapter. And I, brethren,
[57:11] when I come to you, come not with
[57:13] excellency of speech or of wisdom,
[57:15] declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[57:18] For I determined not to know anything
[57:20] among you, save Jesus Christ and him
[57:23] crucified.
[57:24] And I was with you in weakness and in
[57:26] fear and in much trembling. and my
[57:29] speech and my preaching was not with
[57:32] enticing words of man's wisdom, but in
[57:34] demonstration of the spirit and of
[57:37] power, that your faith should not stand
[57:40] in the wisdom of men, but in the power
[57:42] of God. How be it we speak wisdom among
[57:45] them that are perfect, yet not the
[57:47] wisdom of this world, nor the princes of
[57:50] this world that come to not, but we
[57:52] speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
[57:55] even the hidden wisdom which God
[57:57] ordained before the world unto our
[58:00] glory. Heavenly Father, we just ask you
[58:02] to open the word today. Speak to the
[58:04] hearts of your children. Lord, we're
[58:06] here to stir up pure minds in
[58:07] remembrance, Father, of what you have
[58:09] already expressed to us, already granted
[58:12] to us. Lord, let the word come to us.
[58:14] Let it be living, Father. Let it be
[58:17] lifechanging. Let it be empowering,
[58:19] Father, that we can continue to press
[58:22] forward to the mark of the high calling,
[58:24] Lord. That by revelation, we can see the
[58:26] goal before us and finish this race. Ask
[58:30] you to bless each one today in the name
[58:32] of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be
[58:35] seated.
[58:49] which none of the princes of this world
[58:51] knew. For had they known it, they would
[58:53] not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[58:56] But as it is written, I hath not seen
[58:58] nor ear heard, neither have entered into
[59:01] the heart of man the things which God
[59:04] hath prepared for them that love him.
[59:06] Now, are you looking forward to that
[59:08] time of to see this manifested, to see
[59:11] the the rolling out of the things that
[59:13] we don't even comprehend how great it
[59:16] is, what God is giving to us, what he's
[59:19] pouring into us. We do not fathom that.
[59:22] and and in our human element we say I I
[59:25] have seen times I've been experienced
[59:27] times of incredible blessing the
[59:30] presence of God and yet there's so much
[59:33] more that we do not even comprehend and
[59:36] so as we look at that we realize that uh
[59:39] it is not something that man can express
[59:42] because man expresses it in the level
[59:45] that man understands and so we'll see
[59:48] that as it is that eye hasn't seen ear
[59:51] heard neither entered into the heart of
[59:53] man the things which God hath prepared
[59:55] for them that love him. But God hath
[59:57] revealed them unto us. Now, let's just
[1:00:00] separate this. As I spoke to you this
[1:00:02] last week, we got to separate. The
[1:00:04] Apostle Paul was talking here is a a
[1:00:06] position of the carnal man and here is a
[1:00:09] position of the spiritual man. And to
[1:00:12] fully understand the word of God, what's
[1:00:14] revealed in this hour, this day that
[1:00:16] we're living in. People say, "Well, you
[1:00:18] know, Brother Brandham, most of these
[1:00:20] things and and take that into context.
[1:00:22] Most of these things brother Brandham
[1:00:24] preached had already been preached, but
[1:00:26] my brother and sister, it has to be
[1:00:28] placed in the right order, in the right
[1:00:30] context, in the right importance." And
[1:00:33] so, it's there that God has come to us
[1:00:35] and he's not coming with a whole new
[1:00:37] gospel. My brother and sister, there's
[1:00:39] been many great men through the years
[1:00:41] preach many of these great doctrines,
[1:00:43] but God says we need to set it all in
[1:00:46] its correct order. And so, it's there
[1:00:48] that the Holy Spirit is coming in the
[1:00:50] day that we are living. Amen. This last
[1:00:52] day. And everything being set in order
[1:00:55] brings it to the place that one key
[1:00:57] unlocks a door. And to get to the next
[1:01:00] door, you must get through the first
[1:01:02] door. Amen. So the first things must be
[1:01:05] unlocked to us and then we can move on.
[1:01:07] And and if we don't have the right
[1:01:09] order, Amen. You cannot get through the
[1:01:12] doors if you don't have the right order
[1:01:14] of the keys to get through the door. So
[1:01:17] you can stand there and fumble around
[1:01:18] and you can try and you can go through
[1:01:21] the great key chain, you might say,
[1:01:23] trying to find a way to unlock the door.
[1:01:25] But when we get in the right order of
[1:01:28] the word, we will find that one
[1:01:30] revelation, one uh uh expression of the
[1:01:33] word unlocks a door for us. And then the
[1:01:36] Lord might allow us to go for a season.
[1:01:38] But you'll find that when we are in
[1:01:40] prayer and entered into the word, you
[1:01:43] come to that next door. The key is
[1:01:44] there. You don't have to fight. You
[1:01:46] don't have to fumble. Amen. But you have
[1:01:49] to take the right process. Amen. And so
[1:01:52] you have to follow through the word
[1:01:54] through the ages and you come down to
[1:01:56] this day and God says in this end time
[1:01:59] I'm going to set it all in order. I'm
[1:02:01] going to set it correctly that sons and
[1:02:04] daughters of God will come in this time
[1:02:06] and they will not be coming up to the
[1:02:08] age, the time, the expression or
[1:02:10] revelation of a rapture still fumbling
[1:02:13] around trying to figure out what did God
[1:02:15] mean? What did God put down in his word?
[1:02:17] What is there? Now, that's not to talk
[1:02:19] about, my brother and sister, you and I
[1:02:21] having an answer to everything. Amen.
[1:02:23] God answers those things in the season
[1:02:26] that God wants to answer it. And we
[1:02:28] would look and think, "Hey, I'm mature."
[1:02:30] But now, I hope you don't mind if I kind
[1:02:32] of push on you a little bit today. Have
[1:02:35] you ever noticed that we get to a spot
[1:02:37] we feel like we are very spiritually
[1:02:39] mature and then a little something
[1:02:41] happens in our life? And I'm just going
[1:02:43] to use a silly example. Maybe we just
[1:02:45] have a little bit of a temper tantrum.
[1:02:47] We get upset over something that was
[1:02:49] seemingly nothing. And it reminds us
[1:02:52] that without him, without the word being
[1:02:54] expressed to us, Amen. Our maturity is
[1:02:58] connected to the opening of the word.
[1:03:00] Amen. We cannot say we are spiritually
[1:03:02] mature and not understand the word of
[1:03:04] God. So it's not about coming in a human
[1:03:07] deal and saying, "Well, I I think
[1:03:09] because this is an elder brother, he
[1:03:12] must have greater revelation." My
[1:03:14] brother and sister, age and revelation
[1:03:15] have nothing to do with each other. Age
[1:03:18] and maturity have nothing to do with
[1:03:21] each other. So there's some very mature
[1:03:23] young people. They're very stalwart,
[1:03:25] patient, loving the Lord, open in the
[1:03:28] word that that are in age, you can look
[1:03:30] at them and say they haven't lived
[1:03:32] enough of life to really have an
[1:03:34] understanding. But if God gave them the
[1:03:36] understanding, then they have
[1:03:38] revelation. They have understanding.
[1:03:41] Amen. So we look at this that God hath
[1:03:44] revealed unto us by his spirit for the
[1:03:47] spirit searchth all things yay the deep
[1:03:49] things of God. So it's there that you
[1:03:51] can have a 12year-old with the
[1:03:53] revelation that a 50year-old has not
[1:03:55] found yet because they are in the word
[1:03:57] and the word is in them. Amen. But we
[1:04:00] often times uh we say we're not but as
[1:04:03] respector of persons we would look and
[1:04:05] say this brother is an elder and we base
[1:04:08] that on the simple fact they've been
[1:04:09] following the message for 40 years.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; But my brother and sister that 11th hour
[1:04:14] worker got paid just the same. And we
[1:04:17] would look at that and say but they
[1:04:18] weren't in the message long enough to
[1:04:21] have the maturity. God didn't care.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; God didn't care. He says, "I'm going to
[1:04:25] call these right here at the end, and
[1:04:28] they are going to come to maturity so
[1:04:31] much faster. It almost should make some
[1:04:33] of us embarrassed.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; We've been following all these years."
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; An 11th hour convert,
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; has the same revelation we do.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us not to get heady,
[1:04:50] high-minded to think we just have more
[1:04:52] because we've been around longer.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; What we have is what Christ has poured
[1:04:57] into us.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And I say thank you, Lord. I don't want
[1:05:00] to embarrass my niece, but I tell you,
[1:05:02] we've seen God do some incredible things
[1:05:04] in her life in the last little bit as
[1:05:07] she shared a song today. Sorry, Mel.
[1:05:09] Have to just share this. Amen. But you
[1:05:11] see, my brother and sister, we get this
[1:05:13] idea. It's going to take years to bring
[1:05:14] a person to this place. I tell you what
[1:05:16] it takes. It takes a move of the Holy
[1:05:18] Spirit in a life. And when he pours in,
[1:05:21] my brother and sister, everything else
[1:05:23] must leave.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; And when it leaves, Amen. then you see a
[1:05:27] vessel committed to Christ. You see a
[1:05:29] vessel that's that's got the word of God
[1:05:31] flowing through them, filling them up.
[1:05:34] And this is what God wants. So, we
[1:05:36] should never get to the place that we
[1:05:38] think because we can date the date. Oh,
[1:05:41] we've been here 40 years. I think I was
[1:05:44] 9 years old when my parents come in the
[1:05:46] message. So, I could sit here today and
[1:05:48] say that I've been over 50 years, but
[1:05:51] how many of those 50 did I really have
[1:05:54] fully committed to Christ?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; That's what matters.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; We're not here to have some kind of
[1:06:00] seniority.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; We're here to get full of the spirit, to
[1:06:04] stop and say, "Lord, regardless of how
[1:06:06] long, bring me to the fullness of the
[1:06:08] revelation of Jesus Christ."
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God hath revealed them unto us
[1:06:15] by his spirit. For the Spirit searchth
[1:06:17] all things, yay, the deep things of God.
[1:06:19] For what man knoweth the things of man,
[1:06:22] save the spirit of man which is in him?
[1:06:24] Even so the things of God knoweth no
[1:06:26] man, but the spirit of God. Now, we have
[1:06:29] received not the spirit of the world.
[1:06:31] Somebody ought to say amen to that.
[1:06:33] We're sitting here this morning not
[1:06:34] having received the spirit of the world.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're new creatures in Christ
[1:06:39] Jesus. You truly are a different person
[1:06:44] than that person out on the street out
[1:06:46] there. And it's time for us to come,
[1:06:48] Amen. I had kind of a subtitle uh today
[1:06:51] that I I didn't put up there, but it's
[1:06:54] time for us to receive our portion.
[1:06:56] Amen. To come to a revelation to
[1:06:58] understand I'm not just like the man out
[1:07:01] there. I was called of God. I've been
[1:07:03] vindicated or confirmed of God. He's
[1:07:06] speaking to me. He's showing me. He's
[1:07:08] talking. He's walking with me. Amen. And
[1:07:11] all I can say is I am where God has
[1:07:15] brought me to.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; That's what I am.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Did I put myself there? We can't.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophet of God, very clearly. No
[1:07:25] other ministry, I hope you don't mind me
[1:07:27] kind of going off into this, but I
[1:07:28] believe it kind of makes a point. Show
[1:07:30] me another ministry in the world today
[1:07:33] that you can find that stood in front of
[1:07:36] thousands and confessed their faults.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; And those faults that he confessed in
[1:07:42] public have now come back to be the
[1:07:44] criticisms that they are using against
[1:07:47] his ministry. Why didn't the rest have
[1:07:49] courage enough to stand up and share the
[1:07:52] issues of their own life?
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, you see, God
[1:07:58] wasn't afraid. It wasn't about William
[1:08:00] Brandham.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; It was about the word that he brought to
[1:08:03] us. And God said, "I don't care. I'll
[1:08:05] show you Elijah the prophet. I'll show
[1:08:07] you his flaws." He's up there saying,
[1:08:10] "Lord, why did you dry the brook up? I'm
[1:08:12] going to die here." And God has to come
[1:08:14] and convince him, "It's time for you to
[1:08:16] get up and start walking and follow the
[1:08:19] cloud."
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Time for you to get up and start
[1:08:22] moving. Amen. And God had to dry the
[1:08:24] brook up and cause the raven to go away
[1:08:27] to get him out of his comfort zone. How
[1:08:30] many of you have a comfort zone today?
[1:08:32] Amen. How many of us are just
[1:08:34] comfortable to say God is real? Amen.
[1:08:36] God Yeah. God's a healer. God's a
[1:08:38] provider, but we won't get out of our
[1:08:40] comfort zone to actually prove that God
[1:08:43] is a healer. He is a provider. He is a
[1:08:46] savior. And he's got a spirit he wants
[1:08:48] to pour into you and I. Amen. We pull
[1:08:52] back. Oh, God sent a prophet. That's
[1:08:54] your comfort zone, my brother and
[1:08:55] sister. That prophet come and said, "I
[1:08:57] came to introduce you to Jesus Christ.
[1:09:01] Let the introduction take place."
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Put on your royal garment and get
[1:09:07] up and go and let the introduction take
[1:09:09] place.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother and sister, it's time for
[1:09:14] us to receive
[1:09:17] our full portion.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just a portion of the portion,
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; but the full portion.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:27] As we look at this, we've not received
[1:09:30] the spirit of the world,
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; but the spirit of the world would sure
[1:09:33] like to claim you.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; The spirit of this world right here,
[1:09:38] whether it's music,
[1:09:40] clothes,
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; and the one we hardly ever want to
[1:09:44] address, attitude.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Atmosphere. That's right.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We have a chalkboard in our garage
[1:09:53] and
[1:09:55] it's written on it to never let our
[1:09:57] confession be negative. And there's
[1:09:59] times I have to stick my head out the
[1:10:01] back door and look at that chalkboard
[1:10:04] and remind myself,
[1:10:06] man,
[1:10:08] why do I have a negative spirit?
[1:10:12] It's because I'm dwelling in a negative
[1:10:14] atmosphere.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; That's true. You don't want to have a
[1:10:17] negative spirit, dwell in another
[1:10:19] atmosphere.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; You want to have a positive uh uh
[1:10:23] approach. Amen. Don't just tell you,
[1:10:25] "Oh, mind over matter. I'll be okay."
[1:10:28] Get in a different atmosphere.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; And when we get in a different
[1:10:31] atmosphere, God comes down, starts to
[1:10:33] move because he promised he would
[1:10:35] fulfill his word in you.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you a question this
[1:10:38] morning. Do any of you have a testimony
[1:10:41] that God is fulfilling his word in you?
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're not sitting here and
[1:10:46] saying, "Oh, well, he's going to do it
[1:10:48] for someone. He did it for them. He did
[1:10:50] it for them." We need to be able to sit
[1:10:52] here this morning and say, "God has
[1:10:55] fulfilled his word in my life."
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am here as the fulfillment of a
[1:11:02] message to the end time church, the
[1:11:05] bride of Jesus Christ. I'm not just
[1:11:07] sitting here saying, "I go to church. I
[1:11:10] believe." Let your belief be manifested.
[1:11:14] Let it become an evidence that you
[1:11:17] actually do believe it.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Reminds me of a story, a fishing boat
[1:11:24] out in the uh Arctic Ocean and the ship
[1:11:28] is sinking and the man is looking at
[1:11:31] this life raft
[1:11:33] and uh he says, "Uh, I that that thing's
[1:11:37] so flimsy. These waves are big. That's
[1:11:40] so flimsy. I I don't trust the lifeboat.
[1:11:43] I don't trust this life raft.
[1:11:46] He stayed on the ship. The ship sunk. He
[1:11:49] dies. The seven men in the lifeboat
[1:11:51] live.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, sometimes to
[1:11:55] live, you've got to step off of the
[1:11:57] things you've been trusting and step
[1:11:59] into the realm of the things that have
[1:12:01] been promised for you.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, look, my brother and sister,
[1:12:07] it takes an act of faith to be a real
[1:12:09] Christian.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; You have to be able to step out. You
[1:12:13] have to be able to trust God. And you've
[1:12:14] got to prove you trust God because
[1:12:17] anything less than a full commitment is
[1:12:20] not a commitment at all.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Let me move on. 1 Corinthians the 3rd
[1:12:27] chapter verse 18- 23.
[1:12:32] Now we oftent times I I hope you don't
[1:12:34] mind if I just speak straight forward
[1:12:36] this morning. We often times get really
[1:12:39] concerned. People are like, "Well, I'm
[1:12:42] so concerned that I, you know, I got to
[1:12:43] guard myself so I'm not deceived in this
[1:12:46] day, this age, when there's all the
[1:12:48] wolves and there's all the the deceivers
[1:12:51] in the land and I'm going to guard
[1:12:53] myself that so that I am not deceived."
[1:12:56] Let me tell you, if it's not the Holy
[1:12:57] Ghost in you, you will be deceived.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; You yourself are not smart enough. You
[1:13:02] yourself cannot comprehend enough. You
[1:13:05] yourself cannot discern well enough. And
[1:13:07] that's why we don't trust ourself. We
[1:13:10] trust the moving of the Holy Spirit. And
[1:13:13] the Holy Spirit is there. It promised in
[1:13:15] the word to lead us and guide us. So
[1:13:18] there we are. What are we doing? We're
[1:13:19] not following a man. We're following the
[1:13:21] leadership of the Holy Spirit. And if
[1:13:23] you say, "But I haven't experienced the
[1:13:25] leadership of the Holy Spirit." Then I
[1:13:27] encourage you not to leave today till
[1:13:29] you find some leadership from the Holy
[1:13:31] Spirit. Because just to walk in this
[1:13:34] life saying I believe my brother and
[1:13:36] sister, you know that's called a chino.
[1:13:39] Amen. Now that comes from the original
[1:13:42] deal when the Republican party in the
[1:13:44] United States here got to fussing with
[1:13:46] each other and some said, "Well, they're
[1:13:48] not really they're really not
[1:13:50] Republicans." And somebody come up with
[1:13:52] a deal that they're rhinos, which is a
[1:13:55] Republican in name only.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; And it struck me one day. I thought,
[1:13:59] "Isn't that the truth?" Amen. There's a
[1:14:02] lot of chinos on the earth today.
[1:14:04] They're Christians in name only. I am
[1:14:07] not criticizing them. I just don't want
[1:14:10] to be one.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; I want to be a real Christian. And you
[1:14:14] know what? I'm not strong enough to be a
[1:14:16] real Christian. I do not have the
[1:14:19] discernment and and uh the anointing and
[1:14:22] all of this to be a real Christian. Is
[1:14:24] that shocking to you? Amen. So here I am
[1:14:27] today, a man preaching to you that does
[1:14:29] not have the ability to be a real
[1:14:32] Christian, but the Christ in me, amen,
[1:14:36] has empowered me where I can stand on
[1:14:39] the word. And it's the word that carries
[1:14:41] me through. I never caught myself. I
[1:14:44] never redeemed myself. I never discerned
[1:14:47] for myself. I never anointed myself.
[1:14:51] Every bit of that that's happened in my
[1:14:52] life was Christ in me.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as Christ is working with us,
[1:14:57] don't be afraid. Make sure that you're
[1:14:59] in Christ and you can't be deceived.
[1:15:02] Amen. You get in Christ, he'll lead you
[1:15:04] and guide you. But we're afraid of this.
[1:15:07] And we're afraid of wolves and sheep's
[1:15:08] clothing. Let me tell you, a real sheep,
[1:15:11] a real lamb of God can smell a wolf a
[1:15:13] mile away. Amen. Because that wolf will
[1:15:16] have a certain odor and it smells like
[1:15:19] sulfur from the pits of hell.
[1:15:23] And a real lamb of God can tell that.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "But I've never experienced
[1:15:29] that." Well, either you're naive. Pardon
[1:15:32] me for being blunt. You're either naive
[1:15:34] or God's been leading you and you never
[1:15:36] got close enough. So maybe we ought to
[1:15:38] lift a hand and say, "Thank you, Lord,
[1:15:40] that I never had to be deceived. I never
[1:15:42] come to that place cuz you've been
[1:15:44] leading me. You've been guiding me.
[1:15:46] You've been taking me, amen, through the
[1:15:49] path of my life that kept me away from
[1:15:51] the sulfur pit. K me kept me away from
[1:15:53] the wolf hiding in the bush. It kept me
[1:15:55] away from all of these things. But my
[1:15:57] brother and sister, God sometimes allows
[1:15:59] you to be tested. You don't really know
[1:16:01] the value of what's real until you've
[1:16:03] had the counterfeit.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; I'll just share a little brief story
[1:16:06] with you. One time I was doing
[1:16:08] construction work in Mountain Home out
[1:16:09] at the air base. And uh I had went I was
[1:16:12] going up there to be up there for
[1:16:13] several days and I'd went to the bank
[1:16:15] and went in there and and uh got a
[1:16:18] personal check and got a few hundred
[1:16:20] dollars in cash and and so then u we're
[1:16:23] up there working on the air base and of
[1:16:24] course you can't hang out on the air
[1:16:26] base. So every evening we go back into
[1:16:28] town we would eat and go back to our
[1:16:31] hotel and we ate in a little restaurant
[1:16:33] there and I went to pay my bill and I
[1:16:35] put a $50 bill on the counter and the
[1:16:37] young lady that was there had that
[1:16:39] marker. That's when they first came out.
[1:16:41] And she swipes that marker across that
[1:16:43] $50 bill, looks up at me, and says,
[1:16:45] "Sir, do you have another one?" And I
[1:16:47] said, "Yes." And I said, "Why?" And she
[1:16:48] says, "This one's counterfeit."
[1:16:53] You know, and I thought, "I'm going to
[1:16:54] prison.
[1:16:57] I'm doing all this explaining.
[1:17:00] I I got this from the bank. I mean, I
[1:17:02] can prove that I wrote a check and the
[1:17:04] bank gave me this money." And pull out
[1:17:06] another one. Same. Pull out another one.
[1:17:09] same. There was five of them.
[1:17:12] And I was like, "Oh man, I've been
[1:17:14] ripped off. How do I go back to the bank
[1:17:16] and prove that this actually came from
[1:17:17] the bank?" But you see, you know, God's
[1:17:20] got a solution for everything. The young
[1:17:22] lady looked at me and said, "Well, the
[1:17:24] other part, you know, the start of the
[1:17:26] advent of a tying a tavern or whatever
[1:17:30] to a restaurant, and you can go to this
[1:17:32] side or you can go to that side." And
[1:17:34] and uh she said, "I've got an answer for
[1:17:36] that." And she took that and went over
[1:17:39] into the other side, you know, through
[1:17:41] the door that went over in the other
[1:17:43] side and she exchanged it in their till.
[1:17:46] So she just gave them the counterfeit,
[1:17:48] brought me back real money. I wanted to
[1:17:51] hug her cuz it's like, you've solved my
[1:17:54] problem. She said, "Let them, the
[1:17:56] drunks, worry about it." Now, my brother
[1:17:59] and sister, God is going to take what is
[1:18:02] evil and make it good for you.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's things in life that you
[1:18:08] would say, "Oh, that could have
[1:18:09] destroyed my life." But if you have the
[1:18:12] opportunity one day to look, you'll find
[1:18:13] that God took those things that were
[1:18:16] evil and made them good for you. Amen.
[1:18:19] Leading you and guiding you into all
[1:18:21] truth. And this is what this message is
[1:18:24] meant for. Amen. To lead us. Amen. For
[1:18:27] the wisdom of this world is foolishness
[1:18:29] with God. For it is written, he that
[1:18:32] taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
[1:18:34] And again, the Lord knoweth the thoughts
[1:18:36] of the wise, that they are vain.
[1:18:39] Therefore, let no man glory in men. Boy,
[1:18:42] this should be a wakeup call for us.
[1:18:44] Don't Don't glory in no man. Amen. For
[1:18:48] all things are yours. Can you guys
[1:18:50] repeat that? Say that with me. For all
[1:18:54] things are yours.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; This is the word of God telling you that
[1:18:58] all things are yours. God's provided
[1:19:01] this for you. He's made a way before you
[1:19:04] to bring you everything that you need.
[1:19:08] Amen. Whether Paul or Apollos or Cphus
[1:19:10] or the world or life or death or things
[1:19:13] present or things to come, all are yours
[1:19:16] and ye are Christ and Christ is God's.
[1:19:19] Now, I'm going to go into a little
[1:19:21] thought here, and I don't want anybody
[1:19:24] misunderstand because I know that we
[1:19:25] have quite a few people taking higher
[1:19:27] education, and I don't want you to to
[1:19:30] misunderstand what I'm saying. But my
[1:19:32] brother and sister, as we'll go in our
[1:19:34] thought a little further today, you'll
[1:19:36] see how God looks at education, how he
[1:19:39] looks at knowledge in the sense. Now,
[1:19:42] that is not to come and say that you
[1:19:45] going to school, you're doing something
[1:19:46] wrong. Because what the word is talking
[1:19:49] about is when people believe they can
[1:19:52] have an experience with God through
[1:19:54] knowledge.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; So when they feel like that they can
[1:19:57] study enough to understand God. I want
[1:20:00] to know have any of you ever come close
[1:20:02] enough to understanding God? The only
[1:20:05] thing I know about God is what he
[1:20:06] revealed to me.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I could never sit down and figure
[1:20:10] out uh what God is, how God thinks, what
[1:20:13] God wants unless I had his word. and his
[1:20:16] word was open to me. So when he opens
[1:20:19] his word to us, my brother and sister,
[1:20:21] it's not our knowledge, it's his
[1:20:22] knowledge in us.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 1:22, professing themselves
[1:20:27] to be wise, they became fools. So we're
[1:20:30] not here today to to express how smart
[1:20:33] we are in the scripture in in uh all of
[1:20:37] the message or anything like that. What
[1:20:39] we're setting here is acknowledging that
[1:20:41] what we do know, what we do understand
[1:20:44] is God's revelation to us. He He has
[1:20:47] given us a portion. Now, if the word of
[1:20:49] God says that God has never lost a one,
[1:20:52] then you can rest here today on the very
[1:20:55] fact that you don't have to have an
[1:20:57] answer for everything.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; God will give you the answers that you
[1:21:08] need. Amen.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; To be the overcomer in this life.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need to figure out all of
[1:21:14] these other things. While they're trying
[1:21:15] to split the neutrons and protons and
[1:21:18] whatever else, they cannot make a blade
[1:21:20] of grass.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; So, you look at this, God's going to
[1:21:25] give you everything you need to make a
[1:21:27] rapture.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; So, if there's something you don't
[1:21:31] understand, don't get all bent out of
[1:21:32] shape over this and say, "Until I can't
[1:21:34] move forward till I have an answer for
[1:21:36] this." Just say, "Lord, when you want me
[1:21:39] to have an answer for that, just give it
[1:21:41] to me. I'll be here waiting, Lord. I'll
[1:21:44] be here believing, Lord. I'll be
[1:21:46] confessing, Lord. I don't have an
[1:21:48] answer, my brother and sister." But
[1:21:51] brother Isaac and I was just visiting in
[1:21:53] the back room for a minute. My brother
[1:21:54] and sister, I couldn't even repeat the
[1:21:56] conversation. It was a little complex
[1:21:58] for my simple mind. But my brother and
[1:22:00] sister, we're coming into a day as
[1:22:02] science comes. Now, the prophet of God
[1:22:04] said there'll be a day that science
[1:22:06] proves the word of God.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; And we are living in that day. They're
[1:22:10] coming talking about splitting protons
[1:22:12] and this that and the other and how all
[1:22:14] of these things and I should ask brother
[1:22:16] Isaac to come up and repeat some of
[1:22:18] those things, my brother and sister,
[1:22:20] because while I heard it, I my brain
[1:22:22] didn't quite comprehend all of it. But
[1:22:24] you see, they're figuring out what
[1:22:26] neutrons and protons and all these
[1:22:28] things will do and how they behave and
[1:22:31] how this is. My brother and sister, one
[1:22:32] of the examples Brother Isaac gave me is
[1:22:35] we could stand here today and we could
[1:22:37] stand over here and put a little target
[1:22:39] on the wall and we could take a rock and
[1:22:41] we could throw it and hit that target
[1:22:43] every single time or hit within a
[1:22:45] variation of that. But when you get into
[1:22:47] the matter of the universe and all of
[1:22:50] these things, they're a little more
[1:22:51] random, but there is nothing random with
[1:22:54] God.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. As you walk through this life, as
[1:22:57] you live this life, as you are going
[1:23:00] down life's journey, what is an answer?
[1:23:02] Maybe you think it's the same question
[1:23:04] and you say, "God answered their
[1:23:06] question. Why hasn't he answered mine?"
[1:23:08] Because God has sent it out to answer
[1:23:10] your question in a different time, a
[1:23:12] different place, in a different fashion
[1:23:13] to bring not a different result, but a
[1:23:16] result that's fitted to you.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; I've said this before. How many of you
[1:23:22] would like to be brother Paul?
[1:23:27] Boy, there's some weird expressions out
[1:23:29] there. They range everything from
[1:23:32] astonished to disgusted.
[1:23:34] But I'm telling you, you don't want to
[1:23:36] be me. But I don't want to offend you. I
[1:23:38] don't want to be you.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; I want to be who God called me to be
[1:23:44] because I've got my niche in the gospel
[1:23:47] to fulfill. You've got your niche in the
[1:23:49] gospel to fulfill. I don't want to be
[1:23:52] you cuz I might think that you've got an
[1:23:55] easier life than I do. But if I stepped
[1:23:57] into your shoes, I might be shocked.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; I might be shocked to find out the
[1:24:02] battle that you face and the things you
[1:24:04] have overcome. And then I might be over
[1:24:07] there wishing I was back in my own
[1:24:09] shoes.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Because God has equipped you.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Believe with me this morning. God has
[1:24:17] equipped you to overcome everything that
[1:24:21] comes your direction. Don't say, "I've
[1:24:23] got this insurmountable battle." Whether
[1:24:26] it's in our flesh that needs healing and
[1:24:28] whether we need a deliverance for
[1:24:30] something, God has made you more than
[1:24:32] able. He said, "You're more than a
[1:24:34] conqueror." And he said, "I made you to
[1:24:36] overcome that challenge." And we need to
[1:24:38] just stand and say, "Lord, I'm here. I'm
[1:24:41] reporting to my post of duty." Amen. I'm
[1:24:44] standing here today. I'm not ashamed of
[1:24:46] the gospel. I'm not ashamed of what I
[1:24:48] believe. And I have a living proof that
[1:24:51] God is walking with me. I have a living
[1:24:54] proof. Oh, can I venture here? I hope
[1:24:56] this isn't offensive. People are like,
[1:24:58] "Well, I I just got sent a deal, you
[1:25:01] know, and somebody's like, "Well,
[1:25:02] there's no vindication for his
[1:25:04] ministry." Well, my brother and sister,
[1:25:06] I can't find any vindication for their
[1:25:08] ministry.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So why am I going to believe
[1:25:14] what they say negative when there's not
[1:25:17] one single vindication for their
[1:25:20] ministry? But I'll tell you what I do
[1:25:22] have. I have vindication in my own life
[1:25:25] that God is leading me and guiding me.
[1:25:28] That he's a healer, that he's a savior,
[1:25:30] that he's a deliverer, that he is
[1:25:32] faithful. I have vindication of what God
[1:25:35] is doing in my life.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't need to look to someone
[1:25:38] else and say, "I've got to have this.
[1:25:41] I've got to have it. They've got to
[1:25:42] prove this to me. I tell you, if you've
[1:25:45] got a real experience with God, God has
[1:25:47] proven to you that he hears your
[1:25:50] prayers, that he heard your cry, that
[1:25:52] he's here for you, and he's here to
[1:25:54] deliver you. That's the vindication we
[1:25:57] need to look for.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; And besides that, I don't believe their
[1:26:01] words that there's no vindication.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; It wasn't proven enough to satisfy their
[1:26:09] unbelieving soul.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:12] only nothing will ever satisfy their
[1:26:15] unbelieving soul.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; My hopefully I'm not speaking too blunt
[1:26:24] because you see professing themselves to
[1:26:26] be wise they become fools.
[1:26:29] So let me put it this way. It is
[1:26:31] impossible. Now remember I'm not against
[1:26:33] education.
[1:26:35] If so I would be opposing my own
[1:26:37] granddaughter signed up for college. I
[1:26:39] would be I'm sorry for calling people
[1:26:41] out. I'd be opposed to Sister Alice. I'd
[1:26:45] be opposed to Sister Jennifer.
[1:26:49] I would be opposed to many of you.
[1:26:51] Right? I sat here today and I would be a
[1:26:53] hypocrite to say I'm opposed to you,
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; but I believe the word.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Because if you're living the word, you
[1:27:00] are the word.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; You can't say I'm with the word, but I'm
[1:27:04] opposed to it.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. So people say,
[1:27:07] "Well, Brother Brown was against
[1:27:08] education." No, he wasn't.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; He was against the negative influence
[1:27:13] that thinking you could educate yourself
[1:27:16] into the answer.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; It takes faith, my brother and sister,
[1:27:22] to activate the word of God, not
[1:27:24] education.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. I remember one time, if
[1:27:26] you don't mind me putting it this way on
[1:27:28] the internet, a man's like, "Well, we
[1:27:30] can't really truly understand these
[1:27:32] scriptures until we can find even the
[1:27:35] oldest form of the Aramaic. We won't be
[1:27:37] able to understand this." Well, he don't
[1:27:39] even have his hands on something. He
[1:27:41] says he needs to believe. I'll tell you,
[1:27:44] my brother and sister, I have my hands
[1:27:46] on something that I need to have to
[1:27:49] believe. And it's there that do I
[1:27:51] understand? Oh. Oh. You know, when they
[1:27:53] translated this Bible to English, they
[1:27:55] turned some of those words. Well, I'm
[1:27:57] not looking about what words they
[1:27:59] turned, my brother and sister. I'm
[1:28:01] looking to the promise that God said, "I
[1:28:03] will lead you. I will guide you. I will
[1:28:07] speak to your heart. I will write my
[1:28:09] word on the fleshly tables of your
[1:28:12] heart. I don't need some intellectual to
[1:28:15] tell me whether it's quite right or
[1:28:17] quite wrong. I've got a God that's here
[1:28:19] to tell me what is the truth. I've got a
[1:28:21] God that says, "Well, don't worry about
[1:28:23] that. I'm writing it on your heart."
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, people are counting on
[1:28:28] education here. Again, I just feel the
[1:28:31] need to confirm to you. I'm not opposed
[1:28:33] to education. I wasn't very good at it.
[1:28:37] You know, I mean, have to admit that.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; I have a teacher. I do business with
[1:28:44] him. He was my teacher in the seventh
[1:28:47] grade.
[1:28:48] He's got quite a vivid memory. Can tell
[1:28:50] you all about the attributes of all
[1:28:52] these students.
[1:28:54] And he told me, he says, 'You know,
[1:28:55] Paul, when you were in my classes, I had
[1:28:57] him in several different studies. He
[1:29:00] said, you know, it got down to the end
[1:29:01] of the year,
[1:29:03] almost like the daisy. Do I pass him or
[1:29:06] do I not? Do I pass him or do I not? But
[1:29:11] he said, "I knew while you wasn't a good
[1:29:14] student,
[1:29:16] you actually knew."
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Can you relate to that?
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; If you're a real believer, quote me a
[1:29:26] quote.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; If you're a real Christian, quote me
[1:29:30] some scripture.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Preferably two or three chapters to
[1:29:33] prove that you really can. Yeah,
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; we got stopped at the border coming out
[1:29:36] of Canada into United States once and
[1:29:38] the man was like, "Oh, so you were up
[1:29:40] there at that there that church?" "Yeah,
[1:29:43] how was the meetings?" "Oh, it was
[1:29:44] good." "Okay, what's your favorite
[1:29:46] scripture?
[1:29:48] Quote it to me." I'm looking at him
[1:29:50] like, "What's this got to do with
[1:29:52] crossing the border into the United
[1:29:54] States?" But see, he was trying to make
[1:29:56] a point.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; And finally, I got tired of it and I
[1:30:00] said, "Maybe we need to talk to your
[1:30:01] supervisor. You can go.
[1:30:04] But you see my brother and sister, this
[1:30:06] man's idea that if I could quote enough
[1:30:08] scripture, I was a real Christian.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; What I want to do is live it.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; I might not be so good at quoting it,
[1:30:17] but I want to be able to be really good
[1:30:19] at living it.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; And if Christ said, "I'll be with you,
[1:30:23] even in you," then we can live it. We
[1:30:26] don't have to sit back and say, "I'm
[1:30:27] trying. I'm trying." We will. Amen. So,
[1:30:30] it's impossible to educate ourselves
[1:30:32] into a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; It's that simple.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; All kinds of study won't replace
[1:30:42] something inside of you
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; that yearns to be in his presence.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; It won't replace a desire in you to make
[1:30:52] a rapture.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Because I can assure you, the
[1:30:56] encyclopedia is not taking the rapture.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:31:01] Matthew 11:25. At that time Jesus
[1:31:03] answered and said, "I thank thee, oh
[1:31:05] father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[1:31:07] because thou hast hid these things from
[1:31:08] the wise and prudent and hast revealed
[1:31:11] them unto babes." My And we also see
[1:31:14] that Luke shares the same account. Amen.
[1:31:17] And puts that out there because as it
[1:31:19] is, you're saying, "Brother Paul, this
[1:31:20] is nothing new. I don't have a job to
[1:31:22] tell you something new." Look, as a
[1:31:25] minister of this gospel, I don't have a
[1:31:26] job that has a job description. give
[1:31:29] them something new. I do have a
[1:31:31] description that says, "Stir up their
[1:31:32] pure minds in remembrance."
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; You guys heard that scripture before,
[1:31:38] right?
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; That's all my job is is stir up your
[1:31:41] pure minds. I thought about bringing a
[1:31:43] boat paddle
[1:31:45] maybe like as a decoration for the
[1:31:48] church. just kind of lean it up against
[1:31:49] the pulpit here. And when other people
[1:31:52] are looking like,
[1:31:54] I've heard this before. I could just
[1:31:56] grab a hold of that and come out here.
[1:32:02] Cuz that's all it is, my brother and
[1:32:03] sister. If it's not personal
[1:32:05] relationship and personal revelation to
[1:32:07] you, there's no amount of preaching will
[1:32:10] ever make it real to you.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; It's got to be God in you making it real
[1:32:15] to you. Amen. And it kind of even goes
[1:32:19] beyond that. If I can jump ahead of
[1:32:20] myself just a little bit, my brother and
[1:32:22] sister, if you are here saying, I I I've
[1:32:26] studied that. I know every quote the
[1:32:27] preacher knows. My brother and sister,
[1:32:29] then you need to step forward and claim
[1:32:33] what is rightfully yours.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can describe this.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; I got a phone call the other day, Mr.
[1:32:39] Hale, was you on this certain airplane
[1:32:42] flight? Yes, we were. And you were
[1:32:44] sitting in seat and named the seat. And
[1:32:46] I said, "Yes, we were. You left an
[1:32:49] article behind."
[1:32:55] Got my wallet, got my eyelasses.
[1:32:59] H what would I have left behind?
[1:33:05] I'm racking my brain.
[1:33:07] Oh, well, my wife
[1:33:11] has earbuds.
[1:33:15] Um,
[1:33:17] but she's got her phone because I've
[1:33:18] called her a dozen times.
[1:33:20] You'll hear her complain about that. But
[1:33:22] anyway, um, I call her all the time.
[1:33:25] She's got her phone. I know that. She's
[1:33:27] got her purse.
[1:33:29] I I was like, "Ma'am, I don't have a
[1:33:30] clue what I would have left behind." I
[1:33:33] said, "Can you give me a hint?" She's
[1:33:34] like, "No, nope. You have to clearly
[1:33:37] identify
[1:33:39] what it is you left behind."
[1:33:42] I talked to Jerry,
[1:33:44] we come a conclusion. It's somebody else
[1:33:49] that left something else behind, not us.
[1:33:54] Now, you say, "Where are you going,
[1:33:55] brother Paul?" I'm telling you, my
[1:33:57] brother and sister, the devil's going to
[1:33:59] come and tell you, you've missed it.
[1:34:01] You've left something behind. But I'm
[1:34:04] telling you, if you are in the word of
[1:34:07] God and the word is in you, there's
[1:34:10] nothing for you to leave behind because
[1:34:12] a real believer is going to take a hold
[1:34:15] of the word and say, "That's my promise.
[1:34:17] That's my word. That's my life. That's
[1:34:20] my healing. That's my provision. That's
[1:34:23] my salvation. I'm not leaving anything
[1:34:25] behind. There's not one thing that I'm
[1:34:28] going to step beyond and say that
[1:34:29] doesn't apply to me. Every bit of this
[1:34:31] revealed word of the hour applies to me
[1:34:34] and I'm claiming it. There might be
[1:34:36] others that have left something else
[1:34:37] behind, but as a real believer, I'm not
[1:34:40] going to leave one word of God behind.
[1:34:43] I'm going to believe every word of it.
[1:34:45] I'm going to say amen to it. Whether it
[1:34:47] pinches me, I'm going to say amen to it.
[1:34:49] Whether I understand it, I'm going to
[1:34:51] say amen to it. If it's the word, I'm
[1:34:53] going to say amen to it. Now my brother
[1:34:56] and sister, there'll be those that are
[1:34:57] there in that day that say, "Didn't we
[1:34:59] do many mighty works in your name?" But
[1:35:02] they missed it. They left something
[1:35:04] behind that they didn't take a hold of.
[1:35:07] Something behind that they didn't allow
[1:35:09] to be fulfilled in their life. They
[1:35:11] said, "That's not necessary. I don't
[1:35:13] need this." My brother and sister, it's
[1:35:15] become a little catch thing around the
[1:35:17] house there. You know, when God was
[1:35:19] talking with Moses, they're out there
[1:35:21] and the on the mount and the burning
[1:35:23] bush and God said, "Uh, take your shoes
[1:35:25] off, Moses."
[1:35:27] What if Moses would have turned around
[1:35:29] and said, "Well, Lord, it's more our
[1:35:31] custom. I'll take my hat off."
[1:35:36] Would it yield the same result?
[1:35:39] No. God said, "Take your shoes off." And
[1:35:42] when the word of God today tells us to
[1:35:44] do something, don't offer a substitute.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Don't say, "I don't want to take that,
[1:35:51] but I will take this."
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Come on. He didn't say if he wanted our
[1:35:55] hat off, he would have said, "Take your
[1:35:57] hat off." But he said, "Take your shoes
[1:35:59] off. Take your shoes off."
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you consecrate your life
[1:36:04] and give it fully to him and put it
[1:36:06] under the blood, Satan can't get to you.
[1:36:09] So let's don't offer I belong to this
[1:36:11] church. I belong to this. I've been a
[1:36:13] Christian for 50 years. My brother and
[1:36:16] sister, get under the blood. If he says
[1:36:17] getting under the blood is the answer to
[1:36:19] us, apply the token to your life. Don't
[1:36:22] say I've got an alternative to it. Our
[1:36:24] family's already always been in this
[1:36:26] church 100red years in this church. I've
[1:36:29] shared it in the church here. I'll share
[1:36:31] it again. I was come across this deal
[1:36:33] where a church was celebrating the 75th
[1:36:36] anniversary.
[1:36:38] Turns out the lady was 90 90 some years
[1:36:42] old.
[1:36:45] They were celebrating that she hadn't
[1:36:46] missed a service
[1:36:49] 75 years.
[1:36:51] That's pretty admirable.
[1:36:54] Okay, let's see a show of hands of
[1:36:56] anybody who's even in the running for
[1:36:57] that.
[1:37:02] But that's not your salvation.
[1:37:05] Perfect attendance in church is not your
[1:37:08] salvation.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; We can't rest on that. Oh, St. Peter,
[1:37:14] look at my award. I never missed a
[1:37:16] church service in 75 years. He's not
[1:37:20] caring about your church attendance.
[1:37:22] Even though the word says that you
[1:37:24] should be faithful, amen, to come to the
[1:37:26] house of God, you should be part of
[1:37:28] that. It's not an attendance reward.
[1:37:31] What did you get when you was in the
[1:37:33] house of God? Amen. What did God say to
[1:37:36] you from his word? Amen. Did we catch
[1:37:39] the promise?
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Hopefully this doesn't pinch anybody.
[1:37:59] You know, there was a time in the
[1:38:01] seasons, actually when I was reading
[1:38:03] about this, this was in Australia.
[1:38:07] There's all these men
[1:38:09] in Australia
[1:38:11] and uh hardly any women. And so, it
[1:38:15] become a great business venture for mail
[1:38:18] orderer brides.
[1:38:21] Now, how many of you sisters would want
[1:38:22] to go marry some guy, travel across the
[1:38:24] ocean for a few months to marry some guy
[1:38:26] you've never seen before?
[1:38:30] [Laughter]
[1:38:34] You gave your self away, Sister
[1:38:36] Jennifer.
[1:38:41] But you see what they had trust in.
[1:38:45] They said, "I want a husband. They need
[1:38:48] a wife.
[1:38:50] I'm going to trust that there's
[1:38:52] something good about this individual.
[1:38:55] And if not,
[1:38:58] I've got a problem. And this little
[1:39:00] story that they base this on talked
[1:39:03] about a young woman who traveled to
[1:39:05] Australia.
[1:39:07] And she gets there and it turns out the
[1:39:09] man that had she responded to abused
[1:39:12] everything around him, horses, cattle,
[1:39:15] whatever it was, he was an abuser.
[1:39:18] And so it looks like she's in a paradox.
[1:39:22] But she says, "You know what? I already
[1:39:26] made a promise to this guy. She had been
[1:39:28] raised a very faithful young lady in
[1:39:30] church. I made a promise to this guy
[1:39:31] already. It's like a vow. And people are
[1:39:34] telling her, "We'll defend you.
[1:39:37] Do not marry him. Do not go home with
[1:39:39] him. We'll defend you. He can't force
[1:39:41] you." And she just felt this
[1:39:43] overwhelming urge that I already made a
[1:39:46] vow.
[1:39:47] So, one of the first things, talk about
[1:39:49] standing your ground to the devil. One
[1:39:51] of the first things she did is right
[1:39:53] there in public, she looks him in the
[1:39:56] face and says, "Sir," and he's like,
[1:39:58] "What?
[1:39:59] You ever lay a hand on me in anything
[1:40:01] but tenderness?"
[1:40:03] This is a humble wife.
[1:40:08] Hope you're with me. Different idea what
[1:40:10] humble is.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; This a humble wife. You ever lay a hand
[1:40:15] on me except in tenderness,
[1:40:18] I'll kill you.
[1:40:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Sisters, were you here?
[1:40:29] Are you listening?
[1:40:31] I don't know how that would go over
[1:40:32] here.
[1:40:35] She said, "I just want you and I to
[1:40:36] start off in the right positions in our
[1:40:39] relationship. I'll be your wife. I'll
[1:40:41] bear your children. I'll clean your
[1:40:43] clothes. I'll clean your house. I'll
[1:40:45] take care of everything for you. but you
[1:40:48] must give me something in return.
[1:40:53] And as time went on, people are like,
[1:40:55] well, we're expecting something bad to
[1:40:56] go happen. But you see, what it was is
[1:40:59] she spoke the right words that he had
[1:41:02] covered up his inadequacy
[1:41:04] with anger and frustration. He covered
[1:41:07] up his inadequacy with all of the
[1:41:10] bluster. And when she spoke to him, was
[1:41:12] the man afraid of her killing him? I
[1:41:15] doubt it.
[1:41:17] But when she said, "You must give me
[1:41:20] something back in exchange."
[1:41:26] Think about our Lord Jesus Christ. He's
[1:41:29] given us life.
[1:41:31] He's given us everything. He's healed
[1:41:34] our bodies. Anyone been healed?
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's healed our bodies. He's given
[1:41:39] peace to our minds.
[1:41:42] He's done all of this here and all he is
[1:41:45] asking give me something back
[1:41:49] in exchange.
[1:41:53] And this is a revelation. You say, "But
[1:41:55] but but you know that's yeah, that's the
[1:41:57] gospel." No, my brothers and sisters, a
[1:41:59] lot of people claim the name of Christ
[1:42:01] that don't give back.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; They've never dug in deep enough to know
[1:42:07] what worship is. They think that singing
[1:42:09] a song and lifting a hand in church is
[1:42:11] worship.
[1:42:12] They think that reading their Bible is
[1:42:14] the answer.
[1:42:16] My brother and sister, God wants you.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; And he wants all of you.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; And he wants you for whatever purpose he
[1:42:25] has called you to.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; We don't get to define the purpose.
[1:42:30] Amen. Now, think about that little lady
[1:42:32] going there. She says, "I'll cook. I'll
[1:42:34] be your wife." That means intimacy.
[1:42:37] and I'll cook for you. I'll clean your
[1:42:39] clothes. I'll do all of this thing. I'll
[1:42:41] have I'll bear a family for you. But you
[1:42:44] got to give me something in return. And
[1:42:47] the Lord Jesus Christ has given you and
[1:42:48] I eternal life. And he's just asking us
[1:42:51] in the kindest, sweetest way. Just give
[1:42:54] me something back in return.
[1:42:59] Does he want your money?
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; No, my brother and sister. Just like the
[1:43:03] old joke of the guy showing up at the
[1:43:05] gate with St. Peter with a bag full of
[1:43:07] gold. And St. Peter says, "Why you got
[1:43:10] pavement with you?"
[1:43:12] That's what God thinks of our money.
[1:43:14] That's what he thinks of our wealth, our
[1:43:16] accomplishment, our fine clothes. He
[1:43:18] thinks about everything we done. He
[1:43:19] doesn't care about that. He said, "I
[1:43:22] want you."
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want is you. That's
[1:43:26] what the whole plan is is about you.
[1:43:28] Amen. And so, we're getting insight. The
[1:43:31] word of the hour, let me get back on
[1:43:33] track. The word of the hour is to give
[1:43:35] you and I insight into what this world,
[1:43:39] this time, this age is all about. It's
[1:43:43] not about just going to church. My
[1:43:45] brother and sister, now I just read a
[1:43:47] story the other day, just horrendous
[1:43:48] story. Won't even recount it to you of a
[1:43:50] man who was influential in his church,
[1:43:53] very known through the community and
[1:43:56] turned out to be, well, this will give
[1:43:58] it away. Turned out to be a mass
[1:43:59] murderer.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Going to church won't change you.
[1:44:04] Your position won't change you. What you
[1:44:06] have won't change you, but Christ will
[1:44:09] change you.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what he's looking for.
[1:44:13] But we're living in a day of spiritual
[1:44:14] blindness.
[1:44:16] Amen. We could start off today. If you
[1:44:18] don't mind, we could start off with um
[1:44:21] our attendance record today.
[1:44:24] Who would join in with me? But I'll
[1:44:26] break it next Sunday, so it won't do me
[1:44:28] any good.
[1:44:31] But you see, my brothers and sister,
[1:44:32] that's not what God's looking for. God's
[1:44:34] looking for us.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram says here in the
[1:44:39] sermon, why it is so uh why is it that
[1:44:43] so many Christians find it so hard to
[1:44:45] live the Christian life? Amen. Now, he
[1:44:49] he's making a point here. And this bird
[1:44:52] was made. No other bird could stand up
[1:44:54] there. The eagle's eye is the sharpest
[1:44:56] eye of any bird. Why? He can outdo the
[1:44:58] hawk in any way. Because the hawk has a
[1:45:00] sharp eye, but just for a certain
[1:45:02] distance. But the eagle is more powerful
[1:45:05] because he goes higher than the hawk. He
[1:45:07] goes up to where the hawk would die if
[1:45:09] he tried to come to him. His body is not
[1:45:12] made like that. Oh, how I could stop
[1:45:14] right here by the help of God and show
[1:45:16] you how some people try to climb to
[1:45:19] places where others stand. You just
[1:45:22] wasn't made that way. You just can't
[1:45:24] stand it. And these eagles would go up.
[1:45:26] Now he's shifting a gear here. Could
[1:45:28] King Hezekiah ever climb to where Elijah
[1:45:32] was?
[1:45:34] So, here's a king. Now, let's go on.
[1:45:36] Bump forward. Amen. Though he was the
[1:45:39] greatest man in the kingdom, the king.
[1:45:41] But when he turned his face to the wall
[1:45:43] and wept bitterly, God spoke to Isaiah
[1:45:46] to go to him. Isaiah could climb where
[1:45:48] Hezekiah could not.
[1:45:51] You see, God could have just come to
[1:45:54] Hezekiah and said, "Okay."
[1:45:56] But God always works through a channel.
[1:45:59] Go through your Bible. God always works
[1:46:01] through a channel. God doesn't change
[1:46:02] his mind. He's not subject to the whim
[1:46:04] of the day that we live in the 21st
[1:46:07] century. He's not subject to that. He
[1:46:09] mapped this all out before the
[1:46:11] foundation of the world. Amen. Uh so uh
[1:46:14] Hezekiah uh could speak a word here on
[1:46:18] earth as a hawk and everything bowed at
[1:46:20] his feet. Isaiah couldn't do that, but
[1:46:22] Isaiah could climb into a place where
[1:46:24] Hezekiah couldn't climb. All these
[1:46:26] things are for purposes. So God's ego
[1:46:29] eagle Ezekiel climbed up into a place
[1:46:32] where he could see some 15 18 yeah 2,500
[1:46:37] years ahead seeing things.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; And if you could go high enough above
[1:46:42] the earth,
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; How many of you experienced that?
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Looked out of the window of an airliner
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; and it's black over here
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; and the sun is rising
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; over here.
[1:46:55] Amen. Pretty common if you cross enough
[1:46:57] date lines.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You get to watch the sun rising
[1:47:01] while it's completely black
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; out the other side of the airplane.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Dark on one side, light on the other.
[1:47:08] So, you see the world over if you get
[1:47:10] high enough and your eyes could focus to
[1:47:12] that. So, Ezekiel climbed up so high
[1:47:14] that he saw our day.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; what? Go back and read Ezekiel.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you'll find that he was
[1:47:22] looking out and describing exactly
[1:47:24] what's happening in our day. It's right
[1:47:26] there in the word.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; God's eagle. And he told us what would
[1:47:31] take place in this day. Now, I want to
[1:47:33] ask you something. The church seems to
[1:47:35] be out of cater somewhere. Now, we've
[1:47:39] got at least a good hour here.
[1:47:42] I didn't hear anybody say amen.
[1:47:46] We've got at least a good hour here. So,
[1:47:48] let's just sit down and take our helmets
[1:47:50] off and listen for just a few minutes.
[1:47:52] Now, notice if God intended his church
[1:47:54] to be run upon intellectuals, then it
[1:47:57] doesn't take the Holy Spirit to do
[1:47:59] anything in the church, right? So, this
[1:48:02] isn't I studied the message and I I see
[1:48:04] that it's right. It lines up with the
[1:48:06] word of God. Don't let your
[1:48:07] intellectuals run how you see the word,
[1:48:10] what you believe, and how your life is
[1:48:12] guided. It takes something more than
[1:48:14] that. Amen. So, it's there. It could be
[1:48:17] run upon intellectuals and it doesn't
[1:48:19] take the Holy Spirit to do anything in
[1:48:20] the church. We do not need the Holy
[1:48:23] Spirit if the church is to be run upon
[1:48:25] intellectuals.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to just catch this. You
[1:48:28] know this, but I'm just stirring up pure
[1:48:29] minds and remembrance. What is the world
[1:48:31] come today? There's many denominations.
[1:48:33] I won't even name names because that
[1:48:35] wouldn't be fair. But if you do not hold
[1:48:38] the equivalent of a master's,
[1:48:42] you will not even be considered to
[1:48:45] pastor their larger churches.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; I already read you the scripture that
[1:48:52] says he hides it in the eyes of the wise
[1:48:54] and prudent.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; And reveals it to babes.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; But look how man's got involved and he's
[1:49:00] turned this around.
[1:49:03] Now, brother and sister,
[1:49:05] I'll put it this way. There are some
[1:49:07] people opposed to the preachers, this
[1:49:10] spitting, slobber, and mistake making,
[1:49:13] mispronouncing preachers.
[1:49:19] But what I want to know is what did God
[1:49:20] think?
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; God said, I love this. We want a perfect
[1:49:27] preacher to pe speak to imperfect
[1:49:29] people.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So maybe if you want to have a
[1:49:34] perfect preacher, maybe you need to
[1:49:36] become perfect people first and then you
[1:49:38] could find the perfect preacher.
[1:49:43] But I like how it was said,
[1:49:46] if you think it's perfect, it won't be
[1:49:48] when you get there.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz God said, I've already tooken
[1:49:53] account
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; your imperfection.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; You do not have to be perfect.
[1:50:00] Now, this might baffle some of you. I
[1:50:01] don't mean to offend no one,
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; but you don't have to listen very long.
[1:50:06] And here, brother Brandham, I was
[1:50:07] listening to him the other day,
[1:50:08] corrected himself three times in a row,
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; is that a perfect person? No, sir. It
[1:50:16] was a perfect God using a person.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; The same way that God, a perfect God
[1:50:23] will use you and I today. Because if we
[1:50:28] have to get perfect before he'll use us,
[1:50:30] my brother and sister, then do we need
[1:50:32] to be saved? Do we need to have the word
[1:50:34] washing us all the time? No. This is the
[1:50:37] plan of God. This is how God is working.
[1:50:39] He takes the imperfect people and his
[1:50:42] word and his anointing changes them and
[1:50:46] brings them to the place that God says
[1:50:48] they're perfect. And if you want to
[1:50:50] apply that, you could take that to see
[1:50:52] that Enoch, we have an idea when we talk
[1:50:54] about perfection, that Enoch was just
[1:50:56] this perfect guy that pleased God. And
[1:50:58] it was. He was a guy that pleased God.
[1:51:01] Amen. His life pleased God. But if you
[1:51:03] think that Enoch was the absolute
[1:51:06] epitome of perfection, my brother and
[1:51:08] sister, you've missed it. Enoch was a
[1:51:10] guy that was completely sold out to God.
[1:51:12] Gave his life to God, trusted God,
[1:51:15] confessed everything of the word, did
[1:51:17] his best to live it, and repented when
[1:51:19] he made a mistake and God says, "You're
[1:51:21] perfect in my eyes. I'm taking you
[1:51:23] home." Now, to clarify that, if Enoch
[1:51:27] had been the perfect guy, wouldn't God
[1:51:30] be obligated
[1:51:32] to make you the perfect guy?
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Certainly.
[1:51:39] Or is Enoch another social class up from
[1:51:41] you?
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; The same word that says there's no
[1:51:45] respector of persons would then be
[1:51:47] respecting persons.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I don't mean that to be
[1:51:53] offensive. What I'm trying to tell you,
[1:51:54] if I could put it in words, is that God
[1:51:56] has the ability to take you and I and
[1:51:58] make us perfect.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not going to be perfect in
[1:52:02] oursel. It's God in us. Christ in you,
[1:52:04] the hope of glory. It's going to be God
[1:52:06] that makes this. And when you're looking
[1:52:08] for a perfect bride, you need to look
[1:52:10] for God first.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when you find God, you
[1:52:13] will find perfection.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; You look at mankind, you will not find
[1:52:18] perfection. But God says, "I know how to
[1:52:20] make you perfect. I'll be with you, even
[1:52:23] in you." Amen. And you can't have Christ
[1:52:26] inside of you without the word changing
[1:52:29] you. Amen. Without being changed into
[1:52:32] this perfection that the word is talking
[1:52:34] about. This is what God wants us to do.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Trust him.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Believe him.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; And then act upon what he shows us.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Church seems out of cater. We got the
[1:52:47] hour. Let's see. If God intended his
[1:52:48] church to be run upon intellectuals,
[1:52:50] then it doesn't take the Holy Spirit to
[1:52:52] do anything in the church. We do not
[1:52:54] need the Holy Spirit. If the church is
[1:52:56] to be run upon intellectuals,
[1:53:00] I like this as this quote goes on. Amen.
[1:53:03] then we should find the smartest man. Um
[1:53:06] anyway, God bless you all. I'm I'm
[1:53:08] leaving because um I do not qualify
[1:53:13] as a bump on the smartest man.
[1:53:17] Okay. Do I finish the sermon? Do I
[1:53:20] leave?
[1:53:24] I don't really claim it as my identity,
[1:53:26] but I'll tell you, I've proven it enough
[1:53:28] times to believe it. I'm dumb as a rock,
[1:53:31] but rocks got their place.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mountains are not made out of
[1:53:35] sand.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; They're made out of rocks. Amen. So, you
[1:53:39] look at this, my brother and sister.
[1:53:41] Every one of us has a purpose for our
[1:53:42] place in the economy of God. Amen. So,
[1:53:47] find the smartest man we could find to
[1:53:49] be our pastor and the biggest buildings
[1:53:51] that we could build and more members we
[1:53:53] get into our church and root out the
[1:53:55] illiterate. another excuse for me to
[1:53:57] call goodbye
[1:54:00] and bring in the intellectual. Better
[1:54:03] the church would be if that is the
[1:54:06] program. If that's the program, the
[1:54:07] smarter the preacher, the smarter the
[1:54:09] congregation, the more intellectual they
[1:54:11] are, the better the church will be. But
[1:54:14] I can't find one place in all the holy
[1:54:16] scripture where God's church is to be
[1:54:18] run upon the wisdom of men.
[1:54:21] And as long as we try to run it upon the
[1:54:23] intellectual of man, we're absolutely
[1:54:26] fighting the air.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's move on here. God's church
[1:54:31] is to be run by the baptism of the Holy
[1:54:33] Ghost. Can we get an amen out of this?
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's to be run by the baptism of
[1:54:37] the Holy Ghost. Then if we have the
[1:54:39] baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[1:54:41] Spirit is going to run the church, then
[1:54:43] it doesn't take too much intellectual.
[1:54:46] It doesn't take education. It takes the
[1:54:48] Holy Spirit. That's God's program. Now,
[1:54:51] we know that we don't have to find the
[1:54:53] smartest people in the city to make our
[1:54:55] church better. We don't have to find the
[1:54:57] best dressed people in the city to make
[1:54:59] our church better. We don't need the
[1:55:01] biggest crowds in the city to make our
[1:55:03] church better. We need the guidance of
[1:55:06] the Holy Spirit to make our church
[1:55:08] better.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We would look down upon so many of
[1:55:14] those in those age of the apostles. We
[1:55:17] would look down upon it because the
[1:55:19] scripture shows us that they were poor
[1:55:21] and uneducated. They were illiterate,
[1:55:23] but they were people that were seeking
[1:55:25] the leadership of the Holy Spirit. They
[1:55:28] wanted God to speak to them. They didn't
[1:55:30] need a highly polished man. They wanted
[1:55:32] God to speak. And sometimes, I know it's
[1:55:35] hard for people to believe, but
[1:55:36] sometimes God chooses to use that
[1:55:39] spitting and sputtering and whatever man
[1:55:41] to do that to be able to bring the word
[1:55:44] of God because it's not the man anyhow.
[1:55:47] It's the Holy Ghost in the man.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the Holy Ghost in you
[1:55:52] that's going to bring you to a rapture.
[1:55:54] It's the Holy Ghost in you that's going
[1:55:56] to bring you as a church of the Almighty
[1:55:59] into a victorious march into glory.
[1:56:01] It'll never be the church you attended.
[1:56:04] It'll never be whoever taught you. It'll
[1:56:07] never be how far you went in school.
[1:56:10] Although I believe that's beneficial in
[1:56:12] the day that we live in. Amen. It
[1:56:13] requires more and more understanding of
[1:56:15] the things to make a good living. But
[1:56:17] that school won't put you in a rapture.
[1:56:19] In fact, the universities are proven to
[1:56:23] actually be evil. They're wicked.
[1:56:26] There's all kinds of all kinds of
[1:56:28] nonsense there.
[1:56:31] So, those of you going to school, I'll
[1:56:34] just take two seconds and share my
[1:56:35] philosophy.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Go to school, get that education,
[1:56:41] but before you go, seek ye first the
[1:56:44] kingdom of God.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to go out there. You're
[1:56:49] admitting the devil's going to whip you
[1:56:51] when you go to college.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; No, that's not what that's not what the
[1:56:55] word says. The word says if you're under
[1:56:58] the blood, he can't even get to you.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who wants to be under the
[1:57:03] blood?
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the real goal is. Is
[1:57:06] just to be under the blood. Amen. We
[1:57:08] don't have to worry about what Satan's
[1:57:10] got. He can roar, but my brother and
[1:57:12] sister, he's a toothless lion.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And isn't it amazing when we use
[1:57:16] that as a reference? Lion and lion.
[1:57:20] Yeah. And he's a toothless liar. Amen.
[1:57:23] because his lies, there's nothing to
[1:57:26] them if you're under the blood.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Now look, I need to I need to quit. I
[1:57:32] needed to have quit a long time ago. Why
[1:57:34] didn't somebody yell time?
[1:57:40] Brother Ivan's too nice. He wouldn't
[1:57:42] have drugged you out.
[1:57:47] I already preached that page. Do you?
[1:57:48] Let's go on.
[1:57:53] Ephesians 3:9-11.
[1:57:59] You can just grab that real quick and
[1:58:01] read that as homework for yourself.
[1:58:05] Let's go down here into the revelation
[1:58:06] of Jesus Christ and then then we'll
[1:58:09] close.
[1:58:12] Now, we've been talking about the
[1:58:14] offices and manifestations of one true
[1:58:16] God and beholding his glory in the
[1:58:18] scriptural study, but he is not to be
[1:58:21] known intellectually. That's right.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; He is known spiritually.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; By spiritual revelation,
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; The same one who is known as Jesus after
[1:58:32] the flesh went back to the pillar of
[1:58:35] fire.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:36] But he promised he would come again and
[1:58:38] dwell amongst his people by the spirit.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; And on the day of Pentecost, that pillar
[1:58:43] of fire came down and separated itself
[1:58:46] in tongues of fire upon each one of
[1:58:48] them. Now, do we believe this word?
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; We believe this scripture.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; That means that equally to you and I
[1:58:56] that tongues of fire, the Holy Ghost has
[1:58:58] fallen. Amen. It's not just in a class
[1:59:01] called the preachers. It's not in a
[1:59:03] class over here. It's not in a class
[1:59:05] there. But the prophet of God is
[1:59:07] declaring that that pillar of fire come
[1:59:09] down is the Holy Ghost and has fallen on
[1:59:12] you and I. I'm here today. I might not
[1:59:16] be near as spiritual. I'm not as
[1:59:17] spiritual as you probably think I am.
[1:59:19] Amen. I'm a guy. I made it. I realized
[1:59:22] on the way to church it's like, "Oh,
[1:59:23] I've got grease and dirt under my
[1:59:24] fingernails. That isn't very appealing.
[1:59:27] I did my best to clean them out, but
[1:59:29] it's still there." That's me. That's
[1:59:31] Paul. I understand dirt.
[1:59:35] Some of you are really smart.
[1:59:37] I say that kindly. I say that in a
[1:59:39] positive way. But when it comes to
[1:59:42] salvation, your intelligence won't save
[1:59:44] you.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; And I can't use my lack of intelligence
[1:59:48] as an excuse.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; You have equal opportunity. I have equal
[1:59:54] opportunity because that pillar of fire
[1:59:58] has come down upon God's people.
[2:00:02] I I'm not worthy, Lord. Do you realize
[2:00:04] what you're saying? You're telling God,
[2:00:06] "You made a mistake, Lord."
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Does God make mistakes?
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's Let's have a little
[2:00:15] rubber meet the road today.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Get that out of your vocabulary. I'm not
[2:00:19] worthy. I I just should have prayed
[2:00:20] about this. I should have done this, but
[2:00:21] I'm not worthy. If God said you're
[2:00:23] worthy, you're worthy. Amen.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; And if he wants to come down and pour
[2:00:27] himself into you, who are you to stand
[2:00:31] here and say, "Don't do it, Lord. I'm
[2:00:33] not worthy." He said, "I'm going to let
[2:00:35] my fire come down upon you and fill your
[2:00:39] soul and cleanse you." And we're over
[2:00:42] here saying, "Don't do it, Lord.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. It's time for us to
[2:00:47] claim our portion."
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; God said, "I want to bless you. I want
[2:00:50] to give you the Holy Ghost. I want to
[2:00:52] pour myself into you." We need to stand
[2:00:54] up and say, "Lord, there's some things
[2:00:56] in this life I don't understand, but I
[2:00:58] receive it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:01:00] You want to pour your Holy Spirit into
[2:01:02] me. Lord, I gladly receive it." Because
[2:01:06] once the Holy Ghost is in me, it will
[2:01:09] make me worthy.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, my brother and sister. We
[2:01:13] got it backwards. We want to be perfect
[2:01:15] thinking then God will come. God says,
[2:01:17] "I want a vessel that will let me make
[2:01:20] them perfect."
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Excuse me for getting
[2:01:27] excited today.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Same one is known as Jesus after
[2:01:32] the flesh went back to the pillar of
[2:01:33] fire. He promised he'd come again and
[2:01:35] dwelt among his people by the spirit.
[2:01:37] And on the day of Pentecost, that pillar
[2:01:38] of fire come down, separated itself in
[2:01:41] tongues of fire upon each one of them.
[2:01:43] That what was God doing? He was
[2:01:46] separating himself into the church,
[2:01:48] giving all those men and women a part
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; of himself. Amen.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Imagine
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; this might almost sound like Santa
[2:01:56] Claus,
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; but imagine here we are in church today.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; The God you can't see, but you feel the
[2:02:02] God that you know by the word. He
[2:02:04] promised, "I'll be there two or three in
[2:02:07] my name."
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; And God's come down and he's saying,
[2:02:10] "Here,
[2:02:12] take a little of me.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Take a little of me. Take a little of
[2:02:17] me. Take a little of me.
[2:02:21] Take a
[2:02:27] If you knew what I did yesterday. I do.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, if you I know.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Take a little of me.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; But Lord, just take me.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Just receive me.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Don't give me your excuse.
[2:02:50] Don't fabricate a reason why not. Just
[2:02:53] simply say, "Lord, if you're giving
[2:02:54] yourself to me, I receive you."
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what it is. When the word
[2:03:03] comes,
[2:03:04] the minute that God starts to move
[2:03:06] handing out,
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; I lied. I was jealous. I had a temper
[2:03:13] tantrum. I did this. I did that. I
[2:03:16] remember that piece of bubble gum I
[2:03:18] stole in the first grade.
[2:03:20] No, no. Let me tell you saints in
[2:03:23] closing. If God offers himself to you,
[2:03:28] just say, "Lord,
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; I receive.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to accept what you've
[2:03:33] offered."
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; In my mind, my consciousness, my spirit,
[2:03:38] I might think, "Lord, I am not worthy."
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; But our Lord knows.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Our Lord knows.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm going to offer myself
[2:03:48] to you. Amen.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Just receive.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Could we just stand?
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe just lift the hand to the Lord and
[2:03:57] say, "Lord, I receive."
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We look at this.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; He's giving himself to us. May God just
[2:04:07] touch our hearts today. Amen. That we
[2:04:10] could stand in the word and say, "Lord,
[2:04:12] you've come.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; You've opened your word. You've poured
[2:04:15] your spirit out.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, I'm here.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; We could go into these things and
[2:04:21] saints, we can acknowledge this. I made
[2:04:23] mistakes yesterday.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; I made mistakes even maybe this morning,
[2:04:28] sir.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; But God's here.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Saying, I want to give myself to you.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Would you receive me?
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Would you take me in as a friend? Would
[2:04:36] you invite me into your life, into your
[2:04:38] house, into everything about you?
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; cause you to offer an excuse why not.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. and just say, "Lord,
[2:04:47] come."
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Fill me, Lord.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; I want to receive you.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God's grace, saints.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; It's God's grace.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; If he chose you on merit, I don't mean
[2:05:01] to break any atmosphere, but if he chose
[2:05:03] you on merit today, not one of you would
[2:05:05] have made the cut.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Just stop and think about it. Not one of
[2:05:10] us here, not one of us would make the
[2:05:13] cut if it was on our merit. Amen.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; But unmarited favor, God's grace, he
[2:05:19] says,
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to pour myself into you.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; A people who were not a people but are
[2:05:25] now my people.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad you belong to
[2:05:30] Jesus Christ?
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Come Holy Spirit.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Ivan 188, please.
[2:05:40] Amen.
[2:05:45] Just let the Lord speak to your heart.
[2:05:47] Let him guide your footsteps.
[2:05:51] Oh, come
[2:05:54] Holy Spirit.
[2:05:57] I need thee.
[2:06:04] Come,
[2:06:06] sweet spirit,
[2:06:09] I pray.
[2:06:16] Come
[2:06:18] in thy strength and thy power,
[2:06:24] my Lord.
[2:06:27] Oh, come
[2:06:30] in thine own gentle
[2:06:34] way.
[2:06:37] Oh, come
[2:06:40] Holy Spirit.
[2:06:44] I need thee truly today, Lord. I need
[2:06:48] thee.
[2:06:51] Come,
[2:06:53] sweet spirit,
[2:06:57] I pray.
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:04] Come
[2:07:06] in thy strength and thy power,
[2:07:13] oh Lord.
[2:07:16] Oh, come
[2:07:19] in thine own gentle
[2:07:23] way.
[2:07:25] 893. Brother Ivan, I want to just feel
[2:07:29] like the Lord's moving on me. I want to
[2:07:30] give clarity when I was saying about
[2:07:32] brother Brandham correcting himself.
[2:07:35] My brother and sister, God sent a
[2:07:36] prophet and brought a perfect word to
[2:07:38] us.
[2:07:40] Amen.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; He didn't say the man himself's got to
[2:07:43] be perfect. If you can't look and see
[2:07:46] that there were things that he come back
[2:07:48] and corrected, then you're ignoring it.
[2:07:51] But I want you to understand, it was a
[2:07:53] perfect word of God that came from the
[2:07:56] throne of God for you and I. because
[2:08:00] nothing less than that would be
[2:08:03] sufficient to redeem us.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; And the prophet stood there and says,
[2:08:08] "Hear I am God's voice." That's right.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; To you.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was it? The word coming.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Unadulterated
[2:08:19] to the hearts and lives of sons and
[2:08:21] daughters of God. It would take a
[2:08:23] perfect word to redeem a perfect bride.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that word has come and this
[2:08:30] perfect bride is now in manifestation in
[2:08:34] the day that we live in.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother and sister, God knows what
[2:08:38] he's doing.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; We don't need to define what perfection
[2:08:42] is. We need to let God define what
[2:08:44] perfection is. Cuz you could look at
[2:08:46] your own life and say, "Oh, I've got so
[2:08:50] much. There's so many things in my life
[2:08:52] I need to do." And God will be looking
[2:08:54] down at you in faith and saying, "You're
[2:08:56] perfect.
[2:08:59] Let me drive that home. Who would be
[2:09:01] brave enough right now to lift their
[2:09:02] hand and say, "I'm perfect."
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; We should be lifting a hand. We have the
[2:09:09] word of the hour. We are perfect in
[2:09:12] God's eyes. Amen. The blood's still
[2:09:15] washing. The blood's still perfecting.
[2:09:17] Yes. But we are perfect in God's eyes.
[2:09:19] Amen. He doesn't look down and say,
[2:09:22] "Well, look at that rotten bunch of no
[2:09:24] good people. I guess I'll just have to
[2:09:27] keep beating on them until they get in
[2:09:29] line. No, he looks down and says, "This
[2:09:30] is my bride."
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, I'll just bring
[2:09:34] more clarity to you. I'm not the least
[2:09:37] bit ashamed to say, "I'll be happy one
[2:09:39] day." As the church ages, shows us very
[2:09:41] clearly in the scripture that each age,
[2:09:44] each messenger age will stand with the
[2:09:46] messenger of their age. And they will be
[2:09:48] identified with that messenger. And I'll
[2:09:50] tell you right now, I'm not the least
[2:09:52] bit ashamed to stand with the messenger
[2:09:53] of my day. I'm not the least bit ashamed
[2:09:56] to stand and say thank you Lord that you
[2:09:59] sent this man. Amen. You used this man.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to undermine that. But
[2:10:06] I want to tell you some of us needed
[2:10:09] someone. I'll just give this to you.
[2:10:12] When I was living in that limbo land,
[2:10:14] married, three children, struggling to
[2:10:16] serve God,
[2:10:19] and I would hear Brother Brandham say
[2:10:20] certain things.
[2:10:22] Let me just stir up your memory on that
[2:10:25] one.
[2:10:27] Phone rings,
[2:10:29] gets up, walks out the door. As he steps
[2:10:33] out the door, tell him I'm not here.
[2:10:37] Some people would say, "Boy, that's
[2:10:39] that's just that's just terrible." I'll
[2:10:41] tell you, for this boy at that stage of
[2:10:43] my life, I realized if God's prophet
[2:10:45] could be caught in that kind of a
[2:10:47] circumstance, there's hope for me.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; There's hope for me. Oh my. And it
[2:10:54] stirred in my heart to realize what I
[2:10:56] was trying to be and what God was
[2:10:59] allowing and molding me to be. I had the
[2:11:02] wrong perspective.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Was that an error? No, it's perfect. You
[2:11:06] say, "But brother Paul, what?" No. Maybe
[2:11:07] it was just for me. Maybe your life
[2:11:10] never reflected that. Maybe your life
[2:11:12] never needed that circumstance, but I
[2:11:14] needed that in that day. And God allowed
[2:11:16] that to come and speak to my heart and
[2:11:18] say, "You know what, Paul? You're saying
[2:11:20] you'll fully serve God when you can
[2:11:21] reach this milestone. How about you just
[2:11:24] serve God regardless of what milestone
[2:11:26] you're at and I'll take care of the
[2:11:28] rest.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And then God leads his
[2:11:32] dear children along. Hallelujah.
[2:11:35] [Music]
[2:11:37] Oh, Father,
[2:11:39] see that you are drawing
[2:11:43] a line in the sand. I want to be
[2:11:48] standing on your side.
[2:11:52] Oh, holding
[2:11:54] your hand. So let your kingom
[2:11:58] come.
[2:12:00] Let it
[2:12:02] be me. This is my voice.
[2:12:08] This is my plea.
[2:12:13] I see that you are standing.
[2:12:17] I lie in the sand. Want to be standing
[2:12:22] on your side.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hold in your hand. So let your
[2:12:30] kingom come.
[2:12:33] Let your word be me. This is my prayer.
[2:12:41] This is my plea.
[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:46] Let the worippers arise.
[2:12:54] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[2:12:59] [Music]
[2:13:02] I'm surrendering
[2:13:04] my all.
[2:13:10] I surrender to my king.
[2:13:19] Father, I hear it growing louder.
[2:13:24] The song of your redeemed as the saints
[2:13:29] of every nation
[2:13:32] are awakening to sing. From our hearts
[2:13:37] there comes an anthem.
[2:13:40] Oh, hear the heavens ring. This is our
[2:13:44] song
[2:13:47] unto our king.
[2:13:52] Let the worippers arise.
[2:14:00] Let the sons and the daughters receive.
[2:14:08] I'm surrendering
[2:14:10] my all.
[2:14:16] I surrender to the king.
[2:14:21] Amen. Let the worippers arise.
[2:14:30] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[2:14:38] I'm surrendering
[2:14:40] my all.
[2:14:46] I surrender to the king.
[2:14:54] Amen. Hallelujah. you surrendering your
[2:14:57] all this morning.
[2:14:59] Amen. As he was closing out there, I
[2:15:02] just couldn't help that song, uh, I want
[2:15:04] that kind of blessing. You want that
[2:15:06] this morning? You want that for your
[2:15:09] life?
[2:15:10] Are you committed to him? You trusting
[2:15:13] in him? Lord,
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; he will bring it to pass. That what the
[2:15:16] word says. Amen. Amen. You believe that?
[2:15:21] When Jacob met the Lord upon that lonely
[2:15:26] night and wrestled there alone
[2:15:30] until the morning light,
[2:15:33] he won a princely title to gert him for
[2:15:37] the ride. I want that kind of blessing.
[2:15:44] I want I want that kind of blessing.
[2:15:50] King that saves and keeps and satisfies
[2:15:54] my soul. I want I want that full
[2:16:00] salvation till billows of heaven or me
[2:16:05] ro.
[2:16:07] When Israel at last came into Canaan's
[2:16:12] land, the Lord his riches gave so full
[2:16:17] on every hand. They drove their foes
[2:16:20] before them and dwelt a happy bank. I
[2:16:25] want that kind of blessing.
[2:16:31] I want I want that kind of blessing that
[2:16:37] saves and keeps and satisfies my soul. I
[2:16:43] want I want at full salvation till
[2:16:49] billows of heaven or me roll.
[2:16:54] This is the day of grace. The comforter
[2:16:58] is here. We are a chosen race. Our God
[2:17:03] is drawing near. He's waiting to be
[2:17:07] gracious of prayer of faith to hear. And
[2:17:12] then he'll send the blessing.
[2:17:18] Won't I want that kind of blessing that
[2:17:23] saves and keeps and satisfies the soul.
[2:17:29] I want I want that full salvation till
[2:17:35] billows of heaven or me roll.

[2:17:46] saves and keeps and satisfies my soul. I
[2:17:52] want I want that full salvation till
[2:17:58] billows of heaven or me roll.
[2:18:04] Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. I'd like
[2:18:09] to just sing as we are dismissed today.
