[32:46] verse 18
[32:49] i ask you to turn your bibles but i
[32:50] didn't tell you where to turn to
[32:52] sorry matthew chapter 1 verse 18.
[32:56] amen
[33:03] now the birth of jesus christ was on
[33:05] this wise
[33:06] when as his mother mary was espoused to
[33:08] joseph before they came together she was
[33:11] found with child of the holy ghost
[33:13] then joseph her husband being a just man
[33:15] and not willing to make her a public
[33:17] example
[33:18] was minded to put her away privily
[33:22] but while he thought on these things
[33:25] behold the angel of the lord appeared
[33:27] unto him in a dream
[33:29] saying joseph thou son of david fear not
[33:31] to take unto thee mary thy wife
[33:34] for that which is conceived in her is of
[33:36] the holy ghost
[33:38] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[33:41] shalt call his name jesus
[33:43] for he shall save his people from their
[33:45] sins
[33:46] now all this was done that it might be
[33:48] fulfilled which was spoken of the lord
[33:49] by the prophet saying behold a virgin
[33:51] shall be with child
[33:53] and shall bring forth a son and they
[33:56] shall call his name immanuel which
[33:58] being interpreted is god with us then
[34:01] joseph being raised from
[34:02] sleep did as the angel of the lord had
[34:04] bitten him and took unto him his wife
[34:07] and he and knew her not till she had
[34:09] brought forth her firstborn son
[34:11] and he called his name jesus
[34:14] isaiah 7 14.
[34:23] can we maybe turn this monitor down just
[34:25] a tad bit here thank you
[34:28] isaiah 7 14.
[34:43] okay isaiah 7 14
[34:46] therefore the lord himself shall give
[34:49] you a sign
[34:50] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[34:53] a son
[34:54] and shall call his name emmanuel
[34:59] that's bar heads heavenly father lord
[35:02] jesus we thank you for this opportunity
[35:04] this morning to
[35:06] get to hear from you lord it's it's a
[35:10] privilege lord many people call
[35:13] themselves
[35:14] christians yet this morning all they'll
[35:16] hear is the thoughts and ideas of a man
[35:18] but
[35:19] lord you have so called and so
[35:20] foreordained us in this position that we
[35:23] get to hear from you
[35:25] lord i give myself to you and i ask that
[35:27] none of my thoughts none of my opinions
[35:30] would come across the desk this morning
[35:32] but father it would be strictly and
[35:34] totally you lord
[35:36] i just surrender to you each one i pray
[35:38] would do the same this morning that
[35:40] father
[35:41] even lord jesus would they hear
[35:43] something they
[35:44] hadn't understood before they would be
[35:46] open lord jesus that father you could
[35:48] deal with their hearts lord jesus
[35:50] knowing all things are done for the
[35:52] glory of god we commit these words into
[35:54] your hands and pray that you
[35:55] just speak to our hearts this morning be
[35:58] with our pastor eyes he's away may he be
[36:00] refreshed lord in his time
[36:03] lord and once again we remember sister
[36:04] conscious tomorrow
[36:06] thank you lord commit all these things
[36:07] into your hands in jesus name we pray
[36:10] amen you may be seated
[36:18] praise the lord so my title this morning
[36:22] is the unconventional
[36:26] can you put that up there because i
[36:27] don't it's a mouthful
[36:29] the unconventional uninhibited shameless
[36:32] will of god amen
[36:36] deuteronomy 23 2 says the bastard shall
[36:39] not
[36:39] enter into the congregation of the lord
[36:41] even to his tenth generation shall he
[36:43] not enter into the congregation of the
[36:45] lord
[36:46] so we just read here about mary and
[36:49] she becomes with child of the holy ghost
[36:53] and uh mary was pregnant as a virgin
[36:59] to the world it was an illegitimate
[37:02] child
[37:03] that's why i read you this scripture
[37:05] here so there's a scripture in isaiah
[37:07] that says
[37:09] the lord himself shall give you a sign
[37:11] behold a virgin shall conceive
[37:13] there's a scripture that says the
[37:14] bastard child it's not entered into the
[37:16] congregation of the lord
[37:17] even to his tenth generation
[37:21] so the jews and the israelites of that
[37:23] day
[37:25] all they saw was this girl who is
[37:27] pregnant out of wedlock
[37:30] even though there was scripture to back
[37:32] it up
[37:34] and joseph a holy man at this direct
[37:38] descendant of david
[37:40] it wasn't just that you know joseph
[37:43] have one time did his genealogy he said
[37:45] oh i'm a descendant of david no
[37:47] the jews and the israelites knew who
[37:49] they were where they came from
[37:51] all of that was carefully recorded and
[37:54] there was a status behind
[37:58] that this joseph was a well-respected
[38:01] man
[38:02] partly because of his lineage i'm sure
[38:04] and
[38:05] considered a had a having a voice at the
[38:09] gate if you will in a seat at the gate
[38:11] and he was a holy man he knew the
[38:14] scriptures
[38:15] but even him who knew the scripture was
[38:18] minded to put away
[38:20] mary she had given her testimony and
[38:23] angel came down and spoke to me and said
[38:25] i would be
[38:26] conceived with child and this would be
[38:30] that child of the holy ghost the messiah
[38:34] and they had scriptures to back that up
[38:38] but there was also scripture about
[38:40] bastard children
[38:42] and the fact that any child born out of
[38:44] wedlock
[38:45] was not of god
[38:49] and so here's joseph perhaps wrestling
[38:52] with this
[38:54] and it's funny sometimes you know we we
[38:57] face situations and this is just
[38:59] not so much in my notes we face
[39:00] situations
[39:02] and we try to figure it out on our own
[39:04] without going back to the word
[39:07] and then you know as humans you know we
[39:10] fight
[39:11] ourselves and then one day we oh yeah
[39:15] open up the word and there's the answer
[39:18] right there
[39:20] but sometimes you can read it and not
[39:21] even see it
[39:24] and joseph had read it isaiah was a
[39:27] prophet they had the scroll there
[39:30] i'm sure it was heard in the synagogue
[39:33] and yet
[39:35] even he didn't have a grasp of what was
[39:38] going on
[39:39] because let me ask you if a girl came up
[39:41] to you and told you that how much would
[39:43] you believe it
[39:44] you say well there was a scripture no no
[39:47] no
[39:48] here we have joseph right here no
[39:50] different than you
[39:52] so would you accept it that's right
[39:56] people say oh you know if i was back in
[39:57] the time of jesus i would have been a
[39:59] disciple
[40:00] are you one today it's no different
[40:04] you're looking to the past
[40:08] when it for them it was the present
[40:12] we're looking to to to
[40:15] they were they were they were looking to
[40:17] their past
[40:18] and their future but see this is one
[40:21] thing that i've learned in
[40:23] my few years i've been on earth i never
[40:26] say
[40:26] never and i don't ever say
[40:29] i guess you could say forever i don't
[40:32] know what god's going to do i want to
[40:33] keep my thoughts
[40:35] open i don't want to i don't want to say
[40:38] this is my future
[40:40] and create a box that god can't get into
[40:44] that god i want to be here with you all
[40:47] for the rest of my life but i don't know
[40:49] what god hasn't planned
[40:51] so i say i'm here now because it's the
[40:53] will of god
[40:56] who knows otherwise when god comes
[41:00] knocking on your door
[41:01] and says hey moved in the middle of
[41:03] nowhere

[41:11] you're willing and open to that to give
[41:14] it some thought
[41:16] sometimes god's will is that
[41:20] absurd and if we're not careful as human
[41:24] beings we we
[41:25] create this little world around us that
[41:28] god can't
[41:29] penetrate the jews had created this
[41:32] world around them of their
[41:34] traditions of their prophet moses
[41:39] they had this this this whole idea
[41:41] figured out what the future was going to
[41:43] be
[41:43] oh they prayed for the coming messiah
[41:47] but when he came it wasn't
[41:50] how they thought it was going to be so
[41:53] they
[41:53] conjured up a future event
[41:58] this is going to be the coming of the
[41:59] messiah
[42:01] yet it was directly contrary to the word
[42:05] so you can you can look to your future
[42:08] and you can have an
[42:09] idea of what it's going to be but make
[42:12] sure that idea
[42:14] lines up with the word of god
[42:17] you have something you want to do
[42:19] brother manass is going to college we
[42:21] have a sister here who just graduated
[42:24] they have an idea you have an idea of
[42:26] what your future is going to be
[42:29] but don't ever think because of what
[42:31] you've done
[42:32] up to this point determines what your
[42:35] future is going to be
[42:37] you serve god you say god you listen god
[42:40] can call you see
[42:41] okay before i became a software engineer
[42:43] i was a carpenter for
[42:45] uh 10 years or so and i was in the
[42:48] carpenters union and i went to the
[42:49] carpentry the school there
[42:51] prior to that i already had the
[42:53] knowledge but that was the way into the
[42:54] union
[42:55] and i learned a great deal and i can
[42:58] look at that and say
[42:59] that was wasted time because i don't
[43:01] even do that anymore but that's not the
[43:02] truth
[43:04] god can send you to college for four to
[43:07] eight years
[43:10] to four years just to maybe get
[43:13] uh a degree in business
[43:16] and then take you to the middle of
[43:18] timbuktu and have you pastor a church
[43:20] for the rest of your life
[43:23] was those four years a waste of time no
[43:27] because god puts you in that spot to
[43:30] either be a witness
[43:32] or to teach you important life lessons
[43:35] that's what happens when we limit a
[43:37] limitless god
[43:39] we try to we try to put him we he
[43:41] created
[43:42] us yet
[43:46] we think we have control over him
[43:52] how absurd is that if i
[43:55] say i i oh i don't know yeah
[44:00] if i can't come out it's like you know
[44:03] forgive me if i
[44:03] get too secular but these are stories of
[44:06] robots taking over the world
[44:10] you create they created the robots and
[44:12] the robots decided to take control of
[44:14] them
[44:15] we know that's not going to happen it's
[44:18] but that's what you try to do with
[44:21] and you can't do it you can't do it all
[44:24] you're going to do is make your life
[44:26] miserable but we're humans and so
[44:30] we do it that's why this morning the
[44:33] lord is reminding us
[44:35] that sometimes his will is
[44:38] unconventional
[44:40] but although it's unconventional the
[44:42] will of god is uninhibited
[44:45] and it's shameless you say
[44:48] shameless mary was pregnant and she
[44:50] wasn't married
[44:53] shameless is the will of god through the
[44:56] eyes of the word
[44:58] not the eyes of man man said
[45:02] joseph and mary what a shame
[45:07] so he knew the scripture and he didn't
[45:09] have a revelation of it
[45:10] a messenger had to come to him in the
[45:13] night
[45:14] and speak to him and god had to give him
[45:17] a revelation
[45:20] there is the devil has a perversion for
[45:23] everything
[45:24] god has set in place there is false
[45:27] revelation
[45:28] you know the best way to tell if
[45:30] revelation is false
[45:36] but why is it that there is so much
[45:43] lack of revelation a false revelation
[45:46] you can show them the scripture and they
[45:48] won't understand it
[45:50] does that does that stop you from
[45:53] witnessing no
[45:54] no no no it should say thank you lord
[45:56] for your grace
[45:57] that i can see your willet in the word
[46:01] so this was a scandal
[46:06] okay this is a small church talk
[46:09] travels fast
[46:13] even in a big church it does
[46:16] you're talking about a village of what
[46:19] 400
[46:21] 2 000 people i don't know bethlehem
[46:26] joseph was a respected man everybody
[46:29] knew joseph
[46:30] yeah i'm not i i'm taking some liberty
[46:33] when i say that but
[46:35] let's let's just look at take a dose of
[46:37] reality this is a small
[46:38] town and he was a respected man
[46:42] no doubt many of the old women were
[46:44] trying to get him married off
[46:47] because here he is he was a lot older
[46:48] than mary you know past the normal
[46:51] married
[46:52] marriage age
[46:55] how any girl that gets joseph
[46:59] you know she's going to be well taken
[47:00] care of
[47:03] and so joseph and this is the funny
[47:05] thing about people
[47:06] about humanity joseph begins to talk to
[47:09] mary and everyone's like oh
[47:13] there he goes isn't it sweet you know
[47:16] that mary is such a good girl
[47:19] just love her and joseph man he he
[47:21] couldn't do no better
[47:24] then mary goes off to
[47:27] collect some herbs in the
[47:30] forest and she comes back and she saw an
[47:33] angel
[47:35] and she's pregnant
[47:39] and then the talk they become the talk
[47:42] attack of the town over dinner
[47:44] and in the the corners of the
[47:48] coffee shop
[47:53] we always knew mary was trouble
[47:58] isn't that humanity works it's not
[48:00] joseph's fault
[48:01] so you know jose i told joseph don't get
[48:04] mixed up with that pretty
[48:06] little lady she's got that wild stare in
[48:09] her eye
[48:12] but we knew mary was trouble
[48:16] you just said she was the best girl for
[48:18] joseph two weeks ago
[48:22] or a couple of months i don't know how
[48:23] long it took for it to get around
[48:26] a girl pregnant outside of marriage
[48:30] brought forth the true vindicated word
[48:37] now joseph's stuck with a problem
[48:41] he loves mary he loved her
[48:45] he believed she was better than this
[48:49] so he says you know what i can't stone
[48:52] her
[48:53] i'll just secretly put her over then god
[48:56] comes to him in a dream
[48:58] and we know the rest of the story
[49:02] but imagine yourself as joseph
[49:06] you know people are coming up joseph it
[49:10] says in the word
[49:11] you need to stone her come on man do
[49:14] what you're supposed to do
[49:19] pressure
[49:22] you think you have pressure
[49:26] no not to invalidate your pressure we
[49:28] you go through but you understand the
[49:30] situation he's in
[49:33] you say well it's easy the scripture
[49:35] says it
[49:36] joseph was no different than you what is
[49:39] it today you're facing
[49:42] what what is your mary
[49:45] is your mary in the your your life right
[49:48] now
[49:49] that god is trying to say this and this
[49:51] and this
[49:52] but all you can see is your preconceived
[49:55] ideas
[49:57] this is man's ideas versus gods
[50:04] man would have a much better plan right
[50:08] if it was up to man jesus would have
[50:11] been coming from
[50:12] a staunch jewish home
[50:15] baked into the temple politics you know
[50:18] they would know who's who and what's
[50:19] what
[50:21] schooled under the high priest starting
[50:24] a ministry with the blessing of the high
[50:26] priest and then
[50:28] one day there's just moving in the
[50:30] temple and everyone says this is the
[50:32] messiah
[50:34] perhaps that was how they thought it was
[50:38] but that was man's idea
[50:41] because man see the man likes it all
[50:43] pretty and clean
[50:46] but god likes to cause major disruptions
[50:52] why to get us to realize that
[51:00] well nothing is impossible for god
[51:03] to get us to to to look past what
[51:07] somebody might look like
[51:08] now and see that see a god within them
[51:13] that just needs a little bit of
[51:14] nurturing if everything was pretty and
[51:18] clean
[51:19] where would that leave everyone in the
[51:20] highways in the byways
[51:25] where would that leave a lot of us
[51:29] that's a funny thing right god save
[51:31] someone brings them out of the muck
[51:34] they get in a church they get the wrong
[51:36] spirit and now they're looking down
[51:38] their nose at everyone else
[51:41] forgetting they were at one time no
[51:43] difference
[51:46] god help us to never forget god's grace
[51:50] in our life
[51:51] because guess what will happen
[51:54] god will put you flat on your nose
[52:00] praise the lord so but instead of this
[52:03] this great
[52:04] this great uh
[52:08] young man being raised in the temple all
[52:10] this stuff that they had the ideas of
[52:12] coming down on a white cloud whatever
[52:13] they had the idea instead of their idea
[52:16] you end up with a girl from the village
[52:19] who's pregnant out of wedlock
[52:25] and this this is their words
[52:28] this bastard child is supposed to be the
[52:31] word
[52:32] but the bible says in abraham's grace
[52:34] covenant he says when god represented
[52:36] himself
[52:37] he represented himself from a heaven a
[52:40] bird the meekest of all the birds the
[52:41] dove
[52:42] and god in the holy ghost is itself
[52:44] same-self person
[52:46] if it didn't jesus had two fathers in
[52:47] matthew 1 18 said that which is
[52:49] conceived in thee is of the holy ghost
[52:51] he wasn't a bastard child he was wholly
[52:56] born of god so he was the son of god
[52:58] that's right so the natural eye says
[53:01] he was an illegitimate child but he
[53:04] wasn't
[53:08] and there was scripture to back it up
[53:11] he said well there was scripture to back
[53:13] it up otherwise
[53:16] see sometimes people can can look at the
[53:18] word of god and if they don't look at
[53:19] the word of god
[53:20] through the eyes of faith it can seem to
[53:24] contradict itself
[53:30] yet god said a virgin shall conceive
[53:35] for us we look back and say well it's
[53:36] that's obvious
[53:38] it's laid out in the word
[53:42] but what was the problem
[53:45] these the jews the christians they
[53:48] weren't christians they were jews
[53:49] i'm going to blend these two examples
[53:52] together
[53:53] the other christians around it had
[53:55] closed off
[53:57] their minds their hearts
[54:00] to any teaching they had their
[54:03] hand selected scriptures and quotes
[54:07] that supported their thesis
[54:11] and they didn't bother to say emma
[54:15] they they were they were full of pride
[54:18] that's what it was they were full of
[54:19] pride and it goes directly in
[54:22] in the natural types directly you meet
[54:24] somebody you can't tell them nothing
[54:28] they know it all you can't tell you
[54:31] can't teach them anything
[54:32] how far do those people like that people
[54:34] like that go
[54:35] only as far as what they know
[54:38] which a lot of times isn't very far
[54:42] so the same thing in the spiritual if we
[54:44] close off if we
[54:46] you know this goes right back to to
[54:47] camping down on something
[54:49] right well what is we're not called to
[54:51] camp down we're called to move
[54:54] the people of god were were nomads they
[54:56] raised their sheep they moved and that
[54:58] directly ties into us as a spiritual
[55:00] we're called to keep moving forward why
[55:03] do you think
[55:04] footsteps is possession what is that
[55:06] what do what how do you get footsteps
[55:08] you walk you move you can't get
[55:11] footsteps if you're standing in one spot
[55:15] and so god is calling us to move but
[55:17] what happens is
[55:18] is something comes along and we hear
[55:20] something and we stop
[55:22] and we camp down and we think it's
[55:24] because
[55:25] it's because humans are finite
[55:28] forgive me if i can mix the words up but
[55:30] god is infinite
[55:33] so with with our in the way we're our
[55:36] nature the flesh man
[55:38] is is limited there's beginning and
[55:40] there's ending and there's
[55:41] arriving so we think if we're not
[55:44] careful sometimes around the message
[55:46] that
[55:46] one day we're going to arrive
[55:50] we'll never need to go to the altar
[55:51] again we'll never need to apologize for
[55:53] anything because
[55:53] we have arrived
[55:57] you are never going to arrive until you
[55:59] walking the streets of gold
[56:02] and then guess what for eternity
[56:05] eternity you're going to be learning
[56:07] about god
[56:09] it never ever stops it can't stop
[56:12] because god is eternal but we're
[56:15] non-eternal we're
[56:17] finite so we don't we we try to say you
[56:21] know it's it's how
[56:22] i don't know maybe i'm funny like this
[56:24] but if i'll sit down i don't know if
[56:26] you've done this before and i'll try to
[56:27] think about what it is to be
[56:29] eat forever and ever and ever and ever
[56:31] and ever eternally
[56:33] it's kind of a little bit unnerving
[56:36] if i'm being perfectly honest but that's
[56:38] because my flesh
[56:40] knows nothing that is eternal everything
[56:43] in our life
[56:44] has a beginning and an end this bottle
[56:47] had to be had a beginning
[56:49] and it was full of water by town i'm
[56:50] preaching there will be no more water
[56:52] the water
[56:53] ended right
[56:56] this sermon will end this day will end
[56:58] the service will end
[57:00] our lives will end amen our flesh will
[57:04] end
[57:04] our spirits will not and so
[57:08] what happens is we need we need to have
[57:11] something this the flesh
[57:15] needs something to uh an arrival point
[57:17] an ending point
[57:19] and if we're not careful and that
[57:21] happens because i know
[57:23] there's times in our lives where we're
[57:25] we're where we struggle with this then
[57:27] there's times where we don't but the
[57:28] true word of god is going to unfold it
[57:30] so
[57:31] i'm addressing if you will those people
[57:34] not you but like you
[57:38] sorry i had to steal that it's just
[57:40] really good um
[57:42] i'm talking about years
[57:47] refusing to grow
[57:51] because it's right here they've got it
[57:55] they're there preachers can come
[57:59] and preach the word of god can be played
[58:02] and
[58:02] heard but there is no growth
[58:06] well a lot of times it's because there's
[58:08] sin
[58:10] unconfessed undealt with
[58:13] sin so here here
[58:16] here it is that these this this scandal
[58:20] has happened
[58:24] sometimes i jam jump back a little bit
[58:27] just to get back where i was so
[58:28] that tangent that one was free
[58:32] um so yet the
[58:35] will of god is unconventional
[58:38] i venture to say pretty much every time
[58:40] it's unconventional
[58:42] it's never exactly how we thought it was
[58:44] going to be
[58:46] but what is it it's uninhibited
[58:50] joseph and mary took him to the temple
[58:53] to be circumcised
[58:55] a bastard child in the temple
[59:00] right i don't know if there was anybody
[59:03] there that day who knew them
[59:05] but i'm sure it word got around that
[59:06] they took him there
[59:08] how dare they they're contradicting the
[59:11] word
[59:13] yet they were fulfilling the word to a t
[59:17] do you see it do you see it they weren't
[59:20] looking
[59:21] at it through the eyes of faith and
[59:23] revelation they were looking it
[59:25] through the eyes of their traditions
[59:32] you get camped down on tradition god is
[59:34] going to come along
[59:35] and disrupt your life
[59:41] i can say that because it happened to me
[59:46] i had my future figured out
[59:50] and then god did a mic drop on my life
[59:56] and i was left with a choice accept it
[1:00:00] because it lined up with the word i sat
[1:00:02] down i listed it
[1:00:04] out pros and cons pros list was like
[1:00:07] this long
[1:00:08] and cons this was about that long that
[1:00:12] tells me something
[1:00:13] does it go against the word of god no
[1:00:16] then why
[1:00:18] are so many people so vehemently against
[1:00:21] it
[1:00:23] see what what is this what is it
[1:00:26] what does it mean to be uninhibited
[1:00:30] expressing one's feelings or thoughts on
[1:00:33] self-consciously and without restraint
[1:00:36] in other words acting upon the will of
[1:00:39] god without
[1:00:40] restraint regardless of everyone else's
[1:00:43] opinion
[1:00:45] you cannot stand upon a man's opinion
[1:00:49] of the word you have to stand
[1:00:52] upon god's revelation of the word
[1:00:57] otherwise you can find your life to a
[1:00:59] box
[1:01:01] a man-made box
[1:01:07] notice god created the universe and it's
[1:01:10] a
[1:01:11] it's a continuum
[1:01:14] a continuum man-made boxes
[1:01:19] our houses are square our roads are
[1:01:22] square
[1:01:26] right yet the world is round
[1:01:29] because there is no ending that's right
[1:01:32] there's no ending
[1:01:34] there's no there's no
[1:01:38] yeah praise the lord
[1:01:41] everything that god does can continue
[1:01:45] amen but man can't do that
[1:01:49] they try i remember recently reading an
[1:01:52] article they buried this
[1:01:53] clock in california somewhere so that in
[1:01:56] you know the apocalypse and everything
[1:01:59] else whoever
[1:02:00] that's alive then can dig up this clock
[1:02:02] and know exactly what time it is
[1:02:07] that's the gist of it i don't know maybe
[1:02:09] something here's red and that's not
[1:02:10] exactly what it was about but
[1:02:13] why
[1:02:19] joseph and mary found their position on
[1:02:21] the word by divine revelation and stood
[1:02:23] upon it
[1:02:28] nobody can talk you out of a revelation
[1:02:31] from god
[1:02:35] you cannot restrain the moving of god
[1:02:38] if you fight against the moving of god
[1:02:41] god is gracious and if you're a child of
[1:02:43] god
[1:02:43] he will come back around to you but if
[1:02:45] you fight against the moving of god
[1:02:48] you will be left behind
[1:02:49] [Music]
[1:02:52] that's straight but that's the truth but
[1:02:55] god is gracious and sometimes
[1:02:57] without realizing it our lives are
[1:02:58] within the permissive will of god but
[1:03:00] god will come back around
[1:03:02] and say okay last time we did this this
[1:03:05] is what happened
[1:03:07] let's try that again because god is a
[1:03:10] god of grace
[1:03:12] and understanding and as long as you're
[1:03:13] a child of god you will come to that
[1:03:16] understanding that
[1:03:19] what they stood upon joseph and mary
[1:03:21] with their child it was
[1:03:23] lined up 100 with the word
[1:03:29] because though the natural eye said he
[1:03:30] was a bastard child he wasn't
[1:03:33] right
[1:03:36] so they weren't bringing a bastard child
[1:03:38] into the temple
[1:03:41] you have to find your place in the word
[1:03:44] and stand upon it
[1:03:45] brother chris you just told us we can't
[1:03:47] stand we have to move
[1:03:49] when you stand upon relation in the word
[1:03:54] it is through that standing to say that
[1:03:56] word we use is is a
[1:03:58] is a type right it's the path you're
[1:04:02] walking on
[1:04:03] your feet are firmly planted on the word
[1:04:06] and you're moving forward with god
[1:04:11] praise the lord the will of god
[1:04:17] is uninhibited you can't stop it
[1:04:21] you can't stop the moving of god the
[1:04:24] will of god is shameless
[1:04:30] no fault to be found in the will of god
[1:04:33] from the word
[1:04:34] oh there's plenty of faults to be found
[1:04:38] if you're looking through the eye of man
[1:04:43] looking at the life of brother branham
[1:04:46] there's faults to be found
[1:04:48] where was the crack up with all of that
[1:04:52] i believe the science stuff
[1:04:55] looking through the eyes of man looking
[1:04:58] at
[1:04:58] man that's all it was
[1:05:04] because if you don't find a place to
[1:05:05] stand upon a revelation of the word
[1:05:09] it doesn't matter someone will come
[1:05:11] along
[1:05:12] and convince you otherwise
[1:05:16] but that's not our topic this morning
[1:05:17] our topic is the unconventional
[1:05:19] uninhibited shameless will of god
[1:05:23] i want my desire this morning for myself
[1:05:26] as well as lord
[1:05:28] what in what are you trying to if you're
[1:05:30] trying to tell me something right now
[1:05:32] and i'm missing it what is it
[1:05:34] don't let me build a box around my
[1:05:38] religion
[1:05:40] don't let me build a box around my life
[1:05:42] totally build a box around my future
[1:05:45] that's right what i do on the daily
[1:05:48] basis
[1:05:49] lord a.m am i open enough
[1:05:56] to hear that rustling in mulberry trees
[1:06:03] i say i'm praying for the will of god
[1:06:05] and i'm looking for the will of god but
[1:06:06] am i looking in only the places i want
[1:06:09] to look
[1:06:10] or am i saying lord even direct my
[1:06:13] eyes even direct my heart to the right
[1:06:16] place to look
[1:06:18] that's right even show me
[1:06:22] am i am i missing something is there
[1:06:25] is there something you're you're saying
[1:06:27] or where
[1:06:29] you're standing here and i'm saying give
[1:06:30] me your will give me your will but i'm
[1:06:32] only turning my head this much
[1:06:35] help me to see full circle lord help me
[1:06:37] to look around you
[1:06:39] you know you go you ever go you go
[1:06:41] hunting sometimes if you don't keep
[1:06:44] looking all around you we were hunting
[1:06:45] one time
[1:06:47] and um up right on the border of the
[1:06:48] denali national park and we were sitting
[1:06:50] on this hill and
[1:06:52] we had been glassing for hours but only
[1:06:55] into this one draw
[1:06:57] so i was tired of sitting i got up and i
[1:06:59] walked to the other side of the mountain
[1:07:01] and there was a moose
[1:07:05] if we didn't get up and look on both
[1:07:07] sides we would have missed that moose
[1:07:10] but sees as you get up and you go and
[1:07:12] you look right sometimes you can get so
[1:07:14] focused on one area of your life god's
[1:07:17] over here going
[1:07:18] hey hello look over here
[1:07:23] and you're going i don't see you lord
[1:07:27] i don't hear you lord that's right are
[1:07:30] we plugging our ears
[1:07:33] praise the lord
[1:07:37] don't resent that the truth amen
[1:07:45] if you're resenting it there might be
[1:07:46] something deeper within you
[1:07:48] fighting against that
[1:07:52] no fault to be found with the will of
[1:07:53] god the natural eyes
[1:07:56] saw shame in joseph and mary's union
[1:08:01] yet based on the word it was shameless
[1:08:06] for however long they were in bethlehem
[1:08:10] for the rest of their lives joseph and
[1:08:11] mary were marked
[1:08:13] amen joseph gave up his seat
[1:08:16] the gate his respect
[1:08:21] what respect is there if a man can't
[1:08:23] stand
[1:08:24] upon these convictions of his revelation
[1:08:26] in the word of god i don't care what
[1:08:28] man calls respect oh
[1:08:31] we respect him why because his bank
[1:08:33] account has
[1:08:34] six figures why because because he's
[1:08:38] you know has a porsche or a mercedes or
[1:08:43] or why because because he's you know
[1:08:46] this pastor's son
[1:08:50] or or he's gone on the mission fields
[1:08:54] i don't care what he's done if he's
[1:08:55] wrong he's wrong
[1:08:58] and we will be wrong
[1:09:01] i'm going to i will be wrong as hard as
[1:09:04] it is to imagine just kidding
[1:09:07] i've been corrected and if i can't
[1:09:09] accept correction
[1:09:10] i have no business standing behind this
[1:09:13] pulpit
[1:09:14] god help me god help us we have
[1:09:17] no right if we can't be willing to say
[1:09:22] i was wrong or i am wrong
[1:09:26] help me lord to understand better
[1:09:28] because as soon as you lose the ability
[1:09:30] to admit you are wrong
[1:09:32] you lose the ability to learn anymore
[1:09:35] because to learn more is to say
[1:09:39] what you knew wasn't sufficient enough
[1:09:42] was
[1:09:42] was wrong or you were wrong you have to
[1:09:45] be willing to admit you were wrong in
[1:09:47] order for there to be growth
[1:09:49] there's a concept in the in the world
[1:09:50] the secular world
[1:09:52] about mindset having the right mindset
[1:09:56] people can have the mindset of you know
[1:10:03] my family was plumbers for four
[1:10:06] generations so i have to be a plumber
[1:10:09] or they have a mindset of i can't do
[1:10:11] that because i'm not
[1:10:12] smart enough without ever giving it a
[1:10:15] try
[1:10:16] that's a secular world so in the
[1:10:18] spiritual world
[1:10:20] do you have the mindset that you're a
[1:10:22] child of god
[1:10:23] that literally anything is possible with
[1:10:26] god
[1:10:27] that there is nothing impossible for you
[1:10:31] through god do you have the right the
[1:10:34] right
[1:10:34] are you thinking about yourself the
[1:10:36] right way are you accepting
[1:10:38] god's word for who you are or are you
[1:10:41] accepting the devil's version of who he
[1:10:43] wants you to be
[1:10:46] see you can't deny that see gene of god
[1:10:48] within you
[1:10:49] so start living your life like you are a
[1:10:52] child of the king because you are
[1:10:54] praise god
[1:10:59] so don't amen
[1:11:02] the word of god the will of god is
[1:11:04] shameless
[1:11:05] people might disagree with it but if you
[1:11:07] if you find god gives you that
[1:11:08] revelation of what it is
[1:11:11] it's the big topic right now and i
[1:11:14] i don't even like to bring it up um
[1:11:18] preachers versus no preachers
[1:11:22] you can't find it in the word of god
[1:11:28] and if you can't find it in the word of
[1:11:30] god how can it be the will of god
[1:11:33] if there's a movement it doesn't matter
[1:11:35] if there's hundreds of thousands of
[1:11:36] people
[1:11:37] in the agreement with it and it has the
[1:11:40] label of the message on it
[1:11:42] and it's contrary to the word it's still
[1:11:43] wrong
[1:11:45] but if we limit god to a box that's what
[1:11:48] happens because
[1:11:49] what is that box it's man's ideas
[1:11:52] praise the praise the lord so in your
[1:11:55] life in
[1:11:55] in in what you do
[1:11:58] in your spiritual walk have you shut off
[1:12:01] the fountain
[1:12:07] see it's ended
[1:12:11] have you shut off the fountain or is god
[1:12:14] still able to move in your heart
[1:12:17] if you say oh i've arrived i figured it
[1:12:20] out
[1:12:25] there's a stigmatism where if you come
[1:12:28] to the altar for prayer
[1:12:30] you're not a you're you're
[1:12:33] you're not a grown christian
[1:12:39] that's not true
[1:12:42] who was the first one of the to the to
[1:12:44] the altar
[1:12:45] when brother brown had his meetings a
[1:12:46] lot of times it was him
[1:12:49] are we he was preaching sorry if excuse
[1:12:51] me if he was in the congregation and
[1:12:52] there was not the car
[1:12:54] he said he's one of the first ones there
[1:12:56] do i need to hear that
[1:12:58] so that i can come to the altar no the
[1:13:01] word of god says
[1:13:02] he loves a broken and contrite spirit
[1:13:05] that doesn't mean
[1:13:06] that scripture doesn't mean you have to
[1:13:08] be
[1:13:10] strung out on drugs in sin unconverted
[1:13:14] no
[1:13:15] that means maybe you just spoke harshly
[1:13:18] to someone
[1:13:19] and you're here asking for forgiveness
[1:13:21] because you're soft
[1:13:22] towards the things of god it's uh
[1:13:26] scientifically proven i guess or an
[1:13:28] agreed idea but
[1:13:29] it's actually proven that if people
[1:13:32] don't do
[1:13:32] new things as they get older
[1:13:36] their ideas and things get set in stone
[1:13:39] and they're not willing to learn
[1:13:41] anything else so you have to actually
[1:13:44] you have to actually as a as in the
[1:13:46] world that we live in
[1:13:48] as a person you have to actively
[1:13:49] continue to learn
[1:13:51] or you'll just get set in stone and
[1:13:53] nobody can teach you anything it's like
[1:13:54] that old saying you can't teach an old
[1:13:55] dog new tricks
[1:13:56] you can if that old dog keeps is willing
[1:13:59] to keep learning throughout his life
[1:14:02] so take that as a tidbit for the world
[1:14:03] we live in keep learning
[1:14:06] doesn't matter what it is just keep
[1:14:07] learning
[1:14:09] and the same with the spirit of god keep
[1:14:10] learning keep asking yourself lord is
[1:14:12] there something more i need to learn
[1:14:14] because guess what the answer is yes
[1:14:17] there's always more to learn and it is
[1:14:20] what i'm doing
[1:14:22] now still your will that's it
[1:14:25] god can call you to go to like going
[1:14:29] back
[1:14:29] to go to college to get a degree as a
[1:14:31] doctor
[1:14:34] and you think because he did that he
[1:14:36] wants you to be a doctor
[1:14:38] but that's not necessarily true so you
[1:14:41] get out of call and you go yep
[1:14:43] god paved the way he called me to go to
[1:14:44] school to be a doctor so i'm going to be
[1:14:46] a doctor
[1:14:47] and you push and you push and you push
[1:14:49] and you become a doctor
[1:14:51] and you're no longer in the will of god
[1:14:53] this is just an example
[1:14:57] so god starts you off on a path but keep
[1:15:00] asking yourself as you're walking lord
[1:15:01] am i still in your will
[1:15:03] am i still in your will is this still
[1:15:05] what you want me to do am i still doing
[1:15:07] what you've called me to do
[1:15:08] and sometimes he calls us to go do
[1:15:10] things for a short amount of time
[1:15:11] and then we go back to what it was we
[1:15:13] were doing before we think oh we wasted
[1:15:15] all that time but god says no no i was
[1:15:17] teaching you an important lesson
[1:15:19] maybe simply to show you the wonders of
[1:15:23] life
[1:15:27] praise the lord how good it is to hug
[1:15:30] your kids
[1:15:31] every evening don't become so set in
[1:15:35] stone
[1:15:35] god can't teach you anything there's
[1:15:37] only one one rock we want to become like
[1:15:40] and that's jesus christ
[1:15:46] you know what happens if you get
[1:15:47] concrete pour on your feet and it dries
[1:15:50] you don't go anywhere
[1:15:54] ask god to broaden your horizons
[1:15:58] that's a that's a favorite cliche in the
[1:16:00] secular world gotta broaden your
[1:16:02] horizons
[1:16:03] you know people i heard i said one time
[1:16:06] about christians and i'm
[1:16:08] sure it included us because we're in a
[1:16:10] cult but
[1:16:11] um you know don't don't let your don't
[1:16:13] don't follow
[1:16:14] religion in a bathtub or something like
[1:16:16] that in other words it's constrained to
[1:16:17] this one thing you're gonna
[1:16:18] you've gotta broaden your horizons what
[1:16:21] they're saying is you gotta accept
[1:16:23] everything false or true
[1:16:26] but that's not what i'm saying this
[1:16:27] morning when i say broaden your horizons
[1:16:29] i mean say for example
[1:16:33] i read through the song with solomon
[1:16:36] then that's like a book no one talks
[1:16:39] about
[1:16:40] but if it's in here
[1:16:44] there's a point so i said lord i don't
[1:16:46] understand what i'm reading
[1:16:49] but there's it's in the bible so it's
[1:16:51] important
[1:16:52] it's got something to say you notice
[1:16:54] it's like oh lamentation or lamentations
[1:16:58] leviticus those the books of the law you
[1:17:01] know most times your devotions you're
[1:17:03] over here in the new testament
[1:17:04] and there's nothing wrong with that but
[1:17:07] if leviticus is in the bible it's there
[1:17:09] for a reason
[1:17:11] i don't know what i'm trying to
[1:17:15] in say words don't brought on your
[1:17:17] horizons the the entire
[1:17:19] bible is christ
[1:17:22] the entire bible is christ every last
[1:17:24] word of it is nothing but the truth
[1:17:27] so god can change the way you think
[1:17:32] and he can change the way someone else
[1:17:34] thinks so when i say we're talking about
[1:17:36] so far
[1:17:37] building a box around your personal life
[1:17:39] but don't build a box around someone
[1:17:40] else's life and say they're never gonna
[1:17:42] change
[1:17:44] now they've been that way for 30 years
[1:17:48] laura just just the way it is
[1:17:51] no it's not god can change
[1:18:01] we never know who's who in the kingdom
[1:18:04] of god
[1:18:07] i don't care what they've done i don't
[1:18:08] care what they've said about the message
[1:18:11] i don't none of that matters god
[1:18:14] can change anybody
[1:18:19] don't limit a limitless god but brother
[1:18:21] bible says in 1953
[1:18:23] earnestly contending for the faith that
[1:18:24] was once delivered to the saints
[1:18:28] if you can limit god you can limit
[1:18:30] christ and if you limit the church today
[1:18:33] in its possibilities
[1:18:35] you're limiting god but all things
[1:18:37] whatsoever you desire when you pray
[1:18:40] believe you receive it and you shall
[1:18:42] have it he said that i believe it
[1:18:44] and i know it's the truth the trick
[1:18:48] is you can say you're not limiting god
[1:18:54] but you can if you have the wrong
[1:18:55] mindset about your future
[1:18:58] you can if you have the wrong mindset
[1:19:00] about what you're experiencing in life
[1:19:02] and so you're you're saying
[1:19:03] i'm not limiting god but you're only i
[1:19:05] keep saying this but you're only looking
[1:19:07] at this portion
[1:19:08] instead of the whole big picture this
[1:19:12] comes to mind someone i know
[1:19:14] been looking for a place to live and
[1:19:16] they've been hitting roadblock after
[1:19:17] roadblock after roadblock
[1:19:21] but yet they're praying and they're
[1:19:22] seeking but but but in but
[1:19:24] but they're not looking past a certain
[1:19:27] point
[1:19:27] and i can't go in and tell them this
[1:19:30] because it takes god to reveal it to
[1:19:31] them
[1:19:31] that they're looking and they're and
[1:19:32] they're pushing and they're searching
[1:19:34] and i do i know the will of god
[1:19:36] no i have some ideas that are based on
[1:19:39] the bible but
[1:19:40] god is god he does whatever he wants
[1:19:44] but from the outside looking in i say
[1:19:47] yes you're looking for the will of god
[1:19:48] and you're seeking the will of god for
[1:19:49] your life
[1:19:50] but what about this over here
[1:19:53] you haven't even entertained this
[1:19:57] it's like a job you know someone prays
[1:19:58] and prays and prays and i'm not telling
[1:20:00] you to quit your job but
[1:20:01] for this job to work out and i wish this
[1:20:02] job worked out and i you know
[1:20:04] it is it's hindering my family
[1:20:07] and this job and i just pray lord smooth
[1:20:09] it out smooth it out smooth it out
[1:20:11] never ever asking do i need to quit this
[1:20:13] job and find a different one
[1:20:15] that's what i'm trying to say when i say
[1:20:16] broaden your horizons and i'm not
[1:20:17] telling you to quit your job
[1:20:20] find one first before you do if you need
[1:20:23] to
[1:20:27] change careers
[1:20:31] praise the lord lord is there something
[1:20:34] i'm missing that you're trying to tell
[1:20:36] me but i've confined
[1:20:38] your will to a box
[1:20:41] if you aren't careful you'll build a
[1:20:43] little world around you that
[1:20:45] stops god from moving
[1:20:48] remember every single word in the book
[1:20:50] is truth
[1:20:52] being open to learning more about god
[1:20:55] requires that you be open to the
[1:20:57] possibility that you are
[1:20:58] wrong amen amen
[1:21:04] says from that time 1962
[1:21:07] he says don't want to hurt your feelings
[1:21:09] but how can you women sit here and know
[1:21:11] that the bible tells you that it's wrong
[1:21:12] forever
[1:21:13] you to cut your hair that you dish on
[1:21:16] this
[1:21:17] excuse me dishonor your husband when you
[1:21:19] do it you prove yourself as a woman of
[1:21:21] the street when you do such a thing
[1:21:23] and because of the angel you should have
[1:21:25] long hair what angel the angel of the
[1:21:27] covenant the angel the messenger of the
[1:21:29] day
[1:21:30] the seventh angel which is sounding
[1:21:31] today then still
[1:21:33] know that you're wrong your adam might
[1:21:36] might have let you go ahead and act
[1:21:38] wrong even say it don't make a
[1:21:40] difference
[1:21:40] it certainly does make a difference
[1:21:42] every commandment of god is right eve
[1:21:44] only turned her
[1:21:45] just aside for a minute if you're wrong
[1:21:49] admit you're wrong your own life
[1:21:51] proves you're wrong
[1:21:54] now you say oh we know not to cut our
[1:21:57] hair
[1:21:58] but here's eve with direct word from god
[1:22:01] don't talk to that tree
[1:22:05] but she's over there talking to that
[1:22:06] tree talking to the serpent
[1:22:09] and the serpent says well but did he
[1:22:11] really mean it
[1:22:14] you say oh that's obvious is it now
[1:22:19] can i go back and put you in the garden
[1:22:20] of eden as eve
[1:22:22] and you still tell me the same thing if
[1:22:25] you're a child of god with revelation of
[1:22:26] the word
[1:22:27] absolutely but what about our day-to-day
[1:22:30] life
[1:22:31] what what what are what are we doing
[1:22:34] that that god is saying
[1:22:35] and then maybe there's nothing maybe
[1:22:37] you're within the will of god
[1:22:39] praise the lord
[1:22:42] thank god for his grace maybe you're
[1:22:44] already open to the possibilities
[1:22:46] whatever in the world god wants you to
[1:22:48] do
[1:22:48] praise god keep on doing it amen
[1:22:51] if not
[1:22:55] remember that
[1:23:00] there is nothing on this earth
[1:23:03] god can't call you to do that's it yeah
[1:23:08] you know the big one is you know like
[1:23:10] like
[1:23:11] it's always easy it's hard but it's
[1:23:13] always easy for people to say oh yeah
[1:23:15] i'm called to be a missionary to
[1:23:17] africa or missionary to the philippines
[1:23:19] or a missionary to
[1:23:21] you know some third world country
[1:23:24] because that's the accepted norm for a
[1:23:27] missionary
[1:23:29] what if god is calling you to brooklyn
[1:23:31] new york
[1:23:32] are you open to that a possibility
[1:23:35] brother
[1:23:36] evonicarian we just pray for his is he
[1:23:39] sick or his wife
[1:23:41] he has a church in the bronx i've been
[1:23:43] there actually by the
[1:23:45] lord's given the opportunity they most
[1:23:48] of them live in
[1:23:49] new jersey and where they live is pretty
[1:23:52] nice it's
[1:23:53] it's all big city there but it's i liked
[1:23:55] it it's nice there's plenty of trees and
[1:23:57] kind of has a small town feel yet they
[1:24:00] all drive into new york into the bronx
[1:24:02] to go to church
[1:24:04] because he feels led they have money
[1:24:07] but he feels led to keep his church
[1:24:09] right there in the bronx
[1:24:10] and they have some their congregation is
[1:24:13] lives in the bronx
[1:24:14] too but their churches and classic new
[1:24:17] york
[1:24:17] sandwiched between buildings the next
[1:24:19] building is this far away
[1:24:21] it's a storefront you walk in the door
[1:24:24] and you
[1:24:25] bump into the first pew the cars in the
[1:24:27] street are double parked and all the
[1:24:29] keys are hung on the back hook
[1:24:31] so the someone because they're below a
[1:24:33] big apartment complex
[1:24:35] somebody will come knocking on the door
[1:24:36] deacons will go okay which car
[1:24:38] okay and they'll go on move the car so
[1:24:40] they can get their car out
[1:24:46] it's not an ideal situation it's absurd
[1:24:49] it's not pretty it's not nice the church
[1:24:52] is nice i don't want them to hear this
[1:24:54] and be like hey
[1:24:56] it's a nice church great people
[1:25:00] you're this but why everyone you want to
[1:25:02] have a nice church you know
[1:25:04] in this location with the nice building
[1:25:06] and everything
[1:25:07] because that's not what god wants him to
[1:25:09] do that's not what god's called him to
[1:25:12] do
[1:25:12] god has called people to have churches
[1:25:15] in nice locations
[1:25:16] in nice buildings yes absolutely don't
[1:25:19] get astigmatism in your head that
[1:25:20] anything nice is not of god
[1:25:23] that's not true whatsoever god can bless
[1:25:26] his people and
[1:25:27] can live well and be well for your
[1:25:30] entire life and there's nothing contrary
[1:25:32] to the will of god with that
[1:25:34] show me up show me show me in the
[1:25:36] scripture where it's wrong
[1:25:37] david had all them wives all that money
[1:25:41] he's still in the little god solomon
[1:25:43] same thing
[1:25:45] but that's where god called brother
[1:25:47] yvonne karen that's his that's his
[1:25:48] mission on earth is the bronx
[1:25:51] not somewhere overseas
[1:25:55] so is god calling you to you know but
[1:25:57] see
[1:25:58] i don't know how to explain this but
[1:26:00] it's like
[1:26:01] it's okay to go to the third world
[1:26:04] country
[1:26:05] and get your hands dirty but it's not
[1:26:07] okay in america to get your hands dirty
[1:26:10] i don't understand that you look past
[1:26:12] that
[1:26:14] loser i don't want to say a loser cause
[1:26:15] that's that's not right
[1:26:17] forgive me you look past that person
[1:26:19] who's just a mess
[1:26:20] i don't know why doesn't that guy get a
[1:26:22] life
[1:26:26] you have the perfect life for him why
[1:26:28] don't you tell him about it
[1:26:29] i've been praying about this lord help
[1:26:31] me not to not to go
[1:26:33] i don't want to touch that have not to
[1:26:36] help me not to have that attitude
[1:26:37] it doesn't matter who they are what they
[1:26:39] are how they smell shake their hand
[1:26:42] amen tell them god bless you god loves
[1:26:45] you talk to them i don't care how
[1:26:47] weird they are or the conversation could
[1:26:49] be extremely awkward
[1:26:51] there's a song actually and and it's so
[1:26:55] called one awkward moment
[1:26:58] could that one awkward moment spare that
[1:27:01] person from
[1:27:04] hellfire i guess could that one awkward
[1:27:07] moment be the words to
[1:27:09] prevent someone from committing suicide
[1:27:12] could that one awkward moment be that
[1:27:15] one chance where they accept the truth
[1:27:19] is it too much to ask for one awkward
[1:27:21] moment
[1:27:23] no guess what
[1:27:27] it's awkward sometimes and you know what
[1:27:31] 99.99 of the time it might not go
[1:27:34] anywhere
[1:27:35] but there's always that point zero one
[1:27:37] percent
[1:27:39] there's always that one percent and then
[1:27:41] 99 of the time maybe it'll be weird
[1:27:43] so you maybe you've had maybe you've
[1:27:45] witnessed this to people
[1:27:48] time and time again and you go why do i
[1:27:50] even do this anymore
[1:27:52] how do you know you didn't witness to
[1:27:54] somebody some random person on the
[1:27:56] street or in the
[1:27:57] grocery store then two weeks later they
[1:28:00] move
[1:28:02] to lima ohio
[1:28:06] and they meet someone else in the
[1:28:07] grocery store who tells them and they go
[1:28:10] hey
[1:28:11] i just had a conversation like that with
[1:28:12] somebody a month ago can i come to your
[1:28:15] church
[1:28:16] guess what you would never ever ever
[1:28:18] hear about it
[1:28:20] does that mean god didn't do anything no
[1:28:22] no see we as humans we want we want
[1:28:24] we want that reward we want that we want
[1:28:28] that
[1:28:28] satisfaction of seeing a job ended job
[1:28:31] done
[1:28:32] guess what this is something that i've
[1:28:34] been praying
[1:28:36] lord that i that i i my attitude
[1:28:39] when it comes to to ministering when it
[1:28:41] comes to being a youth leader
[1:28:43] when it comes to to to just trying to
[1:28:46] direct
[1:28:46] trying to show the love of christ lord
[1:28:50] and i'm human i'm not saying i'm perfect
[1:28:53] but lord i don't care if i ever hear
[1:28:56] about it
[1:28:58] i just want to be content with doing it
[1:29:02] i don't want to find my contentness in
[1:29:04] knowing that it worked i don't want to
[1:29:06] confine my contentness in knowing i was
[1:29:08] a good um
[1:29:11] youth leader or a good preacher or
[1:29:13] anything i just want to find
[1:29:15] contentment content you know what i'm
[1:29:18] trying to say
[1:29:18] in just doing it every day
[1:29:23] every wednesday every sunday just lord i
[1:29:26] find my peace in the fact that i'm
[1:29:29] doing it lord i don't
[1:29:33] see it's don't get me wrong it's good to
[1:29:35] hear it
[1:29:36] it's encouraging to hear it but i don't
[1:29:38] want to stop doing it because people
[1:29:40] stop
[1:29:41] telling me how it's doing that's right i
[1:29:43] want to do it because god called it
[1:29:46] and that is the paradox saying to god
[1:29:49] you serve god just because
[1:29:53] you serve god not because you're looking
[1:29:55] for a reward that's
[1:29:57] love that's the love of christ
[1:30:00] you serve him because you love him not
[1:30:04] because you're looking to have a nice
[1:30:05] house because you're looking to get
[1:30:07] blessed because you're looking you don't
[1:30:09] serve your church
[1:30:10] sitting in the pew saying amen because
[1:30:12] you want to become you know recognized
[1:30:15] true help true help
[1:30:19] is when it comes unselfishly
[1:30:24] there is no conditions you just help
[1:30:26] because you see the need
[1:30:28] and you want to help there's a big you
[1:30:30] can see it sometimes you know
[1:30:32] someone's like i really want to help
[1:30:33] really want to help you say okay can you
[1:30:35] vacuum the church
[1:30:36] twice a month they never show up
[1:30:40] they wanted you to say sure can you play
[1:30:42] the piano wednesday and sunday
[1:30:44] or can you work in the sound booth they
[1:30:47] want a prominent position
[1:30:49] they don't really want to help they want
[1:30:51] to be recognized
[1:30:53] as someone i i've been through that i'm
[1:30:55] ashamed to say it but i've done it
[1:30:58] god help me i amen
[1:31:02] are you helping are you serving just
[1:31:03] because you love god and you love the
[1:31:05] people of god
[1:31:06] or are you serving for a reward sister i
[1:31:08] mean you guys come
[1:31:10] this morning praise the lord i hope
[1:31:14] something was said this morning that
[1:31:15] spoke to your heart
[1:31:17] i know the lord spoke to my heart
[1:31:20] it's important not to limit god into a
[1:31:22] box
[1:31:24] because that revelation he has for you
[1:31:27] might completely turn your world upside
[1:31:29] down
[1:31:30] and my might mean you've been doing the
[1:31:33] wrong thing for the last 10
[1:31:35] 20 30 years
[1:31:39] do you realize that
[1:31:42] amen i don't know that came across kind
[1:31:44] of flat but
[1:31:46] maybe we just need to raise it a key
[1:31:50] praise the lord let's bow our heads this
[1:31:51] morning heavenly father lord jesus i
[1:31:54] trust that your will be done this
[1:31:56] morning
[1:31:58] lord your will is unconventional but
[1:32:01] it's uninhibited and it's shameless
[1:32:05] help us to remember that in our
[1:32:06] day-to-day life for jesus
[1:32:08] [Music]
[1:32:09] the broader spectrum of what we're going
[1:32:12] through the people we know
[1:32:14] lord help us to remember
[1:32:18] lord that your will is sometimes very
[1:32:20] disruptive of
[1:32:21] our lives and what we have figured out
[1:32:24] lord it's
[1:32:24] time and time again through the
[1:32:26] scripture even thinking of king josiah
[1:32:29] disrupted the entire kingdom when he
[1:32:31] found out things were being done
[1:32:32] according to your word
[1:32:36] lord you went through the temple the
[1:32:39] money changers and whipped them
[1:32:42] up one side and down the other because
[1:32:44] of compassion
[1:32:47] because your will wasn't being done
[1:32:51] lord it was the accepted norm though
[1:32:54] to deal the sell the sacrifices in the
[1:32:57] temple it was the accepted norm
[1:32:59] but it wasn't your will help us to never
[1:33:02] be confined by what
[1:33:04] would be considered our
[1:33:07] or duty will be considered the norm
[1:33:09] never to be confined by that but to ask
[1:33:11] lord is your will
[1:33:13] contrary to what the people say my duty
[1:33:16] is oh god i thank you for your mercy and
[1:33:21] your grace
[1:33:22] lord for what you've brought us through
[1:33:24] the the battles that we've faced
[1:33:26] the times lord jesus when we've had to
[1:33:28] turn our back
[1:33:31] on situations and walk away because it
[1:33:34] was your will
[1:33:37] lord give us the strength to carry on
[1:33:42] give us the strength lord when things
[1:33:44] don't look like they're getting any
[1:33:46] better to just keep on doing what's
[1:33:48] right
[1:33:50] help us lord to serve you with every
[1:33:52] fiber of our being
[1:33:54] lord father to never serve you out of
[1:33:57] out of conditions but to serve you
[1:34:00] unconditionally
[1:34:03] oh lord jesus
[1:34:06] [Music]
[1:34:08] oh thank you saints while you just lift
[1:34:12] your hands

[1:34:35] molded by your
[1:34:36] your will for our lives

[1:34:42] that have built a box
[1:34:44] around their religion lord around their
[1:34:46] life
[1:34:47] and you're just trying to get in as a
[1:34:50] gentleman you're knocking
[1:34:54] or may they drop those barriers
[1:34:58] of unbelief and may you have the liberty
[1:35:02] to come inside and change their hearts
[1:35:05] lord jesus
[1:35:08] lord that each one will be open father
[1:35:11] to whatever it is you have
[1:35:13] them to do maybe they're
[1:35:17] nothing they need to change maybe they

[1:35:28] battles this church

[1:35:52] upon the word

[1:35:56] that even those who hurt us
[1:35:59] may be potential sons of god
[1:36:03] even though who those who offend us they
[1:36:06] have the potential

[1:36:14] grace
