praise the lord amen come away there's a table dressed in linen amen praise the lord [Music] there's a table dressed in [Music] is prepared a host of angels gather for a celebration there the bride is almost ready and sparkle this wide rain a hush falls over heaven as the groom begins to say come away my love come away my love i have waited for this day when i could give to you my name [Music] eternity awaits us come away my love i have loved you from creation long before you came to me i carried that love with me all the way to calvary though it wasn't over when they laid me in the tube i

away my love i have waited for this day and i could give to you my name eternity awaits us i'm away my love come away [Music] my love i've waited [Music] eternity awaits us [Music] to those that are married i believe you can remember the feeling that we had in the natural a day set before us a day that all is set in a ray i don't know how a person could come into the day to marry the one they love and not be just thrilled big measure there's probably been someone you know got married for money got married for prestige whatever they see this bride is not approaching that way it's not about what god can give us you know that too many christians are caught up in what god can give us and they have failed to miss that we have been ordained of god just in the natural to love him in return for his love to us now people say that sounds like work and obligation etc i'd sure hate to be in your marriage amen it is a marriage that is something that stirs our hearts and yes we get caught up in the things of life sometimes and we have to have reminders amen natural and spiritual amen i'd like to speak to you this evening thank you so much god bless you amen so happy to see each and every one of you here uh and uh i want to speak to you this evening on standing on the promise amen and so we have my brother and sister ben given a very beautiful promise god speaking to us and so as we will turn uh stand and turn in our bibles to second peter the first chapter just four verses because i believe these four verses here will convey to us adequately the thought uh tonight as we would move forward uh to to touch upon this thought and i told sister jerry i won't be very long and she's like don't say that amen it's not my fault that the bible opens up like it does amen aren't you glenn i'm glad the bible opens up you know it is the original zip file and when you open it up there's no i want to stop now it just keeps opening and keeps opening and keeps opening amen how beautiful second peter the first chapter verses one through four amen now i don't like to give glory to man or to to do that but did we not enjoy sunday's sermon i i it really spoke to my heart amen i was actually uh physically exhausted and thought it was going to be just a a little cakewalk weekend to relax but the lord saw fit that we would be home and as i was sitting there if you looked at me you might have thought brother paul just looks tuned out but amen i had just forgot to let my face know i was happy and as brother chris is singing that song you know our hands our feet our soul praise god sometimes we need to get our face to do that too amen so ii peter 1 1 simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them oh my look at this saints very narrow focus they have in the world we live in today it would be completely unacceptable for him to write this in this fashion to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue now i don't have this in my notes so i just want to touch on this real quick if we didn't hear the call there's nothing for you to respond to you realize how blessed we are amen let our hands let our feet let our hearts our souls rejoice today because by god's grace and mercy we heard the call whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust heavenly father just ask you lord this evening just help us lord to be concise and just bring this forth lord let it stir the hearts of your saints and father we just love you when they come father to recharge our battery tonight lord just to find encouragement from the laborers of this week lord to recognize lord the hour the day and the spirits of this day lord we ask your blessings on the saints wherever they might be tonight lord in the precious name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now i want to take out of this thought tonight i want to keep it as i i say as concise as possible but we're talking about standing on the promise tonight and you know my brother and sister it's by the very nature of humanity we experience broken promise is that not true i mean we look through life and even if we have the best intentions sometimes we don't fulfill them and sometimes people can take that so personally as though it is a insult or a slight and uh you know the scripture shows us and and we won't go into all these corresponding scriptures but the scripture shows us that let our yea be yay in our navy nay and we're better off to say i will by god's grace right the scripture tells us uh if god's will uh that we would quantify things but people say you know what i this brother he always says well uh lord willing and yet the prophet of god told us that that is something we should apply to ourselves because we don't want to get into a habit of of saying we will do something and then when circumstances come to be identified as the one who never fulfills what they say they will do and oftentimes we'll see this uh uh definitely in marriage uh that uh things are promised you know you're marrying the love of your life and you tell her oh honey you know if you'll marry me i i'll build you a nice house and you'll drive nice cars uh just to cut right to the chase when um uh sister jerry and i were courting you know she liked the mercedes sl 450 convertible and um you know i told her honey i will buy you a mercedes someday and i did it just happens to look like a truck and so it's there my brother and sister that we got to be careful because every once in a while we'll be driving down the road in a promise from many years ago she reminds me you promised to buy me one of those and i don't know i found one it happens to be up on blocks but it looks like it's in reasonably good condition for an abandoned car but you look at that and see i i hope you just catch where i'm going with this that that those promises unfulfilled are still remembered they don't just fade away as we would and you know it reminds me one time i was on a telephone with a brother and uh we were discussing some church or you know message believer business i guess if you would call it that anyway i hear a voice in the background and he says you know paul i'll have to call you tomorrow and i said oh something's come up he says yes my son has my children have come to redeem the promise that dad made them to buy them ice cream tonight and he said i'm sorry our conversation's going on on hold because i will fulfill this promise to my child now i don't want anyone to feel guilty and don't raise any hands but how many of us have told our kids if you clean your room you do this you do that we'll buy you an ice cream or we'll go eat a pizza and then we don't ever do it now if you ask these children they actually can remember you we think oh it just fades away they remember these same saints and so as we look at this by the very nature of humanity we experience broken promises and so it's there if we are not careful we will find ourselves taking experiences of this nature broken promises and we will somehow end up defining or trying to define god in the same fashion so the word of god has many promises to us we all see the scripture we read the scripture i'm not going to just go through the list is extensive talking of the promises of god and you go through there and one of those that i think comes up a lot and i'll just try and touch on that is the promise of our healing and many times i i have as a minister encountered people who feel like god has not come on the scene for them has not delivered on the promise of their healing and so in that they have come to the place that while they still suffer afflictions they no longer are calling on the lord for their healing they're no longer calling upon the lord for these various needs of their life because they've reached a point that they're actually believing god's not going to fulfill that but that's why my brother and sister we have to balance everything in the word of god we have to come and balance the whole picture and the scripture tells us there is a time and a season for everything and so we don't want to miss our time or season because we have given up hope and no longer believe in the promise now it is one thing to say you know what god is my healer but it's another for you and i to actively pursue our healing and you say brother paul how do we pursue our healing by getting up every day the prophet of god said and testifying i'm healed in the name of jesus christ don't ever let a negative word come don't ever come to the place and say well i guess this is what god has for me well if it is what god has for you then rejoice amen because you're in god's will might not be your will might not be your desire but it would be god's will but don't sit here and say well i'm just gonna say then with this condition i have it must be god's will you are conditioned by the word to claim the promise amen not a claim a promise if it looks like it's going to happen right now i sat down with a man today hapless be a landlord of a farm that we farm and he's telling me he says i have two forms of cancer he said here a a a time back he didn't actually define it so i don't know where he's at in this picture at one point the doctor says and this man himself is a very renowned surgeon in this valley and so is there he says the doctors told me you have less than a year to live go get everything in order and then he said as a time their seventh day adventists he said my wife and i family my children we pray we claim what god has given and he said you know time goes on and he said i go in for another checkup after all the treatment and regimen and he says well the doctor says you you look so good you know i'm going to extend this i believe that you could live now between a year and five years and he says i'm beyond the five years but what it caused me to do was stop and look what is truly important in my life he said i could see the end of my life coming and i had to stop and say what is truly important in my life and i won't i won't go into the whole conversation but i thought it was very interesting because you see my brother and sister it was in that as a surgeon he is an orthopedic surgeon well known in the city of nampa and around this country for 40 years or so and has just a stellar reputation has done many good deeds many times of of uh those that were poor unable to pay has just written off his his part of things and just the kind of character that we like to see in humanity but it took something like that he said to cause him to slow down and realize what is important see we don't want to start defining god by the disappointment of our life you seem people are like god's angry at me give me scripture for that god's forgotten me give me scripture for that god has this god has that give me scripture for these things you see those are expressed from the depth of disappointment those are expressed from the depth of things we thought god would do in a particular fashion but god had a different idea now remember that we should rejoice in the fiery trials sometimes the things that we are sure god will come and change happens to be the trial that god wants you to rejoice in amen and maybe the trial won't go away until you come to the place you decide i'm going to rejoice because after all if i give this body to be burned and i give all my wealth and i do all of these things but i have not problem is is we're looking at the wrong have-not come on saints are you with me tonight so it's from those experience we try to define god that's why god's constantly working on you and i because he's changing our definition now that's where one thing my brother and sister that our mind and wikipedia have and that is we're going to change the definition at will i've done that i've looked up things on wikipedia and go back later and look them up again and it's like this definition is not the same one that was here a month or two ago but somebody who's a certified editor has went in there and decided i don't like that definition well i'm here this evening if you by god's grace would have let me i don't like some of your definitions so i want you to go and we've got a master guide the master dictionary as it were and we want to go back and not judge god or define god by what we have experienced that is negative or hold us back but my brother and sister the word says that we have to get into heavenly places now you realize that's the reason sometimes we go through the struggles that we go through it's because the devil comes amen brother trevor sister kerry just keep insisting on sitting on the front row amen i don't know what's wrong with them but look at that see what happens is is we come and things in our life and we have a hearts desire amen to be in heavenly places and so the devil doesn't have to cause you to backslide saints he's just got to get you in an atmosphere that we're not entering into the heavenly places so it can be a little a customer it can be a little circumstance it can be whatever it is comes and what it does is causes us you might say to be bound up a little bit brother chris when he hit that i thought there it is there it is get loosened up get loosened up we are not the heavenly place sitting in our hands our hands in our pockets our mouth clothed with a frown on our face we're not going to get into heavenly places like that we're not going to get into heavenly places when we start reciting to someone else or to ourself all is wrong in life that's why i tell you i i just say this is a side note for just my self expressing people say oh how's it out there on the farm i usually just say it's okay because i'm sure you all want to hear every little thing that's wrong right you do no you don't but you see it's not good for me and it's not good for you for us to come and start defining what our world is by all of our perceived problems when we have a promise of god that is sitting right here in front of us waiting for us to reach out take a hold of that promise and say i don't care about what i see i'm going to stand on this promise i'm claiming and confessing this promise amen so it's there that we see how satan would then work right amen just picking up brother trevor here just one bad customer one of them that just breaks the atmosphere and we got to fight my brother and sister when they got a haircut and they walked out the door the atmosphere doesn't just immediately go back to what it was before we have to fight is that not right brother trevor we have to fight to reset the atmosphere but what if you're the one that's guilty of breaking the atmosphere god help us amen so he's telling us you know what get into heavenly places i'm not i don't want to go off on that it's just such a big topic but you get into heavenly places if my brother and sister it takes every bit of energy you have today push yourself amen as it would be push yourself into heavenly places don't let the atmosphere of laodicea because what will happen the atmosphere of laodicea is like the boa constrictor and it comes and at first it just slithers up and it lays there until it's sure that the prey is not going to move and then if it can get itself wrapping around it might be just an arm or a leg it just slowly comes and starts to choke the life out that's what satan wants to do he wants to take sons and daughters of god that have the greatest promises on the face of the earth and he wants to squeeze the life out of the promise until we become bound until we become ineffective until we become tired and unwilling to fight and then the world swallows him amen you see because the word of god says that we can't even call him the christ without the holy ghost amen so i'm going to just take a step because i don't have as it were a direct scripture that would just lay it out word for word where somebody say oh i get that but look my brother and sister it's by the spirit we enter into the promises of god we cannot mechanically take these promises well he promised me healing so he's got to heal me no you've got to come in the right atmosphere in the right approach to god and step out and say you know what satan now i i go back to that little uh song that brother chris had us uh doing up there at camp you know and we're gonna step forward i don't remember how those words go brother chris hey i went to the enemy's camp and took back what he stole from me now i thought this was great my brother and sister now brother adam when you hear this just forgive me but i looked over and even my brother adam is there doing that and you know brother adam i mean he's just like kind of stoic but look it's something in the heart it's something in the soul that we respond to this my brother and sister i'm going to take back what's been promised to me this moment is not a promise for me to hand to the devil this is not a promise for me to leave on a shelf somewhere this is not a promise that whatever it might be but this is a promise for me to actively and if i recognize satan has somehow started to pull that promise out it's for me to actively pursue it and go back and take it out of the hands of the devil amen now if you just sit there and say wow that that's the devil that wiley character is just stole my joy i guess i get to live until the lord comes with no joy well the way some of you are looking at me right now you believe that come on let your face know you're rejoicing tonight i'll have to make that one of those unspoken prayer requests but you see my brother and sister we have to get into the spirit to enter into the promise because mechanically taken promises from the bible don't work now i've heard testimonies of people say you know i was there i was in this situation and i just said lord you need to change this and he come and he changed it but don't count on it don't live your life in this sub-par region that you're there just expecting god to come and continually make up the difference for you it's a time the word of god says that we need the spirit to enter in and so my brother and sister it's by the spirit that we enter into revelation we use those terms together spirit revelation and we come but you see you have to get into the spirit first it's not just a spirit of revelation comes and just comes upon you god's looking for a people that will get into the spirit and it happens to be strangely enough those people that god gives revelation to and so if we just stoically mechanically present ourself and say well you know god promised to do this i'm just waiting for it to do it you might wait a long time because he's going to move you into the spirit to be able to reach out and claim what has been given to you oh hallelujah now look my brother and sister the word of god says here that we get the spirit of revelation by the holy ghost amen it is not something that is taught people before i've heard these have these words spoke to me well you couldn't explain this well my brother and sister i'll tell you right now that i could explain that but god laid upon my heart leave it alone because you see revelation of the word of god i'll put it in a closer term here revelation of the message does not come by explanation it comes by revelation and revelation only comes to those who have entered even by the spirit of the holy spirit of god and come into that place and god says i pour it out upon you now i'm just summarizing that because i i don't want to be here all night and and keep you all night but you see so it's there it is his divine power if we go back into the scriptures and just look here uh you look at this now my brother and sister according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain into life and godliness you see there's a divine power that has been released upon the bride of christ in this hour it is a season let me let me just use it this way it is a seasonal thing you don't go in december looking for apples on a tree it's a seasonal thing and the prophet of god i'll just paraphrase this back to you the prophet of god said see we could not go and noah couldn't come and say you know what moses i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and preach your message you see it wasn't the season for noah it wasn't the message for noah and so it had to be in season and the word of god's come and we look at this my brother and sister how that in the hour we are god didn't send a seventh age messenger to philadelphia he sent it to laodicea because laodicea is the inn it would be as it were the final season and so the word had to be restored and put back together and this season because it is the final season and there had to be a bride that would come in this season anointed of the holy spirit to understand the restored word it wouldn't do any good to have the word restored and the promises laid back out before the church untarnished unfettered unscrambled and there not be a people ordained of god by revelation to be able to take those restored promises and apply them to their life are we making sense okay i just don't want to get lost in the way you see my notes are very bare here just not much here and i want to i don't want to get lost in the so we look at this it is his divine power i hope every one of us here tonight can say i know what it's like to be anointed with divine power the moving of almighty god in your life you know that doesn't even have to take place in church in fact oftentimes those things take place outside of the church in our time our time in the wilderness as it were and i'm not necessarily meaning like the wilderness of laodicea i'm talking about our times you know i think that's why camp was fun it was good sitting around the fire and you know hearing all of you happy and whatever but you see there's just something about sitting there and looking off and watching the breeze move and just to be there there's something special you know what i'm talking about there's just something that stirs our heart not to say god didn't meet people in the big city but you look through your bible and you often find that god made his prophets in the wilderness because he had to cut everything else out so you look at that and realize my brother and sister it's by this divine power that he declares unto us he's given us all things that pertain into life and godliness now i'm going to just interject this here when people argue whether this seventh seal is open or not we have to go back and look and see what is defined as the seventh seal and my brother and sister brother branham lays this out that the seventh seal is the book of redemption so if we open the book of redemption close the book of redemption put the book of redemption back on the shelf then you and i will not know where we fit in this so when he has released to you and i everything given unto us all things that pertain into life and godliness through the knowledge of him that's called this and to glory and virtue we must recognize that before this bride can be raptured she has to come into a clear view of who she is there cannot be one bit of confusion there cannot be one bid now am i saved or not saved i i did this and i don't know why you know as it were i've been saved for 20 years and today i told a lot i don't understand what's going on i must be backslid the devil's right there yes yes yes yes and you have to be able to realize that the devil's right there dumping every evil spirit he can round up on you trying to get it but the difference is my brother and sister that god would move upon the bride and she would say lord forgive me amen she's not going to hold that she's not going to sweep it under the rug she's going to say lord forgive me and as she moves into that we realize what's happening here is that this knowledge of god now this knowledge of god is not how many times we've read the bible this knowledge of god is not how much we can quote the message this knowledge of god is that personal intimate experience that where we have confidence i won't go into that but it's actually quite a funny story how these people went to las vegas to get married in one of those marriage chapels they were tad bit intoxicated the lady had already walked out and got in a taxi when she realized that she said vows with the wrong man bride's not going to do that she knows who she's wed to she knows who's giving their name to her you see my brother and sister it's not something that just happens so by spirit we enter in and he's given divine power to us i want to know i'm speaking to paul tonight too so don't think i'm just speaking down how many of us have been exercising that divine power it's not for us to talk about it it's not about to say well brother branham had my brother and sister brother branham did what god called him to do can we say amen to that and he has now transferred because all that was in christ was poured down through and i'm going to just put it this way so it's been poured down through a prophetic ministry but the ultimate goal was not for it to stop in a prophetic ministry and the ultimate goal was for it to come down into a people that one day woke up and said you know what every promise is in that book has been given to me and i have authority of the word of god to exercise that amen i don't have to sit back and just hope i have a knowledge and i can speak and i can claim and i can go forward amen in the sermon uh why christ speak brother branham deals with that if you want to go and confirm that you know he didn't want moses to just stop my brother and sister and say my i don't know what we should do here in fact he kind of chided or faulted moses that he didn't just come right down and just claim that and walk right through the red sea but we also can see how that god allowed moses to come as though it seemed like a little confusion upon him because the test wasn't so much for moses as it was for a whole nation because the promise wasn't to moses alone do you know the promise was to every boy and girl mother and father that was following moses just as much as it was to moses now moses hesitated but what if the men following moses at that point you know behind the priests and all of that but what if my brother and sister moses coming down to the red sea and kind of come there and the hesitation and a faltering and people are like what are we going to do what if there had been some men that were so filled with the power of god so filled with the promise of god they would have come up there and said moses speak to this water then we might move on amen moses would have stood right up filled his pride fulfilled the promise that god had put through him and they would have gone forward but you see my brother and sister just because you have strong leadership won't get us in a rapture we follow the ministry of brother branham he's a pro prophet to the laodicean or seventh age praise god we're going in a rapture no you're not you're going to go in a rapture because you have reached out and possessed the promise and you have taken that promise and said devil this is my promise the word gave it to me and i'm claiming this now my brother and sister you see the prophet of god had to be a true word prophet to put it everything in order so all we got to do as it were is walk in those footsteps and we'll have it but there has to be getting in the spirit to make it work amen once again i want to just move forward look how the scripture has put calling into play again in our lives see without calling none of it means anything otherwise we could just take and print this message by the millions and leave them in every truck stop every bus stop whatever and the whole world be saved but you see the world's interpretation of john 3 16 is not god's interpretation of john 3 16. amen well clearly because the word says that he hid it from him lest they would believe and he'd have to save them but you see this is a promise to the partaker now my brother and sister we got young children here so i don't want to go too deep into this but you see the promise to the partaker is not of the carnal because the word carnal itself in the dictionary has a connotation to a sexual it's not to the carnal we cannot come yes the prophet of god said that all through the ages all the prophets all of this come and there was always an another impersonation but it always had a carnal element so we're not looking to the continent we're not looking to what a man can do we're not looking to this but you see it's of the divine nature look at this what defines us now i know it's not you but it's people like you come to church with a little aggravation a little attitude a little something and it might not be uh you know it might not be a big deal but let's just be honest with ourselves does that not hinder us when we come with kind of a wrong attitude it only have to be a big thing we're not talking about we thought about killing the husband collecting life insurance it can just be a little something even to the point you've been so busy in the day that basically it's like go home do this do this do this get ready out the door family we're in church what do you preach about uh from the bible come on we've all been there let's be honest with ourselves you see that's what satan's desiring to do but when we can get into this divine nature we can be that rattled i think we could testify of this tonight you can be that rattled come in and sit down and say oh lord i need you to speak to me tonight i need you lord not just make me feel good tonight so i can go home and say i went to church but lord i truly need you and tell me if god ever disappoints tell me that when we come in that divine nature god said i as it was in this uh in this prophetic words that come forth when people argue over them and i'm not here to argue the point but when the vision come of the tent uh the holy spirit speaks to brother branham and says i will meet you in there was that the doors of a tent somewhere some people believe so was it in the doors of a building somewhere some people believe so but when you enter in to a divine nature it can be here there your car on the mountain at work on your worst day and you create an atmosphere and you invite him in and he comes in and where and sits down and communes with you and you can go and say the wheels fell off the wagon today praise god and people think this guy's nuts but what it is see is you broke the carnal and got into the spiritual or divine and he says i will meet you in there now look my brother and sister if we're looking for something in laodicea that is going to be our escape it's going to be our refuge here in laodicea uh we're in a world hurt amen we might be here but we're in christ you see your your physical location it might be right here in this world but as sons and daughters of god we are in christ not in laodicea you know when i first heard a brother put it that way he said well praise god i'm not even in this world i thought now brother if i went over there and punched you you'd sure know he was here but you come along to the point what he was making was is this might be my current physical body location but i the real me the son of god the son of redemption amen is in christ hallelujah so that's how i can go through this world and be happy gentlemen that comes some of you might have saw him tonight come here he's wanting to collect money to build a sanctuary uh underground with food storage and all of this stuff when when basically the tribulation comes and i in so many nice words told him i thought that was nuts there's only one sanctuary and that's in jesus christ amen we're not gonna build a warehouse underground that's going to store hundreds and hundreds of semi loads of food for christians but i tell you what i've got more shelves in this soul than you can imagine and i have got food stored up lying upon line and oh hallelujah amen just completely filling it up riding on the soul writing and writing and writing until the word is no longer something in print it is no longer oh we revere these pages my brother and sister that word amen the message of this hour been written upon me it's been written upon you hallelujah and if they burn all the pages it won't take that word away from us hallelujah now i'll make a point here in just a little bit i'll read a quote to you now here i don't know what's happened to our screen we'll have to get the brothers to work on that it's no longer a touch screen it's not my business to ask the questions brother brown 1961 the comforter it's not your business to ask the question it's our business to believe him and obey him now see this is look at look real careful here i don't get sidetracked but look here what is the spirit of the very day that we live in well brother branham says there was so many people got baptized here where's our proof i need proof brother branham said that there was all these buses and and trucks filled with wheelchairs and where's the proof oh oh oh we found a pitcher in the newspaper in south africa okay so we kind of have some proof but we don't know that was really brother branham's you see what the devil do he'll anoint us to ask so many questions until and i'm thinking of a certain young man that breaks my heart until we end up pushing the message off so hard we push ourselves right beyond the bible to the place there is no god and end up with nothing now i've said this phrase many times i'll say it again tonight it's okay to ask god a question it's not good to question god now how do you ask a question god you got to give me an answer no sir you come lord i don't understand i would like to see and father if you would be so kind to open my eyes to understand then you take that believing god and if you have to go ahead put it on the shelf god will come and he'll answer can someone say amen that worked for you i tell you i've had questions before and not even two three days later pick up my bible and it fall open and right there the verse that my eyes are drawn to is the answer to my question my god's a faithful god that settles it god said so amen let me go back it's a business to believe him and obey him and feel comfortably while we are resting upon his promise not be a lancy saying if the devil's got you all antsy about the deal then you need to stop and say lord i'm putting this in your hands i'm going to believe what the prophet of god said and i'm going to feel comfortably while we're resting upon his promise god said so that settles it someone said to me once brother branham aren't you afraid when you go to the pulpit there and are called to a showdown aren't you afraid sometimes standing in that line there will be a mistake no sir i'm not afraid because i solemnly rest upon his word you know when we should be nervous about that now i'm not talking about the natural brother david knows brother chris knows amen brother jason would know anyone that's a you know you can just come behind the pulpit and and kind of feel nervous now it's not because we're not certain of what we believe or certain of what we're doing it's just the human deal that we're standing in front of a whole bunch of people who are not smiling okay not so many now but look at this you see standing there will there be a mistake no sir i'm not afraid because i solemnly rest upon his word amen now is this word only to the prophet oh he says i'll be with you now the prophet had this experience that he's recounting right there of the holy spirit speaking to him and says go i'll be with you amen but the word amen we could turn to it tonight but i don't need to you know amen he says i'll be with you even in you amen so we don't have to sit here and say i feel so abandoned you know sometimes you just recognize there's a complex when you go and say well nobody loves me i feel so alone come on witness stop and say devil shut up devil shut up he said he'd be with me in me amen oh hallelujah a guy could preach a whole sermon tonight over that amen because this only responds i'll be with you when he said that to me that night no man shall stand before you all the days of your life he said i'll be with you and he has cut off every enemy now i'm telling you tonight saints that you can stand this might have been god's word amen to brother branham but we have scriptural foundation for this and you and i can stand on this kind of promise right now that he will cut off our enemy and he will be with us every day of our life this is god's promise to us he stood by me when i wasn't deserving to be no surely certainly he wouldn't have said that they misunderstand the mic went no sir aren't you amazed at how god allowed all of these mistakes to be testified from brother branham's lips i tried to kill myself i was so nervous tell them i'm not here all these things that go on i'm not here to recount all of those things why did he do that because god knew you and i we need an example that when these things come upon us we could look and say you know what i'm not the only one god made a promise and he stood by me when i wasn't deserving to be stood by but because that he promised it because of his grace i've rested this is past tense saints this is not i'm in the future going to try and rest upon this he's declaring i've rested solemnly upon that word right because he promised it hallelujah now if it's paul amen that's making the promise move to the next portion please brother amen if it was paul that made that promise and paul never delivered on his promise then you'd have a right to question that but if we sit here tonight and say you know what god does what god says he will do and if god doesn't do what god said he would do then my we might as well just leave because we'll never know what day he decides not to fulfill his word imagine living like that i'll be with you even in you except when you have a fiery furnace in front of you except when there's lions no would never work we couldn't we couldn't be stalwart faithful christians not knowing that god was standing right there with us not knowing that even as it would as we go and i always mispronounce this and my wife just gets a terribly fun time out of it but to fox's book of martyrs amen how could any of them imagine standing saints volunteering i am a believer in jesus christ i will stand at that fiery stake they're either insane or they don't see a fiery stake they see a promise and they have revelation that i was called to fulfill this promise now i want you to see this picture before i move on one side raptured into the glorious presence of god the other side a lion's den coliseum a fiery need i ask you which one you would choose come on are you with me but what if you have revelation that this is the hour this is the season this is my calling this is me fulfilling the word and i will stand here don't even chain me you know why they never let another one volunteer to not be chained because when they lit that brother on fire that the flames were licking up around him and his hair was singing and he should have been screaming and wreathing in pain he lifted his hands and started praising god and there was nothing they could do about it they took sticks and long poles and tried to knock his arms down but they couldn't stop him praising god and from that day forward they chained everyone to the fiery state because it tormented them that in that a man oh he must have been an awesome physical specimen no sir he was a man with a promise and he said if this is what god has called me to i shall fulfill it hallelujah oh the devil's always trying to find a way but what he doesn't realize is god's already got a provided way amen oh hallelujah keep what he's promised that's right how are you going to cross the sea moses said i don't know but he promised that he would be with me he didn't whip out his sat phone and say i'd like to order about 400 barges no sir did he display some confusion this is an interesting thing can i can i deviate for one second this is an interesting thing about how god works he will let you and i in the physical realm mental realm experience confusion amen we think oh praise god i'm a christian i'll have just clarity i will know what to do in this situation no sir i had a little situation sometime back i was in confusion a brother come to me and says brother paul i feel like the lord spoke to me and this is what you should do and the minute he spoke those words i had clarity amen that was from the lord but you know i'm a pastor i should have an answer for everything yes so he says now i don't know but he promised that he would be with me so don't never cross the bridge till you get to it now i'm gonna i'm gonna pick on some of you right now how many of you get a little something in your family and your life and whatever and you are just practically i've witnessed you i won't mention names i'll leave it as unspoken but i i've seen you like oh brother paul you know i'm praying about it [Music] really why oh lord help paul lord help paul don't cross the bridge till you get to it amen we're over here chewing our fingernails off we've got them chewed right to the quick everybody hold your fingernails up i want to look we chew them right to the quick and then god comes on the scene amen and it just all goes away and we've got well most of you don't chew your thumbs but some of you do i've watched you why let god be god amen don't try and cross the bridge before stay with god's word and god will open up the way because he is the way yes moses was comforted by the word that god spoke to him and i knew this wouldn't be short now look second peter 3 1 this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of the words that were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation so we have the word declaring to us the scoffers are ordained to be here you're not ordained to listen to them amen you're not ordained to say god has forsaken us and this must be what you know you hear a preacher preaching well you know the things that happen in the world we thought god was going to elect donald trump and going to just turn this nation back to god and we were going to do this and do that and i guess god has forgotten us god has left us and you know this must be what they felt in the wilderness listen to yourself sir listen to yourself you're declaring this disappointment you're declaring unfulfilled promise is now what defines you in your relationship with god though all hell assail me i shall not be moved because i have a promise of the word of god amen i have a promise and i'll tell you where the promise of his coming is oh you can say it's in the bible it's in the bible the there's the promise of his coming i'll tell you where the promise of his coming is in this laodicean age it's right down here in the hearts and souls of sons and daughters of god that it doesn't matter what looks around us my brother and sister it doesn't matter what it is that we're going to stand and say you know what i know in whom i believe oh hallelujah and saying where's the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from beginning of creation we're certainly living in that day you know that his promise is his word can we can we say amen to that and his promise is in his word so we look at this and now i want to i want to just close with this right here uh anointed ones in the end time amen now you want to see how we can stand so solid upon this so it is the promise is his word and the promise is in his word right now look what the prophet of god says here look at the last days it'd be so close to deceive the very elect if it was possible oh my the reason the elected won't be deceived you know why is because they are the word they're not hearing the word they're not speaking the word someone's not telling them about the word they are the word hallelujah and that is what is defining in the moment we live in saints people are like well you know we believe brother brown was a prophet but there are certain things we can't reconcile that's good you focus on those things that can't be reconciled i'm going to focus on being the word amen i'm not going to be focused on whether this person that was famous in the message or that family that was famous in the message or this church this that and the other no sir i'm going to focus on the fact that i am the word and the word has a season i left the quote out tonight wished i'd put it in now that brother branham is talking about how the season comes and it is in that season my brother and sister this word could not be manifested in you even six months ago not a year ago not five years ago today is the day for us to be able to stand up and say i am the word and the very promise of my future is in the word which if you'll give me this liberty the very promise of my future is already in me and i base that statement on the fact the prophet of god said what you need for the rapture is already in you why because you have the word in you you're not just a person trying to live the message you are the message of this hour you were predestinated for this season this circumstance this time this trial this victory hallelujah not to just sit back and say oh my hope the lord comes quickly yes we can pray that but it better not be your plan to escape hallelujah lord you've got to come in the next 30 days or we're toast really lord you come oh let me put it this way lord you come when we the bride are ready because you see you can't take an immature wife he's not taking a baby to raise her up he wants if i can put it this way he wants a wife that he's not ashamed to put his name on not one that he's like yeah i know she can't cook she can't clean she just wants to play with dolls no sir he wants a wife he wants a wife that says you know what i have a promise i have the word i have a situation i'm going to claim the promise and i'm going to apply the word to the situation well did you call your pastor i didn't need to did you call your husband i didn't need to why well because i am the word and so as it is my brother and sister i just want to make this example little vanessa's right here she looked like she'd been in an alley fight just a day or two ago but god's come on the scene amen look at this cute little thing i love the little girl with all of my heart but my brother and sister you see it's not that we have to rally all the troops and have everybody drive to our house 100 miles an hour with horns and flashers going a mama can just come and lay your hands on this darling little girl and say lord in your precious name amen i claim this why we have a promise hallelujah and that promise is no good saints if we don't stand on it right we can quote it we can reference it for scripture but unless we stand on it it won't do us any good hallelujah see i do have a little side note here and we are finished if the musicians would come the season of the word now i took these from statement that the prophet of god said and i kind of you might say put a little spin on it if that would bother somebody because what he said i realized what he was meeting and you see the season of the word now i take that from the fact that brother brown says noah couldn't preach moses's message so the season of the word had to be noah's message in noah's season moses's message in moses's season and the bride's message in the bride's season oh hallelujah aren't you glad we're in season saints we're not out of season amen we are in season this is the season of the bride of christ amen moving forward this promise did you know this promise endures beyond the rapture amen [Music] amen i hear so many people oh lord if we can just make the rapture no you know i'm looking beyond the rapture by revelation i'm looking beyond the rapture hallelujah i'm looking to the millennial reign i'm looking at living and dwelling with the lord jesus christ and the saints through eternity we're looking beyond the rapture hallelujah what is it god's eternal promise now i'll give you a little homework if you want to go home brother branham speak several times about god's eternal promise hallelujah we have a promise saints it has no expiration date or as they say in places like australia it's got no expiry no time it comes to an end no time it's no longer valid go look through your bible look at it you realize god didn't say now i'm gonna be with you as i said earlier until you get in the lion's den no he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world in the end of the earth oh isn't that beautiful i say tonight thank you lord amen let's just stand and praise the lord for just a moment hallelujah amen now look your pastor usually preaches longer than this so we're going to just go ahead and spend this time worshiping hallelujah every promise in the book is mine and now look saints can i ask a little something special out of you can you just go ahead and reach out and take a hold of them promise tonight don't sing it as a song sing it as a testimony in my heart lord i'm declaring tonight every promise in this book is mine hallelujah every promise in the book is mine oh every chapter every verse every line i am trusting in his love divine cause every promise in the book let's sing the chorus again oh every promise in the book is mine oh every chapter every verse every line will i am trusting in his love divine the every promise in the book is mine it meets my needs and takes care of me he fills my life with peace and joy he answers prayer he's always there i will live with him forever cause every promise in the book is mine well every chapter every verse every life well i am trusting in his love divine cause every promise in the book is mine my friend and when i sin he offers me forgiveness he freely gives his promises because he loves me so oh every promise in the book is mine well every chapter every verse every line that i am trusting in his love divine the every promise in the book is mine i like that third line amen and that's in verse that third line he freely gives his promise hallelujah not grudgingly not like well i'll promise to be with them can i share just a little testimony unnamed pastor of a church i don't like to throw people on the bus you know i don't i don't like to do that had some young people coming up to some finals in high school one young sister comes to the [Music] altar to the platform on a sunday evening says pastor i've taken all the pretests i've done this and i i just can't i cannot pass this i'm going to fail and he says now sister i want you to change your confession i want you to speak right here i believe he had like a mic tie stuck it right in her face i want you to speak right here by god's grace i will pass every test and that little girl stand in there she wants to speak it but she's hesitant right because she's looking at all of the circumstances you know what was so unique as the pastor says there's more of you y'all go to the same high school there's more of you come up here they all gathered around they prayed for them [Music] and unfortunate for the devil every one of them passed those tests with flying colors you know what it fostered now if i could just bring an example like this you'd have an older girl she's got her test she's got a pass but there's a little girl who heard this testimony she saw the action and she said i believe too lord help me with my schoolwork and in a short time they had a transformation in their church thank you lord he can even make us dummies successful all we got to do is claim [Music] he's my friend and when i sin he offers me forgiveness he freely gives paul his promise because he loves me so come on let that be your heart tonight don't reign yourself in don't look at your clock look at this and say lord that's who i want to be i want to stand here and be able to declare he's my friend and when i sin he offers me forgiveness [Music] and he freely whoever wrote this song was inspired because you see right after you've sinned and you've got forgiveness they placed freely being given a promise of god right in the next line hallelujah you love the lord tonight how great are you lord how great is your mercy [Music] how great are the things and you have claim it tonight saints oh lord you've done for me how great of you lord it's your lovingkindness oh you're filling my heart as i sing how great are you how great is your love it reaches to the heaven how great is the heart at sod and rescued me how great are you lord praising saints how great is your mercy how great are the things oh lord i'm remembering i'm remembering lord what you've done for me you saved my soul you've healed my body oh hallelujah are you lord is filling my heart as i sing how great are you lord let's just close on this little chorus my loving kindness amen can we say amen to that god's loving kindness you don't have to look very far in our lives do we see god's love poured out on us hallelujah you know it makes me think i i'm trying to not preach here saints honest but it reminds me of the scripture says to whom much is forgiven isn't it interesting some of the most expressive most outgoing have quite a back story [Music] can i stir your pure minds tonight i wonder what it would have been like to go to church with rahab [Music] so i think rahab probably knew that song quite well he has forgiven i don't believe she could have just said on her hands saying don't let the devil cause you i'm not trying to get you to praise i'm not trying to do that i want you to praise however god anoint you to praise but you need to be praising you might be sitting here right now with your hands in front of you beside you whatever it might be but let your soul be praising amen we got something to praise him for amen hallelujah oh help me hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] is [Music] me i will lift off my hands in your name is [Music] my hands [Music] shall praise will i [Music] you noticed it didn't say at church hallelujah praise him in the morning praise him in the noon time praise him in the evening praise him when the sun goes down god bless you saints i pray tonight lord just stir your hearts this promise is to you amen this is not a promise to a different age it's not a promise just to the ministry of this day it's a promise to you the bride who has a ministry in this day oh god bless you we shall see you on sunday amen [Music] so [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] go [Music] so [Music] so [Music] foreign
