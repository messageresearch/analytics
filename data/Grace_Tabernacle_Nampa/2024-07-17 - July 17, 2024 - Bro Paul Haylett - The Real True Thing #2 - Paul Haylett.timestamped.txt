[35:01] Lord touching her in her body from the
[35:03] surgery and stuff so just very happy to

[35:09] just a kind of a sparse group tonight so
[35:12] happy to see each and every one of you
[35:15] amen Let's uh I want to speak to you
[35:18] once again kind of a part two real true
[35:21] thing thank you musicians you play so
[35:24] beautifully tonight amen and brother
[35:27] Alex I appreciate the song Service uh
[35:30] spoke to my heart just certain thoughts
[35:32] that that we think on Amen the Lord's
[35:35] faithful and true the real true thing
[35:38] amen we took that from um uh a
[35:42] quotation um brought that out of a
[35:45] quotation brother brandham says and uh I
[35:48] want to speak to you tonight on the
[35:50] Scarecrow is placed at the real thing
[35:54] amen and um it will be kind of self-
[35:57] exlan an atory as we go into the word if
[36:00] you'll turn this evening to Matthew 13
[36:03] uh verse 24-30 and then verses 37- 40
[36:08] and we'll just draw a a little
[36:11] foundation for our thought and U he says
[36:15] like this another Parable put he forth
[36:19] unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven
[36:22] is like un to a man which sowed good
[36:24] seed in his field but while men slept
[36:28] his enemy came and SED tears among the
[36:30] wheat and went his way but when the
[36:33] blade was sprung up and brought forth
[36:37] fruit now it wasn't
[36:40] when the blade just come up but it's
[36:44] when it come to the season of bringing
[36:47] forth
[36:49] fruit then appeared the tears also so
[36:53] the Servants of the householder came and
[36:55] said unto him sir D thou not so good
[36:58] seed in thy field from whence then hath
[37:01] it
[37:02] tears and I want to interject this real
[37:05] quick my brother and sister the world
[37:09] has such a a watered down or loose view
[37:12] of John
[37:14] 3:16 that um it's almost in their world
[37:19] you if you go to church you have
[37:22] fulfilled John
[37:24] 3:16 but we recognize that it goes much
[37:28] deeper than that there is a personal
[37:31] commitment to our lord Jesus himself not
[37:34] to our
[37:35] church I I I hope this doesn't shock you
[37:38] but I've been watching some
[37:39] documentaries on people who have come
[37:42] out of different churches different
[37:44] religions and and I find it quite
[37:48] interesting uh that you look and and um
[37:52] people come out but in these
[37:55] documentaries very few of them actually
[37:58] go into uh you might say a church or or
[38:02] a body of Believers that's much
[38:04] different than what they came out of and
[38:07] uh so they'll say we've been delivered
[38:09] we've been set free but they have just
[38:12] turned and brother brandom deals with
[38:14] this and we won't go into it in depth
[38:16] but they just turned and went to another
[38:19] and uh they're never really found
[38:21] absolute true deliverance from the
[38:25] spirit of the age and so you know it's
[38:28] there that uh uh we're not looking my
[38:32] brother and sister to convert the tear
[38:35] this is something that people sometimes
[38:37] get questionable about John 3:16 because
[38:40] they think that we're here to convert
[38:42] the world but the prophet of God himself
[38:44] says that um they won't hear it so
[38:50] sounds a little harsh doesn't it
[38:51] basically it's just saying there's a
[38:53] huge chunk of the the populace that will
[38:56] will never hear it
[38:58] and yet we're called to live the gospel
[39:01] and present the gospel to each and every
[39:04] one as though they are seed and uh
[39:08] that's how we should approach it we
[39:09] shouldn't be the one trying to judge so
[39:12] you look and see how this is uh he said
[39:15] uh unto them an enemy hath done this the
[39:19] servant said unto him wilt thou then
[39:21] that we go and gather them up but he
[39:23] said nay lest while ye gather up the
[39:26] tears you root up also the wheat with
[39:29] them let both grow together until the
[39:32] Harvest and I can tell you at the
[39:34] harvest season you can tell the
[39:36] difference between the wheat and The
[39:39] Tear and in the time of harvest I will
[39:41] say to the Reapers Gather ye together
[39:43] first the tears and bind them in bundles
[39:46] to burn them but gather the wheat into
[39:49] my barn verse 37 he says answered and
[39:52] said unto them he that Seth The Good
[39:54] Seed is the son of man the field is the
[39:57] wor
[39:57] the good seed are the children of the
[40:00] Kingdom but the tears are the children
[40:02] of the wicked one so taking them right
[40:05] back and tying them to can seed taking
[40:08] them right back to the very beginning of
[40:11] the wicked
[40:12] one the enemy that Seth them is the
[40:15] devil and the Harvest is the end of the
[40:16] world and the reapers are the angels as
[40:19] therefore the tears are gathered and
[40:22] burned in the fire so it shall be in the
[40:24] end of this world Heavenly Father we
[40:27] thank you Lord for the opportunity to
[40:29] come into your house today and while
[40:32] many are not here tonight father we come
[40:35] together father not to socialize but to
[40:38] gather in your presence and we thank you
[40:41] Lord your promise of being here and we
[40:43] know it's true it's fulfilled in our
[40:45] lives you are here tonight and Lord we
[40:48] ask you to bless each and every one that
[40:50] are here and those father maybe
[40:52] listening in maybe circumstances kept
[40:55] them from the house of God tonight but
[40:57] Lord we ask you to be with them and lead
[41:00] them and guide them we pray in the name
[41:02] of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[41:08] seated now I think we can take this and
[41:12] and see from the natural in the
[41:15] spiritual uh and tie that together as we
[41:17] go tonight so I don't have to spend too
[41:19] much time making each one of these
[41:21] correlations but there is a lot of seed
[41:24] sown amen and in that good seed is
[41:27] strong and full of vigor and and you
[41:29] know when you have good seed because it
[41:32] immediately shows an Evidence of
[41:34] strength and growth uh everything about
[41:37] it shows that it it is doing well and
[41:40] Bad Seed which is low germination often
[41:43] times is a sign uh in the natural bad
[41:46] color slow growth all of these things
[41:49] are are a sign of Bad Seed and my
[41:52] brother and sisters we'll take this into
[41:54] the context of what we are drawing our
[41:57] thought from tonight we'll see that in
[42:00] this realm that the difference of the
[42:02] good seed and bad seed is not evident at
[42:05] the moment the seed is planted it is
[42:07] there it's not not obvious but we will
[42:10] find that as time goes on there is a lot
[42:14] of times that we will as as uh
[42:17] especially those in the ministry we
[42:19] we'll see people and it seems like you
[42:21] know that God starts to do something
[42:23] they get over into maybe a certain
[42:25] movement or group or Fellowship
[42:27] and and they just don't appear to be
[42:29] doing so well it's not really what we
[42:32] would would desire for them but remember
[42:35] sometimes God just allows uh those
[42:38] things to go and and they uh take place
[42:41] and and it appears that it's went a
[42:43] different way but then there's a hunger
[42:45] and thirst in that individual or family
[42:48] that draws them out of that because it's
[42:50] not us against them it's not our church
[42:53] against their church it's us and we are
[42:56] standing for the word which you might
[42:58] say it's us against the devil but even
[43:00] then it's not really us it's the word
[43:03] amen that is against the devil we we are
[43:06] not going to conquer Satan of ourselves
[43:09] but the word that is in us and so we'll
[43:12] see how that God will take and allow
[43:14] people to go sometime for years and then
[43:17] he starts working on them and and they
[43:20] find themselves with a great desire to
[43:22] be in the house of God a great desire to
[43:25] hear the word preached a great desire to
[43:27] dig in and and uh find it for themselves
[43:30] you might say and you know The Bad Seed
[43:34] amen they can handle watered down
[43:36] theological teaching low Vigor they they
[43:40] just it doesn't bother them they can be
[43:42] in the house of God and and say you know
[43:45] what that was good enough for me today
[43:47] but U my brother and sister the seed of
[43:49] discrepancy the prophet of God talking
[43:51] about that the seed of discrepancy is
[43:54] the same looking seed even you might say
[43:58] has the same genetic background but that
[44:00] seed was never called to bring forth a h
[44:04] hundredfold that seed is unable to
[44:07] produce what is desired of it and so
[44:10] that seed of discrepancy H it is there
[44:13] it appears to be so a perfect example in
[44:16] the natural is to have Wild Oats growing
[44:19] amongst your oats uh you don't know it
[44:22] until the head has completely come out
[44:25] that the wild oat is there but we'll
[44:27] look and see my brother and sister as
[44:30] the prophet of God so clearly shows us
[44:32] and the word shows it so clearly that it
[44:35] appears so close it you see it in a
[44:38] field a as it's growing in the
[44:41] vegetative state and it's all nice and
[44:44] green and dark green and Broad leaves
[44:47] and it's just growing waving in the wind
[44:49] all worshiping but yet when the head
[44:52] comes forth and I hope you can make that
[44:54] correlation yourself we won't dwell on
[44:56] it when the head comes forth and shows
[44:59] itself in evidence that's when each
[45:02] plant each seed really shows what it is
[45:06] not until the head comes forth I say my
[45:09] brother and sister to keep this short
[45:11] tonight I've left a lot of things out
[45:14] but my brother and sister the head has
[45:16] come amen it's in our midst and we see
[45:19] what it is and it's bringing forth and
[45:21] showing us who we literally are amen not
[45:25] figurative not some kind of analogy but
[45:27] it is showing literally who we are in
[45:31] Jesus Christ amen some people get all
[45:33] nervous I'll touch on that in a minute
[45:35] they get all nervous about this I don't
[45:37] want to be deceived but my brother and
[45:39] sister tonight we're going to be talking
[45:41] about some scarecrows and I read this
[45:44] standing in the Gap uh I read this last
[45:47] Wednesday amen I believe I
[45:50] did yes we have a lot of impersonations
[45:54] we have people that get up and try to
[45:56] act like Christians and their lives
[45:58] don't compare so there is something
[46:00] wrong Jesus said by their fruits you'll
[46:02] know them see that's how you know a
[46:05] Christian by how he lives don't ever
[46:08] jump any higher than you live so then
[46:11] just now look my brother and sister we
[46:13] might get disappointed in looking at
[46:15] ourself of not trying to jump any higher
[46:18] than we live and we think oh my
[46:20] sometimes I I probably just need to keep
[46:22] my feet on the ground amen but look at
[46:25] what the prophet of God says but in that
[46:28] so he's catching this and tying it back
[46:30] into that but in that it's a devil
[46:33] making a scarecrow to keep the real
[46:36] genuine believer away from the true
[46:39] thing of it amen so what is Satan doing
[46:42] he's using our own flesh our own
[46:45] thoughts and emotions against us as a
[46:48] scarecrow to keep us from stepping into
[46:51] that word and stepping into that promise
[46:54] hindering us from from taking the full
[46:57] power of the word but God help us to
[47:00] separate and to be able to discern
[47:03] between right and wrong and I say yes
[47:05] Lord help us and the word will always
[47:09] straighten that out I say thank you Lord
[47:13] for the fact that the word amen we're
[47:15] not here for a theology we're here for
[47:17] the word and the word is going to keep
[47:20] us straight I say thank you Lord that it
[47:23] straightens us out some people say well
[47:25] the word is pretty Sharp pretty hard
[47:27] that hurt a little bit thank God for
[47:30] that it's keeping us lined up amen and
[47:33] so we move forward I say thank you Lord
[47:37] because I know that if it hadn't been
[47:38] for the Lord I'd be really messed up but
[47:40] he keeps straightening us up now the
[47:43] Devil he's pretty clever he likes
[47:46] nothing better than to cause you to
[47:49] limit
[47:53] yourself the scripture says if your
[47:57] heart condemns you
[48:00] not what does Satan do he tries to jump
[48:03] in there he uses the word it comes we
[48:07] don't accept it in quite the right
[48:09] fashion or or we're we're struggling in
[48:12] that and all of a sudden we're limiting
[48:15] ourself I can't tell you how many times
[48:17] through the years that people have not
[48:19] taken
[48:21] communion over things that all they
[48:23] needed to do is stop and say Lord
[48:26] forgive for me for that and then step
[48:28] forward and take communion and draw the
[48:30] strength from communion to press forward
[48:33] but Satan gets them in such a position
[48:36] so bound up that all they can see is the
[48:38] mistake that they made and then they
[48:41] hinder themselves instead of repentance
[48:44] they hold and pull themselves in kind of
[48:46] like the turtle you know why Turtles
[48:48] don't go very far because every time
[48:51] they sense there's a threat they pull
[48:53] back into themselves and they don't keep
[48:56] on walk walking amen that's why Turtles
[48:58] are slow well my brother and sister we
[49:01] want to be Sons and Daughters of God and
[49:04] when we realize that there's a threat as
[49:06] it were we want to just walk right into
[49:08] the word walk right into the presence of
[49:11] God not pull our head in our legs back
[49:13] in and say well I'll just not do
[49:15] anything no we need to stand up and say
[49:18] Lord there's an altar there's blood I
[49:21] want to be there I want to be right and
[49:23] so many people hinder themselves when it
[49:25] comes to communion because of that so
[49:28] Satan loves to cause you to limit
[49:30] yourself amen now my brother and sister
[49:33] this is kind of a I'll give you just the
[49:35] briefest of explanation here I've been
[49:38] recently contacted by what appears to be
[49:41] a denominational uh uh Minister from
[49:44] Tanzania and and he wants us to support
[49:47] his Outreach into the the bush and and
[49:51] um you know we don't know anything about
[49:53] him he's looking for that but on his
[49:56] little um uh uh deal there with some
[49:59] words that struck me very very uh uh
[50:02] just very direct and underneath his
[50:05] little deal it says faith has no
[50:11] reverse Hallelujah we got nowhere to go
[50:13] backwards to my brother and sister we
[50:15] were called to go back in other words
[50:17] we've never been equipped with reverse
[50:19] as Christians amen so by God's grace now
[50:23] now if Satan can get us to go back up on
[50:26] the word then what are
[50:29] we
[50:32] backslid amen but you see if we cannot
[50:37] go back on the word then Satan has no
[50:39] power over us amen he is completely
[50:43] limited when we don't back up amen when
[50:46] we stand our ground stand on the spot I
[50:48] don't care if it's something maybe in
[50:50] your own personal life I don't care if
[50:52] it's in your marriage I don't care if
[50:54] it's with your children or whatever the
[50:56] issue is if we don't back up on the word
[51:00] then God is there to stand behind his
[51:03] word because he's never walked away from
[51:05] his word he's never let his words fall
[51:08] to the ground he's never let a promise
[51:11] go unfulfilled and if we don't back up
[51:13] that means those promises are going to
[51:16] come to pass not a hope so but they will
[51:20] absolutely come to pass because that's
[51:22] God's word amen and so you see if we
[51:26] don't backslide or back up on the word
[51:29] see it's not about it's not about uh you
[51:32] and I my brother and sister it's about
[51:34] the word too many people they they get
[51:37] well I I have this and I have that I
[51:40] feel spiritual or or whatever it might
[51:43] be my brother and sister it's not about
[51:45] how we feel it's about the word amen
[51:48] we're not the primary factor the word is
[51:51] amen and we need to stay in the word
[51:54] amen that's our refuge that's our count
[51:56] to hide in amen now in identification of
[52:01] Christ in all ages we look here got
[52:04] quite a few quotes tonight I hope you
[52:05] don't mind amen Heavenly Father we're
[52:08] grateful to see the Risen Messiah 1900
[52:11] years of all kinds of Theology and
[52:14] movements amen I've been studying on
[52:17] movements so that might be a little bit
[52:19] why we have this quote here but still it
[52:21] it it's applicable but still in the
[52:24] darkness of all of it you promis that
[52:27] you would appear here in the last days
[52:29] in this Sodom day and you would make
[52:31] yourself known to the children of
[52:33] Abraham the called the elected and here
[52:36] you are tonight after 19900 years you're
[52:40] just as much alive tonight as you was
[52:43] when you talked to the woman at the well
[52:46] can we say Amen to that it's God
[52:49] manifested in flesh now in the
[52:53] flesh of his bride
[52:58] is there any bride here
[53:00] tonight that means God is manifested in
[53:03] our flesh here tonight now I'm not
[53:08] expecting some great reaction don't
[53:10] misunderstand me but I can tell you when
[53:13] you work hard and bust a few Knuckles
[53:15] during the day you come to church you
[53:18] don't always feel like God's in your
[53:22] flesh do you have those kind of days
[53:25] yeah
[53:27] you don't feel like how could it be God
[53:29] in this flesh well my brother and
[53:32] sister he felt that before you felt that
[53:36] he was tested in every way that we are
[53:40] tested so he knows exactly what it feels
[53:43] like to be weary and discouraged and
[53:45] have things go wrong and and you know it
[53:48] just seems like it it's not there he
[53:50] knows but he still chose your flesh I
[53:53] say thank you Lord tonight thank you
[53:56] Lord Lord that you would choose us
[53:57] tonight now in the flesh of his bride
[54:00] for the bride and the husband is the
[54:03] same self flesh these two are one amen I
[54:09] love that my brother and sister you talk
[54:11] about something in other words I know I
[54:14] will never satisfy this I know that you
[54:16] can never satisfy this but Christ in you
[54:20] will be Victorious and overcome and
[54:22] satisfy this word amen it's not us alone
[54:26] but is us with our bridegroom amen and
[54:29] the church is becoming the bride all the
[54:32] time by her works and her labors and her
[54:36] struggle and her
[54:38] knowledge oh did I misread that
[54:42] quote by believing the
[54:46] word this is a Works gospel do you know
[54:49] that some people would go whoa whoa whoa
[54:51] not a Works gospel it is a Works gospel
[54:54] and the work is you believing the word
[54:58] there's the work it's not how good
[55:00] you've been how much you gave to the
[55:02] poor or whatever you've done my brother
[55:04] and sister it's believing the word so
[55:07] that the word and the church becomes the
[55:09] same the word in the church making it
[55:13] the bride the last sign God identifying
[55:16] himself the word in the
[55:21] church so we got to get the word inside
[55:23] this building
[55:27] see that's not the church God's looking
[55:29] for you are the church you are the body
[55:32] that he's put himself in and then he's
[55:35] looking down on that and saying I'll
[55:37] bless them because my word is in them
[55:41] and yet he's the one who put the word in
[55:43] us but he blesses us for having the word
[55:46] in us now that's a win-win if I've ever
[55:49] heard one amen where he does the work he
[55:51] makes the way he provides everything and
[55:54] then blesses us for receiving
[55:56] amen oh thank you Lord
[55:59] hallelujah
[56:01] amen you see it's not so much how much
[56:03] we can
[56:05] quote now I know it seems like I'm not
[56:08] on my subject but it is amen it's not
[56:11] how much we can quote come on Saints I
[56:13] I've known men that I knew personally
[56:15] could quote quote quote but I'll be
[56:18] honest with you uh they're unnamed so
[56:20] I'm not judging them I wouldn't trust
[56:23] them with a dollar but could quote this
[56:28] message is that what we're looking
[56:31] for no it's not how much we can quote
[56:35] it's what we can live what he in us can
[56:39] live out that's what he's looking for
[56:42] he's not looking for our abilities or
[56:45] natural or the IQ you know I I I me
[56:48] being on the opposite end of this
[56:50] spectrum uh forgive me for using this as
[56:53] a little analogy but um if it was about
[56:56] how much we could quote I'd be lost
[56:58] because you see uh I can read something
[57:01] and 10 minutes later I have a hard time
[57:03] repeating the exact words of it I don't
[57:06] know if you're like that we know there's
[57:08] some Minds out there that that can uh
[57:10] read something a week ago and quote it
[57:13] word by word right now amen I knew a kid
[57:16] in high school could quote the whole
[57:18] Gettysburg DRFT and I forget what the
[57:21] other deal was see I
[57:24] forgot but he could quote those
[57:27] word for word perfect pause in the
[57:30] punctuation and I got past line two and
[57:34] the rest got fuzzy and I flunked that in
[57:38] class in
[57:41] history but it's us so immersed in the
[57:44] word till we have become the word that's
[57:48] what God's looking for be immersed in
[57:52] the word that it becomes it soaks in and
[57:55] becomes our very I of our being you know
[57:58] there's so many different things um I
[58:00] I'll just use this as a little uh carnal
[58:03] uh comparison but you take lacker
[58:05] thinner I painted for many years was a
[58:07] little bit sloppy about my health and
[58:10] and I it has affected me but you take
[58:13] lacquer thinner and you put your hand in
[58:15] a bucket of lacquer thinner
[58:18] pause and then pull it out and in 7
[58:22] Seconds Locker thinner is in your
[58:24] bloodstream
[58:28] and then your kidneys your liver your
[58:31] brain your heart all have to deal with
[58:35] the effect of lacquer
[58:38] thinner it's nowhere listed in the
[58:40] healthy
[58:42] guide but if in the natural lacquer
[58:45] thinner would do that and enter into
[58:47] your bloodstream so quickly how much
[58:50] more so we as Sons and Daughters of God
[58:52] immersing ourselves in the word of God
[58:55] will come in and affect every phase
[58:58] every attribute everything about our
[59:01] life he comes in if we will pause long
[59:06] enough to let it
[59:10] in
[59:13] Hallelujah
[59:15] now I'm working Along on this okay if
[59:18] you don't mind we're getting there in
[59:21] the seven Church ages the sman church
[59:24] age chapter 4 uh brother Brown shares
[59:28] this and uh it it's just very
[59:31] interesting to me because I'd had some
[59:33] thoughts along in this come out uh this
[59:36] quote why just a few weeks ago I read an
[59:39] editorial an unsaved
[59:43] businessman not by a Christian he said
[59:46] that he was amazed at the churches he
[59:49] could not understand them they had
[59:51] seminaries filled with professors who
[59:54] taught the word of God in order to
[59:57] destroy
[1:00:00] it I personally in my inquisitive mind
[1:00:05] was looking at some teachings of a
[1:00:08] certain man here
[1:00:10] recently big audience 10,000 people in
[1:00:15] the in the
[1:00:17] auditorium and he makes a
[1:00:19] statement now if these words talking
[1:00:23] about the Bible if these words are
[1:00:32] true let's not put that kind of language
[1:00:35] in our
[1:00:36] mouth if this be
[1:00:39] true he went on to to say this is so
[1:00:42] miraculous beyond anything that we can
[1:00:45] comprehend and I thought as I was
[1:00:47] listening to this truly it is beyond
[1:00:51] what humans can comprehend but it's not
[1:00:54] above God's mind
[1:00:56] in you and I it's not above him giving
[1:00:59] us Revelation to understand what it is
[1:01:02] to stand in Heavenly places what it is
[1:01:05] to be so filled with the power of God
[1:01:07] they could boil you in oil and can't
[1:01:10] kill you they could throw you in Fire
[1:01:13] and can't kill you they can do
[1:01:15] everything they want to do and they
[1:01:17] can't harm you the Viper can bite you
[1:01:20] and it won't harm you it is beyond the
[1:01:22] human comprehension and they would look
[1:01:25] at that and say if that was a certain
[1:01:27] kind of Viper there's no way he shook it
[1:01:30] off and
[1:01:32] lived but that's because they're
[1:01:34] approaching it without the Holy Ghost
[1:01:37] they're approaching it in a carnal realm
[1:01:39] they're approaching it the scarecrow has
[1:01:42] said and they don't believe it can go
[1:01:45] beyond what the scarecrow has
[1:01:47] said they had seminaries filled with
[1:01:49] professors who taught the word of God in
[1:01:51] order to destroy it now then this man
[1:01:54] could not figure that out he was
[1:01:56] appalled by it and rightly so he said
[1:01:59] that he could understand the atheist or
[1:02:01] communist or freethinker or someone else
[1:02:04] doing that but when the church itself
[1:02:08] destroyed the word of God it was Tatam
[1:02:11] out to premeditated
[1:02:14] murder now imagine these Souls that
[1:02:18] would be there under that influence and
[1:02:21] say it doesn't
[1:02:23] matter God doesn't care
[1:02:27] it's
[1:02:28] unimportant that's premeditated murder
[1:02:31] they're sending those souls to hell
[1:02:33] because a scarecrow in a fine suit in a
[1:02:36] building or in this day it would be more
[1:02:38] like ripped jeans in a muscle shirt got
[1:02:41] to have a nice big gold cross right
[1:02:42] because a gold cross makes you a
[1:02:44] Christian amen if that's the case half
[1:02:48] the mafia are are
[1:02:50] saved but my brother and sister see when
[1:02:53] they look at that and they are doing
[1:02:55] what have they done they've killed their
[1:02:57] soul it will take the grace of God to
[1:02:59] break down the influence of that uh uh
[1:03:02] scarecrow that has been put out there my
[1:03:05] brother and sister you know I think we a
[1:03:08] little exercise right the scripture says
[1:03:10] that it profiteth little doesn't say it
[1:03:12] doesn't profit that's fine but when you
[1:03:15] have a whole world that's attracted to a
[1:03:18] culture of guys standing up there you
[1:03:20] know and you you know sorry for putting
[1:03:23] it this way you know how these guys look
[1:03:26] all pumped up before they they go out in
[1:03:29] public or do whatever they just don't
[1:03:31] walk around like that all the way they
[1:03:33] go in a gym room somewhere and they pump
[1:03:35] some iron for a little while and get the
[1:03:37] blood flow and they walk out with these
[1:03:39] big bulging muscles that tells you these
[1:03:41] men premeditated to come out looking
[1:03:44] like they
[1:03:45] look they didn't go into a back room and
[1:03:48] get down on their knees and pray and
[1:03:51] come out with some spiritual muscle to
[1:03:53] share with the body of Believers to
[1:03:55] encourage and strengthen them they come
[1:03:57] out to impress with a world carnal view
[1:04:01] that would cause them why because it's
[1:04:03] of the wicked
[1:04:05] one it becomes a
[1:04:09] scarecrow when the church gets away from
[1:04:11] the word it will believe oh let me move
[1:04:14] back up but when the church itself
[1:04:16] destroyed the word of God it was Tatam
[1:04:18] out to premeditated murder there is your
[1:04:21] hybrid religion wake up America before
[1:04:24] it's too late when the church Church
[1:04:26] gets away from the word it will believe
[1:04:29] anything Grace Tabernacle we ever get
[1:04:31] away from the word we will start
[1:04:34] believing anything amen the word is our
[1:04:38] security the word is our strength the
[1:04:40] word is our defense the word is our very
[1:04:43] life and there is no other life in this
[1:04:46] leoan age that will give to us what we
[1:04:49] need amen but the word will amen it's it
[1:04:54] is like Eve and when Cain was born she
[1:04:57] said I've gotten a man from the Lord now
[1:04:59] do you realize that she really meant
[1:05:01] that see see where Eve was at so
[1:05:04] deceived so caught up in that deception
[1:05:07] that scarecrow had been put out there
[1:05:09] that this was of God I have just went
[1:05:14] and and had a
[1:05:15] relationship with a man who is whole
[1:05:19] stated
[1:05:20] intention is to destroy the word of God
[1:05:23] and I'm going to declare that was from
[1:05:25] God
[1:05:27] God look where it's at my brother and
[1:05:29] sister watered down
[1:05:32] Theology and it makes them feel good so
[1:05:35] they say it's from God and they
[1:05:38] believe
[1:05:42] amen once she'd been deceived by taking
[1:05:44] the word of Satan instead of the word of
[1:05:46] God she then thought that whatever she
[1:05:48] said was right if she said that she had
[1:05:51] a man uh from God then she had a man
[1:05:55] from God but God has set laws in his
[1:05:58] universe and I'll tell you I'm going to
[1:06:00] say this it's kind of strong words
[1:06:02] forgive me but I'm going to go ahead and
[1:06:04] say it there's men that come in and read
[1:06:06] into the message what they want to read
[1:06:09] into the message and they have gone
[1:06:11] around the world preaching and they
[1:06:13] believe everything that they're saying
[1:06:16] even though the message won't back it up
[1:06:18] and their Bible won't back it up but
[1:06:20] they declare it to be fact where does
[1:06:22] that Spirit come from we have it right
[1:06:25] here the prophet documenting where that
[1:06:28] Spirit come from it didn't come out of
[1:06:30] the word so there's only one other place
[1:06:32] it can come from but they believe it so
[1:06:34] strongly that they get adamant and argue
[1:06:37] and stand and and their veins just bulge
[1:06:40] over their this is it my brother and
[1:06:43] sister but it won't line up with the
[1:06:47] word sorry for
[1:06:50] venting a good seed can only bring forth
[1:06:54] good fruit
[1:06:56] an evil seed can only bring forth only
[1:06:59] evil fruit now each seed though
[1:07:02] different will utilize the same Earth
[1:07:04] nourishment moisture Sunshine but will
[1:07:06] bring forth after its own kind notice
[1:07:09] the history of the can line notice the
[1:07:12] history of the Seth line only one
[1:07:14] difference between them the Original
[1:07:16] Seed and nothing else oh that's getting
[1:07:20] close my brother and sister Original
[1:07:22] Seed is the only difference between
[1:07:24] those two lines
[1:07:26] amen hallelujah are we doing
[1:07:35] okay in this
[1:07:38] world have you ever seen someone go out
[1:07:41] in an empty weed fi filled
[1:07:46] field and put up a
[1:07:49] scarecrow there's nothing
[1:07:53] there there's thistle and puncture Vine
[1:07:56] and
[1:07:59] kosa nobody's going to go out there and
[1:08:01] put up a scarecrow in that empty field
[1:08:05] so we look at this and see natural
[1:08:06] typing spiritual amen you won't find a
[1:08:10] scarecrow unless there's something good
[1:08:14] there now I want you to look at this I
[1:08:16] find this funny you probably all know
[1:08:18] who charity Gil is right she some kind
[1:08:21] of Pentecostal I think isn't it
[1:08:23] Pentecostal whatever it is
[1:08:26] and and she sings you know and here's
[1:08:28] some guy condemning her called her a
[1:08:32] heretic for her confidence that she is a
[1:08:36] daughter of God she knows who she is she
[1:08:40] this and she that she's a herotic
[1:08:41] because all this and he finishes off by
[1:08:43] saying well she's a heretic because she
[1:08:45] she uh doesn't believe the
[1:08:47] Trinity but you go and do research about
[1:08:50] this and go back and look at the
[1:08:52] church of the people who are saying
[1:08:55] heretic heretic heretic and my brother
[1:08:57] and sisters and not one thing they're
[1:08:59] communicating is evidence that they are
[1:09:02] Sons and Daughters of God but there's
[1:09:06] we're using her for the example there's
[1:09:08] fruit
[1:09:09] here I don't want you to eat it I'll put
[1:09:13] up the
[1:09:14] Scarecrow now that's just a simple
[1:09:16] analogy I just drew out a thin air but
[1:09:20] um you look at this and you'll see today
[1:09:22] how it is that people use all kind of
[1:09:25] words I can remember back in the days
[1:09:28] when when someone would say oh you you
[1:09:30] believe that brandom uh you're in a cult
[1:09:33] and it used to shut me down I used to
[1:09:35] not not have one I didn't have one
[1:09:37] defense to to do to them and I I could
[1:09:40] Mumble words like well it's not what you
[1:09:42] think and they would go you're an Ault
[1:09:45] yeah you're an Ault then well my brother
[1:09:47] and sister I've said it across this
[1:09:49] Pulpit many times if we're in a cult
[1:09:50] it's the worst managed cult on the face
[1:09:52] of the Earth and that's a fact amen I
[1:09:55] have not showed up at your door to
[1:09:57] demand of you have
[1:10:00] I not very many people here tonight were
[1:10:02] safe amen my son-in-law and daughter are
[1:10:06] not here so certainly I'm safe but look
[1:10:09] at this my brother and sister if we are
[1:10:11] cult where's the
[1:10:13] enforcement where's the condemnation
[1:10:16] where's the the preaching and teaching
[1:10:18] that if you don't believe this you're
[1:10:20] going to hell you're lost you're doing
[1:10:22] this no my brother and sister I want the
[1:10:25] word coming from the pulpit in this
[1:10:27] church be a word that shows us
[1:10:29] encourages us gives us strength to go
[1:10:32] back to the Bible follow the word of God
[1:10:34] live the word of God and let that be our
[1:10:37] guide let the word be your guide amen
[1:10:40] not not not anything else just the word
[1:10:42] amen so there's always something you
[1:10:45] know the scarecrows go up wherever
[1:10:47] there's a promise of God to be fulfilled
[1:10:49] they put a scarecrow up of this you know
[1:10:53] if if the if the you know Oneness and
[1:10:57] and modalism and they got all these
[1:10:59] words that they throw out here about
[1:11:01] this and yet what did the prophet of God
[1:11:03] say he said over here the Trinity is not
[1:11:06] right but neither is the
[1:11:08] Oneness it's in the
[1:11:10] middle but you see they don't recognize
[1:11:13] there's a middle to them you're either
[1:11:15] this or you're this and there's more of
[1:11:18] these than there are of them so this has
[1:11:20] to be the truth my brother and sister
[1:11:23] voting with the majority is not always
[1:11:25] right amen God wants us to vote with the
[1:11:28] word amen so we find that thatth the
[1:11:33] scarecrows they don't show up where
[1:11:36] there's old dead
[1:11:39] theology you don't find
[1:11:41] people my brother and sister if there
[1:11:44] was ever a cult on Earth it was a Roman
[1:11:45] Catholic
[1:11:47] church but if there is protests against
[1:11:50] them it's a little minority that's
[1:11:53] easily overrode
[1:11:56] they use the word cult there and it's
[1:11:58] just brushed
[1:11:59] away but where the truth is preached
[1:12:03] they want to make an emphasis went off
[1:12:05] in the end the end of what the end is
[1:12:08] not here see they're talking about a
[1:12:11] man's life and trying to put a a
[1:12:13] scarecrow in front of the man's life to
[1:12:16] to keep people veering away from that
[1:12:19] but the truth of it is my brother and
[1:12:21] sister the word says In the End Amen
[1:12:24] that the word will come and Blossom
[1:12:26] forth and redeem a bride and that Bride
[1:12:29] is a response to Christ himself it's not
[1:12:33] a response to the church or what the
[1:12:35] world thinks their Revelation amen so
[1:12:38] put the Scarecrow up get people we've
[1:12:40] had visitors come to this church that
[1:12:42] literally stood in the foer and told me
[1:12:45] before this is the word of God it's the
[1:12:48] truth we'll be back and never see them
[1:12:52] again go
[1:12:53] home would
[1:12:55] brandom
[1:13:00] enter
[1:13:02] wow I'm glad I survived
[1:13:07] that I know I told them it was the most
[1:13:10] moving experience I've had in a church
[1:13:12] in 25 years but man I just barely
[1:13:16] escaped out of
[1:13:18] there
[1:13:20] why Google is a good scarecrow
[1:13:25] the devil knows how to use
[1:13:27] Google
[1:13:29] amen so old dead theology it doesn't
[1:13:32] need a scarecrow and you know the cold
[1:13:36] they don't need any scarecrow for the
[1:13:38] cold H every church is just a social
[1:13:41] thing everything I've got better things
[1:13:43] I'll Worship in nature I'll I'll do this
[1:13:46] I'll do that I'm not interested in that
[1:13:48] they just want my
[1:13:49] money you don't need a scarecrow for
[1:13:52] that the lukewarm
[1:13:56] don't need a scarecrow for
[1:13:58] them they're in church for the baseball
[1:14:02] team the basketball
[1:14:05] team the debate
[1:14:10] class they don't need a
[1:14:15] scarecrow only where the promised word
[1:14:17] is coming forth why remember the little
[1:14:20] story from last Wednesday the strawberry
[1:14:22] field they didn't need a scarecrow there
[1:14:24] if there wasn't any strawberries there
[1:14:27] but there is something that the bride
[1:14:31] wants and they want to put the Scarecrow
[1:14:34] up to keep the bride from it you see
[1:14:36] this is not about the man down the
[1:14:37] street or the pastor of that church or
[1:14:39] the pastor of that church over there my
[1:14:41] brother and sister this is spiritual
[1:14:43] warfare and those scarecrows they're
[1:14:45] anointed to put those up and tell their
[1:14:47] people now that little group down there
[1:14:49] on the corner at Midland they're they're
[1:14:51] they're in a little cult they they're
[1:14:53] deal called bromism well I want to know
[1:14:56] I hope I'm not speaking too blunt
[1:14:58] tonight are you a
[1:15:01] bromite anybody a bromite here
[1:15:06] tonight I didn't think there
[1:15:10] was we are
[1:15:12] Christians but you
[1:15:14] see I hope you don't maybe I ought to be
[1:15:17] careful about making this
[1:15:19] statement I don't go down the street and
[1:15:21] call them bapti ties
[1:15:25] or Mormon ites or Catholic
[1:15:28] ites so what do they do they throw the
[1:15:31] Scarecrow out those people are to be
[1:15:38] watched
[1:15:40] why because our wives and our daughters
[1:15:42] look
[1:15:44] holy because our men are honest truthful
[1:15:50] hardworking H as though you can't find
[1:15:54] that in the
[1:15:55] scripture as though you can't find that
[1:15:58] in the word of
[1:15:59] God but yet the
[1:16:02] Scarecrow
[1:16:03] scares remember the quote from last week
[1:16:06] all but those
[1:16:08] two and those two were out there just
[1:16:11] eaten away on strawberries all the rest
[1:16:13] of them C ca ca and screeching and
[1:16:15] chirping and whatever why you see the
[1:16:19] Scarecrow was all they could see they
[1:16:22] couldn't see a single strawberry in the
[1:16:27] field cuz if they had saw the strawberry
[1:16:30] the Nugget in the word and they were
[1:16:34] hungry they'd had to went into the word
[1:16:37] to get it but it was easier to sit on
[1:16:40] the power line and the tree branch and
[1:16:42] to say you you're wrong you're wrong
[1:16:45] you're wrong look at the Scarecrow
[1:16:47] you're wrong but there will be those
[1:16:49] this bride of Christ right this bride
[1:16:52] this word that's coming to the church
[1:16:53] and the it's becoming the bride right I
[1:16:56] just read the quote to you brother Bram
[1:16:58] says the church is becoming the bride
[1:17:00] we're talking about God's chosen church
[1:17:02] amen not denomination not even the name
[1:17:05] Grace Tabernacle it's God's chosen
[1:17:07] church is becoming the bride and they're
[1:17:09] not seeing scarecrows they're not seeing
[1:17:12] diversions and distractions they're
[1:17:14] seeing the word and the word is pulling
[1:17:16] them in and they once they take a bite
[1:17:19] imagine going down there and giving a
[1:17:21] lecture to one of those birds that's
[1:17:22] there eating those strawberries you know
[1:17:24] that tastes good right now but you'll
[1:17:26] regret it
[1:17:28] later as they eat another
[1:17:31] strawberry and another strawberry but
[1:17:34] see the word is here today even in oh I
[1:17:37] hope this doesn't hurt anybody's
[1:17:38] feelings even within the realm of the
[1:17:41] message you see little scarecrows don't
[1:17:44] bother reading the seals it'll be over
[1:17:47] your head no I've got a promise of the
[1:17:50] word that I'm rising into Heavenly
[1:17:52] places so even if there's part of the
[1:17:53] seals that's above of my head God's
[1:17:56] going to take me right up there and
[1:17:57] going to show me what this is because I
[1:17:59] am his bride I have been called and if
[1:18:02] he wrote it he wrote it for me amen what
[1:18:06] a philosophy isn't that what a what a
[1:18:08] way to look at this that if he wrote
[1:18:10] this in the message and reveal this in
[1:18:13] the message he did it for me amen he
[1:18:16] didn't do it for a theologian out there
[1:18:18] amen we've seen the Scarecrow say well
[1:18:20] just leave that to your pastor that's
[1:18:23] not for you that was for a prophet that
[1:18:25] was for the apostles that was for this
[1:18:27] my Bible says it was for me amen that he
[1:18:30] has given me the word that I can see who
[1:18:33] I am in Christ Jesus amen no scarecrow
[1:18:37] going to keep us from that one and now
[1:18:39] look at this it's only where the
[1:18:41] promised word is coming forth that you
[1:18:44] see their scarecrows
[1:18:46] Galore do you know you'd get less
[1:18:50] rebuttal if you were a Christian
[1:18:53] Science then you
[1:18:55] will if you believe the
[1:18:59] message after all Hollywood likes
[1:19:03] Christian
[1:19:04] Science but imagine pardon me for going
[1:19:08] off on this tangent
[1:19:11] imagine if what Hollywood produced lined
[1:19:15] up to the word of
[1:19:17] God nobody would watch Listen
[1:19:22] by they would have no interest at
[1:19:27] all
[1:19:28] why because they have
[1:19:33] went and taken of the
[1:19:36] fruit of the tree of the garden amen
[1:19:41] that's where they're at they're not
[1:19:43] following the word they've rejected the
[1:19:46] word and chose something
[1:19:48] different amen cuz look at
[1:19:52] this amen where the promised word is is
[1:19:54] there scarecrows all over the
[1:19:57] place good seed is still producing good
[1:20:02] seed that's the beauty of the message
[1:20:05] this is one of the things that makes me
[1:20:06] so happy is what the prophet of God said
[1:20:09] now this is what this word will produce
[1:20:11] this is the message of the hour it will
[1:20:13] produce this this and this and we are
[1:20:15] seeing it come to pass I I would just
[1:20:18] once again ask you are any of you being
[1:20:20] forced children you're not in this
[1:20:22] question
[1:20:25] are any of you being forced to serve
[1:20:27] God and I believe our children are not
[1:20:30] either so I'm not I say that kind of
[1:20:32] humorously we're not forced to serve God
[1:20:34] there's something in us that wants to
[1:20:37] serve him there's something that draws
[1:20:38] us to him and my brother and sister the
[1:20:41] world cannot understand that because to
[1:20:43] them they feel like there's an
[1:20:45] obligation but the prophet of God said
[1:20:47] this message will produce this this this
[1:20:50] and this and we are seeing it produced
[1:20:52] in this day right now without coercion
[1:20:56] without Force without bribery without
[1:20:58] whatever it is because the true word
[1:21:01] comes to the bride and she sees who she
[1:21:04] is and realizes I'm a part of this word
[1:21:07] I'm a part of the bridegroom I'm a part
[1:21:09] of the one who wrote the word and that's
[1:21:11] where I belong is in that right there
[1:21:14] it's not that I was just in there I just
[1:21:17] attended there I just did this now sorry
[1:21:20] a lot of confusing things and I I tried
[1:21:22] to sort them out but my brother and
[1:21:25] sister when you see
[1:21:27] somebody and I might preach on this here
[1:21:31] sooner or later but when you see people
[1:21:35] 41 years in the
[1:21:38] message and they wake up one day and
[1:21:41] say I've been fooled for 41
[1:21:47] years you know what the bigger shame
[1:21:52] is they acted
[1:21:55] for 41
[1:21:57] years it never was
[1:22:00] real all it took was one
[1:22:03] scarecrow to cause them to walk away
[1:22:07] from 41 years of serving God God having
[1:22:12] healed children God having healed them
[1:22:15] of cancer God having dealt with them of
[1:22:18] heart problems God having dealt with all
[1:22:20] kinds of things in their life and they
[1:22:22] could turn and say I followed a cult for
[1:22:25] 41 years maybe you did but that doesn't
[1:22:29] mean the word of God is a cult amen that
[1:22:32] means you are following some
[1:22:34] self-crafted
[1:22:36] amen I hope this making sense amen now
[1:22:41] in joov V Gyra part
[1:22:43] two I I want I just time is
[1:22:46] fleeing um brother bram's in a prayer
[1:22:49] here he says father we pray that you
[1:22:51] will take Thy word Thy word is truth and
[1:22:53] the Bible said Jesus speaking the word
[1:22:55] is a seed that a sewer sowed now we
[1:22:58] realize that if a seed is a good seed
[1:23:01] it's
[1:23:02] gerti so there's a separation of the
[1:23:05] seed a good and bad seed it's there
[1:23:08] there is life in that one seed but in a
[1:23:12] sense as the brother braham's bringing
[1:23:14] this out it's not gerti it's got a life
[1:23:16] in there you cannot take and and say
[1:23:19] that if you went over here to a uh you
[1:23:22] know a church somewhere we won't name
[1:23:24] names but you go over to a church
[1:23:25] somewhere that that there is not a
[1:23:28] lifechanging impact within that church
[1:23:31] if if you listen to what they do they'll
[1:23:33] encourage you you can do that you can
[1:23:35] overcome smoking drinking all behaviors
[1:23:38] you can do all of that but not germatize
[1:23:40] to the word see they germatize to to
[1:23:44] almost the equivalent of AA or something
[1:23:47] like that I can change myself I can
[1:23:50] think only positive thoughts every day
[1:23:51] and it will change me but not germatize
[1:23:55] to the word now realize if a seed is a
[1:23:58] good seed it's gerti and if that seed
[1:24:00] has been carried out in its plan in
[1:24:02] God's will then it leaves a gerti seed
[1:24:06] and when Jesus was on Earth he was that
[1:24:08] vine and the seed that he sowed was his
[1:24:10] word and we know that it's gerti by his
[1:24:13] own life and we know that a seed when it
[1:24:16] falls into the right kind of ground not
[1:24:19] upon rocks with no root nor in Thorns or
[1:24:22] thistles that would soon choke it but in
[1:24:25] good Rich fertile Faith every seed will
[1:24:28] bring forth of its kind and we know that
[1:24:30] every seed or promise of God will bring
[1:24:32] forth of its kind that it promised if it
[1:24:34] strikes the right ground the ground
[1:24:37] that's prepared and ready all the Rocks
[1:24:39] has been thrown out and The Roots and
[1:24:42] the bitterness and the selfishness and
[1:24:44] the indifference and jealousies had all
[1:24:47] been grubbed out that root of bitterness
[1:24:49] that Springs up that sometimes so spoils
[1:24:52] the thing that God is trying to do we
[1:24:54] pray pray God that won't be among us
[1:24:56] that the good word will find good ground
[1:24:59] in these see here is part of the good
[1:25:03] seed is a dependent where it's
[1:25:06] planted go take it in the natural you go
[1:25:09] out here and we Farm some rough and
[1:25:10] Rocky ground and you know when you plant
[1:25:13] the seed in there I could take you right
[1:25:16] now and show you corn fields and it
[1:25:18] looks like a gravel pit we're farming
[1:25:20] the edge of a gravel pit and this corn
[1:25:23] right there is a same seed if it had
[1:25:26] been planted down the hill in that other
[1:25:28] soil it'd be about 12T tall right now
[1:25:31] but as it is it's about 6 feet tall now
[1:25:34] do we blame the
[1:25:41] seed or the atmosphere it's sewed
[1:25:46] in see it's also our responsibility in
[1:25:49] Grace Tabernacle to create an
[1:25:52] atmosphere for the word the SE need to
[1:25:55] take root in we can be cold formal as a
[1:25:58] church and wonder why we have a cold
[1:26:00] formal
[1:26:01] church we can be all fanatical run jump
[1:26:04] shout scream at the top of our voice and
[1:26:07] wonder why the only thing we've got is
[1:26:10] the ability to run jump shout scream at
[1:26:14] the top of our voice but if we have that
[1:26:16] right atmosphere and we can sink that
[1:26:19] down look my brother and sister I'm not
[1:26:22] I'm not speaking one way or another but
[1:26:24] in the message right now there's a whole
[1:26:25] tug-of-war over these people are acting
[1:26:28] like Pentecostals these people over here
[1:26:30] are cold and formal these people are
[1:26:32] this and people are that my brother and
[1:26:34] sister I don't want to look at what
[1:26:36] they're doing I want to look at the
[1:26:39] atmosphere of Grace Tabernacle we don't
[1:26:42] need a scarecrow that says if we jumped
[1:26:45] up and said Hallelujah that we're some
[1:26:47] kind of Pentecostal we don't need a
[1:26:49] scarecrow that says that if we sit here
[1:26:52] and we don't have much respon wants that
[1:26:55] that we're some kind of dead formal
[1:26:57] throw that scarecrow out throw those
[1:26:59] things out that would limit us and be
[1:27:02] able to say Lord this is the word I say
[1:27:05] Amen to this word that doesn't mean you
[1:27:07] got to stand on the Pew and scream amen
[1:27:10] you can say Amen in the depths of your
[1:27:12] heart and say I believe that
[1:27:15] Lord amen you can find it in the prayer
[1:27:19] line where brother brandom's speaking to
[1:27:22] people ask him do you believe they don't
[1:27:25] nod their head they don't say yes they
[1:27:28] don't say no they don't say nothing and
[1:27:30] brother brandham says yes you believe
[1:27:32] why he was in contact with their spirit
[1:27:34] and their spirit said I
[1:27:36] believe amen they didn't run across a
[1:27:39] platform screaming and shouting leaping
[1:27:41] over the chairs but something inside of
[1:27:44] them responded to the word but we get
[1:27:46] scarecrows if I get too carried away
[1:27:49] what will the people think if I don't
[1:27:51] get carried away at all what will the
[1:27:52] people think why you care what the
[1:27:55] people think we're here to serve God
[1:27:57] Amen it's our heart our soul our spirit
[1:28:00] speaking to Jesus amen him speaking to
[1:28:03] us it's not about what that family
[1:28:05] thinks or that family thinks or how
[1:28:07] these people react have you ever noticed
[1:28:09] some families they're just well we see
[1:28:12] this a lot in South America some
[1:28:14] families I mean you can just greet them
[1:28:16] in the parking lot of the church and say
[1:28:18] God bless you and they about have a
[1:28:20] Shakedown Revival right there
[1:28:24] and others you could run over them with
[1:28:25] a boss couldn't hardly get an amen out
[1:28:28] of them but their life lines with the
[1:28:31] word
[1:28:33] perfectly the two ends of the
[1:28:36] spectrum now who's putting the Scarecrow
[1:28:38] out there we need to reject that
[1:28:42] scarecrow we need to not let that
[1:28:44] scarecrow control how we respond to the
[1:28:46] word of God how we respond to one
[1:28:50] another you know CU what happens amen
[1:28:54] if things don't work it's the message
[1:28:58] fault how many times have we seen
[1:29:02] that but you walk in the
[1:29:05] home there'd be a gentleman you would
[1:29:07] know his name connected with a lot of
[1:29:10] controversial things I'd been in his
[1:29:12] home he had more contemporary music in
[1:29:16] his home than he had
[1:29:18] message had a whole wall full of every
[1:29:22] kind of whatever but I'm sorry my
[1:29:25] brother and sister if AC DC sings
[1:29:28] Amazing Grace that is not gospel
[1:29:32] music come on are you with me amen so
[1:29:37] you look at this and realize what has
[1:29:39] happened if it doesn't work you find
[1:29:41] something to blame it on without finding
[1:29:45] why the seed never took
[1:29:51] root am I digging in too deep
[1:29:56] never once do they look at the expected
[1:29:59] place for the seed all they have to do
[1:30:01] is take this scripture and read it and
[1:30:03] realize this seed needs to go in the
[1:30:05] best soil I can find but we'll offer God
[1:30:10] second place third place fourth place
[1:30:12] you know you can break this down I won't
[1:30:13] preach it tonight but you can break this
[1:30:16] Parable down as first place in your life
[1:30:18] second place in your life third place in
[1:30:20] your life fourth place in your life and
[1:30:22] when you get all the way out in the
[1:30:23] thorn my brother and sister and every
[1:30:25] little scarecrow comes along and you
[1:30:28] believe them because when you walk out
[1:30:30] in the Thorns barefooted it hurts and
[1:30:33] you say oh this is what the message
[1:30:35] produced I'm sorry
[1:30:37] scarecrows the word will produce good
[1:30:41] fruit if we put it in the best soil of
[1:30:44] our life
[1:30:47] amen where' that seed get planted you
[1:30:51] got good seed good soil you got a good
[1:30:53] result
[1:30:55] amen now I'm going to jump
[1:30:58] over couple things
[1:31:01] here no I'm going to read this
[1:31:03] perseverance let's put that up uh always
[1:31:06] is it's the devil trying to put a
[1:31:08] scarecrow out see scare you away but
[1:31:11] remember the Scarecrow is always at the
[1:31:13] good tree just remember that not out on
[1:31:16] the old Sour Apples no it's always where
[1:31:20] good eating's at so he said Just
[1:31:23] remember
[1:31:24] now there'll be some raised up saying
[1:31:26] they're this and some saying they're
[1:31:28] that and some are saying they're so
[1:31:30] forth and claiming Messiahs and
[1:31:32] everything else but don't you believe it
[1:31:34] now the only way to be sure is take what
[1:31:37] the word says see got all these
[1:31:39] scarecrows out here interpreting amen oh
[1:31:43] this and that I I mentioned to Sister
[1:31:46] Jerry I was a little surprised some
[1:31:48] wording that was on a little flyer uh of
[1:31:51] of a minister and I was a little
[1:31:53] surprised at that
[1:31:54] but you know uh Jerry was very quick to
[1:31:57] point out to me rightfully so it was
[1:31:59] good that you know um maybe uh what
[1:32:02] they're doing fits the wording you know
[1:32:04] and and I want to be sufficiently vague
[1:32:07] there but you see if a scarecrow I I'll
[1:32:10] just put out a little a little nugget of
[1:32:12] it if someone says they're an
[1:32:16] apostle they walk into Grace Tabernacle
[1:32:18] and say I'm an
[1:32:22] apostle now are we me immmediately going
[1:32:24] to throw up all kinds of flags that what
[1:32:26] is this person or we could go back to
[1:32:29] what the prophet of God said and said
[1:32:30] you know a missionary AP Apostle setting
[1:32:33] forth
[1:32:34] establishing it's not out of
[1:32:37] line but we have
[1:32:39] scarecrows and someone says Apostle and
[1:32:43] we're immediately
[1:32:46] like whoa who's this
[1:32:49] person but you know sometimes we need to
[1:32:53] stop and and not let the Scarecrow
[1:32:55] control our thinking amen so our only
[1:32:58] way is to make sure what the word says
[1:33:01] now we're winding down here so amen now
[1:33:04] in the restoration of the brid tree
[1:33:07] brother Brown says here you know you've
[1:33:09] always put scarecrows you always put the
[1:33:11] scarecrows where the good tree is at the
[1:33:14] Devil does the same thing to scare you
[1:33:16] off of It Don't You Worry go right on in
[1:33:20] behind that scarecrow amen I remember
[1:33:24] I've said it over the pulpit here I
[1:33:26] remember the first time I ever heard the
[1:33:28] words preached about the third pole I
[1:33:30] was like where did they get that well
[1:33:34] what that really was my statement really
[1:33:36] proved my
[1:33:38] ignorance of the
[1:33:41] word right we understand the separation
[1:33:44] of ignorance and stupidity right we
[1:33:47] often say that person's ignorant we
[1:33:49] really meant to say they're
[1:33:51] stupid ignorance is a lack of
[1:33:56] knowledge stupidity is the lack of the
[1:34:00] application so you look at this and
[1:34:02] realize that when I heard the third Poll
[1:34:05] for the first time I was all just like
[1:34:08] man what is this man preaching about
[1:34:10] brother Harold hilderbrandt
[1:34:12] actually and uh what's he preaching
[1:34:15] about oh man I wrote all kinds of notes
[1:34:17] big highlights and arrows and check
[1:34:18] marks and and then I went home and
[1:34:21] looked in the message and everywhere I
[1:34:22] looked there's the third poll third
[1:34:23] third pole third pole third pole and I
[1:34:27] thought how did I miss this all the
[1:34:30] time but you see how I miss that all the
[1:34:32] time is we come
[1:34:34] out of a church or a
[1:34:36] leadership that said these things are
[1:34:39] over your head stay away from it and
[1:34:43] because we were sure it was going to
[1:34:45] hurt us we stayed
[1:34:48] away in regardless to the words on the
[1:34:50] page we never ever uh joined ourselves
[1:34:55] with those words never joined ourselves
[1:34:57] with that Revelation and therefore the
[1:34:59] Scarecrow worked but one day by God's
[1:35:02] grace the Scarecrow was taken down and
[1:35:05] it was given to us opened to us revealed
[1:35:09] to us can you say Thank You Lord amen
[1:35:13] you put the Scarecrow where the good
[1:35:15] trees is at the Devil does the same
[1:35:16] thing to scary don't worry go right on
[1:35:18] in behind that scarecrow scarecrow says
[1:35:22] brother Brown preached this a lot he
[1:35:23] didn't say the Scarecrow says but I'm
[1:35:25] saying that uh the days of Miracles are
[1:35:28] passed that's nothing but a scarecrow
[1:35:31] amen healing is for days gone by that's
[1:35:34] just a scarecrow amen that's only for
[1:35:38] the prophet that's a
[1:35:40] scarecrow amen that was for the Old
[1:35:43] Testament Church that's a scarecrow amen
[1:35:46] it's too deep for us that's a scarecrow
[1:35:50] amen God preached this word through a
[1:35:54] prophet that you and I would understand
[1:35:57] who we are and the revelation of the
[1:36:00] word the prophet if you can find I'll
[1:36:03] I'll eat the page it's on if you can
[1:36:05] find one place where the prophet of God
[1:36:07] says now this mystery is too deep for
[1:36:09] you
[1:36:11] bride I'll eat the page my brother and
[1:36:13] sister because it doesn't exist amen he
[1:36:16] come and said that the mystery would be
[1:36:19] fulfilled in that day and if it's still
[1:36:22] a mystery to you amen not to the
[1:36:24] Theologian we're not talking to the
[1:36:26] Great Men of the message we're talking
[1:36:27] to the bride of Christ the everyday
[1:36:30] individual that is the bride of Christ
[1:36:32] if it's still a mystery to you then
[1:36:35] don't give up then get in and God will
[1:36:39] show you
[1:36:41] amen hallelujah cuz the Hebrews 13 and8
[1:36:45] amen isn't that almost like a prophet's
[1:36:48] one of his themes he laid that out to us
[1:36:51] over and over and over again Jesus
[1:36:54] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:36:58] forever isn't that beautiful amen sister
[1:37:01] Ruth will you come hopefully the big
[1:37:04] gaps I left in here uh well the Lord the
[1:37:10] Lord will take that up
[1:37:13] amen Saints the real true
[1:37:17] thing don't be
[1:37:19] detoured by
[1:37:21] scarecrow hold to the the word let the
[1:37:25] word interpret to you the Life of Christ
[1:37:29] amen it was preached in this day because
[1:37:32] Malachi 4:5 doesn't say behold I sent
[1:37:37] you to a prophet Malachi 4:5 says I sent
[1:37:40] a prophet to you amen and he sent him to
[1:37:45] us that this would all be set in order
[1:37:48] and all revealed that we could come to
[1:37:51] that final awareness of exactly who we
[1:37:54] are and every scarecrow we maybe by
[1:37:58] God's grace we'll preach this in another
[1:38:00] Wednesday or something but I just love
[1:38:02] the little story given away in the next
[1:38:04] sermon but I love the little story
[1:38:05] brother Brown talking about planting the
[1:38:07] butter beans and that little the ground
[1:38:10] little groundhog guy brother Brown makes
[1:38:12] the scary little face and puts it out
[1:38:15] there in the field if you haven't read
[1:38:17] that lately find it read it it's really
[1:38:20] interesting because see that little
[1:38:23] groundhog that scary little face he knew
[1:38:27] that just beyond that scary little face
[1:38:29] that scarecrow was butter
[1:38:33] beans brother Brown talks about how that
[1:38:35] little groundhog goes up there he looks
[1:38:38] at it and jumps
[1:38:40] back he looks at it and jumps
[1:38:43] back he looks at it jumps
[1:38:46] back finally he reaches out hits it and
[1:38:51] it rattles he jumps back
[1:38:54] hits it again rattles pretty soon he
[1:38:57] just ignored it and went on and started
[1:38:59] eating butter beans now I don't want
[1:39:01] this to be too personal but sometimes in
[1:39:04] our life we see sister nauy I hope you
[1:39:07] don't mind that I would mention
[1:39:09] you that you're in the
[1:39:11] university life was in front of
[1:39:15] you and someone who is your friend share
[1:39:20] something man there must have been a lot
[1:39:22] of scarecrows
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:28] but for every
[1:39:30] scarecrow there was something
[1:39:33] inside to respond to the
[1:39:37] word and the draw of the word was
[1:39:40] greater than every
[1:39:42] scarecrow and that is the very evidence
[1:39:47] of the word manifested in our day that
[1:39:50] the call of the word is greater than the
[1:39:55] scarecrows that Satan can throw up
[1:39:57] around it and we'll find that every one
[1:40:00] of us has something of that nature in
[1:40:02] our life as teenagers there's going to
[1:40:04] be a lot of influence that's brought and
[1:40:07] scarecrows oh you you know you don't
[1:40:09] have you have a boring life you have
[1:40:10] this you have that all of these kind of
[1:40:13] things my brother and sister and the
[1:40:15] truth of it is they're all scarecrows
[1:40:18] just trying to keep us from serving God
[1:40:23] do you know I I am
[1:40:26] closing one of the greatest
[1:40:29] scarecrows that is in the world
[1:40:32] today is not about what you will
[1:40:35] get but about what you have to give
[1:40:39] up you won't be able to you can't sing
[1:40:43] you can't dance you can't this you can't
[1:40:45] that nothing but
[1:40:47] scarecrows trying to make being a
[1:40:49] Christian look like it's at the bottom
[1:40:51] of the barrel but I tell you there's
[1:40:54] something
[1:40:56] refreshing you see a
[1:40:58] Believer I don't know what age to
[1:41:04] choose cuz it actually reflects all ages
[1:41:07] so I I won't have to be
[1:41:09] specific there's just something
[1:41:11] wholesome about someone who served the
[1:41:13] Lord all the days of their life whatever
[1:41:15] age that they are something wholesome
[1:41:18] about them and then you take s Satan's
[1:41:22] counterpart
[1:41:24] whether it's 30 40 you know you the 20
[1:41:28] year olds they get out cuz natural youth
[1:41:30] makes anybody look good but you know you
[1:41:33] start getting up there late 30s you know
[1:41:35] in the 40s 50s 60s 7s and you have these
[1:41:39] people have lived for the Lord their
[1:41:40] whole life there's this wholesome
