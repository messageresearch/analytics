of you have seen already on whatsapp uh we'll be having a memorial service in melba senior center on friday at one o'clock i guess it was one to three so there should be more information on that uh as with regards to addresses and such i don't have any of that here so just pay attention to what's happening amen as we get ready to turn the service to brother paul listing number 1253 god in the valley still god in the mountain amen [Music] life is easy when you're up on the mountain [Music] but then things pay when you're down in the valley oh don't lose faith cause you're never alone for the god on the mountain is the god in the valley when things go wrong he'll make the pride and the god of the good times is still god in the bad times god of the day is the god in the night we talk of faith when we're upon the mountain [Music] [Music] but it's down in the valley [Music] temptations that's when faith [Music] of the is is the god in the valley when things go wrong he'll make them run and the god of the good time is the god in the bad times the god of the day [Music] is still gone in the valley when things go wrong oh he'll make them right and the god of the good kind is still gone in the bad times hallelujah amen aren't you just happy we serve a god like that you know when brother branham preached god's chosen place of worship you know i i just was reading in that sermon just a few days ago and you know you think about it some have mecca somehow here they're yawn they must go there to worship all we got to do is just go into the presence of god in his word amen we don't need another place to worship just in his word amen and and it just stirs my heart makes me happy you know although you know it might not be bad to have an excuse to travel halfway around the world or something you know to to do that but we realize it's not that spot many many people just reading a little deal in the past years how many people go to israel and they go to golgotha hill they go to these different sites and it's very profound because there is a great multitude that says it was a life-changing event to me and others simply refer to it as a nice visit to historical places and i'm glad our god is not historical i'm glad that we don't have to go look in a tomb we don't have to go to golgotha hill we don't have to walk those streets to have that experience happy to have my father-in-law brother kevin with us this evening god bless you and each and every one of you amen sister sophie sister grace i i intended to um send brother manasseh a text today and then the wheels fell off the wagon and i got preoccupied with other things and i i didn't but i'll do my best to do that tomorrow i want to speak to you tonight on age old proverbs and maybe a little different kind of service tonight if you don't mind just to go back i've been reading in the book of proverbs and uh reading all over the book of proverbs i i kind of tend to have a shotgun effect i guess and you know it's just my there's just so much wisdom amen i look at that and i think hey maybe go to the top of the page and we can scratch out when they thought it was preached and we can put 21st century amen put it right down to 2021 because it's just such a a beautiful portion of scripture and um so if we'll just stand we will go to the third chapter starting with the first verse and uh we'll just go down through these and then i'll take just a few minutes kind of to visit i guess the thoughts that come to me when i was reading this and then felt inspired to to speak on it proverbs the third chapter starting with the first verse my son forget not my law now i want to just put this in a context we live under the dispensation of grace we're not picking on the denominational world right phrase right now is we're no longer under the law we're under grace forgetting that jesus said i didn't come to do away with the law i come to fulfill it amen so we know that there is a place for us to hold to the law and right here in proverbs 1 my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my commandments that's the only place we're going to keep it amen the flesh cannot keep it for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck and write them upon the table of thine heart so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of god and man trust in the lord with all thy heart and lean not unto thy own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy past be not wise in thine own eyes and you know saints uh you know i like to be transparent sometimes we just have a certain thing a certain idea certain whatever and we feel like we do that so well we articulate it so well we feel like we have a better grasp than anyone around us until we don't is it amazing how god has a way of saying oh wait i got a son over here i need to humble him just a little bit amen you know and i'm going to put this figuratively right that root that you've been anointed and been led to and and been preached to and and drawn to sawing that thing out but it's always maybe tomorrow or next week or next month or next year or i'll just learn to step over that weakness god says i think it's about time he hooks his toe on that hmm i know one thing all mature christians say amen to that you know it simply is there god knows how to keep us humble amen be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil it shall be health to thy navel and morrow to thy bones honor the lord with thy substance and with the firstfruits of all thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine my son despise not the chastening of the lord neither be weary of his correction heavenly father we just ask you to come tonight and lord just ask you as we would look through this let it be an encouragement to us a reminder of the wisdom father that you have given to your children in this day father bless the word the reading of the word the presence of your saints father in our worship in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now as we would look at this saints i would like to just kind of go back through so if brother alex would take us back to uh verse 1 i want to just go back through and just kind of preach our way through this and then i have a couple other little things i want to add on the end of it but he says forget not mine law we kind of touch that but let thy and hearts keep my commandments and my brother and sister just as i've been preaching to you these last couple sundays we realize as it is the issue that balaam had was the fact that while he said one thing to the lord and kind of spoke out and let it be known around him what his motive was god knew the desire of balaam's heart and so all the rest of the fluff you might say all the rest of the story as it were was really irrelevant because the one factor that god judged it by was balaam's heart and i say that god knows you and i and i pray tonight that every one of us is our heart is focused more on god's will than our own amen because when we get focused on our own will my brother and sister we start to be lifted up as it would be in verse seven we find ourselves you know thinking that we've got an answer uh to something you know many years ago i realized it was the chastening of the lord it was god you know bringing me to a place that i would have to trust him uh many years ago we have been going along very successfully on the farm earning a good money and i i remember this is the problem saints is i know the time the place the circumstance by which i stepped you might say out of god being in control and i i declared i thought i was in control and i remember making a statement to a gentleman how you know i think we finally figured this farming thing out and uh been making good money the very next year we lost over a hundred thousand dollars just vaporized out of our life we had crops it froze in the early days of september uh totally killed crops and it turned into a seven eight year uh disaster of us constantly just trying to paddle fast enough to stay in front of the bill collectors and and the bank and etc and you know saints i share that don't worry about the money that's all behind us don't worry about the thing i i share that because i want you to see that even god will let us as sons and daughters of god we'll step out of bounds instead of letting us go see i hope you don't mind me putting it this way he let balaam go he let balaam go on to his own hearts desire but we are the bride of christ can we say amen he will not let us go so we can expect a corrective action to come into our life because he's going to put us back where we belong and so i just share that because i experience that and no it doesn't do any good to not speak the words if you think it in your mind or your heart right so i then have figured out that i am not much of a farmer without god's blessings upon my crops amen and when god blesses me he blesses me very well amen and i'm thankful for that then i realized that just one stroke of an event the earliest freeze in 30 years think that all them other farmers got hurt so god could teach me a lesson i say that kind of laughingly but i say it sincerely god wanted to teach paul a lesson so we see my brother and sister if we're looking i i always sorry my mind goes in the avenue that it goes in i'm not apologizing for that it's just sometimes hard to follow but you see i i see all through the scripture a whole business plan do you know if you're a young man and you want to start a business just start right here in this great business plan right here amen now if you think i'm a little carnal i can take you to the prophet where he says words like you know i pray god just blesses your business and blesses your commerce and these kind of things so my brother and sister let's not get hyper spiritual and trying to stay so humble because i say this my dad for years said now paul when people say they're humble they're not so let's just be honest humble right just not view ourselves any higher than we would but look at this plan now my brother and sister that we're starting to look at here we forget not god's laws in other words we put god first right seek ye first the kingdom of god all the rest of this will be added unto you so this plan if you just uh humor me for a moment this business plan is not forget the things of god not forget god's plan not forget god's way but let thine heart keep the commandments get up every day thank god for everything you got amen you know i i just saints uh it might seem silly to some people but i was doing a little bit of work and i was kind of struggling to to get something to work right and then all of a sudden boom it just works right and you know something struck me in the heart and i'm not boasting i just want to share from my heart if that's all right and something just spoke to my heart and i stopped right there and said thank you lord amen it wasn't a matter of i finally got it together to make it work i thank you lord i can struggle i can struggle i can struggle and when the lord comes and moves it works perfectly and so it's there my brother and sister for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee that don't sound like an adversary does it that doesn't sound like something put there to keep you knocked into line that sounds like something that god says you honor what i've put in place and i'm going to bless you amen with length of days long life and peace this is what my brother and sister what a remarkable difference in the world today when a great bulk of christianity views the law as behind them they're not subject to it any longer it's behind them but it was there just to bind us and we're so happy we're under grace but yet they realized while they couldn't fulfill the law even under grace they're not covered i don't say that judgmental right but you see grace is not for disgrace grace is for the redeeming factor of sons and daughters of god needing the encouragement needing the help needing that that uh filling up and leadership and god says i come right down i'll walk with you even when you're walking through the mud i'll walk with you you might have got out of my perfect will but you can walk in my permissive will and i will bring you back to the perfect will of god amen so we look at the blessings that coming he said let not mercy and truth forsake thee i tell you saints i sometimes i i feel bad i don't know how you feel about it maybe i shouldn't ask you how you feel about it but you know what i just can't constantly and i'm not going to use derogatory words but i'm telling you i just constantly feel like i'm just pounding on you take it back to the bible take it back to the bible take it back to the bible take it back to the bible amen does that get old amen you see my brother and sister because we're here to not let mercy and truth be forsaken amen that is the very pillar or platform of what the prophet's message was it wasn't my brother or sister so much to come and say now this is the mystery of this and this is that but if we never get back to the bible truth we never get down to the foundation of the bible amen all of the great mysteries revealed will just go over our head amen we're going to have that relationship with christ first amen to have any kind of relationship to build on so when we do that you know it's like the superficial marriage now my brother and sister they took this all the way to the supreme court many years ago a man and a woman getting married but have no relationship amen after a period of time in this particular case the man says um we're not married we don't have a relationship it went all the way up through the courts became a big deal my brother and sister unless a relationship is consummated come on unless that relationship becomes personal it's not a relationship amen that's why it's very important for us to to bind this about our neck amen i'm telling you now i've never been much our sisters some of you wear necklaces and whatnot uh you know when i was in high school uh we won't go back into that too far but you know it was a cool thing for all the guys wearing necklace so i i got me a little necklace and i tried wearing it and well anyway i know some of you are just cringing at that visual image but look i so wanted to be cool that i looked like a fool and i'm sorry this is just personal don't worry about it you want to wear a necklace brother but i i just have a struggle when i see a brother with a necklace i just i just feel like walking up and saying that's so pretty but i don't but you see we find ourselves in positions sometimes but god wants us to bind this around our neck my brother and sister why it means it goes everywhere we go it's there as a constant reminder now if i could just envision this uh much like a a a a tie it's there it's there and it reminds you it's there you bend over it's there you stand up it's there i see sisters often times you know just the normal things of life your sisters know what i'm talking about you'll go to move your hair and you have to put a finger in that necklace and get it separated out of your hair before you can pull your hair out so it is very much intertwined into your daily life now am i getting the point to you amen so here it is see you put this around your neck it becomes such an integrated daily part of your life now you can go back in history and find there's certain other historical things that are connected to that i want to just put it into that simple spiritual place god wanted it to be so close to you you never forgot it amen it wasn't like maybe our bible we laid it down you know whatever reminds me of brother he's a deacon in a church he told me one time he says you know you just have to wonder sometimes the way people will come and uh had this individual come to him and say you know brother i misplaced my bible the other day would is it here at the church would you know and he said yeah brother it's here at the church he said brother he said that bible been in the deacon's office for about seven or eight months but he had just misplaced it the other day you know the phraseology god doesn't want us to misplace this word right so much so bind it around thy neck and write them upon the table of the heart now i'm going to use brother trevor uh for for an example now as it is my brother and sister brother paul can't come here and decide to write upon the table of brother trevor's heart amen i i don't have that privilege even if i wanted to assert myself i don't have that privilege to tell him what to bind or write upon the table of his heart so we find that that is a very once again very personal experience that we take and hold these certain truths and those truths will lead us all i believe into the rapture but certain things would be different for you than they are for me amen maybe my childhood my upbringing would have certain events take place and when god would come and move in a certain way that is anchored deep within my heart it is carved right to the very core and for you it might be a little something different but what it is is we're coming to the place that we ourselves are submitting to the word and do not want to be set free from it there's the key we don't want to be set free from it we want to be indelibly marked by the holy ghost that it would never no matter we just sang the song tonight i really appreciated god's leadership there it don't matter if we're on the mountain or we're in the valley we will ultimately realize we've been indelibly marked by the word of god and no matter how we would view ourself and how weak we think we have become the day will come that that marking or that engraving upon the heart will once again be revealed and when that is revealed we rise right up out of the ashes as it were and we stand up and lift our hands and the devil will be saying you're a hypocrite and we'll be saying no i'm forgiven amen i'm not a hypocrite god knows my heart amen see it all comes back to that god knows my heart not what you remember i shared with you saints that just a little inspiration came that day satan's got the xerox copy of your sin but he don't have your sin so he can come along and say you did this you did this you did this you did this you did this but you can come back to him and say that is nothing but a copy my sin is under the blood of jesus christ amen and so therefore satan has nothing he can't bring an indictment to you on something that's merely hearsay so we find favor and good understanding in the sight of god and man see what what's working here my brother and sister you will find that a son or daughter of god fully serving god will find favor wherever they go in life i know that is a personal experience you will find favor i didn't say it was easy i didn't say it makes it a cakewalk but i'm telling you you can find favor in the eyes of man out here by first finding favor in the eyes of god once again if i can take you back to my experience of life there was a time in my life i thought if we farmed enough ground and made enough money i could have employees and i would be free to serve god and i jumped right into that trap and we were farming a lot of ground and we were doing things and i'll tell you what happened saints i would come from church on sunday afternoons and hardly eat lunch change my clothes and go to work to fix the problems you see but the day come oh hallelujah can i just kind of thank the lord here i hope you don't mind the day come when this disaster struck our farm and the people we worked with said you know we really want somebody else to do that work and i was like what they betrayed me but little did i know it was the hand of god coming down and took all of that away from me and uh i don't know how to put it sounds carnal forgive me our income didn't really change why i finally put a priority and god granted favor because i said no i'm putting god first i'm going to church on sunday i'm not letting this control my life i'm going to church on wednesday nights it's not controlling my life and god said i'll find favor now i'm not peddling the idea that my money is the whole sum total of finding favor with god but god knew what my situation was see so you can find favor and good understanding in the sight of god men trust in the lord with all that heart and lean not to that understanding i don't even need to preach that one do you do i you know here again every time we think we've got an answer for something god comes along and says sorry i've already covered that i've got chapter and verse amen if you'll just search for it you'll find it amen in thy in all thy ways acknowledge him now my brother and sister take that back to what i was just sharing with you sometimes it's just trying to put a bolt through something in an awkward position and you can't accomplish it and your frustration level rises i know most of you probably don't have that problem amen but you know you can lay on your back and poke your arm up through a hole and try and do something and you can't do it you can't do it you can't do it and then you stop and say lord you know i can't do this i need you to help me and you reach up there and put the bolt in now my brother and sister we can go on and say my that was lucky i'm glad that happened that worked out fine that swell or we can actually come in the petition and say lord thank you thank you for what you have done thank you that car decided not to pull out thank you lord that my child who is running to the street stopped on the sidewalk thank you lord for this and thank you lord for that it will be only regulated by our desire to give praise to god amen because if we truly want to live and live it up to lift it up to him and give praise to him my brother and sister you will find your days will be filled with tons and tons that's not a very good phrase many many many things to give him praise for hallelujah i mean when you start to focus on i want to give you praise lord for blessing my life you will find the opportunities just come flowing in now let's make sure we take advantage of those not just simply putting a blanket out here and say well praise the lord god's good lift our voice say thank you lord i love and i don't think i have time enough tonight to go in this but i love how through the book of proverbs many of these things are connected together in ways that we don't necessarily even directly see the connection in all thy ways acknowledge him by that acknowledgement he'll direct your path thank you lord praise god for what he's doing good times bad times mountain valley wherever it might be amen and he's going to come and direct our path we feel directionless maybe we're not praising him enough maybe we're not giving him the adoration the praise that he deserves now saints i'm not here to rah-rah you you do what you want with it i'm just here to preach to you what's on my heart to know that these proverbs are just as effective today as they was when they were written down all those years ago in fact i'm going to be a venturist here i'm going to venture right out on the edge of the ice and tell you i think they're more effective today than they was when they were written down because we are living in the culmination of the ages culmination of the power of god the revelation of jesus christ right a son of man revealing the son of man is not my brother and sister it is foundational but it is also the pinnacle of it because we're coming to that finishing time the grand finale of that to recognize that the word being opened in this day which we have so taken advantage of and used and it's been such a blessing to our life can we say amen is they just transformed and changed our lives but my brother and sister it is also the absolute spotlight of what god is wanting us to see in this hour amen we don't need to go back into repentance we don't need now we need repentance preached pardon me young people you know i love you i'm not trying to embarrass you but until every one of these young people is baptized filled with the holy ghost serving god we're not going to give up preaching on those things but that's not the foundation of what we believe it's not just repentance we're looking for the filling of baptism of the holy ghost which means the opening of god's word to you and i god in his word in us now opening revealing the very nature of god in us the very mind of god in us amen all of those attributes now being released into a bride that should get us more excited than it usually does that should get us to the to the place that we realize that god thinks so highly of you and i he deposited himself in you hallelujah i remember reading a deal here a while back this man he one day he checked his bank account online and it said something on the order of 2.8 million dollars in his bank account and he was just like wow that's incredible and so he goes to the bank and he just kind of slightly says something to the teller about uh would you please check my balance and the teller she just takes one of them little slips and she just writes that number on it and pushes it out to him no response he's like wow this might be my money and the next morning gets up checks his bank account again and it's thirty four dollars just the difference between a zero and a one life is that fleeting but i tell you what i've got a king for a father for a husband however you want to what wording you want to do he said i've got a cattle on a thousand hills i've got all of these things for you i've got these blessings he says you know i would turn over heaven and earth before i would break my promise to you i can count on that i get up every morning of every day of the rest of my life and check the account and that promise is right there and the result of it's right there i don't have to worry about it getting spent down i don't have to worry about having a check that won't cover amen but you know it all starts that we make sure we acknowledge him if we don't acknowledge him saints come on you know what it does it causes us to start to become callous we have saints i don't know all your individual testimonies right i mean to a very intimate degree but we around the message have seen so much of the supernatural that it's become commonplace we have seen the impossible take place and we talk about it as though it was just some common thing in the evening news you know why we've become callous we're no longer moved we need something greater we need something more there was a time when we saw our children start and praise god and praying and we we just was just overcome with emotion and now we just like well i hope my kid gets saved doesn't go the world why we're becoming callous there was a time we stayed up into the wee hours praying for one another over sickness and situation now we throw out a quick prayer and say that should cover it why we've become callous i know this isn't making us too excited tonight amen there is plenty of band-aids somewhere you see saints when we dig into these proverbs we're not just reading words of old we're reading a living word for our day a word that if we will apply it with the same that it was spoken if we let me rephrase that if we will receive it and speak it with the same anointing that was on it when it was spoken and written we will see results like we never ever thought would take place which brings us the place that sometimes we just feel like well we're message believers you know i worked in the construction field for many years and fortunately was able to cross over union lines and things like that they didn't enforce it too much but i tell you my brother and sister they never let you forget who had seniority never never never let you forget you were a young guy on a job and you were there and you were doing work and they would always do their best you find yourself running a nail gun one day and packing lumber the next because the guy that was packing lumber yesterday figured out he'd worked there longer than you so there was seniority and we start to get wise in our own eyes even around the message this might be a little rough saints i'm not trying to hurt anybody's feelings but we get a little wise around the message we start figuring out our family i've i've been in the message longer than you well i'm sorry let's go back and read the parable of the 11th hour together god has no seniority and god is no respecter of person and so when we look at this it's whether our relationship is on fire or not not how long you've been around and so and we look at that now i i don't mean disrespect anyone that's been around the message a long time but my brother and sister somebody that's just uh pardon me this sounds a little rough and i should probably shouldn't use the phrase but somebody who's old and cold doesn't have a priority that's kind of rough way to put it isn't it we don't want to become old and cold my brother and sister we want to be on fire for god amen so we want to not be wise in our own eyes we want to keep a constant fear of the lord and we want to just simply depart from evil amen don't reason the evil don't talk about dealing with it later depart from it amen and then what does he come back and he he comes right back and he puts it in this context and it shall be health to that navel and morrow to their bones you talk about he's telling us right here you'll just follow this i'm going to bless you it doesn't get any simpler than that does it amen that's just like the text i got the other day if i would say several hail marys and pass this on to 25 people i would receive a blessing in the next 24 hours so you know i i don't think this is in the same category as that honor the lord with thy substance you know i i was just i'll keep this person anonymous but i was just visiting with a brother today and we were we were talking along this line right here and uh you know honor the lord with thy substance remember the rich ruler rich young ruler comes bouncing up to jesus now this brother put it in a way that i'd never really thought about it before and i had to chuckle but he said you know he said this is just always the way i see it here come this young man full of enthusiasm he has followed every rule there is in the church and he comes a bee bopping right up to jesus and he's like hey you know what else is there for me to do have you got another checklist that i can yep done it done it done it done it done it but jesus discerned the one thing that he held in too high of favor and he said sell all thou house hit him right on the deal you know what i say lord hit me right in the hit me right in the face hit me right lord where i need to be hit if there's something there that's hindering me then lord hit that amen that's why i believe in a five-fold ministry in fact i don't have it here i don't want to make a point of it but my brother and sister i just read today where brother branham says the five-fold ministry is god's gift to you and so when he starts throwing that out we're telling god that gift wasn't good enough that's scary my i don't want to be the guy that takes god's gifts and decide whether they're good enough for me or not i want to just say lord if you send it i want to receive it amen honor the lord with thy substance see if that young man if he had just said okay lord whatever you said my look at the life he lived with the first fruits of all thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine sounds like an awesome deal sign right up for that one but look how by the leaders of what we would say is the leadership of the holy spirit the very next verse comes and puts all of that right back in balance so we're like well praise the lord i'll just do what god said to do i'll follow these things and and my barns are going to be full my presses are going to burst and he says my son despise not the chastening of the lord neither be weary of his correction oh my brother and sister just as i brought that out earlier god's got a way of bringing this bride and lining her right back we get to drifting a little bit that's why i have confidence we don't need to browbeat a church we don't need to hammer down on you get to the altar get to the altar get to the altar my brother and sister god's got his way and his time to cause those things to happen and when he starts to move on the heart of a young man or a young woman a son or daughter of god you know god is going to take that and finish that work because he promised it so we don't have to sit here and fret and fuss and fume and all these things we just preach the gospel we live the gospel amen and we get to watch these things come to pass because i'm telling you right now saints i believe this so much that i will say this in public i believe if the prophet of god stood right here tonight he would tell you you do whatever it takes have a successful life to have a good career do whatever it is just put first he wouldn't he wouldn't talk about you know you just remain ignorant you know i'll just go out here and shovel dirt so that you don't have to go no my brother and sister our children not not be afraid to go to the university because the devil's going to deceive them our children ought to go in the university saying satan get out of my way amen that's the kind of embracing the kind of environment that we should present to our church to our children that they can stand on this because these proverbs my brother and sister have power this word of god is not there just to fill up the pages of a bible these are powerful antidotal if that would be the right word you can take this what i mean by anecdotal let me back up i don't know if i use that right but you can take that and just pull that right out and apply it to me i don't have to go and say now now can this apply to me no it's god's word i'm a son of god your sons and daughters of god it applies to me amen now the only part of the bible that don't apply to you saints is the one that sends people to hell amen that don't apply to us hallelujah i thought i'd get an amen of that now look at this let me just go on here now one of my favorite scriptures revelations 19 6 7 8. i actually sorry about that brother alex i i guess i only wrote six down as i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude of voice of many waters the voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth amen now i want to make an emphasis here so just let me go ahead and pull this up on my own deal so i'm not um i already got busted my brother jason tonight i asked him about a song and he's like paul that's two songs you've put together so um i just thought maybe i should probably read this for what it is as i heard as it were the voice of great multitude in the voice of many waters as a voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor now saints am i just out here on my own or does this not parallel perfectly proverbs 3 that we were just in right there see it comes and it ties it together so this bride of this day is coming into a position she is fulfilling the words of the prophets of old the words of wisdom of old and is coming now and it's been made real to her and she's able then to realize the power contained in the word i'm telling you my brother and sister it's a it's a it's a powerful thing when you recognize not when somebody else does when not when a prophet says that the power that's in the word the preacher says but when you recognize the power that's in the word it's a life-changing event amen because the devil can't shake you there because then you can truly reach out and say it is written because you've experienced that it's not just words on a page amen i can tell you right now just reciting words from a page of your bible to the devil will not hinder the devil at all when it is a personal experience that the words of that page have come to life to you then the devil starts getting concerned because he knows something's been released and the power of that word has now been dispersed in you amen and so he then says wait this person knows this as reality not as writing but as reality i'll keep that thought to myself amen now look at this let us be glad and rejoice give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready now look at this event that is taking place my brother and sister now i want to tie if i could this evening real quick i want to tie that back to the story of the the armor uh meet and the young lady and the promise to come back for her now my brother and sister she endured a lot of harassment she actually lived in a hostile environment you know hostility does any of you worked in a hostile environment i've worked in a hostile environment in the construction trades where every day somebody mocks something about you watch out guys he's fixing to pray for his food that's right and i'll pray for you too bud after a while they shut up they didn't like having their name called out that they were going to be prayed for it it somehow embarrassed them but i'll tell you what happens if you're not careful a hostile environment causes you to be callous what is this environment out here it's not friendly it's not friendly it's hostile and what satan wants to do is get you and i to the place that we are callous to the moving of the spirit of god now when that tender breeze blowing through the mulberry bush we just ignored it has been blocked out because we've been so callous to the days that we live in the age that we live in and so satan so subtly has come and in his own way has caused us as christians to become a little bit thick-skinned really brother paul can i tell you what i'm thinking you know why i believe this saints i want you to stop and think when the last time was that you wept before the lord right i don't say this judgmentally i say this because i love you i'm concerned for you and i'm concerned for me satan causing us that not even in our prayer time or finding ourselves weeping and crying to the lord less and less and less am i right or wrong that's why i wanted to bring this to you you've got to come saints to the place we're aware that satan brother branham you can look it up brother brown talks about how the men so strong fists that were so strong they'd busted two before with their fist they would soak their hands in vinegar he said and would do these things to callous their fists now look what satan is trying to do he's trying to work in our midst of little disappointments and little things like that and instead of taking them and weeping before the lord and finding releaseness our hearts are slowly becoming calloused that we no longer i'm not preaching that we ought to run to the altar and all start just sobbing but i want you to be aware we're slowly but surely being callous to the place that when we enter into prayer we we don't even break through we're just praying i hope i haven't left you a sore spot but i want to leave a reality that if we're not careful we'll become so calloused as message believers we'll hear of a need and we'll just like oh lord bless them that's all we'll give into it you know sometimes the prophet of god would have needs and he would travail over those needs so strongly that god opened a channel that he could see every i want you to want you to follow this he could see everything associated with that need and that's how the prophet of god broke through into these situations where people had sin in their life and had circumstances and god wanted them delivered more right and doesn't what the prophet of god taught us he wants to heal us more than we want to be healed amen i believe we can apply that principle right across the board he wants to deliver them or deliver us more than we want to be delivered and the prophet of god would be in such travail for these people that god would let him get beyond the veil and see what was holding back their healing or their deliverance god help us god help me i'm preaching to myself tonight saints see his wife has made herself ready that young woman she was there they harassed her they heckled her but you know what didn't happen to her she didn't become callous because in becoming callous she would have determined it probably doesn't matter or not whether she has that wedding dress ready it doesn't matter or not that her attitude is good just as long as she gets out of here well my brother and sister the rapture is not an escape i want to drive that home to you the rapture is not an escape we are not here waiting for the rapture so we can just get out of this miserable mess we are here looking to the rapture because it is the culmination of a love affair culmination of a relationship and we are here saying lord i want to culminate this relationship i want to see the finale of this i don't i can't wait any longer to be in your presence because you see if we start to look at the rapture as an escape my brother and sister you will become possessed with the escape mentality you'll want to escape from your personal problems and the church problems and the family problems and the children problems we're not called to escape from it we're called to overcome it amen now god gives deliverance my brother and sister but don't mistake that deliverance as somebody coming in and solving it for you that deliverance is god's promise that you can take his word and conquer whatever situation that is hallelujah by the holy ghost oh my let me hurry along here oh my now i want to tell you right off the bat here there's two different influences here preached just a little ways apart so sign oh the sign of his coming is at hand and we know there is not a thing on earth science tells us it's three minutes till midnight told us that several years ago then we must be just about maybe a moment from midnight we don't know what time the the powder is going to lighten the keg look at this election coming up here tomorrow [Music] that's all it would take this light one my brother and sister we're seeing unprecedented times we're seeing the ones on the left doing things and the ones on the right doing things and the other saying you're evil we're good when the truth of it is it's all evil when the truth of it is there is corruption rooted to the very bottom all the way through it amen now i'm not going to make something out of this unless god would reveal it but a brother did send out a picture showing kamala harris at her inauguration today and she's dressed in purple you can go right in the message and see the prophet of god says now we're not making her that but i'm telling you there's all kinds of signs to get our attention we're not going to just grab that and go running off through the woods screaming but i'm telling you we're seeing signs like never before amen we're seeing signs saints now i i don't fault anyone who got some kind of stimulus type thing you know what i mean don't don't misunderstand me but we're living in a day i was going to bring you quotes tonight and i thought my i'm going to be too long anyway we're living in a day my brother and sister the united states just doubled its national debt in four years it's in the trillions upon trillions and they want to do bailouts right now that are in the trillions and the profit of god says wait they're already bankrupt living on taxes that won't be collected for 40 years that means they just barely paid those you see what's happening just another sign of the time now if you've got a stimulus check your account amen pray over the thing just in case they sent a spirit with it and go on because prophecy says it's bankrupt already so you taking your stimulus check is not contributing to something that's already done amen in fact i heard a brother say oh don't worry about that that's just taking money from the devil but we just don't he meant that positive look at the election coming up here tomorrow that's all it would take just light one when that radar screen picks up that atomic bomb every one of them is going to turn loose but the church will be gone before that time so if that could happen any minute and the church has to go before that happen how far off a twist of those words how far is it off amen so think about that my brother and sister and the very things that he said would happen and his ministry would take place in the last days we watch it night after night day after day saying the time is at hand oh we ought to humble ourselves and get in humility and get into action that's right word fulfilled should put us all in action we believe the third pool come pass i mean it's it's right in the word the prophet of god he speaks of this amen the third poll is the opening of the word the word is open hallelujah furthermore the prophet of god ties it right back and says when that third poll comes to pass that the seventh seal is open amen so we either have a closed book or we have an open book and i'll tell you i'm not going to sit here and say oh the book must be closed i'm here believing i've saw the supernatural we have saw oh my i won't even go into that tonight uh my brother and sister we just got to see the supernatural amen we've got to see the word the word discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart we saw that saints i have i'm not saying this boastfully but i have saw the absolute discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart in regular church services see how god would come and cause a man to walk down an aisle and stop right by a pew of people you don't even know and speak the very words that has bound that man's soul and see him jump to his feet and scream and claim his victory amen my brother and sister you know the man that was preaching there ain't nothing special about him he's not super spiritual he's not super whatever it's god who's mindful of his people amen and we've saw god come and discern the very thoughts and the intents where a man would stand up and scream that's nothing but the truth god help me and god deliver him of that spirit hallelujah nobody's going to tell me there's something missing oh what a cursed thing that would be when a man tries to point out to a fellow that you're in the wrong and prove it to him by the word of god you're in the wrong now remember the prophet of god is not talking about opinion here and then the man because that he feels in himself he'll do what he wants to won't submit to the word and then see what happens prophet of god put it right down here in the right order when that happens then they get angry amen you notice what happened to the king leprosy broke out in his face while he was still in his anger leprosy struck uzziah in the face and the priests and those recognized and threw him out of the temple and he died a leper that great life that started out so well ended up to be a leper and cast out and had to live in a separate house out to himself all the days of his life the man that the life that god once influenced amen sister emmy would you come i say this respects we got men today on the field young men middle aged men and old men who started out on good run and tried and made good showing to god but we find them today out yonder alcoholics and broke up out there in the other away from us some of them backslid all together some of them have went money crazy some have went women crazy and married other women that wasn't their wives and all the things and disgrace that's been brought on every denomination we one can't call the other bad because we're all guilty the whole or even the denomination we found men like that that's once been influenced by god and had great influence on the to the people and yet when they felt self-sufficient [Music] when we suddenly thought i want to tie this right back to you in my thoughts so you'll understand why i use the analogy when we suddenly thought we knew how to farm when we suddenly fought we knew how to govern the house of god we no longer needed to pray through concerning that leadership we just knew we become self-sufficient when a man gets a place where he can influence for god he ought to humble himself all the time constantly let that be our prayer saints humble ourself before the lord to be able to just lift our hearts and i want to drive this point home to you tonight if you have come to the place where you no longer weep before the lord [Music] i just ask you stop and just ask the lord to soften your heart tenderize us once again bring us let the word come and wash over us again and again and again lord until we're soft again there's nothing to be ashamed of we don't need oh i i'm a veteran in the message i don't need to cry we're not talking about church and playing church we're not talking about what the people on that pew think of the people on that view we're thinking my brother and sister about god we're thinking about giving praise and glory and worship to our god and i say lord let our hearts be tenderized let us be so soft my brother and sister i'm not talking the human emotion i'm talking about when the spirit of god moves that we just so submit and yield into that that you just release yourself and say oh lord i love you so much your grace and your mercy lord is so sufficient because without it i would be nothing i would be lost just keep ourselves humble all the time to be able just to give all that we can give to the lord and i say this saints in a in a different way but so that you would understand [Music] the song says the more that i surrender myself the more he takes control let's just surrender ourselves let's get over the callous nature of laodicea and get back to what it was when we first come to the lord when when our hearts were so tender that just the moving just the sweeping of the holy spirit through the church would put tears in our eyes and i don't say that from the emotional side i'm talking about from the stirring in the heart and the soul it would just bring us to that condition i just felt led tonight to call attention to this this way i stand here as i said already saints i i stand bare before you it's so easy to become callous [Music] so easy to become jaded as it were [Music] it's actually hard to be tenderized before god the spirit of this age my brother and sister is actually easier to become callous than it is to be tender let's be tender before the lord hallelujah [Music] brother jay [Music] sister emmy what are you playing [Music] you know that song brother jay [Music] let's just stand saints let's take a moment here we won't be much longer just take a moment if this touched your heart tonight i'm not much of a altar call guy so i'm not making an altar call right where you're at if this touched your heart tonight you realize you know i might be just getting a little callous i i just ask you just lift your hand your heart to the lord and say lord just tenderize me wash me lord with your holy spirit yes lord soften my heart lord just even the nudging of your holy spirit i [Music] i would sense it i respond to it lord for the needs of the saints for the prayers of the saints for our young people for those that would be sick amongst us lord let us just find father just find that unction lord oh hell oh hallelujah help us lord jesus soften our hearts soften our soul our spirit lord oh lord nothing to be boastful lord father help us lord oh callous spirits lord just we put them subject to your word tonight lord we bind them in the name of jesus christ lord may each and every one of us father just find ourselves once again tender in spirit o yearning for the moving of your holy spirit yearning for the breeze the slightest movement in the mulberry bush to know that you're present with your children lord moving in our midst making us ready father your your wife lord the lamb's wife hath made herself ready lord oh father you didn't marry a cows christian lord you married a tender christian oh father i we love you lord oh

glorious church not for temporary [Music] let your mighty rushing wind touch your people once again touch your people once we pray let your kingdom shine upon this world through your living glorious church not for but to temporary authority and power let your mighty rushing wind glowing touch your people once again [Music] lord i just commit this time this service father i pray tonight lord the people would understand my heart lord [Music] yes oh lord i believe i'm worshiping you lord with the salt of this earth lord with the very chosen of the bride of christ lord we just ask you to come
