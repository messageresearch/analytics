you come to hear from him you can't be disappointed amen praise the Lord amen amen that's an expectation we can come to receive and know that he's provided that amen amen if Satan's bothering you comes to bother you just take your faith and lock swords with him who's going to win God's faith always wins you lock swords with him it's your swords pointed at his heart amen his sword is pointed at you but he has nothing he can do he cannot destroy the seed of God he cannot destroy the germ of God the seed Gene of God Amen let's stand together this morning God or excuse me good morning Sun's Up

people listening that we probably don't know are listening but God bless you also you're going to we come to receive the word we come to re hear the word we come to be the word made manifest amen amen amen let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer our heavenly father Our Father Heaven come down the word has come down and opened unsealed our heart and you've unveiled yourself what a glorious Revelation and view this is and heavenly father I just pray that you would Minister to us through Thy word strengthen us through Thy word for Thy word is is our strength your word is our rest and Lord it's our Victory and we've come here to gain strength and go out of here raised to a higher plane because of your promise where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them and Lord we have a great expectation from thee tonight to receive what we should have individually and For Your Glory in the name of Jesus Christ the King of Kings the Lord of lords who is present here now that all the gates of hell are against and that revelation of Christ being here now we thank you for this Revelation in Jesus name amen amen amen turn with me in your Bibles to First Corinthians I have several scriptures here but we'll read them as we the Lord leads I want to title this when that which is perfect is come and my subject is hear ye him when that which is which when that which is perfect is come we'll find this in our scripture reading the first one here hear ye him who are who are we talking about him the seed Gene germ of God in the form of the Bride amen not another him it's him not another in the form of his bride that's the message of the hour it's himself yes amen he had to fulfill the promise in order for us to step back into Eden he had to unveil himself in Bride form amen 1 Corinthians 13 and I like to begin verse 10 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child and I thought as a child but when I grew up and matured yeah and become what I was intended to be purpose to be a man I put away childish things amen amen I'm glad God gave us a a book of promises a book of the word a promise precious promises amen that we can grow up in and by Amen to our stature amen verse 11 verse 12 for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face face to face when you grow up you be become what you what God intended for you to be then face to face now I know in part but then shall that then when then when when the perfect has come yeah amen and we this message is the perfect interpretation of the word by Divine Vindication amen hallelujah that's exactly right amen for I then face to face and brother Brandon when he said that he turned right to this scripture he said for when that which is perfect is come then that which is imp part is done away so we're not getting a message of in part we have the full Revelation to go home and a bride rde Rapture amen and into the Millennium and out of the Millennium into the new heavens and new earth yes amen amen that's amen that's the truth God has taken us all way through the scripture into Revelation and by the message of the seventh angel has unveiled himself perfectly for us that have ear to hear amen amen but then face to face and I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known so what's unsealed here to show you what God saw you to be amen God bless you you can be seated I'd like you to turn with me to Matthew 17 and just keep this in mind Psalm 62 said God Is My Rock God is my Revelation I want to say that again God is my Revelation amen God is my brother David you're bragging I'm bragging if I want to brag I'll brag on him because he's he's unveiled this to me that he himself is my Revelation am all right now in Matthew 17 and after six verse one after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John he didn't choose all of them he took a his elect he took those that he was he chose out amen I don't want to get caught up too much on these things I just I want to get through this if the Lord he'll help me Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment as white as the light and behold there appeared unto him unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias now this is what I want to get to verse 5 and while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him amen then I'd like to go to John 13 read this every time we have communion foot washing but verse three well I'll just read some far from one now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour has was come I want to just stop there a minute and go back to chapter 12 and just read something I didn't intend to do this but the Lord laid it my heart here verse 27 let's start with verse 26 If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there also shall my servant be where I am you'll be if any man serve me let he serve me him will my father honor now my now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father this want to get to Father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour father glorify thy name then there came a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again all right then I want to go over here to to back to our verse again and supper being ended excuse me I'll back up here Jesus knew that the hour was come that he should depart out of this world into the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil now put into heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing here's what I want to emphasize Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God Amen Isaiah 531 very familiar scriptures I believe I believe the word ought to become familiar very familiar to us amen verse one who hath believed our report how Brother David sounds like you're putting yourself back in St John 13:3 I am the bride is there the bride is there let's read that and Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands where were you at this time where were you see and knowing that the father had given all things if I give if he was given all things into his hands what about his bride all right and that he was come from God what about you if he came from God where were you you had to come from God if he came from God you came from God you can't separate that bride from him she is his attribute she is the thinking of himself and that thought of himself was substance amen Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and he went to God all right you have no fear bride who hath believed our report our report yes amen and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed well he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith that's who hears the report all right Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come the word bride brother brandham said there's another people in the land and he called this people the word bride who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age hear ye him amen what what voice do they have his where is he in her all right 1 John 4 this is pretty simple but it needs to be revealed first 1 John 4 very familiar scripture again 1 John 4:4 you are of God who's he speaking to here would it be you it said ye would that be you you are of God little children and have overcome them have not you're going to you have and you will you're going to but you have yes so what are you what are we doing we're fulfilling scripture the word said you have then we have we're going to go out there through suffering tests and trials to prove this promise right here is going to be proved you have overcome them who's them Antichrist Spirit yeah you have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world right brother Brandon in the message greater is he that is in you or he's titled it he that is in you then if he said who is he that is in you it is Christ the anointed word he said then if he is in you it's not you anymore living right boy what a what a release what a release is that then quit looking at your mistakes and failures it's not you anymore living then who's living it's him well you say well you say am I dead yes I am but I've raised again what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is in me right now to be raised and pass from Death unto life death will never touch this Resurrection can't right you're loosed there's now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen all right who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there is no condemnation well you see I make so many mistakes quit looking at your mistakes and recognize who you are amen because who you are does not make mistakes hello I'm coming down to this I'm I'm talking about when that which is perfect is come amen that perfect can't make mistakes now listen to this here's a song that my that Tim Tim and I Father Dad brother Bob wrote and in that song he said that perfect one is not the me you see but that perfect one Within Me is the real me I just want you to chew on that that's right I want you to chew on this this is Victory the perfect one is not the the me you see the me you see is David has mistakes he's UPS he's fails he does this he does that God is not looking at any of that he's looking through the blood which has been has identified you which is an effect which is in you living right he can't he can't look at through the blood and see you imperfect when he looks through the blood he sees you perfect than you Lord amen amen when you're born again truly baptized with the Holy Ghost which means the word the Holy Ghost has fell Upon A SE Gene of God that's the true baptism amen that's the real birth word you are sealed to the day of your Redemption amen it's Christ's birth in you it's a the new birth is a spoken word birth amen it's a spoken word birth all right we'll come into that a little more as we go along here but just keep that in mind but that perfect one Within Me is the real me it's not the me you see but it's the real me that perfect one there's only one perfect one that's Jesus Christ but he said be ye therefore perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect now how you going to be perfect without the shedding of his life which you are was poured out through through the blood at Calvary hallelujah amen you don't you don't have to well I won't go this I'll just keep moving on this direction so St John 4 let's read verse 5 they are of the world therefore who's of the world them you have overcome them they are of the world therefore speak they of the world see they have a voice they have a they have a tongue but we speak another tongue and the only ones going to hear this tongue is those elected of God to hear that tongue that were a part of God will hear the voice of God for they have that ear to hear and that faith that they live by and who they are comes through the word amen by hearing the word all right so they are of the world therefore speak they of the world if you see a person coming around here I'm a messy believer praise God I I believe God sent a prophet I believe this message and still speaking of the world and they're not only their word speaking they life speaking speaking of the world you know they're not of God they haven't been born again Hallelujah they so they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them all right see that's their nature all right but you're not that nature you are of God verse six you are of God he he that knoweth and if you're of God who are you right you must be himself in measure in this hour predestinated this hour to take the position in this hour for the word of the hour to manifest that word of this day of this hour what a position what a revelation what an unveiling you see he's taking the seal off your heart and he's unveiled himself in you you absolutely are perfect in Christ amen you can't be otherwise you're going to be there you're going to you're going to come to that maturity you're going to come to that stature which is Christ your stature is Christ amen the what you grow up into the statue you grow up into is is Christ The Headstone it's Christ amen and who is that Christ it's charity which never fails right Lord willing will he time I'm going to preach on two kinds of love now brother Chris stay away from it I can't tell the pastor to because he has a right to do that but how close are they they would deceive the very elect if possible I'm not saying God's a deceiver I'm just saying they're so close those two Spirits are so close one is human love and the other is God himself but human Love Never Fails I mean human love will fail excuse me human love fails because it's not it's let's see I'm getting sidetracked here but anyway and then I'm not because I'm talking about something here that I want to come to Agape Love Is God himself yes and you have to be of God you have to be a part of God to have be God himself to be that love without the new birth you won't you don't have that love you can love God with an ailio human love you bet you can amen but unless that word's down in there to be quickened in your soul which is the true baptism of the Holy Spirit you can be anointed and love God from your spirit that a spirit can be anointed and do signs Miracles and wonders cast out devils and Only God Can cast out a devil you can speak in tongues and have the gifts of the Spirit according to 1 Corinthians 12 but it's not the sign that you are the have the indwelling of the word in you it is the sign that the Holy Ghost is doing those things but it's not the sign of the individual having that's right the person himself in them amen see how close these anointed ones can be to the real anointed word but they can't stay with the word they can't hear and receive the word for the hour because it's revealed to them that have an ear to hear and that's the sovereignty of God to reveal to whom he will amen you can't figure it out I cannot explain to you how that I am in Christ so but Christ in you he that is in you he that is in you is overcome the world he that is in you is greater than the world he that is in you and if he's in you then it's not anymore you living it's him living in you then you'll speak the words he speaks you do the things he does and if it even starts to get off the track he'll correct it amen and you will receive the correction of the word because that which is in you that c Gene that germ of God cannot disbelieve the word amen they cannot reject the word no more than God could reject his word because it's God in you made living alive in you all right so we grow up into him we grow up into him okay I didn't finish verse six we are of God he that knoweth God heareth him yeah us is that right us hear ye him this bride I am pleased to dwell in hear ye himen hear ye me he would say hear me amen amen and amen all right now so we grow up into him which is our stature our stature is Christ when you're born again it's Christ birthed in you and he grows up into his stature amen and The Headstone The Headstone message the Capstone message is our message it's the opening of those Seven Seals right which unless they open you couldn't have matured right into him now when you mature into him and grow up into him you're you're getting ready for the capturing away and the meeting in the air I wonder what I wonder what Rebecca was doing on that Camel that she watered on that road to meet her bridegroom in the meeting place in the air Amen in that divided place what was she doing she was laying in the presence of the son she was receiving the message of himself her bridegroom amen and she got to that place where the meeting had to take place and she had matured so so he brother Brown said he's waiting on his bride and maturity so he can come and take her and this is an individual affair this that we believe is not a group Affair it is an individual Affair the saving of Israel is a national Affair but to us it's individual he takes the people out of the Gentiles individuals out of the Gentiles for his bride amen so it's not a church Affair I believe in going to church don't get me wrong when I say that but it's not a group Church Affair it is individuals amen they're in the group they're part of the group we believe that we break bread together because we're born again we're breaking bread together at this communion table amen testifying that we are in communion with him and we are one with each other being a part of his body being his body amen all right now we have been born of God and we grow up because we are him all right now we could go to well let's go over there Ephesians a minute Ephesians 4 for the this is what the ministry is for verse 12 five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the the ministry for the edifying that tell me don't believe in fivefold Ministry they might as well just shut their pages of their books of the message and go home right because we have a Ministry which was the word for the season it was in the scriptures but it was hid it was sealed up our message is the opening of those Seven Seals amen the prophet of Revelations 10 and Malachi 4 does two things amen he takes those those those things that have been lost Through the Ages and brings them to Restoration such as serpent seed baptism godhead Etc is that right then he turns around and then he opens up the Mysteries contained in those seals amen which the seven Thunders uttered which is the Revelation contained in the seals which will literally these things will literally turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers is that right original Faith which was what God's Own Faith oh man that's right now so he said now the work of the ministry till we all come in the unity of the Faith Unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man that is not human stature right that is Christ and the believer the believer is the faith of God that moves in you so we've come into Unity of the faith of the knowledge of the son of Unto unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more here we are children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive now we could take some scriptures on what Paul said about that couldn't we we know that after my departing so Grievous wolves come in see all right so we expect it it's here it's there but that's why we have the message through god-given gift of God in the ministry to preach it to the bride so that those te- cells aren't stopped from flowing through the body what are they for cleansing because if they aren't in effect if those T cells are in effect those B cells which are the which are the uh the antibodies will never go into effect without the ministering of the word as God said it would be preached they will this message will never be effective to those people boy oh boy oh boy sir amen that's the truth all right you may not like the way I preach it you may not like the way brother Paul or brother Chris or other preachers preach it but let's base it with the word or not let's go back and see what he said yes amen it isn't whether we preach well it's what are you hearing yeah all right now so we go to Second Peter no I didn't finish that did I well okay verse 15 here's it is but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head amen the intelligence which is the head even Christ all right now second Peter verse two Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain unto life and godliness godliness great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest in the flesh but here he's given all things that pertain unto life and the manifestation of God in flesh in you through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature God's Own having escaped already having already escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so lay in the presence of the word lay in the presence of the message lay in the presence of the scriptures and grow mature amen not just on Sunday not just on Wednesday but through the week every day feed on the opened word amen all right I'll tell you if the Holy Ghost is in you you can't stay away from it you've got to have it it means more than the necessary meat your jobs or anything else amen let everything else go secondarily this is first place and if there's something else that takes that place it's an idolatrous spirit amen that would take the first first place over your worship and your admiration of Christ himself having the first place job's family comes second amen you are last all right I'm glad I got a little amen out of it anyway all right he said this is paragraph 307 of invisible Union that's my message to you Church you that's a union spiritual union by the word that you're dead to these old husbands amen you're born a new don't try to dig him up he's dead yeah what's dead mean eternally separated yeah then don't try to dig him up and don't put him on the wall for a future time when you can go pick him up again leave him dead you are a new creature you are a new race you are a new race creature Christ in you I'm coming to something here so just hold on I'm on page one yet if you're if you he said he's dead if you're a born again Christian now watch this carefully here I'm coming if you're a born again Christian that little germ that was predestinated to you it's word coming on word it's word coming on word on word coming on word on Word a and come and comes into full stature of Christ that's right so he can come get his bride so he can come get his bride the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Spirit put his sword into the hand of a prophet amen the King sword and and and him himself revealing himself as the lamb poured himself gave it into the hands of the seventh angel to bring the message of himself to you the unveiling of himself knowing that you would come to yourself so he withheld it from the devil all these years he kept it hid he wouldn't let it out until the time it was to let it out and the Holy Ghost then by the opening of the word opened book took and and and made claim on what he redeemed I wonder I wonder if if the if you've been claimed and he's got to claim them the Holy Ghost has got to claim them in order for him Christ Our Cal the calvary man you'd call him or our savior that died died on the cross for us to meet him in the air we have to be claimed in order for him to claim us amen now that sounds a little strange but notice it's not it's not him in that form here coming to us it's the Holy Spirit that's come to us poured put himself in the hands of his Prophet revealed himself as lamb right there he said he's standing in the platform with the book in his hand opening the book amen that wasn't William Bram the man that was the lamb but how did he do it just like he always would do it before he would do anything he had to send what he would do through the through a prophet I the Lord will do nothing but I reveal my secrets to my servants the prophets so he put his own sword stepped down took possession amen of what he Redeemed by opening that little book that had your name and my name in it amen and what was my name in your name was his name amen and he come to redeem what was his What a Beautiful Love Story what a beautiful time that we are in right now and we see we see judgment striking the West Coast it's already progressing progressing progressing and it'll move right into the full of the sick seal but we're not going to be here those birth pains are getting pretty close amen what is it going to birth it's got to birth us out of here he's got to turn to 144,000 amen and they receive the message of himself sealing them they turned him down they would he blinded them purposely God blinded his own people that we could come in Praise the Lord yes amen and now in our day the people are blind to what's happening and now he's about ready to turn and go right back to Israel again amen there you are take his little bride out of here all right now I'm sidetracked a little bit let me get back so that little germ that was pred destinated you it's word coming on word it's word coming on word it's word coming on word it's coming on word and comes into full statue of Christ that's right so he can come and get his bride now we're ready for one thing that's the coming of the Lord amen amen what's he talking about the meeting in the air yeah Amen to claim what he's redeemed all right now 1 Timothy 3:16 and I've just read that great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh so we'll buy that by test a minute we you and me are the word the bride is the word because he was the word because he is the word he was the word First St John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God notice he was the word that's why we are the Worden all right John 113 said well let's just I'll just turn over there I know 114 let me just get that John 1 13 we excuse me verse 12 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but by the word yes they were born of the word but of God Amen and the and is conjunction ties with that and great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh all right and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us among us us us the and the and would dwelt among us and we behold or beheld his glory we beheld they beheld his glory now we are beholding his glory and I'm not here by chance I'm here because I was meant to be here Jesus said I didn't come here by chance I've come here because I was I was to be here at this day you were to be here at this day I'm going back to St John 12 you can read it all right I just read it amen now so 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth he will not share his glory with another but you and I are not another we are him right yes amen and the Bible says his glory would be on us and would be seen in US amen Isaiah 60 verse1 all right now we are who we who excuse me who are we we are the spoken word birthed we are the spoken word birthed bearing his name we are not here brother sister to Bear our own name you and I are here to bear his name and this we will do absolutely and this is being being done but it's so simple people are missing his presence exactly what it is that's an unrecognized presence of God but he's here and all Hells against this Revelation to you as an individual that's right he's he's against he's against the word he's against you because you're the word the battle isn't between Satan and the flesh the battle is between Satan and who you are the battle is between Satan and the word of God it happens to be in the Warfare on a property called the Battleground and you have that Battleground so be careful what you hear and what you're listening to because when you conceive in your mind your mind either lets in or lets out when you conceive it in your mind it'll manifest don't let it conceive in the in the bedding ground of your mind in the womb of your mind but thank God for the power of the Holy Ghost In You Amen to protect that mind and awaken you when the enemy comes around remember what brother Bram said I was just quoting at brother tonight brother Bram said can I overcome he said it's to know the devil he said is to know the devil in every one of his tricks right now how when we grow up we should be knowing the devil in his tricks is that right then to know the devil and every one of his tricks and he said that he that is in you has already overcome him now so where is the word of God nigh thee it's even in thy mouth what is that word it's the word of faith you say confess but if you don't believe what you're confessing it's not to do you no good right you've got to believe from your heart what you're saying amen that's true confession because he is the high priest of your confession Jesus could do nothing until it was revealed to him amen and the Revelation is Faith so we have so the Bible says hold fast the confession of our your faith and it's your faith our faith that the world is overcome by what is it that overcometh the world this is the victory that overcometh the world even our Revelation faith amen amen amen all right now so you are bearing his son it's a spiritual seed the promised seed son the bride is in an a spiritual union with her husband brother branam said bearing an eternal son did you know he said that go back to the mystery of God revealed this is not the Eternal son but that word in me that's going to that has a body waiting is that body waiting is an eternal son that's right and what makes me a son here is because the indwelling of his holy spirit in me this is the mask that masked him yes and when we talk about hear ye him he's not talking about hear ye David he's just the mask he amorph is in The Mask it's hear ye him speaking through that mask and today he is mask in the bride form amen what is this bride form what is he doing it's his coming in the bride form amen the bride coming of Christ Christ coming out of dark denominationalism what a resurrection this is you're not going to turn back to those begal elements you're not turning back to that you're going forward in step with the word marching out of here you are on your way out Hallelujah all right so you're in a spiritual union with your husband and you're no longer Twain but one that's a direct Prophet statement more than one time he said you're no more Twain you are one because this Union this marriage is come amen all right and it's the revealing of himself in you the son of man revealing himself that unite the two together amen we're going to a wedding supper we have to have that wedding that marriage that Union spiritually first before we can come together in Union physically next I'm not talking about don't get in your mind what I'm saying wrong I'm talking about meeting your loved one meeting meeting your bride meeting his body meeting the head physically and be United because what you had in this reality of Revelation has to fully come to manifestation is that right but to you it's just as real as I am standing here because it's the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen amen amen all right so the newspap papers packet magazines packet show the pictures of it show the pictures of what same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel same Pillar of Fire that met Paul same Pillar of Fire amen he's having his picture taken all right now and see those great Mysteries hidden in the Bible open to us on a new field that we never know before right and perfectly Blends in to to the coming of the Lord Jesus you see where we're at yes all right now watch the action at the end of the message see the actions of the great Holy Spirit see him come down visible before the people even taken pictures of it just like he said see it working and showing that he's not a man it's not a preacher it's not a certain congregation it is the holy spirit showing the same things it did when it was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ now it's embodied it's it's embodied it's embodied in the body of his bride it should throw us into desperation but he said the reason there's a lack of it is the the reason is it's a lack of love for the message the word the Bible the scriptures yeah when we see this thing happening you should be saying Lord don't leave it here search me search me continue to cut me cut me cut everything out of me just cut everything unlike you out that's right that should be the prayer and the desire of our hearts daily let me die to myself deny myself take up my cross and follow you amen don't let me get so busy that I'm so busy that busyness becomes an idol amen that's right and you husbands just pray that the Lord will encourage you in the way to control your homes and discourage you in the way it isn't right and to a pastor or to the ministry in the church encourage Us in the way we should be directing this assembly amen is that right and discourage Us in the way that isn't right let it be the word that is the headship of any assembly of any people if we don't come under word headship it's wrong it's not him and if it's not him who is it it's she yeah and that's that dominating female Spirit that's trying to worm its way right here even in this congregation and it will in every congregation but the bride is steadied on this word so stay in it walk in it live in it keep walking with him that's the word you say well I might lose my status I might lose this I might lose that then you have an idol that takes the place of him he should be your absolute your ultimate your head as he leads you follow and where he is you'll be there amen amen God help us all I'm not building myself up before you I need him probably worse than anybody here but I know that what he's revealed is mine amen whatever reveals to you is yours it's your property then quit living under your privilege just hear ye him all right now then then what does this mean our headship is a kingdom I've got to hurry our headship is a kingdom and the kingdom of God is within you so you're headship is this your headship is is the word of God made spirit and life in your own life bringing to promise bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word in God was one and the word in God is one in his church today amen making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day making it the headship of the body the body is to bring the message in the last day what's our status what are we here for that's to bear his name and everything that goes with that all right now all right and be and to to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead and the Resurrection go back and restore again as and back and restored again as Adam and Eve in the beginning of the Garden of Eden there's your three-fold mystery of God what is the three-fold mystery of God his body that's exactly what it is all that God was he poured into Christ his body all that Christ was he poured into his body and what's that for our coming back into Millennium back to an Eden it's restored again what is the where's the three-fold purpose in in the body Christ Christ is the mystery of God revealed and all that that mystery of God revealed was poured into you making you the complete revelation of that mystery complete is the seven seal there's the seventh seal unveiled Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of himself then where are we at we're at the end what are we facing a body change run run bride run as fast as you can into his presence amen but don't run without a message run with it yes amen amen run with the message now I've got to get going we know he chose us in himself before the foundation of the world I was going to read that it's his purpose it was his purpose you are accepted in the Beloved and in the dispensation of the fullness of times he would gather together in one all things in Christ and we are in that dispensation and what's he doing gathering together all things in himself what a place what a place of worship what a place to make sacrif your sacri you knowing you in this message knows that if you don't your sacrifice will not be accepted except it be received in the place of his worship and that's in Christ you cannot worship him as you should unless you're in Christ the token is required it's not that I hope I get it it's required amen what is the token his own literal life praise be to God gives you everything you have need of just take it speak for it and go forward all right in the seed of discrepancy he was the word made manifest he was God's interpretation of the word well we all believe that we believe it's the interpretation of the word today do you believe that amen sure we believe it all right watch what else he said amen search the because he was the interpret he was God's interpretation of the word because he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life which there's only one form that's God so in them you think you're a part of God and they are they that test testify of me all right now as it did in that day when the word and God was one I'm sorry I'm back in another okay and they that and they are they that testify of me there you are he was the interpretation of the word and every born again son and daughter of God of this age is the interpretation of the word the Lord think of that yes it ought to be here ye him what is the bride's position the very manifestation of the word for the hour by divine revelation inspiration of God's himself opening himself coming to himself you are himself you are the very interpretation of the word you are written Epistles read of all men yes but by one Spirit through baptism of the Holy Ghost by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and that body is the family is a family the family of God and that's the house of God the family of God is the house House of God and the house of God is the name of Jesus Christ all right the name of the Lord is a mighty tower the name is the righteous run into it and are safe safe amen can anybody say Amen that you're safe amen amen you're safe I have chose to put my name at the door of the House of My Worship for my family will be gathered in in there in there where is in there in his house where is his house you are his house but what is in there Christ is in there the token is at the door the token is applied Amen on the house showing what's in the house amen that's right all right so he said I have chose to put my name at the door of my house of My Worship my family gathered in there and in there there's no leavened bread there's no denominational mixture in it anywhere my house my children born of my genes there you are amen glory to God my jeans are in them how much more perfect can you have it you say Brother David do you believe that more than I believe I'm standing here I believe that with all my heart you are the Gen you are his genes he's standing right here behind skin he's right here tonight he's in our midst amen amen amen it isn't just it's it's not a a mental if it is that's fine but I'm saying Let It Drop into the heart it's a revelation to her it's a Revelation my all right now said my children my house my children born of my genes my genes are in them I put my word in them I'll write them see when God has given you the new the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you it's the new birth you're sealed into the kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit and there can't be a true bapt you know brother Brown made that differentiation between true baptism and baptism the true is that it fell upon the word the water of the word fell upon the word and quickened that word to life that's why right now our headship is a kingdom and the kingdom of God is within you and it orders you and it directs you and and if you'll let it it'll lead you and guide you contrary to your thinking your carnal thinking it'll drive you contrary to your mental feelings and your sensible feelings and senses and reasoning it'll guide you but it'll guide you perfectly and he's always on time yes and he's never late he's always right and your way is made perfect because you're in the perfect one that is a perfect in all he does hallelujah all right it quickens that seed and when that seed is quickened it's a new creation it's meeting God face to face if you want to see that go to 2 Corinthians 3:18 and go to 2 Corinthians 46 not yeah six and write the next verse said we have this treasure in Earth and vessels yes because when Christ God opens up and lights that within your heart you're meeting Christ Jesus himself face to face and that new birth is that revelation of himself amen amen amen my my my we use great plainness of speech brother Paul we just use great plainness of speech people don't like it so plain but we use great plainness all right now can I just take about just a few more minutes I I didn't hear an amen so I'll take it anyway okay upon I'll write it upon the tables of their heart that's my family the family of the body of Jesus Christ is the family and I'll write this upon the tables of their heart your written Epistles okay the thoughts of the Christian today are his thoughts before the foundation of the world he thought of you amen his thoughts is the Christian of today now watch I'm coming up to something and I don't want to leave this watch his sinless nature expressed God's word make no mistake his sinless nature expressed God's word oh but Brother David I don't have a sin sin this nature I do am I also have a carnal nature dwelling in this body but I don't pay attention to the carnal nature though it wants to pay attention and wants to speak to me and every time I do good it's against me and that old carnal man is enity that carnal thinking is enity and it's an enemy to me and it's wicked it'll say all kinds of things it'll look very reasonable and Satan loves to use that to get you off thead revelation of who you are and get you to pay attention to something you're not well God's going to judge you by this and that no he won't because he's already judged me he's already found me me perfect he's already cases dismissed he's already opened the book and I'm judged perfect in Christ now I'm coming to that I'm going to bypass some things here but I want to make some points right here now watch the only way that you'll ever be able to express God's word that you believe it and watch it act behind you you will have to have that sinless nature that come from that come from God before the foundation of the world you was recognized with him before the world before the before the word can ever express you were recognized with him before the foundation world before the word can ever express itself through you it takes a sinless nature to do that amen so you see if it was God's thoughts so see if he was if he was in God's thoughts when he come to the world he come in God's thoughts at the beginning to display his attribute do you follow me amen then Jesus came to break the clouds back so the attributes you and I could display itself amen that's it he is God's expressed word now nothing else could be manifest manifesting pretty straight all right so you have to be born again Christ has to be in you living all right now now watch this and I'm going to go from here and I got to bypass a lot of things but I'm just if you are a son of God and I'm a Son of God or a daughter of God we were in God at the beginning and when Jesus came became the fullness of the word then we were in him him germ form that says a multitude of things that settles you right there in your position in germ form you were in him in germ form the germ is in the male that germ is in the blood there you were all all right when he was crucified we was crucified in his body when he rose from the dead we rose with him am and now since we have recognized it been awakened now since we have recognized it now we set together with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Satan can can not get you out of there you're sealed in him and he's already defeated Christ already conquered him therefore you are more than a conqueror all right all right now if we are Sons and Daughters of God we are God's children then we are attributes of God God eternal life and God is the only eternal life there is and we were ending from the beginning and when Jesus became all that word then we were a part of him then there you are then you've already been received you've already been accepted in him now who's going to take you out of him there isn't enough mistakes there isn't enough failures there isn't enough of anything that could remove me or take me from him but do I want to do that no if you have the desire in you to do that where's Christ see all right I'm talking about the desire of the Soul not the desire of this outside man he has all kinds of desires but I'm talking about the desire of this C Gene this germ that was in him when he died you were in him then and you've come to life because the water of the Holy Spirit has has injected that into pre-prepared ground and you're birthed and what are you birthed you're the word birth you're that life and because that life's in you makes you a son amen makes Jesus the man the son makes David the son makes you the son but it's not without his life in you it's just not saying I am it's revealed that you are this new birth is not I hope I'm born again this new birth is not an emotion this new birth is a genuine direct revelation of Jesus Christ in you it's the word opened in you amen all right now I'm going to bypass some things [Music] now the leoan church naked blind miserable don't even know it it's that anointed it's that anointed what's anointed that church age that blind naked they're anointed Anointed with the real spirit that Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in his Spirit but his soul is his germ what's the real gift I preach that when you all were Camp okay when the rest of you were Camp I had seven people here we had seven excuse me I didn't we he he did but the real gift is your soul down in there there you are that was born of God that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God and there you grow up you're a son and daughter of God you're a child of God all right Christ has got a perfect body all right I was identified with him so now watch his his your soul is his germ The Germ is the word and I don't care how much you preach how well you do this and how well you love that's one of the inlets to the spirit little s you can't love you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the inlets that's not Holy Spirit that's little Spirit that's one of the inlets to the spirit you you can't love excuse me I'm sorry that's one of the lets and you can't you can love and even love God and still not be right you can cast out devils and preach and do the things these things still not be right and we believe in casting out Devils we believe in shouting I'm not against those things right you ought to see me when I get pretty excited I believe in say I believe in that I believe that I have nothing about that but that's the evidence I got the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost responding I believe that but it sure isn't my evidence my evidence is this germ that's become alive in me and is continuing to become alive the word coming on word coming on word coming on word growing what's growing he's growing what's growing the birth word is growing am and it's taking over this body of clay it's taking over the ground you know that as a farmer you watch you plant that seed and see if that seed don't take over the ground that ground will crack open and open up and that thing will press this way right out amen is that right Little Lily from the bottom of the pond takes possession you can't keep that I don't care if you put it under a slab of cement where's the most grass out here on the end you're not going to cover it over it'll take possession of the cement the cement didn't conquer it right amen see it's going to rise anyway maybe it caused a deformity there but as soon as it gets to set in the sun it'll go right up that right sure all right now I've got a quit really I do I was identified with him all that he was all that I am he was being dead in him we are identified with him and what he is I am all that he was I am and all that all that he was I am and all that I am he was yes that's pretty clear all right that little germ see you don't want to look at the natural you want to break into the spirit see where you're at see that little germ your soul is a germ The Germ is the word amen all right now and so and the perfect word and perfect word is the church will be swed and believed in the perfect word and the perfect word and perfect the perfect word and the perfect word he's the word and you're the word will unite together in one flesh and one body as a husband and wife and the prophet said I've that's already that word's gone out to do that so they are no longer Twain They Are One my that well lovely see all right now okay now one couple more things and I'm done really I am that soul is the gene that come from God all right I just want to get to okay oh just a moment here okay I just bypassed it okay he said in invisible Union you never did it never sinned in the first place he said you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life do you see how it can be a book within a book same book but a book within the book a record within the record the bride record you wonder what the Seven Seals sealed it sealed the whole book but what was it sealing the bride record all right now now we and in his mind as I preached last night you are a germ of the gene of God and that real Gene that real germ a soul of God was in God before the foundation of the world because you that's really got the spirit in you tonight you were were in here in Christ be because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily then if you were a gene God a gene a word an attribute from the beginning then you walked with him here on Earth you talked with him on Earth you suffered with him on Earth you died with him at Calvary you Rose again you Rose again brother B said already risen you're not say I hope I make it he said you've already made it I wonder if we can swallow that this tonight we've already made it all right you died with him at Calvary you Rose with him and now sitting in Heavenly places with him the word as it feeds into your soul and that germ that was in you at the beginning that germ that was in you at the beginning found you amen amen amen has it found you that's it now I'm closing if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here's the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary Mary's the shock so is this amen that word that's in me is no part of this amen am men but he will raise this up because he's laid claim on it by the blood are you with me okay now the harmony of the father and the son was Jesus never never did anything until was first showed him by the father that will be the harmony between God and his bride and he says the harmony is now to exist between the groom and bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it there therefore nothing can harmmer not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here's the secret unveiled secret the word is in the bride all right so then communion 1965 I'm not going to read that but he said I'm therefore born again I realized I'm not the son of Charles and Ella branam in their nature I was a sinner I grew up a sinner and liar under their nature but he said I realized being born again that I'm no longer I'm not the real son I'm not the son of Charles and Ella branam I'm a Son of God born of God with that nature of God he planted there so you can go back and pick that up see I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it and then it began to grow now there's your real baptism now that old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to Never Be Remembered against me no more now we stand Justified as though you never sin in the presence of God I
