Thee I will my hands in thy name I lift my hands low unto thy name lift my hands alone unto thy name my lips shall praise thee Thee I will lift up my hands in th name amen what a privilege we have to be able to lift our hands and praise Him Amen to have a place where we can come in Liberty to be able to just Express who we are Express the desires of our heart and you know the thing that's so wonderful about that is that the desire of our heart is here with him not out there and I I say thank you for that Lord amen just want to this morning you know sometimes you just kind of get a little brain block and um just uh want to remember our sister April I know um had gone off to some kind of a uh conventions and I'm I'm not trying to be funny but I don't know what a Convention of Surgeons talk about uh but um just remember her in prayer sister Diane amen that is she feeling better yes good good she had a little something there on her scalp that um they felt has to remove and we know that the Lord regardless of the involvement of doctors the Lord is our healer amen he is our portion he is everything to us and so um we just want to continue to remember sister Diane until that's completely healed up and uh whatever things the doctors be concerned about amen also remember sister jolen and sister leyah down in Mexico um just Lord would be with them and um we have something um that um is going to be I guess in the realm of Fellowship maybe a little bit exclusive to our our sisters but we have a sister Maria who has come here to boisee from Tanzania and uh obviously uh the language barrier uh is going to be great and uh we have to rely on you sisters that all of you that speak Swahili to be able to interact she knows was just a little bit of English uh but um you know it was a little hard for me to communicate cuz she send a message and I have to copy that and go over into Google translate and Google Translates like actually Jerry sister Jerry did that portion Google Translates like this is Swahili and we're like okay cuz you know it's pretty hard to to understand anything from that but she's getting established here in boisey I I don't have more details than that um uh just a brother uh oh I don't know probably a couple weeks ago 3 weeks maybe had sent me a a WhatsApp about um uh her presence here her desire to be here in fellowship and so please remember Sister Maria and uh just want to when the time is appropriate she she's moving uh uh this weekend I guess and um times appropriate we want to be able to welcome her wholeheartedly into the assembly uh and do what we can do as Brothers and Sisters in Christ amen and uh I'd like to just have a special little welcome home this morning sister Alice uh we expect full report to the detail of where you went what you saw and when somebody built it and when somebody blew it up we want to know all about your trip amen but we are happy to have sister Alice home with us today amen amen I I'm very happy for sister Alice because these are the things when I was a kid you only dreamed that someday you might do and I accomplish some of that sister Alice at at 50 or 60 years old and here you are as a young lady getting to experience that and we're very very happy for you amen and I don't want to embarrass anybody but um sister Rebecca would you come forward today oh she's not Oh I thought I caught a glimpse of her oh my okay well we'll postpone that part I just glanced back and I thought oh there she is but it might be that s sibling not to hurt your kids' feelings but that sibling uh resemblance um anyway okay well praise the Lord let's um in our Bibles today thank you amen sure appreciate our musicians I appreciate brother Isaac and leading songs it just uh stirs my heart Amen to be able just to worship and and uh be able to just open up and and let the word amen through song or through the scripture uh touch our hearts I want to talk to you I've been I've been uh this has just been on my heart and my mind for quite some time now um you know uh uh you know the other day I guess just a moment of nostalgia I I went back and I was just listening to a little bit of um brother Gideon preaching there to the church little did we know that in just a few weeks of many of these sermons that he would be going home but he was preaching of something no doubt was so real so visual to him talking about the eagle all he's got to do is just hold his wings steady that's right and the wind the word underneath his wings is what carries him he's not out here just flapping his wings trying to make it but he knows that the power power that is in the wind will hold him will support him amen and he preached that and I thought Lord could it be that that was anointed upon him to preach those because it was his going home but yet even that was so he preached it for the benefit of the Bride amen amen we don't need to go out here and just beat our wings trying to make it through leoda we need to just trust God we need to just let him come and let him let the word that he spoke to us become so real to us that that we literally can just put our wings out and just say it's the word Beneath My Wings it's not me it's not what I can do it's not what I have have accomplished but it's simply our Lord Jesus I know this might sound a little strange but I I don't know I want to be ready at whatever time the Lord calls me and I've just been upon my heart so strong lately of what is Beyond the Veil that's right and it's just the thought has just been getting bigger and bigger and bigger amen and as we look at this there's so many parts of this that you can't just in one service or even probably two or three services touch upon this but to realize how through the scripture all through this scripture everything my brother and sister now don't misunderstand me we're not discounting anything in days gone by but everything in the scripture has come to a culmination now what was preached in the Old Testament in the temple what Jesus spoke the Mount of Olives what he spoke there at C Calvary every every drop of that is coming right out down into this day it's it's being concentrated down as it were and and when you take something and you concentrate it it holds every single value that it did in the hole is now in the concentrate and as the prophet preached to us he says you know is you just take one little drop of that ocean that's right that's all right there that the ocean contains and just that one little of Christ is all of Christ amen so don't look at yourself or let the devil kind of discourage you that maybe you're not this real spiritual person but just take the fact that you got that one drop of Christ you've got Christ amen amen and I I just uh I just uh looking at these things and and U I thought Lord I don't know but anyway just so strong I just felt led to start preaching about this and I want to speak a little bit today maybe just uh an opening of this thought for the future uh Beyond the Veil amen and uh uh I I will probably be taking this in a slightly different direction uh than than it would be because we want to just lay a real Firm Foundation what is in the natural is only a reflection of what was or is in the spiritual amen remember it was always the word first amen the prophet preaching in this day put the word first well that's because that was always the order of the universe is the word first amen let's turn our bibles if we would today Hebrews the 10th chapter and uh I tell you I had quite a morning I had a sermon almost ready just simply to push save and it disappeared and it never reappeared y and so my whole morning was this mad scramble I know Brother David would would be able to reflect this sometimes in a moment of inspiration you write something down if that goes away from you you have to get back to that inspiration to find that thought but the problem is in our human desperation that makes it pretty hard to get back in the spirit to find the thought and so I had this very hectic very hectic morning you might say but but uh you know all things work together for those who love the Lord so we're not here in desperation this morning even though I looked like it earlier but uh Hebrews the 10th chapter verse 15 through verse 23 whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us is't that wonderful we're not we're not just having to look at Witnesses we can lay hands on but the holy spirit is coming down and being a witness to us amen this is a covenant that I will make with them after those days sayith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and Living Way which he hath cons consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and after having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart you see with anything less than a True Heart you'll never see it right so that's why we have to stop and make sure our attitude our spirit the atmosphere around us is conditioned to be able to approach the word and receive from the word what God is expressing out of the word did that make sense yes having our hearts sprinkled from Evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised Heavenly Father we ask you to bless the word today bless the Saints father each one that's here in the house of God Lord Lord you have a portion for them and we ask you Lord just release the power in your word let us be here to receive it father in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now I find this to be a very inspiring scripture because as you read this you are not looking at something that is saying I hope this is or this might possibly be but as Paul is speaking to the Hebrews he's telling them the Holy Ghost is our witness and this Covenant is not going to be a covenant that's simply something printed on a page a scroll rolled up put on a shelf a book published set aside but this is going to be something that's into the heart or on the heart of Sons and Daughters of God and in that time my brother and sister it is uh this Covenant that he has made now we know that if God says it it has to come to pass can we say Amen to that not a not a question not a doubt in our mind that if God said I'm your healer that he is our healer amen if I'm your deliverer then we should be expecting to be delivered amen and as we look at these things we'll find that when he declares and we won't go into the side note here but when he declares I'm your Revelation amen then we should expect to have revelation we should expect to receive from the Lord amen those things that have been hidden Through the Ages but are made known in this day to you and I amen now if we have no expectation of Revelation then you might as well just take your pen go through your Bible and scratch the word revelation out everywhere you come acrost it because if you don't believe it it may as well be absent from you but as we stand here today believing that God has promised Revelation to us as Sons and Daughters of God then this revelation will come to us in the right season amen so you know I I think it's wonderful you know this might be a little hard for some people to uh to approach uh Verse 18 because um you know old teachings and old traditions can be a little bit hard to let go of because they're ingrained in us but I just want to focus for one moment on this there is no more offering for sin my brother and sister I don't care what you have or what you think you can bring there is no more offering for sin it is a settled question Jesus on Calvary said it is finished and if we believe the word we can this morning no matter what our circumstance a health condition a family condition a personal emotional or whatever condition we can say it is finished today amen and we don't have to look back hoping that we can live good enough or do good enough enough or approach it in the right way but to come and say Lord here I am I just simply as a song says I surrender all do we really know what I surrender all means uh I surrender all but no my brother and sister we got to come to the place we surrender all and as we look at this realizing that he has already made this way for us and he is uh uh uh telling us to draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of faith our hearts sprinkled from Evil conscience which would be as it would be evil thoughts or evil approach you know uh you know holding on to to things in life that we should let go of it's amazing I've experienced such in my life that you will be dealing with someone that is is uh Desiring uh deliverance and and they're Desiring to overcome and yet you they themselves will ultimately confess that I still hold a bitterness I still hold an anger I still hold something maybe against parents or a friend or this that or the other and and it's there that as long as that is present my brother and sister that totally takes every bit of power out of the promise the promise didn't go away you just have not tapped the power amen and so you come to a place you know that's why they put fuses in into all things electronic Etc you go and you you know it's like this doesn't work oh the fuse is blown you put another fuse in there it will blow it immediately amen it's not the new fuse is not going to fix the problem you can say oh I've had a new birth amen well that's not going to fix the problem if you have bitterness and anger and fear and all of these other things you can put as much and apply that as much as you want we had an experience just recently I don't know we haven't fixed the problem yet but you put a new fuse in there and you don't even have it shoved in there and it's gone and you could put as many fuses in there as you want that will not fix the problem what God wants is for us to look and say okay there's a reason that I'm not tapped into the power of the word there's a reason these promises of God are not coming to pass in my life maybe it's something that we have totally forgotten about in the past but we need to deal with it maybe it's something that down inside you know that that something even the mention of someone's name brings a little something to us and we think oh it's just that that was just from the past you need to deal with that cuz it'll blow the fuse every single time amen but when we'll come and say you know what there's a reason that I'm not tapping into the power of the word there's a reason these things aren't taking place in my life my family maybe even the church we can have that kind of influence amen and we need to go back and the scripture tells us to search our hearts amen that's not a casual overview my brother and sister but search the heart and you say well I I don't know I just can't bring myself to that well let me give you a natural thing when brother Jason sister Emmy moved here and we had the trailer loaded with their possessions and we come to the border and they saidy okay what's in this trailer and and it was like my friend's household his his life not his wife his life and uh and they said okay you need to go over here they stopped the big semis you need to go over here and you need to go through this machine now pull forward to the point that we tell you to and stop you get out of the machine put the keys on the dash you stand right there so we're there but the officer was a nice man and as they're starting this process uh he's like there's nothing living inside that trailer is there no pets no nothing no sir and he goes uh do do you know what's in there I said well I never packed the boxes I just packed the boxes amen so you know the man comes back to me and he says sir yes there is an image right over the wheels of this trailer what is in that what is that and what is in it I said well sir that's awesome I know the answer to that my friend when he went to welding school had to build a project at the end of his deal there that met the the the teacher deals and and that is a big steel lockable box that he buil built and and uh handcrafted it himself and it's beautiful and he says what's in it and I said well there's this this I started naming everything that we had set inside there there's hammers there's wrenches there's this he says there's nothing that you'd be willing to go to jail for is there and I said absolutely not and he goes good I believe you my brother and sister the reason I bring that up is I'm telling you if man can look inside of something that's packed wall toall almost to the ceiling and be able to isolate a single crescent wrench in the middle of a trailer how the Holy Spirit would come down and cause you and I to search our lives cause us to stop and say Lord what is it is hindering me what is keeping me from rising up into Heavenly places amen if man can devise that then what will the Holy Spirit do to you and I amen amen as we look at this you know as I said earlier I find it very inspiring it's uh a promise to us this is a promise my brother and sister that he's made a covenant to us this is not just casual talk conversation but this is a covenant that he made and and uh you know uh he says and I just want to remind you of this there sins and iniquities will I remember no more that ought to give us confidence in the house of God this morning if we've done what we are supposed to do and that is repent amen and then we'll come that God does not even bring up or remember are issues the things of our past our struggles and and I tell you if you've been stupid in your life pardon me for using that I'm I'm slowly being trained to not use several words if you're not what replaces stupid I've already said it amen you know what Satan desires he wants to take your boldness the word says to come boldly to the throne of God Satan wants to take your boldness if he can bring you to a place that you remember the little fuss now I know it won't be you people but it be people like you that get anointed to fight in the car on the way to church amen let me look real careful but look at this my brother and sister the reason Satan does things like that you can worship you can have a lovely atmosphere and you're going to the house of God and Satan does not want you to be able to worship boldly this morning so what does he do he fires a little Dart in there and it causes a little fuss to do we come in the house of God we won't even hardly sing because of the atmosphere that he uh placed upon us and so the boldness that we'd have to come upon the word of God is just totally erased but that if we'll remember right is not you it's not your brother your sister sister or your mother it is the devil amen because he wants to steal your boldness in the house of God today to take a halt of a promise to take a halt of the word and be able to stand there and say this will come to pass now people get all nervous when they hear people say thus sayeth the Lord but how about we just reward that a little bit so you'll be comfortable how about thus sayith the word amen my brother and sister That's what Satan wants he wants to take the B oldness of you confessing and trusting and stepping out on the word he wants to take that from you I'll tell you a timid Christian is not hardly a Christian amen oh that that might hurt the promise is right there promise is right there amen it's just right there that's right what's stopping you from possessing it that's it amen because you're afid to take that next step out now if I could relate a little something we missed all of you on the camping trip yes it was so terribly hot it was so scorching but it was cooler than here so all of you that didn't go camping cuz it was hot well you're lost amen cuz it was cooler than here in more than one way yeah but look at this we're out there we're kaying something new to me would have made a great video you know kayaks look like zigzag stitches to those of you who sew it all depends on which paddle is but we went off down the lake and and uh uh some of the young men in the church they went down there climbed up this tree that's hanging over the lake it looked to me like it Fallen the lake but it it was there and and uh you know they climbed way up there that rope was tied so far up there I don't know who is brave enough to climb up there but they Swang uh off that and flew way out there well sister Jerry and I were in The Kayaks and and we're watching and these young men come across and one of them climbs up there gets the Rope hurts himself because he didn't get the slack of the Rope out and it kind of rope burned him and whatnot and and he's there kind of recovering on the bank and Ne kid says I'm going to do it but he climbed a little ways up up he was just about that far short of being able to grab the crossbar just that close and they said go on up and he said I ain't going no further come on you're that close man and he's like I already slipped and almost fell once I ain't doing it so then instead of giving six in I hope you catch this instead of giving six Ines more effort to get the crossbar he climbed down the tree backwards and when he climbed off of the tree he was skinned on his arms his knees his legs and he was like that's too scary come on Christians just six more inches in other words just one more help me Lord just one more stepping out Lord I'm going to trust you amen but he reached a point he couldn't go no further this far from the crossbar the guy who belly flopped that was part of or yeah the the guy who well yeah I want to describe it it was quite amazing to see a quite chubby guy land on the water with arms and legs out and even as he hits the water you hear this giant OU but I tell you what he was a good Christian because he went right back even though it was painful he went right back and said I'm not going to quit now you have to take that place that good Christian however you want to place it I wasn't talking about him as a man amen because right after out comes some language that we won't repeat but you see if Satan can take your boldness if he can cause you to waver what's the scripture say that if a man is double-minded he's not just double-minded in one situation of his life but if a man is double-minded he becomes unstable in all of his ways and it might not happen instantly my brother and sister but when we come to the place we can't sell out and completely trust the Lord with our life with our circumstance with our every day if we come to the place that do that you'll find that the things we can't trust God for will actually grow not decrease and so as it is that when we become double-minded or unstable on the word of God that we'll find ourselves starting in a pattern of backing up upon the word there'll be more and more things that we'll have to question we can't really trust but what God is looking is for someone that will say you know what I can give one more effort Lord I can give one more day I can give one more bit of my very being of life I can give that to you Lord cuz I trust you Satan just wants you to waver do you realize if he can cause us to waver he can just sit back and watch the rest take place right we'll read a little bit of a quote here in a little bit if I get myself in gear amen remember the Holy Ghost ghost is a witness to us now you know have you ever been in a situation you thought you was friends with someone and a little something comes up and and that just breaks that Fellowship uh and and you you don't ever really figure it out you don't really know exactly what caused that to to take place but Satan's desire is to break our fellowship you see now if he's got us to the place we don't trust he's going to then bring us down to a place that are Fellowship Fades away that our fellowship is is going to falter and one day completely end and uh you know uh the word of God tells us that if we add one thing to the word of God or we subtract one thing it it uh is judgment to us but I tell you just look at it in this sense here that just one thing added or one thing subtracted uh it changes the whole relationship if you if you've ever been um this is something not to make emphasis of it has happened to me in my life people I thought were my friends and they lied to me you know it's really hard to trust them let's just think about it naturally for a moment if they lied to you and you realize that that was premeditated a blent and lie H you realize in the future you have a hard time ever trusting that person and maybe it will go so far if you're talking in the natural that that maybe before money things or issues like that and suddenly it's no longer hey trust me when they say the word trust me you don't know if they're sincere now or not and you don't know if you should or you shouldn't because something has affected you in such a fashion that that last little link that was in that chain right a Chain's only as strong as its weakest link and in that you no longer have the confidence to just step out and say yeah I'll trust you but you see my brother and sister that's what Satan's Desiring I have dealt so many times and just here recently in a conversation with an individual was there saying you know what I I thought I was delivered from this brother Paul I thought I was free from this and it's come back upon my life and now I can't trust myself now how is a young man like that ever going to step out into the word grab a promise and say this is my promise and Satan you can't Prime my fingers from this promise when he doesn't even trust himself I think we've all been there before we've done things we say well I'll never do that again and we do it yeah Hallelujah examine yourself so as you look at this this little things added or subtracted changes the relationship now in the quote lean not un thine own understanding amen is it on there brother Gideon um brother brandham says right here i i cherry pick this for people that you know whatever if if that bothers you you know where to find it yes one word of God misplaced or misconstrued that's now I want you to understand the word misconstrued what do they call that when you have a similar word misunderstood misconstrued what do they call those synonyms yes educated people know what that word is one word put out of place or misunderstood you see it doesn't even have to be intentional my brother and sister this is why God wants you and I to search the scripture because if we have one reference right here and we run with that one reference but it's a little bit out of place we can mess up everything do you know in science class years ago we Advanced science we in in school we did some experiments and you know the teacher after we had done this whole thing and heated these things with the little alcohol burners and the little glass tubes and things went up and separated and we we did this and that and and the teacher says now uh before we go to the next step and add the next ingredient how many of you put exactly what you were supposed to in the deal and some of the kids had just taking their little squeezer things you know and just ah that'll be enough and some of the kids he he got real serious with this I need to know some of the kids well we didn't really measure he goes okay shut your burner off you're done because if you have too much of this ingredient when we add the next ingredient it'll blow up and I was thinking H we're in high school you know they're not going to have the end of the building blow off here because a teacher wants to prove a point but let me tell you we added the ingredient we started to heat it to a certain temperature and the far end of the lab all of a sudden Beaker with the deal under it and all that stuff went and we're all just like and the teacher's like you thought I was lying to you this proves who in this class trusts me it's like it wouldn't have blowed the building up no just the beaker oh you know the rest of the year I mean you could almost see kids with a magnifying glass looking at stuff a little too much we better pour that out because they got to a point they trusted my brother and sister too much religion makes Fanatics too little means you're just lost but one's just as dangerous as the other because you know you can be a Fanatic in the negative that's right one word of God misplaced or misconstrued or not accepted breaks the whole Chain man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God so every word my brother and sister gives you and I are cross reference to take every idea we've ever had about the word every uh uh personal understanding every personal interpretation every personal revelation and we've got a whole my rid of things we can run it through to make sure it lines up there's no excuse for us to be out of the word there no excuse for us to not understand what God is speaking no excuse for us my brother and sister because I I'm getting to a point trust me here amen everything must be absolutely correct because I'm going to speak to you on a side note for a moment the veil is just like a filter everything that is not the word and not pleasing to God cannot get through the Veil amen and as you look at that everything as it is that we are living here today has to go through the filter of the word did the prophet not teach us that amen it has to go through that filter because if it can't make it through the filter it's not of God and I say today Lord let the word come let it filter our thoughts let it filter our Revelations understanding everything that we do Let It filter it Lord I don't need a bypass I don't need an excuse I don't need a reason why not to accept this because you said if it's not accepted that's just like being misplaced or misconstrued you got to accept it that's really you know that's a lot harder than you think I don't want to be negative this morning okay so I think that might be why the Lord you know blew up my my sermon this morning made it disappear I had a couple really sharp statements in there that was just you know growl when I spoke it and and I couldn't remember what they were by the time ago around to do it again so maybe that wasn't but look at this now I might sound like I'm growling but my brother and sister we're coming down to a day that when the prophet of God said the Bible is our final Authority our absolute amen now look what's happening in the world today is that I'm not talking out here in the methodists even though we'll touch on some of that stuff in a minute but we're looking my brother and sister that we're toning it down by giving an alternate alternative ative of what is our absolute we don't need another alternative the prophet gave us his word and said the Bible is our absolute let's just let that be our absolute okay we don't need to reconstr that readjust that change that a little bit amen now this absolute we just read some of the scripture involved right here but in this absolute it declared that we are the chosen of God my brother and sister let's go back to kids out on the baseball diamond you know how it used to be everybody lined up for a pickup game of baseball you know and you're there and two kids usually the more popular ones get chosen as the captains and everybody's there I hope they choose me let's see there are more kids standing here than it takes to make a baseball team and and um I hope I get chosen and you can see the Supreme disappointment to those kids who are not chosen and if you are chosen you don't walk over and play for the other team you play for the team that chose you and the word says that you are chosen and have found favor Above All Mankind I'm not going to go play for the other team I'm not going to say I wanted to play on that team or that team I'm just going to sit here and do nothing we are chosen and we're here today to Rejoice that we are chosen amen that the word has come and said you know what I've chose you to be my bride we don't go over and sorry for using these strong words we don't go act like the Harlot amen we we don't go over here and behave in an uncomely fashion when we have been chosen be the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we uh we are Rejoice that we were chosen amen cuz we've been birthed by the word Can someone say Amen we've been washed by the word amen amen thank the Lord for that amen we've been molded by the word imagine if we left ourselves to mold ourselves to be Christians what we would show up looking like I tell you that's the world I hope you don't find this offensive but there's not going to be any purple-haired body pierced earring wearing tattooed Christians in glory boy that's right Paul that was harsh there might be some ex purple-haired tattooed body pierced tattooed people but nobody's standing there glorying in what they are in this flesh they will have thank the Lord that he washed them amen look God calls them from all situations in life and we shouldn't be judgmental of that but we can't continue on in what creat created us to be that we can't continue on that and then say Oh I'm chosen of God God's word is very very narrow my brother and sister and the world doesn't line they say you're bigoted you're very narrow-minded but my brother and sister my Bible yes my Bible and if you have a Bible your Bible well okay this goes on later in the sermon excuse me we're jumping ahead you wonder why there's all kinds of these new translations of the Bible is because they continue to water it and water it until it has nothing no power means nothing that's right I watched a clip the other day I hope this doesn't offend anyone I watched a clip that was taken somebody's phone in a church service the pastor preaching on a very strong subject and he says church I hope this doesn't offend you or make you mad but I would just like to see by a show of hands how many of you are not married and living together and the camera panned the congregation hundreds and hundreds of people and hundreds and hundreds of hands were raised then the pastor you see that he watered it down because then he says well don't fear your Christians God loves you you're saved but you should consider well I is right yeah that's like the old priest telling the young priest there's something you got to quit doing and the young priest says what do I need to quit doing he says when people come in the confessional you got to quit saying wow my brother and sister it's a wow it's the age we're living in is that Beyond the Veil no my brother and sister I know this may be a little strong and direct we have visitors I hope it's not offensive but my brother and sister you have to preach what God lays upon your heart to preach you see we've been molded by the word that means we've been changed from that Old creature into a new creature amen we've been dressed by the word amen we're no longer dressing oursel we're no longer dressing oursel he is dressing us and when he dresses us people will say you're weird well my brother and sister if that's what God wants you to be then just be that don't care what the world cares because the world's not going to get Beyond the Veil amen now in the seventh Church age let's look at this real quick when the bride has been committed to the groom take this natural spiritual take it any way you please when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil so when the commitment actually comes we won't get into a whole deal of of of courtship and Etc because at the point that you say I'll marry you and you both in our agreements you're actually committed but let's look at this as the ceremony they've come here comes the bride beautiful bride dressed in white all of her bridesmaids the groom well not all are handsome so anyway uh we'll leave that alone but he's got his groomsmen they come they do vows they present a ring they they go through the whole thing and um then what happens I'm getting old what happens right after they get done with that portion of everything he lifts the rug it's not a rug is it it's a veil she can see him and he can see her but there's a veil between that's right and is at the point it comes you may kiss the bride he lifts the veil and if you've ever been to very many weddings it can be interesting I've seen him everything from the veil was to so big he kept lifting it and it would slide this way and that way and seen them pull it completely off their head uh seen a whole lot of things but let's just talk normal and he goes over there and he lifts the veil she doesn't lift her own Veil but we've seen that happen kind of like man who is this guy I'm marrying he can't even lift a simple Veil here but he lifts the veil then he gets to kiss the bride hopefully their first kiss but you see imagine what it how awkward it would be if he goes to kiss her and he decides he's not lifting the veil so he just kisses her right through through the veil it'd be like huh seems like in the first few seconds of our marriage there's something already come between us because you see you can't make that a full relationship until the veil is lifted and you know when the veil is lifted and he kisses his bride that starts you know as brother Bram speaks about this that three- room house my brother and sister you can have the kitchen and you can have the living room but it's not a relationship until it makes it to the bedroom I hope that's not too strong of words for anybody but you see without the relationship being completed it's just living together in in a very traditional sense uh you know not the modern definition of living together so it'd be just like oh we have Fellowship we had a ceremony and we have Fellowship that's not marriage that's right amen so we look look at this now uh committed she takes off the veil places it over on the groom's shoulders this very common in South America we've seen this a lot down there amen they pin it on the bridegroom's shoulder amen so signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also see now in the feminist world we live in they're like I'm not going to be that no my brother and sister you see that's what the problem is is you got two people driving the car you got two people making the decision I'm not talking about cooperation I'm talking about a battle that's right I'm talking about Warfare I'm talking about we're going to do this my way we're going to do this my way we're not doing it at all kind of an atmosphere but you see as it comes we see it down through history but now it's eroding away she's transferred her rights to him amen that he is the head but also see that's not just for a man to say wife although I've done that Brothers No volunteers come on we're in church it's time to be truthful but you see maybe in our impatience or whatever we might speak that way but this is a part of you left hand I told you we're going to the garage come on no it don't work that way these two are now one amen Lord help us that we misconstrue that misunderstand that that's right come on he Bears responsibility and care and he and he alone amen amen I tell you what this comes out of a real life story that we won't go into but you know you're in trouble when you come home from work and the neighbor is in your house doing the honeydews for your wife that's right there's trouble on the horizon it's him and him alone that bears the responsibility and the care and he and he alone no else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the Key of David God being Sovereign he fornew by Divine decree exactly who would be his bride amen now if we take this away don't think I'm here preaching to put the sisters down nonsense I'll tell you what we do when we have balance in our home we Empower our wives our daughters we Empower not degrade we Empower them to be able to be bold in who they are and the position God has put them in but in the world we live in today they think Rebellion is righteous Rebellion is not righteous it's a sin of Witchcraft and he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her we're talking about our lord Jesus now he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and him alone the problem is we've now broken the pattern of ownership am in the world of feminism they would decry and scream and say I was some kind of weird whatever but when you look at the Gospel of Jesus Christ and even in the courts of our nation in times past Jerry belongs to me that's right right but without the right understanding it brings up a in the people how dare you think your wife belongs to you well she certainly don't belong to the neighbor H right come on She's mine and this probably needs to be edited out but I tell you what I'd kill to defend her nobody's going to come and cause trouble in my house and me stand back and say well I don't know maybe he has a right to do this maybe somebody else gave him permission yeah no feet first head first he's leaving that's right edit that Brothers wash her own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of his church and Sarah called Abraham Lord even so there's the happy that he is her uh he is her Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her Delight you know you know what he's saying let me interpret that we're not here going woe is me to be a Christian we're here saying you know what thank you he asked me to live I will live he asked me to give I will give he asked me to walk I will walk he asked me to do I will do amen and I'm happy to do this I already touched on this but I'll just go through it again make sure that I preach long enough look into the marriage relationship a real relationship actually begins after the lifting of the veil there's where the real relationship starts amen that becomes then a three- room house we're not sitting on the porch amen we've got the kitchen we've got the living room to Fellowship in and we've got a bedroom for relationship I hope that's acceptable wording and so this is my brother and sister the same with the Lord amen If this relationship with the Lord if that Veil is not lifted are you with me if that Veil is not lifted and placed upon Christ we don't have a relationship we have religion that's right I don't want religion I want a relation ship the word of God says that we are the bride of Christ we're not roommates we're not friends with benefits sorry to say it that way we're not people just cohabitating we are a very portion of him by the word amen amen but I'll tell you what happens this world that we live in what happens is is people settle for less than what God gave them and so there's no depth of the relationship and as it comes and goes and comes and goes they become callous to that that's right no commitment though God slay me I'll trust him until it happens again no sir though God slay me yet I will serve him amen amen see people don't understand when brother Brown made that statement people called it idiotic statement when he said even if I knew God was going to send me to hell I would still serve him they don't understand the depth of a relationship they take it on a carnal level there's no way anybody would do that but I tell you when you ever had the veil lifted and you come face to face with our Lord Jesus Christ and He blesses you you stand there and you know there's nothing else on this earth that is like this relationship with him and I say thank you Lord for that amen and if there's no depth of the relationship then it's just man's decision man's leadership man's understanding amen that's it so I'll get this backwards here but now I don't have to I'll just I'll just go like a we know what brother Brown said about that denominational spirit in leadership right there shouldn't be a person in here that's a believer that doesn't know what he said about that right and I always found it interesting this is a little Mantra of mine a little little whatever I always find it interesting people explaining God who can't even explain themselves I love that I stood and listen to a guy the other day talking about farming to someone and he was talking about well you one of the first things you do is you just go out there and you put these chemicals on the ground that keeps everything but the crop you're growing from growing oh okay I know what kind of farmer you are bankrupt and he went on with his whole thing and I thought you know interesting finally I had to do I said you you grew up on a farm he goes no no I visited my grandfather's farm when I was a kid awesome yeah denominational leadership we I want all you to be good godly people so what we're going to do is almost weekly add a new rule book new page in the book of the things you must do to be a good Christian can you find me scripture we were released from the law can someone say thank you Lord but we weren't released from Christ that's right so people think we're released from the law so I can go do what I want now and God will have Grace that I can become a drunken thieving liar cheating whatever and I'll have Grace no we were released from the law but we weren't released from Christ because we already read the scripture he wrote it on our heart and our heart was there receptive to receive that writing upon it and and that just makes me so happy so you know man's ideas of what God meant we touched on that uh of man's expectations my brother and sister I'll tell you what my expectation as pastor of a church here you know what my expectation of you is are you guys ready for this it's pretty straightforward it's pretty strong read it and believe that's right that's my expectation of you cuz I can tell you what I think you should believe and it won't change you at all but when you read it and believe this is what you should be it will entirely change your whole life because Jesus Christ no man ever or woman ever met Christ face to face the veil lifted met him face to face and walked away the same impossible to do that's right so now you guys hold on okay I've been reading a book it's called the death of a church should had sister VI up here to play a funeral song it was published been studied for a decade previous but published in 1967 I want you to understand that because it tells you the era it tells you the time frame the mentality of religion in America published in 1967 the man who wrote it had a lot of Das I don't know what that stands for DDS LLS ELO I I'm sure they stand for something and he's wrote in this book I read sister Jerry a quotation out of this book and she's like oh my but you see he's explaining why the church is dying and the reason the church is dying is because we have now see this is so powerfully true he said We have replaced man uh the the scripture with man's ideas and then he offers his ideas what we should do to do about that see so while he had it right he didn't have it right what he did is took him out of this controlling spirit and placed him over here in this controlling spirit and said because we have a few less pages in our rule book you're better off you're Freer than you were before and in there he goes through and he starts in and one of the things he says is how they rearranged rearranged the Trinity of the catechism and a few of these things they rearrange the wording all to the detriment of the people and so it's there that we have to understand that the Trinity is not being explained correctly I thought yep you got that right amen the Trinity is not explained correctly but they still believe that you've got three distinct people in one God Common Sense will not even allow you to embrace that we don't understand and it it's powerful and true though well I'm sorry my Bible says that it's in this day that the Mysteries would be fully revealed and you cannot complicate it with big words and more writing and stack it on and stack it on and stack it on and say we have a greater Revelation no my brother and sister I'm not going to go into that but you can go right back to the NAA Council you can go right back in history and it's so blaring and glaring in front of them but they're blinded to it and they want you to be blinded with them we can't explain it but you need to believe it well I'm sorry my brother and sister I'm not going to believe something that's not in the Bible I'm not going to believe something you know I've told it here in the church before amen about how that time we went and and and Jerry's dad wanted to take us through the uh uh uh Metropolitan Museum in in Seattle do you any of remember me telling that story amen okay I can tell it again good it's not just me as an old man forgetting I didn't even want to go we walk in the door uh her dad is a um I don't know a member whatever lifelong member whatever we walk in the door got some guests today my my daughter my son-in-law grandchildren and I walk in there and hanging from the ceiling is an old Buick with holes punched in and plastic pipes pointing every which direction that is awesome art then there was a little sign this is a foundation of abstract art they ain't got a foundation at all man that's not art that's an old car with holes punched and pipes going through it but I tell you what pretty soon we went I remember so distinct can I share all the details you went in the great big foer there restrooms were right here admittance desk here in a big slope stairway or the elevator and you go up and you walk in the room and here is all these marble and granite and whatever all these um statues Buss all these things and I get to the first one I start reading he sucked me right [Applause] in No cameras allowed these things are what what what's the museum the is where they were un loan from estimated to be worth billions of dollars this display they had security laser beams everywhere signs don't even touch the glass No cameras no notebooks no nothing I read the first one and I'm like wow now this is going to sound like I was an unbeliever but this is what happened I'm willing to admit it I read that first plaque and I was like I'm sure they didn't take that out of the church age book it's really the way it was what brother Bram told us brother Trevor just right here I go over the next one I read it next one I read it I read it they're done with the museum I'm still in the first room because there was a sermon engraved in every plaque about how they chose to replace themselves as gods and presented them themselves to the people as Gods because it was either easier to cause the people to follow in that realm than it was to control them as a government you understand what I'm saying they turned them into followers not unruly people they got the masses to want to follow this and they had more Gods second room plaque after plaque after plaque this was God and some of these names you would know just from school and history and time you know they got all these they've got men and they've got women women and they're Gods and they're this and they're that and when I got out of there I was just like Shell Shocked I was like my here was a church age book right here in a museum and everything that was laid out is laid right there in history of how it was and the latest uh more or less the latest stuff of this even brought an element of how they pulled this God and this God and put them together to create this God and that God was considered a righteous man and was it NAA let's run it through the filter how far will it go will that get you through the veil no it won't but you see let me get back to my thought here see it was a diagnosis of the cause of the failure of the church I told you I I read some of that to Sister Jerry and she's like that don't even make sense but but it's a pretty good sized book see he warns he says you know what happens when you get away from the word h you you go away from the word you you you go and you'll believe it says it right here in this book when you get away from the word you'll believe anything and then turns around and builds a foundation of why this is what they should be believing and it's not in the word talk about spirits okay I'm going to drop the balm shell on you here and then I'll hurry out so nobody can anyway see when you get away from the word well when you start going away from the argument here's an argument what's the absolute come on I want to throw this out here I don't mean to offend anybody here today but what's the absolute what the prophet say the absolute was what do leaders in this message say the absolute is that's right that quieted y'all down is this any different than how the church died or NAA You' got another substitute what do we do we rewrite the Bible in Kinder terms this is why we have so many versions of the Bible they keep rewriting it to soften it slowly not quickly they want it to come in such a fashion that people don't even realize there's no power left in the word that they're reading amen so they rewrite it to kinder terms and and they reconstruct these are words that I read here not my words they reconstruct the Bible to make it acceptable I want to know my brother and sister what is not acceptable about this what is not amen it calls Sin Sin it calls Glory Glory it calls righteous righteous amen it calls a all the other negatives it calls them what they are the positive it calls them what they are amen will this will the word go through God's filter it is the filter amen so if we soften this you know I I'll get carried away here forgive me my dad worked in a Cheese plant in the later years of his life his working life they were constantly exploring different things of ways to make cheese and they would also go in there and dig out the Vats when it didn't work my brother and sister when you pour something besides the word into the pride you can't dig it out when you put that in there it takes a holy ghost move in a man or woman's life to draw those traditions of men back out to draw all of that nanism and all of this stuff it takes to draw this all out you know they have to come up with words to fit it you know if you believe there's one God you're you're modalist why don't they just say one God because they need a word in their language to express it and then they throw that out like it's an insult you don't believe you're this and you're that you're a cult well praise God I am definition of a cult someone following someone right that's the real Street version of a cult I'm so glad I follow Jesus that's right amen I'm so glad that I'm following him amen while they themselves church was started by someone amen they can't see that now now the Bible translations I'm closing up here we're seeing everything he spoke come to pass amen let's not be blinded by our busyness of life and the cares of Life Saints we are seeing this come to pass right before our eyes come on I I I say this kind of funny hope it doesn't offend anybody but you know there was a brother one time says well I don't quite see it but do you think that Camala Harris might be that beautiful woman brother brand was talking about and I said absolutely not amen that's no that's that can't be brother just change your thinking he was like you're right but you see what's happening that scares me I'm reading a book about the death of a church and what scared me Saints is when I read certain lines I was like there it is is that's right I read more few more pages another chapter it's already come it's it's already here that's what scared me we're not looking oh this will come someday no no here's a denominational man with more titles behind his name than I can even remember telling you this is what's happening and I see it you wonder if it's close or not you see we're working to make the message more acceptable we're also making it more convenient yeah right don't even have to leave your house on Sunday or your tent or your motor home or your boat right wait I'm probably the only one here that has a boat we'll retract that no it's the truth that's right it's the truth Saints yes amen and what I read it scares me the very things they write about I see in our midst that's right now that I've given you this Downer I want to close sister V could come the piano so that way brother Paul will shut up amen look what's happened leave all that negative behind you there's a bride who's taken her veil and she's pinned it that's right on his shoulder she's standing here today in the year 2024 under influence of a word and said I place all my trust in you you are going to be my provider you're going to be everything to me and I'm pinning my veil because you see when we pin our Veil on his shoulder he then can see us clearly and we can see him clearly there's no more Veil that's cloudy it's not my brother and sister as it is a sea of Crystal it's no longer it is clear amen it is before us it is clear amen amen and you know what's better than that Hallelujah when I went to pin my veil when you went to pin your Veil he accepted it amen that's it he didn't say whoa I don't want your Veil he said here pin it on my shoulder I'll take care of you amen I'll be the answer to your question I'll be your strength when you are weak I will feed you when you need fed I will clothe you in my word I will wash you in my blood I will do everything that needs done for you that's right amen that's right oh hallelujah oh next word on my page says to be continued with a little man in the Halo amen wow I guess I should follow my notes shouldn't I Hallelujah let's stand and sing a song just beyond the veil 348 I've been singing this song I never did finish that in the start did I I'm hoping that me being consumed in this of being Beyond the Veil I I don't know you know to be absent in the flesh is to be with the Lord amen I don't know I I I was thinking about that am I am I falling in something like brother Gideon I don't know you know but I just I want know what it looks like Beyond the Veil what am I going to see there who am I going to see most of all I want to see him amen because I have given him my veil he is now clearly mine and I am clearly his isn't it good to be a Christian amen I can place all of my all of my trust all my confidence all of my needs everything I need my Lord Jesus amen when I can go pardon me for my mind thinking this way but you know I'll be there one day and when I see him
