[32:49] Something that we did not deserve, but
[32:51] he says, "I've come for you. I've paid a
[32:54] price. You're no longer of this world,
[32:56] but you belong to a heavenly kingdom.
[32:59] You're my child. Oh, thank you, Lord. We
[33:03] have so much to thank you for, Lord.
[33:06] Just ask you, Father, just touch each
[33:08] and everyone today, Lord. Let us know
[33:10] with true appreciation, Father, what
[33:13] you've done for us. How we bless your
[33:15] holy name. You're worthy, Father. Worthy
[33:19] of all of our praise. You're worthy of
[33:21] our lives, Lord. Father, we just come

[33:26] desiring to hear from you, Lord, that
[33:28] you would just speak, Father, through
[33:30] your word to each heart, Lord, how we
[33:33] love you and adore you. Oh, Father, we
[33:36] thank you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[33:40] Hallelujah.
[33:41] Good to be in the house of the Lord
[33:43] today. Amen. Very happy. our dear
[33:47] friends, brother Jeremy and sister
[33:48] Emily, God bless you all the way down
[33:51] from the uh Washington, British Columbia
[33:54] area up there and uh thankful for them.
[33:57] Brother Moses, God bless you, my friend.
[34:00] We finally are going to connect. Amen.
[34:02] Sister Denell, Job, God bless each and
[34:05] every one of you to see and uh uh we
[34:09] just uh are very thankful for all that
[34:11] the Lord has done. And uh we have we
[34:15] didn't sufficiently greet them this last
[34:18] week, but um our sister Helen and her
[34:21] children. Amen. We're just happy to have
[34:23] them here with us. And I have the
[34:26] workbooks for for the the kids that we

[34:35] friend Cody and his mother, Sister Lois.
[34:39] Amen. So happy to see them back again.
[34:42] And each one, brother Daniel, just
[34:44] thankful in my heart today. There's a
[34:46] body of believers of people who are
[34:47] responding to the word of God. You
[34:50] didn't come because the preaching so
[34:51] great. There's greater preachers out
[34:53] here. Maybe even just down the street,
[34:55] men that are more gifted. But you know,
[34:58] is it that is a saying that I've held to
[35:00] a long time. What it takes to catch the
[35:02] people is what it will take to keep the
[35:04] people. And great preaching, my brother
[35:06] and sister, is good for a season. But if
[35:08] we have not overcome the world, the
[35:11] preaching won't overcome it for us. We
[35:14] have to have the very presence, the very
[35:16] spirit, the Holy Ghost in us is the only
[35:19] way we're going to overcome this world.
[35:22] Amen. But I thank God because he has
[35:25] given us the ability to receive the
[35:27] word. Can we say amen to that this
[35:28] morning? Amen. It's that ability to say
[35:31] amen to the word that will change our
[35:34] lives. Amen. Sometimes it might hurt a
[35:36] little bit and and we'll think, "Oh,
[35:38] that's that's difficult." But there's
[35:40] something inside of us that can't help
[35:42] but say, "Amen." So be it in my life,
[35:45] Lord. And so thankful to be here today.
[35:48] Amen. God bless you. Amen. I just want
[35:51] to bring uh greetings to you from
[35:53] Brother Jonah
[35:55] up in Colona. Brother Jonah is just such
[35:59] a faithful brother. every Sunday morning

[36:04] appreciate that. He's always just
[36:06] encouraging. He just wants to encourage.
[36:08] Amen. And so, greetings from Brother
[36:10] Jonah. Brother Jose brings greetings to
[36:13] you also this morning. Amen. We just

[36:39] So uh we will give you an update and
[36:41] that reminds me sister Helen we should
[36:44] get your info to uh get you shared onto
[36:48] the church WhatsApp. Amen. so that you
[36:50] will be able to see or hear what is uh
[36:54] maybe happening birthdays and different
[36:56] things. Amen. Once again, is it good to
[36:59] be here?
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I want to talk to you
[37:03] this morning on the bride's position
[37:06] part two. Uh I didn't I didn't change
[37:10] the title, but thank you so much. Love
[37:13] the song service this morning. Spoke to
[37:15] my heart. So, we're talking about the
[37:16] bride's position, but we're also, if it
[37:19] would be a secondary title, uh, the two
[37:22] natures. And, uh, so we'll look at this,
[37:24] the two natures within the bride. Amen.
[37:27] Because we'll we'll identify that as we
[37:29] go. But you see, everything that we're
[37:31] doing on the earth today has a
[37:33] counterpart. So, there's a bride here
[37:35] this morning, uh, worshiping the Lord,
[37:37] thankful to be in the house of God and
[37:39] give praise. But there's a counter type
[37:42] that is here that is uh in their own way
[37:45] worshiping, in their own way giving what
[37:47] they could give. And uh we certainly
[37:49] don't want to look down on them. What we
[37:51] should do is thank God that he has
[37:54] opened our eyes to see who we are.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles
[38:00] this morning to the book of Esther, the
[38:02] first chapter. I want to read verses
[38:05] 9-2. Now, this might be a little bit
[38:08] direct, but my brother and sister, it
[38:10] doesn't get any more direct than this
[38:12] right here. Amen. It it really the Bible
[38:16] just lays it out so clearly before us
[38:19] that there are a people that will choose
[38:22] to sacrifice their life for Christ.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; And there is a people who will choose to
[38:28] sacrifice their life for Lucifer.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; And it's pretty straightforward. We
[38:34] don't like to hear that kind of thing.
[38:36] We'd like to think everyone would be
[38:37] saved, but that's not what this says.
[38:40] Amen. There's a decision to be made and
[38:43] there's a calling to be followed. And I
[38:45] thank God that we have been called.
[38:47] Amen.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Also, Vashi the queen made a feast for
[38:52] the women in the royal house which
[38:54] belonged to King Ahazarus.
[38:57] And on the seventh day, when the heart
[38:59] of the king was merry with wine, he
[39:02] commanded, now I always mess these up,
[39:05] so you guys just pronounce them to
[39:06] yourself, okay? Uh, Meime, Bisna,
[39:11] Harbona, Bigtha, A, Abaga, Zether,
[39:16] Carcass, Carcass, the seven Chamberlains
[39:20] that served in the presence of Ahazerus
[39:22] the king to bring Vashi the queen before
[39:26] the king
[39:31] before the king with crown royal to show
[39:34] the people and the princes her beauty.
[39:37] for she was fair to look on. But the
[39:40] queen Vashi refused to come at the
[39:42] king's commandment by his chamberlains.
[39:45] Therefore was the king very wroth and
[39:48] his anger burned in him. Heavenly
[39:51] Father, we ask you to just come this
[39:53] morning, Lord. Speak to us. Father, let
[39:55] this just rest in our soul. May we view
[39:58] this, Lord, that is being spoken this
[40:00] morning in the positive light. For Lord,
[40:02] we are not the ones that were called to
[40:04] refuse your calling, but we are the ones
[40:07] here that are able by the word of God,
[40:10] by your presence in our lives, we're
[40:12] able to respond to the call. And we are
[40:15] so thankful for that. We ask for your
[40:17] guiding hand this morning in the name of
[40:19] Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated,
[40:22] saints.
[40:28] Maybe you could just say a little prayer
[40:30] for me. It just seemed like after we
[40:32] were on our way to church this morning,
[40:33] my throat started tickling and my nose
[40:36] started running. And I think the devil
[40:39] just just didn't want us to enjoy
[40:41] ourselves in the house of God today.
[40:43] Well, we're going to enjoy ourselves.
[40:45] Amen. So, as we look at this, I want to
[40:49] just bring to you the definition of a
[40:50] chamberlain to start off with so you can
[40:53] understand kind of the direction that
[40:55] I'm heading today. A chamberlain is an
[40:58] officer who manages the household of a
[41:00] monarch or noble. Amen. And this is my
[41:03] words. Maybe we could go as far as to
[41:05] say he's a minister or a pastor. Amen.
[41:09] So there it is. Because we are in the
[41:11] house of God. Amen. We are part of his
[41:13] house, part of his kingdom. And so we
[41:16] look at this and we'll say that today
[41:18] we're going to be looking at the story
[41:20] of two brides. Amen. And we can see how
[41:24] that this plays out. the very difference
[41:26] there is. And Vashi, she's taking uh uh
[41:30] uh what was given to her uh opportunity.
[41:32] She's having a feast for all the women
[41:35] in the royal house. And it's there that
[41:38] this comes. And I I don't know if you
[41:40] want to really go into typology here,
[41:43] but on the seventh day. Amen. It wasn't
[41:46] on the 5th or the 8th or the 9th, but on
[41:48] the seventh day. And I believe it's just
[41:51] fair to type this out to the church ages
[41:53] that in the seventh church age, amen,
[41:56] the heart of the king was Mary. Now the
[41:59] Lord Jesus Christ, our our heavenly
[42:01] father does not need wine to be happy.
[42:04] Amen. He does not need to to uh uh uh
[42:07] you know in bib as it would to to come
[42:10] to that place. But our God is actually a
[42:13] very happy God. Some people read the
[42:14] Bible and say I couldn't follow. I read
[42:17] this commentary. Amen. Says, "I just
[42:18] couldn't uh really follow Christianity
[42:21] because our God is angry all the time."
[42:23] Now, when I read my Bible, I am not
[42:26] reading a Bible that says, "My God is
[42:28] angry all the time." Amen. But I'm
[42:31] sitting here today knowing that when the
[42:33] Lord hears the praise of his saints and
[42:36] hears our prayers come as a sweet odor
[42:38] before him, he's not angry over that.
[42:41] He's actually blessed. Amen. He's
[42:43] saying, "This is my children and and
[42:45] they're they're speaking to me. They
[42:47] care about what I've said and and
[42:49] they're asking my advice. They want my
[42:51] counsel. I don't think that's an angry
[42:53] God. Amen. So, it's there that we see
[42:56] this feast had been made. And this story
[42:59] is now as I started and got distracted
[43:02] there, it's a story of two brides. Amen.
[43:05] We must remember that we'll see how it
[43:08] is that one while enjoying all the
[43:10] benefits of the kingdom. Amen. She
[43:13] decided she would do as she saw fit. And
[43:16] I'm I'm going to be blunt this morning.
[43:19] That's really where a lot of
[43:21] denominations have gone in the day that
[43:23] we live in. They are doing as they see
[43:26] fit. And I won't go into all the details
[43:29] lest we would become uh not so happy
[43:32] this morning. But I think you can sort
[43:34] that out for yourself that and see where
[43:36] the churches are diverging from the word
[43:39] of God. They they've accepted all kinds
[43:41] of ideas and all kinds of things. And
[43:44] you know there is um there is a a a an
[43:47] aspect of where today we have accepted
[43:50] into many churches the ideas of of
[43:54] different thoughts that were all through
[43:56] the ages. You remember that Nika was
[43:58] actually a a merging together of the
[44:02] ideas of what would make up
[44:04] Christianity. They say and maybe rightly
[44:07] so. They say Nika was the foundation of
[44:10] the Christian experience. But my brother
[44:13] and sister, it was Nika that the Lord
[44:16] Jesus come down and absolutely separated
[44:19] the true believer from the the uh the
[44:22] watered down and added to and taken away
[44:24] from uh word that they would call true
[44:28] Christian biblical standards. And so we
[44:31] we look at this and I I don't want to be
[44:33] too harsh this morning. Certainly as you
[44:35] study you you go into different paths.
[44:38] And my brother and sister, in the day
[44:40] that we're living in almost anything
[44:42] could be considered Christianity today.
[44:45] If you just believe that there is a God,
[44:48] you're a Christian. But my brother and
[44:50] sister, we're living in a day that there
[44:51] is a standard that God has given out of
[44:54] his word to a people. And that standard
[44:56] is causing these people to to rise up to
[44:59] the level God called them to, not the
[45:02] level the church called them to. So the
[45:04] word of God has come in this hour
[45:07] because we are in the seventh day and
[45:09] the king's heart is Mary. Amen. And he's
[45:12] calling forth a bride to come and he
[45:15] wanted to display her. Now it it seems,
[45:18] you know, to some they have ideas of
[45:21] exactly what it was. There's all kinds
[45:24] of myths and I don't encourage you to go
[45:26] look it up. But you know, I'll just show
[45:28] you how blunt or perverted the world can
[45:30] be. There are some that say, "Well, the
[45:31] king wanted Vashi. She was so beautiful
[45:34] to dance naked before the people." But
[45:36] I'm telling you, my brother and sister,
[45:38] that is not a type of the true bride of
[45:40] Christ. We're not going to be dancing
[45:43] naked before anyone. Now, I put that
[45:45] forth so you'll catch a little later,
[45:47] amen, in our thought that is there. But
[45:50] here it is. They call for Vashi, but
[45:52] she's in the midst of her own party.
[45:54] She's in a place, her own endeavor, you
[45:57] might say, and and uh she's she's doing
[46:00] what she was felt led to do. And she had
[46:03] all of the ladies together. Now, it was
[46:07] there in her endeavor. She is having
[46:09] this party. She is herself now
[46:12] representing herself as an authority, as
[46:15] someone that's a leader amongst the
[46:17] people, amongst the women. And we know
[46:19] that a woman represents the church.
[46:22] Amen. So she had her own ministry. She
[46:25] had her own following. And so it was
[46:28] there that she just didn't have time.
[46:30] She was busy. She saw herself as
[46:32] important. And it's there that she was
[46:35] focused on pleasing herself. Now, a
[46:38] little later, you'll be able to see
[46:39] where we tie this together. Amen. But
[46:42] she was focused on pleasing herself.
[46:44] This party was not as much for the
[46:46] guests as it was for Vashi.
[46:50] It elevated her and showed that she was
[46:52] in a position of authority that she had
[46:54] the ability to entertain or draw the
[46:57] people. Amen. So she was focused on
[47:00] pleasing herself and she actually saw no
[47:03] greater picture than herself.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; When the Chamberlains come and said,
[47:09] "The king wants you." She said, "I have
[47:12] my own schedule. I have my own ideas. I
[47:16] have my own position. I'm in my
[47:18] position. I'm doing what I want to do. I
[47:22] I I'm fulfilling my agenda," you might
[47:24] say. And and so therefore, she said, "I
[47:27] I don't have a greater calling." In
[47:29] other words, when the king calls for me,
[47:31] that is not greater than my own calling.
[47:34] Amen. I want you to think about this,
[47:36] not as history, but of the day that
[47:38] we're living in. Amen. So we'll see that
[47:41] she was in a position of giving glory to
[47:44] herself. She was the main attraction of
[47:48] this banquet. And so we'll see today
[47:51] just for a moment the nature of the two
[47:54] brides. Amen. Now we know that all
[47:56] through the scripture there's twins,
[47:58] right? The there's always the good and
[48:00] the evil, the righteous and the
[48:02] unrighteous. We can go right on down the
[48:04] list. It's there that we'll see that
[48:07] that this position that she was in, she
[48:11] was expressing a nature. Now, that
[48:14] nature was not a nature, my brother and
[48:16] sister, that that would be such that it
[48:19] would be that the wife, the bride is a
[48:22] doormat to the king, absolutely not. We
[48:25] as Christians, my brother and sister, if
[48:26] the preaching of the word makes you feel
[48:28] like a doormat, either somebody's not
[48:30] preaching it to you correctly or you're
[48:33] not receiving it correctly. Amen. We are
[48:36] not doormats. We are the bride of Jesus
[48:38] Christ. And in the natural, any man who
[48:41] would not stand up and defend his bride
[48:44] is not a man at all. And our God, Amen,
[48:47] is here. He's righteous. He's holy. And
[48:49] he's here to defend his bride in this
[48:52] day. Amen. All you have to do is test
[48:55] him and ask and say, "Lord, I need you
[48:57] to come on this scene." And he will come
[48:59] on this scene, my brother and sister.
[49:01] Amen. When we are some midnight hours,
[49:03] the song says, "Amen. If you'll find
[49:06] you're in a prison in your mind and call
[49:08] out his name, he's right there waiting
[49:11] to hear you call and say, "I need your
[49:13] help. Come and speak to me. Come and
[49:16] deal with me."
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't believe any one of us
[49:19] this morning can say that our God has
[49:21] failed to defend us.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:26] So,
[49:28] one is given over to her own thoughts
[49:31] and her own values.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; I think it would bear well not this
[49:38] morning to drag it out, but for us to
[49:40] take time to see what is it is our
[49:42] values.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Or we could take it in a slightly
[49:46] different deal. What do we value?
[49:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:49] Now, the scripture says that a Christian
[49:53] is going to be washed in the blood of
[49:56] the lamb.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Do we value that?
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are are we willing to take what it
[50:01] t to do what it takes to be washed in
[50:04] the blood of the lamb? Amen. And as
[50:07] we're going to to communion tonight,
[50:09] Amen. We have to be washed in that
[50:11] blood, my brother and sister. We can't
[50:13] just come willy-nilly and and just say,
[50:15] "Well, God understands. I I have a
[50:18] temper and I I have this and I have
[50:20] that. God's not going to understand
[50:22] because he's given you a way to overcome
[50:24] that.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's given us a way of escape in
[50:27] the hour that we live in. Amen. And it
[50:30] doesn't matter what we're dealing with.
[50:32] Amen. But if you're given over to your
[50:34] own thoughts,
[50:35] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; We can explain almost anything away in
[50:39] our life. I was justified to behave the
[50:41] way I behaved. I was justified to say
[50:44] what I said. I was justified to do what
[50:46] I did. My brother and sister, we can
[50:49] justify anything. But what we want is
[50:51] the blood of Jesus Christ to come down,
[50:53] the Holy Spirit to come down on us and
[50:56] justify us. Not by our own means, not by
[50:59] your own ability, but by his word coming
[51:02] down, changing us and say, "It is my
[51:05] blood that makes it just as though you
[51:08] never did it in the first place." Amen.
[51:10] There is no self-righteous behavior, no
[51:13] ability of our own that can bring us to
[51:16] a place that we could say I am
[51:18] justified. It is only by the blood of
[51:21] Jesus Christ.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So she had her own values and her
[51:28] own sense of importance.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Now
[51:32] I don't want to sound contradictory but
[51:34] you should maintain your own self of
[51:37] position, your own sense of importance.
[51:40] You really should.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; And the reason I say that is not your
[51:44] opinion, not this and not that, but your
[51:48] importance. When you lose what you are
[51:52] in the kingdom of God, when you lose
[51:55] what you are in the economy of God, and
[51:57] you don't see yourself as important, you
[52:00] just see yourself as someone just
[52:02] wandering through life, just I'm of no
[52:04] importance. Nobody really cares about
[52:06] me. that is ripe for Satan to come and
[52:10] put something into your life that would
[52:12] be there seemingly important. But you
[52:15] need to know what your own importance
[52:17] is. And I'll put it this way just to
[52:19] keep this simple. I am a part of the
[52:22] bride of Jesus Christ. And you cannot
[52:25] take a rapture without me.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; That's not a boast, my brother and
[52:30] sister. That's a recognition of the
[52:32] importance that you have in the economy
[52:34] of God. to recognize that God did not
[52:37] come along and say, "Oh, they missed the
[52:39] bus. I don't care." He's here to say, "I
[52:42] never lost a one." You can't miss the
[52:44] bus.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God might take you through hard
[52:48] trials. He might take you through things
[52:50] that you wished you didn't have to go
[52:52] through, but he will have you prepared
[52:54] to be able to take a rapture. Amen.
[52:57] We're not here not called of God, not
[53:00] desiring to serve God, not desiring to
[53:02] be found faithful to be tossed away at
[53:05] the end like a scrap. But you are
[53:07] important in the economy of God.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; But when we have our own sense of
[53:11] importance on the other side, but what I
[53:14] think is more important than what you
[53:16] think, what I think is more important
[53:18] than what the word says,
[53:21] &gt;&gt; I'm more important than the calling of
[53:23] God. my brother and sister, that's a
[53:26] wrong spirit.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. She had this sense of importance
[53:30] and she had her own ideas what pleasure
[53:32] was.
[53:34] Now, if I could put it to you this way,
[53:36] I don't mean to be too awfully stark,
[53:38] but there'll be people today that will
[53:41] get drunk
[53:42] and they'll say, "It was fun. It was
[53:44] good. We had pleasure."
[53:48] And there's another people today that
[53:50] will come in the presence of almighty
[53:51] God, the Holy Spirit moving in their
[53:54] life today and say, "Oh, how pleasing,
[53:58] how pleasure it was to be in the
[54:00] presence of God today." So, we're seeing
[54:03] that is entirely different uh uh mode,
[54:06] you might say, of pleasure. how people
[54:08] would judge that.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; She was finding her own pleasure
[54:19] to be one that was subject to no higher
[54:22] calling.
[54:24] And in this place, we'll put it as a
[54:26] natural. It it folds over into the
[54:28] spiritual. But actually, in all reality,
[54:31] as we'll see the story unfold, there was
[54:33] no higher calling in her life than the
[54:37] call of her king.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. No, no higher calling. There
[54:42] should have been nothing that that uh
[54:44] rung more true to her than the king
[54:46] saying, "I want you to come and I I want
[54:49] to put you on display." Now, lest you
[54:53] would have an idea that that him putting
[54:55] her on display, you know, sounds
[54:57] awkward, uh, we'll we'll deal with that
[54:59] a little further by God's grace in the
[55:01] service. Amen. So, she had her sense of
[55:04] importance. She had her own idea what
[55:06] pleasure was. But what was happening the
[55:09] old time there with Vashi is she was
[55:12] actually sewing the seed of rebellion
[55:16] amongst all of these women. Now, these
[55:18] weren't just common from the street
[55:19] people. These were the leaders wives.
[55:22] These were important people in the
[55:25] kingdom, their wives. And she was
[55:27] actually sowing rebellion in the midst
[55:29] of those people. And my brother and
[55:31] sister, the scripture, uh, jump ahead a
[55:34] little bit, but my brother and sister,
[55:36] it says that that old harlot had
[55:38] daughters.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when those daughters come, my
[55:42] brother and sister, they for a season
[55:44] had liberty from the spirit of rebellion
[55:47] that they come out of. But they never
[55:49] got fully shed of that. And that spirit
[55:52] came back and they have found themselves
[55:55] now once again being courted by the
[55:58] mother. Amen. And Na's daughters are
[56:01] being drawn back into it. There's some
[56:03] videos out there uh that we have come
[56:05] across, we have watched, looked at. My
[56:08] brother and sister, they even come to
[56:10] the words to say, "We're coming back to
[56:12] mama."
[56:14] Now my I'm telling you my brother and
[56:16] sister, we are not coming back to mama.
[56:19] Amen. We've got a heavenly father. Amen.
[56:21] A holy spirit that come down. We don't
[56:24] need a substitute in our life. We've got
[56:27] the original. We've got the life. We've
[56:29] got the nature. We've got the spirit.
[56:31] Amen. We've got what God wants us to
[56:33] have. We don't have to go back to a
[56:36] mother church to find it.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you've lost your way and
[56:41] you don't know who you are and you don't
[56:43] know your importance, you might well go
[56:45] right back to mother because at least
[56:47] there's a stability. Mother's been
[56:49] around a long time. Mother's was uh you
[56:52] know went through a lot of storms and
[56:54] she's still here and she's still stable
[56:56] and after all that's where we all come
[56:58] from. Isn't that a tricky lie of the
[57:00] devil? That's where we all come from. My
[57:03] brother and sister, I never came from
[57:04] there. You didn't come from there. We
[57:07] come straight from the throne of God.
[57:09] Amen. We bypassed our theophony and come
[57:11] right down on the earth to test and to
[57:14] share the gospel. Amen. Called to be
[57:17] witnesses of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Now look, if you think I'm being harsh
[57:22] about that, all you do just go study
[57:24] some history of the churches and you'll
[57:26] find, my brother and sister, that when
[57:27] they went away, there was great liberty.
[57:29] Amen. Luther come and said, "The just
[57:31] shall live by faith." That was such a
[57:34] startling revelation in the hour it was.
[57:36] But my brother and sister, so many
[57:38] churches today don't even believe the
[57:40] just should live by faith. They want you
[57:42] to live by their creed, their dogma.
[57:44] They want you to live by their
[57:45] tradition, not by faith. Amen. Faith
[57:48] takes us out in the place that a
[57:51] denominational spirit can't walk.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I say denominal
[57:56] denominational spirit, I'm talking about
[57:58] man telling man how to serve God. It's
[58:01] not man telling man how to serve God.
[58:03] It's the Holy Spirit using man to tell
[58:06] us how to serve God. In other words, if
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Vashi had listened to the Chamberlains,
[58:12] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[58:13] &gt;&gt; she would have been able to say, "I've
[58:16] heard the voice
[58:17] &gt;&gt; of the Chamberlain,
[58:19] &gt;&gt; the voice of my king,
[58:22] &gt;&gt; my husband."
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. The chamberlain was only carrying
[58:26] a message.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; He was not the authority. Otherwise,
[58:30] they would have made her gone. Now, if
[58:32] they were the authorities, trust me,
[58:34] when you have the bodyguard type, they
[58:36] would come out there and they would
[58:37] latch on to her and they would have
[58:39] drugged her, maybe kicking and screaming
[58:41] to the king. But they didn't have that
[58:43] authority. All they do is have authority
[58:46] to carry the message. And when the
[58:48] message is delivered, their
[58:49] responsibility is over. And it's up to
[58:52] the one who received the message or
[58:54] heard the message. Maybe they did not
[58:56] receive it, but they heard the message.
[58:58] Amen. and decided to reject it. Amen.
[59:02] So, you see what happens here is the
[59:04] council to the king. He comes along and
[59:07] and they're they're they're talking, you
[59:09] know, uh King Hazarus is is very upset.
[59:13] I mean, obviously his wife has snubbed
[59:14] him in public, right?
[59:16] &gt;&gt; And now, let's just take that in the
[59:18] natural. Amen. Probably every marriage
[59:20] has had a time where the husband or the
[59:22] wife gouged their spouse in public. Can
[59:26] we say amen?
[59:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; But because we're all in unity on that
[59:36] thought, does that make it right?
[59:39] &gt;&gt; No. And because somebody laughed, did
[59:42] that make it right?
[59:46] Because it made us feel good,
[59:48] &gt;&gt; did that make it right?
[59:52] Every one of these are systemic from
[59:54] this spirit that was on Vashi. That's
[59:56] right. It
[59:57] &gt;&gt; just shows you those spirits don't die.
[59:59] That's right.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Those spirits are still on the earth
[1:00:01] today. Amen. So you look at this. So the
[1:00:04] council to the king, we'd have to
[1:00:06] believe that they were wise men. They
[1:00:08] had, you know, good, sound thoughts. And
[1:00:10] they told the king, you know, you really
[1:00:12] should do something about this. And
[1:00:14] unless it would spread through the whole
[1:00:15] church, I mean, the whole kingdom. Amen.
[1:00:18] you you you need to do something about
[1:00:19] this because if this is allowed to go
[1:00:22] on, well,
[1:00:25] the reason I'm giving you this advice,
[1:00:27] dear king, is my wife's sitting over
[1:00:29] there in that banquet, and if she
[1:00:31] catches that, I'm going to end up being
[1:00:33] snubbed and mocked just like you are,
[1:00:36] and I don't want that to happen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; It's called influence.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; But I believe that they had more thought
[1:00:43] than that. They weren't just thinking
[1:00:44] about what their wife might act like
[1:00:46] when she come back from the banquet. But
[1:00:49] imagine a whole kingdom.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Imagine
[1:00:54] on the seventh day.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; What the kingdom would look like.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; And their advice is is you're going to
[1:01:07] have to stop this this rebellion.
[1:01:11] You're going to have to do something
[1:01:12] about it.
[1:01:14] But a little bit contrary, my brother
[1:01:16] and sister, to what we're going to be
[1:01:18] speaking today is
[1:01:21] the parable of the wheat
[1:01:24] where Jesus told them, "Let the tear
[1:01:27] grow up with the wheat." That's why we
[1:01:30] see that those spirits are still here in
[1:01:33] the land today is because while Vashi
[1:01:36] was put out of being the queen, the
[1:01:39] spirit of rebellion was not done away
[1:01:42] with.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Because God's plan actually needed that
[1:01:47] to come to, as you would say, be a
[1:01:50] separator,
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; the sifting.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So as it is, we'll see that they
[1:01:57] come, they give counsel to the king, and
[1:02:00] they're telling him unless this would
[1:02:02] would become an issue in the kingdom
[1:02:04] amongst all of the women in the kingdom,
[1:02:07] uh, you need to do something. And and
[1:02:09] what can we do? Do we publicly fogg a
[1:02:12] queen?
[1:02:13] Do we lock her, as it is in all the old
[1:02:17] medieval times, you know,
[1:02:20] the wicked witch, as it were, locked in
[1:02:22] the tower of the castle?
[1:02:25] No, she'd still scream her message
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; from the open window.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; So, the only thing that the advice of
[1:02:34] his counselors were is you need to
[1:02:36] remove her from her position.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; And by removing her from her position,
[1:02:43] they will realize that this is not
[1:02:44] acceptable behavior.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; And so, we'll look and see. And there's
[1:02:49] so many types, so many avenues off of
[1:02:51] this today that there's no way I can do
[1:02:54] more than just touch the edge of them.
[1:02:56] But you see, he he took the counsel
[1:02:59] because he was worried about this
[1:03:00] spreading in his kingdom. And uh they
[1:03:04] remove Vashi from being queen. Now, my
[1:03:06] brother and sister, uh as simple as the
[1:03:08] scripture makes that look, it's a lot
[1:03:11] easier to put someone in a position than
[1:03:13] it is to take them out of the position.
[1:03:16] And so here is Vashy, the queen. It it
[1:03:19] was a shock to the kingdom that she was
[1:03:23] being removed from queen. After all, she
[1:03:25] was the most fashionable queen they had
[1:03:27] ever had, the most uh known, most
[1:03:30] recognized on the cover of more uh
[1:03:33] tabloids than any other. She was
[1:03:36] representative of the age and that
[1:03:38] spirit. And and you know, it's very
[1:03:41] strong those spirits, my brother and
[1:03:42] sister. We'll look at that and recognize
[1:03:45] that in the fashion world, I hope this
[1:03:46] isn't so in the church, unless we're
[1:03:48] talking positive. But in the fashion
[1:03:50] world, they come out here and if the the
[1:03:53] people wear less, then the world follows
[1:03:56] them and wears less. If they wear
[1:03:58] something that is shocking, then the
[1:04:01] world follows with something that is
[1:04:02] shocking. That's the nature of humanity.
[1:04:05] That's the nature of the spirit of the
[1:04:07] day that we live in. And it's there that
[1:04:10] we'll see this. That is in the nature of
[1:04:12] the church.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; And as the church would come and the
[1:04:15] farther it gets away from the word and
[1:04:17] the greater depth the spirit of
[1:04:18] rebellion comes into the church, it it
[1:04:21] will be there that my brother and
[1:04:22] sister, they don't see it as rebellion
[1:04:24] because everywhere they look, they're
[1:04:25] alike. That's right.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; That's why you as Bible believing
[1:04:30] holinessminded Christians are going to
[1:04:32] be the oddballs are the oddballs of the
[1:04:35] age that we live in because they look
[1:04:38] around and they're all alike but you're
[1:04:40] different.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; So therefore, you must be the one with
[1:04:43] the problem because you're different and
[1:04:46] we're all the same. But you go back
[1:04:48] through your Bible, study your Bible,
[1:04:50] and you'll see that God has always had a
[1:04:53] called out people, a different people, a
[1:04:56] righteous people, a holy people. He
[1:04:59] didn't go out here and say, "I'm just
[1:05:00] going to convert the common man and let
[1:05:03] him stay as he was." But everywhere
[1:05:06] Jesus went, lives changed. Amen. The
[1:05:08] dead come to life. Amen. Leprosy went
[1:05:11] away. The blind could see. Those who
[1:05:13] could not hear could hear. Hearts were
[1:05:16] changed. My brother and sister. Amen.
[1:05:18] Where the gospel of Jesus Christ is
[1:05:20] preached, change happens. It is not just
[1:05:23] we want to change, but something inside
[1:05:26] of you almost causes you, forces you to
[1:05:29] change because you got to follow your
[1:05:31] heart and your heart's not in the
[1:05:33] fashion of religion. Oh, did you know
[1:05:35] that religion has a fashion?
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Religion has a fashion. And if you
[1:05:40] don't believe so, you just go study
[1:05:42] religion as a whole, my brother and
[1:05:44] sister, and you'll see that God will
[1:05:45] subtly break it all around the world,
[1:05:48] the big megaurch behaviors. Oh, this is
[1:05:51] blunt, and I'm sorry. I I wasn't really
[1:05:53] intending to say this, but we're already
[1:05:55] there.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Almost every mega church on the earth
[1:06:00] today is rocked by scandal.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. financial scandal,
[1:06:07] sexual scandal, abuse of people,
[1:06:10] manipulation.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; And yet, not that long ago, they were
[1:06:14] glorified as, "Oh, this is what the
[1:06:17] church has come to." Well, I'll say
[1:06:19] that's what the church has come to
[1:06:21] because in the Bible, it was small. And
[1:06:24] I'm not saying you have to be a little
[1:06:25] church, but it was that mindset. that it
[1:06:27] was that approach spiritually, that
[1:06:29] little small close group that valued
[1:06:32] their relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:06:34] more than they valued their relationship
[1:06:36] on the evening news or out here to the
[1:06:38] neighborhood. Amen. Their relationship
[1:06:40] with Jesus Christ became predominant in
[1:06:43] their life and they followed that.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; But whenever the spirit of rebellion is
[1:06:48] there, they would come and say, "Leave
[1:06:50] us alone."
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Let us be as we desire to be.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. That's right.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; And the sons of God looked on the
[1:07:00] daughters of man and saw that they were
[1:07:02] beautiful. That's
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Don't preach to us."
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Don't preach to us. She believes in God.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Only to find out it was a different God.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; It was a God of fashion.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Is a God of You can go right down the
[1:07:19] list. We won't go there.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; So, look at this.
[1:07:25] We come down to the end of her story.
[1:07:28] She's no longer a queen.
[1:07:31] Now, I'll just put this out here. Don't
[1:07:33] want it to be offensive to you, but I
[1:07:36] don't care what happens. You walk away
[1:07:37] from church today or whatever, and every
[1:07:39] one of you have your own story.
[1:07:41] Brother Paul was way over here out in
[1:07:44] the bushes. He was here. He was too
[1:07:46] harsh. He didn't go hard enough. He this
[1:07:48] and that. Everybody's got their own
[1:07:49] story,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; And look what happened, my brother and
[1:07:52] sister. If you can imagine the vast she
[1:07:55] went on and anyone who would listen she
[1:07:58] told them the king was abusive. That's
[1:08:02] the reason I couldn't go to him is
[1:08:05] because he treated me. The idea that he
[1:08:08] wanted to show me off was repulsive.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll just share something to you.
[1:08:17] prophet of God said, "This bride of
[1:08:19] Jesus Christ is here in her glory for
[1:08:23] the world to see what Christ in the
[1:08:27] flesh looks like."
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; What's God doing? He's showing you off
[1:08:32] as a Christian.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; He's showing you off for who you are and
[1:08:36] your relationship. He doesn't want us to
[1:08:38] blend in like a wallflower. He wants you
[1:08:40] to stand out that he can be able to
[1:08:43] point out in the world today. This is
[1:08:46] what my bride looks like.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us to understand and desire
[1:08:51] and long to be what he would want to
[1:08:54] show off in this world.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Not that he would just pass us over
[1:08:58] looking for something else. But Lord,
[1:09:00] let my life be worthy of this gospel.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Create in me
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; a clean heart and then show that clean
[1:09:11] heart to the world, Lord, to show THAT A
[1:09:14] HEART CAN BE CLEAN IN THE DAY that we
[1:09:16] live in where filth abounds, there can
[1:09:18] be clean hearts.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; And the word said there will be.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look in the parallels here.
[1:09:29] Now,
[1:09:32] this is a word. So I can just read the
[1:09:34] word and you can draw your conclusion.
[1:09:44] Revelation 18
[1:09:46] 1-7.
[1:09:49] And after these things, I saw an another
[1:09:52] angel come down from heaven having great
[1:09:54] power, and the earth was lightened with
[1:09:56] his glory. And he cried mightily with a
[1:09:58] strong voice, saying, Babylon the great
[1:10:01] is fallen, is fallen, and has become the
[1:10:04] habitation of devils and the hold of
[1:10:07] every foul spirit and the cage of every
[1:10:10] unclean and hateful bird
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; for all the nations. My brother and
[1:10:15] sister, this is not talking about some
[1:10:17] little religious movement hid in some
[1:10:19] little corner of a jungle somewhere.
[1:10:22] This is something that affected the
[1:10:23] whole world. And if you'll just stop and
[1:10:26] read your Bible, you can figure out
[1:10:27] exactly who that is. Amen. And where
[1:10:30] they're at. Amen. And so they become a
[1:10:32] habitation, a hold of every foul spirit,
[1:10:35] cage of every unclean, hateful bird. For
[1:10:37] all nations have drunk of the wine of
[1:10:40] the wrath of her fornication. And the
[1:10:42] kings of the earth have committed
[1:10:44] fornication with her. And the merchants
[1:10:46] of the earth are waxed rich through the
[1:10:49] abundance of her delicacies. And I heard
[1:10:52] another voice from heaven saying, "Come
[1:10:54] out of her, my people."
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we that people?
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; We've been called out by the word of
[1:11:00] God. We're not here just to say, "Look,
[1:11:02] we can get along to go along." But my
[1:11:05] brother and sister, we are a called out
[1:11:08] people.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; That you be not partakers of her sins,
[1:11:12] that you receive not of her plagues. For
[1:11:15] her sins have reached into the heaven,
[1:11:17] and God hath remembered her iniquities.
[1:11:19] reward her even as she rewarded you. And
[1:11:22] I'm just going to tell you a little
[1:11:23] something right now. Amen. Now, we've
[1:11:26] been blessed by God's grace to go preach
[1:11:28] in Paraguay to travel almost the length
[1:11:31] of the country. Beautiful time preaching
[1:11:34] going got to be a little bit of a
[1:11:36] tourist sightseer. And we come to these
[1:11:38] places that are out. They're abandoned.
[1:11:40] They're kind of like memorial park
[1:11:42] things now. And uh literally the plaques
[1:11:45] tell the story. And now, if they're
[1:11:48] willing to put it on a plaque, my
[1:11:49] brother and sister, you must think that
[1:11:51] they probably believe it, right? It
[1:11:52] wasn't somebody's whim that they just
[1:11:54] took a little tape and a paper and
[1:11:56] slapped it on something. But they took
[1:11:58] time to cast these. And it tells a story
[1:12:01] about how these great big buildings and
[1:12:04] things were built and and uh I hope
[1:12:06] you're not timid this morning, but the
[1:12:08] Catholic Church come in there. They
[1:12:10] literally enslaved the native people.
[1:12:14] Thousands upon tens of thousands of
[1:12:16] slaves were worked to death to build
[1:12:19] these giant these giant cathedrals, you
[1:12:22] might say, these giant places.
[1:12:25] And then history also shows us how that
[1:12:27] it come a time that Paraguay, the
[1:12:30] government, and the people of Paraguay
[1:12:32] said, "We've had enough.
[1:12:34] You take our gold, you take our
[1:12:36] beautiful young maidens, you take
[1:12:38] everything and and you work the rest of
[1:12:40] us to death. You don't care." and they
[1:12:42] drove the Catholic Church out of
[1:12:44] Paraguay.
[1:12:47] You think, "Oh, that's a good thing."
[1:12:49] But time went on.
[1:12:52] And from that moment in time,
[1:12:55] the role that Paraguay played in that
[1:12:58] region diminished.
[1:13:01] Brazil took some of their land. Oh, we
[1:13:03] say it's not spiritual. Come on, saints.
[1:13:06] I want you to think about the big
[1:13:07] picture.
[1:13:09] Brazil took some of their land and every
[1:13:11] bordering country, Amen. Every bordering
[1:13:15] country took some of their land. They
[1:13:18] are a fraction of what they used to be.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; And you know what? They even today in
[1:13:23] public places will tell you
[1:13:26] it was when we turned our back on the
[1:13:29] Catholic Church. They turned their force
[1:13:32] against us. And we have suffered and
[1:13:36] suffered and suffered every day since.
[1:13:41] There's power.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; There's power, my brother and sister.
[1:13:45] And almost as a treaty because the
[1:13:47] people were suffering under that
[1:13:49] influence so greatly, they actually
[1:13:51] allowed the Catholic Church back into
[1:13:53] their country. And there are many great
[1:13:55] scholars in Paraguay today will tell
[1:13:57] you. And that was our second mistake.
[1:14:01] But I'm telling you, there is the kind
[1:14:03] of power that is welded amongst them.
[1:14:05] How that they are able to come and
[1:14:08] change the course of nations. And let me
[1:14:10] tell you right now, just in case you all
[1:14:12] wonder, go study for yourself the makeup
[1:14:16] of the government of the United States
[1:14:19] today.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Certainly,
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; they're not just good Catholics. They're
[1:14:24] Jesuits.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. And the Jesuits have a
[1:14:27] value system that says that if you are
[1:14:29] not of them, you have no value.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm saying this out pretty blunt,
[1:14:35] but I just want you to understand, we're
[1:14:37] not talking about flesh and blood today.
[1:14:39] We're talking about spirits.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's there that he's declared
[1:14:43] that she's fallen. And it says, "Come
[1:14:45] out of her, my people, that you're not
[1:14:46] partakers of her sins. Receive not of
[1:14:49] her plagues, for her sins have reached
[1:14:51] into heaven, and God had remembered her
[1:14:52] iniquities. Reward her even as she
[1:14:55] rewarded you double into her double
[1:14:57] according to her works in the cup which
[1:14:59] she hath filled filled to her double how
[1:15:03] much she hath glorified herself lived
[1:15:06] deliciously
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; so much torment and sorrow give her for
[1:15:11] she saith in her heart
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; that's it
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; take this back to Vashi
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; I sit a queen
[1:15:20] and am no widow
[1:15:24] Even after Vashi was taken from the
[1:15:26] throne, she still claimed that she was
[1:15:29] the queen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And rightly so,
[1:15:33] but she needed to put it in past tense.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, there's a day this
[1:15:39] is coming. It shall be
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; past tense.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And spiritually, that day has already
[1:15:47] come.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And shall see no sorrow.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look, you can go read your own
[1:15:53] Bible. You can even type into Google,
[1:15:58] what city sits on seven hills.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And even Google can answer that question
[1:16:03] for you.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't want to go waste your
[1:16:08] time to type it in, I'll just give you
[1:16:09] the answer. It's called Rome.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Sits on seven hills.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; The scripture has prophesied that it
[1:16:16] will fall.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; So look at this now.
[1:16:21] being warned to come out. But see, she
[1:16:24] believed she was untouchable.
[1:16:28] I believe Ashy would not have uh acted
[1:16:30] or reacted like she did if she had
[1:16:32] believed that she was vulnerable in her
[1:16:34] position as the queen. But she felt like
[1:16:37] that she was untouchable and become
[1:16:40] aloof to the desires of the king. Now,
[1:16:43] my brother and sister, she was a bride
[1:16:46] that was produced by the spirit of the
[1:16:49] age.
[1:16:50] But there's another spirit in that age,
[1:16:53] and it wasn't in a far off land. It was
[1:16:55] just, you might say, down the street
[1:16:57] from Vashie's house.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Just down the street. Am I Am I too
[1:17:03] direct this morning?
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; So, there was a bride produced by the
[1:17:09] spirit of the age called Vashi, but
[1:17:11] there was a bride produced by the spirit
[1:17:12] of the age called Esther.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, we see the contrast. It
[1:17:19] is. And it wasn't just for that day, but
[1:17:21] it's for the ages. Do you realize this
[1:17:22] is not just an example for that day, but
[1:17:25] it is the word. Amen. It is the spirit.
[1:17:28] It is the nature of the ages. Because
[1:17:30] the prophet of God told us those spirits
[1:17:32] don't die. Amen. They don't pass away.
[1:17:35] They don't come to end. They just move
[1:17:37] on. Amen. And they've come right down
[1:17:39] through the ages to today. And so, it's
[1:17:42] there uh that it is there. So Vashy no
[1:17:45] longer has a husband but claims to be a
[1:17:48] queen. And she comes right here and
[1:17:50] says, "I am no widow."
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; I still have a husband.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; But the husband doesn't claim her.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; So this is a one-sided love affair. Only
[1:18:04] this is not really love.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; This is position, power, authority.
[1:18:14] And that was the root of it.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; The desire to control someone.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to really blunt.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; That spirit still lives in churches
[1:18:25] today.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Men that want to dominate.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And if you're going to be part of this,
[1:18:31] you will do this, this, and this. And
[1:18:33] for some reason, people forget to read
[1:18:35] their Bible or simply don't understand
[1:18:37] what they're reading. And they go for
[1:18:39] that. They fall for that. And they they
[1:18:41] do the most silly things. You would say,
[1:18:43] "Why would someone do that?" Just read
[1:18:46] the other day how this man, I won't name
[1:18:49] his name, h has just millions upon
[1:18:51] millions and preached a sermon in his
[1:18:53] church about if you want God to save
[1:18:56] your lost children, you'll take your
[1:18:58] savings and you'll give it to me. And
[1:19:00] this little lady went took every drop of
[1:19:02] savings she had in her life and she gave
[1:19:05] it to the preacher. The preacher got a
[1:19:07] new jet and her children never come to
[1:19:09] serve God. and she was broke.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Now my brother and sister, that is not
[1:19:13] the gospel. That is a seducing spirit
[1:19:17] that is causing people to think that if
[1:19:19] I do this, it's completely outside of
[1:19:21] the word of God. Now remember, come back
[1:19:24] to the story there. And Jesus said that
[1:19:26] little widow who gave her might gave
[1:19:28] more than the rich man. Amen. God's not
[1:19:31] looking at how much I I'm going to put
[1:19:33] myself in the poor house to support a
[1:19:35] man with millions and believe that's how
[1:19:37] God the reason God's going to uh uh
[1:19:40] answer my questions, answer my prayers.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Come right,
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; God will answer your prayers.
[1:19:49] when you submit to this.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Hopefully, you'll take this right.
[1:20:00] But if you ever have to fill out a
[1:20:02] financial statement to come to church,
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; find a new church first.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; When they care more about your money,
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; than they care about your soul.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Find another church. Right?
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Let money be the back burner.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it takes money. These lights, all
[1:20:22] these things in the modern day, it takes
[1:20:24] money.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; But don't let that be the priority.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac shares with us. I think
[1:20:31] he's even mentioned it here in the
[1:20:32] church. He's seen a video one time where
[1:20:35] his preachers preaching prosperity. And
[1:20:37] then he's there and you know that church
[1:20:39] was they were sewing. They were
[1:20:41] expecting to get a harvest. They were
[1:20:42] sewing. And the preacher starts going
[1:20:44] money, money, money, money. money starts
[1:20:46] falling out of the rafters.
[1:20:50] Now, don't expect that. If it was, it
[1:20:53] wouldn't be very much. You could pick up
[1:20:54] the change. But you see what it is.
[1:20:57] People fall for that.
[1:21:00] And what the preacher was doing is this
[1:21:01] money fell. He was coaching the people
[1:21:04] that as this money falls, you pick it up
[1:21:07] and then you bring it to the front and
[1:21:09] put it back into the
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; I wonder if he got it all back.
[1:21:19] Are we okay?
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; If she's queen, where is her king?
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. There you are. Who is he?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Because I believe every one of us today
[1:21:37] can identify who our king is.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at Esther for just a few
[1:21:43] minutes. I need to hurry here.
[1:21:45] Amen. Esther responded to something
[1:21:48] greater than herself. Now in Esther the
[1:21:51] 4th chapter verses 12-1 17.
[1:22:03] And they told to Mordei Esther's words.
[1:22:06] Then Mori commanded to answer Esther,
[1:22:09] "Think not with thyself that thou shalt
[1:22:12] escape in the king's house more than all
[1:22:14] the Jews. For if thou altogether holdest
[1:22:17] thy peace at this time, then shall their
[1:22:20] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[1:22:23] Jews from another place, but thou and
[1:22:26] thy father's house shall be destroyed.
[1:22:28] And who knoweth whether thou art come to
[1:22:31] the kingdom for such a time as this?"
[1:22:34] Please, every one of us, apply that to
[1:22:35] our life. We come to the kingdom for a
[1:22:38] time such as this. An evil age. Amen. A
[1:22:42] dark age. A deceptive age. And God said,
[1:22:44] "I've got some people that can overcome
[1:22:47] in this age. I've called them and
[1:22:49] they're coming." Hallelujah.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:53] Then Esther bade them return. Mori this
[1:22:56] answer. Go gather therefore all of the
[1:22:58] church.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Come on. Put it to our day, right? We're
[1:23:03] not viewing it as Jews and Gentiles.
[1:23:06] Gathered together all of the church, all
[1:23:08] of the Jews that are present in Shushan,
[1:23:11] and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor
[1:23:14] drink three days, night or day, and I
[1:23:16] also in my maidens will fast likewise.
[1:23:19] Sure looks to me like maybe Esther had
[1:23:22] some converts.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Maybe those who lived around her every
[1:23:28] day
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; said, "She is so different."
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's something different,
[1:23:34] Esther.
[1:23:35] What's different about you?
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, how many times we have been
[1:23:41] approached in our lives of people
[1:23:44] saying, "What's different about you?"
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Now, if we look like the world, smelled
[1:23:48] like the world, acted like the world,
[1:23:50] dressed like the world, they're not
[1:23:51] going to come and say, "Why are you so
[1:23:53] different?" They're going to be able to
[1:23:54] say, "Oh, you got your hairstyle from
[1:23:56] the cover of the same magazine I got my
[1:23:58] hairstyle from.
[1:24:04] I don't know if it's real or not, but
[1:24:06] maybe there's even a site called
[1:24:07] churchfashions.com.
[1:24:18] Now look at this. I think this is really
[1:24:20] special. This should be how we
[1:24:23] unabandonly throw ourselves into our
[1:24:25] life as Christians. Go gather together
[1:24:28] all the Jews that are present in Susan.
[1:24:30] Fast ye from me. Neither eat nor drink
[1:24:33] three days, night or day. I also and my
[1:24:36] maidens will fast likewise. So will I go
[1:24:39] unto the king which is not according to
[1:24:42] the law. And if I perish, I perish.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, here is clear
[1:24:48] foundation of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:24:51] coming boldly to the throne of God.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. God didn't say, "I got limitations
[1:24:56] for you." What he wants is a people that
[1:24:59] are bold enough to take the law and say,
[1:25:02] "The law is not for me when it comes to
[1:25:05] approaching my Lord and Savior, my God,
[1:25:08] my king. It's not a me. The law is not
[1:25:12] going to stop me from approaching him."
[1:25:14] Amen. Look what the spirit was on
[1:25:16] Daniel. You know, we'll throw you in a
[1:25:18] lion's den if you don't stop this. He
[1:25:20] didn't go close the deal up uh so he
[1:25:22] could just peek out through the crack
[1:25:23] and pray anyhow. He left it wide open
[1:25:26] because he looked at their law and says,
[1:25:28] "If God takes my life, he takes my life.
[1:25:31] But I'm going to serve God with all my
[1:25:33] heart, mind, body, and soul. I'm not
[1:25:35] going TO BE HELD BACK by the spirit of
[1:25:37] this day, the spirit of politics, the
[1:25:39] spirit of our nation. I'd rather be gone
[1:25:42] than to be submitted to this."
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My brother and sister, this
[1:25:47] is what the nature see that same spirit
[1:25:49] that was on Daniel, we see it right here
[1:25:52] uh on on Esther. We see it come right
[1:25:54] down and it's right here in the 21st
[1:25:56] century on the bride of Christ that says
[1:25:58] there's not one thing that's going to
[1:26:01] stop me from serving my God. Amen.
[1:26:04] Whether it be famine or pestilence or uh
[1:26:07] uh be torture, whatever it might be,
[1:26:10] nothing's going to stop me from serving
[1:26:12] my God. I was sorting through one of the
[1:26:14] zillion books I have in my little
[1:26:16] library and I come across and I'm right
[1:26:18] now absent of the the the title of that
[1:26:21] book, but it was about a young man in
[1:26:23] Russia at a time and they they told him,
[1:26:25] "You know what? If you'll just quit your
[1:26:27] whole religious thing here, we'll let
[1:26:29] you go." And he says, "Why don't you
[1:26:31] just go ahead and torture me?" And they
[1:26:33] said, "Well, we'll make you give this
[1:26:34] up." And in the end, who broke?
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; It wasn't him. They broke this body.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. But they didn't break his
[1:26:43] spirit.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we put the wrong value, if
[1:26:46] we put our value on this body, we'll
[1:26:48] break. But when we put the value on our
[1:26:50] soul, you will not break because your
[1:26:53] soul does not belong to you. It belongs
[1:26:55] to Christ.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; And you can't give away something that's
[1:26:58] not yours.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So look, Mori goes verse 17, does
[1:27:05] what Esther commanded him. Now we go the
[1:27:07] next jump right over the chapter there.
[1:27:09] Chapter 5:es 1-3. Now it came to pass on
[1:27:12] the third day that Esther put on her
[1:27:14] royal apparel.
[1:27:16] Amen.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; I want you to keep that royal apparel in
[1:27:19] your mind.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And stood in the inner court of the
[1:27:23] king's house over against the king's
[1:27:25] house. And the king sat upon his royal
[1:27:28] throne in the royal house. So we've
[1:27:30] really got a a royal flush here.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Over against the gate of the
[1:27:35] house. And it was so.
[1:27:38] When the king saw the bride,
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Esther,
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; his wife,
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; right, he didn't see some woman standing
[1:27:48] there in royal apparel. He saw something
[1:27:52] that was intimate and special, something
[1:27:54] that had his heart, something that
[1:27:56] literally gripped his heart.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Need some marriage counseling? It's
[1:28:03] right there.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; You need to be able to look at your wife
[1:28:05] or your husband. Amen. and be absolutely
[1:28:08] gripped by your love for them.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Standing in the court and she
[1:28:13] obtained favor in his sight. And the
[1:28:15] king held out to Esther the golden
[1:28:17] scepter that was in his hand. So Esther
[1:28:20] drew near and touched the top of the
[1:28:23] scepter.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; I tell you, this is not original thought
[1:28:26] to me. This is something another brother
[1:28:28] was speaking and and it really rung with
[1:28:30] me, really held true. He said, "Our king
[1:28:33] is sitting today on his throne holding
[1:28:36] out his royal scepter."
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a solid gold deal with
[1:28:42] jewels on the end of it. He's holding
[1:28:44] out the royal scepter of our age, and
[1:28:47] that is his word. Amen. The rubies and
[1:28:50] gold have no value compared to this
[1:28:52] word. That all passes away, BUT THIS
[1:28:55] CANNOT pass away. Amen. And he's holding
[1:28:58] his scepter out to you and I today if we
[1:29:01] would take a hold of that and receive
[1:29:03] it. And look at this. It wasn't just an
[1:29:06] acknowledgement. Oh, I see your scepter.
[1:29:10] She had to touch it.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; She had to be part of it.
[1:29:16] And he looks at her and he is so moved
[1:29:20] by who she is.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; That's it. You will not find one word
[1:29:23] recorded in any kind of history that
[1:29:26] shows these kind of words were ever
[1:29:27] spoken to Vashi.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; But in this time right here, the king
[1:29:34] said the king unto her, "What will thou
[1:29:36] queen Esther? And what is thy request?
[1:29:39] It shall be given thee to the half of
[1:29:42] the kingdom."
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother and sister, look at the
[1:29:46] difference. One is coming. She's got an
[1:29:48] issue. She's got something she needs.
[1:29:50] Amen. It wasn't a royal banquet and to
[1:29:53] impress all the other princesses and
[1:29:55] whatevers of the nations. My brother and
[1:29:57] sister, she's there because she's got a
[1:30:00] different kind of heart. She's not
[1:30:01] wanting to throw a party. She cares
[1:30:03] about souls. She's looking out there
[1:30:05] saying, "These are souls. These are my
[1:30:08] people and they have souls and Lord, you
[1:30:10] need to save them." And God comes and
[1:30:13] says, "I'm going to work, but I'm going
[1:30:15] to work it through a way that is not
[1:30:17] what you would think."
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:21] And she says,
[1:30:24] "Oh, um, look, this rotten Hmon,
[1:30:28] um,
[1:30:29] he's causing me problems. This guy right
[1:30:31] here standing off the side of your
[1:30:33] throne, he's causing me problems.
[1:30:39] Uh, if it would please you,
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; it
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; would please you.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah, right.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to throw a banquet at my house
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; just for you." Yes.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; And for Hmon,
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; and please catch this. I know it's real
[1:30:54] simple, but I'm a simple guy.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Hmon,
[1:30:58] his online name was Lucifer.
[1:31:04] He was so pleased.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my, look at this.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be elevated even higher.
[1:31:14] No one's ever been invited to the
[1:31:16] queen's house but me.
[1:31:20] And I'm going with the king.
[1:31:22] Oh, how wonderful.
[1:31:25] They have a little banquet.
[1:31:28] King says, Esther, what is it you need?
[1:31:33] Um,
[1:31:37] can you come to my house tomorrow?
[1:31:40] You know what was happening?
[1:31:42] Esther wasn't scheming. Esther was
[1:31:45] praying.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; And she realized she hadn't prayed
[1:31:48] enough. I need another day to pray.
[1:31:51] Imagine how many hasty decisions. Come
[1:31:54] on.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. Be bear with me, saints. How
[1:31:57] many hasty decisions we have made
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; when we had another day to pray.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; We had time.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; We had ability.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; But we hastily made the decision. You
[1:32:11] know what? You guys are looking at me
[1:32:12] like
[1:32:13] I'm going to raise my hand just so you
[1:32:15] know that the guy who's preaching at you
[1:32:17] today has made a lot of hasty decisions.
[1:32:20] And I've paid some large, large prices
[1:32:23] for those hasty decisions. God help me.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; He's forgiven me, but my brother and
[1:32:28] sister, my brain still remembers.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, just like the Indian that was
[1:32:35] hunting with brother Brandham says, "You
[1:32:37] go too fast." Yeah,
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; brother Brandon was a good hunter.
[1:32:40] Everybody that hunted with him, he had a
[1:32:42] whole list of people who were like he
[1:32:44] was exceptional hunter, had good ears,
[1:32:46] good eyes and here his Indian friend is
[1:32:49] saying, "No, no, you step once
[1:32:54] and then you keep looking around you
[1:32:57] before you take another step."
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; What are we?
[1:33:02] Lord,
[1:33:05] I want to do this. Lord, I I think I I
[1:33:08] think Lord, I feel it. I feel that
[1:33:10] you're telling me to do this that
[1:33:13] afternoon.
[1:33:16] Let's do something that would be
[1:33:17] affliction for all of us. A brand new
[1:33:21] pickup.
[1:33:24] And I'll make a confession to you. I've
[1:33:27] been looking at pickups
[1:33:31] and they smell
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; almost new. Yeah.
[1:33:38] And they look
[1:33:40] so nice.
[1:33:42] You're right, Brother David. It is
[1:33:43] almost new. It's a new pickup, but it's
[1:33:45] so close to new that you guys would say
[1:33:47] you bought a new pickup.
[1:33:50] My only question is is why does God get
[1:33:52] rid of a pickup that's so new?
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; I mean, Brother Ivan will disagree with
[1:33:58] me on this, but they're good for 200,
[1:34:02] 300,000 miles. Why would you get rid of
[1:34:04] it with just a few miles?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; might be something wrong with that.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Or it could just be a trap of the devil.
[1:34:16] But in our haste
[1:34:18] and Esther says, "You know what? It was
[1:34:21] a lovely meal. So glad to spend time
[1:34:23] with my husband."
[1:34:25] I won't tell you what brother said this.
[1:34:26] He says, "You know what, brothers? You
[1:34:28] should listen to this here." Not talking
[1:34:29] about Esther, but when your wife says,
[1:34:31] "I don't see you enough." You might
[1:34:34] ought to listen cuz she's either going
[1:34:35] to see you or she's going to the bon
[1:34:37] mare.
[1:34:39] So, one or the other. You or the
[1:34:41] shopping mall. Maybe you should spend
[1:34:44] more time with her. But Sister Jerry
[1:34:48] tells me, "Ha, that's why they invented
[1:34:49] Amazon. I can sit with you and still go
[1:34:52] shopping."
[1:34:54] Yeah. Boy, the devil's tricky.
[1:35:00] But then the next day, everything's just
[1:35:02] right because God's orchestrated the
[1:35:04] timing.
[1:35:06] And Esther finds the deliverance for
[1:35:09] people.
[1:35:11] Now, my brother and sister, we have a
[1:35:13] brother, sister, husband, wife, son or
[1:35:16] daughter not serving God.
[1:35:19] You just keep praying for them.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow
[1:35:23] might be the day of their deliverance.
[1:35:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't happen today,
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; you pray it happens tomorrow.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; And you just keep praying like tomorrow
[1:35:33] is going to be the day and the day will
[1:35:35] come when it is the day
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; and God will move in your midst and you
[1:35:40] will say, "Praise God, he answered my
[1:35:43] prayer." But you see, if you get
[1:35:45] impatient,
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; you'll totally miss the will of God.
[1:35:49] Esther could have come barging to the
[1:35:51] throne, touched the scepter and said,
[1:35:53] "I'm here to deal with you, to talk to
[1:35:56] you, my husband, about that man Hmon,
[1:35:59] that evil man that you have in your
[1:36:01] kingdom with you. That man who's
[1:36:03] destructive. He's a liar, a cheat, and a
[1:36:05] thief. And you don't even recognize it."
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Wonder how that would have turned out.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Because remember, they warned Esther,
[1:36:14] you go there and he doesn't accept you,
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; you're in trouble,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; right? But I don't know what happens if
[1:36:20] they're accepted
[1:36:22] and then they're belligerent.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; I won't say that out loud.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at this real quick.
[1:36:40] See, the bride's calling is beyond
[1:36:42] herself.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's she's not there just
[1:36:46] thinking about herself. She's thinking
[1:36:47] about all of those around her. Amen. And
[1:36:50] what is she willing to do? She's willing
[1:36:52] to step into the battle. Now, you know
[1:36:54] what the you know what the the human
[1:36:56] nature is? We're going to step in and
[1:36:58] we're going to give all kinds of advice.
[1:37:01] But what prophet of God say?
[1:37:04] Pray. That's
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; You want to change somebody's mind. You
[1:37:08] look right here in this little assembly.
[1:37:10] You You think somebody's headed the
[1:37:11] wrong direction. You don't need to go
[1:37:13] give them a piece of your mind because
[1:37:14] you do that too often, you won't have
[1:37:16] any mind left. But you come there and
[1:37:17] come to the place that you don't agree
[1:37:19] with what they're doing. You pray for
[1:37:21] them.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Get down. Not a Lord, help them, but get
[1:37:25] down and get serious and not more than
[1:37:28] one little moment, but let it be a day
[1:37:30] or two or many days or days of your week
[1:37:33] uh praying for them and it will change
[1:37:35] lives.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will save lives. Amen.
[1:37:40] And she she caught a revelation. You
[1:37:43] realize it's a revelation, saints, to
[1:37:45] come boldly to the throne of God.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Many people have that very timid
[1:37:49] approach. God's such an awesome God,
[1:37:51] such a reverent God, such a holy God. I
[1:37:53] can't approach him. But the word of God
[1:37:55] tells you, am I telling you the truth?
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; He tells you to come boldly to the
[1:38:00] throne of God. And that means whether
[1:38:03] you live or die, you're going to go to
[1:38:05] that throne and you're going to present
[1:38:06] your case to God.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we need to do.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; So, look at this.
[1:38:18] Don't misunderstand what I'm fixing to
[1:38:19] say here. To come to the throne is life.
[1:38:23] To come boldly as God's provided way.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; And a true wordfilled bride
[1:38:31] brings glory to her husband.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to look at this story of
[1:38:35] Esther.
[1:38:37] She didn't ever, not once in this whole
[1:38:39] story did she put her husband in a
[1:38:41] position that embarrassed him, shamed
[1:38:44] him, caused him to look bad in the eyes
[1:38:46] of the people. Everything she did, she
[1:38:49] let it just naturally unfold itself
[1:38:53] until when it come to the point, if you
[1:38:55] don't mind me playing this out, you want
[1:38:57] to see how God works and how
[1:38:59] supernatural God is, they're there.
[1:39:01] She's there. They're they're having
[1:39:03] that, you know, I don't know, like giant
[1:39:05] couch, whatever. and and they're there.
[1:39:07] And when the king is disturbed by what
[1:39:09] Esther shares, look what Hmon does.
[1:39:11] Trying to defend himself. Look how look
[1:39:13] how God moves.
[1:39:15] Hmon trying to defend himself gets up
[1:39:17] and he's telling Esther, "No, I would
[1:39:19] never." And he falls down right upon her
[1:39:23] feet and lower legs. And about that
[1:39:26] time, the king turns around
[1:39:29] and sealed Hmon's fate right there. He's
[1:39:33] in a turmoil. my faithful man, Hmon, and
[1:39:36] my wife's making an accusation and turns
[1:39:39] around and it looks as though Hmon is
[1:39:41] assaulting
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; his wife.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; And it's settled. And I'm telling you,
[1:39:46] my brother and sister, Lucifer's fate
[1:39:48] was settled. Amen. when he, our king,
[1:39:52] our husband, looked down and saw Lucifer
[1:39:56] assaulting his bride,
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; there would be no grace for Satan, even
[1:40:01] if he desired grace.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Because God is not a God to let his
[1:40:06] wife, his bride, be assaulted
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; and just look the other way.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, look what God's doing. This
[1:40:16] is why the bride of Christ is going to
[1:40:18] have, as it were,
[1:40:21] a final voice in a final age because God
[1:40:24] respects her judgment, respects her
[1:40:27] words. Amen.
[1:40:31] I need to be done.
[1:40:34] Amen.
[1:40:36] A true word-filled bride brings glory to
[1:40:39] her husband. I think we honestly could
[1:40:41] put that in in the natural and spiritual
[1:40:44] because you see natural spiritual we
[1:40:46] have no scripture instructing us to
[1:40:48] bring glory to ourselves.
[1:40:51] If there be any glory in us it has come
[1:40:54] from our husband our king. Now John
[1:40:57] 12:32
[1:40:59] says
[1:41:00] and I if I be lifted up from the earth
[1:41:03] Jesus speaking will draw all men unto
[1:41:05] me. See he said if I be lifted up so
[1:41:08] there's where the gloryy's at. We're
[1:41:09] lifting him up.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Now, let me hurry through this. 1
[1:41:13] Corinthians 6:1 19-20.
[1:41:16] What know ye not that your body is the
[1:41:18] temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in
[1:41:20] you, which ye have of God, which ye are
[1:41:23] not your own? Now, how can we bring
[1:41:26] glory to something that's not even ours?
[1:41:29] We bring it to him.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. For you were bought with a price.
[1:41:34] Therefore, glorify God in your body and
[1:41:37] in your spirit which are gods.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it's a very clear
[1:41:42] picture of how we should bring glory and
[1:41:44] honor. We shouldn't be doing this. Oh,
[1:41:46] if I do this, somebody will notice my
[1:41:48] ability. My brother and sister, I I'll
[1:41:50] be kind of vague on this, but there was
[1:41:52] something that happened many years ago
[1:41:54] and a man, a brother, he told me, he
[1:41:57] says, "There's these certain meetings,
[1:41:58] and a lot of ministers of big churches
[1:42:00] are are there at those meetings." And I
[1:42:03] I was I was just blindsided by this. He
[1:42:08] said, "You know what? If you go to those
[1:42:09] meetings, you'll get invitations to
[1:42:13] preach at some of the biggest churches
[1:42:15] in America."
[1:42:18] Something inside of me says, "You will
[1:42:22] never go there."
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; So that's not what we're here for.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Not here to get invited in publicity,
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; be put up in a position Right.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; And even if I was a really good
[1:42:35] preacher, you know, to go there and
[1:42:37] people say, "Oh, he's such a good
[1:42:38] preacher." My brother and sister, that's
[1:42:40] the wrong thing. I'll tell you how I am.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; I'm just a farm boy. I've got a
[1:42:45] pitchfork
[1:42:47] and I want to feed the sheep. I don't
[1:42:50] want to feed the sheep that are 20 miles
[1:42:51] down the road, 100 miles, 500, a
[1:42:54] thousand, 5,000. Yeah, we'll go. We'll
[1:42:56] preach. There's things. I'm not saying
[1:42:58] that. but but to use that as as the open
[1:43:00] door to to go and and leave the sheep at
[1:43:04] home. I was talking to a pastor here
[1:43:05] recently. And he was telling me, "How
[1:43:08] come you don't travel very much, Paul?"
[1:43:11] And I said, "Well, brother, not that we
[1:43:14] don't have good ministry, Brother David.
[1:43:15] Faithful ministry right here in our
[1:43:17] church, but I said, "It's the pastor's
[1:43:19] job to feed sheep. And imagine if you're
[1:43:22] gone
[1:43:24] all this lot, a lot a lot a lot.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Just imagine it in the natural. Nobody
[1:43:30] fed your sheep while you were gone.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Not only would a wolf come, but you'd
[1:43:37] have some really skinny sheep.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; It's not our job. Yeah. Okay. Sounds
[1:43:44] like a contradiction. I'm going to South
[1:43:46] America in a couple weeks.
[1:43:49] But there's young children there,
[1:43:51] teenagers.
[1:43:53] Amen. And we're believing God's going to
[1:43:55] move in their midst. We're going to
[1:43:56] believe God's going to touch them. But
[1:43:57] I'll be back and you'll be well fed
[1:43:59] while I'm gone. But look at this. Amen.
[1:44:02] Brother Alex, are you going to play for
[1:44:03] us or you still interpreting? Amen.
[1:44:07] Look at
[1:44:11] book of Romans 15 1-7.
[1:44:14] You know, uh you can take that as
[1:44:16] homework.
[1:44:18] uh and see how our Lord felt about us.
[1:44:21] Amen. That we can verse six that you may
[1:44:24] with one mind and one mouth glorify God
[1:44:27] even the father our lord Jesus Christ.
[1:44:30] Wherefore receive you one another as
[1:44:32] Christ also received us to the glory of
[1:44:34] God. See so we should we can't have
[1:44:37] clicks in the church saints. What we're
[1:44:39] doing is doing Satan's work when we
[1:44:41] divide the church up that we're this
[1:44:43] group, that group, this group, that
[1:44:44] group. No, we're one body here and we
[1:44:46] need to remain one body and not let
[1:44:48] Satan cause us to become a split body.
[1:44:51] Okay, I'm going to be done right here.
[1:44:54] Just a scripture and a quote. Amen. So,
[1:44:57] look at this here in Revelations 19
[1:44:59] and6.
[1:45:01] Here's Esther.
[1:45:04] Here is Esther in the New Testament. You
[1:45:06] realize that?
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Here's Esther in the New Testament. And
[1:45:10] I heard as a voice great multitude and
[1:45:12] as a voice of many waters and voice of
[1:45:14] mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for
[1:45:16] the Lord God omnipotent reignth. Let us
[1:45:19] be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:45:21] him for the marriage of the lamb is come
[1:45:25] and his wife hath made herself ready.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; There's an Esther spirit come right down
[1:45:32] here in the New Testament. She put on
[1:45:34] her royal garment. She didn't put on the
[1:45:39] fashion of the age. You notice that
[1:45:41] about Esther.
[1:45:43] Imagine now, pardon me. I just have to
[1:45:45] finish this. When the king was looking
[1:45:48] for a wife,
[1:45:49] I don't know what scandalous looked like
[1:45:51] in their day, but I'm sure that there
[1:45:54] were a few of those candidates that come
[1:45:56] to see the king thought, "Woo, he won't
[1:45:59] be able to resist me."
[1:46:04] as it was in the 30s. I'll just flash a
[1:46:07] well-turned ankle and that will get his
[1:46:11] attention.
[1:46:13] No,
[1:46:15] it didn't get his attention.
[1:46:18] He said, "I had a beauty queen once.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; And she wasn't a faithful wife.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; I want a different kind of wife this
[1:46:25] time." Look, this all ties into the
[1:46:27] scripture.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:31] I want a wife that won't even entertain
[1:46:33] the voice of another. That's right.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; She's my wife.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; She only hears my voice. She only wants
[1:46:40] to please me.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; And then with all this church fashion
[1:46:46] comes Esther dressed as a queen
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; should be dressed. and he would have
[1:46:53] looked at her and said, "This is a young
[1:46:56] woman who's already prepared for the job
[1:47:00] at hand."
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; The marriage of the lamb has come, and
[1:47:06] his wife hath made herself ready. And to
[1:47:09] her was granted that she should be
[1:47:10] arrayed in fine linen, clean and white.
[1:47:13] For fine linen is the righteousness of
[1:47:16] saints. And he saith unto me, write,
[1:47:21] blessed are they which are called into
[1:47:22] the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he
[1:47:25] said unto me, these are the true sayings
[1:47:27] of God. This is the word of God to the
[1:47:31] Esther of this day. She's going to come
[1:47:36] robed in righteousness.
[1:47:38] Not going to look like everybody else.
[1:47:40] She's not going to turn a well- turned
[1:47:41] ankle to get the attention. It's going
[1:47:43] to be her righteousness, her nature, who
[1:47:47] she is, her spirit. Because you see, now
[1:47:52] this would be a little bit out of turn
[1:47:54] maybe. Forgive me if it does seem like
[1:47:56] it is. This is the same wife
[1:48:01] that's going to stand up and say,
[1:48:03] "Come."
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, if God's calling a
[1:48:08] righteous and holy bride
[1:48:10] and an unrighteous and unholy bride are
[1:48:13] calling her, no, can't happen. This
[1:48:18] bride right here, the Esther of this age
[1:48:22] is going to clothe herself. No mascara,
[1:48:26] no whatever. I forget all those names. I
[1:48:28] never been quite into that. Haven't
[1:48:30] never wore any of it myself. So I never
[1:48:32] knew which was good and which wasn't.
[1:48:36] She Oh, Max. Max F. Yeah. Why couldn't I
[1:48:39] think of that? She doesn't need that.
[1:48:44] Remember we talked earlier about knowing
[1:48:45] who you are.
[1:48:47] She knows who she is.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. I don't have to
[1:48:52] take the world and make myself look like
[1:48:56] the world to catch my husband's
[1:48:59] attention.
[1:49:00] I come righteous. I come holy. I come
[1:49:04] before his throne,
[1:49:07] not cowering.
[1:49:08] Is it okay to, you know, sometimes I'm
[1:49:10] demonstrative, but but you know, imagine
[1:49:15] you're coming up. You got something on
[1:49:17] your heart. You're going to come to the
[1:49:18] throne here to the altar and you're
[1:49:20] like,
[1:49:24] I'm not worthy. I don't know if I should
[1:49:25] go.
[1:49:30] We do it in our own closet though.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm not worthy.
[1:49:35] I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy. Come on.
[1:49:39] If you feel like you're not worthy, get
[1:49:41] in a position that you can say, "By your
[1:49:44] grace, I am worthy. I am worthy to come
[1:49:48] to this throne. I'm worthy to come in my
[1:49:50] husband's presence. I'm worthy to touch
[1:49:53] the end of the scepter, the word of God.
[1:49:55] I'm worthy to take him at his promise.
[1:49:58] I'm worthy to be called his wife
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; because he said so.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; And these are the true sayings of God.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:12] I didn't put this so you won't see the
[1:50:13] quote here. It was something after I was
[1:50:16] in the back room.
[1:50:18] The conflict between God and Satan. Is
[1:50:20] that conflict still going on?
[1:50:22] The bride must be unified.
[1:50:26] Oh, it is there. Did you just find it?
[1:50:28] Did I put it on there?
[1:50:31] I'm losing my mind. Pray for me.
[1:50:36] The bride must be unified. Unified
[1:50:38] together by the word. My sheep hear my
[1:50:42] voice. And this is his voice on printed
[1:50:46] word. Right?
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Unified by the word, she makes herself
[1:50:50] ready. not with a regular creed. Like
[1:50:53] Esther, when Esther was to be chosen to
[1:50:55] stand before the king, she didn't adorn
[1:50:58] themselves with all the things. She
[1:51:00] adorned herself with a sweet, meek
[1:51:02] spirit. That's what the bride is
[1:51:04] adorning herself with, with all of the
[1:51:07] fruits of the spirit following it. What
[1:51:09] she got assembling together in the
[1:51:11] fellowship of the word. Amen. Let's just
[1:51:14] stand. Hallelujah.
[1:51:16] Thank you for being patient. Amen.
[1:51:21] Oh, here's the quote that I didn't put.
[1:51:25] Wow. One more. Okay. It's short.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; It's short. And the sign of this time,
[1:51:30] he said, "Now, that's a true servant of
[1:51:32] God. Always is obedient to his master."
[1:51:35] See, not to show off or say something to
[1:51:38] elate somebody else, but to be honest
[1:51:40] and true with him that sent him. That's
[1:51:43] a true servant of Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:51:48] 269.
[1:51:50] Hallelujah. I stand I stand in awe.
[1:51:53] Amen.
[1:51:55] Let's sing this together. Just give
[1:51:57] praise to the Lord this morning.
[1:52:01] You are beautiful beyond
[1:52:06] description,
[1:52:09] too marvelous
[1:52:13] for words,
[1:52:16] too wonderful for comprehension,
[1:52:24] like nothing ever seen or heard.
[1:52:31] Who can grasp your infinite wisdom?
[1:52:38] Who can fathom the depth of your love?
[1:52:45] You are beautiful beyond
[1:52:50] description.
[1:52:53] Majesty
[1:52:55] enthroned
[1:52:57] above

[1:53:15] Holy God
[1:53:17] to whom all my praise is to
[1:53:24] I stand
[1:53:26] in awe
[1:53:28] of you.
[1:53:31] You are beautiful beyond
[1:53:36] description
[1:53:39] to marvelous
[1:53:43] for words.
[1:53:46] Too wonderful for comprehension
[1:53:54] like nothing ever seen
[1:53:57] or heard.
[1:54:01] Who can fathom the depth of your love?
[1:54:08] Who can fathom?
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; You are beautiful beyond
[1:54:19] description.
[1:54:23] Majesty
[1:54:25] throne
[1:54:27] above
[1:54:30] and I stand.
[1:54:32] Oh, I stand
[1:54:34] in awe of you.
[1:54:38] I stand
[1:54:40] I stand
[1:54:42] in all of you.
[1:54:45] Holy God
[1:54:47] to whom
[1:54:49] all my praise is to. I stand
[1:54:56] in awe
[1:54:58] of you.
[1:55:01] Amen. Are we ready, able, willing to
[1:55:04] pledge allegiance this morning?
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. 7:05.
[1:55:08] Hallelujah.
[1:55:11] Amen.
[1:55:13] Hallelujah.
[1:55:21] I have heard
[1:55:23] how Christians
[1:55:26] long
[1:55:28] ago
[1:55:30] were brought before
[1:55:34] a tyant
[1:55:36] throne. They were told
[1:55:40] that he
[1:55:42] would spare
[1:55:44] their lives.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; The name
[1:55:52] of Christ,
[1:55:54] but one by one
[1:55:58] they chose to die
[1:56:02] the son. Oh, that's this little bride of
[1:56:06] this hour.
[1:56:09] I like a great
[1:56:12] angelic
[1:56:15] choir
[1:56:17] saints. I can almost
[1:56:21] hear.
[1:56:23] Voices
[1:56:24] ring. For I pledge
[1:56:28] alce
[1:56:30] to the lamb.
[1:56:34] With all my strength,
[1:56:38] with all I am, I will seek
[1:56:44] to honor
[1:56:46] his command.
[1:56:49] I pledge
[1:56:52] alce
[1:56:54] to
[1:56:56] the lamb.
[1:56:58] Now the years have come
[1:57:02] and the years have gone,
[1:57:06] but the cross calls of Jesus
[1:57:11] still goes on. Now our time
[1:57:16] has come to count the cost.
[1:57:26] Embrace
[1:57:28] the cross.
[1:57:30] Oh, one by one.
[1:57:34] Just give our lives
[1:57:37] a boil
[1:57:41] to give us life. Failed us on good sound
[1:57:49] on that final day.
[1:58:00] I pledge
[1:58:03] alions
[1:58:05] to
[1:58:06] the lamb.
[1:58:08] With all my strength,
[1:58:12] with all I am, I will seek
[1:58:18] to honor
[1:58:20] his
[1:58:22] command.
[1:58:24] I pledge
[1:58:26] alce
[1:58:28] to
[1:58:30] the lamb
[1:58:32] to the lamb of God
[1:58:36] who bore my pain
[1:58:40] who took my place
[1:58:44] who wore my shame I will see
[1:58:50] to honor
[1:58:53] his command.
[1:58:56] I pledge
[1:58:58] alance
[1:59:00] to
[1:59:02] the lamb.
[1:59:04] I pledge
[1:59:07] alent
[1:59:09] to the lamb.
[1:59:13] With all my strength,
[1:59:17] with all I am, I will see
[1:59:22] to all
[1:59:25] his
[1:59:26] command.
[1:59:28] I pledge
[1:59:30] alent
[1:59:33] to
[1:59:34] the lamb.
[1:59:38] Amen.
[1:59:40] Amen. I
[1:59:42] whatever reason song kept coming back to
[1:59:44] me. Yet not I but Christ in me. Amen.
[1:59:52] Amen. Let's just sing that.
[1:59:55] What gift of grace
[1:59:58] is Jesus my redeemer.
[2:00:04] There is no more
[2:00:08] for heaven now to give.
[2:00:13] He is my joy,
[2:00:16] my righteousness
[2:00:18] and freom,
[2:00:22] steadfast love,
[2:00:25] my deep and boundless peace.
[2:00:30] To this I hope
[2:00:33] my hope is only Jesus.
[2:00:39] For my life
[2:00:42] is wholly bound to him.
[2:00:48] Oh how strange and divine
[2:00:52] I can sing. All is mine yet not I. God
[2:00:59] through Christ
[2:01:01] in me.
[2:01:04] A night is dark,
[2:01:07] but I am not forsaken.
[2:01:12] For by my side,
[2:01:15] a Savior He will stay.
[2:01:21] I labor on
[2:01:24] in weakness and rejoiceing.
[2:01:29] For in my need
[2:01:33] his power is displayed.
[2:01:38] To this I hold.
[2:01:41] My shepherd will defend me
[2:01:47] through the deepest
[2:01:50] valley. He will lead.
[2:01:56] Oh, the night has been one, and I shall
[2:02:02] overcome,
[2:02:04] yet not I, but through Christ
[2:02:09] in me.
[2:02:12] No fate I dread,
[2:02:15] I know I am forgi.
[2:02:21] The future's sure
[2:02:24] the price it has been paid.
[2:02:29] For Jesus bled
[2:02:32] and suffered for my pardon
[2:02:38] and he was raised
[2:02:41] to overthrow the grave.
[2:02:46] To this I hope
[2:02:49] my sin has been defeated.
[2:02:55] Jesus now
[2:02:58] and never is my plea.
[2:03:04] All the chains are released.
[2:03:08] I can sing. I am free yet not I. But
[2:03:15] through Christ
[2:03:17] in me
[2:03:20] with every breath
[2:03:23] I long to follow Jesus
[2:03:29] for he has said
[2:03:32] that he will bring me home
[2:03:37] and day by day
[2:03:40] I know he will renew me
[2:03:46] till I stand
[2:03:49] with joy before the throne.
[2:03:54] To this I hope
[2:03:58] my hope is only Jesus.
[2:04:04] All the glory
[2:04:07] ever more to him.
[2:04:12] When the race is complete, still my lips
[2:04:18] shall repeat.
[2:04:20] Yet not I, but through Christ
[2:04:25] in me.
[2:04:28] To this I hope.
[2:04:32] My hope is only Jesus.
[2:04:38] The glory
[2:04:41] ever more to him
[2:04:46] when the race is complete. Still my lips
[2:04:52] shall repeat yet not I, but through
[2:04:57] Christ
[2:04:59] in me.
[2:05:03] And the race is complete. Still my lips
[2:05:09] shall repeat.
[2:05:12] Yet not I, but through Christ
[2:05:17] in me.
[2:05:20] Yet not I, but through Christ
[2:05:25] in me.
[2:05:29] Yet not I, but through Christ
[2:05:34] in me.
[2:05:38] Amen. All the glory ever more to him.
[2:05:40] Praise the Lord.
[2:05:44] Hallelujah.
[2:05:48] Hallelujah.
[2:05:50] As we get ready to brother Paul
[2:05:52] mentioned songs just been on my heart
[2:05:55] very much the last uh last couple weeks
[2:05:59] was um creating me a clean heart. I just
[2:06:02] wanted to share this with you real
[2:06:04] quick.
[2:06:06] The last two verses of Psalms 139 says,
[2:06:09] "Search me, oh God, and know my heart.
[2:06:11] Try me and know my thoughts. And if
[2:06:14] there be any wicked,
[2:06:16] way in me, lead me in the way
[2:06:18] everlasting." I pray as we go today,
[2:06:22] search us, oh Lord. Lord, purify us.
[2:06:26] Create us in Create in us a clean heart.
[2:06:29] Hallelujah.
[2:06:31] Create
[2:06:33] in me a clean
[2:06:37] heart.
[2:06:40] Oh God,
[2:06:46] and renew a right spirit
[2:06:50] within me.
[2:06:57] Create
[2:06:59] in me a clean
[2:07:03] heart.
[2:07:06] Oh God,
[2:07:12] and renew a right spirit
[2:07:16] within me.
[2:07:23] passest
[2:07:25] me not away
[2:07:28] from my presence,
[2:07:32] oh Lord,
[2:07:36] and take
[2:07:38] not thy holy
[2:07:41] spirit from me.
[2:07:48] Restore
[2:07:50] unto
[2:07:52] me
[2:07:55] the joy of thy salvation.
[2:08:02] And renew a right spirit
[2:08:07] within me.
[2:08:13] bring Cate
[2:08:15] in me a clean
[2:08:19] heart
[2:08:21] home.
[2:08:23] Oh God,
[2:08:29] renew a right spirit
[2:08:32] within me.
[2:08:38] Create
[2:08:41] in me a clean
[2:08:45] heart,
[2:08:48] oh God,
[2:08:54] and renew a right spirit
[2:08:58] within me.
[2:09:06] Cast me not away
[2:09:10] from thy presence,
[2:09:14] oh Lord,
[2:09:18] and take
[2:09:20] not thy holy spirit from me.
[2:09:30] Restore
[2:09:33] unto
[2:09:34] me
[2:09:37] the joy of thy salvation
[2:09:45] and renew a right spirit
[2:09:49] within me.
[2:09:54] Amen. Praise God. Pray that he go with
[2:09:57] you. be with you today and in the week
[2:10:00] to come. God bless you.
