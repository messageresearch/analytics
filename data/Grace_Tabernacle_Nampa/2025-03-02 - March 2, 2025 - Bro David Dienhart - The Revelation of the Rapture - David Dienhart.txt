you it's good to be in the house house of the Lord thank you musicians you can take your seats we're just so grateful for the word for the songs for the order of the service you know he's in control how many believe that really believe that you believe God's in control how about individually amen you came here not on your own you came here because God put faith in you come here right you realize that amen you're here because he wanted you here you're right in the place where God wants you to be seated I'm right where I should be this morning so everything is under the control and command of him and we are expecting from him we are expecting to receive from him we're expecting to hear from him I'm expecting to speak by inspiration from him I expect the words I speak to be his word amen for the hour and the season the ministry in this hour is not to bring a season past we are to bring the word for the season now amen and that keeps the bride going forward amen reaching continually what are we reaching for Brother David the Finish we have the finish in sight we have the body change in sight how are we going to get there by the revealing of himself to you amen it's the only way you're going to make it is that he reveal himself to you so let's stand well before we stand I have a couple things I want to read the prophet said my title this morning is the revelation of the Rapture the revelation of the Rapture what is a revelation we know what it is it's the faith so we're speaking of the faith of the Rapture it's got to be revealed first in you you've got to have that Revelation bride before you can have a body change but this message has made the way for it this message is for the going home of the Bride we believe the message is the full revelation of Jesus Christ amen which is here it's the Sun is up how many believe the Sun is up he said is the rising of the Sun but he then he says in the same message he said now we see the Sun is up where is it where is it where is it up and where is it shining in you it's shining in the bride it's up in the bride she is the revelation of the son the full revelation of Jesus Christ is walking on Earth today what is it the revelation of the son of man those aren't cliches that's the truth amen amen so the prophet says in the message rapture paragraph 65 but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her the Revel that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture amen now my title was the revelation of the Rapture but also I want to include this she's going up she can't be closed up she's going going up can't be closed up she's being taken up when God when the excuse me when the prophet saw the bride marching she returned again like she was at the first how many know that when she returned again she saw her him her Marching In step with the word because he said she was the word marching and she didn't go down she went up her walk was up just like Enoch brother Braham said Enoch walked with God Amen Enoch walked with God and one step was higher The Next Step was higher than the last step the path of the just is a shining light that groweth greater more and more unto that perfect day we're looking for the perfect day of a mortal body change amen amen paragraph 66 he said now it's a revelation for the Revelation is Faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you now we're talking about individual here this morning this is not a group Affair God I it doesn't matter it's not a group Affair you belong to this church you belong to that church you belong to this church it's not a group Affair it's an individual affair between you and Christ I believe in going to church I believe you ought to be in a church I believe you ought to make a church home where the ministry is preaching the word for the season and that is where we're at today but it's an individual Affair Christ isn't revealed to a group Christ is revealed to the individuals who are the members of one body amen right amen so faith is a revelation because it's something that revealed to you now what is a revelation now Faith is what substance now Faith is the substance of things hoped for it's not an imagination it's something you know it's something you have right now with Revelation you have it it's not that there won't be more Revelation even on the same thing but you have that Revelation you have that much substance and the substance will grow until we're body our bodies change right amen so the revelation of the Rapture is the substance of the Rapture and when you have the substance of the Rapture guess what you have Rapture Hallelujah so what's the bride looking for what's the message going to produce the revelation of the Rapture all right so now it's a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you you know it you know it that's right there's going to be somebody in this earth that knows it yes there's somebody's going to be walking with God because if you're walking with God you're going to end up the way Enoch end up right you become a wasnot yes the Lord why because of the moving and revelation of the Rapture hallelujah amen I'm I'm just bringing a lot here we're going to cover it all I'm going to go right back here because the Rapture is a person right it's not it's not something that's that's it's it's a substance and you were in God before the foundation of the world as substance then you were poured into a body of clay flesh but before Adam was poured into as a man he was made in the image of God which is spirit is that right before he became man of the earth he was Spirit then he moved as the Holy Spirit and moved and governed and God placed him in control of the earth and he and he moved just like the Holy Ghost moves us and and and and orders our way he ordered the Earth right who's ordering your earth right who's got control of your Earth if the word's in you the word has that control and you just let him do it you give your body you give yourself over to him and he does it see he has control if you let him have control amen you don't need to add to him or take from him he's perfect he's the word he's Flawless he can't make mistakes you make them man makes them but he never makes them right amen so who's he looking at If he if you're if he's in you he's not looking at you at you the body the man he's looking at himself through the blood the blood carries a life and you've got the life life so you stand perfect in his sight amen I went beyond myself now there we'll just back up here faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so amen so what was he walking by faith we live by faith we walk by his faith we live by his faith he we have been ordained to live by something we don't see with our carnal eyes but we see as substance that's greater than what you see with your carnal eyes because we look not we our Focus isn't on what we see that's temporal our focus is on the Eternal amen that's real this out here isn't real this is passing away you say well it looks real but it's not the real we're talking about the real has never had a beginning or end so you were in God's thinking of himself and God's in you now the thought of himself what he thought of himself to be you're acting that out okay so so now Faith is something has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham who could call anything to what he had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now Faith that's what faith is is the revelation of God now what's the True Believer paragraph 68 perfect Faith the prophet told us what a True Believer was the True Believer is the faith of God Amen that's moving in you it's working in you it's carrying you it's walking in you it's going somewhere yeah amen amen we have the view of the end the boy on the plank wrote it because his his eyes weren't down here what's all going around him his eyes were on the finish and he stayed steady he was walking he was riding by faith he saw the finish that was the goal he was pressing toward that right and you've been given the ability to press toward that and to make it because God by Revelation gives you Faith to walk in and it's his own and so here we are here we are the revelation of God what the True Believer is is moving in you the church is built upon the Revelation the whole entire body is built upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ Christ is now what he is today he was yesterday but what he is today is poured into another form the revelation of Jesus Christ in you is growing in that bride in this in the formation of the Bride coming to a full stature yes hallelujah amen what a full stature growing into maturity of who Christ because you always were Christ you're going into the full stature of Christ because why you are a new man you are a new creation all right now so on the on the message 65125 379 he said well I'm going to read that I'll read that in just a minute I'd like you to stand with me and turn to Psalm 27 please Psalms 2 7 brother Bram read this when he preached the message Rapture he said it was the background he wanted to read psalms 27 because it was the background of what he wanted to speak on pretty good background it was the background of it so Psalm 27 verse1 the Lord is my light hello the Lord is my light in him is no Darkness at all the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they will try remember the prophet said they will try to shut off the bride they will try to do that they'll try to stop the bride from ministering but they can't do it Prophet they'll try to close her up but they can't do it why she has the Revelation and walking in the faith of rapture she won't be shut up she can't be closed up she'll be taken up and she's on her way now amen she's marching now she's Marching In step with the revealed word of the hour which is the son of man revealed that's what she's walking in that's what she's testifying to Hallelujah right glory to God Amen all right so he says here now when the wicked they came to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell you can you can just absolutely you can absolutely trust that they will continually stumble and fall they can't shut her up they can't close her up up she's the word living amen she's Christ Living they couldn't shut him off yesterday they won't shut him off today he's here again in the full revelation of himself full Redemption the book The Promised book has been opened he's come to claim what he's redeemed full Redemption is now your possession it's the full revelation of Jesus Christ okay so he says verse three though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though Wars what the what is a host what is a host ecumenical move Council of churches that image will try to stop the bride right Hallelujah you say how can that be God said it would God said it would be that way God said it would rise up amen right and it's right in the formation now and we have even a president that's anointed to even bring it further than what the others have who who gives the power who's becoming politically strong the Council of churches the image to the Beast is becoming politically strong we know it we see it how long I don't know but the bride brother sister God wants you to see where you're standing who you are and that you have been positionally placed in Christ The Rapture amen I don't I let me say it Lord just as clear as I can we come with clearness of speech Paul said we're not coming with we're coming with with plainness of speech but there's an element though I speak Revelation there's still an element that has to take place and that is the Revelation to you personally amen you say you're excited Brother David I'm more than excited I'm stimulated and that's what taking us home is the simulation of Revelation amen the bride's been awakened there's a lot that don't see it but the bride has been awakened and what all others beside the bride don't see is they don't see the Awakening of the Bride she's awakened she's awakened to who she is the book opened up who she is the third pull is open the word amen I may preach this a lot faster than I thought all right all right though a h should encamp against me my heart my heart will not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord I'll be confident this one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life notice they dwell in the house of the Lord where what is the bride's Dwelling Place absolutely is in Christ that is her dwelling place where is his Dwelling Place in you behind your skin but your dwelling place is in that Revelation that's in your soul there's not enough devil there's nothing of hell can take that out of you when that's revealed in you amen amen amen for the time Hallelujah so that's our desire that we dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple see what the prophet's preaching here the Rapture you see what he's doing he said here's here's here's what has to here's the beginning of it here's the foundation here's the background for that body change amen all right for in the time of trouble verse five is this a time of trouble yeah you bet it is trouble on every hand this is the time of trouble for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle The Secret of his Tabernacle is that the word is in his Tabernacle the word is moving living amen all right the word is in the bride The Secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me He Shall Set me upon a rock a rock in the Bible means Revelation that's right amen and then verse six and now shall my head who's your head it's Christ now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle that's the body of Christ that's the bride that's Jesus Christ right I shall offer in that Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord amen Romans 8:30 you can go ahead and be seated I I won't keep you that standing that long but I had three scriptures here I wanted to base this on Romans 8 and verse 30 moreover whom he did let's take verse 29 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren firstborn did that firstborn take a Rapture yeah sure he did he raised up from the from the grave and raptured amen it's exactly all right he came right back in through the wall and ate meat have any meat here any fish we don't enter it our theophany body we don't eat it's the glorified body that eats am amen all right so he did Rapture so if he first raptured okay I'll just leave that hanging all right so in verse so he did pred conformed the image of his son that he might be the firstborn of many Brethren verse 30 moreover whom he did predestinate how did he do that by for knowledge then them he also called now we were through that a little bit on last Wednesday and whom he called he also Justified Justified means he has already declared you righteous amen that's what justification means it doesn't mean forgiven it means you never did Sin in the first place you are a part of him always was a part of him and the revelation of that would come in your season amen because you are this promised word for this season you are the message of the hour that's the revelation that's the message given to the bride it's himself the full revelation of himself the mystery of God would be finished all right so moreover whom he did predestinate he called those he had just those he called he justified declared righteous and whom he justified them he also say it with me glorified all ready glorified praise be to God sir is that his word are you here a believer of this word you're already glorified amen who's going to catch that Revelation all right now Colossians 1 12 starting with verse 12 Colossians giving thanks un the Father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light 271 light all right Psalm 271 light to be made make us meat who hath made us meat amen did not God give to Adam a wife a helpmate meat for him is that right all right so giving thanks unto the father who hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light was our Lord glorified he said I also will glorify you because I live you shall live also yes amen now we could say what a resurrection this that wasn't what a resurrection this is coming out of Darkness because the next verse says who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness right hath hath delivered us from the power of Darkness it's not your work it's not what you do or don't do it's what he's already done it's already what he performed promis it's already is he in he in you is able to bring every promise to manifestation because you will come to manifestation because you are himself the word living and manifested yes that's what the new birth is the new birth is him amen all right so here we are who have delivered us from the power of darkness and hath P hath past tense translated ated us translated means conveyed I'm going to jump ahead a little bit conveyed from one place to another hath already conveyed us I'm talking spiritually now have already conveyed Us by the revelation of it has already conveyed us from one place to another glory to God that ought to make every one of us a shout this Housetop to know that he's already brought that conveyance he put it in you and he that's in you has given you Birth has given you life has already given you the spirit of adoption and then if you have the spirit of adoption you must come to a full adoption Glory because it's him taking you there hallelujah praise the Lord who ha delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his Dear Son praise be to God all right now so translated conveyed from one place to another Revelation it's a revelation of the Rapture taking us to our body change caught up together to meet him in the air that's our body change we're looking for that we know that's the end of this this culminates in that coming but his coming has already started because he said I would come again and receive you to myself by taking the book and opening that and claiming you his as his redeem bringing you to a full Revelation and the message of this full Revelation is taking us to a meeting in the air what's taking us there the Rapture revealed in you and I hallelujah praise be to God you say you're just overly excited maybe I am but leave me alone I feel good this way amen it's more than feeling good right it's more than a good feeling it's more than an emotion it is the literal eternal life of Jesus Christ that's the token that he has given us to prove we are purchased and bought right amen and our life every day is ministering that to other people because our ministry is the unveiling of the word in Bride form the word himself that's our ministry Revelation or SE 2 Corinthians 4:1 our ministry is the opening of the his face in you and I to reality of who we are right that's his face amen cuz our heart the veil was removed and and and the unveiling of his his word is opened within us and that's a seal to us that's the token to us nothing can keep you out of that new body you now have working in you the revelation of the Rapture glory to God hallelujah hallelujah all right 65 11:25 message paragraph 379 some of you people this is invisible Union some of you people that really believe that really believe this to be the truth we're entering another age well brother brother brandom it can't be another a he called it an age other words a time a dispensation that in the fullness of the dispensation of time he would gather together in one all things in Jesus Christ right think of that he would gather all things in one in one person Christ is not divided Christ is not organization Christ is not denominationalism Christ is a person and the bride is his person himself in that form of bride form it's not another person it's Christ in you God's Great let me say it again Christ in you God's great Revelation that's why she can't be closed up amen everything has to come to its moment everything has to come to its time amen Jesus even told them they tried to do away me said it wasn't his time it wasn't time for the word to be fulfilled at that moment but here we are brother sister here we are in the time and we're coming to a moment that we which are alive and remain that Rapture within us as a revelation it's going to change our mortal body that Holy Spirit that's in us that word quickened that word Made Alive the Rapture which is a person is going to change these mortal bodies we already have it working there's the the Assurance is given to us amen our Focus we don't care about the world Let It Go the way it want want is politics we see the way it's going we see where it's going but we're going another Direction they're going downward we're going upward they only appear once we appear twice the one in the beginning is the one in the end we are alpha and omega as he as Alpha and Omega we are alpha and omega amen amen the beginning word the original word and the word at the end is the same word praise be to God he had in the back part of his mind what he would make known in this hour and what he made known would be the revelation of the Rapture two individual bride to individual members that are sitting right here this morning think of this it's not what my wife does my husband did or didn't do forget that what are you doing what are you doing with this Jesus called Christ what's happening in you where are you going what are you taking why don't you just begin to express it and may the token be on display not trying to make it happen make it happen trying to do something just let go and letting him have control over you letting him take you because he's spirit is that right and he Spirit has hands yours he has feet yours he has eyes yours he has ears yours yes amen he has a mouth yours same person Same Spirit yes in Bride form by a same Birth by the by the ministry of the spoken word he has birth and is birthing a bride into manifestation this hour she knows where she stands she's positionally placed in Christ amen thank God for that amen she's been positionally placed in the Rapture praise be to God amen and so some of you people that really believe this is the truth that we're entering another age we are entering the r Rapture age here's the Turning of the corner here's the Turning of the corner the prophet turned the corner Revelations 41 was a turning of the corner for the bride out of RA out of Leo DEA she spiritually raptured she heard the trumpet call amen the same voice that John heard beginning of those Church ages he hears at the end of the last Church age and it's the same voice the same call come up higher Hallelujah some of you people he said we're entering the Rapture age and we and he called it bride age he called it bride time he called it the seed time in manifestation of the seed which is what who's the seed and what was the manifestation of the seed amen who's the Royal seed but he said there's got to stand in this hour the promise word is being fulfilled there's got to send in this hour a royal seed which would be a royal bride she must come on the scene in order to fulfill the scriptures and what he said there has to come a bride right amen go back to Genesis and see if there didn't have to come a bride amen all right so you he said so what is this bride age bride time what is this brother brandom called it a virgin word time she's brother the prophet said she's a virgin birthed word yes he was a virgin born word we are spoken word not physically I'm not talking physically I'm talking about the spiritual revelation of the Rapture has to be in you before you can have a body change the revelation of your how many knows that when you have caught the revelation of your healing that finished it you're healed I can say I've been healed over and over and over again because God revealed it to me that I'm Healed I have that Revelation where to take it to where to take me to I could call those things that I feel as though they was not because I had a revelation that I'm Healed I'm well amen right you have the Revelation that you're well that you're healed why because he said so am amen and you can't be you can't say I'm sick when he said you're healed so what are you saying what is your life saying amen I'm Healed brother sister I'm not talking about a perfect health you probably get sick again but I'm talking about a perfect faith I'm not talking about a perfect mortal body right now I'm talking about a perfect Lord in a perfect word through a perfect blood has loosed you washed you and cleansed you you are free indeed amen amen hallelujah amen amen that's it all right so so here we come he says now it's a virgin word time Christ the bride Andor Christ in bride form what's the Virgin word time Christ the bride or we could say or Andor Christ in Bride form same thing who is this Christ she he's the bride I said let me say it again in the beginning Adam called that woman that came out of him woman because she was a part of the man and all he what he said is she's me and we had a Prophet come back with the unveiling of what he hid there and would work it Through the Ages and come down here at the last and show you who you are he said she is me yeah amen amen is that what what he said bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his spirit Power of his power word of his word rapture of his Rapture revelation of the resurrection of his resurrection who is she the prophet having the word of the Lord said she's him yeah amen you don't have to jump up and make it happen anything happen you get the life of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ's own life will work through you and reveal to you the word for the season amen it's not a word of yesterday it's not a Pentecostal message in the Pentecostal age that age is passed thank the Lord for that age but it made way for the Holy Ghost himself to come right back into the word again not not emotion again not a Feeling Again not tongues again not gifts again we all believe in those things but the word again back in flesh again with the same Authority and the same Revelation that he had walking upon the Earth with the same Revelation in you what is it the manifestation of the promise is working in you that's all right now my he said so friends it's moving right now friend it's on the move for it's on the Move excuse me it's on it's on he said the it's moving right now friend and it's on the move is on for the bride the move isn't on for the church carnal the move isn't on for the church he he differentiate he said there's a bride and there's church after the opening of the seals he said I'll call you bride it's different bride bride is a married woman woman different than the church the church is a good Sanctified woman out here but she's not bride amen there's a difference that's why the carnal Believers will always come against you and say who do you think you are it's not who I think I am it's who he said I am right amen hallelujah all right now he said he said the move is on the for the bride that's the truth he said that's thus saith the Lord the move is on for the bride amen where is she going where's she going she'll leave so so so suddenly because her her whole time here has been a a non-public show this working in her is not a public show it's the seventh seal unveiled she is that seventh seal unveiled she is that opened word she is that third pull amen amen you say what's the third pull the opening of the word he came to Quicken his word he come to release his word he come to make his word known he come to make himself known amen amen well he said so it's on it's thus sayth the Lord then he turns and says well in the Rapture time now he said Rapture age now it's Rapture time in the Rapture time which is Matthew 2510 they that were ready went into the marriage is that right he refers to that he said the bridegroom call went out behold the bridegroom cometh and everybody rose up one didn't have oil they can only go so far the other had the oil in their vessel they had the oil they had the oil on the word the word and the oil came together in the vessel they had it to anoint that word to receive that word and when they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and when the last one come in or other words at the last Trump do you know that call I pray it's still going out because the bride is the final voice right she's calls and she's still calling and what the prophet said come out of her do you realize that voice is still voicing yes come out of her come out of her my people not my group not my servants my people My Bride come out of her and it still calls but it's going to call for the last time because when that last call the last one comes in and recognizes who she is the door's clut the door is shut right that's it she can be in that in behind that door for a period of time yet it's preaching to the Eternal lost but preaching for the bride because it's to the bride and it's to that church what church Sanctified Church yeah but they can only go so far because when the door was shut they came and the bride was already in and they came back and said well we thought there was to be a Rapture let us in let us in he said I don't know you amen they're left out in what tribulation but they rise up again in the white Throne judgment and given life because their names were found on the book of life because they wouldn't bow to that to that image because they recognized what they missed see they didn't have oil they had the lamp they had the word oh we got the word we got the word we believe God sent a prophet we got the word but no revelation of that word amen are you with me no revelation of it and so they missed the bride Rapture because they weren't part of the Bride they were good clean cloth they were the they were in the L in The Book of Life you could say lamb book of life but the bride was in another section of that book yes it was called the bride section go back to suon church age and see if that's not the truth brother Ram said she was ordained in a certain portion of that book called a little book opened a little book within that book her names would never be removed the names of the Bride could never be removed all the cloth all the cloth with good clean cloth but he put the pattern on that cloth and said this is the bride section and cut out the bride amen amen amen amen amen they were ready to go into marriage amen why they had the oil they were born again they they miss being in the bride because they're not born again oh they've been repented they've been baptized but they didn't go any further right good sanctified people the clean the cloth was clean now are those there are those I don't want to get into this CU another message and I've already been through it but those names that were taken off of the book were those that resisted that word resisted that message had a wrong attitude toward the word when it was brought to them of the truth and went back just like just like Lot's wife turned around is that right when they started out but they turned around and Luke and and and not not Luke I mean uh lot was a lukewarm carnal believer but he didn't turn around but his wife did turn around and went back and that name is removed the prophet said they because they rejected the message they didn't believe what was said they turned around and looked back cuz their heart never left Sodom right amen those carnal denominations system churches is nothing but sodom's religion it's a dominating female spirit and don't think that's left out here it tries to come in and upset the bride too amen but the bride is not a dominating female she is subject to the word loves the word amen himself all right I've gotten way off off track here but let's go back not off track necessarily no it it's still part of the Rapture all right the bride okay so bridegroom came to receive his bride it wasn't a public show it's a secret catching away brother sister that has been happening and I pray that it's still happening it's a secret it is and it is happening there's a secret catching away the coming of the Lord which the bride sees the bridegroom she's in Union with him it's not a public show the curtain has dropped nobody can enter that without the token amen all right all right so he poured himself now he did that to receive a bride a secret catching way taking her to a body change in in in what what how is he taking us right now into a body change how's he doing it in a Rapture we're going to a body change a mortal body change but we have to we are going in a spiritual New Birth in a word body in a new body in a new man amen which is Jesus Christ in you the new birth that's how we're going to a body change because we know him because he knew us first yes you think it's anything we could just pump ourselves up to do this no it's the fact is that he made himself known that we were in him he knew us and because he knew us we could know him and would know him because my sheep know my voice why because they were part of the revelation of himself they were the revelation of himself for this day and this day is the full revelation of himself so where does that put us bride one one not only together we're one with him we're no longer Twain the marriage is come Hallelujah Greek to some open to others that's exactly what's happening I am not responsible for who can or who can't I am responsible for what I'm doing with the word I'm responsible to preach this word I'm responsible for preaching the word for your season amen and that season has left a Pentecostal season that was good in it season we needed in its season is that right the restoration of the gifts the baptism of the Holy Ghost but if you got a true baptism of the Holy Ghost you're going to see and walk in the revelation of the Rapture for the word and the word for the season right because when that comes in you it begins to grow up what is it growing up into a perfect faith for a perfect Rapture that is already perfect Faith but what has it got to do it's got to grow is that right is that right doesn't the bride isn't she birthed and have to grow into maturity by these precious promises we are made partakers of his divine nature am and where's it growing it's growing in the bride how's he manifested himself Amen in the formation of what the revelation of Jesus Christ himself in the formation of the Bride go back to things that are to be and see if that's not what he said the problem is is that people don't want to spend time in the word they'd rather spend time busy with the world things the world and the world swallowing them up yes they can't bring fruit they start to bring fruit but they bring no fruit to Perfection CU where do you find faith that pleases God where you going to find Faith where you going to find the revelation of the Rapture it's going to be because you're feeding and in on the open book right you said Brother David You Preach like you're mad I'm not mad at anybody I can't help how I preach I guess they thought John the Baptist was mad I'm not John the Baptist but I can't be something I'm not but I love every one of you with a with a pure heart of faith and Pure Heart of the Lord amen God knows that I am zealous for this message I am zealous for those that I know have got and God won't miss a one but by the foolishness of preaching He makes himself known preaching of what what's the bride's voice it's not another voice what the spirit said the prophet says what the prophet says the bride will say and they say come come where come into position come into your placing come into Rapture the revelation of the message is a Rapture Revelation amen praise the Lord what time is it oh I still got a little bit all right now now he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world God in you like he was in Jesus Christ God in you like he was in Jesus Christ amen all right he said the works I do you'll do also why his life is in you what' he do when the when the word for the season what was he he was the manifestation of the word for It season he was doing his father's will he said I come to do the will of my father he was manifesting the word for its season in time amen can the bride do any different when it's the same person how can it be different he poured he said what all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church that's God in you he that's in you see you are more now this is my statement he said see I said see you are more than this flesh man Jesus was more than a man amen is that right he had the voice of the Resurrection he called Lazarus come forth that was the voice of the Resurrection that same voice the bride becomes the same voice to the final age she is that voice why because Jesus Christ and the bride are no longer Twain the word has United them together amen amen he said oh brother if I could just that if I quit trying to live it let him live it that's it what's revealed in you do you know you're born again that's well then relax do you think he's going to allow you to wander off over here and you try to figure this out try to figure that out no he didn't ask you to figure anything out he said let me do it let me bring my word in season let me reveal it to you as I as you have need of it right amen it's not your achievement it's not what you reason to do it's what he said to do but you'll obey every word whether it takes the height off your back or what it does you're going to line up with the word that he said do amen not your reasoning well I have reasoning I don't think quit putting your opinion to it quit putting your reasoning to it and line up with the word he that is in you will follow that word amen it won't follow another all right and all Christ was he poured into the church that's God in you see he that's in you then you're more than a flesh man this is not the real you the flesh man you are quickened you are the quickened word in you in your soul the inward man the quickening spirit the new man the Rapture amen the new man the Rapture you are the new creation the old things are passed away behold all things are become new right sounds like a Rapture to me when do you expect this one to become new will it not pass away and behold A New Earth amen all right he said it's Jes paragraph 290 I've said this many times Christ's mystery here here it is again it's Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you what is the new birth it's Jesus Christ revealed in you amen right that's the new birth it's not you imagined it you know it amen now don't go reasoning with it if you have ad met that get to desperation say God I got to have it I've got to have that Revelation maybe it's become told maybe you once did and now you've lost it through this all this struggle say God renew it to me then amen amen don't say well because I believe God sent a prophet and I go to church that's good enough that's not good enough you'll never make a Rapture like that you must have that token token is a literal life of Jesus Christ revealed in you amen you say well I just made a mistake and I that's what the devil's telling you because you did this you did that you did this but if that Revelation ever comes to you God's not judging you by this outer man he's judging you through Christ amen right I let me get to I got it right here let me get it to you amen all right see said he said it's revealed in you who is the rapture is Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you that's the Rapture that he has the pinenes that he can express might Express his words and anything that he's promised in the last days he can bring it to pass through his body as he's working who is his body is there anyone here that is his body that's his bride it's his body she is the Flesh of him she's the bone of him she is his body and he's bringing to pass every word through his body amen amen all right because he's working through a body amen it's exactly the word of God made manifest the Rapture is now in us the revelation of the Rapture is in us he is the rapture revealed in you then the Rapture is a person and that person is Christ in you and if Christ is in you you've done made the Rapture amen amen spiritually I'm talking about not mortally you're going to that but what's taking you there is that Revelation Christ in you is the rapture hallelujah it's a person the resurrection's a person the Rapture is a person when he raised you raised with him when he raptured you did what already raptured right praise the Lord I say praise the Lord if no one's going to say praise the Lord I'm saying praise the Lord this is more real to me than I'm standing here this is more real to me than my necessary meat this is the real this is the opening of the word this is the bride's Ministry amen amen amen that was the seventh Angels Ministry amen how dides it come well by my efforts of course I had to do good works nonsense it's a bunch of hogwash you never had a thing to do with it he predestinated you chose you called you put in you the revelation of the word put in you the desire for more of him put in you one thing I've got to have more I've got to have him I must have him I'm here to manifest him I'm here to do his works it's he and me living it's he and me working it's he and me and my name is him because I'm in Union with him I am misss oneel difference he's Mr Jesus Christ I Ms Jesus Christ a virgin born word a spoken word birth not natural birth spiritual birth the spiritual birth is greater than the natural birth right Jesus said himself I can do nothing unless the father shows me and he was a virgin born natural mortal being but what about the spiritual being right that comes by the same word the first man was the earth Earthly the second man is a quickening spirit also I said it's the Lord From Heaven so who are you bride where did you come from you came from the same Source he came from you came from the same word you are the Royal seed of himself you are his bride and she is promised to be here in this hour you are the Fulfillment of scripture you are what God Said would be here now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in a bride coming in a bride where's she going where are they going into a body change what's taking her there the revelation of the Rapture which is Jesus Christ in you the new creation the new man you see you've already you've already changed then just reckon Yourself Dead you're already dead in Christ right amen you're dead in Christ isn't that wonderful when he died you died with him amen and now you pass from Death to life amen see see he's the one that's the Rapture in you the token showing you raised with him the token is showing that you raised with him and you raptured with him who who's going to keep you out of the body chains then the purchase is already made all you have to do is show the token the prophet said when you pray show the token apply the token right oh but Brother David you just don't know what troubles I have and what I can't make it I can't make it if you want to keep thinking that go ahead because your thoughts are creating an atmosphere too I can't do this I can't do that oh really he said you could now what does your heart say he gave you the ability to do it amen where are you going to rest there's only two Powers there's only two Powers two Vines two Spirits from two different fathers who's your father okay it puts you right where you need to be then what's the answer let go and let God have his wonderful way with your soul amen amen we're we're way down the line here brother sister God's been maturing a bride I believe with all my heart these Seven Stars may be the very answer because what it even happened on the day of the cloud ring 28th of February seven stars seven Messengers seven aent es completion where are we at and then a message what is the message of rapture all right now this message is sent for the going home of the Bride the move is on whom the sun sets free see don't you realize that he's achieved it all it's all achieved in him you have him you have the Rapture let me say that again him revealed in you is the rapture revealed in you amen no wonder the prophet said they're going to look for that Revelation amen that's exactly what's taking her home that's exactly what maturity spells that's exactly what it is the word is being preached to you this morning in maturity that wasn't my words I'm not talking about David I'm talking about Christ Among Us I'm I'm talking about the bride Among Us amen right all right the message is sent for your going home for the move is on you are Marching In step of the word out of here you're marching out of here you are on your way to a body change already having the earnest of the Rapture already revealed in you already sealed in to the day of that change you have the token nobody can keep keep you from your body new body it's already been bought now we see the Promise as I said being fulfilled i' I've already spoken a lot of this so let me just if I can just go over some things Hebrews 11 let's go over to Hebrews 11 Hebrews the 11th chapter beginning now we know what faith is let's go beyond that to verse five by what by by faith Hallelujah by faith Enoch which is our type the second the the seventh from Adam where are we what are we where are we now the seventh from the second Adam amen amen are you with me yeah all right what came out of that what came out of the message at the end of the seventh age what came out we're at the end brother sister there no say we still got time we're at the end I don't know how much longer but we're at the end we've already done enter to bride age all right the Corner's already turned but did you turn with the corner that's the thing yeah have you turned with it we're not building a wall we're building a house the prophet said yeah and don't don't don't kick out the Cornerstone because the Cornerstone has become the head of the corner yeah and this is where we at the bride is fulfilling scripture because she's got to glorify him the head she comes in the for she's made known in the formation of the head because being here she being here she's the revelation of the head yes right amen all right so by faith Enoch which is our type Enoch was translated uhoh same word amen same word in Colossians 113 Enoch was translated conveyed from one position to another position from one place to another place have you been conveyed from one position to another position yes amen thank God thank the Lord Jesus that he Christ hath positionally placed us we've been positionally placed who did that did your good works do that did your M did your well I can I can keep myself I don't have any mistakes you won't make it because those that make it go through trials tests and mistakes and failures absolutely failures had nothing to do what's inside your soul that's right if you're born again has not a thing to do with it right amen cuz you didn't desire wouldn't desire to do it in the first place so in this flesh you're going to have failures some mistakes so quit listening to the devil to beat you down because of those things because of your feelings because of your senses because of your reasoning amen the word doesn't need any reasoning it can't be reasoned with it's perfect it's Flawless he's already positioned you he's not judging you by the outer man right if that's the case he didn't need to die for you then because when he died for you shed the blood for you and washed you you're washed you're loose and the loosing and the washing is absolutely perfect there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus because why you're not here with any ambition any desire to walk according to the flesh when you're in Christ you are not walking according to this flesh amen when you're birthed in Christ you will you are not walking according to this flesh and you have the discernment to know the difference and if you should make a mistake the prophet said being born again he would show you and when he shows you Lord I didn't mean to do that it's already finished it's already worked The Works finished I've already chose you I've already elected you I've already placed you in myself and I'm revealing myself to you despite your failures God glory to God and every one of those failures are bringing you to the realization of that very thing and causing you to let go and walk in the character of Jesus Christ will you perfect this flesh and bring this flesh to Perfection no you're going to be you're going to be bothered by it you're going to be a sticky carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you're remaining in this body but you have victory over your enemy you have victory over this evil one this man you have victory over it already right you've been already given victory over it over it that's you're more than a conqueror you're in the Conquering one can anything separate you from the love of God can failures can mistakes can things above things in the past your failures you're this you're that you did this you did that not a one of the things she'll be able to separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus now that settles it that ought to settle it in your soul it ought to settle it yes it's not whether you reason with it and feel it oh I just don't feel what you're saying I don't feel it quit you're trying to feel and realize that the feeling goes deeper it's my Revelation it's down in your soul either your soul says yes or it says no and the devil's going to come in your mind and he's going to battle with you because he hates the word and he hates the word manifested because you are the very manifestation of the word for this hour and this [Applause] day and he's against you and you know you have an enemy and the evil one brother bam said is your own body your own flesh man your own carnal my mind is enmity it's an enemy against God that's right he never said for us to walk by that he said walk by the Revelation I give you and reckon Yourself Dead every day to sin right amen and he said take up your cross daily deny yourself take up your cross and follow me where is he he's leading you he's your shepherd I shall not want he'll make me to Li down in Green Pastures Lead Me beside the Still Waters yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death brother sister you don't have to free have to fear a shadow it's a shadow the shadow only points to light you wouldn't have a shadow unless you had light and the light is shining in your soul it's creating a shadow out here but the devil's trying to get you to fear the shadow though I walk through the shadow of the of the of the shadow of the valley the shadow of death I will fear no Vil why because thou art with me I'll be with you even in you oh my all right I got to finish here but look at how this is spoken of in i in Hebrews I didn't finish this listen carefully how this is read by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death brother sister before Enoch's body was changed the scripture said he was already translated that he should not see death he already had the Revelation and we're here like Enoch see the type in the Bible he walked with God how could he walk with God unless he was sinless oh that's a good one brother David you just said we have troubles I'm not talking about this being sinless right I'm not talking about this right every Born Again believer in Jesus Christ is sinless because you're in the sinless one how can you have sin when you're in the sinless one that's right sin is not counted against you when you're in Jesus Christ all he can see is himself who did he see in Enoch who is in Enoch and you're under the blood he was under he where was he at Walking with God what made him walk with God he was the seed of God right God was his father yeah look at him walking with God having this Revelation already in him that he wouldn't see death it was already a revelation to him he had already been changed spiritually yeah and then it goes on to say and was not found and conjunction was not found amen for for because God had translated him now watch here it is for before his translation he had this Revelation which was his testimony amen are you with with me he said he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is not an a was not a will be though he was and will be but is amen and he that is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently diligently seek him draw an nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you seek Him and you'll find him amen they that hunger and thirst for righteousness shall be filled say you don't believe that who's lie then who you're going to believe you're going to believe the lie if you don't believe the truth you have to turn down the word which is truth to believe a lie right all right but look at how he translated now if we go to what the prophet said he said this Rapture this this let me just find where he brought this out he said oh here it is 318 first seal 63 Enoch walked before God for 500 years and had a testimony now here's his testimony that he pleased god with raptured faith fath right praise God see his testimony before he even changed before he even had a body change he pleased god with that revelation of rapture you see why I'm so excited about our testimony then what are we facing how soon is it we see the politics and church controlling politics and the church was such phenomenal wealth she'll buy out the whole country and nation and she'll do it you can see it's working right towards that about ready to have a a new pope I wonder if the next one will come out of the US Amen brother sister what's holding off this thing right now what's holding what's you see who that false prophet is you see who the Antichrist is you know who the Beast is yeah but the others are blind to it even many in the message are blind to it because it's working right around the message and they don't even know it can't discern it why they need to be born again David can't discern anything David can do nothing if I try to rely upon David and my own ideas and lean to my own understanding I'll fail I fail every time right amen but he can't fail and he's in you and he's in me and he's translated us already spiritually because before our body change we have this testimony that we're walking in a Rapture faith we are in a Rapture age glory to God Amen that's exactly right remember all right so he said see he pleased God and just started walking right out every step a little higher why he walking in the light walking in the light walking in the light he had more than a word he had Dynamics mechanics together that's why he could walk a little step higher a little step higher a little amen because we're not here to minister the letter we're here to minister the spirit of that letter amen amen we are here to worship Him in true worship which is spirit and Truth together amen amen now amen Ephesians 1 I won't be long now if you just give me about can you give me about 10 minutes I don't hear any answer okay well okay and I preach long enough then yes or no yes all right yeah that's not the majority but that's minority I wish he'd shut up so we can go home and fill our bellies you say that was harsh no it isn't it's truth because whether you say it out what are you thinking but I'm going to continue just a little bit here amen now because I'll tell you we're so taken up with impatience we need patience we can spend two or three hours watching a movie and feed on it but when it comes to the word for the hour and the day what are you going to do go out there and stand around go out to a restaurant and go home and take a nap I'm not against those things but why can't we give time to the word I'll tell you why because we're at the end and the church has cooled off it's come to church go home come to church go home but I know in a little group in minority there's a people that love this I know that that's what keeps me going he say well you're overtime since when have we made a time you can't put God In The Box that's right I'm not Bering anybody I believe he's speaking these words to every one of us amen well you could say it a little nicer you know you could have love in what you say you don't know love you're looking at filio instead of agape love because God would do everything he can to keep you out of hell and turning your back on this message God is feeding his bride amen all right 122 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church is he or isn't he he is all right which is his body the church is his body the fullness of him the fullness of him the fullness of him that filth with all in all and verse one chapter 2 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins what's quickened mean Made Alive raptured new creation verse five even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus hath made us sit together in Heavenly places not only have you raised you've raptured amen because now you're setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus do you see that say amen amen all right I'm going to bypass Luke 1731 I'll read this and I'm going to have to stop Luke chapter 17 verse 30 well we know the re the son of man is being revealed verse 31 in that day what day the day of his Revelation the day when the son of man was being revealed Abraham and Sarah being revealed as it was in that day in that day he which shall be upon the Housetop and his stuff on the house let him not come down to take away and he that is in the field let him not likewise return back other words you've marched forward you've gone forward quit trying to go back amen you've gone up the Housetop go higher yeah don't go down and get your stuff out of the house you passed that by are you're willing to sell everything sell out to make that Rapture then just keep moving forward keep going forward don't come back don't go back what's he say here remember Lot's wife many have started this message many went started out with it and after 40 even 50 years have turned their back into a denominational hogwash right turned right around why they never had that in them to begin with remember Lot's wife all right he said will you go also turning to disciples Peter said where would we go you have the words of eternal life either this message does or why don't you go find the original because you can't have a copy you can't have a wrong one without original first if they don't believe this is the prophet of the hour the message of the hour then go find the one that is you say well this this is a false prophet go find the real one you can't have a false without a real amen all right now I'm going to bypass this they become one unit we know that no longer Twain okay that's the way a Christian is we're planted in Christ and just drink and we drink and we drink and we push out brother Braham said and drink a little more and when you drink a little more than what's required of you to drink just a little bit here a little bit just drink a little more and then you'll push out you'll push out you'll push out what fruit you'll push out Rapture you'll push out Revel you'll push out Resurrection you're going to push out a body change cuz everything that seed ever was was in the seed to begin with everything you ever was was in the seed to begin with amen you just plant it all right and he planted it and you drink and drink and drink and push out and everything we have need of for this Earthly Journey Divine Healing power of God all these other things is in every individual here that's received the Born Again experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for you are planted in Christ Hallelujah the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you have need of for this journey even the Rapture is right in you then even the Rapture is right in you then don't resent that he felt the resentment don't you resent that he said that's the truth the Rapture is in us now I'll prove it by the gospel those that he called he justified those that he justified Heath glorified Hallelujah he said amen then in heaven today we're glorified in the presence of God right now I'm just pushing out to it I'm just pushing out to it are you pushing out to it this morning are you pushing out to it every day are you giving time for him are you feeding on the word is he your head every moment of the day is he your head is he where you turn is he on your mind if you have the mind of Christ whose mind is stayed on Thee I will keep in perfect peace because he trusts in you all right his Spirit the manifestation he's the same yesterday today and forever would anybody say that's not so we've seen it so we know it's so he said let that he said and the manifestation of his Spirit listen to him now is is is catching away a bride amen it's a secret catching away not a public show this seven seal is not revealed to the public if if that when that Antichrist is revealed to the public as that person the bride's already gone that's how close we are right because he who lth will let until he Christ the bride is taken out of here I said Christ the bride she's not another person that is her identification that's who she is that's her stand and that's her Revelation and she's been possed positionally placed right there and everything Christ ever had in him is yours and all that he ever was you are and all that you are he was am what is it it's the unveiling of God and we've come to that place right now that he's unveiled himself right down to us right down in us right down in the form of his bride it's the bride coming of Christ and we see it coming and it's going to be finished in a meeting in the air am let's Stand Together there's three comings he said the first time he comes is to redeem that wasn't complete until he we know that Prophet said that wasn't yet complete fully until he claimed what he had redeemed then the full Revelation comes all right then everything now he said now the second time he said he come to redeem the second time he comes to catch away his his bride I just told you you're being caught away he said it Like A Love Like A Love Affair he's pouring in himself they are becoming one for the wedding supper and he said it's a love affair all right he said right here it's a love affair Like A Love Affair amen he comes around and steals her out at night time takes her away from the world to meet him in the air the secret coming of the Lord here we are bride I say to the bride and I don't know I'm not saying who's bride and who isn't I'm saying to the bride this morning rise Shine Your Light has come amen and the glory of the Lord you can't be glorified without the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee amen amen it's risen upon thee and the Bible said he wouldn't share his glory with another but the bride is not another he said he just said in Isaiah 61 he would pour His glory out on thee yeah amen all [Music] right everything you have need of It's A Love Affair the church goes through the tribulation not the bride the bride is Justified she goes straight to glory and a Rapture that's right she in my opinion the last member will be caught up one of these days the the last member will be caught up one of these days other words it's an ongoing thing that's right he's catching away secret catching away here it is again one of these days the last member will be caught up one of these days it might come and you wouldn't know nothing about it and they won't who's they won't everybody but bride they won't know it they'll say I thought the Rapture was supposed to take place and the on the word come back it's already happened you didn't know it that's how secret it is see then what Brother David what is being preached today what's the word in this season the secret the mystery it's unveiled in [Music] you it might come and you would know nothing about it remember it's a se he says it again it's a secret secret catching [Music] away we're into well well we are well into that third pole that's my statement that is our ministry what what are we coming now we're coming to Perfection because the people has to come to that in order for the Rapture body change that's what's holding it away right now waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured Faith what you going to do to get it it's in you it's already in you what are you going to do how's it going to mature by your feeding upon the open book let's stop our foolishness let's lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset you all your impatience all of these things lay it aside let's get down to serious business with this word let's get down to real serious business with it what playing around with it quit playing church when you come to church let's get down to business we come to meet him do you know who he is and that I say to every one of us individually do you know him there's a difference in knowing about him but life is to know him all right I'm not going to turn to it but in 1 Thessalonians 5 1-5 the Bible said when they say peace and safety then cometh this sudden destruction as cometh upon a woman that has child and the travail comes suddenly upon her she can be doing the dishes humming a song and oh it started something caused that she was holding a mystery but you saw the token living right before you Mary was filled with the Holy Ghost she began to show it are you with me she had to eat and she had to eat she had to drink and drink she was feeding that child [Music] hello all right but it's going to come upon them and they before they even know it they they think they they think they're okay you know what the prophet said about that soon cometh the earthquake amen Church age book here it is they are miserable who are who is these people caught up in that denominational system that whole system is nothing but a miserable wretch and he said they're miserable that means that they objects to be pied pied they scorn pity they are full of Pride they vaun what they have but what they have will not stand the test of time there's only one thing has stood the test of time and that's the word of the Lord they have build upon the quick sand rather than the Rock revelation of God's word soon cometh the earthquake what's that represent Zechariah 14 brother brandom's on preaching who do you say this is said we see a last day happening let's turn to Zechariah 14 that earthquake as it was in the days of Uzziah split open Mount of Olives watch it he said that's a happening that shows we see the coming of the Lord here oh wow we know that when Christ died there was an earthquake brother Bram said 1964 earthquake in Fairbanks Alaska was he was officially put out of that system that's what that earthquake meant he died They Crucified him aresh Jehovah Gyra it's either one two or three you'll find it what has he been predicting all this time

time of the Resurrection what are we looking for we're looking for the resurrection we're expecting at any moment any time even the next moment now it could be before you leave this room right are you
