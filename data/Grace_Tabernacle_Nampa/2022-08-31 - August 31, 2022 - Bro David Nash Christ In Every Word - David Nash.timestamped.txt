[29:02] we've heard the story about the woman
[29:04] she said yeah
[29:06] i ain't what i ought to be and ain't
[29:08] what i want to be
[29:09] but i'm sure not what i
[29:13] so praise god for that promise
[29:15] that we can stand on tonight before i
[29:18] forget i usually do which i shouldn't
[29:20] but greetings from my family my wife was
[29:23] the air conditioner went out today and
[29:24] after sitting in 92 degrees heat the
[29:27] whole day she was honey the the back the
[29:30] little air conditioner in the back works
[29:32] she goes i got to just sit here
[29:35] so she's at home listening online and
[29:38] getting cooled back down but
[29:41] also the little church in tri-cities
[29:43] we've had a few bumps and bruises lately
[29:45] we uh
[29:46] some thieves broke in and took all of
[29:48] our internet equipment and stuff
[29:50] and
[29:52] i told the church that i said we must
[29:53] have done something really right
[29:56] because he don't like us
[29:58] as little as we are he doesn't want
[30:00] anybody out there to know what we're
[30:02] talking about
[30:04] so praise the lord and then come to find
[30:06] out
[30:08] the policemen that came and looked at it
[30:11] they're going this is so peculiar
[30:14] because they left the audio equipment
[30:15] the old audio equipment called the new
[30:18] stuff
[30:19] but they even took the took all the
[30:20] janitorial supplies they left us one
[30:22] roll of paper towels for the bathroom
[30:25] and one roll of toilet paper
[30:28] i don't know what that's got to do
[30:30] [Laughter]
[30:32] with anything but they even took the mop
[30:34] in the mop bucket
[30:36] but so i was talking this last a few
[30:39] days ago to brother jonah emke
[30:41] and i got to tell him and he goes
[30:43] brother he goes the exact same thing
[30:46] happened to us two months ago
[30:49] i said really and he goes yeah and they
[30:51] because they had taken our audio
[30:52] equipment and left it outside in the
[30:54] parking lot he said they even left our
[30:56] audio equipment on the stairs of the
[30:57] church
[30:59] i'm going now that's peculiar so i told
[31:02] brother jim when we got to church
[31:05] on sunday and he goes that makes me
[31:07] actually feel pretty good
[31:09] because the policeman had told us it was
[31:11] a professional job so at least the
[31:13] professionals are after us it's not just
[31:15] kids
[31:17] but uh he said he was talking to a
[31:19] friend in mount vernon oregon and they
[31:21] had an almost an identical experience
[31:25] so that well
[31:27] praise the lord the devil's mad about
[31:29] something
[31:31] and i'm glad to be
[31:33] on his bad list i guess
[31:35] i'm happy to be on god's list
[31:38] let's uh go ahead and read the
[31:39] scriptures so you can be seated
[31:41] again greetings from the folks up there
[31:43] i know they love you and get here
[31:45] anytime they can and always enjoy it
[31:48] let's uh i told the brother
[31:51] genesis 1 1 but i want to start with
[31:53] genesis 1 and 31
[31:56] and then we'll drop back
[32:02] and it reads as we read it as gentiles
[32:06] it said and god saw everything that he
[32:08] had made and behold it was very good
[32:11] and the evening and the morning were the
[32:14] sixth day
[32:16] lord jesus we've read your scripture
[32:19] may you bless it now to the hearts of
[32:21] the people in the name of jesus christ
[32:23] amen please be seated
[32:28] when i think about scripture
[32:31] and we know brother branham used the
[32:32] word bible i think it was
[32:34] i know we've looked it up before i think
[32:36] it's like 13 000 times
[32:39] the message of the hour is about this
[32:41] book
[32:42] and when people come up with doctrines
[32:44] or
[32:46] you know what talks about every wind of
[32:47] doctrine and so forth when they come up
[32:50] with those things if you can't find it
[32:52] in this book forget it
[32:54] it's just nonsense
[32:57] it's man's ideas
[32:59] it's
[33:00] not
[33:01] god
[33:02] because in the beginning was the word
[33:04] the word was with god the word was god
[33:07] and this is called the word
[33:09] of god
[33:10] scripture itself tells us that every
[33:13] word
[33:14] is inspired to give us
[33:17] some portion each day
[33:20] and then as a as we we look at it too
[33:22] another place you know brother branham
[33:24] said that
[33:25] we have to remember that it's an eastern
[33:27] book
[33:28] and we're looking at it through western
[33:30] eyes and even the way we read it as you
[33:33] can see there it says and god saw that
[33:36] everything he had made and behold it was
[33:37] very good in the evening in the morning
[33:39] with the sixth day but the hebrew read
[33:41] from the right to the left or often
[33:43] times from the last to the first so you
[33:45] could be looking at that and say
[33:49] the morning or in the sixth day
[33:52] where there was morning and evening
[33:55] it was very good and god saw
[33:58] that he had made it
[33:59] and behold that means to look at it it
[34:02] was very good and the word actually
[34:04] there where it says very that word in
[34:06] hebrew is
[34:07] feminine in other words it's very
[34:10] passionately good it's not just a little
[34:12] bit good
[34:14] it's passionately good
[34:17] and so i thought about as i was looking
[34:18] at this and thinking about it
[34:20] and how that
[34:23] we've read the church age book we've got
[34:25] the seven seals book we've heard the
[34:27] messages and those things and how that
[34:30] god slips things in sometimes
[34:33] so beautiful
[34:35] and so
[34:36] correct
[34:37] and if we read through the you're going
[34:40] through the church age book and you're
[34:41] coming up
[34:42] into it and you're looking at that sixth
[34:45] church age
[34:47] and we know that that's the i believe
[34:49] it's what philadelphia
[34:51] and it's the uh
[34:52] you know
[34:53] men being nice to each other and uh
[34:57] how that that philadelphia age brotherly
[34:59] love i think it is their brotherly
[35:01] kindness however it reads and that it
[35:03] was in that sixth age
[35:06] that it comes all the way up through
[35:08] brotherly kindness
[35:10] and that
[35:12] during that sixth age
[35:15] there was something
[35:17] very good
[35:19] and that very
[35:21] good notice it doesn't say that there
[35:23] was a day
[35:24] and a night
[35:26] it says that there was an evening
[35:29] and a morning
[35:30] at the sixth day
[35:33] why doesn't it say day at night
[35:36] it gives you the start of the day the
[35:38] morning
[35:40] it gives you the close of the day
[35:42] the evening and it comes in the
[35:44] sixth day
[35:46] and god said it's really good
[35:48] ah
[35:50] vehemently good
[35:52] and he sees it
[35:54] and he says behold it
[35:56] behold look at it look at it and see
[36:00] the evening
[36:01] and the morning
[36:03] of the sixth day
[36:05] it's at the end of the sixth church age
[36:07] as we know it
[36:09] that we start into the seventh church
[36:11] age which we all know
[36:12] the time in the day that we're living is
[36:15] laodicea or lady you see us he used the
[36:17] word sometimes
[36:19] and how that
[36:21] it's the age of people's rights
[36:25] brother adam used to say you know we all
[36:27] have our rights and we all want our
[36:29] right for this and our right for that
[36:31] but he said what about god's rights
[36:35] so at this
[36:36] end of this sixth age there's an evening
[36:38] and a morning
[36:41] and
[36:42] well think about the scripture evening
[36:45] just a moment
[36:46] and think about where it came about
[36:49] it starts about at the end
[36:52] of the sixth day
[36:54] because in the evening time
[36:56] there shall be light
[36:59] so in this sixth day
[37:01] in the evening
[37:03] the light begins to come forth
[37:06] and as that light begins to come forth
[37:09] it says there's an evening and a morning
[37:13] of the sixth day well if we continue to
[37:14] read actually the first verse of the the
[37:17] second chapter says the
[37:19] thus of the heavens and the earth were
[37:21] finished and all the host of them
[37:24] so that's not talking about the seventh
[37:26] day
[37:27] yet that first scripture in the next
[37:30] chapter is actually still talking about
[37:34] this same scripture
[37:37] it's talking about the heavens and the
[37:38] earth being finished
[37:41] and all of the host of them
[37:45] so the finishing touches
[37:49] on this all comes as we're going into
[37:51] the seventh age which is the day of
[37:55] rest as you begin to read it
[37:57] says the seventh
[37:58] day god ended his work and he rested on
[38:01] the seventh day
[38:03] of everything that he had made
[38:08] and we see
[38:09] an elijah ministry in that previous
[38:12] verse an evening there was an evening
[38:15] time
[38:17] going into a laodicean church
[38:20] a time of people's rights
[38:24] but so likewise did does god have rights
[38:28] and in that
[38:30] in those rights
[38:32] he has purchased
[38:35] as it were the bride of jesus christ and
[38:38] it said this
[38:40] if i can call it a time period that he's
[38:42] taking the bride of jesus christ
[38:45] into the rest
[38:47] into a rest not like we go to bed at
[38:50] night and whether you have a good night
[38:52] bad night whatever it is
[38:54] you wake up sometimes you're still tired
[38:56] i've never have you figured that out
[38:58] brother paul i just
[39:00] wow what happened i thought i slept
[39:02] pretty good but no it's not that kind of
[39:04] rest it's an entire
[39:07] it's over
[39:10] the things of this day
[39:13] and this world
[39:14] and this time
[39:16] and all of the sin
[39:18] and the destruction and the evil and the
[39:22] hatred
[39:23] it's all over
[39:26] he is taking the bride of jesus christ
[39:30] by an evening time
[39:32] message he makes an announcement have
[39:34] you ever heard the message it's the
[39:36] rising of the sun
[39:41] the rising of the sun what's he talk
[39:43] about
[39:45] in that message well he talks about
[39:47] resurrection
[39:49] he talks about resurrection day it's an
[39:51] easter message
[39:53] and he talks about the resurrection and
[39:54] the resurrection day and all the things
[39:56] that are accompanying that and even
[39:58] talks about the little uh the little
[40:00] robin
[40:02] and how that that robin when he refers
[40:04] back to jesus christ and when he was on
[40:07] calvary calvary and how that little
[40:09] robin was a little brown bird and when
[40:11] it tried to pull the nails out it got
[40:13] its breast red
[40:16] from the blood of jesus christ
[40:18] then he tells us it's the rising
[40:22] of the sun
[40:23] it's the resurrection
[40:26] day
[40:28] it's the time
[40:30] that we are moving into
[40:32] the rest
[40:33] of the as here it says the seventh day
[40:35] he rested
[40:36] or the
[40:41] but if we read it
[40:44] like i said
[40:46] the way the hebrews read it
[40:48] it comes across slightly different so
[40:49] how did we get there and
[40:53] we know that every word of god brother
[40:55] branham said has compound meaning
[40:57] compound revelation
[41:00] and how that if with compound
[41:03] revelation just to explain it a little
[41:06] bit
[41:07] we're three-part
[41:09] people
[41:10] i have an outside body and you know you
[41:13] bang your knuckles and it hurts and you
[41:14] get if you're working on trucks you get
[41:16] your fingernails all dirty and
[41:19] you know all those things that we deal
[41:21] with with this fleshly realm the sea
[41:23] taste here feel smell
[41:25] and
[41:27] we deal with those things and there's
[41:29] that level and there's scripture that
[41:31] deals
[41:32] specifically with the works of the flesh
[41:37] but behind the flesh there's a spirit
[41:40] within us that moves this man to do what
[41:42] he does that moves you to do what it
[41:44] does
[41:45] there's a spirit in you that does that
[41:47] and there are certain scriptures that
[41:49] speak specifically
[41:52] to the spirit
[41:54] of man
[41:56] and to the spirit that dwells inside of
[41:58] us i always think of that song creating
[42:00] me a clean heart and renew a right
[42:03] spirit
[42:05] a spirit that's correct that's upright
[42:08] before god
[42:10] and so we know that there's certain
[42:11] things that as we read it we can read it
[42:13] one way one time and it might apply to
[42:16] well
[42:17] what are you doing man
[42:19] what are you letting that flesh run you
[42:20] around for
[42:22] and the next time it's like wow
[42:24] why did i get so angry about that it
[42:26] wasn't my flesh that got angry
[42:28] it was the spirit that was in me for
[42:30] whatever reason
[42:32] it might be
[42:34] just anger
[42:36] brother branham said you know if you got
[42:37] that bus buzzsaw
[42:39] uh kind of temper you need to pray
[42:42] to get rid of it
[42:44] so that
[42:45] it applies to that and he said but
[42:48] and so but sometimes there's also
[42:50] righteous indignation
[42:52] wherein even god said he hated not the
[42:55] nicolaitans
[42:57] but he hates the deeds
[42:59] that they do
[43:01] he hates what they're doing
[43:04] because they separate the congregation
[43:09] from jesus christ
[43:11] it's a love affair with jesus christ
[43:14] every single one of us must know jesus
[43:17] christ personally
[43:20] he said you you must be born again
[43:24] but he said how can and he said how can
[43:25] i go back to the womb and
[43:28] he said
[43:29] the scribe of israel or you know a
[43:31] master of israel and you don't know the
[43:32] answer to that question
[43:35] and you can refer back to the book of
[43:37] ezekiel he talks about it
[43:39] so there's that but then there's
[43:41] yet another
[43:43] realm
[43:45] and the further i go the more
[43:48] i want
[43:50] and i long to break into that we call it
[43:53] the soul realm or the soul that's the
[43:56] other part brother branham said the soul
[43:58] is the nature
[44:00] of the spirit
[44:02] in other words
[44:04] whatever is in the soul or the desire
[44:08] is what's going to move the spirit to do
[44:10] the things that it does
[44:13] and so if the nature
[44:16] you know brother branham talked about oh
[44:17] and you know paul being a farmer he can
[44:19] tell you if it's a cockle brewer it's
[44:21] going to bring you a cuckle burr
[44:23] and if it's a wheat it's going to bring
[44:25] wheat or
[44:26] sugar beet's going to be a sugar beet
[44:27] it's not going to be a pineapple
[44:30] because that's the nature that's in the
[44:32] seed
[44:33] well the nature that's in the seed
[44:37] the seed for us is jesus christ
[44:41] and he is called the word of god in fact
[44:43] i think it's in i want to say it's in
[44:45] john in the parable jesus said my word
[44:48] is a seed
[44:50] and that seed has a particular
[44:53] nature
[44:55] and when that seed was planted in the
[44:57] days of paul it had
[45:00] the apostle paul it had a certain nature
[45:04] about it
[45:06] and he even gives us the explanation
[45:09] again from ezekiel who's called the son
[45:11] of man by the way hey son of man
[45:14] talks about him several times so we know
[45:16] that again refers to this age
[45:18] the book of ezekiel
[45:20] ezekiel
[45:22] was
[45:23] yeah he was a you could say a prophet to
[45:25] israel but he was also a prophet to the
[45:27] gentiles because he was by the river
[45:29] chiba
[45:30] in babylon
[45:32] but he had a specific prophecy
[45:36] when he saw
[45:37] the pillar of fire when he saw god come
[45:41] down in that prophetic
[45:44] portion
[45:46] he said well there was four faces
[45:49] or you could say natures or
[45:51] personalities
[45:53] to that
[45:54] spirit of god
[45:56] he said there's
[45:58] a man an ox
[46:01] a lion
[46:02] and an eagle
[46:05] well
[46:06] that seed that went down in the days of
[46:08] the apostle paul and the other apostles
[46:10] that first church
[46:11] we find out from the message the hour it
[46:13] was the spirit of the lion or it was the
[46:15] nature
[46:16] of the lion
[46:18] it wouldn't it would not be denied they
[46:21] didn't care what happened they didn't
[46:22] care what was going to happen to them or
[46:24] anything and they sold everything they
[46:26] got all everything together and they
[46:28] just you know and when the persecution
[46:30] came
[46:31] there's some people say well they did
[46:32] the wrong thing and selling their houses
[46:34] brother random said no they did the
[46:35] right thing
[46:37] because they had nowhere to go and they
[46:39] would have to go out and pre into all
[46:42] the world and preach the gospel
[46:45] and it was the spirit of the lion the
[46:48] fierceness
[46:49] of how the you know god
[46:51] and even that group that came uh are the
[46:54] two people that came and they sold the
[46:56] property and and how that spirit of a
[46:58] lion
[46:58] and they lied about it and when they
[47:00] lied to the holy ghost peter with the
[47:03] spirit of the lion said what are you
[47:04] doing
[47:06] and they died right on the spot
[47:10] by how by the word of god
[47:13] it was the spirit of the
[47:15] lion
[47:17] on those
[47:18] people well we know as time went on that
[47:21] personality or that soul began to change
[47:24] and as the persecution
[47:26] intensified
[47:29] it didn't change the
[47:32] the the holy spirit
[47:34] but the nature of how the spirit
[47:36] affected those going into that next age
[47:40] was just lay your life down
[47:43] just lay it down
[47:45] don't fight
[47:46] don't
[47:47] struggle with it
[47:49] don't even you know try to rebuke it
[47:52] just and i think i want to say it was
[47:53] poly carp and i could be wrong but it's
[47:56] one of those
[47:57] men and when they cast him into the
[47:59] lions you know they say he just tore his
[48:02] shirt open and said oh beasts of the
[48:04] field come run these bones
[48:07] wow
[48:08] what a nature
[48:11] i don't know if i could do that
[48:13] you know i might be headed
[48:16] up through the stands or something
[48:18] because that's not my nature
[48:21] we have a different nature
[48:24] we have a different
[48:26] personality type
[48:28] in this day and age
[48:31] well we know from there it moved on to
[48:33] and if you read closely in the fox's
[48:35] book of martyrs
[48:37] it's talking about all those people that
[48:39] laid down their lives and laid down
[48:40] their lives and there's one certain
[48:42] place you can all of a sudden see the
[48:44] beginning of the
[48:46] change for the church of god
[48:50] how that that personality that soul that
[48:53] nature began to change because it says
[48:56] that the you know the pope sent out his
[48:58] armies and such
[49:00] to wipe out this one village forgot what
[49:02] country it was in and they're going up
[49:04] the mountain they're all going to kill
[49:05] them they're probably just expecting
[49:06] well these guys are all just going to
[49:07] lay down and die right
[49:10] and one guy
[49:12] i don't think it even gives his name in
[49:13] the book
[49:15] one guy is looking at this going
[49:18] and he turns to the other guys
[49:20] we don't have to put up with this
[49:26] what's he thinking
[49:28] the spirit the nature is changing
[49:32] and it says they threw so many rocks at
[49:34] them they actually drove an army away
[49:38] from their village
[49:41] because the nature had changed
[49:43] we're not going to put up with this
[49:45] we're not going to just lay it down
[49:47] we've got brains enough to know we don't
[49:49] have to put up with you anymore
[49:52] we know and how that moved through the
[49:54] and it went into their church age
[49:55] messenger martin luther then how did
[49:58] that that spirit of the man
[50:01] that god's thought of man and how that
[50:03] it uh permeated through that those
[50:06] church ages the next coming up through
[50:08] there
[50:09] and how that it went on into
[50:12] that sixth church age
[50:17] it went on into the sixth
[50:19] church age
[50:22] and when it went into the sixth church
[50:24] age
[50:26] god said it's good
[50:28] and at the
[50:29] end of that time
[50:30] there's a morning and there's an evening
[50:33] and we have a prophetic message and if i
[50:36] was to break down some of the
[50:38] meanings there from the hebrew
[50:40] dictionary
[50:42] there's
[50:43] things that are in there like it it says
[50:45] that uh straight
[50:47] it mentions straight and where it says
[50:49] evening it's not just like the setting
[50:51] of the sun
[50:53] i believe evening
[50:54] if i remember rightly and the hebrew has
[50:56] about seven different meanings
[50:59] it's like
[51:02] john the baptist said every mountain
[51:03] will be brought low
[51:05] and every valley will be brought up
[51:08] they will be made even
[51:12] and the prophet isaiah speaking of an
[51:14] elijah ministry said
[51:16] there's going to run upon plumb line
[51:19] that everything be made even
[51:24] you see the word of god was coming forth
[51:27] coming
[51:28] forth
[51:30] and there's a soul realm
[51:33] that
[51:35] we enter into
[51:36] when we come into the presence of jesus
[51:39] christ
[51:40] and we have a word that we are to
[51:43] fulfill
[51:44] in our day
[51:46] in our lives
[51:49] and in our time frame
[51:51] and that word is the words or the the
[51:54] nature of the eagle
[51:58] prophet gave us some hints to what that
[52:01] nature would be about
[52:03] talked about the eagle that was in the
[52:04] barnyard with the chickens and
[52:07] he didn't like that food he was eating
[52:09] what's the matter and all the other
[52:11] chickens they kind of probably left you
[52:13] know he's a little strange looking
[52:16] he don't look like us and he sure don't
[52:18] like our food and we're really having a
[52:19] good time with it
[52:21] and
[52:22] the eagle is like what
[52:24] i don't know what he was looking for
[52:26] maybe he'd find a little bit of meat in
[52:27] a worm or something but
[52:30] we don't really know but he didn't like
[52:32] that food but when he heard a specific
[52:35] voice
[52:37] brother branham said
[52:39] he looked up
[52:42] he said what's that voice
[52:46] voice sounds familiar to me
[52:51] that voice is the same voice
[52:55] that's in me
[53:00] because he could make the c he answered
[53:02] it
[53:03] same voice
[53:05] and when mama eagle heard that voice
[53:09] she just said jump
[53:11] just
[53:12] jump and when he jumped he was able to
[53:15] make it under the i believe brother
[53:17] branham said the fence post he got to a
[53:20] certain level
[53:22] don't stay on the fence post people
[53:25] because the next time it said just jump
[53:28] again
[53:30] and this time she said spread your wings
[53:34] brother branham's wings
[53:37] are the wings
[53:39] of the old and new
[53:40] testament spread your wings
[53:46] in the very winds another place when he
[53:49] was talking about the one that had been
[53:50] blown down and he was in the thicket
[53:53] brother venomous
[53:54] spoke to him and said you know i could
[53:56] shoot you
[53:58] and he said before he could even get his
[54:00] gun up he said that eagle jumped once
[54:03] set its wings in the very wind or storm
[54:05] that had driven it down took him up
[54:08] he said i couldn't even got a shot off
[54:13] it's a different nature
[54:15] we have the ability to fly
[54:19] when we realize we've heard an evening
[54:22] message
[54:23] and it's to set our lives even

[54:35] wings open

[54:58] the drive-in you know where you get the
[55:01] the ice cream or whatever everywhere we
[55:03] go what they got the rock and roll music
[55:04] just
[55:08] and it's not just the music
[55:11] it's the words
[55:13] when i find myself in times of trouble
[55:16] mother mary comes to me
[55:19] false doctrine
[55:21] you are being indoctrinated
[55:25] by the things of the world
[55:26] a false
[55:28] doctrine
[55:30] and you're here to almost you know you
[55:32] might not hear that same song every day
[55:34] but you hear something else
[55:36] or you hear the
[55:39] oh
[55:40] i just love them so much man
[55:43] woman worship
[55:45] you ever read from isaiah i want to say
[55:47] it 61 where it says your your children
[55:49] will run you
[55:51] and the women let me let me let's just
[55:54] read that
[55:55] i know i spoke on
[55:58] not too long ago
[56:04] isaiah third chapter i don't know are
[56:06] you interpreting brother where'd he go
[56:09] isaiah third chapter we'll just take
[56:11] this real quick
[56:12] to let you know what you're being
[56:14] indoctrinated with it's isaiah the third
[56:16] chapter and it's 12 verses 12 and 13.
[56:24] verse 11 talks about the reward of the
[56:26] wicked
[56:27] and uh
[56:29] verse 12 as for my people children are
[56:32] their oppressors and women rule over
[56:34] them oh my people they which lead thee
[56:37] cause thee to air and destroy the way of
[56:39] thy paths
[56:40] the lord standeth up to plead and he
[56:42] stands to judge the people
[56:46] now wait a minute children
[56:49] are their oppressors
[56:53] i know some people that
[56:56] a woman in particular that kind of comes
[56:58] to mind
[56:59] they wanted to take her kids away from
[57:01] her because one of the kids complained
[57:04] that she wouldn't let him do a certain
[57:06] thing
[57:08] she had to go through all kinds of
[57:10] crazy stuff
[57:12] to keep her kids
[57:14] the child had become the oppressor
[57:19] in that particular situation but it goes
[57:21] beyond that because now we're looking at
[57:23] again we one of those levels we're
[57:25] looking at that top level
[57:27] actually in the flesh
[57:29] and it says that you know children
[57:31] become their oppression oppressors
[57:34] and women rule over them
[57:37] so their children
[57:38] okay there is a natural realm to that
[57:41] and they even you know you say the your
[57:43] kid says the wrong thing at school you
[57:44] might get a you know knock on the door
[57:47] from child protective services
[57:50] because the children
[57:52] are trying they're oppressing
[57:54] and they're they're oppressing because
[57:56] of well because of the music because of
[57:59] the
[58:00] the televisions because of the styles
[58:02] because of all things that's going on
[58:04] but it even goes beyond that because
[58:06] there's another set of children
[58:09] that are the oppressors
[58:12] those those that are involved in satan's
[58:15] trinity
[58:16] money
[58:18] religion
[58:20] money religion and banking
[58:22] and they will oppress you
[58:25] brother
[58:26] they're in louisiana
[58:29] uh brother jeremy he works for a bank we
[58:32] were talking a little bit one night he
[58:34] said
[58:34] brother that's all he didn't say don't
[58:37] try but he said you know it's it's
[58:39] it's set up to where the bank always
[58:41] wins
[58:43] so if you don't win don't feel bad
[58:46] because that's the way it's set up and
[58:48] that's the children the bible talks
[58:49] about the children of the world being
[58:51] smarter
[58:52] than the children of the kingdom
[58:55] and the children become the oppressors
[58:57] and women rule over them well
[59:00] it's not we can see it obviously in the
[59:03] natural realm
[59:05] the women's rights movement and all of
[59:07] those things that go with that we even
[59:08] have a female vice president now or
[59:11] so-called
[59:13] and
[59:15] so they say well
[59:18] women rule
[59:20] but it goes beyond that because the
[59:22] woman also types
[59:24] a church system
[59:27] and that church system is seeking to
[59:29] rule over you
[59:32] doctrinally
[59:36] doctrinally spiritually
[59:39] uh as the sister came in and i love that
[59:41] song give thanks with a grateful heart
[59:44] love that song happened to run into it
[59:47] you know i was looking for some
[59:48] nice music on youtube oh
[59:51] there's that song i love it and you get
[59:53] to
[59:54] a little part in it when it's either
[59:55] this
[59:56] getting ready to finish or start or
[59:58] whatever it is and they were using that
[1:00:00] song
[1:00:01] to celebrate
[1:00:04] the
[1:00:04] visitation of the pope
[1:00:08] a beautiful christian song
[1:00:12] and they're trying to rule over it by a
[1:00:14] church system
[1:00:17] and he says oh my people they cause thee
[1:00:20] to air and to destroy the way of thy
[1:00:23] paths what's our way
[1:00:25] it's supposed to be the ways of god what
[1:00:28] angered god at the days of moses
[1:00:31] he said i'm they'll never enter into my
[1:00:33] rest he said because they never
[1:00:35] understood my ways
[1:00:38] our way is the pathway
[1:00:41] of god
[1:00:42] praise the lord
[1:00:44] are you okay are we i don't have a clue
[1:00:46] and i guess we're okay we're
[1:00:49] 20 something minutes
[1:00:52] and i'm not here to
[1:00:54] eat up your time
[1:00:56] but uh
[1:00:58] i also wanted to mention one other thing
[1:01:01] when the brother spoke i really enjoyed
[1:01:03] the service last week with brother chris
[1:01:06] and and i've enjoyed brother
[1:01:08] paul with the last couple he's done nice
[1:01:11] to be here
[1:01:12] but he's the the the word destiny
[1:01:15] and so if you see me sometimes in church
[1:01:17] and i'm playing with my cell phone
[1:01:20] i'm really not texting my kids
[1:01:24] i'll be i was so intrigued by the word
[1:01:26] that he used i mean is that in the bible
[1:01:29] so i'm searching the bible
[1:01:31] it's not in there
[1:01:32] the word destiny isn't there but the
[1:01:35] root
[1:01:36] of that word is did you know that
[1:01:39] in the word pre-destination
[1:01:44] in other words in the mind of god
[1:01:48] he knew what your journey would be
[1:01:50] to bring you to an expected end
[1:01:54] that's what predestination or your
[1:01:56] destiny my destiny is
[1:01:59] and in the book of jeremiah it says i
[1:02:02] know my thoughts towards you
[1:02:05] there are thoughts of peace
[1:02:07] he knows what your journey will be
[1:02:10] he knows what you're going to need for
[1:02:12] the journey and he already gave it to us
[1:02:14] already provided wonderful song
[1:02:17] and how that
[1:02:19] he knows
[1:02:20] our steps he knows the path that we'll
[1:02:23] take
[1:02:25] and even though when it we hear that uh
[1:02:27] poem i think his foot footsteps on the
[1:02:30] sand who time and it said lord there's
[1:02:32] those places where there's only one set
[1:02:34] of footsteps why did you leave me
[1:02:36] he said i didn't leave you
[1:02:39] i was carrying you
[1:02:44] he said lo i am with you always
[1:02:47] even unto the end praise the lord are
[1:02:50] you okay
[1:02:52] let's turn then
[1:02:55] back okay we read 31 and how that verse
[1:02:58] 31 of genesis 1 and we realized that
[1:03:02] there's overlapping in these things
[1:03:03] brother branham said all those ages all
[1:03:05] that stuff overlap
[1:03:08] and the the the real rest
[1:03:10] is the what we would say the eighth day
[1:03:13] that's eternity that's a different
[1:03:16] probably that brother paul preached that
[1:03:17] one for you
[1:03:18] or brother chris or brother david
[1:03:21] but
[1:03:23] when we go back let's see how we get to
[1:03:26] where
[1:03:28] we can i'd like to think understand
[1:03:31] better
[1:03:32] this predestination
[1:03:35] or this walk and where it came from we
[1:03:37] know brother branham said in another
[1:03:39] place every scripture
[1:03:41] and i love this
[1:03:44] every scripture somehow
[1:03:46] points us to jesus christ
[1:03:48] and if we don't see jesus christ in it
[1:03:51] he said he better go back and read it
[1:03:52] again because he's there
[1:03:54] so let's look at genesis one maybe just
[1:03:57] take a few more minutes
[1:03:59] really
[1:04:00] he said in there and again in the
[1:04:02] beginning god created the heaven and the
[1:04:04] earth that's how it starts genesis 1 1.
[1:04:08] well it says in the word
[1:04:10] god in that sense there
[1:04:12] is elohim
[1:04:14] and the definition it gives for elohim
[1:04:16] is the judge the rule the divine one the
[1:04:19] angel
[1:04:20] god almighty
[1:04:22] strength power jehovah the one god
[1:04:26] so just in that one word we see a lot
[1:04:29] but and then the root words to that word
[1:04:32] god
[1:04:34] it comes from a hebrew number 352 which
[1:04:37] means the ram
[1:04:41] for food for sacrifice
[1:04:44] red dyed skin for the tabernacle
[1:04:49] the pillar the door post
[1:04:51] the jams the ballista plaster
[1:04:54] the mighty tree
[1:04:56] and it also has within that word
[1:05:00] if i can say this right prominence
[1:05:03] of the body the belly
[1:05:05] wealthy men
[1:05:06] and the origin is to twist and be strong
[1:05:10] or rolled together
[1:05:12] in power body
[1:05:14] and mighty strength
[1:05:16] all
[1:05:17] in that one word
[1:05:19] so we say yellow him and we know another
[1:05:21] and if again if you run it out it
[1:05:23] actually also means the self-existent
[1:05:25] one
[1:05:26] and how that in there is the ram
[1:05:30] and the pillars that hold up the door
[1:05:33] posts jesus said i am the door to the
[1:05:36] sheepfold
[1:05:37] and he's the pillars that hold it up
[1:05:40] he's the pillars he's and it says in the
[1:05:43] beginning god
[1:05:45] created the heaven and the earth again
[1:05:47] now the hebrew the heaven and the earth
[1:05:49] were
[1:05:50] in the beginning created by god
[1:05:53] or
[1:05:54] in
[1:05:55] god the beginning
[1:05:58] created he the heavens and the earth
[1:06:01] did i change
[1:06:02] anything only
[1:06:05] the direction of how we look at it
[1:06:08] can i come
[1:06:09] in
[1:06:10] brother adam said we can do this so i'm
[1:06:12] not
[1:06:13] fooling with you okay
[1:06:15] in
[1:06:16] god
[1:06:17] the
[1:06:18] beginning
[1:06:19] created the heaven and the earth
[1:06:23] in
[1:06:25] elohim
[1:06:26] the self-existent one
[1:06:29] in god the beginning
[1:06:32] so every scripture has to point us to
[1:06:35] jesus christ so inside of god we just
[1:06:38] read one of the definitions is the ram
[1:06:42] the ram so in
[1:06:45] god the ram
[1:06:48] in god the ra the ram
[1:06:52] who is the the beginning
[1:06:55] who's the beginning
[1:06:57] what's the revelation we have about the
[1:07:00] beginning
[1:07:01] you ever read revelations once you have
[1:07:03] one chapter 1 verse 8
[1:07:07] i am alpha and omega the beginning
[1:07:13] and the ending
[1:07:15] so in god
[1:07:17] the beginning that's jesus christ
[1:07:21] in god was jesus christ the bible said
[1:07:24] he was
[1:07:25] in god before he was slain before the
[1:07:28] foundation of the world
[1:07:30] that's scripture
[1:07:33] so in god jesus christ the beginning was
[1:07:36] slain
[1:07:37] before the foundation of the world
[1:07:40] and he created the heaven and the earth
[1:07:44] well there's the heaven there's all the
[1:07:45] heavenly bodies
[1:07:47] but there's more remember there's
[1:07:48] different levels we're looking at here
[1:07:51] he created the heavens
[1:07:54] and if you go on to read through genesis
[1:07:56] there it talks about the stars and the
[1:07:58] planets and all that stuff that's part
[1:08:00] of the heavenly bodies the natural
[1:08:03] heavenly bodies
[1:08:06] you know the bible says that all things
[1:08:07] were created by jesus christ
[1:08:11] because he was in god
[1:08:13] he's the nature of god flowing out
[1:08:17] to a world that became fallen
[1:08:20] and so
[1:08:22] in the heavens those things that he
[1:08:24] created or that he formed it says is one
[1:08:27] of the
[1:08:28] the definitions
[1:08:30] that he formed that he made that he took
[1:08:33] time brother branham uses the word
[1:08:34] brooded over
[1:08:38] brooded over
[1:08:40] what are we talking about when the
[1:08:41] chicken's brewed what happens they lay
[1:08:43] the eggs
[1:08:44] and the male comes
[1:08:47] to make sure the eggs are gonna hatch
[1:08:50] and he brooded
[1:08:53] over the heavens
[1:08:55] and the earth and what do we see
[1:08:57] well in the heavens
[1:09:00] there's a birth sign up there
[1:09:02] they call virgo
[1:09:04] stands for the virgin
[1:09:06] brother branham said that represents the
[1:09:08] virgin birth
[1:09:11] there's another birth sign over there
[1:09:12] that represents cancer
[1:09:14] he said that's part of the age that
[1:09:16] we're living in and that's why there's
[1:09:18] so much cancer in this age
[1:09:21] there's another one over there called
[1:09:22] leo the lion
[1:09:25] he said it's the lion
[1:09:26] of the tribe of judah
[1:09:29] brother branham said he wrote a bible in
[1:09:32] the sky
[1:09:34] so this
[1:09:35] in god the beginning
[1:09:37] when he created when he formed it when
[1:09:39] he brooded and put his seed into it
[1:09:43] and he made the heaven
[1:09:45] what is it it's a bible
[1:09:48] it's a bible in the sky every word every
[1:09:51] star represents something
[1:09:55] we know about how he talked about the
[1:09:56] north star and how the whole universe
[1:10:00] for us on this planet revolve
[1:10:03] around that star
[1:10:05] he said that's jesus christ
[1:10:08] and he wrote it in the heavens
[1:10:10] and he wrote it in the earth
[1:10:14] we see the trees they come from forth
[1:10:17] from a seed they have a certain life
[1:10:19] that's in the seed
[1:10:21] and the life that's in the seed if it's
[1:10:23] a pear tree it's
[1:10:25] not going to make pineapples or
[1:10:26] something
[1:10:28] else because the seed of god is in it
[1:10:32] and every seed brings forth of its own
[1:10:35] kind
[1:10:36] and how that it it grows from a little
[1:10:39] from a seed that has to die
[1:10:42] so it's type in jesus christ
[1:10:44] and then it resurrects
[1:10:46] and it comes up makes the the whatever
[1:10:48] tree that it is to make
[1:10:51] and in the the winter times we know the
[1:10:53] times and the seasons talks about in
[1:10:55] ecclesiastes and how the the life goes
[1:10:58] out of the tree
[1:11:00] and the life that goes out of the tree
[1:11:03] that falls on the ground
[1:11:06] through the leaves the needles whatever
[1:11:07] it is the fruit
[1:11:09] what is it it goes back into the soil
[1:11:13] and in the book of job it says at the
[1:11:15] smell of water
[1:11:16] it comes again
[1:11:19] and when the sun comes to a certain
[1:11:21] place
[1:11:22] when the angle of the light or the
[1:11:24] duration of the day whatever it is the
[1:11:26] scientists there's different schools on
[1:11:28] that
[1:11:29] but when it strikes
[1:11:31] just the right thing
[1:11:33] the life comes back into it
[1:11:36] what do we see in the earth in the
[1:11:38] nature of the earth
[1:11:40] the life death burial and resurrection
[1:11:43] of jesus christ every morning
[1:11:45] when you get up if that sun's coming up
[1:11:48] which way is east brother is it this way
[1:11:51] i thought okay to the east when that sun
[1:11:54] comes up
[1:11:55] then it goes through the sky through the
[1:11:57] sky today bad day for the air
[1:11:59] conditioner to go out 104 right
[1:12:02] but
[1:12:03] when it's set tonight
[1:12:06] and don't worry it'll be back tomorrow
[1:12:09] because again in the earth is the seed
[1:12:13] of the birth
[1:12:14] life
[1:12:15] death
[1:12:16] burial and resurrection
[1:12:19] of jesus christ
[1:12:22] okay where have we had time ways
[1:12:25] ten more minutes i hope that's all right
[1:12:27] i'd like to get you out of here by nine
[1:12:29] or maybe a few minutes before
[1:12:33] so we see
[1:12:34] that creation we see jesus christ
[1:12:39] in we see him as the beginning
[1:12:42] and the creator bible says in another
[1:12:45] place all things were created by him for
[1:12:48] him without him there was nothing made
[1:12:50] that was made
[1:12:52] he did it all
[1:12:56] in the spiritual or in the soul
[1:13:00] realm
[1:13:01] the manifestation
[1:13:04] of jesus christ brother branham said we
[1:13:06] got locked i don't see a
[1:13:08] accord here
[1:13:09] but he said we got locked in a loop of
[1:13:11] time
[1:13:13] and how that when adam fell
[1:13:16] he threw the whole human race into a
[1:13:19] loop
[1:13:20] of time
[1:13:21] and on that loop there's you know if i
[1:13:23] was he had a
[1:13:25] you know a cord i don't want to take
[1:13:27] anything apart there but uh you know if
[1:13:30] it was i was holding up a loop for you
[1:13:32] there was you know here was an abraham
[1:13:34] and a sarah and a
[1:13:36] and you start going down that loop of
[1:13:38] time and pretty soon you come across a
[1:13:39] david
[1:13:40] and a solomon and
[1:13:42] this king and that king and you go
[1:13:44] around that loop well eventually it
[1:13:46] comes around and it goes into a gentile
[1:13:48] dispensation and all those things in
[1:13:50] that loop of time
[1:13:52] and how that
[1:13:54] in that loop of time
[1:13:57] god is
[1:13:58] manifesting still
[1:14:00] jesus christ
[1:14:02] we see jesus christ in abraham we see
[1:14:05] jesus christ in
[1:14:07] david we see jesus christ in moses we
[1:14:10] see jesus christ in
[1:14:12] job
[1:14:14] and we could go on and on
[1:14:17] all night long even the scripture and i
[1:14:19] think it's
[1:14:20] hebrews chapter 11 says what if i had
[1:14:22] time to speak about this one and this
[1:14:24] one and this one and this one and this
[1:14:25] one
[1:14:26] because they were all manifesting
[1:14:29] jesus christ and so will you and i
[1:14:33] by the seed
[1:14:35] and the nature
[1:14:36] that we have been given
[1:14:39] the nature of the eagle
[1:14:42] the first
[1:14:44] group that
[1:14:45] got the holy ghost
[1:14:48] was the lion
[1:14:50] what's so special about the lion
[1:14:52] well he's the king of the beasts
[1:14:55] he is the king
[1:14:56] of the beasts
[1:14:58] on terra firma
[1:15:00] and between the king of the
[1:15:02] beasts of the terra firma
[1:15:04] you had
[1:15:07] the ox the sacrificial beast and you had
[1:15:10] the man
[1:15:11] and when it gets to the eagle
[1:15:14] why is the eagle
[1:15:16] so important
[1:15:21] because the eagle
[1:15:23] is the king of the air
[1:15:26] i remember coming across i think it was
[1:15:28] we'll be headed back to panama here lord
[1:15:30] willing at the
[1:15:31] end of september
[1:15:33] and uh i remember i think it was coming
[1:15:35] back from panama we're coming across the
[1:15:38] you know on the airplane you know the
[1:15:39] guru you know the engines are going a
[1:15:40] certain way and they come on there and
[1:15:42] they say okay we're just getting ready
[1:15:43] to descend and the engines cut back and
[1:15:46] i think they said we were
[1:15:48] i don't know i think they said thirty
[1:15:49] four thousand feet and we're going to
[1:15:51] start descent now
[1:15:53] and i happen to look out the window
[1:15:57] and above us was more clouds big thunder
[1:15:59] clouds they'll go way way up there
[1:16:01] they'll go
[1:16:02] 45 000 feet or so
[1:16:05] and i looked up
[1:16:07] and above that jet
[1:16:10] just dancing through the clouds was a
[1:16:13] great big bald eagle
[1:16:16] i thought he's got to be
[1:16:19] 36 38 000 feet
[1:16:22] and just like he's having fun
[1:16:25] the eagle is the king of the air
[1:16:29] friends where are we supposed to meet
[1:16:30] him
[1:16:34] and how are we going to meet him
[1:16:39] on the wings
[1:16:42] of the old and new testament
[1:16:45] seeing that jesus christ is in every
[1:16:47] word
[1:16:48] every scripture
[1:16:50] every nature
[1:16:54] that was imparted to jesus christ is
[1:16:56] imparted unto us by the seed that
[1:16:58] dwelleth in us
[1:17:00] read 1st john
[1:17:03] the seed that dwelleth in us
[1:17:06] praise the lord
[1:17:07] well
[1:17:10] quickly let's turn to
[1:17:12] genesis chapter 26. i'll see if i can
[1:17:15] get through this
[1:17:17] fast
[1:17:19] because it'll help you to learn help us
[1:17:21] to learn how me to learn
[1:17:23] who we really are
[1:17:27] in
[1:17:29] or verse
[1:17:29] actually genesis 2 and 26
[1:17:33] i said one i meant two
[1:17:36] so in genesis the second chapter
[1:17:41] now we've seen you know all the things
[1:17:43] that he made and then he prophesies of
[1:17:45] the
[1:17:46] of the seventh day of rest
[1:17:48] and being sanctified and such
[1:17:51] and in the seventh verse
[1:17:55] whoops i am wrong i'm sorry it's the
[1:17:58] first chapter i wanted to go to first
[1:18:01] and it's 20 but it's still it's verse 26
[1:18:04] that's what it is genesis 1 verse 26 and
[1:18:07] god said so god is speaking something
[1:18:10] when god speaks it's the word of god so
[1:18:13] god says let us make man in our image
[1:18:16] the trinitarians love that because this
[1:18:18] is a plural word
[1:18:21] oh
[1:18:22] see it's three gods no it's not three
[1:18:24] gods
[1:18:25] get that out of your mind no
[1:18:27] after our likeness
[1:18:30] he said let us make man
[1:18:33] in our image and the word man there
[1:18:36] is human being
[1:18:37] mankind
[1:18:39] or ruddy
[1:18:42] which means takes from another word to
[1:18:45] be red to be rubbed red dyed red show
[1:18:48] red glare
[1:18:50] whoa
[1:18:51] to show blood to flesh or turn rosy
[1:18:57] hmm
[1:18:59] well those are interesting things when
[1:19:02] he's talking about makes
[1:19:04] man
[1:19:05] these are all things that pertain to man
[1:19:07] and all those things come from a
[1:19:09] another a
[1:19:13] root where then it goes into an image
[1:19:17] to turn rosy let me just i'll throw this
[1:19:19] in because it's a whole another message
[1:19:21] we spoke a couple years ago
[1:19:23] but when it says to turn rosie what is
[1:19:25] it if your cheeks are rosy what's
[1:19:27] usually happened
[1:19:30] you're embarrassed
[1:19:33] something has gotten under your skin
[1:19:35] and you're embarrassed and there's
[1:19:37] another place where it talks about it in
[1:19:39] the scripture
[1:19:40] and it says the
[1:19:42] talking about
[1:19:43] god
[1:19:44] and man
[1:19:46] and it says that he
[1:19:48] he became ruddy or rosy god was
[1:19:50] embarrassed
[1:19:54] by what adam did
[1:19:57] he was embarrassed and yet at the same
[1:19:59] time the nature of god allowed that so
[1:20:03] that he could become red
[1:20:06] or bloody
[1:20:08] or and we could we could go on with that
[1:20:10] but it says to to he made him in his
[1:20:13] image which is his likeness his
[1:20:14] resemblance
[1:20:19] to be empty or emptied to and the root
[1:20:21] word is to shade or phantom and to make
[1:20:24] an illusion an image
[1:20:26] to represent a figure
[1:20:28] and there's a few others
[1:20:30] so and it means his likeness or
[1:20:35] similitude it comes in as we get into
[1:20:38] that just a little further
[1:20:40] in his image so
[1:20:42] he makes man in this image
[1:20:45] what man do you suppose he's talking
[1:20:47] about right here
[1:20:49] he's talking about the one that became
[1:20:51] bloody
[1:20:53] flesh or flushed
[1:20:56] blared
[1:20:58] what happens in the book of revelations
[1:21:00] and it talks about his eyes
[1:21:02] angry at sin
[1:21:05] it's talking about the creation of jesus
[1:21:07] christ
[1:21:09] let us make man in our image and here's
[1:21:12] where it changes
[1:21:16] where it says in the likeness
[1:21:18] it changes
[1:21:20] because it's in it means to be like him
[1:21:23] and it's similar to but it's a feminine
[1:21:26] word
[1:21:28] whoa now wait a minute
[1:21:30] so we're going to make a man and it says
[1:21:32] and it's very distinct about that is a
[1:21:34] male
[1:21:35] in other words a seed bearing man who
[1:21:38] bears the seed
[1:21:40] my word is a seed
[1:21:42] it's jesus christ
[1:21:46] a man
[1:21:47] in our image after the image
[1:21:50] in hebrews
[1:21:53] chapter one i'll read it real quick
[1:21:58] do you love him
[1:22:00] oh help me lord
[1:22:04] it says after his image
[1:22:09] but i'm trying to
[1:22:11] speed up here
[1:22:13] after his image
[1:22:16] who being is one verse three who being
[1:22:19] the brightness of his glory and the
[1:22:21] express image of his person
[1:22:25] and if you read the first part it's god
[1:22:28] who speaks to us by his son
[1:22:31] who is the express image of his person
[1:22:34] whose person it's the person of god
[1:22:38] the beginning in jesus christ
[1:22:43] but here it says after
[1:22:45] our likeness what happens between
[1:22:50] image and likeness
[1:22:52] likeness is a feminine word
[1:22:56] it's female
[1:22:58] it means to be the same as to like after
[1:23:01] to model to shape after the same manner
[1:23:05] and in as you continue down there with
[1:23:08] that
[1:23:09] when it goes into that the next that
[1:23:12] likeness the next thing we see is the
[1:23:14] blessing
[1:23:16] that i give you the right
[1:23:21] he says in verse 28
[1:23:25] god blessed him and says be fruitful
[1:23:27] multiply replenish the earth
[1:23:30] but it says god created man in his own
[1:23:33] image in the image of god created he
[1:23:36] him
[1:23:37] god is creating himself as we find in
[1:23:40] revelations chapter 3
[1:23:43] the beginning of the creation of god and
[1:23:46] from that man
[1:23:50] god gives the promise to the woman who's
[1:23:53] in him
[1:23:57] god created man his own injury he
[1:23:59] created he him
[1:24:01] he created he him
[1:24:06] the seedbear well you say what about
[1:24:08] adam well
[1:24:09] where was adam when jesus christ was on
[1:24:12] calvary
[1:24:14] he was in the grave friends
[1:24:17] by waiting for the day that jesus came
[1:24:19] back
[1:24:20] out of hell
[1:24:22] and knocked at the door
[1:24:25] that's him
[1:24:26] that's the one
[1:24:28] that's the one that slew the lamb for
[1:24:31] even i
[1:24:34] jesus christ in every scripture do you
[1:24:37] love him
[1:24:38] praise the lord
[1:24:40] well
[1:24:42] i actually got a little over halfway
[1:24:44] that's amazing
[1:24:46] let's stand sister could you come and
[1:24:48] play us a song
[1:24:52] my mind
[1:24:55] he's in every scripture friends
[1:24:58] and as we
[1:24:59] if we were to go account there's a few
[1:25:01] more and there's one of those
[1:25:03] that it actually has oh i think it's in
[1:25:06] that first one we read where it says in
[1:25:07] the day
[1:25:09] in that word day
[1:25:11] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:25:16] he's everywhere
[1:25:19] he's everywhere it's all
[1:25:22] jesus christ if he can keep this word
[1:25:25] together for
[1:25:27] well we don't know exactly when the book
[1:25:28] of job was but that's the oldest
[1:25:32] and there's so much jesus christ in jo
[1:25:34] in the book of job
[1:25:36] what about in you and i
[1:25:42] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:25:44] forever

[1:25:46] that was in jesus christ the he him
[1:25:49] that was created
[1:25:52] and we're made in that likeness
[1:25:55] the seed that's in the mail is
[1:25:58] transferred
[1:25:59] to what we call the bride of jesus
[1:26:01] christ
[1:26:03] to bring forth
[1:26:07] the same likeness
