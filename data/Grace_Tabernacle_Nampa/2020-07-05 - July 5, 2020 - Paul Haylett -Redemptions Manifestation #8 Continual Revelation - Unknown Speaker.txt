me he says it was brother Tim Dean Hart's 58th birthday he wants to make sure how remember that last Thursday so god bless you brother Tim hey man where the Sergei is listening to the service my wife never wants me announce anything see I didn't do it thanks brother David yes 23 years for me it's been joyous for my wife it's been long a man well thank you for the specials they're beautiful let's sing that little course number 114 he wasn't looking at me when he took me in he was looking at the bloody man he wasn't looking at me when it appears he wasn't looking at my heart I will I said he was against the blood [Music] fresh blood it was looking at me when he clubbed me was looking at my heart [Music] I said he was dunking [Music] precious flower [Music] amen aren't you glad that blood covers you today hallelujah we kind of forgot to mention our brother Isaac Nash he's healing up they have kind of a stuff they put over the incisions and stuff and it's starting to come off and the doctor told him he'll be as miserable as he's ever been as that happened so we just we want to remember him in prayer my brother Trevor's we said it's not feeling too well today they called me first thing this morning kind of a little apologetic that they hope that whatever brother Trevor's not feeling good from didn't get passed to anyone else but you know it's interesting as we arrived yesterday to the fellowship I just felt led of the Lord before we even got out of the car I just stopped and I bound every virus every spirit everything that could just hinder the body of Christ and you know I believe that with all of my heart Saints these are not just words I believe God's granted us the authority amen to stand upon the word to loose the word in our lives to bind anything contrary to the word amen so definitely remember brother Trevor sister Kari brother Mason today and so I'm gonna do something that brother Jason forgot to do he gave a greeting to brother Jake so I being the second part and the pulpit will give the greeting to sister ELISA and we are happy to have sister ELISA with us today amen I was trying to remember brother Jake when I first met you what you are 17 you don't have to give public notice how old you are now but we can say that's been a long time and so it's already mentioned our brother Sergei on the road Amen you know I just something else I just want to say there's two young men that I've since I first met them had a great fondness for and one of them we get to share the name and we both we we don't know which ones blessed but it's really happy to see our brother Pavel with us this morning amen and you know brother Alex I'm sorry but you moved here you just old stuff now amen but you know two fine young men just just lovely young men and it's a real pleasure for me to know them young men in love with the Lord just have a burning desire in their heart amen and so brother Pineville driving down that kind of have a little mini family reunion today so amen let's just turn in our Bibles amen and we'll go into the book of Genesis I want to talk to you we spoke last week on a fresh revelation aren't you glad the revelation is fresh Amen it's not something that's old it's not something that's wore out from times gone by but it's real it's alive it's here today amen I just realized something is sister yuliya not here today no so you're not feeling well they don't Venessa not feeling well okay well I saw her kissing the dog yesterday so amen well let's remember the whole family then in prayer today amen but we need to remember and sister that the fresh revelation was not a one-time revelation God didn't just stir your heart one time that it was fresh only once no he said I'll be with you even in you amen and we need to remember that God does not have a long-distance relationships Amen now we can be anywhere on the earth but God Himself does not deal in long-distance relationships Amen God's not looking for us to just wander off somewhere he wants you to be up close and present amen or he's your ever-present help in the time of trouble amen let's just stand his will turn in our Bibles this morning to Genesis the fourth chapter and we'll we'll take our fought out of the Word of God amen Genesis 4:1 and Eve knew his wife I mean an Adam knew his wife start over and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived let me you know it's terrible where I hate to just be this way there have to take him off and get really closer I have to get back and out of knew Eve his wife and she conceived in bare Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bare his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord now we'll touch on if we get to it I have a lot on the platter today if we get to it will kind of tie this into this offering portion also and Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen and if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto these shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it into pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him now we oftentimes don't look at this scripture this way but I just want to make this comment before we move on and Cain talked with Abel his brother you know what they were talking about Saints doctrine they were talking about what was right what was wrong what was rooted in the Word of God now they had brother Branham says no Bible but we'll touch on that in a few minutes Heavenly Father Lord we ask you Lord to come today father we have those that are sick in our midst Lord just ask you to go to each and every hole Father and touch each one Lord those that father recovering from surgery our brother Isaac to those who might not be feeling well father just ask you Lord just to move in our mitts for Lord we are already healed it's a past tense by your stripes father so Lord we're just claiming what's already been given to us rightly so and Lord asking it to come to pass today Oh Lord as we open the word let us only speak according to thy word father for thy pleasure in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you see Satan has from the very beginning my brother and sister tried to dispute the Word of God he's tried to dispute what God would give to his people amen so there is that you can study that if you go in and dispute disputer you'll find the context and how that it comes all through the scripture and that Satan is constantly there trying to refute in a very subtly everything that God is doing now we go on here and I want to just lay this a little foundation because we're going to take our thought from the position where Abel come from the prophet of God says you want to know about something you go back to the beginning or the origin amen Hebrews 11 and one says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh amen you know I was just reading some commentary by a very intellectual theologian has written many works of is considered by many to be an authority on things of Bible and talking about going back to the originals and and these kind of things very like I said very intellectual and you know in one of his writings he makes a statement that we have misunderstood the teachings of the Apostle Paul that it is not by we being sinners saved by grace it is not by his his merit not our merit but he says you know that that you have to have all works and much of what Paul was speaking was drawn out of other context and not necessarily represented correctly and you know it's interesting because there was a lot of comments upon this writing and I thought you know isn't that the world we live in today I thought brother Pavel's special sister Gerry's special both spoke to me in the fashion because you see my brother and sister without God opening our eyes men intellectually look at the Word of God and they come to intellectual conceptions or intellectual conclusions and you know to realize that by an intellectual conclusion all you can do is take what was spoken here and what was spoken here and logically put them together but we understand by the Word of God that revelation is how God has chose to work God has come in our generations we can look back all through the Bible all through the ages and we can look at that and we can see with the with the side note of of time past right looking back that we can see those things coming to pass but look at the day that we're living in Amen God still working God still present his word is still unfolding amen just as they have discovered that the galaxy is still unfolding amen that we look at the word today and know that the word is still unfolding amen it did not come to a place that God put a period on the end of it but God said I'm gonna let it be manifest in this day that we're living in through sons and daughters of God they will be that a living epistle that's going to be read of all men now God could have just as easily chosen to come back in a flash as he did in Jesus Christ in that flesh he could have come back and revealed himself in this last day but God had such confidence my brother and sister-in you and I that he said I'll just come and dwell in them and let them shine my gospel to the world now if you don't believe that is a great degree of confidence my brother and sister then you are mistaken because God is entrusted the very representation of who he is to you and I Amen I think that's pretty special myself amen to see how that God would come and in that fashion would make himself known to the world in human flesh amen Oh as we look at this I got a lot like I said here and I'll just try and hurry along amen he said wait now brother branham I want you to take these if you have time feel led to go back and get the whole context of what he's saying here because obviously we can't take the whole sermon that he preached and draw it out but brother brown says here in the sermon the rapture he's talking with a gentleman amen and this man has a certain idea about the Gospels and brother Browns in a conversation with him and he said we'll never be able brother branham to get the things together till we get every word upon word upon word exactly with the Greek and so forth amen brother Favell I enjoyed that right because you see God's gonna hide it my brother and sister he's gonna choose those who are willing to say Lord show it to me I have no idea revealed your word to me lord I need revelation of that he's going to open it to them hide it to that intellectual man amen and so this man is telling brother Branham we won't know until we get every word upon word upon word exactly with the Greek and so forth nowhere in the Bible my brother does that say if you know the Greek that you got the faith of God amen he said Oh sir you know III said Oh sir you know better than that I said even then I see a council way back as far at 300 years from the death of Christ they were still debating which Greek scholar was right you can know it's a revelation the whole thing he said I cannot accept revelation now my brother and sister this sounds kind of strange but we have people who are standing on the earth today that when the Prophet left the scene they have no further desire to know anything more than they can find on the written page but the Prophet never taught that the bible does not teach that amen so we see here they're saying I cannot accept revelation I said then how can you accept Christ he said why the Bible said he that believeth on Jesus Christ has everlasting life and I said that is true it also says no man can call Jesus a Christ only by the revelation of the Holy Ghost that's revealed it to him so we have this paradox that people say well if I say Jesus is the Christ I've witnessed to these people and they say well I believe Jesus is the Christ I'm saved but my brother and sister that is just an outward anyone in infidel could repeat those words so there has to be something more that is there and my brother branham come here and he says you know it says no man can call Jesus the Christ only by revelation of the Holy Ghost that's the Word of God amen see there you are right back around again falls right back to the revelation it's got to be revealed in the Bible amen Cain and Abel didn't have a Bible to read but it was revealed to Abel by faith oh look at this now I want you to catch this it was revealed to Abel by faith which is revelation is a revelation you see faith my brother and sister is a revelation people say well you know I've never in my life I I believe the message I've listened to the preaching ideas and I don't know that I've ever really had a revelation you had faith to believe the Word of God that was a revelation come down upon you amen otherwise we would then be good Methodists or Baptists or whatever it might have been that is in your lineage amen Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Canaan which God testified that he was righteous amen so as we look at this my brother and sister we real lives and I just encourage you to read your Bible read the message and understand that this of faith that God has put in you is a revelation you say well okay I just read I just picked up a message book I know many a individual that their their testimony theirs down in Chile testimony about how a young man and his wife were living and and in Chile they oftentimes a share like a lot of the Latin American countries their trash is actually on a pole out on the street and it's up in these baskets up high so the dogs and whatever won't get in and tear up the trash and oftentimes people share and it's a culture now not so much you guys mostly would be a little weirded out if you looked out on trash day and brother Paul was out in your little trash can or a little dumpster digging through your trash you'd be like whoa what are you doing going through my trap but you see their culture is such that one's man trash is another man's treasure and so oftentimes you will find right in reasonably nice neighborhoods people going through someone else's trash because there might be something in there that they could use and so this is not an uncommon thing and so here it was with this this young man raised in a messege household went off into the world got married he's just living his wife and his mother had such a burden for him that she was constantly sending him message books and he would look at them and he would just go home I you know and throw him in the trash and the neighbor lady would haul her trash out and just according to the culture would dig through the trash amen and she was finding these books and she's like now why would he be throwing something away that could be read or something of this nature and the lady takes it home and she starts reading this message books now you tell me God is non-sovereign amen and so she's reading this message books and something starts stirring inside of her heart and she starts sharing him with her husband and with her children and they come one day and are just like Oh hallelujah she meets him one day in the driveway and says where did you get these she said oh my mom and dad send them to me but I don't believe and she says how can you not believe this and he felt so convicted in his heart and he went away from there and it was many months later but it was there deep in his heart how can I not believe that something kept telling him this is the truth this is the truth this is the truth and he come one day and he is talking to his neighbor and he says well you know I was raised up in a very strict this and a very strict bat and the woman says don't tell me about strictness I'm a Catholic well I'll have to find another excuse I was raised in a messege house and my parents were so strict and they were so this and we couldn't do this and we couldn't drink and we couldn't smoke and we couldn't dance and we couldn't look my brother and sister half of the population on earth Christian or not doesn't do those things right where's your excuse hmm God will tear down our excuse my brother and sister and he'll replace it two sons and daughters of God with revelation anyway so now get this now the trash that she's digging in brings the word to her and then she has such a burden for a young man who won't take what he was raised in and she is now certain it's the truth and she starts going to his house now you got to understand neighborhoods like that many times the neighbors can be almost like family and she starts going and she just starts telling this guy's wife you know that if you don't follow the Bible that you'll be lost and the young lady had just enough religion she's like yeah we know we should just as well my Bible says that are you dressing like you're dressing is the wrong spirit my Bible says that you cutting your hair is the wrong spirit my Bible says and my brother and sister this woman was relentless until one day the young man said fine fine fine please stop please stop now you've got my wife believing this now imagine not to sound crass but imagine now you sleep in the bed with a person who's witnessing to you it don't get any closer than that God let it be that powerful if we need moved Lord let the one that sleeps beside us at night be witnessing to us maybe not in words but maybe in deed amen because you see when God wants to get all the overburden you know when they go mining they dig the overburden off right and many of us have a lot of overburden and God will keep sweeping away that overburden until he can get down to the place that he shows you really what it's all about in the beginning amen and so here it is Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain did he have an intellectual understanding no my brother and sister he didn't have an encyclopedia he didn't have some kind of reference book but he had revelation and revelation ultimately must come and stir the heart of who it was sent to and it will bring forth the birthing of the word amen and so Cain come now imagine this as we look at this story the Cain is there now talking I mean to Abel a men boy I'm just rattled and going 90 miles an hour this morning pray for me Abel no doubt now having conversation with Cain and telling him look brother I don't know why I believe it has to be the blood I don't know why I do this and Cain says well this is what I see look looks like a modern day that we live in this is what I think it is and Abel's over here saying this is what I think it is and there had to be something my brother and sister that convicted Cain's heart to the point that he would rise up and slay his own brother and anointing right there what was it he was anointed to reject the word Amen and he would persecute anything that believed the word Amen so as we looked at this this morning my brother and sister God doesn't come just open his word once and went on he didn't say just let there be light my brother and sister the manifestation of light became the testimony of him saying let there like amen so there has to be a manifestation amen so as we look at this we recognize I just jumping over to the Apostle Paul for a moment amen now look at the Apostle Paul we know his life very educated man amen and he was a very zealous man oh my that we could be as zealous as soul was amen and God takes him now and takes Paul to the backside of the desert and there was two things that happened there in the backside of the desert one he had a complete death to self and he received revelation from God there's actually a deeper correlation there than many times we give that credit and when the Apostle Paul went to the backside of the desert mother brother and sister if he went out there and said well the Sanhedrin says or these say or they say he would have come out of the desert with the same revelation he went into the desert with but the Apostle Paul went out into the backside of the desert God met him there he had a complete death unto himself and in that as a new creature he was able to receive revelation from God in other words the vessel had been empty out completely now it was not a vessel to honor that was converted dishonor that was converted to a vessel of Honor he always was a vessel of Honor my brother and sister but God just showed him what his calling was so as he comes out of the backside of the desert he has a revelation amen that he can see and God anoints him to preach and to write and he has written Rutten Rutten a great portion of the Bible by revelation see he didn't even have anything to go back and reference to himself he didn't have any cross reference he didn't have any he wrote by revelation now the world thinks that Paul may be kind of just you know went off on a whim and wrote this and then we've just as a Christian Church accepted this but my brother and sister we come down to the simple point we either believe that the Word of God is infallible or we don't and if we don't believe it's infallible then what are we doing here so as we look at this and realize that the scripture declares that these things were not of men but was of God and so that's where we stand on the word of God today amen now you know I'm going to touch on this and I hope it's not touchy to you and some people it might be but my brother and sister I have had conversations where people have looked me in the face and said all new revelation ended when the prophet left the scene oh my brother and sister I'll tell you I don't agree with that at all because you see the prophet of God come he opened the word he restored his back to it made it a new book amen just thinking not trying to go off in this vein but the prophet of God showed us how we had to clean the channel out now if the channel being cleaned out was just for the Prophet then he wouldn't have needed to have taught us that we needed to get the channel cleaned out we were just said well pray for the Prophet pray for brother Blanton Branham that the channel would be cleaned out for him so he could bring us the word but the prophet of God go back through the message amen he said you got to get that channel you got to get all them sticks and leaves and all that garbage out of that channel you've got to get it cleared out and clearly shows us as that channel is between you and God amen so when we get that channel cleared out is that just so God can drop a tidbit here and there to us make us feel good no my brother and sister them that was so we could come and we have a direct intercession with the throne of Almighty God and God would deal directly with you and I Amen how often is it my brother and sister just to reiterate things we've spoke on how often is it that you come to church and you say wow the pastor spoke on the very situation that we are facing or dealing with in our life now my brother and sister you got one really smart pastor don't you know you've got a clear channel to the throne of God and God is then sending confirmation to you I heard your prayer and I have given the word to you and we stand upon that knowing that God is mindful of the needs of his sons and daughters amen now you look at this my brother and sister so revelation did not leave us in fact for a restored Church revelation was just opened up it was then just brought to awareness to you and I that we would be able to come and God Himself would come down and speak to our need revelation won't stop my brother's sister because this is God's Way of revealing himself in his bride see not on the page not on a book on a shelf somewhere not in some kind of archaeological thing but God Himself revealing himself in his bride day by day if we accept anything less than that then you might as well just go wrap yourself up and become a mummy well excuse me see how personal this is you can just look at a bride and see what kind of relationship she has with her husband I remember one time a sister looked me in the face and said you know what I and my husband are not one I have a brain I don't need him to do my thinking for me out I hope her husband never finds out she feels that way because he's gonna be one disheartened man my brother and sister you see the very nature that is there as you look see you can look at the church and see what kind of relationship she has with her husband and oftentimes you'll find that those two go hand in hand when you have a church that does not have a close relationship with the Lord you will find people in that church without a close relationship with the Lord now some of you required this morning and I hope that it's not because you're bored but I hope maybe something Stern or hard to realize the prophet of God said the natural and the spiritual are parallel amen you cannot be cold on God and have the kind of relationship you should with a spouse amen and that goes both ways amen it's not just our sisters right and in the church is just a type or the bride is just to type amen but you look at that I tell you sister Geri and I have these kind of conversations you know we are she is feisty amen she lets me know how she feels about things but my brother and sister you see we've never gave up on working on being one there's a few things we don't agree on hey men well anyway ah hey we won't go there amen we don't have enough time whew can be pretty broad amen no I'm just using this for a type Saints I know you realize this there's things that we disagree on and there's times we fuss with one another but the thing that we always have in common is reconciliation amen we always come back knowing that I am NOT complete without her she's not complete without me amen and we want to be complete amen and so we as the Bride of Christ are not complete without a full blown on fire relationship with God a half-hearted long-distance relationship will not work my brother and sister don't fool yourself and say well I pray I read my Bible well remember my brothers sister you can pray and read your Bible but unless you submit yourself to that it will not do one thing for you it's in the submission to the word that we find deliverance amen so people say well we belong to this church we believe the message we this we that that's good are you obedient to it have you died to yourself and accepted Christ's headship for your life amen in the message awakening Jesus now brother Branham says here he says all down through the scriptures they had a commandment that the Jews did that if there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet I the Lord will make myself known unto him in visions and what he says comes to pass then hear that prophet for I'm with him but if it doesn't come to pass then don't hear him now that's just logical that's just sensible like when there was a man stood up on time Jeremiah major prophet the Lord told him that Judah was going down to be down in Babylon for 70 years said don't you listen to a dreamer to a prophet or anything says contrary to that he put a yoke on his neck and Hananiah now Hanna and I was a prophet and not only that but he the son of a prophet his father was a prophet and he came up under inspiration and took the yoke off of his neck and broke it now God put a yoke on a prophets neck neck and told him this is the word and this is what I was doing the yoke was refract or if from reflecting that that is now binding God's word he spoke it Amen just like thus saith the Lord is binding my brother and sister and so that yoke was placed there that this will be seventy years but Hananiah under a different inspiration he comes and he takes in this yoke off his neck and broken and said thus saith the Lord in two years they're coming back who the people could clap their hands on it my that was good they got excited they've heard something that got them excited you know what we're all all did I say all going in the rapture well come on get excited all that are in Christ you see the word quantifies it but we could come and preach that everyone's going in the rapture I don't care how you live no see it wouldn't matter if somebody come and spoke those things because you see God put the yoke upon you and I according to the word that we know see we often look at this yoke is bondage but you have to understand the reference that's being made so he puts this yoke on on him and he comes and he says going to be seventy years and he comes and says nope thus saith the Lord in two years they're coming back the people could clap their hands on that my that was good they wanted to listen to Hananiah but it was contrary to the word it wasn't the word you see therefore Jeremiah said Hannah and I Amen the Lord grant your words to come to pass but wait a minute let us remember there has been prophets before us and when the prophet prophesies and he is known the Prophet is known when his prophecy comes to pass oh my my brother's sister not because the words are spoken now many people I've heard this and everyone's got the right to their point of view but I people say well I studied the message and I see here here and here where brother branham said these things would happen and they never happened well my brother and sister I'll just give a little insight God is dealing with you can someone say Amen I don't always know how God answers your prayers imagine if everyone of us come to church every single service and told of the things that God had done for us we almost would have no time for preaching or praying or anything because God is moving amen and people expect all of this to be done on the public stage this is their problem they expect it to be on the public stage that will see God move but the Word of God shows us and the Prophet reiterated it that the bride is a very small group Oh so God is moving in the midst of the bride and the world out here which could be the make believer unbeliever hearing the same message and they're saying God's not doing this and we're starting to question in this but it's what God's doing in the bride because that word he prophesied wasn't to the world as it were but it was to the bride now some of it concerns the world but my brother and sister God's not out here as it is preaching to the world trying to convert the unrepentant the sign and the word to the unrepentant is to confirm a judgment is coming hmm right they'll be judged by the word Amen so it's there that we realize God's got a word the bulk of this Bible my brother and sister is just words and that people read the bulk of this Bible is just something they have on a shelf the bulk of this Bible is something they can make a casual referral to but my brother and sister to the Bride of Christ this is the word of life this is not something casual it is not something vague it is not something to be just set to the sign but it is literally the word of life amen now have some I see some Indian friends sitting here and I was reading on their history some time ago in the early Christian days of the Indian and they had to follow the game to live and if there come a prophet among them and he prophesied and told them where the game was he become chief but if he prophesied a lie that was the end of his road imagine if we practice that No oh my that's right brother Pavel oh my sorry brothers forgot to take this guy out behind the church and shoot him oh my we wouldn't stand for that there's just no way we could stand for that no no no no they got rid of him right now he didn't live no longer just in case you was thought I was being vague about what happened to him he didn't live no longer well that was the same basis that God did God told Jeremiah Hananiah has lied I never told him that wait the man stood in all his priestly garments he stood with the authority God said thus saith the Lord but that spirit is so strong it anointed him supply wouldn't it have been a lot better if he'd have just said lord please reveal to me is what he Jeremiah is saying is that the truth huh not the lift brother Pavel up but I really think that song was anointed right it's gotta be to those who are willing to learn look how different this story would be if Hananiah went out and said before I open my mouth I'm just gonna go out here and I'm gonna get down and I'm gonna pray and ask Lord Lord what is it I want to know the truth Lord are they gonna come back in two years or are they coming back in 70 years cuz Lord I want to be right with your word but you see that anointing is so strong that religious spirits so strong Hananiah comes there but God you know shows Jeremiah says look I never told him that it's contrary to his word and he'll be off the earth within a year in the seventh month he died he took him off the earth now you see although he was inspired but it was contrary to the word no matter how now I want you to catch this this would apply to me brother David brother Chris whoever might stand behind this pulpit we're not trying to cut some exemption for us it's about them not us my brother and sister this pertains to you and I amen at the ministry amen look look at this now no matter how forceful a preacher can preach or how well he can make look if it's contrary to the word leave away from it stay away from it clear it's the word that's God's program the complete revelation of what he was what he is and what he will be it's a continual this where I got my title just in case you want to know it's a continual revelation of Jesus Christ so it can't be on the word most of the time and off here a little and off they are little and then back onto Jesus Christ well this is our idea this is our idea this is our deal here now no my brother and sister it's a continual revelation of Jesus Christ a complete revelation of Jesus Christ because you can have something this continual but never is complete oh but the word here the prophet of God saying it's complete Oh hallelujah God's not gonna leave any loose ends amen it's a continual revelation of Jesus Christ you know I'll just give myself I'll just slap myself a little bit just make up for slapping sister Jerry earlier now you know sister Jerry and I are working on that house remodeling away on a house she says Paul for the first time my life I'd like to live in a house it's completely finished you know what she's saying she wants all the loose ends tied up brother Jake and sister Lisa look at each other like go ahead sister Lisa lift your hands and just say Amen come on we can't laugh at ourselves we're in trouble but you see not a lot of loose ends right cuz we can leave loose ends I you know I told sister Jerry probably 14 years ago don't worry about honey we'll look at this stuff and times not over yet but see God's not doing that my brother's sister he's not just leaving you won't look down through the Bible and find a lot of loose ins just left out there or God was like oh just forgot to that I'm a little too tired I got a new program no my brother and sister don't work that way amen continual revelation of Jesus Christ and a complete revelation of Jesus Christ is this Bible anything revealed contrary of him telling what he would do what he is now old that was in the days of the past don't you believe it it's got to be the same Jesus you see and that's the word now Amen so we look at this and realize you say brother Paul why'd you read that because we have to come to the understanding that when God gives revelation it fits clearly in his program it is not something that has to have an addendum and be put to the outside another reference or referral as it were coming to another book being pulled off a shelf my brother and sister I don't mean to speak ill of this but I got a lot of family background in Mormonism my brother and sister what they did is just took and created at their own book and added it they do not deny the Bible but they just basically imply that their books supersedes the Bible it's the continuation of the Bible but the prophet of God don't you love this gives you confidence to stand on the word when he said there is no other there is no other add on here everything must go back to the Bible and so then when I pick up my church order when I pick up adoption when I pick up demonology when I pick up all of these things the rapture and I read that my brother and sister I know that I have the right context when it fits seamlessly back into the word and if I can't put it seamlessly back into the word I don't then take this message and throw it out and say it's wrong I realize that my revelation is not lining up with the words and so because that is an anointing my brother and sister and people would put their their revelation above the Word of God and then they find a way to make the revelation fit now imagine that you would take your Bible and I'll kind of wished I had some pages you know little things slip your mind but imagine you know my brother and sister you come along and brother Paul would have you know have a page here and I would come here and tell you now here we are revelations 10 seven and you know because you can't get this and you don't understand it I've added this page right in here and that now becomes the continuum know who's going to accept that but some people think that's what the message is oh I don't hope I don't offend no one but some think that's what the message is but my brother and sister the message is to take the bird and it come back when I say the word meaning the message and it come back and seamlessly will fit in there without changing the context of one single scripture there's when revelation has come amen not revelation that you all have to sell everything and give it to me my people do those kind of things amen and people fall for those kind of things but this isn't what God's doing he's moving right here in the midst of his people amen so it's there that he's stirring in that place now as we look at this my brother and sister we understand how it must have been to those people no one would want to be sitting there and when Jeremiah said you know what you're gonna be down there and Babylon seventy years some of them would have said oh my 70 years I'll be dead somebody comes along you'll be back in - oh hallelujah I'll just go ahead and make this investment and I'll just go ahead and do this and I'll just go ahead and do that because I'm gonna be back in two years they would have loved that my brother and sister but the word of the Lord was 70 years no matter how they felt about it now look I have made a claim pretty much my whole life since I come back to the Lord the Lord I want to be one of those that's alive and remains at the coming of the Lord that's my heart's desire I even claim that claim for my mama and she's getting quite elderly now 88 years old or so 89 you know my brother and sister now I can claim that but I can't make it soul but I don't really care whether I'm here alive and remain at the coming of the Lord just as long as I'm there with him you see sometimes we get an emphasis on things reminds me years ago those situation happened down in the south and the United States and and I use this a little bit loosely a sister had a dream that they were all to go on a certain date and stand on top of a mountain and that was going to be the rapture a Moakley it was revealed to them and them only and so you know there was a lot of people I know some of these people I know them personally and they quit jobs they sold houses and land and everything they had and you know the pastor said well you know the thing is is to make this come to pass you know you probably need to give some of that money and we can use it for good things before the rapture that should have been the first thing that got you going in the other direction but you know they went stood on top of a mountain on the very morning went up there in the dark and this mountain has a look out there beautiful beautiful view of the countryside and they said that in the dream when the Sun cleared the top of a certain mountain the rapture was taking place so the Sun clears the top of that mountain nothing has happened and they got to looking around and there was a certain brother and his wife and children were not there and they said well it's his fault the rapture never took place does that fit the scripture you know what they did they went back down to the valley and blamed everything on him but you know what he says you know what his defense was I've got the message and I've got my Bible and that doesn't fit into either one it's still your fault oh by the way talking about the money they never saw it again you see my brother and sister don't be deceived don't be deceived the word is here revelation has come it's alive it's for you and I amen believe it amen the continual revelation of Jesus Christ the complete revelation of Jesus Christ is this Bible amen now as we look at this hopefully I'm not speaking too strongly to you today amen this is the food that's going to keep us amen sustain us this is the the life that is here this is our roadmap this is what's keeping us safe in the day that we live in is the Word of God now in the patent or vision brother Brown says now this actually this morning was more of a sermon type placing a foundation upon the deity of the revelation God being revealed in Christ how many believes it was revealed in Christ Jehovah revealed in Christ now where's God to be revealed in his church with his people in us hallelujah the same spirit the same works the same manifestation the same love the same forgiveness the same long-suffering my gentleness patience peace mercy all that was in Christ is in the church remember keep this in mind all that God was he poured into Christ he was a fullness of the Godhead bodily and all that Christ was he poured into the church hallelujah who's the church is that these four walls and a roof no my brother's sister we are the church hallelujah God above us God with us God in us the tri-unity of God God manifested in three different manners Father Son and Holy Spirit so this revelation my brother and sister as it is see it's the revelation that God was revealed in Christ [Music] Jehovah revealed in Christ and God revealed in his church you have neat why don't you just ask God to reveal to you Scott word let the word be revealed to us or would you rather I've started wearing a collar that turned around backwards and maybe even a robe I saw really cool in the other day I don't know if I would look like a priest or Dracula well they're both sucking your blood come on Saints you have an intercession right to the throne of God amen now God's got a he's got the minister he's got the evangelists a teacher all of these in place for the perfecting of the Saints according to the word but my brother and sister they're not Jehovah they're not Almighty God they're men and they're not even fallible so when you put in the right context put them in the right position what will they do I tell you I know brother I respect this brother a whole lot and I have through the years practice the very thing that I learned from him and as a pastor people would come and they would have all kinds of troubles and they would come and say pastor you need to give us advice and they would pour their troubles out and then they were waiting in anticipation of a great answer and then he would look him in the face and say have you prayed about it and they would say yes yes yes yes so we prayed about it how long well hallelujah then he wouldn't hear from him for a little bit and they'd ask him now brother sister what about that problem we took your advice pastor and we prayed about it and God answered it mama that's a pretty wise pastor wait he doesn't even know really what God's answer was right they could tell him we got problems in marriage problem in finance a problem with children we got a problem with this we got whatever it is but he don't even know he's not even aware of what God did to answer it but they are standing there testifying that through prayer God answered it what was that revelation on the personal level come down to them and spoke to them and they were then able to go forward in their life with an answer with a direction because God had revealed to them well that's what revelation is isn't it or is that the thing that everybody gets nervous when someone says I have revelation oh my goodness what is this going to be no my brother and sister God is revealing himself to each and every one of us every single day every day that the bride is coming closer to him is revelation Amen him revealing himself to you and I hallelujah now let's take all the scary part about this what revelation is and to realize my brother and sister without ever coming to some great conclusion oh the scripture meant this and the scripture meant that or I saw this or I saw that that if you are praying reading your Bible submitting yourself to the Word of God you will have revelation in your life you say brother Paul that's pretty far-reaching no that's the truth amen you don't have revelation in your life is because you are not reading your Bible you are not praying and if you're doing those two you're not submitting to God hallelujah oh my the other day I really like this quote right here the other day I was talking and we were thinking of Scripture I said why can't people see that now my brother and sister sometimes things just seem so clear to us oh that that everybody ought to see this everybody ought to see this why can't people see that I said there it is and I happen to think hmmm I don't care how clear it is how much scripture teaches us you'll never be able to see it until God Himself shows it to you don't care how clear it is and the whole Bible is built and the whole Church of the Living God is built upon a spiritual revelation of the word look my brother and sister not because we can read quotes not because we can read scripture but it's built upon the spiritual revelation of the word amen and I just jump back up I want to do ever look this over again it is how much the scripture teach it you'll never be able to see it until God Himself shows it to you don't care how clear it is and the whole Bible is built in the whole Living God is built upon spiritual revelation of the word why did they will offer a more excellent sacrifice than Cain why didn't a below King do you see what the prophet of God says right there his church Cain's church was nicer I think I want to go to a nicer church why didn't Abel follow Kane he had the most beautiful church but it was revealed to him not revelation didn't take him over into beauty it took him over here into this messy gospel this messy gospel now get this I hope you catch the spiritual correlation where things had to die where blood had to be spilt and the blood had to be placed correctly oh god help us Lord let us die and then let the blood be placed correctly upon us amen it's not a beautiful church it's not a beautiful this and a beautiful that my brother and sister if it was we'd all be going to Cain's church but God by revelation showed us that the very blood of Jesus Christ is the only hope that we have amen and us dying is the only hope that we have because if we don't die my brother and sister the blood cannot change a single thing that's the part that's not really revealed my brother and sister when you look down in goshen and the blood was over the doorpost hey man you didn't have a rebellious father saying oh well if they're gonna make me get a lamb I'll kill it and I'll put the blood in the bowl and I'll put it on the doorpost my brother and sister that didn't work but that was a father that was a man had a revelation that this is the only thing old parents I hope you get this today this blood over the doorpost of my home is the only thing that's going to save my children it is not we believe the message it is not God is good is none of this is the blood over the doorpost of my house is going to save my children and not buy AB Ribble yes parent not buy a rebellious household but by submitting to the Word of God if this Lord is what you ask then Lord this is what I give hallelujah and the life in that blood then become God's own life over their household and God then would say their children Oh hallelujah but then again if we want a beautiful church that doesn't mean we let our church fall apart the scenes because we want to be humble but by the same token when everything has to be so perfect my I'll just shut up hallelujah I got a pot load of quotes that's sorry the slang I'm sorry I've got a lot of quotes amen I got a pot full of miik for you this morning there I can I can save myself I can save my phrases here I got a whole pot full of meat for you this morning hey hey man cuz it's not me now brother branham here is talking there's there's a back-channel as it were of this and I encourage you go back read these we're not trying to twist anything away from this or just pull it out because not me but it's the holy spirit the very angel of God that you see what about these days here when all these things taken place and this angel the Lord standing near I wouldn't know these things but it's the hour it's here when we get through these seven spirits the seven horns and things today if the Lord willing you'll see where it's at it's the hour that we are in that these revelations are supposed to come so we've got the right time my brother and sister we're not in another day we're not looking back we're not looking forward we're in the right time it's the Book of Revelations the revealing of Jesus Christ and we found out that the very first chapter he revealed who he was and now he's getting the seven seals revealing how he redeemed the earth now did you catch the real context of the last sentence right there he's talking past tense he's not talking future tense how he redeemed the earth that is a finished work hallelujah amen we're not waiting for some other day for this to happen it is redeemed to my brother and sister just as sure as we stand here and breathe oxygen today there will be a millennial man just asurs we are here today that thousand-year reign with Christ will lead us right into eternity with him amen because the word said it's finished amen oh now if I get excited right here you just hang on to your seat grab your seat belts right now Saints hey man I know we maybe need to talk to the trustees and whatever trustees and and uh the treasurer about putting a three-port harness on the on the seats or something but look at this amen revealing how he redeemed the earth right now that sets a very firm context God's revealing how he redeemed the earth one of them was by the name of Jesus Christ amen of the ways he's redeeming earth one of them was by the name of Jesus Christ the other was taking the fear out of the people Oh God come this morning and take every last drop of fear oh we're worried about Kovac 19:00 coronavirus I'm worrying about making a rapture hallelujah I'm not worried about what's going on the United States is bankrupt the prophet of God said they would be bankrupt look they're handing out money right now right and left my brother and sister money they can't even back up except for with a printing press you talk about prophecy coming to pass was that just a lucky shot for the Prophet no my brother's sister God revealed it was God that said this nation would be bankrupt but you understand this some people in foreign countries go yeah America is going right down the drain but you look my brother and sister the Prophet also and many other places connects every economy of every nation every people connects it in a chain all together and he said that there is one Oh China's buying us out well the prophet of God didn't say China had the money my brother and sister the prophet of God said the Catholic Church holds the wealth of the world look let's get it all in the right order hey men not only is our nation financially bankrupt it is spiritually bankrupt hallelujah all prophesied by the prophet of our day amen so what is it we come the word tells us everything we do we do in the name of Jesus Christ amen so there is a recipe you need God to come on the scene anybody need God to come on the scene you need God to come on the scene you call him in the name of Jesus Christ you know come and come some other back away some other kind of thing Oh pastor pray for me Oh pastor this Oh what about this no you come on you I'm not here my brother and sister to tell you what to believe but I'm here today to tell you you need to seek the face of God you need to ask for revelation you need to get behind that veil being on that veil you need to do that my job is just to encourage you to do that if you're waiting for me to give you something to get you in a rapture you're out of luck because I'm gonna fulfill Scripture and I'm gonna keep my vegetable oil and I'm gonna trim my lamp but God's gracious we haven't heard behold the bridegroom cometh we haven't heard that voice call that we still got time to get oil in our lamp we still got time to trim it we still got time to clean the globe that's shut you all up we need forgive me Saints I just keep running into people that are doing things did you pray about that no what kind of result did you expect if you didn't even bother to pray about I don't care if you want to own a boat a train a plane want to buy a piece of land in the country you want to build a house you want to do this you want to do I don't care about those things pray about it maybe God will let you get a blessing like you've never believed maybe you'll stop at a little old wore-out faded for sale sign and somebody come along and say we've just been waiting for a family like you oh it's not impossible I know some believers back east a brother just went and asked him about a church that was he'd heard might be up for sale this has been back a few years he goes in there in the past years a quite elderly man and this brother pastor and the message and he says now brother we heard there might be a chance you're gonna sell your church the man says tell me about what you believe and he's not ashamed he just starts in goes through it and the guys like I've heard of you I've heard of you guys I don't know that I agree with everything that you preach but I hear your godly people he said let me talk to the board of trustees and to the church because we're thinking about closing this down and going over and becoming a part of another church because we're all elderly calls him a couple weeks later says can you come see me he goes over there sits down the man's very solemn and the brother thought you know how we all kind of get that little something thought oh no the brother said well I talked to the trustee board and I talked to the church and we're not going to sell you the church we're going to give it to you but there is a catch there's still I think it was like sixty seven thousand dollars owed on the building you have to assume debt hmm we probably can't do that we couldn't accept God's blessings in such a fashion oh come on Saints when are we ever going to come to the place that we completely trust God come to the place that we just say Lord you're in control reveal to me whether I go north south east or west Lord not my idea not this person's idea not the husband not the wife not the children oh this might almost sound like heresy maybe not even the pastor you know he doesn't always get it right either last I checked he was human in fact the other day I can assure you he sheds blood but I'm looking this taking the fear out of the people we're only gonna make it halfway through here so sister and me come in that way I won't just keep going I've still got so much I look like a smorgasbord this morning I've got it piled up so deep here amen Saints would you guys do me a favor mmm we got one response that was very overwhelming I guess you won't do me a favor I'd like you to go home and ask the Lord Lord if there's fear in any shape or form controlling my life Lord will you reveal it so I can get rid of it because fear paralyzes and if we don't get rid of the fear now brother branham uses these examples this is not all-encompassing he says the other was taking the fear other people like like eternal redemption justification my faith sanctification baptisms no Holy Spirit and one that we are eternally secure taking all of the doubts out away from the people if you've got the earnest of your salvation God has already sealed you to the day of your Redemption Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed into the day of your redemption oh my brother and sister look at this now look at this amen oh now people you know there will be people that just can't fathom this now how are you going how are you going to backslide you might backslide but you can't be lost almost sounds like a contradiction doesn't it I back slid the young man I got baptized I believed God was real I believed everything about God I got to about 15 or 16 years old and I just back slid and I went away and I spent many years away even I had a wife and three children and still met hadn't made it back but my brother and sister I understand this I don't want to sound arrogant I don't want to sound bully-ish or anything like that but I understand this amen you might backslide but you can't be lost if you stay in that state it showed that you didn't have it in the beginning but if you're a child of God Oh hallelujah the worshiper once purged has no more conscious of sin says he bruised that's true so you can't you can't be a Christian you can't the Holy Ghost and run out and live in the world if you love the world in the things of the world the love of God is not in you so you're just listening to a fault sound somewhere the devil got you all pufta but if you examine your life by the Word of God and it shows you're living right down to that Bible pages then you've got eternal security and there's nothing to be fearing about what God promised God will do it hey man now you say brother Paul what about all of this well I believe when my heart says he's talking about Kovan nineteen coronavirus or whatever it is out here I don't think we have to put an exception here or exception there he said by His stripes we are healed hey man there's nothing to be fearing about what God promised God will do it I challenge oh I'm glad I can say these are the prophets words so I don't have to boastful I challenge any person to take to that you just take that and walk with that word and watch what happens to you brother it'll bring to pass everything God said so everything that God promised it'll happen hallelujah whoa I'm sorry I'm gonna quit right here because I've got some of the best yet to come oh my oh my Saints sorry about this well maybe that'll just give me a reason to preach another part but you look at this my brother and sister Oh see what God is doing and how he was doing it oh my brother and sister I just want to make this one point before I close did you know that revelation cost Abel his life now see if we don't understand it will think I'm saying that revelation killed Abel but my brother and sister revelation brought able to a place that he stood on the word by revelation and that was contrary to the spirit of the day amen and he had to this is the part I really mean by cost him his life Abel had to submit to that revelation but when that revelation was revealed he saw it and said that is the truth and he submitted himself to that and that revelation then started control his life but Abel the man while living was dead submitted to the revelation amen do you know revelation costs Apostle Paul his life now these men gave up their life literal my brother and sister but we're looking at this the Apostle Paul he was so zealous for God that he was out crucifying the Christians believing he was doing a mighty work for God but when revelation come he went to the backside of the desert and he died to himself that Christ might live through him amen and the Apostle Paul speaks pretty strong doesn't he I Paul oh go look back through the scripture I Paul he's not ashamed he stands up i Paul was called of Almighty God to bring this word to you but it cost him his life revelation it's gonna cost your life you're gonna die to yourself you got to die to your ideas you got to die to your nature amen you got to die to everything that's contrary to the word I'm still amazed Saints how people will turn and follow you know brother Branham said it's the time and age or whatever how he puts those words and almost any men can get a following well sorry the prophet of God said I don't want you following me I want you following Christ so any prophet that would be able to declare that right a powerful ministry no don't follow me follow Christ then who are we anything but to follow us follow christ follow Christ but you see the revelation of that will cost you your life you're gonna have to die to self you're gonna have to submit to the world you're gonna have to come and present yourself the living sacrifice oh you know it'd be a lot easier just to you know just just kill me get it over with come on I know this sounds crass the simpler thing my brother and sister would they to come and say look you know are you a Christian you stand for Jesus Christ yeah [Music] may not even feel not even one tickle of pain but the harder thing my sister Sharon just graduated from University it can't be easy going out in the university and being a Christian there it can't be easy going out in the workforce and being a Christian there it can't be easy being amongst family that are not believers amongst all of this around us it's not easy but if we're willing to die to ourselves then Christ will take us resurrect us right back up into the living image of his word for our day oh that's that's what takes rugged Christians amen not somebody just simply put me out of my misery and it be over it takes a rugged Christian my brother and sister to be an overcomer in the workplace when everybody wants just a little nip off of a bottle just a little look in a magazine just a little of this music just a little of this thing and just a little of this thing over here you know what's the most infectious disease on the earth today unbelief the most infectious disease I see men some of it close I'm sorry to speak this personal my own father-in-law stood up for the message for so long I don't even know how many years so many years but that infectious disease is unbelief started putting an emphasis on this and I don't understand an emphasis here I don't see I can hear in here until pretty soon Issa I don't know what to believe now we don't want to be that doing but the only way we won't be getting ovulating by the word Amen let God give you that nice big injection of faith amen let that faith course through every portion of your body where you stand on the word and you say I don't understand it man I tell you Saints I feel bad sometimes there's a pastor I read things and I'm like I don't even understand that Lord I'm sorry I just don't even but you know I'm just gonna believe what the prophet of God said and Lord this is your word and I believe it sounds pretty bad doesn't it because we think that maybe the pastor on to be really really super smart or something no Saints now have my days when I look at myself in the mirror and say God how could you have me in that office but God in His mercy allows me to go die and come back and say Lord thy will be done amen Oh hallelujah hallelujah Saints Amen you say brother Paul you should preach this happy I was trying I was trying cuz when you make the rapture when you stand on that Shore you stand in the presence Almighty God you stand before the throne if you even had any memory of it you look back and say hallelujah I'm so happy I'm so happy hallelujah I made it God in His grace amen let me die to myself amen Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh praise the Lord hallelujah amen hallelujah oh my well we're gonna just stop otherwise I'll be turning this thing into two buffets in one meal hallelujah they're just sharing with me right here that time brother Chris took sister Kristin home she's not feeling well her blood pressures been bothering her a little bit and the baby just want to lift her up and prayer for we closed Amen sister Sue's also asked to remember and amen technology isn't it something brother per Sean's sister conscious sister conscious mom sister V me definitely want to lift her up in prayer amen Satan's trying real hard my brother and sister we got you know it shared with us from living word up there brother Chris Peterson and brother Gary white and disjunction amen yeah everywhere you look Satan's attack attacking attacking that's all right prophet of God showed us clearly in the word I I dig it up for you real quick but I want to stop prophet of God showed us clearly in the word Satan's got his punch oh my brother and sister you know how I mean that make us in the flesh kind of nervous Satan's got his punch coming and you think oh okay but the Prophet God said you know what the remedy is you just keep that spot covered then leave us there thinning you know just wide open for the devil to beat on us cover that up pray read your Bible submit yourself to the will of God and Satan can't oh I love this quote here again I'll butcher it I'm sorry but the prophet of God said that amen its own way Satan we get to you is if you come out because if he goes in he would be your brother that's how powerful the Word of God is if Satan come in under the blood he'd have to be converted hallelujah let's stay under the blood says hallelujah amen be it unto me Oh feel like I didn't really make sense this morning Saints I'm sorry I'm just so excited I just wanted to run off like a racehorse around the building because this is there's just these things I look at this and it's just so real and I just keep uh uh uh oh my Oh hallelujah come on can I just one more quote one more quote hallelujah amen look God's provided way 53:12 Oh one I just got to share this can't help myself now to those that are all like part me I'm not being flippant but to all those that are goody two-shoes you never make mistakes you never have an attitude you never been troubled you never write hopefully we don't have any here yeah who is that I'm never well I have met him I have met oh yes I think they were lying to themselves but I've met him near bound to be backsliding constantly now here again look Saints don't just take this as cutoff here back you can find it easy enough read what's in front of it read what's behind it you're bound to be backsliding constantly so it takes constant prayer to God Paul said I die daily and if Paul had to die daily how much more am I going I'm going to stay dead have to stay dead all the time oh oh my yes and if Paul had to die daily to stay right with God and so we'll all have to do that just die out to yourself and that's getting God's Way now there's only two ways of anything and that's the right way in the wrong way and then ways are your ways and God's ways and you can't be in your way and God's Way at the same time amen that means my brother and sister that you can't have behavior contrary to the Word of God and say I've got hmm that's the right way wrong way then ways are your ways God's ways and you can't be in your way in God's Way at the same time you've got to forget your own way to get in God's Way and you got to get out of your own way to get in God's Way for as long as you're in your own way you're out of his way I like tongue-twisters so forsake your ways forsake your thoughts forsake everything and just rely on one thing thus saith the Lord that's all then you know you're right and though you can't see it none of the senses look at this we got way too many people going on census way way way too many people going on census then you know you're wrong though you can't see it none of the census will say it's right every one of them will say it's wrong but you know it's right because God said so that's what makes it right now that's his provided way has been his word it is his word God provided way for human to live is not by your senses it's by his word hallelujah oh my I don't feel like it I don't feel it hi this I that well hallelujah eyes are good they help spell words but my brother and sister the Bible says our heart is deceptive well my heart says Lord let me put all my feelings to
