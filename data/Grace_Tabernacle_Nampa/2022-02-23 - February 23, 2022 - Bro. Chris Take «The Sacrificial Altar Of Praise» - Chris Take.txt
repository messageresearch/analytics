amen thank you musicians it's good to be in the house with god again tonight and i bring you geek greetings from uh brother steve coffee and his church uh i relayed our greetings from our pastor so i hope that was okay took that liberty and they're all doing well over there why don't we stand tonight turn in our bibles to first peter chapter two him and uh brother steve and his wife actually have food poisoning so i remember them in your prayers they've been sick for a couple of days not every chinese or mexican restaurant is made alike i don't i don't know where they got it from yeah forgive me anyways first peter chapter two we read this last time and tonight we're going to minister part two the two altars we felt led to read the scripture again because we again bring our text from here so uh chapter two verse one first peter wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious to whom coming is unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious he also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also i it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone effect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and the stone of stumbling and the rock of offense even to them which be which stumble at the word being disobedient or until also they were appointed but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light may the lord add that blessing to the reading of his word may be seated tonight so our title uh this is the two altars part two and our title tonight is the sacrificial altar of praise now we in verse five we read that that uh we are lively stones last time we talked about building the altar of lively stones um and we're in holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices verse nine we're a chosen generation and a royal priesthood exodus chapter 30 verse 1. i have a few scriptures here to open with i didn't want to keep you standing so we have a few more here to read though exodus chapter 30 verse one now god is giving moses instructions on how to build the altar of incense and thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon of and wood shalt thou make it and cubit shall be the length thereof and a cubit the breath thereof four square shall it be two cubits shall be the height thereof the horns thereof shall be of the same and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold the top thereof and the sides that round about and the horns thereof and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about and two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it by the two corners thereof upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it with all thou shalt make the staves of shedding wood and overlay them with gold and thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony before the mercy seat that is over the testimony where i will meet with thee so it was the last altar before crossing into the holiest of holies right in front of that curt the veil and aaron shall burn there on sweet incense every morning when he dressed at the lamps he shall burn incense upon it and when there is light at the lamps at even he shall burn incense upon it so morning and night a perpetual incense before the lord throughout your generations he shall offer no strange incense thereon nor burnt sacrifice nor meat offering neither shall you pour drink offering thereon and aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations it is most holy unto the lord so once a year when aaron would go to make the um sacrifice as the high priest and bring that blood into the holiest of holies as an atonement for the sins of the people he should was also told to apply that same blood to the altar of incense and that incense was to be kept burning and there's even other scriptures where it says the the people shouldn't mimic this incense because the lord lays it out what ingredients to use for that incense and um he says the people shouldn't take it therefore and make it their own thing to make them smell good because that would be in mockery of what god has said as holy so um this incense was was called to to be burning both day and night psalms 141 verse 2. psalms 14 1 verse 2. let my prayer be set before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice revelations 5 verse 8 and we'll seal the deal um on the what this incense is spiritually today revelation chapter 5 verse 8. and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints but the brown says in the fifth seal 1963. now the instance was the odors odorous stuff that they burnt which the bible said was the prayers of the saints if there isn't no sacrifice now watch he said so he says this this incense this burning incidence is the prayers of the saints what does paul say uh pray for be continually in prayer pray and cease not something along those lines basically the summary be in prayer continually so this is the prayer of the saints morning and night and he says now he says if there is isn't no sacrifice on the altar then the prayers cannot be received it's only by the blood on the sacrificial altar that lets the prayers go through to god in the seven church ages 1950 or he's 54 he says has made us priests did you ever know what a priest is what his office is a priest is to make sacrifice to make intercession over in hebrews it said that we the church is the royal priesthood he says hebrews he means first peter a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people see a holy nation peculiar people royal priesthood offering here it is now offering spiritual sacrifices every man and woman that comes to to god enters into the veil so now we have we have this position and and i wanted to lay this out and then and then call to remember it's the first song i placed you high above as a high priest then he's saying then jason's saying cast all my cares and he has forgiven me and i thought that was just beautiful um so so god christ is the high priest of our profession and we are a royal priesthood we are called to be kings and priests of the most high god and so now christ is our high priest who's made continual intercessions and but that one sacrifice he made has covered us for good by his blood so his blood is continually upon that but we have a position we have to play so the beautiful tabernacle in the wilderness was set forth you can read it in exodus and and then the um i think exodus covers how it was built and starts to be put into use in numbers and leviticus you start to see this this uh portrayal this type come forth and now that that tabernacle as glorious and beautiful as it was with the gold and and the in the the fine incense and and all this all these things didn't do no good sitting there aaron and the in his sons and the levites had to put it to use there was no saving power in those altars unless aaron took a a bullock or a lamb or whatever the sacrifice was and slayed it upon the altar and burned it with fire and then went on to do the rest of the things it did them no good just sitting there and it takes faith and revelation to do so aaron had you say well it was easy aaron just had to walk up and but it wasn't especially after his two sons got slain right it was a serious deal and so it wasn't just aaron had to have faith that what he was doing was going that god was going to answer to that otherwise he would be like what's the point why do this the levites had to have a revelation so we as priests have to have a revelation that if we go and we sacrifice we offer our spiritual sacrifice that god is going to answer in kaa in turn as our high priest without that revelation without that faith you're never going to take those steps forward to offer a sacrifice and remember a title tonight is the sacrificial altar of praise and so sometimes when we say praise and worship we automatically think of singing and clapping and raising our hands but that's for me that's the just the tip of the iceberg praise and worship comes when we offer our self as a sacrifice isaac was a type of christ abraham and we talked about this last time abraham offered isaac on the altar isaac was the type of christ not and you know he carried the wood jesus carried the cross up to the to the sacrifice and and and god provided the lamb where christ was our provided lamb but in doing so god even in that christ even in that gave us a a a a type or um an example that we ourselves should lay down upon the altar that we have built of lively stones that we have built not by stone tune with tools that would pollute it but built of natural live stones on revelation see revelation gives you the faith to build this altar or faith gives you the revelation right they go hand in hand give do you have this altar but now unless you put that altar to use it does you no good but it takes faith abraham had to have faith when he built that altar that god was going to provide a lamb in order for him to surrender isaac upon it you say well he didn't kill isaac he didn't kill him in the in a physical act but in his mind he was doing it in his heart he was doing it and so we have to lay ourselves down as a sacrifice and in in so doing we bring our lord praise and worship praise and worship so remember that the altar does no good unless you put it to use elijah built that altar uh you know he took the 12 stones and we repaired the altar of the lord justification then he bathed it in water three times sanctification but it takes the holy spirit the fire from god upon that altar but first elijah had to ask for it elijah had to do something to put that altar to use if he would have turned and walked away nothing would have happened so we read here in exodus about the altar of incense and instances is uh the prayers of type of the prayers of the saints going up burning every morning and evening and then we should be in prayer continually as as christians as followers of christ and and these these prayers going up mingled with this incense and i don't know if we read that scripture i had so many scriptures not all of them i put in um the sermon but it's it's in revelations um is it chapter eight it is chapter eight i think okay chapter eight verse three thank you brother david and that um and another angel came revelation chapter eight verse three another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which which was before the throne i can't believe i forgot to put this one in and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angels hands so this this incense mingles with the prayers of the saints and is a sweet odor to in the savior's uh for the savior um so praise the lord my spot back here so this is what this this instance is does not i kind of want to bring a couple of things and then we'll we'll we'll move forward with this numbers chapter 16. we pick up the story of korra and and um well we're a little bit past the story of coracore and and those people that some of those levites that he got together had already been swallowed up and now um numbers chapter 16 now the word of the lord comes and and the lord says moses separates yourself i'm going to start over it's just going to be you pretty much 16 verse 44. and the lord's speaking to moses saying get you up from among this congregation then i may consume them as in a moment and they fell upon their faces now i want to i want to show you the grace of god and how much he appreciates that altar of incense and those prayers going up and these we have two examples here first with this one gets you from among the congregation that i may consume them as a in a moment and they fell upon their faces so the people must have heard and moses said unto aaron take a censer so moses is like aaron quick grab a sensor put fire on it from the altar go quickly into the congregation and make an atonement for them for there is a wrath god out from the lord the plague has begun so moses catches what what god's doing and brother bannon preaches about this and standing in the gap and aaron took as moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed now they that died in the plague were 14 700 besides him that died upon the matter of korra so you're looking at upwards of 15 000 people in one day and aaron returned to moses under the alt under the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the plague was stayed so that aaron the moses says the word of the prophet says aaron grab the the coal from the altar this is the altar that they sacrificed for the atonement grab that fire why couldn't have aaron grabbed the closest cook fire because it's not the fire god it's not the sanctified fire see you can't just grab any old fire you want it's got to be the fire off of the altar the altar that is your atonement it's got to be the fire of god so aaron grabs the fire from the altar lights the incense and begins to burn the incidents as an atonement and it goes up as a sweet smelling savor and god stops the plague the the wrath of god of the lord is turned aside it was an atonement um and and it says between stood between the dead and the living can we just testify tonight that our prayers are going up to stand between the dead and the living for our sister laura amen we're believing that god will come and answer the prayer and in any situation that you go through your prayers stand between the dead and the living amen so um praise the lord brother branham says in standing in the gap 1963. i try to condense this quote down just bear with me here of this time we're speaking of or reading of course we all under all understand that it was when dathan and core had decided that they would interfere with the commission that god had given to moses they decided moses's altar was too rough looking and they wanted to hew some stones out saying you ought to let the whole congregation do such and such they're all holy and god had commanded moses see that brother branham had the same issue when he was in south africa and he was trying to say we need to go back to i think it was durbin we need to go back and have meetings there and they stood against him like korra and nathan and and he ended up paying for it so it's the will of god using the man moses and these these brothers here started to talk among themselves about what they disagreed with in the man they started to look upon the man and when they got their eyes off god and on the man they said this guy has this he takes too much upon himself and moses responds in like terms and he says you levites take too much upon yourself and and then god he they get the incense together on the golden spoons and god swallows them up but he said the man goes on to say they're all holy and god had commanded moses to lead the people to the promised land and they said you take it upon yourself to do too much you try to make yourself the only one in the bunch that that's got any say so and this displeased god so much until he told moses separate yourself from among them i'll just kill the whole bunch and start a new generation with you now this was god's word this was the saith the lord kill the whole bunch and start a new generation with you and moses fell in the presence of god and said he'd have to come over him now today if god was going to i thought this was funny liquidate the people there was a time that when god had gotten tired of fooling with our sin we constantly going wrong who would stand like moses today for the people where would we find a person that would stand or could stand that god would accept like he did moses and moses's own life on earth meant so much to god till he stayed the wrath of god and god would not cross over moses that always was a puzzle to me till one day in revelation of the scripture there came this thought to me that you see moses in that act was every way substituting he was a type of jesus christ so now you have you have jesus christ standing in the gap and the incense upon the altar and it is with this it was it was it was with this prayer with this incense moses standing in the gap that the wrath of god was stayed that was does say the lord i'm going to kill the people moses separate yourself but that word was turned when moses stood in the gap and aaron took the incense into the tabernacle and as with all things in this tabernacle both under the law under the law and spiritually fire is needed for everything you cannot sacrifice without fire you can't light the candlestick without fire you can't bake the show bread without fire you can't burn the incense without fire you can't go into the holiest of holies without the blood from the sacrifice you used with fire so it's all based upon fire to burn sacrifice fire to burn incense it's all the fire of god a type of the holy spirit you have to have the holy spirit to access any of this brother brown says in the prayer line he says god will you accept christ as you're saving right now god will heal you right you have to accept christ you have to have get the holy spirit so another example here in in and uh did i put the scripture in okay i'll skip i'll go forward then we're going to jump back second kings chapter 20 i wasn't entirely sure how to put this these notes in order but we'll just the lord's gonna order it on the fly second kings chapter 20. remember the sweet odor the incense of prayer the sac the the altar of sacrificial praise ex second kings chapter 20. 1 and in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet isaiah the son of amos came to him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying i beseech thee o lord remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore and it came to pass after isaiah was gone out of the middle court at the word of the lord god out into the middle court the word of the lord came to him saying turn again and tell hezekiah the captain my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord and i will add unto thy days 15 years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city for mine own sake for my servant david's sig if you go and read the story of hezekiah his his reign was plagued with problems he had to give he was given all the gold off the temple to the kings so he just had trouble after trouble of trouble so god says hey i'm going to defend this city for my own sake for for the king for my servant david's sake and deliver you out of the hand of the king of assyria and isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took it and laid it on the boil and he recovered and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the lord will heal me and that i shall go up into the house of the lord the third day so then isaiah gives him a sign and moving time back so here we have hezekiah given the word of the lord and israel in the church 1953 brother says look at old isaiah it goes up and tells the prophet hezekiah set your house in order you're going to die thus saith the lord what an embarrassment it was in a couple hours to turn back again the holy spirit met him because hezekiah turned his face to the wall and wept bitterly and said lord i beseech you to consider me i've walked before you with a perfect heart and tears run down his cheeks his cheek and god had already sealed his dune but prayer changed things hezekiah ran to the altar of incense and began to offer an atonement for the what the word of the lord given saying lord i have served you i have done walked before you please spare my life and though thus saith the lord the word was changed because of the sweet incense that hezekiah all offered upon the altar in his prayers prayer changes things amen hezekiah's prayer prayers were a sweet incense upon his altar now there's a thing there's the paradox of being a serving god and that is that in our weakness god strength is made known they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength it's it's it's it's opposite of what the world says the world says be strong be for yourself don't depend on anybody do it yourself but god says fully depend upon me in your weakness i am made strong he calls the weak and the disabled to fulfill his will what happens is when we get to a place where we think we're strong second chronicles 26 16 but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for he transgressed against the lord his god and went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense uzziah uzziah became started at 16 years old became a mighty king with great inventions that nobody else had and he got lifted up until he was strong and he said you know what i'm going to go and i'm going to burn incense and azariah the high priest which means jehovah has helped stands in the way with 250 but when it says mighty men levites stands in them and says don't do it jehovah helped right there jehovah stopped him but azerite in his pride see when we get strong we get proud and we get lifted up and then god can't use us and while he's standing there in his rage leprosy eats he gets eaten up with leprosy and he's a leper for the rest of his life but a side note a fascinating and just powerful testimony his son begins to reign at a young age as well uzziah in his leper state in his condition i believe had still had the ability to i'm sure he talked with his son his son grew up to be a mighty man of valor and run his run the kingdom exactly how god would have liked it and his heart was towards the lord so even though his dad was in transgression and all these things happened to him from that came a king whose heart was tied into christ so uzziah's own strength brought his destruction it is in our strength we find defeat but in the power of christ excuse me but the power of christ is made perfect by our weakness so in our own strength we find destruction but in the strength of the lord we find victory amen what is what follows surrender we said last time victory victory always follows surrender in other words get weak get weak lay yourself down he say you say spiritually speaking there's a there's a battle coming there's a battle coming all right let's go that's right that's exactly right that's what you have to do you just got to lay down i preached a message one time giving up the battle he said hold on a second let's back up you see sometimes i mean anyways praise the lord you gotta just be weak so god can use you because then he comes along you're laying there you've laid down to fight the battle you say okay lord then he comes along and he picks you up and he draws your sword and he begins to fight amen fully and totally surrendered to christ is where we find complete victory amen so uzi got caught up in his own strength but if he would have remembered you know um nebuchadnezzar got lifted up in his own strength and god humbled him ii corinthians 12 9 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me in other words be excited about your weakness thank the lord for your weakness because that's where the power of christ will find its glory amen to rest upon you our weakness upon the altar we sacrifice the sacrificial altar of praise we lay our weaknesses upon this altar to bring on the strength of the lord you're lacking joy in your life guess what joy is found in the strength of the lord the joy of excuse me the joy of the lord is our strength you don't have joy in your life because you're trying to do it our strength up yes i just i'm just recapping my notes our strength upon the altar brings destruction but his strength amen brings victory now you say uh the two walters that that's that's that's the what we're talking about so we have the we bringing out those prayers of the incense and and uh uh the prayers is the is the incense upon the altar and i was torn between what to title this um but the lord just i just was praying and the lord just brought inspiration and tied this all together as only he can do so if you go in the scripture and you read through hebrews and you read about uh where well in well pretty much the book of hebrews right paul is laying out the the uh the order of the law versus the order of grace um and so we have we have the altars underneath the order of aaron we have the altered sacrificial altar we have the altar of incense and all of these things that's so the altar of incense is what we're going to take that's we have the altar underneath the law and we have the altar underneath the order of melchizedek the order alters under the order of the law with aaron as high priest and the altars under the order of the word of the oath or melchizedek with christ as the high priest psalms 110 verse 4 the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek hebrews chapter 7 hebrews chapter 7 verse 17. for he testifieth thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek for there is verily a disannuling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect so here's where we're bringing this parallels but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god and in as much as not without an oath he was made priest for those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that sent unto him the lord's swear and will not repent thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death so there was there was high priest after high priest priest after priest because of death but this man because he continued with ever eternally half an unchangeable priesthood our god cannot and will not change he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so there you know in in the programming world we have something that's called a hook if there's a process that happens we can hook into that process and trigger other things based on what happens there it's an anchor this this scripture here is is our anchor that he is the unchangeable priesthood so therefore tying that with jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever if he did in the tabernacle in the wilderness it's gonna happen the same today in your life if you alter your prayers upon the altar of incense you will get an answer from god no question to ask because if he did it then he has to do it today amen praise the lord an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them i mean what brother had that vision he steps behind the door after seeing the police officer and that woman and he says why don't you burn them all and he and he's he's pushed into a vision and he sees the earth covered with blood and his sins along with everyone else is going up and hitting the blood christ making intercessions for the saints without our high priest we have you see we now under the dispensation of grace can go into the holiest of holies with christ to receive the seed of christ but without without the high priest you can't you need that blood you need that atonement but see he did it one time and that covers it for good for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled no wonder the high priests were so outraged with jesus because he became as one of the people what what do you what what where is how do i say this where do you start to see the people fail when the priests the pastors the preachers begin to lift themselves up into a position they don't belong when it should be this then that's because the sin the focus goes off of christ and everybody is still responsible for their own souls but that's where people get stumbled so it's when we we take it and you say oh well i'm going to be the high priest once again what's going to what's going to follow that sin uzziah did it he picked up all the the incense to do as the priest the high priest and he was covered in leprosy sin what happens when people take god's word in their own hand to bring their own interpretation sin is going to follow that for such a high priest become us who was holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer of sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself for the law maketh men i love the scripture for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity the law maketh men high priests we're not called to be high priests kings and priests but not high priest that's christ's position the law maketh men high priests now today under under grace to to go under law is to go under man because what what whenever god steps and i'm getting into part three whenever god steps out is is forced out what follows let's just for example say use a pastor what follows control law can do no good what how does paul say with the law there is sin but with grit you don't understand what i'm saying i can't remember the scripture so when god when god is pushed out but how does god get pushed out when there are holy ghost-filled people something doesn't line up with the word so then god is pushed out and now you have control and me and my wife were talking about this situation that we know of an interesting thing is that a lot of the the women in the church have a dominating spirit and i said what happened the the pastor stepped out of the word of god into a control even though as a man underneath the dominating female spirit now that control transfers into even though it's preached against into the women in the church and they begin to have that dominating spirit brother barum says look at the women in the church that's hard and gun barrel straight but that's the word of god so that's what happens when it's the law because these men have infirmity remember if we can say look you guys know me well enough to know i'm a man and i have infirmity but i don't try to we say we put that in under god's grace and we say lord you have control you use this man for your your bidding um but the word of the oath i i like that the word of the oath which was that and that what he's saying is he's bringing up psalms 110 verse 4 the lord hath sworn and will not repent that's the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated forever more which was so in other words the word of the oath was already in place when they had the law underneath david david says in psalms 110 verse 4 under inspiration of the holy spirit he says the lord hath sworn speaking of christ to come and will not repent that thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek what is melchizedek no father no mother no beginning no ending of days amen it's it's that eternal uh that eternal lineage from that priesthood in other words the priesthood of eternal the eternal priesthood where we are now a part of that you have eternal life as being part of this this royal priesthood amen that promise was already in place when israel was under the law praise the lord but that oath maketh the son the capital s who is consecrated forevermore amen praise the lord perfected perfected forevermore and you being part of the priesthood in him are now perfected forevermore brother branham says you have to be perfect to enter the kingdom of god because your perfection is found in christ amen back back to foundation the statue of a perfect man amen we're building up with lively stones into the statue of the perfect man the stature of christ so that when he comes what is he coming for an overcoming bride and the only way you can be an overcoming bride is if your life is built upon this altar amen underneath the order of melchizedek praise so this tabernacle and now spiritual tabernacle today brandon had the vision of the tent and i'll meet you in there amen you go in there go into there and put those altars to use and god will give you his seed and make you mrs jesus christ amen praise the lord you see we are the most blessed people of the ages because we today have the whole thing we have christ as our high priest and our husband you got a request is it hard sisters is it hard to make your request of your wife if excuse me your husband if he's a good man is it hard to make your request of him you just give him that little smile and you know next thing you know we don't have to he's our high priest but he's approachable as our husband he's making intercessions for the saints and he is our husband amen praise the lord so we have been made kings and priests and that's revelations you can turn after one turn there if you want revelations chapter one verse five to six oh i i put it in my sermon and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins and his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever saints of god that's how john christ opens the book of revelation you are kings and priests that is the introduction to the book of revelation what does the devil hate so much revelation how do you how do you become a king and a priest by revelation how do you become how do you get praise the lord because as a kingdom priest now you're you're you're you're using the sacrificial altar of praise it takes revelation to worship god amen what what you see you go to any denominational church you want i mean you find the holiest you want they're worshiping but they're not worshiping god there's no revelation revelation is what brings true worship let the worshipers arise right father i see that you were drawing he's drawn a light in the sand saints of god amen we want to be standing on the right side of that faith is the substance 1951 but the battle says our bodies are groaning and you ever find those quotes brother or pastor and brother david probably can testify where it's just brother bottom has stutters and things but you find these quotes sometimes that are just smooth and just packed and this is one of those quotes our bodies are groaning and we have an inheritance and we're children now heirs of the kingdom oh my kings and priests unto god offering spiritual sacrifices what does a priest do make a sacrifice what is a spiritual sacrifice that's what these sons and daughters do which are kings and priests yet not in full possession but they're making sacrifices offering to god spiritual sacrifices the fruits of our lips giving praise to him fruits of our lips you say brother branham i just don't feel like praising him he said you've got to bring every sermon down to where the rubber meets the road i don't feel like praising him that's the time to make the sacrifice you see saying to god everybody can do it when it's sunshine and roses but everybody can do it when it's snowfall and ice sacrifice he says that's the time to make the sacrifice praise him anyhow there's that song for the jeremy shriner sings it the best i think well i just i don't want to disregard anybody who's saying that i appreciate hearing him sing that song i'll praise you in the storm i'll praise you in the storm amen that is oh that saints i'll forget i was listening to a tape or talking to somebody but that's the crazy thing about being a christian is when you do stuff like that praise him in the storm people look at you like you lost your mind you say you're right i have i gave it up for a higher calling the mind of christ amen kings and priests sons and daughters offering spiritual sacrifice you see the priests the every day morning and night the incense had to be burned there was no days off sense of god we don't get a day off we do not get a day off that's why that's why when you start doing it by your own strength you're going to fall on your face because you'll never find the strength of the lord when you're using your strength to carry on because it is a battle we are in a battle and and if you try to do it on your own for example skip devotions amen you're not going to make it through praise him anyhow kings and priests sons and daughters offering spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving praise unto his name amen amen praise the lord your kings and priests call to sacrifice to give praise and worship the the the levites were continually in the house of god offering praise and worship he said well we only come to church twice a week can we go back to second peter a spiritual house built unto the lord you are now the house of god and if you're not going every morning and every night continually offering praise and worship in your tabernacle a tabernacle given for what god to dwell in for god to dwell in in the darkness he gives you light by the pillar of fire when things are light and going good he gives you this pillar of smoke to follow god leading his church amen the bride coming of christ brother branham says go look up that quote but when you look at the quote listen to brother benjamin say because a comment was put in there that doesn't belong the bride coming of christ that's where we are today saints of god how is that how is that possible because we are now under the order of melchizedek not the order of the law there's two altars the author of instance under the law the altar of instance under grace the order of melchizedek what does the what does the does the altar of the law over here bring you eternal life no not at all it's a shadow you see if you focus on the shadow of a chicken you're gonna eat anything you're gonna get nothing you look at the shadow of an eagle passing around wow look at that shadow now everyone looks up to see where it came from the shadow of things to come a better testament a better testament that just ruffled the feathers of the priests you don't need us anymore uh so they were saying when jesus was there they knew right because they had turned into a man-made thing but under the order of mckellar the order of melchizedek you're called to put to use the sacrificial altar of praise it is your commandment it is the saith the lord you are called to continually bring to the altar a sacrificed life because guess what the shadow of the things that come christ is our atonement and he's the he was the eternal sacrifice but you still have to continually sacrifice the flesh do any of you have the theophany yet something you like to think you do the way you dress up nothing wrong with looking nice you don't until you do every day you got to take this lord burn it but what what what did the priests take from the burnt they put that that hook in there and they pulled out see where where do you get your sustenance when you lay your flesh down on the altar then you can get fed but while you're keeping that flesh in the way you're reading this book like a newspaper you want this book maybe you haven't caught what it is we talk about what it is we preach about maybe there's a confusion you want this book what does what does john say the book of revelations the book that opens with you are kings and priests he says john is told eat the book eat the book you have to partake of the book of life amen last time we talked about how jacob rolled the stone off of the well for rachel his future bride and then jesus met the woman at the well and he spiritually rolled the stone away at jacob's well for her to receive the living waters and then every day you have to say because you're not strong enough you don't have the ability to move that stone sometimes things in life cause that stone to move back over the well of living water and we have to say lord my flesh got in the way and the lid shut can you please push it back that stone and bring forth amen the living water the la the of the ever living everlasting water the water of life amen which is himself you see he will come in your time of need and open himself up to you because the living water opens the lid to the living water because it's all things in christ sense of god what god wants us to do is he wants us with all his heart to be that bride that is overcoming but we cannot do it unless we lay ourselves down on the sacrificial altar of praise and when you do so amen you take that blood that blood from that altar and it sprinkles upon the altar of incense and god takes that those prayers as an atonement amen for your victory when you fully surrender and lay yourself that's when you find victory amen you can also go and stand in the gap for your loved ones with those prayers or there's a need our sister laura whatever it is you stand in the gap with those intercept with those prayers that go up as a sweet incense praise the lord musicians want to come we'll close here i mean that sweet incense before the lord in other words you put a nice you put a nice handle on or something that instance to fill the house it smells so good just brings a nice that's how your prayers are to god they're that same effect you know maybe the wife cooked with garlic and onions and the house just stinks put on a candle right sometimes our house starts to stink what what what does brother brandon say you could never pray too much and that instance was a continual burning through generations so you could never pray too much in other words you can never get yourself smelling too good in the presence of god because he loves to in your house that's what i was saying your house starts to stink your spiritual house starts to stink it's time to get down and do some praying to burn some incense upon that altar amen that god can then come amen praise the lord's power heads heavenly father lord jesus we thank you for your word tonight lord lord even now in our prayer lord jesus we lift up lord and we know with confidence because your word doesn't lie that our prayers even now as we're speaking are going up as a sweet incense mingling with that smoke off the altar oh god forgive us lord jesus if there's anything hindering that lord father sometimes our altars get a little dusty and we need to clean them off lord sometimes the the fire burns a little bit too low we need to get another coal or another coal with isaiah lord you brought the coal down and anointed his lips we asked god you would bring that coal of fire down and cleanse us tonight lord jesus we always need it father every morning every night this flesh rises up father but again tonight i pray with my brothers and sisters here tonight lord we lay ourselves down again upon the sacrificial altar we ask you to take our lives lord jesus do your bidding
