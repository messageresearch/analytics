amen hey man once again i want to welcome you this morning my lord jesus christ just a couple of announcements on august 7th we're going to have a work be here at the church there's a lot of stuff outside that needs to be cleaned up and trimmed and fixed so august 7th we're going to be doing that probably around 8 o'clock so brothers sisters it doesn't matter if you don't mind being outside in the heat a little bit and handling a shovel and a rake we can use your help brother isaac's going to be the main contact person for that so you can reach out to him if you have any questions with regards to that so it's going to be august 7th at 8 o'clock which is a saturday and also i want to make announcements yes yes i am if you sleep in a little and come at 8 pm nobody will be here we don't plan it to be a bit a long day maybe a half a day if if that just to get where we want to be so uh also i just want to make i was thinking about this brother trevor was praying with regards to uh specials they've dried up and i don't know why so i wanna i i sometimes we need clarification on a special it doesn't need to be mozart's fifth symphony um if you've been blessed by a course we sing in church and it's helped you through a trial and you want to share it you can sing a course or sing in church it doesn't have to be unique it doesn't have to be you somebody it can be something you've written or whatever um i want to encourage you we don't need the same two people to always sing specials i'd like to hear from our congolese if it's in french sing it in french it doesn't matter if that's ukrainian russian it doesn't matter if it's been a blessing to you it'll be a blessing to us so i just want to encourage those who can't sing and can sing to sing it doesn't matter so anyways i just want to put that out to you it does like i said we have talented musicians sarah ruth my wife sean chris if you need accompaniment they'll be more than willing to help you struggle through your song and we're family i've been in front of five people i've been in front of 900 people it's always the same you're still nervous so it doesn't matter but anyways i want to encourage you if if there's been something on your heart maybe the lord has just helped you through a trial and gave you a song and you want to share it feel free to come share it we'd be we'd be loved to be blessed by you amen let's sing number 723 as we get ready to receive our pastor leaning on his everlasting arms amen what a fellowship wanna [Music] my the everlasting arms yes i'm leading [Music] oh i'm safe and secure from all along well i'm reading yes i'm cleaning o meaning on the everlasting one how sweet you are in this pilgrim way i'm feeding on everlasting arse oh how bright the path grows from day to day feeding on the everlasting god well i'm leaning leaning [Music] foreign on everlasting on what have i done and what have i defeated feeding on everlasting [Music] [Music] [Music] oh i'm leaning [Music] they [Music] amen no better place to lean than on the everlasting arms of our lord jesus amen good to be in the house of the lord today brother bob's sister joanne what a pleasure to see you once again amen each and every one of you amen um i feel bad brother brother manasseh i just all summer i'm just like i want to go do dinner with brother manasseh and then i come home and i sit down in the chair and the lights go out and uh so it's i i'm sorry about that this is my intention amen sister sophie i sent you a birthday greeting i don't think you got it because my phone says you have the wrong number so i don't know you've changed numbers okay that's my smartphone and uh so anyway happy birthday amen i usually try to just do those on a personal basis but um anyway god bless you happy birthday today and uh you know i just want to before we go on share a little card here a thank you card a beautiful little card from our young people um just thanking the church for sending them or helping them go to camp and uh i believe it was a real blessing to each one of them as we have heard their testimonies and uh just as they share what uh god has done for them and um so i tell you i there some of you weren't able to go to camp this year i don't know exactly school stretched out but young people i just encourage you even you know brother manasseh you're still young people and um just if you want to go to camp uh i know they do have some age guidelines and things like that but don't put it on a shelf as though it probably can't happen okay i want you to pray about it and i want you to claim it and i believe it's a good experience if there's nothing else you get to go see that there are other young people on the face of this earth who love the lord and want to serve the lord and i i believe it's encouraging so we'll hang this up on the bulletin board just to thank you uh from our campers amen and uh so i i can i share just something a bit of humor just before we start in the service today so i thought it was interesting that brother jason brings up about singing specials because jerry and i are standing in front of the vanity getting ready for church just this morning and i i told jerry i said it's a shame that we're going to have to do like they're trying to do for the covet vaccinations and we have to make an announcement now to those of you who sing a special we have like a free pizza for you um we have you know something good for you hear a gift card uh um i told sister jerry i said maybe we can offer them uh dinner with the pastor and then we stopped and thought about that and thought now that probably not a good idea because that would just dampen it but anyway it's just funny that that was on our heart this morning too amen so i just asked you as brother jason has asked you pray about it do it from the heart because i'd sure hate we have to resort to giving out pizzas so anyway god bless you this morning amen um and uh truly i mean that to each and every one of you just a lovely day um you know well i won't go into all those details but uh god is good i'll just i'll just sum it up god is good amen let's just stand i want to go into um uh finding the mercy seat and uh this will be kind of a a series a little bit of a series here you know a few services this has been the mercy seat's been on my heart for quite a while and maybe i am too transparent but the reason this has been on my heart was some comments that was made to me by an individual uh that um they didn't believe that i had it correct when i was speaking or sharing that christ is present with us and their understanding of the message if he is present with us he had to leave the mercy seat so to them they don't believe he is here in our midst because if he's left the mercy seat it's all finished but you see sometimes saints and i don't point this as a dagger towards this individual but sometimes people are taught in such a fashion that it's placed before them and they've heard it preached that way for so long that they can't see it any other way now we're not going to get into who has revelation and who doesn't know who is the bride who isn't we're we're not there this is not what it's about right it's not for us to to determine that that's between them and the lord but i just felt this burden on my heart for quite a while since this conversation that i had for us to just look at what the scripture shows us clearly and what the prophet of god says about it that we would not have any misconceptions about the mercy amen and so um this will be a part of a series and i i put this little disclaimer on this today that probably where i end up today you might look at that and say now brother paul missed it but you see this is a series and we series always has to come to a conclusion okay so we move from uh point a to to point uh x y z whatever we end up at there will be our final conclusion as to what uh we're looking at so i just want to say that so that you would understand today let's go to the book of exodus the 25th chapter now this is quite a lengthy scripture so we'll read a portion of it and let you be seated and and then we'll go on because right here in exodus um in god dealing with moses uh laying out the foundation of the mercy seat and now saints we have to understand that the mercy seat didn't just start in the wilderness for a tabernacle the mercy seat has always existed and god has chose by revelation to through the ages bring the mercy seat into our revision so it's not that it's just was for prophets it's not that it was just old testament but it is and now we see and and i'll just go ahead and preach this instead of explaining myself and re-preaching it exodus the 25th chapter starting with verse 1. and the lord spake unto moses so this is not moses idea speak unto the children of israel that's the whole congregation is anyone here this morning amen then they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering and this is the offering which he shall take of them gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goat's hair and rams skins dyed red and badger skins amen i get to go there amen and and wood and oil for the light and spices for the anointing oil and for sweet incense once stones and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them that is one of our hearts desires that we would be a sanctuary that he would dwell amongst us heavenly father we just ask you lord this morning father just take our thoughts our words lord commit them to your thoughts and your words father ask you lord that this would be a blessing to someone encourage someone father give us wisdom give us revelation we ask in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated so as we go on here verse 9 he says according to all that i show thee so it's not something my brother and sister that someone set down as it were by a committee or uh by a a a a you know some other plan after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall he make it and they shall make an ark of and wood and two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half breath thereof and a cubit and a half the height thereof and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold and within and without shall thou overlay it and shall make upon it a crown of gold round about and thou shall cast four rings of gold for it and put them in the four corners thereof and two rings shall be in the one side of it and two rings on the other side of it and thou shall make staves of him wood and overlay them with gold and thou shall put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark that the ark may be born of them now my brother and sister you will find that this carries on just to make a note for you you'll find that this carries on that back when david desired to move the ark and it was not god's will that those men sincere men else they stumbled and the ox and the cart shook a man reached out and touched the ark and he died you see the ark was not to be manhandled this is why these two staves of wood were put through the two rings and it was not to be just carried in any haphazard way but it was to be carried over the left shoulder which was over the heart and so we see lots of types and shadows in the word of god that shows us that the word of god even in the day that we live in is not to be carried as it were in any haphazard manner but it must be carried there in relationship to the heart and if it's carried in any other fashion it will not result in a good result in fact it would cost one his life amen this dave shall be in the rings of the ark they shall not be taken from it thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which i shall give thee do we have a testimony this morning amen where do we carry that testimony i pray it's a testimony that's carried in the heart not just of a mental conception not just of i joined a church or i i started to study this and i understand it now those things won't work my brother and sister pure intellectual will be able to put the abcs of the gospel together but it will never make it real and alive in the heart of the people amen and thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breath thereof thou shall make two cherubims of gold of beaten work shall thou make them in the two ends of the mercy seat now my brother and sister these two cherubims were not just something that was set down upon the mercy seat they were an integral part of the mercy seat so you have a mercy seat but the mercy seat is not complete without these two cherubims and make one cherub on the one end and the other chair on the other end even of the mercy seat shall ye make the chairman's on the two ends thereof and the cherub themselves stretch forth their wings on high covering the mercy seat with their wings their faces shall look one to another toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubians be and now shall put the mercy seat above upon the ark and the ark thou shall put the testimony that i shall give thee and there i will meet thee now remember brother branham has preached to us laid out a message to us and showed us that god has a provided way of worship we we don't just come haphazardly we don't come now don't judge somebody or be harsh on them because they might use the human words and say i feel right that's just sometimes just vocabulary if we're talking about how that we are going to act upon the word of god and we start saying i feel we need to be careful my brother and sister we are uh uh emotional beings right uh even uh a person who doesn't display much emotion has emotion because there is something stirring on the inside and and so you see that it's there as we'll look at this uh we're putting the mercy seat uh upon the ark and the ark shall be put the testimony that i shall give thee and my brother and sister i'm telling you if your testimony doesn't move you how do you expect it to move anyone else we might as well be mute people are like yeah it was on this day god dealt with me and i repented i got baptized and yeah i was pretty sure it was in this meeting over here with this brother i got the holy ghost and i've been trying to serve god ever since i have a farm well they're about unequal neither one will get us in a rapture a cold formal relationship with god or a farm neither one will get us in a rapture there should be something in the depths of our heart that when we think about what god has done for us come on can we do that this morning when we think about what god has done for us there should be something in the depths of our heart that stirs us something that we can stop and say thank you lord thank you for what you've done for me lord i i know about predestination and i know about the book of life the lamb's book of life before the foundation i know all of that but lord as a human you made me with emotion and something stirring inside of me that i say thank you lord otherwise we come under the traditions of men and we become cold and we become formal and we just put our name as it were on a book but we have no book to put it on so we even have less and nothing stirs us holy spirit can come down and move through the church and we just fiddle around we write notes and we do all kinds of nonsense in the house of god because nothing is stirring us i pray to god that each and every one of you that hears my voice this morning would be able to stop and say lord let there be something in my life that you stir something that changes me something that's moving me and i'm not talking about just walking out oh i just felt it no my brother and sister i'm talking about something deep down in the soul that's stirring you hallelujah and when we can come to that place then we know for sure that god is moving in our midst and there see it's when the mercy seat is now above the ark he says and there i will meet thee and i will commune with thee you see this is not just i came to church on whatever today is the 25th check mark he says it's when you have the mercy seat over the ark there's where i come in and i commune with you who wants to commune with god this morning i say from the depths of my heart lord speak to me speak to me lord and i want to be faithful and i want to be quick to speak back to you lord and i will commune with you from above the mercy seat from between the cherubims where it's upon the ark of the testimony of all things which i will give thee in commandment unto the children of israel you know as i read that scripture it strikes me here's the very foundation or this is where we would find the starting as it were of scripture concerning the mercy seat now in those verses right there we saw that god was giving to moses the pattern of the physical tabernacle talking about how i want this i want there to be an outer court an inner court and the most holiest of holies talking about these avenues or these places of sanctification justification sanctification and the infilling or receiving of the holy ghost which would be the holiest of holies and how we see these patterns my brother and sister and they are the pattern for the physical tabernacle now we look here and and one of these quotes i added i don't remember uh it must be this one uh that i didn't give to brother alex i was just going to paraphrase it but i will read it to you amen in events made clear by prophecy brother branham says here paragraph 134 in the solomoness of this hour let us say this god our father our flesh is a poor tabernacle for you is this not true but lord let your sanctifying grace your holy spirit come now cleanse us from every doubt and every frustration every suspicion and every line of skepticism that would be in us that we might be free without one doubt come out confess boldly like peter thou art the christ the same yesterday today and forever and i believe as we live in a world we live in today and you know almost every day i i go on the internet and i i click on the deal and look at what the current events taking place and my brothers and sisters i i think that we are seeing the very evidence of the scripture you can say well does this apply to this well you could argue yes you could argue no uh whatever but you know my brother and sister what is it now i don't know if you guys are afraid yet but the delta variant of the kovid is out and it's going to make the original covid look like nothing and the world is quaking governments are quaking and the bride is rejoicing because my bible says that there will be pestilences and diseases and all kinds of troubles falling on the earth but this bride is not cowering this bride is saying thank you lord there's another sign that we're at the end time now look you know we wash our hands and we cook our food and all these things because that is you might say the common sense thing to do but my brother and sister nowhere in the word does it tell us that we should be afraid of the world we live in today in fact we've already by the word of god overcome this world amen you see god deals in patterns he's referenced it there in the scriptures in exodus 25 of patterns and when god lays out a pattern my brother and sister he doesn't come along and it's a new generation i need a new pattern see this is a problem that i would claim you know i we only have this revelation because of the message but you know just looking at it from the outside of the message looking at the world the problem the world has today the world of religion has today is that they're trying to change i just watched an interview of a pastor that has a quite large church and they were concerned about losing their children so in one of the annexes of the church they have installed video games and ping pong tables and pool tables and all of this and this pastor with spiky hair ripped jeans an untucked shirt you know and four or five necklaces and two or three bracelets and he's saying you know we've got to use what we have the resources we've got to catch these children and we have to adjust to the culture you know what's going to happen they're still going to lose the children but they're going to be inside church lost they're going to be inside the four walls of the church lost god deals in patterns now we read the scripture and it says that god is immutable is that correct scriptural amen not a message term scriptural immutable is unchangeable so god is unchangeable my brother and sister and when he said i'm the same yesterday today and forever he meant that serious so if god ever healed someone he's going to heal you amen if god ever saved someone right we go right down the whole list god's doing that now my brother and sister we look at this sometimes and this just came up in a little conversation the other day and uh someone that you know but we've been we even prayed for him here in the church and you know they pass away and people say well god didn't heal them well my brother and sister we don't know what god's plan was for them just like we don't know what god's plan is for us but i tell you what we stand on the unfailing promise of god that whatever god's plan for us is will come to pass amen and the minute that brother closed his eyes and he quit breathing he was healed step to the other side he was no longer bound by a body that have been ravaged by life in years and etc so god deals in patterns his ways immutable amen he does not change with the culture or the seasons now this is pretty funny sister jerry many years ago bought me a light and it's supposed to supposed to help combat sads sads you know some of us are just such people of the outdoors and of the sun when winter comes and it's ugly outside we just kind of feel i don't know if any of you feel that way yeah thank you i needed an ally you know she bought me a light and you know what's strange about that is i in my mind think it's just a reading light but in the winter time i read a lot and i'm sitting there under that light and i don't feel now why would god allow that to happen in my life why didn't god just make me happy all four seasons but god's still god in the middle of the storm god is still god in the middle of the winter amen we as humans have certain ways we cope you might say some of us well okay i'll just say it sometimes when i feel a little i eat everything in sight now i know i'm not alone i don't feel so happy today fridge comes open that looks good that looks good that looks good cabinet twinkies eat a box honey make me some ice cream make me a cake make me a pie make me cookies and she's like all at once yes that's our way of coping but what did god give us my brother and sister the real coping mechanism of a son or daughter of god is not what we stuff in the face of this flesh but it's what we put into the soul is how we are going to cope amen we cannot find one thing that will satisfy this flesh that will fix our problem but when we can find the remedy amen when we can come into that place that we are in communion with god amen we find that suddenly the things around us are not my brother and sister nearly as bad as we thought they were satan's over there whispering this is the worst now brother jason would know we had i i don't know it might even have been brother jason that started this but we still have this culture around the farm and things go wrong and things are whatever and and you know there's a certain voice you have to say it in you can't just say it it loses its whole deal but we'll do it just happened yesterday and and you're talking about well this was this and i i oh this piece that fell off this piece of equipment i found it out in the field and smashed in the dirt and and it's there and jesus is like oh this is the worst and you stop saints and realize no it's not the worst this is nothing but in our mind oh this is the worst now come on be honest with me somewhere in this last week you could have if you were familiar with that stopped and said oh this is the worst no the worst is god being absent from our life the worst my brother and sister is not being in communion the worst is missing the plan of god that's the worst now i'm sorry i hope i don't offend no one by putting a tad bit of humor without but you know i'm telling you when we come and we'll hit this in a minute but i'm a little ahead of myself my brother and sister they'll come a day when they're standing in the judgment and god will do this and i hope you don't feel like i'm slighting this but i just want to make this point that manner that woman that boy or girl that's standing in the presence of almighty god in the judgment seat and he says depart from me that'll be a time you can stop and say this is the worst but till we reach that point my brother and sister we don't know what the worst is now let me interject this i feel bad for those people that are going to church faithfully believe they're being faithfully taught and their pastors tell them no matter how good you live here you're going through the tribulation well if you're going through the tribulation now this isn't christian thinking but i'm just throwing it out there if you're going through the tribulation anyhow then why would you really need to live good right now because when full-blown tribulation comes the only option there is is to give your life for the gospel and so you know you could just live easy squeezy and just go on and then give your life for the gospel and it's all solved you see it doesn't fit the word of god it doesn't fit the plan of god it doesn't fit the whole manifestation of the word coming forth and coming alive in a people and glorifying oh do you feel glorified this morning the word coming down glorifying a people and you say glorifying him yes that's right the king of kings the lord of lords the king of all glory has come down and taken abode in the life of sons and daughters of god and god don't deal in no trash god don't deal in no back alley as it were god deals in holiness amen and when we are called to that holiness and we respond to that and we come into communion with him amen it will not let you live life easy squeezy it will not let you live haphazardly it will continually refine you as the refiner's fire purifying and purifying and purifying until we would be worthy oh i hope you understand me we'd be worthy to be wrapped around the ark wrapped around the mercy seat becoming a part of the great plan of god am i making sense this morning amen now look at this old testament brother brown says this i i didn't feel the need to even bring quotes concerning this it's scriptural old testament god was expressed through the law so there was man trying to live it man making an effort but yet if you realize my brother and sister this is why saints now if this is it comes a little sharp to you forgive me but i love you and i feel the need to see this is why taking communion once in a blue moon is not sufficient because the believer in those days come and offered a lamb once a year for his sin walked out sinned again but communion comes with an accountability it comes with the need to examine ourself you say well i i know this is teachings even within the message well we we don't need to take communion well my brother and sister that's not what the scripture says i don't care what brother so and so from so and so says the scripture says old testament god was expressed through the law nothing wrong with the law you know that saints nothing at all wrong with the law people get this idea especially in the world that's being preached today no no we're not under the law no more we're under grace we're under grace but jesus come along and put clarity to that and he said you know what here we are uh uh er er well let me not get ahead of myself okay please paul new testament now god is expressed through grace and we can put a quotation mark there and put mercy behind that because grace is mercy when god bestows his grace upon you and i he is giving us a dispensation of mercy that he is laying out upon us otherwise we would be accountable and have to pay the price for whatever it is that we have transgressed of the law and so we look at this now and we come here now let's just look at matthew 5 starting with first verse and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was said his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled saints don't sit around hungry don't sit around spiritually famished spiritually anorexic he said if you will seek after it you will be filled so if anybody's sitting here this morning not filled don't blame god don't blame your church don't blame your pastor you yourself have to hunger and thirst well i said are they merciful for they shall obtain mercy now i want to just speak for just a moment upon that just to make a point my brother and sister when we uh fall under a judgmental spirit when we fall under a spirit or we look around and i see what's wrong with you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you but i don't see what's wrong with me you see that is a contrary stubborn spirit it also is a selfish spirit it is also now pardon me you won't find this listed this way in the bible but i'm just going to speak plain this morning it's also an ignorant spirit because somehow or another you feel qualified to judge when the scripture says judge yourself lest you would be judged and so we feel like we're qualified to judge everyone around us but we are not interested in judging ourselves you see that's a very detrimental position to be in and i pray to god that we would just kick that spirit out never let it take root in our our lives and never raise our children up in that kind of atmosphere because you see blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy and i can see this morning every one of us needs mercy not one of us is going to live such a perfect righteous life but what we will come to the day we need god's mercy and the prophet of god said if i can just put it in this context and tie it together you backslide every day so that means every day i need mercy can you agree with me every day we need mercy so let's be merciful blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god and blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad see how the sudden transition here no one likes that somebody speaks down about you somebody speaks hard words about you i'm telling you those words can be crushing but he comes right along and says rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you ye are the salt of the earth is there any salt here this morning but if the salt has lost his testimony amen are you with me i'm not trying to change the scripture but if the salt has lost its testimony where people wonder are they backslid what's happening in their life you see my brother and sister if the salt has lost his savor wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and be trodden under foot of men you are the light of the world i love how this just comes with a little chastisement and then an encouragement chastisement and an encouragement over and over again it wants you to be aware so you can judge yourself but he's coming right there to encourage you to not get too too down and out about your position amen you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid that's you you wonder why you walk through the stores you walk through whatever you're at work or whatever and you seem to be the uh kind of the oddball that's there because you are the light you are the city that's been set on a hill and god's not gonna let you be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven now my brother and sister i i think it's really i i've decided it's a complex and that's just an opinion so don't don't get too upset but when we go around all the time quantifying and we speak well you know what i was there and i felt led to lay hands maybe a momma might feel this way laying hands on her baby that doesn't feel good or something and you know it'd be like saying well i was there and and you know this happened and i laid hands on my child and i prayed and god came on the scene and then right behind that will be like well you know i i'm not this and i'm not that and i'm not my brother and sister you don't need to back up on that it was almighty god who come down and channeled himself through you and you are then god's chosen receptacle for the word don't back up i'm not worthy and i wasn't this and i wasn't you don't need to do that god would not have performed that work through you if he did not judge you worthy so we don't need to sit here and in our flesh start backing it up like well i wasn't nothing it just this it was that no my brother and sister stand on who you are i am a son of god i'm a daughter of god i am set as a light on a lamb stand i am set as a city on the hill with the light shining that's who i am i am not looked at by my god as some worthless no good but i guess i got no one else i'll use them kind of a person we are god's chosen we are god's elected and we don't boast of who we are we boast of jesus christ in us that's what we boast of but we're not going to oh my brother and sister we don't need to boast oh oh oh oh look over here brother so and so such a great man of god if i could be like him then be like him get in the word get a life be like him now lest any of you think i'm a hypocrite i'm subject to the very words i'm preaching old testament expressed through the law new testament expressed through grace now look at this let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works you know what you can be identified with your good works you don't have to like do this and then disclaim it well you know because let me put it this way to you everybody around you knows it was god in you because everyone around you is human just like you are we don't need to say well you know i down myself down myself i don't want to sound boastful down myself no sir every one of us that's serving god knows we are who we are by the grace of god because every one of us as humans recognize i can't do this i can't do this in my flesh now this is really the scripture out of all of those right there that i wanted to tie together think not that i am come to destroy the law in other words do away or abolish set aside or negate right don't think i come to do that see the spirit of the world we live in is we're not under law we're not under the law we're under grace wonder of grace we're under grace you know what grace is it's the revelation of the law because by revelation of the law we recognize no man is able but we have one who is able and for generations they brought their turtle dove their lamb they're bullock and they offered them because they desired forgiveness for their sin but it never changed the inner man but under the dispensation of the new testament the word is now written on the heart of sons and daughters of god it's no longer requiring a tablet aren't you glad in an age where tablets are everything we don't need a tablet any longer it's been written on our hearts amen i'm not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily i said unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled so all these people that are preaching were no longer in the law no under the law don't believe this scripture right here they had to take a marker and block it out of their bible or else they're just preaching contrary are we doing okay now my brother and sister i would say of this scripture right here lord i i don't want to do away with the parts i struggle with come on lord don't don't just do away with the parts of the bible that i struggle with right lust of the flesh pride of life there's a whole list of things that humanity struggles with lord don't take that away don't black it out lord let me fulfill all of the word there's just as simple as lord take that away you can say lord let me fulfill all of the word that's for your bride you see i don't want all the word there's some people in there that are going in the pit i don't have anything to do with you and i right so here it is it's just as easy my brother and sister amen it's just oh hallelujah it's just as easy for us to stop and say lord forgive me and help me do better as it is to say that doesn't apply to me just as easy my brother and sister but they yield such entirely different results amen so i i say this this is my heart as i was putting this down writing all this out uh lord let me fulfill all that pertains not just according to scripture see that that's a good position to claim but lord i want to claim and fulfill all that pertains to your wife amen not just some character in the bible or some character on the earth now i want to fulfill what pertains to your wife the bride of jesus christ i want to be specifically identified amen you know if you've ever been to the doctor's office or you've ever been somewhere you know they don't just walk out and say next because no one knows who's next they identify you mr paul halett this is paul haylett or mrs jerry haylett or however be identified see a very specific identification is placed with that now my brother and sister you know i say this with a little bit tongue-in-cheek the prophet of god said you know you should read your bible and identify with someone in the bible and unfortunately i i just love to identify with the apostle paul good things bad things whatever but i i've got a name right there i can identify with but you see the word of god is such by revelation as you hear the word coming forth it is speaking to you in such an intimate fashion that you actually hear god calling your name it is no longer oh there's going to be someone that's going to fulfill this there's going to be someone who's going to be saved there's going to be someone fill the holy ghost there's going to be someone that no my brother and sister you're hearing that oh i hope you can identify with that this morning and you actually hear god speaking your name and you know he was speaking to me hallelujah not just on some random character but speaking to me now i want to jump over here and look in leviticus leviticus 16 and he shall take a censer 1612 and he shall take a sensor full of bullet burning coals of fire from off the altar before god before the lord and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small in other words not some great big sticks beaten and bring it within the veil and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the lord that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony that he die not you see if one walked in there then without that incense to burn before the mercy seat of pandey alter the ark containing the testimony that man died in other words coming into the holiest of holies was such a sacred thing that if god says you have to have a sash with a purple thread and you have to have a pomegranate and you have to wash yourself before you put these garments on and you have to pour oil anointing upon your head if you didn't do those they pulled you back out with a rope now saints i i say this a little tongue-in-cheek okay i hope you don't mind i'm in good humor this morning church would be a whole lot different church would be a whole lot different if we looked out here to the center island there was a bunch of ropes going out the back door and people come in here angry and mad and disrespectful and we'd need a deacon the size of brother ivan because it might be hard to pull some of us out through the feet and around the deal and down the aisle come on church it'd be a whole different atmosphere saints but it is the same today god just didn't put physical death upon them he put spiritual death apart and he shall put incense upon the fire before the lord that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony that he die not and he shall take the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle the blood with his fingers seven times now we look at this my brother and sister and these words right here are actually words that were directed to aaron and you see if you go back and study your your bible you'll see that aaron had two sons that were dis disrespectful to the word of god and it cost them their life amen it didn't matter that they were prophet sons and they were disrespectful to the word of god and people say now can god get angry now my brother and sister just type in the word wrath in your bible app app and just see how many times the word wrath shows up god is a god that does not put up with nonsense come on we can come to church all we want we can have all the nonsense we want we can just play like it's a big game but my brother and sister when god reaches the end of his patience to a man you will find that all through scripture god took their life because said i'm done with you you refuse to line up to the word you refuse to honor me you refuse to give worship and praise you refuse these things i'm done with you and you will find that god has a way of letting the people know time after time year after year decade after decade and you say oh oh and now i'm all depressed brother paul no my brother and sister god rich in mercy god rich in mercy we're not talking about the son or daughter of god that the devil's trying to keep them and drag them back out of the house of god we're talking about the person who has absolute disrespect to the word and presence of god so don't get all concerned about a son or daughter or husband or wife whatever it might be don't get all shook up that they might have no my brother and sister god rich in mercy but i'll tell you what we've dealt with people unfortunately my poor wife was a witness to some of these things dealt with people that mockingly speak even this message right back in your face well if amen okay i'm sorry but i i'm going to move back a little distance i don't know how big the bolt of lightning or the fire might be i'm just going to go ahead and move back a little away from you and people are like well shouldn't you show love and grace to them well i'll tell you what my brother and sister i'll show love and grace to him but i'll do it at a distance while i pray for him come on am i making sense hallelujah i hope i am i pray i am i seriously pray i am you see sometimes all these things just come in such a fashion to you that it's like lord help i know they go together i know it's connected but lord i need your help to to bind and tie all this together that don't lose you on the trail so to speak you see now incense come even there in the tabernacle we have the ark amen contains the testimony we have the mercy seat and we have the incense being burnt there this is not my brother and sister a sprig is that the right word a twig sprayed we don't just bring a little sprig of incense in put it on the altar it required enough incense that it covered all of the mercy seat and all of the ark and filled the room or have you noticed brothers the rope hasn't moved for a while we don't hear the tinkling of the bell oh my we tug the rope and it doesn't tug back oh my do you think they reveled or rejoiced in that no no no no more than we should revel or rejoice in this day no matter how contrary somebody in the flesh has been to you we should never rejoice or revel in in their calamity and their misfortune in what's happening in their life or families or whatever you should never there's something wrong if we do amen we're lacking the holy ghost our own self amen so it's there you see that he had to come and do this so the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony that he die not now i hope that you'll look at this my brother and sister and recognized now chapter 16 all these connecting uh scriptures uh were all in that day in a physical sense right they did this you must do this you must do that now you need to by revelation by god dealing with you opening up to you you need to recognize every one of those is now manifested in the spiritual realm today amen we are no longer carrying a bundle of incense putting it on fire we're no longer doing all of these things we don't have to have the thread of the pomegranate we don't have to pour the oil physically on our head so that it run down our beard and down our garment and dripped on the floor there's all those things that we're pertaining to going into the holiest holidays we don't do that in a physical realm any longer but we must be doing it in a spiritual realm we must be coming my brother and sister not haphazardly entering in and exiting out not haphazardly performing the duties as a priest of our home a son or daughter of god we shouldn't be haphazardly doing that because it will yield the same results only one now is no longer physical it's all in the spiritual element and so we must make this connection to our day and as i said let me remind you this is just a portion of several maybe lord willing future uh thoughts or opening up of this now we're gonna jump to revelations the fifth chapter and he says i saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof so this loud voice my brother and sister thundered through heaven and earth it was not a whisper it was not just an echo but it was a voice that encompassed heavens and earth and no man in heaven nor on earth see the reason i say that is it had to be heard in earth too or else this wouldn't be accurate no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book and neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not i'll tell you what i can go back to a stage in my life and i hope you understand this connection i can go back to a stage in my life where a man i'm sure anointed of god looked at me and in the very essence of this right here spoke these words to me now they sounded entirely different but what touched in my heart was the same effort right here because reality when a son or daughter of god is backslid whether you see it on the outside or not they do a lot of weeping they find no joy in the world around them come on any of you ever been backslidden you realize there's no joy in nothing you can buy a new this and a new that and go here and go there and nothing satisfies nothing makes you happy and people are like i don't know what's wrong with him there's something wrong with her i i we don't know i i tell you once you've been there you can recognize the symptoms what they need is a serious inoculation of the holy ghost amen and that'll satisfy those things down in the soul people are like well you know why'd you start drinking or doing this or doing that well i just wasn't happy and i just kind of helped me drown it well let me introduce you to a better way to drown that no man was found worthy weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david right give us a very direct connection to what it is hath prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof oh hallelujah isn't that beautiful my brother and sister he prevailed can someone say he prevailed hallelujah we're not just here trying we're not here just struggling he has already prevailed on your behalf and on my behalf hallelujah oh and i be held and low in the midst of the throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he come and he took the book now see i'm not adding to the message brother branham lays this out so many different ways and he come and took the book of redemption see this wasn't just any old book this is not a history book this is not a novel this is not a mystery this is a book of redemption out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints oh hallelujah and they sang a new song thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has oh it was it wasn't just a redemption taking oh i hope you catch it it wasn't just a redemption taking place he has made us to our god amen he's empowered you he poured himself he poured the very life that was in that book of redemption poured it right into you and made it alive and has made us to our god kings and priests and we shall reign can somebody say i'm going to reign hallelujah we often look oh oh when we have a rapture we go in the millennium when we go to heaven we're right here and the word says that we are going to reign on this earth hallelujah you don't need to look much further no this is not prosperity gospel this is not dominion gospel my brother and sister this is the word made real to you and i to know that overcoming power in this book of redemption has empowered you and i to stand here today and claim every promise stand on that promise and watch it be manifesting oh hallelujah i'll tell you is he worthy oh could we this morning i i just humor me please can we say together thou art worthy hallelujah lord thou art worthy oh hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord now look at this what do we see now coming forth golden vials full of voters no longer saints an incense that we pack in and put on the altar the odor that pleased god in the holiest of holies is now in type and shadow been replaced with an odor that come from where our prayers no longer something we collected at the market and took and offered to god to bring a sweet odor before him now what's happened it's you and i it's our prayers it's coming up and blanketing the throne of god no longer my brother and sister is the fire and opened fire as it were consuming combustible but it's a fire of the holy ghost that's burning the dross burning the life and bringing that to come to life you see because when the fire is on the inside the odor will be coming from you if you have a prayer life you will have a sweet odor before the lord if you have the holy ghost god will know it's funny this should come to mind i read a brief deal we are so individual saints that now science i don't know why people do research like this but now science has decided that even your body odor is unique to you imagine that how'd he do is right now i want you the reason i go ahead and bring that up is because i want you to realize if even scientifically our dna right can be identified even our body odor is a reflection of what we are and what we eat and all these things how beautiful our prayer states your prayer is rising up before the throne of god it's not some just great big odor there he's sitting there saying oh my daughter she's praying again oh look over here yes oh this brother oh look at this one look at oh look at this my brother and sister identified identified coming forth blanketing once again the throne of almighty god now look in the message the ark the law was a judge the law judged but the atonement stood between the confessed believer and the judgment now when the prophet of god says this between the confessed believer he is not talking about us standing here saying i'm a believer i'm a believer he's talking about the person or individual that has confessed everything to god he's clean he's been washed by the water of the word he's poured it all out and he said lord forgive me that's the kind of confessed believer he's talking about so the atonement stood between the confessed believer in the judgment there laid the judgment in the ark ready to come forth but when it did it couldn't for there was an atonement standing between it and the believer and the believer come and accepted christ in the shadow and type shed bread sprinkled upon the mercy seat then he had mercy and could walk away rejoicing because he was free from judgment now i want you to catch this my brother sister because everything has to come in its order and it's there now as it comes and the incense is being burnt and the cloud of incense is coming around the ark around the mercy seat and then they come and sprinkle the blood so my brother and sister it's so interesting because the word shows us that without the holy ghost we can't even honestly truly declare jesus is the christ and without coming into that presence of god you say but what if it's a sinner he's doing there remember it's the sinner's prayer his confession is what breaks it my brother and sister it's not about how many years he was in church an office he held or what he could recite is his confession of lord forgive me for i am a sinner and is in that confession right there my brother and sister that very first prayer brings a cloud of incense before the throne and then the sprinkled blood is the redemption but you can't get redemption without the prayer because if we believe we can get redemption without the prayer then we would make a good denominational christian so the sweet odor starts coming and the shed blood is then sprinkled upon the mercy sea then he had mercy and could walk away rejoicing because he was free from judgment you know some people say you know god's no longer judging us but you know that's not correct he is judging each and every day but you look at my brother and sister you look at this and when we fail have anybody failed lately oh hallelujah i thank you some of you are courage enough to lift your hands amen i'll pray the rest of you come to a point you lift your hands but look at this my brother and sister when we fail when we have things we think something we have an attitude and emotion we we actually do something and we are there now look at how god works my brother and sister he comes and judgment would then come judgment can't come upon you because there's an atonement so the judgment's still present the judgment's still active but it can't come upon you because he can walk away now because the atonement stands between him and the judgment which would be your sin do you see how beautiful that is it says blessed is the man who god will not impute sin why can't he impute it the sin was still there and say how can they do that lord i just don't understand this can't be right but my brother and sister the sin comes back to you in the form of judgment and comes to the atonement and cannot come upon you oh hallelujah thank you amen there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but the spirit when a man knows that he's died to the things of the world and those that get in christ jesus walking according to the holy spirit not the ways of this sinful world there is no condemnation to him he can look in the face of hell and judgment and rejoice because there's the blood of christ making atonement standing between him and judgment hallelujah yeah thank you lord amen we stand here today god didn't say now you're you're going to make a rapture i'm going to claim you if you never have a thought never have a deed never have nothing no he said look i have come and the revelation of who you are that you will come and your prayer lord forgive me for what i thought forgive me what i did comes up as a sweet odor to the throne and it surrounds the mercy seat and god says that's all right i've covered you with the atonement and you are free from that hallelujah i love this my brother and sister i love this amen there's because there's the blood of christ making atonement standing between him amen and judgment praise the lord our prayers my brother and sister the incense upon the altar the sweet odor before the lord you see why satan desires to hinder your prayer life you see for aaron if he went in there without sufficient incense that the cloud would completely cover that room completely hide the mercy seat and the ark and the testimony he come in there without sufficient it was death to him you see why satan hates this today your prayer is coming as a sweet odor before god and satan recognizes if i can keep them from praying then there will be nothing in that room to cover the mercy seat nothing to cover the ark nothing to cover the testimony and they will slowly spiritually die amen oh i just the prophet of god said pray every day it can be hard come on can we be men and women enough to say it can be hard amen you find yourself just beaten from the day all the struggles of whatever it is and you realize oh lord i i i should have never allowed myself to be in that bigger hurry this morning i didn't read my bible and now i'm ah god help us satan don't care whether you pray what he cares about is the effect of your prayers and let's not be mechanical i don't know how many of you come out of a catholic background but if you come out of a catholic background you're mechanical you read your bible mechanically you pray mechanically don't be a message catholic even if all you can muster is two minutes get down and say lord forgive me for not making priority of you today lord forgive me for everything i did wrong today lord i love you oh lord help me amen roll over go to sleep if that's all you can get but don't do one of these lord i'm so terrible i'm unworthy i'm no good lord i don't know why you chose me now lord oh maybe i'm not even one i feel so beaten i i just uh lord i failed you 59 different ways today that's just the ones you saw don't pray that way be sincere lord i am sorry that's why satan desires to hinder your prayer life the lord telling moses aaron now look at this i don't i won't go back into all the aaron must have incense enough to fill the room lest he die can i be like a dictator pastor this morning can i come across as just like a bully to you this morning pray like your life depended on it amen forget this prayers of convenience paul forget this i'll give the lord just enough until my head hits the pedal pray like your life depended on it i actually tempered those harsh words i was going to say to you i realized they applied to me more than anybody else and i'm just can't bear that judgment this morning lord aaron must have sufficient incense upon the mercy see verse 13 as we go back to that he shall put the incense upon the fire before the lord that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony that he die not connection my brother and sister of the overcoming life in jesus christ cannot be had without a prayer life that's right i believe the message i'm sorry do you have a prayer life do you have incense before the throne of god do you have incense before the mercy sea but i believe the message brother paul god sent a prophet i believe that that's well and good if you believe it then you'll do what he told us to do that's it come on it's been on my heart i might preach that and then you guys might just vote me out and pitch me on the street but my brother and sister we hear people say say only what the prophet said i'm tired of hearing that say only what the prophet said i want us to listen and do all the prophet said amen not just the portion that makes us happy is comfortable the part that everybody can jump up and and shout hallelujah over but all of that amen so you can't have an overcoming life i'm going to just make that connection to you and i hope it don't offend you this morning but you cannot have an overcoming life unless you have a prayer life amen now i want to just hurry up close here i was so afraid i wouldn't have enough to preach on amen because the man or the woman that's ever been in that back desert alone like moses was and the revelation of god be made manifest to him through the holy ghost there's nothing can shake him he's just as sound as solid as he can be these last lines right here is what excited me he's just as sound and solid as he can be satan hates revelation he don't like it at all upsets his plans well hallelujah i like it when god's a spoiler and the devil's like i've got a trap for them i've got this i'm going to make this happen this is going on that's going on there's trouble in their family and this is over here and someone says this somebody says that and god comes right in and delivers you from that complex and you go out of there praising god and you might have a brother sister mother father son or daughter or whatever it is that's just around to you and you walk out and they're like well that mom ain't even ain't even uh i didn't pay attention to me why because god come and spoil the devil's plans because he was there trying to snuff us down and get us down to where nobody loves me how does that go nobody loves me i think i'll just eat worms or something like that some little kid story yeah well come on come on now y'all don't frown at me but some of you come into church with dirt on your face so i know you've been eating worms come on the devil's a liar amen and he hates revelation because revelations what sets us free from all of our little complexes teenagers this world's full of all kinds of voices that are going to tell you if you want to have fun if you want to be something in this life you need to go over here and do this sounds good until you're the one with needle tracks in your arm until you're the one that's slouched down in an alley somewhere or been used by humanity and cast to the side then suddenly the devil's no longer around you're no longer his chosen but if you ever was chosen of god you're still is chosen hallelujah now look at this it says right here in this quote that there's nothing can shake him amen who wants to be identified as unshakeable amen i want to be identified as unshakeable oh my so much for my great thing that i was going to be done preaching by noon can i borrow 20 minutes from whoever preaches next sermon i think i was going to ask brother david to preach this wednesday is that okay brother david now the mercy seat now the mercy seats where in the heart so to get to the mercy seat you have to have a prayer life you have to to recognize it be filled with the holy ghost amen no wonder god will be off the mercy seat to so many see so many are thinking oh god's leaving the mercy seat there's no more mercy for them no more mercy for them god's left the mercy seat but you see my brother and sister if he's in the heart of a son or daughter of god he never can leave that mercy seat and so you'll have a whole world that he is off the mercy seat because he's no longer in their hearts he's no longer center of their life so therefore he's off their mercy seat and while there might be judgment upon them there is still mercy to the bride of jesus christ do you follow me hallelujah amen now the mercy seats in the heart see where the shining forth his glory in all of his children the shekinah glory in the human heart here is a human heart is that right is that the mercy seat how do you come through into that through these different systems through self-will no you can't come through a system you can't come through self-will comes into here and through there comes out what shekinah glory almighty god coming into you and i can somebody say thank you lord coming into you and i coming right down and then manifesting him and turning us into a city on a hill turning us into a light on a lampstand turning us into sons and daughters of god hallelujah chicano glory what is this chicano glory amen so if god's not present with us we have no second glory we have no one in the throne room doesn't fit the word my brother and sister god's presence is right here come on sorry to be so demanding this morning but can somebody say praise the lord god's presence in my life god's present my life amen he's not waiting for the day of the rapture to come and be present in my life he is present here he is present now he is the very second glory the glory that falls down in the midst of god's people is god himself people say well no no that's the holy ghost we're trying to identify jesus christ and lord and god and whatever the prophet of god said it's all the same it's god so we start to dice it up and we say this can't be that because i i think this is that and that can't be there when all we're doing is chopping up god trying to divide him to fit our mental approach to the word they don't go into the gambling dead oh let me go back up what is this kind of glory it's god's presence and when a man's walking or a woman he's reflecting the chicano glory how can you reflect something that's not in you how could you reflect a life that's not in you thank you for being here lord thank you for being in us today lord thank you for your life for your spirit for your presence hallelujah thank you lord he don't go into gambling dens and carry on and go out here and deny the word now look here my brother and sister now this could just be me i'm closing sister amy musicians would you come you see when i read this and maybe it's just the fault of the way i read things he don't go into gambling dens proper english would put a comma right there wouldn't it i don't know that's the way i read it would be don't go into gambling down pawn paws i mean we're not going to try and tie it all together pause don't go into gambling against and it doesn't carry on i'll let you define what carry on means to you because you see if i'm legalist i'm going to be holding the hatchet over your head all the time because you're doing whatever you do i might deem that as carrying on and go out here and deny the word now let's let's break this down now gambling dan's carrying on is actually entirely separate from denying the word it's broke away from that by pauses by spaces continuance of thought with time to think about it and how many people in our day my brother sister the prophet preached about it over and ago talking about a divine healing and so many people oh god supernatural god god's a great god but god's not a healer what were they doing come on look at the commas look at the spaces think about it they were denying the word now this is going to be a little abrupt and i hope you don't offend no one we got a lot of people coming to life around this message today they believe god sent a prophet they believe all these things but they'll come to something in the word of god and they'll say that can't be so oh listen to the unveiling of god you'll see where brother brown is talking about it's not the first person not the second person not the third person it's god himself and then that will step right down pardon me my memory sometimes don't really grab this but it's within a few paragraphs right there and brother brown says and they'll come out and say that's not so now look i i don't mean to put this in the way but i'm just going to say it i have witnessed those very words i'm not judging the person in fact i prayed for him this morning so don't think that i'm i'm just brow-beating and throwing hatchets but it scared me saints when you quote something from the message and people say that isn't what he meant that's not so it's very self-fulfilling right there coming to pass remember the quote that i read wednesday night brother brown says i'm not the one to answer the question ask the questions you're not the one to ask the questions we're here just to believe the word don't come to a place that the devil anoints you with a spirit that you would say that's not so it's not what the prophet taught us he told us you put it on the shelf you ask god for revelation you pray about that god will answer that for you you see you go out there and deny the word pretty easy now brother donnie reagan i'm sorry brother don't need to throw you under the bus here but brother donny years and years ago made this statement stuck with me i can't shake it he said the problem we have is we have message methodist message baptists and message lutherans and message catholics it's not lit or past and control our future don't let past understandings be your current revelation open up and say lord i want to know i want to be able to come with complete confidence to the mercy seat and walk away without one bit of condemnation not one bit of hindrance in my life and when it comes time i use little vanessa's example the other night terrified her she looked at me all bug-eyed like brother paul what are you doing but we want to be where we as a mama or a daddy or whatever it is someone else's child or uncle whatever it might be we want to come to that place when the need arises we're not stopping they're saying oh god could this be could that be how do i do this what do i do we want to be so anointed by the word for our hour that when we need to lay hands on a baby we just walk over there and say i am your son i am your daughter and the word says it's not me it's you lord but it's you in me and i therefore have the authority and not let one doubt not let one fear not one question mark enter into our thinking not one oh i'm not a minister oh my brother and sister we're sons and daughters of god and we are filled and anointed with the second glory of god hallelujah and this will be a future sermon but remember the prophet of god showed us so clearly that it is in the day this day that we live where once it was death to walk behind the veil and now it's death not to walk behind the veil is death now if we don't walk into the presence of almighty god god help us to stand up amen no matter what the people says he's got his heart set on one thing god oh can we say amen to that this morning hallelujah hallelujah oh mercy [Music] [Applause] my i should have fallen my soul cast down by god's mercy [Music] reroll my life oh mercy a re-roll [Music] my oh i should have fallen paul's soul cast down by god's mercy the re-roll my life [Music] oh grace brought heaven to me aren't you glad oh god's grace fallen my soul been cast down the grace brought heaven to let's just stand worship the lord for just a few minutes hallelujah forgive me if any of my humor this morning was offensive i didn't mean it that way just having a heart that's just bubbling up inside of me just knowing oh hallelujah knowing that when god is in me things he's not somewhere beyond the ether on the mercy seat he's right here he's right here i don't have to go looking for him he's in me he said i'll be with you even in you he was making the guarantee i'll be on your mercy seat for you all the days of your life oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah well i've been to the water and i've been baptized [Music] of course it's it's amen well anyway [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah what a difference it makes with [Applause] [Music] has been changed

i've just gotta i just gotta just preach this verse right here can't help myself look at this now here is our sin here is our unbelief here is judgment and here is the atonement now look my brother and sister if you want to go over here and stand as it were in that judgment god help you but you stand over here and you judge yourself just as the scripture speaks when we take communion judge yourself lest you would be judged now i want you to look at this and come and see what god sees god standing there he is the atonement and he sees our sin is scarlet right here and he sees our life whiteness oh my brother and sister and he says i put your sin in the seed of my forgetfulness wiped it away now you know what the devil's coming pardon me for preaching so long but the devil's coming
