so let me walk with you Jesus don't tell never leave me alone for without you no never make Heaven my home [Music] Hallelujah doesn't that just a lovely lovely invitation God has given us and we can just stand on that promise of the word and when we stand on the word my brother and sister you realize it's God calling his word back home and if you're standing on that word we don't have to worry about it I I I could just share some thoughts but I I need to constrain myself but I just want to make just a couple quick announcements uh I believe I didn't real I meant to call you Brother David and make a confirmation there but Brother David will be taking this service here at the church this coming Sunday uh we'll be in having the camp out and um so we just want you to remind or encourage everyone that that there will be church here and so as we look at this we want to also just give you a little advanced notice that brother Stan is going to be ministering for us this coming Saturday evening uh not this coming Saturday evening a week let me make sure I get that clear a week from now on a Saturday evening and uh and on Sunday and we'll have a fellowship to follow amen you know it's interesting we would certainly take um brother Vitale and his family's vacation time and we would consume it if we could but we are just going to take them to the mountains for a little time of um or rest and relaxation and um anyway I just want you I'm fighting with some thoughts that I want to just speak but so let's just remember two Saturdays from now 7 P.M Sunday morning 10 30 with a fellowship well I forgot the date that's why I didn't say the date is I'd forgot the date so night 19th and 20th okay okay 19th and 20th and fellowship to follow on that Sunday amen and so I just want to before I get carried away invite our brother Vitali to come and now we might be just a few minutes after our normal start for the minister but I want us amen remember we're here to hear the word of God we're here to hear the words of life we're here to take our portion tonight so just put the clock aside amen because you know in eternity you'll have plenty of time to rest amen and you might have plenty of time to rest tomorrow night or the night after or maybe next week but let's not take tonight and let that become our thought let's think on the word tonight let's come hungry brother Vitale come feed us amen we are hungry tonight amen thank you God bless you all it is and it is a privilege to be here and I want to thank you all for this especially the pastor brother Paul for this kind of invitation extended to someone who has he hasn't seen or met before uh that that you know that humbles me because it it takes a lot of trust for for a pastor to do that so I I Really Wanna thank the pastor for for the invitation and uh you know we'll welcome here in the church and also the invitation to your campout events this week we don't want to disturb you in in in in in your church uh you know events here so we'll try to be somewhere in the in the corner and uh I brought greetings from our small assembly in Vilnius Lithuania it is a small country in Eastern Europe and uh they they send their greetings to to this church here and I also had a few uh meetings and and calls with the other pastors who knew I would be going to the States and Canada on this trip so they also wanted me to extend their Christian greetings to everywhere I go one of the pastors uh in Lithuania it's about an hour drive from from where we are he he has been a denominational Pastor for many years and then recently has embraced the message and tried to introduce it in his own church and about maybe a few months ago if I'm not mistaken he re-baptized the whole church the name of the Lord Jesus Christ about maybe 30 people so they're on fire I mean this you know they they love the message they just consume it they it's it's the first love so and and he he told me wherever you go wherever there's brothers and sisters were where wherever there's leaves of fellowship please send our little fire over there you know that we're burning with and this also been a few churches in Belarus you know the country of Belarus uh there's uh quite well there are some Churches there and um and uh I I talked to some of the pastors and he they they told me hey if you go to the States and Canada just tell them there's some good Believers in Belarus and and we're connected by this Bond uh you know by the love of Christ and we're separated by different reasons here on Earth but in Christ where one body and they wanted me to extend their greetings as well they're working you know while it's day in the country where it's not very possible to preach this message but they still operate and people come new people get baptized and and and the message is moving on in there as well so praise the Lord and it's uh it is a privilege to see old friends here Brother David and his family and also uh the ones from their russian-speaking lands who we've seen in in some other contexts and and some other uh countries before but it's so nice to to meet you here and uh and to be with you here um English is not my native language so please bear with me I haven't preached an English for some four years probably so some some of the parts get rusty you know and and I need a little bit more oil you know in the to kind of get the machine running but uh I trust the Lord can can help us you know and just like this little boy he said I I just know the ABCs you know so Lord I'll just recite the ABCs to you and you can put the words together because it's he who puts the words you know we we cannot do that you know and when brother Paul said come and feed us I'm not too sure about that you know I cannot feed you know I I you know I I I know he can feed because you are he you're his sheep you're his bride you're his church so I'll just stand here and try to catch the thought and and the channel of inspiration to to deliver that as best as I can and um I would uh like to read a scripture with you if you if you can just we'll we'll read a very familiar scripture that's Matthew 16. um 1615 and it's um I'll try to be uh not to be too fast because brother Alex is translating I'm a translator myself so I feel for him when somebody is fast but somewhere around the middle of the service I may might forget about it so so if somebody can remind me please that's Matthew 16 15 if we can stand to honor the word a very familiar conversation uh between Jesus and his disciples and we've read it many a time and it's a very simple thought so I believe God is in Simplicity you know before but Brandon preached the the the the greatest mystery of all he he made sure he preached the longest service before it which was God in Simplicity to make sure people relax and understand God is really simple and he's available to everyone to a child to a teenager to a middle age to an older person and uh that that's the truth in our life so let's let's read the scripture and uh and uh that's Matthew 16 15. he says unto them but whom say ye that I am and Peter Simon Peter uh answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus enter answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I'd say unto thee that bowed Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail and Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whosoever thou shalt bind on Earth whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt lose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven Heavenly Father we thank you for this wonderful word that you made available for us Lord Jesus not only in this written form but also in the revealed form Jesus in the in the form of Revelation through the message of the hour through the messenger who brought the sense of it who brought the inspiration who brought the the very meaning of those words here Lord Jesus so we want to just tap into this channel we want to be fed by your word and and your power and your spirit this night Lord Jesus and we totally rely upon you because we're we're helpless Lord Jesus we were we are weak we we cannot produce anything out of the scripture Lord Jesus but you can because you have written it Lord Jesus in the sky in the pyramid in the book lord Jesus and now you want to write it in the uh on the tables of our hearts Lord Jesus we we thank you so much Lord Jesus we ask you for a blessing we ask you for the inspiration and Revelation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen sin it can be seated you know it is it is not very complicated to uh to preach in an assembly that has been established in the word for for many years from from what I know this church has been operating for for many years establishing people in in this message of the hour so I believe in churches like this you just have to come out and you know wait until this function of the Holy Ghost and then it's like the story of uh of this wedding that Jesus came remember in John 2 and and and then they they ran out of wine you know and at the wedding and so Mary the church you know Mary the woman she she came to Jesus and she she says you know they ran out of wine so what shall we do and he wasn't really willing to do that if you remember from the Scriptures it says what my time has not come it says what brother Brown interprets it and he says he was testing the faith of Mary as well you know it's how shall she react to to to an action like this in but Mary said you go and talk to him you go he do do whatever he he tells you now to do because she knew if she asked him he will give it you know so that's that's the Assurance we have every church service you know whether that's a Wednesday service whether that's a Tuesday service whether that's a Monday service or what uh or a Sunday service and he says you know his instruction was very easy and he says you you just take those water pots and and you and you fill them with water it says aren't up to the very brim they were they they were filled so so everything was ready you know everything was ready he just had to turn it into wine which it potentially was brother Francis right so when you when you have a a church filled with uh with people who are the water pots and they're filled with the Bible they're filled with a message I mean it's not it didn't take ages for him to you know turn it into a revelation right amen that that's why it's it's uh just like I said it's it's not a you know it's not a big deal you know a your pastor has been uh and Brother David you know they've been to different countries different settings you know where people they don't know the Bible they don't know the message it's it's more difficult over there you know but here I mean it's it's it's it's it's it's a great privilege but it's it's not very difficult to do that because you're filled with with the Bible you're filled with the message you know you come here sometimes you cannot connect the dots together but this is you know what what happens during the service right when you when when you're filled with it right this place here I believe it's it's not the very place where you have to be filled with water we we're this is homework right we we're filled with all water somewhere else right at home uh during uh our free time when we can listen to the world we can uh you know feed on the word and here we come and and then here it becomes wine as well right and praise praise be to Jesus hallelujah amen then it makes it easy for the pastor right it doesn't have to you know tell you did you read this message oh you didn't read this message oh no you did praise the Lord so so it's really wonderful you know to preach to a a wonderful group of people like this and uh we we definitely want to invite him to do that right because he had the power not not the overseer of the wedding and not somebody else not even the disciples but he himself was invited and he turned it into Revelation he turned this word his the the the this little word into into into a life right into into something that was tangible so we we definitely believe he can do that tonight as well praise be to Jesus and you know I'm standing here and you can imagine in my country it's it's somewhere around night time maybe early morning and uh I feel a little bit jet-lagged and how many of you have felt that before you've been to a country somewhere and then it's a different you know time zone and but that's good I mean because it's a spiritual uh type as well you know I was I was reading the scriptures you know and I thought about oh this is just like Paul says in in Thessalonians he says we are the children of light right we are the children of the day we are not the children of the night we're the children of the day so he says uh so let us not sleep well this is I'm addressing too much I'm preaching to myself you know I told brother Sergio I better don't say the phrase uh let's bow our heads because uh because I may not unbow it you know but but then you know Paul says there let us not sleep as do others he says let us watch and be sober it's it's not very easy you know where when when you come from a different country and this it's a different time zone and it's a night time over there and it's it's daytime here but uh he says for they that sleep they sleep in the night you know so if I if I sleep here on you you know or somewhere uh well that that would show I'm in the night yeah right you all in the day me in the night and that would be a problem right so um I you know when I was reading this I thought to myself you know I would be a visual aid today for for that because you know I come from a different country into this new country here right and my biological clock is still there I'm accustomed to that the time zone right so I feel a bit dizzy I feel a bit sleepy you know it's not easy to be sober it's not easy to watch everything you know you miss out on this and you you know you kind of some sometimes you abuse a wrong word or or something but the scripture says you shouldn't sleep you know it speaks to me and says hey you're in a different country now in in this country this day now it's not night it's day you shouldn't sleep now you know so this is this is how we're born into a new kingdom this is how we're born again into a new day you know just like we're saying this in the song You Know My New Day Has Come and this this new day has a different time zone at different time zones it's a different planet you know it's a different world it's a different dimension so you know the the the word speaks to me and it says you shouldn't live by the old you know ways you shouldn't live by the laodicean ways you shouldn't live by the time zone of laodicea right you shouldn't sleep you shouldn't you should be sober you should you know you should watch you know you should you should uh act like you know people in in the country there you know and so you know uh when I thought about that I I thought oh so how should I you know if we're born into this new kingdom how should we overcome the jet lag we just follow the day we just follow all the schedules of the day we don't sleep in the middle of the day or something if even if you feel like it right so it's speaking spiritual now oh praise the Lord and so what happens what happens with time you get adjusted to the New Kingdom and you become more sober you become you you lose the sleepiness you lose the dizziness and you function just like everybody in the church here you know so so it'll take me a few days and now get adjusted you know praise the Lord but I shouldn't sleep so so that's that's the point I believe this message of the hour has come you know this this the the shout you know it wasn't it it it wasn't you know a call it wasn't you know uh something really quiet it was a shout you know it was it it it was meant to wake us up you know in the in the Midnight Hour laodicea is in the midnight it's the old country right but he was inviting them into a new country where the bridegroom is right it says hey come out uh you know get adjusted to the new time zone the bridegroom has come lose your jet leg follow you know the the new schedules of the day you know go with all the citizens of the country praise the Lord hallelujah you know because you know brother Brown taught us we are children of the new days as Shalom it says good night you know civilization good night all the let alone this year but New Day Has Come right Hallelujah they did that something new it was it was brought you know the he says something is breaking brother Bram says right they need morning praise the Lord so um I I believe this the scripture is applicable to us you know because you know we we it perfectly matches Matthew 24 you know when uh it's just before we start you know just a little you know something to to to start uh he if you remember there's uh there's a lot of uh Parables excuse me Jesus uses uh at the end of uh uh chapter 24 Matthew 24 and then goes into 25 and and our Prophet taught us that Jesus taught all the seals all the six seals uh somewhere around by the verse 46 or something and then and then he says and then he didn't reveal the seventh seal he just just left it in The Parables right and so every Parable from then on if you read them they are about the coming every one of them when this man comes you know when the host of the house comes when uh you know this man with the talents comes back when the bridegrooms comes back all right praise the Lord so all of them are about the coming what is the coming brother Brian says it's the seventh seal right so one of The Parables is actually we can actually read it it's it's it's Matthew 24 42. it's about the same thing I I just thought about it today you know about being sober and about watching when the Lord will come for 20 24 uh 42 um and and it actually says uh that watch therefore the same same wording watch therefore for you know not what hour your lord does come it's the coming of the Lord right it's his second coming but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched he wouldn't sleep right he would know praise the Lord he would he would have watched and and would have suffered his house to be uh broken up therefore he also be ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh so it's the coming of the son of man right praise the Lord oh praise the Lord so so the the one of The Parables of of the coming it actually all those Parables if you go through them they depict to us the the picture to us the context of the of the second coming all of them all of them if you go through them one by one one of them is this one it says uh you you have to be the the good man of the house and you have to watch where you live watch the time you have to know when things will be coming in the coming of the Lord right praise the Lord so we have to be aware of those things that are going around us right and and and and and we look at those things and then this the the rest of the Parables go about the uh the faithful servant that is uh appointed by the father appointed by the Master to give food in due season yeah yeah right amen so and then it says when the Lord comes back he'll he says he'll be blessed this this man will be blessed so what what does that show to us it shows to us that in the days of the second coming where we're living in now amen I believe we're in the second coming amen amen because the shout has gone on yes it's in the process we're not we're basically not waiting for the right to we're in the rapture amen oh you know because sometimes we say you know oh I'll look for the Rapture you know this all best house and the Satan's Eden Odyssey and all of this I mean uh I'm not waiting for for that you know I'm I'm active already you know yes the Rapture is on it is on you know we we're just making it you know come come closer you know by how how much we take part in this kingdom of God so so it says they'll be servants who will be giving food in the due season under the in the context of the second coming and then he says there will be evil servants who will be beating their co uh co-servants right being drunk and all of those things and uh all of that is the context of the second coming as well this should happen this must happen this will happen and we cannot stop it this is inevitable this is the word you know so sometimes it's painful but this is what happens yes and then we go into into the ten virgins right this next Parable in Matthew 25 is is the Ten virgins so this this is what will be happening in the bride as well right under the second coming right and then we go into the talents amen pieces of silver right from what I know I may be wrong but the history says these were big pieces of silver you know that he actually left Silver's is a Redemption so he left the the church some with with uh with one some with two some with five right praise the Lord and then when he did that he uh he actually says I'm giving you two but I see four amen he didn't say I give you two I want to go two back no he says I I give you two but I see four the two are invisible but when I come back I want them to be visible yeah amen yeah praise the Lord and so I want them to be tangible don't talk about it give it to me praise the Lord just like brother Brahm says about the token he says we it's not talking about the token it's applying the token it's having the token on display oh praise the Lord so then then we have the parable of uh of of the shepherd and the Sheep right about the you know separating them into the left and right and then we have the the this parable of uh uh who who did I feed and who did I uh you know give clothes to and who did I visit in the prison and all of is the context of the second coming all of this reveals to what will be going on oh praise the Lord thank you Jesus so we're not in the darkness we're we are in the day in the day it's all visible you know it's it you can see all those things happening amen so so it's really wonderful for we I'm we're so blessed to have the messenger of the hour which was our eyes have that was anointed and I mean we can see those things this is what makes the the night a day for us praise be to Jesus amen thank you Father so so if we go back to this small scripture that we've just read it's a very familiar and simple scripture and uh uh you know it was a conversation between Jesus and his disciples and he was uh I I love every bit of it you know I love every every word of this conversation makes sense you know the Everything Jesus said and everything the Bible says every thought by him says you know every comma makes sense you know so so here when he he spoke to them about did they recognize who he was you know and um you know what were the opinions of the other people and if you remember they said you know some say you're this prophet and some say this was which was partially partially true he was that prophet he was John he was Jeremiah but I was only part of him you know but then he was he was wondering if his disciples see the fullness of the word not the part you know partial message or partial you know the scriptures or partial word of it which was true to some extent but it says but uh but who say ye who do you say that I am oh I love even the the question you know because he gives the hint he gives the answer in the question he says but who do you say I am [Laughter] he was always giving them hints you know in those in those questions praise me to Jesus because he is the I am he is the present tense God he is not the god of the past he's not the god of you know the future he is the god of the present tense amen that which makes him the god of the past and the future as well right so praise the Lord you know he he's asked him the do you recognize me as The God Who is the I am right who do you say that I am and then Simon Peter answered and he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God you're not the part of it you are the fullness of it because in Christ there was a fullness of the godhead bodily praise be to Jesus and says you are the son of that Living God you the product of that eternal spirit that was there and then it was formed into the logos it was formed into the Christ and you you can you can imagine such a formula such a wording come out of a simple uh fishermen I I think he was surprised when he heard himself saying that he was like almost like I should put it down you know I should because he probably hasn't heard himself say that before right because Jesus he he noticed that right away and he says this is not Peter this is not his terminology amen and since that was something from above that was something which is not natural to this man who is just a simple fisherman and all of a sudden he gives the most profound answer to the question with nobody around there was saying Jeremiah they were saying John or something else but then the simple fisherman he gives the full answer you are the Christ you are the Christ you are the product you're the son of the Living God Amen oh thank you Father Hallelujah and so when that happened Jesus spotted he he emphasized that and he says this is sub Supernatural this thing that is going on here is a revelation this is not a simple phrase this is not Peter now talking this is not just his nature you know well let me speak you know I want to build three Tabernacles here or you know or whatever you know that that Peter was you know it was natural for him to do that but this was Supernatural this was a revelation coming from the Lord afresh on a simple man and all the disciples are like oh he he does speak some good thoughts sometimes you know praise the Lord you know and then and then Jesus when he goes on and he says and then Jesus answered and then Jesus answered you know well he already answered in the in the question and then Peter answered by the Revelation and then Jesus answered right and and he said he is giving he a more detailed picture of the same answer of a shorter phrase that that Peter produced you're a Christ you uh you are something that came out of God and then he says Jesus answered and said the hip says blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah amen oh I love it so much he calls Simon by his natural name right here he will proceed to the to his new name a little bit further right but here he calls him by base you know simple family name you know or whatever and he and what he actually does here he he says you are Simon but you are blessed amen even though you are an Earthly man and you and he even mentions his father right and he says you are Simon bar Jonah which means you are a son of Jonah you're an Earthly man you're born from a national father but you are blessed praiseless blessed Jesus continuous and he says you blessed are thou Simon bar Jonah you're a son of Jonah brother Brahm says I am a son of Charles and Ella Branham all right so if it was brother Brandon it would be blessed Thou Art Thou William the son of Charles right right that's right and then it goes on for the flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee so Jesus is still talking about the Earthly things Earthly father Earthly parents Flesh and Blood your relationship with this world and then and then it's it's like a plane you know I see this picture as a plane or we've just spent some time on the three planes you know and and my favorite moment is and when is when it it takes off no no it it it it's it's on that line for some time you know it gets some speed it's still catching you know the Earth it's still uh running but it's catching the speed and this wonderful moment you know the degree changes you know the the front part goes up and and then you're like you know and there's a short pain you know like Broadband says during the Rapture you know it will be just a short oh okay sometimes not very short but but brother Brian says the the you know the Rapture will be a short pain you know something you know clicking where and then here you know Jesus goes on he says you are a Simon you are a son of Jonah you have a wonderful Earthly father and then the flesh and blood but he says it has not revealed it unto you but my father who is in heaven this is a different relationship this is a different father in other words he says you are a father of Jonah but you are also I mean a son of Jonah but you are also a son of a heavenly father and he is revealing it to you your father your dad your mom they cannot reveal they can lead you unto it they can teach you about it they can you know speak about it they can take you to Sunday school they can to make good friends you know with some other families that's wonderful they can read the word they can you know listen to the message with you that's wonderful praise the Lord but friends you got a Heavenly Father who is able to reveal it to you personally praise be to Jesus and then aren't you blessed then yes this is why he says blessed Abba you're a son of a fisherman you're a son of you are a bar Jonah but you are blessed because you can receive Revelations from a different father capital letter father who is in heaven who do you you say I am and my father is in heaven it's present tense praise the Lord hallelujah so my father oh my goodness so so in other words Jesus also says he's my father and he is also your father oh we have a common father with Jesus oh that that that you know that inspires me a lot if he was the son of God you know and he was you know leading a life that he he was leading on Earth and I'm a son of the same father oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah so he takes off you know from the Earthly Dimension from the Earthly things from the Earthly home from the Earthly parents from the Earthly Dead from the Flesh and Blood realm he takes off into Heavens into the where the father is right and then he he continues on and he says and I say also unto you he adds more detail to you says Thou Art Peter hey he just called him Simon he just called the name of his father but here he calls him by his new name amen amen that's his new name I was given a different Kingdom a different identification you know we we know the name is is in nature you know it's it actually is a uh why do we baptize people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in a different name because we want them to have the nature of that name right praise be to Jesus amen so so then he says uh I also said unto thee Thou Art Peter his new name and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail Prevail against amen so so here Jesus is revealing that he is building his own church he is planning to build his own church oh that's exciting you know Jesus will have a church a spotless Church a Victorious Church and now in here he actually shows to us what this or who this church will be made of right exactly and he says Thou Art Peter and upon this frog I'll build my church and and you know brother bran takes a lot of time to explain he's he didn't build it on Peter and he says he didn't build it on the flesh and blood right so praise the Lord I mean this church here is is not flesh and blood this church here is not Peter Simon by our Jonas right these are the people with new names right with a new life in them and then with this building material you can build a church he will build a church he because that's his church it's his own church right oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah and he says and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so he says if you want to see my own church then you have to see people who are reborn into a different kingdom yes yes they are not living in jet lag they're not living in Old civilization they're not living in the old ways they are not living in their own life because that's the old name that's that's Simon that's barjona right we're not living by this we're living by Peter right and and then brother Byram explains Peter is what Petros is is a stone it's a small Stone that's right it's not a big Stone it's a small Stone because we're so to speak we're we're uh the chips of an old block where where you know where ships of a big rock amen why is he here because he is a part of that rock he's he's a Rocco right but he's a small one how can you build the church on a small rock he's too small to build on it he's a part of that he's a pillar in the church right he's mentioned as a pillar of the church right but but he's not the only one right and then says he's not he didn't even build it on Jesus that's right right he built it on the revelation of who he was praise be to Jesus oh so this is this is how he builds his church he's building it on the people who are able to catch a revelation Hallelujah he's building it is using them as a building material the foundation is the revelation of Jesus Christ and then he uses those stones he cannot use all the stones but he can use those that are catching this channel of God right that's right that's right oh praise be to Jesus let's let's maybe read one quote he I love it but he explains Peter in questions and answers in Hebrews that's 1957 paragraph 169 and he says now watch flesh and blood has not revealed this to you Plumb over to the Lord Jesus says but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and Upon This Rock the revelation of Jesus Christ Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it that's what he said and he said uh and I say that you are Peter and I'll give you the Keys of the Kingdom amen amen amen that's another part of that scripture he says I give you the Keys of the Kingdom so so he in that church that Jesus builds he will have people who will not live by their natural ways he will not live they will not live by what the you know bar Journal said right that's right they will not live by flesh and blood they will be able to catch spiritual Revelations in an unpredicted uh context you know it wasn't a you know a classroom with homework you know so come on guys you know you know the homework so so who do you say I am no this was absolutely spontaneous I believe you know it was just a setting you know there maybe they've been shopping and eating or you know standing and talking or something and all of a sudden in a very simple context boom Peter gets the Revelation he gets the signal from above he gets this signal from the father from heaven so these people who Jesus will use as building materials for his own church who will be his church they will not live by the by the family name they will not live by uh flesh and blood they will receive uh those uh signals from heaven they will have a new name Peters not Simons praise be to Jesus and they'll also have the keys he was only a type of those members of the church they will have the keys and so here in the court I'll come continue to say and he says and I say you were Peter and I'll give to you the Keys of the Kingdom and whatever he says because you have got a spiritual open Channel between here and Heaven praise be to Jesus so that's the key if you have a channel open between you and Heaven between here in heaven and calls it a spiritual open channel functioning and that that's the key that's right amen and he says Flesh and Blood you never took a seminist seminary you never took a schooling you never took a course of theology but you depended on God and God revealed it to you and it's absolutely the clear scriptures that tied together I say your Peter and I'll give to you the keys and what you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven what you lose on Earth I'll lose in heaven hallelujah oh praise be to Jesus and the other message brother Brahm says in the questions uh oh sorry that's God of his evil age he says he unlocked something it was a mystery yeah Peter was able to unlock Mysteries that's the building materials we have in the in the Church of Jesus in the Church of Christ amen people who will be able to unlock Mysteries first of all in their own lives yeah because we are a walking mystery we we don't understand a lot of things you know going on in our lives right but God when he comes down he he he makes it plain to us through the word thank you Father Hallelujah so so what was the keys that Peter had you know we when we go back when we read Matthew 20 we read Matthew 16 he got the keys but he never used them uh until basically Acts 2 38 right because then he was filled with the Holy Ghost and when the challenge came and the people said so you know men and Brethren what shall we do you know what what shall we do now we crucified Christ what shall we do and then Peter came out under the same inspiration with the same key and he made three clicks repent amen and then and then you will receive the remission of your sins and then you will receive the Holy Ghost that's right three clicks of whatever you call that three turns of of the same key right repent remission of sins and then and then you got the Holy Ghost oh you know we we've read the scripture many times right we've been baptized in the water with the from the same scripture right and then uh uh so so what what what actually happens you know this the same principle from you know I've been reading this a month ago and I I thought but this is a principle of life I use the same key if I realize that I realized that just a not a long time ago I'm using the same key if I have it the the open Channel with with Christ I'm using the same key every day right because in every action in whatever you do you you first repent because you have to lose the old ways then you receive the permission of your remission of your sins you're forgiven you're free and then you fill that up with the Holy Ghost he fills that up with the Holy Ghost right oh praise the Lord this this happens every day I Die daily yeah Paul says brother Brown interprets it and he says me and Mita which says we stand on our knees and we say help us Lord Lord forgive us for whatever we've done he says we die daily amen praise the Lord so what do we do we empty Our Lives we we return you know we turn in the other direction right 180 degrees we we turn around we make this place empty of from whatever unbelief we had during the day right and then this empty place can be filled with more Holy Ghost Hallelujah so that's one of the keys that's the key you know that's that's the key we're using every day hallelujah oh you you know that's just like brogram says you know uh uh he says in the book of Isaiah 6 you know he he had to do the same thing right he had to repent he says oh Lord I'm I'm a man of unclean lips I live among the people who also have unclean lips right so what do I do I I feel sorry about right I repent for it and then there's a cleansing that comes from the surface and then there's a commission coming there's a feeling with the Holy Ghost so this is our daily life this is the key we use in the Kingdom to unlock more territory praise be to Jesus sometimes we get stuck in this because we don't want to repent we don't want to you know fix some things you know we want the remission of the sins but we don't want to repent well that's natural you know that starts from Adam you know he didn't want that he wanted permission of his sins every mission of your sins but he you know he he didn't want to repent you know oh but but you know Jesus he shows uh through Peter he shows the right process oh because when Jesus was leaving he actually said what should we preach in the in in the Gospel of Luke he says and and this Kingdom should be preaching repentance and remission of sins right this is the principle of the Kingdom this is the principle of the church that that Jesus is actually building this is what hinders us sometimes right as as human beings getting stuck in the Simon barjona uh you know uh uh part of it you know in that particular realm you know flesh and blood but then when we realize we're wrong we go forth we fix it that's right you make it right God forgives that and he fills that place with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah oh praise be to Jesus you know so so when when we read Peter in second Peter 1 when he uh takes the Pyramid of the virtues he uses the same key that's the same Peter with the same key right it says you you add to your faith virtue and then add this and add patience and all this how do we add this first we have to die to ourselves to to make room for God's virtue to God's patience God's knowledge to work through US amen amen and and this is how we achieve the Kingdom right this is how this this Open Access is given to us in into the kingdom of his son right oh praise be to Jesus thank you Father so so this is our daily life this is our daily principle oh thank you Jesus this this is how Jesus is actually building his church out of these kind of people oh it's so wonderful and it's really simple you know it's a it's a it's I mean as simple as that oh father so so when we when we read that we realize that Peter had the key and and this same key was actually uh given given to us as well you know and we we cannot produce that ourselves you know we cannot repent and we cannot remit sin our on our own and we cannot fill ourselves with the Holy Ghost right he has to do that he gives the repentance because true repentance is a gift it comes from God Amen hallelujah it's a moment of inspiration if someone when something strikes you and then you repent from there huh and then you how how do you receive you know freedom from your sins it's only God who can do that amen how do you get the Holy Ghost can you give somebody a Holy Ghost no he can give it to you amen that's his work oh praise be to Jesus and then and then when we we read this message of statue of a perfect man where brother interprets all the Pyramid of Virtues he says this is the man it says uh and this being completed is a servant of God in the Church of God right in the Church of Christ amen that he builds that's going in the rapture Hallelujah he calls it the seven steps right so how do we do that we we go by the same principle of the key we repent and then we receive the remission of our sins and then we this place in our lives is filled with more Holy Ghost that's why we sing I want more of Jesus right where I want more of him oh thank you Father so so this this is a wonderful message that we that that we have this this is something really astounding you know so uh so if we if we go back to uh to to this this scripture uh in in Matthew he says I will build my church and then this church will not be overcome by the gates of hell you know why because you cannot catch them on a uh on a fleshly realm this is basically where the devil Catches Us right on the on this level of Flesh and Blood Simon barjona right this is where he can defeat it easily easily seconds and this thought overcomes you seconds and this feeling fills you seconds in the sin is in you right why because we're still in the flesh and blood and we sometimes operate In the Flesh and Blood that's why we we lose the battles but then Jesus says I'll build my church out of these kind of materials right and he was a Capstone he was the main example of how that was happening if you read how uh how can I overcome what Bram says overcoming he says is uh is is trying to pertain the life in you right you you remember this old lock that says it was in the church it was in the in the in the woods but it was in and it was in the water but it says it was Hollow right it says it didn't retain the life in itself so so what we need to do is to we have to retain the life of Jesus Christ you know praise be to Jesus amen so so when when the devil he he came to defeat the Capstone of that church right and the Cornerstone of that church he showed us how to function not on the Flesh and Blood rail because you can you can imagine no Jesus he was just baptized freshly baptized you know some of you may have been uh freshly but we just had you know some people who have freshly baptized you know in in our country and and then that's Matthew 3 right when Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist you know and and then and then from then on he was led by the spirit from then on when this Dove uh descended upon him he was led by the spirit and he was led into a place which was not a nice place into a Wilderness into a desert but why did he go because he trusted the dove that's it right he was led by the dove he couldn't he couldn't grow himself anymore all right he he was led by the dove and so if the dove was leading him and the devil's saying now we have to fast for 40 days I mean this this was weird this was difficult this was hard on the body in that case but how did how did Jesus survive because he was led by the dove if if God led him into it he will he will survive right so and then we read it in in in Matthew 4 when he when the 40 days were over and then he in his flesh because he was a flesh man as well right it was he was brother says he was totally God and he was totally human right so so this man he was hungry after 40 days he was weak and then this moment of weakness of his flesh and blood this is when the Devil comes and and he has this idea he's he he has this nice idea he has a nice business plan for him actually it was it wasn't just an idea it was a whole business plan you know because he says now you're you're hungry Jesus was just 30 something years old you know it was a young man you know man they they hungry after a few hours you know and here's it's it's 40 days okay can you imagine that and so Jesus he when he goes through through that trial to be tried with the devil into Into the Wilderness he's weak in his flesh and blood and in that particular moment the gates of hell are coming the gates of hell are there and they have a proposal right there when you're weak when we're weak and he says no come on you're a Creator I've seen you operate before so why didn't you why don't you do this you just you just take the stone which is inedible but you can make you can make a bread out of it all right you can make a bread out of it you can make a daily bread out of it come on nobody in the wilderness no people around right nobody will see it nobody will even know you you did it you will know no you did it yeah right so this proposal this business idea comes into his head because I mean if somebody told you you know there's a lot of stone you know in this country here right and if you had a chance if you had a power of turning those stones into breads yeah that'll be a big business right so he's catching his mind not only in his you know hungry condition but also in how he can you know promote himself and have a nice business for himself you know there's a lot of stones in Israel you know so you can turn those all all of them in into into breadth oh my goodness and you're hungry you'll eat yourself but why did Jesus refuse because he was led of the dove and the dove didn't tell him to do it even though it made sense he would you know he you know the Bible says he can make sons of Abraham out of stones not only bread he's able to do that but he didn't do it why because the dove didn't lead him to do it he was trusting the dove so much and he didn't he he just ignored the devil what what what's that I mean you know the the the the purpose of fasting brother Brian says is to make you close to God make you weaker in the flesh but closer spiritually to God right because you're seeking for an answer or you know you you were praying for something so in this 40 days past the purpose of that wasn't to torment Jesus or make him suffer but to make him closer to God so he was so close to God he was actually able to uh to discern that this thought wasn't coming from the dove it wasn't coming from the father it wasn't the Father in Heaven who was revealing it it was a different spirit that was revealing so he he just she basically ignored it says what are you saying this is crazy I don't I don't need any bread here that's right I mean after 40 days you definitely came and ate something you know but at that particular moment you know when the devil wanted him to create those you know uh breads out those so he didn't do it he discerned it because he was fully reliant on the dove on the holy spirit that was anointing him and leading him let's change the scenario and what if he he was weak what if he what if he would respond to to to a suggestion like this well basically nothing wrong would happen you know he would just we would have a happy young man eating some bread but without the dove on it right the dove would leave you know he says I am not doing anything the father wouldn't show me since I first want to see the father do it and then I do it if the father showed him you there's a stone create create a bread out of it he would do it so if if Jesus you can imagine if Jesus lost all those three battles a young man who would probably be prone to do it you know in a context like this you know when the Devil Himself comes to talk to you and then he he we would finally in in chapter four at the end of the day bless you brother at the end of the day we would have a young man who who was eating bread enjoying his bread happy that he he created it from Stone right and then he he would get some adrenaline jumping from the uh from the temple right and then out he comes from the Wilderness with the whole world under his feet right because the devil in one of those attacks he says I'll give you the whole world all the real estate and everything you you have on the in the world I'll give it to you so out of the Wilderness Jesus would have come with some food with some adrenaline and with all the kingdoms of God I mean of the Earth given to you a happy fleshly men flesh and blood total Flesh and Blood total loud is here eating having fun and possessing something right oh but how did he come out he came out Victorious Hallelujah he came out Victorious he after he he suffered the attack he went and ate no problem God provides the daily bread Hallelujah he he program says he didn't have to take those kingdoms right then because he says he knew it belonged to him he he he he actually would take them in an unclean condition before the millennium right he would actually have to clean it foreign Kingdom if God offers you okay you just bury a little while and I'll give you a clean Earth oh all those things on the earth will be clean and then you can step on it with your bride oh praise be to Jesus he was victorious in all those attacks oh because why because he was not a son of Mary he was not a son of Joseph Hallelujah he was out of following the Flesh and Blood he was showing us how to hear the signals from Heaven he was showing to us how to overcome this this Capstone this Cornerstone of this church Hallelujah was showing the other Stones the other Peters they are the small rocks of how can we overcome as well oh praise be to Jesus aren't we happy this this church this church will not this is the church it will not be prevailed by the uh by by the gates of hell if they don't live in that that particular realm they live in a higher realm of revelation of of what the father reveals them this is what they do oh thank you Father and they'll have the keys right they'll open they'll they'll make more room for the kingdom they'll make more rooms for the kingdom Amen brother Sergey says you know this is somebody you know there's a new board of land here somebody building apartments here you know in front of your church well I said praise the Lord there may be new converts over there you know this this this may be a key to you know a broader Kingdom oh thank you Father Hallelujah because we don't possess the full Kingdom yet that's why we were still here on Earth oh but I I love this thing with boom Jesus says this church you know the Gates of Hell will not Prevail that kind of a church oh thank you and he gave us everything to do it he provided everything he gave the access he he gave us the permission of a remission of sins he gave you Faith he gave us love he gave us the Holy Spirit he gave us the spiritual Revelation and wisdom he he gave us discernment of the of the spirit oh thank you Father it's all available this this is the church this this is the bride and it's International oh this is this makes me even more happy you know this this is the reason why I'm here you know the best holiday like where the poll says is among his children amen is when you can have the leaves of Fellowship you know with with the other believers oh Hallelujah and even if those worms have eaten up that up ah he says I will restore no problem I have the life in that tree this life in the tree can produce all those things oh thank you Father Hallelujah thank you Father I was you know I was on the plane I was reading about Cain and Abel and I was so blessed to read it I said you know uh Abel he he was a part of those Church of the firstborn you know we're talking about the Jesus church you know we were talking about how he and he says you know you know Cain he was supposed to be the first born right but when he brought the gifts he didn't the Bible didn't say he brought the firstborn you know potatoes or something yeah you know he just brought the gifts you know of the land but Abel and it's mentioned in in Genesis 4 he brought the the firstborn of the sheep he had the Revelation why because he was the firstborn himself he he it wasn't Cain that he was first born Abel was firstborn he was he was in the mind of God before Cain was amen it is the Church of the firstborn he he knew him the importance of of the born-again experience back then in the times of when when they just came out of the uh Garden of Eden back then he knew that the firstborn the right of the firstborn the born-again experience the the the the Baptist is over the Holy Ghost is something that God will rejoice to receive right hallelujah oh thank you Father so so this is the Church of the firstborn right these are those that uh that are the descendants of Abel Hallelujah oh father thank you Father so so then when we follow on and then we read in in uh in the book of Hebrews that by faith yeah that's it able was able to bring this uh better sacrifice then came Hallelujah it wasn't uh it wasn't a matter of proving you know Cain is worse it's not that all right it's it's a matter of proving Abel is elected Abel is my son and by his Sacrifice by the revelation of it he proved he was righteous amen amen hallelujah oh Father Hallelujah isn't it wonderful God Gave You My revelation of what to do he knew from the very started it it was supposed to be sheep right he was a Shepherd himself oh Hallelujah and then God proved oh you're righteous because you can receive Revelations like this just like Peter you know was he more righteous than all those people who said you're Jeremiah you're this no he he had a better wording he had a better Revelation only because he was the son of God and that was a proof to him as well he became so confident he says he started you know controlling things in the next verses you know he's you know and then Jesus says come on Satan you know don't don't do it yet you know right yes so it gives us confidence as well you know Able by faith receive those things oh and God proved it in by by the gifts that he brought right oh thank you Father Hallelujah and then you remember worldbraham says speaks about Cain and he says uh he he should have just done the way his brother did that's it and God would receive it and he was still talking to him and he was still trying to persuade him he was still trying to bring him in hmm oh thank you Father and you know another thing I noticed this is just fresh and I'm sorry I'm I'm just you know sharing what was what's on my heart and I'm just reading it fresh you know for uh on on the plane uh losing all my jet lag immediately you know when you receive Revelation no gently [Music] I I noticed Abel didn't say a word in the whole Bible he he didn't say anything Cain said tons of things Eve said a lot of things Adam said things Abel said nothing you wouldn't you wouldn't find a word Abel said in his life right but then when he died amen this is when he started screaming this is when he started talking this is what he says his blood is still talking he is talking why because he's dead oh this is a paradox this is a paradox I tell you this is weird how can you talk when you're dead oh but but the Lord shows us in the Bible this is when you start talking this is when you start speaking this is when the token is on display brother Brahm says the token was you know the blood that was spilled when he he took he was in the field with his brother and they were talking imagine their conversation I I thought you know what what they were talking about you know because because by then again was envious he wasn't happy his countenance changed there's like labans just like you know everybody in the Bible you know Saul and all of them and the the this this other Spirit came upon him he wasn't happy me and all the brother you younger brother what are you talking about why did God confirm your gifts and your sacrifice not mine right that's it huh and brother Ben says he should have humbled himself there was no problem the younger brother received a better Revelation than you that's right no problem about that I'm happy when my young people in in my church receive a better Revelation than that yeah praise the Lord thank you Father amen so so so what happens and then then he they started talking in the field Kane was the initiator if you if you read the Bible Cain spoke to to Abel to his younger brother and then he he slew him all right so I imagine they were talking about the sacrifice probably because they he ended up putting him on the altar so you're talking about some death you you so so God He he'll receive the death he'll receive the blood right he won't receive the fruits he'll receive the blood do you really mean that oh man this is killed him and then the blood went into the Earth that's right that was feeding him all the time and then God says I'll I'll block the power of the earth to give you strength right oh when when the first blood was slain when when when Abel was slaying his lamb and the blood was spilling God didn't say it was wrong that's right right yeah but when Cain spilled the blood of his brother that was wrong right oh there's some good things in there you know praise the Lord thank you Father so so we're so happy to to see that Cape that Abel he started talking when he was dead this is where the life speaks this is where the blood speaks when we you know when there's so many people there approach you and they says so how can we make sure how can we make sure the token is on display the only answers is be dead and then the token will be speaking it'll be display Abel died so many thousand years ago but his blood still speaking hallelujah oh Hallelujah so this oh thank you Father thank you Father I don't even know how much time I'm standing here so you know I I probably better close you know because uh because I I believe the we we're part of the Church of the firstborn who are receiving the right Revelations from God understanding the plan of God in a very simple context very simple context amen hallelujah thank you Jesus very simple you know we're just in the church we just had a series on the on the Book of Judges you know because uh you know we've uh uh been studying the judge of all the Earth that came down in the seven angels and brother Bram says the same anointing that is on that judge is falling upon the people amen this is why he sent the Seven Ages this is why he sent the Seven Seals this is why he sent this this Prophet right because he wanted the anointing of the judge to fall upon the Book of Judges here you know the Book of Judges was always so negative for me I thought oh man this is so many bad things going on in there but there's so many good things in there as well there's so many good anointed people there and if you if you look at them they're simple all those judges basically simple no you know Royal origin somewhere you know lineage or not many of them were famous for something right they were just just simple men just even women right which received the anointing so the judge that came oh you know in the Book of Judges the judges were actually the deliverers they were not so much uh uh the juridical part of it you know as a judge you know as an advocate as a as a lawyer or something right as we perceive a judge you know with the wig and things like this they were also delivers the main things they were delivering other people from the Philistines so why did this judge of all the Earth come to to send his anointing upon simple people like you like me to be the deliverers for Israel amen do you remember this this is the judge I even forget his name it was mentioned a few times in the Bible and and he brought by him says those Philistines were coming and they were eating off his crops right shamgar thank you sister praise the Lord there's some anointed judges here amen Hallelujah shamgar remember he he says he was he he had the crops in his agricultural country here you you depend on the crops we depend on the crops as well right so he was he was having that for his uh for his uh family he was having that for his wife he says for his children every time the crop would go out here comes the Philippines to eat it off and one day brother Brandon says he became angry yeah so this it's not a big problem to become angry angry at the Devil actually right I won't stand this they will come in and eating that off anymore this is my family brother Brian says uh he realized he was an Israelite he was circumcised right brother man says what that does does that mean he had the Holy Ghost he says he says I'm not even a preacher I'm not even a pastor I'm not even a a minister he says I just a simple brother who has got the Holy Ghost and so I'll use anything that I have as an instrument here as my agricultural instrument that I use every day my connection my my my simple ways just like David he was using his his instrument right not somebody else's but his own instrument I'll use my instrument whatever it is you know if I use this instrument I'll kill 600 of them with this if I'm angry at the Devil and I want to deliver my family yes praise the Lord amen if the lord gave me this instrument the Lord give me this instrument the lord gave me this instrument this instrument this instrument whatever Hallelujah thank you Father stand in my position in Christ and I'll have the power in this position Hallelujah and this is how he protected his family and if you notice from then on the news game oh this this home is Anointed this family is Anointed I was passing by I saw 600 Corpses of the devils oh man he can deliver I thought this was just a simple farmer I thought this was just a simple shamgar I was passing by these these kids never had anything to eat all of a sudden this anointing comes on him oh thank you Father he's got an open channel of revelation of what to do with what right Hallelujah he was a simple man a random man from somewhere just like Samsung just like Deborah just like many of them in the Book of Judges right he was a simple man if you look at the you know uh what was the first instance where you can see uh the judge of all the Earth mentioned is the Book of Genesis right and who did he come to who did the anointing come to brother Brown says this Abraham well he was just sitting there In the Heat of the day you know 40 degrees celsius Idaho you know sweating out and all of a sudden he sees three men coming right this it was as simple as that no presidential you know something no no banquet no whatever just a simple man Abraham nobody sitting there sweating seeing three men oh this is the judge of all the Earth Hallelujah coming to me a simple man thank you Father and we've seen those judges in the times of brought the brown just like hit you right she was she was the one who caught the anointing right she was sending that program says at the porch somewhere the deacons and the trustees were sitting at the table and she was at the porch and he was talking about the the squirrels and things and she says this is nothing but the truth it was as simple as that and then the anointing of a deliverer comes upon her and she delivers then her children like shamgar like all of them oh Father Hallelujah this is the Church of the Living God this is how they operate they can catch those things from the heavenly father be anointed and then deliver the people just like Gideon and nobody from the least of the tribes full of complexes and fears and everything right and then God comes and he says and he encourages his faith he says you're a man of Valor you're strong you can do it with this power with this anointing that you have you will start destroying your own father's idols oh come on thank you Father Hallelujah and this is oh this is why the cloud came this is why the Angels Came to anoint simple people sometimes random people Hallelujah very few of them we were Noble the rest were just simple people but they were deliverers they were the judges they were he was he's the Messiah and we're the Messiahs he's the rock we're the small rocks the Peters thank you Father Hallelujah this is why we have the message and it has all the power in it it has all the anointing in it and no Gates of Hell I assure you brother Birmingham says ten thousand volts if it did with the Cornerstone with the Capstone it will do the same with the other stones Hallelujah if just we if we follow the same example oh thank you oh I'm just carried away in this inspiration we better stand and say thank you Father we will just pray Lord Jesus I thank you so much Lord I thank you Lord Jesus
