[31:49] amen I I just really appreciate the
[31:52] leadership of the Holy Spirit to just
[31:55] put that I I believe that fits right
[31:57] with what the Lord has led us to speak
[31:59] tonight and and uh so I just want to
[32:03] cover just a couple little things
[32:07] um so that everyone will know I know
[32:10] that there probably are some who did not
[32:12] get a chance to say about ordering seals
[32:16] books so we just ordered some extras but
[32:19] that order has now been placed but there
[32:22] will be opportunity uh for more in the
[32:25] future but I believe we have the
[32:28] body of Believers here covered and maybe
[32:31] an extra
[32:33] eight or ten books something in that
[32:35] range and if not we can always leverage
[32:39] our friendship with brother George to to
[32:42] get more so some of you I hope you don't
[32:45] mind but I took Liberty to order seals
[32:48] book for your children
[32:51] some of you maybe didn't do that but I
[32:55] know in the future you'll forgive me for
[32:57] being presumptuous and uh
[33:00] so uh we're just very happy to see our
[33:03] brother David his travels to to Central
[33:06] America uh and uh go down there where
[33:10] almost any place you would eat could
[33:12] make you sick but he saved it till he
[33:15] got home and uh and we actually thanked
[33:18] the Lord for that because I tell you
[33:20] there's nothing like being in a foreign
[33:23] country and finding yourself sick and
[33:27] you're there to do the work of God to
[33:29] perform the will of God and the devil
[33:32] trying to keep you from it and uh I have
[33:35] before been in a case where literally
[33:38] went to bed at night so sick I couldn't
[33:41] stay on my feet
[33:43] and have services in the morning and
[33:45] wake up in the morning feeling literally
[33:47] like a brand new man and knowing that
[33:50] the Lord is mindful of us and touches us
[33:54] amen
[33:56] so God bless you Sister April
[33:59] God bless you and please take greetings
[34:02] to the family amen we love and
[34:04] appreciate them very much okay let's go
[34:07] right into the thought tonight I want to
[34:09] thank you musicians uh God's blessing us
[34:12] more and more amen if the Lord tarries
[34:16] we we are going to really see what our
[34:20] blessings are amen I want to speak once
[34:23] again on our journey as we parallel
[34:25] we'll type these things as it is when
[34:28] Jesus was walking through the land and
[34:30] we know that he is walking through the
[34:32] land right now amen he is right here
[34:35] tonight with us amen walking right in
[34:38] our midst and it's all just for us to
[34:42] stop put the busyness of life to the
[34:45] side all the noise and and just to be
[34:48] able to stop and hear that still Small
[34:51] Voice and and uh by God's grace we hear
[34:55] that still small voice and I look up and
[34:58] uh we're happy you had a good trip glad
[35:01] to see you back safe glad that you know
[35:03] where you belong amen
[35:07] Luke the 17th chapter
[35:11] you know just in case nobody told you I
[35:13] was describing you sister Gabriella the
[35:15] other day
[35:17] as this little
[35:19] very cute very sweet little girl and I
[35:23] don't know where the time has gone I'm
[35:24] not saying that went away
[35:27] but
[35:28] um the time has went away and I was
[35:31] stunned the other day you know that
[35:33] sister Gabriella took a little trip all
[35:35] by herself out on the highway navigated
[35:37] herself made it there made it back
[35:40] of course my prayers were in the car
[35:44] the angel was hanging over the car in
[35:47] front of the car behind the car beside
[35:48] the car amen but it is a little shocking
[35:52] to see our children
[35:54] growing up so quickly and uh
[35:57] amen Luke 17 11-19
[36:01] and it came to pass as he went to
[36:03] Jerusalem that he passed through the
[36:05] midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he
[36:08] entered into a certain Village there met
[36:10] him 10 men that were lepers which stood
[36:14] afar off and they lifted up their voices
[36:17] and said Jesus master
[36:20] have mercy on us
[36:23] and when he saw them he said unto them
[36:28] you must have sinned
[36:31] there must be a reason this has come on
[36:33] you
[36:37] he didn't tow them to a mark
[36:40] he gave them Grace and he gave them
[36:42] Mercy
[36:44] because you see it's the devil that
[36:46] tries to put that every little thing
[36:48] that comes in your life
[36:51] must have been that yesterday you got
[36:53] frustrated over this and that's why this
[36:55] is happening
[36:57] no I'm sorry the scripture tells us
[36:59] these afflictions of life happen to the
[37:03] rich and to the poor and the righteous
[37:04] and the unrighteous and so it's in that
[37:08] realm my brother and sister that we know
[37:11] that the word of God is here to come and
[37:15] anoint you and I every step of this way
[37:18] it's not about how this must have been
[37:20] this or it must have been that it's God
[37:23] who's in control the devil is bound by
[37:27] the word of God Amen and we have been
[37:30] loosed by the word of God Amen
[37:34] Hallelujah
[37:35] Jesus Master have mercy on us and when
[37:38] he saw them he said unto them go show
[37:40] yourselves unto the priest and it came
[37:43] to pass that as they went they were
[37:45] cleansed and one of them when he saw
[37:49] that he was healed turned back and with
[37:51] a loud voice glorified God and fell down
[37:55] on his face at his feet giving him
[37:57] thanks and he was a Samaritan which
[38:00] would not normally be looked on as being
[38:03] a religious person amen Jesus answering
[38:07] said were there not ten cleansed but
[38:10] where are the nine they are not found
[38:13] that return to give glory to God save
[38:15] this stranger and he said unto him arise
[38:18] go thy way thy faith hath made thee
[38:21] whole Heavenly Father we ask Lord to
[38:24] blessings upon the service tonight just
[38:27] speak to our hearts Lord Make It Real to
[38:29] us Lord we love you and adore you and
[38:31] bless the bride of Christ Lord we pray
[38:33] amen you may be seated 9th
[38:37] I want to speak to you this evening
[38:40] on walking into our rest amen so there
[38:45] is a position that God has given and
[38:47] we'll touch on that I don't want to get
[38:49] ahead of myself but walking into our
[38:51] rest my brother and sister and I think
[38:53] there's nothing greater in an everyday
[38:57] blessing that God I say an everyday
[38:59] blessing that God gives us that the fact
[39:02] that he put us in a position or allowed
[39:04] us to come into a position that we can
[39:07] find rest from the world that we live in
[39:10] from the cares the songs that brother
[39:12] Alex was led to sing tonight I felt went
[39:14] along with this amen we're in
[39:16] mountaintops we're in valleys but he
[39:18] reaches down his hand amen and so it's
[39:21] there that God by his grace and mercy
[39:23] when he said that you know I'll never
[39:25] leave you nor forsake you that was not
[39:28] just conversation my brother and sister
[39:29] that was a a vow if you would that God
[39:33] committed himself to you and I now I've
[39:36] used this scripture and preached it many
[39:37] times and and I just trust tonight and
[39:40] just along in the thoughts of a journey
[39:43] here it just so struck me a few days ago
[39:46] oh more like a few weeks ago as it is to
[39:50] just see how that God has has uh hidden
[39:53] in his word uh so many stories so many
[39:57] things that we could see in our day and
[39:59] and be able to relate to amen now we
[40:02] look at this and you know brother Chris
[40:04] preached a few Wednesdays ago on our
[40:07] humanity and you know if we're not
[40:09] careful we put such a high pedestal uh
[40:13] to to uh or standard to reach and I
[40:16] don't believe we should set that
[40:17] standard low my brother and sister I
[40:19] don't believe that we should settle for
[40:21] just a half-hearted uh uh uh uh personal
[40:26] relationship with the Lord but we just
[40:29] have to understand in our human Humanity
[40:31] that that God knows where we stand and
[40:34] knows our circumstance and these uh
[40:37] lepers you know lepers in that day were
[40:40] are set aside or cast aside from the
[40:43] rest of humanity and in public they had
[40:46] to give the Cry of unclean unclean and
[40:50] so this Cry of unclean could be heard
[40:53] any time that they were in the midst of
[40:55] the people and it's there my brother and
[40:58] sister we find how remarkable it is that
[41:01] that God allowed them it wasn't in the
[41:04] Heart of the City it wasn't on the steps
[41:07] of the temple as it were it wasn't in a
[41:10] face of a great crowd but it was there
[41:13] outside coming in as it were that they
[41:16] are there and as though they knew he was
[41:19] coming and they are there and my brother
[41:22] and sister you can hear this voice being
[41:25] raised now we have to understand and
[41:28] think about this we can just look in
[41:30] life and find it you know when
[41:33] when you are in a certain position in
[41:36] life there are spirits that would
[41:39] attract us or pull us and so my brother
[41:42] and sister these ten lepers being
[41:44] together is of no surprise because they
[41:48] had something in common and it was there
[41:50] that will uh the Lord will remind me
[41:53] we'll touch on a little something more
[41:55] in common now it's there that they are
[41:58] now traveling as a group because they
[42:00] are outcasts and it's there that we'll
[42:03] find in the world today that the spirits
[42:06] of the age tend to draw people of the
[42:09] Same Spirit together so when you find
[42:12] someone that has a certain peculiar
[42:15] thing that controls their life you will
[42:18] no doubt find around them more people
[42:21] that have a very similar deal because
[42:24] those Spirits as we see when brother
[42:26] Branham was casting out demons in
[42:29] service he's there speaking to a woman
[42:31] with cancer and then he stops there's a
[42:34] little pause in the tape and he is
[42:36] seeing this Spirit on this woman crying
[42:40] out to a woman with the same health
[42:43] issue with the same cancer and so what
[42:47] it was is as as uh you know uh brother
[42:51] Ron Spencer says poor dumb devil he was
[42:54] there crying for help but all he did is
[42:57] expose his friend amen and what happened
[43:00] is they both got cast out but you see
[43:03] that they were looking for that
[43:04] continuity of support to go together
[43:07] that's why it's important that we as
[43:09] Sons and Daughters of God hang out with
[43:12] sons and daughters of God Amen and even
[43:14] among Sons and Daughters of God
[43:16] sometimes my brother and sister we would
[43:19] look and say well I don't really
[43:21] personality wise find myself real
[43:23] compatible with this family or with this
[43:26] individual but you need to put that
[43:29] aside and recognize that our position in
[43:32] the family of God is more important than
[43:34] personality amen because because while
[43:37] that personality grates on you maybe
[43:39] your personality is actually grading on
[43:42] them at the same time and by grace of
[43:44] God there'll be a pile of sawdust where
[43:46] you're both got brought smooth amen or
[43:49] Rock savings or metal filings or
[43:52] whatever you want to account to yourself
[43:54] amen you know that's why God does that
[43:57] you know he kind of puts you in a
[43:58] position sometimes to just work the
[44:00] rough edges off of us amen and I tell
[44:03] you sometimes as a pastor you know you
[44:06] just feel like that you are being rubbed
[44:08] every which way and you know we'd like
[44:10] to say Well it must be brother Trevor
[44:12] and sister Kerry's fault it must be
[44:14] sister April's fault it must be sister
[44:16] Ruth's fault but what it is is actually
[44:18] God knows what this man needs and I need
[44:22] more than I thought I needed my oh my so
[44:25] when you get around to complaining about
[44:27] what's happening just recognize that God
[44:30] knows you needed more than you thought
[44:32] you needed oh my say thank you Lord amen
[44:36] how Hallelujah my nose is tickling me um
[44:41] so they're standing afar off and they're
[44:43] raising their voice my brother and
[44:45] sister they were not bashful they didn't
[44:47] in a very timid well if he hears us
[44:50] maybe something will happen they came to
[44:54] him or in that time frame and they had a
[44:57] need oh can someone lift a hand and say
[44:59] Lord tonight I have a need amen and if
[45:02] they would lift their voice and cry out
[45:05] Jesus master
[45:09] oh what would be hindering us the bride
[45:11] of Christ tonight be able to lift our
[45:13] voice and say Jesus Master have mercy on
[45:17] me and I lift my hands and I and say
[45:20] Lord have mercy on me amen I need you
[45:24] Lord It's the songs tonight that we sung
[45:26] Give us a very clear picture I need you
[45:30] Lord my brother and sister they have the
[45:32] identity correct they didn't say oh you
[45:35] know uh important man or spiritual man
[45:38] or whatever they knew who they were
[45:42] talking to and aren't you glad tonight
[45:44] that by God's grace and mercy we're not
[45:47] sitting here trying to chop God up into
[45:49] pieces we're not trying to understand
[45:51] these relationships and put these things
[45:53] to the fact that we have deities and PDS
[45:56] and all kinds of whatever to our name
[45:58] and we just stop and say well it's too
[46:00] complicated to explain I have a personal
[46:04] relationship with Jesus Christ you have
[46:07] a personal relationship with Jesus
[46:09] Christ I didn't go to my father as it
[46:12] was and say I'm not sure what to call
[46:15] you
[46:18] I don't stand in front of a mirror and
[46:20] look at myself and say I don't know how
[46:22] to identify you
[46:24] God's given us a clear picture this is
[46:27] our lord Jesus he's the master he's a
[46:31] master of the wind Master of the Waves
[46:33] Master of the heaven he's a Healer he's
[46:35] the provider he's everything we need we
[46:38] know his position
[46:41] he's not just a holy man
[46:43] he is the man as brother George would
[46:46] say he is the man
[46:48] oh my Hallelujah
[46:50] amen his name Jesus his position Master
[46:56] they had that correct amen and I'm just
[46:59] going to say this tonight if you don't
[47:00] mind me putting it this way if we came
[47:03] hungry tonight can somebody say I'm
[47:05] hungry amen if we came hungry tonight
[47:08] and we have needs tonight we should be
[47:11] following their example and lift our
[47:14] voice amen and cry out to the master and
[47:17] say have a need tonight Lord and I need
[47:19] you to come on this scene and I need you
[47:21] to touch that need and Lord you know
[47:23] what the need is I don't have to post it
[47:25] to the heavens I don't have to declare
[47:27] it to the whole world you know my need
[47:30] and Lord I'm asking you you are my Lord
[47:33] You're my master and I'm asking you Lord
[47:36] come touch my need
[47:39] amen I tell you my brother and sister
[47:41] it's there it's in the word it's in the
[47:44] message it's all over in front of us
[47:47] sometimes we need to find it if you're a
[47:50] little bashful you're a little shy
[47:52] you're not comfortable being real public
[47:54] about it then you will find you a corner
[47:56] you go find you a room you go find the
[48:00] back corner of the yard or whatever it
[48:02] might be and lift your voice and talk to
[48:04] him amen if you say well I just couldn't
[48:07] publicly I just I freeze up and then
[48:10] find you a place then you're comfortable
[48:13] with and cry out to him and say Lord
[48:16] You're my master and I have a need today
[48:20] it might be Daniel it might be Christian
[48:22] Demi it might be you know uh uh I forgot
[48:26] your Elder son
[48:28] every time
[48:31] anyway whatever it might be that might
[48:34] be the burden Sydney Mason it might be
[48:37] the burden that's on us but come to a
[48:39] place Saints don't offer yourself an
[48:42] excuse and say I would but just find the
[48:45] place and cry out amen he's here to hear
[48:49] our voice
[48:50] amen
[48:52] it makes me think of of a brother
[48:54] sergey's friend amen after years here
[48:57] just some things have brought about some
[49:00] uh contact my brother and sister God
[49:03] knows what he's doing we don't always
[49:05] understand all of the pieces amen of the
[49:08] deal I watched a little video recently
[49:10] this young man is from over there in
[49:12] Europe somewhere uh one of the Slovakian
[49:15] countries he's he's considered one of
[49:17] the new Geniuses at chess and and here
[49:20] he is playing chess and he's playing
[49:22] against very experienced people and he
[49:25] he moves into such a fashion that the
[49:28] commentators are saying that was
[49:30] ridiculous what is he doing
[49:32] but he laid the consummate trap for the
[49:36] opponent and the opponent thought this
[49:39] guy's not nearly as good as he said he
[49:41] is look at this ridiculous move he's
[49:43] made and it's over well I'll tell you my
[49:46] brother and sister we ought to come with
[49:49] a kind of a confidence that we can step
[49:51] out regardless of where God leads you
[49:54] and I what step he asks you to take we
[49:57] ought to step out in that knowing he's
[50:00] not putting us in the Trap he's putting
[50:03] Satan in the Trap he's not springing it
[50:05] on you and I he's springing it on the
[50:08] devil amen and we would kind of feel
[50:10] like we feel the furnace from here we
[50:13] kind of feel like we feel the cold from
[50:16] here but I'm telling you he said I'll
[50:19] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[50:21] and I never put you out to be prey to
[50:24] the enemy oh Hallelujah
[50:27] my Lord help me to trust you
[50:30] I'll tell you what so what happens Jesus
[50:34] does not give them a speech about why
[50:37] are you here or what brought you to this
[50:40] place but he simply tells them he says
[50:44] to them go show yourselves unto the
[50:47] priest
[50:48] my brother and sister they were there
[50:50] and we know that obedience brings
[50:53] results can someone say Amen to that
[50:56] obedience we are not legalists this is
[50:59] the problem that many people have they
[51:02] believe if you're obedient to the word
[51:04] of God there must be some kind of
[51:07] legalist Foundation behind it to force
[51:10] you to do it but I if I could tear my
[51:12] chest open tonight and expose it to you
[51:15] you would see that God has written
[51:18] something on the fleshly table of this
[51:21] heart it's not my brother and sister the
[51:24] will of man it is not the force of man
[51:26] it's not the pressure of tears but it is
[51:30] a desire to fulfill because it was by
[51:34] God's grace he wrote on our hearts amen
[51:37] it wasn't by force of nature but it was
[51:39] Grace that he said I'm going to write on
[51:42] you
[51:43] and that indelible writing that's placed
[51:46] in our hearts my brother and sister is
[51:48] what causes us to have such a desire to
[51:52] serve him
[51:53] the world cannot comprehend this
[51:57] and we'll get into it my my sermon might
[51:59] seem a little pointed here in a little
[52:01] bit but I want you to catch the point
[52:04] that there's a reason my brother and
[52:06] sister that you're different there's a
[52:09] reason we're not just strange people
[52:10] attracted to what the world thinks is a
[52:13] strange religion but there's something
[52:15] down inside of you that you look into
[52:18] the word because if we couldn't find it
[52:20] in the word we'd be gone I know that's
[52:23] kind of a blunt way to put it but if it
[52:25] wasn't in the word I would be gone amen
[52:28] because as brother George says I love
[52:30] this sorry to throw you under the bus
[52:31] brother George but brother George puts
[52:33] it this way if this is not that that the
[52:37] scripture spoke of let's go find it
[52:42] we're not going to just sit and say well
[52:44] it's close
[52:46] it might do it it's kind of doing it no
[52:49] sir there's something in us such a
[52:52] desire for truth that if this is not it
[52:55] let's search out what is it and there is
[52:59] nothing
[53:00] my brother and sister they have nothing
[53:03] to offer
[53:07] and if you don't think of that sister
[53:09] April made me think of this I'll send it
[53:10] to you
[53:13] article talking about how the coronation
[53:17] of Charles
[53:22] they pulled them all together
[53:26] Hindus and Buddhists
[53:29] Catholics and
[53:30] write down the list
[53:33] and he makes a statement back here a
[53:35] little bit in time
[53:37] he's going to be a defender of the faith
[53:39] and at that time people thought oh
[53:42] Charles gonna rise up I mean the guy's
[53:44] got a very checkered history
[53:47] you know we're not even followers of
[53:49] royalty my brother and sister and it's
[53:51] hard to miss all of the anyway
[53:55] and uh so he says I'm a defender of the
[53:57] faith and everybody thought he's going
[53:59] to stand up and defend the Anglican
[54:00] Church
[54:02] no sir his idea of faith
[54:05] is everything mixed together
[54:08] but we know my brother and sister that
[54:11] when you mix all of this together
[54:12] there's one that comes out on top like
[54:16] oil and water
[54:17] so they think they're all coming back to
[54:20] blend their faith together but what they
[54:22] don't know it's upon their faith that
[54:25] the foundation that that is going to be
[54:28] built upon that takes over or tries to
[54:30] take over the world Amen so what they're
[54:33] doing is they're actually submitting
[54:36] while they think they're cooperating and
[54:39] it's always uh pardon me for putting it
[54:41] this way but I always read with interest
[54:43] of financial papers because it's like so
[54:46] and so and so and so merged and they
[54:48] always make it sound like it's two
[54:49] friends deciding let's do business
[54:51] together but the merge usually has one
[54:54] company's foot on top of the forehead of
[54:56] the other one amen it's like either
[54:58] merge or we'll put you out of business
[55:01] my brother and sister so they're merging
[55:05] huh imagine that sign of the time
[55:10] coming together
[55:11] as it was in the days of Sodom so shall
[55:14] it be the coming of Son of Man
[55:17] my brother and sister as far as the
[55:19] human interpretation of that scripture
[55:21] goes that could be this very second
[55:28] you realize in England
[55:30] there was a child that was being forced
[55:32] to participate
[55:34] with some kind of sordid Adventure at
[55:37] school and the parents protested in the
[55:39] high court of England said the child
[55:42] will participate or we'll take the child
[55:44] from you
[55:47] court ordered
[55:50] what is a word that's publicly that is
[55:53] so strong
[55:55] to find shocking I I don't know what
[55:57] that word is I'll let you conjure in
[55:59] your own mind
[56:00] so I don't have to say it out loud
[56:02] absolutely agree it is my brother and
[56:04] sister you don't own your child anymore
[56:06] we do I'm sorry devil our children were
[56:10] given to the Lord Jesus Christ they are
[56:13] already going to title they're already
[56:15] identified there's already a personal
[56:18] possession it's not up to you to decide
[56:21] that you get to claim them because
[56:23] they're already been placed under the
[56:26] blood and not just a little dab on a
[56:28] forehead as it was but a cleansing of
[56:30] the blood of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah
[56:34] my so look at this one of them
[56:37] when he saw that he was healed turns
[56:39] back
[56:40] isn't that amazing it's only one out of
[56:43] ten
[56:44] there's some significance but we won't
[56:46] go into all that tonight or we'll be
[56:48] here for a long time you see I want to
[56:51] focus for a moment this one my brother
[56:53] and sister that is there he is different
[56:57] but we're going to step away from him
[56:59] for just a moment okay because he's the
[57:02] minority and we never focus on
[57:03] minorities do we we always want to
[57:06] listen to the voice of the majority
[57:08] because the majority must be right
[57:12] hmm
[57:14] you see my brother and sister these nine
[57:17] were obedient
[57:19] are you with me
[57:21] Jesus said go show yourself to the
[57:24] priest they didn't say well I didn't I
[57:26] want to tie this earlier I said remind
[57:28] me Lord you see they didn't say I
[57:29] haven't been in church in years because
[57:31] I'm a leper I don't even really believe
[57:32] no what did they do and he said go show
[57:34] you the priest they were like okay
[57:37] that's what we're gonna do you know
[57:39] what's going to happen here we are going
[57:41] to go show ourselves to the priests and
[57:43] we don't really know what's going but
[57:45] we're going to do what he told him they
[57:46] start walking they're headed into town
[57:48] to show themselves they're going back to
[57:50] church my brother and sister they've
[57:52] been away for a while they're going back
[57:54] to church and all of a sudden they look
[57:55] out and there there's no leprosy and
[57:58] they start looking at each other and
[57:59] there's no leprosy my brother and sister
[58:01] they became first-hand witnesses to the
[58:06] power of the Majesty of almighty God but
[58:10] you see the difference it was between
[58:11] them and the one was they went back to
[58:16] where they came from without a question
[58:18] and you say where are you going with
[58:20] this brother Paul well I tell you my
[58:22] brother and sister early and brother
[58:23] branham's Ministry when there was no
[58:25] message churches brother Branham sent
[58:28] them back go back to your church go back
[58:31] to your church go back to your church
[58:33] and I have met and personally set and
[58:36] visited with these people now elderly
[58:39] some of them many of them passed away
[58:41] now but you see they were there and they
[58:43] went back to their church and they sat
[58:45] there on the Pew and they were there and
[58:48] they starved to death and they were
[58:50] getting spiritually skinny getting
[58:51] spiritually skinny and they remembered
[58:54] also that they were Witnesses and they
[58:57] rose up from that position because they
[59:00] could not stay there they knew something
[59:02] in their life had changed and they had
[59:05] to go find what that change was but
[59:08] these nine
[59:10] they never reappear
[59:14] but I'll tell you what they did do they
[59:16] went showed themselves to the priest
[59:18] the priest by the law
[59:22] had to examine them
[59:25] in an intimate fashion in other words
[59:27] they had to be stripped of their
[59:29] clothing
[59:30] and every portion of their Anatomy as it
[59:32] were given the visual that it's just not
[59:37] the leprosy left your arm
[59:39] or your face or your ears or your nose
[59:41] but you're clean
[59:43] and when they were clean by purification
[59:46] they were even a time period before they
[59:48] can enter into the congregation
[59:51] but they did
[59:55] but they sit in church
[59:57] I hope this is not offensive to anyone
[59:59] they sit in church we were with the
[1:00:01] prophet
[1:00:02] we saw the supernatural I saw the
[1:00:05] healing power I saw people delivered I
[1:00:08] saw this I am a witness I myself was
[1:00:10] healed of leprosy I saw this but it
[1:00:14] never moved them out of their position
[1:00:16] they never changed they went right back
[1:00:19] to the same church the same Pew the same
[1:00:21] priest and that is a priest that had
[1:00:23] held them under the law never let them
[1:00:25] out from underneath the law controlled
[1:00:28] them by the law my brother and sister
[1:00:30] never come to the Fulfillment of the law
[1:00:33] but preached to them every Wednesday and
[1:00:36] every Sunday this is how it is this is
[1:00:39] how it is and they were there and they
[1:00:41] were able to set under that anointing
[1:00:43] and say oh I saw the supernatural I've
[1:00:48] saw this I've saw God move praise the
[1:00:51] Lord and I'm going to heal and that's
[1:00:53] the evidence that I've got it
[1:00:58] but never left their Church
[1:01:00] that the very one that healed them
[1:01:04] desired to deliver them
[1:01:08] but they were happy to go back
[1:01:14] I tried to be very politically correct
[1:01:16] saying that I hope I achieved that
[1:01:20] my brother and sister the prophet of God
[1:01:22] told us the word
[1:01:23] never stops
[1:01:28] do you realize if those men a month
[1:01:30] later
[1:01:31] would have had a little flash now just
[1:01:33] take this for very Simplicity and got up
[1:01:36] and walked back to the very place that
[1:01:39] they had met Jesus
[1:01:42] would they find him
[1:01:46] the word
[1:01:48] keeps moving
[1:01:52] we can go back
[1:01:53] we can say what we want is services like
[1:01:56] this
[1:01:58] remember when Brothers so-and-so
[1:01:59] preached and the altar was full and we
[1:02:02] were also my brother and sister
[1:02:04] you can't go back
[1:02:07] he said I'll be right here
[1:02:09] we want a supernatural event in our life
[1:02:13] our family our church
[1:02:15] find it right here find it now not
[1:02:18] yesterday not looking back somewhere my
[1:02:21] brother and sister it's there that God
[1:02:23] is moving in our midst and he's waiting
[1:02:25] for you and I to trust him
[1:02:28] he said I will lead you and guide you
[1:02:30] I'll never forsake you we don't need to
[1:02:32] be afraid that God's going to let us get
[1:02:34] out there so far and we're just going to
[1:02:36] drift off into nothing we can't do it
[1:02:39] the word of God cannot let you and I the
[1:02:42] prophet of God said you cannot be
[1:02:44] deceived because you are the word oh
[1:02:48] that ought to get somebody excited I am
[1:02:51] the word amen
[1:02:54] and I'm not talking about just run off
[1:02:56] and chase after this that and the other
[1:02:58] my brother and sister don't
[1:02:59] misunderstand me you should know be my
[1:03:01] now amen but look at this they were
[1:03:03] there and at their word amen they would
[1:03:06] be able to say we personally got the
[1:03:08] word
[1:03:10] I'll be just a little Bolder I'll be a
[1:03:12] little more blunt
[1:03:13] I've encountered many a person
[1:03:17] That by The Virtue of saying I was with
[1:03:20] the prophet expected you to believe what
[1:03:24] they were saying I was there
[1:03:26] don't tell me about what you think you
[1:03:28] understand I was there well I'll tell
[1:03:31] you you want the testimony of nine or do
[1:03:34] you want to go find this one brother
[1:03:35] who's now no longer in their fellowship
[1:03:38] and ask him what it was amen not only
[1:03:42] did he there he got what was there it's
[1:03:46] not enough just to be there but we've
[1:03:48] got to get what was there
[1:03:51] did that make sense
[1:03:52] amen so it's there what their personal
[1:03:55] witness of the words of the master
[1:03:58] and look at this lovely defense
[1:04:02] you see God will never judge us without
[1:04:03] already revealing or showing us look at
[1:04:07] this defense
[1:04:10] we went back
[1:04:12] said under the same old priests same old
[1:04:14] message same old sermon went right to
[1:04:16] act to the same old life but we did
[1:04:18] exactly
[1:04:20] what we were told
[1:04:24] well if I told you to jump off the roof
[1:04:26] today
[1:04:28] would you say well Brother Paul's our
[1:04:30] pastor I'm obligated to jump off this
[1:04:32] roof
[1:04:33] no sir you would say brother Paul
[1:04:36] take me back to the word
[1:04:38] show me where you
[1:04:41] hmm
[1:04:43] but people he said so I'm going to do
[1:04:46] exactly what I was told
[1:04:48] why are you in the hospital I jumped off
[1:04:51] a roof
[1:04:54] imagine
[1:04:57] you see they could say by this ministry
[1:04:59] our lives were completely changed we've
[1:05:02] been healed I've been a leper for years
[1:05:03] completely changed my brother and sister
[1:05:06] but I'll tell you the prophet of God
[1:05:08] speaks about this and they were not
[1:05:10] drawn to Jesus himself you notice how
[1:05:13] easily they walked away they were not
[1:05:16] drawn to Jesus himself they were
[1:05:18] actually drawn to the miracle they were
[1:05:20] drawn to the story that had been told
[1:05:23] that he has prayed for this one he's
[1:05:25] prayed for that when they were healed
[1:05:28] and they knew that he was a Healer and
[1:05:30] so they come for the supernatural
[1:05:33] Miracle of healing they didn't come for
[1:05:36] any other reason now look some of us I'm
[1:05:38] not going to speak derogatory but some
[1:05:40] of us are a little slow on the uptake
[1:05:42] right and this other leper here was just
[1:05:46] a tad bit slow on the uptake amen he was
[1:05:49] there just like them he's with his
[1:05:51] friends and when he says go show
[1:05:53] yourself to the priest he starts to walk
[1:05:56] down the road he he's headed to the
[1:05:58] priest now but he gets down the road
[1:06:00] just a little ways just like you and I
[1:06:03] did after we were introduced to the word
[1:06:05] of the hour we got down the road a
[1:06:07] little ways and we realized I can't live
[1:06:10] without this the everything that means
[1:06:12] anything to me is not here it's here and
[1:06:15] he got down the road a little ways and
[1:06:17] he looked down and saw the leprosy
[1:06:20] falling away from him and I want to put
[1:06:22] it another time and he'll start walking
[1:06:24] down the road a little ways and we start
[1:06:27] to see the uncleanness we start to see
[1:06:29] the filthiness we start to see that
[1:06:32] we're once we walked and said unclean
[1:06:34] all we could say about ourselves unclean
[1:06:37] unclean unclean but we saw it Falling
[1:06:40] Away we saw the desires loss of the
[1:06:44] flesh pride of life all of this starting
[1:06:46] to fall away and something the scales
[1:06:49] come off of his eyes it wasn't just
[1:06:51] leprosy that left him Saint it was a
[1:06:54] scale that was on his eyes come off and
[1:06:57] that was binding his ears come off and
[1:07:00] he was there and said he told me to go
[1:07:03] to the priest and he turns around
[1:07:07] and he starts heading back why he had
[1:07:10] just had a revelation of who his priest
[1:07:14] was his preach that's not down there in
[1:07:16] the temple his priest was standing out
[1:07:19] here in a dirty Dusty Old Road in the
[1:07:22] middle of nowhere and he turns around
[1:07:24] and he goes back and he kneels before
[1:07:27] and submits himself to the priest now my
[1:07:31] brother and sister each one of those the
[1:07:33] one or the nine could say I did exactly
[1:07:36] as I was told but the same words yielded
[1:07:40] a different revelation
[1:07:43] you wonder why that you're different you
[1:07:46] wonder the devil tries to make you say
[1:07:48] you know why are you out here where
[1:07:50] you're at but I'm telling you when Jesus
[1:07:52] speaks not everyone hears what you hear
[1:07:56] no one my brother and sister can control
[1:07:59] that it's a gift from almighty God
[1:08:02] it's a blessing that God has given but
[1:08:05] you see there's some as a scripture says
[1:08:08] some come for the fishes and the loaves
[1:08:10] my brother and sister
[1:08:12] but look how this is
[1:08:14] this priesthood that they were going to
[1:08:16] go show themselves too
[1:08:18] no doubt had had years maybe Generations
[1:08:21] to change their lives
[1:08:23] but it held them to the law
[1:08:27] but even that priesthood was unable
[1:08:30] to fulfill the law
[1:08:33] because what's up here
[1:08:36] has got to make it down here
[1:08:40] do you realize how big a roadblock that
[1:08:42] is
[1:08:44] I'll tell you how big that roadblock is
[1:08:47] God said that roadblock getting it from
[1:08:49] our mind to our heart is so big that
[1:08:52] instead of trying to do this I'm just
[1:08:55] going to come and pardon me for doing
[1:08:56] this I'm just going to put it this way
[1:08:59] I'm gonna come down here and I'm just
[1:09:01] going to write it on you
[1:09:03] and I'm going to ride it on you you you
[1:09:06] you you you I'm going to do that for you
[1:09:09] to get it out of the mind and get it
[1:09:11] down in the heart because once you
[1:09:14] recognize there's something down in your
[1:09:16] heart you turn around and you go right
[1:09:19] back to the one priest that matters to
[1:09:21] you and I the one priest that makes a
[1:09:23] difference the one priest that is more
[1:09:25] than just a Healer amen you can be
[1:09:28] healed in this flesh my brother and
[1:09:30] sister and be tormented in your mind the
[1:09:32] rest of your life you can be healed in
[1:09:35] this flesh and have all kinds of other
[1:09:37] issues in your life that are never dealt
[1:09:40] with and I say oh God help us to be like
[1:09:44] this one that come and he fell down
[1:09:46] verse 16 fell down on his feet and given
[1:09:49] him thanks and he was a Samaritan amen
[1:09:52] what is it by Revelation he saw aren't
[1:09:55] you glad today the prophet of God said
[1:09:57] the first and foremost you ought to pray
[1:09:59] for is revelation amen not be praying
[1:10:03] that I can explain explain all the
[1:10:04] doctrine and that I can do all of this
[1:10:06] and I can do all of that be a scholar in
[1:10:09] this message no my brother and sister
[1:10:11] the Revelation the word of God shows us
[1:10:14] so clearly Prophet elaborates on it you
[1:10:17] cannot explain this to someone we get so
[1:10:21] caught up amen we get so caught up
[1:10:24] trying to explain it but the prophet
[1:10:26] said you can't explain it it's a
[1:10:29] revelation of the Holy Ghost to you oh
[1:10:33] somebody give him thanks amen it's a
[1:10:36] revelation of the Holy Ghost to you my
[1:10:39] brother and sister that cannot be
[1:10:41] explained if they have a seed Gene just
[1:10:44] like this one had a c Gene something
[1:10:47] Sparks inside there and they say this is
[1:10:50] different but everything else I've ever
[1:10:53] tried didn't work I'll try it
[1:10:56] oh at least that's how they think it in
[1:10:58] their mind little do they know God's
[1:11:01] turned them around and they're walking
[1:11:02] back
[1:11:04] to their priest
[1:11:05] my thank you Lord
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:09] well I'll tell you what I'm glad tonight
[1:11:12] we've got a high priest of our
[1:11:14] profession amen the prophet of God says
[1:11:17] that profession there in Hebrews is
[1:11:20] confession amen and it's not confessed
[1:11:23] or it comes out of your lips amen you
[1:11:25] can have somebody that's killed somebody
[1:11:27] or robbed somebody and the policeman's
[1:11:29] air interrogating them and you know says
[1:11:31] okay did you kill this person and if the
[1:11:33] person just sits there they know he did
[1:11:35] it they're not guessing they know but
[1:11:37] unless it comes from their lips
[1:11:41] it's not a confession
[1:11:44] did you kill him
[1:11:46] uh
[1:11:48] it's not confession
[1:11:49] oh you know that's been to court
[1:11:52] because people
[1:11:54] they'd say well
[1:11:56] I'll give an answer it just won't be
[1:11:57] legible
[1:11:58] intelligible
[1:12:00] I just give
[1:12:01] the court comes along later says no that
[1:12:03] wasn't an answer
[1:12:05] it's got to come from their lips it's
[1:12:06] got to be
[1:12:07] intelligent it's got to be an utterance
[1:12:10] that can be understood or it's not a
[1:12:12] confession are you with me
[1:12:15] oh he's the high priest of our
[1:12:18] confession profession come on Saints
[1:12:22] let's make sure whether it's the quiet
[1:12:24] time I was talking to you about earlier
[1:12:26] or whatever it is out loud or inquired
[1:12:28] make sure it comes from your lips make
[1:12:30] sure you say those words Lord you are my
[1:12:33] Lord and Savior My Healer my provider
[1:12:36] you're my everything
[1:12:38] let it come from your lips
[1:12:41] amen Hebrews 3 1 amen fits that I don't
[1:12:45] know dear brothers did you put Hebrews 3
[1:12:47] 1 up wherefore holy Brethren amen not a
[1:12:50] bunch of unbelievers holy Brethren
[1:12:52] partakers of the Heavenly calling
[1:12:54] consider the Apostle and high priest of
[1:12:56] our profession Christ Jesus stop my
[1:13:00] brother and sister consider what he done
[1:13:02] and let's follow his example
[1:13:07] after all
[1:13:09] carnally
[1:13:11] I was a leper
[1:13:13] I could have through many years of my
[1:13:16] life walked and said unclean unclean
[1:13:20] unclean
[1:13:22] in fact many of you know my testimony
[1:13:24] enough to know there was a time that
[1:13:26] something inside of me would hurt so bad
[1:13:28] I would go to church whether it was in
[1:13:30] Denver or whether it was in Arizona
[1:13:32] Phoenix or Flagstaff wherever I'd go to
[1:13:35] church trying to take away that pain but
[1:13:39] little did I know that God would allow
[1:13:41] that to move so strongly in my life that
[1:13:44] I had to respond to it just like a
[1:13:47] person with a heart attack my brother
[1:13:49] and sister have they got any sense at
[1:13:51] all they don't sit there and say well I
[1:13:53] guess if I live I live and if I die I
[1:13:56] die no at that point in time when their
[1:13:59] chest feels like it's on fire and
[1:14:01] blowing up they are dialing 9-1-1
[1:14:03] they're looking for an aspirin they're
[1:14:05] looking for someone to help them and
[1:14:07] that's what God allows to happen
[1:14:09] sometimes amen he moves us into a
[1:14:12] position we say well I don't know how I
[1:14:14] got here how did I get cold enough I
[1:14:16] enjoyed the comment about the Ember the
[1:14:19] fire blowing the wind blowing upon that
[1:14:21] ember bring that ember back to life let
[1:14:24] it become a roaring flame because we can
[1:14:27] sometimes good people like brother Tony
[1:14:29] Reagan said one time many years ago he
[1:14:32] said that time when mothers have
[1:14:34] children and up until those children
[1:14:36] kind of reach age of accountability or
[1:14:38] Beyond he said a lot of mothers are
[1:14:40] basically backslid because they're
[1:14:42] pouring all their energy and everything
[1:14:44] into their children and the things of
[1:14:47] God they're doing it almost by Instinct
[1:14:50] amen they pray by Instinct there's not a
[1:14:53] real Revelation as it were they're doing
[1:14:55] all of these things and God looks down
[1:14:57] and says that's fine I laid the
[1:14:59] foundation I put the seed there I put
[1:15:01] the muscle memory as it would be there
[1:15:03] and they'll come out of this just fine
[1:15:06] oh thank God for that and we come to
[1:15:09] places like that in our lives well we
[1:15:11] are just literally just walking along
[1:15:13] amen but Jesus he speaks and says you
[1:15:17] know uh were there not ten cleansed but
[1:15:20] where are the nine I'll tell you what
[1:15:22] when I was studying this it struck me so
[1:15:25] strongly amen I'm in that number
[1:15:29] I'm in that number I am number one
[1:15:34] hope you don't mind that amen I am the
[1:15:37] one amen can you say that I am the one
[1:15:41] that came back
[1:15:42] Oh by God's grace and mercy amen given
[1:15:46] the ear to hear and I'll tell you what
[1:15:49] my brother and sister personal Witnesses
[1:15:52] pretty hard to argue with somebody
[1:15:56] who is a personal Witness
[1:16:03] but did they hear
[1:16:05] what they heard
[1:16:09] they heard with an ear
[1:16:12] but God called you to hear
[1:16:15] with your soul with your heart
[1:16:19] you ever wonder why people
[1:16:22] they know their Bible better than you
[1:16:24] they can quote they can do all this
[1:16:27] stuff
[1:16:29] but you don't see
[1:16:32] you don't see the effect you don't see
[1:16:34] the reality
[1:16:37] they're hearing
[1:16:39] but they're not hearing
[1:16:44] and that's scriptural
[1:16:47] it's a word for this day
[1:16:50] and we've got nine lepers to prove it
[1:16:52] they were absolutely obedient
[1:16:56] to the word
[1:16:57] but it's not producing a life that
[1:17:00] brought them back to Jesus Christ
[1:17:04] personally
[1:17:05] they can tell the world I met Jesus on
[1:17:08] the road he healed me he is all they
[1:17:10] said he is he's a Healer he's a provider
[1:17:13] he's everything
[1:17:17] but there was no change
[1:17:19] now you say they were healed of leprosy
[1:17:21] but I want to bring out a very key point
[1:17:26] when this man comes back into the
[1:17:28] presence of Jesus
[1:17:29] he doesn't just say hey you're healed
[1:17:33] but he was made every wit hole
[1:17:38] you know what that is that's the mind
[1:17:41] that's emotion that's the heart that's
[1:17:44] the body that is the soul amen
[1:17:48] everything about this man was set in
[1:17:52] order amen the others had an experience
[1:17:54] with Jesus Christ but went away and went
[1:17:57] back and we're happy to stay there but
[1:18:00] one man by Revelation was magnetized as
[1:18:03] the prophet of God talks about that and
[1:18:05] pulled right back into the presence and
[1:18:08] stood there and knelt before him and
[1:18:11] give him praise and glorified him
[1:18:13] because God had more for him oh I hope
[1:18:16] this sounds doesn't sound too judgmental
[1:18:19] I don't mean it that way but it's simply
[1:18:21] the word of God there was more for that
[1:18:24] man than there was for nine other lepers
[1:18:27] he didn't choose to be the man but it
[1:18:30] was in him to respond because he heard a
[1:18:34] different call he heard a different word
[1:18:36] he understood a different Revelation
[1:18:39] there was something affected him
[1:18:41] differently than the rest he can't oh he
[1:18:44] should not apologize or neither should
[1:18:47] you that God would call you in a fashion
[1:18:50] different than the 90 of the world
[1:18:54] amen but we get a little bit of a
[1:18:56] complex that we are just the odd man out
[1:18:59] all the time well I'll tell you my
[1:19:02] brother and sister when that young man I
[1:19:05] think he was young and when he went into
[1:19:07] the City and they said where you been he
[1:19:10] said I turned around and I went back and
[1:19:12] had a conversation with Jesus and he
[1:19:14] started talking about all the
[1:19:15] supernatural that had happened in his
[1:19:18] life with Jesus and they would be there
[1:19:21] amen amen amen it happened to me too
[1:19:26] no no you don't get it
[1:19:28] you don't get it this was personal
[1:19:31] you never got close to him oh do you see
[1:19:34] the type my brother and sister they were
[1:19:37] at shouting distance with God they were
[1:19:40] at a distance with God speaking to him
[1:19:42] Jesus Master but this man fell at his
[1:19:46] feet he was here in a personal
[1:19:49] relationship but when the conversation
[1:19:51] took place and he's saying I had a
[1:19:53] personal experience with Jesus Christ me
[1:19:56] too
[1:19:57] all right
[1:19:59] he's my healer me too
[1:20:02] he changed my life me too
[1:20:06] you see they couldn't separate that they
[1:20:09] never had experience and all they could
[1:20:11] do is respond I almost titled the sermon
[1:20:13] me too amen because all they could do
[1:20:16] because you see they never caught that
[1:20:20] intrinsic value of what Jesus said they
[1:20:23] heard it in Gross words in vocabulary in
[1:20:27] verbiage and they were there and all
[1:20:29] they could the rest of their life
[1:20:31] I don't know what he thinks we were
[1:20:33] there
[1:20:34] experienced the same thing
[1:20:36] he did
[1:20:38] no you never
[1:20:40] know you never
[1:20:41] you got healed God touched you you were
[1:20:45] brought back into Fellowship in your
[1:20:46] church with your family that was
[1:20:48] wonderful things happened in your life
[1:20:50] amazing Supernatural things happened in
[1:20:53] your life but you didn't have that kind
[1:20:55] of experience and you will think you
[1:20:58] will but you didn't and you can't
[1:21:00] separate that
[1:21:02] how do you separate that
[1:21:08] I'll just move off of that before I
[1:21:11] go to that next page as it were
[1:21:17] amen
[1:21:19] we have to admit they received healing
[1:21:22] and a personal testimony
[1:21:24] to share the rest of their lives
[1:21:28] but one I know I'm going back over this
[1:21:30] again but just bear with me
[1:21:32] one received his healing you know that
[1:21:35] really
[1:21:36] that was on the lowest rung
[1:21:39] you realize that healing's on the law
[1:21:41] are strong
[1:21:42] being healed
[1:21:43] doesn't prove anything
[1:21:47] as far as your salvation
[1:21:52] see people
[1:21:53] we're not careful
[1:21:55] we Elevate these things
[1:21:57] because literally to make my point
[1:22:00] what was the whole Foundation of what
[1:22:02] the nine had to testify to the priest
[1:22:04] I've been healed
[1:22:07] nothing other now that in their
[1:22:09] consideration
[1:22:11] as lepers that's a huge change
[1:22:15] but spiritually
[1:22:17] nothing changed
[1:22:20] whatever they were before they got
[1:22:22] leprosy
[1:22:23] is what they would be after Deliverance
[1:22:27] from leprosy
[1:22:31] come out of denomination and
[1:22:32] denomination don't come out of you
[1:22:35] you still are in a denomination
[1:22:39] put any title you want over the door
[1:22:43] it's still a spirit of denomination
[1:22:46] Lord help us
[1:22:48] amen
[1:22:50] people ask how can a church turn into a
[1:22:52] nicolaitan church because the people
[1:22:56] see we always blame the preacher
[1:22:59] but it's actually the people
[1:23:01] allow it to take place
[1:23:04] because they came from a root or a
[1:23:07] background that they had always been
[1:23:10] rooted in them than in church you submit
[1:23:13] to man's Authority
[1:23:17] they got the message now
[1:23:19] they never got rid of the root
[1:23:21] Lord help us to root the root out we
[1:23:24] have one leadership and it's the Lord
[1:23:27] Jesus Christ
[1:23:28] amen so you see how these things get so
[1:23:31] intertwined and rooted into lives that
[1:23:34] people think it's normal to go to church
[1:23:36] and be dominated by man
[1:23:39] and wonder why after 10 15 20 years the
[1:23:42] church has drifted off and it's cold and
[1:23:44] it's formal and they look back and say
[1:23:46] where did we miss this at you missed it
[1:23:48] when you quit personally seeking the
[1:23:50] leadership of the Holy Ghost and you let
[1:23:53] your backbone get dissolved by kind
[1:23:55] words
[1:23:56] hmm
[1:23:57] that wasn't in my notes excuse me
[1:24:00] amen
[1:24:02] now let's go calling Jesus on the scene
[1:24:05] amen
[1:24:11] now remember every Redemptive blessing
[1:24:14] has already been purchased Can someone
[1:24:16] say Amen
[1:24:17] the price is paid there's only one way
[1:24:19] that you'll ever be able to receive it
[1:24:21] is to believe it and to accept it he's
[1:24:24] the high priest of our confession the
[1:24:26] Hebrew says there the Hebrew letter says
[1:24:29] he's a high priest of our profession to
[1:24:32] profess and confess is the same thing of
[1:24:35] course so we he's the high priest of our
[1:24:38] confession therefore he cannot do
[1:24:40] anything for us until we first confess
[1:24:43] that he's done it amen has God given us
[1:24:45] revelation
[1:24:46] amen that's going to heal us amen has he
[1:24:50] given us uh just oh my to save the time
[1:24:54] of quoting all those he has given all
[1:24:56] that to us and we say amen amen
[1:24:59] hallelujah
[1:25:01] and and when we confess it then he's a
[1:25:04] high priest or mediator to go to work on
[1:25:06] that and make it right so we pray
[1:25:07] trusting in God tonight in his kindness
[1:25:10] and mercy that he will give to us his
[1:25:13] abundance of Grace tonight and now
[1:25:15] remember you must accept it amen what
[1:25:18] happened I I bring this out in this
[1:25:20] fashion to tell you my brother and
[1:25:22] sister that little voice amen the
[1:25:25] presence of God was there with those ten
[1:25:28] lepers
[1:25:29] now I might be stepping a little on a
[1:25:31] limb forgive me if but I believe I'm on
[1:25:34] the right track
[1:25:36] that's still small voice
[1:25:39] because God has it just God
[1:25:42] we're speaking
[1:25:44] to all ten lepers as they walked down
[1:25:50] the road
[1:25:53] one listened
[1:25:55] and one
[1:25:57] accepted
[1:25:58] God did not come I believe he would be
[1:26:01] an unjust God
[1:26:03] to just come and put his finger on one
[1:26:05] and say the rest of your trash
[1:26:07] no sir that's still Small Voice with
[1:26:10] speaking
[1:26:11] but it was not in them to pause long
[1:26:15] enough to hear
[1:26:17] that voice
[1:26:21] and I hope this isn't a bombshell
[1:26:24] they had been trained so
[1:26:28] diligently
[1:26:30] do what the priest
[1:26:33] tells you
[1:26:36] do what the priest tells you
[1:26:40] do what the priest
[1:26:42] tells you
[1:26:45] where Revelation to come in
[1:26:47] as he said wait
[1:26:49] that's my priest
[1:26:51] that's not my priest this is my priest
[1:26:54] and I'm going to go just like he said
[1:26:57] and go and present myself to the priest
[1:27:01] amen so it was by Revelation that he
[1:27:04] recognized not oh hey I'm more important
[1:27:06] I got more spiritual no sir the
[1:27:09] Revelation was he recognized the priest
[1:27:11] oh Hallelujah my brother and sister
[1:27:14] there's God's grace to recognize the
[1:27:17] priest tonight amen God help us that's
[1:27:20] still Small Voice is speaking to you and
[1:27:22] to I what we got to do is stop and
[1:27:26] listen to what the voice is amen and
[1:27:29] then take it back the prophet of God
[1:27:31] didn't say just blindly he said no you
[1:27:33] take every one of those things run
[1:27:34] through the filter of the word
[1:27:36] Hallelujah
[1:27:38] well I didn't have time I don't know I
[1:27:40] had to make a snap decision do I believe
[1:27:42] or not
[1:27:43] God's not unjust God God will give you
[1:27:46] time to run it through the filter of the
[1:27:47] word
[1:27:49] or
[1:27:51] Lord help Paul also okay is it okay if
[1:27:54] the preacher preaches to himself
[1:27:56] maybe we should know the word better so
[1:27:59] when we hear it we'll know whether it
[1:28:01] fits through the filter of the word
[1:28:03] we wouldn't have to go home and do an
[1:28:05] exhaustive study to figure out if the
[1:28:07] preacher said the right thing on Sunday
[1:28:09] because we were in the word and we would
[1:28:11] say yep I just heard that I just read
[1:28:14] that praise God me and the preacher on
[1:28:17] the same mind well really what it is is
[1:28:19] praise God me and God are on the same
[1:28:21] mind amen I've got his mind
[1:28:25] oh is it okay to be excited tonight
[1:28:27] amen sometimes you know that's the
[1:28:29] problem sitting around tractor does all
[1:28:31] the work Amen brother Sergey you know

[1:28:52] quote
[1:28:54] scripture quote
[1:28:57] notes
[1:28:58] quote scripture quote notes notes notes
[1:29:01] notes notes
[1:29:03] oh beep beep gotta turn around
[1:29:06] go back to work
[1:29:08] you see that's a my real job
[1:29:11] that's just a sight line
[1:29:14] the luck my brother and sister you see
[1:29:15] God
[1:29:16] is wanting you and I
[1:29:19] to see this
[1:29:21] he
[1:29:23] wants us to see this
[1:29:26] and he's speaking open your eyes
[1:29:29] open your ears pause for a moment let it
[1:29:33] get quiet enough you can hear my voice
[1:29:38] the scripture doesn't say giant booming
[1:29:41] voice
[1:29:42] says still small voice
[1:29:46] ever you noticed that great big strong
[1:29:48] people
[1:29:50] they usually speak a little quieter
[1:29:53] and they hardly ever really shake your
[1:29:56] hand
[1:29:56] I know a couple guys that are so
[1:29:58] incredibly strong it just I'm amazed
[1:30:00] that one man can be that strong
[1:30:04] Tom Kelly when he shakes your hand you
[1:30:07] think what in the world because he's
[1:30:08] like
[1:30:11] one day I got to know Tom well enough
[1:30:15] Tom why do you shake hands like that
[1:30:17] because I'm afraid to tear yours off
[1:30:23] my brother and sister the power of the
[1:30:25] Majesty of almighty God he comes to us
[1:30:28] Softly and Tenderly
[1:30:32] he comes in meekness and humbleness
[1:30:35] because he knows his power and His
[1:30:38] Majesty but he wants you and I to know
[1:30:41] that power and Majesty to recognize that
[1:30:43] we are directly connected into that amen
[1:30:47] we just got to learn to not use it
[1:30:48] against one another and use it on the
[1:30:50] devil amen there's the key right there
[1:30:53] it's not for you and I to use this to to
[1:30:55] damage and hurt and prove it's for us to
[1:30:58] put the devil underneath our feet amen
[1:31:01] and when we learn that in total total
[1:31:04] total uh uh uh cognitive awareness my
[1:31:07] brother and sister men will realize just
[1:31:10] what Authority we have over the devil
[1:31:12] amen
[1:31:14] you see what it is it's one thing to
[1:31:16] accept the gift
[1:31:18] you realize you can accept a gift from
[1:31:20] almost anyone
[1:31:22] but it's quite another to accept the
[1:31:24] giver
[1:31:27] nine lepers accepted the gift
[1:31:31] they did not accept The Giver
[1:31:35] only one accepted the giver God help us
[1:31:38] Lord to accept you
[1:31:41] whatever you have for us Lord let us
[1:31:43] accept it amen let's accept the gift
[1:31:45] tonight amen now my brother and sister
[1:31:48] if the giver is Desiring Our Praise then
[1:31:51] let's give a gift back to The Giver of
[1:31:54] Our Praise amen now I went way over time
[1:31:57] and so I'm just going to give you
[1:31:59] literally
[1:32:01] the
[1:32:03] overview of this Hebrews 4 1-11
[1:32:06] homework homework
[1:32:09] it's talking about entering into rest
[1:32:13] we've read this scripture many times the
[1:32:15] prophet of God's preached on it my
[1:32:17] brother and sister I want to just
[1:32:18] balance this amen now look real quick
[1:32:21] verse 6 seeing therefore remaineth it
[1:32:24] some must enter therein amen so those
[1:32:27] who has first preached to enter not in
[1:32:29] because of unbelief so it was unbelief
[1:32:31] that held them out and it was there but
[1:32:35] the word of God says there's got to be
[1:32:36] some enter in and now I am very much an
[1:32:40] equal opportunity the Old Testament is
[1:32:43] nothing more the New Testament is
[1:32:45] nothing more than the Old Testament
[1:32:47] explained amen that's what Jesus told us
[1:32:49] he didn't come to do away with it amen
[1:32:52] he come to open it up to fulfill it to
[1:32:55] make it alive to us and so here it is
[1:32:58] that there's a promise that there's some
[1:33:00] that must enter in if you was with
[1:33:03] Israel coming through the Wilderness and
[1:33:06] saw all that you would have saw young
[1:33:07] people I want you to think about this
[1:33:09] you would have saw all that you would
[1:33:11] have saw you would have saw brother Paul
[1:33:12] now I'm going to step a negative picture
[1:33:14] here you would have saw brother Paul
[1:33:16] come to a place I know God said we were
[1:33:18] going to take the land but
[1:33:21] young people I know that there's going
[1:33:23] to be a Rapture take place but and then
[1:33:26] the time would go on and you would see
[1:33:27] brother Paul turn old and feeble and you
[1:33:30] would see brother Paul pass on and you
[1:33:32] would look at that and something would
[1:33:33] be lodged in your mind and you would be
[1:33:35] saying now God said and he used to say
[1:33:38] the pastor used to say but he quit
[1:33:41] saying and he softened it up and
[1:33:43] basically started talking like everybody
[1:33:45] was going to heaven and uh now
[1:33:49] God's back again saying
[1:33:53] you would stop and you'd ponder that
[1:33:56] which one of these was right
[1:34:01] was my pastor right
[1:34:04] well if you choose to follow your pastor
[1:34:06] and your pastor's not on the word
[1:34:08] you'll die
[1:34:09] in a wilderness
[1:34:11] it'll just be a different Wilderness
[1:34:12] than they died in
[1:34:14] amen this one's called laodicea
[1:34:17] amen they died in the wilderness of sin
[1:34:20] aptly named isn't it I even as a kid I
[1:34:22] marveled at that my
[1:34:25] God's got a sense of humor
[1:34:27] they got out there in the desert and
[1:34:28] they didn't believe God it's the
[1:34:30] Wilderness of sin
[1:34:31] they should have known that when they
[1:34:33] saw the sign beside the road welcome to
[1:34:35] the Wilderness of sin
[1:34:37] they should have said whoa whoa we're
[1:34:39] we're in a Wilderness one but we're in
[1:34:42] the wilderness of sin stop everybody
[1:34:47] somewhere in the book
[1:34:48] what does it say historically people die
[1:34:51] out here
[1:34:53] what are we gonna do
[1:34:55] stick with the word
[1:34:57] talk about the original inoculation
[1:35:00] okay look at this so seeing therefore it
[1:35:03] remaineth that some must enter and young
[1:35:04] people I want you to know I don't care
[1:35:05] what you see in your life I don't care
[1:35:07] what happens around you what people
[1:35:09] would say of coming and going and doing
[1:35:11] and quitting some are going to enter in
[1:35:15] there's going to be some
[1:35:16] that take a Rapture there's going to be
[1:35:18] some that are around the Throne of
[1:35:20] almighty God there's going to be some
[1:35:21] that set at the wedding supper in the
[1:35:24] marriage of the Lamb there's going to be
[1:35:25] some that are going to be there just
[1:35:27] commit it in your heart I'm gonna be
[1:35:28] that one I'm going to be of the sum
[1:35:31] that's going to be there and fulfill
[1:35:32] that
[1:35:33] Hallelujah
[1:35:36] you know what this is just such a big
[1:35:37] topic it's totally an injustice
[1:35:40] sister vika will you come
[1:35:42] amen you know what I mean that's kind of
[1:35:46] like I've done it before Jerry and I did
[1:35:48] it not all that long ago you ordered
[1:35:50] dessert like six minutes before the
[1:35:52] restaurant closes
[1:35:54] and then you're sitting there as they're
[1:35:56] cleaning everything up and putting the
[1:35:57] chairs on the table and you've got this
[1:36:00] great big piece of dessert in front of
[1:36:01] you this is back quite a waste in time
[1:36:04] and uh
[1:36:05] actually it was
[1:36:08] the night we ate at goodwoods
[1:36:10] a block from Brother Ivan and sister
[1:36:12] Nadia's house
[1:36:15] but brother Ivan was off
[1:36:17] far Blue Yonder doing something we felt
[1:36:20] Justified eating that close to your
[1:36:22] house
[1:36:25] and we ordered their warm
[1:36:27] carrot cake
[1:36:30] it was so good
[1:36:33] except for the fact that they were
[1:36:34] closing and we were eating at about this
[1:36:36] fast
[1:36:38] you see
[1:36:40] we have to be careful
[1:36:42] so I'm not going to go racing off
[1:36:44] through this word because it's just an
[1:36:46] injustice something so good
[1:36:48] to just be flown through so Lord willing
[1:36:51] we'll pick it up again amen please
[1:36:55] as homework
[1:36:57] read Hebrews 4.
[1:37:00] and
[1:37:03] in the Patmos vision
[1:37:05] you'll find a portion there
[1:37:08] my little quote on the iPad doesn't show
[1:37:10] up
[1:37:11] uh page or a quote number but
[1:37:14] you'll find it there
[1:37:16] brother Brian I'm talking about the
[1:37:18] Bible teaches us about the Sabbath rest
[1:37:21] you see it's not a day Saints
[1:37:24] it's not a day
[1:37:26] it's a relationship
[1:37:28] there's our rest
[1:37:30] not one man I'll close it out here
[1:37:33] if you'll just start playing sister
[1:37:34] beaker
[1:37:37] who truly got rest of those 10
[1:37:44] all ten can say our lives have been
[1:37:46] changed and that have to say Amen
[1:37:49] they could do that but one
[1:37:52] truly and as I explained earlier I want
[1:37:55] to just reinforce this
[1:37:58] everything he said
[1:38:01] they could have said me too
[1:38:05] don't get discouraged when they say me
[1:38:08] too because you see it is so close
