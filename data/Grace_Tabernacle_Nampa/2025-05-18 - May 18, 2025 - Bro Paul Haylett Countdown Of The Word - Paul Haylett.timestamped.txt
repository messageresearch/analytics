[5:59] Do you
[6:10] [Music]
[8:43] Good morning. God bless
[8:46] everyone. Um, look forward to a good
[8:48] service
[8:49] today.
[8:52] Um, you know, I love the song that she's
[8:54] playing, but maybe we'll sing it later.
[8:57] Let's start with number
[8:58] 792. Victory is mine.
[9:07] When I woke this morning, I didn't have
[9:11] no doubt. I knew that the Lord would
[9:15] bring me
[9:17] out. So I got down on my knees. Cried,
[9:22] "Lord, help me please." I got up singing
[9:26] and shouting, "Victory!
[9:30] Oh, victory is
[9:33] mine. Victory is
[9:35] mine. Victory today is
[9:41] mine. I told Satan to get thee
[9:47] behind. Victory today is
[9:53] mine. Love is
[9:56] mine. Love is mine.
[10:00] Love today is
[10:05] mine. I told Satan to get thee
[10:10] behind. Victory today is
[10:15] mine. And joy is
[10:19] mine. Joy is
[10:22] mine. Joy today is mine.
[10:29] I told Satan to get thee
[10:33] behind. Joy today is
[10:39] mine. Peace is
[10:42] mine. Peace is
[10:45] mine. Peace today is mine.
[10:52] I told Satan to get thee
[10:57] behind. Peace today is
[11:02] mine. Oh, happiness is
[11:05] mine. Happiness is
[11:08] mine. Happiness today is mine.
[11:15] I told Satan to get thee
[11:20] behind. Happiness today is
[11:25] mine. Oh yes. Victory is
[11:29] mine. Victory is
[11:32] mine. Victory today is mine.
[11:39] I told Satan to get thee
[11:43] behind. Victory
[11:46] today is
[11:50] mine. Amen. Let's
[11:52] sing when I reach that setting number
[11:58] 419. Let's stand together for this one.
[12:01] [Music]
[12:03] On the top of Mount Zion is a
[12:08] city and the earth with glory that
[12:14] fill. I shall look on its beauty in the
[12:21] morning when I reach that city on the
[12:25] hill.
[12:28] Oh, that
[12:29] city on the top of Mount
[12:33] Zion. Though a
[12:35] pilgrim, yet I love thee
[12:39] still. I'll not leave
[12:42] thee through the ages.
[12:47] And I reach that city on the
[12:51] hill. And I'm invited to come home to
[12:56] that
[12:58] city. For the word says, whosoever
[13:04] will. And I'll find there a mansion for
[13:08] me waiting.
[13:11] When I reach that city on the
[13:16] hill, oh that
[13:19] city on the top of Mount
[13:23] Zion, though a
[13:25] uphill, yet I love thee
[13:29] still. I'll not
[13:32] leave thee through the ages.
[13:36] When I reach that city on the
[13:41] hill, death will never molest me in that
[13:48] city. Never leave me lying cold and
[13:54] chill. And I'll enter to live up there
[13:58] forever.
[14:01] When I reach that city on the
[14:06] hill, oh that
[14:09] city on the top of Mount
[14:13] Zion, though
[14:15] uphill, yet I love thee
[14:19] still, and I'll not
[14:21] leave thee through the
[14:25] ages. when I reach that city on the
[14:31] hill. And so I'll stay here until my
[14:35] Savior calls me, trying daily to perform
[14:42] his
[14:44] will. Then he'll say unto me, "Well done
[14:48] up yonder."
[14:51] When I reach that city on the
[14:56] hill, oh that
[14:59] city on the top of Mount
[15:02] Zion, though a pilgrim, yet I love thee
[15:08] still. And I'll not
[15:11] leave thee through the ages.
[15:16] When I reach that city on the hill one
[15:20] more
[15:21] time. Oh that
[15:23] city on the top of Mount
[15:27] Zion. Though a
[15:29] pilgrim yet I love thee
[15:33] still. And I'll not
[15:36] leave thee through the
[15:39] ages. when I reach that city on the
[15:47] hill. Amen. Let's stay in the same queue
[15:49] for number
[15:51] [Music]
[15:54] 689. I just love this song. Kept
[15:56] thinking about it. So felt like to sing
[15:59] it this
[16:00] morning. Death has no terror for the
[16:05] blood one. No glory. Hallelujah to the
[16:11] lamb and the boasted victory of the
[16:16] grave is gone. Oh glory halleluah to the
[16:24] lamb. Jesus

[18:02] fail. Oh, glory halleluah to the
[18:08] lamb. Jesus

[21:16] grace that's brought us through.

[22:42] father's love. One more time.
[22:47] Just think about his
[22:52] love. Think about his
[22:58] goodness. Think about his
[23:03] grace that's brought us through.
[23:12] For as high as the heavens
[23:17] above, so great is the

[24:27] Lord. Bless you. Let's bow our heads.
[24:31] Our heavenly father, into thy presence
[24:34] we come.
[24:36] Not by works we have done but by your
[24:39] faith and through your faith by grace we
[24:42] are present here this morning. We bring
[24:45] these needs to you our father. It's so
[24:48] good that we know we have a
[24:50] father. And Lord to know that we know
[24:55] you Lord to know that we are in union
[24:58] with you. What an hour we live. What a
[25:01] fellowship. A perfect
[25:03] fellowship. And Lord Jesus, we bring
[25:06] these needs. The needs of those that are
[25:09] sick, our sister, little sister EA and
[25:13] Kristen as her home father. The needs of
[25:16] those that are online, every one of
[25:18] them, traveling, whatever it may be, we
[25:22] bring these needs before you, Lord,
[25:25] speaking grace, ministering life for
[25:28] life comes through your body. We are not
[25:30] here to serve ourselves.
[25:32] We are to serve the
[25:34] body. Lord, it's not our judgment who is
[25:37] and who isn't, but Lord, we have a union
[25:39] with you individually. And that's a
[25:42] great peace with a great rejoicing, a
[25:45] great
[25:46] deliverance. How we love you, Lord, to
[25:48] know that we were the word in the book
[25:50] that was unveiled. And who could unveil
[25:52] it but our
[25:54] bridegroom. Lord, we thank you for that
[25:56] unveiling. You brought us into a perfect
[25:59] union, a perfect communion that only you
[26:02] and your bride can re to fellowship
[26:04] with. And we thank you, Father. We thank
[26:07] you for the day you've given us here
[26:09] that we could come and honor your
[26:11] resurrection. That we rose with you when
[26:14] you
[26:14] rose. Died not only died with you when
[26:17] you died, but rose when you rose. And
[26:19] because I live, you said you live
[26:21] also. What a reality. What a revelation
[26:24] to know we pass from death to life and
[26:28] now growing into the very maturity of
[26:30] yourself. What a marriage it is. We give
[26:33] you praise and thanks. Looking forward

[37:22] morning.
[37:23] Amen. And uh just uh thank you
[37:28] musicians. That was lovely. Appreciate
[37:30] it. Brother Alex, uh the songs uh I I
[37:34] love that when the songs just kind of
[37:36] fit in certain part portions of the
[37:38] songs just just uh touch to what you've
[37:41] been thinking what the Lord's laid on
[37:43] our heart. And uh Philippians the 3
[37:47] chapter starting with verse 7. We are
[37:50] going to talk uh a title that I use
[37:54] today. So you're going to find uh the
[37:57] countdown of the word. Uh, I just, uh,
[38:00] spent the last few days listening to the
[38:03] countdown. And, uh, you know, sometimes,
[38:07] uh, there's more in a a sermon uh, than
[38:11] than you remember there was. You know
[38:13] what I mean? You you just, uh, start to
[38:16] hear it play and you're like, "Oh,
[38:18] beautiful point. Oh, that's so good.
[38:21] That's so good." And you know, finally,
[38:23] some of you that are good with
[38:24] technology understand, but you know, I I
[38:27] used to stop the the uh message program
[38:32] on my phone and go to notes and would
[38:35] write a note out and then I woke up and
[38:37] realized all I have to do is push two
[38:39] buttons and take a picture of the screen
[38:41] and it's right there perfectly worded.
[38:44] And I I literally was thankful that u I
[38:47] I was uh what I was doing. I was able as
[38:50] I was listening to the countdown over a
[38:53] period of days there uh going back and
[38:56] and I had just all kinds of pictures
[38:58] because it's like that quote is so good
[39:00] that quote is so good and anyway so it
[39:02] had enough impact uh we'll we'll uh just
[39:06] uh be speaking today on the countdown of
[39:08] the word and um as a subtitle um we will
[39:13] take moving forward um because this is
[39:16] what the prophet of God is talking about
[39:18] if you're familiar here. Uh, and
[39:20] remember what the countdown is about.
[39:22] Brother Brandham's talking about through
[39:24] the ages started out with horse and
[39:26] buggy and was just kept moving forward,
[39:29] moving forward, moving forward and
[39:32] titles it or brings it to the end as the
[39:35] astronaut age. And uh then he as he
[39:38] brings us to this place that we're in
[39:40] the astronaut age, he takes it even a
[39:43] step further of the astronaut age. And
[39:47] we'll just by God's grace address that
[39:50] uh in the thought today. Amen.
[39:53] Philippians the 3 chapter starting with
[39:55] the 7th verse uh
[39:59] 7-15. But what things were gained to me,
[40:03] those I counted for loss for Christ.
[40:07] Now, just so you'll understand where I'm
[40:09] thinking, this is moving forward.
[40:14] What I thought was
[40:16] gain, I counted as loss for Christ. So
[40:20] moving into another position, moving
[40:23] into something that obviously what he
[40:26] had gained in the natural, he said that
[40:29] is loss because I'm going to gain
[40:32] something more in Christ. Yay,
[40:36] doubtless, and I count all things but
[40:37] loss, for the excellency of the
[40:39] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for
[40:42] whom I have suffered the loss of all
[40:45] things, and do count them but dung, that
[40:48] I might may win Christ, and be found in
[40:51] him, not having my own righteousness,
[40:55] which is of the law, but that which is
[40:57] through the faith of Christ, the
[41:00] righteousness, righteousness which is of
[41:03] God by faith. that I may know him and
[41:07] the power of his resurrection and the
[41:10] fellowship of his sufferings being made
[41:13] conformable unto his death. If by any
[41:17] means I might attain unto the
[41:19] resurrection of the dead, not as though
[41:22] I had already attained, either were
[41:25] already perfect, but I follow after, if
[41:29] that I may apprehend that for which also
[41:32] I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
[41:37] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[41:40] apprehended, but this one thing I do,
[41:43] forgetting those things which are behind
[41:47] and reaching forth unto those things
[41:49] which are before. As we read that, you
[41:54] can see the very clear vein moving
[41:57] forward. Moving forward, not moving
[42:00] sideways, not going back, but moving
[42:03] forward. I want to read verse 13 again.
[42:06] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[42:08] apprehended, but this one thing I do,
[42:11] forgetting those things which are
[42:13] behind, and reaching forth into those
[42:16] things which are before, I press toward
[42:19] the mark for the prize of the high
[42:21] calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us
[42:25] therefore, as many as be perfect, be
[42:28] thus minded. And if anything ye be
[42:32] otherwise minded, God shall reveal even
[42:34] this unto you. Amen. Heavenly Father,
[42:38] Lord, we come together this morning and
[42:40] Father, I pray that you would just touch
[42:43] each heart that's here today. You know
[42:46] every need and every circumstance.
[42:48] Father, you know our health, Lord. You
[42:51] know our finances, Lord. You know our
[42:54] relationships. You know our spiritual
[42:56] well-being this morning, Lord. And
[42:59] Father, we want to commit each one of
[43:01] these things to you, Lord. That Father,
[43:04] you would have complete control over
[43:06] that. That we would be here in the house
[43:08] of God today. And those who might not be
[43:10] here this morning, but Lord, that you
[43:13] would deal kindly with them. Father,
[43:16] those that are not here, Lord, would you
[43:18] just make a way for them, Father? Lord,
[43:21] don't let people get away, Father, where
[43:24] they get a out of the coal, out of the
[43:26] fire, because it cannot stay hot by
[43:29] itself, but it needs to be joined
[43:32] together as a lick of fire. Father, that
[43:34] the heat around it would keep it hot
[43:37] also. And Father, I ask you just to
[43:39] speak to each and every heart today. Ask
[43:42] that your word would be so alive in us
[43:44] today. We're living in a day that Satan
[43:47] has come and deceived us in so many
[43:50] fashions to make things that are that
[43:53] are of no value attractive and the
[43:57] things that are of eternal value less
[44:00] attractive. Father, focus our hearts on
[44:04] you. We ask you, Father, speak today in
[44:07] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may
[44:10] be seated. Hallelujah.
[44:16] Now, as we would look at these things in
[44:19] the word
[44:21] today, it tells us, the apostle Paul
[44:25] tells us to be thus minded to press
[44:28] towards the mark for the prize of the
[44:31] high calling. And you know, you have to
[44:34] be of one mind when it comes to the word
[44:36] of God. For the scripture says that a
[44:39] double-minded person will be
[44:41] double-minded in all of their ways. And
[44:44] if we are here and we are holding
[44:47] anything in our life that we would
[44:49] consider of an equal value to the gospel
[44:52] of Jesus Christ, if we hold to that,
[44:55] then we would be sitting here today, and
[44:57] I hope this isn't too blunt for you, but
[45:00] we'd be sitting here today as a
[45:02] double-minded person. And and that means
[45:04] that you will find yourself unstable in
[45:07] everything that you were doing in your
[45:09] life. And I can tell you there was a
[45:12] time in my own life that I was unstable.
[45:14] And it's no position to be in. It's kind
[45:17] of, if I could put it in a natural
[45:19] analogy, most of us have done something
[45:21] like this. You you go to cross the creek
[45:23] and and the the thing you don't want to
[45:26] do is is get your feet wet. And you
[45:29] know, you look for a place that you
[45:31] believe you can walk across. But as
[45:33] you're in the middle of the stream, you
[45:35] step on that one rock and it starts to
[45:37] rock back and forth and and you know
[45:40] without having balance, you will
[45:43] ultimately be stepping off into the
[45:45] creek and your feet will be wet. And so
[45:48] if you uh start that with a doubt or a
[45:50] fear that your feet are going to get
[45:52] wet, you might as well just walk through
[45:54] the creek and get to the other side with
[45:56] wet feet. Because you see, in the middle
[45:58] of the stream is no place to lose your
[46:01] balance. It's not a place that we want
[46:03] to come and and start to question, you
[46:05] know, is this really real? The the world
[46:08] seems to be attractive, my brother and
[46:10] sister. I'll tell you the bane of young
[46:12] people in our day is people who are
[46:15] attractive to you and are not uh on fire
[46:18] for God. Amen. That's what Satan loves
[46:20] to do. He loves to put someone in our
[46:23] life that is attractive to us. It might
[46:25] be personality. It might be looks. It
[46:27] might be just uh something overall in
[46:30] that. And to find that they are are less
[46:34] than committed is like the loose rock in
[46:36] the middle of the stream. And then we
[46:38] find people that all their life, Amen.
[46:41] We see it all the time. They may have
[46:42] been raised in the house of God and
[46:45] someone holds so much sway over them
[46:47] that they get to a point they don't know
[46:49] right or left. And you know what
[46:51] happens? This thing called gravity. And
[46:53] gravity will always take you down. And
[46:56] so it's always easier to take the easy
[46:59] path than it is to stand solid upon what
[47:02] God has called us to. And so as we'll
[47:05] look at this in Philippians 3:7, very
[47:07] familiar scripture to us. Amen. I I want
[47:11] to go back once again as we move on to
[47:13] drive home this point. Amen. Verse 13. I
[47:17] count not myself to have apprehended,
[47:19] but this one thing I do, forgetting
[47:23] those things which are behind. In other
[47:26] words, when God has already taken you
[47:28] and delivered you out of the grip of
[47:31] Satan in the world we're living in
[47:33] today, don't go looking back and
[47:35] reminiscing of lovely memories that you
[47:38] had of this and of that, but forget
[47:40] those things and reach forth into those
[47:43] things which are before. Amen. So let's
[47:46] press to the mark of the high calling.
[47:48] Now the apostle Paul is here. We know
[47:50] the story. I don't have to revisit every
[47:53] bit of this. But all that he had done
[47:56] attained to a certain position as a
[47:58] Pharisee in the early portions of
[48:00] Philippians 3. There he's talking about
[48:02] how that he uh of all people had
[48:05] attained had the perfect pedigree, the
[48:07] perfect schooling, had rose up into a
[48:09] perfect position in the church. And he
[48:12] looks at that and he says, "You know
[48:14] what? that loss was actually gain to me
[48:17] when when that was behind me. I actually
[48:20] count that as gain. And so it's there
[48:22] he's moving forward in the word telling
[48:25] us that he moved forward. And what he
[48:27] did do is he gained Christ. But he said
[48:30] I and I say that he's this because God
[48:32] put a humble spirit even though he
[48:34] boldly says I Paul an apostle of Jesus
[48:37] Christ. I Paul a prisoner. He speaks
[48:40] very positive but actually the apostle
[48:42] Paul was very humble. He was staying
[48:44] there because he knew it was only the
[48:47] grace of God that put him where he was
[48:50] at. Paul himself would have just
[48:52] continued to rise in the hierarchy of
[48:54] the church and come to a place that he
[48:57] was very acknowledged as this great man
[48:59] who would give such service and and had
[49:02] uh uh judged and crucified many a a
[49:05] heretic and by God's grace he got turned
[49:09] from that and he acknowledges that and
[49:11] so it's there he says I I counted it
[49:14] gain amen when I came to Christ that
[49:18] that was I always thought I was serving
[49:20] him, but it really was gain when I come
[49:22] to him. And so I'm forgetting those
[49:25] things behind. Now, you know, the
[49:27] Apostle Paul could have, if God had laid
[49:30] it upon his heart, he could have put in
[49:32] print the very afflictions, the thorn in
[49:36] his flesh. He could have explained it to
[49:39] us. But you see, he didn't want us to
[49:42] focus on what the thorn was in his life.
[49:46] He wanted us to come to this place and
[49:48] recognize that we have a thorn. Amen. If
[49:51] he'd have said it was this, then people
[49:53] would have said, "Oh, that's the only
[49:55] thorn there is." But when he talked
[49:56] about the thorn in the flesh, my brother
[49:58] and sister, God left that open enough
[50:01] that you and I this morning, if we would
[50:03] be open with ourselves and honest, we
[50:05] would say, "We have a thorn in our
[50:08] flesh." Amen. We have something that is
[50:10] there. But you know what? You might say,
[50:12] "It's it's hard, Brother Paul. I I just
[50:14] simply can't. But the Apostle Paul is
[50:17] encouraging you today to forget the
[50:20] thorn in your flesh and move forward.
[50:23] Amen. Don't Don't stay there focused on
[50:26] the thorn. I have a thorn. I have a
[50:29] thorn, you know, and this is why I
[50:31] can't. No, he's telling you just move
[50:34] on. Move forward. Go beyond the thorn.
[50:37] Do not use your childhood or something
[50:41] of your adulthood. Do not use a
[50:44] circumstance. Don't use social position
[50:47] or anything like that as an excuse.
[50:49] Amen. You can have the thorn and move on
[50:52] from that thorn closer and gain Christ.
[50:56] Amen. So, we want to move forward. Now,
[50:59] in the sermon, the countdown, I'm going
[51:02] to have several quotations from this
[51:04] sermon today. And uh if I had listed
[51:07] every quotation that I had, I would just
[51:10] have to spend time today just reading
[51:12] quote after quote because it was very
[51:14] much moving to me. Now look at this
[51:17] paragraph 36 out of out of uh uh the
[51:21] program that I use. Sometimes those
[51:23] quotes uh uh yeah the numbers change but
[51:26] he says the natural man by the knowledge
[51:29] looks backwards for his achievement.
[51:32] Now, I I just want to ask you, have you
[51:35] been I hope I'm not the stranger in the
[51:37] crowd here, but have you ever at been a
[51:40] time in a maybe a melancholic moment
[51:43] that you would look back at something
[51:45] you had accomplished and you did that
[51:47] because you knew that would make you
[51:49] feel a little bit better? You know, it's
[51:51] like, well, we done this, we done that.
[51:53] Oh, thank you, Lord. We did this. But
[51:56] you see, my brother and sister, what we
[51:57] did in the past will slowly fade. It
[52:01] will slowly as days go by. I I'm sorry
[52:04] to address this uh to those of you that
[52:07] maybe had birthdays or or maybe some
[52:09] graduates that are coming up. You know,
[52:12] these are milestones, but they're also a
[52:14] stone that you will go miles beyond very
[52:17] shortly. Amen. So, you just keep moving
[52:19] and you look at this and we'll have
[52:21] things that happen in our life. We look
[52:23] to that. Oh, praise God. I did this.
[52:26] Now, it it is there that we have to be
[52:28] careful. We don't put too much focus on
[52:30] the past because God's not dealing in
[52:33] the past. And we'll touch on that in
[52:35] just a moment. Amen. Looking backwards
[52:37] for his uh achievement. That's science.
[52:41] See to what God has done in a former
[52:43] creation. They go out and pick up clouds
[52:47] and get pieces of rocks and fossils and
[52:50] elements and ties them together. Is that
[52:53] not adequate with today, my brother and
[52:55] sister? I just love science. They're
[52:57] like, "We found this certain thing here.
[52:59] We carbon dated it. It is 66 million
[53:03] years old." As though we in a present
[53:06] time would have a clue what something 66
[53:09] million years old looks like. But they
[53:13] go and they use something and in that
[53:16] they said, "Well, it's because we're
[53:18] certain that this rock was this old."
[53:20] Well, how are they certain that this
[53:22] rock is this old? How are they certain
[53:24] of how the mineral will degrade and how
[53:27] these things will take place? But
[53:29] they're looking see they to see what God
[53:32] has done in former creation. In other
[53:35] words, not even talking about a
[53:36] different age, a different time, a
[53:38] different but whatever God formed
[53:40] previous. Now, I want you to think
[53:42] spiritual because that's where the
[53:44] prophet's taking this. Amen. They go
[53:47] out, pick up cloths, get pieces of rocks
[53:49] and fossils and elements and ties them
[53:52] together. See on that achievement they
[53:54] are taking what God has done and
[53:57] perverting it from its original estate
[54:00] and making his living quarters and so
[54:04] forth and his economy a little better by
[54:07] what has been created. That's in the
[54:10] natural achievement by man. Now I want
[54:13] to do a little explaining if you don't
[54:15] mind here for just a moment. We come out
[54:18] here and and it's probably not too much
[54:20] left, but there's still a little bit of
[54:22] old growth forest and they love to log
[54:24] it because it makes the best lumber for
[54:26] building the best houses. So, we're
[54:28] taking what God has already put on the
[54:30] earth. We're sawing it up and making
[54:33] wood to build a house. Amen. We are
[54:35] digging up minerals from the earth. Look
[54:38] at the emphasis that is in the world
[54:40] right now of these rare earth minerals
[54:43] that they're fighting all over the world
[54:45] to get their hands on these rare earth
[54:48] minerals. Amen. What is that? Did man
[54:50] put that there? Was that No, my brother
[54:52] and sister, that's previous creation.
[54:55] Amen. We look at the gold and the silver
[54:57] and all of these things like this. And
[55:00] in fact, we live in such a simple world
[55:02] that people build a house on a on a a
[55:05] gravel bar and they want to go find the
[55:08] best of soil, but they got to go
[55:09] somewhere else to get it because the
[55:11] gravel bar won't provide it. And so they
[55:14] are now taking something God created and
[55:17] bringing it over and using it to make a
[55:19] better house, a better home, a better
[55:21] living. And so we look at this how the
[55:24] prophet of God speaking this so touches
[55:27] on the very attitude and approach of the
[55:29] world today the the uh uh the investment
[55:34] you might say that is put out by mankind
[55:37] to touch or reach into the creation of
[55:41] God to bless themselves. They're not
[55:43] doing it to bless God. Amen. So it's
[55:46] there. It's natural achievement by man.
[55:48] But God in the spiritual achievement is
[55:52] going forward, not going backward. He is
[55:56] going forward, looking into the word.
[55:59] Oh, come on, saints. We're not going to
[56:01] find it out here in science. Looking
[56:04] into the word. Amen. and believing the
[56:08] promises for things that never has come
[56:11] yet for the spiritual revelations to
[56:15] manifest the spiritual things that God
[56:17] has promised. Looking forward to the
[56:20] spiritual manifestation of what God has
[56:24] promised and yet we have not seen. My
[56:27] brother and sister, we'll preach it and
[56:29] we'll preach it till we no longer can
[56:31] preach it. That we're not waiting for a
[56:33] rapture. We are the rapture. Amen. We
[56:36] are the changing of this body natural
[56:40] and spiritual. Amen. So the natural side
[56:43] you say what is that? Yes. This soul is
[56:46] no longer corruptible seed. Amen. It is
[56:49] now becoming put on the incorruptible.
[56:52] And the soul predestinated of God before
[56:55] the foundation of the world is a soul
[56:57] that God himself said cannot be lost. So
[57:01] we're seeing the manifestation of the
[57:03] promised word. Amen. He sees them come
[57:06] to pass just as the scientists in his
[57:09] laboratory are working on different
[57:11] things to help man taking creation. The
[57:15] spiritual man is looking forward to
[57:17] something that God promised that has
[57:20] never yet been created. Now, we'll get
[57:23] into this a little further, but I want
[57:25] to just plant this seed. And I
[57:26] appreciated Brother David's prayer.
[57:28] Amen. My brother and sister, you are
[57:30] sitting here today. This will be a
[57:31] little redundant. forgive me. But you're
[57:33] sitting here today and I believe every
[57:35] one of us at some point in time will
[57:37] have the thought, I don't have enough
[57:39] faith. Well, I want to know where did
[57:41] you get this faith at anyhow? Amen. Is
[57:44] it a faith that you found? Did you dig
[57:46] it out from underneath a rock in a creek
[57:48] bed somewhere? Is it faith you found on
[57:50] top of a mountain somewhere? Where did
[57:53] this faith come from? Amen. God created
[57:57] this faith. It is his faith and he's the
[58:00] one that gives it. And he actually gives
[58:03] it quite liberal but we are looking at
[58:06] it from an accomplishment on our part. I
[58:09] have faith. My brother and sister, you
[58:12] have a revelation of what God has given
[58:14] you. But that does not mean that you
[58:16] actually are a possessor of faith as
[58:19] though it would be to have something
[58:22] like a coin. See, are you with me? Amen.
[58:28] The natural man looks backwards. The
[58:30] spiritual man looks forward. That's the
[58:31] way they got that in the church. The
[58:34] natural church member looks back to what
[58:36] Finny Sanki Knox Calvin that was all
[58:39] right. But that was their day. We are
[58:42] looking forward for something else. The
[58:44] promise that's greater and higher what
[58:48] God has promised. Science goes back to
[58:50] pick it up. We go forward in the word of
[58:54] the Lord to find what God has achieved.
[58:57] Amen. And I just want to ask you, Amen.
[58:59] Do you believe that the rapture has been
[59:02] achieved in you? Amen. We are not
[59:05] looking for a day when something will
[59:07] change out here and then suddenly the
[59:09] rapture will become a reality. The
[59:11] rapture is a reality. The revelation of
[59:14] it to you and I is still coming. But God
[59:17] has already through his word declared it
[59:20] is so. So that means every element that
[59:24] it takes for the rapture has already
[59:27] been created. Amen. Just not revealed to
[59:30] you and I. Amen. Amen. Cuz if we had a
[59:34] revelation of the rapture, we'd actually
[59:35] be gone. So you see, there's a key
[59:38] element that God has not placed in us
[59:41] yet. Because when that comes to pass and
[59:43] the word is spoken, Amen, we're gone.
[59:46] Amen. It's not going to be, wow, the
[59:48] miracle of the rapture. Well, we as
[59:51] humans will look at it as a miracle, but
[59:53] to God, it is the fulfillment of his
[59:56] word that he has already spoken. Amen.
[1:00:00] So, we're not looking back. Now, see
[1:00:02] what happens. We get caught in a time
[1:00:04] warp. And uh so, we we'll look back and
[1:00:07] and and uh we quote and so don't
[1:00:09] misunderstand me. I'm not saying this is
[1:00:11] a harsh thing, but we look back in time.
[1:00:13] and brother Brandham said and and that's
[1:00:15] good because it is the word of God put
[1:00:17] down in a language that's good for
[1:00:19] people like myself and it's there but
[1:00:22] you know if we don't if we're not
[1:00:23] careful we'll look back and we'll say
[1:00:26] but this is here and this is where the
[1:00:28] life was and this is where it's at and
[1:00:30] this is where you know these things are
[1:00:32] taking place we're looking back we're
[1:00:34] looking back we're looking back 10
[1:00:36] vision is a good example my brother and
[1:00:38] sister uh people looking back believing
[1:00:41] that somehow or another the prophet of
[1:00:43] God uh you know it didn't take place
[1:00:45] then so he must return to manifest the
[1:00:47] tent vision but the prophet of God
[1:00:49] preached the word and the word revealed
[1:00:52] that the tent vision that little room is
[1:00:54] that one the prophet of God's talking
[1:00:56] about and now medical science has found
[1:00:59] this little place in the
[1:01:03] heart there's your tent amen there's the
[1:01:07] place he's going to meet you in there
[1:01:10] amen see we have to sometimes to stop
[1:01:13] and in the right time, the re right
[1:01:15] season see that what God revealed to
[1:01:18] brother Brham as a little building that
[1:01:20] was there in the middle of the tent and
[1:01:22] it was there and people walking in
[1:01:24] there. My brother and sister, what he
[1:01:26] was seeing was people coming in the
[1:01:28] presence of God, coming and meeting the
[1:01:31] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit doing a
[1:01:33] mighty work in their life. And I want to
[1:01:35] you to explain when you receive the
[1:01:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost, explain how
[1:01:40] it happened.
[1:01:42] You're going to walk out of there
[1:01:43] saying, "Hey, what happened in there? I
[1:01:46] don't know, but something happened. I'm
[1:01:48] changed." Amen. And so, we see how this
[1:01:52] being manifested, my brother and sister,
[1:01:54] in the way God chooses to express it is
[1:01:57] not always uh in in the way that he
[1:02:00] presents it to us. He he expresses it as
[1:02:03] a little wooden building. The prophet up
[1:02:05] higher, looking down, seeing a little
[1:02:07] building. He's seeing people walk out
[1:02:09] healed, walked out, deliverance. people
[1:02:11] walked out filling filled with the Holy
[1:02:13] Ghost and and God used that. But we are
[1:02:16] such earthbound tangible oriented people
[1:02:20] that we have to have something here. We
[1:02:23] can put our hands to it. But God says, I
[1:02:25] want you to look in the spiritual
[1:02:27] because uh uh just uh uh not to go into
[1:02:30] this but just interacting with some
[1:02:31] brothers overseas and talking about you
[1:02:34] know how that God has come and he puts
[1:02:37] things down here in the natural. Well,
[1:02:39] brother Brandham emphasizes this, the
[1:02:41] natural typing the spiritual. Now, what
[1:02:45] we could really, my brother and sister,
[1:02:47] stop and say, "Oh, yes, I see this. I
[1:02:49] see this." But you need to look much
[1:02:51] deeper. You need to look down that
[1:02:53] everything that God did. Amen. Look at
[1:02:56] Israel's journey out of Egypt. Every one
[1:02:58] of you before you go in rapture will
[1:03:00] have taken the same exact journey that
[1:03:03] Israel took out of Egypt, including
[1:03:06] going through the wilderness of sin,
[1:03:09] you're going to run into the serpent.
[1:03:11] And look at why. Look at the world we
[1:03:13] live in, my brother and sister. Sin is
[1:03:15] rampant. Amen. And every one of us at
[1:03:18] some point in time has been bitten by
[1:03:20] the serpent. But we just need to look up
[1:03:22] and live. Amen. And we're living in a
[1:03:25] day when the prophet of God talking
[1:03:26] about the gifts that was given to Elvis
[1:03:29] Presley and all of that gamut of men
[1:03:31] that God gave those gifts and how they
[1:03:33] misused those. What happened was God
[1:03:36] gave them the gift. They're walking in
[1:03:38] the journey. They got bit by the
[1:03:39] serpent, but they did not look up and
[1:03:42] live. Amen. They decided, I'm just going
[1:03:45] to let the serpent's venom flow through
[1:03:47] me and and what it will be will be. They
[1:03:50] sold out their gift. And brother
[1:03:52] Brandham makes it very clear when they
[1:03:54] stand before God one day, they'll
[1:03:56] realize what they sold their gift for
[1:03:58] was not near enough. Amen. They sold out
[1:04:02] cheap.
[1:04:04] They got millions of dollars. And they
[1:04:06] sold out too cheap.
[1:04:09] My think about it. Don't let some little
[1:04:12] thing on this earth right here,
[1:04:13] popularity and a little bit of economics
[1:04:16] and whatever else. Don't don't sell out
[1:04:18] for that cuz the day will come you'll
[1:04:20] recognize that was too cheap.
[1:04:23] Amen.
[1:04:25] So we get caught in a time warp if we're
[1:04:28] not careful as message believers. We're
[1:04:30] looking back.
[1:04:31] Look at the great move of God. I just
[1:04:34] listening at several different sermons
[1:04:37] and the final one was countdown. But
[1:04:39] just listening to the prayer line and
[1:04:41] the prophet of God, they're not even
[1:04:43] coming up front. Those that were had a
[1:04:44] prayer card. They're they're standing
[1:04:46] there waiting and the prophet of God
[1:04:47] saying, "And now you the little lady in
[1:04:49] the blue dress now this and this and
[1:04:51] this in your life and the one next to
[1:04:53] you this and this and this and one next
[1:04:55] to you and sir next to her and it just
[1:04:58] goes right down the line." Imagine my
[1:05:00] brother and sister, you know, we're
[1:05:02] looking with anticipation or
[1:05:04] disappointment about a prayer card and
[1:05:06] yet the Holy Spirit comes down right in
[1:05:08] the midst of the people and says, "I'm
[1:05:10] going to show you that I'm present." And
[1:05:12] every one of these, you know, brother
[1:05:14] Brandham, how difference of peoples, you
[1:05:16] know, he's like, "Now, little sister, if
[1:05:18] that's true, lift your hand." Now she's
[1:05:20] lifted her hand. Now, you know, she's
[1:05:22] declaring that's the truth. And then now
[1:05:24] it's moving over on you, sir. And you
[1:05:27] had this situation. And you, sister, oh,
[1:05:30] it's not for you. It's for your two
[1:05:33] brothers that are alcoholics and need
[1:05:36] deliverance.
[1:05:38] Amen.
[1:05:40] Oh.
[1:05:42] But you look in the world we live in
[1:05:44] today and they'll say there's no
[1:05:45] evidence of that ministry.
[1:05:48] What are they looking for? Yeah, that's
[1:05:50] right. Credibility by their standard.
[1:05:54] Credibility by their deal. And and this
[1:05:56] has been something that's bothered me
[1:05:58] lately in a sense. Not bothered me as a
[1:06:01] negative, but just been on the side of
[1:06:03] my mind. My brother and sister, it's one
[1:06:04] thing for a voice to call you out, but
[1:06:07] there's got to be a voice to call you
[1:06:09] in. Amen. And and there's a lot of
[1:06:11] voices today trying to call you out. But
[1:06:14] where are they trying to take you? In
[1:06:16] many cases, they have nowhere to take
[1:06:19] you to. And just like Israel coming up
[1:06:22] to the Red Sea, they say, "We've been
[1:06:24] better off if we'd stayed in
[1:06:26] denomination. If we had just stayed in
[1:06:29] Egypt, everything would be fine." I
[1:06:32] didn't get beaten too hard while I was
[1:06:35] making bricks.
[1:06:37] My stomach was full. I knew what to
[1:06:41] expect.
[1:06:43] But you see the voices that are trying
[1:06:44] to call out, they're actually the voices
[1:06:47] of Dayan and Corora in the wilderness
[1:06:49] trying to call you out. We're just as
[1:06:51] spiritual as you are. Amen. And God has
[1:06:54] called them. And you just look at this
[1:06:56] pattern and see if God doesn't hold to
[1:06:58] this pattern. They're the ones that are
[1:07:00] saying we're just as spiritual. And then
[1:07:03] as it was with Day and Corinum and those
[1:07:05] that stood with them, the earth opened
[1:07:07] up and swallowed them. And this day
[1:07:10] we're not having an actual physical
[1:07:12] earth opening up and swallowing, but the
[1:07:14] earth itself, Leodysian spirit is
[1:07:18] opening up and swallowing. Amen. Be in
[1:07:21] church on a Sunday and the next on the
[1:07:23] beach half naked, my brother and sister,
[1:07:26] and say, "How did that happen?" Because
[1:07:28] you do not come and tell God he's wrong.
[1:07:32] That's the simple truth. Does have
[1:07:35] nothing to do with the message. It's
[1:07:36] just a matter of you do not tell God he
[1:07:38] is wrong. Amen. So, we get caught in a
[1:07:42] time warp. If we're not careful, we keep
[1:07:44] looking back. But I tell you, my brother
[1:07:46] and sister, the revealed word, and we
[1:07:49] believe the word's been revealed, right?
[1:07:51] It's still revealing.
[1:07:53] Amen. It didn't stop when the prophet
[1:07:56] went off the scene. When God took the
[1:07:58] prophet, the revealing of the word
[1:08:00] didn't stop right there. Amen. And God
[1:08:03] has kept right on, but he took it down
[1:08:06] into a personal level where sons and
[1:08:08] daughters of God reading their Bible,
[1:08:10] studying the message, and one day they
[1:08:13] say, "Man, that makes sense. I just
[1:08:14] heard over here and this here, I
[1:08:17] understand it. The word, Amen, is still
[1:08:20] revealing." And if you don't think it's
[1:08:22] not even revealing the intents of the
[1:08:24] heart, my brother and sister, we won't
[1:08:26] go into that here. But I tell you, God
[1:08:29] is coming so direct that maybe words are
[1:08:31] spoken in a service and of everybody out
[1:08:35] of the hundreds that might be sitting or
[1:08:37] the dozen or two that are sitting, no
[1:08:40] one gets it, but one person says,
[1:08:42] "That's exactly where I'm at." Amen. The
[1:08:45] word discerning, it's not always a voice
[1:08:47] saying, "Now you over there in that row
[1:08:50] wearing that color clothing that this
[1:08:52] and this and this." But sometimes in
[1:08:54] this day, it's just the preaching of the
[1:08:56] word. And it might bypass everyone else
[1:08:59] in the building, but it comes right down
[1:09:01] to the heart of that individual. And
[1:09:03] what is God doing? He's using the word.
[1:09:06] Amen. And not a gift as it were. Now, be
[1:09:09] careful. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:09:10] Not a gift as it were to discern the
[1:09:12] heart. He's letting the word go forth
[1:09:16] and discern the heart. And when the word
[1:09:18] comes and discerns the heart, the
[1:09:20] prophet of God tells us a real believer
[1:09:22] says amen to that word. Amen. So be it,
[1:09:25] Lord. what you just spoke to my heart,
[1:09:27] so be it. Amen. Let it be real.
[1:09:30] Hallelujah. So, the revealed word is
[1:09:32] still revealing. Amen. Now, we rejoice
[1:09:35] in the things that have been revealed to
[1:09:37] us in the past. The message, the word
[1:09:39] coming together. We certainly do that.
[1:09:41] Now, look how brother Brandham expressed
[1:09:43] this. Amen. The spiritual, this is, we
[1:09:46] already read this in the quote, but I
[1:09:47] just want to reiterate it. The spiritual
[1:09:49] man is looking forward to something that
[1:09:52] God promised.
[1:09:54] So if God promised it in this day we can
[1:09:56] find the promise. Amen.
[1:10:00] Amen. The promise is is without doubt
[1:10:02] can be found.
[1:10:06] That has never yet been
[1:10:11] created. Now please bear with me very
[1:10:16] carefully. How many times have we said
[1:10:19] Lord I need more faith.
[1:10:23] I believe every every Christian that's
[1:10:25] really every soldier that's really
[1:10:26] fighting the fight has come to a point
[1:10:28] in time says Lord I need more faith.
[1:10:32] And then sometimes or maybe all the time
[1:10:34] we repent from that. Oh Lord forgive me
[1:10:36] for doubting. But you see, my brother
[1:10:39] and sister, uh uh we we're coming to a
[1:10:45] place if we could just go somewhere in
[1:10:49] the present stage of the
[1:10:51] message and we could just go, "Oh, I
[1:10:55] know what we would do. We would copy the
[1:10:58] Muslims and we would have a
[1:11:00] Mecca and we could go listen to brother
[1:11:03] so and so preach the
[1:11:05] message and receive more
[1:11:08] faith. I didn't include the quote
[1:11:10] because I know I'll be probably longer
[1:11:12] than I should, but prophet of God in the
[1:11:14] same sermon talking in countdown talking
[1:11:16] about how that you have a fever and uh
[1:11:19] you go and the you know the pastor prays
[1:11:22] for you and his
[1:11:25] faith bonded together with your faith
[1:11:29] and the fever
[1:11:31] leaves and the prophet of God speaking
[1:11:34] so
[1:11:35] positive about the
[1:11:37] ministry. Now, please don't think I'm
[1:11:40] here touting the
[1:11:42] ministry, but you see the prophets
[1:11:45] speaking so highly of the
[1:11:48] ministry, but people don't think so much
[1:11:50] about the ministry anymore.
[1:11:52] They they can tell you there's all kinds
[1:11:55] of horror stories about I I believe the
[1:11:58] message and tell this
[1:12:01] pastor, my brother and sister, my Bible
[1:12:04] tells
[1:12:05] me
[1:12:07] that Satan cannot cause me to be
[1:12:10] separated
[1:12:12] from the word of God. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:18] So what happens
[1:12:20] now? Is the man really the
[1:12:23] problem? The
[1:12:25] pastor. Oh, there can be problems. Oh,
[1:12:28] yeah. Trust me, I'm not going to defend
[1:12:30] them. They can be problems. They have
[1:12:33] done. Men have done. They're not really
[1:12:36] actually pastors. Pastor is a title to
[1:12:38] them.
[1:12:40] Men have done every
[1:12:42] devious and
[1:12:44] dishonest
[1:12:46] deed to other
[1:12:49] people. Is that the same pastors that
[1:12:54] the word is talking about?
[1:12:58] No. That's an anointing from the pits of
[1:13:00] hell.
[1:13:02] But look how many people no longer would
[1:13:05] even sit in a church and listen to a
[1:13:07] pastor speak. That's right. Isn't Satan
[1:13:10] clever? He's come right in and caused a
[1:13:15] separation. I no longer go to
[1:13:18] church. Well, I'm sorry. My Bible says
[1:13:21] not to forsake. Right. Right. See how
[1:13:24] tricky Satan is? Oh, we need more faith.
[1:13:29] Where are we going to find more
[1:13:31] faith? Brother Brandham has spoke these
[1:13:33] words. There's people here, not enough
[1:13:35] faith to heal a toothache. Pretty
[1:13:39] straightforward words, isn't it? Yeah.
[1:13:41] But let's look here in just moving
[1:13:43] forward in the law
[1:13:46] 1955. Now Paul speaking here of the
[1:13:49] valley or the shadow rather the law
[1:13:52] being a shadow of good things to come
[1:13:54] could never make the worshipper perfect.
[1:13:57] Then he goes on to show what the
[1:13:59] perfection is. See, we got to make sure
[1:14:02] that we actually understand when the
[1:14:04] word calls us to be perfect what that
[1:14:08] perfection is. If you're looking for
[1:14:10] perfection in flesh, my brother and
[1:14:13] sister, you will be discouraged. You
[1:14:15] will quit serving God. You will never
[1:14:18] walk in another church. If you are
[1:14:20] thinking you're going to find perfect
[1:14:22] flesh. Amen.
[1:14:25] Now, it's strange thing that it is so
[1:14:27] much thought of people. They say, "Well,
[1:14:29] I'm weak. My faith is not very much. I'm
[1:14:33] not a very good Christian." That's just
[1:14:36] what the devil wants you to say. You're
[1:14:40] talking his language right then. I don't
[1:14:42] think any one of us right now wants to
[1:14:44] say, you know, I don't have any problem
[1:14:46] talking the devil's language. I It's no
[1:14:48] big deal. It won't have an effect on me.
[1:14:51] My brother and sister, I tell you, I've
[1:14:53] shared this story here uh uh about the
[1:14:55] three men in the plane crash in the
[1:14:57] Sierra Nevada. And the one guy totally
[1:15:00] unheard says, "We're going to die here."
[1:15:01] The other one's injured, and he's like,
[1:15:03] "Oh, there's no way I can go out." The
[1:15:05] third guy is ends up having a broken
[1:15:08] back. And he says, "I promised my
[1:15:10] daughter I'd be at her soccer game this
[1:15:12] Friday, and I will be there." And he
[1:15:15] climbs down the mountain, bent over. His
[1:15:17] back hurts so bad he fell in tree wells.
[1:15:20] He fell in the creek. He slept under a
[1:15:22] tree, scraping pine needles over himself
[1:15:25] at night, plowing through the snow and
[1:15:28] comes out on a Thursday into a place
[1:15:31] where families are tubing. And the kids
[1:15:33] start screaming and the dads start
[1:15:35] running to defend their children and
[1:15:37] find this muddy, bloody mess of a man.
[1:15:40] And he's there and they rush him off to
[1:15:42] the hospital. He's there in the hospital
[1:15:44] and he tells the doctor. The doctor
[1:15:46] says, "Well, your back is broken. you
[1:15:48] need to be put into a a deal to hold you
[1:15:51] straight for a few weeks and and um this
[1:15:54] is you'll be okay. And he says, "Doctor,
[1:15:57] I I have a request." And the doctor's
[1:15:59] like, "What?" And he says, "My daughter
[1:16:02] is going to be playing soccer, and I
[1:16:04] promised her I would be there." And the
[1:16:06] doctor says, "No problem. This brace
[1:16:08] that we have is actually designed for
[1:16:10] you to be able to sit in a wheelchair
[1:16:12] with this brace on." And there he is on
[1:16:15] a Friday afternoon in a wheelchair at
[1:16:17] his soccerers game. And when the when
[1:16:20] they flew up there with the medevac and
[1:16:22] the search and rescue, they found the
[1:16:24] other two men frozen to death. My
[1:16:27] brother and sister, tell me your
[1:16:29] confession. Won't change the outcome of
[1:16:32] your life. Oh, that's just one little
[1:16:34] story, brother Paul. That's a story of
[1:16:36] the man that should have been the least
[1:16:38] likely to have lived through the
[1:16:40] experience was the one who lived. And it
[1:16:43] come down to the fact that as he laid
[1:16:45] there shivering at night saying, "Oh,
[1:16:47] I'm going to die here and they'll never
[1:16:48] find me." And then something come in his
[1:16:50] mind and says, "Wait, I've got an
[1:16:52] appointment." And I'm going to tell you
[1:16:54] this morning, we have an a divine
[1:16:57] appointment. Amen. We will not die in
[1:17:00] this wilderness of Leodysia. We have a
[1:17:03] divine appointment and it's real in our
[1:17:06] heart. We're not sitting here, I hope I
[1:17:08] can make it. I might make it. If
[1:17:11] everything goes perfect, I'll make it.
[1:17:13] Everything is perfect because God said
[1:17:16] it was perfect.
[1:17:18] We have an idea of what we think is
[1:17:20] perfect. And that becomes our excuse of
[1:17:23] why we don't move forward.
[1:17:29] You never say that. Don't ever let your
[1:17:32] testimony be negative. Let it be
[1:17:34] positive all the time.
[1:17:36] I am
[1:17:38] saved. My goodness, I got mud on my
[1:17:40] face.
[1:17:42] I feel
[1:17:44] horrible. And something comes into your
[1:17:46] heart. In spite of the mud on my face,
[1:17:49] in spite of everything around me, I am
[1:17:52] saved because the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:55] is not defeated.
[1:17:59] But the devil would like you to believe
[1:18:01] that somehow that blood is not
[1:18:03] sufficient.
[1:18:07] I have God in my heart. I believe him
[1:18:09] with all my heart. Do you believe in
[1:18:11] divine healing with all my heart? Let
[1:18:14] your testimony always and your thoughts,
[1:18:17] everything never permit a negative
[1:18:18] thought. Now, I want to ask you, is any
[1:18:20] of us so immune that we don't have this
[1:18:22] battle?
[1:18:24] Every single day.
[1:18:27] But I tell you what we also have is the
[1:18:29] word that we can go back and say, you
[1:18:31] know what, the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:18:33] sufficient. I am saved.
[1:18:36] Amen. I do have affliction in my body. I
[1:18:40] need healing. But he said I'm healed. So
[1:18:42] therefore, I am healed.
[1:18:46] That's right. I've got troubles.
[1:18:50] But he's my peace.
[1:18:53] Amen. We have something to go back to.
[1:18:55] That's right.
[1:19:00] That's your testimony, your thoughts.
[1:19:01] Never permit a negative thought to come
[1:19:03] to your mind. If you can help it when it
[1:19:05] starts that don't entertain it will you
[1:19:07] say I I can't help the thoughts from
[1:19:09] coming. I made a reference to this in
[1:19:11] service the other day. Amen. It'll be
[1:19:13] like the farmer that said he couldn't
[1:19:15] stop the birds from flying over his
[1:19:17] place but he could sure stop them from
[1:19:20] roosting. Hallelujah. I think it's time
[1:19:22] for us to dig our stick the word out.
[1:19:25] Amen. And start knocking these birds
[1:19:27] right off. Amen. not letting them hang
[1:19:30] around to tell us and convince us and to
[1:19:32] make their mess in our life. Amen.
[1:19:37] Hallelujah. Amen. Don't entertain them.
[1:19:39] Pass it on. No, sir. Jesus Christ is my
[1:19:42] savior. All things are mine by God. I'm
[1:19:44] going to keep them. I'm going to testify
[1:19:46] of them. And God can only bless you as
[1:19:49] you confess that he has done it for you.
[1:19:53] Now, I want to tie back to that earlier
[1:19:55] quotations in scripture. My brother and
[1:19:58] sister, you say, "Well, what God has
[1:20:02] done for
[1:20:06] me," you need to just sit here and say,
[1:20:08] "If I don't see healing in this
[1:20:12] body, God is already
[1:20:16] going and bringing and moving
[1:20:20] healing." That's right.
[1:20:24] Does that mean everyone's going to get
[1:20:25] healed? No. The prophet of God shows us
[1:20:27] very clearly that some of us our healing
[1:20:29] will come in our passing over and either
[1:20:33] the rapture or in the body. But when we
[1:20:35] show there, you're not going to find
[1:20:36] anybody hobbling in heaven. No cripples
[1:20:39] in heaven.
[1:20:42] Amen. No diabetics in heaven. Amen. No,
[1:20:47] no issues in the mind. Nothing in
[1:20:50] heaven. It's all done. and my brother
[1:20:52] and sister. And you think about what we
[1:20:54] go through here and we complain and we
[1:20:56] whine and we cry about things and you
[1:20:58] think about what the saints of the ages
[1:21:00] went through. Amen. Some of them
[1:21:02] suffered in the physical body like we
[1:21:05] will never know what suffering is. And
[1:21:08] then we're here to complain because we
[1:21:10] have a backachche, a hip ache, a foot
[1:21:12] ache, a whatever ache. Amen. We complain
[1:21:14] about our circumstances. Oh, life is so
[1:21:17] tight. I only have a couple dollars left
[1:21:19] over. Praise God. You got $2. Amen. Now,
[1:21:22] be good stewards with it. That's right.
[1:21:25] Amen. See, he's the high priest of our
[1:21:27] confession. Amen. Is that right? Hebrews
[1:21:30] 3, he said that he's the high priest of
[1:21:32] our confession. He can only do for us as
[1:21:35] we accept it and believe it and confess
[1:21:38] it. Oh, my brother and sister, let me
[1:21:41] just go a little further here. I'm my
[1:21:44] brain is wanting to sidetrack me and I I
[1:21:46] want to just just uh come here. Amen.
[1:21:50] Rapturing faith. Don't have faith for a
[1:21:54] toothache. Rapturing faith seems so far
[1:21:56] out of line. But let's look at
[1:21:59] this. Rapturing faith. We believe in it,
[1:22:03] don't we? Amen. Amen. That's good
[1:22:05] because it's not your faith anyway.
[1:22:07] That's right. Your faith could never
[1:22:10] human faith could never take you in a
[1:22:13] rapture. Now, if you go back and read in
[1:22:15] the history books, there was a man many
[1:22:18] years ago. So I I I just it's kind of a
[1:22:19] vague memory, but he was starting to
[1:22:22] understand the whole realm of flight. He
[1:22:24] he wanted to fly, had a yearning to fly,
[1:22:27] and he looked around and he saw the
[1:22:29] birds with the feathers and he thought,
[1:22:31] you know, they're really not much
[1:22:33] different than us. And and he glued all
[1:22:35] kinds of feathers on his arms and legs
[1:22:38] and went and jumped off the roof of the
[1:22:39] church.
[1:22:41] They took him to the hospital
[1:22:44] because you see seeing something and it
[1:22:47] being enough revelation to take place. I
[1:22:50] see a rapture. I trust that you see a
[1:22:52] rapture. But my brother and sister, I
[1:22:54] right now cannot step off this platform
[1:22:57] and go in the rapture because God has to
[1:23:00] initiate the rapture in me. It's not
[1:23:02] something I can perform, but God has
[1:23:05] already said it is in you. Amen. The
[1:23:08] word says it is in you. Amen. So in God
[1:23:12] creating this faith, he puts faith where
[1:23:15] faith needs to be.
[1:23:18] I want to bring up Sister Glattis in
[1:23:19] South Africa. Again, she's had problem
[1:23:22] with her eyes for years. She's not very
[1:23:23] well off. She broke her glasses.
[1:23:25] Actually had to go kind of around blind
[1:23:27] for a little while till she saved enough
[1:23:29] money to get a pair of glasses. I'm
[1:23:31] telling you, a different set of
[1:23:32] economics. If I bust my glasses, I go
[1:23:35] down the next day, I get another pair of
[1:23:36] glasses. Amen. And and so here's a
[1:23:39] sister with a with this issue of this
[1:23:41] and and as I've shared with the church
[1:23:43] there, she's sitting in church on that
[1:23:45] Friday. She's looking up there and all
[1:23:46] of a sudden, Brother Paul in the pulpit
[1:23:48] gets all blurry. Amen. And she then
[1:23:51] takes her glasses off to rub her eyes
[1:23:54] and brother Paul in the pulpit is clear.
[1:23:57] Puts them back on, he's blurry. Takes
[1:23:59] them off, he's clear. Amen. And she
[1:24:02] wasn't sitting there in the service
[1:24:04] praying for her eyes. She was there
[1:24:07] saying amen to the word. And God said,
[1:24:10] the fact that she has said amen to my
[1:24:13] word, I'm going to release my faith and
[1:24:17] heal her. And when he released that,
[1:24:20] it's right there with that being the
[1:24:22] farthest from her mind that she receives
[1:24:25] her healing of her eyes. And praise God,
[1:24:28] it wasn't temporary. Amen. It wasn't.
[1:24:31] She didn't even mention it to anybody
[1:24:33] for a little bit because probably the
[1:24:35] human element saying, "But what if? But
[1:24:38] what if?" Not necessarily doubting, not
[1:24:40] afraid, not an anxiety, but what if? And
[1:24:43] amen. When the days went by right there,
[1:24:46] just a few short days, a couple days
[1:24:49] actually, she finally said, "I got to
[1:24:51] testify. I've got to let the world know
[1:24:53] that God healed my eyes." Amen. Now, you
[1:24:57] look at that. That was no way. All the
[1:25:00] time she prayed, "Lord, heal my
[1:25:03] eyes." What she was concerned about was
[1:25:06] actually completely losing her sight.
[1:25:09] That's what bothered her. Yeah. Wearing
[1:25:13] glasses, she could accept that losing
[1:25:16] her sight. Lord, please touch my eyes.
[1:25:22] What if God didn't answer that prayer
[1:25:24] the day she first prayed it?
[1:25:27] Well, I guess I guess I'm just supposed
[1:25:29] to wear glasses the rest of my life. I
[1:25:32] mean, you figure I was 13 when I first
[1:25:34] had to get glasses. That's 50 years.
[1:25:39] Could I tell you how many times I prayed
[1:25:42] for the Lord to touch my eyes?
[1:25:46] I still wear glasses and may well wear
[1:25:49] glasses to the coming of the Lord,
[1:25:53] but I'm believing Sister Glattis's
[1:25:55] testimony. Amen.
[1:25:57] Let it be at a time, Lord, when we least
[1:26:00] expect it. Come and move in our midst,
[1:26:03] Lord, when we least expect it. Amen.
[1:26:06] We're expecting you, Lord, to do
[1:26:08] something in this service today. And
[1:26:10] maybe all that God will do today was
[1:26:13] water the seed of your faith. Amen. That
[1:26:17] he would come down and you would say,
[1:26:19] "You know what, Lord? I I in myself, I
[1:26:21] look and I say, I don't have enough
[1:26:23] faith, but just a second. I have a
[1:26:26] promise that he's going to give me
[1:26:28] faith. I'm not going to miss the rapture
[1:26:30] because I didn't have enough faith. If I
[1:26:32] believe the word, I've lived the word,
[1:26:34] I've honored God with my life, I've done
[1:26:36] all of these actions, I don't want to
[1:26:38] call them works, but done all of these
[1:26:40] actions, when it comes time and God says
[1:26:42] it's rapture time, he's going to put
[1:26:44] rapturing faith right down in you, and
[1:26:47] you are going to respond to that
[1:26:49] rapturing faith. Amen. It might well be
[1:26:52] an amen. midnight hour, in the early
[1:26:54] morning, whatever it might be for you.
[1:26:57] It might be you're laying there in bed
[1:26:58] thinking about the good things that God
[1:27:00] has done for you, and you say, "Thank
[1:27:03] you, Lord." And God said that tipped the
[1:27:05] scale right there. Amen. Hallelujah. You
[1:27:09] see, my brother and sister, he puts
[1:27:11] faith where it needs to be. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:15] Because that quote that I wish now that
[1:27:17] I would have included,
[1:27:19] the prophet of God says, "The pastor's
[1:27:21] faith and your faith together."
[1:27:24] Oh, so maybe the pastor's faith alone
[1:27:27] wouldn't be enough just to pray for them
[1:27:28] and they'd be healed. And the
[1:27:31] individual's faith alone wouldn't be
[1:27:33] enough for them to just receive their
[1:27:35] healing. But they come together. Yeah.
[1:27:39] Okay. Can is it okay with you guys if we
[1:27:42] just now push the pastor out of the
[1:27:44] picture? He talks too much anyway.
[1:27:49] What if our faith That's right. That's
[1:27:51] it. What if our faith What if our faith
[1:27:53] Yeah. What if our faith Y bound
[1:27:57] together? That's it. Does it have to
[1:27:59] have a preacher in it? I don't think so.
[1:28:02] I don't think so. Right. But we can bind
[1:28:05] our faith together. Now imagine if all
[1:28:08] of us sitting here this morning would
[1:28:11] choose and make a decision to bind our
[1:28:14] faith together. Hallelujah. That's
[1:28:17] right. What a difference it would make
[1:28:18] in the atmosphere of Grace Tabernacle.
[1:28:21] The difference it would make in our
[1:28:22] children's lives and our marriages and
[1:28:25] our own personal life if we'd all bind
[1:28:28] our faith together. But it's not going
[1:28:30] to work if it's just our little faith
[1:28:32] and our little faith and they have their
[1:28:34] faith and we have our faith. No, my
[1:28:37] brother and sister, we've got to have
[1:28:38] his faith. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:28:43] Amen. We got to go forward and believe
[1:28:46] as I've already spoken. Amen. God
[1:28:48] promised he would meet you in that
[1:28:50] little room. Amen. He's not going to
[1:28:54] send an
[1:28:56] ambassador.
[1:28:57] Amen. Oh, our pastor so spiritual. We'll
[1:29:01] send him to the little room for us. I'm
[1:29:04] sorry you Catholics. That's not going to
[1:29:06] work. You can't send someone else to
[1:29:10] receive your blessing for you. You've
[1:29:14] got to show up to that little room
[1:29:16] yourself.
[1:29:18] Amen. Now, Psalm 37:23 says, "The steps
[1:29:22] of a good man are ordered by the Lord,
[1:29:25] and he delightth in his way." So, every
[1:29:28] good step that you take in your
[1:29:31] life, yes, that's because you're good
[1:29:33] people.
[1:29:35] Every step has already been ordered. Who
[1:29:37] ordered that? Can I order your steps? I
[1:29:41] if I order if I can order your steps
[1:29:44] today and then God will bless you
[1:29:45] because of that, then I'm going to start
[1:29:47] ordering you. But it doesn't work that
[1:29:50] way. Amen. It's God who does the
[1:29:53] ordering. Amen. And every one of us
[1:29:56] binding our faith together is
[1:29:58] encouraging one another to move forward.
[1:30:01] To move forward.
[1:30:08] back into the message, the countdown,
[1:30:10] paragraph
[1:30:13] 76. Are we doing okay this morning?
[1:30:17] Okay, so they got in their great big
[1:30:20] scientific tube here not long ago,
[1:30:22] astronaut tube, and they're taking the
[1:30:25] countdown now, headed for the moon.
[1:30:29] They're getting off of here, too.
[1:30:32] They've got an a astronaut in a big tube
[1:30:34] powered by atomic power and they can
[1:30:36] send it plum to the moon. They claim
[1:30:38] they got in their tube and are waiting
[1:30:40] for the countdown. The spiritual
[1:30:43] astronaut, that's us. Okay. The
[1:30:46] spiritual astronaut got in Christ and is
[1:30:50] listening to the countdown of the word.
[1:30:54] Oh, think about it, my brother and
[1:30:56] sister. I'm going to get sidetracked for
[1:30:57] a moment. Forgive me. But we are here.
[1:31:00] Oh my. The prophet of God says when the
[1:31:03] pope comes from America, "Oh, praise
[1:31:07] God. It's all over." No, my brother and
[1:31:08] sister, the prophet's telling us those
[1:31:11] are a sign of the end time. He didn't
[1:31:14] say that it's going to be next week or
[1:31:16] next month and this is going to be the
[1:31:17] whole thing. Because I'll tell you what
[1:31:19] happens. There's a people right now that
[1:31:21] are all in a tizzy over the pope from
[1:31:24] America. But you give it six months or a
[1:31:27] year and they'll be right back in the
[1:31:28] same rut they were in. Right? Amen.
[1:31:30] They'll be back right in the same
[1:31:32] spiritual position they were in when
[1:31:34] they announced the pope was from
[1:31:36] America. Because you see, it's just the
[1:31:39] fact that you saw that take place is not
[1:31:42] what's going to get you ready. It's when
[1:31:45] that is there a sign to you. Amen. We
[1:31:48] see signs in the heavens. We see signs
[1:31:51] in the earth. We see signs in the word.
[1:31:53] And the prophet of God then says it's
[1:31:56] there the countdown of the word. Amen.
[1:32:00] What is it? It's not what's happening
[1:32:02] out there, my brother and sister, that
[1:32:04] determines where we're at. It's what's
[1:32:06] happening in here is what determines
[1:32:08] what's happening. Amen. So they will do
[1:32:12] what they are going to
[1:32:14] do. I thought we lived in Sodom for a
[1:32:17] lot of years now. We were plum over on
[1:32:19] Garity in the church over there. I
[1:32:21] preached this sermon about it's got to
[1:32:24] happen soon. We're in Sodom and I don't
[1:32:26] know how many years. Maybe Sister Jerry
[1:32:28] could help me. It's got to be at least
[1:32:29] 15 years ago. 20 years ago. I thought we
[1:32:34] were in Sodom 20 years
[1:32:37] ago. And this might be it turns out to
[1:32:40] be the Pope that lives to be about 120
[1:32:42] years old. Who knows? But that has
[1:32:44] nothing to do with you. That's right.
[1:32:46] Our position is in the countdown of the
[1:32:50] word.
[1:32:52] Amen. Oh yeah. These things got to
[1:32:54] happen. The word said it would happen.
[1:32:56] Amen. It was prophesied. It will happen.
[1:32:59] But I want to know, my brother and
[1:33:00] sister, how you feel about the prophecy
[1:33:02] concerning you. It's counting down. It's
[1:33:06] coming to its fulfillment each day.
[1:33:09] Counting down. Counting down. And we
[1:33:11] need to wake up and say, "What happens
[1:33:13] out there?" Amen. Yeah. It's evidence.
[1:33:16] It's taking place. But what happens
[1:33:18] right here is what really matters.
[1:33:22] Amen. Not looking for something else to
[1:33:24] motivate you. But let the word of God,
[1:33:26] let the Holy Spirit motivate you.
[1:33:30] Amen. Listening to the countdown of the
[1:33:33] word. Now, you Lutheran ought to shout.
[1:33:35] You Baptist and Presbyterian, watch the
[1:33:38] countdown of the word. Oh my. Countdown
[1:33:40] of the word. My, this is what caught my
[1:33:43] attention. Why I use this title, my
[1:33:45] brother and sister, because right here
[1:33:46] in this space, three times he comes
[1:33:49] down, countdown of the word, countdown
[1:33:51] of the word, countdown of the word. And
[1:33:53] I think he's trying to tell us
[1:33:54] something. What do you think? I think
[1:33:57] he's trying to convey to us that that we
[1:33:59] ought to be looking at the countdown of
[1:34:01] the word.
[1:34:06] They're headed for heaven, right? Not
[1:34:08] the moon. They'll pass the moon so fast
[1:34:11] they won't even see it. Oh my. Waiting
[1:34:13] for the countdown. Yes, sir. Waiting for
[1:34:16] the countdown is right. Amen. Taking
[1:34:20] off. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:34:24] Oh my. Now look at
[1:34:27] this. What are they
[1:34:29] doing? They're wrapped in Christ. It's
[1:34:33] not like getting on an
[1:34:34] airliner. Airliner, you don't walk down
[1:34:36] to seat, you know, 18 B or whatever C. I
[1:34:43] I like aisle seats. So, we're going to
[1:34:44] be in C. They don't come there and then
[1:34:47] pull a big blanket around the seat and
[1:34:50] wrap you in and then seat belt
[1:34:54] you. No. On every flight I've ever taken
[1:34:57] my life, you hear a steartus, sir,
[1:35:00] please put on your seat belt. She comes
[1:35:02] back by a couple minutes later. Sir,
[1:35:05] please put on your seat belt. Not that
[1:35:07] long ago, I believe it's when we went
[1:35:09] down to see Brother Persant, sister
[1:35:10] Koncha, the stewardist comes by the
[1:35:12] third time and says, "Sir, if you don't
[1:35:14] put on your seat
[1:35:19] belt, pause, what is she going to
[1:35:24] say? They'll haul you off the
[1:35:29] flight." The guy's wife, put your
[1:35:31] seatelt
[1:35:33] on. Then he obeyed. I wonder if there's
[1:35:36] any connection there.
[1:35:38] Anyway, but you see my brother and
[1:35:45] sister I I need to bind my They're
[1:35:49] wrapped in Christ. You know what
[1:35:52] something wrapped
[1:35:53] is? You give a gift. I I don't know. I
[1:35:57] don't want them to see what I got them
[1:35:58] for their birthday or graduation. So,
[1:36:01] I'm going to wrap the sides and leave
[1:36:03] the top and bottom open.
[1:36:05] No, it doesn't work that way. Wrap is
[1:36:08] fully enveloped.
[1:36:11] So, I want to want to just make sure
[1:36:13] we're on the same page with the prophet
[1:36:14] here. They're wrapped in Christ in
[1:36:18] rapturing grace.
[1:36:21] Oh my goodness. This whole time I
[1:36:22] thought the only thing that mattered was
[1:36:24] rapturing faith.
[1:36:27] But we come down to this place now. What
[1:36:28] is what is grace?
[1:36:33] What is grace, saints?
[1:36:36] divine enablement, unmmerited favor.
[1:36:40] So we are wrapped now in
[1:36:46] unmmerited favor to make a rapture.
[1:36:50] And this whole time you thought you had
[1:36:52] to have enough faith to get off the face
[1:36:53] of this earth. Amen. But let me tell
[1:36:55] you, the unmmerited favor is God coming
[1:36:58] down and anointing your soul and saying,
[1:37:01] "I have faith. This word is true." The
[1:37:04] word is trying to wrap itself around me.
[1:37:06] I'm not going to push it away. I'm not
[1:37:08] going to fight with it. I'm not going to
[1:37:09] struggle. I'm going to let unmmerited
[1:37:11] favor wrap me up and take me into the
[1:37:15] presence of almighty God. No works that
[1:37:18] I can do. Nothing I can accomplish. This
[1:37:21] brings clarity to what the Apostle Paul
[1:37:24] is speaking there. Not as though I had
[1:37:27] already attained. He knew he didn't have
[1:37:30] it, but he knew who did have it. Amen.
[1:37:33] and was receiving that unmmerited favor
[1:37:36] of a rapturing faith. Amen. Oh, it ties
[1:37:40] together. They don't butt heads, my
[1:37:41] brother and sister. It ties together so
[1:37:44] beautifully. Nothing they did
[1:37:46] themselves. Christ took the
[1:37:48] uneducated, the foolish things of the
[1:37:50] world, wrapped his astronauts in it, and
[1:37:53] empowered them with the Holy
[1:37:56] Ghost. Wow.
[1:37:59] maybe
[1:38:01] maybe lights the
[1:38:05] fuse. I seen a little documentary about
[1:38:08] some Balmer guy back east on the east
[1:38:10] coast here. I don't know. I think that
[1:38:11] was in the early
[1:38:13] 90s. And um they told the guy, you know,
[1:38:16] come out. We have a marksman. He can see
[1:38:20] you. He's going to shoot
[1:38:21] you. Come out. Come out now.
[1:38:27] Anyway, he came out. They started to
[1:38:31] realize that he had lit this bundle of
[1:38:35] dynamite. And then he walks
[1:38:38] out and they're all
[1:38:40] scrambling cuz it's a
[1:38:43] bomb. But when you make dynamite out of
[1:38:46] road
[1:38:46] flares, it only flashes for just a
[1:38:49] minute or two and then it's all over.
[1:38:54] Not even a
[1:38:58] bang and they shot
[1:39:00] him. So he died for a road
[1:39:04] flare. My brother and sister, I don't
[1:39:07] want to die just over the concept of a
[1:39:12] rapture. I want to die daily to the real
[1:39:16] thing that's getting me out of here.
[1:39:22] Hallelujah.
[1:39:24] Somehow he had it in his mind that he
[1:39:27] was going to somehow still blow up the
[1:39:29] building, but he didn't know that a
[1:39:31] flare won't do that. Caught the carpet
[1:39:34] on fire is all he
[1:39:35] accomplished. So, he's wrapped his
[1:39:39] astronauts in it and empowered them with
[1:39:42] the Holy Ghost. Now, I'm telling you,
[1:39:44] don't misunderstand what I'm saying.
[1:39:45] Brother David preaches a lot about the
[1:39:46] Holy Ghost, and I'll tell you why I
[1:39:48] fully support every time he preaches
[1:39:51] about the Holy Ghost. Because if you
[1:39:53] want to be
[1:39:55] empowered, you're going to have to have
[1:39:57] the Holy Ghost. Amen. Not just believe
[1:40:00] the message, you got to have the Holy
[1:40:02] Ghost. There's where it empowers us to
[1:40:05] get out of here to in the prophet's
[1:40:08] words to take off. Hallelujah. The world
[1:40:11] is going to be left alone. That's right.
[1:40:13] Taking off.
[1:40:16] Can I have just a couple more minutes,
[1:40:18] please?
[1:40:20] So, rapturing grace is unmmerited
[1:40:24] favor. And that's not trying to figure
[1:40:27] out how you're going to make the
[1:40:28] rapture. That's you believing. Believing
[1:40:30] that the Lord has called you and you
[1:40:33] look at your life and I just want to ask
[1:40:35] you, can you stop for just a moment and
[1:40:38] just look at your life?
[1:40:43] Can you see unmmerited favor? Amen. In
[1:40:47] your life.
[1:40:51] If you can't see unmmerited favor in
[1:40:53] your life, I question your perspective.
[1:41:02] Was that blunt enough or should I make
[1:41:05] it bluntter?
[1:41:08] Blunter. Okay. Thank you.
[1:41:11] If you can't see unmmerited favor in
[1:41:12] your life, you need to find this altar.
[1:41:14] That's it.
[1:41:16] Because God has been there with you.
[1:41:18] That's right. Every circumstance, good
[1:41:21] and bad. And if you think you've got it
[1:41:23] so bad, just remember it was unmmerited
[1:41:26] favor that called Rahab out. That's
[1:41:28] right. Amen.
[1:41:31] An unmmerited
[1:41:33] favor gave her for a husband, a man
[1:41:36] predestinated to be in the lineage of
[1:41:39] Jesus Christ.
[1:41:41] Is this a story of a gentile or not? My
[1:41:44] brother and sister, you see, unmmerited
[1:41:46] favor is in every aspect of our life.
[1:41:50] Also in the countdown, if you don't
[1:41:52] mind, now the first thing is these
[1:41:54] things that we're talking about are so
[1:41:56] are they not. We know the Bible promised
[1:41:59] it. But is he here?
[1:42:02] God is here to do what we what he
[1:42:05] promised that he would do. God is here.
[1:42:10] I want to Can we say that God is here?
[1:42:14] Amen.
[1:42:16] To do what he promised that he would do.
[1:42:18] God is here. So, we've gone beyond
[1:42:21] speaking with tongues. That's all right.
[1:42:24] See, we've gone beyond these little
[1:42:26] things and we're into a place now where
[1:42:30] we got to have astronaut faith. That's
[1:42:32] astronaut power to realize that we're in
[1:42:35] Christ. Amen. Already. Already.
[1:42:40] Amen. Now, Brother Trevor, you responded
[1:42:43] quickly there. Let's stop and see if we
[1:42:45] can't find a way to say that already
[1:42:48] means somewhere in the future. No sir.
[1:42:52] Someday if
[1:42:55] no sir, you think that the prophet of
[1:42:57] God was just speaking and that's the
[1:42:58] word that he just come up with. No, my
[1:43:01] brother and sister, I put value in how
[1:43:03] these words come together because if you
[1:43:06] question these words as some are in this
[1:43:08] day, questioning the vocabulary and the
[1:43:12] understanding, it didn't have an
[1:43:13] education. You question that, then
[1:43:15] everything falls in question. That's
[1:43:17] right. That's right. Amen. But he's
[1:43:19] saying there now look we're in this
[1:43:22] place. We got to have astronaut faith
[1:43:24] that astronaut powers to realize that
[1:43:25] we're in Christ already. Now in this
[1:43:29] message if you're not familiar with it,
[1:43:31] brother Brandham is using a phrase
[1:43:33] starting off the horse and buggy and
[1:43:34] moving forward to the car and all of
[1:43:36] these things. Just more power. That's
[1:43:40] right. Just more horsepower. Just more
[1:43:43] power. More power. More power. More
[1:43:47] power. Yeah.
[1:43:49] Amen. Ah, just more of Christ. Can I Can
[1:43:54] I have permission just for a moment to
[1:43:56] do an edit?
[1:43:59] Just more power. Amen.
[1:44:04] Because Christ is power. That's right.
[1:44:07] To the bride of Christ. Amen. She He is
[1:44:10] the authority to his wife. Amen. To see
[1:44:14] to lift us up into heavenly places. Now,
[1:44:16] if we sit here this morning, I hope you
[1:44:18] don't get offended at this. We sit here
[1:44:20] this morning, we say we believe this
[1:44:22] word, we believe it with all that's in
[1:44:23] us, and then we doubt that we have the
[1:44:25] power to overcome, to live this life, to
[1:44:28] fulfill this word. My brother and
[1:44:30] sister, the devil's been lying to you.
[1:44:32] He's whispering in the other ear. And
[1:44:34] you need to just take and put a a ear
[1:44:37] plug or something in the ear that the
[1:44:39] devil's whispering in. And you need to
[1:44:41] just listen to the word because you see
[1:44:43] we can't be lifted into heavenly places
[1:44:46] without being empowered by the Holy
[1:44:49] Ghost to do it. Amen. God help us. God
[1:44:52] help us.
[1:44:56] Amen. Sister Vikica, if you would come
[1:44:59] please. Musicians, would you please
[1:45:03] come? Please bear with my
[1:45:06] words. It's time saints.
[1:45:11] to receive fully That's right. what
[1:45:14] we've already received. Amen.
[1:45:18] Not just a partial. That's right. But to
[1:45:21] fully receive it. Really, really receive
[1:45:26] what's been given to us.
[1:45:28] And also time for us to find out fully
[1:45:32] what the Lord has already achieved for
[1:45:36] us.
[1:45:40] Who wants to settle for partial
[1:45:41] salvation?
[1:45:44] Who wants to settle for partial faith,
[1:45:47] for partial anything?
[1:45:50] That's right. Amen. Amen. Come on. We
[1:45:54] sit and say, "Well, I I know, but
[1:45:56] there's got to be
[1:46:00] more." That's right. It never stops.
[1:46:04] That's right. the revelation of Jesus
[1:46:07] Christ. Now, people would maybe argue,
[1:46:10] do you have a quote for this? Well,
[1:46:12] yeah, it's not quite in the words that
[1:46:13] would prove it to them, but after all,
[1:46:15] they're not very good at reading between
[1:46:17] lines, so they wouldn't get it anyhow.
[1:46:19] That's right. That my brother and
[1:46:22] sister, the revelation will still be
[1:46:25] coming to us. Amen. Even when we're
[1:46:27] standing in his presence. That's exactly
[1:46:30] right. Absolutely right. Use it to the
[1:46:32] natural side, Sister Jerry. and I 42
[1:46:35] years. Brother David, sister Diane, many
[1:46:39] more. Hope you guys had a wonderful
[1:46:42] trip. 42
[1:46:46] years. Do I fully understand Sister
[1:46:52] Jerry? Not a
[1:46:55] chance. Oh, I'm not picking on Sister
[1:46:57] Jerry. Don't misunderstand.
[1:47:00] But you see, as she matured and I
[1:47:04] matured, we've been
[1:47:07] changing. And if this word is not
[1:47:09] maturing you, this word is not changing
[1:47:12] you. That's it. If you have just the
[1:47:15] same love, now see, there'll be people
[1:47:18] like, oh, oh, the scripture says the
[1:47:20] first love. But I want you to understand
[1:47:22] as Christians, as humans, our first love
[1:47:26] was so immature,
[1:47:28] right?
[1:47:29] so
[1:47:31] immature. I don't want to sound crass
[1:47:33] here or I'm not supposed to use that
[1:47:35] word. Sister Jerry's forbidden me. I'm
[1:47:37] sorry. Uh I I don't want to sound rude.
[1:47:41] But every young couple that gets
[1:47:43] married, there's a certain element that
[1:47:45] is just strictly physical
[1:47:50] attraction. I hope that never dies.
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:47:55] But as the guy goes bald and gets a
[1:47:57] little pudgy and you know she's had
[1:48:00] several children and whatever, we can't
[1:48:03] go back and say, "Oh, that was just the
[1:48:05] girl I was in love with." No. See, it
[1:48:09] deepens and deepens and deepens and
[1:48:11] deepens and deepens and becomes a love
[1:48:16] that is they describe as enduring.
[1:48:20] stands the test of time and for sickness
[1:48:24] and poverty and all of these things.
[1:48:28] It's enduring. And the saints of old in
[1:48:31] the dark ages, my brother and
[1:48:33] sister, they didn't live just upon the
[1:48:36] freshness of the first relationship with
[1:48:40] Jesus Christ. By the time they come to
[1:48:43] give their life, it was life to them.
[1:48:47] And that's what God has done for us.
[1:48:50] Amen. Amen. Let the countdown of the
[1:48:55] word continue to mature us and bring us
[1:48:59] to a place that we're willing to come
[1:49:01] and say, "If the Lord even in this day
[1:49:05] called on me to give my life physically,
[1:49:08] could I do it?"
[1:49:11] Amen. A man who loves his wife and his
[1:49:14] children will give his life for his
[1:49:17] wife. Amen. And his children.
[1:49:20] Amen. Let us be those kind of
[1:49:23] Christians. Amen. Let's just
[1:49:25] stand. Amen. Sing a song or two. Brother
[1:49:28] Alex, if you would
[1:49:30] come.
[1:49:34] Hallelujah. Number eight, Brother Isaac.
[1:49:37] This really really struck me as I was
[1:49:41] studying and stuff. Come to a place I
[1:49:45] know it was the blood. Hallelujah.
[1:49:47] Changed my life was the blood. Not
[1:49:50] intellectual
[1:49:51] concept but the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:55] Amen. I know it was the blood. I know it
[1:50:00] was the blood. I know it was the blood
[1:50:05] for me.
[1:50:08] One day when Paul was lost, he died upon
[1:50:13] the cross. I know it was the blood for
[1:50:19] me. Well, there's power in the blood.
[1:50:23] Oh, there's power in the blood. There's
[1:50:27] power in the blood for me.
[1:50:33] One day when I was lost, he died upon
[1:50:37] the cross. There's power in the blood
[1:50:42] for
[1:50:43] me. Well, there's healing in the blood.
[1:50:48] There's healing in the blood. There's
[1:50:51] healing in the blood for me.
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:50:57] One day when I was lost, he died upon
[1:51:02] the cross. There's healing in the blood
[1:51:06] for
[1:51:08] me. Well, I know it was the blood. I
[1:51:13] know it was the blood. I know it was the
[1:51:17] blood for me.
[1:51:22] One day when I was lost, he died upon
[1:51:26] the cross. I know it was the blood for
[1:51:33] me. Hallelujah. Amen. 102. Brother
[1:51:37] Isaac.
[1:51:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:43] Brother Alex, as you lead us. Amen.
[1:51:48] In the name of Jesus.
[1:51:51] In the name of
[1:51:53] Jesus. We have the
[1:51:59] victory. In the name of
[1:52:02] Jesus. In the name of
[1:52:05] Jesus. Demands will.
[1:52:12] For when we stand in the name of
[1:52:18] Jesus, tell me who can stand
[1:52:24] before. In the
[1:52:27] preious name of
[1:52:30] Jesus, we have the
[1:52:36] victory in the name of Jesus.
[1:52:40] In the name of
[1:52:42] Jesus, I have the
[1:52:48] victory. In the name of
[1:52:51] Jesus, in the name of
[1:52:54] Jesus, demons will have to flee.
[1:53:01] For when I stand in the name of
[1:53:06] Jesus, tell me who can stand
[1:53:13] before in the preious name of
[1:53:19] Jesus. I have the
[1:53:22] victory when I stand.
[1:53:25] For when I stand in the name of
[1:53:31] Jesus, tell me who can stand
[1:53:37] before. In the
[1:53:40] preious name of
[1:53:43] Jesus, I have the
[1:53:49] victory. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:53:52] Let's uh Can you find that song Ready to
[1:53:54] Leave? I think it's the key of
[1:53:59] G. Some folks are building hopes down
[1:54:03] here. They're planning
[1:54:05] ahead. So busy with their fortunes, they
[1:54:09] forgot what Jesus
[1:54:13] said about the wars and earthquakes and
[1:54:17] the fig tree's burning leaves. But
[1:54:20] there's a group of people getting ready
[1:54:24] to
[1:54:25] leave. Ready to leave in the twinkling
[1:54:30] of an
[1:54:31] eye. Making investments in that bank up
[1:54:36] in the
[1:54:37] sky. Happy preparation, not a reason to
[1:54:43] grieve. Are you in that number? getting
[1:54:47] ready to
[1:54:49] leave. Sinner, what's the reason for
[1:54:53] your needless
[1:54:56] delay? While you're hesitating, Christ
[1:54:59] could come just any
[1:55:03] day. So he the spirit's calling. Make
[1:55:07] your way to
[1:55:09] Calvary and get in that number. Getting
[1:55:13] ready to
[1:55:15] leave. Ready to leave in the twinkling
[1:55:20] of an
[1:55:21] eye. Making investments in that makeup
[1:55:26] in the
[1:55:27] sky. Happy preparation not a reason to
[1:55:33] grieve. Are you in that number getting
[1:55:37] ready to leave?
[1:55:40] Ready to leave in the twinkling of an
[1:55:45] eye. Making investments in that bank up
[1:55:50] in the
[1:55:51] sky. Happy preparation not a reason to
[1:55:58] grieve. Are you in that number getting
[1:56:02] ready to leave? Oh, are you in that
[1:56:06] number getting ready to
[1:56:11] leave? Amen. Praise the Lord. We have
[1:56:14] one more song before we close. Um just a
[1:56:17] reminder that we have communion today at
[1:56:19] 5:00. Um I just look forward to it. It's
[1:56:21] always very encouraging and blessed time
[1:56:23] and good time we have
[1:56:25] together. Amen. Look forward to seeing
[1:56:27] you there. Number 565, please.
[1:56:30] [Music]
[1:56:35] Put it
[1:56:40] up. I don't
[1:56:42] [Music]
[1:56:45] know about
[1:56:50] tomorrow. I just
[1:56:54] live from day to
[1:56:59] day. And I don't
[1:57:04] borrow from it
[1:57:09] sunshine for its
[1:57:13] skies may turn to gray.
[1:57:19] And I don't
[1:57:24] worry the
[1:57:28] future for I
[1:57:32] know what Jesus said.
[1:57:38] And
[1:57:41] today I'll walk
[1:57:44] beside
[1:57:46] him for he
[1:57:51] knows what is ahead.
[1:58:00] anything about
[1:58:05] tomorrow. I don't
[1:58:09] seem to
[1:58:15] understand. But I
[1:58:19] know who holds tomorrow.
[1:58:25] And I
[1:58:28] know who holds my
[1:58:33] hand. And every
[1:58:38] step is getting brighter.
[1:58:44] as the
[1:58:47] goal. Then stairs I
[1:58:52] climb. Every
[1:58:57] bird's getting
[1:59:02] lighter. Every
[1:59:06] cloud is silver
[1:59:11] light. And there the
[1:59:15] sun is always
[1:59:21] shining. Bear no
[1:59:25] tear will dim the eye.
[1:59:31] And at the
[1:59:35] ending of the
[1:59:39] rainbow where the
[1:59:44] mountains touch the
[1:59:49] sky, many
[1:59:53] things about
[1:59:58] tomorrow I don't
[2:00:02] see to
[2:00:08] understand. But I
[2:00:12] know who holds
[2:00:17] tomorrow. And I
[2:00:21] know who holds my hand.
[2:00:27] And I don't
[2:00:31] know about
[2:00:36] tomorrow. It may
[2:00:40] bring me poverty.
[2:00:46] But the
[2:00:49] one who feeds the
[2:00:55] sparrow is the
[2:00:59] one who stands for me.
[2:01:05] And the
[2:01:08] path that be my
[2:01:14] portion may be
[2:01:18] through the flame or
[2:01:23] flood, but his
[2:01:28] presence goes before
[2:01:33] me and I'm
[2:01:37] God covered with his
[2:01:42] blood and many
[2:01:47] things about
[2:01:52] tomorrow I don't
[2:01:56] seem to
[2:01:58] [Music]
[2:02:01] understand but I
[2:02:05] know who holds
[2:02:10] tomorrow. And I
[2:02:14] know who holds my
[2:02:19] hand. Amen. You're dismissed. God bless
[2:02:22] you.
