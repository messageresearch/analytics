this morning so first off I'd like to say there uh so because of the uh everybody traveling next week um there will be no Serv there'll be practically nobody here so um so no service next Sunday and then um you you going to come up or would like our good to be in the house of the Lord today amen real blessing um you know sometimes um you know as they say the clock keeps on ticking doesn't stop for anything you know as we look we look back through the years and uh God is faithful we see some um stalwart uh saints of God and their labors for the kingdom and what what they have done they've done selflessly they've never looked for any attention and uh you know in that uh the years just tick by and we tend to kind of just take things for granted and um you know uh today we want to just uh uh give a little Accolade to an individual in our ch church that probably will not appreciate me doing this but we are going to anyhow and we will suffer any consequences we want to acknowledge our sister Diane and her many years of of uh Devotion to our youth Sunday school always faithful just there her whole desire just has been to see our our children have a good foundation be able to uh step out into Life as we go into adulthood to step out into life uh knowing who you are young people and uh you know you might not appreciate as much as as kind of you should uh until you've been the one who never had anything like that and uh you know you realize that there's something special uh being poured out uh um and uh we're going to just before we go any further just ask our sister Ruth she had a couple words she wanted to share and sister Diane's eyebrows just shot to the roof uh but uh I you know we can always edit the the service sister Diane so sister Ruth if you just come um I just want to say this is really off the cuff but um some early memories of Mama teach in Sunday school I was these kids age I was really young when Mom started teaching and maybe it's even before I can remember but when I can remember Daddy was pastor and sometime it would just be me my brother and my sister but she made a point to have Sunday school and sometimes it was you know a few songs and what I sometimes I don't remember what she taught me but it started way back and then from then on um just is each year progressed she taught us as well but and then I got out we had a bigger assembly and we had other Sunday school teachers and the ages changed but I just want to appreciate her sacrifice Amen to to do that even when it was basically her three kids maybe you know she made a point to do that and it affected my life I know that now it it was still instrumental and and when I gave my heart to the Lord it planted those right seeds and it influenced my life and she could have easily said oh it's just my three kids I see them all week long you know but it was different in a Sunday school study it taught taught me what it meant right to have Sunday School number one and that it wasn't just a oh you know it's just Mom up there it was it was different I realized it was a moment that was sacred and it was a time where it was opening our hearts not only when I eventually gave my heart to God but for the service to set an atmosphere for us kids of reverence and I just want to say how much I appreciate her sacrifice and her willingness to do that all of these years and even up until you know just recently so um anyway I love her and I appreciate all she's done amen amen hallelujah you know it's U it's just a lovely thing and um when you think about that um you know how difficult it can be sometimes to fully express yourself if it is just your own children if it is just a small group and uh but to see the years of faithful Service uh is is um so important so incredible and sister Diane I I I know you'll forgive me over time but if you'll come Amen Brother David help lift her out of the chair I'm supposed to be close to the microphone here so sister Diane here is a card that has um many signatures autographs however you want to put that I believe each one of those expresses the love of the young people and certainly sister Jerry and I unfortunately she wasn't well to come this morning but this is is just a token of our love uh and uh I pray that that it would touch your heart um as each one of those give something of love and and this is a little gift from the assembly from the Saints for you to um spend any way you please and um it being what it is is still not monetary but it is a token of our love and appreciation for what you have done through the years and your faithfulness in this assembly uh may God bless you beyond measure [Applause] amen amen amen oh let's remember brother Roman in prayer oh right I think you had your surgery this last week is that right yeah I think so he doesn't understand English I forgot yeah amen ah let's see here where was I let's just sing number I'm going to go back to the other one I had um

with Verse 14- 18 Ruth chapter 1 beginning with 14- 18 and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpa kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth clave onto her amen and she said behold thy sister-in-law is gone back onto her people and onto her Gods return Thou after thy sister law and Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my Goden where thou dest I will die and where will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if out but death part thee and me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking onto her let's bow our heads dear heavenly father this morning Lord we thank you so much for allowing us to be in your house Lord amen we came here to hear from you Lord please Lord speak to us this morning you know the needs of the people Lord and I ask you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to bless your word this morning amen amen you may have your seats now before I start my little message that I have this morning because we are still in the Thanksgiving week I just want to take a few moments to give my my than and um the first things that I want to give is to the Lord amen and uh sometimes we forget the main thing and I've heard a a minister one time say this and it took me a second to understand it but it really stuck with me and this this is what he said he said the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing amen amen so this morning the main thing for you and I is that the Lord chose me and he chose youen to reveal his word amen amen now we live in an age where at Each corner there's a church there's a Ministry but the Lord chose you and he chose us not that we're better than them this is not we're better they're better God put something in you and I and he knew that at the right moment something will spark yeah at the right moment when when the word of God will come into you it'll flourish why because he chose you and he chose I that's right and I I'm so thankful for that are you thankful for that this morning amen I am definitely thankful I didn't deserve it there's nothing that I could have done or I could do to help it he just did it amen and I say thank you Jesus amen the second thing that I want to be thankful for is the congregation and I'm very thankful that you're always embracing us with such warmth and you make us feel like home and I'm very thankful and that comes from from the bottom of my heart I thank you so much for making us feel welcome for taking our family in and and being you know supportive to us and and we thank you so much the next thing that I want to be thankful for is a Godly Pastor that God gave us amen I promise you he hasn't paid me to say anything but I want to give thanks to God that He gave us a pastor that has been there and will be there for us now it's not easy to be a pastor you have to leave many times your own family your own um whatever you do in your job and you have to tend to people and it's not easy and I I always pray for brother Paul and I don't say this to show off but I keep him in my prayers he needs it and and and I'm so thankful that God gave us a pastor amen that goes by this amen amen he's the one through God that leads us to pastures and he's the one that the Lord puts on his heart what to speak yes and and I'm so thankful for that amen and you know what they say behind every great Pastor there's a wife and I say God bless sister Jerry and and we we ask the Lord to bless her and to make her feel better and so she can be with us back in the house of the Lord and and we're thankful for that I'm also thankful for my family my parents that raised me in a Christian home I'm thankful for them I'm also thankful for my wife sometimes we just take things for granted and we don't we don't appreciate a lot of the times what they do but there's a lot of stuff that they do behind closed door that maybe you and I as husbands don't even realize and we're we're thankful for that I'm thankful for my children God has blessed us with five beautiful children and I pray and my heart's desire is that they will serve the Lord with all their hearts amen just like every parent wants for their children and I'm so thankful for them and I appreciate them and the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing God gave us something let's not take it for granted and sometimes we forget and we get so busy with the daily chores that we have to do but every once in a while let's just stop from what we're doing and say Lord thank you yes that it have to be me but Lord I just want to say thank you you know sometimes we wait until our car is broken down to realize how important that car that vehicle is for us now every morning when you go to work you just crank that engine up and it goes right to work and it takes you there but let's not get to a situation where the car's broken down and then we realize how important it is let's just stop a second and say Lord thank youen thank you Lord thank you Jesus amen for being with me for protecting me for going there ahead of me you know so many times we walk out of the house and maybe it just happens that we're just a few minutes late or a few minutes early but we don't realize all that God did for us in those few minutes yeah and you pass by an accident on the road and that could have been you there's so many things that we don't know that God does behind that's right I'm thankful for that amen Lord I'm thankful for the things that I know but I'm also thankful for the things that I don't know amen thank you Lord thank you Lord this morning the title for my sermon this morning is Ruth The Chosen moabit now we all know the story of Ruth and I'm not going to spend too much time um but I do want to emphasize that Naomi and her husband and her two sons they relocated from the promised land to Moab and search for food it was a famine in the promised land and um we see that the story turns very tragic all of a sudden and her husband dies and then her two sons die now from a cardinal perspective if you look at it you know someone could say what a tragedy for this family you know um not only that her husband died but her two sons died yes what a tragedy you know and and and and from a cardinal perspective yes that's that's how it is but you do realize that everything that happens happens for a reason amen word and what people look at and say what a tragedy the Lord says I'm here amen now I'm going to start my work when everybody thinks everything is done for there's no more hope there's no more everything is done to the ground the Lord says now I'm coming amen that's God's timing that's God's timing and so we see that after her two sons and her husbands uh her husband died um Naomi comes to a point to where she says well now I'm going to return back to my land there's not much for me here I've heard that uh the promised land is doing much better now so we're we're we're going to go and she comes to a point where she's talking to her daughter-in-laws now Ora and Ruth um you know Naomi told tells them there's no more son that I can give you there's nothing more that I can do for you and and I just want to stop here for just a second and I want to analyze a little bit Ora and I want to analyze a little bit Ruth because there are two very different characters so if we look at Ora just a little bit you know her mother-in-law says please go back to your people you know go back to your gods and um you know I'm just visualizing what orfa went through you know she said well I guess Naomi doesn't have nothing to offer me anymore um you know that she did everything she could for me um you know I'm just going to go back to my old ways um you know going to go back to my own Gods that's what the Bible says that she went back to her own Gods um and uh you know she um the problem was that she still desired that old life that she had right she she didn't she didn't think Naomi has anything to offer her and you know she was thinking about her family her parents you know the way she was brought up and she said you know what that actually sounds good I think I think I might just go back to my old ways um you know and and and uh um this reminds me a lot of the people of Israel when they went out of Egypt and they came to a point where they said well I believe our lives were better in Egypt than it was here we're starving here you know there's there's nothing for us and they started talking about all the good things that happened in Egypt oh yeah you know all the food and all the things but they failed to realize that they were slaves why would anybody want to go back to being a slave right go through the trouble of working do doesn't make any sense but the Devil comes and blinds you sometimes and you know what he he does he takes the main thing out yeah it's good they forgot about the Red Sea they walked on dry land amen do you see where human being goes to they go to always the Cardinal things that's right they were talking about the food when God separated the seed that's never been done before yeah they walked on dry land right but yet they craved the food that's right they crave the food and you know there's always a Joshua and Caleb yesen thank you Jesus for that you know when everybody said well they're too big for us no there's no way there was a Joshua and Caleb that said we are what more than able not because of who we are the truth of a matter is they are giants they are big but our God is bigger we're not going with our powers with what we can do but we're going in the name of the Lord amen amen thank you Lord for Joshua and Caleb and we ask that the Lord will show us that this morning now I want to look a little bit at Ruth so we see that oral left she went back to her old ways she went back to her old Rel Religion she went back to her own uh parents her family but here's the difference in verse 14 but Ruth did what she got a hold of her now I want to ask you a question what makes one say yeah I think I'm just going to go back to that that old way and what makes the other one grab it have you ever thought about that what was it it was nothing else but our Prophet said there's a deep that's right that calls on to the Deep there was something in there that she said there's no way I'm going going back to my old ways maybe I'm I'm imagining Ruth just thinking for a second and she's like there's no way I'm going back to that yeah that's what I grew up with nothing made sense amen I was an outcast in my family everything that they said I didn't agree with and what did she do she grabbed she was desperate yes amen this was her test this was her test one left but one got a hold and she said I'm not leaving anywhere I'm desperate I'm not going back to my family that's not who defines me I know even though carnally there's nothing that you can offer me I'm not letting go amen whatever happens happens you see now verse 15 and she said behold thy sister-in-law is gone back to her people and onto her Gods return Thou after my S thy sisterin-law and this is what she answered and Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go now the way I'm look I'm I'm just trying to imagine in my time she didn't say well you know what whatever you're going to go I'm going to go your people I guess they going to be my people no that doesn't sound like she was desperate right right she got a hold of her she looked her in the eye and she said I'm not going anywhere wherever you're going to go I'm going to go go your God will be my God Amen she was desperate amen the other sister-in-law went to her own Gods but what did she profess your God will be my God right she knew that Naomi had something that connected with what God put inside of her yeah right mhm that little bit made sense to her she didn't leave she said this is what I've been longing for I feel there's something in Naomi that has something to do with me that the Lord put in my heart I'm not letting go she didn't have any promises she didn't know Boaz was going to uh redeem her she didn't know anything but there was something that sparked in her heart and she grabbed and she said I'm not letting go whatever this is this is mine amen your God will be my God amen amen amen now in verse 18 when she saw that she was what steadfastly minded amen this is just when I was reading this it it it it just stuck with me she was steadfastly minded there was no going back for her she had something that she was holding on even though it was very small that very small something she was holding on to right and you know what the Lord did that's my bride amen when nothing makes sense she holds on to something that is very small amen because why God chose her amen God chose her and he placed something in her and now that was coming out it was manifesting amen it was manifesting praise God now I want to jump to verse 22 so Naomi returned and root the mile her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of Moab they came back and they came to Bethlehem in the end of The Barley Harvest is that what it says in the beginning in the beginning amen wouldn't have been a a sad story if they would have arrived at the end of the Harvest amen what is there to offer her everything is done but they came right in time not our time but God's time how many times were we thinking that it's going to be the end how many times were we like Lord I believe this is the time yeah and God says not yet not yet amen you're going to get it wrong not yet this makes us to where we have to trust him amen not my time but his time is perfect amen amen that jumped out at me and I I say thank you God for for showing that to me she arrived right in time at the beginning of the barley Harvest hallelujah thank you Lord for that now in Chapter 2 we see Naomi is talking to uh her daughter-in-law and she tells her and Naomi had a Kingsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of ELC and his name was Boaz and you know the Lord just reveals things at the right time I always thought that it was Naomi that told Ruth to do something to go to Boaz but listen to what the next verse says and Ruth the moabit said unto Naomi Let Me Now go to the field amen and glean ears of corn after him and whose di I shall find Grace amen and she said unto her go my daughter amen she wasn't forced to go right it wasn't Naomi's idea all that Naomi said was there's a redeemer soon as she heard that she grabbed it and she said this is my chance this is good this is my chance there's a redeemer I've heard about him but now I'm going to go meet him right and what did she do she went why because she was desperate her life depended on it they were starving oh if that doesn't remind me of myself then I don't know what reminds me right right nothing made sense right I grew up in a Pentecostal Church a good church but most of the stuff just did not make any sense right and I often said Lord why doesn't not make sense why am I the only one that believes that what's going on I just felt like I didn't belong there but when you get desperate when you get desperate that's God timing amen yeah he comes on the scene and then gives you a little bit more yeah and then he gives you a little bit more amen and then you rejoice in that but you have to get to a point where you're desperate you have to get to a point where you you see Naomi had to die towards her Gods she had to be disconnected from her other husband yeah that's right do you see how God Was preparing her way MH yeah she had to profess with her own mouth that she's not going back to her God yeah right she had to do it that's right yes God couldn't do it for her now God knew what she was going to choose right but the choice was her hers amen she had the choice yeah her sister-in-law chose a different way but she said your God will be my God Amen wherever you're going to go I'm going to go amen that was devotion amen yeah she didn't understand many things maybe she never met Naomi's God but there was something that she said in her heart go for it and you know when she told those words to Naomi I'm thinking that maybe she just stood back a little bit and she she was surprised and she said where did those words come from that's it that doesn't sound like me that's it but there was something in there that was crying amen it was crying to the word of God that's right heyen I'm so thankful for so we see in uh chapter 2 verse two that she goes and what is she hoping for she's hoping that she's going to find Grace in his eyes amen amen oh that's just a beautiful amen beautiful picture there and then I want to jump to verse eight then said Boaz unto Ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not glean in another field neither go from hands but abide here fast by my maidens nine let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go to after them have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art a thirst go onto the vessel and drink of that which the young men have drawn so we see that as soon as Boos see her sees her he's worried for her maybe she looked a little bit withered from starving maybe she looked a little bit tired but she had one purpose to find Grace in his face amen she was desperate yeah and she was hoping to find Grace now verse 10 then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thy eyes that thou th should us take knowledge of me amen seeing that I am a stranger Church who can identify with that verse am I can identify with it amen when he showed himself to me when he showed Grace now Ruth went in hoping that she's going to receive Grace but now she sees it come to fruition I found Grace in his eyes he took me in I was an outcast but I was desperate and what did he do he took me in amen right go drink go eat started feeding her she she was thirsty so he he gave her to drink that's the kind of God that I'm serving that's my God I was out there in the world minding my own business but he took me in he gave me to drink and he fed me amen praise be to God 11 and boad Boaz answered said unto her it had uh it had fully been showed to me all that thou has done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband and how thou Hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy n Nativity and art come unto the people thou which knowest not here therefore amen he appreciated that she left her own ways she died to her old self and she was ready for something new she was ready to go after something that she never knew before but she was chosen amen and she responded to that deep that was in there the Deep calling onto the Deep that's right the Lord recompense thy Work and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings Thou Are come to trust amen amen she came to trust in the Lord yes amen maybe she didn't know it but it was made known to her amen you left everything behind your old ways your old God that didn't make any sense to you and you came under the wings of the Lord amen yes sir amen what a beautiful sight 14 and Boaz said unto her at Meal Time Come Thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel into the in the vinegar and she sat besides the Reapers and he reached her perch corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left so we see that she is eating now she came in at the beginning of the Harvest yeah God sent us a prophet and what did he do he looked at the bride amen a son of man revealing the son of man amen and what did he do started feeding the bride MH and what did she do she heard yeah and something in here said that's me amen amen I'm catching a hold of that this makes sense I was born for this thank you Jesus what a beautiful sight thank you Lord hallelujah amen that's right and when she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young man saying let her glean even among the sheep and reproach her not amen verse 21 and Ruth the moabit said he said unto me also thou shall keep fast by the young men until they have ended all my Harvest amen she was to get everything that the Harvest was to give amen that's right she arrived at the beginning of the Harvest and what was her command stay in the word of God until the end yeah right don't walk away from the word of God I gave you my word amen stay in it amen good don't move from there that's right don't go into a different field stay right here in this word why because this word will make you bright amen that's it that's exactly right this word is going to help you transfer amen nothing else will amen but this word that was revealed to you and to me praise be to God and Naomi said unto Ruth verse 22 her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field 23 so she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to clean onto the end of barley Harvest and of wheat Harvest and dwelt with her mother-in-law so the command was stay yes sir and what did she do walked away she went to another field no she stayed with the word yes am right she loved the word she cherished the word and she fed on it that's right and not only that the command boas told her stay here until the end and what did she do she stayed with the word Until the End Amen amen that's right amen now chapter 3 in the first verse then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee amen what does the Bible say come unto me all you that labor MH heavy laden amen and I exactly amen who gives you the rest he does Amen on my time no no if you would have been after my time I would have came to the end and maybe not even catch anything or maybe just a few yeah but on his time he brings you to the beginning and he helps you stay to the end and then comes the rest that's it amen right she had to labor yes sir the food was given but she still had to go grab it she still had to eat it yeah God gives you his word amen but we have to do our part yes amen we have to get the word we have to eat it right and we become the word amen that's right amen praise be to God now we see that Naomi is giving her is giving Ruth instructions to help her find the rest that she's talking about and uh now Ruth says I'll do it I will do it now in verse eight and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and thir himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and

close with a thought that the Lord revealed to me so you understand the age that we live in now we all heard about the seven Church ages yeah but I noticed a little pattern in there yes sir I'm not going to go into too much detail but the pattern is this to the Church of Ephesus say this to the Church of pergamus say this and then it tells everything that they've done sometimes it says I like this I don't like this but at the end of each Church age yeah there's a little promise that's exactly for those who have ears let them hear yes sir for those who will overcome yeah there's a promise amen yes amen amen now we know that we live in leoda right everybody knows [Music] that luk worm you think you have something there's a church at every corner yeah there's more churches now than

lukewarm [Music] Church what did Jesus do he brought up Mrs Jesus right and what's the promise to him that's right that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my Throne amen Church what a beautiful
