good to be in the house of the lord today amen hallelujah i want to speak to you this morning on our position of strength once again and a title i kind of didn't really know what to title it just so many little thoughts but i want to speak to you from the throne room our house yeah yeah about jumped out of my skin it's like whoa hallelujah hallelujah tell me god's not present with us tell me god does not care amen hallelujah well i tell you we're few in number this morning but the presence of god is here amen and i'm so thankful for that lovely promise he gave us where two or three would be gathered not for fellowship for friendship but gathered in his name amen there's the difference saints we've come today in his name hallelujah hallelujah i want to just take just a moment i had a lovely conversation yes god bless you thank you sister heidi i will expect that every service now amen can we can we say amen to that yeah yeah amen uh brother dwayne sister connie just had a lovely conversation yesterday with brother duane uh just reminiscing the appreciation that i believe we as a whole church have for his ministry that he he come poured his heart out and you know church he gave you not me you one of the greatest compliments that a minister can give to a congregation and that is he had complete liberty no resistance no pushback a spirit of receiving and and claiming and uh uh just uh to to have a brother we see the gift of god in his life and that he is as it were an experience and and uh uh you know uh experienced minister and you know that just to me meant all the more when he said i just had liberty like i i couldn't even express and so while we appreciate his ministry i want to say that i appreciate you being a body of believers that cares about the word that wants the word wants to live the word doesn't want to cherry-pick the word just lord i want the word give me the word i'll i'll do but i also want you to remember brother dwayne and sister connie uh remember them in prayer they have um some situations that are upcoming uh some decisions that uh are to be made and just maybe even the next month or so and um it doesn't just concern them as brother dwayne's sister connie but you know kind of a whole context of people and just lift them up amen and uh brother ivan and i have been dealing with a little situation um and uh just ask you to pray for this unspoken request lord that that the lord would just come and anoint individuals to make the right decision there's decisions to be made and while you might say they don't impact us but my brother and sister i believe it's a true sign of real christians right the prophet of god said that a real christian thinks about himself only no a real christian lives for others i want to be a real christian i want the life of christ to be expressed in us that we have no other thought than to live for others but here again there's no bridle and reigns attached to others and so we just have to sometimes just pray lord you lead them you guide them you direct them and father you anoint them to make the correct decisions and uh so just just asking for prayers concerning uh these situations uh that they would make the correct decisions now brother andrew glover i want to get this out here just basically a couple weeks early brother andrew glover is coming on june the 17th which is friday through june 19th which is sunday so now i know there's some parents that are not here uh and and so we want to share this okay just make sure everyone hears uh june 17th i've i've got to totally confirm this with with uh brother andrew but he's a very pliable uh very led of the spirit and i believe if god's leading me in this direction he would be leading him in that direction i want june 17th friday evening now brother chris sent out a little notification and we always tie grace kids to grace youth so brother chris had said you know due to all these things that are happening we're not going to be able to have a service which for him was the fact that he's going to be gone as soon as he gets home he's going on to minister in other places and um the night of june 17th friday evening i want to have a youth oriented service we're going to ask brother andrew so please parents just act like this is a regular scheduled youth meeting and grace kids and it's here at the church yes and uh so let's just assume it was just a regular scheduled time and um then pray also that the lord would just anoint brother andrew something to benefit our young people our youth and then we'll have a little bit of a treat or finger food or whatever it is that you would feel led to kind of bring and fellowship a little bit after the fact then on june 18th which is saturday uh we will have it six o'clock a saturday evening service and then of course on sunday morning june 19th we will have a regular service and i find this humorous because the question was brought up and it just strikes me in the humorous sense when we say there's a fellowship that is message lingo for food and uh so we will have a fellowship after the sunday service and uh let's not be thinking about the food let's be thinking about the fellowship with our lord jesus christ amen so remember that and share that okay please if someone's not here uh just kind of as you visit and whatever just remember that amen so um let's just stand and go into the word this morning um now i hope that each and every one of you could just kind of reach back into last sunday and uh take a hold of what we are because i'm going to backtrack just a smidge but not much but we're tying this directly i cut off from last sunday because of time's sake i knew it'd be like another hour to to bring this out and um i've just been praying and the lord's been dealing with me to be mindful uh you know my brother and sister i heard it said like this in a little natural thing um that uh i thought would be nice it was i'd rather spend an hour eating good food than all day eating bad so you know lord just dealt with me lord help us to be able to just bring good food this gospel is good food amen so so it isn't the quantity as it is but the quality amen let's turn in our bibles to esther the fifth chapter verses one through three the same verses that we started off last sunday oh and i will also ask you it's just the lord's in control uh but mother nature has not been so kind as it would be in the natural and sister jerry and i have a considerable considerable amount of work to do out of town in mountain home uh if the weather will crop work this next week amen so brother david will no doubt be ministering this coming wednesday again which makes him happy because he has part three i think it is and uh so you know he he told me when i called him and told him my situation he goes oh praise the lord brother paul i i'm already working like on four and five and and so anyway just uh you know take take the word eat the word amen esther the fifth chapter now come to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel now my brother and sister i don't want to preach this out but there's so much hiding here you see there was no royal apparel for you and i to put on until the third day and after the third day we had an apparel to put on that is so beautiful so fine so precious so valuable i say thank you lord thank you lord that after the third day hallelujah see god hides these things in his word my brother and sister because he's god and he changes not and you might say not for the the term some people say well they repeated themselves that's kind of boring but you see god repeated himself to prove to you and i that it's always been the same story god didn't come up with a new story in a new day in another age but it's the same story for every age for every day and for you and i that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king set upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hand now i want you to think about what the scripture says what's in the hand of christ your name you inscribed and he held his hand out to you and i am amen oh how beautiful but just as it was brother jason you just don't even realize this morning the key takes a hand and the scepter's in god's hand but we have to take a holds of that key and claim that in the name of jesus christ we can't just say oh praise god i'm saved everyone says that saints the world says that pool parties beach parties all kinds of party parties that that they're just partying away and saying i'm saved oh if you have a swimming pool in your backyard saints don't mean i mean that kind of thing you know don't misunderstand she obtained favor in his sight and the king held out to easter esther the golden scepter that was in his hand so esther stayed in the courtyard no sir she drew near the word of god says if you'll draw nigh to me let me just paraphrase this if you'll draw nigh to me i will draw nigh to you amen she couldn't stand in the courtyard and say oh king i have a petition she had to come as it were the scepter was an extension of the king's hand she had to come and touch his hand she had to touch him oh hallelujah i could get excited this morning then said the king unto her what will thou queen esther what is thy request and it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom my oh my thank you lord jesus father i know my heart already is rejoiced this morning lord truly as our brother jason made that statement as the song was playing would just skip the service and go right in the rapture oh lord that would be our hearts desire lord how we long to live in your presence lord jesus lord to feel you near us around us in us lord we thank you father for your grace and for your mercy guide us today i pray in the name of jesus christ you may be seated saints now this last sunday we were touching upon uh those things concerning esther and that she had come for such a time as that uh mordecai speaking those words to her and you know my brother and sister as we'll look at that we realize that esther had broken all of the traditions of men the scripture says that it would be by their traditions that men would serve god and esther was called of god to be a tradition breaker and while the world says oh we come to god through the church a prophet in our day come said no this is a personal relationship between you and jesus christ it is not you in the church or you and the prophet or you and a pastor or you and an evangelist it's you and jesus christ and so we're breaking the traditions that have been taught for thousands of years for decades upon decades that the church was the necessary component but my brother and sister we recognize that uh christ in his word amen is going to be magnified to us and the mystery of that is uh then revealed in our day a promise was given that it would be revealed in our day now so many people think this mystery my brother and sister is going to be now if you could just follow my little type here when the prophet of god was there in the cave or at the cave he was there and he's crying out to the lord and the wind blows the pages of his bible and he thinks well yeah the wind did that but it does it again you see there's no chance as it were my brother and sister just a stroke of luck or a stroke of circumstance that causes these things to happen it is god in his word fulfilling his word and so people would come to a position and the mysteries my brother and sister that are in the word of god that the prophet was to reveal in our day was not theological mysteries it was not intellectual mysteries it was christ himself but being the mystery revealed to you and i and so we are here today now some people would say well that's not pertinent that's not for this time that's not relevant my brother and sister we're on the very cusp of time and it takes a bright time a season to come to full maturity and so god's providing the light for the bride to come into maturity and i say thank you lord oh how i say thank you lord amen so as we see esther and preparing and all that happened breaking this tradition that was there we touched upon the fact that uh vashti was a queen who didn't want to be a wife my what a position that represents the very spirit of the age we live in right there saints they want position right seven women claiming one man we don't need nothing from you just your name so all she cared about was the name that she had being a hazardous queen she didn't care about the king even but here comes esther and her heart is i want to be a wife that's my husband the office i've been given happens to have the title of queen but that's not important to me because it's this man here the man christ jesus that's the one that we're in love with it's not a title to go around as it were and crow and say i'm the bride i'm the bride i'm the bride i'm the bride but to be in love with the one who made us the bride amen to the one who opened the word that we could see that we were the bride of this last age that we could see the revelation of the day that it would come in the very very darkest of days we could come and there's a light shining you say brother paul our life is difficult that's fine the word's been opened to you and you know who you are in jesus christ so quit dwelling on the circumstance and dwell on the one that's shining the light for you because you see the circumstance may never go away my so many examples but i want to deter myself this morning i want to just jump forward i don't know if that recapped this last sunday enough for us to step forward but i hope so now here in the church ages brother branham says this the reason that this is part of the eulogy of the spirit is because these brave soldiers now i want to go i want to back up for just a second here in the church age book this would actually have up above this as a caption or a header would be where satan's seat is so it is describing or giving us a a a clear visual picture of where satan's seat is now is anybody in question this morning where satan's seat is it's just right outside the doors of this church it's right over here in the mall and right over here in the theater and out in the park at the lake today this is where satan's seat is he's the god of this evil age and so this is his seat that's out here my brother and sister this is how close god called you to live to satan see now if god called you that close to live that close to satan's seat how much closer did he call you and i to live to his seat to live to his throne not a distant relationship my brother and sister i to just put it in an overall sense if i can walk out this door and bend down and put my hand on this parking lot out here or as it were on a car or whatever it is of the possessions of this life right here and i'm that close to satan see i want you to catch a revelation of how close god wants you to be to his throne to his seat to come into that place that it is so close to us it is us amen now the reason this part of the eulogy of the spirit is because these brave soldiers amen come on brave soldiers are we brave soldiers amen we're not we're not scared we're not full of fear we're not going to run and hide my brother and sister we're brave soldiers of the cross we're overcoming satan right in the midst of his own throne room now imagine this is not even on the outside as it were but now you've been invited so close satan wants to draw you so close he pulled you right into his throne room and you are living there and imagine how it must make the devil feel when you as brave soldiers of the cross are standing can you visualize that right in the midst of his throne room and you are defeating him he cannot take dominion over you he has no authority over you he cannot cause you to follow his whim and his will and you are there as brave soldiers of the cross amen and you're defeating him in the midst of his own throne room look at the world out here my brother and sister satan possessing people and people's behaviors in their life it don't matter if they're rich or they're poor it don't matter if they're smarter if they're just average none of that matters satan's got him in the throne room and he's dominating their lives and then comes along this other little girl called the bride hallelujah and she's walking right through his throne room and he's throwing every fiery dart he's throwing every suggestion every circumstance everything that he could buffet her with every stumbling stone maybe she'll be singing as it was the prophet's vision of those two churches and maybe she'll just be going through this throne ring singing onward christian soldier marching as to wait i am in the middle of a battle anybody in the middle of a battle come on saints we got to just you know don't try and hide that i'm sorry it's just a fact if you're a son or daughter of god you're in the middle of a battle and you go from one battle to another battle to another battle to another battle because you were called to possess the land you weren't called to live on the fringe of the land you weren't called to just catch one little grape from the land you were called to possess that land amen they're winning the battle through the name and the faith of jesus right in the camp of the leaders of darkness what a tremendous commendation i wonder if this kind now don't get me wrong here but i wonder if this kind of a a atmosphere is the kind of atmosphere that's open and receptive to the preaching of the word are you with me i don't think this kind of atmosphere that causes people to fold their arms and say oh wow they're preaching about being saved and having the blood and and having the holy ghost and living holy and righteous get on with it i've heard it before do you know saints those very words have been uttered inside this sanctuary get on with it what were they looking for a tradition a 15-minute tradition a tradition of if you want more people or my family to come you need to just tone it down those words have been spoken under this roof you realize how satan would try to bring the warfare to us but the prophet of god is not talking here about satan bringing the warfare inside our church but he did say that satan goes to church now we're talking to another group of people come on am i speaking to another group of people and they are going to be the people that whether satan came to church or not it doesn't matter because they're right in the midst of satan's throne room and they are living the word of the hour they are the conquerors they're the overcomer the word is talking about and it's right here oh what a tremendous commendation like the mighty men of david who invaded the camp of the enemy to bring david thirst quenching water so these giants of faith invaded the realm of satan's earthly stronghold did you see what the prophet of god said i don't believe these words are by accident people say well you know people help brother branham write this but i'm telling you my brother and sister no doubt paul had those and historically so they'd help him write but that didn't mean that the spirit of god that the holy spirit was not the one controlling what was being written and people want to say well this was done that was lee vale this was this one this person forget that nonsense my god your god is in control they wrote what god wanted wrote not what they wanted wrote and you can see the evidence of that of things that they went on to write later that counter dick this they were under the anointing of the holy spirit here and they were under an earthly anointing there so don't let anybody fool you and say well those aren't brother branham's words he endorsed it amen and by preaching and exhorting brought the water of salvation to those who lived under the shadow of death now as much as these words concerning the throne and the realm of satan are part of god's praise see sometimes my brother and sister god help me i don't want to be a negative preacher but sometimes my brother and sister when god is speaking when he says those i love i chasten do you realize that was a commendation to the bride of christ that was a compliment to the bride because he's telling her if you're mine you're going to receive this correction and i believe your mind so i believe you're going to receive it you know kind of the old phrase he called me a buzzer well take me home show me what you eat come on reminds me of his sister he's come to me one time and says brother paul what does a person do my husband loves sports he gets sports illustrated but did you know once a year they have an addition that's full of half naked well not even half half probably wouldn't even be that bad swimsuit edition what do i do brother paul it's just like laying around on the floor in our house and i said well sister if you throw it away he'll miss it that's the truth of it kind of blunt so when it shows up there's not much you can do about it but what you can do because you get the mail before he comes you know take that little magazine come on saints god god works through you and i we don't have to have some supernatural stroke of lightning come down and i told her i said sister you take that thing and you put it on the counter you set your bible on top of it because the word of god said that we would put our foot or heel to the head of the serpent and you put your bible on top of that and then you say lord let this make my husband's eyes sick and weary and his heart vomit over this filth and you know what happened is he comes home he comes home and it's laying there on the counter and he looks at that and goes you know why don't you just throw that out a one-day answer to prayer because the word not her get this saints she didn't get over there oh what am i gonna do what am i gonna do how do i cure this heterosexual she'd done that for years it never changed a single thing but when she took the word of god and she put it on top of that and said in the name of jesus christ possess that land come on are you with me let's possess that land we don't have to let satan roam through our house we don't have to let satan conquer our domain oh hallelujah amen these giants of faith is a compliment to you invaded the realm of satan's earliest song stronghold preaching exhorting you say but i'm not a preacher yes you are not a one of us here today that's not a preacher amen we'll share the gospel in one form or another [Music] now as much as these words concerning the throne realm of satan are part of god's praise for his elect they actually set the stage for the denouncement of the evil that has gained supremacy in the church i promised i wouldn't be negative today but i'm telling you my brother and sister it's creeping in to the message but praise god could i jump and shout i can't kick my heels i'm afraid i'd fall down look at this my brother and sister i don't care i have focused some in the past and i may in the future again if the lord leads but i it's not about who's doing what's wrong in the message my brother and sister there is a people can someone say it with me there is a people according to the word that will overcome hallelujah so it's no matter what is going on out here and what we call the message there's a people who are going to come and become the denouncement of the evil that is coming to the church i say lord help me to be that announcement lord i don't want to be what a part of the evil that's coming into the message of the hour i want to be that and it won't be because we stand on a chair and say woe unto all you that got these spirits it will be our life it will be our life it will be the atmosphere around us oh i don't need to make that much of it i didn't realize when i was saying that what it was but i'm telling you when a preacher comes and he leaves and says there is such a warm welcoming spirit in your church and it's not just brother dwayne come on my brother and sister i don't know if i should name names or not but there are many that have come in your midst and they have shared with me when they left brother paul there is a warm welcoming spirit in your church and i would like to just bust the buttons yes but it's not me it's the holy ghost in you hallelujah it's not the preacher that makes this a warm welcoming spirit it's a holy ghost in you oh thank you lord amen well people say i don't know i don't want to really be part of the denouncement don't worry about it don't worry about it just live it live it your life your life will send the message hallelujah is it okay to be excited today amen hallelujah see this announcement's taking place right here right now the life in you whatever there is that's happening in the church my brother and sister your testimony your testimony is what we'll denounce we don't have to come out post something on the church site denouncing all of this that and the other just let the word live yes lord let the word live in me oh as that song says amen just let it live in me lord hallelujah now look at this he's talking about in in this quote he's talking about brave soldiers amen my brother and sister it is not as it were that we would come and say well look i i'm brave you know my daddy raised me up with some you know might say different thoughts that he shared one of them as i've shared with you in the past he says son when people tell you that they're humble they're not and me being i say this in all kindness because sister sue is very dear to me through the years has bought me a lot of books of history warfare and over and over the story is repeated the loud and the boisterous are not the brave take it all back through the history of mankind and warfare little scrawny little humble real actually humble in the time of warfare they're the ones that are like i have something to fight for the loud and the boisterous my brother and sister are trying to present an image that they hope they can live up to i just want to live up to it i may not seem like much you might not seem like much but what we want to do is live up to it amen we want to live at that level that god called us amen it'd be nice wouldn't it as it were to walk around in our queenly robes and everyone would give honor to us because we're a queen but my brother and sister how it would be to serve how would be to serve our husband our bridegroom without boasting without telling the world we've done some great deed lord help us amen amen but it's not a thing of the past there's there's brave soldiers sitting right here in this congregation this morning men are the prayer warriors they're the ones that want to help they're the ones that would go do something for someone they're the ones who care about those around them but having said that i can't fix your problems and you can't fix mine so there's only one that we can go to if we need to have our problems fixed amen so it is look my brother and sister this is a time esther coming she came to her king to her husband she didn't necessarily come you know when mordecai or uncle comes and says you know it ain't even going to save you if you keep silent it won't save you you understand why you wouldn't save her because when the king's decree would go forward whatever the king had put his ring and the seal upon it it had to take place so if there was a condemnation as it was in this case of the jews it wouldn't even save the queen wow you imagine what it would been for hazards to realize my wife is jewish but i made the decree and under the law of the medes and persians i i cannot reverse that do you realize haman didn't even know esther was a jew satan doesn't know who the bride of christ is so he's just going to put a death sentence on all humanity trying to get the bride oh think about it it's pretty deep subject we don't have enough time today amen so you look at this and realize now that that this little decree that haman was searching for amen was there and esther when she realized one she knew who she was come on the prophet of god said we'll take a rapture when we know who we are so some of us don't know who we are because we haven't taken a rapture yet amen so we want to come to the place of the knowledge of the word that we would know who we are and the kind of knowing who we are comes with being bold enough to put on our royal garments and to walk into the presence of almighty god and to be able to name our decree our desire our wishes to him and it's there not as beggars not crying not weeping not begging but coming boldly to the throne of god to be able to say you know what i finally caught a revelation i have my husband's here amen he cares about it you go on we'll preach about it so you know but we're going to go on a little bit i just felt anointed this morning early today i was just like i'm done with this and then i got an anointing i was like no there's more to come but my brother and sister you'll come and well i might as well just encourage you to do it you go read nestor and it comes to a time that hazara says to her tell me what to do do you get that revelation come on bride do you get that revelation almighty god says whatever you ask in my name i shall do it i shall give it to you it come a time a hazard says to esther tell me what you want done and we are sitting here as the bride of christ now this is the point the rubber hits the road is that how we're approaching god i think there's more beggars amongst us than esther's but we'll save that just a moment maybe for another service another day i don't know now look at this this little brides only begin to fight for a people i said this to you last sunday i say it again i am your people. and you are my people amen and we are god's people amen there should be no one greater on the earth to fight for than these people amen of who we are hallelujah now look at this uh ii corinthians oh i think i skipped i might have skipped oh let's just go forward brother ivan would go forward i think i had them scriptures turned around maybe yeah second corinthians what we want to go to is there no second corinthians that's all right just turn your bibles real quick you you know the scripture for though we walk ii corinthians 10 3 and 4 though we walk in the flesh we don't war we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal have you ever come on saints just be real today if we ever just felt really frustrated with a brother or sister uh we felt really frustrated with a family we've been really frustrated with the preacher we've been really frustrated with the deacon we've been really frustrated with uh well let's not go on you realize that's not you can say well well it was it was how they did this or what they did here what they did there come on remember this is not flesh this is not flash this is the devil and they're not perfect christ is the perfect one amen so you've got to get rid of that attitude and then come and say but that's my brother and i'll fight for my brother so lord if the preacher's spitting and stumbling and he's kind of losing his train of thought and stumbling around i'm not going to criticize him i'm going to say lord help that man because he's just a man help him lord and when we start doing that we look around see somebody in the church struggling a little bit and we'll get down and say you know i'd like to slap him silly but i'll pray for him instead because whatever's happening in their life is not flesh and blood it's of principalities and powers of darkness and i whoa can we have this kind of confidence i'm going to walk right in the midst of the throne room of satan and i'm going to rebuke satan get your hands off my brother get your hands off my sister get your hands off of our youth get your hands off of this oh but i don't know if i do that you know i'm gonna have a terrible month following you're gonna have a terrible month following regardless of what you do because this is warfare oh the devil might be sitting back you know what he'll do amen he'll set back and he'll watch and say now how are they overcoming well i noticed they've been reading their bible well i'll tell you what i'll do i'll get them some sick children i'll break everything they own i'll make it to when they get up in the morning they put their clothes on and they dash out the door because they got more problems than they can fix so james lovell young man lives in phoenix arizona star football player state of arizona quarterback a lot of experience a lot of victories as a quarterback young man's married a lovely lovely young lady and boom god starts expressing a calling in his life he just preached recently down there in phoenix evening life fellowship and he's bringing it from the avenue of a football player and when you're there and the other team is starting to dominate you they've figured out your game plan you don't just sit there you adjust you change your game plan so that satan cannot block it well i just don't have time to pray okay sorry coach we lost the game i didn't have time to throw a pass i had to run over here and i had to run over there i had to knock this guy down and i had to i just didn't have time to score a touchdown no you're not going to see a football player quarterback do that if they figure out the pass you run they figure out the run you pass it's a very nice service brother brought it out very simply but it's profound i don't have time you don't have time well at the minimum as we're driving all over town put the bible on because said but did you know that when the scripture said to dig into the word of god they weren't talking about mr scoby they were talking about you digging into the word of god well that's the only thing i got time for well fine did you eat today yes read your bible the food natural is secondary change the game plan because we are here my brother and sister to defeat amen this for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of satan's throne room that's what we're doing because you see every day do you ever you know like stretch your back and feel a little pop that might have been the devil with jackhammer trying to put a foundation in your in your life he's there i'm going to go ahead and build a throne room here in this one and that one and if we allow him to my brother and sister he will come and let me reverse this scripture to you the bigger the foundation of the throne room the more we will walk after the flesh if we look out and see ourselves walking after the flesh then there is something wrong the word is not working mightily in us we've given satan time to start building an extension a porch to his throne room in our life can we say amen amen you see this warfare is not going to end till the end that's the truth of it now look at this my brother and sister we're going to have to just call it good here i hope something's been valuable to you this morning but look at this now haman i've got in my notes here quotation mark satan amen haman has already tried to pass judgment see this is how haman come he come into the king and he has got a petition that he's going to lay before the king and he's expecting because he is trusted right amen look at lucifer's position he was trusted he knows how god works and he was just going to have the king just put a petition there before him and the king and his busyness was going to say now what is this oh there's some there's some troublemakers come on i hope you catch this maybe even see a little humor in it hey there's some troublemakers in the kingdom they're the ones that keep upsetting my plans why don't you go ahead and sign this and we'll judge those people and when we judge those people we shall punish those people you know why satan haman could do this because he already knew what the previous laws and decrees he already knew what the old testament was he knew what would be manifested in the new testament and he says oh the man sister darren i was talking about this on the way to church the man that looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery already and the scripture says an adulteress won't enter the kingdom of god so what i'm going to do is i'm going to pray them up and down the streets i hope this is not too personal to whatever i'll pray them up and down the streets i'll put them in front of them everywhere they go they can't even pump gas in their car i'll put them in front of them and then because they're men they're done they're toast but you see god put a special anointing in the bride of christ an anointing that we will stand correction in that beautiful can someone say thank you lord that we can come and say lord i receive the correction forgive me lord but you see satan's trying to pass judgment upon you he's trying to already put you in a place that puts you in the pit with him he can read the word he knows he's going to the pit he's going to take as many with him as he can and so he does that but what he doesn't realize is a special anointing and because he's never felt it come on he's never felt that anointing to receive correction or there would be no lucifer there would be no devil if he'd ever felt that anointing he would have sat there in heaven and said forgive me i tried to i tried to turn these angels against you almighty i i forgive me but she has never felt that anointing he don't know what it is and you realize it's not an anointing in the mind it's a moi anointing in the soul and so he can't intellectually figure that out because intellectualism will not give you an answer in the soul and so while he tries to figure this whole equation out saint he can hear our voice speaking this but because he's never been anointed that seed was never placed in him he cannot repent otherwise when it come up to the edge of the pit in the judgment he'd be saying forgive me and god would be obligated by his own word to forgive him so but he doesn't really know who who this is he didn't know that esther was a jew amen but haman knew if he could get a king's decree it would judge all and my brother and sister here is the king's decree right here and the king has already passed judgment on her on esther this is where haman misses it he doesn't know who she is he doesn't know the connection that is there he doesn't can't figure it out he has no access to the lamb's book of life you have access to the lamb's book of life by the holy ghost amen that god confirming in you i have saved you i have claimed you i have sealed you and satan cannot get in that book he doesn't know who he's dealing with but he looks around and says they're kind of displaying they're kind of displaying yeah they're not coming in flip-flops and baggy shorts and tank tops to church why is it that these people choose to wear royal garments why are they dressing you notice that i hope you don't find this as mockery but you notice that esther didn't come in with a beach towel an umbrella and a cooler and invite the king to the beach hope brother jason i'll tell you about jumped out of my seat i think i maybe didn't make a little bit of noise i was containing myself my brother and sister look at this now she was anointed to go right to the throne and she set the stage for deliverance by her approach to the throne amen she followed that amen now look at this i'll catch that in just a minute for you i want to make this bold statement satan is exposed to the believer amen it is not that we have a mystery of what's going on around us amen esther a type of the bride anointed desperation amen came to the throne room and she met the king in there right now look at this the prophet of god brings to us a vision that some people still have it believing that brother branham must come back to fulfill this uh believing these things must be but in the tent vision brother branham tells he shares this god speaks to him says i'll meet you in there but it'll be a mystery and in that vision they come out and they're asking them what happened in there i don't even know you imagine how weird that must be sister sue you was just in a tent you walked in the door on this side that little room you walked in the door on this side maybe you walked in there but mostly that is in here you walked in there and you walked out free you walked out delivered you walked out healed and they're saying what happened you can't describe it you can't describe it i don't know i was under i was under depression i was under anxieties and oppressions and i was under this stress thought i was gonna blow up thought about taking my own life all these different things and i come out of here and now i have such a liberty what happened i don't know i don't know i can't i can't even tell you saints i can tell you and i don't mean to speak it about me but it's personal to me you know i've shared with you before how i had that growth in my foot and and you know went in there in in in uh meetings there in cloverdale and in new year's the presence of god was so strong brother biscuit got up and said now remember the prophet of god said it was a communion service he said in times like this it's a good time to receive your healing and i remember that's all it took saints nothing boasting of paul but there was an anointing there the words were spoken i decided i believe it i lifted my hands and i said thank you lord for healing me and it was only just a minute or two later this great heat swept up through my foot and up my leg and come out and three days after we arrived home i had no more growth in the bottom of my foot gone that's the god we serve but what satan would want to do is for you to say well that might apply to somebody else how could i ever make that claim because i snapped at my husband i was mean to my wife i did this or i did that no my brother and sister come boldly today come boldly for what the need is don't sit here defeated come and say i am not worthy but i serve one that is worthy and i will serve him hallelujah amen the tent vision i'll i'll meet you in there amen oh my goodness brother jason if i had it to do over again i might just jump out of my chair and go run around this church and freak all of you out because some of you would be freaked out you wouldn't know what to do brother paul's lost it but i'm telling you my brother and sister when brother jason brought that song and right here written in my notes not one word changed from that moment to now but you see as she is there in the presence of the king and he has told her i'll give you anything you want even to the half of my kingdom oh come on saints get this she said i want you to come to my house i want you to come to my house that's where i want to meet you and look at this now he comes to her house and she doesn't just unload on him amen now this is in the day it's in the age it's not our age don't take this home and think this is the way to do it but they're there sharing a glass of wine and a little dis danger dessert and whatever it is and then the king says what is it wife what is it queen esther that you want well i finally got you in my house and i want you to do this and this and this and this and this no sir what did she do it would be pleasing to you king he tells her esther i can just see it play silent i don't believe the emphasis is in the words that displays this to us but he was there going look i've already promised you half the kingdom just tell me what you want up to the half of the kingdom would you come back to my house tomorrow i have a need i have something i want to but it's pretty big and instead of just coming and looking ungrateful and acting ungrateful then i just bombard you the minute you come into my house i i want to just sit here and enjoy this time with you but i would like you to come back tomorrow my brother what'd she do she made her house an extension of the throne room she didn't separate that and say well you know now i'm not speaking ill of my sisters my wife or anyone it's just the way god made men and women i'm not advocating nagging your husband but sometimes men do need a little help get off the couch huh i know which ones have spoken that word so i can see it in your faces and i say that with humor jerry and i've had these towel for the common bath in our house so long i forgot all about them she finally got tired of waiting and took them off the shelf and put them away somewhere and that really got them off my mind but you see the other evening she's like paul would you hang the towel racks in the bathroom and i'm thinking i'm tired i don't want to hang towel racks she spoke the right word saints no supper for you then no no honey it'll only take a minute and i'll help you ah i can do that guess what we have towel racks in the bathroom because it's about approach it's all about the approach and esther didn't come and say now look this thing here and this is there and that no she says look i i had you come but tomorrow night i want you to come to my banqueting table um imagine we could invite him to our house 24 hours a day seven days a week and you know what our banquet table that we can offer him is our praise and our worship don't have to spend hours slaving over a stove and trying to arrange this it reminds me of a sister in chile i don't know what she's went on at one time she was going to make a catering business but this sister went and uh become all this culinary arts i couldn't think of the word she studied culinary arts and we were invited were they related or she just a sister to them she's related to them and we're invited to their house i'm hungry i'm thinking okay i've heard this reputation this sister she's such a good cook she went to school she's got a degree plaque on the wall all this stuff and we got there i'm ready to tear into the food and they're like sit down it's not ready yet he told us to be here at seven o'clock i just kind of thought i'd just come in and slide into a seat and after a little while here come of all things the tomatoes or as they say tomatoes is that right jolene only they all looked like roses and they were beautiful i was like are we supposed to eat these that almost seems bad we're going to eat the decorations and then there was carrots that were cut up into different things and there was different things you know the only thing they didn't make a design out of was a broccoli and that kind of sent a message to me there's nothing beautiful about broccoli but the thing was see we sometimes make this assumption i'll slide into church at the last minute oh let's see monday i got to make the house payment and i got to do this i need to mow the yard and uh feed me right now do i need to go further no sir esther invites him the first time just want you to know how special you are to me and i'd like you to come to my house tomorrow also i want to have a conversation with you again but sometimes the conversations are serious sometimes they're deep sometimes there's fears and anxieties and things attached to the conversation our problem is we come sliding right in husband i need you to do this need to do that no sometimes remember when i joked here in the church about why i was meeting your husband at the door giving him a big old smack instead of tearing into him are you going to mow the lawn tonight are you going to fix the window that won't slide are you going to change oil on the car you can take my car downtown put gas in while you're at it worship no sir walks in the door throw your arms around him give him a big old smack you know that very sunday i find this humorous hope you don't mind just take a moment the very sunday i spoke that to you i went home the wife and i now you know had a friend tell me this you know you're getting old when you get this sunday newspaper so you can look at the obituaries and uh so we get the sunday newspaper and mostly everything else is nonsense but strangely enough there's people my age that are appearing in the newspaper or only it's on the fourth page and that's not good and i flipped the newspaper and right there is a cartoon and here's the husband briefcase walks in the door and the wife runs up there and in the cartoon they've got this great big smack and then she says honey how was your day he's got a silly grin on his face he goes it was good it was good yeah which way do we want to make love to our bridegroom come on saints how are we going to approach him are we going to invite him to the band quitting table and then just pour it all out on him you didn't fish you didn't that i thought you and i thought you said use my healer and you as per my provider why am i broke if you're my provider no love on him and then be bold to say lord i have a provision that only you can take care of amen because look at this remember she invited him to her house but her house was really his house and when you invite christ into your house you're really inviting him into his own house but he's very happy i won't go into that it goes off into another another aspect but um our lord jesus christ speaking of a house amen so what did she do she set a stage for deliverance at her house amen now look at this i want you to catch this parents children she didn't wait until the damage was done she didn't wait until haman had his way amen she started asking god to fix it before the devil had his way amen she wasn't saying well you know i'm just going to sit back i don't want to put too much pressure on my children about you know serving god because we live in a day and i just don't feel like ought to put that go ahead you'll be spending the rest of your life praying for god to fix it if you're not willing to spend the time asking him right now to keep it come on saints come on parents i want you to think about that now is the time to be bold not when they're caught up in the world amen not when they're caught up in all this garbage well you know they're teenagers and they're just expressing themselves yes they're expressing exactly every bit of the content of satan's throne room that's what they're expressing if they're not expressing the things of god they're expressing the things of satan's uh throne room and you know the spirit of indifference comes and kids are like it doesn't matter my mom and dad have a religion they still fight and they still don't have enough money and we still this and we still that that's good parents that's good sit back just give your kids free reign you'll spend the rest of your life praying for their soul come on that's bold i'm sorry but it's the truth amen so she didn't wait for the damage to be done and then ask god to fix it she went to her king amen our king amen before there was any damage done amen and now look at this isaiah 50 will be done in just a minute isaiah 50 i mean 5 isaiah 5 and 20. woe unto them that call evil good and good evil and that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter that is the day we live in we are living in this time right now young people hear me and hear me well we are living in the hour where satan has called good evil and evil good and this world has embraced it satan's throne room has embraced it i just pray that god would would just lay upon your hearts to realize that these things this indifference that satan's putting into lives my brother and sister oh lord i could go on to so many things there now look satan's time is subject to god's time now i'm going to use the story of haman as we close this out for today haman had a timeline we're going to start bringing the stories of what's all wrong and telling the king about these rebellious people in the land never identify them but just these rebellious people and then we're going to get the king to make a decree about these rebellious people and in the fine print on the decree we're going to name them but the king's not going to read this whole big long document he's going to say tell me what's in it this is what's in it okay yeah no we got to deal with the rebels sign it now remember the kings wore a ring that had they called it a signet it was like the seal and they would roll that on that document now i want you to keep that in mind maybe for another sunday amen but i want you to keep in mind for the day there's a reason following as it were in this line god had a scroll of seven documents and each one was sealed think about it for another sunday we won't go that far see so satan's time is subject to god's time and satan haman here had a schedule worked out he had a time he was going to present this and then all of a sudden before he can present his side of it here is now esther coming and saying i need a petition now haman misinterpreting what was happening thinking that esther liked him amen goes home tells his family wow guys i'm the only one in the whole palace that's been invited to ever set down as it were you know because they ate their deal on the on a mattress you might say on a cushion on the floor different cultures still do that and and it's like well i'm the only ones ever invited down to to be with the king and with her in this time it's a time of great glory and in fact because i've been elevated to this position right did not satan say i would be raised up above oh how glorious is going to be he had his timeline god said here let me just read it to you i've got to hurry along amen matthew 24 22 except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened god looked out and said that's my chosen people haman's trying to destroy i'm not making a doctrine out of this don't misunderstand me but god said no no no here is haman's timeline and i'm going to shorten the days i'm going to shorten this timeline and i'm going to come and i'm going to do a mighty work a deliverance before satan's timeline i'm going to shorten these days my brother and sister people was asking the prophet of god you go on the internet feel free to do that when people think the rapture will be oh no no no the bride of this last age the redeemed of this day they go through the tribulation and they go through all of these things no it don't fit the type my brother and sister now god is going to shorten the days amen for the elect's sake is there any elect here this morning amen god is going to cut this short of satan's plan for you amen for the true church of god he's got his plan and god says you know what right before all hell breaks loose on this earth i am going to his tummy and i'm going to shorten the days for my bride and i'm going to take her right out of here but it didn't change the scripture now all of that must be fulfilled and so here it is now that haman has his plan and god anoints her that day he anointed her saints to get up and put on the royal garment why that day because i already spoke to you there's no power for the bride for the believer until after the resurrection the third day amen when that life come to life that gave us authority of the word of god to take that amen no wonder satan tries to mess with things look my brother and sister when the time's messed up it's not god messing up the time it's us hallelujah so look at this now amen so unless the time be shortened there'd be no flesh saved so this is a god-given decree right right here in the scripture amen now use i'm going to hurry along here use the decree which is the word to defend yourself i'm jumping ahead setting a stage for maybe another another time here use the word what was the final deal when this all come out amen haman the devil was arrested he was subdued he was bound in that moment in that season he was bound and it's there in that realm right there the final decree that went forth was that it was now mordecai it's a bigger story i just hit a couple of them mordecai now elevated in the position that that um haman had and the very ring that haman used to have that he used to mark this as the official business of the king is now given to mordecai and now kind of give away maybe a future he says to esther what should i do what should i do and with the advice of mordecai and esther together no doubt the king being a part of all of this will send forth a decree we cannot reach every corner and stop every person that was part of haman's conspiracy are you with me amen but we'll send a decree that everyone has a right to defend himself oh hallelujah hallelujah and i don't want to carry this out too long will you come sister emmy amen and heidi amen look at this my brother and sister the decree was to defend yourself and your family in your house or in the field or on the roadway wherever you might be you have been given this given this right to defend yourself and encourage to defend yourself amen i tell you my brother and sister it's come right down it's time as i spoke to you the warfare of the day that we live in it's time for us to stand up and say that's my baby girl that was given to me as a gift of god that's my baby boy that was given to me as a gift of god that was a husband that was given to me as a gift of god as a wife that was given to me as a gift of god that's my brother in christ that's my sister in christ and i have a decree now from the very word of god that i can stand up and defend them wherever i meet the devil he comes to my house i have a right to defend myself i meet him in the market i have a right to defend myself i meet him wherever i have a right to defend myself i have a royal decree oh and i want to go into this in future time with the lord will and then the king took the signet the ring that was on his own hand and he sealed he put it in an envelope are you with me rolled up the scroll amen the seven seals rolled up in a scroll and that wasn't one giant seal on the seventh seal it was seven individual seals because each one was a letter to the people for a time for a place for a purpose but the thing is the king now comes and the decree is placed in the envelope and the king then takes his signature and he seals it but you know what i kind of got ahead of myself well inside that envelope was a king's decree you can defend yourself you can come right down in laodicea and i have given you a god-given right to defend yourself your family your brother and sister your church family i've given it to you oh my brother and sister that decree across the land and the people rose up on that day to shorten the story and they fought for what had been given them oh hallelujah the bible even goes as far as to say that many people became jews now i don't know if you don't have jewish blood in you how you become a jew but i don't believe it was there to be fussed over i believe it's there to show us that you fighting for your family and standing for the word of god will cause others to come and want to be a part of this same family cause others to say you know what there's something different about them amen they're standing right in the midst of satan's throne room and while i see them buffeted [Music] let me just put it this way have you seen paul make a mistake come on don't be ashamed nod your heads it's true but you're still fighting for me aren't you you still pray for me once in a while don't you and the vice versa you see my brother and sister isn't about what we are it's what we stand under and we have a decree i said rise up use whatever is necessary to defend yourself now look we'll close with this right here for today i'm taking a little more time than i intended i'm sorry what a perfect type it is of christ the antitype a male a lamb and he was tested for three and a half years of his ministry through critics and everything the clergy of that day but was proved to hold fast to the father's word even in the presence of haman i mean satan he said it is written it is written constantly he defeated the enemy on the word a perfect example for us today always defeat the enemy with the word of god that's written for the day i want to ask you do we have a word for our day oh hallelujah hallelujah can we just stand up and worship the lord a little bit i apologize i i didn't mean to take it so far hallelujah amen hallelujah come holy spirit let's just just worship the lord today let's just invite him to come back right here today in our presence and speak to our hearts and you know my brother and sister sometimes people get ideas satan puts these ideas that it'd be like well you know they're chasing that means that you know the preacher is going to beat us the preacher is going to condemn us i pray you never feel that or have that attitude here what i want is the holy ghost to come down you might be at home you might be at work you might wake up in the middle of the night and then that would be the moment that god would choose to speak to you and you would sit there i'm not trying to make any point saints but in the last few months hear god it's been chasing and paul a lot [Music] oh no i'm not robbing banks or i'm not doing anything that you guys would all just go in shock over you might say he's made me go through the closet of my life i'm in the attic of my life i'm in the garage of my life [Music] and god says you shouldn't have this here paul this shouldn't be a part of your life yes lord yes lord to the best of my ability saints i have just been saying okay lord done with this things i i don't even like i said they're not evil i wouldn't be ashamed you'd look at that and go oh i wonder why brother paul would have this or that or whatever one of them would be a pile of motorcycle magazines that i have saved for 20 years because they had cool pictures in them of the guy you know doing this or doing that on the motorcycle and and god was like are you really this is what the lord spoke to me are you really believing in that [Music] yeah one time lord it was my god one time i worshipped at that altar if you own a motorcycle that's fine i'm not talking about that i'm talking at a higher level where you elevate this and i thought lord i want to be submitted to you not to the spirits of the age i remember what it was like i remember what it was like saints i used to be very good at riding a dirt bike and i looked at that and i even you know my wife always said it was the lord punishing me for lying to her when i when i destroyed my knee but you see i had lied to her and i had lied to her and i had lied to her and i'm working and i used to justify to myself to ride a dirt bike fast in the desert his work [Music] and just as god used it to wean me from that when i grabbed this big pile of all these different editions of these magazines and i took them out and i dropped them in the trash it's like okay the final little tale of the trail of the serpent just got cut off now don't think i went back to the serpent if you hear i bought a motorcycle but it will never ever again if i ever did it would never dominate my life it wouldn't be the control of my life i wouldn't be tempted to find an excuse to skip church to ride the bike and god's doing that i just use that as a little example other little things books mystery combat spy movie type books and it's there and the lord saying do you really need that in your house now expand house here it was a really good book saints except for the one part that was a little bit the lord's saying really you're gonna justify having this garbage in your house no lord i'm not i'll i'll donate him so somebody else can have the devil in their house no i went out to a garbage can to plunk they're under probably 30 or 40 foot of trash out at picklebee landfill come on i'm sharing this with you just let go and let go come on saints we're in the final run we're in the cleansing season we're in the time the prophet of god said god comes down with the magnifying glass in our life gross things my brother and sister the little things were coming down to the little things lord help us lord help us i can only i want to just share this and then we're done you imagine esther slept in late on the second banquet day slept in late oh my run in the kitchen grab some grab some grapes grab some cheese [Music] that all satisfy him no sir not the bride i know not the esther i know she said i want my prayers to come up before him as a sweetheart i've got everything prepared i can see her hovering over everything maybe she had help we all have help in the flesh those that pray and encourage strengthen us amen why because it had to be as it were perfect for her king [Music] at that point in time i don't think she cared about haman's opinion imagine i just want to impress haman right before they hang him [Music] now i'm not here to impress the devil my brother and sister that little man i'm closing i promise i'm done but look at that when it comes to that season to that time they're going to be looking the scripture says that that little man in the pit and they're going to say this is the man who deceived the nations and they'll realize it was that little man that deceived them a haman sneaking in the background saints go to the throne your petition and then let god do the work let god deliver you from your circumstance the needs that you have hallelujah
