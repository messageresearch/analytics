prayer and isaac's asked to remember francisco alvarado in prayer he continues to battle cancer is having a tough fight lift him before the lord brother david why don't you come brother take these knees to our [Music] god lord you this morning i had something on my heart that little portion of a quote if it's all right i said lord if you want me to bring this you haven't called me [Music] and i just i thought well lord it's all in your hands it's taken out of the unveiling of god paragraph 21 he said may the lord had his blessings to the reading of his word he just read the scriptures now my subject this morning i trust that god will reveal this how many thankful for revelation i cannot be thankful enough for the revelation of the word given by his grace to us and each time i trust that god will reveal this and each time if you take the tapes and listen and hope and trust that you have had a spiritual understanding of what god has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out yes see it's a thing sometime we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down it might bring some to go out some to leave some to ponder over but that's done purposely it must be done that way [Music] then it might be that some would say you mean god would purposely do a thing like that he certainly did he does yet i'm moving on down you read between you read afterwards i like to read the whole quotes for several here but he said a little further down he said you can't explain faith it's something that you believe and it's so solid that there's nothing else will take its place hallelujah thank the lord amen let's bow our heads for a word of prayer our heavenly father we bow reverently in your presence thanking you once again for divine revelation for you said my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow because they cannot hear the voice of strangers lord it's all you're working lord it's all you're doing lord we're thankful that you've had mercy upon us that you chose us in yourself before the foundation of the world lord it's all you're working this day we're expecting to receive from you this morning we're expecting you to take the vocal cords of your servant and bring forth what thou hast ordained to bring forth and we are open and hungry to receive from you [Music] lord we thank you for the word of life the message of this hour that within it lord we sent a word that it might mature your bride preparing her heart preparing her life in the righteousness of yourself to rapture to a body change lord jesus we are anticipating to receive that portion this morning that is fit for your people your bride your elect now father remember these requests these ones with cancer ones that are suffering this sister that found her son dead lord different ones lord these needs are needs they've been expressed before your church now in the name of jesus christ we impart your grace and mercy to every one of these and may they be ministered to according to thy divine purpose and according to thy word whether it's healing peace deliverance whatever it may be father we're thankful that you hear this request and now we believe we receive it bless your word lord i pray let us go out of here expecting to leave here not the same but raised to a higher plane in thee for lord we're marching forward we've heard the voice we've received and heard the trumpet call lord to march on go forward not turning back going forward lord we go forward in to that body change for your glory and your honor through a message that you've given by your mercy reveal it lord we ask you for revelation and we do this for thy glory bless the offering as it's taken may lord it go to the intended purpose and service that you've intended for it in thy name the lord jesus christ we pray [Music] amen praise the lord well as you can see we're going to have a special day today cesar vica is going to be getting baptized so we're looking forward to that and yesterday i was singing yesterday morning we will see miracles so i've asked sister jerry if she'd come and sing that song again and it was a blessing [Music] you said that when we

down every wall he is our peace he is our peace who has broken down every wall he is our peace he is our peace [Music] so cast all your cares on him for he cares for you he is our peace he is our peace oh cast all your cares on him for he cares for you he is our peace he is cast all your cares so cast all your cares on him for he cares for you he is our peace he is our peace cast all your cares on him for he cares for you he is our peace he is our peace glad you have somewhere to cast your cares amen you know if we didn't have a place to let off the pressure you know you look out in the world and you see people they hardly even acknowledge god and the very nature that they have they just simply take the cares of their life and cast them over their shoulder and go on part of that you say man they're fortunate but you see part of it is they don't realize they have an accountant coming and we as believers you know the whole terminology they have in the world today these people are woken well i'll tell you isn't it amazing how satan comes and he impersonates that because there's no greater awakening than a man or woman being awoken to the fact they're sons and daughters of god and so satan come along and grab that terminology and placed it on a thought where people feel like oh yes we're so culturally or whatever it might be uh woken but i'm telling you my brother and sister there's no awakening that they can have unless it's in jesus christ that can even come close to what god has done for you and i amen it's just such a beautiful beautiful thing and you know this morning i'm very happy in my heart um celebrating um our sister vika our hearts desire to be baptized to just make that commitment lord i'm gonna serve you you know that's it's just such a lovely lovely thing amen so we're happy looking forward to that here in a little while i have an announcement i want to share with you church um i won't go into all the details but just a conversation we were having with brother george smith a few days ago and the result of that is on oh i forgot to write the dates down my goodness for paul that's like a disaster very february 6 thank you that's why god gives us good wives february 6th is a saturday 7 p.m we are going to have questions and answers brother george is going to host that that means here in the flesh so then uh you can turn your questions in so we're not going to do kind of a random hit miss thing uh turn your questions in you can put your name on them brother george says you want to put your name and be identified with your question no problem if you don't no problem so if you have questions thing you'd like brother george to discuss and i asked him brother george what is on the table and he says brother paul if there's a question then i don't want to answer i'll just simply look at them and say i'm not answering this so you know uh you know one time uh i think brother george if i remember correctly had somebody you know asked some some question concerning him and sister rebecca that was like very personal and he's like um i'm not answering that for you or anyone else so uh but let's let's do that so please um that gives us uh one day shy of two weeks right so please turn in your questions uh beforehand and uh we're looking forward to a lovely time with with brother george to come a lot of insight i actually mentioned something to brother george of something of a recent conversation and it's interesting saints because those people who were there brother george being a part of that household sitting at the table riding in the car hearing conversations being parts of conversation and i mentioned this a little thought to brother george and he says brother paul that's not the way everyone takes it he took me back in history as it were laid the whole foundation of what was happening carried it right on through give me a whole different perspective of of what we're looking at so it's nice and and it's always good i'm happy myself to be able to count brother george as a friend so uh be praying for this services and uh so saturday evening february 6 7 p.m questions and answers so please turn them in and then we'll have a regular sunday service and then brother george will be unfortunately not able to stay very long to be going home so amen let's uh just uh stand and go into the word i want to speak to you once again on the overall thought of redemption's manifestation uh i want to talk to you this will be a multi-part uh uh part here uh the tale of two queens uh is not something that we can preach in one service and do it justice uh so what we're going to do is come and and uh it would be very familiar to you uh we just want to touch but you see my brother and sister in studying uh the message uh you you you always have a foundation of scripture you study the message you realize that when they say history repeats itself that is a true statement because we get to see now by god's grace brother david said revelation allows us to look in the word and realize the very spirits that were moving at a certain time and place have come back on the scene again and that is good because the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost and he's falling here with us in our pentecost amen and we see the power of god moving stirring people amen answering questions prophet of god said if there's a biblical question there is a biblical answer amen so we don't have to assume and we don't have to to give up we can just wait upon the lord let's turn in the book of esther and like i said this will be very familiar speaking of vashti and um you know i want you to remember now in our in our graph that we have or the basis we're looking at near never never never not nearly as exciting to talk about the negative side of it it is talk about the bride of christ right to talk about revelation in the opening of the word overcoming power rapturing faith all of these things my brother and sister are are the very uh cream you might say to a son or daughter of god but yet we always want to lay a good solid foundation and um you know sometimes we we realize little things may be lacking uh and uh the foundation points that we need to make and god help us that we build a complete foundation under the word not just our pet topics and so let's just start here now the first ten verses are laying the foundation here of of what is coming to pass uh uh and how this come to pass that vashti would find herself in this position we'll start with verse 11. to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very roth and his anger burned in him then the king said to the wise men which knew the times interesting insertion in this scripture they knew the times for so was the king's manner towards all that new law and judgment and the next unto him now i'm going to just totally slaughter these words i i even looked at some of them and their pronunciation and and three minutes later i couldn't articulate it and next to him was karcencha the seven princes of persia and media which saw the king's face which sat the first in the kingdom what shall we do into the queen vashti according to the law because she hath not performed the commandment of the king a hazardous by the chamberlains mimikin answered before the king and the princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only now saints i'm going to ask you today you got to look beyond the surface of this story she's not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king hazarus for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women now let's not forget sisters the representation of the church as a woman yes sir for the deed of this queen shall come abroad into all women so that they shall despise their husband in their eyes when it shall be reported the king hazardous commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came not likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day until all the king's princes which have heard the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath if it please the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes and that it not be altered that vasti come no more before the king a hazardous and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she and when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire for it is great and truly it is great all the wives shall give their husbands honor both to great and small and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the king did according to the word of mimikan for he sent letters into all the king's provinces and to every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language and every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people amen the word of god says that this bible this word which is the written words of god must go to every nation kindred and tongue heavenly father we ask you today lord just help me articulate these thoughts lord that i been studying and trying to understand lord to have a correct view of a correct vision of we ask father that you would just move in our midst today guide us lord let us speak only according to thy word in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated so as we would look at this story my brother and sister i just felt a great connection as it were and reached out to me that we would be looking in not those days so long ago but we would be looking into the season that we live in now and how that we would uh be able to take and and grasp the spirits amen as it is you know we recognize that spirits come and go as it were but they don't die so you'll see a spirit in an age but it'll appear once again and if we remember my brother and sister at this time that we are living in is the evidence of the pale horse rider which was a mixture of all of those deceptive spirits of the ages that had come into our time and and they're all mixed together and it's not darkness it's not absolute evil that on its appearance it's not good it's just this mixture and people then because of the spirits of the age are comfortable because the scripture says that they would have the very appearance of godliness but they would so deny the power so appearances are good in the business world i like to read and i like to do that and they tell you that you have just a small fleeting opportunity to impress someone your appearance and how you present yourself how you articulate yourself gives you just a moment to leave the impression with that person but my brother and sister impressions are not nearly as important as the character behind the individual a nice suit an articulate language a polite behavior all of these things can leave an image but it does not necessarily mean that the person is what that image represents and so as we look at this i want to just go through here kind of uh steady as we would go today i still want to come back to verse 13 and we recognize the king said to the wise men which knew the times my brother and sister i tell you it is a wise man or woman in the day that we live in that knows the times that we are living in amen if we miss the sign of the time then we can look my brother and sister at the word of god we can read it as a historical factor we can take all of these things but when by revelation we recognize that it is here and i'm going to just throw this little nugget out because it will come in the next service or two concerning uh the tale of two queens but you see esther comes in this same season in the same circumstances of of a life and uh she is reminded by mordecai that it is for a time such as this and i want to remind you as the bride of christ that it is for a time such as this that you are come amen god wanted you in another age that's where you would have been but it is in this day this age these circumstances these temptations and this overcoming power of the holy ghost that is a season god chose for you and i amen we should not stop and say well i hope or i would try to i'll try to be the overcomer i'll no no declare what god thought of you declare what god's plan was for you i am the overcomer i am the one chosen for this day and that reminds me we did not lift them up brother chris and sister christian and the family off spending a few short days together in a little holiday i want to remember them in prayer amen so you look at this and realize that it's a wise man that knows the times and so we see how this action took place we see what what is coming and and how that there is a reaction to this action now i can assure you my brother and sister that avashti response was not something that just popped up it was not some sudden act of rebellion but it is something that had started to raise up into her now look at vashti herself she had been raised to the very pinnacle amen now the pinnacle for her was queen amen and she had been raised to the very pinnacle she's the queen of the kingdom she's got every benefit and every blessing of her position now i just want to remind you not to go into this but it's just come upon my mind to remind you that the prophet of god says that you and i are living below come on queen amen let's accept all that god has given to us in our position amen we should possess all that is in there now look at this see she had every benefit and every blessing of her position she had authority my brother and sister to call and to send and desire something no doubt the finest of clothes and whatever might have been uh that she would have desired the finest of food and to elevate her friends as it were around her but the problem vashti had was she forgot how she got there vashti did not become the queen upon her own merit she had become the queen upon the king's favor and when she come to the place that she no longer cared about the quality and merit of the king's favor she felt that she had rose up to a place that she in herself was self-sufficient now i want you to understand and we'll hit on this in in in future services here but my brother and sister the prophet of god in through the seals you'll find it in the seals you will find it in the church ages you'll find where god is dealing with the fact that there is on the earth today one who calls herself queen she's vocal about this she says that she is the queen of heaven but then the prophet of god comes and this is actually what brought me into this story of the tale of two queens is there is one there my brother and sister that is vocal she has told the world of her delicacies of the things that she's partaking in but she forgot how she got there and so now she believes she is self-sufficient she believes that she has the authority and she has the position to do anything she pleases but we see now that vashti forgetting how she got there she forgot who had placed her in that position and i've spoken on this in the church and no doubt will again at some point in time but we must remember my brother and sister the difference of these relationships is so obvious or so apparent it was that vashti didn't even want to come when called but we will look at the life of esther and when esther saw a need when esther saw something she desired she went what a difference one had to be called and one had a desire to come to the presence amen what a difference my brother and sister that makes and people can say well we are christians and if god wants something from me then you know he can let me know i've heard people make statements like that but i'll tell you i believe this bride of christ in this last age is there saying you know what my lord my king what can i do for you how can i serve you what can what can i do that would bring pleasure to you she's not there living by a book of rules that says on this day this time this place this way i have to do something but she has a heart's desire to want to be in the presence of that king and if i'm not careful i'll preach myself uh too far ahead here uh meaning as in next week or week after so you see by the reason of her position she was brought up into this position where she was as it were the first lady of the nation and it's there that i find interesting and i want to throw out to you that it is because she was beautiful now we'll see actually a metamorphosis or transition in this story of the nature of the whole picture but you see the king says i want to show you guys how beautiful my wife is lest it would trouble some of you i won't go into a great extent of my imagination of the beauty of vashti she must have had hair that was not comparable anywhere in the kingdom she must have had those looks go study it brother branham even sometimes makes some pretty bold statements a fine figure of a woman amen i'll just leave it at that but here's vashti satisfying no doubt every imagination of what one might say is a beautiful woman but you notice not just hearing these verses but going all through that not one mention of her character not one mention of her being called unless becoming atomic fodder is a calling not one mention of her calling not me one mention of what she was actually doing for the kingdom except for sowing the seeds of rebellion that would be the legacy of vashti would be that she was sowing the seeds of rebellion now let's just have our little tea party everyone and the chamberlain comes and says the king has called for you to come you can't tell me there's not influence when she in front of them said leave i'm not coming let me type that to you today in the moving of the holy spirit the holy spirit coming down in our presence coming in our church services coming in our lives however it might come and we refuse to respond you see how that seed of rebellion can come in and and you know it would be in reading and studying here coming across some lovely quotes and you know brother branham ties one of those to how in the wooing how satan coming and wooing this bride of christ he come in there and he wooed her with lovers and then brother branham types those lovers right into the trinity you see he wooed them into that and then they won't move from that even though the scripture is right in front of them and to realize that acts 2 38 is the fulfillment of the book of matthew 28 19 is not a standalone my brother and sister acts 2 38 is the fulfillment or the explanation of that and it comes down but they won't move they've been wooed to that and they refuse to move from that and so then they have to cut god up in three pieces and they've got to convolute him and yet history if you'll study these things out and we'll touch on them in a future service because brother branham ties this together but you'll see my brother and sister what we call mariology today which is where they have lifted up and worship mary as the queen of heaven my brother and sister it is actually a demonic spirit that was taken from sun gods and moon gods and all of these things and then they said we got to get this somehow into modern day christianity so they just change names but they don't change the spirit amen so i can tell you that let me just flip this over to you amen we don't use the same name we don't have a vashti in the church but we have vastly spirit and so you just change the names but the spirit remains the same and so then we move on and we call that religion but you see when one comes to a place where there is you might say authority when there is influence the prophet of god i read the quote to you the other day i do believe the prophet of god says whenever we come into a place to be an influence for god we must humble ourselves daily that we would not be lifted up and not forget the reason of our position not forget how it is that we got here how it is that our sin and past life is behind us to come and just be religious people amen you see as i said before nothing's mentioned of her character only her beauty now there is a quotation that says time takes away beauty but it reveals character that's why i believe somebody i know a sister that had an apron that used to say don't marry or something for beauty how does that go sister jerry remember sister linda had that hey man don't marry for looks marry for cooking because looks don't last but cooking does something of that nature amen i think i slaughtered that but you know time will take the beauty away the handsome man i can give you quotations where brother branham's talking about i'll come in here and here's a a young man and uh here he is straight and tall and and strong and you know uh just hair and here's a a young sister in the beauty of life and she's standing there so so straight and so beautiful and you come back in a few years and the man is uh graying and and stooped over and the sister there is gray-haired and stooped over from carrying these two or three babies and so you just see the natural culmination of life brings about this transition in our lives amen and it don't matter we can't circumvent it you can go through life and eat the healthiest of of everything that you can eat and uh you know do everything you want and you'll wake up one day there'll be a gray hair there amen and then you'll wake up another day and that gray hair left amen so you know we have to be careful about how we place ourselves and how we do that and we should not forget how we get here amen i've got to this position now in romans my brother and sister the romans the the 12th uh chapter um we would come here and take these words for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith oh i'll tell you my brother and sister i might not have the faith that you have been given but i want you to know i want to do everything i can to live to the utmost of the faith that god has given me it is not me comparing to you you carry comparing to me but you and i looking at what god has given us and saying lord i want to fulfill all that you have called me to be if you have called me bring forth thirtyfold lord then lord i wanna bring forth thirtyfold you called me to fiftyfold i wanna bring forth fiftyfold if you have called me to a hundred praise god i wanna bring forth a hundredfold i want to be what you wanted me to be not comparing to another because you see the measure of faith dealt to one might be more or it might be less than what was dealt to you amen now i'm going to just take this in this aspect to drive this point home if we start comparing ourself well i'm as spiritual as brother so and so i'm as faithful i read my bible i pray i feel anointed to the spirit just as much as he does praise lord i'm doing good what if he's only been given a measure of faith to bring 50 fold but god called you for a hundredfold you're self-limiting yourself but let me also turn it around you've been given measure for 50 fold and you compare your life to a hundredfold and you always are disappointed you're always struggling you're always depressed that you're not the kind of man that that one is why can't i be what he is if god dealt him a greater measure of faith my brother and sister you cannot be that person but god's not saying well i'm sorry i turned you out because you weren't what this person was the only measure we have is to go to the will of god the measure of faith dealt to us what the word said about us and take a holds of that my brother and sister and live it to the extreme and when i say the extreme i mean if there is 50 fold there you live it to 50 fifty-fold push until the limit not waiting for some other measure but living to the measure of faith that was dealt to you you see the problem we have sometimes we touched this on the touched on this the other day if we're not careful we get to feeling quite well of ourselves we quite honestly tell ourselves that we are more than we are kind of reminds me years ago and i say this in light not judging the young man but we had a young man that come and we had some work on the farm that needed done and this young man says yes i know how to drive a tractor and we said okay you're going to have these five people we have this bean field that has to be rogued it had two different kinds of beans in it the one kind of bean was scattered randomly some kind of a cross somewhere along the line and we said you're going to drive the tractor and these guys are going to go and pull the plants that need to be taken out and they'll throw them on this deal mounted on the back of the tractor and you'll drive to the end you have the ease of driving up and down the row uh while they're pulling out the the off type beans but you have the labor of getting to the end and you have to shovel it all off by yourself so the trade-off hope you follow this young man okay we can do that we can do that he gets on the tractor grabs a hold of the shifter and we're like he doesn't know what a clutch is have you ever drove a tractor before yes yes what kind well i admit i drove a tractor that you just pushed the little pedal forward and it drove you see it's human nature to raise ourselves up into a higher place than we really are i think that's a lot about how the rich ruler ended up where he was at is he actually had accounted more to himself you see king hazardous recognize the effect that rebellion would have on his kingdom my brother and sister the prophet of god in preaching you can follow this continuity if you're aware of it all through his sermons you see what brother branham was doing as he was dealing with the denominations in the early times he was trying to get them just to be aware of how the seed of discrepancy had come into the church he wasn't accusing them of being the seed of discrepancy he wasn't accusing them of being anointed with an antichrist spirit he wanted them to be aware but the season for being aware and the season for action my brother and sister are interconnected if you are aware there comes a time that you must act upon that you can't sit back and say praise the lord if i do this i will make a rapture and then just talk about it there has to be an action take place and king of hazards recognizes the effect that this spirit of rebellion would have on his search and he said if this is continued in our church it's going to produce a church that puts christ on the outside amen wanting to get in but not in and the people talking about him talking about what he can do what he has done and what he will do in the future but wouldn't even let him inside to do the work see that spirit of rebellion comes in such a fashion that's why brother branham said that a religious spirit is the most dangerous of all the spirits because it's the one that talks about god glorifies god but won't serve him and when we talk about serving my brother and sister anything short of a hundred percent is not true service have you ever been in a restaurant i'll tell you i i got to experience something it was a little bit daunting in one sense but i accepted the challenge and when we were in phoenix uh brother ron peterson he said brother paul tomorrow morning uh the old brothers meet for breakfast over here at this place you want to come and i was like i'm not an old brother but i wanted breakfast so i i went and we go out there and my brother and sister i want to drive this point to you what service is now this is a two-edged sword when we talk about it in the natural so here's this fairly long table full of brothers i was by far the youngest there just to you know but this whole table full of old brothers and and the young lady comes and obviously she knew all of these guys call them by name and whatnot and ask them if they wanted their regular their coffee their regular way did they want their orange juice with a touch of sprite do you want this do you want that and she obviously knew that and this young lady you you just hardly would think about something and she she would have it right there and then she went to take orders and um some of the brothers are like i'm going to eat something different today and then they went right back to their conversation and finally she comes back to them do you know what you want oh i haven't even looked at the menu and this young lady just patiently stood there she never expressed one bit of attitude one brother apologizes saints i want you to catch this and she looked at him and says my job is to serve you oh that we could talk to our lord jesus like that that we could bring from our heart lord my job what i was called on this earth to do lord is not have an attitude but my job is to serve you anyway lovely young lady we're all done i hope you see the humor of this i decided in the natural i saw a reason why she's so happy to wait on these and practically every one of those brothers got up they ordered a ten dollar breakfast and gave her a twenty dollar tip and when they walked out of there she's like see you guys next monday come back but my brother and sister if i if you could catch the point i'm trying to make see she recognized she didn't have an assurance that the tip would be what it was but she had an attitude or or a expression of i'm gonna serve you first and see what the reward will be afterward oh i tell you my brother and sister we as sons and daughters of god we need to not question what the reward is going to be we need to not focus oh lord if i serve you do i get to have eternal life we need to serve him from the depths of our heart because there's a desire as the bride of christ to serve him oh hallelujah if i serve my husband will he give me nice clothes and nice this and nice that no my brother and sister love your husband amen do all that you can serve your husband amen and if he doesn't respond like you think the prophet of god said grab him by the shirt front and tell him if he doesn't change no he said pray that's what changes things now look at this i'll get sidetracked start preaching to our sisters now you sisters start serving better wait you already served better than we serve you so anyway we'll go on i didn't say that did i see he recognized the effect that rebellion would have on his kingdom and we see perfectly my brother and sister i hope you're in tune with me because you start studying the message you'll see this reoccurring thing popping up over and over and over and over again how the people wanted god to perform first and they would serve him after when the reality was god says serve me first and i reward you i will give you even to the half of my kingdom by a reward eternal life for your service for your love for your adoration but we as humans want to see something first and as we reference and cross-reference this we recognize the connection between the spirit and the church we'll see how that the churches in the day amen brother branham preaching in the indictment and other places my brother and sister we're looking at today how the church has come and they have said you know what we we all want to serve god we want to worship god we want to be identified with god but we want to really run this our own way amen says scripture types it out in the parable or story as it were of seven women one husband you don't have to provide for us you don't have to do nothing for us we just want your name and that's what we have in the world today is churches amen that simply are wanting to do what they want to do but they want to claim the name of jesus christ saints of grace let's make sure we never go there let's make sure that we serve god because we want to be personally identified with him we want to be known as his wife hence the the term bride amen that we take this so we recognize the connection between the spirit and the church when the holy spirit has liberty you will find a church that is filled with the power of almighty god you'll see answered prayers you'll see people happy to be serving god when you find a church that has deviated into their own interpretation of what god desires for this day my brother and sister you will find a church then is starting to operate in its own authority and when god says come they can look at him and say i ain't coming see that spirit that attitude is there i ain't coming and they believe that there's no consequence but we see in this story of a hazardous my brother and sister he knew if that spirit spread through the kingdom that then he would just lose it all that it would all fall apart and hence he says i have to do something now my wise men my men who recognize the season the time that we're in what do we do and they said you what you've got to do is let it be known that she no longer is even considered royalty i would say there would be nothing worse in a position to walk around the rest of your life saying i once was the queen past tense not identified in the day that i am the queen but i once was the queen why are you no longer the queen because i wouldn't listen to the king now look through the scripture saints see how that the prophet of god breaks this all down and shows clearly how that at one point in time could be identified we are the queen they still say i'm the queen of heaven but they no longer have any authority in the kingdom of god amen they have lost all authority they have been put out and while she might have still used his name she was no longer of him are you with me you see we had well let me tie this together here get ahead of myself too far revelations 3 17 see this would identify the spirit of our day but my brother and sister would also identify the spirit of vashti because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that after you have rejected the king you are wretched miserable poor blind and naked you realize what happened to vashti they didn't take her out in the backside the desert and throw her out there for the wild dogs saints they actually took her to the far corner of the king's house and they put her there and she never fellowshipped in the body of believers again she never saw the king again she never talked to the king again every communication what you might say is vashti became a prisoner of her own creation amen and you'll find my brother and sister when we as sons and daughters of god dealing with the things of life i'm going to speak straight to you here we deal with the things of life the issues of weaknesses of our flesh and when god comes says i'll deliver you of that and we won't respond to the holy spirit we will end up in a prison of our own creation and people will say it was god's fault it was the church's fault it was the pastor's fault my brother and sister it is of their own creation vasti could have said yes just as easy as she said no and you and i can say yes just as easy as we can say no and so we don't want to come to a place in our life where we look and say i'm in this position because of this message of the hour i'm here because of this person and because of that person no you had a choice yes or no amen and often times we say no because of our feelings our emotions our weaknesses our little complexes we say no because it requires radical change in our life we say no because it will cause us to actually be exposed to the body of believers that's right amen i've shared this before and i just make note of this when you see the holy ghost moving in the midst of a people you will see people breaking away from bonds that have held them i remember being back east i'll just kind of keep it vague probably last time i shared this i spoke too much forgive me but my brother and sister the power of god's starting to move when the holy ghost is unleashed and people are willing to say oh lord speak to me and families coming up and speaking to brother jewell brother jewell just asked me to be part of it and it's there and they're speaking the deep secrets of the problems of their families any volunteers you know why there isn't in the flesh because we're ashamed embarrassed we don't want the world to know that but you know what happens when the holy ghost starts to move the holy ghost comes and moves upon the believer so strongly they want to be right with god more than they care what you think about them they want to be right with god and be delivered of this spirit more than they care what any human on earth might say about them but you see it's got to break through the power of pride and self-preservation to get into that element and then they come and they confess deep dark secrets that you say oh my goodness really can that be true well it can be true my brother and sister because somewhere along the line they said no but oh god rich and mercy come along and the anointing of the holy ghost moves upon them and they say yes lord i want free yes lord i want delivered yes lord i want the holy ghost and god comes and delivers them and they stay delivered amen hallelujah that's a point my brother and sister getting out of prison for the day is not a pardon hallelujah two queens two natures completely opposite in character amen this queen replaced by another we'll get deeper into these things as we look at the church ages and look at what brother brown says about these things but this queen has been replaced by another now look what it is she got replaced with a queen that fit the nature of the king oh hallelujah not a rebellious queen not a queen that says it's my way ah anyway lord forgive me song of my childhood just popped in my head i promise i i won't speak it out okay you don't have to spank your kids to get them quit singing that you see this queen replaced with another god didn't just throw another person in there god chose one that fits so perfectly for the season coming not a queen that fit the idea of a queen of days gone by but a queen that was fit to rule in laodicea not to live to to rule back somewhere else but leo decia she's a queen that was chose for laodicea amen this true queen is so perfectly tailored now i hope you follow what i mean by taylor so she is so perfectly formed to fit this other this this king amen she wasn't of her own nature trying to be pressed into but she was tailored to fit the very nature of the king and she is so perfect oh i hope you get this she is so perfect in his sight she he thinks she is him come on did you catch that she is so perfect in his sight that the king looks at her and says she is me i am her she is me amen that's where the prophet of god speaks these words out of scripture talks about these things right bone of his bone amen spirit of his spirit flesh of his flesh right because she is him hallelujah he's not looking at something that hoping one day she will be like him but he sees her and says she is me this bride of mine this queen of mine is me hallelujah so conformed to the word of god so much so here i am a little ahead of myself forgive me we'll come upon these things again but amen so much like the king his nature his desire what he longed for so much like him he says i'm going to give you an equal place in my kingdom my brother and sister do you know in business in business if you want to form a corporation you want to form an llc or whatever you be real careful if you have partners that aren't flesh and blood and maybe even them but uh you know you want to leave yourself even the most margin of control start an llc brother trevor and i are going to go into business together building tiddlywinks i want fifty one percent of the business brother trevor if he has any sense is gonna say i want 51 right holds that scepter hell even to the 50 50 of my kingdom amen a queen with a nature that he can trust a queen with a character that he hasn't have to question what she's going to do he knows that she cares about him and his kingdom she's going to serve him in fact she's going to become an advisor to him honey do you see this that comes out my brother and sister you know in the story of esther she says you know what this guy's gonna wreck wreck the kingdom he's gonna cause all kinds of divide and trouble and murder and death and whatever else and i can't let that happen to my husband's kingdom now you can say well it was all about the jews know my brother and sister if you look study and find the continuity she was looking out for her husband's kingdom in more than one way that's right right because she was a queen of heaven amen and a queen to a kitten hallelujah she's watching out for that she cares given an equal place in the kingdom see one living only of the blessings of the kingdom and one desiring to full fill all the king asked of her see this is the tale of two queens two spirits in the framework of the christian church there's two queens on the earth today my brother and sister there's two queens one making her profession that she's queen and one that almighty god says this is my queen i don't want to be the one standing around saying i'm the queen i'm the queen i'm the queen and everybody knows you're not amen but to be one where the king would say this is my queen and i have according to the word even given to her the half of the kingdom because she will rule and reign with me hallelujah now i'm going to get very off into this and we'll touch it again but the prophet of god talking about how it is my brother and sister this bride of christ she's not going to go through this judgment she's already left and then she comes back to sit with him in the judgment hallelujah so you're going to be in judgment my brother and sister but you're going to be there with your king and you're going to have a divine judgment you're going to have a divine understanding you're going to have a divine compassion now this will just touch on this and i don't mean to make a point but you hear a lot of people guy holds the door for him praise the lord it's like a cup of cold water he's gonna have eternal life i've run into people that have dispensed eternal life to everything under the sun my brother and sister for everything under the sun but i'll tell you on that day it will be a divine judgment it won't be our neighbor was so kind to us because see you're going to have a hard time tying together a man who's blasphemous and gave you a bag of potatoes so therefore he's got eternal life and have a hard time in the natural balancing things out but on that day you bride queen we're going to sit there with a divine judgment amen not an emotional judgment not analytical judgment not a judgment from history but a divine judgment that you will be able to speak according to the word of god and the will of god why because you know the mind of your husband oh isn't that beautiful to know the mind of your husband i tell you my brother and sister i find it so lovely in the natural amen now i've seen brothers you know this one brother told me says now brother paul he says i want you to understand something he said i act annoyed in public when my wife finishes my sentences i was like i noticed that but he said truly i'm actually pleased because my wife knows me so well the same wife who finishes my sentences knows exactly how i like my socks folded she knows exactly how i like my breakfast she knows exactly how i like my clothes in a closet she knows exactly how that when we're going on a trip that i like to leave at an exact time and she's always ready he said so just to keep her unsettled in how old men get keep her unsettled i always that grumpy can't i finish my own sentence i've been there before when the sister was like you're not capable and then they smile at each other and hold hands as they walk off oh my look tale of two queens two spirits in this framework of the church let me hurry right along here now we have different religions and we have different motives and different theologies but our christian religion is based solemnly upon death burial and resurrection in the second coming of the lord oh it's a it's an important question and as we are now approaching to my most sincere thoughts we are living in the very shadows of his second coming there to my way of seeing it by the light of the scripture there is not one hope left for the church outside of the second coming of the lord now my brother and sister do you follow that some people say see there's just no hope that's not what he's saying the second coming of the lord but let me divide this down in two parts there is his spiritual or presence that has come which some people just freak out and they're like oh oh presents perugia oh this is horrible it's a false thing no perugia is true the misuse of perugia heresy however you want to say it the misuse of that is false but the very fact that god has come right down in our presence and is present with us this morning is an absolute biblical prompts of almighty god he said i'll be with you even in you amen so his presence is here now those who took that doctrine and said god's already come and we can act like a bunch of rebels because it's already done deal so now we can go act like the world because we've been sealed my brother and sister you talk about an anointing that has to be upon these people that say i i've got the holy ghost but i can now have permission to act like the devil make a lick of sense does it amen so you know it's like well i'm a carpenter but i like to burn my work down you see the presence of almighty god once in the heart and mind and soul of a son or daughter of god leaves them in such a love affair that is so deep that as the prophet of god says now i'm getting ready to go to africa and if i was to go and get a hold of my wife and tell her now my dear wife if you go with any other men if you do this if you flirt if you this that and the other when i come home you're divorced and then he turns it right around and says and she reaches up and gets a holes in front of my shirt and says mr branham if you are over there and you do anything and you this that and the other when you come home you're going to be divorced and the prophet of god says wouldn't that be a lovely home then brother brown says and i wouldn't hurt her for nothing because i love her now look at this relationship as a christian my brother and sister even if these perugia people that have this idea that now because god's come and they're sealed they can behave in the old wicked old way my brother and sister they defy the very words of a prophet they say they believe see that shows you right that that spirit is not right because you can't take it through the word so i tell you here we are my brother and sister are living in a time the second coming of the lord i'm here to declare you there'll be a lot of people that might question and say paul you don't know what you're talking about but i'm here to tell you this morning he is here the prophet of god himself said he is here is that the physical coming of the lord no my brother and sister it is not but he said that he would come anoint you and i with his holy spirit he would come and manifest himself to us and the prophet of god says these different ways that god comes and shows himself he called it in morphe when he comes in more faith it's all god so god moving in our presence the holy spirit dealing with our young people dealing with our old people dealing with everyone and we say that oh my brother and sister you imagine if you just pull oh well it's our emotion it's not the presence of god you know what you become in that scenario callous you become so calloused that you'd say i don't need to be moved i've got the holy ghost i can be angry demanding rude and it doesn't matter it does matter the prophet of god didn't make that references and influence of the holy ghost being a dove just to fill up time in a church surface he was speaking to the very nature that we would search for and long for and desire to become as we're now approaching my most sincere thoughts we're living in the very shadow of the second coming there to my feelings it is by the light of the scripture there is not one hope left for the church outside of the second coming of the lord i want you to think about the day we're living in right now right here in the united states the world is in its wild pandemonic condition now that word my brother and sister is not pandemic it is rooted in pandemonium yes sir all through my childhood my early adulthood and unfortunately late adulthood every person who ever climbed the fence at the congressional buildings got shot dead until now and they moved the barricades out of their way and somehow there's an investigation somehow the side doors on the portico of the congressional building were just all unlocked a total breach of protocol and security that's taken place for 200 years just happened to happen and a man gets the congressional medal of freedom for telling them people you can't come in here we don't even know what a hero is anymore and a poor woman who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time had no business being there but is about as dangerous as a book end gets shot dead while people ripping computers off of desks monitors off of walls paintings off of walls waltz right out nothing happened if this doesn't fit pandemonium i don't know what does it's chaos my brother and sister yeah the world in its wild i don't know if i'm even pronouncing it right y'all forgive me that's what happens when you ignore school and then drop out of it this wild pandemonic condition has got completely out of control of every man-made organization in the world kings cannot hold their subjects no more neither can dictators hold their subjects anymore democracy cannot hold its subjects anymore and there is no hope left with the second coming of the lord jesus i tell you what i believe this was spoken for this hour right here amen absolute pandemonium this man burns a car he's giving an expression a protest this man burns a car he's a domestic terrorist if that is not pandemonium even the leadership is in absolute confusion they don't know right from wrong left from right they don't know good from evil evil from good we are living in the time my brother and sister this was spoken in 1957 but the title to me declares it all at the second coming of the lord hallelujah we're going to see this kind of things happening and this is where we are at today amen we are at i you know what i could say this this right here could be pulled out and made into a a uh uh uh uh what would you call it i'm trying to think of the words amen a current events this could be brought in taunt to our homeschool kids and public school kids as a current event this is what's happening a prophet of god stood up under the anointing preached the word and said you're going to see complete pandemonium come into our nation you're going to see illogical things you're going to see things that are so far out of the word of god my brother and sister that it will just boggle your mind might even terrify you but don't worry when these things appear look up look up your redemption draweth nigh why the spirit of two queens that's right now i won't go into it because it's a little deeper and i'm not one that usually likes to just jump into all these things but my brother and sister the prophet's testimony of a season coming of a leadership there's never been an inauguration with so many women with purple dresses on the has been the wannabe now i say this with a little humor please forgive me you need to make sure when you start looking at this stuff and making up your mind that you look at it from god's view not our view because i would say none of these apply because none of them are beautiful but you see we don't understand exactly the words the prophet was anointed when he was talking about a beautiful woman in what context was that beautiful in what way was that expressed i honestly have to say i would not know i would not know so any one of them that was there might have completely fulfilled that or maybe none of them did but it doesn't matter because i can give you a quote right now where brother branham said he's going to come maybe maybe in 15 in 25 years maybe in 50 years maybe a hundred that's right well do the math from that date we've got a ways to go hallelujah sister vika i don't know if you're ready right now or not but christ the mystery or christ revealed in his own word i mean now the next thing happened we're going to shift corners right here saints it's when it's all gathered up into that one person jesus christ bride and body at the physical return of the lord jesus making his three times when he's brought to earth killed crucified raised up manifesting himself in the form of his body which is his bride don't ever let somebody try to take away the significance of who you are in this message okay and now look i know i'm misunderstood and it sounds like i'm kind of anti or pushing back but i'm not i believe in balance amen but you look at this my brother and sister a prophet of god clearly saying right now that manifesting himself am i reading the right words in the form of his body which is his bride so what we have right here it's not all about a prophet that brought a message there has to be a bride to fulfill this form this position this place this identity what other word can i use to fill in that place my brother and sister there has to be a bride that will be part of that body will be blended together with our lord jesus christ and his bride remember i made the comment earlier that esther would be one that was such of the nature such as the form she was such that she would just mold her fit right in there and become one with her king amen that's you and i we have been formed we have been tailored that's the word i'm looking for we've been tailored by the word of god not man's form not man's idea not man's manipulation can we say amen to that that we are so tailored by the word of god the moving of the holy spirit that we blend into our lord jesus christ and we become one with him amen we're not off to the side we're not secondary to the show god pulled it right in and said you know what you are flesh of my flesh bone of my bone spirit of my spirit you are me i am you hallelujah and it's their see which is his bride the woman you get it she is part of his body and the woman and the man is just so close together till they're just almost they are the same hallelujah oh hallelujah look what the prophet of god did he come along and put a little quantifier on there they ought to be anyhow amen and i'd say to anyone that's married and they don't have that kind of relationship husband and wife do something about it because it is possible to become so close that you are one in spirit in mind not in the physical body but in a spiritual body to be part of the body the kingdom of almighty god the prophet of god says this body can't move without all its parts oh hallelujah they ought to be anyhow there they are see they just exactly manifested the same you catch the english of that it's talking about the lord jesus and his wife the bride the woman amen just exactly manifested the same there's none of this the lord told me to do something i know it doesn't seem it seems contrary to the word but the lord told me to no no they're going to manifest the same we are going to become the pitcher of the word oh hallelujah i'm sorry i just get excited she is a part of him because she was taken out from him and the bride way back when in the first century you know that we had a perfect example of a church back there way back when oh we had the dark ages i mean what he said is it and the bride today do you believe in the literal manifestation of a message you see if we don't then we can take whatever part we want because it's abstract and in the abstract you can draw out whatever part of the abstract that you want to draw out but in the literal manifestation and the bride today is taken out from the body of christ that's why you always were different that's why you never fit in in school that's why you never fit in the world you never fit in that because you're not of that body you're of this body the body of jesus christ amen and the bride today is taken out from the body of christ which is acting and doing just exactly like he said it would do for this day brother christian our little conversation this is why i believe this is the manifestation of the message of the hour it is not because a sign took place here a supernatural event here a thought or a heart was discerned there a healing took place over here it's because this message is producing a people a people who are not bound by fear not bound by law not bound by ideology they are bound by a love for jesus christ amen and he said this is what the word would the bible said this is what would be produced in this day amen hallelujah let me just read it all in continuity here and the bride today is taken out from the body of christ which is acting and doing just exactly like he said it would do for this day the bride the queen king and queen hallelujah well there might be two queens on the earth but one of them's got power and authority and half of the kingdom hallelujah aren't you glad god didn't just give you a worldly queen spirit amen you know the one that struts itself up and down the street and says i am rich and i have need of nothing hallelujah god help us sister emmy would you come hallelujah you know saints we have this lovely lovely experience today our sister vika amen god been dealing with her heart amen amen and as the lord deals with our young people old people whoever it might be people amen as god deals with him we want to saints create an atmosphere what the word says we will be let us be we don't want to we don't want to put any kind of men's ideas because when we put men's ideas into it we end up with men's results and so far i look around this world and they're not doing too well more money more wealth more whatever than ever before and less of god but god said that he would pour himself out this is kind of a paraphrase he poured himself out in this generation did god have to hold back what he poured out no sir he poured all of himself and we were here to receive
