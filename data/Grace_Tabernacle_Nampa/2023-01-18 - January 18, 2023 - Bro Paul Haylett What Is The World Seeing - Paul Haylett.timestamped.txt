[30:09] [Music]
[30:22] isn't it wonderful to be recipients of
[30:24] that Grace
[30:26] a man to trust him
[30:28] you know we live in a world that one of
[30:29] the greatest challenges as we deal with
[30:32] young people in South Africa one of the
[30:35] greatest challenges that is expressed is
[30:39] the ability to trust and that is in a
[30:42] world we live today Satan has done
[30:45] everything he can to undermine
[30:48] and so there is no respect in the in the
[30:52] world today for any position hardly at
[30:55] all uh and uh it's interesting by God's
[30:58] grace that we have come to a place that
[31:02] truly we could almost make it a theme
[31:04] that we trust in Jesus amen I just this
[31:08] is not quite in line with my thought
[31:10] tonight but in events made clear by
[31:13] prophecy I just couldn't help but share
[31:16] this with you tonight and it would be
[31:19] paragraph 36
[31:21] events made clear by prophecy brother
[31:24] Branham says this and when you see the
[31:25] church getting worldly it's not talking
[31:27] about the bride now right he's talking
[31:29] about the nominal Church you see the
[31:32] church getting worldly like it was in
[31:34] the days of Sodom see the church world
[31:36] all going into the worship of the God of
[31:39] this evil age seeing that then seeing a
[31:42] little minority group gathered out under
[31:45] inspiration of God in this beautiful
[31:48] maybe I'm reading too much into this but
[31:51] we are the inspiration of God isn't that
[31:55] beautiful to realize is just not a
[31:57] thought you know we've had many thoughts
[31:59] during the day but an inspiration is
[32:02] something that stirs you up and brings a
[32:05] life and I it makes me so happy to
[32:07] realize that we've been brought up under
[32:09] that inspiration so that makes us
[32:12] inspiration of God producing again the
[32:15] life of Jesus Christ by the scriptures
[32:18] that's supposed to happen you know what
[32:20] hour we're living in the Bible foretells
[32:23] by prophecy what day that we're living
[32:26] and what time we're living and what kind
[32:28] of events ought to be taking place it
[32:31] foretells it exactly to the letter and
[32:34] has never missed one age all the time
[32:37] not one time has it ever missed and it
[32:40] won't I say Amen to that for who are
[32:45] predestinated to see it will see it
[32:47] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[32:50] my father draws him and all that my
[32:52] father has given me will come amen
[32:56] realize that we have been given to him
[32:59] amen because that's what's causing us to
[33:02] come there'll be that part of the plan
[33:04] of God Amen and so given me will come
[33:07] it's the word joining with the word
[33:13] my here again if I sound like I just
[33:15] have a lot of bold proclamations I'm
[33:18] glad tonight I can lift a hand and say I
[33:20] am the word amen it's not our thought
[33:23] it's not an emotion but it is the very
[33:26] life the word of Christ in US amen
[33:30] it can't do nothing else
[33:32] we know that that the day we're living
[33:34] in amen and I'm glad that we are living
[33:37] in this day although I can tell you when
[33:40] you go and do a little travel we had a
[33:42] lovely time in in Arizona lovely time
[33:45] with family grandchildren but my
[33:47] brothers and sisters everywhere you go
[33:51] you just feel like wow how much more of
[33:56] this do we have to put up with
[33:59] every single thing you you just go and
[34:03] it's there before us it's in our face
[34:04] it's in our face it's bold and uh the
[34:09] thing that's so beautiful about it is
[34:11] God said not only have we overcome this
[34:14] age but we have become the witnesses and
[34:17] this evening if I can it might be a
[34:20] little convoluted in my title and my
[34:22] thoughts I hope you don't mind but I
[34:24] want to carry on a little bit along the
[34:26] lines of the Olive Tree as we spoke last
[34:30] Wednesday
[34:31] so let's just stand and go into the
[34:33] reading of the word
[34:35] I'm so sorry our sister sister Jerry
[34:39] told me your name and I
[34:42] need a Hatfield yes God bless you Sister
[34:46] Nita
[34:46] through the Year sister Jerry has always
[34:48] spoke so highly of the whole family and
[34:51] and uh although I don't really know them
[34:54] at all I've met a couple times and
[34:57] that's good we're glad to have you on
[35:00] let's turn our Bibles to Exodus 27.
[35:04] verses 19 through 21 I hope as I
[35:09] approach this I kept saying Lord there's
[35:10] got to be something uh with a little
[35:14] more clarity and you know Paul's like
[35:17] leaping from log to log through the
[35:20] forest and saying surely everyone will
[35:22] follow me and so hopefully you can
[35:25] tonight and uh
[35:27] Exodus 27-19
[35:30] all the vessels of the Tabernacle and
[35:33] all the service thereof and all the pins
[35:35] thereof and all the pins of the Court
[35:37] shall be of brass and thou shalt command
[35:40] the children of Israel that they bring
[35:43] thee pure oil olive beaten for the light
[35:47] to cause the lamp to burn always in the
[35:52] Tabernacle of the congregation without
[35:53] the veil which is before the testimony
[35:56] Aaron and his son shall order it from
[35:59] evening to morning before the Lord it
[36:02] shall be statute forever unto their
[36:04] Generations on the behalf of the
[36:07] children of Israel
[36:09] let's just take before the Lord Heavenly
[36:12] Father we just come tonight and Lord we
[36:14] just
[36:15] I pray father you just help me Lord to
[36:18] bring Clarity to these thoughts and Lord
[36:20] just ask you to speak to the hearts and
[36:22] the needs of each one that's here and
[36:24] each one that is not just asking father
[36:27] for just that strength that comes from
[36:29] you the moving of our spirit that
[36:32] inspiration that brings life to us Lord
[36:34] and just ask now for the leadership
[36:36] father as we bring this in the name of
[36:39] Jesus Christ amen you may be seated
[36:43] amen we also want to they might I don't
[36:46] know the time difference they might
[36:47] almost be finished but uh brother Berry
[36:49] was going to interview kind of uh
[36:52] something with brother Sergey and so
[36:54] I've been just saying a couple prayers
[36:57] for brother Sergey through the day and
[36:58] and uh just trust as they kind of bring
[37:02] out some of these things that are
[37:03] happening in the Ukraine and however
[37:05] that service would lead we just if it's
[37:09] not finished we just pray God just bring
[37:11] a wonderful presence there
[37:13] amen as we look at this I want to focus
[37:16] here that the children of Israel were
[37:19] commanded to bring the pure oil olive
[37:22] beaten for the light to cause the lamp
[37:24] to burn always now as they were called
[37:27] to bring this my brother and sister
[37:29] there was a purpose that God had for
[37:31] them to bring this that the lamp would
[37:34] shine there at the uh without the veil
[37:37] that it would be there to be a light
[37:39] always shining and that was an Evidence
[37:42] or one of the evidences we might say
[37:44] that God was present with them that
[37:47] light shining was a reassurance to the
[37:49] hearts and souls of Israel that the
[37:52] light that God was present with them and
[37:55] you know they weren't called to just
[37:57] bring any old oil and I hope tonight
[37:59] that you'll just have your thinking your
[38:02] spiritual thinking caps on to kind of
[38:04] catch this as if I stopped to explain
[38:06] all the different connections it would
[38:09] be quite lengthy but they weren't called
[38:12] to bring just any oil feel better oil
[38:14] that had been prepared and my brother
[38:16] and sister I hope you can follow me here
[38:18] in this it is a time and a place that
[38:21] God comes and it's the Holy Spirit
[38:23] falling on us which is a type of the
[38:26] olive oil that oil is there and my
[38:29] brother and sister but there is
[38:30] preparation on our part to bring that
[38:33] and we can come into the world today and
[38:36] say we have the Holy Ghost and a great
[38:38] portion of the religious world the
[38:41] Christian world says we have the Holy
[38:43] Ghost but they're trying to bring just
[38:45] any kind of oil and bring it as an
[38:48] offering for the light to shine and so
[38:50] we realize it's not just any kind of oil
[38:53] it's not an anointing as it was of the
[38:55] Holy Spirit just Upon Our flesh because
[38:57] my brother and sister as I'll go into it
[39:00] a little deeper in just a few minutes it
[39:02] is there my brother and sister that we
[39:04] recognize that this Holy Ghost Fire has
[39:07] to be kept as a clean fire it has to be
[39:09] kept and fed with a a prepared oil it
[39:13] can't just be any old religious
[39:16] presentation and so it is that it has to
[39:19] be prepared for uh making light and my
[39:23] brother and sister it is because the
[39:25] light must continue to burn now we look
[39:28] at this and I hope you can follow me see
[39:31] we are thankful for the light that burns
[39:34] in our life we are thankful for the
[39:37] grace of God the light that is a lamp
[39:40] into our feet we're thankful for every
[39:42] representation that there is but we look
[39:45] at this and realize that for the oil to
[39:47] flow
[39:50] to make it down into the lamp and flow
[39:52] down through the channels it had to be
[39:55] clean enough
[39:57] to not clog up the channel
[39:59] for it to flow freely
[40:01] so the oil that Israel was commanded to
[40:04] bring had to be an oil that was beaten
[40:07] for the light it was a oil that was
[40:09] purified it didn't have all kinds of uh
[40:12] external things floating in it it didn't
[40:15] have all kinds of of other things that
[40:18] were mixed with it but it was had to be
[40:20] prepared in such a way that it would
[40:22] flow and come right down and we're not
[40:25] going into detail tonight uh just want
[40:27] to lay out this thought but it's there
[40:29] that it had to be able to come down and
[40:32] flow in there it didn't need to be a
[40:34] light that had to be babyset as it were
[40:37] do you follow what I mean there and so
[40:39] it's there that this light this oil had
[40:42] to come down that the light would
[40:43] continue to burn always and you know it
[40:46] is there that we're thankful for the
[40:48] light in our day we're thankful for the
[40:51] message of the hour for the holy ghost
[40:52] that has come and been promised to us
[40:55] and is ours as it were now remember no
[40:58] man has ever come to God God has always
[41:00] come to man but we as Sons and Daughters
[41:03] of God must do our part to stay in the
[41:07] presence of the Holy Spirit otherwise we
[41:09] would just say well I was anointed five
[41:11] years ago and that must be good enough
[41:13] we must come every single day pursuing
[41:16] and when I say that it's only the
[41:18] unction of God the holy spirit in us
[41:21] that causes us to pursue the holy spirit
[41:23] so we read the little uh quote there out
[41:26] of out of uh uh
[41:30] events made clear by prophecy that it is
[41:33] the word coming to the word so my
[41:35] brother and sister when you and I are
[41:38] actively seeking the Holy Ghost it's the
[41:40] Holy Ghost in us that is seeking the
[41:43] Holy Ghost and so by God's grace we uh
[41:46] continue to press forward into the mark
[41:49] of the high calling and so we realize
[41:51] that the light that has in our life
[41:54] right now is always shining we don't
[41:57] always feel like it there are little
[41:58] things that we bump up against and we
[42:01] have have to stop we have to apologize
[42:03] we have to make things right in our life
[42:06] we have to consecrate ourselves again
[42:08] and consecrate ourselves in a greater
[42:10] way but my brother and sister I will
[42:12] make this statement tonight the only
[42:15] shortage of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[42:18] is man-made
[42:22] God is not stingy he's not going to
[42:24] shorten not what he gives to us there is
[42:27] no supply chain issues with the Holy
[42:30] Ghost
[42:31] and so it is there that the only
[42:33] shortage there is is man-made now if we
[42:37] look at that and recognize that the only
[42:38] shortage is man-made and the devil tries
[42:41] to come and anoint us as though God is
[42:44] not with us my brother and sister
[42:46] realize that's just the devil talking
[42:48] because the only way that the holy
[42:51] spirit is not with us as if we have not
[42:53] made the atmosphere uh correct or the
[42:57] present of God in our life now let's
[43:00] look at this presentation this
[43:02] preparation I mean of the the olive oil
[43:05] and you look at this that they take the
[43:09] olives and they clean all the debris out
[43:12] of it they can and then they start to
[43:15] wash it and uh much of the debris little
[43:18] pieces of leaves and twigs and other
[43:22] things that would be there they start to
[43:24] come to the surface as they wash this
[43:26] away and I hope that you can see and we
[43:29] can type this in tonight real quickly
[43:32] briefly tonight that what happens in our
[43:35] life it starts with our life as it were
[43:37] and God starts to wash us and and the
[43:40] debris starts to be washed away the
[43:42] things start to come and float away and
[43:45] be washed brother Branham talks about it
[43:46] in the spring how this spring uh cleans
[43:50] itself it doesn't clean itself because
[43:52] it stops and throws all the sticks and
[43:54] twigs out it cleans Itself by the spirit
[43:58] amen bubbling up inside flowing washing
[44:02] it away it's not something it can do in
[44:05] and of itself but just the very nature
[44:07] of being a spring is a washing that
[44:10] cleanses us and so we see this
[44:12] preparation of the Olive and we clean
[44:15] out the debris and we wash it
[44:17] and then we take and we grind it into a
[44:20] paste
[44:21] and in grinding it to a paste what we're
[44:24] doing is we're causing and I did not
[44:27] even bother to write the uh names of all
[44:30] these processes and oils and things that
[44:32] are happening there because I didn't
[44:34] want to be that specific tonight but
[44:37] they start to grind it and when the
[44:39] grinding comes it starts to bring out it
[44:42] breaks it down and starts to bring out
[44:44] the oils and so as it is the oils being
[44:48] a ground are being brought out now my
[44:52] brother and sister it after the fact
[44:54] that it's ground it must be stirred
[44:56] because that continues the process of
[44:59] the oils separating from all of the rest
[45:03] of it all of the pits and all of the
[45:06] fiber that is not uh uh beneficial the
[45:10] stirring must be done and and they
[45:12] declare this is more from an older
[45:14] generation now they use giant machines
[45:17] but from an older generation you can add
[45:20] things to this paste to make it stir
[45:23] easier you can add water or you can add
[45:27] other elements to it to make it stir
[45:29] easier and I thought isn't that the way
[45:32] of the world today when it comes to
[45:34] serving God we instead of letting the
[45:36] Holy Spirit stir Our Lives we add little
[45:39] things a little doctrines little Creeds
[45:42] little things behaviors just to make it
[45:45] easy year
[45:47] but God didn't call us because it's easy
[45:49] my brother and sister he called us
[45:51] because we are as I read here we are
[45:55] Gods amen amen amen it sounds so foreign
[45:58] to us right but we are there the very
[46:01] DNA people say well where are you going
[46:03] but we can say Amen to the fact we're
[46:06] the very DNA of Jesus Christ and if that
[46:10] is so then that means we are little gods
[46:12] and it is I have a quote I shared with
[46:15] brother Chris in the back where the
[46:17] prophet of God is talking about how that
[46:20] it was that Adam had Supreme control
[46:24] over the Earth my brother and sister not
[46:26] partial control not control on Alternate
[46:29] days but Supreme control and brother
[46:32] Brown's talking about how he was a
[46:34] little God in control of that and that
[46:37] was there and it was not taken away by
[46:40] God because God decided that Adam wasn't
[46:44] good enough for that it was taken away
[46:46] because of the decision that Adam chose
[46:49] to make and of course we understand that
[46:51] we don't need to go tonight because what
[46:53] hope would we have as Gentiles as bride
[46:56] of of Christ if God had said I'm just
[46:59] going to let Adam and Eve be wiped off
[47:01] my brother and sister there was no
[47:03] protection for the bride for the wife
[47:05] and you know you look at this and we
[47:07] trace it all down through the message
[47:09] and see how it was that Jesus Christ
[47:11] Adam gave his life for Eve or our
[47:15] bridegroom gave his life for us and I am
[47:18] thankful for that it's not just a simple
[47:20] they sinned but my brother and sister
[47:22] God said I have a remedy
[47:25] oh isn't that beautiful we can look at
[47:27] the sin or we can look at the remedy and
[47:30] tonight I'm thankful God's allowed us to
[47:32] focus on the remedy amen so it must be
[47:36] stirred amen have you ever felt that
[47:38] stir stick as it were in your life have
[47:41] you ever felt the tender hand of Jehovah
[47:43] just stirring up our lives what is he
[47:47] doing he's bringing to a place I'll get
[47:49] ahead of myself but he's bringing us to
[47:51] a place of the ultimate because it's not
[47:54] the pits now we use that as a phrase in
[47:56] conversation sometimes oh man this is
[47:59] the pit well it's the truth God is
[48:01] stirring us because he's separating us
[48:04] from the pits amen and so you look at
[48:07] this and how God is there and all of the
[48:09] rest of these things that are not
[48:11] necessary for us to take a rapture
[48:14] God is stirring that
[48:16] bringing a separation
[48:18] and all I can say is this thank you Lord
[48:20] because imagine if left to us we've been
[48:23] taking houses and lands and cars and
[48:25] this and that and our ant we love so
[48:28] much and maybe this person and that
[48:29] person and our best friend we'd be
[48:31] taking them all with us
[48:33] but God's stirring and stirring and
[48:35] stirring and it's bringing a separation
[48:37] and my brother and sister the word of
[48:39] God said come out of her my people and
[48:41] we are being stirred and we are coming
[48:44] out amen that ought to just make our
[48:47] hearts so happy tonight to realize that
[48:50] God is actually doing the work that is
[48:53] going to bring us out from amongst them
[48:57] we would say well I've had to give up so
[49:00] no so much you know not really because
[49:03] you see it was God stirring and bringing
[49:05] that giving us the ability to give it up
[49:08] because the Earthly ability would never
[49:10] give it up
[49:14] so the things that are added to make it
[49:16] easier my brother and sister this is the
[49:18] things and tonight I'm just gonna kind
[49:20] of give you the brief Glimpse the
[49:22] prophet of God said that the church all
[49:24] it can really offer the denominational
[49:25] Church all it can really offer in this
[49:28] day is a lukewarm spirit and tradition
[49:34] that's the best the church can offer
[49:36] today so we see how the word of God is
[49:39] coming and bringing us to a place that
[49:41] literally we would say Lord I only want
[49:44] the pure word don't don't bring any
[49:46] additives in don't make it easier for me
[49:48] don't Lord don't let my flesh be
[49:51] offended let me always say if that's the
[49:53] word Lord then I want the word amen
[49:57] because otherwise all these little
[49:58] ingredients come in and it confuses it
[50:01] and pretty soon we're comfortable
[50:02] sitting in church but we're not
[50:04] comfortable in the presence of God
[50:06] and the truth is my brother and sister
[50:08] God doesn't really care how we feel in
[50:10] church as long as we're comfortable in
[50:12] his presence amen I remember years ago
[50:15] people saying well I don't know if if we
[50:18] can sit that long well my brother and
[50:21] sister if you're on fire you can sit
[50:23] that long
[50:24] hmm
[50:26] yes I was hoping for another amen or two
[50:29] amen but look what's happened this
[50:32] separation
[50:34] there's a final product
[50:36] that comes from all of this
[50:41] but as it cools down
[50:43] this final product this olive oil is it
[50:47] cools down it gets cloudy
[50:53] so how do you take it from being cloudy
[50:57] you warm it up
[51:02] I just look at that and I'm like thank
[51:04] you Lord
[51:06] I don't want a cloudy vision of my Lord
[51:09] and Savior I don't want a cloudy vision
[51:11] of who I am or why I'm here I'm a cloudy
[51:14] vision of God's Vision I want to see it
[51:16] clearly so what's God do he just warms
[51:19] up
[51:19] his bride not lukewarm
[51:23] he brings her to where she's warm enough
[51:26] that all the cloudiness Fades away now
[51:30] different olive oils at different places
[51:33] from different regions they all have a
[51:35] little bit different uh point in which
[51:37] the cloudiness goes away and look at
[51:40] what God does what God has for a message
[51:42] my brother and sister is just the same
[51:45] message all over the world but we don't
[51:48] live as it were in the middle of
[51:50] Tanzania we don't live in the middle of
[51:53] some of these different countries we
[51:54] don't live in Russia or wherever and so
[51:57] how God deals with them will be a little
[52:00] different than how he deals with us but
[52:02] the common denominator is it's olive oil
[52:05] and there's heat involved amen so the
[52:08] Holy Ghost gets us warmed up and our
[52:11] vision quits being cloudy and our vision
[52:14] of Jesus Christ clears up do we
[52:17] recognize who we are in him and when we
[52:21] recognize who we are in him we suddenly
[52:23] realize like Esther that we actually can
[52:27] come boldly to the throne now they have
[52:29] all kinds of stories about Esther and
[52:32] all kinds of stories about Rahab and all
[52:34] of these things but my brother and
[52:36] sister we have a Clarity today that the
[52:39] thing that changed their life was them
[52:41] recognizing who they was amen they tried
[52:46] to tell us in Israel that Rahab was just
[52:49] a food deliverer lady my brother and
[52:52] sister my Bible says harlot
[52:54] so you see how they try to soften this
[52:57] down
[52:58] but I tell you when Rahab saw who she
[53:03] was it started to warm her up and her
[53:06] vision was no longer cloudy and she
[53:08] didn't say I'm Rahab the ex Harlot she
[53:11] was Rahab the daughter of God because
[53:15] her vision had Clarity and she knew
[53:18] exactly who she was
[53:20] Hallelujah and she knew that the blood
[53:22] of Jesus Christ even though they didn't
[53:24] speak of it in that day in that fashion
[53:27] but she knew she had been forgiven and
[53:30] when Solomon wanted to court her to be
[53:33] wife she didn't stand there and say I'm
[53:35] unworthy I'm unworthy I'm unworthy but
[53:38] when he come and come with a vision and
[53:41] expressed his great love to her she said
[53:44] you know what I've been washed I'm clean
[53:46] I am worthy Hallelujah and how the
[53:50] presence of God Has Come Oh how Rahab
[53:53] has come once again and been manifested
[53:55] on the Earth but she recognizes I am not
[53:58] not here to be judged by my previous
[54:00] sins and they have been forgiven and I
[54:03] have Clarity of who I am in Jesus Christ
[54:07] and this little bride is standing up and
[54:10] saying oh make love to me Lord make love
[54:12] to me let your word speak to my heart
[54:15] May the rustle of the trees and the
[54:18] sunrise and sunset all of these things
[54:21] are speaking to this little bride
[54:24] Hallelujah oh my brother and sister all
[54:27] it takes is getting warmed up and it'll
[54:30] change our vision now let's look at this
[54:33] my brother and sister just moving
[54:34] forward
[54:39] what good is the olive oil
[54:42] that we just
[54:44] come to church and try to store up as
[54:46] much Holy Ghost as we can in the storage
[54:48] room at the church
[54:53] let me put it if I could type it to you
[54:56] this way
[54:58] it wouldn't matter if we had every
[55:00] sermon
[55:01] in book form
[55:03] had it all on a cassette tape and had it
[55:06] on I don't know
[55:08] I'm out of touch anymore I'm sliding
[55:11] Saints pray for me
[55:14] my own daughter today was like sorry Dad
[55:17] that you don't live in the 21st century
[55:21] I was so offended
[55:27] it had a CD that was a word I couldn't
[55:29] even think of
[55:31] that terrible
[55:33] you know in thumb drives
[55:35] we could have all of that
[55:38] sitting on our Shelf
[55:41] and be cooling down
[55:47] getting colder
[55:49] and cloudier
[55:50] and I hope I don't offend anyone tonight
[55:53] because I certainly don't mean it this
[55:54] way
[55:55] but the colder I get the bigger problem
[55:57] I have with brother Trevor
[56:05] oh wait don't laugh I'm gonna name you
[56:07] guys next
[56:10] isn't it interesting how there's such an
[56:13] ebb and flow that goes with this
[56:15] but we get on fire and we just realize
[56:18] oh Lord
[56:19] yes I understand
[56:22] I pray for or I lift up or yeah
[56:26] sorry for using your brother Trevor
[56:29] you see oftentimes it's not really this
[56:33] situation
[56:35] but it's how we react to it
[56:39] but I have 1200 books on my bookcase
[56:47] and it's getting cloudier
[56:51] until
[56:53] I see the message
[56:56] as just a religion
[57:03] but I tell you what happens
[57:05] holy ghost ever starts stirring us nice
[57:08] and hard
[57:10] ER than our old flashlights
[57:13] harder than we think is necessary
[57:16] starts to deal with us and we start to
[57:19] warm up a little bit and the cloudiness
[57:21] starts to drift away and then we realize
[57:24] you know what I should be doing you know
[57:26] I talked to an individual he said well
[57:27] they're no longer printing the books I I
[57:30] just I I don't like to use them so much
[57:33] because I don't want them to wear out
[57:39] and in some parts of the world they'll
[57:41] take a message book and split it in half
[57:45] and distribute it amongst themselves
[57:47] because that's all they've got
[57:49] but ours
[57:52] are in pristine condition
[57:55] and our vision of what the message was
[57:57] about is cloudy
[58:00] they have a page or two
[58:02] and their vision
[58:04] is twenty twenty
[58:08] of who they are and what God called them
[58:10] to you see it won't matter how much oil
[58:13] we think we've got stored in the church
[58:15] my brother and sister
[58:18] it's how much oil are we burning
[58:22] we get the idea that storing the oil is
[58:25] what is the purpose
[58:28] but the purpose of Israel being
[58:31] commanded to bring the oil was not to
[58:33] store it
[58:34] but to burn it
[58:36] to let that oil that had been cleaned
[58:41] and beaten and processed and put through
[58:43] trials and struggles that it would flow
[58:47] the whole thing about it my brother and
[58:49] sister if the oil won't flow it can't
[58:52] make it to the Candlestick and will not
[58:54] produce light
[58:56] so the oil was not that we have the best
[58:58] version of the message we are this or
[59:01] that my brother and sister you know it's
[59:03] just interesting you hear different
[59:05] things from different parts of the world
[59:07] and you know there'll be a part of the
[59:09] world over here that say we have the
[59:11] Revelation and the part over here says
[59:13] we have the Revelation but let us just
[59:16] judge it how much fire does that produce
[59:20] and we're not talking about the running
[59:22] and jumping and screaming and falling
[59:24] down and kicking around that people say
[59:27] well that's the evidence we're on fire
[59:29] my brother and sister if that was the
[59:31] case the Pentecostals would put us to
[59:33] shame
[59:35] it's a life that light is shining and
[59:38] that light is giving life to you and I
[59:41] and so to do that we must be burning the
[59:45] Holy Ghost and I've likened it many
[59:47] times from this Pulpit that the Holy
[59:49] Ghost to a son or daughter of God is as
[59:51] gasoline is to a car and none of us
[59:54] would expect to drive to Chicago from
[59:56] here without stopping and filling up our
[59:59] car and none of us should expect that we
[1:00:01] can go through our daily life without
[1:00:03] needing a filling and a refilling and a
[1:00:06] refilling and a refilling because we
[1:00:08] should be burning the oil we should be
[1:00:10] living out our lives and let that become
[1:00:13] the expression of Who We Are
[1:00:16] the relationship between the oil and the
[1:00:18] Candlestick is an intrinsic connection
[1:00:21] so we look at the oil olive oil being a
[1:00:24] representation of the Holy Ghost as we
[1:00:26] all know the prophet makes that type in
[1:00:28] fact the Christian world makes that type
[1:00:30] amen it was not meant for us to let it
[1:00:33] get stale
[1:00:35] right
[1:00:37] amen not meant for us to let it get
[1:00:39] stale and that means my brother and
[1:00:42] sister if we are actively seeking the
[1:00:44] Holy Ghost every single day but we are
[1:00:47] not burning it I hope you're following
[1:00:49] me in context it we're not burning it
[1:00:51] what would happen we'd have no place to
[1:00:52] go with the Holy Ghost we'd quit seeking
[1:00:54] it
[1:00:56] so people say we've got it in abundance
[1:00:58] we don't need any more but my brother
[1:01:01] and sister they say that olive oil when
[1:01:03] it is rancid and we all know this from
[1:01:05] the olive oil we cook with even when it
[1:01:07] sits around too long in the presence of
[1:01:10] too much oxygen which is the world that
[1:01:12] it gets rancid and it leaves a bitter
[1:01:15] aftertaste it taints the taste of
[1:01:18] whatever you are tasting it whether you
[1:01:20] cooked food in it or you were one of
[1:01:22] those that drinks a little cup full for
[1:01:24] your Health's sake
[1:01:27] you look at this
[1:01:32] how was the Holy Ghost meant to be
[1:01:34] expressed in our lives
[1:01:37] if God intended for us to
[1:01:42] Express the Holy Ghost just by saying I
[1:01:44] have the Holy Ghost
[1:01:47] if that's what he wanted us to do my
[1:01:49] brother and sister then you would never
[1:01:52] be able to separate
[1:01:54] the tear from the wheat because
[1:01:56] everybody would just say I have the Holy
[1:01:59] Ghost
[1:02:01] so there is a very tangible result of
[1:02:06] the presence of the Holy Ghost in our
[1:02:08] life very tangible
[1:02:12] in the world we live in today
[1:02:15] olive oil has become a worldwide
[1:02:18] commodity
[1:02:22] and the scripture says
[1:02:25] that the word would go
[1:02:27] to every
[1:02:29] Nation Kindred and tongue
[1:02:34] see how beautiful this type is that it
[1:02:36] just carries out now the use here in the
[1:02:41] Templar Tabernacle was not to just claim
[1:02:44] that we have olive oil
[1:02:46] the people bringing the oil they don't
[1:02:48] bring it and the priest doesn't say
[1:02:49] thank you we now have ten thousand
[1:02:51] gallons
[1:02:52] but they every single day had a
[1:02:55] commandment
[1:02:57] to let the light shine every single day
[1:03:03] it had to be burning and it was given
[1:03:07] as a statute
[1:03:09] forever to their Generations
[1:03:12] in other words it wasn't a commandment
[1:03:14] to be given for a single time a single
[1:03:17] event or a single period of time but it
[1:03:20] was a statute unto the generations and
[1:03:24] so it was there my brother and sister as
[1:03:26] it has been for years we see there's
[1:03:29] great things happening in the world
[1:03:31] today we're seeing God move in ways that
[1:03:33] we don't understand we're finding the
[1:03:36] gospel in ways that we can't even even
[1:03:39] understand the connections the message
[1:03:42] is an example is making it into the
[1:03:45] heart of countries like Iran
[1:03:48] but yet no one really knows exactly it
[1:03:51] wasn't like brother so and so went there
[1:03:53] and gave him a book or gave him a tape
[1:03:55] these people are in the middle of
[1:03:57] nowhere in the world that they are in uh
[1:04:00] we won't focus on that
[1:04:03] and somehow the message
[1:04:05] comes to them
[1:04:09] wow how lucky they are
[1:04:16] my brother and sister that's not luck
[1:04:19] that's prophecy fulfilled
[1:04:22] that as it were if you'll follow me is
[1:04:25] the olive oil
[1:04:27] going through a land
[1:04:30] that has all kinds of prophecies
[1:04:32] concerning it and a lot of them are not
[1:04:34] good
[1:04:35] and that olive oil is making it through
[1:04:37] that land
[1:04:39] and filling the crews of their lamp
[1:04:45] look at that
[1:04:47] how can that be
[1:04:49] because it will and as I don't know
[1:04:54] maybe we might be able to use past tense
[1:04:56] I don't know
[1:04:58] um
[1:04:59] Every Nation
[1:05:02] kindred and down
[1:05:05] and that oil my brother and sister is
[1:05:07] the same pure oil
[1:05:09] that is lighting or fueling our lamp
[1:05:13] it's not a nether oil not another
[1:05:15] version not a substitute it doesn't have
[1:05:17] to be added to or taken away from it
[1:05:20] doesn't have to be diluted down or
[1:05:22] anything just the pure word of God
[1:05:24] striking a soul in a land where you can
[1:05:27] be killed for being a Christian and they
[1:05:29] be they they be man my English tonight
[1:05:31] has just fell down
[1:05:33] amen and they are
[1:05:36] standing up confessing I'm a Son of God
[1:05:38] I'm a daughter of God I'm the seed I'm
[1:05:40] predestinated I am the word
[1:05:43] amen you talk about the power of the
[1:05:46] olive oil you talk about the power of
[1:05:48] the type that God placed in his word to
[1:05:51] show us the moving of the holy spirit
[1:05:53] will not be held by boundaries or
[1:05:56] limitations or governments or people in
[1:05:59] control but God moves in such a
[1:06:01] supernatural fashion that the word comes
[1:06:05] I always like to remember the little
[1:06:07] story of a sister down in Chile and she
[1:06:10] had some neighbors there and then their
[1:06:12] kind of poor neighborhood or whatever
[1:06:14] and in Chile they had put their trash up
[1:06:16] about a level about like this so the
[1:06:18] dogs because there's like a zillion dogs
[1:06:20] in Chile I mean if you guys are dog
[1:06:22] lovers and you need a pet you could go
[1:06:24] to Chile and adopt probably a whole
[1:06:26] Plane full
[1:06:28] they're everywhere
[1:06:29] but their their trash is up high to keep
[1:06:32] the dogs out and and so the houses they
[1:06:35] share a pole that has the receptacle on
[1:06:37] each side and she noticed these really
[1:06:39] really new looking books
[1:06:43] in Spanish
[1:06:45] kind of hanging out of the trash and so
[1:06:47] she went and pulled two or three books I
[1:06:50] don't remember now exactly pulled pulled
[1:06:51] a couple books we'll say out and she
[1:06:54] took him in the house and and uh she's
[1:06:56] like oh this is interesting it's
[1:06:57] religious material and she's reading it
[1:07:00] and so she sits down and she reads the
[1:07:02] whole thing and something
[1:07:04] gets lit
[1:07:08] oh what did it take just a little olive
[1:07:10] oil
[1:07:12] something gets lit and so she become the
[1:07:16] most regular trash watcher
[1:07:19] that you have ever seen and every week
[1:07:22] or two she would see out of the trash
[1:07:24] some new white or whatever you know
[1:07:27] little booklet and she would go out
[1:07:29] there and pull them out
[1:07:31] and her fire got burning so bright
[1:07:35] she walks over to the neighbor one day
[1:07:38] and knocks on the door and the young man
[1:07:40] comes to the door and she's got a whole
[1:07:43] handful of message books
[1:07:46] and she's like how could you take
[1:07:49] something so precious as this
[1:07:54] put it in the trash
[1:07:56] and he was like well that's what I was
[1:07:58] raised and I don't believe that anymore
[1:08:00] but my mother keeps sending me olive oil
[1:08:07] keeps sending me these books
[1:08:10] and I don't believe that and
[1:08:12] neither does my wife
[1:08:16] and the woman told him
[1:08:19] just give them to me don't throw them in
[1:08:21] the trash just give them to me
[1:08:24] something started stirring her heart she
[1:08:27] found a church she got baptized she's
[1:08:30] just on fire got oil running everywhere
[1:08:34] and she's on fire and she just had a
[1:08:37] burden she said now how would it be that
[1:08:39] this young man could not believe this
[1:08:42] she was saying how could it not be it's
[1:08:44] the opposite of the spirit in most of
[1:08:46] the world this is how can you believe
[1:08:48] this she was on fire and she's saying
[1:08:51] how can you not believe this
[1:08:54] and she decided my job is to shine as
[1:08:58] bright as I can and she befriended
[1:09:01] this couple had a little baby and over
[1:09:04] time she becomes such friends with them
[1:09:06] she would even babysit the little child
[1:09:09] and she just started working on them
[1:09:12] and one day the young man says why
[1:09:14] you're just like a mother to me
[1:09:16] and she was like
[1:09:18] it's working
[1:09:21] it's working
[1:09:22] and she loved them
[1:09:25] right back into the message
[1:09:31] now I'm telling you my brother and
[1:09:33] sister when the olive oil starts flowing
[1:09:35] there's a flame that goes with it we're
[1:09:37] not here to just pour it on the floor
[1:09:39] and slip around in it we're here to
[1:09:41] light it on fire and watch it burn and
[1:09:44] God provides the oil and he keeps the
[1:09:47] lamp burning right this was oil that was
[1:09:49] meant to be burning always not on Sunday
[1:09:53] not on Wednesday night not when we felt
[1:09:56] good always in the good times and in the
[1:09:59] bad in the struggles that we have at all
[1:10:02] times this oil was there meant to be
[1:10:04] burning
[1:10:05] oh Hallelujah
[1:10:07] amen
[1:10:10] you see it's not as I said meant to sit
[1:10:13] and get stale but it was meant to be
[1:10:15] expressed in our lives it was meant to
[1:10:17] have an impact on us and as the oil is
[1:10:20] Flowing down into the lamp my brother
[1:10:22] and sister it was there expressing
[1:10:25] itself in this dark world we say well
[1:10:27] I'm trying to be a witness to my
[1:10:30] neighbor to my co-worker to this my
[1:10:32] brother and sister what you've got to do
[1:10:34] is make sure there's nothing clogging up
[1:10:36] the channel there's nothing you don't
[1:10:38] want the little lamp setting they're
[1:10:39] sputtering and putting off a little puff
[1:10:41] of smoke you want it to burn clean
[1:10:45] that's why no impurities that's why God
[1:10:47] wants to wash that out God is working
[1:10:49] stirring getting that out because it has
[1:10:52] to be without impurity because half of
[1:10:55] the reason young people I just was
[1:10:57] reading this it's a little bit dated
[1:10:59] back a few years maybe like five six
[1:11:01] years but a survey done by a religious
[1:11:04] sir kind of survey group or that's not
[1:11:06] what you call them but anyway half the
[1:11:09] reason that a lot of college age young
[1:11:11] people are rejecting Christianity as
[1:11:14] they said they say this and do this
[1:11:17] they preach this and live this
[1:11:21] oh let the oil be cleaned let the oil
[1:11:24] flow let the candle shine bright that
[1:11:28] there would not be something that is
[1:11:30] sputtering putting off some soot which
[1:11:32] is darkness which is black which is ugly
[1:11:34] which is dirty Let It Burn clean
[1:11:38] Hallelujah
[1:11:41] let it not just be a statement but let
[1:11:43] it be expressed in this Dark World look
[1:11:45] at the world as I started off to share
[1:11:46] with you you can't get on a plane you
[1:11:49] can't fly you can't go to an airport you
[1:11:52] can't go down the street can't go into a
[1:11:54] store you can't walk down the sidewalk
[1:11:55] go to a park you can't do anything my
[1:11:58] brother and sister but what there's
[1:12:00] Darkness around us and I'm telling you I
[1:12:02] want you to look maybe you already do
[1:12:04] but I want you to look at this different
[1:12:05] it isn't uh something like a duty that
[1:12:09] we should do it is Who We Are
[1:12:13] amen we are that Candlestick that was
[1:12:17] meant to be filled with pure oil and
[1:12:20] come down and be lived out and Shining
[1:12:23] always
[1:12:24] Hallelujah
[1:12:26] you see
[1:12:28] it's not a statement that we make it's
[1:12:30] what we are it's who we are it's what
[1:12:32] our expression is
[1:12:34] and look at this as I already got ahead
[1:12:36] of myself
[1:12:37] we can look at this in the natural and
[1:12:38] the spiritual
[1:12:40] that light produces Heat
[1:12:43] you can take even a common light bulb in
[1:12:45] the day we live in just put your hand in
[1:12:47] front of it there's heat
[1:12:49] where there's light there's heat
[1:12:51] now imagine my brother and sister if the
[1:12:53] thing that we need
[1:12:56] how do I say this
[1:13:02] we need clarity
[1:13:05] we need a Clear Vision in this day
[1:13:09] and God says here
[1:13:12] you're Desiring a Clear Vision
[1:13:15] Lord I want to look on your face
[1:13:17] I want to see what you have I want to be
[1:13:20] who you want me to be God turns up the
[1:13:22] heat
[1:13:24] oh my brother and sister there's times
[1:13:26] he's turned up the heat in our lives and
[1:13:28] we're like Lord that's the last thing I
[1:13:29] need
[1:13:30] and he's like no no it is what you need
[1:13:35] because when all of the obscurity goes
[1:13:39] away all the cloudiness goes away and we
[1:13:42] see that Vision not our vision
[1:13:47] his vision
[1:13:49] we see that vision
[1:13:51] I I'm just going to ask you you don't
[1:13:53] have to shake amen say nothing but I'm
[1:13:55] just going to speak from my heart how it
[1:13:57] is when the heat turns up my vision gets
[1:14:00] clearer
[1:14:01] my troubles
[1:14:03] are less troubling
[1:14:07] because it's no longer me
[1:14:11] trying to overcome
[1:14:14] oh we've been made more than Overcomers
[1:14:16] aren't I a great guy I'm such a good
[1:14:19] message believer I am an overcomer
[1:14:22] just turn the heat down a little bit and
[1:14:23] see how far we get
[1:14:25] but when the heat's turned up we're like
[1:14:27] Lord thank you for what you're doing to
[1:14:30] me a man most miserable a man that
[1:14:32] shouldn't even have the pleasure of
[1:14:34] knowing you as a lord and savior and my
[1:14:37] vision of you Lord and then we just find
[1:14:40] ourselves walking right past things that
[1:14:42] used to detour us things that used to
[1:14:44] trouble us the things well I I don't
[1:14:46] like this happen and I don't like that
[1:14:48] happen yeah get your vision amen get
[1:14:51] your vision ask the Lord to turn the
[1:14:53] heat up
[1:14:55] amen huh you know my brother and sister
[1:14:58] this all comes back and I won't go into
[1:15:00] the full detail of this but how many of
[1:15:02] us
[1:15:03] pray for patience yes
[1:15:06] we should be
[1:15:08] we should be for one
[1:15:11] as the bride of Christ God's going to
[1:15:13] give you the test for patience whether
[1:15:14] you want to take it or not
[1:15:17] you know my son is moving forward to
[1:15:20] become a a contractor
[1:15:23] it once it has a desire to move into
[1:15:25] that and the test is very very difficult
[1:15:29] it's a book about that thick it's open
[1:15:31] book
[1:15:32] but it's kind of like the code that the
[1:15:34] law is it's got you know chapter 12 uh
[1:15:38] sub Part B uh sub paragraph 6.122.24
[1:15:49] find it
[1:15:52] he's taken the test twice
[1:15:55] they they won't opt you out they just
[1:15:57] don't allow you to come back in a day or
[1:15:58] two it's like as in weeks before you can
[1:16:00] come back he's taken the test twice the
[1:16:03] second time he's passing the test but he
[1:16:06] ran out of time
[1:16:09] so he got all these questions correct
[1:16:12] but he run out of time
[1:16:15] now I want you there's a reason I'm
[1:16:16] bringing this up
[1:16:18] we see the transition in it before
[1:16:21] you run out of time plus missed
[1:16:24] a lot of questions
[1:16:27] but now he studied
[1:16:29] and he's getting it right
[1:16:32] but he's run out of time
[1:16:37] and the foolish virgin
[1:16:40] ran
[1:16:41] out of time
[1:16:45] and oil
[1:16:47] in a sense you could say oil
[1:16:51] you see what happened was there was too
[1:16:53] many distractions
[1:16:55] now my son offered up to me says Dad I
[1:16:57] figured out it's really hard to study a
[1:16:59] test like that and work 12 hours a day
[1:17:03] but you see my brother and sister God
[1:17:05] said I don't care what your life here
[1:17:07] and your struggles here are if you will
[1:17:09] be patient you will stand and you will
[1:17:11] allow it I will fill you full of the oil
[1:17:15] that you need to shine in this day
[1:17:18] and you won't even have to do it
[1:17:20] yourself you just have to yield and
[1:17:24] allow yourself to be filled
[1:17:26] and I I just you know I wanted to preach
[1:17:28] to my son pray for my my son I talk to
[1:17:31] him a little bit to you know and
[1:17:34] my we could just bring him to church and
[1:17:37] set him down right here and you wouldn't
[1:17:39] even know he wasn't a believer
[1:17:41] because he knows it
[1:17:44] but he's not passing the test
[1:17:48] Lord help him
[1:17:50] I want to see my family saved I want to
[1:17:52] see my son daughter-in-law grandchildren
[1:17:53] saved
[1:17:56] but they got to come to a place I don't
[1:17:58] know how God will do it and it's a
[1:17:59] struggle you know to to Simply say you
[1:18:02] know what Lord whatever it takes it's
[1:18:04] hard to utter that Lord whatever it
[1:18:08] takes to get my children's attention Let
[1:18:11] It Be Lord that Not only would it get
[1:18:13] their attention but in the process it's
[1:18:15] going to have to get ours too because we
[1:18:18] sometimes would make it well there was
[1:18:20] this troubles and there was those
[1:18:21] troubles and they got discouraged my
[1:18:23] brother and sister pray for their soul
[1:18:25] not their emotions
[1:18:27] amen not their success pray for their
[1:18:30] soul
[1:18:31] now look at this light produces Heat
[1:18:34] and Fire
[1:18:36] is self-purifying
[1:18:40] so wherever the presence of
[1:18:43] the oil is that's burning
[1:18:48] is purifying
[1:18:50] my isn't that beautiful
[1:18:53] I hope this is all making sense
[1:18:55] in Exodus 35 maybe like for homework you
[1:18:58] could just go ahead and read that and
[1:19:00] you'll find my brother and sister that
[1:19:02] the guidelines that God laid out for the
[1:19:04] Candlestick to be made were in such a
[1:19:06] way that the they were very precise and
[1:19:09] Not only was the making of the
[1:19:11] Candlestick very precise but the
[1:19:13] placement of the Candlestick was very
[1:19:16] precise and we certainly don't have time
[1:19:18] enough tonight to go through that but
[1:19:20] I'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:19:22] every Candlestick had to be placed in
[1:19:25] such a way that the oil would run into
[1:19:28] it freely
[1:19:31] oh my brother and sister it can't be
[1:19:33] placed in a stadium somewhere it can't
[1:19:35] be placed at some kind of this or kind
[1:19:38] of that it's got to be in a place where
[1:19:41] the oil can run into it freely and so in
[1:19:46] they set up the Tabernacle everything
[1:19:48] had to be placed in such a fashion and
[1:19:51] I'm here to tell you my brother and
[1:19:52] sister we are not here to do a service
[1:19:55] to God without his will we are here to
[1:19:57] come into a perfect place of worship as
[1:19:59] Sons and Daughters of God boldly to walk
[1:20:02] in and say I know this is where God has
[1:20:04] placed me as a Son of God as a daughter
[1:20:06] of God and I'm going to stand right here
[1:20:09] and let the oil flow oh they say you
[1:20:12] could be successful you could get a
[1:20:13] promotion you need to just do this you
[1:20:15] need to do that you need to go to the
[1:20:17] club with the guys you need to go to the
[1:20:19] golf course to get that promotion stand
[1:20:21] where you're at and God will come along
[1:20:23] and give the promotion if you're
[1:20:26] supposed to have the promotion but
[1:20:28] you've got to be placed perfectly in the
[1:20:30] right place that the oil will flow or
[1:20:33] the Candlestick will start to sputter
[1:20:37] and soon go out
[1:20:40] and no man would say I'm going to get up
[1:20:42] today like Aiken he did not get up that
[1:20:45] morning and say I think today I'll just
[1:20:47] destroy my family
[1:20:50] but what happened
[1:20:52] he had quit feeding
[1:20:55] now as an Israelite as a Jew
[1:20:57] he had other things other other a little
[1:21:00] you know if you understand I'm kind of
[1:21:01] struggling to put it to words he was
[1:21:03] called to different guidelines than we
[1:21:05] were
[1:21:07] that I can assure you if God would allow
[1:21:09] us to go back we'll find that he had
[1:21:11] turned all of that just as Israel is
[1:21:13] today into tradition in other words had
[1:21:15] no emotion come brought his lamb brought
[1:21:19] his turtle dove
[1:21:21] I just have to do this
[1:21:24] there you go
[1:21:27] nothing changed
[1:21:28] no fire was lit
[1:21:31] no burning in his soul to say you know
[1:21:33] what I want to do this for the Lord
[1:21:36] I'm afraid that spirit's Not Dead
[1:21:39] I'm afraid that that spirit is still
[1:21:41] hanging around
[1:21:43] and if we're not careful we come to
[1:21:44] church because our family comes to
[1:21:46] church but I say Lord help us that we
[1:21:49] come to church because there's a fire
[1:21:51] burning and we're like I'm going to get
[1:21:54] a refilling tonight I don't care how
[1:21:56] much brother Paul stumbles and the
[1:21:58] reason I'm stumbling Saints if you don't
[1:22:00] understand I'm trying to preach three
[1:22:01] sermons to you and do it within a
[1:22:04] reasonable time here
[1:22:05] and I'm struggling at it
[1:22:08] but it's uh nope brother Paul can
[1:22:10] stumble spit stutter all he wants I'm
[1:22:13] going to get filled tonight I'm gonna
[1:22:15] refilling I'm gonna walk out of here
[1:22:17] once again still on fire for God and I'm
[1:22:20] not worried about running out of oil
[1:22:22] there's an endless supply no man can
[1:22:25] stop it no supply chain can stop it the
[1:22:28] devil can't stop it amen and even
[1:22:31] sometimes our own flesh can't stop it
[1:22:34] hallelujah amen
[1:22:37] oh Hallelujah
[1:22:39] but the outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:41] must be a natural outpouring
[1:22:44] my brother and sister we need to be real
[1:22:46] careful
[1:22:47] that we don't Embrace an outpouring
[1:22:49] that's actually
[1:22:50] an emotional outpouring
[1:22:53] not to say we need to be dead oh I saw
[1:22:55] him lift two feet I saw him do this I
[1:22:58] saw him kind of do a little oh he's out
[1:23:01] of control
[1:23:02] no no no come on
[1:23:04] it's got to be some life
[1:23:06] but my brother and sister we don't need
[1:23:08] to try and imitate it it needs to be a
[1:23:11] natural
[1:23:12] outpouring of the holy spirit in our
[1:23:15] life and when it's out uh natural
[1:23:17] outpouring we'll see that it will you
[1:23:19] know Mr critic sitting over here in the
[1:23:21] corner of the church well they're sure
[1:23:23] getting carried away I need to find some
[1:23:25] scripture and I've got my Cod book two
[1:23:28] I'm gonna just see where they're wrong
[1:23:30] and after a while he stops and says I
[1:23:33] I can't find
[1:23:35] why because it's a natural outpouring
[1:23:38] not a man-made emotional outpouring
[1:23:40] it'll fit to the guidelines we'll still
[1:23:43] be holy we'll still be righteous we'll
[1:23:44] still look like Christians in this
[1:23:47] outpouring
[1:23:48] amen
[1:23:49] now look
[1:23:52] I'm going to close here real quick
[1:23:55] I don't believe you can have the Holy
[1:23:57] Ghost without revelation
[1:24:01] did I say that correct
[1:24:04] or did I say it backwards
[1:24:07] you can't have true revelation
[1:24:10] without the Holy Ghost
[1:24:15] there it is see no matter what position
[1:24:17] oh did I tell you guys we're the bride
[1:24:22] did I did I remember to mention that
[1:24:23] tonight that we're the Bride of Jesus
[1:24:25] Christ
[1:24:26] and did I did I remember to mention to
[1:24:29] you that the word says you can't be lost
[1:24:34] and I don't remember I meant to remind
[1:24:36] you
[1:24:37] that there is not a single sin imputed
[1:24:42] to you
[1:24:46] and my last that I wanted to remind you
[1:24:50] did you remember that he said he said
[1:24:55] not us he said
[1:24:57] this work I have begun in you
[1:25:00] I will finish
[1:25:05] now we wonder what are we worrying about
[1:25:08] what do we get troubled about what do we
[1:25:11] have the devil you know sitting on the
[1:25:13] windowsill like a woodpecker
[1:25:18] listen to me
[1:25:21] Sorry Devil
[1:25:23] I'm
[1:25:24] on fire
[1:25:27] and my vision has cleared up and I can
[1:25:30] look with clarity
[1:25:31] and I recognize everything that brother
[1:25:34] Paul just said is what wasn't brother
[1:25:36] Paul
[1:25:38] it was the word
[1:25:40] and the prophet of God said it's the
[1:25:42] word
[1:25:43] coming to the word
[1:25:45] what a position I can stand here you can
[1:25:48] stand here tonight I am the word of God
[1:25:52] manifest on the flesh today and I'm just
[1:25:56] going to go ahead and be a plagiarist
[1:25:57] where down there went to church with
[1:25:59] brother Ron evening night Tabernacle and
[1:26:01] brother Ron was talking about preaching
[1:26:03] uh on uh God in morphe and he brings
[1:26:07] this all down Through the Ages God and
[1:26:09] morphe changing his mouth changing his
[1:26:11] mask and he comes down in here God comes
[1:26:14] down and no wonder people thought
[1:26:15] brother Branham was Jesus Christ because
[1:26:18] it was God in the prophet and it so was
[1:26:21] so powerful and so clear and so
[1:26:24] beautiful and it was there and as
[1:26:26] brother Ron said himself and I would
[1:26:28] reiterate because that's where I stand
[1:26:30] nothing against brother Branham but even
[1:26:32] beyond the prophet of God God went one
[1:26:36] more step in morphe and he come down and
[1:26:39] he's dwelling in flesh again
[1:26:43] oh that is not us my brother and sister
[1:26:45] that was God who chose to come down and
[1:26:49] in more faith put a mask on that happens
[1:26:51] to look just like you
[1:26:53] oh my how precious how beautiful how
[1:26:56] glorious that is that God would want to
[1:26:59] be uh with us so much that he come right
[1:27:02] down and resident in us now my brother
[1:27:05] and sister if it's God in us amen
[1:27:07] spiritual DNA if it's God in us how can
[1:27:13] that be defeated
[1:27:16] it cannot be will we have our bumps
[1:27:20] we'll have our problems we'll have our
[1:27:22] struggles but God didn't say well I
[1:27:25] guess I picked the wrong one to him
[1:27:27] morphe amen I picked the wrong one to
[1:27:30] put myself into I'll go find one that's
[1:27:33] a little stronger one a little smarter
[1:27:35] one a little whatever no my brother and
[1:27:37] sister he looked at us through eternity
[1:27:40] and told us it's finished already just
[1:27:44] live it out
[1:27:45] you're a part of the play
[1:27:48] oh Hallelujah
[1:27:50] amen
[1:27:53] hey man I'll just move on real quick
[1:27:56] little homework if you would Matthew
[1:27:58] 5 14 to 17.
[1:28:02] my
[1:28:03] if I go really really fast we can do
[1:28:05] this
[1:28:06] ye are the light of the world a city
[1:28:10] that is set on an Hill cannot be hid
[1:28:13] neither do men light a candle and put it
[1:28:15] under a bushel but on a Candlestick it
[1:28:18] giveth lighten to all that are in the
[1:28:20] house let your light so shine before men
[1:28:24] that they may see your good works oh
[1:28:27] well we have some works here amen
[1:28:29] everybody that's like no no it's all
[1:28:30] Grace it's all Grace we have no Works my
[1:28:32] Bible says that they will see your good
[1:28:35] works in other words you're going to be
[1:28:37] a Christian in the grocery store in the
[1:28:39] workplace it's a city park you're going
[1:28:41] to be a Christian wherever you're at it
[1:28:43] ain't that we're going to be out there
[1:28:44] saying I'm a Christian and I did this we
[1:28:47] will just be living our light will just
[1:28:51] be shining we won't need a billboard to
[1:28:54] say there's a light
[1:28:57] hmm
[1:28:58] although
[1:29:00] unless I sound contradictory I'm going
[1:29:01] to read this quote real quick bear with
[1:29:03] me Saints let your light so shine before
[1:29:06] men that they may see your good works
[1:29:08] and glorify your father which is in
[1:29:10] heaven think not that I am come to
[1:29:12] destroy the law or the prophets I am not
[1:29:15] come to destroy but to fulfill
[1:29:18] oh look at it he just chose us he chose
[1:29:22] us as a point as brother Brown talks
[1:29:24] about that with Oral Roberts I believe
[1:29:26] it was a point of contact
[1:29:28] that's what we are walking around the
[1:29:31] oil is pouring in amen and we are lit up
[1:29:35] for Jesus Christ we become a point of
[1:29:37] contact Lord I ask you just help us Lord
[1:29:40] to be a better light
[1:29:42] now let your lights so shine before men
[1:29:46] amen let's just go through this real
[1:29:48] quick
[1:29:50] you know I don't know the definition of
[1:29:52] the word quick but we will try
[1:29:56] so I believe that the Christian is God's
[1:29:59] billboard I believe that each one of us
[1:30:01] is God's billboard and we don't have to
[1:30:04] do so much carrying on about it as we do
[1:30:07] just simply live such a life that'll
[1:30:11] make the people hungry to be like you
[1:30:14] amen
[1:30:15] I tell you what speaking of carrying on
[1:30:17] brings back a memory from years ago I
[1:30:20] worked with a man named Larry I think
[1:30:22] sister Jerry even met the guy the best
[1:30:24] finished Carpenter I've ever worked well
[1:30:26] or new or whatever in life the man was
[1:30:29] just absolutely phenomenal
[1:30:31] I'm working on a house one day I was
[1:30:34] not in the best position you might say
[1:30:36] in my life just kind of struggling to
[1:30:38] seem like I always had some little
[1:30:40] besetting thing that just was bothering
[1:30:42] me and and I'm working on a house one
[1:30:45] day and he comes up and he says
[1:30:47] you're a Christian aren't you
[1:30:50] now I hadn't done anything you know
[1:30:53] played Christian music I didn't actually
[1:30:55] listen to music on the job I'd done
[1:30:58] anything but he just walks up you're
[1:31:00] Christian aren't you now God ordained
[1:31:02] this as a lesson for Paul
[1:31:05] he says you're a Christian aren't you
[1:31:07] and I was working in a closet on
[1:31:09] baseboard
[1:31:11] and uh prepping it to paint it
[1:31:14] and I looked up at him and I said I'm
[1:31:16] trying to be
[1:31:17] and here's a guy I didn't even know got
[1:31:19] right in my face God don't have no such
[1:31:21] thing as trying you either are or you
[1:31:24] aren't
[1:31:26] and like who are you
[1:31:30] but I couldn't get over that
[1:31:32] it actually was a little key that
[1:31:34] unlocked something for me because I was
[1:31:36] just trying I was trying but I was
[1:31:39] locked into my own mentality that I'm
[1:31:41] trying and somewhere in that mentality
[1:31:43] was a deal that you're defeated you
[1:31:45] can't do it
[1:31:46] I'm trying but oh Larry he drove that
[1:31:49] right out of me every time I'd see him
[1:31:50] man he was always like still trying
[1:31:53] oh shut up
[1:31:56] but it caused me to have a different
[1:31:57] approach huh
[1:32:06] just simply live such a life that'll
[1:32:08] make people hungry to be like you now if
[1:32:10] you guys want to read a very interesting
[1:32:12] stuff you probably already had but you
[1:32:14] go further up in this let your light so
[1:32:16] shine before man brother Brown's talking
[1:32:17] about a billboard
[1:32:18] that's where it all starts a billboard
[1:32:21] I noticed this billboard this certain
[1:32:23] one it didn't claim it ain't nothing
[1:32:25] just ask the question if you're hungry
[1:32:28] and you cannot sell anybody anything to
[1:32:32] eat unless they're hungry and the first
[1:32:35] thing that the advertisement does the
[1:32:37] individual passing by has to see it
[1:32:40] now the only way that the world will
[1:32:42] ever see Christ is when he they see it
[1:32:46] in you and me
[1:32:48] oh Lord I want to be a billboard
[1:32:51] I want to be a billboard help me Lord
[1:32:55] see you in you and me and that's the
[1:32:57] only way they'll ever see Christ
[1:33:01] they're conscious go ahead and click
[1:33:03] that for the Gideon their conscience are
[1:33:06] numb
[1:33:07] to the sunsets to the call of the birds
[1:33:10] to the leaves the grass the flowers the
[1:33:12] music
[1:33:13] and the message
[1:33:15] and so forth that we enjoy after we have
[1:33:18] found Christ Can someone say Amen to
[1:33:20] that
[1:33:20] there's no better view than to look at
[1:33:24] the world today and know that this this
[1:33:28] beautiful the most beautiful things
[1:33:29] Sister Sarah sorry to use you for an
[1:33:31] example but not really so Sister Sarah
[1:33:33] you know in her hike she takes some
[1:33:35] pictures of just these gorgeous Mountain
[1:33:37] Lakes now can you imagine when this has
[1:33:40] been burnt over
[1:33:41] and it's back to the pristine
[1:33:44] of God's creation
[1:33:47] everything we've ever looked at
[1:33:50] will be just that much more beautiful
[1:33:55] without any form
[1:33:57] reminds me a friend of mine Dura hunt
[1:33:59] out in a really rough part of Idaho
[1:34:02] Sawtooth deals up there hunting a goat
[1:34:05] and he sat down
[1:34:08] he was so into telling me about it that
[1:34:10] he he was demonstrative and he sat down
[1:34:13] he said and I had my hands behind my
[1:34:15] head and I'm just looking out through
[1:34:17] this just beautiful beautiful Canyon and
[1:34:22] he said at that moment I didn't care if
[1:34:23] I hunted a goat or not I was just
[1:34:25] enjoying the absolute beauty of this he
[1:34:28] said man I am probably sitting in a
[1:34:31] place that no man has ever walked and
[1:34:35] his heart just thrilled in him he's out
[1:34:37] there singing How Great Thou Art
[1:34:40] and he goes to put his pack on and he
[1:34:43] steps out and he turns around to grab
[1:34:44] his pack
[1:34:45] and he said I don't know why I didn't
[1:34:47] see it before but there was a crushed
[1:34:49] Coca-Cola can
[1:34:51] and he said my whole feeling of euphoria
[1:34:54] just went
[1:34:57] no man's ever been here
[1:35:00] yeah but imagine
[1:35:02] what it'll be
[1:35:04] When We Get Over Yonder
[1:35:06] how beautiful how glorious it will be
[1:35:10] amen
[1:35:12] the message that we enjoy after we found
[1:35:14] Christ until we get to a place that we
[1:35:16] display Christ now remember that each
[1:35:19] one of you from tonight on remember you
[1:35:22] are God's Billboards and your God's
[1:35:26] advertising agent
[1:35:28] wow we have a business Arrangement here
[1:35:31] and those of us that are a little
[1:35:32] business-minded that gives me a new
[1:35:34] challenge to press forward amen I I got
[1:35:36] to get this billboard good I mean I
[1:35:39] don't want a billboard that you drive by
[1:35:41] on the highway and you can't read it
[1:35:43] because part of the Billboard's flapping
[1:35:45] in the Wind
[1:35:46] everybody just yeah no I I'm gonna be
[1:35:50] I'm going to be a billboard
[1:35:52] and now the world will look at you and
[1:35:54] see what Christ is so we don't want to
[1:35:57] smear a big lot of stuff on there
[1:35:59] that'll testify about things that we
[1:36:01] really are not let's first be that then
[1:36:04] when we be that then the world will see
[1:36:06] Christ in you and me Amen brother Alex

[1:37:27] of giving what's left of your time to
[1:37:29] family or left of your time to God left
[1:37:32] of your time
[1:37:36] and the devil natural life career
[1:37:40] it's the prime time
[1:37:43] Satan's pretty slippery
[1:37:46] and I'll just admit to you Saints it's
[1:37:48] been a battle I have fought for years
[1:37:50] and years and years
[1:37:54] now I say there's something special
[1:37:56] about sitting on a ditch bank and a
[1:37:58] pickup reading your Bible
[1:38:01] but how much more pressure it would be
[1:38:02] that I didn't have to squeeze that into
[1:38:06] my life
[1:38:07] that it was just time I give
[1:38:11] that's my prayer I believe that's where
[1:38:12] the Lord is taking me
[1:38:14] we're moving that direction but it's
[1:38:18] been too long coming and I apologize to
[1:38:20] you and certainly repent to the Lord but
[1:38:23] you see God's not going to let us as the
[1:38:26] bride of Christ show up
[1:38:29] with no oil
[1:38:31] amen he's guaranteeing
[1:38:34] he said I've already made it you will
[1:38:38] have oil
[1:38:39] but his way of giving us the oil
[1:38:44] translates into sacrifice on our part
[1:38:49] Lord let me be willing let me be willing
[1:38:51] to sacrifice let me be willing oh spear
[1:38:57] read of the Living God
[1:39:05] fall fresh

[1:41:36] [Music]
[1:41:40] though if he leads me tears enough
[1:41:46] I want God's way to be my way
[1:41:52] every
[1:41:54] day Hallelujah
[1:41:58] Hallelujah so we'd be dismissed on this
[1:42:01] song here just a little reminder I love
[1:42:04] this song The Name Of The Lord
[1:42:07] it's a strong tower
[1:42:09] amen imagine
[1:42:12] you're in the middle of your work day

[1:42:19] and you just stop and say Lord I need
[1:42:22] you to come on the scene
[1:42:24] and suddenly you can hear
[1:42:27] in the Supernatural the blocks the rocks
[1:42:30] being placed
[1:42:32] [Music]
[1:42:34] and the prophet of God said now you
[1:42:37] can't stop that bird
[1:42:39] from flying over but you can stop him
[1:42:43] from building the nest
[1:42:46] and we're inside that Strong Tower and
[1:42:48] the rocks are being put in place and we
[1:42:50] turn our thoughts what our problem is
[1:42:53] and we start to say Thank You Lord thank
[1:42:56] you Lord you are my strong tower you are
[1:42:59] my refuge You Are My Strength you are my
[1:43:02] provider and suddenly those thoughts
[1:43:04] that troubled us
[1:43:05] not just stirred up
[1:43:09] are you with me they got stirred up and
[1:43:13] then they got
[1:43:14] washed away flushed right out and what
[1:43:18] was left
[1:43:19] pure olive oil and that pure olive oil
[1:43:23] started flowing and 15 minutes later
[1:43:26] you'll find yourself oh thank you Lord
[1:43:29] for saving my soul and Satan's over
[1:43:33] there saying I'll get him next time
[1:43:36] but I'll tell you what God's doing since
[1:43:38] he's training us that next time we'll
[1:43:40] have even more confidence and we won't
[1:43:43] wait quite so long to say Lord I need
