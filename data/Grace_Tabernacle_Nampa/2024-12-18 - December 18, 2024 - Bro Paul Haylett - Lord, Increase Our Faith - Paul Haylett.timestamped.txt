[45:48] married and um another addition to the
[45:52] family what a family before it's all
[45:54] over you're going to have so many
[45:55] grandchildren you'll have to have a list
[45:59] amen let's turn in our Bibles I want to
[46:03] speak to you tonight on a topic Lord
[46:06] increase our faith amen not a deep
[46:10] subject but something I believe that we
[46:13] need a reminder of that um you know the
[46:18] the times in our life we we sometimes
[46:21] maybe misunderstand right the prophet of
[46:23] God said everything you need for the
[46:26] rapture I'm paraphrasing this is already
[46:29] in you so we don't need to go looking
[46:31] for Faith but we need to have that
[46:34] ingredient that lets the faith that God
[46:36] placed in US be set free Amen to be able
[46:40] to to take a Holtz of that in our time
[46:43] of need you know we cannot premeditate
[46:47] faith we cannot say I'm going to go out
[46:49] tomorrow and get more faith but God has
[46:53] a way of working in you and I to
[46:56] increase our our faith let's turn in
[46:58] Luke the 17th chapter verses 5 and 6 and
[47:01] then we'll jump to verses 20-
[47:05] 24 and the apostles see I I find this
[47:09] just a beautiful thing because my
[47:11] brother and sister the apostles when
[47:13] Jesus chose the apostles he went and
[47:16] found all the perfect men right no he
[47:19] found people just like you and
[47:21] I and so they still had some doubts some
[47:25] fears some questions of their ability
[47:28] and who they were uh you know as brother
[47:31] Branham says you know they say that the
[47:33] the church was built on Peter brother
[47:36] brandham puts it fairly bluntly when he
[47:38] says why would god build a church on
[47:40] such an unstable man and so we look at
[47:43] this and the Paradox of that the
[47:46] revelation of that is actually we need
[47:49] to look no further than our own lives
[47:52] cuz this is God's Church he's building
[47:54] it on you and I and let's be honest
[47:57] there's times we're unstable but God
[48:00] says don't worry I know how to stabilize
[48:04] you amen aren't you glad of that this
[48:06] evening amen verse Luke 17 5-6 and the
[48:11] apostles said unto the
[48:13] Lord increase our faith and the Lord
[48:16] said if you had Faith as a grain of
[48:19] mustard seed you might say unto this uh
[48:22] sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the
[48:25] root and be thou planted in the sea and
[48:28] it should obey you let's move to verse
[48:32] 20 and when he was demanded of the
[48:36] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[48:38] come he answered them and said the
[48:41] kingdom of God cometh not with
[48:44] observation so we are not going to be
[48:47] out here looking around saying oh there
[48:50] it comes there it is here it is right
[48:53] here not with observation
[48:58] neither shall they say Lo here or loow
[49:00] there for behold the kingdom of God is
[49:04] within you now I don't want to get
[49:06] sidetracked here tonight but do you
[49:08] realize that is the seventh seal
[49:12] manifested in you that is the word
[49:15] opened and come to life in you today
[49:19] that we can sit here today and say it is
[49:22] Christ in US amen Christ in you amen
[49:26] amen Revelation or the revealing of the
[49:30] seventh seal it's not a Doctrine my
[49:33] brother and sister it's a relationship
[49:35] it is something that God is revealing to
[49:38] you and I most any person can use the
[49:41] word I'm a
[49:42] Christian but to a real believer he
[49:46] knows that he has that touch or that
[49:49] that gift from God the real believer
[49:52] stands here today the devil will throw
[49:55] darts at you but the real believer in
[49:57] his heart knows that he is a Son of God
[50:00] a daughter of God knows that he has a
[50:04] new
[50:04] birth see a new birth is not just words
[50:08] that we speak it's not like almost a
[50:10] doctrine that we express you have to
[50:12] have a new birth but that's God coming
[50:14] down and revealing himself in us and
[50:19] when that Revelation comes it gives us a
[50:23] a a keeping power a staying power to be
[50:26] able to survive in the most wicked age
[50:30] ever
[50:31] amen
[50:33] when brother brandom preached and said
[50:36] as the God of this evil age those
[50:38] weren't just
[50:39] words he is the God of this evil age but
[50:44] he's not our God cuz this is not our
[50:47] world Amen thank you Lord hallelujah and
[50:51] he said unto the disciples the days will
[50:53] come when you shall desire to see one of
[50:55] the days of the son of man and you shall
[50:57] not see it and they shall say to you see
[51:01] here or see there go not after them nor
[51:05] follow them for as a lightning that
[51:07] lighten out of one part under Heaven
[51:10] shineth into the other part under heaven
[51:13] so shall it also the son of man be in
[51:16] his day the word shining from Nation to
[51:22] Nation continent
[51:24] continent believer to believer Heavenly
[51:28] Father how we thank you
[51:30] tonight Lord that you would come and
[51:33] father in the hour we live in I I know
[51:36] I've been challenged myself many times
[51:39] Lord I need more faith help me Lord but
[51:43] we must recognize father that we cannot
[51:45] manufacture Faith
[51:47] ourself but Lord you reveal Faith to us
[51:51] and and we as the bride of Christ Sons
[51:53] and Daughters of God we are sitting here
[51:56] to today absolutely helpless father as
[51:59] just a newborn baby father we cannot do
[52:03] anything for ourself father we cannot
[52:06] change our position we cannot change our
[52:08] life but Lord we're totally Reliant and
[52:11] Lord let us come as our lord Jesus said
[52:13] Let It Be unto babes father let us come
[52:16] as babes tonight father fully Lord
[52:19] counting trusting you to move in our
[52:22] lives and reveal father in your power
[52:25] your majesty
[52:27] in the precious name of Jesus Christ we
[52:29] ask this amen you may be seated so as we
[52:33] we put this I just want to reiterate
[52:35] here uh sometimes we've made the seventh
[52:38] seal such a deep topic that no one
[52:41] understands it it can be preached in so
[52:43] many different Fashions and I'm not
[52:46] throwing brother Eugene under the bus
[52:48] but I I just in my my short time there
[52:51] with brother Eugene we would be talking
[52:53] and he would turn to me and he would say
[52:55] brother Paul that's the seventh seal
[52:57] Made Alive and you know is it God it's
[53:00] kind of contagious when you realize that
[53:03] we've made it such a big doctrine that
[53:05] it's got to have all kinds of great
[53:07] majesty and you know as it were
[53:09] lightning in the sky and the sound of
[53:12] thunder and everything and yet you and I
[53:14] living in this day right now overcoming
[53:18] power in this day is the seventh seal
[53:21] manifested now brother brandham uses the
[53:24] words and I just read them this
[53:26] afternoon noon you know that the seventh
[53:28] seal is the coming of Christ I want to
[53:30] ask you is he here amen he is here my
[53:33] brother and sister we're not looking uh
[53:36] at that because you see we'll never see
[53:38] that coming if we don't see this
[53:42] coming and so it's there many are
[53:45] looking off into the far future for for
[53:48] that to be manifested but a Brides
[53:51] already in relationship with the Lord
[53:54] Jesus Christ amen we're not waiting
[53:56] waiting to come into a relationship it's
[53:59] there very much like man and wife uh in
[54:02] the natural my brother and sister you
[54:04] don't wait for the day that you're
[54:06] saying the marriage vow to have a
[54:08] relationship your relationship is
[54:11] already being uh set in stone as it were
[54:14] it's already got a foundation it's
[54:16] already moving forward and you know in
[54:18] the natural we can say I know this is
[54:21] the girl I know this is the man that God
[54:23] has for me amen you don't wait till you
[54:25] standing up here and go you know I I
[54:27] better settle this question and no more
[54:30] that we should wait amen till the other
[54:33] signs you might say of the age or coming
[54:36] to decide whether or not he's our
[54:38] bridegroom or not we have settled that
[54:41] question already amen it should be
[54:43] settled today and so we would say you
[54:47] know uh uh in this day and I I don't
[54:49] know about you I'm trying to break the
[54:51] habit of implying but my brother and
[54:53] sister have you ever come to the place
[54:55] you've said those words Lord increase my
[54:57] faith Lord I need more Faith Lord help
[55:00] my faith amen so these are these are
[55:02] things that Satan has come it's not God
[55:05] coming to you and saying you don't have
[55:08] enough Faith cuz he knows how much faith
[55:10] is in you but it's the devil coming
[55:12] trying to come and and G you get you to
[55:15] doubt to to stop just short of the
[55:17] promise because you're not sure you
[55:19] actually can fulfill the promise but it
[55:21] was never you fulfilling the promise in
[55:23] the beginning it's always been him and
[55:26] it's only him amen the prophet of God
[55:29] said your faith he's speaking himself
[55:32] your faith and my faith with his faith
[55:35] amen will finish the work but as it goes
[55:38] I'm don't have the words perfect But as
[55:40] time goes on your faith and my faith
[55:43] will fade and it will only be his faith
[55:46] amen I should have put that quote in
[55:48] here because it was good it stirred my
[55:50] heart my brother and sister when it
[55:51] comes down to it we have faith and we as
[55:54] Sons and Daughters of God should
[55:55] Proclaim that we have faith it should be
[55:57] part of our testimony but the faith
[56:00] that's going to get us in a Rapture is
[56:01] his faith amen man has all kinds of
[56:05] faith I want you to think about this for
[56:06] just a moment what we were preaching the
[56:08] other day astronaut age my brother and
[56:11] sister imagine uh mankind what kind of
[56:14] confidence they must have in science and
[56:17] in man's ability to build to climb in a
[56:20] capsule and allow it to propel them out
[56:23] in the atmosphere now some say they
[56:25] never really went to the moon they never
[56:27] went here they never went there I don't
[56:29] really care we did watch the machine
[56:31] blast off into outer space so however
[56:33] far they went it takes a special kind of
[56:35] confidence to be able to trust that
[56:37] machine and God wants you and I in a
[56:40] spiritual realm to have that kind of
[56:42] confidence become spiritual astronauts
[56:44] that he by faith can blast us right into
[56:47] the heavenlies amen but if we're not
[56:49] able to grasp that Faith then we will
[56:52] always try to keep ourselves so to speak
[56:54] Earthbound we'll never really want to
[56:56] get too carried away I find it
[56:58] interesting that we see all of these
[57:00] extremes now don't I'm not taking a
[57:02] position don't misunderstand just trying
[57:04] to make a point that we have Extremes in
[57:06] the message now that we're kind of
[57:08] almost going back to an Apostolic
[57:10] Pentecostal type thing with a lot of
[57:12] speaking in tongues and a lot of these
[57:14] things that happen and then we've got
[57:16] this side over here that if you sit in
[57:18] church with him you freeze to
[57:20] death God called for us to be in the
[57:23] middle of all of this the prophet of God
[57:25] said you know
[57:27] be a direct quote you want to look it up
[57:28] he says you know the time of speaking in
[57:30] tongues is
[57:31] over because we've went beyond that not
[57:36] because it was wrong but we went beyond
[57:39] that that's not our sign that's
[57:41] Pentecost sign of that God is present
[57:43] just speak in tongues you got to speak
[57:45] in tongues but God said I've taken you
[57:48] be beyond that into another realm that
[57:51] we can sit here with confidence tonight
[57:54] and know that we are Sons and Daughters
[57:55] of God
[57:56] and he is present with us amen but we
[58:00] would say sometimes I've done it many
[58:02] times myself Lord I need more faith but
[58:04] if we're not careful we get a view that
[58:07] this is almost like a school book lesson
[58:10] and and we'll we'll be like I can study
[58:12] this and then I'll pass the test my
[58:15] brother and sister this is something
[58:17] that is revelation right the prophet of
[58:19] God said faith is a revelation to you
[58:22] and so it's not schoolbook study but yet
[58:25] God expects us to apply ourselves isn't
[58:28] that interesting a lot of difference
[58:29] between having a Works gospel and doing
[58:32] the
[58:33] work amen God wants to see his word
[58:36] working in you and I he doesn't want it
[58:39] to be just a blank page that we study
[58:42] not a blank page but just a a dead
[58:44] letter to study and say okay yeah we've
[58:46] got faith my brother and sister he wants
[58:48] Faith to be manifested in us but he
[58:50] doesn't want us to come to the place
[58:52] that because we did something by faith
[58:54] that we think it's settled amen isn't
[58:56] that interesting and then the prophet of
[58:58] God prophet of God comes and just
[59:00] settles it right down the middle and
[59:02] says here's the balance aren't you glad
[59:05] my brother and sister this message and
[59:08] and don't misunderstand me tonight I I
[59:10] don't know a better way to to say this
[59:12] this message is not all about a
[59:14] prophet amen we needed that Prophet amen
[59:18] and he's come and he did the work that
[59:21] God called him to do and now God has
[59:23] revealed the word In You and I and now
[59:26] we are coming to fruition and we are
[59:30] that living epistle on the Earth today
[59:33] amen aren't you glad I thank God for
[59:35] that I don't need to say now I got to
[59:38] have a a a little deal plus the prophet
[59:40] my brother and sister we have the
[59:41] prophets Words which are God's words we
[59:44] believe that don't we that the prophet's
[59:46] words are God's words amen so we have
[59:49] the word for the day and God's laid it
[59:51] all out before us I've said it before
[59:54] pardon me for saying it again but
[59:55] imagine IM what the message would be
[59:57] like if the prophet was still
[59:59] here we'd never get down on our own
[1:00:01] knees and pray through we would never be
[1:00:04] in desperation he would have a waiting
[1:00:06] list of of people to interview that
[1:00:09] would be so long it would be impossible
[1:00:12] to fulfill but God said I gave you the
[1:00:14] word I gave you even beyond that the
[1:00:16] technology to uh uh search and find
[1:00:19] every word yeah amen now take that word
[1:00:23] and run amen take that word word and
[1:00:26] fulfill my word for the day because I
[1:00:29] have given it to you good
[1:00:32] directions amen here some time
[1:00:35] back had a little cabinet thing I was
[1:00:37] putting together out in the
[1:00:39] garage I don't know who wrote those
[1:00:44] directions but it said follow this to
[1:00:49] insert screw F into whole marked
[1:00:54] X and and all the lines were like this
[1:00:57] on the and it's
[1:00:59] like that can't be
[1:01:02] right but the gospel is not such to
[1:01:05] those who have eyes and ears but the
[1:01:09] rest of the world it's a very conf uh
[1:01:11] confusing uh thing that that we can't
[1:01:13] follow this through but look at this my
[1:01:15] brother and sister I'm a little off
[1:01:16] track here forgive me but but look at
[1:01:18] this day that we're living in that the
[1:01:21] godhead is so
[1:01:24] clear so clear
[1:01:27] clear to
[1:01:32] you but not to Dr Leighton
[1:01:36] flowers it's not clear to
[1:01:39] him in fact he makes it so complicated
[1:01:42] that people even comment on his his uh
[1:01:46] deal saying this doesn't make
[1:01:50] sense and I'm not speaking down on the
[1:01:52] man but you see that's what Satan wants
[1:01:54] it to be he wants the word to be so
[1:01:56] complicated that Believers just have to
[1:01:59] blindly
[1:02:01] follow but the word
[1:02:03] says I will lead you and guide you so we
[1:02:06] should be able to reach out and touch
[1:02:08] our lord Jesus and find the right path
[1:02:11] we don't have to use LLC whatever this
[1:02:14] that and the others to do this we don't
[1:02:15] need to know exactly h h a little study
[1:02:19] I was doing the other day a man uh I
[1:02:21] kind of visited this before and just
[1:02:23] kind of hit on it again and man says
[1:02:25] until we know all the languages the
[1:02:26] Bible was spoken we won't understand it
[1:02:29] well I tell you what my brother and
[1:02:31] sister the prophet of God left a little
[1:02:33] nugget in the message for you and I when
[1:02:36] he says I don't know that very well you
[1:02:38] know the English and all of that but I
[1:02:40] know the
[1:02:42] author I don't have to figure out the
[1:02:44] answer for myself the author is going to
[1:02:47] tell me what he wanted to tell me and
[1:02:50] when the author tells you what's in the
[1:02:52] book my brother and sister it won't
[1:02:55] matter language it won't matter wherever
[1:02:57] it won't matter
[1:02:58] education amen it's
[1:03:02] Revelation Hallelujah that God brings
[1:03:04] that and lays it out so clearly before
[1:03:06] us so this is not a schoolbook
[1:03:10] lesson Romans 10:7 says so then Faith
[1:03:13] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:03:15] word of God and I believe every one of
[1:03:17] us here tonight can say thank you Lord
[1:03:19] and amen to that because we have heard
[1:03:23] and understood and it had nothing to do
[1:03:26] with
[1:03:27] IQ and I'm not speaking down on myself
[1:03:29] but I'm really glad that it
[1:03:31] doesn't because if it was Boy some of us
[1:03:34] would just be are hurt no I won't say
[1:03:36] some of you I would be really hurting I
[1:03:40] don't want to to be misunderstood so you
[1:03:42] see this hearing is not of the natural
[1:03:45] ear this hearing is actually we're
[1:03:48] hearing it in our soul we're hearing it
[1:03:50] in our heart the word is speaking to us
[1:03:53] it resonates and we know that it's true
[1:03:57] truth don't we need an element of Truth
[1:04:00] to have
[1:04:02] faith you can't have faith in something
[1:04:05] you know is
[1:04:08] false so you see long before we were
[1:04:11] able to actually say this message is
[1:04:13] true God was already working in you
[1:04:17] might be before you ever sat down on a
[1:04:19] church pew or uh maybe owned or opened a
[1:04:22] Bible whatever the circumstance might be
[1:04:24] God was already working on us to build
[1:04:27] the foundation for Faith to be
[1:04:30] expressed now if you don't think that
[1:04:32] means something my brother and sister I
[1:04:34] want you to go back through your own
[1:04:36] life for a while and think about where
[1:04:38] you was at and where you were headed and
[1:04:40] that when you heard the truth there was
[1:04:42] something in you that said I can believe
[1:04:44] that something in you said I can trust
[1:04:46] that something in you said I can follow
[1:04:49] that amen that was God already planting
[1:04:52] a seed amen and he brought it to
[1:04:54] fruition and when you heard you didn't
[1:04:56] hear with your ears you heard with your
[1:04:59] soul and you knew this was true now in
[1:05:03] the sermon things that are to be uh
[1:05:06] brother brandham uh preaches this this
[1:05:09] right here at the end of his ministry no
[1:05:11] one knew at the time that they were in
[1:05:13] there and he was speaking these words
[1:05:16] that it was just a little short matter
[1:05:17] of time and he would be gone from the
[1:05:19] scene and so is it is he says Jesus
[1:05:24] Christ is by
[1:05:26] faith not what you can scientifically
[1:05:29] prove but what you
[1:05:32] believe so faith is entirely a
[1:05:36] belief are you with
[1:05:38] me I hope you make the connection back
[1:05:41] to what we had already said but what you
[1:05:43] believe I can't scientifically prove you
[1:05:46] tonight in this building that there is a
[1:05:49] God but yet I know he's here and I want
[1:05:52] to say that this applies tonight amen we
[1:05:55] know he he is here amen but by my faith
[1:05:59] vindicates it now I love that when
[1:06:02] people you know approach the prophet and
[1:06:04] they said well I don't believe that
[1:06:06] brother brandham and brother brandham
[1:06:07] comes back some people in this very
[1:06:10] emotionally conscious day that we live
[1:06:12] in would have been mortally offended
[1:06:14] when brother brandham said well it's not
[1:06:15] for you it's only for
[1:06:18] believers they they would have they
[1:06:19] would have just this day and age they
[1:06:21] would melt down on the
[1:06:23] spot I'm a Believer have you to know
[1:06:26] I've been this that and the other my
[1:06:27] family has for a hundred years what's it
[1:06:31] got to do with it hospital room the
[1:06:33] prophet speaks to the lady and she says
[1:06:36] I'll have you to know see my brother and
[1:06:39] sister no connection see they're not
[1:06:42] hearing it right with a soul they're
[1:06:44] hearing it intellectually in a mind and
[1:06:47] it doesn't produce enough respect now
[1:06:49] get this it doesn't produce enough
[1:06:51] respect even in them to honor common
[1:06:54] decency
[1:06:57] right all they're caring about
[1:06:59] themselves you're bothering me with all
[1:07:01] this talk about God and the Holy
[1:07:05] Ghost I can tell you that Spirit hasn't
[1:07:08] died right that spirit's still
[1:07:12] around
[1:07:13] Abraham could not scientifically prove
[1:07:16] to you that he was going to have a baby
[1:07:18] by uh to that woman and he her nearly a
[1:07:22] hundred years old but his faith
[1:07:24] confirmed it see don't need any
[1:07:28] scientific proof see we're living in a
[1:07:31] day my brother and sister that people
[1:07:32] are demanding if I'm going to believe
[1:07:35] this message I need proof well I tell
[1:07:39] you my brother and sister the proof is
[1:07:40] not out there the proof is in here amen
[1:07:44] the proof is in the life that God gives
[1:07:46] to you and I amen so people are looking
[1:07:50] for proof to prove that God is real but
[1:07:53] yet a bride of Christ knows her husband
[1:07:55] is real just as tonight we could those
[1:07:59] of you couples sitting together amen
[1:08:01] could just reach right over touch your
[1:08:03] husband and say I know my husband's real
[1:08:06] don't tell me he's not but you see this
[1:08:08] bride of Christ she knows her bridegroom
[1:08:12] is real doesn't need some scientific
[1:08:15] proof my brother and sister remember
[1:08:17] when the Apollo went up into to uh uh
[1:08:21] space or whatever and you know there was
[1:08:24] such a controversy when one of those uh
[1:08:26] astronauts made something and and later
[1:08:29] he clarified and said that's actually
[1:08:31] not what I said they took what I said
[1:08:33] and they Twisted it but they took the
[1:08:35] words and said that he said that I don't
[1:08:38] see God anywhere and he said I I
[1:08:41] believed in in Jesus Christ I was not
[1:08:44] declaring there was no God here but they
[1:08:47] Twisted the words that he was speaking
[1:08:50] because you see the God that was there
[1:08:53] and the moon and the Apollo Landing
[1:08:56] the same God here was there and the same
[1:08:59] God that was with the prophet is here
[1:09:02] and the same God that spoke to the
[1:09:04] prophet is speaking to you amen but you
[1:09:07] see they want proof that this is taking
[1:09:10] place my brother and sister I tell you
[1:09:13] we all have proof we're not perfect my
[1:09:17] I'd be scared if somebody ever thought I
[1:09:19] was saying I was
[1:09:21] perfect um it it's just not so but a
[1:09:24] perfect God
[1:09:26] has redeemed me amen a perfect God has
[1:09:29] called me a perfect God has healed me
[1:09:32] and a perfect God has revealed himself
[1:09:35] to us see it never was about how perfect
[1:09:38] we was look God coming down now he had a
[1:09:42] plan for the Apostle Paul but look how
[1:09:44] God come here's Apostle Paul on a
[1:09:47] mission you might say he was
[1:09:48] commissioned by the church to go disband
[1:09:52] another group of Christians and so in
[1:09:55] that frame of mind in that kind of
[1:09:57] circumstance why would God ever choose a
[1:09:59] man with murder on his mind but he
[1:10:05] did and then God turned it around and
[1:10:07] showed that this was so real that that
[1:10:09] same man laid his head on the Block and
[1:10:12] they cut his head
[1:10:15] off from the murderer to the
[1:10:19] murdered by
[1:10:22] Revelation now we can type that my
[1:10:24] brother and sister for for the one who
[1:10:26] intellectually understands and believes
[1:10:28] he knows what God wants to the one who
[1:10:30] has died to himself to fulfill what God
[1:10:34] wants let us be the second Amen Let us
[1:10:38] be that
[1:10:41] Hallelujah didn't need scientific proof
[1:10:44] the doctor said the old man is crazy out
[1:10:45] there saying he going to have a baby by
[1:10:47] that woman 100 years old and her 90 but
[1:10:50] you see God said so so it didn't take
[1:10:53] science it takes Faith to believe God's
[1:10:57] word not science now I I'm I don't want
[1:11:00] to focus on that I I I don't want to get
[1:11:02] sidetracked here but I tell you a lot of
[1:11:04] naysayers around the message they're
[1:11:06] coming from a scientific educated
[1:11:10] mindset to say this is
[1:11:12] flawed well I tell you what man's hands
[1:11:17] are
[1:11:18] flawed but God's hands are perfect and
[1:11:22] when God uses man's hands if you look at
[1:11:26] the flaw that's all you'll see but if
[1:11:28] you look at that man as God using his
[1:11:31] hands it will be perfect amen but you'll
[1:11:35] find also that that man that God uses
[1:11:37] his hands his feet amen never boasts
[1:11:41] never says this is mine I did this he
[1:11:45] gives the credit to Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:48] Hallelujah isn't that beautiful amen so
[1:11:52] I want to just interject about this time
[1:11:54] right here
[1:11:57] I'm wondering if we have a true
[1:11:58] Revelation or understanding of what
[1:12:01] faith is
[1:12:08] amen not criticizing no one not trying
[1:12:11] to cut anything down but you see I think
[1:12:15] a lot of people have an understanding
[1:12:18] that faith is you doing
[1:12:22] something and that you're going to know
[1:12:24] you can do that
[1:12:27] something but yet there's scriptural
[1:12:29] foundation for that because the word
[1:12:31] says I can do all
[1:12:34] things by
[1:12:37] myself no that's can do all things
[1:12:42] through Christ
[1:12:45] Jesus see so what's Faith actually kind
[1:12:49] of be trust tied to trust we're
[1:12:52] believing that in Jesus Christ
[1:12:55] in Jesus Christ are you with me in Jesus
[1:12:59] Christ we can do all things we can
[1:13:03] overcome the spirit of leoo which is the
[1:13:06] darkest Spirit of all the ages and every
[1:13:09] deception and every trick is there and
[1:13:12] we know that Jesus said I'll take you
[1:13:15] through the darkest and darkest and
[1:13:18] darkest of time and I will lead you and
[1:13:20] bring you right out of that into a
[1:13:23] Rapture and I will declare are you
[1:13:25] perfect at that place now look if we
[1:13:28] rely on faith as we would look at it in
[1:13:31] a human element we would not even see
[1:13:34] how we could get through this
[1:13:37] age did you catch what I just said we
[1:13:41] wouldn't be able to see how we got
[1:13:44] through this age but you see faith is
[1:13:47] already working in you it didn't come
[1:13:49] with a neon sign it didn't come with a
[1:13:52] great exclamation faith is already
[1:13:54] working in you because we are here
[1:13:56] tonight and I believe I can say this in
[1:13:59] in full confidence we already see the
[1:14:02] end my brother and sister if it wasn't
[1:14:04] for faith in us activated coming to pass
[1:14:08] we wouldn't even be able to see the end
[1:14:11] but we see the end and we are see
[1:14:13] ourselves as Victorious you see the
[1:14:16] faith we keep looking for is already
[1:14:20] working in us it's already present yeah
[1:14:26] Faith does not mean great magnificent
[1:14:29] works that are broadcast and almost
[1:14:31] boasted over faith is the fact we read
[1:14:34] the word and say Amen to it and God
[1:14:36] allows us to take a Hal of that and by
[1:14:39] faith just like Abraham by Faith by
[1:14:42] faith we take a hold of that word that
[1:14:44] we read or heard and we step forward and
[1:14:46] it changes Our Lives my brother and
[1:14:49] sister Faith's already moving in the
[1:14:51] bride Faith's already causing her to
[1:14:53] come to a place that she realizes she's
[1:14:56] not of this Earth that she is of the
[1:14:58] word she is the word amen she's not just
[1:15:01] got a name out here she is Mrs Jesus
[1:15:05] Christ she's claiming her
[1:15:07] position by faith amen that's right CU
[1:15:11] do you have one physical
[1:15:15] evidence that you're the bride of
[1:15:22] Christ but who are we
[1:15:26] Faith working in US is showing us who we
[1:15:31] are not us by intellect understanding
[1:15:35] reasoning studying but it's by faith we
[1:15:38] read the word and something inside of us
[1:15:40] says that's who I am the word is there
[1:15:44] and and it says you know I can do all
[1:15:46] things and we look at this word and we
[1:15:48] can say you know what I I I'm not
[1:15:50] looking to be a bungee jumper or you
[1:15:52] know this that or the other I I'm not
[1:15:54] worried about all of that stuff out
[1:15:55] there I I I know who I
[1:15:58] am I know who I am I know what I can do
[1:16:02] where did that confidence come
[1:16:05] from Faith right faith that we we don't
[1:16:10] even look at it like I had Faith to
[1:16:13] believe we didn't
[1:16:15] believe it's his belief that he placed
[1:16:18] in us that's bringing us into the
[1:16:21] presence of the word and the word is
[1:16:24] Chang changing us oh my brother and
[1:16:27] sister sometimes I think we need to
[1:16:28] simplify things to get over the
[1:16:31] complicated things about faith you know
[1:16:34] I just I don't encourage you to do it
[1:16:36] don't waste your time but you know
[1:16:38] there's about two zillion books out
[1:16:39] there about
[1:16:41] faith and you know they they all you
[1:16:44] know tell you you need to do this you
[1:16:46] need to do that you'll have more faith
[1:16:47] if this you'll have more faith with that
[1:16:49] my brother and sister what we need to do
[1:16:52] is go back to the word and let him in
[1:16:55] word form reveal the faith that's
[1:16:58] already in
[1:17:01] us there's no perfect
[1:17:04] formula for some it takes you through
[1:17:07] fiery
[1:17:09] trials to just reveal that Faith others
[1:17:14] by God's grace have a little something
[1:17:17] happen in their life and and it opens up
[1:17:20] to
[1:17:21] them and you say wow you know they got
[1:17:24] faith they got good faith and it doesn't
[1:17:26] seem like they've had a struggle to get
[1:17:27] it yeah they had a struggle my struggle
[1:17:30] was just different than your struggle
[1:17:32] right because every one of us is going
[1:17:35] to be tested by the
[1:17:37] word amen you know there comes a point
[1:17:41] in time that we just have to Simply
[1:17:42] trust God
[1:17:45] Amen
[1:17:49] now and souls that are in prison now
[1:17:52] brother Brown says this
[1:17:55] but remember all this time Noah was in
[1:17:57] the ark the bride I want you to just
[1:18:00] follow a catch this brother Brown's
[1:18:02] tying us right back it's connecting it
[1:18:05] right back this is not something new
[1:18:07] this is the word being manifested in our
[1:18:10] day but he's already opened this word
[1:18:14] nothing new Under the
[1:18:18] Sun Noah is in the ark the bride is
[1:18:21] sealed in with Christ the last member
[1:18:24] had has been
[1:18:26] redeemed some people don't believe
[1:18:29] that let me throw a little twist to
[1:18:31] those words whether that person knows
[1:18:34] they're redeemed or not they're already
[1:18:39] redeemed we get this idea that it's the
[1:18:41] point that this guy finally quit
[1:18:43] struggling against the word and come and
[1:18:45] surrender to the Lord oh yes then he's
[1:18:47] redeemed I'm sorry my brother and sister
[1:18:49] God is infallible in his work he cannot
[1:18:52] lie he cannot change his mind and so the
[1:18:55] very last soul that is going to be to be
[1:18:58] in the Rapture is already redeemed the
[1:19:02] price already
[1:19:05] paid we ought to be treating everybody
[1:19:07] in the world like they were that last
[1:19:09] one
[1:19:14] amen last member has been redeemed the
[1:19:17] six seal has produced itself the seventh
[1:19:20] seal brings him back to Earth now many
[1:19:23] people take this quote right here and
[1:19:25] say the seventh seal won't be fulfilled
[1:19:27] until the coming of
[1:19:31] Christ what's living in
[1:19:36] you
[1:19:38] theology a book of dos and
[1:19:41] don'ts a church age
[1:19:44] book
[1:19:46] Christ he's fulfilled that word but he
[1:19:49] said he would do it so secretive so
[1:19:53] silently that the World wouldn't even
[1:19:56] know and they're sitting there still
[1:19:58] looking for a christ to come come back
[1:20:00] on the earth and he's already come he's
[1:20:02] already redeemed a people and they're
[1:20:04] standing there today with a confidence
[1:20:06] that Christ is in them alive and well
[1:20:09] and it's not your flesh any longer it's
[1:20:12] his flesh it's his hands it's his feet
[1:20:16] it's his mouth nose ears mind and
[1:20:21] soul sitting here today you see now the
[1:20:24] whole Redemption process I I won't go
[1:20:27] into it tonight I got I got a whole
[1:20:28] bunch of other things but the whole
[1:20:30] Redemption process my brother and sister
[1:20:32] God allowed it allowed it to play out
[1:20:35] for us humans humans here I just got on
[1:20:38] a website today for for uh that we order
[1:20:42] parts off of and you know it always does
[1:20:45] this little thing you click here you
[1:20:47] click there and then it does this deal
[1:20:50] and says checking to see if you're
[1:20:53] human how does a computer know I'm human
[1:20:57] I don't touch the keyboard I don't touch
[1:20:59] the mouse I don't do nothing and all of
[1:21:01] a sudden it says oh you're
[1:21:04] human I think they're fooling
[1:21:07] themselves but you see my brother and
[1:21:09] sister what happens is God brings you
[1:21:11] and I through that same uh process if
[1:21:14] you can say every single day checking to
[1:21:17] see if your
[1:21:21] bride the word will never leave you from
[1:21:26] the
[1:21:28] word it can't do
[1:21:30] it so it's not like God testing to see
[1:21:34] if somehow you've changed over the day
[1:21:36] but you see he's just looking at you
[1:21:39] there's the word there's the word
[1:21:42] there's the
[1:21:43] word we are the word amen amen that
[1:21:47] ought to be enough to call some of us
[1:21:49] all of us every one of us to jump and
[1:21:51] Shout amen hallelujah the seven seal
[1:21:54] brings him back to Earth the lamb come
[1:21:56] and took the book out of the right hand
[1:21:58] of him and sat down and claimed what he
[1:22:01] owned what he had redeemed so at that
[1:22:05] point right there everything was
[1:22:06] redeemed not looking to the day that I
[1:22:09] went to an altar I got baptized da da da
[1:22:12] my brother and sister that's not the day
[1:22:14] you were already in him and he's
[1:22:16] declaring
[1:22:17] it that's right it's always been that
[1:22:20] third pole three is perfection the
[1:22:23] ministry come to its perfection when it
[1:22:25] reproduced Christ again in natural
[1:22:28] amongst human beings that's right my my
[1:22:32] brother and sister it come to Perfection
[1:22:35] at that point now forgive me to Branch
[1:22:39] just a little bit and we're still out
[1:22:41] here trying to be
[1:22:44] perfect and God said it's already taken
[1:22:48] place it's already a finished work oh
[1:22:53] I'm just trying to the best message
[1:22:55] believer to be perfect help me I made it
[1:22:58] oh you know I did oh no trust him trust
[1:23:03] him it's come what is the ministry there
[1:23:06] some would say it's a five-fold Ministry
[1:23:09] but it's the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:23:11] because that's what the five-fold
[1:23:13] ministry is is actually a Ministry of
[1:23:15] Jesus Christ they're not a separate
[1:23:18] entity that's why it's hard to
[1:23:20] understand the Warfare that there is
[1:23:22] against the five-fold ministry
[1:23:25] there there there is an open attack
[1:23:26] against the five-fold ministry and and
[1:23:29] they act like that's some kind of
[1:23:31] separate
[1:23:32] entity but you see what they're doing is
[1:23:35] looking at the screen and saying ah it's
[1:23:38] just a
[1:23:39] human but God doesn't look at it that
[1:23:41] way God says that was my word that's
[1:23:44] myself that's right and that's what the
[1:23:48] bride will see the bride won't see a
[1:23:51] bunch of men cuz you know I've already
[1:23:54] stuttered and sputtered tonight I I
[1:23:56] wouldn't make it in some of those
[1:23:59] churches I I wouldn't make it you know
[1:24:01] they'd say this
[1:24:02] guy's not culturally
[1:24:07] sound we're proud of that aren't we
[1:24:09] brother
[1:24:11] Terry not culturally
[1:24:18] sound not going to tell on Jerry but I'm
[1:24:20] going to tell on
[1:24:21] Jerry there's a brother that we love
[1:24:24] very much and she'd happened to uh see a
[1:24:27] deal where he was preaching and she
[1:24:29] tells me she says I don't know what to
[1:24:31] think Paul his his collar's crooked and
[1:24:34] his TI is pulled off to one side you
[1:24:38] know just didn't you know
[1:24:42] just need a signal or something you
[1:24:46] know the problem is my brother and
[1:24:49] sister that's not the Revelation we're
[1:24:52] looking for the re ation is Christ in
[1:24:55] his word and so this ministry of Jesus
[1:24:58] Christ is coming to Perfection it
[1:25:00] reproduced Christ again in amongst human
[1:25:04] beings as were predicted as it was in
[1:25:06] the days of lot see how beautiful this
[1:25:09] is it's not a deep complex thing for us
[1:25:13] to dig in and have to research this of
[1:25:16] how we're going to get more faith I'll
[1:25:18] tell you how we get more faith we
[1:25:20] die we die out to ourself that Christ
[1:25:24] can be revealed amen that's where our
[1:25:27] faith will be revealed at the more that
[1:25:30] we die not the more that we know the
[1:25:33] more that we die the more of Christ will
[1:25:36] be seen in this flesh amen I I just you
[1:25:41] know encourage on that I'm not trying to
[1:25:44] oversimplify this but I think sometimes
[1:25:47] we made it over
[1:25:49] complicated how are we going to teach
[1:25:51] don't you think that if there was a way
[1:25:53] to us to faith that God would have led
[1:25:57] the prophet to preach that would have
[1:25:59] had a sermon how to get more faith but
[1:26:02] what did he
[1:26:03] say it's
[1:26:06] already in
[1:26:08] you there's what the prophet taught us
[1:26:11] it's already in you die that it might be
[1:26:17] revealed amen you love the Lord sister

[1:27:13] Chris brother Chris recently preached
[1:27:15] back in uh
[1:27:17] BCF and um it's talking about the Battle
[1:27:20] within my brother and sister that
[1:27:23] battle's never going away don't think
[1:27:25] that you'll be perfect and ready for the
[1:27:27] Rapture when that battle has completely
[1:27:33] ceased the battle's there but God's
[1:27:36] already said you've overcome the battle
[1:27:39] let's believe what the word said amen to
[1:27:41] overcome the battle we need to it was
[1:27:44] already in that earlier quote we need to
[1:27:46] believe
[1:27:47] yes you mean if I believe I have more
[1:27:51] faith test it and see
[1:27:54] test it and see you'll find the more you
[1:27:56] believe and commit the more faith you'll
[1:27:59] have see that's what's happened to
[1:28:01] people why they're not they're they're
[1:28:04] falling away from the message they're
[1:28:06] falling away is because they're
[1:28:10] actually natural
[1:28:13] reaction they fall
[1:28:16] away and they have less understanding
[1:28:18] less Faith which causes them to fall
[1:28:21] away and then they have less
[1:28:23] understanding and less L Faith which
[1:28:24] causes them to fall
[1:28:26] away my brother and sister let me type
[1:28:28] it to you as I
[1:28:31] close when the serpents were in the

[1:28:47] those serpents were even at that spot in
[1:28:49] the wilderness we don't have to explain
[1:28:52] how a Brazen serpent could cause that
