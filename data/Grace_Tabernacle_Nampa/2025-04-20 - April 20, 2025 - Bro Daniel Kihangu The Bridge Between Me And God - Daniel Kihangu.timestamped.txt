[25:18] The give me a heart like thine. It's
[25:21] just been something that's on my heart
[25:22] lately, Lord Jesus. Just change me, Lord
[25:24] God. Amen.
[25:29] Come to my
[25:32] soul, precious
[25:35] Jesus, my
[25:39] Lord. Hear me, oh
[25:44] Savior divine.
[25:51] Open the
[25:53] fountain and cleanse
[25:56] me, oh
[25:59] Lord. Give me a
[26:03] heart like thine.
[26:10] Come to my
[26:13] soul, precious
[26:16] Jesus, my
[26:19] Lord. Hear
[26:21] me, oh
[26:23] Savior divine.
[26:31] Open the
[26:33] fountain and cleanse
[26:36] me, oh
[26:39] Lord. Give me a
[26:43] heart like
[26:47] thy more time.
[26:50] Come to my
[26:52] soul, precious
[26:55] Jesus, my
[26:59] Lord. Hear me, oh
[27:03] Savior
[27:08] divine.
[27:10] Open the
[27:13] fountain and cleanse me.
[27:16] Oh
[27:18] Lord, give me a
[27:22] heart like
[27:27] thine.
[27:29] Amen. Amen. I wanted to start with a
[27:32] little
[27:33] testimony. Uh I talked to our brother
[27:35] Paul yesterday and I think it was the I
[27:37] think it was the meeting on Friday night
[27:39] there in South Africa.
[27:42] Um, he was preaching and there was a
[27:45] sister there in the audience. I don't
[27:47] even think I don't even think she was
[27:49] praying for this, but the Lord delivered
[27:51] her of it. She wears glasses, can't see
[27:54] very well, but she noticed she was
[27:56] looking at the screen and it was getting
[27:59] blurry. She's like, "What's going on?"
[28:01] took her glasses off and she could see
[28:03] clearly and she thought, "What? What's
[28:06] happening here?" She put her glasses
[28:09] back on. and it was all blurry.
[28:13] She takes her glasses off. It's clear as
[28:16] day. So, I think at the end of service
[28:18] or the next day, I I don't know that
[28:20] exactly, but Brother Paul, I'm sure,
[28:22] will share this, but she comes up and
[28:24] she tells Brother Dale, she says,
[28:25] "Brother Dale, Lord healed my healed my
[28:27] vision." And he hands her the mic. He
[28:29] says, "Sing those words on that screen."
[28:32] Without her glasses, she sings them
[28:33] perfectly clear and say, "Praise God.
[28:36] He's alive and well." Amen. Amen. Praise
[28:40] the Lord.
[28:42] Amen. As we get ready to go to prayer
[28:44] this morning, want to I'm gonna ask our
[28:46] brother David. It's good to have you
[28:47] back, brother David. Missed
[28:49] you. Amen. Want to remember our brother
[28:52] Paul and the I think they're through
[28:55] Easter morning meeting, but uh the rest
[28:57] of the meetings down there and just his
[28:59] time down there, Lord, to bring him home
[29:00] safely. Amen. Uh I want to continue to
[29:03] remember baby Charlie
[29:06] um and our sister Lorie Snow. Amen. For
[29:09] complete healing and both for both of
[29:11] them. Um hold our brother Pashant sister
[29:14] Konch up in prayer as well. Just for
[29:17] each one of us for f we have families.
[29:19] We have different ones. Amen. Let's just
[29:21] remember each one in prayer this
[29:22] morning. Brother David, do you want to
[29:23] come?
[29:28] [Music]
[29:30] Praise the Lord. Is he risen? He's
[29:34] standing here today. Do you realize he's
[29:36] behind the veil of flesh? Yours? Yes,
[29:38] sir. Thank you, Lord. So, the
[29:40] resurrection is a person. That's right.
[29:43] Not a myth, not an idea. It's a person.
[29:47] That's right. He's in you alive. Amen.
[29:49] The word's living. Yes, sir. How many
[29:52] have an unspoken request by raised hand?
[29:55] Amen. You're sincere about that? Do you
[29:58] believe that if we agree together that
[29:59] that need be met, whatever it is,
[30:01] according to his will, it'll be done.
[30:05] Then, let's bow our heads together. Our
[30:07] precious Lord Jesus,
[30:10] our resurrection,
[30:12] our life, our deliverer,
[30:17] Lord, when you raised, we raised with
[30:20] you because we were your thoughts of
[30:24] yourself to be manifest in this hour, in
[30:27] this time. And we're here glorifying you
[30:30] that the resurrection, we live in that
[30:32] resurrection. We have the
[30:34] resurrection. And by that Lord and by
[30:37] the testimony of that and identifying us
[30:39] in you. When you raised, we raised with
[30:41] you. Thank you Lord. Lord we are also
[30:44] looking for that body change which has
[30:46] begun in us. We thank you for the
[30:49] revelation of the rapture.
[30:52] And Lord Jesus, we thank you father for
[30:54] this opportunity that we can come
[30:57] together not
[30:59] to celebrate something past that isn't
[31:02] present but is present. We are
[31:05] glorifying you, Lord, because you took
[31:08] all our sin. You took all our failures.
[31:10] You took it, nailed it to your cross,
[31:14] died with it, and rose again victorious.
[31:17] And we are free
[31:19] indeed. We thank you, Father, that we
[31:21] can bring these requests before you this
[31:24] morning, Lord. Our brother Paul, thank
[31:26] you for the testimony that we just
[31:28] received, how you sent your word and
[31:31] healed them. Amen. We thank you for that
[31:33] healing, Lord, because we're expecting
[31:35] to walk out of here different this
[31:37] morning. We're expecting to hear you
[31:39] speak through your minister, Lord. We're
[31:42] to use that gift,
[31:44] Lord. We're not here to see a man. We're
[31:46] here to pre hear you and to hear your
[31:49] voice. And we're asking you to reveal
[31:51] your word to us. Wash us through the
[31:53] washing of your word.
[31:56] And Lord Jesus, we thank you, Father,
[31:58] that these needs that have been min that
[32:00] have been spoken, the requests that have
[32:02] been spoken are already ministered. We
[32:04] just ask you to remember every one of
[32:07] those. Lord, we thank you for healing
[32:09] our sister Snow. We thank you, Father,
[32:12] for these others, Lord, that need
[32:14] healing, that are already healed. These
[32:17] requests this morning that have been
[32:18] raised by hand, unspoken. Lord, you have
[32:21] ministered and are ministering to those
[32:23] even at this moment.
[32:26] Lord Jesus, we love you and we praise
[32:28] you and we're assembled together in your
[32:30] name knowing that you are present. The
[32:32] King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, our
[32:35] redeemer, our
[32:37] salvation, our
[32:39] redemption. We thank you, Father. We
[32:41] give you praise now in the name of Jesus
[32:44] Christ. May every one of these things be
[32:46] met and ministered according to your
[32:49] word and believing we receive what we
[32:50] ask for. We give thanks to you. Amen.
[32:54] [Music]
[33:01] Amen. You may have your
[33:03] seats. Uh, a couple announcements here
[33:05] as we're getting ready. Brother, uh,
[33:08] Titus Titus has a special for us. If you
[33:12] guys want to come forward.
[33:17] Um, just looking forward to what Lord's
[33:19] laid on brother Daniel's heart this
[33:21] morning. Amen.
[33:22] And uh just a reminder, there will be a
[33:25] fellowship after the uh after the um
[33:28] service this morning. We'll probably
[33:31] pray for the food before we go
[33:33] downstairs. So, make that easier, but
[33:37] uh Amen.
[34:04] [Music]
[34:18] So many times I've
[34:20] questioned certain
[34:23] circumstances or things I did
[34:26] not understand.
[34:31] Many times in
[34:33] trials, weakness blurs my vision and my
[34:38] frustration gets so out of
[34:43] hand. Then I am
[34:45] reminded I've never been
[34:49] forsaken. I've never had to stand one
[34:52] test alone.
[34:55] And as I look at all my victories, the
[34:59] spirit rises up to me. As through the
[35:03] fire, my weakness is made
[35:07] strong. He never promised that the cross
[35:12] not get heavy or that the hill would not
[35:15] be hard to climb.
[35:20] He never offered a victories with
[35:24] fighting, but he said help would always
[35:27] come in
[35:30] time. Just remember when you're standing
[35:34] in the valley of
[35:36] decision and the adversary says give
[35:41] in. Just hold on.
[35:45] My Lord will show up and he will take
[35:49] you through the fire
[35:54] again. I know within myself that I would
[35:58] surely perish. But if I trust in the
[36:02] hand of God, he'll shed the flames
[36:04] again.
[36:09] He never promised that the cross would
[36:12] knock you heavy or the hill would not be
[36:16] hard to
[36:19] climb. He never offered victories with
[36:24] fighting but he said help would always
[36:27] come in
[36:30] time. Cuz remember when you're standing
[36:34] in the valley of decision and the
[36:38] adversary says give in and just hold
[36:44] on. My Lord will show up and he will
[36:48] take you through the fire again.
[36:51] [Music]
[36:56] [Applause]
[37:15] What's that?
[37:18] [Music]
[37:22] Do you
[37:23] worry, friend, for the cares of life,
[37:28] for the sin from shore to
[37:33] shore? That the sinful world which
[37:37] you're dwelling in might creep in more
[37:42] and
[37:44] more. worry for nothing, but in
[37:49] everything by prayer make your
[37:53] request and the peace of God passing
[37:58] over our thoughts shall enter you to his
[38:04] rest. Do you long to leave this flesh
[38:09] body and step out from death unto life?
[38:15] Do you think you're lost to the thoughts
[38:19] of God with no hope but pain and
[38:24] strive? worry for nothing, but in
[38:29] everything by prayer make your
[38:34] requests. And the peace of God passing
[38:38] over our thoughts shall take care of all
[38:42] the
[38:43] rest. But you are not lost. You are on
[38:48] God's mind. You're the apple of his eye.
[38:53] Though you've fallen down, you're not
[38:56] lost, you're found. And you knew this
[39:00] all the
[39:01] time. Worry for nothing. But in
[39:06] everything by prayer, make your
[39:10] request. And the peace of God passing
[39:14] over our thoughts shall take care of all
[39:18] your
[39:21] rest. So if you're on God's mind, let
[39:24] him be on thine, consider his law day
[39:28] and
[39:29] night and his precepts then will they be
[39:34] your joy and you'll find his burdens
[39:38] light.
[39:40] Worry for nothing, but in
[39:43] everything by prayer make your
[39:48] requests. And the peace of God passing
[39:51] over our thoughts shall take care of all
[39:55] your

[40:26] both of you. Amen. Gets me gets me a
[40:31] little excited. We got more song leaders
[40:33] coming

[40:38] this song on my heart the last couple
[40:40] days. Um, number 1080, the battle is the
[40:43] Lord's. We'll sing this as we ask our
[40:45] brother Daniel to come this
[40:48] [Music]
[40:51] morning. Need to just quit fighting and
[40:54] give it to him.
[40:55] [Music]
[40:58] Amen. There is a
[41:03] soul in times of need.
[41:10] that gives me
[41:15] hope, that brings me peace.
[41:22] In every
[41:27] trial, through every
[41:33] test, a savior
[41:38] stands in my
[41:44] defend. Oh, and the road you
[41:50] walk leaves you tired and
[41:56] warm. All your strength is
[42:02] gone and your heart feels
[42:08] tone.
[42:10] Remember,
[42:12] God is greater than your
[42:19] stone. Make
[42:21] courage
[42:24] for battle is the
[42:31] Lord and the waterers dry.
[42:38] He calls my
[42:42] name and he bids me
[42:46] [Music]
[42:48] come out on the
[42:54] way. He holds my
[43:00] hand lest I should
[43:06] falter. and makes me
[43:11] stand upon the
[43:17] water. When the road you
[43:23] walk leaves you tired and
[43:29] warm. All your strength is
[43:34] gone and your heart feels
[43:41] cold.
[43:42] Remember,
[43:45] God is greater than your
[43:52] stone. Take courage
[43:57] for battle is the
[44:03] Lord. And when the waters
[44:07] [Music]
[44:09] rise, he calls my
[44:15] name and bids me
[44:20] come out on the way.
[44:27] He holds my
[44:32] hand lest I should
[44:37] falter. And he makes me
[44:43] stand upon the
[44:49] water. When the road you
[44:54] walk leaves you tired and
[45:01] warm. Your strength is
[45:06] gone and your heart feels torn.
[45:23] Oh, take courage
[45:27] for the water.
[45:37] you
[45:40] are leaves you tied and
[45:45] warm and your strength is
[45:51] gone and your heart feels.
[45:56] Oh, just
[45:59] remember
[46:01] God is greater than the
[46:08] soul.
[46:10] Take
[46:13] for the battle is the
[46:18] Lord. Amen. Let's just bow our head.
[46:23] Lord Jesus, how we come before you in
[46:26] this resurrection morning. Oh God, it
[46:30] mean a lot to us to think of what the
[46:33] price was for us to be what we are
[46:36] today. Amen. Lord Jesus, none of us, oh
[46:39] God, deserve to be called your son, but
[46:42] you adopted us, Lord. Amen. And because
[46:45] of your grace, we can stand. We come
[46:48] before you father ask that you will have
[46:51] the preeminence over everything. We
[46:53] thank you Lord Jesus for the testimony
[46:56] and the healing power Lord Jesus in your
[46:59] name that we can confess Lord we just
[47:02] standing now oh God ask that you will
[47:04] take this part of the service. May you
[47:07] speak your word Lord Jesus as we commit
[47:10] all into your care now in Jesus name.
[47:13] Amen. Amen. Amen. Uh just going to ask
[47:17] you to take your
[47:19] Bible. We're going to read one scripture
[47:22] and we pray
[47:26] and I will have you seat in the book of
[47:29] Isaiah chapter
[47:31] 59. Just going to read one scripture
[47:34] there. Uh verse one Isaiah 59.
[47:56] We're going to read verse one. Isaiah
[47:58] 59:E1.
[48:07] Behold, the Lord's hands is not short
[48:11] shortened that he cannot
[48:15] save, neither his ear heavy that he
[48:19] cannot ear. I'm going to read it again.
[48:23] Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened
[48:26] that he cannot save, neither his ear
[48:30] heavy that he cannot hear. I have a
[48:34] little title from this uh scripture. Uh
[48:37] my title for this morning is the bridge
[48:40] between me and God. Let's bow our head
[48:44] one more time. Lord Jesus, we read your
[48:49] word just as human being. But your word,
[48:53] oh God, is sacred and you are the author
[48:56] of your word. We don't know anything
[48:58] father but reading. Now we pray oh God
[49:02] in this most important time that you
[49:05] will set us aside. You be the speaker
[49:09] and you be the ear Lord Jesus. May you
[49:12] bring this word oh God alive in our
[49:15] heart. We thank you Lord for this group
[49:18] of people this church that you have
[49:20] placed here in this town. We remember
[49:22] again brother Paul God. May you bring
[49:25] him home safe. May you be with us Lord
[49:28] Jesus as we commit this moment once
[49:30] again to you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[49:34] You may have your
[49:37] seat. I'd like to greet you all in the
[49:39] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. It's my
[49:42] first time to be here uh in the town and
[49:45] in the church. Uh my name is brother
[49:48] Daniel Kiangu.
[49:50] I live in uh Washington up north and uh
[49:55] by God's grace we minister uh in clo and
[50:00] uh in down in Seattle there is a little
[50:03] church there also that we do minister
[50:06] and lately we've been uh going up north
[50:10] here in Adaw uh in Sunpoint and we be
[50:14] also going uh ministering a little bit
[50:17] over there. So that's where we met
[50:19] brother Paul and I feel very u humble
[50:24] that he asked me to come and take the
[50:27] service when he's not there when he's
[50:30] been away. I think it's a shows a level
[50:34] of trust you know it shows a lot of a
[50:36] level of confidence we I don't think
[50:39] we've really be close but I believe it
[50:43] trust and it's not about a person but
[50:45] it's about God. Amen. And when we were
[50:48] coming, I was thinking I would be a
[50:50] strange year cuz I don't really recall
[50:53] people that I we know here. I see sister
[50:55] Sammy and the king's family that moved
[50:57] from our area. But we had uh some
[51:00] fellowship with brother Isaac and he was
[51:02] telling me some stories and the
[51:05] background of the church. I really feel
[51:07] myself at home and I think like I'm not
[51:10] feeling a strange anymore. And I see
[51:13] brother Kim the dingo family vine. God
[51:16] bless you. And different one coming from
[51:19] Sunpoint, Brother Eagle, brother Moses,
[51:22] the Wajala family, see sister Sandy,
[51:26] brother Nolan, they drove for about six
[51:28] hours to be able to just be part of the
[51:31] service and our fellowship. We trust
[51:33] that God we honor those sacrifices. And
[51:36] all of you that put all the many effort
[51:39] to be able to come for the service, we
[51:41] did not come here to meet a man, but we
[51:43] come to meet Christ. And we just trust
[51:45] that he is going to be uh uh gracious
[51:50] enough to come and to fellowship with us
[51:53] to commune with us and that's all we
[51:56] want not a man but we want Jesus to take
[51:58] the preeminence so uh you will help me
[52:03] uh know that you know when you face new
[52:06] people new places it take a little bit
[52:08] of a time for you to adjust and to feel
[52:11] relaxed you feel a little nervous but I
[52:14] trust you will pray for me and I trust
[52:16] that God will be here to help us. Also,
[52:19] I was just pondering on this uh little
[52:22] thought on uh this uh as I said the
[52:26] title the bridge between me and God. I
[52:30] did not want to say the bridge between
[52:32] us and God but make it more personal to
[52:36] uh you to me that this is about me. This
[52:40] is about you. It's not just in general.
[52:43] And I was just thinking this thought uh
[52:47] a bridge it uh it's defined as a
[52:50] structure and we all are familiar with
[52:52] bridge is not something new but it's a
[52:55] structure that's uh carrying a path or a
[52:59] roadway
[53:01] uh over the pressure or an obstacle. So
[53:05] it connects two hands and nothing very
[53:10] new to all of us. We are familiar with
[53:12] drive through bridges. Sometime you know
[53:15] you can walk through bridges but the
[53:17] bridge has a purpose. The purpose of a
[53:20] bridge is to connect one part that is
[53:24] not reachable to another part also that
[53:27] is not reachable. Yeah. So it make it
[53:30] possible for something that seems to be
[53:34] impossible that the bridge we bring
[53:37] those two things together that anything
[53:40] that you know uh maybe if it's a river
[53:45] you know for those who can swim maybe
[53:48] they can go across the other side. I
[53:50] don't know how long the river can be but
[53:52] for us who don't know how to swim we be
[53:55] scared. It will be impossible to reach
[53:58] the other side. Then a bridge make it
[54:00] more easy for a person to be able to
[54:04] walk and go to the other side. What was
[54:07] impossible before become possible
[54:10] because of a bridge. Amen. And sometime
[54:14] when there is no bridge you want to
[54:17] reach something or you you so love the
[54:20] area you know you you dream about it or
[54:24] you want to get there but it's so
[54:27] impossible you know you trying to reach
[54:29] your hands you cannot reach the place
[54:33] you cannot walk there and it become like
[54:35] a dream something that you wish you can
[54:38] get you can attain but you don't know
[54:40] how to get there And it becomes so hard
[54:44] sometime it can make you uh uh become
[54:47] frustrated you
[54:49] know nowadays I'm a uh English isn't my
[54:53] second language they can use a
[54:55] translator for example you know I speak
[54:58] French I'm fluent in French and uh some
[55:02] if I let's say I do not understand
[55:04] English they will bring someone to stand
[55:07] there between me and a fluent English
[55:11] speaker, that person has to have a skill
[55:15] to connect the two of us. That person
[55:18] will be able to better speak French or
[55:21] whatever language that might be and
[55:23] speak also English. Now the language
[55:26] barrier will be broken because of that
[55:30] person like you can be frustrated if you
[55:33] don't know how to speak the language.
[55:35] You you will feel frustrated. You don't
[55:37] know how to communicate. Maybe what you
[55:40] you have in mind is a good news. Maybe
[55:43] what you have in mind is something very
[55:46] important uh that you know the benefit
[55:48] of it but you just don't know how to
[55:51] express it. You just don't know how to
[55:53] uh reach out to that person and now you
[55:56] become so frustrated. You have all your
[55:59] ability. You have all your thought. But
[56:01] you cannot use it because there is a gap
[56:05] because there is a chasm because there
[56:06] is a a gulf between you and that person
[56:10] or between you or the area that you want
[56:13] to go. And that's exactly our condition
[56:18] between us and God.
[56:22] When you have all that you have as a
[56:24] desire in prayer, you know, you can
[56:26] pray, you have a desire, you have, you
[56:29] want to reach out, you can stand out,
[56:31] you stretch out your
[56:33] hands, and it seem
[56:35] like you can't reach it. It seem like
[56:39] you cannot get any further. It seem like
[56:42] there is no way. It seems so impossible.
[56:45] and down in your heart. You longing so
[56:47] much to have fellowship with him as we
[56:49] be seeing with you. You longing to have
[56:52] fellowship with him, but there is no way
[56:55] out. Your nature does not allow you to
[56:58] reach out. God is so holy. God is so
[57:02] perfect, but your nature does not allow
[57:04] you to have that fellowship that you're
[57:07] longing for. Your nature does not allow
[57:09] you to reach to that place that you're
[57:11] longing for. your nature or your
[57:14] condition prevent you to attain
[57:17] something that you so desire to have.
[57:21] You know, one may say, "I want the Holy
[57:23] Ghost." You know, I want God to deal
[57:26] with my life. And you have that desire.
[57:29] It's a genuine desire, but you don't
[57:31] know how to reach it. There is a gap.
[57:34] Yeah, but I want you to notice in the
[57:37] scripture that we read, it's easy for us
[57:40] to say we cannot reach God. But now this
[57:44] scripture does not tell about us. The
[57:47] person that seems to be frustrated in
[57:50] this scripture is God himself.
[57:54] Now the Bible say that God's hands is
[57:57] not shortened.
[57:59] In another way, he had a desire to
[58:01] stretch out his hand and to touch us. He
[58:05] had a desire to stretch out his hand and
[58:07] to deal with us. He want to do
[58:10] something. But for some reason, he's
[58:13] expressing himself. That's God speaking.
[58:15] He say, "I cannot reach them. I cannot
[58:18] touch them. I have blessings. I cannot
[58:22] give them that blessing. I don't know
[58:23] how to do that. I don't know how to
[58:25] reach out to them." Because of what?
[58:28] There is a chasm. That's right. There is
[58:30] a gulf. There is a a a condition that
[58:34] makes God almost impossible to reach
[58:37] unto us. And I believe that will make
[58:40] him frustrated if we uh bring this
[58:43] contest. He will become very frustrated
[58:45] that I want to bless them. But how can I
[58:48] do that? My nature prevent me to just go
[58:51] out and do it the way that I wish I can
[58:54] do it. And now God who is so powerful.
[58:58] Amen. You know me, we love God when we
[59:01] say that we need him. We want him. But
[59:05] let me tell you this morning, he want us
[59:09] more than we want him. Praise the Lord.
[59:12] He want more of us. He want to deal with
[59:15] us. He want to fellowship with us more
[59:19] than we want to fellowship with him. He
[59:21] want to bless us. He want to come closer
[59:24] to us more than we ever want to because
[59:28] that is nature. That's right. In the
[59:30] book of Ephesians chapter 3 verse
[59:42] 20 Paul put it this way.
[59:51] uh all these things we are quite
[59:53] familiar with it.
[1:00:01] So the Bible
[1:00:07] said now unto him that is able to do
[1:00:11] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:00:15] ask or think.
[1:00:18] Amen. according to the power that works
[1:00:22] in us. So here Paul is
[1:00:26] saying God want to
[1:00:29] do exceedingly and
[1:00:32] abundantly above what we can even think
[1:00:37] or ask.
[1:00:39] So let put it this way. If you
[1:00:43] want one bottle of
[1:00:46] water, God is more willing
[1:00:49] to give you even 20 b of watermen
[1:00:54] and there is no resource that's are
[1:00:56] limited
[1:00:58] it's unlimited resource
[1:01:01] is willing to do that and Paul says that
[1:01:06] he will give us exceedingly and
[1:01:08] abundantly
[1:01:10] more than what we can even ask or
[1:01:13] imagine but what I'm saying if you want
[1:01:17] healing God is more than willing to give
[1:01:21] you healing tonight
[1:01:23] a thousand times more than you want to
[1:01:26] be
[1:01:27] ill if you want to be healed God want to
[1:01:31] multiply it by thousand more that he
[1:01:35] want you to be
[1:01:37] healed if God's promise the Holy Spirit
[1:01:40] to every believer. He want to give it to
[1:01:44] you tonight more than you want to
[1:01:47] receive it. Amen.
[1:01:50] Everything that God want to give to his
[1:01:52] people, it's always exceeding and
[1:01:55] abundantly.
[1:01:57] He want to help you more than you want
[1:02:00] to help yourself.
[1:02:02] If you can just get the heart of that
[1:02:05] into your heart that God is more willing
[1:02:08] to help you more than you ever willing
[1:02:11] yourself to help. You get yourself stuck
[1:02:14] in a situation. He's more than willing
[1:02:17] to step into that situation and be part
[1:02:19] of that situation and and help you with
[1:02:22] that situation more than you ever
[1:02:25] thought. Is greater than any help that
[1:02:27] you can get. Is greater than any person
[1:02:29] that you can reach out. You want healing
[1:02:32] but what I'm say he's going to multiply
[1:02:34] it t thousands of time to give you that
[1:02:37] healing. You want deliverance he will
[1:02:39] multiply it thousands of time to give
[1:02:41] you that deliverance. So his hand is
[1:02:43] always there willing to reach out
[1:02:46] willing to bless because in him there is
[1:02:49] attribute and those attribute are not
[1:02:52] there for himself. Those attribute are
[1:02:55] not there for for what is he going to
[1:02:57] because he's perfect. Those attribute
[1:02:59] are not there for the angels. But those
[1:03:01] attribute are there for you and I. And
[1:03:05] because of that is so willing to reach
[1:03:08] out. He's so willing to give. He's so
[1:03:12] willing. He say if I can get an
[1:03:13] opportunity to come and I will show you
[1:03:16] how much I love you. I will show you how
[1:03:18] much that situation that you crying for,
[1:03:21] that situation that you seems to be
[1:03:23] concerned. I am more concerned of that
[1:03:25] situation than you are. I am more deeply
[1:03:28] in sorrow in that situation than you are
[1:03:31] and I'm so worthy to come down and to
[1:03:33] reach out to help you but the Bible say
[1:03:38] his hand is seems to be
[1:03:41] shortened even though it seems to he has
[1:03:44] that willingness but there seems to be a
[1:03:47] gap there seems to be a gulf there seem
[1:03:51] it seems to be almost impossible because
[1:03:53] I am in one end here and I am in another
[1:03:56] is in the other side here. Now you can
[1:04:00] see all this time the go Elohim will be
[1:04:05] we'll be seeing with you uh throughout
[1:04:07] the service the God's Elohim the word
[1:04:10] Elohim uh the Hebrew word Elohim it's
[1:04:13] something that you cannot define
[1:04:15] something that you cannot
[1:04:17] explain all sufficient that what we know
[1:04:21] it cover all the space it's more than
[1:04:24] that so they cannot you it's it's a
[1:04:26] being that you cannot explain that's
[1:04:28] right You talk about time, it cover all
[1:04:31] the time. You talk about space, it cover
[1:04:33] all the space. You want to think of
[1:04:35] something, it cover that that that
[1:04:37] thinking. So you cannot explain it. You
[1:04:40] cannot define it. In him there was all
[1:04:42] the power. In him there was all the
[1:04:44] blessing. In him there was everything
[1:04:47] was embodied in that person Elohim.
[1:04:51] Amen. And what I'm saying in that form
[1:04:53] of Elohim, he felt like that was not
[1:04:57] enough because who can worship him? Who
[1:05:01] can praise him? Who can because God the
[1:05:05] only way he become God is when he become
[1:05:08] an object of worship. But now being
[1:05:11] Elohim, being in that form with all the
[1:05:14] goodness, with all the money, with all
[1:05:16] everything that he can have, all the
[1:05:17] glory, all the power and everything, he
[1:05:20] felt like it seems to be not important.
[1:05:24] I need to make it to use. And now God
[1:05:28] who is infinite in his mind, he will
[1:05:31] start
[1:05:32] thinking. And in his mind, in his
[1:05:35] thought, he thought of you. Amen. In his
[1:05:38] thought he thought of my life. In his
[1:05:41] thought he thought of me. He thought of
[1:05:44] you. And all the plan that you might
[1:05:46] have, God already before the foundation
[1:05:48] of the world, he thought of that. All
[1:05:51] the trial that you will go through, he
[1:05:53] thought of that. All the pain that you
[1:05:56] will go through, he thought of that. Now
[1:05:58] there is nothing new to him. Everything
[1:06:00] that you can be, your existence, he
[1:06:03] thought of that. It was in his mind.
[1:06:05] Amen. But now with all those things that
[1:06:08] you will go
[1:06:09] through, there has to be a connection
[1:06:13] where he can come and reach out to you.
[1:06:17] There has to be a connection where he
[1:06:19] can come and bring all the goodness that
[1:06:22] he had towards you to bring it to pass
[1:06:26] before the foundation of the world. He
[1:06:28] thought of that. Yes, sir. He thought of
[1:06:31] that. He thought of this person Daniel
[1:06:36] is going to sin. He will be far away
[1:06:39] from me and I will not be able to reach
[1:06:42] him. His life, his condition will be so
[1:06:45] far away that I will not be able to
[1:06:47] reach him. But yet that's my son. Amen.
[1:06:50] Yet that's my daughter. Yet that is my
[1:06:53] son. And what can I do in my power to be
[1:06:58] able still as God him being away? We
[1:07:01] have two different nature so to say. We
[1:07:04] are in two different h
[1:07:06] uh place and location so to say. How can
[1:07:09] I be able to reach out to me? Reach out
[1:07:13] to him. Reach out to that person and
[1:07:16] show to him that I always thought of
[1:07:18] you. Amen. That situation that you are
[1:07:20] into, you're the problem. You might be
[1:07:23] going through a problem. You might be
[1:07:24] going through a struggles. He was
[1:07:26] thinking in his mind, how can I be a
[1:07:28] solution for that problem? answer. I
[1:07:32] cannot be an answer for that problems.
[1:07:34] It might be a healing. It might be a
[1:07:36] disease. It might be a condition in your
[1:07:39] body. God was thinking, I cannot be a
[1:07:42] helper for that condition in 2025. Yes,
[1:07:45] sir. Before the foundation of the world,
[1:07:48] before anything was created, before any
[1:07:51] angel was created, he's already was
[1:07:53] thinking, of a way to reach out to you.
[1:07:56] Amen. Tonight you might be struggling
[1:07:58] with that that uh that the the uh that
[1:08:03] condition or the that the that pain or
[1:08:05] whatever you're going through. But let
[1:08:07] me tell you that process that battle
[1:08:09] that you are maybe calling your battle
[1:08:11] tonight uh uh this afternoon it was a
[1:08:15] battle that was already solved. That's
[1:08:16] right. Way before the foundation of the
[1:08:19] world. Amen.
[1:08:20] And before the foundation of the world,
[1:08:23] he had himself a solution on how to
[1:08:27] reach unto you and I. He had himself a
[1:08:31] way to reach unto you and I. That's why
[1:08:35] the Bible say the lamb was slain before
[1:08:38] the foundation of the world. That's
[1:08:40] right. Before God started to think of
[1:08:43] the creation, before God started to
[1:08:46] think of anything else, the first thing
[1:08:49] that God did is still in his mind before
[1:08:52] the foundation of the world is lay a
[1:08:55] lamb.
[1:08:56] Jesus Christ was slain. That's right.
[1:08:58] The cross that we be speaking of uh this
[1:09:01] afternoon is not something that's
[1:09:04] studied a certain time, but it started
[1:09:07] before the foundation of the world. In
[1:09:09] the mind of God before anything existed,
[1:09:13] before anything was created, God thought
[1:09:15] of the cross and in his mind, in his
[1:09:19] plan for our redemption, he said that
[1:09:22] all the solution will come from that
[1:09:25] cross.
[1:09:27] All the solution will come, all the
[1:09:30] answer will come from that cross. The
[1:09:33] only way that I can be able to reach out
[1:09:36] to you, the only way that I can be able
[1:09:38] to make that gap be accessible that you
[1:09:42] will be able to come to me, I will be
[1:09:44] able to come to you. He made himself
[1:09:47] That's right. a way. That's it. He made
[1:09:49] himself a bridge that will connect you
[1:09:52] and I. That's right. That was the cross.
[1:09:55] That's right. Before the foundation of
[1:09:57] the world. Amen.
[1:09:59] in the book of Psalm uh chapter 14 uh
[1:10:03] verse
[1:10:23] 2 Psalm chapter 14. We just kind of
[1:10:26] trying to lay a foundation
[1:10:37] here and after that we read um Roman
[1:10:40] chapter 3
[1:10:48] uh verse 2-3 Psalm 14
[1:10:53] 2-3 the Lord looked looked down from
[1:10:56] heaven upon the children of
[1:10:59] men to see if there were any that did
[1:11:07] understanding that did understand and
[1:11:10] seek
[1:11:12] God. They are all gone
[1:11:16] aside. They are all together became
[1:11:20] become 50.
[1:11:23] There is none that doeth
[1:11:26] good. No, not one. Amen.
[1:11:31] That is you and I. Yes. Amen.
[1:11:34] There is no one that's doing good.
[1:11:38] That's right. They are all gone. The
[1:11:42] Bible say they are all gone aside. They
[1:11:45] are all together become filthy. Yeah.
[1:11:49] And there is none that doeth good. Not
[1:11:53] none. That's right. Now read how it says
[1:11:56] in Roman the same uh thoughts in Romans
[1:11:59] chapter
[1:12:12] 3. Uh it's the same Paul speaking of
[1:12:15] that same scripture. Rom chapter 3. I'm
[1:12:18] going to read verse 10 uh to verse
[1:12:33] 11 verse 10 to verse
[1:12:36] 11. Uh this is Paul speaking. As it is
[1:12:40] written, there is none righteous. Amen.
[1:12:44] No, not one.
[1:12:48] There there is none that
[1:12:51] understandeth. There is none that
[1:12:55] seeketh after God. That's right. Amen.
[1:12:59] All of us included. Amen. Brother, we
[1:13:03] make many statement. He say you never
[1:13:06] sought God. That's right. You never
[1:13:08] search God.
[1:13:10] There is no ability in you as a human
[1:13:14] being to search God.
[1:13:18] But God search you.
[1:13:21] God is the one that search you and he
[1:13:24] found you.
[1:13:26] And you only when you call you say that
[1:13:28] you know I've searched God. All that you
[1:13:31] saying you responded to God searching
[1:13:34] you. You did not search God but he
[1:13:37] searched you. And now Paul is emphasized
[1:13:40] and he said
[1:13:42] that is it reading uh uh there is none
[1:13:47] righteous no one. There is none that
[1:13:51] understandeth. There is none that
[1:13:54] seeketh after God. There is none that
[1:13:57] seeking God. Amen. Right. I want all of
[1:14:00] us to be in the same balance. We are all
[1:14:03] guilty. Yeah, we are all there is no one
[1:14:07] that can present before God and show him
[1:14:09] his good uh his goodness or show him
[1:14:13] something that he can beat himself up.
[1:14:16] There was these two uh uhh people
[1:14:18] praying in a temple, the publican and
[1:14:20] the Samaritan and this one came and he
[1:14:23] looked up and he said the Samaritan look
[1:14:25] up and say, "Oh, I thank you because I
[1:14:27] give my side. I thank you because I give
[1:14:30] my offering. I thank you because I dress
[1:14:32] up like a Christian. I thank you because
[1:14:34] I I do this and I do that and I do that.
[1:14:37] Yeah. And he he finish his prayer at the
[1:14:40] same moment the publican who was so fify
[1:14:43] so to say who you can point finger he
[1:14:46] couldn't look up to heaven and he looked
[1:14:48] down and he said Lord have mercy upon
[1:14:50] me. There is nothing I can offer you.
[1:14:53] There is nothing in my heart. In my
[1:14:55] heart there is a condemnation. In my
[1:14:57] heart there is guilty. In my heart there
[1:15:00] is a condition that I know for sure I
[1:15:03] cannot present myself before you have
[1:15:05] mercy upon me. And Jesus said that
[1:15:07] between the two of them our father hear
[1:15:10] the publican prayer. He hear the one
[1:15:13] that's coming looking at his condition.
[1:15:16] I have nothing good in my life. There is
[1:15:19] nothing good in my life. I trying to
[1:15:21] live a Christian life. I trying to serve
[1:15:23] you. It's because of your grace. Not
[1:15:26] because of my ability. It's not because
[1:15:29] of what everything that you can do or
[1:15:31] produce. Everything that your life can
[1:15:33] only produce is fifi. Amen. David said
[1:15:37] that your righteousness is like a fify
[1:15:40] rag before God. Amen. There is nothing
[1:15:44] that you can boost. There is nothing in
[1:15:46] us that we can boost. And Paul said that
[1:15:49] none of us the pastor the prophet or
[1:15:52] whatever the apostle any any officer
[1:15:55] that you can there is no one that ever
[1:15:58] seek God. Amen. But it's God that seek
[1:16:01] that sought you. When Paul was running
[1:16:04] away the one who spoke when he was
[1:16:06] running away he went out to killing the
[1:16:09] to torture to uh to persecute the the
[1:16:13] Christian. As he was running, the Bible
[1:16:15] say, "Then the light appear." What was
[1:16:19] that? That was the grace of God. That
[1:16:22] was God himself in his appointed time
[1:16:24] that he came after you. It was not you,
[1:16:27] but it was God mercy. It was God's
[1:16:30] grace. At that day when he came and
[1:16:33] knock on your door, but because of the
[1:16:35] seed of God that dwell in you, you
[1:16:37] responded. Because of the seed of God
[1:16:39] that's in your life, you responded. You
[1:16:41] say, "Father, here I am. Here I am. I'm
[1:16:44] ready to give up myself. I'm ready to
[1:16:46] follow. But it was not you doing the
[1:16:48] first move. That's right. It was God
[1:16:51] desire to always make a bridge. How can
[1:16:55] I reach out to my children? How can I
[1:16:57] bring that solution? It's not you. The
[1:17:00] Bible even say that our prayer, it's not
[1:17:03] even us praying. That's right. It's the
[1:17:05] Holy Ghost in us that's making
[1:17:07] intercession over our needs. In another
[1:17:10] way, it's even Jesus Christ. It's God
[1:17:13] himself that dwell in us that doing the
[1:17:16] prayer on our behalf. Amen. It's not
[1:17:19] anything about us, but it's God that
[1:17:22] reaching out by his mercy and by his
[1:17:25] grace. Amen. The whole story, if I can
[1:17:27] go uh down to my subject now, starting
[1:17:31] in the garden of Eden and as we
[1:17:34] know, God created Adam and Eve. There
[1:17:38] was nothing as perfect as the life that
[1:17:42] Adam and Eve was
[1:17:44] living. Everything was
[1:17:47] perfect. There was no need of
[1:17:50] bridge. God, we come down say God we
[1:17:53] come down and every evening and we
[1:17:56] fellowship. There was no barrier. There
[1:17:58] was no gap. There was
[1:18:01] nothing. And it was so
[1:18:05] perfect. You know, Adam will wake up,
[1:18:08] you know, he can have a very easy day.
[1:18:11] He will go walk around and with with Eve
[1:18:14] and there was nothing wrong. Everything
[1:18:16] was so perfect. Everything working in
[1:18:18] harmony. God can come down. Adam did not
[1:18:21] need to make a lot of prayer like we do.
[1:18:24] They did not know what sickness mean.
[1:18:26] That's right. They did not know what's
[1:18:28] headache mean. You know, you talk about,
[1:18:30] oh, it's sunny today. I'm feeling
[1:18:32] uncomfortable. Let me turn on the AC or
[1:18:34] turn out turn off the the van or
[1:18:36] whatever. There was no need of that. It
[1:18:39] was perfect. The perfect you ever
[1:18:41] imagine of a perfect weather for
[1:18:43] vacation. They were in a perfect
[1:18:45] condition.
[1:18:46] The weather was perfect. Life was
[1:18:49] perfect. No hungry, not feeling any
[1:18:51] desire, not feeling any pain. Everything
[1:18:54] was so smooth and perfect. And Adam was
[1:18:58] walking in the perfection of God
[1:19:01] creation. Amen. Amen. And at that
[1:19:04] moment, God can come down and fellowship
[1:19:07] with Adam in that perfection.
[1:19:10] And we all know the story. Then sin came
[1:19:15] in. As little as that sin could have
[1:19:18] been, but that sin was enough because
[1:19:22] God said to Adam and he said, "The day
[1:19:25] you will eat, the day you will die. The
[1:19:28] day you will sin, the day you will do
[1:19:31] this, the day you will die. And what I'm
[1:19:33] saying that is uh death is not just
[1:19:36] dying naturally, but death is an eternal
[1:19:39] separation to God. In another way, Adam,
[1:19:44] the day you will sin, the day you will
[1:19:46] do this, there will be a gap between you
[1:19:49] and I. That's right. It's not going to
[1:19:51] be the same like you see now. I'm
[1:19:54] warning you, Adam. You keep this
[1:19:56] communion. You keep that closeness but
[1:19:59] don't find yourself away. The day the
[1:20:03] only thing that will cause you to go far
[1:20:05] away from me it's sin.
[1:20:08] And we know that statement. Sin will
[1:20:11] take you further
[1:20:14] further than you ever thought you will
[1:20:18] be.
[1:20:19] It will keep you longer
[1:20:22] than you ever thought to stay. Yeah. And
[1:20:26] some people add it will it will cost you
[1:20:29] greater than you ever thought of paying.
[1:20:34] And it all started with a little
[1:20:36] sin. It all started with doubting the
[1:20:39] word of God. But what that caused? All
[1:20:43] the war that you see. We have wonderful
[1:20:46] believers from Ukraine. You know,
[1:20:48] regardless of what side you might be,
[1:20:51] there is war. There is casuality, people
[1:20:55] dying, you know, a lot of people
[1:20:57] coming orphaned and all the craziness
[1:21:01] that might be in politics and all the
[1:21:03] lying, all the stealing, all the
[1:21:05] killing, it's all started with something
[1:21:07] very small as rejecting the word of God,
[1:21:11] as doubting the word of God. as little
[1:21:13] that was uh that ever uh uh uh was uh
[1:21:17] applied by humankind, it made a chasm
[1:21:21] and every day it's becoming bigger and
[1:21:25] bigger and far and far. Let me say this
[1:21:29] to all of
[1:21:30] us. Don't dwell in sin, right? But but
[1:21:35] what I'm saying that God will not
[1:21:37] condemn you for being a sinner, right?
[1:21:41] Because you are a sinner. You born and
[1:21:43] shape in iniquity. He will never condemn
[1:21:45] us to be a sinner. But he will condemn
[1:21:48] us to remain in sinner. Because what
[1:21:51] happen when you remain in that sin? When
[1:21:54] you remain in that condition, what it
[1:21:56] does? It keep pushing God away from you.
[1:21:59] Pushing God away from you. Pushing God
[1:22:01] away from you. The thing that you
[1:22:03] thought that I will never do that. I
[1:22:05] will never get to that position. I will
[1:22:08] never do such and so and so thing. Trust
[1:22:11] me, the longer you remain, the longer
[1:22:14] you remain in sin, the longer you become
[1:22:16] familiar with it, what it does, it
[1:22:18] pushes the nature away. Oh God, the
[1:22:20] nature of God start keeping being away.
[1:22:22] being away. You know, you will come to
[1:22:24] church once and then you know you let
[1:22:26] startle going to church maybe once a
[1:22:28] month and then you might or you become
[1:22:30] so acquainted with it that one day
[1:22:34] church will become like something that
[1:22:36] you don't want to think about.
[1:22:40] And they ask you how did you get to that
[1:22:42] condition? I don't know but it start
[1:22:44] with sin and that's the only thing that
[1:22:47] will cause the
[1:22:48] gap between men and God. That's right.
[1:22:52] But let me go even ahead of
[1:22:56] myself, there is a solution for that.
[1:22:59] Amen. Amen. No matter how far you can
[1:23:03] go, no matter how low you might find
[1:23:05] yourself in, I'm telling you this
[1:23:07] morning that there is it's never been
[1:23:09] late. It's not too late. There is a gap.
[1:23:12] There is a bridge. There is a
[1:23:14] connection. There is something that can
[1:23:16] always bring you back because the hands
[1:23:19] of the father is always big enough to
[1:23:21] take his children back. He's always big
[1:23:24] enough to reach out. He will do whatever
[1:23:26] he can to reach out that one uh sheep
[1:23:31] that left. He will left all the 100 to
[1:23:34] go after that one sheep. Don't wonder
[1:23:36] the condition. If you find yourself in
[1:23:38] that condition, it's never too late. All
[1:23:41] you just have to do is say, "Lord, I'm
[1:23:43] standing here in his presence. I feel a
[1:23:45] condemnation in my heart. Yeah, I'm
[1:23:47] coming home. Let me let you reach out to
[1:23:50] me now. I'm coming to the cross. I'm
[1:23:53] coming to you. I want to be reunited in
[1:23:55] fellowship with you back again because
[1:23:58] that's the nature of God. Amen. Now,
[1:24:01] back to our story here. Adam, he
[1:24:05] committed sin alongside with his wife.
[1:24:07] And what happened?
[1:24:10] Every time you do
[1:24:12] sin, it makes you to want to justify
[1:24:15] yourself.
[1:24:17] Yeah. You know, you you you you're not
[1:24:19] ready to accept and to say, "Oh, I was
[1:24:23] wrong in this." You know, you want to
[1:24:25] justify yourself. You want to explain
[1:24:27] things up.
[1:24:29] But what really touched me when I was
[1:24:31] doing this study, even though Adam was
[1:24:33] the one that went away, even though Adam
[1:24:36] was the one that went away from God, the
[1:24:38] one that broke the covenant, it was not
[1:24:40] God, but it was
[1:24:41] man, Adam, as soon as he did that, he
[1:24:45] ran away from God. Amen. What what I'm
[1:24:48] saying this message I'm going to read
[1:24:50] two quotes here in a message
[1:24:55] presume you say but brother
[1:24:58] sister can we afford to take any chance
[1:25:02] on any one little thing just no matter
[1:25:05] what it is guilt of least is guilt of
[1:25:09] the whole. You must be clean wash in the
[1:25:14] blood of the lamb. Amen. The least sin
[1:25:18] will keep you right away from God. Amen.
[1:25:23] The smallest one will be good enough to
[1:25:27] make the gap between you and God. And he
[1:25:31] said many times we Christian here, we
[1:25:35] try to justify ourself. That's true. You
[1:25:38] say, well, this isn't very
[1:25:40] bad, but the least sin should be
[1:25:44] confessed. That's right.
[1:25:47] Always, no matter what, how little it
[1:25:50] looks to you, it's sin in the sight of
[1:25:53] God.
[1:25:55] Look how little the first sin was. But
[1:25:58] look what it did to the human
[1:26:01] race. When the first sin was committed,
[1:26:05] look at the difference when the message
[1:26:08] came to heaven that your son has fallen.
[1:26:13] Imagine what was the heart of God. Yeah.
[1:26:17] As he was thinking in a perfection,
[1:26:19] everything was working fine. And now the
[1:26:22] news came, your son has committed sin.
[1:26:26] Your son has run away. Your son is no
[1:26:29] longer there. You know, you can put a
[1:26:31] daughter there. Your daughter is no
[1:26:33] longer there. Your daughter is is run
[1:26:35] away. I I'm pretty sure for a parent,
[1:26:38] for any father, any mother, he will feel
[1:26:41] a hurt in his heart. Yeah. A genuine
[1:26:44] parents will feel something like, you
[1:26:47] know, it's a anger toward the enemy.
[1:26:50] What can I do to get my son back? I
[1:26:54] don't need any advice. I don't need anyh
[1:26:56] anyone to pump me up. But the father
[1:26:59] nature will speak up. Amen. What can I
[1:27:02] do? My son has fallen. My son has gone
[1:27:04] away. My daughter's gone away. What can
[1:27:07] I do? I will do anything that I can. I
[1:27:09] will pay anything that I can pay to be
[1:27:12] able to come and reach out to my son, to
[1:27:14] be able to come to reach out to my
[1:27:16] daughter. You are parents. Some of us
[1:27:18] here are parents. You will feel that
[1:27:19] desire. You will do anything in any uh
[1:27:22] uh any animal kingdom. Yes, sir. You
[1:27:25] don't mess up with a with a little one.
[1:27:28] You don't mess up, you know, from the uh
[1:27:30] you you can play around with little
[1:27:32] chicken. I raise chickens. You can play
[1:27:34] around with. But when they have the
[1:27:35] little one, you don't want to mess up
[1:27:37] with the mother.
[1:27:39] As soon as you trying to grab, the
[1:27:40] mother will show you all the power that
[1:27:42] she has. She does not care how tall you
[1:27:45] are. She does not care how strong you
[1:27:47] are. She's ready to take you. She's
[1:27:50] ready to fight. And you don't want to do
[1:27:52] that to a mommy bear. You don't want to
[1:27:55] do that to any other animal because they
[1:27:57] will give up all that they can because
[1:28:00] it's a nature. I will do all that I can
[1:28:03] so that I can reach out to my child, so
[1:28:05] I can reach out to my daughter. So I can
[1:28:07] reach out to my son. The father will
[1:28:10] speak, the mother will grown. Now you
[1:28:13] take that desire, you multiply it. But
[1:28:16] tell millions of time possible. That was
[1:28:19] the nature of God. Amen. When he heard
[1:28:22] my son lost his position, my son lost
[1:28:25] his control. My son lost whatever
[1:28:27] position that he was that the the h the
[1:28:30] condition that he was. He did not think
[1:28:33] twice.
[1:28:34] He didn't guess. He didn't need anyone
[1:28:37] to advise him. But there was a groaning,
[1:28:40] a genuine groaning of a father. Where is
[1:28:44] my
[1:28:45] son? As soon as he heard the news, I
[1:28:48] believe he run quickly. He came down to
[1:28:51] the earth. Maybe not an appointed time.
[1:28:54] Maybe he went a little early than he
[1:28:56] usually come. He came down and all
[1:28:59] throughout the the the Garden of Eden
[1:29:03] there was a
[1:29:04] groaning groaning lamenting cry of a
[1:29:08] father in pain. Amen. It was not just
[1:29:11] Adam where are you? But it was Adam
[1:29:14] where thou maybe tears will come. Eve
[1:29:18] where are you? Adam where are you? You
[1:29:21] have left the place of communion. You
[1:29:23] have left the place that you were
[1:29:24] supposed to be. What happened my son?
[1:29:26] What happened my daughter? Where are
[1:29:28] you? And God went after Adam.
[1:29:34] It was not the son that went after the
[1:29:37] father. It was not the daughter that
[1:29:39] went after the father. But the desire
[1:29:41] that was inside of God, he strip all
[1:29:44] heaven. And he say, I'm going to come.
[1:29:47] Where is my son? Where is my child? I
[1:29:51] will I will look everywhere. I will go
[1:29:53] through the trees. I will go to every
[1:29:55] place. I want to find my son. I'm able
[1:29:58] to do whatever I can to restore my child
[1:30:02] to his ought to be condition. That's
[1:30:04] right. And at that moment as he was
[1:30:07] crying, he heard a voice of a lost
[1:30:10] child.
[1:30:12] I heard your
[1:30:15] voice and I'm
[1:30:17] afraid I'm running away. Amen.
[1:30:22] That's all that the sin will do. It does
[1:30:24] not matter how hard you can hear the
[1:30:26] voice but the sin will just keep pushing
[1:30:28] you away keep pushing you away and then
[1:30:30] you will try to find out solution for
[1:30:32] your own trying to build up some apron
[1:30:36] trying to build up something to make you
[1:30:38] feel good but I'm say well it looks like
[1:30:42] Adam ought to have been running around
[1:30:46] through the garden hollering oh father
[1:30:48] oh father where are you that was
[1:30:51] supposed to be the case because he's the
[1:30:53] one that lost. But no, it was not the
[1:30:56] case. But Adam
[1:30:58] went and hid himself. And it was just
[1:31:02] vice
[1:31:04] versa. It was the father calling, "Son,
[1:31:08] son, where are
[1:31:10] you? Daughter, where are you?" It's a
[1:31:15] cry of the father. It's a longing that
[1:31:17] comes from a heart. You nobody can
[1:31:19] explain it. You have to experience it.
[1:31:22] You have to leave it. And that's what
[1:31:24] the condition of God. That's right. He
[1:31:27] was in a condition. I will do whatever I
[1:31:30] can to bring back my child because
[1:31:32] that's my seed. That's my son. I'm going
[1:31:35] to do whatever I can to bring him back
[1:31:37] to the condition. Amen. And we know he's
[1:31:41] the one that reach out and they both
[1:31:44] came. And as they were coming, you know,
[1:31:47] we know the stories. And God look around
[1:31:50] and he said well I have to be remain
[1:31:52] truth and just with my word. The day you
[1:31:56] will sin the day you will die. Amen. And
[1:32:00] he made sure he for he was just in his
[1:32:04] judgment.
[1:32:06] But as man was living now, they eat the
[1:32:09] tree of life of good and evil and they
[1:32:13] were away from God in the condition that
[1:32:16] they do not know if they will ever come
[1:32:18] back
[1:32:19] again. He put the angels to guard the
[1:32:23] doors. In another way, there is no way
[1:32:26] back. The door is clos is closed. The
[1:32:30] bridge uh the gap is made. There is no
[1:32:33] way back. Adam, the day you will eat,
[1:32:36] the day we will die. You know, one day
[1:32:39] in the eyes of God is like 1,000 years.
[1:32:42] That's right. Adam live 900 and
[1:32:45] something. Never make it to one day.
[1:32:49] Because God say the day you will eat,
[1:32:52] the day you will die. No one ever made
[1:32:55] it to that one day. That's right. That's
[1:32:58] right. Because God's word remain the
[1:33:00] same. Amen. Amen. The day you eat, the
[1:33:03] day you will die. Amen. I just want to
[1:33:05] go ahead of myself,
[1:33:07] but thanks be to God. At the opening of
[1:33:11] the word, at the last age, as God is
[1:33:14] sending us the word to reveal the seal,
[1:33:17] to reveal the word and giving back the
[1:33:20] authority that Adam has lost in a garden
[1:33:22] of Eden. Now the day that we eat, the
[1:33:26] day that we will leave. Now there was
[1:33:28] the same angel that was closing out the
[1:33:31] door so that men cannot reach into the
[1:33:34] the tree of life to eat the tree of life
[1:33:37] and to live for eternal. Those same
[1:33:39] angel now they are washing you up. Go
[1:33:42] eat the tree of life. The tree of life
[1:33:44] is open to you. The message has been
[1:33:46] given to you. The word has been given to
[1:33:48] you. You can eat from the tree of this
[1:33:50] life. And the day you will eat that, the
[1:33:53] day you will die. That's why this
[1:33:55] message, the loudian church age is
[1:33:58] washing his ass into the millennium.
[1:34:01] Amen. The very people, the same rest of
[1:34:04] Adam that died for less than one day
[1:34:07] before God. Those are the same people.
[1:34:10] Out of the message that God has given
[1:34:12] them, they will be able to live for
[1:34:14] 1,000 years. That's right. Here on earth
[1:34:17] to rejoice with with one another to
[1:34:20] fellowship with God in a restored Eden
[1:34:24] in a restored place of God where the
[1:34:27] angel can come. The fellowship will be
[1:34:29] restored where we can say before the
[1:34:31] enemy, "Oh death, where is your sting?"
[1:34:34] Amen. Oh death, where is your sting? By
[1:34:37] the grace of God, we will live more than
[1:34:40] one day. Amen. We will live more than
[1:34:42] 1,000 years because of the grace of God.
[1:34:45] But let's go back to our to our story
[1:34:47] now.
[1:34:49] They all get kicked away. The gap was
[1:34:52] made. Oh my goodness. Well, the time
[1:34:55] just fly like you don't know. I trying
[1:34:59] to make it very short and close.
[1:35:02] So they went away and God was there. As
[1:35:07] they were leaving, they were chest from
[1:35:10] the presence of God. I can imagine Adam
[1:35:13] crying, holding his wife, his sweetheart
[1:35:16] on his side. They're crying. What did we
[1:35:19] do? We could have known better. You know
[1:35:22] what? Now we're so lost. You know, there
[1:35:25] is no way back. We don't know what's
[1:35:27] going to happen. They were crying and
[1:35:29] they were going just by the time where
[1:35:31] they were about to leave the dead the
[1:35:33] door. God called them. Adam, come back.
[1:35:37] Let me tell you something before you go.
[1:35:40] I know that you sin. I know that you
[1:35:43] committed this. I killed a lamb to serve
[1:35:46] as an atonement. But let me tell you,
[1:35:49] you're not going there without a
[1:35:50] promise. I'm giving you a promise, Adam,
[1:35:54] that your condition will come back
[1:35:57] again. Amen. As you live in this place,
[1:36:00] you're not gonna go away from him
[1:36:02] forever. But I want to give you a
[1:36:04] promise, Adam. Into you there will be
[1:36:07] the seed of the woman. He will crush the
[1:36:10] head of the serpent. You go with that
[1:36:13] promise, Adam. There is a way back. Adam
[1:36:16] opened the door. The door was open and
[1:36:18] the door was closed. Amen. But they left
[1:36:21] the place with that promise in life. One
[1:36:25] day the seed will come and we will go
[1:36:28] back to our place. One day the seed will
[1:36:31] come and the old fellowship will come
[1:36:33] back again. One day the seed will come
[1:36:36] and will restore us back to where we
[1:36:38] supposed to be. Adam as if were living
[1:36:42] there. They were living with that
[1:36:43] promise. There is a bridge. Amen. There
[1:36:46] is a bridge for human race. There is a
[1:36:50] hope for human race. All these things we
[1:36:52] can be crying right now but we waiting
[1:36:55] for one day the seed of God will come.
[1:36:58] One day the seed of God will come and is
[1:37:01] going to restore us back again to the
[1:37:04] communion that we used to have with our
[1:37:06] father. He left the place with that
[1:37:08] promise. And guess what happened? The
[1:37:11] enemy, the devil also heard that. you
[1:37:14] know Bam preach a whole message of u
[1:37:17] um uh the mighty conqueror and he kind
[1:37:20] of gave a narration on it and he said
[1:37:22] the enemy heard
[1:37:24] that and all from Adam he was like well
[1:37:29] there is a seed that's coming I am going
[1:37:32] to fight for that seed he was searching
[1:37:35] for that seed you know Abel was born and
[1:37:40] by what I'm saying he went and he killed
[1:37:41] Abel he thought he got the seed but he
[1:37:45] did not. Seph was born. He went oh this
[1:37:49] one was born and they were born and the
[1:37:52] prophet came along. They were all born
[1:37:54] and people will come and they do all
[1:37:56] that. Satan was busy because he does not
[1:37:59] want man to go back to the condition
[1:38:02] that he was before. He will do whatever
[1:38:05] he can to prevent you from reaching out
[1:38:08] to God. He will do whatever he can to
[1:38:11] stop you to stretch out your hand. If he
[1:38:13] has to fill you with sin, he will fill
[1:38:16] you with sin. If he have to pull out
[1:38:18] destruction, he will bring destruction.
[1:38:20] But as far as you will not have time to
[1:38:22] read your Bible, as far as you will not
[1:38:25] have time to pray, as long as you don't
[1:38:29] have time to come to church, Satan can
[1:38:31] do whatever he can. Amen. To prevent you
[1:38:34] to have fellowship with God. Hallelujah.
[1:38:37] And now we know many years happened.
[1:38:40] Just to go uh try to make it short
[1:38:42] now. And here come the time of the
[1:38:45] promise. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. The angel
[1:38:49] came to Mary. It's Easter, so we're
[1:38:51] going to speak of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:38:54] Amen.
[1:38:56] And and Mary came and you heard the
[1:38:58] news. You know, you uh out of you come a
[1:39:02] child, you will be called Emanuel. You
[1:39:05] will call him Jesus. And Isaiah
[1:39:07] prophesied. All the prophet of the Old
[1:39:09] Testament, they live with the hope. Yes
[1:39:13] sir. They might be one day. They will
[1:39:16] come to pass a day where all these
[1:39:18] things will come together. Amen. The
[1:39:21] condition that we see now, it's not
[1:39:24] going to remain like this forever. We
[1:39:26] waiting. We longing for the time where
[1:39:29] there will be a bridge. They prophesied
[1:39:32] about that sea to come. They prophesied
[1:39:34] about the coming of the Messiah. All of
[1:39:36] them, they were living with that hope.
[1:39:38] They were living with that desire. One
[1:39:40] of this day, we're going to see this
[1:39:42] coming to pass. And one day, it did
[1:39:45] happen. Amen. Amen. As they were, as she
[1:39:48] was walking there, she received the
[1:39:50] visitation and we all know the story.
[1:39:53] You know, the come the time came, the
[1:39:55] appointed time Jesus was born. And I
[1:39:58] just like the way Bam bring it. I'm just
[1:40:00] going to uh cut it out of my head to
[1:40:03] save some
[1:40:05] time. At the time of his birth, what
[1:40:08] about what I'm saying? There were three
[1:40:10] magi, three wise men, right from the
[1:40:13] east. And the prophet said that those
[1:40:16] three wise men for were the
[1:40:19] representation of the three child of
[1:40:22] Noah. That's right. One of them was
[1:40:24] representing Seth. one another one was
[1:40:27] representing him and another one was
[1:40:30] representing Japet. All the three sons
[1:40:33] of Noah and you and I we know from the
[1:40:36] Bible the three sons of Noah are the one
[1:40:39] that populated the earth. Out of them
[1:40:41] came a race. You know some people trying
[1:40:44] to separate them. You know they say
[1:40:47] probably the African race they have one
[1:40:49] one part. There was the eastern race.
[1:40:52] There was the western race. All of them
[1:40:54] they came out of the three child of
[1:40:57] Noah. Amen. And what about say that
[1:41:00] those three magi they were the perfect
[1:41:04] representation of the child of Noah.
[1:41:06] That's right. There was one that was
[1:41:08] coming representing the race of Japet.
[1:41:12] Another one that coming it was a
[1:41:14] representation of the race of Ham.
[1:41:16] Another one representation of a race of
[1:41:19] Cam. All of them they were there
[1:41:21] representing the three race y of the
[1:41:25] humankind. That's right. All of us we
[1:41:28] were represented there. And now when
[1:41:31] they were coming there they all brought
[1:41:34] the fruit of the labor. They came with
[1:41:36] the gold theh the may and the
[1:41:39] frankincense always the labors of their
[1:41:41] hands things that they getting from the
[1:41:43] earth from whatever place they were. And
[1:41:46] they came all to worship Jesus. And
[1:41:50] Jesus who was the perfect race. Amen. He
[1:41:53] was not from the western. He was not
[1:41:55] from the eastern. He was not from the
[1:41:58] southern. But he was the perfection of
[1:42:00] the race. Why there? And now the three
[1:42:03] sons of Noah, you talk about the race.
[1:42:05] You talk about whatever the catcher, all
[1:42:08] of them where we're all united into one,
[1:42:11] we come to worship. This is the only
[1:42:14] race that's going to bridge all our
[1:42:15] races. This is the only race that's
[1:42:18] going to bridge the child of no of of
[1:42:21] Adam back to the relationship that they
[1:42:23] supposed to have with God. And he stood
[1:42:26] there. Stood there. One bring the gold.
[1:42:29] Maybe representing some area. Another
[1:42:32] one bring the frankincense. Another one
[1:42:34] bring the M. All of them came with some
[1:42:37] gift to show that you are worthy. Amen.
[1:42:41] We might have our wars. We might have
[1:42:44] our cultural wars. We might have our
[1:42:46] differences. We might have, you know,
[1:42:48] the world is going crazy. This country
[1:42:50] come up and rule the other one. This
[1:42:52] other country come up and rule the
[1:42:54] other. This culture come and control the
[1:42:56] other. But in Jesus came the perfection.
[1:42:59] Amen. That man can come and say all of
[1:43:02] our differences of this world they come
[1:43:04] into one accord. There is a salvation
[1:43:07] there. There is a place of peace. There
[1:43:09] is a place of bridge. Amen. To bridge
[1:43:11] all of us all together that was in the
[1:43:14] person of Jesus Christ. In him all the
[1:43:17] rest can be coming together. In him all
[1:43:20] the culture can be coming together.
[1:43:22] That's why the Bible say every tongue we
[1:43:24] confess. Every nation will confess.
[1:43:27] Every mind, every thought, every nation,
[1:43:29] every kingdom they will come into one
[1:43:31] accord. Jesus Christ is the Lord. He's
[1:43:34] the king of king. He's the lord of lord.
[1:43:38] out of him all the different people they
[1:43:41] found themselves into. Amen. And now the
[1:43:44] children of of of the the three major
[1:43:47] they represented that to show that
[1:43:49] Christ was the bridge amen between
[1:43:52] humankind and God. Amen. And we know the
[1:43:56] purpose of his coming. He did not just
[1:43:58] come for the sake of coming. He did not
[1:44:01] just come to heal the sick. He did not
[1:44:03] just come to do miracles. But he came
[1:44:05] for a purpose because he was the lamb of
[1:44:08] God. Amen. That was laid before the
[1:44:12] foundation of the world. And we know
[1:44:14] that day of Calvary. Coming to my close
[1:44:17] now. As he was going there in
[1:44:19] Gethsemane. Yeah, that's it. The Bible
[1:44:22] said that the
[1:44:25] sweat of his bro were coming as blood.
[1:44:30] Mhm. And the medical condition of that
[1:44:33] it's a person who so anxious. Yeah.
[1:44:36] Someone is such a a desperation like a
[1:44:40] combination of fear, a combination of
[1:44:42] sorrow, a combination of all the emotion
[1:44:45] that you can humanly put into a human
[1:44:48] being. It will go into a person and
[1:44:52] break the blood
[1:44:53] vessels. Blood was coming out of it. He
[1:44:57] was crying and say, "Father, father, if
[1:44:59] it was possible, take this away from
[1:45:02] me." But nevertheless, your will be
[1:45:04] done, not my will. And as he approached
[1:45:08] that place, as he was going there, we
[1:45:10] know all I'm just trying to save my time
[1:45:12] here. I see the time glowing faster. As
[1:45:15] as as he was going there throughout his
[1:45:17] life, the enemy will watch his life. He
[1:45:21] always had a question. Is that that seed
[1:45:24] that was promised to come to pass? Is
[1:45:27] that that seed that's supposed to come
[1:45:29] and to bridge the human race back to
[1:45:33] God? We know he tempted Jesus three
[1:45:36] times and his final temptation. If you
[1:45:39] are a child of God because he did not
[1:45:41] know himself, if you are a son of God, I
[1:45:44] see you live holy. I see you live, you
[1:45:47] know, a righteous life. I see the way
[1:45:49] you conducted yourself. If you are a son
[1:45:51] of God, are you the son of God? Are you
[1:45:53] that seed that's supposed to come? And
[1:45:55] Satan was so hh out of himself that he
[1:45:59] was so convinced, I have to kill him
[1:46:02] just like I killed the other saints. I
[1:46:05] have to make end of his life just like I
[1:46:07] did the other sense. And as he was there
[1:46:10] going to the agony, the pain, but the
[1:46:13] Bam said they smash him, they bruise
[1:46:15] him, they jump upon him like a bunch of
[1:46:18] wool upon his life. They crushed him.
[1:46:20] They beat him up. And Satan was trying
[1:46:23] to see find out is that the seed of God?
[1:46:25] Is that the seed of God? And when he was
[1:46:28] there at the
[1:46:30] cross, the Bible say all the angels, no
[1:46:34] one know what was going
[1:46:36] on. But when I'm said that the angel
[1:46:39] could
[1:46:40] rush and they looked to Jesus who had
[1:46:44] all the power. He said to the soldiers
[1:46:47] that I can call just one legion. That's
[1:46:50] right. And they will they will destroy
[1:46:53] you
[1:46:54] completely, but my life I'm laying it
[1:46:57] down. You are not taking it out of me.
[1:47:00] But the angel will come maybe trying to
[1:47:03] rescue him, but he came for a purpose.
[1:47:06] Amen. All that was in the mind of God
[1:47:09] before the foundation of the world has
[1:47:12] to come to pass. Amen. God who was in
[1:47:15] what side here? Man who was in this side
[1:47:18] here. There had to be a hand that we
[1:47:20] stretch out to bridge God to humankind.
[1:47:24] Amen. And he live for that life. And he
[1:47:27] said for this purpose did I live my life
[1:47:29] for I live my life for this time. I live
[1:47:33] my life for this moment. Amen. It's the
[1:47:36] greatest moment of the history of
[1:47:38] humankind. is the greatest time of the
[1:47:41] history of the plan of redemption. As he
[1:47:44] was standing there, Satan came this the
[1:47:47] sting of of death came. He anointed that
[1:47:50] that Roman uh soldier and he came with
[1:47:54] the the uh the the
[1:47:55] the
[1:47:58] spear and the piece inside. Yeah. Amen.
[1:48:02] As the bee was coming, all that just was
[1:48:06] worrying just come at me. Come at me.
[1:48:08] come and get me. Satan did not know how
[1:48:11] dumb the devil can be. He will look
[1:48:13] around. He see Jesus crying and he's
[1:48:15] like, man, he's just a man. He's he's
[1:48:17] not God. And then he see Jesus coming
[1:48:19] and speak. Lazarus come forth. He's
[1:48:21] like, oh my goodness, who's that person?
[1:48:23] And he's like, no man, maybe that would
[1:48:24] be God. And then he see Jesus
[1:48:27] complaining this way. Oh no, he's just a
[1:48:29] man. He's not a God. And then Satan was
[1:48:31] there in all the question in his mind
[1:48:33] thinking, is that a man? Is that God? Is
[1:48:36] that the seed of God? Is that the one
[1:48:37] that was promised? But I'm just going to
[1:48:39] kill him. I'm just going to kill him.
[1:48:40] And he went and he do his mistake in
[1:48:43] that very final day. Amen. They piss his
[1:48:46] side. Amen. But but I'm saying that out
[1:48:48] of that side, the bride came forth. It
[1:48:51] was that m it was that strike, that
[1:48:54] final strike that Jesus was waiting for
[1:48:57] for the bride to come forth. Out of his
[1:49:00] side came water. Amen. Came the blood.
[1:49:03] That's right. And he leaded the ghost.
[1:49:05] Amen. Amen. Another prophet pick up that
[1:49:09] and he say all of a sudden the devil
[1:49:11] look he saw Jesus coming because all
[1:49:15] those that die they will go to one place
[1:49:18] the sentence anything that you are you
[1:49:20] are subject to death you're going to die
[1:49:22] and Satan look and he said well I
[1:49:25] thought again
[1:49:28] and was walking there going just like
[1:49:31] any other s are supposed to go and Satan
[1:49:34] looked at him and he
[1:49:35] Man, that's you now. I thought when I
[1:49:38] killed Adam, I when I killed Abel, I
[1:49:41] thought I got you. But that was not you.
[1:49:44] I thought when I killed I I killed
[1:49:45] Moses, I thought I got you. I thought
[1:49:48] when I killed Mo David, I thought I got
[1:49:50] you. I thought when I killed Abraham,
[1:49:52] all the other prophet, I thought I got
[1:49:54] you. Now here you are. You are in my
[1:49:57] domain. You are in my kingdom. You my
[1:50:00] You are just like the rest of them. You
[1:50:02] die just like the rest of them. And he
[1:50:04] was looking at him and he say, "Satan,
[1:50:08] my blood is still wet at the cross. I am
[1:50:10] the virgin born son of God. I am not
[1:50:14] just like one of them. I am the true
[1:50:16] seed of God that was supposed to come
[1:50:19] and take over." And the boy said that he
[1:50:22] kicked him onto the pit and he fall
[1:50:24] belong. He grabbed the keys of hell and
[1:50:26] drove and he went he opened the door.
[1:50:29] Amen. Amen. What happened in that day
[1:50:32] when people were crying over on that
[1:50:34] side? There was a rejoice. There was a
[1:50:36] jubilee over on this side. But I'm say
[1:50:39] all of a sudden Abraham was the face
[1:50:42] that came. And he look around and he say
[1:50:45] Sarah
[1:50:47] come. This is the man that I always tell
[1:50:50] you. I recognize him. That's the man
[1:50:53] that I saw. And then as Sarah was
[1:50:55] coming, as Isaac was coming, as Jacob
[1:50:58] was coming, they all came. They see the
[1:51:00] man. They see the son of God. They see
[1:51:02] the true bridge that was supposed to
[1:51:05] reunite human race to God himself. Amen.
[1:51:09] And Daniel look around. Daniel in his
[1:51:12] time look and he said that's exactly the
[1:51:15] stone that I saw that was coming out of
[1:51:18] no help and that break all the statue
[1:51:21] that break all the mountain and he came
[1:51:24] to worship him. Ezekiel could have
[1:51:26] looked and he said that's the will of
[1:51:28] the wheel. All the prophet look around
[1:51:30] they saw Jesus as he was revealing
[1:51:33] himself to them. I can imagine Job who
[1:51:37] went through all the the trials. He went
[1:51:39] through the pains of this life. He lost
[1:51:41] his family. He lost his children. He he
[1:51:44] went through the sickness and
[1:51:45] everything. When all the pain was coming
[1:51:48] onto him, he look and he say even though
[1:51:51] I might not be healed in this flesh, I
[1:51:54] know my redeemer will live. I know one
[1:51:58] day I shall see him face to face. I know
[1:52:01] my redeemer live and on that day he look
[1:52:05] Job look around and he said that's my
[1:52:07] redeemer. That's the one I was talking
[1:52:09] about. I told you guys that I know he
[1:52:12] will rise up again one day and all the
[1:52:15] saints came. They came along and Jesus
[1:52:17] could call them come up Adam come up
[1:52:20] Abel. Come up you Abraham. Come up all
[1:52:23] you saints. You are free from now on.
[1:52:26] This dungeon is all closed. These things
[1:52:29] is all over now. Now let's march on to
[1:52:33] the place where you supposed to be. But
[1:52:35] what I'm saying they all were watching.
[1:52:37] They were all maring to the pearly gate.
[1:52:40] They were all maring to that place that
[1:52:42] city that city that's who who's whose
[1:52:46] build and maker is God himself. They
[1:52:49] were all maring to that pearly gate and
[1:52:52] the gate was closed. The angel was
[1:52:55] standing there. The gate was closed
[1:52:58] because they receive order to keep the
[1:53:00] ground closed. No man can get access to
[1:53:03] that. And what I'm saying is they were
[1:53:05] there. The voice came from the
[1:53:09] gate. the the the scent of all they were
[1:53:12] marching and they cried to the gate to
[1:53:14] the angel open up all ye gates
[1:53:18] be open and let the king of king let the
[1:53:23] lord of all come in. Amen. And the angel
[1:53:26] look they said we never heard that kind
[1:53:28] of cry before. Who is that king of
[1:53:31] kings? Who is that lord of lord? And
[1:53:34] then the they sent the old statement
[1:53:36] sent the cry out. They said Jesus Christ
[1:53:39] the king of king the lord of lord the
[1:53:42] the glor the the the the the the sin of
[1:53:45] Adam
[1:53:47] the one that was called that was
[1:53:49] prepared to make a bridge between men.
[1:53:52] To make a bridge between you and I.
[1:53:54] Hallelujah. The angel could have not
[1:53:56] contained themsel. They opened the gate
[1:53:59] and all the sat can come in the gate
[1:54:01] that was closed before. The bridge that
[1:54:03] was closed before. Now because of the
[1:54:05] close, the gate was open. The access was
[1:54:09] open. They all reach out to that
[1:54:11] dimension. The dimension that was in
[1:54:15] many days before, many years before,
[1:54:17] something that was impossible. But they
[1:54:19] sent all they reach out to that
[1:54:21] dimension. And by the what I'm saying as
[1:54:23] the old came in he placed by the gate
[1:54:27] the old rug the cross. Amen. So that
[1:54:29] every man that can come in the gate they
[1:54:32] will recognize that he is the king of
[1:54:34] kings. The cross became the reference
[1:54:37] for all of our problems. Amen. All the
[1:54:40] problem of the old testament we found
[1:54:43] the answer at the cross. Amen. Not just
[1:54:46] the Old Testament, all the problem of
[1:54:48] the New Testament, they found the answer
[1:54:51] at the cross. That's right. No matter
[1:54:53] what you can go through in life, all
[1:54:56] that we have to, you look at the cross.
[1:54:59] Amen. Say, Lord, it's not about me, but
[1:55:01] you have made a bridge. Amen. You have
[1:55:03] made a bridge. Things that was
[1:55:05] impossible by the grace of God, they
[1:55:08] became impossible. They became possible
[1:55:10] now. The God that was imaginable, the
[1:55:13] God that couldn't reach, by the grace of
[1:55:16] God, he can reach unto you. Jesus by the
[1:55:19] cross stood as a mediator. Amen. Between
[1:55:23] you and I. Amen. That everything that
[1:55:25] you have desire of in the name of Jesus
[1:55:28] you will find the answer. Amen. Every
[1:55:30] pain that you will go through by the
[1:55:32] cross you can find the answer. Any
[1:55:35] sickness that can be by the cross you
[1:55:38] will find the answer. Amen. You know
[1:55:40] many time people will look for advices
[1:55:42] here. You will look for solution here.
[1:55:44] But God before the foundation of the
[1:55:46] world he had made one solution. Amen.
[1:55:49] For all of our problems, for all of our
[1:55:52] sorrow, as he was giving up the ghost,
[1:55:54] he screamed from a loud voice, it is
[1:55:57] finished. What was finished?
[1:56:00] Question of sins were finished. Question
[1:56:04] about anything in your mind was
[1:56:06] finished. You talk about struggles, it
[1:56:08] was finished. You talk about pain, it is
[1:56:11] finished. You talk about sickness, it is
[1:56:14] finished. All the problems that we might
[1:56:16] have, all the problem that humankind
[1:56:18] might even have in the future, they all
[1:56:21] finished. We found our answer at the
[1:56:24] sacrifice of the cross. I remember the
[1:56:26] story that brought what I'm saying as
[1:56:28] I'm closing here. Musician can come.
[1:56:32] He was talking about this uh in the time
[1:56:34] of World War II and that story really
[1:56:37] struck me and he said during the war the
[1:56:41] ally there was a group of allied
[1:56:44] soldiers they were pinned down in one
[1:56:46] area. They did not know what to do. They
[1:56:50] were out of
[1:56:51] ammunition. They were no way out. They
[1:56:54] were stuck. They were they were the the
[1:56:58] the the they were all in a position
[1:57:00] where everything was lost. They did not
[1:57:02] know what to
[1:57:03] do. And as they were there, the German
[1:57:07] soldier that was the enemy camp, they
[1:57:09] start targeting them. They were shooting
[1:57:11] at them, but they were pinned down. They
[1:57:13] they did not know they did not have any
[1:57:15] ammunition. They did not know how to how
[1:57:17] to escape from there. So, one of them
[1:57:21] remember if you can play uh what a
[1:57:23] friend we have in Jesus. I believe it's
[1:57:26] 5:22 of D. I
[1:57:28] think one of them
[1:57:31] remember that he had a little
[1:57:34] pigeon, a little mascot. Yeah, that's
[1:57:37] right. And you know, we have no no
[1:57:41] ammunition, our human effort, our
[1:57:44] soldier skills, it's over. That's right.
[1:57:47] There is nothing that we can do. We
[1:57:50] cannot reach out. We cannot get out. We
[1:57:53] cannot get help. There is nothing that
[1:57:55] we can do. And I soldier say, I know
[1:57:58] what I'm going to do. I'm going to write
[1:58:00] a little note, a little message, and I
[1:58:04] it in the feet of this little
[1:58:08] pigeon. I know pigeons are faithful.
[1:58:11] They always go back home. He has a
[1:58:14] little mate over there that he will do
[1:58:16] whatever he can to get to the mate.
[1:58:18] Amen. And where the mate is, that's
[1:58:22] where the camp is. Amen. That's where
[1:58:24] the our reinforcement is. And he wrote a
[1:58:28] little note. We are pinned down in such
[1:58:30] and such a location. We are out of
[1:58:33] ammunition. We use up all of our skills,
[1:58:35] our military skills. We don't know what
[1:58:37] to
[1:58:39] do. In a few hours, if we don't get any
[1:58:42] help, we all going to be massacred. We
[1:58:46] all going to be
[1:58:48] killed. and he tied that little note on
[1:58:51] the foot of that little dove and he let
[1:58:54] him
[1:58:55] loose. That was something that was done
[1:58:57] commonly back then. One of the German
[1:59:00] soldiers saw that what happened and he
[1:59:03] say they're sending a message to get
[1:59:06] some
[1:59:07] reinforcement and we need to shoot that
[1:59:09] dove because as soon as they get the
[1:59:12] message over there help we come the way
[1:59:15] and we will be in a very terrible
[1:59:17] condition. Now the enemy change the
[1:59:20] target they start shooting that little
[1:59:23] dove.
[1:59:25] But what I'm saying, maybe one of them
[1:59:27] hit him with some bullet and and chop
[1:59:30] his
[1:59:31] wings. But that little dove was so
[1:59:34] faithful. That's right. With the blood
[1:59:37] going down. That's right. With all the
[1:59:39] pain that he was going through, but he
[1:59:41] said, "I have to die there at the
[1:59:44] camp. I have to go meet my mate. I have
[1:59:47] to go where is." And he keep pushing,
[1:59:51] flying with everything that he has,
[1:59:52] flying and giving the best that he has.
[1:59:55] He will use all of his strength to
[1:59:58] trying to get to the destination. The
[2:00:00] German soldier came and shot him again.
[2:00:03] They all target that that that that
[2:00:06] dove. But with all the bloods, all the
[2:00:10] hurts, all the the the the condition
[2:00:13] that he was, he fell in a camp. Amen.
[2:00:16] With the message. Amen.
[2:00:18] He fell in a camp with the message.
[2:00:21] That's right. Amen. Amen. That's right.
[2:00:23] But but I'm say that was a great dove.
[2:00:25] Yes, sir. But oh brother, Amen. to you
[2:00:29] and I there was a great a dove way much
[2:00:33] greater than that dove.
[2:00:35] when he came down from heaven with all
[2:00:38] that was in him, all the blessing that
[2:00:41] God has, all the goodness that God has.
[2:00:44] You talk about family trouble, he had
[2:00:47] solution for that. You talk about
[2:00:49] sickness, he had solution for that. You
[2:00:51] talk about problems, he had solution for
[2:00:53] that. You talk about Holy Ghost, he had
[2:00:56] solution for that.
[2:00:58] And all he was going
[2:01:01] up the enemy
[2:01:04] camp came after him. They beat him. They
[2:01:08] torture
[2:01:09] him. They did all that they can because
[2:01:13] he had on him the message. That's right.
[2:01:16] The prayers of the saints in the Old
[2:01:18] Testament. The prayers of the saint in
[2:01:20] the New Testament. The prayer of the
[2:01:22] saints in the days to come. He was
[2:01:24] holding it wrapped around his foot.
[2:01:27] Amen. At the cross. Amen. And they beat
[2:01:31] him up. They to the they throw themsel
[2:01:34] on him like a bunch of wolves. They
[2:01:37] smash
[2:01:38] him. They bruise
[2:01:41] him. But my friend, my brother and
[2:01:44] sister, he fell in a camp. Amen. With
[2:01:47] the message. Hallelujah. He did not die
[2:01:50] on the ele camp but he died with the
[2:01:53] message. And as he was dying he can
[2:01:56] scream they're all free now. Sickness
[2:01:59] can be healed. The captive can be set
[2:02:02] free. You are in whatever condition you
[2:02:05] might be. You can reach out to God.
[2:02:08] Your problem is not to struggle on your
[2:02:10] own. You are there like that that little
[2:02:15] soldiers. You lost all your am
[2:02:18] ammunitions, all your effort. You use up
[2:02:21] everything that you can. You use up all
[2:02:23] the advices. You use up all the
[2:02:25] solutions. Use up all the medicine. You
[2:02:27] went from one doctor to another doctor.
[2:02:29] You went from one solution to another
[2:02:31] solution. You came to a place where you
[2:02:33] are done. That's right. There is no way
[2:02:36] up. There is no way out. You don't know
[2:02:39] what to do. But let me tell you
[2:02:42] tonight, take your prayer. Amen. go on
[2:02:45] the cross. That's right. Say, "Lord,
[2:02:47] after I've done all that I can, after I
[2:02:50] use up all my resources, after I use up
[2:02:53] everything that I can possibly use, I'm
[2:02:56] coming now." Amen. To the cross. Amen.
[2:02:59] I'm coming with all that I can. To the
[2:03:02] cross. That's right. I am not smart. I
[2:03:04] thought I was smart. I am not smart. I
[2:03:07] thought I knew how to handle this. I
[2:03:09] cannot know. I I just realized now I am
[2:03:12] a
[2:03:13] failure. We all are failures. Yes sir.
[2:03:16] We fail on whatever thing that we might
[2:03:18] have we thought of doing. We thought of
[2:03:20] pursuing or getting. Yes, sir. We fail.
[2:03:23] That's right. But let me tell you
[2:03:24] tonight, this this afternoon, it's not
[2:03:27] too late. Amen. Don't give up yet. There
[2:03:30] is a bridge. Amen. Between you and God.
[2:03:34] There is a bridge between their problem
[2:03:37] and God's solution. And God in his heart
[2:03:40] is so wanted to give you that solution.
[2:03:42] All that you have to do, stop worrying.
[2:03:45] That's right. Stop using up your own
[2:03:47] ability. Come on your knees at the
[2:03:49] cross. Amen. And say, Lord, amen. I'm
[2:03:53] tying my prayer. Amen. At the foot of
[2:03:55] the cross. Amen. I've used up all my
[2:03:58] resources. Now, after all my failure, I
[2:04:01] see how I fail, how I try, how I fail.
[2:04:04] But it's never too late. Hallelujah.
[2:04:06] There is a bridge. Yes, sir. between God
[2:04:08] and me. There is a bridge between you
[2:04:12] and God. There is a bridge between your
[2:04:15] family and God. There is a bridge
[2:04:18] between your your son and God. There is
[2:04:21] a bridge between your daughter and God.
[2:04:24] It's never been late. You come at the
[2:04:27] cross. Say, "Lord, after I use up all
[2:04:29] that I have in my foolish way, I'm just
[2:04:32] surrendering." Oh, I'm coming before you
[2:04:35] at that bridge and I call, oh God, have
[2:04:39] mercy upon me. I'm dying in my
[2:04:41] condition. Have mercy upon me. Have
[2:04:45] mercy on me. And the same God with his
[2:04:48] love, we come and stretch up his hand
[2:04:52] and say, "My daughter, you came to the
[2:04:55] bridge. I'm ready to receive you." Is
[2:04:58] that your desire to this morning? You
[2:05:00] want to stand and say, "Lord Jesus, I'm
[2:05:03] giving myself now." You need the Holy
[2:05:06] Ghost, there is a bridge for the Holy
[2:05:08] Ghost. You need a solution. You need God
[2:05:10] to become personal. But but I'm saying
[2:05:13] if you want more of God, Yes, sir. There
[2:05:16] is always more of God. That's right. For
[2:05:18] you. That's right. The more that you
[2:05:20] think that I want this thing so bad, let
[2:05:22] me tell you, God want that bad for you
[2:05:26] thousands of time than you ever thought.
[2:05:28] Amen. He want your family restored. He
[2:05:32] want your life to be restored. He want
[2:05:34] you to feel He want to fill you with the
[2:05:36] Holy Ghost. He want to give you strength
[2:05:39] in your Christian life to stand and say,
[2:05:42] "Lord, I'm reaching out to the bridge."
[2:05:44] Amen. God bless you. It was a pleasure
[2:05:47] to be with you. God bless you. Brother
[2:05:49] Isaac, if you can come. Amen.
[2:05:56] Amen. If the Lord willing, maybe one day
[2:05:59] we meet again. Amen. But until then, God
[2:06:02] bless you. Amen. Thank you for having
[2:06:04] us. Amen. What I say?
[2:06:11] Amen. You enjoy that? Praise God. Praise
[2:06:14] God. I couldn't help but think um
[2:06:16] Brother Daniel was preaching there when
[2:06:18] he reached down his hand for me. Amen.
[2:06:22] Nothing I could have ever
[2:06:25] done that mighty
[2:06:27] gulf.
[2:06:30] But there's got to be something in you
[2:06:32] to respond that
[2:06:34] seed. Praise the Lord. Let's just sing
[2:06:37] that this morning. Or yeah, this morning
[2:06:40] still.
[2:06:42] [Music]
[2:06:45] Amen.
[2:06:48] [Music]
[2:06:52] Here we go.
[2:06:55] [Music]
[2:06:58] Once my
[2:06:59] soul was
[2:07:02] astray from the
[2:07:05] heavenly
[2:07:07] way and was
[2:07:10] read
[2:07:13] by
[2:07:17] me, but my
[2:07:20] savior
[2:07:22] above gave me
[2:07:24] peace, joy, Joy and
[2:07:27] love when he
[2:07:29] reach down his hand for
[2:07:36] me. When he
[2:07:39] reached down his
[2:07:42] hand for me.
[2:07:48] When he
[2:07:49] reached way
[2:07:51] down for
[2:07:57] me, I was
[2:07:59] lost and
[2:08:01] undone without
[2:08:04] God or his
[2:08:06] son when he
[2:08:09] reached down his
[2:08:11] hand for me. Is that too low?
[2:08:18] I was near in
[2:08:22] despair when he
[2:08:24] came to me
[2:08:27] there and he
[2:08:29] showed me
[2:08:32] I could be
[2:08:34] [Music]
[2:08:37] free. Then he
[2:08:39] [Music]
[2:08:40] lifted my feet. He gave me
[2:08:45] gloryy
[2:08:47] complete when he
[2:08:49] reached down his hand for
[2:08:56] me. When he
[2:08:59] reached down his
[2:09:01] hand for me.
[2:09:07] When he
[2:09:09] reached way
[2:09:11] down for
[2:09:16] me, I was
[2:09:19] lost and
[2:09:21] undone without
[2:09:24] God or his
[2:09:26] son. when he
[2:09:28] reached down his
[2:09:31] hand for
[2:09:35] me. How my
[2:09:38] heart doth
[2:09:41] rejoice since I
[2:09:43] made him my
[2:09:46] choice. From the
[2:09:49] tempest to
[2:09:51] him now I flee.
[2:09:57] Now I
[2:09:58] lean on his
[2:10:01] arm. I'm
[2:10:03] secure from all
[2:10:06] harm since he
[2:10:08] reached down his
[2:10:10] hand for
[2:10:16] me. And he
[2:10:18] reached down his
[2:10:20] hand for me.
[2:10:26] When he
[2:10:28] reached down his
[2:10:30] hand for
[2:10:35] me, I was
[2:10:37] lost and
[2:10:40] undone without
[2:10:42] God or his
[2:10:45] son. when he
[2:10:47] reached down his
[2:10:50] hand for
[2:10:54] me. Since the
[2:10:57] Lord gave me
[2:10:59] peace, heavenly
[2:11:02] joy never
[2:11:04] cease. Lord, I
[2:11:07] give all my
[2:11:09] life unto thee.
[2:11:15] Ride my
[2:11:17] feet, hold my
[2:11:19] hand. And with
[2:11:21] him I may
[2:11:24] stand. For you,
[2:11:26] reach down your
[2:11:29] hand for
[2:11:33] me. When he
[2:11:36] reached out his
[2:11:38] hand for me.
[2:11:44] When he
[2:11:45] reach way
[2:11:48] down for
[2:11:50] [Music]
[2:11:53] me, I was
[2:11:55] lost and
[2:11:58] undone without
[2:12:00] God or his
[2:12:03] son when he
[2:12:05] reach down his
[2:12:07] hand for
[2:12:11] me. Amen.
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:21] Amen. I had something I wanted to say,
[2:12:24] but yeah, I turned 50 this year.
[2:12:30] Oh, when
[2:12:32] he when he placed a seed within
[2:12:38] me, just thinking of that.
[2:12:41] And what gift of grace is Jesus our
[2:12:44] redeemer. Can we stand and sing that
[2:12:46] together? Yet not I but Christ in me.
[2:12:50] [Music]
[2:13:00] What gift of
[2:13:02] grace is Jesus my
[2:13:09] redeemer? There is no
[2:13:12] more for heaven now to give.
[2:13:19] Mine is my
[2:13:22] joy, my
[2:13:24] righteousness and
[2:13:28] freom. A steadfast
[2:13:31] hope, my deep and boundless
[2:13:38] peace. To this I
[2:13:41] hope. My hope is only Jesus.
[2:13:49] For my
[2:13:50] life is wholly bound to
[2:13:57] him. Oh, how strange and
[2:14:02] divine. I can sing. All he is mine yet
[2:14:08] not I. But through
[2:14:11] Christ in
[2:14:15] me. The night is
[2:14:18] dark, but I am not
[2:14:24] forsaken. For by my
[2:14:27] side, the Savior He will
[2:14:33] stay. I labor
[2:14:37] on in weakness and
[2:14:43] rejoiceing. For in my
[2:14:46] need, his power is
[2:14:52] displayed. To this I
[2:14:55] hold. My shepherd will defend
[2:15:02] me. through the
[2:15:05] deepest valley he will
[2:15:11] lead. Oh, the night has been one and I
[2:15:18] shall
[2:15:20] overcome yet not I, but through
[2:15:25] Christ in
[2:15:29] me. No vade I dread.
[2:15:33] I know I am
[2:15:38] forgiven a future
[2:15:41] sure the price it has been
[2:15:44] [Music]
[2:15:47] paid. For Jesus
[2:15:50] bled and suffered for my
[2:15:56] pardon, and he was
[2:15:59] raised to overthrow the
[2:16:05] grave. To this I
[2:16:08] hold. My sin has been defeated.
[2:16:15] Jesus
[2:16:17] now and never is my
[2:16:23] plea. Oh, the chains are
[2:16:27] released. I can sing I am free yet not
[2:16:34] I, but through
[2:16:37] Christ in
[2:16:39] [Music]
[2:16:40] me. With every
[2:16:43] breath I long to follow
[2:16:49] Jesus, for he has
[2:16:52] said that he will bring me home.
[2:16:59] And day by
[2:17:01] day I know he will renew
[2:17:07] me until I
[2:17:10] stand with joy before the
[2:17:16] throne. Ooh, this I
[2:17:19] hope. My hope is only Jesus.
[2:17:26] All the
[2:17:29] gloryy ever more to
[2:17:34] him. When the race is complete, still my
[2:17:41] lips shall
[2:17:43] repeat. Yet not I, but through
[2:17:48] Christ in me.
[2:17:52] To this I
[2:17:55] hold. My hope is only
[2:18:01] Jesus. All the
[2:18:05] gloryy ever more to
[2:18:10] him. When the race is complete, still my
[2:18:17] lips shall repeat.
[2:18:20] Yet not I, but through
[2:18:24] Christ in
[2:18:28] me. When the race is
[2:18:32] complete, still my lips shall
[2:18:37] repeat. Yet not I, but through
[2:18:42] Christ in
[2:18:46] me. Yet not I, but through
[2:18:51] Christ in
[2:18:55] me. Yet not I, but through
[2:19:00] Christ in
[2:19:04] me.
[2:19:06] Amen.
[2:19:08] Amen. Love the words to that song. I can
[2:19:12] sing I'm free. Can you sing that this
[2:19:13] morning? Can you say that this morning?
[2:19:15] Hallelujah. He loosed us. Praise
[2:19:19] God. Praise
[2:19:21] God. Amen. As we get ready to dismiss,
[2:19:24] I'm going to ask our brother Kim
[2:19:25] Dingwall if you'd come up and just bless
[2:19:27] the food, bless the fellowship, and
[2:19:30] [Music]
[2:19:42] um God bless you. It's been wonderful to
[2:19:44] be in the house of the Lord this
[2:19:46] morning, hasn't it?
[2:19:48] Enjoyed all the specials. Really enjoyed
[2:19:50] getting to hear this young man's voice.
[2:19:51] I haven't heard him sing
[2:19:54] before. It's so wonderful to be in his
[2:19:57] house. And I know more than to say too
[2:19:59] much cuz I'm standing between you and
[2:20:02] lunch. So, let's just go ahead and pray.
[2:20:06] Father, we bow before you
[2:20:09] today just wanting to thank you, Lord,
[2:20:11] for your goodness and your grace that
[2:20:13] you've shown each of us, Father. And for
[2:20:16] that one thing that bridges all the gap
[2:20:18] between us be with our backgrounds, our
[2:20:21] differences, our personalities, and
[2:20:24] that's your blood, Lord
[2:20:26] Jesus. That's the one thing we all have
[2:20:29] in
[2:20:30] common is that our sins have been washed
[2:20:33] away by your blood.
[2:20:36] You've made us accepted in the beloved,
[2:20:38] Lord Jesus. And Father, that makes us
[2:20:41] all brothers and sisters regardless of
[2:20:43] background or
[2:20:44] stature. We just love you, Lord Jesus.
[2:20:48] Coming down, we were listening to a
[2:20:50] message where Brother Brandham said, "We
[2:20:52] don't need all this super duper." That's
[2:20:54] right. We don't need all this shake and
[2:20:58] shout and we just need you, Lord Jesus.
[2:21:02] So, we're just so thankful, Father, to
[2:21:04] have
[2:21:05] been part of your presence here this
[2:21:07] morning and felt you moving among the
[2:21:10] people. And Father, we just pray that
[2:21:12] you'd take this word, quicken it to
[2:21:15] every heart here, Father, regardless of
[2:21:18] where we are, Father, if we've been down
[2:21:20] the road a long time, if we're just
[2:21:22] meeting you for the first time, Father,
[2:21:25] may you just quicken to each one of us,
[2:21:27] Father, that there's a bridge, there's a
[2:21:30] way back to you. You made a way back,
[2:21:32] Father.
[2:21:34] We thank you for your grace. We thank
[2:21:36] you for this lighthouse along the road,
[2:21:39] Father. And we just ask, Father, that
[2:21:41] you'd bless this food and our fellowship
[2:21:44] together. Father, may you just may our
[2:21:47] fellowship be rich. May our fellowship
[2:21:49] be around you, Father. We thank you for
[2:21:52] your grace. In Jesus name we pray.
[2:21:55] Amen. God bless you. Bless you. Amen. As
[2:21:59] we we're dismissed, I'd like to sing
[2:22:01] that chorus. I'm amazed that you love
[2:22:06] me. Key B T

[2:22:29] came. Through your
[2:22:33] preious blood I found
[2:22:38] pardon and my
[2:22:41] sins are

[2:22:49] sins are

[2:22:59] amazed that you love
[2:23:03] me. I'm amazed.
[2:23:08] How you
[2:23:11] care through your
[2:23:15] preious blood I found

[2:23:25] washed. They're all washed
[2:23:28] away. All my
[2:23:31] sins are
[2:23:33] washed away.
[2:23:37] Amen. Shake each other's hands. God
[2:23:40] bless you. Be with you. Amen.
