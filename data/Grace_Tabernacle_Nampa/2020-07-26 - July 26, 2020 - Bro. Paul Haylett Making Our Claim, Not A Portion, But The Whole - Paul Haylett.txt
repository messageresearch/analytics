mankind prophet of god said it come down remember he he was doing the church ages and he says you know what it comes right here to a complete blackout you know i want to say you know sometimes we we sing this song because he lives i can face tomorrow but many times we get up first thing in the morning and it's lord i need something to face today amen everything applies hallelujah we get up lord this is another day you've made this day i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i will be victorious in this day right here hallelujah amen amen amen a hallelujah you know just a lovely morning you know just got up a real peace in my heart put a sermon together and just sitting there all relaxed in my office in the chair just totally praise the lord thank you lord and my computer crashed hallelujah we went from calm and peace to what am i going to do what am i going to do what am i going to do hallelujah but the lord's in control amen there might have been something that paul was thinking that was in the first sermon because this is not the first sermon it's the second sermon revised amen but uh you know i just a lovely time to come we know as we've just sung the songs this morning our god is in control hallelujah just before we go in this service just a couple of things i want to just take care of i bring greetings to you from brother david and sister deborah nash they are uh spending some grandchild time and uh anyway we just had a lovely conversation and also want to announce to you that lord willing our brother rich cobb will be here on wednesday night they are on a little holiday you know you talk about things in life that don't seem fair brother rich is younger than me and he's retired and um so uh he is he's up in north idaho preaching this sunday for brother roar and all of the family up there so we just want to remember them in prayer also we want to remember our sister sue not here with us today just kind of a stressful time that whole moving thing is something you should do the least amount of times in your life uh and uh so we want to remember sister sue and i can't help but come to church and oftentimes we're not mentioning it and uh we should but you know i come to church and and i think you know there's something missing now we're not lifting anyone up but thinking someone's missing and brother bob sister joanne amen just at home uh just want to give greetings to them may god bless them keep them strong hallelujah you know such lovely people i tell you at times in my life i've just had brother bob come up to me and grab me by the arms and looked me in the face so intently and i know it was from the lord because he would speak right to something that i've been maybe struggling a little bit self-esteem confidence etc and he would look me in the face and say just keep doing what you're doing i've been praying and god's been answering my prayers and you know what that does it just boosts us up and you know we should be doing that for one another right the saints should be lifting one another up hallelujah amen so we want to remember them sister joanne what a sweetheart my you know here recently this might sound a little awkward but forgive me but you know i just uh was saw a picture brother bob and sister joanne when they were young and i thought my she's she's a beautiful lady and my brothers and sisters through all these years now she's to me more beautiful than she must have been as a young woman all these years in all these opportunities to done anything with their lives but they have just pressed on and tried to do their very best and i believe successful to be a representative of our lord jesus christ so lift them up in prayer amen brother manasseh i know that you probably was not thinking this is how this morning would go but i would like you to come up amen and i just want to invite the young men of our church to come up also brother alex amen gideon sean brother chris if i've left any of you other young men out forgive me but you know there's like a brotherhood that comes amongst young men brother mason amen a brotherhood that comes and see they're rising up through this age now i'm not saying that this age will be any more difficult than it was when i was a young man because the word says the holy ghost is sufficient god's grace is sufficient but we're living in a time that we are not called to go on our own we're not called to isolate ourselves we're called to become part of a body and i would just like to take this moment to encourage us it might be an age difference here brother chris at the top end of the young men amen and some of you gideon sean mason at the bottom of the young men but you see as time goes on these young men will be bonded together if the lord carries another generation forward before his coming these will be the men that give direction and strength to the church our brother manasseh is going off to university my brother and sister it's difficult he'll tell you there's all kinds of struggles all kinds of things that happen there but he'll also tell you that god can lay on your heart that i'm not giving up i'm going to stand on the word i'm going to press to the mark of the high calling and i want us as a church but specifically as these young men to lay hands on our brother manasseh we're going to bless him today you know the word gives us that privilege gives us that opportunity to bless him whatever we bind on earth will be bound in heaven what we loose on earth will be loosed in heaven we've been given the opportunity to bless him not only for success in schools but overcoming power of everything that he faces amen let's just bow our heads as we go before the lord brothers lay your hands upon him heavenly father we just come this morning lord a young man who is very dear to my heart even though lord i don't talk to him near as much as i should father i just hold him father to the highest esteem of a young man desiring to serve you and lord as he goes and presses forward father to get an education which is necessary in the day that we live in lord that is been ordained of you father you opened every door and made the way possible now lord we send your holy spirit with our brother manasseh father that as he goes through the university lord truly let his life shine let it be such a beacon father that even amongst his christian friends they will recognize there's something above and beyond what they have seen and lord just give him that supernatural strength to withstand every temptation every trial every influence of worldliness and lord just move in his midst lord in the midnight hour give him strength father in the midst of the day lord give him strength now father we know lord that you have blessed him with an ability to play soccer and that is part of father what helps him go to the university now lord we ask you to protect him lead him guide him in all things lord most of all we anoint him father lord with your word to go forth this day may your word speak to him morning noon and night father strengthen him in all things may your holy spirit surround him and lord i believe father that as he stands upon this you will bless him lord just as we shared the quote the other night lord the prophet of god saying that it doesn't matter lord a farmer a minister a housewife whoever it might be that will put god first amen lord you will make them successful now lord i pray even in the hardest of days lord that you would just anoint my brother manasseh to put you first lord that he would be successful beyond every major lord we send your holy spirit with him now in the name of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah god bless you amen hallelujah hallelujah well one last thing before we go to the word on august the 7th we are going to have a youth meeting um it's going to be an age-appropriate youth meeting so it's hard sometimes to you know put an exact mark on birthdays uh so we're asking for parental discretion uh we're looking at cutting off the line in the late 12 year olds and up somewhere if your child is just 12 i'm sorry some of you young people i don't know exactly how old you are um but if you're if your parents your mom or dad would feel like you were mature for a 12 year old then you would be invited we are going just so you'll know a foretaste we are going to be discussing music we're going to be discussing rock and roll which the spirit people say well we're talking rhythm and blues we're talking classic we're talking this but we have to recognize there's a spirit behind music and if it is not causing us to worship the lord in spirit and in truth then it's probably the wrong music so we are going to have a youth meeting on august the 7th which is a friday uh and i'm not sure brother chris what is the normal time that you are seven o'clock now this uh that we're going to enter into will be quite lengthy so we might need to cut it in half we are going to watch a video that was put together uh several years ago by our brother marcus becker from germany uh it's very in-depth uh the video itself is approximately two and a half hours uh so we might need to cut that in too but uh parents i need you to pray about it and parents if your children are of age i ask you from my heart to make sure they make it you see the spirit of rock and roll which the prophet of god was talking about it's interesting he doesn't talk about rock and roll itself because he identifies that clearly as coming from the pits of hell but this spirit of rock and roll has even invaded christian music you can listen to someone singing amazing grace i did the other day made total sacrilege of it but the words are true so we just want to lay this foundation to be faithful parents ministry in the church to let you see exactly what satan's trying to pull over on you amen let's just turn to the word today i want to speak to you once again on redemption's manifestation amen we have to make a claim saints and so my title may be a little lengthy making our claim not a portion but the whole you see a partial claim in many cases cannot even be considered a claim at all and so we want to claim the whole and so as we would just stand we'll go to the 103rd psalm amen kind of wished my brother sergey was here this morning um just communicating last night with him a little bit he's almost by now probably almost on the east coast very close uh so we just want to lift our brother sergey up in prayer and um you know inspiration can come in many ways now you will find if you you wonder how this works you'll find that brother branham sorry i can't tell you what sermon it was off top of my head but brother brown says now wasn't that a wonderful message our pastor brought us this morning i got two or three sermons from that and so inspiration my brother and sister does not have to come as it were a vision or some anointing in the midnight hour but it can come just by a word being spoken a song etc and so the prophet of god receiving inspiration now he doesn't tell us what those sermons are so it won't do us any good to speculate what he might have preached in the future that would have been inspired by that but i say that that just a simple text that brother sergey sent me a portion of the 103rd psalm just blew up out of my phone and i started looking and i started looking in the message started looking in scripture and the word all become a very huge word it's only three letters but it become this huge powerful word amen and so by inspiration i i speak this and so i want to start with a definition the definition according to webster online says that the word all means the whole entire total amount quantity or extent of every member or every part of the whole number or sum of now it does not say a portion in there concerning a less than full amount it does not describe as only having a taste it does not say now we're not here to preach anything contrary to the word of god so you will be necessary for you to put it in proper context to you because i know in the heart that i'm preaching it from amen for the prophet of god said that now we don't have the whole as it were of christ we only have a foretaste or a portion of him but my brother and sister i want you to go back in the message and also go and listen or study what brother branham said he said now you put that teaspoon i believe he said it was in the ocean everything that's in that ocean is in that teaspoon of water amen so every mineral every ingredient is in that portion so while you only have that little portion of it is you have the whole of it hallelujah so you got to find the balance in the word right people are like well you know brother brown's got to come back so we can get the rest of the message know my brother and sister the whole sum total of the message is in the message and it's being revealed to you and i now if he put it out on the written page or on tape just to put it in such a simple form then even the make-believer would get it right but the word of god says that he plugged their ears closed their eyes so they would not repent and if they repented then he would have to save them and heal them so god's got a plan amen we want that whole plan to come to pass in us and you say well brother paul how do we know well you know we know i don't know how we know we know amen i'm a son of god i know that but i don't need to come and convince you now as a pastor i might need to encourage you to come to the place you recognize it in yourself but i'm not here to convince you right i won't take a young person and and just give them you know 105 scriptures and you know couple hundred quotes and say now go home because you you're the bride see that has to be a desire in there has to be a hunger in there there has to be something that says i'm different and you know as young people hallelujah it's hard being different and when you're in your 20s it's hard being different and when you're in your 30s it's hard being different when you're in your 40s it's hard being different and when you're older than 40 when you're in your 50s it's hard being different in 60s and 70s and 80s and 90s you see the scripture says you're not of this world you're of a heavenly kingdom now if you're of a heavenly kingdom how can you identify with this world not possible thank you lord and the sooner we recognize where we belong and who we belong to the easier it is for us to accept we're different hallelujah praise the lord 103rd psalm we'll just read a portion of it today bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies who satisfieth my mouth with good things so that thy mouth thy youth excuse me speaking of being over 50. who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles amen that's why i don't like to hear older people in the message i don't know what age means older but i don't like older people complaining about how tired they are and how they're not able to do certain things i'm preaching to paul this morning because they say well i'm just getting older i can't do this i i'd lift my hands in worship but you know i'm just my arms are tired my brother and sister the word says he would renew us like the eagle amen our youth should not be something we abandoned because our birthdays keep clicking higher amen that our youth renewed like the eagles oh hallelujah i'm going to get excited here if i'm not careful this morning the lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed he made known his ways unto moses his acts and to the children of israel the lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy hallelujah oh hallelujah he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us heavenly father we ask for your blessings upon the word today lord open it to us father lord in such a fashion in such a measure father that we would leave today lord and say was it not good to be in the house of the lord lord we thank you give guidance in your name we pray amen you may be seated i would like to jump down to verse 21 and as we would look at this we would then say according to the word all that was in between this read it it is beautiful but for the sake of time bless ye the lord now my brother and sister that ought to be something that's fresh on our lips all the time is praise for the king all ye his hosts ye ministers of his that do his pleasure bless the lord lord all his works in all places of his dominion bless the lord oh my soul amen now as we would look at this my brother and sister i want to as it is just kind of it will look like i'm on a loop uh those of you that own old stereos maybe new ones i don't know i haven't bought one so long i don't know what a new stereo looks like but you look at this i'm going to push loop here because we're going to go a little ways and we're going to circle right back upon ourselves again now it says here in verse 21 bless ye the lord all ye his hosts now the word host is one that receives or entertains guests socially commercially or officially one that provides facilities for an event or a function a living animal or plant on or which a parasite lives a larger strong dominant member of a commercial or symbiotic pair an individual into which a tissue part or embryo is transplanted from another now as you look at this my brother and sister bless ye the lord all ye his hosts now look my brother and sister we know as the prophet of god has laid this out as the painting of the door and how that it would be that uh uh they uh questioned that about the latch not being on the outside and and you know the story goes that uh no that was correct because you see we're in control of the door whether we're going to let him in whether we're going to give him a presence and we're going to as it were uh receive or entertain him is according to our own heart's desires no one's going to force you to open that door sometimes ministers might be a little forceful my brother and sister let me tell you if a real minister a real man of god has a desire in his heart to only serve god according to the will of god to please god my brother and sister if he presses upon you that man is not there pressing upon you i would be so bold to say this morning it is god pressing upon you and so there's times in our life we need a little encouragement to get up out of our chair we need a time of our life we need just a little something to give us an unction to go ahead and step out of what the flesh feels or what the flesh sees or or how we see our circumstance and so i would just encourage each one of you today to be a host amen to receive and entertain the lord jesus today and just to give him that opportunity to to allow him to come in and then you can entertain him now my brother and sister i want to speak to you as i said today on uh receiving amen making our claim not a portion but the whole you see there's a lot of things in life my brother and sister that require we make a very solid claim you can possess the title to a piece of property but yet if you never transfer it over at the courthouse or at the county level or state level and you never make a solid claim on it and you die with that still in your possession without making the proper claim it can be contested and so it's there my brother and sister that we as sons and daughters of god living our life here on this earth today we are not here to just go through life as it were with a partial claim that we are sons and daughters of god if we come to that place and we never make that full claim upon that it could be contested as to whether or not we truly are sons and daughters of god and as we make a claim upon the word we will manifest all that's in the word for us to claim now it doesn't matter my brother and sister what we would say or what we would do going to church won't do it for you perfect attendance won't do it i would prefer perfect attendance to absenteeism but my brother and sister still the prophet of god the scripture lays it out so clearly time after time that it takes a baptism of the holy ghost amen the prophet of god i want to throw this out uh we'll discuss it in this youth meeting but the prophet of god i'm just paraphrasing it says you know if a young person doesn't have the baptism of the holy ghost whenever they hear that the spirit of rock and roll will claim them just hearing it you don't have to go to the party you don't have to go to the concert you don't have to do whatever that spirit will claim now look i i got to we were discussing age and and i just want to lay this out you know we were trying to figure out where to put the age but you see i started listening to rock and roll at about 11 and a half years old i never got delivered from it until i was in my late 30s you don't think it has a grip it has got a grip and even then i hope you find the humor in this i'll be going through a store with my wife and something will come on and she will invariably turn and look at me because i i don't even realize it i drove my chevy to the levy but they love you well hallelujah was i really walking through the store singing that well you see my brother and sister satan wants to put an imprint on let's make a full claim on the promises of god let's not leave one bit of room for satan to put an imprint amen that all of his print would be wiped away hallelujah now as we look at this my brother and sister i just want you to see that see satan's goal if we are going to uh have a claim that can be made satan wants to minimize as it were satan's goal is that we would claim only a portion now we know that we can claim to be a christian we can claim that we have the holy ghost my brother and sister but the claim itself is good we must each one make that right we must come to the place and say you know what lord i want the holy ghost and come to a stage in our life we say i've got the holy ghost but just simply putting that in words and saying so doesn't make it so and so you know if that was the case you know maybe some of us would say i'm good looking and that would just change everything in our life but it doesn't work that way amen so you know my brother and sister as satan can get us to only claim a portion then he can get us to limit what we will actually pursue now when i say pursue we know that the word says that no man has sought god god has sought man but yet god put something into the heart of man that is there that cannot be denied and that was the seed gene of the word and when the seed gene of the word hears the word it recognizes that was the missing portion that was in the life now if satan can get us to limit that portion and to uh just come to the place that we're happy to say i believe the message i believe god sent a prophet i i believe this i go to this church you see my brother and sister that's only a portion of it amen and so satan will work and has we have witnessed uh through the years my brother and sister uh satan doing this that each generation claims a smaller portion than the generation before it that's why there had to be a restoring of the word amen that's why profit came it wasn't that we could not find as it were the truth down through the ages but my brother and sister there comes a time that with each generation claiming a smaller portion the word in its entirety is then disassembled and pieces are uh where'd they go and i said i went off to the restroom no problem can you handle this no problem because you see anything was better than working with that person amen now my brother and sister tell me that the world we live in that satan would not mark you and after a couple days there was not a single person but my direct boss would even speak to me in that building and i was so thankful don't be afraid to be marked be identified this young man was actually a very polite young man he just thought anything to do with religion was weird and it took him only about two or three hours to figure out i was weird i went from being hey you and i can be buddies too you're but if that's what i have to sacrifice for christ then let it be amen now i want you to think of what you wouldn't be if your mistakes controlled your life we would never have a job we'd never work because every one of you that's ever worked made a mistake amen certainly you would never drive a car amen imagine but this starting to get scary none of you would ever have a friend i hear hmms but i didn't hear any amens we'd never this is from a man's perspective here our wife would never wash our clothes because she'd say you know i don't know what i was thinking but i dumped bleach in on your clothes and uh it all landed in one spot and now your pants look like they're tie-dyed so she's not ever gonna wash my clothes again because she made a mistake my that's scary she'd never clean the house and she'd certainly never cook again you know one of the things about getting married young marry a girl and realize she can't even boil water that you're so in love even boiled burnt water did you know you can burn water even burnt water tastes good because you're in love but look i'm trying to make a point to you of what you wouldn't do if you look at yourself and say i've made a mistake right i have to tell this on sister jerry we we lived in an apartment right over canyon hill you drop down the freeway into caldwell and up there on a bluff right there you can't really see these apartments and and uh turns out a couple guys i went to high school with lived an apartment next door and they like to smoke a lot of weed hey man i don't know if it was thistle or kosher or something but it did weird things to him anyway you know i come home from work one day and and one of the guys comes out of his apartment and they shared the same back sidewalk with us and and he comes out there and he's just giggling all silly like a girl and and finally he goes paul he says i i don't want to tell you or not haha and he just goes into a fit of laughter and he said you know i was sitting out on the back step which means he was out there smoking a joint and he said and i heard the door slam open and here come this flaming fire frying pan flying out the back door landing out there beyond it and he said i jumped up you know and and then and here come your wife right behind it and i was like oh are you all right she looked at me and went in the house slammed the door and he said i just can't help it but it was just pretty funny and then him telling me i thought this is pretty funny hey jerry what about the flaming fire pan i'm not talking about it now my brother and sister if we are controlled by our mistakes we will find ourselves in all aspects of our life no longer trying to endeavor or accomplish and as sons and daughters of god if we ever stop and say you know what i make mistakes i can't go no further then you might as well give up because you will go no further and anything short of the goal that has been set before us is not complete amen so if you do not press to the mark of the high calling because of the circumstances of your life my brother and sister the devil didn't have to get you to deny that you're a christian he does not have to get you to renounce the bible you don't have to become agnostic or atheist or whatever that might be i just watched a little video a man talking to college students and one of them said well you know i i'm agnostic kinda atheist agnostic i don't know you know whatever and this man listens to this young man's little talk and finally he says you know there's something i've come to conclusion listening to you and the young man's like what was that he says i don't have enough faith to believe like you you believe that all of this organization as it were everything coming together and working cut from nothing total chaos brought this i don't have enough faith for that you see we are sons and daughters of god cannot look at our mistakes but we must come to the place that we know there's a promise amen and that promise been given to us we lay claim to that because we believe we're identified in that promise otherwise my brother and sister we go to church everybody says i'm a christian we go home live any old way we please now ultimately that is one of the reasons many young people don't believe in god today don't want to serve god today is too many people walked out of church and lived any old way and they looked at that and said look i'm just as good as they are they're better than me they claim to have something more than me i claim to have nothing and we're the same amen that's why the life of a christian should never be based upon the mistakes that you should that you would make but we are quick amen thank the lord for that we are quick to repent amen that's the spirit of a real christian always quick to repent they're soft they're tender the prophet of god talks about how when they would become hardened in their heart you look around there's a lot of christians with hard hearts a lot of people that cannot hardly even be moved by the preaching of the word they cannot hear the prophets speak they cannot read their bible they cannot listen to gospel music and even be moved mostly they just simply have a belief system and that belief system is what controls them but there is no life no emotion nothing that is really turning inside amen now speaking of churning there's a lot of lovely quotes where brother brown talks one about the spring something pushing up inside talking about how something turned up inside of him and we'll see if we get there today now in the service the message the rapture brother branham says here in the days of the pentecostals the restoring back of the gifts the restoration of the gifts speaking of tongues casting out devils i mean we don't have to just put up with the devil sitting in church we don't have to put up with him sitting at our dining room table we don't have to put up him being a hitchhiker in our car and the gifts why it testified there was no joke about it people said when it first raised up i read the books on the history of pentecost they said it can't last long it'll burn down it's still burning why it's because you never put it out you'll never put it out god said it would be there it's that portion of the word and no more could you put that out then when the bride being called out how you going to put it out it's a revelation of the manifestation of the word made true and we're living in that day praise be to god the revelation of the mystery of himself now my brother and sister if one would say well we're not sure about that well we've got scripture that clearly defines that all the mysteries of god would be made known oh amen if i read that correct earlier here that means the complete number amen so there's nothing left to be undone now i want to just move right along here and i want to just trying to make a point lay a foundation in events made clear by prophecy for the bible is a living foretold witness of jesus christ and as the earth has grown into its fullness and also vines grow into their fullness the days grows into its fullness the bible was manifested in its fullness in the person of jesus christ he was the word of god revealed the whole complete book of redemption do you realize my brother and sister if god is in you i think that's scriptural isn't it if god is in you then the book of redemption is in you amen we're not looking for another book to be opened somewhere we're not looking for a coming and another opening the book of redemption is in you and that is what is stirring your heart to want the word of god amen because a book is unfolding not out here on a preacher in a pulpit not in a library somewhere not in a video series the word is being opened and manifested in you and i hallelujah don't look for it somewhere else look for it in you amen but if satan can he'll come and say well our pastor our brother so and so or the prophet they had a real manifestation of jesus christ this man has a manifestation this man has it and we'll leave ourselves completely out of the picture satan's happy with that you can attend grace tabernacle all the days of your life we'll bury you and you'll be there and know better off my brother and sister than the first day you walked in if you don't recognize it's god in you hallelujah the bible is god's word for telling future events it's believers is commanded by its author to read and believe every word of it not just part of it one word to do disbelieve it you might as well quit trying just one word just one word did somebody hear me can somebody say one amen just one word you might as well quit trying until you believe that word so whatever little portion it is that you struggle with it oh you say brother paul i believe all the doctrine i believe all the prophet of god i believe everything he showed in but if you have a struggle believing that you are a son a daughter of god and you are called before the foundation of the world to believe it you're just believing the one word amen see you've got to come to the place that you put yourself right in that word and you say but it's impossible for me to be filled with the holy ghost it's impossible for me to have the authority of almighty god it's impossible for me to make a difference my brother and sister you're disbelieving the one word you've got to step right into that and say i don't care what i think about it i don't care what it looks like i'm not going to be just believe one word of it can i explain it no i can't explain it it don't matter i believe it amen people say well that's crazy well there's a lot of things talking to a guy the other day we were talking about things of god and not he's a little bit uh you might say just a little bit not quite as zealous as some of us god is god and we're made in his image and he kind of figures that covers the picture and i shared with him a little quotation i'd come across where this man says now you might not believe in the creation you might not believe in god in heaven and this being the manifestation of his spoken word you might might not believe and goes right down through a whole lift you know the holy ghost you might not believe in all these things but he said if you go climb on top of a big tall building and you stand on the ledge and step off you better believe in gravity and if there is no god there is no gravity otherwise we could just go get some gravity somewhere because there are planets without gravity you know that they've identified some of these planets that the only reason all them big rocks floating around don't fly away is outside of their realm is some kind of force that's holding it all in place i wonder where they got that force at maybe on amazon next day delivery come on you might as well one word believe it just believe it you might as well quit trying until you believe that word every word is absolutely a part of almighty god god made manifest wound into his word to show forth who he is we are commanded as believers to believe every word of it and it's wrote by the author of god himself there is nobody can add anything to it or take anything from it if you would it would be a freak body of god now i'm just trying to lay a little foundation to you here saints that you would be able to see now amen that this word has clearly identified you and i and we must regardless of our mistakes regardless of where we were raised people say but we weren't taught that way well go back to the word make sure what you were taught lines up with the word amen it would have maybe like six fingers on one hand or three arms or something to add something or take something away from it be one arm short one finger short it's the complete body of jesus christ now remember we hear the word being preached it says nobody can take your place amen do you realize if you give up and you say well i believe the message i believe everything in this day but really i was not called to make a difference you have just turned the body of christ into a freak did i sober you are there freaks here no sir we're not freaks this is the complete body of jesus christ it's just time for you and i to reach out and possess what god has given to us satan has tried to convince you that because of whatever reason it might be that this is not you and it's not for you then you have to go and take it back i tell you speaking about taking it back go to brother tim pruitt's church uh website or whatever it is i don't remember what was the name of their church evening night tabernacle in louisiana he preached a sermon take it back it's powerful i would encourage you i mean brother brother tim pruitt didn't be brother ron spencer preached it at that church let me get my thoughts straight brother ron spencer preach the evening light fellowship take it back my brother and sister it's time for us to take it back it's time for us to say look that's mine that's mine that was given to me that's mine satan give it back hallelujah oh amen it's the complete body of christ in christ being the male the groom the bride is represented in him also and these two are one now this blows me away because there are people around the message that struggle about this being one thing my brother and sister if you've missed that revelation you've missed a lot of things amen said the husband and the wife would be one said the church the bride and christ would be one amen the prophet of god says he was one half the bride was the other half two the the two of them together make the complete amen you can't miss that at that day you'll know that i am in the father the father and me and i and you and you and me what a complete picture you see we're not taking part of the picture and cutting it off and saying here's what it is now you know it's interesting i i i i find this really interesting i come across a deal here a while back and there's a picture and uh somebody about four or five comments down from that said why did you crop the pitcher did you not want them to see the rest of it now there's an undercurrent there that i thought my goodness i'm putting on a life preserver and i'm paddling towards the bank because there's some kind of undercurrent here but you see my brother and sister the whole picture the complete picture we are in christ jesus satan has come over here and cut the one side off the pitcher and then tried to present that to you my brother and sister we're not going to settle for a cropped picture we want the whole complete picture amen and true believers in this word who can accept it that way hmm believe it and with patience wait for its prophesied promise now look you know i'm going to go back to this whole belief the sign thing that come one of the things is well brother branham said this this and this and it's never come to pass well hallelujah i've got a choice to make i'm going to wait patiently or i'm going to decide it ain't happening what are we going to do saints amen hallelujah you might bury me one day right here maybe even in this church some of you say words over me and you'll roll me right out of here and put me in a hole in the ground but you know what i'm gonna have to die to end my conscious assumption that the lord will fill his word i'm not ever going to just say no done god didn't do it didn't do it my time frame didn't do it my lifetime it can't be true no i'm sorry i'll go right to the grave believing every word of this because my brother and sister it wasn't centered on me god didn't say now when paul haley comes along he's going to determine when this this and this happens no he said now i will determine what happens in paul's life and paul will then submit to the word and the word will come but one thing i know oh i hope i'm not sounding presumptuous this morning but when god said paul will believe this word my theophany was out there saying amen because you see there could never be a doubt in me i never fear lodged in me nothing that ever kept me from what god said i would be now apply that to yourself this morning if god said that you were righteous and you say well i'm just not very righteous you're countering the word of god don't go there just simply say lord i'm struggling with this but i believe i'm righteous you said i'm an overcomer lord i'm struggling i was on my face yesterday lord but i will claim i'm an overcomer lord i have these things in my life i have those things in my life i have doubts and i have fears i have all of this lord how can that be wait my child just stop i said it you believe it it will come to pass hallelujah and true believers in this word who accept it that way believe it and with patience wait for its prophesied promises every one of them to be manifested in its age every believer has watched for it every oh boy this one here remember when you're a fighter you always guard yourself every believer that's been on the toes watching is the one that's been revealed to now you say brother paul you might be digging too far between the lines you believe god sent a prophet but if you aren't watching for what was thus saith the lord prophesied it's not going to be revealed to you that's why we have right in the church saints always i cannot be honest with you i always just really struggle i don't bring it up a whole lot when talking about make believers and unbelievers and the true believer because it just it hurts me to realize at some point in time that has to manifest it hurts me i i want to look out everywhere i preach no i don't say this boastfully but i've preached to over a thousand people and i've preached to two somewhere along the line we got to balance this all out but i'll tell you what i want you to do if i could encourage you get up on your toes come on are you with me get up on your toes and start watching for the promises of god to be manifested amen they're being manifested right in our congress of our nation in the courts of our nation my brother and sister we're seeing the spirits manifested right here in our city we're seeing a ride all around us it's all being manifested and if we're not watching for it we're not paying attention we'll miss it but i tell you every believer that's been on the toes amen they're they're looking they're waiting they're studying they're praying amen it's the ones it's revealed to oh god help us to get serious help us to just press out going back to what i said earlier amen god help us not to say i'm too weary i'm too tired i'm too whatever i've been there i've done that i do that sometimes my brother and sister just ask god for supernatural strength don't give in to i feel too tired give in to lord come down in your authority i need some strength lord i need to be able to live this word i need to be able to stand up and testify give me strength lord give me courage hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah now this might seem weird but we're going to jump right back up and go through the scripture again real quick amen i do nothing quick so you guys know that was just a figure of speech amen lord help me learn what quick is let's go right back to the scriptures if we would brother alex psalms 103 amen bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name now i want to ask you my brother and sister what's in you did god only give you a portion of himself did he hide himself from you no remember the ocean the teaspoon amen now we don't have all of god prophet of god showed us clearly we don't have all of god we don't have all of jesus christ we're not standing in his presence we cannot wrap our arms around him but we have as it were that teaspoon and we have that foretaste so all that is in christ right he said all that is in i poured into jesus christ and all that was in me poured into the church and so my brother and sister you understand my thoughts are just racing off i'm i'm down on the road going away but look all that is there my brother and sister see he poured into the church right he didn't say i poured a little portion of it he said i i poured all amen so you look at this and all that is in me amen amen all that is within me amen not i'm not going to give god just a little taste i'm not going to say well lord i feel like i only got a little taste of you i'm only going to give a little taste back no my brother and sister we're here as almost david says you know what bless the lord on my soul and all that is within me is going to bless him hallelujah bless the lord o my soul forget not all his benefits now i don't know about you guys but my health insurance comes in just about every month it comes it has a big envelope and part of it is they're telling me one we had to raise your rates and two we changed your benefits happens all the time it almost seems like every month another 20 bucks another 20 bucks another 20 bucks and oh wait we took this benefit away from you and we took this benefit away from you but my brother and sister you see how god works he works exactly the opposite amen he's coming and saying price is paid you open that envelope it said paid in full and i have benefits for you that you have not been collecting and i want you to collect these benefits well i'll tell you how personal it is sometimes church gets personal sometimes we don't like it because it's personal but i tell you what if god himself would come right down here our lord jesus christ come right down here today there would not be a one of us he would not walk around and say you have not been cashing in on your benefits you have not been taking your benefit you haven't been collecting your benefit you need to apply your benefit not one of us would be able to sit here and say praise the lord i've been taking it all we would come and realize my brother and sister all these benefits let's not forget the benefits that god has given to us amen don't get caught up in life i hear people all the time we'll have a lovely service and i'm sorry to be this blunt but maybe it's time to put it that way we have a lovely service the spirit of god moving here and walk out in the foyer and hear people talk about the pain in their foot in their ankle in their knee in their hip in their shoulder in their stomach i had a headache all the way through the surface i didn't get anything out of it my goodness what are you doing you're forgetting your benefits it's time for us to claim the benefits amen you say but i wasn't worthy don't you like the order that god laid this in amen well i didn't collect the benefits because i i've got iniquity in my life well praise the lord who forgiveth all right can someone say all this morning oh thine iniquities oh i hadn't received my healing because no he said he forgive your iniquities and he declared i'll heal all your diseases oh nothing's too hard for god oh thank you lord i love that nothing's too hard for god we ought to be sitting back and saying you know what i fully expect this to be taken from me i will not claim it in the name of jesus christ i had people come up to me and say paul do you have diabetes i heard you have diabetes and you know my answer is well that's what the doctor says that's right hallelujah why because i believe this it's not my disease hey man he healed me from all my diseases oh brother paul how can you go there really easy really easy because i believe the word who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies hallelujah how can we be mean and ornery and be a bully around the word of god and be crowned with loving kindness and tender mercy come on god's not going to play that game with us where we justify our position that's contrary to the word and it's got and i don't know what it is i need but i want it and when the foreman come around through the plant and found an unoccupied machine and he went wandering a little further and he found the guy down on the floor crying out to god the foreman of the plant had enough of god in him he went back and stood at the machine and let that keep going on hey you reckon god does not have mercy god does not show grace god knows what's going on because even the foreman of the plant who wasn't really a christian said that guy needs help my i've wandered so far i don't know you know i'm kind of like the lady that went into the mall up here in boise one time she uh went in the store and she shopped for a few hours because we know that's what our sisters need to do um a few minutes man kind of shopping just doesn't work for our sisters amen you guys have seen it man goes in the door goes over grabs the shirt goes over pays for it walks out the door gets in the car the wife looks like dennis the menace she goes over here tries this on she goes here comes down there looks at this goes back tries this on again goes over here comes down decides if i bought that i need shoes she takes this over here tries it on with shoes and goes over here and need a brooch and i need this and that decides not to buy it wanders into a different store it's one revelation i've figured out 37 years don't go shopping with your wife but look my brother and sister this lady went in the store spent several hours like three four hours in the store she walks out she goes out by the big lamp pole you all know which one i'm talking about right parking lot the big lamp pole wait there's 90 big lamp poles out there she goes out by the lamp pole and her car's gone there's an empty space there oh my 9-1-1 somebody stole my car what is your car white cadillac okay ma'am we'll respond right now officer on the way no officer there's nobody showed up ma'am he's working on it just be patient pretty soon here comes the patrol car pulls up hi ma'am i'ma hear about your stolen car yes i come and somebody stole my car he says ma'am could you get in the car why do i need to get in the car ma'am just please get in the car then he drives around the mall pulls up to the big light pole and lo and behold there's a white cadillac park there i'm gonna close on this there's so much more to share this morning but my brother and sister say give us the mirror image he'll give us a place to go to church he'll let us pray he'll let us read our bible he let us do all of this but if he keeps us from possessing all that has been promised us he controls us we claim every promise in the book oh i've got quotes for this i just won't bring it out today we claim every promise and act on it the prophet of god said we control satan you need satan controlled in your life quit backing away from these promises start claiming everything in the book regardless of where it is whether you're just a child you're a teenager in school whether you're an adult or you're old amen quit backing up on the promises of god quit backing up on that and lay hold on you say but brother paul i don't know how i i can do that well you can do that by start by simply just claiming it amen hallelujah my i've got i just don't know where the time went i just i just feel not to push my i don't like using the word luck but you know sometimes you don't push our luck i've i've just got so much left amen ephesians 1 13-23 my brother and sister is talking about that how he has put all things under his feet and gave him to head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all you see he's not talking about just a partial just giving you a little taste and just hoping that that's enough to attract you he has laid it all out and said all of this the overcoming life the power of the word everything it's yours it's yours just reach out take it i don't know what to do with it well you just possess it god will show you what to do with it amen the moment will come and you'll get out of bed i always like that hell brother donny reagan would act that out you know he wake up in the morning hallelujah i don't know if you guys familiar with it or not but brother donnie says you know wake up in the morning you're in bed and he's there and he wakes up and then he turns puts covers back puts his feet on the floor and all those demons start crying out oh no he's up what are we gonna do send reinforcements he's up he's moving he's talking no he's praying oh well hallelujah i don't mean this to sound insulting there'll always be somebody to think we are and the other side of the story is throw the covers back set up your feet on the floor and the devil's like my punching bag woke up man i'm so glad i can beat on him today come on better choice we got a choice we can't just say well you know the prophet said the devil said the devil's got a punch come i mean the you know said the devil's got a punch coming yeah he said cover yourself cover yourself he's got a punch coming what are you going to do i like this i like this sorry i'm sorry i just have to get this out i like this reminds me real life experience high school kids you know they do old things have you guys ever played knuckles yes who hasn't played knuckles some of us with arthritis played knuckles well what it is brother joshua you put your hands like this up to somebody else's hands and then the first guy gets to go and then you yeah and now i tell you what you can just beat somebody senseless because the back of their hands will swell up and look like they got half a softball and kids in high school are like oh this is so much fun yeah and then they move on from that because when you figure out that this kid's faster than everybody else around it and everybody else's hands hurt and they can't even hold a pin in history class then you go on to another game and some of these games that kids play and every one time i was good friends with this kid and i'm glad i was because they went on to this you know hit me as hard as you can game yeah come on i'm telling you the truth and my friend jim jim ryan different kid very unsocial very unsocial but if he was your friend then nobody messed with you because he'd look them in the face and say i already hated you and then you mess with my friend and i hate you even more and kids they just couldn't help themselves big kids fist like this and they're like we'll play jim would always say go first i've seen him hit him so hard it picked him up off the floor knock him back five feet and then his my turn now you want to talk about seeing a big person get afraid i just hit him as hard as i could he didn't whimper all he did is come back and say my turn and it turns out that jim's dad knew some kind of whatever had been in the military and studied martial arts and from a little kid he'd been raised up and jim would just stand there all casually relaxed and they'd be looking at him and he'd be going are you ready and they're like yeah go ahead well you know what they were expecting they were expecting him to like now and they'd be just like you know what the devil was expecting a great big wind-up explanation why why why why why because of this and because of that and jesus said it is written he didn't need some big wind up he didn't need some big i need a stick i need a whatever he just said it is written right come on saints i want you to look at your bible in a different fashion i want you to look through it and find all of the alls amen because he's already gave it to you it's already paid for it's already done you don't need some explanation about i'm weak in this thing and i have this thing and i had that thing and i had a bad childhood and i'm having a bad adulthood and i'm having this and i'm having that while you go back to the word amen it's written it's written i'm an overcomer i'm righteous i'm holy i'm a son of god i'm going to finish this race it's all written it's all written can we trust the lord amen can we just press forward my brother and sister oh hallelujah oh hallelujah sister emmy would you come amen that'll cause me to stop i have one last quote that's super long and i'll bring it out in another service but i just want you to i just want you to understand in fact i don't mind you writing it down brother alex put this uh broken cisterns up on the screen so that they can uh find the paragraph i want you all to write this paragraph down or come back in the service and pull this i want you to read this because see you're going to say there's a reason why i can't do this and i can't do that and there is something there about my inabilities now i'm just going to paraphrase it to you really quick as our sister starts to play something for us my brother and sister this is the prophet of god talking about a need amen he's there talking about a need that a young man that had been severely injured unto death and the prophet of god talking about how you know maybe i'd go over there if god would give me a vision but now god starts dealing with the prophet and he realizes just a second if i had faith in the vision i just there immediately pray for him but it was the same faith whether he had a vision or not it was the same god on this scene i want you to read that i want you to go right down there see if jesus was here he go lay his holy hands on him that boy get well i don't care if his liver is bursting he'd get well because jesus was walking there knowing exactly who he was he knowed his calling the scriptures was right vindicating he knowed who he was not a shadow of a doubt but the prophet of god goes on to realize wait i have that kind of faith i know who i am i know what the word says and he says i went right out there and i went and prayed for him and there he was in the service made completely whole my brother and sister don't go looking up and saying now if i was here if i was this if i was the prophet if i was the preacher if i was this if i was that look what the word said about you and when you catch the revelation of what the word says about you amen you see it will come to a place that you will be able to just simply say you know what i need this you know brother brown says oh i'm a sinner born sexual birth i may as well just read the whole thing to you right my father mother both sinners i'm just good nothing but you know what if the lord would give me a vision send me down there that would be different i'd go down lay my hands and come out of that bed and give me vision but then i got to thinking after all if this was a vision what is it it was some same dirty hands on him the same man praying for him same dirty hands i began to think i'm his representative any representatives here this morning amen i'm his representative then god doesn't see me oh just a second that's why i had to do this i need to try ribbon around this you see he doesn't see you oh but i can't this and i'm not bad and oh if i i make mistakes and i've got iniquity everybody's got iniquity come on you can pray through and with before before lunch comes you'll have iniquity in your life oh my ah yeah god doesn't see me blood or that righteous when ladies up there on the altar takes intersections he's my sufficiency he's my prayer he's my life the only thing that'll make me put my hands on him with faith because i had faith in the vision and without the vision the same faith would do the same thing so i can reckon myself nothing but reckon him my old and all is my life he's my commissioner no denomination sent me he sent me i go in his name i'll lay hands upon him walk down the street laid hands on that boy and that night he was in the meeting i'll back that up without the quote just words and you can search it out the prophet of god said any old mother any old housewife can go lay her hands on her child and claim it in the name of jesus christ you don't need the preacher preachers are good they have their place but so does that holy ghost-filled housewife so does that young person in grade school junior high school high school they have that place you don't got to go say well if the pastor pray for me i might be able to overcome school no god's in you you'll overcome it amen the workplace you'll overcome it amen whatever affliction satan might put something in the mind the heart the soul the spirit trying to hinder you from claiming all claim in the name of jesus christ go forward oh hallelujah hallelujah well i didn't do this quote justice so we'll have to come back and revisit it if that'll be all right but my brother and sister you see it doesn't matter it's who christ is all we got to do is stand up and let him work through us and remember god's not looking for people that are movers and shakers [Music] mixers is what the prophet of god called it he's not looking for mixers god's looking to separate us separate us from this world amen from the things of this world well praise the lord hallelujah my [Music] you know they say they didn't build rome in a day but they did build it while i was preaching hallelujah brother jason help me amen my hope is built on nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness hallelujah hope is built on nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness [Music] and [Music] to hide his face i rest on his unchanging grace in every high and stormy gales my anchor holds [Music] all [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] is rest in his righteousness [Music] is hallelujah think about his love oh think about his goodness just think about his grace so great is the measure of our father's love all grace just think about his goodness just think about his grace [Music] is hallelujah aren't you glad today amen the promise is right here saints it's right here you say well brother paul i've been living a victorious life good claim another promise amen that's what will raise you right up heavenly places give you strength to endure everything you know sister jerry and i was talking uh i wanna i wanna take any lively hope you have out of you before we dismiss we're living in a day right they're wanting to take our money away from us now it says you won't be able to buy and sell right get that mark they want to take our money away from us now but look at the dark ages god allowed them to go and they hid in a cave oh wait i don't mean to disappoint you they now have technology they can look through rock and sense your body heat under 50 feet of rock we're not going to go hide in a cave some of them they went they become wanderers in the wilderness so if somebody wanted to find them they had to pursue them and find them but now they can cover a whole desert in a matter of a very brief period of time i was over in monmouth preaching for brother rich this last march they took me to meet a man flies a corporate jet brother rich's son is taking flight lessons from him took us to a hangar and here is a a jet they bought it used i i was it made me feel a lot better that they only paid 48 million for a used jet but it can land in the fog in the rain and everything because just the heat that a light bulb on the runway puts off it sees it and he said let me prove it to you and he went out of the jet and he went across the hangar put his hand for just about that long on the box that holds the fire extinguisher come and got back in the plane and sat down and he says let's see how long we can see that and that perfect handprint stayed there and stayed there and stayed there slowly got dim you're not going to find a bush to hide under but the one thing they cannot penetrate with their technology is when a son or daughter of god is hid in christ they can't find him there i tell you our brother ivan i wished he was here my heart breaks sometimes i love that man so much he shared stories with me about how in the ukraine when it was behind the iron curtain shared a story once they were throwing bibles over the fence and a box ripped open and bibles flew everywhere pages papers on the ground [Music] i was just condensed the story there was a man there picking him up and there was supposed to be a young man that would walk sentry to tell him if the guards were coming they had sand that they would break clean so they could see any footprint and here come these guards and here's this man picking up bibles and there's the soldiers and we would think it's over it's done i'm going to prison but brother ivan shared with me how that man stood there holding a box of bibles and the soldiers walked within mere feet of him and walked right on by that's an earthly example of what it is to be hid in christ amen hallelujah don't worry about tomorrow don't worry about the direction this world's gone we got a promise we got a promise god will bring his promise to pass amen you just keep holding on to that promise and don't falter don't fear amen you know my brother and sister i just can i i just gotta share this last little bit sister jerry and i talking and we have people and i i bring this up because i'm talking about people around the message they're fearing viruses they're fearing our government they're fearing this and they're fearing that but the word says what you fear will come upon you and i also was reading this morning that the lord would be upon those who feared him no i tell you what hallelujah i tell you i'm gonna fear the lord i'm gonna give reverence to the lord because he's gonna come upon me hallelujah when i fear hell hallelujah you are with me what i fear is gonna come upon

why because i've got the promise of almighty god oh hallelujah does that mean that we're ignorant and we misbehave no wash your hands don't hug strangers maybe not even those in your midst [Music]
