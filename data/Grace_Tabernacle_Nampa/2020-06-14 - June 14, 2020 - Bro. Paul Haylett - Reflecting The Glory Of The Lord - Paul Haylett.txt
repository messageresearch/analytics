hallelujah I love you great thank you Lord we thank you Lord your essence Oh God life-changing presence of God father we thank you today Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelu hallelujah hallelu blessed be the name of the Lord Alleluia Oh hallelujah hey man let's give a hand clap of praise to our Lord hallelujah Lord we love you we take these 10 string instruments and we praise you today Oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] thank you Lord Jesus alleluia alleluia - be in the house of the Lord this morning don't you just love it when the presence of God floods in amen hallelujah so good to see each and every one our brother Vasily sister Toma amen praise the Lord well you know any doctor that understands knows he can't heal someone and beautiful to have our brother already back in fellowship with us one to welcome our guests in the foyer god bless you amen pray the Lord just bless you in the service today hallelujah you know it's beautiful Saints you see the very plan of redemption has to have a manifestation you you can't have a business plan and execute it and nothing happened amen God started this plan of redemption and you know I don't want to make it sound like I think it's it's more powerful because the spoken word when it was spoken contained all the power necessary to bring it to pass Amen but look how it's speeding up look how everything is just coming and things are coming to pass very quickly and two sons and daughters of God - those whose eyes are open it's very obvious what is coming to pass many people still saying well we're looking for this and you say what but it's already come well it's not Elijah supposed to come no he's already come amen you see these things are happening and and the world you might say is behind the eight-ball but by God's grace we can look and say this is coming this is coming to see the stages of the plan coming to pass oh it to me it's so beautiful because you see when a prophet come and he spoke the words in that day people grasp that and they said praise the Lord and and they thought it was tomorrow that this was happening and years and decades go by and and it's there but the thing is my brother and sister the word is so powerful then all you got to do is just sit back you don't have to say now what do we got to do to see these things come to pass we set back and we just say Lord in your time in your time lawyer so we're not going to get weary in well-doing we're not going to set down on the job we're not going to say well I guess this didn't happen we're going to just say my God said it I believe it it's finished and when God said he finishes a work my brother and sister he finishes the work amen hallelujah hallelujah well praise the Lord you know I heard sister Jerry and sister Emmie practice that song yesterday but I'm telling you I had no clue how closely that coincided with what I wanted to speak today it just totally flew over my head when I heard them practicing it and then I'm sitting here hearing them singing it and thinking wow I couldn't have asked for a better song if I just said sister Jerry wants you to sing about my sermon but you see it's not my sermon it's God's sermon and so we would have had to have said you know sing about what God wants to speak today amen redemptions manifestation amen I I never was you know I always find a little humor thank you so much god bless you I find a little humor sometimes I've heard people say you know brother Donnie preaching on such-and-such part 257 I almost feel like I've wore out my thoughts on redemptions manifestation but we can't this was all about the plan of redemption this is all about redemption being revealed to you and I oh isn't that beautiful hallelujah I'd like to speak to you this morning on reflecting the glory of the Lord let's turn in 2nd Corinthians the 3rd chapter verses 1 through 18 now I use this very scripture on on Wednesday night but I I'm kind of dividing this thought off because this scripture kind of covers where I was at on Wednesday night but it also takes us at the latter verses of this where we want to be today amen and so I just say to each and everyone god bless you we love you in the Lord and I just pray that you know in spite of all this virus and all the things that they're doing the Christian life will never be muzzled by the things of this world no health pandemic no falls or Rises of a government none of that will ever hinder or bind the Christian life amen because that life is buried deep in Christ and we are in Christ so therefore the life is in us amen and as we read the other night you see Satan cannot defeat the Spirit of the Lord so he'll just attack you but remember while he's attacking you that the Spirit of the Lord is in you it is your very life so he can't defeat the Spirit of the Lord facing the Lord he knows he can't defeat you unless you let him so Lord has helped us to lift our hands and praise him in the good times and the bad times and whatever struggle there might be we just come and say III just Lord Here I am now I don't like to take other people's thoughts and other people's words without credit being due but I was listening to brother Danny steamin preached this morning and for just a few minutes it's a long story on how I come to that but my brother and sister he made a statement and then I just latched on to and he said we come on the basis we've been taught and come on the basis of only belief right we don't come and say well now if I can somehow take a science book or I can take something here and prove it we look at the Bible we believe the Bible only believe but brother Danny turned it around and he said the problem is we listen to too many voices we listen to too much other stuff and he says we've come to the place that we we only believe but what about this and what about that he said let's turn those words around only believe he said also believe only Amen not the Bible Plus Amen not the Bible in this opinion not the Bible and that opinion Amen only believe believe only this is sufficient hallelujah hallelujah amen second Corinthians a third chapter we'll read a few verses and allow you to be seated Amen do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known in read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Steel you know I just Saints I want to interject this I think that people if the Apostle Paul was standing here today would have a struggle with Paul they would think you think too much of yourself but my brother and sister Paul was just a vessel amen what God poured in Paul poured out hallelujah and that's what we are amen for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not on not in tables of stone Amen now I don't remember if I included that or not but I read the scriptures this morning you see God is taking our stony heart amen you see he's not writing it on stone Amen he needs someone who says Lord I'm just human and I fail you but I'm not going to quit a man that's what he's looking for well the one with that attitude of the Lord I make mistakes and I've made some pretty big ones but what separates me from many people is Lord I can't quit amen thank you lord Alleluia so it's not a matter of the who's perfect among us but it's whose heart has been turned from stone amen into the fleshly table of the heart and as such trust have we through Christ to God were not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also has made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit amen what it was the spirit that wrote on your heart amen is also the spirit that giveth life to you amen so it's not God wrote something on your heart you failed he cuts off the life no he writes it on your heart and he keeps putting the life into you to live up to what he put on your heart Oh hallelujah but if the stration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious you know that's reference to the ten commandments because no man could live it was glorious ten commandments are glorious I don't care how much time has passed my brother and sister the Ten Commandments still apply and if we're obedient to them amen not as unto the law but as on a desire to please God amen because if you do it as low law now you know I put this when I think about doing things as unto the law right we've been taught that we should obey the law given to Caesar what is Caesar's but how many of you spent last week you see how technical that could get oh ma I failed because I drove over the speed limit well if your intent was to drive over the speed limit you know I don't care what the law says I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do something's wrong but you see under the law mr. policeman radars you and says I'm writing you a ticket under grace mr. policeman comes to you and says I know you were probably preoccupied you know and what you were driving a little fast but I'm gonna let you off today with this little warning that that's not good to do see how many types that there is from the Word of God that comes right down in our natural life hallelujah but if the administration of death written engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious Heavenly Father we ask you for your blessings this morning Lord may you come down father rich in mercy Lord we ask you to come in our midst this morning you know what our needs are father Lord we don't need someone to stand in the pulpit Lord and and hammer away at us of our faults and failures what we need Lord is for you to come down and minister to our hearts this morning father that we can walk out Lord with liberty Lord knowing that we live under your auspices in your mercy father we thank you bless all that are here today may we enter in I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know I tell you my brother and sister I sometimes my mind and I hope I don't lose people when I do this but sometimes my mind is almost you know like a like a a net you know when we raised alfalfa seed you spend a lot of time out there in the field just sweeping a net to see what kind of little bugs might be crawling around in your crop and you you catch all kinds of things in there and just as a prophet of God opened it up said there's three kinds of believers my brother and sister you'll be out there with the net sweeping and you catch ladybugs and you also catch like us and so we look at that and realize that as we are here the Word of God God allows us to be able to come here in the word and later you might say in time we catch a point from over here and realize how those are connected together and so sometimes it's line and we go for a little season and another line of precept upon a precept and a word upon a word but ultimately God's coming and bringing continuity in his word that we realized the whole plan of God we start to see the opening of the word and what God has done for us and and it comes together you know this is how a child starts off which is playing with blocks with numbers on them and pretty soon they're designing the block amen so that's the progression that God has brought in to the bride of Jesus Christ and his word is opening to us in a progression amen for if the ministration of condemnation now my brother and sister living under the law would bring a season or a time of condemnation right when you knew I am wrong and many people as they would come now you know we see the word how it brings out and they would bring the lamb offering for their sin and you know a year later the priest might look out and might remember that man and the man might be coming and offering a lamb once again for the very sin that he brought a lamb for last year and that would have carried on in their life not really changing just the lamb become the covering for their sin but yet under the under the administration of the law which what brought condemnation it was actually glorious because it brought the people face to face with what was the issue of their life and my brother sir if we are honest with ourselves today we would lift a hand and say Lord bring me face to face with the issues of my life I don't want to bury my issue I don't want to leave it behind I don't want to forget about it to have it resurfaced many time sometime in the future but Lord let me come face to face with that and deal with it amen because we are no longer called to live under condemnation much more dust administration of righteousness exceed in glory so my brother and sister who would want to live under the law when you could live by the Spirit of the Lord in a Liberty knowing that God has ordained you from the foundation of the world to be an overcomer in the day that we live in amen so as we look here we'll see now for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect my reason of the glory that Excel it's so if one thing is glorious but you are in the presence of something much more glorious you're not going to sit there and look back to this lesser glory as it were and focus on it but you're gonna look to those things that are more glorious amen seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech I like this my brother and sister the Apostle Paul you know he moved from a point as it was that he was giving milk as it were to Pentecostal babies he was giving people that were coming God dealing them and pouring out the milk but Paul says we made a shift we have moved to a place that now we can move from just hinting these things to you that we can speak it directly we don't have to come and sugarcoat it any longer we don't have to come and make it palatable to you but we'll give this to you in a plainness of speech that you as a son or daughter of God can look at that and say you know that hurt I need to I need to you know as they use the phrase I need to raise my game but my brother and sister that's not going to cause you to turn away you simply bow a head lift and say Lord forgive me I'm gonna rise up to the standard that you have called me to amen you know that's the problem I don't I don't want to go this way but I want to just say this this morning that's the problem with many of the churches on the earth today is they don't want to offend the people they don't want to cause anybody to be uncomfortable and so they sugarcoat the gospel to the point it's no longer effective a man that is almost I read a little deal here a while back a man was talking about the medicine he took for his diabetes and he said you know this stuff is so horrible it was some kind of a liquid and he said this stuff is so horrible he says I need to add some sugar or something to make this edible amen well my brother and sister if we do that with the gospel we sugarcoat the gospel to make it palatable to us and we take all the effectiveness out of it then we might as well just say we are a club and and you know whatever instead of paying ties you could pay a membership fee amen so you look at these kind of things my brother and sister and realize what God is doing so in the beauty of this amen Moses in such glory not as Moses my brother and sister would put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded now I want to ask you real quick just in case I forget it a little later in my notes I want to ask you which is worse a man who is natural eyesight he is blinded or a man who is spiritually blinded amen just think about it I would rather finish the days of my life blind in the natural but my heart opened to the Word of God to the presence of God amen hallelujah for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Vail is done away in Christ so the very word of God is telling us that it is and we know this pertains to Israel but it also comes over into the Gentile world that my brother and sister at Vail that was there hallelujah now Vail that was blinding them the word says that veil has been taken away so we don't need an excuse of I got a veil what we need to do is pray for revelation amen the veil is gone the Word says so not hope not the message not someone else the Lord says that veil is taken away amen so we don't need a don't settle for well I just don't see it if it's there in the Word of God somebody presents it to you your first action ought to be to go to the Lord and say Lord it's in your word reveal it to me Lord I want to see that I want to see this but you see Israel to this very day my brother and sister still blinded the gospel being preached there's been many have gone there and preached and and the they are still veiled behind that veil but look we don't want to circumvent that some people say well we ought to go make a great presentation of the gospel to the to the Jews and whatever but look we can't push God's program amen let's just sit back and let's pray because it will come to pass but there's a secret Amen that's veiled in the word because you see my brother and sister the full opening of the word to them cannot take place until the full opening of the word has come to us everything in God's time everything in God's season amen so we cannot circumvent the plan of God and say well we'll go and take the veil from their eyes no you can't do that you can preach Jesus Christ to them all you want to preach and they still will not be able to see it amen hallelujah but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when there shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty can someone say Amen this morning but we all I love this and now this is part I'm trying to scroll the screen here hold mine but we all with open face beholding as in a glass Amen have you ever looked through that that glass hard to look through not a perfect image you cannot get a perfect reflection from something that is beyond the glass through the glass are you with me but we all with an open face this is meaning that we all with good conscience amen we don't have some kind of a idea some kind of a plan some kind of theory but we with an open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image Oh hallelujah I might not see clearly the image right now but I have a promise of God's Word I'm gonna be changed into that image hallelujah so one man says this is the image another says this is the image I'm sorry I'm not listening to you I know that the word has said that I would be changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord hallelujah the Holy Ghost in orme it's coming down moving changing you changing me molding us into the very image of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah we ask Lord for your blessings upon the word today amen hallelujah oh you know I sometimes just get a little excited forgive me you know I was sitting there this morning I thought my honest I just felt like I got up way too early and I said they're just kind of hard time to wrap my thoughts and and you know as I was trying to finish up this thought this morning and and I was just like lord I need you to help me and I tell you come right down and all of a sudden I just I don't even know how to describe it to you just had a big smile on my face and just seemed like everything just just started falling in place and and I pray today that I can I can express it it won't be an inadequacy of the word if there's any inadequacy this morning it will be in my expression of it to you amen now look my brother and sister brother Brown speaks in the ephesian church age he talks about of reason and purpose of being said youthful that God is a redeemer he needed someone to redeem he he needed a reason or purpose of being he wanted to be a healer so he needed some that needed healing a man needed someone that needed saved Amen so we looked at and realized now we're not trying to apply the human element of reason and purpose to our Lord but to God but my brother and sister to understand that we were created in His image and oftentimes it you know we we need to to express ourself we need to do something you know oftentimes I would just say this you know there's something in us that we want to do and you'll find someone that the words flow easily to them and they realize over a period of time that they love to write poetry that had to be something in them that needed to be expressed because I have never in my life ever wanted to write poetry so there's not something within me if you follow what I'm saying so it's not in me to to write poetry but I realized later on in life as you know I started to minister started to pastor the church and that the desire to express things has been in me since I was a little boy my own family used to say my you know if we could ever get him to shut up you know but that was in me just a real desire to express things to speak it out and you know it's in each one of us and so here is here we are and the image of God and so if God had a reason needed or wanted a reason or purpose of being amen his plan to be our Redeemer now my brother and sister if God chose not to be a healer that was his decision amen but it was in him to be a healer so that had to come out amen and it was in him amen the joy that we possess as sons and daughters of God is not a joy that we have naturally but it is a joy that was in God to have a creation and have a people that he could serve amen now we look at this you say now what did you say is serving us well my brother and sister does he not our God constantly is serving us he sees a need he comes and he brings something to deal with our need if that is not a heart of a servant then I don't know what is he does not want to see his children suffer he does not sometimes he allows those things to maybe break a very willful spirit a stubborn spirit God would allow those things as the hedge was opened with Joel but my brother and sister of God is a serving God amen and so the very desire to serve a people which is asked the Redeem amen he placed in us that we turn around and if a man is serving God today a man or a woman boy or girl serving God today out of a fear of going to hell then you have missed the very Spirit of God because God said no I put this in you your desire to serve amen not to be a slave but the desire to serve people sometimes say well you know they talk like well you'll be a servant my brother and sister being a servant is a glorious position amen so a servant that truly knows how to serve let me just put it this way you can go into a restaurant a lovely place the flowers the candles anniversary birthday whatever it might be and a poor servant can ruin your whole evening amen now my brother and sister a poor servant in the house of God could take a Sunday morning which we've already felt the presence of God moving arm is a poor serve could take that moving of the Holy Spirit and leave it flat and dry and the people go home wondering what happened today do you see it's all in the nature or desire of the servant amen so if we'll come with a servant's heart Lord you serve us you bring your word you save us you heal us you provide for us now Lord not out of obligation but out of a heart's desire I come back to serve you I come back to to be obedient to your word as a form of service because I love you Lord too many people are caught up in this I got to this and I got to that I remember one time hearing an individual say well I you know our church says well my brother and sister they've missed it because it's not the church that should be saying you should be saying my Lord said Amen I saw in his word and he spoke to me that he wants me to do this and this to quit doing this and this and you know serve Him with all my heart mind body and soul amen so we see now as it is of the reason and purpose of being if we as Christians do not find our reason and purpose of being my brother and sister then we'll be faithful in church we'll do all those things that we're called to give but never reap the full benefit of what God intended for us to have from that Amen now look this message of restoration look it's not just another religious movement what the earth does not need is another religious movement we've already got so many people are confused because this church says this and the church just down the street says this - this or this Plus this or this and that and people are confused legitimately confused I don't know whether I should this I don't know whether I should that I don't know you know because this one says this but my brother and sister when you come to the place that the message of restoration is getting us right very simple here nothing deep today getting us right back to the word right let the word become your absolute amen it don't need to be this Minister on the radio this Minister on the television this minister in this church what did the Word of God say right this is God in written form speaking to you and I amen and we cannot as we well know hey man I'm just going back to stir up your pure Minds and remembrance as we well know my brother and sister God will not contradict his Bible now when you look at this I just love this revelations 19 is actually one of my favorite scriptures chapters of the Bible amen verse 7 is actually would rank right at the top of my favorite scriptures he says after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God for a true and righteous are his judgments now my brother and sister he concern earns me when I look in the world today I don't get much sister Jerry and I are just slowly pulling away from any kinds of social medias any real influence in our life but my brother and sister when you have people that feel like and they will voice it they'll put it in print push send or whatever it is and send it to the whole wide world that they think God is harsh now my brother and sisters there knowing a different side of God than I know because while God has if I could put it in this as sound like I'm contradicting myself but I can tell you an own testimony of years gone by that God will break your body to get your attention oh just like the shepherd with a little lamb that keeps wandering off well after a while break its leg so that he gets to hold it carry it and my I'll tell you my god and I'm standing here doubt 58 years old and I'll tell you thank you Lord for about tearing my right leg off my body amen because that's one of the things it took to catch my attention to realize I was going down the wrong path and many things were not not good amen hallelujah so you look at this now for true and righteous or his judgment he had judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they say Alleluia and her smoke rose up forever and ever and the four and twenty elders and four beasts fell down and worshiped God that sat on the throne saying amen Alleluia and a voice came out of the throne now you see my brother and sister this would not have been God Himself speaking saying praise me praise me come on praise me but it would be the Spirit of God because the Spirit of God is life and you can't have life and not praise Him now look many times I've kind of maybe harass maybe somebody I heard the word harassed used once that brother Paul harasses us to worship the Lord well if you view that as harassment then well I'll tell you what you won't know what to do when I finally decide to harass amen you see you cannot serve God and not worship Him it's just an impossibility there is just no way to truly serve God from the depths of your soul and not something rise up in you to praise God amen it's just an impossibility and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye is servants either fear Him both small and great now look my brother and sister however you want to interpret this a voice come from the throne I'm not trying to dictate nothing to you but it's the Spirit of God that leads sons and daughters of God amen we're not led by any other spirit there's not an angel that just comes down from heaven and says well I just thought I'd do God a favor and tell you to do something no they go where they are sent Amen where they are led amen when God says I want you to go speak I want you to go do they do that upon the commandment of God amen so this is not another voice and as I heard it were the voices of a great multitude and the voice of many waters is a voice of mighty thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us hmm hallelujah let us be sad downcast and downtrodden and unable to lift our hands unable to lift our voices unable to stomp a foot unable know my brother and sister not some new-age interpretation of the Bible but this says here let us be glad hallelujah and rejoice hallelujah that all my goodness and give our little honor to him oh how do you give honor my brother and sister you give honor by give back the praise that God said I poured myself into you and that filling you up are able to give that back and my brother and sister let me put it this way in a natural Webster dictionary form of giving honor that is to speak in a high and lofty manner of praise of the character of the one being spoken about hallelujah my god is good my god is awesome my god is a glorious beyond measure hallelujah I want to give honor to him I don't want to talk about I wish God would do this and I wish God would do that I say thank you lord then I've got breath in this body life in this body to lift you up and praise your name hallelujah Oh for the marriage of the Lamb that come now if we cut that scripture off right there and we didn't speak no more that ought to be enough to take every son and daughter of God and make them come to the place that they would say Lord I want to be ready if the wedding is happening Lord I want my dress on Lord if you are moving in the midst of your people then I want to be open to receive of that that ought to move us enough without even the last line but look at this and his wife who is she who is she Saints I think we should know who she is we are his wife amen and what did she do she put her feet to action she didn't sit back and say well when the bridegroom comes and brings me a wedding dress and when he comes and does this and when he comes and does that and when he speaks this and speaks that what does she do she said you know what there's going to be a marriage of the Lamb it's going to happen the word senseful there's going to be a marriage of the Lamb and I am his wife and I'm going to be ready there is nothing that has stopped me from being ready allelujah I'll tell you what no girl that ever was serious about getting married sit back and said well I've got it I've got six months I've got five months I've got four months I've got three months I've got two months I've got one month I've got three weeks I got two weeks I've got one week I've got four six days five days four days three days two days I think I better go shopping this morning never happened my brother and sister I've not seen it yet hey man I've heard many of dads say my goodness you thought the wedding was happening tomorrow they're driving here and they're driving there and they've got dresses and flowers and they've got this and they've got that and they've got it and our house is clear fall of it and it's still three months that comes from Oh true story brother you said I'm about ready to be pushed out in the garage because they filled the house full of everything to do with my daughter's wedding oh I think it's a perfect type my brother and sister amen the bride she's not waiting that was the foolish virgin amen we got to learn to separate that the foolish virgin was the one that said well I've got a lamp and I've got a vessel and I know that he's gonna come but everything's good life is good god is good but no oil burn off him that's not who we are hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife Helen lujah has made herself ready now look what's happened by the very act of making herself ready was granted to her that she would be arrayed in fine linen it's kind of it's kind of an interesting thing it's kind of I don't know if you'd call it a fad or whatever but many a young lady now partly I think it's because of the condition of the economy but many young lady is getting married in and you might say secondhand dress now if you're thinking about this natural whatever please don't lock this down like I'm opposed to this but you see the Bride of Christ is not going to be married in a secondhand dress now you say brother Paul what are you getting at well I would be getting at you getting married to the Lord Jesus Christ based on someone else's testimony can't happen can't happen you yourself have to come see you've made the preparation and to you is granted that you would be arrayed in the fine linen of the pure Word of God not somebody said that somebody said not that somebody says I was with a prophet I was with this one I was with that one my brother's sister that won't do it we're not called as the Bride of Christ to get married in a secondhand dress when the natural is that's an entirely different thing amen but you look at this now fine linen clean and white fine linen is my pastors righteousness the prophets righteousness brother Solon's whose righteousness no sir no sir Amen this fine linen is the righteousness of saints hallelujah I say let's thank the Lord for that hallelujah I love I love I respect many a man Amen that many a men's had influence on my life but my brother and sister by the grace of God learned many years ago I got to move on till this is real to me amen till this has been revealed to me I can't take it that someone says this is this and this is that you know it's just like a young man we were talking to the other day he said there was a time he said I remember in the message where everybody said you know now you have to see the third poll if you don't believe the third poll you're not the bride you're not going in a rapture and you know what that's correct that's just the opening of the hey let's not make it more complicated it is God promised he would open word to you and I amen but when you say yeah if you believe the third Pole everything's good God opened his word hallelujah I'm saved huh what did the word that was open say where do you fit in the opened word hey man you can't just say I believe it I believe it it's gotta be someplace in there you find yourself Amen now I'm not speaking here I believe we're amongst godly people but my brother and sister you know you might have taken the same word and that same word might send one man to heaven send another man to hell you can't just say oh I believe that what do you believe amen let's not do a generality amen Oh lelou yeah and he said unto me write blessed are they which are called oh look how blessed we are today saying that God would just be gracious enough to put on our heart and we would desire to be a part of this hey man blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God now as we're speaking this morning amen we are talking about coming or being the reflecting the glory of the Lord now my brother and sister if we are here a clothed now in the righteousness of saints then that is going to produce something in us now this is quite some time back I just draw the thought but we had the liberty or the blessing to be able to speak this thought down in Phoenix but my brother and sister for every action there is a reaction and you cannot put on this garment which is the fine linen which is the righteousness of the saints and that very action as it were of putting that garment on will bring a reaction in you you can't say I put on the garment and nothing changed it will bring a reaction in you and I Amen as you walk into the word if the action of walking into the word my sister you say well you know the Lord dealt with my heart and I know I need to change my life and I'm moving in that direction but it doesn't seem like maybe I still smoke maybe I still have a little problem here a little problem there my brother and sister don't get discouraged of that you just keep walking and though promise of the Word of God says if you walk into the word that it will walk you and it will wash you whiter than snow oh my how white is snow and it will wash you whiter and so so the very action now of putting on this garment of fine linen the righteousness of God will change us Oh hallelujah I don't care how big the issue is how little the issue is what the issue might be but the very action of walking into that and the very action my brother and sister of hearing the call means you're blessed well praise the Lord praise the Lord who who wants to be blessed I'll say every one of us had lift our hand today and I can tell you right now you are blessed because you have heard God's call on your life amen now look get myself confused here excuse me you see my brother and sister this finished work of the Lord now did God not say that he would finish this work he began in us so this finished work of the Lord I think all of us ought to actually you know we ought to actually do that I still think about brother bud Southwick talk about a rugged mountain man a man that just you know he was just a tough character and you all know the story how how that he was going out there and he just couldn't give up cigarettes and you know he's there and he gets up off it's a little caught there and he says well go out and I'm gonna check the horses one last time and he goes out there to the far end down stand downwind of everything I'm far into where the horses are tied and pulls out a cigarette and he's about to light the thing and brother Branham says I'll attempt he says now brother bud when was it that you gave up smoking now if we stop in the rationale and reason that human Humanity would say it's a he hasn't right I haven't given it up I've got a cigarette in my fingers but you see it took those words that time that place and inspiration come down and What did he say well just as soon as I know right now never smoked another one in his life you see what he did is he responded to a voice that actually that voice come from the very throne of God it wasn't a man speaking to him that was God telling him this is your moment of deliverance accept it receive say right now if God deals with a heart Saints I'm talking to myself also God deals with our heart concerning something don't say Lord well win this or Lord well win that just right now Lord right now I'm finished with this right now hey man I'm done with this thing amen because you see when the Spirit of the Lord moves amen because the scripture says the Spirit of the Lord is life amen so God doesn't deal with us to make our life harder come on look I know a brother I know a brother that was delivered from from an addiction cold turkey delivered from that addiction and shook like a leaf for three or four weeks while that heroin left his body now why would God not heal him from the withdrawal as well as the desire for I don't have an answer for that but I know he never had a desire to ever inject heroin in his body ever again but he now get this he's going through withdrawals which would you think would cause him to desire for more to deal with the result but he had no desire for the heroin but his body still had to do the withdrawal now what the prophet of God talked about healing then people be prayed for in the name of Jesus Christ declared that you are healed and they go home and get sick as a dog and they would be there and had been easy to say well I guess I wasn't healed but you see the withdrawal are you with me the withdrawal of that had to bring and the body had to then come and purge that in many cases but others were delivered instantly no sign ever again to be seen I don't know how God does it I just thanked him today he does I thanked him today he doesn't if I have to go as it were with withdrawal of something in my life that on this trouble with that thank your Lord that I know whatever want to go back to that Amen that's what we need to look at right not our circumstance see the problem is we're becoming a people that are focused on our circumstance when we should be focused on what the promise of God that was spoken is I forget your circumstance forget all those things look at the promise to say my God said it I believe it Amen it's going to come to pass it's going to come to pass it might be difficult along the way but it will come to pass hallelujah Amen now look how I just want to come in here you see this finished work of the Lord the wife right that we were talking about Amen this Bride of Christ right is through the scripture it's kind of interesting when you talk to somebody who says they read their Bible and you say something about being the Bride of Christ or the wife and they say that's in the Bible come on Saints I'll admonish you and I'll admonish me right along with it if you don't know your Bible you can't expect it to work for you can I share a little humor this young man and this young woman got married she had him boiled water her mama had pampered her from the day she was born she was 18 20 years old hadn't even boiled water in her life and she's she's there and her husband's like honey we can't afford to keep going out and eating every night going out and eating somewhere we're gonna have to start eating at home and she said well honey you know I don't know how to cook and he says we'll just do something and he comes home the first night and and this this whatever it was on the plate he can't even identify it he tastes it he's like oh this is terrible let's go out to eat and so after a little bit of time of that he says like honey he says what is this stuff she said why I don't know honey I just go in the kitchen and I first thing I see I just get some of that and put it in a pan and I get this and put it in a pan and put this in a pan and he says and that's what I end up with and he says honey have you ever heard of a cookbook and she said well yeah we got about a half a dozen of them for her wedding presents he said would you please read one now Saints we got no excuse we've got the perfect recipe for the overcoming life we got the perfect recipe to be filled with the Holy Ghost we've got something that is so scrumptious to the bride of Jesus Christ that you shouldn't be able to resist it hmm praise the Lord shouldn't be able to resist it now look we have seen his star and come to worship Him he said I think the light shines best in darkness the darker it is the better of the light shines sometimes just a small light well I'm not much of a Christian I'm not this I'm not that it's plenty dark out there you don't worry about what your status is as a Christian you whether you feel like you're some kind of giant slayer or whether you just feel like you're just a little bitty Christian it's dark enough out there your light will shine hallelujah amen where there's much light it's not noticed but the darker gets that small light will shine that much stronger and remember that there's no darkness can exist in the presence of life light is so much more powerful than darkness until it cannot stand in its presence hallelujah there's a man here that not oh not to miss do a title here you know a man can turn on the light I'm telling you as a man here who has already turned on the light hey men we don't need we're not waiting for somebody to turn the light on the light is on hallelujah amen it cannot stand its present darkness cannot stand when the light starts to shine because the Sun is so much greater the sunlight that it just presses the darkness out and it's no more and this dark world someday is going to turn to all light when Jesus Christ the son of righteousness amen the very one that's closing you right we're clothed in righteousness so Christ the son of righteousness and come again then he'll have no more darkness that time just as we look out at night time and see the moon shining the moon and the Sun is husband and wife as to say and in the absence of the Sun the moon reflects the light of the Sun hallelujah my brother and sister we shouldn't be reflecting anything else but the light of the Sun amen to the earth giving it a lesser light right I'm not God but God's in me amen hallelujah I can't stand here and say I'm God but God's in me to such a portion that before I was even born the scripture says he formed me come on think about it you say but I'm short I'm tall I'm this I'm that they're handsome I'm ugly God formed you now in the natural ice cream and Donuts might be forming you but in the spiritual you are what God formed you to be now let your potential out don't sit back and be a lazy Christian amen hallelujah I knew some folks had a turtle one time and they would always get it out of its little thing there and the the kid that I hung out with little sister would get it out of the deal and then she would hold the turtle and she would feed the turtle I forget what they fed it but she would feed the turtle and it would there and take a bite she would hold it right there for it she spoiled that turtle so bad yes you can spoil a turtle she spoiled that turtle so bad you could put it back in its little aquarium thing and put the very food at eight right in front of its nose and it wouldn't eat it would sit there and open its mouth it wanted someone to shove it in come on come on burn in the Sun husband wife is seyd absences Sun the moon reflects hmm I think he's talking about us to the earth giving a lesser light that we can see how to get around by the moonlight until the Sun rises and then the Sun and the moon becomes one hmm I'm eaten on this the sunlight in the moonlight is all the same that's what the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ should be reflecting the light of him while he is absent from the earth in a physical body the the church should be the reflection of Jesus Christ in these dark hours when Santa Claus and tinsel all over the street we should scream out it's the birth of Jesus Christ not the visit of Saint Nicholas amen we were living in an awful dark time and that's when our light should really shine now before we read God's Word I wonder this that if we will honor his word oh another thought jumps in here now he'll honor his word how do we honor his word we honor his word by reading it then believing it now we should read it faith cometh by hearing that if we honor it by reading then we honor him by believing what we have read amen it's not an intellectual thing my brother and sister pick up your Bible read it believe it and watch it dominate your life now if you don't want to be dominated you know remember I'm out still to this day remember the look on your faces when I said that you know stood in front of you in church and said here I need to admit to you that I am a manipulator many of you your eyeballs went oh what's coming next but the truth is my brother and sister to be manipulators to be placed into a position that you don't want to be or don't know that you want to be now every preacher preaching the gospel should have the courage enough to be able to say I want to be a manipulator because what I want to do is move you into the presence of Almighty God that's what we came to church for to get in the presence of God and sometimes come on I'm not meaning to be funny this morning but sometimes we come into church some of us are just dragging so much our life is such a mess and everything about it I just don't know and you don't get nothing out of church because you're thinking about mortgage payments car payments kids this that and the other some of you come together to church you fought with your husband or your wife or your kids all the way to church you walk in here you feel so condemned you know the preacher could just be open the door to heaven to you and you wouldn't you walk to it because I'm not worthy enough to walk through it some of you come here with your mind stuck on these things and this thing and that thing my brother and sister sometimes somebody needs to come out and kind of shake you a little bit get your attention look quit looking at yourself I'm gonna go back to your house and I'm gonna bust all the mirrors in your house cuz you're in there looking at yourself going wool unto me but how about we get another mirror that when you look into that mirror you know see the reflection of you I'll put it back to me here don't see the reflection of Paul Haley I see the reflection of Jesus Christ because I know it's not paul halen paul halen is on the fast track to hell if left on paul hey let's drain but if i stand in the Word of God and say you know what Lord I just surrender myself to you I just want to serve you I want to love your Lord and you'll start looking into that mirror and you won't see a reflection of yourself you'll start to see the reflection of the Word of God Christ in you hallelujah that's the reflection we're looking for not some natural mirror as I read the scripture to you earlier I won't go back to it for the second time that my brother and sister we're looking in the glass darkly but the one promise we have of that word is that when he is revealed to us we won't look like us we will look like him hallelujah that's what the words about amen so we should read it faith cometh by hearing then if we honor it by reading it then we should honor him by believing what we have read Oh hallelujah you gotta just shut the devil up you know I saw a little thing the other day I thought was quite interesting people don't want you to hear their opinion they want to hear their opinion coming from your mouth and that's what the devil wants my brother and sister he wants to hear his opinion coming from our mouth well I'm sorry to disappoint you devil but I'm gonna take one counselor and one counselor only one version of the gospel and one version only Amen one light and one light only and that's going to be my Lord Jesus Christ I'm not going to take this man's thoughts and that man's thoughts the prophet of God the other day said somebody come to me to correct me they said you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong and I'm just paraphrasing this he's you know what he said I'm not gonna take they said because he will correct me hallelujah amen it's not for us to go around correct and you you see you know my brother and sister how it is now I know wives always agree with their husbands in a perfect world but you know how we were encouraged to change a mind prayer you know I hope you see the humor of this you leave the men here now not all of us have the same interest but you leave here they'll have their wife and a headlock saying you're going to Sportsman's Warehouse with me but now you got the wife over here and you leave it be and she's got the husband in a headlock and you're going to Hobby Lobby with me now just take that in a deeper thing I don't want to spend all the time to go into that you go into the issues of marriage and family children and all of this other stuff you don't go around the house and headlocks and and rebuttals and all of this stuff what do you do you spend your time praying you spend your time praying and you know as my daddy taught me years and years ago and I'm thankful for that because it's been a real blessing to me my whole life you know everybody says there's two sides to every story right my daddy said no there's three sides there's your side their side and the absolute truth now let's not be winning people to our opinion my brother and sister let's be coming together on the absolute truth amen not to get people over here into this ideology not to get them into this ideology but get them to including ourself the absolute truth hallelujah amen so you want to honor him as we were talking about honor earlier you want to give honor to the Lord believe his word hallelujah yeah yeah now hallelujah in dude one in 20 but gee beloved waiting for the Lord to build you up you see we have a part in all of this we're not hothouse plants we're not turtles that won't eat until the Masters daughter shoves it down our throat for us but you beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the Holy Ghost you see we have a portion in this that we come and we read the word we honor God by obeying it and it is building us up you cannot I say this emphatically and if I'm wrong I would apologize but if I'm wrong then we're all toast my brother and sister you cannot pray and not read your Bible and it not build you up it is an impossibility if you will spend the time you will spend the effort you will put it with integrity right it says praying in your morning I don't want to go to work attitude praying in I just fought with the wife atmosphere you see there's a difference in this you've got to get into the Holy Ghost and pray in a whole different context you know what that means that means you have had to separate yourself from everything that would hinder you everything that would be you need to just make it a habit I know a brother he pastors a church he said brother Paul you talk about the weirdest thing he said we just was going through a little struggle in the church and he said I would get off work and I wouldn't even go home from work I would go to the church and I would spend whatever time I could undid or whatever out the church and he said I might be there to church just praying away things started to improve the atmosphere the church started to improve and he said then something started happening I've got it was down on my hands and knees I'd be there praying O Lord you know need you to move in our church need you my phone would ring and he said it's a human instinct oh I better take that call close it up oh no where was i praying and he said every single day my phone started ringing while I was praying until one day I had this flash wait I'm not even going to silence it because it still goes turned it off devil I just shut you off and he's praying and nobody ever comes to the church at that time of day hey anybody owner oh there's a car parked outside there's probably somebody there yeah what do you want well I've been wanting to ask you what do you believe well this is what we believe I don't believe that bye but you see what was happening it wasn't about these people it wasn't about phone calls it wasn't matter it was about the distraction to keep him from getting in the spirit to pray finally he's like okay what am I gonna do went by the little shop down there and got him some of them ear muffs deals and went into the fart of this back corner of the church and prayed my brother and sister the devil will do everything he can do to keep you man praying in the Holy but I pray every night brother Paul I pray every night I before I go to bed I pray every night come on I'm not making light of this Saints but I know how you are I mean people like you are Lord now we need you to do this and Lord you need to do that and my husband doesn't cooperate my wife doesn't cooperate and Lord somehow and you beat some sense in my children lord please be with me I hate my job but I got to go there tomorrow Lord thank you for a good night's sleep am I wrong did I miss something come on praying and the Holy Ghost Lord I want to hear from you I need to hear from you lord I need you to bless my family I need your Lord my children might be lost right now but they're coming back Lord I'm claiming them in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord you know if this job is here and it's not a very good job and Lord if I'm supposed to be there then Lord give me the patience to be there and Lord this is Oh Lord because we need the Holy Ghost I want to see you move in my church I want to see you move in my life I want to have the world open to me lord I need you Lord not some dead prayer Saints wait that Lord just told me that all wasn't for you that was for me see how we're all guilty none are exempt keep yourself of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ into eternal life and to some compassion making a difference others say with fear don't you love that some we have compassion brother sister it's tough you can do it come on I'm praying for you lean on me you can do it others look you know you keep going where you're going I think brother David brother Chris I can tell you for sure for myself I've had to come to that place before look people in the face and say you keep going the route you're going you will find yourself in a judgement and in the lake of fire and unfortunately this moment of time they've still plowed that route headed right on how others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy though to the want to the only wise God Our Saviour be glory and Majesty and Dominion power both now and ever amen you see I wanted to focus on verse 24 really and so I wanted to focus see there's one here he's already present he's already with us he's already opened his word to us that is able to keep us from falling we don't have to say well you know I know and my children move out they're going to just go to the devil and they're gonna this and that and whatever else in the world's full of pot and drugs and alcohol and and this that no no you don't have to accept that we got one that's able to keep us from falling hallelujah introduce your kids to them do it personally though don't let someone else beat the introduction oh my can I go on just it yes moment further amen now you see my brother and sister we're not operating in our own light and we can't operate in another's light we can't operate in the church's light got to come to the place that we are reflecting the glory of the Lord it's not a second hand you know I always just think about that you know when the death angel come down through Goshen my brother and sister when the little boy is sitting there kind of to to just kind of bring that out little boy sitting there in and he looks out the window and he sees that death angel come down to his best friend's house and he knows what he's heard him say you know it's the eldest and all this stuff and then he hears a weeping and wailing and crying and screaming and and he runs to his daddy and wraps his arms around him and says daddy you know that death angel I just saw it go to Johnny's house and they're now screaming and crying over there daddy are you sure daddy didn't say well now the preacher said you know what daddy did death angels just down the street it's not a theory it's not a myth it's not a story now it's reality and daddy says son we still got a moment goes over there and opens that front door steps out there and he says son what do you see he says daddy I see the blood you'll be all right you can't tell me the child won't be affected when the Death Angel comes in swoops at their front door and then moves on down the street that child will know that the blood of Jesus Christ is real Oh God led us as parents as pastors as preachers as brothers and sisters in Christ not be there thinking well someone else will do this let us get the blood over the door let us get the Word of God into our house and let it come and and cover us my brother and sister that our children you'll have to grow up in a world where they say I don't know if there's a god or not let us know that the blood is on the door of our house and we're gonna live like the blood is on the door of our house we're not going to live like just any old family we have the blood Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now look my brother and sister I just want to say this and it might seem a little bit out here and I hope I don't offend anybody but Hollywood Disney all of those cable channel things Redbox Facebook Twitter this and snapchat that and zoom this and whatever else I you you have them if you want to but I'll tell you what they won't do my brother and sister they we'll never build you up you can't walk out of the house of God and go home and watch Disney Princesses and never be built up hey man we got to introduce our families our house our church back to the Word of God and let the word be what builds us up let the word be what satisfies the soul now I'm not talking about you never having a moment of recreation as it were with a family but my brother and sister we're an increasing world where we are giving this off we're handing our families we're handing our churches off to this nonsense that says all you know Hollywood's making these lovely Christian movies now now when did a devil ever make a movie that would be a blessing to the house of God to the kingdom of God come on there's underlying sub messages underlying things that are put in the twisting of the Word of God now you might say brother Paul you're going haywire it's more as good sermon up till now oh praise the Lord I didn't want you to leave too happy come on Saints now go write this down go home read or listen to the whole previous context coming right on through I don't want to sound like I'm isolating something he said I went out on Lakeshore Drive we have one of those but he's talking about Chicago and I stood there a little while and I noticed all them waves jumping up and down just to splashing around and I thought what's it so excited about what's all the excitement and the little waves would start and then run out and the great big waves and bounce into each other and break apart and the phone would fly up and then he'd come back in now I see the big waves coming in again breaking on the bank like you're used to here but that was something new for me and landlocked serpent so I I noticed how it would and I said well it must be that the lakes having a revival must be what it is it's having a big time just jumping up and down I thought that's good that's fine but you know I thought I wonder if it got a lot of extra water in it when it's having a revival and I thought no there isn't one more drop in it right now than if it was perfectly calm not one bit it's the same water but it's just having a revival jumping up and down now to those that think I harp or harass about worshiping the Lord you might like this up to this point praise the Lord I don't jump up and down and I got every bit as much we'll go to the next part amen don't want to leave you disappointed I thought well well good does that do hmm.well good does that do know that getting excited brother Paul and walking all over the church and stomping your feet and waving your arms and slobbering what goods that do hmm come to find out when it's having a revival and jumping up and down like that it washes all the trash out of it up on the shore that's what the church needs is a revival get all the world and the world washed out so it can look clear now I want to bring this back to you coming back to our thought today you don't see a reflection when the waters all broken up and splashing there's no reflection to be seen but neither do you see a reflection on dirty water it's got all kinds of bits of bark and twigs and this and that you don't see a clear reflection oh when it gets all washed out so it can look clear be pretty again when that water is calm and it's clean you lean over the side of the boat the dock whatever you look you see a reflection Oh hallelujah what causes the sea to do that is because there is wind comes begins to blow against the waves blow against the body of water and pick it up that's what the church needs tonight well it changed the message here if you don't mind that's what the church needs today it's a mighty rushing wind coming down upon it again reviving it getting all the world out the things of the world out that way when it starts a revival then when it settles down the church is in a condition to start off then to receive spiritual gifts and blessings from God and that's what we want hallelujah I don't want to just keep going to church you keep going to church and talking about one day God's gonna move in our midst hey man I say let's have a revival let it wash the trash out get it all throwed out on the bank amen let that day in another place brother Branham says there that that wind that came down on the day of Pentecost not just any ol wind maybe you get some guy that does a windbag amen and he can emotionally crush you to the point that you think you ought to go to the altar and cry out but there's nothing moving you let's settle for the Holy Ghost the wind that came on the day of Pentecost move in our midst the worse the trash out and then we church grace we can be ready to receive the supernatural the spiritual glyphs gifts and the blessings from God and if you want to sign up on that program hallelujah I want that hey man I want God get the trash out of my life now you say now brother Paul are you speaking specifically to me well no if the Lord is speaking to you then you're being spoken to I'm just telling you this is what the word says this is what message says this is what we do and I'll tell you what I'm just a simple enough guy look at it and I say make sense to me hey man Lord just come wash all the trash out of my life I'm not exempt say our pastor is not exempt no your pastor is not exempt the trash can collect up wash it out Lord wash it down Alleluia oh praise the Lord sister Emmy will you come amen otherwise I I just might keep going on forever you know Laodicean Church age will close this out right here he's a sovereign God by his own counsel he purposed the plan of the summation of his own elect which he foreknew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of salvation Holy Spirit carefully execute the will of the Father he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will amen he is right in the midst of it all he's in the midst of his church I say amen to that today I believe God's right here in the midst of his church this great creator Savior God is faithfully working amongst his own right now as the great Shepherd of the Sheep his very existence is for his own he's not being God just to be God he's been God for you and I he's being God that the plan of redemption would be manifested Oh hallelujah he loves them and cares for them his eye is ever upon them when the word says that your lives are hid with Christ in God it means exactly what it says and I'm so glad that my god abides faithful it is true to himself he won't lie he's true to his word he will back it up he is true to us he will lose none of us but raise us up in the last day and I'm glad that I'm resting in his faithfulness Philippians 1:6 well I just want to step over into another something whether Paul your liberal and your interpretation that deceived the very left if it were possible no I'm not I'm confident being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day Jesus Christ I'm not literal I'm not grasping something out here just hoping it would be I've got a confidence that God called me and it's coming to pass and it will my brother and sister he will not take us along this path of life and dump us off at the end because somehow we didn't perform he made a promise he said you know what I'll do I'll come down and I'll mold you will you come to the day that great struggle great trials look Saints we don't even have to go through this church and testify we know each other well enough God knows how to change our mind God knows how to change our course God knows how to introduce us to a deeper relationship God can do all this he doesn't come along and say well you know not like some employer with high demands you know you just don't cut the mustard we'll find someone else no God says you know what if you need my hair achter I will mold more character into you you need more faith I will release more faith in you amen if you need to trust I will bring you to the place you've got no choice but to trust me hallelujah being confident of this very thing that he which began a good work in you will perform it into the day of Jesus Christ he is a true witness now this word true is the same word we saw back there in Revelation 3 7 you recall what it does not mean that true is in contrast to false many times people are there they caught up they think oh yeah okay true true false true full look what he says it has a rich or deeper meaning by far it expresses perfect realization in contrast to partial realization well praise the Lord you mean I can be anointed by the Holy Ghost some people say you got the Holy Ghost it's done it's finished you got the Holy Ghost but you know now I can't defend it I'm gonna be bold enough to speak it to you but I can't take you to a quote or a direct scripture but it's continuity through the Word of God you have the Holy Ghost my major some people say wait not to only go sets yet no I'm sorry but is the Holy Ghost the Spirit of God it's God himself the Holy Ghost is not a third entity that was hired to come over and take care of business and it is not just part of the father's son or the Holy Spirit it's God himself now if revelation we've been taught to pray for revelation if revelation is a revealing you don't get one revelation or no God right but revelation is an unending unfolding unrevealing you know what been married is sister Jerry 37 years [Music] haven't figured nothing out yet still working on that now if it can be such in the natural I'd like to just tell you guys something you know when your wife tells you I like this but then the next day she says I like this so you think she changed her mind from liking this to this so then you shift over here and say well I guess that's okay then she shows up with this and you're like but I thought you liked that well yeah I liked it but I didn't want it but you didn't say you wanted this either that you just like this so I'm confused what was I who just didn't catch the way I said it okay yes that's good [Music] until a few days later she says I really didn't want that I really want this but I thought you said you want that and you went and got that so I figured you didn't want that no I want that but I don't want this and I want this one because I think this one but I need to take a piece of a countertop and put in this one to see if this looks like it would be like that okay whatever you want look my brother and sister that's not how God's working it's not how God's working God says you know what I'm gonna reveal and sister Kari he said I'm gonna reveal a little bit of myself to you today and it might be a day a week a month I hope not a year and God comes and says I'm gonna I'm gonna reveal a little bit more of me but now you got to forget what I already revealed [Music] No what's he doing every revelation adds to the vision or the picture of Jesus Christ every revelation we don't have to come in here and cut this section out because they don't fit every revelation is an addition building upon the Word of God amen it's richer deeper meaning by far expresses perfect realization and contrast to partial realization now back in the Philadelphian age the coming of the Lord was drawing nigh but great love that age manifested for him it reminds me of those beautiful words of first Peter 1:8 whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory with them we rejoice also we haven't seen him but we have felt him and we know him now as much as our limiting senses can let us but one day it will be face to face oh no longer through the glass a man no longer disss we see you Lord through this glass darkly one day face to face that is for this a teach he is coming at the end of this age partial realization will be made perfect realization completed realization hallelujah we have been looking through a glass darkly but soon it will be face to face we have been going from glory to glory but soon it will be right in the glory and His glory and in his glory will shine we shall be like him wondrously like him Jesus our Savior divine hallelujah not gonna look in the mirror and be a different reflection not going to have the revelation of Jesus Christ come and find out we look nothing like him we will be him Oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that wonderful we are complete in him that is true he would not lie to us about that one day we were changed in the atoms will put on immortality we will be swallowed up in life then we will realize utilization what will that realization be we stand in his presence and realized that it was the Word of God not even loud Asiya not this age not our job not relationships not our finances none of that will have truly molded us it will be God and God alone molding us into his image Oh hallelujah now look bro a master craftsman uses many tools so he might be using your job he might be using your neighbor he might be using there's been a wife a mother a father children he might be using [Music] me but I'll tell you what you do you just keep praying Lord till you send us a better pastor make this one work come on Saints God will use what God wants to use he's sovereign he's sovereign hallelujah just sit back and say Lord Here I am I give myself to your Lord whatever you want to do mold me any way you please Lord I just want to be molded into your image I want your life to be my life I want everything that you are everything that you promise to be I want to be that then I claim that but we lift a hand today and say I claim that in the name of Jesus Christ I want to be Amen all that God called me to be Oh hallelujah hallelujah I was afraid I wouldn't have enough to preach about this morning my oh my I'll tell you let the revival come are you anchored down enough let the wind blow hell away I believe we are Saints let's let the wind blow let it blow every little bit of trash now look I'm not looking out thinking okay this person's doing this that one's know that don't know don't misunderstand me I'm not looking at none of that all I know is there's little isms and systems it's still reside in our lives and I'm just asking the Holy Ghost to come and blow through here and let it be washed out let everything worst out in another quote I didn't put it up but I probably should have brother Branham says you know let let those waves come let it beat that out of us so that's alright just as long as you let the Holy Ghost do the beating that's why I don't believe in coming out here how sister Nadia now Aurora no you won't get nothing beat out of nobody you just create resentment embarrassment shame this kind of when the Holy Ghost comes and says I want that out of your life I want you to sacrifice this I want you to serve me more give me more time we're gonna want you to pour out more energy I don't want this part of you I want all of you when the Holy Ghost does that a son or daughter of God suddenly says this Lord but if the preacher comes well he may as well just carry a stick reminds me of video I seen once for this man in church his phone went off now somebody else obviously had a phone because this is on film but the guy's phone goes off and I kind of dislike you know right like pastor finally comes down there sits can I see your phone the guys like pastor looks at it he says some words about disrespect or whatever throws on the floor he stomps it and a piece of right there on the floor of the church well he doesn't catch the guy back there but the phone filming him my brother and sister I'm sure that brother was just like honey that's absolutely the church I believe we should go to church no no but what if that pastor would have taught having a reverence in a respect not for this ceiling these walls this carpet these pews but for the God that this is his house see they they fail to teach a respect for the house of God they failed to teach a respect for the Word of God but they want the people to respond come on lord help us all amen just open our hearts and say Lord blow through here I don't care what has to get washed away just come Lord come right down here let a revival come into grace amen now the prophet of God says that a revival is not something new it's not calling the people off the street and doing this and that that's just a restoring or bringing you back to life what we already have amen and we know we know who we are we know what God's called us for Lord led there just the stuff that's distracting get washed away Oh hallelujah good to be in the house of Lord today amen it's been good to be here with you hallelujah hallelujah Oh hallelujah well I'd like to sing that song shine on me there's nothing better I'll tell you what sister Jerry's got that little dog he's so cute but he's getting uglier by the day amen his ears are starting to

climbed up on the kids little slide and the sun shining right on that it was warm there and I was like come on Teddy we gotta go to church buddy come on come on Teddy he's laying there in the Sun I love doing what are you talking about I'm in the perfect place right in the presence of the Sun oh I'll tell you what it's like rewrite my sermon oh my teddy says but Teddy's not foolish Teddy knows it's way better to be in the presence of the Sun than to be over here in the old cold shadows hallelujah god bless you I love you so much amen let's keep pressing things let's just press right into

Lord prophet of God says many places that the church the Bride of Christ he gave the Holy Ghost for the church says in other place he gave the holy to you as a gift amen so I think that must mean
