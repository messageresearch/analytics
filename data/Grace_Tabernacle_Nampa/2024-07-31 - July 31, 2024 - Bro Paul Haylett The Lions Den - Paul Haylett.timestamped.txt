[35:59] amen you know
[36:02] we here even within the message but
[36:05] within the the world today religious
[36:08] World such a call for
[36:11] Unity and they have all kinds of recipes
[36:14] and ideas how to bring
[36:17] Unity but there is one way truly to have
[36:20] unity and that's to be United with
[36:23] Christ when we have that Unity then the
[36:26] body of believers
[36:28] will have Unity amongst themselves good
[36:31] to see each and every one of you sister
[36:34] April was you able to spend time with
[36:36] your nephews I bet you're happy about
[36:38] that yes amen sister Sarah trust you're
[36:41] feeling better we've been praying for
[36:43] you amen let's just stand as we uh go
[36:48] into this service today uh we want to
[36:50] remember a few things brother Chris and
[36:52] I got sidetracked and it was my fault
[36:55] but uh we want to remember sister Sue
[36:58] uh I don't know if family still there or
[37:00] not but um I know that uh Dan
[37:04] cannot um the doctors want this blood
[37:07] clot to be gone before they before they
[37:10] deal with anything else and I always
[37:14] sometimes too late but I always think of
[37:15] brother Bob just remember him in prayer
[37:18] I believe our brother vasile would be
[37:20] out on the road somewhere and I know
[37:22] that brother Trevor and sister Carrie
[37:25] are down visiting pant the so we can uh
[37:29] remember all of them in one nice big
[37:32] blanket prayer right there cuz they're
[37:33] all together amen so I received a
[37:38] call um from Brother Davey rardon and
[37:43] he's just asking uh I think we were
[37:45] aware that sister Donna had a stroke and
[37:49] uh he's just was Desiring that we would
[37:52] remember uh continue to remember them in
[37:55] prayer sister Donna's rehab
[38:00] um he was a little vague but it doesn't
[38:02] sound like it's going very well and so
[38:05] we definitely want to remember them in
[38:07] prayer and those who are not here
[38:09] tonight I would like to once again speak
[38:13] uh kind of an overall title uh of
[38:16] scarecrows revealed in the scripture and
[38:18] I want to talk to you about the Lion's
[38:21] Den um one of the more ferocious
[38:24] scarecrows placed before a Believer uh
[38:28] and uh we'll just kind of look at that
[38:29] tonight for just a little while so we
[38:32] turn our Bibles to Daniel the 6th
[38:34] chapter vers 3 through five uh I I I
[38:38] love this what touched me about this is
[38:42] the the beauty of the
[38:46] description uh how they're expressing in
[38:50] the word even what the unbeliever
[38:53] thought of
[38:55] Daniel now it's probably doesn't totally
[38:57] cross our mind that often when we're out
[39:00] here living our life doing business or
[39:02] neighbors or whatever it is but uh we'll
[39:06] see that uh God allowed Daniel to even
[39:10] in the midst of his enemies because
[39:13] that's truly what they were they might
[39:15] have served in the king's court with him
[39:17] they might have been a neighbor as it
[39:20] were acquaintance as it were but they
[39:23] weren't brothers and unless you can come
[39:26] around the word of God it's not true
[39:29] Fellowship you know we can go and and we
[39:32] can talk about sports and we can talk
[39:35] about business and those are all well
[39:36] and good if you enjoy uh a little
[39:38] something but it really comes down to
[39:41] True Fellowship when it's around the
[39:43] word of God Amen and so I think we have
[39:46] to be careful when we say we had a
[39:47] fellowship but we talked about politics
[39:50] that's exactly right you know that's not
[39:52] Fellowship Fellowship is when Believers
[39:55] come together and the word word of God
[39:58] is shared amongst them now that doesn't
[40:01] mean every individual had to
[40:04] speak but your lives speak amen that's
[40:08] really our greatest testimony that our
[40:11] life is speaking so let's just dive into
[40:14] the scripture here Daniel 6 and3 then
[40:18] this Daniel was preferred above the
[40:20] president and
[40:22] princes because an excellent Spirit was
[40:25] in him
[40:27] Now isn't this interesting because it's
[40:30] not talking about all the other
[40:35] attributes it's just talking about he
[40:37] had an excellent Spirit you know that
[40:39] that transfers over to a
[40:42] Baptist a Nazarene a Methodist a Mormon
[40:46] your excellent
[40:48] Spirit affects them they recognize that
[40:52] I could share an example with you
[40:54] tonight but I I I will move on but I
[40:56] have a relationship with a an LDS
[40:59] neighbor of mine fellow farmer and when
[41:02] we have a
[41:04] conversation in the last while he he is
[41:08] very
[41:09] expressive this is going to make my weak
[41:13] now my brother and sister I'm not
[41:14] boasting of Paul because you know me too
[41:16] well for me to boast and get away with
[41:20] it but I'm my point being is they
[41:24] recognize there's something there that's
[41:28] right
[41:29] amen because an excellent Spirit was in
[41:32] him and the King thought to set him over
[41:34] the whole realm then the presidents and
[41:37] princes sought to find occasion against
[41:39] Daniel concerning the kingdom but they
[41:42] could find none occasion nor fault for
[41:46] as much as he was faithful neither was
[41:49] there any Heir or fault found in him
[41:53] then said these mens we shall not find
[41:55] any occasion against this Daniel except
[41:59] we find it against him concerning the
[42:02] law of his God Heavenly Father we just
[42:06] ask you Lord to come tonight these brief
[42:08] words anoint them Father let them be of
[42:11] use to your children father Lift us up
[42:14] father strengthen us give us courage to
[42:16] serve you in the name of Jesus Christ
[42:18] amen you may be seated
[42:20] Saints and you know as we look at this
[42:23] you know as as I started to study this
[42:26] and look through these scriptures I I
[42:28] found myself making this scripture very
[42:30] brief but I I believe it was just so
[42:33] full of authority and power right here
[42:36] very descriptive then I thought you know
[42:38] there's no use watering it down with too
[42:40] many details amen simply we can look at
[42:43] this word and realize that Daniel had an
[42:46] excellent spirit and we know that Daniel
[42:48] went through a lot in his life you know
[42:51] uh uh God tested him and tried him uh
[42:55] but in the time often that we think that
[42:57] it's testing and trying if we'll really
[43:00] stop and think about it God is proving
[43:03] to us he's present amen we say oh that
[43:07] was a great trial but in the end you're
[43:09] still standing you're still believing
[43:11] and it really in essence is God proving
[43:14] to you I'm right here with you amen you
[43:18] know brother Chris just mentioned it was
[43:20] a a little comment I didn't speak back
[43:23] to him in the back office but you know
[43:25] on the road to emus you know Jesus just
[43:27] appears and starts to walk with him and
[43:30] these guys unload on him when you think
[43:34] about that they unload on him about
[43:37] everything that was wrong with the
[43:38] message of the hour our messenger left
[43:41] us high and dry there must be more to
[43:44] this message but he didn't give it to us
[43:47] but in the end they realized that what
[43:49] he had given them was enough to carry On
[43:53] To The Next Step that was given to them
[43:56] amen I believe that's applicable to the
[43:58] day that we're living in I'm going to be
[44:00] a little straightforward if you don't
[44:02] mind tonight there's people that have
[44:04] not moved forward they're still stuck
[44:06] back years ago but God opened the word
[44:09] to you and I our messenger amen the
[44:13] prophet of our day did not leave us high
[44:15] and dry he left us very perfectly
[44:18] positioned to step into the next
[44:20] Revelation or opening of the word and
[44:23] and so it's not for him God did not send
[44:25] us a babysitter
[44:28] he sent us a
[44:29] prophet and the prophet spoke and taught
[44:32] and revealed the word of God to us and
[44:36] once you catch the vision of what is
[44:38] happening in your life and we can go
[44:40] back and do a lot of history on Daniel
[44:42] but I don't believe we need to we know
[44:45] and as we look at that when Daniel first
[44:48] we can't really or at least I don't feel
[44:50] like I can really say that was the
[44:52] moment that Daniel got it but my brother
[44:54] and sister through all that happened
[44:56] there come a time that Daniel knew all I
[44:58] need to do is trust God and when I trust
[45:01] him he'll take care of the rest of the
[45:02] business he's not going to leave me nor
[45:05] forsake me his word's not going to
[45:07] return void in my life it's not going to
[45:09] return void concerning Israel
[45:12] amen and so it's there this molding and
[45:16] this character that come and it led him
[45:19] to a place brought him to a place that
[45:22] he had an excellent spirit I know God's
[45:25] still working on me amen amen I'm sorry
[45:27] to admit that to you tonight but God's
[45:29] still working on me I don't always have
[45:32] an excellent spirit and I say well God
[45:34] if you could do this for Daniel you can
[45:37] do it for me amen if you can do it all
[45:41] down through scripture for those men
[45:43] Lord you are doing it for me amen and so
[45:47] because they without us cannot be made
[45:49] perfect so God's not going to allow us
[45:52] to come in with a rotten spirit amen
[45:55] when he required a good spirit out of
[45:57] them amen so you know found no fault now
[46:01] imagine that your harshest critics that
[46:03] would love to find a way to tear you
[46:06] down can't find any
[46:09] fault who's our harshest
[46:13] critic
[46:17] Satan and you realize at the end of the
[46:19] day the reason he doesn't like you so
[46:22] much is because when he sees what he
[46:25] sees is a flaw in you
[46:27] he realizes that under the blood of
[46:30] Jesus Christ it's
[46:33] perfect so what he's trying to do is
[46:36] draw Perfection out and say that
[46:39] Perfection is
[46:44] flawed and sometimes we cooperate so
[46:48] effectively with
[46:50] him but I want you to know that if the
[46:55] devil could draw it out from underneath
[46:57] the blood were
[46:59] toast but when it's under the blood the
[47:01] only thing that will draw that out is
[47:03] the memory or our thought process that
[47:06] we have and so sometimes we just simply
[47:09] do the devil's work for him and we draw
[47:11] out issues and bad memories and you know
[47:14] Etc I don't want to belabor that we draw
[47:17] them out and Ponder on them and Satan he
[47:20] really actually has no ability because
[47:22] it's covered by the blood until we hand
[47:24] him the opportunity that's right
[47:28] amen so you know it it's there uh they
[47:33] found no fault in Daniel which is
[47:35] incredible but my brother and sister
[47:37] look at the absolute parallel the
[47:39] prophet talks about it they found no
[47:41] fault in Jesus they stood right there
[47:44] and said we find no fault with this man
[47:47] but they still desired to destroy him
[47:51] and so we look at this these parallels
[47:53] in scripture we look at this how that
[47:56] Daniel now in his representation in the
[47:59] word they said he is faultless but we
[48:02] still desire to destroy him and
[48:04] certainly that's the day that we live in
[48:07] uh you know I think sometimes this is a
[48:09] Paul thought here sometimes I think we
[48:12] see the devil a as as this total roaring
[48:15] lion adversary uh you know that's always
[48:18] just you know got a little blood
[48:19] dripping off of his tooth and and he's
[48:21] just a horrible person but I I think
[48:24] really the truth of it is Satan is wise
[48:27] enough to know to a degree who is and
[48:31] who isn't and he looks at attributes he
[48:34] looks at actions as the prophet of God
[48:36] said you can see it in the
[48:40] life and he's smart enough to get a clue
[48:43] but it's out here in limboland if you
[48:46] don't mind me using that word that that
[48:48] Satan then really has this deal because
[48:51] there are people who are living kind of
[48:54] in kind of out kind of and Satan don't
[48:56] know exact where they stand he'd like to
[48:58] say they're out but he sees something
[49:01] there that it looks like they are in and
[49:04] so what he's going to do if they're out
[49:06] he just kind of lets them just live any
[49:08] old way they want let's just use the
[49:09] word rough tonight they live any old
[49:12] filthy way they want still claim to be a
[49:14] Christian but when he sees that person
[49:16] that has trouble and repents that scares
[49:20] Satan because when he sees a person fail
[49:22] and we say oh I failed in my flesh or
[49:25] this thought or that thought or this
[49:27] action or whatever but then he sees them
[49:29] come and put it under the blood Satan is
[49:31] there saying that's the one I need to
[49:33] destroy and so we see how Daniel coming
[49:37] uh into this position of no fault but
[49:39] you see I find it interesting this is a
[49:41] takeaway for me from this study but they
[49:44] show us my brother and sister that that
[49:47] they're not even really against
[49:51] Daniel they're actually against the man
[49:55] living the word and they identified as
[49:58] Daniel's God that's right that's what
[50:00] they're really against if Daniel had
[50:03] just lived just kind of a loose old life
[50:05] and and you know talked about God and
[50:08] and you know oh I pray too you know they
[50:10] wouldn't have a problem with Daniel but
[50:12] they saw God reflected in Daniel and
[50:15] they said the only way we we can tear
[50:18] him down is to pit our King who thinks
[50:20] he's a God against Daniel's God and
[50:23] we'll see what happens then and they get
[50:25] the kingdom make the decree we know the
[50:28] story amen so they're holding it against
[50:31] the man who is actually just living the
[50:33] word of God and this will be one of the
[50:36] key Saints when the crunch comes praise
[50:38] God we don't be here when the
[50:40] tribulation comes but when the crunch
[50:42] comes they're not going to hate you as a
[50:44] person amen it says that will'll be all
[50:46] these all these people against you but
[50:49] they won't hate you as a person they'll
[50:51] hate you for the life you
[50:53] live they'll like you as a neighbor
[50:56] they'll like you as a friend they'll be
[50:58] a good coworker they'll be all of this
[51:00] stuff but they'll hate you because
[51:02] you're living something they can't live
[51:05] and Satan will stir them up put a bee in
[51:07] their Bonnet because then they'll start
[51:09] to say well who do they think they are
[51:11] but my brother and sister if they could
[51:13] just catch a glimpse over the banister
[51:15] of heaven and realize that we're nothing
[51:18] but a little bit of dust and a little
[51:19] bit of this but the seeds in there and
[51:22] we didn't put the seed he put the seed
[51:25] he put it in the season he put it in the
[51:27] time he put it in the
[51:29] place and it's
[51:32] growing
[51:34] hallelujah
[51:37] amen they won't like the word of God
[51:40] manifested in
[51:42] you I've dealt with people in the last
[51:45] while that just get wound up when you
[51:47] start using the word
[51:49] manifested and the reason they get wound
[51:51] up I am convinced is because they're not
[51:53] seeing it
[51:55] manifested and they're upset because
[51:57] they can see it but they don't have
[52:00] it and so it's there this decree you
[52:03] worship any other it's going to be
[52:06] death quite a quite a strong decree
[52:10] really when you think about this it's
[52:12] basically just a death sentence issued
[52:15] on anyone who does not cower down to
[52:19] anyone who does not just give over or
[52:22] Surrender it's a death sentence to
[52:24] anyone with an alternate idea a of what
[52:27] a God
[52:33] is I thought it was interesting I
[52:35] watched a little clip the other day have
[52:37] to admit
[52:38] this I'm going to call her a lady I want
[52:40] to be
[52:41] polite this lady was a powerful
[52:45] speaker but it's another person
[52:49] displaying that
[52:52] preaching This Woman's got hair as short
[52:54] as mine preaching
[52:59] and he is critiquing her preaching and
[53:02] criticizing it totally missing that one
[53:06] she's got no hair on her
[53:08] head two she shouldn't be in the Pulpit
[53:11] at all and three she's preaching the
[53:15] Trinity miss all of these points and
[53:19] just criticize how she presents
[53:22] it my brother and sister the blind are
[53:25] leading the blind
[53:27] amen and so you see these these leaders
[53:30] they're like oh if we can get Daniel out
[53:33] of the way it will fix everything my
[53:35] brother and sister they didn't
[53:36] understand that it was Daniel being
[53:38] there is why the kingdom was blessed
[53:41] amen they they couldn't catch the idea
[53:44] that God was blessing a kingdom that had
[53:47] a Godly Man in the
[53:49] leadership and they won't catch it in
[53:51] this nation either
[53:54] amen now we see we know that a lot of
[53:58] Israel a lot of Daniel's Brethren are in
[54:01] the land with him they've also heard
[54:04] this
[54:05] decree but out of all of
[54:08] Israel how many are the
[54:13] examples that didn't buckle
[54:17] down just four
[54:21] people that is an effective scarecrow
[54:27] that is
[54:28] literally correct me but if I understand
[54:31] that it would have been I don't know
[54:34] help me Brother David how many Jews
[54:36] there would have been I don't know if
[54:37] there's a actual number numbered on that
[54:40] but just bear with me if I'm wrong
[54:42] forgive me but a few hundred
[54:46] thousand actually yes million it's
[54:48] really what but we'll just settle cuz
[54:50] millions are made up 100
[54:53] thousand but a few hundred th000 here
[54:56] the decree and there's four that
[54:59] actually can act upon the
[55:01] word so you know that that's not a
[55:04] that's not a percentage that you would
[55:06] be comfortable with amen but it does fit
[55:10] one out of a
[55:13] million does fit that scenario if you
[55:16] would put it that way so these Brethren
[55:18] of Daniel are in the land but yet we
[55:21] don't see um you know much happening
[55:24] from them and I can see as the decree
[55:26] goes forward they're saying what will we
[55:29] do what should we do uh we don't know
[55:32] what to do Rabbi uh leaders what do we
[55:36] do here's this decree and you know the
[55:40] prophet deals with this and I didn't
[55:41] Focus too much on it tonight CU I didn't
[55:43] want to get too distracted but my
[55:45] brother and sister they come to a place
[55:48] you'll either bow to this you'll either
[55:50] worship this way or we will kill you and
[55:55] real Christians now we understand
[55:57] they're Jews but you follow me real
[56:00] Christians and they got to stop and say
[56:02] what do we
[56:04] do that should not even be a question
[56:06] that comes out it should be we already
[56:11] know what to
[56:13] do nowhere now the prophet touches on
[56:17] this I don't want to get distracted
[56:19] we're not called to be secret
[56:21] Christians amen now we look down through
[56:23] the Dark Ages the anointing of the age
[56:25] and Poss possibly things could be in
[56:27] such a fashion in in in time but my
[56:30] brother and sister when it comes to the
[56:32] point I tell you what we failed as a
[56:34] Christian if they come looking for
[56:36] Christians and your neighbors don't
[56:38] point you
[56:39] out we missed
[56:41] something because our life even if you
[56:44] didn't testify them our life should set
[56:47] us apart and so here is Daniel and this
[56:51] decree goes forward now I'm telling you
[56:53] these thoughts crossed his mind he was
[56:55] human amen I can just leave the shutters
[56:58] closed on my room and kneel in my same
[57:01] spot and pray just like I always have
[57:04] but there was anointing come on Daniel
[57:06] and he's there saying I could be a
[57:08] secret Christian not change anything or
[57:11] I could be bold and and live my life out
[57:15] and if this is what God wants then
[57:17] that's what it will be and he opens the
[57:19] shutters and he kneels down to pray and
[57:22] the enemy is there watching every step
[57:24] you ever wonder why the devil tried to
[57:27] condemn you and such and put his finger
[57:29] on you such CU he is watching your every
[57:34] step because he wants you to
[57:36] see and the world to see
[57:40] fault failure shortcomings
[57:47] inconsistency now we're called to do our
[57:50] praying in secret
[57:52] right right we're not really called to
[57:54] be as the Pharisees and stand in the in
[57:58] the door of the church or the step of
[58:00] the church and oh Lord forgive all the
[58:04] rest of these message Believers that
[58:06] don't have a revelation like
[58:11] me or that's what it would have sounded
[58:13] like in that day
[58:14] Saints let's just bring it back down to
[58:16] our day let's not look into history amen
[58:20] you know the prophet preached about
[58:22] bring bringing God out of History amen
[58:25] so you can look at a historical God but
[58:27] the prophet said look at that historical
[58:29] God and then get desperate and bring him
[58:32] into the present don't leave him as
[58:35] history bring him into the present and
[58:38] let him fulfill the word today just like
[58:41] he did there amen so here it is Daniel
[58:46] he's there he does his praying could
[58:49] have done it in secret now we're not
[58:50] talking about uh making a show this was
[58:53] Daniel's routine his little room pointed
[58:56] amen the right direction everything was
[58:58] good and and so he wasn't trying to make
[59:02] a public display but they put themselves
[59:04] in a position maybe h a rooftop where
[59:07] they could look and see and to their
[59:10] greatest
[59:11] satisfaction realized that he had just
[59:14] broken the king's
[59:17] decree and isn't it interesting that God
[59:19] will allow a king to make a decree
[59:22] without totally thinking it through
[59:23] because he has anguish yeah he has
[59:27] anguish when he realizes he's now
[59:29] committed Daniel to a lion's den to
[59:33] death but God said you know what I want
[59:35] to show this King I want to show these
[59:38] people that I'm real and Daniel's my
[59:40] servant so everything's under control
[59:43] and you know I mean if you guys read you
[59:46] know very in depth to the scripture
[59:47] you'll see how that that Daniel packed
[59:50] up his bare necessities a little pack of
[59:52] food and tried to sneak out the back
[59:54] door and run away
[59:57] Oh wrong
[59:58] book yeah what Daniel do he did what God
[1:00:02] called him to do and when they come to
[1:00:04] get him he didn't jump out there with a
[1:00:06] hang grenade and a machete or whatever
[1:00:08] and try and fight his way out of this he
[1:00:11] didn't hire a
[1:00:13] lawyer they said you know you you've
[1:00:15] broken that and Daniel lets them know
[1:00:17] look I have a higher calling than even
[1:00:20] my king that I have served Faithfully my
[1:00:23] calling is greater than him oh that's
[1:00:28] blasphemy how dare you say that there's
[1:00:31] one greater than the king we've spent
[1:00:33] weeks and months propping him up none
[1:00:36] greater than you oh King none more
[1:00:40] powerful than you oh King until the king
[1:00:44] kind of was like yeah you know I'm I'm
[1:00:48] pretty important
[1:00:57] we could have just become secret
[1:01:04] Christians Lord help
[1:01:06] us if nobody knows we're a
[1:01:10] Christian we're secret
[1:01:13] Christians I know that's a little
[1:01:15] straightforward but that's my
[1:01:17] job right just put it straight forward
[1:01:20] let's put the stick in and let's stir
[1:01:22] things to our remembrance if our
[1:01:24] workplace
[1:01:26] our
[1:01:27] neighborhood even our family no one
[1:01:30] knows we're a Christian then we're a
[1:01:32] secret
[1:01:35] Christian and if we keep our belief
[1:01:39] hidden there's no repercussions that's
[1:01:43] right nobody calls you a Holy Roller
[1:01:46] nobody calls you a
[1:01:47] bromite Nobody calls you or says you're
[1:01:50] an
[1:01:52] occult I'm sorry I'm obsessed with the
[1:01:55] anti cult thing you know cuz uh we
[1:01:58] really failed on that the
[1:02:02] message maybe not every
[1:02:05] church but we really failed to press the
[1:02:08] mark of a
[1:02:11] cult but you know how easy it is just a
[1:02:15] stereotype it's almost in essence pardon
[1:02:19] me for saying it this way it's almost
[1:02:21] like a curse
[1:02:22] word well I'm sorry your word cult means
[1:02:25] nothing cuz can take the word of God and
[1:02:27] prove that you not speaking to you prove
[1:02:31] that you are in more of a cult than we
[1:02:34] are yeah
[1:02:38] Hallelujah well I mean wouldn't it be
[1:02:41] nice if you just lived any way you want
[1:02:43] and then you need a blessing you could
[1:02:45] just show up to church with enough money
[1:02:48] and be
[1:02:50] reinstated living your whole life any
[1:02:52] way you please all it takes is cash
[1:02:56] that's a
[1:02:57] cult that's a cult now look at this
[1:03:00] Daniel could have done
[1:03:02] this Daniel could have took the route
[1:03:05] right there went to the king and said
[1:03:06] yes I did it but I won't do it again and
[1:03:09] and just please let me find favor with
[1:03:12] you and we know that he would have been
[1:03:13] given favor amen there would have been a
[1:03:16] way that this would have come about but
[1:03:18] my brother and sister it was there that
[1:03:21] Daniel no doubt faced the thought that
[1:03:24] there should be a way I can work around
[1:03:26] this but what did Daniel do oh I want to
[1:03:28] be a Daniel wait my middle name is
[1:03:30] Daniel maybe I'm kind of getting close
[1:03:32] he went and he cast the shutters open
[1:03:36] and he knelled down and I don't think he
[1:03:38] got over there you know I was really
[1:03:40] proud I really proud of a little
[1:03:42] situation here the other day uh just to
[1:03:45] hear somebody in a restaurant praying to
[1:03:48] where people on tables or like turnings
[1:03:50] like and I thought that's
[1:03:53] awesome Lord just bless his food you've
[1:03:56] given us today Lord bless our souls give
[1:03:58] us strength and courage to serve you
[1:04:00] Lord we are here to do your bidding to
[1:04:03] do your work and we love you Lord and I
[1:04:06] was like go for it don't stop now keep
[1:04:09] going maybe somebody will realize how
[1:04:12] much they've left on the table somewhere
[1:04:14] and become a Secret
[1:04:16] Christian amen and no doubt Satan tried
[1:04:20] to place that in in Daniel's thoughts
[1:04:22] you know the little bird flying over
[1:04:24] trying to build the nest look Daniel
[1:04:26] come on you can you can make this all
[1:04:28] work and maybe over time it would change
[1:04:31] but Daniel as I said through the
[1:04:33] shutters open amen and so he had a call
[1:04:37] to worship we talk about gifts and
[1:04:39] callings right often times when we think
[1:04:41] about gifts and callings we're thinking
[1:04:43] about an office we're thinking about a
[1:04:45] position oh he's called to be a minister
[1:04:47] he's called to do this called to do that
[1:04:48] well I want to tell you we got a gift
[1:04:50] and we've got a calling to worship amen
[1:04:53] it's not just something we're going to
[1:04:55] some I'll do a little here and a little
[1:04:57] there the bride of Christ is called To
[1:04:59] Worship her husband to worship the
[1:05:01] bridegroom to give glory to God Amen
[1:05:04] because that's part of who we are that's
[1:05:07] part of the makeup of what we are just
[1:05:09] as a corn plant use them for an example
[1:05:12] is in the breeze amen today out out
[1:05:15] working and and there was a good Breeze
[1:05:17] come through and you know these leaves
[1:05:19] are just out there rustling and the
[1:05:21] closer you get to them the rustling
[1:05:24] sound sounds louder and louder it don't
[1:05:26] diminish they want you to know amen the
[1:05:29] spirit is
[1:05:30] moving and I'm here to
[1:05:32] worship I'm here to give praise to God
[1:05:35] and I don't care who sees me who hears
[1:05:38] me amen so his call was Way Beyond
[1:05:42] Theology and Way Beyond some teaching
[1:05:45] amen this came from his heart come on
[1:05:48] Saints we don't have to jump up and
[1:05:50] shout and scream some people say Well if
[1:05:52] you really believe it you got to be
[1:05:54] verbal well not everybody's got that
[1:05:56] kind of personality but I'll tell you if
[1:05:58] God knows our heart and I put the if
[1:06:00] there cuz you can deal with the if any
[1:06:02] way you want if God knows our heart that
[1:06:05] Saint sitting there in their heart
[1:06:07] saying Amen to that word it's rattling
[1:06:10] the windows and shaking the roof because
[1:06:12] God said I hear my son I hear my
[1:06:16] daughter but we get into a movement
[1:06:18] almost like the Pentecostals that's
[1:06:20] right that we've got to make the floor
[1:06:22] Rumble and bounce and shake and
[1:06:24] chandeliers got to be swinging because
[1:06:27] we're doing but my brother and sister if
[1:06:29] our Amen to the word is an empty amen
[1:06:32] the only thing it's doing is shaking the
[1:06:34] decimal meter it's not changing a life
[1:06:37] amen it's not changing how people are
[1:06:41] I'll tell you what they come and and he
[1:06:43] had Daniel now remember we're talking
[1:06:46] about Daniel and Daniel is a type that
[1:06:48] comes back and ties directly to us amen
[1:06:51] he had to
[1:06:53] worship there was nothing on I worship
[1:06:56] later I can catch it another day Daniel
[1:07:00] had to worship amen and he was going to
[1:07:03] worship even if he had to face the
[1:07:05] Judgment amen you know how well he would
[1:07:08] know the Judgment he would have no doubt
[1:07:10] been sitting there in the courts when
[1:07:13] the deceivers come to the king and you
[1:07:16] didn't see Daniel jump up and tell them
[1:07:18] King they're lying to you it's a trick
[1:07:20] do this do that whatever but he let the
[1:07:23] word of God and the will of God God be
[1:07:29] fulfilled how many times we'd really
[1:07:32] like to point out the
[1:07:34] air but maybe God wants you to pray
[1:07:38] that's
[1:07:46] it and he was willing to stand in the
[1:07:48] face of death no
[1:07:51] scarecrow was going to cause him to step
[1:07:54] away
[1:07:56] that's a pretty big
[1:07:57] scarecrow when you think about that amen
[1:08:01] because you see if the Scarecrow could
[1:08:04] get him to step away then he actually
[1:08:05] didn't really believe
[1:08:09] it you know Fox's book of
[1:08:14] Martyrs a story recounted of a man they
[1:08:17] come and said have you become a Secret
[1:08:21] believer and he said well not really a
[1:08:24] secret everyone in my household
[1:08:26] knows they took him down to burn him at
[1:08:29] the
[1:08:30] stake and uh they said look you're
[1:08:33] prominent I'm paraphrasing The Story
[1:08:36] You're prominent you're important you're
[1:08:38] well-respected
[1:08:40] just go
[1:08:42] back go home we're going to release you
[1:08:46] and let you think about it and he went
[1:08:49] home and the whole night
[1:08:52] through he repented and cried out to the
[1:08:55] Lord
[1:08:56] forgive me Lord got up in the morning at
[1:08:59] first light walked down to where they
[1:09:01] were burning Christians at the state and
[1:09:03] they said hey what are you doing here
[1:09:05] and he said I'm recanting my
[1:09:09] recanting that's probably not the right
[1:09:11] words
[1:09:12] but I'm recanting of a poor decision
[1:09:15] that I made don't you love the Lord amen
[1:09:19] it wasn't final you're lost but he went
[1:09:21] home and in bitter tears the Holy Spirit
[1:09:24] moving upon him in bitter tears and he
[1:09:27] knew this is not who I am I can't live
[1:09:30] life like this amen and he went down and
[1:09:33] then when they went to burn him at the
[1:09:35] steak they went to chain his arms and he
[1:09:37] said can I have just one request and
[1:09:40] they said what is it and he said don't
[1:09:41] chain my arms I won't try to escape and
[1:09:44] they stacked the wood around him and
[1:09:46] they lit him on fire and as he's there
[1:09:48] his hands come up and he's praising God
[1:09:51] as the Flames are devouring him and it
[1:09:54] haunted them that a man could be so
[1:09:57] devoted so committed that he could stand
[1:10:00] there and worship God and they were
[1:10:03] happy when the fire flames finally
[1:10:06] consumed his
[1:10:07] voice because it was condemning them and
[1:10:11] they never according to history never
[1:10:13] allowed another person to be tied to the
[1:10:16] Stak without tying their
[1:10:17] arms they couldn't deal with the fact
[1:10:20] that there would be people that would
[1:10:22] love God so much that even in death they
[1:10:25] would praise him oh my my brother my
[1:10:28] sister here's Daniel let's apply this to
[1:10:31] this if I could add it into the story
[1:10:34] The Scarecrow is saying you don't have
[1:10:36] to do this Daniel there's a way out for
[1:10:38] you and Daniel said there is no way out
[1:10:41] for me I will not recant I can't go away
[1:10:44] from what I believe I'm going to do this
[1:10:47] and it would cause him if he stepped
[1:10:50] away what testimony would Daniel have to
[1:10:54] Israel
[1:10:56] what testimony to a
[1:11:02] King you see it's
[1:11:05] interesting this comes out of several
[1:11:07] different sermons I didn't put quotes
[1:11:09] for them but you see what happens is we
[1:11:12] have to place it all on the scale and
[1:11:15] and we have to place it on the scale and
[1:11:16] that scale is
[1:11:18] life we enjoy life don't we I hope
[1:11:21] everyone here would be able to say we
[1:11:23] enjoy life amen
[1:11:26] and life is good life is grand we have
[1:11:28] those we love and things we like to do
[1:11:31] you know uh whatever it might be your
[1:11:34] hobby and and we say well I'm enjoying
[1:11:36] my life but what is that on the scale
[1:11:39] compared to eternal life
[1:11:41] amen and we have to take life and put it
[1:11:44] on that scale with eternal life and see
[1:11:47] which one of those weighs out and yet
[1:11:50] there's something in us that that uh uh
[1:11:53] just loves life
[1:11:55] when we get old we get elderly our
[1:11:58] afflictions come upon
[1:12:00] us we don't want to let go of
[1:12:03] life but we've seen afflictions come on
[1:12:06] people and they let go of eternal
[1:12:08] life they said if I'm ever going to live
[1:12:11] these are words that I know and I know
[1:12:13] who they come from if I'm ever going to
[1:12:15] come to a place I ever live really live
[1:12:17] life I better do it now and they just
[1:12:21] left so what did they do they put life
[1:12:24] on the scale and weighted it in such a
[1:12:26] fashion that it was more important than
[1:12:28] eternal life and here's Daniel he's now
[1:12:32] sitting there no doubt in his own
[1:12:34] apartment putting it life on the scale
[1:12:36] he's living in the king's Palace eating
[1:12:38] from the king's table and wearing King's
[1:12:41] reignment making decisions that change a
[1:12:44] nation and and change people my that's
[1:12:47] pretty far up the ladder is it not and
[1:12:49] it's there that he looks at this and
[1:12:51] says I put that on the scale and eternal
[1:12:54] life out weighs
[1:12:57] it
[1:12:58] incredible incredible I hope I'm not
[1:13:01] just ranting and raving too much
[1:13:04] here so it's there when natural life
[1:13:07] becomes the
[1:13:09] emphasis you'll find that people start
[1:13:11] to fear death yes
[1:13:15] sir when eternal
[1:13:18] life becomes the emphasis we realize as
[1:13:22] the prophet of God said it's just God
[1:13:25] harnessing death to take us into the
[1:13:28] presence of
[1:13:29] God but the more of natural life that we
[1:13:33] embrace the more we fear death that's
[1:13:36] right amen so why fear death it's been
[1:13:40] harnessed amen amen thank you Lord amen
[1:13:43] but what has Satan done he's turned
[1:13:45] death into a
[1:13:47] scarecrow you know back some time back
[1:13:52] uh brother Joe took me to meet a man you
[1:13:56] guys remember the lady the wife come to
[1:13:58] church for a while with us and um I
[1:14:02] remember the first time I went in the
[1:14:03] house he's laying on his bed in so much
[1:14:06] pain the morphine all those things and
[1:14:09] he just keep
[1:14:12] repeating what do I do what do I do I'm
[1:14:15] dying what do I do what do I do what do
[1:14:18] I
[1:14:20] do that day he was in so much pain his
[1:14:23] wife said I'm so sorry but I need to
[1:14:25] give him Mor morphine and when she did
[1:14:27] it was only a matter of a few minutes he
[1:14:29] passed out and went to sleep but God
[1:14:31] wasn't done with this gentleman amen got
[1:14:34] a phone call one day you know he's
[1:14:36] bright and alert and he's sitting here
[1:14:38] can you come jumped in the pickup drove
[1:14:40] there walked into the house he's sitting
[1:14:43] there and I I start to talk to him and
[1:14:46] he just looks at me and uh I was shocked
[1:14:49] he remembered my name maybe his wife had
[1:14:51] reminded me reminded him but he said
[1:14:53] what must I do and by God's grace I was
[1:14:55] able I don't really Embrace as it is the
[1:14:58] sinner's prayer a formula right but you
[1:15:01] got to have that introduction to Jesus
[1:15:03] Christ very clear because I've seen guys
[1:15:06] that repeated the sinner's prayer and
[1:15:08] remained a
[1:15:09] sinner amen so it's not like a you know
[1:15:12] a
[1:15:13] formula but he was there and he was
[1:15:16] sincere and he said okay Paul I'm
[1:15:18] trusting you I believe you what must I
[1:15:21] do I said you need to talk to the Lord
[1:15:23] he said you say the word and I'll repeat
[1:15:25] them and I said let me tell you God
[1:15:27] wants to hear them out of your mouth not
[1:15:29] out of my mouth God wants you to speak
[1:15:31] it needs to be from your heart and we
[1:15:33] got the privilege cuz he was just
[1:15:35] totally aware at that time we got the
[1:15:38] privilege of him repeating those words
[1:15:40] and you could see his eyes start to get
[1:15:43] bright and and it was something soaking
[1:15:46] into him and and we spent several hours
[1:15:50] there with him and then the pain got so
[1:15:52] great and the morphine and then it was
[1:15:54] over
[1:15:55] we got a call just I think three days
[1:15:57] later he's passed would you come now his
[1:16:01] wife because she didn't know any
[1:16:03] different she wanted us to pray over his
[1:16:06] body to pray any sins remaining
[1:16:11] sins from his body so that he could find
[1:16:15] Eternal
[1:16:17] rest we get to talking to her this is
[1:16:21] before we went to look at the body and
[1:16:23] she says you know
[1:16:25] I was skeptical but
[1:16:28] something changed and I was like what
[1:16:32] she says for the moment you prayed for
[1:16:35] him wasn't me right and he prayed prayer
[1:16:41] for God to forgive him he never ask
[1:16:46] again what is going to happen to
[1:16:49] him and she said as he took his last
[1:16:52] breath he had a smile on his face
[1:16:57] amen and she said now come in the
[1:17:00] bedroom and witness
[1:17:03] this there he is laying on the bed it's
[1:17:05] all tucked nice around
[1:17:07] him and he was just I can't even present
[1:17:11] that to you he's just laying there just
[1:17:14] the most peaceful Serene look on his
[1:17:16] face now I'm not here to tell you the
[1:17:18] guy automatically was a candidate went
[1:17:20] to heaven this that and the other but I
[1:17:21] will tell you from a man that was crying
[1:17:23] out what do I do what what's going to
[1:17:25] happen to me and grimacing and and just
[1:17:28] shuttering in pain and his own
[1:17:32] wife said he never did it again
[1:17:37] amen now let's ask
[1:17:40] him how you put it on the
[1:17:43] scale money wouldn't fix his problem
[1:17:46] amen a few more years of life wouldn't
[1:17:49] fix his
[1:17:50] problem only thing that would fix his
[1:17:53] problem was eternal life which is Christ
[1:17:56] amen so Natural Life had always been the
[1:17:59] emphasis this gentleman shared with me
[1:18:01] I've made so much money in my life he
[1:18:03] worked on on big construction sites all
[1:18:06] over the world he said I have made so
[1:18:09] much
[1:18:11] money never brought me
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:16] happiness so if natural life was the
[1:18:18] emphasis we wouldn't fear death amen and
[1:18:22] we would be happy
[1:18:25] yep Satan turned death into a scarecrow
[1:18:28] 1 Corinthians 15 I need to hurry right
[1:18:30] along here 1 Corinthians
[1:18:33] 1552 in a moment in the twinkling of an
[1:18:36] eye of the last Trump for the trumpet
[1:18:38] shall sound and we're not talking about
[1:18:40] Donald J amen and the dead shall be
[1:18:43] raised Incorruptible and we shall be
[1:18:45] changed for this corruptible must put on
[1:18:50] incorruption so it's got to be moved
[1:18:52] from one side of the scale to to the
[1:18:55] other side of the scale because it no
[1:18:57] longer is going to weigh into natural
[1:19:00] because natural was
[1:19:02] corruption and this Mortal must put on
[1:19:05] immortality so when this corruptible
[1:19:07] shall have put on incorruption and this
[1:19:09] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[1:19:11] then uh shall be brought to pass the
[1:19:14] thinging that is written death is
[1:19:15] swallowed up in Victory oh don't you
[1:19:20] love that Saints it makes me so happy so
[1:19:22] here's Daniel they have come they've
[1:19:25] actually placed him officially in bonds
[1:19:28] or whatever maybe they were respectful
[1:19:30] and didn't didn't put the bonds on him
[1:19:32] but they're taking him down there and
[1:19:34] he's going to a lion's den and my
[1:19:37] brother and sister it's documented you
[1:19:39] can find it in history that the human
[1:19:42] body very rarely touched the floor
[1:19:45] before it was completely destroyed these
[1:19:47] are hungry Lions these are angry Lions
[1:19:50] these are lions that have an attitude
[1:19:58] and what would the natural man do he
[1:20:01] would push and pull and jerk and drag
[1:20:03] and whatever he could I don't want to
[1:20:05] face that but Daniel got over there and
[1:20:09] he stood there my brother and sister
[1:20:10] because his faith was not in flesh his
[1:20:13] faith was in God Amen and he stood there
[1:20:16] and they put the stone back and they put
[1:20:19] him and they cast him down there you
[1:20:20] realize why they're casting him down
[1:20:22] they're not actually casting him down as
[1:20:24] a judgment you know to to smash him on
[1:20:26] the floor they're casting him down cuz
[1:20:28] those lions were capable of Leaping out
[1:20:31] of that cage so they pull the stone back
[1:20:34] they throw them in they put the stone
[1:20:36] back because the last thing we want is a
[1:20:38] lion in their lap amen so it's there
[1:20:42] that you see that and and it's there
[1:20:45] that anyway I'm getting
[1:20:49] sidetracked he says right there we're
[1:20:51] going to put on death swallowed up in
[1:20:52] Victory oh death where is is thy Sting
[1:20:56] the flesh man is afraid of death it's
[1:21:00] got a
[1:21:03] sting oh my oh grave where is thy
[1:21:07] Victory The Sting of death is sin and
[1:21:08] the strength of sin is the law but
[1:21:11] thanks be to God can we say thank you
[1:21:13] Lord but thanks be to God which giveth
[1:21:16] us the victory through our Lord Jesus
[1:21:18] Christ amen we got victory tonight
[1:21:21] because the word says we have Victory
[1:21:23] and in our Soul we know have Victory
[1:21:26] just don't look at your flesh look at
[1:21:28] the word amen your flesh is coming
[1:21:31] along amen do you know they threw
[1:21:34] Daniel's soul in the Lion's Den his
[1:21:37] flesh had to go along that's right amen
[1:21:40] no choice but there was a testing there
[1:21:43] was a time that I wonder my brother and
[1:21:46] sister cuz I don't want to be too
[1:21:48] liberal in interpretation but I just
[1:21:50] wonder if Daniel when he went down in
[1:21:53] that Lion's Den if he was there I have
[1:21:56] an inkling of something that down in his
[1:21:58] soul God had already placed it that I'm
[1:22:00] going to come out of this this Lion's
[1:22:02] Dan I'm going to be delivered from this
[1:22:04] trial and maybe it'd be like Shadrach
[1:22:07] Meshach Abed and go if you don't deliver
[1:22:09] me Lord it's still good hallelujah it's
[1:22:13] still a
[1:22:15] victory
[1:22:16] amen oh Hallelujah I like verse 58
[1:22:20] therefore my beloved Brethren be
[1:22:22] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[1:22:25] the work of the Lord for as much as you
[1:22:27] know that your labor is not in vain in
[1:22:30] the Lord Bo have you guys ever felt that
[1:22:33] way before seems like just trying to
[1:22:35] live the word and live life and do your
[1:22:37] best and it just seems like it just
[1:22:40] is I don't even know have the
[1:22:43] words I hate to use the words in vain
[1:22:47] but just feel like we're
[1:22:50] just on
[1:22:52] the treadmill
[1:22:55] yeah Monday Tuesday looked like Monday
[1:22:59] Wednesday looked like Monday and Tuesday
[1:23:02] Thursday look like and yeah
[1:23:06] yeah and come to church for a little
[1:23:12] relief well mostly because we didn't let
[1:23:14] it
[1:23:15] go we held on to
[1:23:18] Monday we're on Wednesday still holding
[1:23:20] on to
[1:23:21] Monday yeah and we might well be Sunday
[1:23:24] still holding on to Monday Tuesday
[1:23:25] Wednesday Thursday Friday amen now I
[1:23:29] don't know if I put the quote up here um
[1:23:32] I I I guess I didn't out of
[1:23:35] expectation uh in the message
[1:23:37] expectation May the shortest quote I've
[1:23:39] probably ever read in church Daniel was
[1:23:42] expecting God to deliver him from the
[1:23:44] Lion's
[1:23:46] Den come on don't give up amen having
[1:23:50] expectations amen this in the sermon
[1:23:53] expectation and amen have an
[1:23:55] expectation God's going to deliver me
[1:23:58] out of my present circumstance now
[1:24:00] sometimes it's not maybe there's a
[1:24:02] healing a need in your body a desire you
[1:24:04] have on your heart something of that
[1:24:06] nature and and you have that expectation
[1:24:09] don't let the expectation go away I
[1:24:12] expect it I believe God's going to do it
[1:24:16] I'm going to say that he's done it I'm
[1:24:18] going to believe it with all of my heart
[1:24:20] mind body and soul amen amen Prophets
[1:24:24] saying that Daniel expecting God to
[1:24:26] deliver him from the Lion's Den I want
[1:24:28] to know what's our expectation amen you
[1:24:31] know are are we assuming we'd become
[1:24:33] part of that pile of bones that when the
[1:24:36] Lions got really hungry they'd lay down
[1:24:38] in the corner and we've all seen a cat
[1:24:40] do it they can prop a I've watched lions
[1:24:42] in Africa do this they'll prop a big old
[1:24:45] bone up with both Paws and sit there and
[1:24:47] just chew on that
[1:24:49] thing yeah I'm going to be one of the
[1:24:52] nicer bones
[1:24:54] let them Lions chew on I've lived a
[1:24:57] better life a little better Nutrition a
[1:24:59] little this those lions are going to
[1:25:01] appreciate
[1:25:02] it no they
[1:25:05] won't what's our expectation Saints
[1:25:08] that's it fiery trials anybody had a
[1:25:11] fiery trial absolutely amen anybody had
[1:25:13] a fiery trial
[1:25:14] today amen let's get this down to
[1:25:17] present tense here fiery trials we're
[1:25:19] unmovable in Christ amen we have
[1:25:22] sickness we're unmovable in Christ
[1:25:24] amen we're in the spirits influence of
[1:25:27] the spirits of a wicked age we are
[1:25:29] unmovable in Christ amen and you know
[1:25:33] part of what this comes down we got no
[1:25:35] place to run amen where you going to run
[1:25:38] our families come out of denominations
[1:25:40] our families come out of this world Amen
[1:25:43] our families come from all of this stuff
[1:25:45] where are we going to run we got nowhere
[1:25:48] to run you might say in essence our back
[1:25:50] is against the wall but we don't need a
[1:25:53] wall to stop us cuz we're not going
[1:25:55] backwards anyway amen we're going to
[1:25:57] walk and we're going to keep going amen
[1:26:01] amen we don't fight in the flesh the
[1:26:03] battle is the Lord's amen 1 Samuel amen
[1:26:08] 17:47 and all this assembly shall know
[1:26:11] that the Lord saveth not with a sword
[1:26:13] and spear for the battle is the Lord's
[1:26:16] and he will give you amen into our hands
[1:26:21] speaking to Satan Hallelujah well not
[1:26:24] exactly Satan at that time but it was
[1:26:27] Satan amen Deuteronomy 20 and4 for the
[1:26:32] Lord your God is he that goeth with you
[1:26:36] to fight for you against your enemies to
[1:26:40] save you amen this is the kind of God
[1:26:43] we're looking at this is the god that
[1:26:45] Daniel is going to all Lion's Den with
[1:26:48] the revelation of life in him amen and
[1:26:53] he wasn't there to fight them there's no
[1:26:55] need to fight them my brother and
[1:26:57] sister you don't even have to put the
[1:26:59] chains on me right
[1:27:02] yeah in the
[1:27:05] Paradox brother Bram said
[1:27:07] this and any man that believes God and
[1:27:10] takes him at his word no matter what the
[1:27:13] situation is God will perform another
[1:27:16] Paradox to keep his word for Abraham
[1:27:19] called the place Jehovah Gyra the Lord
[1:27:22] has provided for him himself a sacrifice
[1:27:26] and he still can cause a paradox to
[1:27:30] happen he can do that this afternoon if
[1:27:34] you'll just take him at his word Daniel
[1:27:37] from a den full of hungry Lions how
[1:27:41] could it be that that man how could it
[1:27:44] be that that man on a group of hungry
[1:27:47] Lions stayed in a cave with them all
[1:27:50] night long without any harm amen look at
[1:27:54] this in a cave with hungry
[1:27:59] Lions just drop back into the natural
[1:28:04] life in
[1:28:07] Africa the Lions when they're
[1:28:11] hungry you know
[1:28:14] it in the
[1:28:16] nighttime hungry
[1:28:19] Lions let it be
[1:28:21] known and it can be actually a little
[1:28:23] scary here inside a nice fence it's got
[1:28:25] electricity and all this stuff to detour
[1:28:28] Lions but that don't stop the lion we
[1:28:31] got to witness some of this it don't
[1:28:33] stop the lion from coming and walking
[1:28:35] that close to the
[1:28:38] fence and
[1:28:43] roaring Satan as a roaring lion 20 miles
[1:28:52] away Satan
[1:28:55] right
[1:28:57] here walking down the fence and stopping
[1:29:02] every once in a while and taking a big
[1:29:04] old paw and raking it down the
[1:29:10] wire and
[1:29:14] roaring and you realize you're staying
[1:29:16] in a little cabin thing with single
[1:29:18] Paine windows and
[1:29:21] um yeah
[1:29:24] if the line gets in
[1:29:26] here
[1:29:28] H
[1:29:30] yeah we were in sou South Africa Krueger
[1:29:34] National Park and somebody forgot to
[1:29:36] close a service gate to the compound and
[1:29:39] in the middle of the night somebody that
[1:29:41] was a camper got up to go use the
[1:29:43] restroom and encountered a lion walking
[1:29:47] through the middle of the camping
[1:29:50] area and I believe they search that
[1:29:54] place in Forin couldn't find a lion and
[1:29:57] I believe they could reason they
[1:29:58] couldn't is because when this person met
[1:30:00] the lion 20 ft away face to face they
[1:30:02] screamed so loud the lion probably
[1:30:05] thought what is this and
[1:30:09] ran but my brother and sister the person
[1:30:11] who saw the line nobody else saw the
[1:30:13] line but this this
[1:30:15] lady but there was Footprints they knew
[1:30:18] that she was telling the
[1:30:19] truth that lady had a whole different
[1:30:23] story than everyone else in that camp
[1:30:26] she had met the lion face to
[1:30:29] face and her scream was a scream that
[1:30:32] she thought I'm
[1:30:35] lunch
[1:30:37] yeah you
[1:30:38] see we're living we're living in a Time
[1:30:46] Saints any man that believes God takes
[1:30:49] him at his word no matter what the
[1:30:50] situation is God will perform another
[1:30:53] paradox to keep his word for Abraham
[1:30:56] called the place Jehovah Gyra the Lord
[1:30:59] has provided for himself a sacrifice he
[1:31:01] can still cause a paradox to happen you
[1:31:05] know lot of times if we haven't got kept
[1:31:07] our faith up we'll think we're the
[1:31:10] sacrifice right not him the sacrifice we
[1:31:14] why did God put me here well maybe you
[1:31:17] put yourself there God wants you to
[1:31:20] trust him to get you
[1:31:21] out he can do that this afternoon if
[1:31:24] you'll just take him at his word Daniel
[1:31:26] from a den full of hungry Lions how
[1:31:28] could it be that that man how could it
[1:31:30] be that that that man uh on a group of
[1:31:33] hungry Lions stayed in a cave with him
[1:31:35] all night without any harm the angel of
[1:31:39] the Lord that's it unseen to anyone else
[1:31:43] was standing there it was a paradox
[1:31:45] something had to keep that lion from
[1:31:48] getting to him now I want to tell you my
[1:31:51] brother and sister we live right here in
[1:31:53] a paradox revealed we're living in a
[1:31:57] well America it doesn't have to be
[1:31:58] America but we're in America Amen in the
[1:32:02] 21st century when the word of God and a
[1:32:06] prophet said this is the absolute
[1:32:08] darkest age of all history we have a
[1:32:11] time period in time that says this is
[1:32:13] the Dark Ages but my brother and sister
[1:32:15] the prophet said this is the darkest
[1:32:18] time and it will be right here in this
[1:32:22] evening time that the light is going to
[1:32:25] come back and it has amen we have that
[1:32:28] light amen we got 20 21st century Lion's
[1:32:32] Den is what we got you realize because
[1:32:35] the only thing that's keeping us from
[1:32:36] being
[1:32:38] destroyed is Angel of the Lord is right
[1:32:41] here keeping us I'll tell you what no
[1:32:44] scarecrow is going to keep this bride of
[1:32:46] Christ from fulfilling the word amen all
[1:32:49] of this oh my brother and sister I don't
[1:32:54] make light of this but I believe it's
[1:32:55] kind of telling you know that that
[1:32:58] you'll meet certain Believers and I give
[1:33:01] them the benefit that out they believe
[1:33:02] but there's some things I think they
[1:33:04] need to
[1:33:04] overcome and and they they're storing up
[1:33:07] guns and they're storing up ammunition
[1:33:09] they're storing up food they're storing
[1:33:10] up gasoline they're storing up all of
[1:33:12] this and my brother and sister that's
[1:33:15] not what we're supposed to be storing
[1:33:17] up what we're supposed to be storing up
[1:33:20] amen is the word that's it because
[1:33:25] nothing saved Daniel but God
[1:33:31] Amen I can see God saying go down there
[1:33:35] guard him amen and even
[1:33:38] nature those Lions they
[1:33:41] knew they knew what that angel
[1:33:45] was okay let me just finished here right
[1:33:49] here seven Church age uh smon Church age
[1:33:53] in the Ephesian age and in this age and
[1:33:58] in every Age We contemplate we will see
[1:34:00] that this is true in the last age which
[1:34:03] is our age we will find the blackout of
[1:34:06] the word the complete apostasy ending in
[1:34:10] the Great
[1:34:11] Tribulation if you are true seed see
[1:34:14] that's why I feel qualified to use the
[1:34:16] word if because brother brand just ties
[1:34:18] it right in here if you are true seed if
[1:34:22] you are truly baptized with the Holy
[1:34:24] Ghost you will esteem his word above
[1:34:27] your necessary meat amen no need for us
[1:34:31] to skip church to make another dollar
[1:34:34] now let's balance this there
[1:34:37] circumstances right you have a job and
[1:34:40] sometimes that's just the way it is but
[1:34:42] to to
[1:34:44] choose that's right if you're true seed
[1:34:48] truly baptized Holy Ghost you'll esteem
[1:34:49] his word above your necessary meat
[1:34:51] you'll learn you'll yearn to live by
[1:34:54] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:34:56] mouth of God this is my Earnest prayer
[1:34:58] for all of us may we hear what the
[1:35:01] spirit is bringing from the word for us
[1:35:05] today amen this is not an old message my
[1:35:08] brother and sister I you know sorry to
[1:35:11] be too transparent here but you know
[1:35:15] when you have somebody that that is a
[1:35:17] Critic of the message and their
[1:35:20] criticism is it's just the same old
[1:35:26] thing and I thought are they talking
[1:35:28] about the message or the
[1:35:30] Bible cuz it's just the same old
[1:35:35] thing unless you have a
[1:35:38] new well anyway I won't go
[1:35:42] there it's the same old
[1:35:44] thing and if it was so old and wore
[1:35:48] out it sure works
[1:35:52] good my I mean maybe it comes down to
[1:35:56] they just don't make them like they used
[1:35:57] to you know this word Works amen when
[1:36:02] Daniel was throwed in the Lion's Den he
[1:36:05] was a human he didn't come down there on
[1:36:08] that floor and be like lions
[1:36:12] beware he was there Lord I trust
[1:36:16] you I trust you Lord I love you Lord I
[1:36:20] trust you if this is what you want this
[1:36:23] is right then and I commit my life to
[1:36:25] this and I personally believe that when
[1:36:29] Daniel
[1:36:30] landed in the bottom of that lon's
[1:36:33] Den those lines
[1:36:36] went help
[1:36:38] us help us there's this little guy over
[1:36:42] here by the wall and there's a big guy
[1:36:44] with a flaming
[1:36:46] sword and uh this doesn't look good for
[1:36:50] us so I tell you what this goes back in
[1:36:53] little story in my life I won't share
[1:36:54] tonight but sometimes when you think
[1:36:56] there might be a consequence you don't
[1:36:58] want to sleep you just kind of go over
[1:37:00] in the corner you pull your blankie up
[1:37:02] over your eyes and you just go to sleep
[1:37:05] I've rode with a few people in the car
[1:37:07] in the winter time and I that's exactly
[1:37:09] what I did I curled up in the backseat
[1:37:12] of their car pulled a blankie over my
[1:37:14] head and it's like Lord if I could just
[1:37:17] please survive this now reverse that
[1:37:20] Saints the lions are saying who is this
[1:37:24] we are
[1:37:26] afraid and Daniel was down there dancing
[1:37:29] before the Lions but he wasn't mocking
[1:37:32] the Lions he was praising
[1:37:36] Goden let's not put a worldly
[1:37:38] interpretation of dancing right no
[1:37:42] Jitterbug he's down there praising
[1:37:45] God Amen because he realized God had a
[1:37:49] plan amen sister Ruth I hope I didn't
[1:37:53] bore you guys this
[1:37:54] evening just something that was on my
[1:37:56] heart you know sometimes you just got to
[1:37:58] share those little things to look at
[1:38:01] this you know totally
[1:38:04] Supernatural but at the time it was
[1:38:06] taking place it so totally looked like a
[1:38:11] disaster but it was God Amen right in
[1:38:14] the middle of the chaos saying go ahead
[1:38:17] Daniel don't resist him don't fight him
[1:38:22] just walk out there jump down in that
[1:38:25] Lion's Den I've either got eternity
[1:38:28] there waiting for you that's it that's
[1:38:31] it but it's still
[1:38:34] me and when they drew Daniel out of that
[1:38:37] Lion's
[1:38:38] Den there was a king up there that had
[1:38:41] already cried out to him Daniel do you
[1:38:44] live y are you alive
[1:38:49] Daniel I tell you
[1:38:51] what all of those that had deceived the
[1:38:55] king I hope you can through the lines
[1:38:57] here all of those that had deceived the
[1:39:00] king they were the ones that started to
[1:39:03] fear that's Hallelujah and I'm telling
[1:39:06] you the devil today might pull fast one
[1:39:08] over you and I or someone else but at
[1:39:11] the end of the day that he sees this
[1:39:13] bride coming closer and closer to her
[1:39:17] bridegroom Satan's like hm I thought I
[1:39:20] could beat this and that's why he goes
[1:39:23] and praise God the bride's not going to
[1:39:25] be here no but he doesn't stop cuz he
[1:39:29] still thinks if he can go down here Gog
[1:39:32] and Magog and all of these things and
[1:39:35] all these demons that he's trying to put
[1:39:38] out and all that he's stirring
[1:39:42] up you don't think those Spirits aren't
[1:39:44] at the surface it's just a history
[1:39:46] lesson if you don't mind for two seconds
[1:39:48] you don't think those Spirits are not at
[1:39:50] the surface tell me why you would laun a
[1:39:54] missile into a place where there's women
[1:39:56] and
[1:39:57] children that's nothing but the
[1:40:00] devil absolutely the devil with an
[1:40:03] outlet to express his
[1:40:08] hate and even in the natural here he
[1:40:11] gets punished for it the man who sent
[1:40:14] the
[1:40:15] missile received a
[1:40:18] Missle eye for an eye and tooth for a
[1:40:21] tooth I'm glad that the bride doesn't
[1:40:23] live under that amen otherwise every
[1:40:26] little person that ever did something
[1:40:28] that that hurt us we'd be out there
[1:40:31] trying to hurt them but this is why the
[1:40:34] word has come and
[1:40:36] Daniel you notice in the
[1:40:38] word Daniel didn't send a single one of
[1:40:42] those men to the lion
[1:40:44] stand I believe probably Daniel was
[1:40:47] advocating Mercy for
[1:40:50] them but the King was like nope what
[1:40:53] they
[1:40:53] desired to do to you is what will be
[1:40:56] done to them let's stand amen
[1:41:03] hallelujah praise the
[1:41:06] Lord amen number eight brother Ivan I
[1:41:09] know it was the blood
[1:41:13] amen

[1:41:17] smaller if we just sang Everything in
[1:41:20] F I know it was the
[1:41:24] blood I know it was the blood I know it
[1:41:29] was the blood for
