[24:39] i use a macbook and i use a slide
[24:42] presentation
[24:43] called

[24:57] my apologies i'm gonna use that one

[25:03] praise the lord
[25:06] let's turn in our bibles to first
[25:08] corinthians chapter 15.
[25:20] first corinthians chapter 15.
[25:36] pretty more
[25:46] we'll just read it and get the slide
[25:48] going here first corinthians chapter 15
[25:50] verse 50.
[25:53] now this i say brethren that flesh and
[25:55] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god
[25:59] neither does corruption inherit
[26:01] incorruption
[26:03] behold i show you a mystery
[26:06] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[26:08] be changed in a moment
[26:10] in the twinkling of an eye
[26:13] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[26:15] sound and the dead shall be raised
[26:17] incorruptable and we shall be changed
[26:20] for this corruptable
[26:22] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[26:25] must put on immortality
[26:28] so when this corruptable shall have put
[26:30] on incorruption and this mortal shall
[26:32] have put on immortality
[26:34] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[26:36] that is written death is swallowed up in
[26:38] victory amen
[26:40] o death where is thy sting o grave where
[26:43] is thy victory this thing of death is
[26:45] sin and the strength of sin is the law
[26:48] but thanks be to god which giveth us the
[26:50] victory through our lord jesus christ
[26:52] therefore my beloved brethren be your
[26:54] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[26:57] the work of the lord for as much as you
[26:59] know that your labor is not in vain
[27:03] in the lord
[27:04] let's bow our heads tonight
[27:09] heavenly father lord jesus
[27:11] we're so thankful to be in your house
[27:13] tonight
[27:14] lord there's people who are
[27:17] at home watching tv
[27:19] doing other things lord
[27:21] but you called us to be your children
[27:23] and we are so thankful
[27:25] they can point and say we're bound by
[27:27] rules but father we are the most free
[27:29] people on the face of the earth because
[27:31] lord we have liberty in jesus christ
[27:33] father they're bound in sin they do what
[27:35] sin demands but father we do what you
[27:38] request of love lord jesus that's a
[27:40] relationship from our hearts father as
[27:43] well there are some of our brothers and
[27:44] sisters on the other parts of the world
[27:46] denied this privilege lord but here we
[27:48] still have it
[27:49] father we thank you for that lord and
[27:51] father we reach the holy spirit out to
[27:53] them lord that are gathered in hiding
[27:55] lord jesus in different parts of the
[27:57] world tonight lord or or they were last
[28:00] night depending on how far ahead they
[28:01] are lord may your holy spirit just guide
[28:04] them and lead them lord we commit them
[28:06] into your hands lord jesus we love you
[28:08] father we ask that you speak to our
[28:09] hearts tonight lord move aside the
[28:11] hindrances lord jesus and may you just
[28:13] calm down and speak to our hearts we're
[28:15] looking forward to hearing from you this
[28:17] evening in jesus christ's name we pray
[28:19] amen
[28:22] amen you may be seated
[28:24] i mean lord add a blessing to the
[28:25] reading of his word
[28:27] um i could use a screen can i get a
[28:29] couple batteries
[28:30] aaa for the remote i should have checked
[28:32] it
[28:33] praise the lord so my uh
[28:38] screen doesn't want to touch either my
[28:39] title tonight is death swallowed up
[28:43] my subtitle is liberty in the 10th and
[28:45] why don't we turn the second corinthians
[28:47] chapter 3.
[28:50] so we take our text from that scripture
[28:52] we just read there first corinthians 15
[28:54] 54 death is swallowed up in victory
[28:58] second corinthians chapter three
[29:02] thank you
[29:04] second corinthians chapter three verse
[29:05] 14.
[29:07] but their minds were blinded
[29:10] i'll let you get there real quick
[29:14] but their minds were blinded for until
[29:15] this day remaineth the same veil
[29:20] on taken away in the reading of the old
[29:21] testament which veil is done away in
[29:24] christ but even unto this day when moses
[29:27] is read the veil is upon their heart
[29:30] nevertheless now remember jesus christ
[29:31] is the same yesterday today and forever
[29:33] so it says moses here but that applies
[29:36] amen even in our day
[29:38] to the message because there's people
[29:39] who read the message and they come up
[29:41] with something different than what is
[29:42] the truth even though they're reading
[29:44] the same thing because there's a veil
[29:45] upon their heart verse 16 nevertheless
[29:48] when it shall turn
[29:49] to the lord it your heart
[29:52] shall turn to the lord the veil shall be
[29:54] taken away
[29:55] now the lord is that spirit and where
[29:57] the spirit of the lord is there is
[29:59] liberty
[30:01] praise the lord so death is swallowed up
[30:05] in victory
[30:06] oh death where is thy sting o grave
[30:09] where is thy victory
[30:12] there we go the next slide there death
[30:14] is swallowed up in victory
[30:17] o death where is i sting o grave where
[30:19] is thy victory
[30:22] we read in second corinthians chapter 3
[30:24] the veil that is done away with
[30:27] in christ
[30:28] so typing the
[30:30] make sure
[30:39] maybe not tonight
[30:47] just gonna have to do it for me
[30:49] won't touch either
[30:52] praise the lord
[30:55] the devil's just fighting it
[30:56] but we're just gonna roll with it
[30:59] and
[31:00] brother peterson says just ride the wave
[31:03] praise the lord so the veil is done away
[31:05] in christ
[31:07] and when moses is read the veil is upon
[31:09] their heart
[31:11] nevertheless
[31:13] can you do the slides for me
[31:15] nevertheless when it shall
[31:18] when it the heart shall turn to the lord
[31:22] the veil shall be taken away next slide
[31:25] where the spirit of the lord is there is
[31:28] liberty
[31:29] amen praise the lord so tonight we just
[31:32] ask the lord to speak to us and we just
[31:34] want to get out of the way for him amen
[31:36] so in the tabernacle in the word
[31:37] wilderness we have uh we read in exodus
[31:40] 39 verse 26
[31:42] talking about how aaron had to be
[31:44] prepared to go into the tabernacle into
[31:46] the holiest of holies the high priest
[31:49] once a year he had to he had to dress a
[31:51] certain way and the scripture says a
[31:53] bell and a pomegranate a bell and a
[31:55] pomegranate round about the hymn of the
[31:57] robe to minister in as the lord
[32:00] commanded moses
[32:02] so he had to be dressed right
[32:04] and it next slide
[32:07] it was a bell pomegranate all the way
[32:09] around his his robe he had to be dressed
[32:12] right and he had to be walking right
[32:14] those two things combined amen
[32:18] were pleasing to christ it was a ma it
[32:21] was it could be tied to modest apparel
[32:24] amen saints uh men and women alike
[32:27] dressing modestly for god amen clothed
[32:30] in righteousness and then they step into
[32:32] the spiritual part where we become
[32:34] clothed in his righteousness our
[32:36] righteousness is but filthy rags amen
[32:38] our the clothing that we were born in
[32:41] this flesh is a filthy rag but god come
[32:44] down amen and has clothed us in the
[32:47] clothed
[32:48] us in the word a man so word clothing
[32:52] praise the lord
[32:54] so it was physical death if aaron
[32:57] to aaron if he didn't do it right you
[32:59] can go to the next slide so without the
[33:02] word cutting the word out in other words
[33:04] the word said what
[33:06] bell and a pomegranate bellow and a
[33:08] pomegranate and he'd had a walk and he
[33:09] had to sing and he had to do it just
[33:11] right and there was a rope tied to his
[33:13] foot if he didn't do it right and he was
[33:15] struck dead they would drag him out so
[33:17] without without the word him and it's
[33:19] spiritual death to not clothe yourself
[33:22] self in the word and walk according to
[33:25] the sounding of the word and that's next
[33:29] slide i can't
[33:33] it's gotta work okay
[33:36] so death amen eternal separation or no
[33:39] fellowship with god so it's spiritual
[33:42] death to not clothe yourself in the word
[33:45] amen dressed dressed right and walking
[33:48] right go hand in hand because if you're
[33:50] dressed in the word of god you'll walk
[33:53] in the word of god amen you can't be
[33:55] dressed in the clothes of the world amen
[33:57] or you're not going to walk according to
[34:00] the word of god and then but when you
[34:01] dress right and when you take god's word
[34:04] i don't get ahead of myself here we take
[34:06] god's word by faith
[34:08] aaron had to have faith that if he did
[34:10] it according to the word of god he would
[34:12] what overcome death amen we're going to
[34:15] get down to that i mean our title
[34:17] tonight it's death swallowed up amen so
[34:20] aaron
[34:21] applied the word
[34:24] so um without the word applied it's
[34:27] death eternal separation or no
[34:29] fellowship
[34:31] next slide
[34:32] but
[34:35] with the word applied
[34:38] next you can go to the next slide you
[34:41] can have liberty amen aaron applied the
[34:44] word and overcame death so that's the
[34:47] font there we lost the font but overcame
[34:49] death
[34:50] in the tent liberty in the tin was my
[34:52] subtitle
[34:53] death swallowed up and then liberty in
[34:56] the tent and so in the tent in the
[34:58] holiest of holies in this place that
[34:59] aaron went dressed in the word walking
[35:02] according to the word he overcame death
[35:06] death was swallowed up in his victory by
[35:09] applying the word to his life amen
[35:14] so victory overcoming death and then his
[35:17] obedience brought victory and swallowed
[35:20] death up in the liberty of christ and
[35:23] this was done in the tent the tabernacle
[35:26] in the wilderness and when i can tell
[35:28] you're thinking there's a question in
[35:29] your mind where's the direction that
[35:31] we're going just hang on
[35:33] we'll get there
[35:34] praise the lord so the unveiling of god
[35:37] brother brahm says in the unveiling of
[35:39] god 1964 and that's god he changed
[35:42] himself from a pillar of fire to become
[35:45] a man then changed himself from that
[35:47] back in the spirit again that he might
[35:50] dwell in man god acting in man
[35:54] what he really was jesus christ was god
[35:57] acting in man in a man in the man that's
[36:00] what he was he had changed from the
[36:03] pillar of fire what is he referring to
[36:05] as a pillar of fire the tabernacle in
[36:07] the wilderness the tent amen the pillar
[36:09] of fire would hover above the tit and it
[36:12] was the pillar of fire that was
[36:14] shrouding the mercy seat in the holiest
[36:16] of holies the place that aaron would go
[36:19] to and aaron was able to step into this
[36:22] holiest of holies step into the presence
[36:25] of god by applying god's word to his
[36:27] life amen and having victory over death
[36:30] amen and from that victory death
[36:33] swallowed up amen death in the natural
[36:36] amen swallowed up because he was
[36:38] applying the word that god had given him
[36:41] amen and because of that he brought
[36:44] liberty to the camp of israel because
[36:46] what was he doing back there once a year
[36:49] applying the blood
[36:51] applying the blood it is the application
[36:54] of the blood of jesus christ that gives
[36:56] us liberty amen as sons and daughters of
[36:59] god
[37:00] so he had changed from the pillar of
[37:02] fire and they had coming which was a
[37:04] veil in the wilderness that hid god from
[37:07] israel later on in this sermon brother
[37:09] the mountain says christ is always
[37:11] veiled
[37:13] what people fail to look for what people
[37:15] miss in down through the ages is they're
[37:18] looking at the wrong thing because
[37:20] christ is veiled amen god was veiled in
[37:22] moses god was veiled in the pillar of
[37:25] fire god was veiled in the holiest of
[37:27] holies and then god transformed in
[37:30] morphe amen in more phase the greek word
[37:32] transformed into the man jesus walking
[37:35] the shores of galilee and here we have
[37:38] the the religious leaders of the day the
[37:41] the message believers of the day amen
[37:43] who were not the seed of god that were
[37:45] mixed up in the crowd mixed up in the
[37:48] church and then failed to see jesus for
[37:51] who he was god in flesh because he was a
[37:54] veil behind something that stumbled them
[37:57] saints of god fits the paradox jesus
[38:00] will stumble
[38:02] unless you drink my blood
[38:04] and eat my body
[38:06] eat my flesh why couldn't if he just
[38:08] said
[38:09] no no it's wine it's bread why didn't he
[38:12] say that
[38:14] we have questions today where we say why
[38:16] didn't god just say it this way why
[38:18] didn't the prophet just say it this way
[38:20] in the message why isn't it just obvious
[38:23] in the bible this this this laid out as
[38:25] bullet points
[38:26] because god is stumbling amen jesus
[38:29] christ is stumbling what is that
[38:31] stumbling that's the veil that hides him
[38:34] from those not called to see it amen so
[38:37] we have become by god's gift of the holy
[38:41] spirit amen by his
[38:44] breaking that veil we have become amen
[38:46] he is now the high priest of our
[38:48] confession now we can step into the
[38:51] holiest of holies but i don't want to
[38:53] get ahead of myself which was a veil in
[38:54] the wilderness he said that hid god from
[38:57] israel
[38:58] moses seen the shape of his body but
[39:00] really he was hid all the time behind
[39:03] this pillar of fire which was the logos
[39:06] that went from god
[39:08] amen
[39:09] so this logos went from god
[39:13] amen and stepped down into the man jesus
[39:16] amen the veil in the wilderness held the
[39:19] victory
[39:22] behind the veil was the victory the
[39:24] victory that every man okay prisoner i
[39:26] got ahead of my slide so next slide
[39:28] there so this this unveiling of christ
[39:31] from the pillar of fire into jesus amen
[39:34] was victory for the bride
[39:36] amen so in the tabernacle in the
[39:38] wilderness you can go to the next one
[39:40] amen
[39:41] the victory that every man of israel was
[39:43] looking for was hidden inside the tent
[39:46] hidden in the holiest of holies amen
[39:50] they were searching they were looking
[39:54] next slide
[39:57] amen they were searching they were
[39:59] looking for that victory
[40:02] they were caught there was prophecies
[40:04] coming a virgin shall conceive something
[40:07] in their hearts was calling because adam
[40:09] started it at the beginning down through
[40:11] time and began to preach the gospel of
[40:13] christ coming back and restoring eden he
[40:16] began to talk about a time appointed so
[40:19] they were looking for the appointed time
[40:22] next slide
[40:23] um from
[40:24] from that was preached about from adam
[40:27] to joseph amen coming a time down
[40:30] through moses and all this going
[40:34] going down they were waiting looking for
[40:36] the unveiling of christ that would bring
[40:38] them liberty amen coming a liberty there
[40:41] was coming a liberty down in the and and
[40:44] through time and so they're here they're
[40:46] looking for this they're desiring for
[40:48] this victory hidden behind the veil in
[40:51] the tip
[40:52] only one man could access that and i was
[40:54] aaron but he was dressed and he was
[40:56] walking right but that was their victory
[40:58] amen they had no access to it until the
[41:02] tent
[41:03] moved from a physical tent next slide to
[41:06] a spiritual tent
[41:09] on the cross of calvary christ amen
[41:11] sacrificed himself the ultimate perfect
[41:14] sacrifice and brought us victory that
[41:16] brought us liberty in christ that we
[41:19] could now go that thing that they were
[41:21] looking for that thing that the
[41:23] patriarchs and the children of abraham
[41:25] were searching for were desiring for and
[41:28] then god brought to pass when he in
[41:30] morphing when he changed his veil to
[41:34] jesus
[41:35] amen to jesus christ now this is the
[41:37] spirit of christ moved into the body of
[41:40] christ what happened
[41:42] he changed tense
[41:45] he changed
[41:46] tense when he died on the cross death
[41:49] was swallowed up in victory
[41:56] but where is that victory
[41:59] he swallowed it up
[42:01] but how do you find that victory where
[42:03] is your liberty
[42:04] it's in the tent
[42:07] no we're not gonna find fly a plane and
[42:09] set up a tent
[42:11] i'm not preaching
[42:13] the tent doctrine
[42:14] see but why is that there
[42:17] it's a veil
[42:18] it stumbles so many people
[42:21] because he's talking about the spiritual
[42:23] tent
[42:24] amen there's liberty
[42:26] in your tent
[42:28] where is your victory found out there
[42:31] somewhere
[42:33] no it's found right down inside of your
[42:35] tent
[42:37] the human veil the word is still veiled
[42:40] today
[42:42] it's hidden behind a veil a human veil
[42:45] christ has skin on him
[42:48] amen he's got skin on him and this this
[42:50] is the bride age that's why they can't
[42:52] find him right they're looking for him
[42:56] in with the tapes they're looking for
[42:58] him with with with another another
[43:00] messenger they're looking for christ
[43:03] they're searching for him
[43:08] but what's happened is god failed in the
[43:11] bride of christ amen god has changed his
[43:15] veil and now he's hidden in you
[43:18] the bride of christ amen
[43:21] praise the lord
[43:23] natural death has been swallowed up in
[43:25] victory
[43:27] but as we get down to what i want to
[43:28] what what
[43:29] was on my heart to say tonight is that
[43:32] it's more than just natural death that
[43:34] has been swallowed up in victory it is
[43:37] more than than than the passing of a
[43:39] loved one that can cross over into the
[43:42] other side that has been swallowed up it
[43:44] is spiritual death that has been
[43:46] swallowed up in victory spiritual death
[43:49] amen so christ praise the lord in the
[43:51] world and the church is looking but they
[43:53] can't find him you have impersonations
[43:56] impersonations
[43:58] because the devil doesn't know what it
[44:00] is
[44:01] he can't figure it out because it's not
[44:03] it's hidden in the blood of jesus christ
[44:06] christ in his bride numbers 25 verse 1
[44:09] to 12 you can turn to it if you like i
[44:11] have it here already
[44:12] and israel abode in shittim and the
[44:15] people begin to commit whoredom with the
[44:17] daughters of moab
[44:19] and they call the people unto the
[44:20] sacrifices of their gods and the people
[44:23] that eat and bowed down to their gods
[44:27] and israel joined himself unto bel pure
[44:30] and the anger of the lord was kindled
[44:33] against israel and the lord said unto
[44:35] moses take all the heads of of the
[44:37] people and hang them up before the lord
[44:40] against the son
[44:41] that the fierce anger of the lord may be
[44:43] turned away from israel
[44:46] and moses said unto
[44:48] the judges of israel stay ye slay ye
[44:51] every one his men that were joined unto
[44:53] baal pure and behold one of the children
[44:56] of israel came and brought unto his
[44:58] brethren a midianite woman in the sight
[45:01] of moses and in the sight of all the
[45:03] congregation of the children of israel
[45:05] who were weeping before the door of the
[45:07] tabernacle of the congregation
[45:10] so you have israel now they committed a
[45:13] great sin with mohammed they failed they
[45:16] mixed the the true vine and the false
[45:19] vine mixed amen the bride and er well
[45:22] not the bride but the elect bride will
[45:24] not fall for that but the church it was
[45:27] it was it got mixed up it fell it fell
[45:30] in deception for that moabite spirit
[45:34] and here you have now uh 4 24 or 42 000
[45:38] something like that we're slain
[45:40] and you have the people now there was a
[45:42] plague on israel
[45:45] is there a plague today on the church
[45:48] is there ever a plague today on the
[45:50] church
[45:51] and so now you have them weeping before
[45:54] the congregation weeping before
[45:58] the doors of the tabernacle of the
[46:01] congregation so they're at church
[46:03] they're repenting they're at the altar
[46:05] repenting and in steps a man
[46:08] with his
[46:09] midionitis
[46:11] wife
[46:12] a moabite
[46:14] taken in in improper to god's word he
[46:17] steps into the congregation
[46:20] bold a bold spirit of fornication trying
[46:23] to enter into the church
[46:28] it's a it's a bold spirit well all the
[46:31] spirits are getting bolder
[46:33] in the day that we live in
[46:35] a son of israel and the daughter of moab
[46:38] a man trying to mix the word of truth
[46:41] with organization
[46:43] he decided to take
[46:45] his organized religion to church
[46:49] he decided it was time to bring his idea
[46:52] of the marriage to church what are we
[46:56] doing every single day when we come to
[46:58] church we are we are in fellowship with
[47:01] our husband christ
[47:03] we are married to the word we are
[47:06] married to christ that's not coming amen
[47:08] that has happened because in order for
[47:11] us to step into glory to step into the
[47:13] rapture for that meeting in the air we
[47:15] have to be bearing the seed of christ in
[47:18] our lives
[47:20] so now we have a false representation of
[47:23] the marriage of the lamb
[47:25] stepping into church
[47:28] a spirit of fornication
[47:32] and that spirit brings death every
[47:35] single time
[47:36] it brought physical depth to the
[47:38] children of israel in this scripture and
[47:40] it will bring spiritual death to you
[47:42] today amen because god's word cannot mix
[47:46] with the false it will not mix with the
[47:49] false amen and the false will never
[47:51] bring forth life
[47:53] only christ can bring forth life israel
[47:57] was here weeping suffering from their
[48:00] sin how would you feel if you're at the
[48:03] altar repenting for your brothers
[48:05] repenting for all israel together and
[48:08] your brother walks in with this on
[48:10] his side
[48:12] in fornication standing in the midst of
[48:15] god of the tabernacle
[48:17] and then that's no different when
[48:19] somebody brings their organized religion
[48:21] idea into the mess into the church of
[48:23] god into the bride of christ
[48:26] amen standing before the door of the
[48:28] congregation they were weeping and
[48:30] repenting and the spirit of religion
[48:33] buried its head
[48:34] he thought you know what now's the time
[48:36] i'll step in and see if and they if they
[48:38] guess what in this scripture if they
[48:40] would have accepted it
[48:42] death would continue to reign
[48:44] in your in our day when that spirit
[48:46] steps into tries to step into your life
[48:49] or your church and you allow it to
[48:52] it will bring
[48:53] death to your life
[48:56] praise god
[48:57] it can be the word it doesn't have to be
[48:59] tape only it can be the worship of a man
[49:02] lift up a man amen a pastor or a
[49:05] minister up to higher than
[49:07] to a pedestal to worship him to to to to
[49:11] lift him up that will bring why because
[49:13] that's idolatry and that's the sin a man
[49:16] of of of
[49:19] witchcraft which is
[49:20] from the the harlot
[49:23] so brother branham says in the mark of
[49:25] the beast and the seal of god 1961
[49:29] notice there was moab believed in the
[49:31] same god that israel believed in
[49:34] so it wasn't the baptist it wasn't the
[49:36] pentecostals it wasn't a church of
[49:38] christ
[49:40] it wasn't rock church
[49:43] it was
[49:44] the message
[49:47] it was the message
[49:49] for it was what another illegitimate
[49:51] wrong wife large child by his daughter
[49:55] just exactly like the unborn churches
[49:57] today the church natural is a church of
[49:58] the world committing spiritual
[50:00] fornication with the world and not
[50:02] living true to god he says a very
[50:04] beautiful time
[50:06] he says in another place in the same
[50:08] message
[50:09] notice he was just as fundamental as
[50:11] israel was talking about balaam
[50:14] he built seven altars seven sacrifices
[50:17] seven rams just exactly like they were
[50:19] doing
[50:19] doing down in the camp of israel what
[50:21] does the scripture say
[50:23] so close it with the seed the very left
[50:25] if it was possible
[50:29] this seems to be the theme lately
[50:31] and uh
[50:34] i always pay attention when there's a
[50:36] thing because god is trying to tell this
[50:37] bride something and then i like to
[50:40] listen to tapes and i'll mix it up at
[50:42] work and we'll watch you know brother
[50:44] tim pruitt or
[50:46] donny or brother jewel he's kind of
[50:48] around and
[50:51] tonight i was watching with him and he
[50:53] was preaching my notes
[50:55] and
[50:56] it's just crazy to see what god's doing
[50:59] praise the lord
[51:00] i don't know where that came from
[51:02] just the same sacrifice he says but what
[51:04] balaam failed to see was that smitten
[51:06] rock that brass serpent the shout of the
[51:09] camp of the king he failed to see that
[51:11] pillar of fire going before them
[51:14] christ was veiled
[51:16] balaam failed to see all he saw was the
[51:19] seven sacrifices all he saw was was was
[51:22] it was these you know these tapes and
[51:24] these things here we'll lay this out and
[51:26] you know we'll have the cross and we'll
[51:28] have the picture of huffman's head of
[51:29] christ and we'll have the picture of the
[51:31] prophet and we'll set it all out so it
[51:32] just looks so nice
[51:35] that's what it is today you say you
[51:36] belong to the pentecostals they're a
[51:38] bunch of holy rollers he says they used
[51:40] to be but they're not no more but so
[51:42] they belong to them but they failed to
[51:44] see that pillar of fire now so they can
[51:46] be sure to see it we got a picture of it
[51:48] scientifically proved amen yes they
[51:50] failed to see the pillar of fire the
[51:52] shout of the camp that there's a king
[51:55] among us
[51:56] king jesus they failed to see it he
[51:58] failed to see that blood atonement amen
[52:01] that's what happened when balaam looked
[52:03] and said and said i see the backside of
[52:05] israel but when he when he began to to
[52:07] try to prophesy god took over and began
[52:10] to bless israel why because god looks
[52:12] upon his bride amen through the eyes of
[52:16] grace through the blood of jesus christ
[52:18] amen because death has been swallowed up
[52:21] in victory what is that victory the
[52:23] revelation of jesus christ to you today
[52:26] amen that is the victory that you have
[52:28] and that going to swallow up the death
[52:30] of organized religion swallow up the
[52:32] death of indifference swallow up the
[52:34] death of iniquity amen there ain't no
[52:37] grave that's gonna keep this body down
[52:40] amen and that's inside your life
[52:42] spiritually speaking
[52:44] amen praise the glory meant death
[52:46] swallowed up
[52:48] so balaam failed to see christ
[52:53] he failed to see christ that's the
[52:55] problem with the shock
[52:59] that's your hint
[53:01] that's the problem with the shuck
[53:03] the shuck and the seed the difference is
[53:05] the shuck kind of looks like it
[53:08] has the sacrifices
[53:10] you know
[53:11] fill in the blanks everything else i i
[53:13] just i'm not preaching against people
[53:15] i i try not to keep talking about the
[53:17] tapes only things i don't want anybody
[53:19] to think i'm trying to you know defend
[53:21] god's gospel he does that himself i'm
[53:23] not trying to attack anybody but it's
[53:26] the spirit of the age that we're living
[53:28] in and god is addressing it it's not
[53:30] written in my notes and then god is
[53:32] addressing it and then so now we have
[53:34] the shuck
[53:36] and the seed we have
[53:38] deception in the camp of israel why
[53:40] because israel when they when they went
[53:43] to the feast of bel pior
[53:47] that it was the shock
[53:49] looked pretty good
[53:50] it looked really good hey as far as i'm
[53:52] gonna turn it's the real thing it looks
[53:54] like the real thing
[53:57] so close
[53:58] so close
[54:00] but it's not possible because the next
[54:02] slide
[54:04] if you keep reading the scripture there
[54:06] was a man
[54:09] god always has a man
[54:13] you can go to the next slide this is
[54:14] messed up but
[54:16] now when phineas the son of eleazar the
[54:19] son of aaron the priest saw he rosa
[54:21] we're continuing in in verse seven thank
[54:23] you
[54:24] he saw he rose up from among the
[54:26] congregation and took a javelin in his
[54:28] hand and then he took the word
[54:31] that double-edged sword what is the word
[54:34] to sin a weapon
[54:37] what is the word of god it's a weapon so
[54:39] he took a javelin in his hand and then
[54:42] he took the word in his hand brother
[54:44] bennett preached that message what is in
[54:45] your hand little david amen what's in
[54:48] your hand bride of christ what do you
[54:49] have in your hand you have the word of
[54:51] god you say oh my goodness it's so
[54:53] closely to see the very elect and it
[54:56] looks just like the real thing how can
[54:58] we even make it why even try take the
[55:00] word
[55:01] take up the word amen when there's a
[55:04] when there's
[55:05] a a
[55:06] spirit of fornication a spirit of of
[55:09] idolatry of the organization of man
[55:12] trying to come into your life amen or
[55:14] even anything contrary to the word of
[55:16] god take up the word
[55:18] amen and so he goes on to say he said
[55:21] then he went after the man of israel
[55:24] into the tent and thrust both of them
[55:26] through the man of israel and the woman
[55:28] through her belly so the plague was
[55:29] stayed from the children of israel and
[55:32] those that died in the plague were
[55:33] twenty and four thousand
[55:36] and the lord speak unto moses saying
[55:38] phineas the son of eliezer the son of
[55:41] aaron the priest hath turned my wrath
[55:43] away from the children of israel
[55:45] while he was zealous for my sake among
[55:48] them
[55:49] that i consumed not
[55:52] excuse me the children of israel in my
[55:53] jealousy wherefore say behold i give
[55:56] unto him
[55:57] my covenant of peace
[56:00] when you take the word in your hand
[56:03] how does it
[56:05] how can you take the word by faith
[56:10] faith gives you the ability to pick up
[56:12] the javelin next slide
[56:16] faith
[56:17] just keep going
[56:19] produces
[56:21] he gone
[56:22] action
[56:23] which produces victory
[56:26] it takes faith in god's word phineas had
[56:30] faith that god's word was true go and
[56:33] slay all of the sin from israel so he
[56:36] goes
[56:37] because he has faith that it's true
[56:40] and he picks up the javelin
[56:42] amen that faith faith produced the
[56:46] confidence infineous to pick up the word
[56:50] of god and take it into action amen and
[56:54] in that action you say oh such a
[56:56] horrible thing but that
[56:58] action brought victory for israel it
[57:02] stayed the plague and every time you
[57:05] take the word of god in faith and act
[57:08] upon it it will bring victory to your
[57:10] camp it will bring victory to your life
[57:13] it will bring victory to your family and
[57:15] it will bring the ultimate victory to
[57:18] the bride of jesus christ
[57:20] praise the lord
[57:22] god gave phineas a covenant of peace in
[57:26] recognition of his faith in the word
[57:30] there was another covenant given amen a
[57:32] covenant given to abraham
[57:35] amen because abraham took action on
[57:38] god's word that's why he says people get
[57:41] confused and that scripture be still and
[57:43] know that i am god
[57:45] amen to be still means to not worry
[57:49] he still needs me means to have faith to
[57:52] stand solid on god's word amen and act
[57:55] upon his word it's not to sit down and
[57:57] give up the fight
[57:59] what if phineas didn't take up the word
[58:01] and
[58:02] go and act upon it
[58:04] the plague would have continued and then
[58:06] you've been given a covenant of peace
[58:09] there in that tent phineas brought
[58:12] victory to israel over death
[58:15] death was consuming the camp of israel
[58:18] but phineas amen went and took the word
[58:21] into the tent
[58:23] funny how things aren't in scripture for
[58:25] no reason at all amen in the tent is
[58:27] where he took the word amen and defeated
[58:30] death he defeated death for the camp of
[58:33] israel praise the lord
[58:35] amen we'll read another example and this
[58:38] one i love
[58:40] um you can go to the next uh slide there
[58:43] my covenant of peace
[58:45] we'll have to just do this one again in
[58:46] a few months when the slides are working
[58:49] i'm just kidding they're doing a great
[58:50] job thanks guys judges chapter 4 verse
[58:52] 17.
[58:54] now how be it caesarea
[58:56] sacra
[58:58] fled away on his feet to the tent of
[58:59] jail the wife of heber the canine
[59:04] for there was peace between jabin
[59:06] the king of hazor
[59:08] and the house of hebrew the king knight
[59:10] and jail went out to meet caesar and
[59:13] said unto him turn in my lord turn into
[59:15] me fear not and when he had turned in
[59:17] unto her into the tent she covered him
[59:19] with a mantle so this is the the battle
[59:22] of barack and deborah
[59:24] against
[59:25] syria i think
[59:27] the enemy
[59:29] she covered him with the man and he said
[59:30] unto her give me i pray thee a little
[59:32] water to drink for i am thirsty and she
[59:34] opened a bottle of milk and gave him
[59:36] drink and covered him
[59:39] again he said unto her stand in the door
[59:41] of the tent and it shall be when any man
[59:43] hath come and inquire of thee and say is
[59:46] there any man here thou shalt say no
[59:49] in jail hebrews wife took a nail of the
[59:51] tent
[59:52] and took a hammer in her hand and went
[59:54] softly unto him and smote the nail into
[59:56] his temples and fastened it into the
[59:58] ground for he was fast asleep and weary
[1:00:01] so he died
[1:00:03] isn't it crazy
[1:00:05] the devil will come into your tent
[1:00:08] and tell you what to do
[1:00:12] see there was a treaty between
[1:00:15] the family of jail
[1:00:17] and the enemy
[1:00:20] next slide
[1:00:23] peace there was peace
[1:00:25] between jail's family and the enemy
[1:00:27] you can't make peace
[1:00:29] with the devil
[1:00:31] there's always strings attached
[1:00:34] always
[1:00:37] and you you wonder you know there's a
[1:00:39] province that if barack didn't go by
[1:00:41] himself if he took deborah then the
[1:00:43] victory was going to be given into the
[1:00:44] hands of a woman that was the prophecy
[1:00:46] that went forth
[1:00:47] and i was sitting and i was studying
[1:00:49] this and i was thinking why why a woman
[1:00:51] you know
[1:00:54] why a woman
[1:00:56] and i begin to realize
[1:01:00] what's the loveliest lady that we know
[1:01:02] of
[1:01:04] the bride of christ
[1:01:07] jail was a type of the bride of christ
[1:01:09] you see the devil had come knocking for
[1:01:11] the last time
[1:01:13] he says hey hey heidi we have a treaty
[1:01:16] right we have peace yeah but that peace
[1:01:19] never said you can come into my tent and
[1:01:20] tell me what to do sorry there's a
[1:01:22] hidden clause
[1:01:24] well i have a response from jail to the
[1:01:28] devil
[1:01:29] in every treaty you make in your life
[1:01:32] with the devil or what you made at one
[1:01:35] point in time
[1:01:36] you have a hidden clause
[1:01:39] little asterisks down at the bottom tiny
[1:01:41] fine print that says paid in full
[1:01:45] knowledgeable at any time voidable at
[1:01:48] any time because jesus christ amen
[1:01:52] oh i'm gonna jump off the platform jesus
[1:01:54] christ
[1:01:56] nullified your contract with the devil
[1:01:59] amen there is no way for it to stand why
[1:02:01] because it's blood for blood
[1:02:04] that's the contract blood for blood and
[1:02:06] christ gave his blood and
[1:02:10] cut that tree that you have with the
[1:02:11] devil
[1:02:12] so now jail she says enough is enough he
[1:02:15] comes into my tent and then you got to
[1:02:17] get mad at the devil saints of god you
[1:02:19] got to get upset that he's messing with
[1:02:21] your family you've got to get upset he's
[1:02:23] messing with your church you got to say
[1:02:25] enough is enough
[1:02:28] why didn't she just take a uh the hammer
[1:02:30] and mash his head and why a
[1:02:32] steak why a steak because saying say god
[1:02:35] you gotta drive a steak down you gotta
[1:02:37] say at this point in this time i am
[1:02:40] putting my steak down into the rock of
[1:02:42] jesus christ amen in the devil that
[1:02:45] treaty is no more amen you can't come
[1:02:48] into my tent anymore and tell me what to
[1:02:50] do you can't tell come into my tent and
[1:02:52] have me feed you milk and take care of
[1:02:55] you and put a mantle upon you i've
[1:02:57] allowed it for too long and then i'm
[1:03:00] cutting the contract
[1:03:03] every praise the lord
[1:03:06] so she
[1:03:07] took that stake
[1:03:10] she drove it into his head
[1:03:12] the lovely lady of the word
[1:03:14] she's got power behind her
[1:03:17] oh she's nice looking on the outside
[1:03:20] but don't cross her she's got the power
[1:03:23] of christ to back her every move up
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:28] he thought he had the victory in the
[1:03:30] garden of eden when he seduced eve
[1:03:33] amen he thought he had the victory and
[1:03:35] then when he took um took down each ever
[1:03:38] and every man that went down into the
[1:03:40] grave he thought he had the victory over
[1:03:42] the camp of israel but god always has a
[1:03:45] man amen god just needs one person an
[1:03:48] individual who is willing to surrender
[1:03:50] completely to him amen that he can take
[1:03:53] them and then drive the stake into the
[1:03:56] head of the enemy and it doesn't say
[1:03:58] that's not that doesn't it doesn't in
[1:04:00] there she says he she fastened it to the
[1:04:03] ground
[1:04:04] she went through his head and then she
[1:04:06] kept on going just enough is enough not
[1:04:09] ever again amen determination to take
[1:04:13] god's word what did she do she took
[1:04:15] faith in god's word and put it to action
[1:04:19] and in her tent and then she found
[1:04:22] liberty from in in christ they meant
[1:04:25] death was swallowed up death you say she
[1:04:28] was alive yes but she swallowed up the
[1:04:30] spiritual death that was in her family
[1:04:32] amen praise the lord from this day
[1:04:34] forward no more satan it is finished
[1:04:37] amen will not play church anymore we'll
[1:04:39] drive that stake and we'll fasten it to

[1:04:46] you mean business amen fasten the snake
[1:04:50] steak to the ground
[1:04:55] amen that bride rose up
[1:04:58] through every age down through time
[1:05:00] and satan would come sauntering in say
[1:05:02] i'll handle this one again
[1:05:04] i'll take care of this
[1:05:06] so he killed 68 million of them going to
[1:05:09] the church age book with the youth group
[1:05:10] right now we just went through the via
[1:05:12] tyrone church age one of the darkest
[1:05:14] stages
[1:05:15] 68 million protestants
[1:05:18] martyred for christ see satan
[1:05:20] thought he had the victory
[1:05:23] but then the seed
[1:05:25] put forth the bud in the ground
[1:05:27] amen lord willing
[1:05:31] next time
[1:05:33] amen
[1:05:34] could almost be a part two i'm trying
[1:05:36] not to go into that the next one the
[1:05:38] next sermon praise god
[1:05:41] that seed put forth amen what was what
[1:05:42] was what was giving that seed life was
[1:05:45] the logos
[1:05:46] very hovering over that sea
[1:05:49] praise the lord but in that secret place
[1:05:51] in her tent
[1:05:52] the bride
[1:05:53] had gotten something that satan will
[1:05:56] never know you see
[1:05:57] abraham and sarah received a promise
[1:06:00] sarah was burned she couldn't have kids
[1:06:03] they received the promise that they
[1:06:04] would have a son
[1:06:06] year went by five years 10 years 20
[1:06:09] years
[1:06:10] 25 years
[1:06:12] no promise yet
[1:06:14] no fulfillment of that promise
[1:06:16] but one day
[1:06:19] the promise
[1:06:21] swallowed up death
[1:06:22] in their tent
[1:06:24] and god brought forth the promised son
[1:06:28] the same things happened in your life
[1:06:30] god called you aside
[1:06:32] he took you in the tent amen and
[1:06:35] his victory swallowed up death in your
[1:06:37] life
[1:06:38] and then um the unveiling of god 1964.
[1:06:45] moses come down and and said you might
[1:06:47] not believe this
[1:06:52] maybe
[1:06:53] but god appeared to be in the pillar of
[1:06:55] fire and he told me these things
[1:07:00] it's not going to ferrel
[1:07:01] oh we have all kind of things like going
[1:07:04] on pharaoh said
[1:07:06] why pastor farrell said
[1:07:08] well you got a cheap magician trick
[1:07:11] well i got a magician's here that can
[1:07:13] turn a serpent into a stick into a
[1:07:15] serpent come here magicians and they
[1:07:18] come over and done the same thing moses
[1:07:20] knowed
[1:07:22] no nothing bothered him
[1:07:24] how many impersonators they had didn't
[1:07:26] make a bit of difference
[1:07:29] moses just stood still
[1:07:32] the first thing you know they crawled
[1:07:33] around a while and directly
[1:07:35] moses says snake just eat the rest of
[1:07:37] them up
[1:07:40] death
[1:07:40] swallowed up
[1:07:42] see why like them apostles they couldn't
[1:07:44] explain it moses didn't know how god was
[1:07:46] going to do but he was going
[1:07:49] to do it remember he said jamers and
[1:07:52] janice will return in the last days see
[1:07:55] impersonations and would deceive the
[1:07:58] very elect if possible matthew 24 24 see
[1:08:01] just exactly the same things do the same
[1:08:03] kind of miracles and everything
[1:08:06] so you could say you can look at this
[1:08:08] this quote here you could say oh when
[1:08:10] janice and jamboree's they're here today
[1:08:12] we can we can acknowledge that
[1:08:13] impersonators are here today you can say
[1:08:15] oh they're gonna they're gonna do the
[1:08:17] same trick
[1:08:20] well look at the other part of the
[1:08:21] scripture
[1:08:23] those two snakes were swallowed up
[1:08:25] by the truth
[1:08:26] see oh oh they're impersonating it how
[1:08:29] will we know watch for the truth to
[1:08:32] swallow up death
[1:08:35] the man uh excuse me
[1:08:37] do the same kind of miracles watch the
[1:08:38] word see watch the word don't watch what
[1:08:41] someone else is saying don't watch with
[1:08:42] someone else
[1:08:43] watch the word of god the man says
[1:08:46] he does a miracle and still wants to
[1:08:48] believe that there is three gods and
[1:08:51] there is all these kind you get away
[1:08:53] from that kind of i say today there's a
[1:08:55] man says he does a miracle and he still
[1:08:57] wants to believe
[1:08:59] contrary to the scripture
[1:09:02] doesn't matter what that is he can be
[1:09:03] preaching almost the truth but if
[1:09:06] there's one thing in his life
[1:09:08] that doesn't line up with that word of
[1:09:09] god amen
[1:09:11] there's death in the camp
[1:09:13] that's wrong see no such thing see the
[1:09:15] word every word every word that
[1:09:16] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:09:18] genesis one word why did he say genesis
[1:09:21] because eve in the garden of eden one
[1:09:22] word changed it over here said don't
[1:09:24] take or add one word see it's got to be
[1:09:26] that same word see
[1:09:28] amen so truth will swallow death up
[1:09:32] amen truth
[1:09:34] will set you
[1:09:35] free
[1:09:37] amen there are impersonations now there
[1:09:39] are doctrines and ideas that would
[1:09:41] deceive the very elect if possible
[1:09:43] but do not
[1:09:46] but do not fear amen the truth will
[1:09:49] swallow death up every single time amen
[1:09:53] you
[1:09:56] praise the lord
[1:09:59] it doesn't matter what it is doesn't
[1:10:02] matter how close he looks to the real
[1:10:04] thing and then you watch the word he
[1:10:05] says watch the word and death will
[1:10:08] swallow up
[1:10:10] amen and when and that victory that
[1:10:12] swallows death up is the same victory
[1:10:15] that gives you liberty in your tent in
[1:10:18] your body in your life and then you can
[1:10:20] have the victory over whatever magician
[1:10:23] tricks the devil throws at you amen you
[1:10:25] can have the victory amen
[1:10:28] someone was speaking the other day they
[1:10:30] were talking about the the gibeonites
[1:10:32] that came to joshua and they had stale
[1:10:34] bread and they had you know threaded
[1:10:36] their um ripped their clothes up and put
[1:10:38] dust on themselves like they had a long
[1:10:40] journey and they and it was only three
[1:10:43] days in reality and they tricked joseph
[1:10:45] uh joshua and the reason they tricked
[1:10:48] joshua is because joshua didn't go back
[1:10:50] to the word directly for every little
[1:10:53] thing says god you've got to go back to
[1:10:55] the word keep a pulse on the word of god
[1:10:58] keep a pulse you know what that means
[1:10:59] you're constantly watching is is this
[1:11:02] according to god's word is this
[1:11:04] according to god's will amen every step
[1:11:06] every conversation that you have
[1:11:08] especially now in in the day that we
[1:11:10] live in some some of us family caught up
[1:11:12] in
[1:11:13] in in uh you know that
[1:11:16] that's uh antichrist spirit and then
[1:11:18] they want to just you know want to try
[1:11:20] to bring you down they want to try to
[1:11:22] talk to you and they want to try to try
[1:11:23] to just fill your head with nonsense you
[1:11:25] got to even pray you know should you
[1:11:27] answer the phone right now or if you
[1:11:29] should what what should you say amen
[1:11:32] every little thing why god wants a wife
[1:11:35] who's completely dependent upon him i
[1:11:38] mean i don't want i don't want my wife
[1:11:40] to be all independent because then she
[1:11:41] don't need me
[1:11:44] but see the thing of it is
[1:11:46] the bride of christ
[1:11:48] has to have christ
[1:11:50] or we just fall apart
[1:11:52] we just fall apart we have to be fully
[1:11:55] and completely dependent upon christ if
[1:11:58] we want to have victory why because
[1:11:59] christ is the victory that has swallowed
[1:12:02] up death amen the the doubts that arise
[1:12:05] in your life you know i was i was going
[1:12:07] to preach one time and i maybe i've
[1:12:09] shared this testimony if i have forgive
[1:12:11] me but i was going to preach one time
[1:12:13] for a brother andrew boy scout out in
[1:12:14] chief act and i was in the office and
[1:12:17] and all of the sudden this spirit of
[1:12:19] doubt came down into the room that to
[1:12:21] tell me that that this whole thing is
[1:12:23] nothing but a man's idea and brother
[1:12:26] branham and all this stuff and maybe
[1:12:27] everybody's right and i i couldn't
[1:12:30] believe it it was such a strong presence
[1:12:33] of that spirit and i was like man i'm
[1:12:36] fixing to go out there and preach you
[1:12:37] see even though those thoughts were
[1:12:39] going through my head my heart was
[1:12:41] testifying contrary my heart was saying
[1:12:43] no i don't believe that i don't accept
[1:12:45] that but i was still battling that and
[1:12:47] you understand if any um all of you have
[1:12:50] been through battles you understand what
[1:12:52] i'm talking about your heart is crying
[1:12:53] out against that
[1:12:54] and so i i was just uh kind of taken
[1:12:58] blindsided and i began to sometimes i
[1:13:01] don't know
[1:13:01] some people maybe say it's adhd i have
[1:13:04] to fidget constantly so sometimes when i
[1:13:05] pray i pace and it helps me focus and so
[1:13:08] i just started to pace the office and i
[1:13:10] began to pray and i thought you know
[1:13:12] what and something count over me what it
[1:13:15] was it was it was the victory of christ
[1:13:17] began to stand and testify and then the
[1:13:19] atonement stood and testified and he
[1:13:22] began to speak and i began to say all
[1:13:24] right satan if it's not the truth what
[1:13:27] about this and if this isn't the truth
[1:13:29] what about this victory and if this
[1:13:31] isn't the truth what about this healing
[1:13:33] and if this isn't the truth what about
[1:13:35] this scripture and what about the
[1:13:36] manifestation of this in my own life and
[1:13:39] this person's life and that person's
[1:13:40] life and i begin to testify of what the
[1:13:43] works of christ i begin to testify of
[1:13:46] the victory that overcame death i began
[1:13:48] to testify of the anointing the holy
[1:13:51] spirit that now was standing veil in the
[1:13:53] bride of christ and you know what that
[1:13:55] spirit left
[1:13:57] and the presence of god came down and i
[1:13:59] and i went in and it was gone from me
[1:14:01] why because he can't stand against the
[1:14:04] word of god
[1:14:05] by faith see i had faith in my heart was
[1:14:08] it of myself absolutely not god put the
[1:14:12] faith within me to stand and testify and
[1:14:14] i began to when i began to testify what
[1:14:16] was that it was the faith in my heart by
[1:14:19] god's grace taking the word in hand amen
[1:14:23] and bringing victory to my tent amen
[1:14:25] that was just a and then you say well
[1:14:27] why would not allow that
[1:14:29] i am
[1:14:32] without any guile or frustration i'm
[1:14:34] gonna say i'm tired of hearing people
[1:14:36] say why would god do that
[1:14:38] why do you do what you
[1:14:40] do stop asking that question
[1:14:44] you don't know it just accept like don't
[1:14:46] ask why i ask how
[1:14:48] don't ask why ask how
[1:14:50] you can serve god as you know okay so
[1:14:53] not instead why did why did why did this
[1:14:55] happen in your life you know
[1:14:57] listen to the testimony of what god
[1:14:59] brought them through you say that that
[1:15:01] brother um
[1:15:02] tim prone in his church they had a had
[1:15:05] to fight that spirit when sister karen
[1:15:07] passed away oh people say oh well she
[1:15:09] didn't get healed
[1:15:12] she got healed better than she could on
[1:15:14] this side of heaven
[1:15:16] on this side of glory she got she got a
[1:15:18] better healing that she could ever
[1:15:19] receive on this side of glory but see
[1:15:21] that the scoffer wants to rise up and
[1:15:23] say oh but she passed on and the scarf
[1:15:25] wants to rise up and say all these
[1:15:27] things but guess what just take it back
[1:15:29] to the word
[1:15:30] because what
[1:15:32] the bible doesn't say
[1:15:33] you know you swallowed up death
[1:15:37] right
[1:15:39] i need that scripture real quick here
[1:15:43] first corinthians
[1:16:01] amen the bible testifies of christ said
[1:16:03] that death is swallowed up in victory
[1:16:07] but guess what you swallow up death
[1:16:10] every day of your life
[1:16:11] because god has anointed you
[1:16:14] christ is in your life
[1:16:16] veiled to the world behind you hey my
[1:16:19] sister if you want to come tonight we're
[1:16:20] going to wrap this up
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:23] death is swallowed up
[1:16:26] amen physical natural death is swallowed
[1:16:28] up in victory
[1:16:30] amen but
[1:16:31] spiritual death is swallowed up in
[1:16:33] victory don't ever put a period on the
[1:16:35] end of someone's life
[1:16:36] you never know what god's going to do
[1:16:38] when i have friends and i have loved
[1:16:40] ones amen caught up in that and you
[1:16:42] can't put a period on the end of their
[1:16:44] life you do not know what god's going to
[1:16:48] do amen but you and this is something
[1:16:50] that the lord is dealing with with with
[1:16:52] me and my wife on and by god's grace you
[1:16:54] know we we uh
[1:16:57] we got it i guess you could say not
[1:16:58] perfect i'm not saying that but the lord
[1:17:01] is teaching us something and we picked
[1:17:02] it up and we took it to heart and god
[1:17:04] miraculously changed the situation that
[1:17:06] we had in our lives miraculously someone
[1:17:09] in a relationship i had with someone
[1:17:10] that was broken for years never heard
[1:17:12] from them never got a phone call never
[1:17:14] got a text they just we god dealt with
[1:17:17] our heart and begin to deal with us you
[1:17:18] know let's make sure we have no
[1:17:20] bitterness on our side
[1:17:23] for when god brings them out we're
[1:17:26] prepared to accept it
[1:17:29] you don't want to build a business
[1:17:30] because it's not against that person
[1:17:32] it's against the spirit right we don't
[1:17:34] want to get wrestle against flesh and
[1:17:35] blood but against the principalities and
[1:17:37] the power of the air so if you have a
[1:17:38] loved one that's caught up in in
[1:17:41] something false doctrine or or the you
[1:17:43] know anti-message thing you want to make
[1:17:45] sure your heart is conditioned right so
[1:17:47] that when they
[1:17:49] find their liberty you can accept them
[1:17:52] and
[1:17:53] there's a relationship
[1:17:55] there that that they can step into
[1:17:58] because they're going to need that that
[1:18:00] us that that that love there of christ
[1:18:03] and it also if if you keep yourself open
[1:18:07] to god to let god use you to have a soft
[1:18:10] heart then he can speak through you but
[1:18:12] if you're coiled up in bitterness then
[1:18:14] he can't speak through and so we were
[1:18:16] taking little things all out of context
[1:18:19] and god began to deal with our hearts
[1:18:20] and he changed our uh perception of the
[1:18:24] situation you begin to look at ourselves
[1:18:26] and say you know what i'm not going to
[1:18:28] accept that i'm not going to start to
[1:18:29] talk about that
[1:18:31] because that's not edifying that's not
[1:18:33] what god would want me to be saying and
[1:18:36] we begin to just leave that stuff alone
[1:18:38] and out of the blue
[1:18:40] person texted me
[1:18:42] first time in years
[1:18:44] out of the blue see god was just waiting
[1:18:47] for us to get out of the way
[1:18:49] man we'll see what god will do
[1:18:53] we're waiting on on a full and complete
[1:18:55] manifestation but
[1:18:57] um it's the first step in the right
[1:18:59] direction because we got ourselves out
[1:19:01] of the way and that's the biggest thing
[1:19:03] that god if you want to god to take you
[1:19:05] and use you and allow you to be phineas
[1:19:07] and take up the word and take action and
[1:19:09] you have to have a heart that's
[1:19:11] completely surrendered to him when you
[1:19:12] can't have nothing in the way praise the
[1:19:15] lord why don't we stand tonight
[1:19:20] embarrassed by our heads
[1:19:23] heavenly father lord jesus
[1:19:25] i pray that lord something was said
[1:19:27] tonight about jesus not by myself
[1:19:30] but i'll have notes and i'll say certain
[1:19:32] things and then i'll hear testimonies
[1:19:35] it's not even what i thought i heard but
[1:19:38] god because you took it
[1:19:40] you put it to your use
[1:19:42] but i don't want to be i don't wanna i
[1:19:44] don't want personal gain i don't want
[1:19:46] anything i just
[1:19:47] we just want you
[1:19:48] to take the words that were spoken
[1:19:50] tonight
