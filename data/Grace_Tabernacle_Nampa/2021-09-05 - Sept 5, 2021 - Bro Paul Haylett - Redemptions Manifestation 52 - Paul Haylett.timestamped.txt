[18:17] this as we get ready to
[18:19] receive our pastor
[18:21] i have heard how
[18:24] christians long ago
[18:28] were brought before
[18:32] a tyrant's throne they were told that he
[18:38] would spare
[18:40] their
[18:41] if they would
[18:43] renounce the name of christ but one by
[18:49] one
[18:51] they chose to die
[18:54] the
[18:55] of god
[18:57] they would not deny
[19:00] like the great egelic
[19:04] fire sinks
[19:06] i can almost
[19:09] their
[19:10] voices break i pledge

[19:22] with all i am i will seek to honor his
[19:30] command
[19:31] i pledge allegiance to
[19:36] the land
[19:39] now the years have come
[19:42] and the years have gone
[19:45] but the cause of jesus
[19:49] still goes on now our time has come
[19:54] to count the cause
[19:58] to reject this world
[20:01] to embrace the cross so one by one
[20:06] let us live our lives we're the one who
[20:11] died
[20:13] to give us life till the trumpet sounds
[20:19] on that final day
[20:22] let us proudly stand
[20:25] and
[20:26] boldly say i pledge
[20:30] allegiance to
[20:32] the lamb

[20:45] a man

[21:34] i pledge allegiance to
[21:39] the land
[21:42] hallelujah
[21:45] amen
[21:46] hallelujah i guess i didn't see
[21:49] the message about what is happening in
[21:51] afghanistan but
[21:53] i did
[21:54] this morning take a moment just to look
[21:56] and see and you know it's interesting
[21:59] saints i come across a little article of
[22:02] someone who
[22:03] is there in afghanistan and they had
[22:06] sent out a message to friends you might
[22:08] say on the outside
[22:11] we can understand the calling or the
[22:13] reflection of human nature and some have
[22:15] shut off their cell phones or
[22:18] disposed of them entirely and have gone
[22:20] into hiding
[22:23] and it's amazing that others
[22:26] have taken to the street
[22:29] and are going door to door
[22:32] in their one last testimony
[22:35] jesus christ is alive and well
[22:38] and he's here to save you and if we have
[22:41] to give our life
[22:42] we will simply give our life
[22:45] if that's what god has called us to do
[22:47] so you know it's a very interesting
[22:49] world we live in interesting times and
[22:52] you know we can get a little sad about
[22:54] what we see around us and all that has
[22:57] happened
[22:58] uh and uh
[22:59] but i i think we should take the
[23:01] scripture to heart that when you see
[23:03] these things coming to pass
[23:05] look up
[23:07] amen your redemption draw nigh it's not
[23:10] a time for us to get discouraged and not
[23:12] a time for us to cry and be frustrated
[23:14] but a time to look up amen
[23:17] well i just want to say god bless you
[23:19] sister tomah happy to have you back in
[23:22] our midst amen uh so lovely time i'm
[23:26] sure with family and amongst all those
[23:29] that you've grown through the years and
[23:31] spent so much time with
[23:33] and uh brother sergey we're once again
[23:36] declare we're very happy to have you
[23:38] back home i'm sure the family is also
[23:41] excited to see you
[23:43] god bless you our visitor in the back
[23:44] this morning i pray you have a lovely
[23:47] day today also in the presence of the
[23:49] lord god bless you saints just let's
[23:52] stand as we go into the word today and
[23:55] as we look at this
[23:57] we also want to remember kind of some
[24:00] things that we
[24:01] don't always come to our minds but
[24:04] remember brother ivan sister nadia's
[24:06] there on this little holiday i joked the
[24:08] other day that they're
[24:09] going down there where the storms are
[24:12] happening but just
[24:14] pray god just be with them and let them
[24:16] have a time of rest and comfort and
[24:20] just time together and also we want to
[24:23] remember our sister nadia
[24:25] we've been identifying her as uh brother
[24:28] sergey's mother but she is our sister so
[24:31] i'm i'm wanting to move to identify her
[24:34] for who she is not just brother sergey's
[24:37] mother amen and so just keep her in
[24:40] prayer also as uh the the government has
[24:43] their their process
[24:45] drug out for time and so just a few more
[24:48] weeks
[24:49] she will uh be coming
[24:51] to be here with the family and and we
[24:54] thank the lord for that just ask for his
[24:56] hand of mercy and also our daughter jo
[24:59] lynn
[25:00] um
[25:01] not here this morning so just ask you to
[25:04] remember her in prayer also
[25:06] amen let's turn our bibles to
[25:08] revelations 19
[25:10] verses 1 through 9.
[25:12] actually a very very precious and lovely
[25:15] scripture to me
[25:17] uh as i look at this and we'll expound
[25:20] on that in just a few minutes
[25:22] um
[25:23] but uh it is uh
[25:28] have a much deeper i think it's a much
[25:30] deeper scripture than maybe we sometimes
[25:32] give credit to when we read it and we
[25:35] say oh that is beautiful and it brings a
[25:37] tear to our heart
[25:39] to our eyes and joy to our hearts but
[25:41] it's actually actually a very very deep
[25:44] scripture and uh so let's just turn
[25:46] right now revelations 19 and 1.
[25:49] after these things i heard a great voice
[25:52] of much people in heaven saying
[25:54] hallelujah now remember this is not
[25:57] angels
[25:59] it doesn't say i heard a great chorus of
[26:02] angels
[26:03] amen
[26:04] i heard a great voice of much people in
[26:06] heaven saying alleluia salvation and
[26:09] glory and honor and power and to the
[26:12] lord our god
[26:14] for true and righteous are his judgments
[26:16] for he hath judged the great
[26:18] which did corrupt the earth with her
[26:20] fornication and hath avenged the blood
[26:23] of his servants at her hand
[26:25] and again they said alleluia and her
[26:28] smoke rose up forever and ever and the
[26:31] four and twenty elders and the four
[26:32] beasts fell down and worshiped god that
[26:35] said on the throne saying amen
[26:38] hallelujah and a voice came out of the
[26:40] throne saying praise our god
[26:43] all ye his servants and ye that fear him
[26:46] both small and great and i
[26:49] heard as it were
[26:51] the voice of a great multitude in other
[26:54] words this was not a whisper it was not
[26:56] just a slight rumble in the background
[26:58] but this was a voice this was a sound
[27:01] that come forth an attention-grabbing
[27:04] sound
[27:05] of many voices a great multitude and as
[27:08] a voice of many waters and as the voice
[27:10] of mighty thundering saying hallelujah
[27:13] for the lord god omnipotent reigneth now
[27:17] my brother and sister when we look in
[27:18] this scripture uh this has confused many
[27:21] people through the years and people have
[27:23] turned it into doctrines
[27:26] the thunders the voice of god and and
[27:28] that you know people say and some claim
[27:30] and we won't go into this but some say
[27:32] well you know i am or my ministry or i
[27:35] was called to be that thundering and but
[27:37] let's just get this straight and keep it
[27:39] in its simplicity the thunders in their
[27:42] simplicity is god's voice
[27:45] so it is there you can say well okay but
[27:49] what about this or what about that god
[27:51] uses voices god uses your voice he uses
[27:55] my voice but ultimately the voice that
[27:58] matters the only one that has any
[28:01] significance is god's voice
[28:03] and so as the thunders come forth this
[28:06] is the word coming from the throne of
[28:08] almighty god to his people and it might
[28:12] be a prophet's voice that actually
[28:14] speaks this but he does not come in his
[28:17] own name even jesus said i don't come in
[28:19] my own name i come in the father and so
[28:22] we as sons and daughters of god and the
[28:24] prophets through the ages they come
[28:27] speaking and when they spoke the word
[28:30] right
[28:31] let's just cut out the negative okay
[28:34] when the word was spoken
[28:37] it was god's word
[28:40] it was god's voice
[28:42] so when we see here a voice
[28:47] of many watering
[28:49] we see a voice
[28:52] of mighty thunderings
[28:55] it doesn't matter my brother and sister
[28:57] i want you to just kind of approach this
[28:59] in an open mind it doesn't matter if it
[29:02] come as it were through the voice of a
[29:03] prophet or come through your voice if
[29:05] it's the word it's god's voice
[29:09] when you speak the word of god amen it's
[29:12] god speaking amen
[29:16] saying hallelujah for the lord god
[29:18] omnipotent reigneth how many times have
[29:20] you testified of that
[29:23] how many times have you declared to
[29:24] somebody it was jesus christ that
[29:26] changed my life
[29:28] how many times have you lifted up and
[29:31] said you know what i was in this
[29:32] situation the lord come on the scene i i
[29:35] had a migraine and and i said lord
[29:37] please help me and it went away
[29:39] much better than excedrin
[29:42] amen
[29:43] because it was the voice of god speaking
[29:45] the word of god
[29:47] and when the word of god is spoken
[29:50] it brings results amen amen
[29:57] let us be glad
[30:00] and rejoice and give honor to him for
[30:03] the marriage of the lamb has come amen
[30:05] and his wife have made herself ready
[30:09] and to her was granted that she should
[30:11] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[30:13] for fine linen is the righteousness of
[30:16] saints
[30:17] and he saith unto me right blessed are
[30:19] they which are called or can we say
[30:21] we're blessed this morning amen just
[30:24] lift a hand if you would this morning
[30:25] and say thank you lord i am blessed that
[30:28] you have called me
[30:31] blessed are they which are called into
[30:33] the marriage supper of the lamb and he
[30:34] said unto me
[30:36] these are the true sayings of god
[30:40] heavenly father just asking you to come
[30:41] lord we come
[30:43] father not in our own name not in our
[30:45] own ability but father we come as sons

[30:55] us and father that you made a way from
[30:58] before the foundation of the world lord
[31:00] for us to stand today to lift our voices

[31:09] voice that is shouting out hallelujah to

[31:16] glory to you father lord i want to make
[31:19] sure lord jesus that i add my voice to
[31:22] those who give praise to you

[31:26] lord i say i question lord jesus the
[31:30] terms that people use of the silent
[31:32] majority
[31:33] lord you did not call your people to be
[31:36] silent but you called for your people to
[31:39] lift their voices to the heavens lord we
[31:42] come today and add our voices to that
[31:44] great chorus lord
[31:46] we thank you for the opportunity today

[31:54] those countries lord around afghanistan

[32:05] is a passive aggressive in some ways
[32:07] lord it's below the surface and no one
[32:09] sees it but yet father is those that
[32:11] were lined in the street the other day
[32:13] and massacred lord it is a very vocal
[32:16] time
[32:17] lord we just ask you father steal their
[32:20] hearts lord give strength to them let
[32:23] their confessions remain true and
[32:25] faithful in this great time of
[32:27] persecution we ask now lord that you
[32:30] would come for father we live in a place
[32:32] a time a season a nation
[32:35] where the persecution might not be open
[32:38] but father it is here
[32:41] lord a society more and more looks down
[32:44] upon christianity looks down upon your
[32:46] word
[32:47] father let us stand our trial might be
[32:50] different lord it might be prosperity it
[32:53] might be popularity it might be a
[32:55] multitude of things but lord let us also
[32:58] stand steady and faithful and true
[33:00] in your name we pray today amen you may
[33:04] be seated
[33:10] i have always felt
[33:12] that revelation 19 was a great
[33:16] magnification of all the word of god
[33:18] because as we'll look at this we will
[33:21] see as we come in those early verses
[33:23] there he says that he has judged the
[33:25] great and my brother and sister as
[33:28] we look in the word today we can
[33:30] identify it the scripture so clearly
[33:32] identifies who the great of
[33:34] revelation will be but it is nothing
[33:37] more than an earthly magnification of
[33:39] that antichrist spirit which is satan
[33:42] himself and so as it comes that satan
[33:44] himself would come in such a way he does
[33:47] not come you know as they often depict
[33:50] him uh with horns and a pitchfork and
[33:53] and uh you know a scary image he
[33:55] actually comes in the very beauty of the
[33:57] world that we live in he he comes in the
[34:00] finery and the riches and the comfort
[34:03] he comes to bring a scenario or a
[34:07] picture to people that attracts them and
[34:09] my brother and sister it's only later as
[34:12] it is the ravages of life that come upon
[34:15] people
[34:16] that he chose shows his true nature so
[34:19] it's there that he comes in such a
[34:22] fashion that well you know we look at
[34:24] this and i think if we are honest with
[34:26] ourselves that we all
[34:29] enjoy a degree of comfort or would like
[34:31] to enjoy a degree of comfort in our
[34:33] lives and i'm talking in the natural
[34:35] sense we we want to be able to to feel a
[34:39] degree of security a home and you know
[34:43] food clothes etc etc but you see my
[34:46] brother and sister to move beyond that
[34:49] satan
[34:50] he's always trying to project an image
[34:53] of something greater something of more
[34:55] value of something but in the end of the
[34:58] day those things that are outside of the
[35:01] word of god those things that are
[35:03] outside of the calling of god are our
[35:07] vanity and uh it's so so satan would
[35:10] present his image he paints his story uh
[35:13] you know the handsome man the beautiful
[35:15] woman the nice car house clothes all
[35:17] these kind of things but ultimately all
[35:20] those are just a substitute uh for what
[35:23] god intended for us and that was to have
[35:25] christ in our heart and have peace and
[35:27] comfort and joy in the lord amen so we
[35:30] try to fill those things you know we we
[35:33] have a
[35:34] things that happen in our life and and
[35:37] if we're not careful uh you know you
[35:39] might you might take something and use
[35:41] that to comfort yourself when god
[35:43] intended for his word to be our comfort
[35:46] and so as we look at this today we uh
[35:49] look at this in revelations 19 and we
[35:53] see this whole picture when it comes
[35:55] down to the end because you see my
[35:57] brother and sister it's not how well the
[35:59] project starts it's how well it is
[36:01] finished the building of a house might
[36:03] have a perfect foundation it might be
[36:06] framed correctly have beautiful
[36:08] appliances and amenities but if it
[36:10] doesn't have a good roof
[36:13] then it's only a matter of time before
[36:15] all that you have has crumbled in so the
[36:17] finish of the project as it were
[36:21] the very touch that
[36:22] is completing it is the thing that
[36:25] matters and we'll look and how see that
[36:28] satan here is exposed he stands judged i
[36:31] say thank you lord amen but look what
[36:35] the gist or the main thing of this
[36:37] scripture is and that is the lamb is
[36:39] exalted
[36:40] the lamb is glorified and that's what
[36:43] you and i were called to do my brother
[36:45] and sister you see it's not someone else
[36:48] that is that voice that is lifting up
[36:50] alleluia to the lord it is you and i
[36:52] don't look at it as someone else
[36:54] somewhere else but it is you and i that
[36:57] is called to lift our voice in this day
[36:59] and it is not something that's just
[37:01] going to happen once we have
[37:03] the other side living amen but it is to
[37:07] start here here is our training ground
[37:09] here is the place that you might say we
[37:12] practice and perfect our worship it's
[37:14] not that we're by divine revelation
[37:17] gonna go in a rapture and stand before
[37:19] the throne of god and suddenly know how
[37:21] to worship god wants you to learn it
[37:23] right here he wants you to learn it
[37:24] right now he wants you to learn to lift
[37:27] your voice to him right now amen and so
[37:30] it's there as we see this the lamb being
[37:33] exalted the lamb being glorified and i
[37:36] say lord help me to just lift my voice
[37:39] more often you know we all have a choice
[37:41] you can have a bad day my brother and
[37:43] sister and you can have a choice to
[37:45] become part of the moment and say oh
[37:48] this is just the worst day ever you know
[37:50] we have our joke around the farm this is
[37:52] the worst this is the worst but my
[37:54] brother and sister there is nothing on
[37:57] this earth that can be the worst unless
[37:59] it is us forsaking the word of god
[38:02] that is the worst
[38:04] everything else is a circumstance
[38:06] ecclesiastes says it happens to the rich
[38:09] and to the poor and to the righteous and
[38:11] to the unrighteous amen so don't confuse
[38:14] the circumstances of life
[38:16] with what is good and bad
[38:19] now in verse 8 we see that the bride
[38:23] now i i hope you can catch this
[38:25] you see the bride
[38:28] was granted
[38:30] see didn't just naturally come by this
[38:32] she didn't just because she claimed to
[38:34] be a christian she did this but this was
[38:37] almighty god granting to her
[38:40] the right my brother and sister to be
[38:43] arrayed and fine linen this is god
[38:45] saying you know what i'm giving to you
[38:48] this portion of me
[38:50] now my brother and sister we we don't
[38:52] want to get confused when we talk about
[38:54] the word now we have the word as we call
[38:56] it our bible here in print but it is the
[39:00] living word that is jesus christ amen so
[39:03] people say well we have the word and
[39:06] they're holding their bible we have the
[39:08] word but until this becomes living it is
[39:12] not the word in us
[39:14] and so the gospel without the power and
[39:17] demonstration of almighty god is a book
[39:20] that was published
[39:21] and can be bought
[39:23] but when it becomes a living word in us
[39:28] is when we become the living epistles of
[39:31] jesus christ read of all men
[39:34] oh lord let me be something to be read
[39:37] i want to as it were be published lord
[39:40] that my neighbor my friend my family can
[39:43] see the word of god in me
[39:47] amen not just my testimony not just my
[39:50] words that i'm a christian but let them
[39:53] be able to read it and see it and then
[39:56] themselves become a testimony that this
[39:59] person is different
[40:02] hallelujah we don't want to be different
[40:03] as in strange right
[40:05] we want to be different because we're
[40:07] not of this world
[40:09] so you look at this it was granted
[40:13] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[40:16] clean and white for fine linen is a
[40:18] righteousness of saints and so it is
[40:22] that she has been granted now
[40:25] to be arrayed
[40:27] in a fine linen now my brother and
[40:30] sister
[40:31] the
[40:32] linen the righteousness of saints god
[40:34] choosing look what it is now we know
[40:37] that righteousness is only of god
[40:40] right no man can be righteous of his own
[40:42] nature of his own character of his own
[40:44] word but righteousness is of the lord
[40:46] and so god says i'm gonna let you i'm
[40:49] gonna grant to you the ability to
[40:52] display my righteousness
[40:56] it is not you displaying what church you
[40:58] go to or display an ideology but it is
[41:02] been granted to us to display the very
[41:05] life of jesus christ
[41:08] and the scripture says if you're ashamed
[41:10] of me i'll be ashamed of you but you see
[41:13] if we're ashamed we don't truly have the
[41:16] cloak or the arraignment of
[41:18] righteousness because righteousness
[41:20] changes in nature from our nature to his
[41:24] nature and he was not ashamed of you
[41:30] he said man we've got these people
[41:32] they're just a bunch of sinners
[41:34] can i just put god's words into my words
[41:36] for you this morning
[41:39] these bunch of sinners
[41:41] nobody really wants them
[41:44] but i do
[41:47] and every deficiency oh here's the list
[41:52] i don't care because my blood
[41:55] that's right takes that away
[41:59] everyone else says oh she ought to be
[42:01] stoned and he said good
[42:03] either without sin go ahead and throw
[42:05] the first stone why because he knew no
[42:08] one could undo that list but he himself
[42:12] and so he come to this bride in this
[42:15] generation actually through the ages but
[42:17] here we live in 2021 he come to this
[42:20] bride in this age and said don't be
[42:22] afraid i have already taken care of all
[42:26] of this i've already eliminated get this
[42:30] those that can throw a stone at you
[42:32] now look at the human nature are we
[42:34] humans
[42:36] don't you like that when you go online
[42:37] and you're trying to take care of
[42:38] business and i'm not too bright i'm
[42:40] sorry i hate to admit that but i get on
[42:43] there and then this thing pops up on the
[42:45] screen and it's like
[42:47] are you a human
[42:48] of course i'm a human
[42:52] so we enter this code and it's got all
[42:54] these weird numbers and letters at
[42:56] different angles and i'm just like
[42:59] ah
[43:01] is the sixth first or the seven
[43:04] the tail of the seven sticks out further
[43:07] in my mind that means it's first
[43:09] but it never works
[43:12] i call my wife my daughter and sadly
[43:14] enough even my granddaughter
[43:16] help me and they go in there
[43:18] okay there you go
[43:24] you see
[43:26] what i can't figure out
[43:30] he said i've already taken it and those
[43:32] of you have a little complex are are we
[43:35] humans
[43:36] okay let's all here real
[43:38] quick we're humans
[43:42] why do we care
[43:44] come on saints
[43:45] why
[43:46] do we care
[43:48] about the one standing off to the side
[43:50] with a stone amen that's exactly right
[43:53] why do we care about them
[43:57] they are already bound by the spirit of
[44:00] god
[44:01] we see it in this world well they say
[44:03] and they this and this person forget it
[44:06] my brother and sister they can't judge
[44:08] you because they are not without sin
[44:10] because if they were without sin they
[44:12] would be praying for you not throwing
[44:14] stones at you
[44:18] so those that are carrying as it were
[44:20] sin in their life and they want to just
[44:21] throw stones in every which direction
[44:23] usually it's because they're carrying a
[44:25] complex of their own
[44:27] maybe god's dealing with them and they
[44:29] simply just don't want to repent they
[44:31] don't like the fact that they see you
[44:33] moved by the spirit of god they see you
[44:36] coming under the influence of the holy
[44:38] spirit and they see you repenting and
[44:40] changing your life and they don't like
[44:42] that because they can't seem to come
[44:44] there
[44:45] so don't worry about that guy that's
[44:46] caught the stone or the gal it's got the
[44:48] stone over here they have nothing to do
[44:50] with you
[44:52] nothing at all to do with you
[44:54] so she's been granted to display the
[44:57] righteousness of god
[44:59] now i want you to think about that my
[45:01] brother and sister that is not no small
[45:03] thing to be granted
[45:05] to display the righteousness of god
[45:08] amen remember what the scripture says
[45:10] about earth and vessels now he will not
[45:12] put new wine which is the holy spirit in
[45:15] an old dirty
[45:16] vessel and so when god poured his spirit
[45:19] into you that's because he knew he had
[45:22] washed you sufficiently the water of the
[45:25] word had come in such a fashion that it
[45:28] went down into the deepest innermost
[45:31] things of your life where you might say
[45:33] this happened to me when i was a young
[45:35] man or a young woman and i've just never
[45:37] been able to get over that get over it
[45:39] get up to the altar amen to the word
[45:42] come in his presence let him wash you
[45:44] because he wants to pour himself into
[45:47] you
[45:48] amen this is not a matter of oh i attend
[45:51] church or i do this or i do that this is
[45:54] that personal relationship where we have
[45:56] experienced you know i always like to
[45:59] liken this and then bless my bless my
[46:01] grandmother but as a child you know she
[46:04] just come from a generation you know and
[46:06] we'd go spend nights at her house and
[46:08] and you know some people say oh that's
[46:10] just must have been awkward as a child
[46:12] but my granny you know you'd be in the
[46:14] bathtub and then she'd say okay i'm
[46:16] coming in there
[46:18] and she'd come and she had what looked
[46:20] like a brillo pad
[46:21] and she said put them elbows up here
[46:23] because no grandchild of mine is going
[46:25] in public with dirty elbows
[46:27] and she'd scrub them things to where it
[46:29] wasn't a grandchild going in public with
[46:31] dirty elbows as a grandchild going in
[46:33] public with bright red buffed elbows
[46:35] amen but she knew what it took to get
[46:38] the dirt off
[46:41] she knew that it wasn't a casual little
[46:43] bit of soap and a little buffing of a
[46:45] washcloth was going to do it she knew
[46:47] exactly what it'd do to take that off of
[46:49] there and my brother and sister the holy
[46:51] spirit knows exactly i don't care what
[46:54] struggles we're had in the past what
[46:56] struggles you're having right now god
[46:57] knows exactly how to come and to buff us
[47:01] clean
[47:02] oh can someone say thank you lord
[47:05] oh it might be a little complex or it
[47:07] might be a very serious matter but god
[47:09] knows what he's doing
[47:11] hallelujah but this my brother and
[47:12] sister
[47:13] is i i hope i can make emphasis of this
[47:16] as the lord was just speaking to me that
[47:19] we can recognize what a privilege
[47:22] amen can i emphasize that like down in
[47:24] the south this is a privilege
[47:31] to manifest
[47:32] the life
[47:34] of jesus christ
[47:37] none of this woe unto me i'm a christian
[47:39] but glory hallelujah god saw fit to make
[47:42] me part of this great plan god saw fit
[47:45] to let me come and be magnified
[47:49] oh my brother and sister be magnified
[47:52] you see what god is doing god could come
[47:54] down today and he come down in their
[47:57] midst we'll touch it on a quote here in
[47:58] a little bit but you see god come down
[48:00] in their midst and because they did not
[48:03] know the word they did not recognize him
[48:06] now these were people who studied the
[48:08] word every single day of their life but
[48:11] they still didn't know the word
[48:13] the word
[48:14] was a
[48:16] intellectual
[48:18] conception
[48:22] the messiah is coming
[48:24] and when he comes
[48:27] he's going to do this
[48:30] and then the sadducees come up and said
[48:32] no no no no
[48:34] when he comes he's going to do this
[48:38] and sanhedrin said you're both wrong
[48:41] when he comes he's going to do this
[48:44] and the independent thinker says no
[48:48] according to my studies when he comes
[48:50] he's going to do this
[48:52] and what did they do they built upon
[48:54] what they thought
[48:57] but if they had known
[48:59] i hope you catch this if they had known
[49:02] the word amen they would have known him
[49:06] amen
[49:11] hallelujah
[49:12] reminds me of the time
[49:16] policeman pulled over a man
[49:18] for driving excessively fast
[49:21] comes up he says sir do you realize
[49:23] you're going 85 and a 55 and he says yes
[49:26] and he says well i'm going to give you a
[49:27] ticket he said i'll have you to know i'm
[49:29] friends with the governor
[49:31] and the policeman stood there a minute
[49:33] and said you're friends with the
[49:34] governor i am friends with the governor
[49:38] is the governor
[49:40] your friend
[49:44] see this is the problem
[49:49] if we know
[49:51] the word
[49:52] then the word
[49:54] knows us
[49:58] never a one-sided relationship
[50:00] always
[50:01] always
[50:02] so what is it my brother and sister you
[50:04] see as we read revelation 19 god
[50:06] choosing to display his righteousness in
[50:09] his
[50:10] bride because he arrayed her in fine
[50:12] linen which is the righteousness of
[50:14] saints so god is magnifying himself now
[50:16] who is it my brother and sister i uh
[50:19] don't be too critical of me this morning
[50:21] in in my in my vocabulary because my
[50:23] mind is just jumbling along here but you
[50:26] see my brother and sister uh the word of
[50:28] god never said that christ himself would
[50:31] come down in this day as it were himself
[50:34] as he walked on the shores of galilee
[50:36] doesn't say he's going to come now and
[50:38] walk on this earth as that man right no
[50:42] place in scripture to speak to that but
[50:44] the scripture speaks over and over again
[50:46] how he would come in this generation now
[50:49] where is he at
[50:50] where's he at saints come on think about
[50:53] it amen he come to magnify himself in
[50:58] his bride and he said when i magnify
[51:01] myself in her because i am righteous
[51:04] she's going to be cloaked in
[51:06] righteousness she's not going to be
[51:09] walking independent just hoping she's
[51:11] making it he said this work i began in
[51:14] you i'm going to finish and what was
[51:16] that he started out when god first
[51:18] started do you remember when god first
[51:20] started to deal with you hey man he
[51:22] started to touch your heart you started
[51:23] to realize that a bottle at dance hall
[51:26] at this or that out here was not the
[51:28] answer to my problem and what did god do
[51:31] he started actually at that time
[51:33] wrapping that cloak
[51:35] of righteousness
[51:37] around you
[51:39] now we just think it's done no sir
[51:42] no sir god's working on you and i
[51:44] working on us worked on me this morning
[51:46] a little bit amen i felt the robe coming
[51:49] a little farther around my life this
[51:51] morning i hope you can say the same
[51:53] thing i hope you walk away from here
[51:55] today knowing and and having that i'm
[51:57] not talking about feeling as an emotion
[51:59] but feeling the presence of god the
[52:02] cloak of righteousness coming around us
[52:04] once again because that's god's
[52:06] expression of him in you
[52:09] amen because his word is not producing a
[52:11] people that just run and shout i'm okay
[52:14] with that some people get nervous i'm
[52:16] good with that my brother and sister but
[52:18] that doesn't mean that the cloak is
[52:19] around us that's right amen it doesn't
[52:22] mean that we're walking in the presence
[52:24] of god we can speak in tongues and that
[52:26] doesn't prove it because there's all
[52:28] kinds of nonsense goes with people
[52:30] speaking in tongues that when that cloak
[52:32] of righteousness makes its complete
[52:35] wrath around the bride of jesus christ
[52:38] she then is a complete magnification on
[52:42] this earth of jesus christ himself
[52:46] hallelujah
[52:50] not a chino right
[52:53] we're not just christians in name only
[52:54] there's got to be a life
[52:56] that backs it up
[52:58] i've shared with you the the pentecostal
[53:00] preacher that that i kind of like to
[53:03] listen to once in a while he's getting
[53:04] quite old now doesn't preach too much
[53:06] but um i just remember a time that he's
[53:08] standing in a convention a house to be
[53:11] thousands great big uh great big
[53:13] coliseum type building i think it
[53:15] actually was a church but just huge
[53:17] thousands of people in there and and he
[53:19] comes and he just starts in now look
[53:21] under the upc my brother and sister
[53:23] speaking in tongues is the evidence
[53:26] right but here's a man that says look
[53:28] i've spoken tongues and i believe it's
[53:29] important and and god bless him for that
[53:32] opinion that thought amen but he says
[53:34] what i'm expecting what i'm expecting is
[53:37] those of you that have spoken tongues
[53:39] you have spoken tongues and boy hands
[53:40] just the whole building is nothing but
[53:42] hands i expect to see a life
[53:44] out of you
[53:46] well i'll tell you what hands went down
[53:48] people got quiet
[53:50] you see it's not just some outward
[53:51] display but it is the cloak of
[53:55] righteousness
[53:58] amen
[53:59] it has to be around us because here we
[54:02] see this manifestation of the word right
[54:05] we do believe that the word must come to
[54:07] pass right
[54:08] amen so god is choosing to display his
[54:10] righteousness in his bride amen
[54:15] easy enough to understand god as
[54:17] righteous right
[54:20] we serve a righteous god
[54:22] he's holy
[54:26] but when it comes to us
[54:28] it gets a little more difficult doesn't
[54:29] it
[54:35] sure glad our thoughts aren't projected
[54:37] sometimes because my inner voice is just
[54:40] tearing me up
[54:43] i don't think any of us would have to go
[54:45] back very far
[54:47] to remember
[54:48] our last mistake
[54:53] we don't have to
[54:55] maybe even the devil climbed in the car
[54:57] on the way to church with us i don't
[54:58] know
[55:04] and we're going to spend the rest of the
[55:05] service thinking about that mistake
[55:13] unless of course you recognize
[55:16] that cloaked in his righteousness
[55:22] you know my wife didn't even know what i
[55:24] was preaching this morning but she's
[55:25] wandering around the house
[55:27] what's in
[55:30] what's him
[55:35] i can't sing the proper verse because i
[55:39] sing it to the home of the tractor and
[55:40] it comes out differently
[55:44] but you see
[55:45] let's not get confused about being
[55:47] cloaked in god's righteousness
[55:49] and this flesh
[55:51] being perfect
[55:52] that's right
[55:53] the devil wants you to move
[55:56] from the cloak of righteousness
[55:58] to the cloak of
[56:00] our tradition
[56:02] of righteousness
[56:04] our version of righteousness is the
[56:06] pious man now look my brother and sister
[56:08] brother branham says that that those uh
[56:11] was the kind of priest they they thought
[56:13] jesus was off the rails he he was there
[56:16] plating a rope and beating them out of
[56:18] the temple and doing all of these things
[56:20] and here was the kind old priest who had
[56:23] paid their medical bill and helped pay
[56:24] their rent and encourage them and so
[56:27] they viewed jesus as being the radical
[56:30] and the kind old priest who is actually
[56:32] deceiving them by tradition
[56:36] as the one that had righteousness
[56:42] isn't that interesting
[56:46] we would have such a view
[56:49] now look at this
[56:52] see god's word which is christ
[56:54] magnified amen fulfill the promise of
[56:57] this day in this great hour of
[56:59] resurrection notice it gives them joy
[57:01] this talk about the bride of christ now
[57:04] gives them joy to know that we are with
[57:06] him a flesh of his flesh a bone of his
[57:08] bone what a joy that's the only thing
[57:10] that a real believer cares about
[57:13] you see now i'm not talking about we
[57:15] live a double life right
[57:18] but i'm telling you if you focus
[57:20] on your mistake you'll walk out of here
[57:23] today thinking about whatever mistake
[57:25] you made today or last night and we
[57:27] should walk out of here with the
[57:29] revelation and a joy in our heart that
[57:32] god said i have wrapped my cloak of
[57:35] righteousness around you and i am not
[57:38] even to hold now why would he say in his
[57:40] scriptures that he won't even hold our
[57:42] sin to our account that's it if we had
[57:44] no sin
[57:46] that's right amen
[57:48] but i'm a believer i'm a believer now
[57:50] i'm sorry
[57:52] i'm sorry do you know that fear is a sin
[57:56] and i run into a lot of people
[57:58] they're afraid of coven
[58:00] we hear all kinds of things
[58:03] oh they give you the shot and they can
[58:05] put a magnet on there they give you the
[58:06] shot they can track you now they give
[58:08] you the shot they can now give something
[58:10] else and you'll catch that disease they
[58:12] did all this stuff what is it my brother
[58:13] and sister it's fear
[58:15] you realize my brother and sister as we
[58:18] look at the word of god to reach into a
[58:20] fire and have a venomous snake latch
[58:23] onto you and you grab that snake and
[58:26] cast it away and claim your healing in
[58:29] the name of jesus christ we have
[58:31] scriptural example
[58:33] and if god did it for one man god is
[58:35] obligated to do it for you if god ever
[58:38] forgave one man of his sins he's
[58:39] obligated to forgive you god ever healed
[58:42] one man he's obligated to heal you
[58:44] because i am god and i change not
[58:47] amen so god doesn't play some kind of
[58:49] double standard like we do
[58:53] we're having this family over honey just
[58:55] throw out a couple biscuits and uh
[58:57] triscuit and
[58:58] that'll be fine oh we're having these
[59:00] over oh my we gotta get this get this
[59:03] run to the store get this get this get
[59:05] this
[59:07] come on that's right
[59:09] come on
[59:10] i kept it simple like that because as
[59:12] message believers food is our fellowship
[59:14] circle
[59:19] have you ever noticed that right that's
[59:21] why we're all fat
[59:25] we're going to have a fellowship
[59:28] yeah
[59:31] amen
[59:33] so look
[59:34] coming to
[59:36] revelation is how i'm going to put this
[59:38] coming to revelation it gives them joy
[59:40] to know that we are with him flesh of
[59:44] his flesh and bone of his bone look my
[59:46] brother and sister when a man
[59:48] we're talking about in in a scriptural
[59:51] spiritual fashion when a man takes his
[59:53] wife she then becomes his identity amen
[59:57] amen
[59:58] and i don't care how nice the man might
[1:00:00] be right
[1:00:03] if is
[1:00:04] oh are we allowed to use these kind of
[1:00:06] words in church
[1:00:08] if she's a snark
[1:00:12] then the image in the community is
[1:00:15] that family
[1:00:16] are snarks
[1:00:19] well it goes both ways
[1:00:23] we're talking in a spiritual fashion
[1:00:25] so what is it then the identity of the
[1:00:29] husband is identified in the character
[1:00:31] of the wife that he takes
[1:00:34] oh are you with me are you following me
[1:00:36] this morning and so god come along and
[1:00:38] said you know what i knew i know who i
[1:00:41] chose for a wife i know who i chose for
[1:00:44] a bride and i'm gonna wrap my cloak of
[1:00:46] righteousness around her and then she is
[1:00:50] now not identified as herself she is
[1:00:53] identified as me
[1:00:56] oh hallelujah under this traditional now
[1:00:58] people do whatever they want to do when
[1:01:00] it comes to names and i understand
[1:01:02] cultures and don't misunderstand this
[1:01:04] but my brother and sister you know when
[1:01:06] a woman in this day and age gets married
[1:01:08] and keeps her own name well i i
[1:01:11] personally this am i allowed to express
[1:01:13] opinions
[1:01:15] when a woman gets married and won't take
[1:01:17] her husband's name i think it's a bigger
[1:01:19] deeper issue than just a cultural thing
[1:01:25] because we have now my brother and
[1:01:26] sister even in the day that we're living
[1:01:28] spiritually and it is there that the
[1:01:31] thing is is what we want and we see it
[1:01:34] in scripture right we will seven women
[1:01:36] taking one man we'll keep our own name
[1:01:40] amen
[1:01:42] we'll keep our own identity
[1:01:46] oh they take the name of jesus christ
[1:01:48] but they really have kept their own
[1:01:50] name that's exactly right
[1:01:53] i've seen a wedding
[1:01:56] jerry jerry and i was talking about this
[1:01:59] just a memory we were remembering
[1:02:02] that was coming come back to us and
[1:02:05] and uh
[1:02:06] oh can i tell little
[1:02:08] back story you know i i drive around not
[1:02:10] that i really i'm not expecting to move
[1:02:13] or anything like that but it's kind of a
[1:02:14] little family joke we drive along and
[1:02:17] we're like
[1:02:18] oh that is a very nice church we'll
[1:02:20] claim that
[1:02:23] it's got grass for our young people and
[1:02:25] adequate parking and
[1:02:27] signs already up that say you can't park
[1:02:29] here
[1:02:31] and
[1:02:32] uh anyway we're driving along and jerry
[1:02:36] goes why don't you claim that church and
[1:02:38] i said oh and she goes well you've
[1:02:39] already been in it and i was like i have
[1:02:41] and then she starts describing
[1:02:44] and it was a wedding and the the
[1:02:46] minister comes down to the very end of
[1:02:48] the wedding and and
[1:02:50] he says i
[1:02:52] uh pronounce you man and wife and
[1:02:54] whatnot and now i introduce you
[1:02:57] and
[1:02:58] he has the man's first name right but
[1:03:02] entirely different last name
[1:03:07] and i think in the church the preacher
[1:03:09] was the only one that didn't figure it
[1:03:11] out
[1:03:12] everybody's like
[1:03:14] the bride and groom are looking at each
[1:03:15] other
[1:03:16] you know my brother and sister we we're
[1:03:18] not
[1:03:19] going to keep a different name we're not
[1:03:21] going to be identified over that
[1:03:23] we are the bride of jesus christ
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:27] we're not bride of first nazarene we're
[1:03:29] not bride of first methodists we're not
[1:03:32] bright of whatever we are the bride of
[1:03:35] jesus christ
[1:03:37] amen and so to be identified in him is
[1:03:40] very important to us right i don't want
[1:03:42] another name i don't want somebody
[1:03:44] attaching another name to me
[1:03:47] amen so now in first corinthians the
[1:03:50] first chapter uh verse 21 he says for
[1:03:52] after after that in the wisdom of god
[1:03:55] the world by wisdom knew not god so we
[1:03:57] understand that he says by the he'd hide
[1:03:59] it from the wise and prudent
[1:04:01] it pleased god by the foolishness of
[1:04:03] preaching and i can say amen nobody else
[1:04:05] has to even say amen i'll say amen to
[1:04:07] this
[1:04:07] foolishness of preaching to save them
[1:04:09] but believe for the jews require a sign
[1:04:12] and the greeks seek after wisdom but we
[1:04:15] preach christ crucified
[1:04:18] unto the jews of stumbling block and
[1:04:20] unto the greeks foolishness but unto
[1:04:22] them which are
[1:04:26] both jews and greeks christ the power of
[1:04:29] god and the wisdom of god now look at
[1:04:32] this when we look at this and and the
[1:04:34] expression uh christ the power of god
[1:04:38] this brings us back again to the gospel
[1:04:40] my brother and sister we can preach the
[1:04:42] bible we can do a lot of things but if
[1:04:44] there is no power behind it we can
[1:04:47] recount these things we can read them it
[1:04:49] can becomes a liturgy
[1:04:52] and or the doxology
[1:04:55] and we just speak this reminds me on a
[1:04:58] plane flight one time
[1:05:01] amen we
[1:05:03] literally got into such turbulence that
[1:05:05] the
[1:05:06] the cart in the center
[1:05:08] the announcement comes over and says
[1:05:10] stewardesses sit down and the carts
[1:05:12] start rattling against things and the
[1:05:14] stewardess and i don't say this be crass
[1:05:16] but up a few chairs in front of us this
[1:05:18] stewardess just literally sits down in
[1:05:20] this gentleman's lap and he's a little
[1:05:22] shocked but you know all of a sudden the
[1:05:24] cart's rattling back and forth in this
[1:05:26] big old jumbo jet that we're on we're
[1:05:28] not on some little thing big old jumbo
[1:05:29] jet just starts flopping around and
[1:05:32] across the aisle from us faster than you
[1:05:35] could draw a gun in the wild west this
[1:05:37] lady had out her rosary and she's there
[1:05:40] muttering to herself
[1:05:42] now she might have walked away and said
[1:05:43] oh praise god god heard me but my
[1:05:46] brother and sister the word of god so
[1:05:48] i'm not i'm not defaming the catholics
[1:05:50] but the word of god clearly says that
[1:05:52] these things of repetitious nature is
[1:05:55] not what god is into god is in that
[1:05:58] personal relationship where we
[1:06:00] identified as his wife and when she
[1:06:04] speaks he listens
[1:06:06] amen not not to do that and we have oh
[1:06:09] i'm not going to go in depth this
[1:06:10] morning but we have very similar
[1:06:13] traditions showing up
[1:06:19] absolutely
[1:06:20] imagine yes sir
[1:06:22] but the foolishness of god
[1:06:24] is wiser than men and the weakness of
[1:06:26] god is stronger than men
[1:06:29] for
[1:06:30] ye see your calling brethren how that
[1:06:32] not many wise men after the flesh and
[1:06:34] not many mighty or not many noble are
[1:06:36] called but god had chosen the foolish
[1:06:39] things of the world to confound the wise
[1:06:41] and god has chosen the weak things of
[1:06:43] the world to confound uh things which
[1:06:46] are mighty now i want to expand on that
[1:06:48] for a minute the moment that you say i
[1:06:51] can do this
[1:06:53] you're right here in this scripture
[1:06:55] you're placing yourself mightier than
[1:06:58] your position as a wife in other words i
[1:07:01] don't need a husband to fix this for me
[1:07:03] i don't need to consult i don't need to
[1:07:05] share i don't need to ask i don't need
[1:07:07] to appeal to i can do this
[1:07:11] that's not what god said god said you
[1:07:14] know what the wife now you can take this
[1:07:16] natural take it spiritual the wife is
[1:07:18] the weaker vessel so she doesn't need to
[1:07:20] go as it were into the gym and start
[1:07:23] pumping iron because i'm going to show
[1:07:24] my husband that i can plow the field i
[1:07:27] can build the house i can do this i can
[1:07:29] lead the family
[1:07:32] amen
[1:07:34] no
[1:07:35] amen well i hope that didn't hurt
[1:07:44] you see
[1:07:46] he's chosen the weak
[1:07:50] he's looking for a wife that says lord i
[1:07:53] i tried once
[1:07:55] did you ever try to put that cloak of
[1:07:56] righteousness on
[1:07:59] i tried once and i found out lord the
[1:08:02] cloak is much greater than i am
[1:08:04] i i cannot i cannot wrap this cloak
[1:08:08] around myself
[1:08:12] remember the little story about the man
[1:08:13] coming to the lord and saying lord i i
[1:08:15] can't bear this cross
[1:08:17] any longer
[1:08:19] i said okay come over here open the door
[1:08:22] take it in there leave it come on out
[1:08:24] they walk down a hallway and down a
[1:08:26] hallway and turn a corner and walk in a
[1:08:27] door
[1:08:28] go in there
[1:08:30] and choose a cross
[1:08:31] and he walks through the room and walks
[1:08:33] through the room and walks through the
[1:08:34] room and he comes to a cross
[1:08:37] it's the smallest cross in the room and
[1:08:38] he picks it up
[1:08:40] and he says this is the cross i want to
[1:08:41] bear
[1:08:43] and he says that
[1:08:44] was the cross that you deposited here
[1:08:50] see we can't wrap this cloak of
[1:08:53] righteousness
[1:08:54] around us it's just far too great for us
[1:08:57] to do
[1:08:59] it's more than we are capable amen
[1:09:03] and there's a reason look at this
[1:09:05] but god has chosen the foolish things of
[1:09:07] the world to confound the wise and god
[1:09:09] has chosen the weak things of the world
[1:09:11] to confound the things which are mighty
[1:09:13] and base things of the world and things
[1:09:14] which are despised hath god chosen ye
[1:09:17] and the things which are not to bring to
[1:09:19] not those things that are
[1:09:22] that
[1:09:23] no flesh
[1:09:25] i have this enlarged torah it takes up
[1:09:27] the whole page that no flesh
[1:09:30] can glory in his
[1:09:32] presence that we could come to the place
[1:09:35] that in everything in our life we are
[1:09:37] calling out to him lord lord i need you
[1:09:40] lord i need you to guide me this is why
[1:09:42] words of encouragement come over and
[1:09:45] over again get up in the morning ask the
[1:09:46] lord to lead you and guide you and
[1:09:48] protect you and you do that what you're
[1:09:50] doing you're telling him lord i'm
[1:09:51] submitting my day to you and i i don't
[1:09:54] want to be the one that has the answers
[1:09:56] for my day lord i want you to have the
[1:09:58] answer for my day
[1:10:00] otherwise we could start to glory
[1:10:03] we start to tell ourselves that i'm a
[1:10:05] great christian i'm a strong christian i
[1:10:07] can do this
[1:10:08] isn't it amazing every time you even get
[1:10:10] an inkling of being that
[1:10:12] that a trial comes that shows you you
[1:10:14] know why because god loves you that's
[1:10:16] exactly god loves you so much it's like
[1:10:18] i'm not going to let you become fat head
[1:10:20] have you ever been called a fat head
[1:10:27] well i'll tell you what happens
[1:10:28] even if you didn't get called a fat head
[1:10:30] we become fat heads
[1:10:33] have you ever seen kids it's fun to
[1:10:35] watch kids
[1:10:38] there's a toy on the floor nobody's
[1:10:40] played with it for 30 minutes
[1:10:42] one kid goes over and picks it up and
[1:10:43] the other one comes
[1:10:45] stampeding over there and says that's
[1:10:47] mine and the other one says no that's
[1:10:49] mine and then they start a runkus with
[1:10:52] each other and almost always one gets in
[1:10:54] trouble and one goes away crying and the
[1:10:57] one who got in trouble
[1:11:00] he cries too right
[1:11:03] but he goes away with a little spark of
[1:11:06] knowledge
[1:11:08] i can take that away from him any time
[1:11:12] i want
[1:11:18] we've watched it for generations
[1:11:21] my own children
[1:11:23] your children
[1:11:25] yeah you children
[1:11:30] now what happens we carry that same kind
[1:11:32] of knowledge
[1:11:34] right up into adulthood that's it and we
[1:11:36] carry it right over into our spiritual
[1:11:40] experience
[1:11:41] and we can pray and say lord i rebuke
[1:11:44] the devil in your name and god comes on
[1:11:46] the scene and a little child with a
[1:11:48] fever gets up and goes off and plays
[1:11:51] something happens here something happens
[1:11:53] there and if we're not careful
[1:11:56] we get this little idea ah
[1:12:00] we
[1:12:01] meaning i that's right
[1:12:03] can take this away from the devil
[1:12:05] anytime i please
[1:12:08] but it's quite the opposite my brother
[1:12:09] and sister we in the flesh have no
[1:12:12] ability to deal with the devil
[1:12:15] but when we are wrapped in that cloak of
[1:12:18] righteousness it is no longer us it is
[1:12:21] god himself and you will find that a man
[1:12:23] or a woman wrapped in that cloak of
[1:12:25] righteousness will not have a religious
[1:12:27] spirit she will not have an attitude she
[1:12:30] will not think she is something she will
[1:12:32] recognize i am nothing without jesus
[1:12:36] christ in me i am nothing i have no
[1:12:38] strength amongst myself i have no
[1:12:40] ability in myself it all lies in christ
[1:12:45] himself and i can do oh get this now the
[1:12:49] depth of that scripture i can do all
[1:12:53] things
[1:12:54] oh sounds fat headed don't it but look
[1:12:57] at the identifier in christ jesus
[1:13:01] so what is it when i'm inside that cloak
[1:13:04] of righteousness i'm not afraid of the
[1:13:07] devil i'm not afraid of sickness i'm not
[1:13:09] afraid of the circumstances of the world
[1:13:11] but we get outside of that cloak my
[1:13:13] brother and sister we have no authority
[1:13:16] against the devil and he knows it
[1:13:18] but when you are inside that robe of
[1:13:21] righteousness
[1:13:22] wrapped in that fine linen of the word
[1:13:25] amen the devil knows and recognizes whoa
[1:13:28] i i might be able to get them and trip
[1:13:30] them once in a while but it's only
[1:13:32] because they've maybe put their foot
[1:13:34] outside
[1:13:36] amen
[1:13:37] because the word says as
[1:13:39] long as you're hiding
[1:13:41] in the tabernacle
[1:13:43] the devil can't touch you
[1:13:48] come on saints
[1:13:50] i want you to think about it
[1:13:52] amen god didn't want us to glory in
[1:13:55] ourself amen
[1:13:58] my a lot of thoughts i'll just keep to
[1:14:01] myself this morning
[1:14:03] now look we'll go in second corinthians
[1:14:05] 5 here as we just come pretty close to
[1:14:07] closing down here
[1:14:09] therefore if any man be
[1:14:12] what to say here
[1:14:14] come on not next to him not in the same
[1:14:16] building not on the same street not on
[1:14:18] the same continent
[1:14:20] not in the same religion
[1:14:24] he's got to be in christ here my brother
[1:14:26] and sister is the robe of righteousness
[1:14:30] and what is it when we as the bride are
[1:14:33] walking in that fine linen which is the
[1:14:36] righteousness of saints
[1:14:38] we're in it
[1:14:40] it's only in this generation that we
[1:14:42] live in that people's clothes clothes
[1:14:44] are on them and they're not in them
[1:14:48] i hope you follow that
[1:14:50] because i really don't want to have to
[1:14:52] explain that
[1:14:54] but we live in a generation that they
[1:14:55] think if they just have something on
[1:14:57] them that they're clothed
[1:15:00] and we probably won't go into the
[1:15:01] scripture here today but my brother and
[1:15:03] sister it is there that they don't think
[1:15:05] they're naked but revelation says they
[1:15:07] are naked and don't even know they're
[1:15:10] naked because the robe of righteousness
[1:15:13] they are not in it it's on them in other
[1:15:16] words it's a religious amen spirit
[1:15:20] a religious experience
[1:15:22] and they're not really in the robe of
[1:15:24] righteousness
[1:15:29] therefore if any man be
[1:15:31] in christ
[1:15:33] he is a new creature old things are
[1:15:34] passed away behold all things become new
[1:15:37] and all things are of god who hath
[1:15:39] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[1:15:42] and hath given us the ministry
[1:15:45] of reconciliation
[1:15:47] now i want you to catch this given us
[1:15:49] who is us
[1:15:51] yes us as you
[1:15:53] you as us
[1:15:57] where is the spirit then that shows up
[1:16:00] in the confines of the christian church
[1:16:03] that is constantly trying to bring
[1:16:05] separation
[1:16:07] trying to they don't see it like we do
[1:16:11] this don't like this now
[1:16:13] let's not mistake what i'm saying here
[1:16:16] for dealing with
[1:16:18] air in other words we don't let the wolf
[1:16:21] into the sheep pin because we don't want
[1:16:22] to offend the wolf that's it i've seen a
[1:16:26] cute little cartoon i i hope you can
[1:16:28] catch this see this in your mind
[1:16:30] and uh
[1:16:34] we're not here you know to to be kind to
[1:16:36] the devil you know that i see in this
[1:16:38] cute little cartoon it shows a wolf
[1:16:39] packing a sheep
[1:16:41] and he goes up to the mailbox opens it
[1:16:44] puts a letter in the mailbox closes it
[1:16:47] and walks off
[1:16:48] then here comes the shepherd
[1:16:50] you know
[1:16:51] bald head
[1:16:53] big beard robe staff comes to the
[1:16:55] mailbox opens it pulls out the letter
[1:16:58] opens the letter reads it and in there
[1:17:00] it just says i o
[1:17:04] e w e
[1:17:08] i o u
[1:17:11] only he's stolen
[1:17:12] the you
[1:17:15] but i owe you
[1:17:16] no my brother and sister this
[1:17:19] reconciliation
[1:17:20] is where you come and you say look
[1:17:23] brother sister
[1:17:25] what you're doing what you're saying is
[1:17:26] not the word take it back to the word
[1:17:28] where is it at in the word
[1:17:30] and they say i don't care it's
[1:17:31] revelation okay my brother and sister
[1:17:34] i'll just tell you talk to you as a
[1:17:35] pastor to a church
[1:17:37] we don't say it we've reserved these
[1:17:39] seats for you and you're welcome to go
[1:17:41] to every fellowship and have your own
[1:17:42] fellowships and spread your version
[1:17:45] see that's not reconciliation
[1:17:48] because you go into the scripture right
[1:17:50] by the foolishness of preaching my job
[1:17:52] or the ministry's job is to reconcile
[1:17:55] you back to the word
[1:17:56] not reconcile you to another ministry
[1:17:59] not reconcile you to somebody's ideology
[1:18:01] or somebody's thoughts but to reconcile
[1:18:04] you back to the word
[1:18:06] and so we should be praying for the
[1:18:07] spirit of reconciliation to be on us to
[1:18:10] come back to the word and unto others to
[1:18:12] come to the word
[1:18:14] amen did that make sense to you
[1:18:16] to wit that god was in christ
[1:18:18] reconciling the world unto himself not
[1:18:21] imputing their trespasses unto them
[1:18:23] thank you lord amen inside that robe of
[1:18:26] righteousness you are then not having
[1:18:29] any sin imputed to you if we're out here
[1:18:33] on our own we can look at the word and
[1:18:34] say oh he's not going to put any sin on
[1:18:36] me no you're covered in your own
[1:18:38] righteousness you're covered in your own
[1:18:40] work you have to be covered in his
[1:18:42] hallelujah right coming back to the
[1:18:44] mercy seat and the blood upon the ark
[1:18:46] and the blood upon the mercy seat amen
[1:18:48] it was not my brother and sister that we
[1:18:50] can flaunt that we will not be judged it
[1:18:53] is the fact that the mercy seat with the
[1:18:55] blood on it stands between you and the
[1:18:58] ark
[1:18:58] stands between you and judgment so we
[1:19:01] have to have the blood
[1:19:05] to with that god was in christ
[1:19:07] reconciling the world unto himself not
[1:19:09] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[1:19:11] half committed unto us the word of
[1:19:14] reconciliation
[1:19:16] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[1:19:20] do you know when an ambassador goes to
[1:19:21] another nation
[1:19:23] maybe he comes
[1:19:27] and he says our country is willing to do
[1:19:29] this for you
[1:19:31] under these terms and we agree to this
[1:19:34] do you know when that ambassador signs
[1:19:36] his name
[1:19:38] to that accord
[1:19:40] it's the same as our government that's
[1:19:42] right signing
[1:19:43] their name to that accord
[1:19:46] so do you realize that when we become
[1:19:48] ambassadors for christ
[1:19:51] come on get this now remember there's
[1:19:52] always two spirits in the framework of
[1:19:54] the church
[1:19:56] when we come as true ambassadors for
[1:19:58] christ
[1:20:00] we're actually signing christ's name in
[1:20:04] word and deed
[1:20:08] i don't mean to be negative but my
[1:20:10] brother and sister that's why so many
[1:20:12] people in this day and age
[1:20:14] don't even want anything to do with
[1:20:15] christianity because people have signed
[1:20:17] a lifestyle a behavior a conscious a
[1:20:21] moral value they've signed that in the
[1:20:23] name of christianity in the name of
[1:20:25] jesus christ
[1:20:26] and even the world out here can look at
[1:20:28] that and say that's bogus
[1:20:30] because they weren't true ambassadors
[1:20:32] let a true ambassador
[1:20:35] be a true representation
[1:20:38] of jesus christ
[1:20:40] as though god did beseech you by us we
[1:20:42] pray you and christ said
[1:20:44] be ye reconciled
[1:20:47] for he hath made him to be sin being
[1:20:49] reconciled to god but he has made him to
[1:20:52] be sin for us who knew no sin that we
[1:20:54] might be made
[1:20:56] the righteousness amen of god in him
[1:21:00] see here's our path coming god just
[1:21:02] didn't just throw it out there and say
[1:21:04] just claim righteousness and you're
[1:21:05] righteous you see he had a pathway he
[1:21:08] had a process for us
[1:21:10] hallelujah hallelujah boy i've got so
[1:21:13] much more here
[1:21:15] amen
[1:21:17] sister emmy
[1:21:19] sean would you come
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:23] we could
[1:21:25] we could just go on and on but i just
[1:21:27] feel led
[1:21:28] to
[1:21:29] to stop here
[1:21:33] we go into it i would encourage you go
[1:21:35] listen to
[1:21:38] 640614
[1:21:40] unveiling of god amen
[1:21:43] you'll see what's happening my brother
[1:21:45] and sister because let me just kind of
[1:21:47] bring my thoughts around and close them
[1:21:48] up
[1:21:50] you see when
[1:21:53] we become the unveiling of god
[1:21:59] did you catch my words
[1:22:01] when we become
[1:22:04] the unveiling
[1:22:05] of god
[1:22:08] that is the word of god
[1:22:11] made manifest
[1:22:13] in our midst
[1:22:16] not when we are identified with this
[1:22:18] church over here identified with this
[1:22:21] but when god manifested in his bride
[1:22:25] do you realize my brother and sister
[1:22:28] now every family is different
[1:22:30] i i don't mean to imply anything for
[1:22:32] your family
[1:22:35] and we're not perfect so don't
[1:22:36] misunderstand that i'm trying to make
[1:22:38] some kind of statements perfect
[1:22:42] but you see
[1:22:44] many many times
[1:22:46] i won't say even all the time but many
[1:22:48] many times my wife will come
[1:22:52] she'll stand before me
[1:22:56] and she'll say how
[1:22:58] do i look
[1:23:00] in this
[1:23:02] [Music]
[1:23:09] let me just put this out here
[1:23:13] honesty should come with a certain
[1:23:15] degree of wisdom
[1:23:16] [Music]
[1:23:22] and as godly as my wife is there's times
[1:23:25] i just tell her
[1:23:27] please don't wear them
[1:23:30] it is not
[1:23:31] [Music]
[1:23:32] uplifting to you it's not
[1:23:35] i wouldn't say it's terrible
[1:23:36] [Music]
[1:23:38] i just want and maybe it's because she's
[1:23:40] a pastor's wife
[1:23:42] i want her to be an example
[1:23:46] but let me stretch this a little further
[1:23:49] as a pastor's wife i hold her
[1:23:52] and i believe the lord holds her to a
[1:23:54] standard to represent
[1:23:56] godliness holy
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:02] but under
[1:24:04] that cloak of righteousness
[1:24:07] it's not about paul's standard
[1:24:11] it's not about the church's stance
[1:24:15] it's about
[1:24:16] the holy spirit leading and guiding
[1:24:20] and setting that
[1:24:21] you see as a church we can set a
[1:24:23] standard of this is acceptable and this
[1:24:25] isn't
[1:24:28] but what about the holy spirit
[1:24:31] can we get so cloaked in righteousness
[1:24:34] saints
[1:24:35] now this might specifically kind of come
[1:24:37] back to you sisters and i i certainly
[1:24:40] say this with love in my heart
[1:24:44] of us
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:47] might help me lord to say this correctly
[1:24:53] some of us just
[1:24:56] need just a little
[1:24:57] more wisdom
[1:24:59] that maybe we and of ourself could look
[1:25:01] in the mirror
[1:25:03] and say this
[1:25:05] is not the image
[1:25:07] of my husband not talking about natural
[1:25:11] this is not the image of my husband
[1:25:15] i'm going to present to the world
[1:25:18] i'm going to present an image to the
[1:25:20] world of my husband
[1:25:23] that he
[1:25:25] and me being flesh of his flesh and bone
[1:25:27] of his bone being a part of him
[1:25:30] has a higher standard of righteousness
[1:25:33] of holiness not legalism
[1:25:37] we're talking about a wife
[1:25:39] a wife caring enough
[1:25:42] of the image she projects of her husband
[1:25:47] that she
[1:25:48] then raises her own standard
[1:25:50] not the pastor not even a natural
[1:25:53] husband not a church book of creed of
[1:25:55] do's and don'ts but they themselves
[1:25:58] saying you know what i want to raise him
[1:26:00] up i want to give glory to him i want to
[1:26:03] present him in the highest possible way
[1:26:06] and so therefore i will present myself
[1:26:09] in the highest possible way
[1:26:12] so that when my neighbor
[1:26:14] and i meet over the fence as it were or
[1:26:17] at the mailbox as it were whatever it
[1:26:19] won't be that they're saying all just
[1:26:21] another christian
[1:26:23] they'll be saying
[1:26:25] there's something different
[1:26:29] something different here
[1:26:32] my i've got another 30
[1:26:34] minutes 40 minutes 50 minutes
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:41] but i want to put this last closing
[1:26:43] words to
[1:26:45] you see the word shows us we are
[1:26:46] reflecting the glory of god amen see the
[1:26:49] glory is as it were not endless
[1:26:52] we are not the glory of god
[1:26:54] i am a sinner saved by grace but i am
[1:26:58] also a new creation in christ jesus a
[1:27:02] new being and so therefore it is me
[1:27:06] coming and becoming the reflection of
[1:27:09] the glory of god
[1:27:12] hallelujah
[1:27:13] but i want you to see this
[1:27:16] it
[1:27:18] can no longer be hid in us
[1:27:21] many years ago i have a very good farmer
[1:27:22] friend and the lord opened the door and
[1:27:25] my heart breaks that he kind of went the
[1:27:27] route he did but
[1:27:29] we would talk we would meet on a field
[1:27:32] road and
[1:27:33] canal bank whatever and we would talk
[1:27:35] and
[1:27:36] and i i started expounding things to him
[1:27:39] and when it got uncomfortable for my
[1:27:40] friend
[1:27:42] he backed up and said you know what um
[1:27:44] paul
[1:27:45] his name is paul also he said um
[1:27:48] i've decided that my my faith my
[1:27:50] religion is very personal
[1:27:54] and i'm just i'm just not gonna go there
[1:27:56] anymore i'm just gonna keep it to myself
[1:28:01] hide it under a bushel yes
[1:28:06] i'm not gonna let it shine
[1:28:09] i'm gonna hide it under a bushel yes i'm
[1:28:12] not gonna let it shine
[1:28:14] no my brother and sister
[1:28:16] we're coming
[1:28:17] [Music]
[1:28:18] let me tie this
[1:28:20] the anointing on some believers in
[1:28:22] afghanistan
[1:28:24] that said no
[1:28:26] if my time on earth is limited
[1:28:31] i'm taking the basket off
[1:28:34] and i'm going to let the world know
[1:28:36] jesus christ
[1:28:38] is alive
[1:28:39] and well
[1:28:41] because you see
[1:28:42] the glory of god was not meant
[1:28:46] to be hidden
[1:28:47] in us
[1:28:48] [Music]
[1:28:50] it was meant
[1:28:52] to be revealed in us
[1:28:55] made known
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:28:58] hallelujah made known saints
[1:29:01] we're not here to hide it under a bushel
[1:29:03] we're here to let it shine
[1:29:06] if it costs our life you know i met a
[1:29:07] man once and of course it helps when
[1:29:09] you're like 75 to have this attitude
[1:29:12] but i met a man once and he says well
[1:29:14] praise the lord whatever comes in the
[1:29:16] future
[1:29:17] he said i'll gladly give my life
[1:29:19] and you think okay well he's older that
[1:29:21] might be good
[1:29:22] but you see my brother and sister it's
[1:29:24] not a thing about age
[1:29:26] it's a thing about revelation
[1:29:28] who am i
[1:29:30] i am nothing
[1:29:32] but a stick
[1:29:33] figure
[1:29:35] i'm closing i'm nothing but a stick
[1:29:38] figure
[1:29:39] wrapped
[1:29:40] in the righteousness
[1:29:42] of jesus christ that's all we are
[1:29:46] we're no great men because he said he
[1:29:48] doesn't reveal his word to the great
[1:29:50] mighty men
[1:29:51] were nothing but the stick figure
[1:29:52] wrapped in the righteousness of god he
[1:29:54] made himself to be sin
[1:29:57] who knew no sin
[1:29:58] that we might be made
[1:30:00] the righteousness
[1:30:02] of god
[1:30:03] hallelujah
[1:30:05] oh my i have such beautiful things to
[1:30:07] share
[1:30:09] maybe next sunday
[1:30:11] hallelujah
[1:30:12] open the eyes
[1:30:14] of my heart lord
[1:30:16] open the eyes of my heart
[1:30:18] amen you love the lord today
[1:30:22] i tell you saints i just each day of my
[1:30:24] life i make so many mistakes i don't
[1:30:26] even know why god would call me to be a
[1:30:28] pastor it just seems like i just am so
[1:30:30] mistaken
[1:30:34] but then i realized
[1:30:36] he has already provided everything
[1:30:40] i cannot pull that robe around me any
[1:30:43] farther any tighter i can't do it it's
[1:30:46] more than i'm capable but i can submit
[1:30:49] to him and say lord you know my heart
[1:30:52] you know my heart lord you know my heart
[1:30:55] lord
[1:30:56] and i just submit myself to your lord
[1:30:59] and my brother and sister even in our
[1:31:02] darkest trials we can see
[1:31:05] this cloak this robe of righteousness
[1:31:08] wrapping around us
[1:31:10] and we might say i'm not worthy but
[1:31:12] please don't say that
[1:31:14] that's not what the word says
[1:31:16] the word says you're worthy because he's
[1:31:18] worthy
[1:31:20] that means the issue of worthiness he'll
[1:31:22] take care of
[1:31:24] you just keep coming back i was thinking
[1:31:26] about this in the early hours of this
[1:31:28] morning
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:32] david a man after god's own heart
[1:31:37] did what we might consider
[1:31:40] unforgivable things
[1:31:44] wouldn't listen to god wanted to bring
[1:31:46] the ark back
[1:31:48] it's been killed
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:31:51] looks from his palace and to the roof of
[1:31:54] another house
[1:31:55] and lust in the flesh for besheba
[1:32:02] and the list could go on and on
[1:32:06] but you know what david did
[1:32:09] he always
[1:32:11] kept running back
[1:32:13] to the throne of grace
[1:32:15] he kept running back
[1:32:17] and god just kept wrapping that robe of
[1:32:19] righteousness around him and said he's a
[1:32:22] man
[1:32:23] after
[1:32:24] my own
[1:32:26] heart
[1:32:27] oh i i would just oh to see that written
[1:32:30] of me and you would just make our hearts
[1:32:33] be overjoyed
[1:32:35] but he is writing that

[1:45:54] that i would
[1:45:55] get a
[1:45:56] be with him for eternity
[1:45:58] no you see god deals in certainty
[1:46:01] amen

[1:46:05] why don't we move from possibility
[1:46:08] to certainty
