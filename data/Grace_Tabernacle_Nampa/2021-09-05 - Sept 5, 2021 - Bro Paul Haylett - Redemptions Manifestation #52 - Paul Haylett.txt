brother chris's remember your church age book chapter six you'll be going through that and as well as grace kids will be meeting at brother sergey and sister julia's at seven o'clock so let's pray for our young people this week amen this friday would just be a wonderful time maybe they'll grab another nugget amen and tuck it in amen as we get ready to receive our pastor let's sing i pledge allegiance thinking of that email trevor sent out of those in afghanistan the saints have given their life for this gospel we this may not be our call but each day we're faced with this that we need to stand amen so let's sing this as we get ready to receive our pastor i have heard how christians long ago were brought before a tyrant's throne they were told that he would spare their if they would renounce the name of christ but one by one they chose to die the of god they would not deny like the great egelic fire sinks i can almost their voices break i pledge [Music] allegiance to the land with all my strength with all i am i will seek to honor his command i pledge allegiance to the land now the years have come and the years have gone but the cause of jesus still goes on now our time has come to count the cause to reject this world to embrace the cross so one by one let us live our lives we're the one who died to give us life till the trumpet sounds on that final day let us proudly stand and boldly say i pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all i am i will seek to honor kiss a man [Music] to the lamb of god before my pain who took my place who warn my shame i will seek to honor his commands i pledge allegiance to the land i pledge allegiance to the land with all my strength with all i am i will seek to honor his command i pledge allegiance to the land hallelujah amen hallelujah i guess i didn't see the message about what is happening in afghanistan but i did this morning take a moment just to look and see and you know it's interesting saints i come across a little article of someone who is there in afghanistan and they had sent out a message to friends you might say on the outside we can understand the calling or the reflection of human nature and some have shut off their cell phones or disposed of them entirely and have gone into hiding and it's amazing that others have taken to the street and are going door to door in their one last testimony jesus christ is alive and well and he's here to save you and if we have to give our life we will simply give our life if that's what god has called us to do so you know it's a very interesting world we live in interesting times and you know we can get a little sad about what we see around us and all that has happened uh and uh but i i think we should take the scripture to heart that when you see these things coming to pass look up amen your redemption draw nigh it's not a time for us to get discouraged and not a time for us to cry and be frustrated but a time to look up amen well i just want to say god bless you sister tomah happy to have you back in our midst amen uh so lovely time i'm sure with family and amongst all those that you've grown through the years and spent so much time with and uh brother sergey we're once again declare we're very happy to have you back home i'm sure the family is also excited to see you god bless you our visitor in the back this morning i pray you have a lovely day today also in the presence of the lord god bless you saints just let's stand as we go into the word today and as we look at this we also want to remember kind of some things that we don't always come to our minds but remember brother ivan sister nadia's there on this little holiday i joked the other day that they're going down there where the storms are happening but just pray god just be with them and let them have a time of rest and comfort and just time together and also we want to remember our sister nadia we've been identifying her as uh brother sergey's mother but she is our sister so i'm i'm wanting to move to identify her for who she is not just brother sergey's mother amen and so just keep her in prayer also as uh the the government has their their process drug out for time and so just a few more weeks she will uh be coming to be here with the family and and we thank the lord for that just ask for his hand of mercy and also our daughter jo lynn um not here this morning so just ask you to remember her in prayer also amen let's turn our bibles to revelations 19 verses 1 through 9. actually a very very precious and lovely scripture to me uh as i look at this and we'll expound on that in just a few minutes um but uh it is uh have a much deeper i think it's a much deeper scripture than maybe we sometimes give credit to when we read it and we say oh that is beautiful and it brings a tear to our heart to our eyes and joy to our hearts but it's actually actually a very very deep scripture and uh so let's just turn right now revelations 19 and 1. after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah now remember this is not angels it doesn't say i heard a great chorus of angels amen i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power and to the lord our god for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up forever and ever and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped god that said on the throne saying amen hallelujah and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude in other words this was not a whisper it was not just a slight rumble in the background but this was a voice this was a sound that come forth an attention-grabbing sound of many voices a great multitude and as a voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth now my brother and sister when we look in this scripture uh this has confused many people through the years and people have turned it into doctrines the thunders the voice of god and and that you know people say and some claim and we won't go into this but some say well you know i am or my ministry or i was called to be that thundering and but let's just get this straight and keep it in its simplicity the thunders in their simplicity is god's voice so it is there you can say well okay but what about this or what about that god uses voices god uses your voice he uses my voice but ultimately the voice that matters the only one that has any significance is god's voice and so as the thunders come forth this is the word coming from the throne of almighty god to his people and it might be a prophet's voice that actually speaks this but he does not come in his own name even jesus said i don't come in my own name i come in the father and so we as sons and daughters of god and the prophets through the ages they come speaking and when they spoke the word right let's just cut out the negative okay when the word was spoken it was god's word it was god's voice so when we see here a voice of many watering we see a voice of mighty thunderings it doesn't matter my brother and sister i want you to just kind of approach this in an open mind it doesn't matter if it come as it were through the voice of a prophet or come through your voice if it's the word it's god's voice when you speak the word of god amen it's god speaking amen saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth how many times have you testified of that how many times have you declared to somebody it was jesus christ that changed my life how many times have you lifted up and said you know what i was in this situation the lord come on the scene i i had a migraine and and i said lord please help me and it went away much better than excedrin amen because it was the voice of god speaking the word of god and when the word of god is spoken it brings results amen amen let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come amen and his wife have made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called or can we say we're blessed this morning amen just lift a hand if you would this morning and say thank you lord i am blessed that you have called me blessed are they which are called into the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of god heavenly father just asking you to come lord we come father not in our own name not in our own ability but father we come as sons and daughters of god we've been called father lord there's not a doubt in our minds in our heart and soul lord that you called us and father that you made a way from before the foundation of the world lord for us to stand today to lift our voices lift our lives in praise and worship lord that we might be part of this great voice that is shouting out hallelujah to our lord our lord to bring praise to you to bring glory to you father lord i want to make sure lord jesus that i add my voice to those who give praise to you let me not be father lord i say i question lord jesus the terms that people use of the silent majority lord you did not call your people to be silent but you called for your people to lift their voices to the heavens lord we come today and add our voices to that great chorus lord we thank you for the opportunity today lord i lift those christians father those believers those saints father in those countries lord around afghanistan iran and pakistan and india father where where lord this uh persecution father is is a passive aggressive in some ways lord it's below the surface and no one sees it but yet father is those that were lined in the street the other day and massacred lord it is a very vocal time lord we just ask you father steal their hearts lord give strength to them let their confessions remain true and faithful in this great time of persecution we ask now lord that you would come for father we live in a place a time a season a nation where the persecution might not be open but father it is here lord a society more and more looks down upon christianity looks down upon your word father let us stand our trial might be different lord it might be prosperity it might be popularity it might be a multitude of things but lord let us also stand steady and faithful and true in your name we pray today amen you may be seated i have always felt that revelation 19 was a great magnification of all the word of god because as we'll look at this we will see as we come in those early verses there he says that he has judged the great and my brother and sister as we look in the word today we can identify it the scripture so clearly identifies who the great of revelation will be but it is nothing more than an earthly magnification of that antichrist spirit which is satan himself and so as it comes that satan himself would come in such a way he does not come you know as they often depict him uh with horns and a pitchfork and and uh you know a scary image he actually comes in the very beauty of the world that we live in he he comes in the finery and the riches and the comfort he comes to bring a scenario or a picture to people that attracts them and my brother and sister it's only later as it is the ravages of life that come upon people that he chose shows his true nature so it's there that he comes in such a fashion that well you know we look at this and i think if we are honest with ourselves that we all enjoy a degree of comfort or would like to enjoy a degree of comfort in our lives and i'm talking in the natural sense we we want to be able to to feel a degree of security a home and you know food clothes etc etc but you see my brother and sister to move beyond that satan he's always trying to project an image of something greater something of more value of something but in the end of the day those things that are outside of the word of god those things that are outside of the calling of god are our vanity and uh it's so so satan would present his image he paints his story uh you know the handsome man the beautiful woman the nice car house clothes all these kind of things but ultimately all those are just a substitute uh for what god intended for us and that was to have christ in our heart and have peace and comfort and joy in the lord amen so we try to fill those things you know we we have a things that happen in our life and and if we're not careful uh you know you might you might take something and use that to comfort yourself when god intended for his word to be our comfort and so as we look at this today we uh look at this in revelations 19 and we see this whole picture when it comes down to the end because you see my brother and sister it's not how well the project starts it's how well it is finished the building of a house might have a perfect foundation it might be framed correctly have beautiful appliances and amenities but if it doesn't have a good roof then it's only a matter of time before all that you have has crumbled in so the finish of the project as it were the very touch that is completing it is the thing that matters and we'll look and how see that satan here is exposed he stands judged i say thank you lord amen but look what the gist or the main thing of this scripture is and that is the lamb is exalted the lamb is glorified and that's what you and i were called to do my brother and sister you see it's not someone else that is that voice that is lifting up alleluia to the lord it is you and i don't look at it as someone else somewhere else but it is you and i that is called to lift our voice in this day and it is not something that's just going to happen once we have the other side living amen but it is to start here here is our training ground here is the place that you might say we practice and perfect our worship it's not that we're by divine revelation gonna go in a rapture and stand before the throne of god and suddenly know how to worship god wants you to learn it right here he wants you to learn it right now he wants you to learn to lift your voice to him right now amen and so it's there as we see this the lamb being exalted the lamb being glorified and i say lord help me to just lift my voice more often you know we all have a choice you can have a bad day my brother and sister and you can have a choice to become part of the moment and say oh this is just the worst day ever you know we have our joke around the farm this is the worst this is the worst but my brother and sister there is nothing on this earth that can be the worst unless it is us forsaking the word of god that is the worst everything else is a circumstance ecclesiastes says it happens to the rich and to the poor and to the righteous and to the unrighteous amen so don't confuse the circumstances of life with what is good and bad now in verse 8 we see that the bride now i i hope you can catch this you see the bride was granted see didn't just naturally come by this she didn't just because she claimed to be a christian she did this but this was almighty god granting to her the right my brother and sister to be arrayed and fine linen this is god saying you know what i'm giving to you this portion of me now my brother and sister we we don't want to get confused when we talk about the word now we have the word as we call it our bible here in print but it is the living word that is jesus christ amen so people say well we have the word and they're holding their bible we have the word but until this becomes living it is not the word in us and so the gospel without the power and demonstration of almighty god is a book that was published and can be bought but when it becomes a living word in us is when we become the living epistles of jesus christ read of all men oh lord let me be something to be read i want to as it were be published lord that my neighbor my friend my family can see the word of god in me amen not just my testimony not just my words that i'm a christian but let them be able to read it and see it and then themselves become a testimony that this person is different hallelujah we don't want to be different as in strange right we want to be different because we're not of this world so you look at this it was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for fine linen is a righteousness of saints and so it is that she has been granted now to be arrayed in a fine linen now my brother and sister the linen the righteousness of saints god choosing look what it is now we know that righteousness is only of god right no man can be righteous of his own nature of his own character of his own word but righteousness is of the lord and so god says i'm gonna let you i'm gonna grant to you the ability to display my righteousness it is not you displaying what church you go to or display an ideology but it is been granted to us to display the very life of jesus christ and the scripture says if you're ashamed of me i'll be ashamed of you but you see if we're ashamed we don't truly have the cloak or the arraignment of righteousness because righteousness changes in nature from our nature to his nature and he was not ashamed of you he said man we've got these people they're just a bunch of sinners can i just put god's words into my words for you this morning these bunch of sinners nobody really wants them but i do and every deficiency oh here's the list i don't care because my blood that's right takes that away everyone else says oh she ought to be stoned and he said good either without sin go ahead and throw the first stone why because he knew no one could undo that list but he himself and so he come to this bride in this generation actually through the ages but here we live in 2021 he come to this bride in this age and said don't be afraid i have already taken care of all of this i've already eliminated get this those that can throw a stone at you now look at the human nature are we humans don't you like that when you go online and you're trying to take care of business and i'm not too bright i'm sorry i hate to admit that but i get on there and then this thing pops up on the screen and it's like are you a human of course i'm a human so we enter this code and it's got all these weird numbers and letters at different angles and i'm just like ah is the sixth first or the seven the tail of the seven sticks out further in my mind that means it's first but it never works i call my wife my daughter and sadly enough even my granddaughter help me and they go in there okay there you go you see what i can't figure out he said i've already taken it and those of you have a little complex are are we humans okay let's all here real quick we're humans why do we care come on saints why do we care about the one standing off to the side with a stone amen that's exactly right why do we care about them they are already bound by the spirit of god we see it in this world well they say and they this and this person forget it my brother and sister they can't judge you because they are not without sin because if they were without sin they would be praying for you not throwing stones at you so those that are carrying as it were sin in their life and they want to just throw stones in every which direction usually it's because they're carrying a complex of their own maybe god's dealing with them and they simply just don't want to repent they don't like the fact that they see you moved by the spirit of god they see you coming under the influence of the holy spirit and they see you repenting and changing your life and they don't like that because they can't seem to come there so don't worry about that guy that's caught the stone or the gal it's got the stone over here they have nothing to do with you nothing at all to do with you so she's been granted to display the righteousness of god now i want you to think about that my brother and sister that is not no small thing to be granted to display the righteousness of god amen remember what the scripture says about earth and vessels now he will not put new wine which is the holy spirit in an old dirty vessel and so when god poured his spirit into you that's because he knew he had washed you sufficiently the water of the word had come in such a fashion that it went down into the deepest innermost things of your life where you might say this happened to me when i was a young man or a young woman and i've just never been able to get over that get over it get up to the altar amen to the word come in his presence let him wash you because he wants to pour himself into you amen this is not a matter of oh i attend church or i do this or i do that this is that personal relationship where we have experienced you know i always like to liken this and then bless my bless my grandmother but as a child you know she just come from a generation you know and we'd go spend nights at her house and and you know some people say oh that's just must have been awkward as a child but my granny you know you'd be in the bathtub and then she'd say okay i'm coming in there and she'd come and she had what looked like a brillo pad and she said put them elbows up here because no grandchild of mine is going in public with dirty elbows and she'd scrub them things to where it wasn't a grandchild going in public with dirty elbows as a grandchild going in public with bright red buffed elbows amen but she knew what it took to get the dirt off she knew that it wasn't a casual little bit of soap and a little buffing of a washcloth was going to do it she knew exactly what it'd do to take that off of there and my brother and sister the holy spirit knows exactly i don't care what struggles we're had in the past what struggles you're having right now god knows exactly how to come and to buff us clean oh can someone say thank you lord oh it might be a little complex or it might be a very serious matter but god knows what he's doing hallelujah but this my brother and sister is i i hope i can make emphasis of this as the lord was just speaking to me that we can recognize what a privilege amen can i emphasize that like down in the south this is a privilege to manifest the life of jesus christ none of this woe unto me i'm a christian but glory hallelujah god saw fit to make me part of this great plan god saw fit to let me come and be magnified oh my brother and sister be magnified you see what god is doing god could come down today and he come down in their midst we'll touch it on a quote here in a little bit but you see god come down in their midst and because they did not know the word they did not recognize him now these were people who studied the word every single day of their life but they still didn't know the word the word was a intellectual conception the messiah is coming and when he comes he's going to do this and then the sadducees come up and said no no no no when he comes he's going to do this and sanhedrin said you're both wrong when he comes he's going to do this and the independent thinker says no according to my studies when he comes he's going to do this and what did they do they built upon what they thought but if they had known i hope you catch this if they had known the word amen they would have known him amen hallelujah reminds me of the time policeman pulled over a man for driving excessively fast comes up he says sir do you realize you're going 85 and a 55 and he says yes and he says well i'm going to give you a ticket he said i'll have you to know i'm friends with the governor and the policeman stood there a minute and said you're friends with the governor i am friends with the governor is the governor your friend see this is the problem if we know the word then the word knows us never a one-sided relationship always always so what is it my brother and sister you see as we read revelation 19 god choosing to display his righteousness in his bride because he arrayed her in fine linen which is the righteousness of saints so god is magnifying himself now who is it my brother and sister i uh don't be too critical of me this morning in in my in my vocabulary because my mind is just jumbling along here but you see my brother and sister uh the word of god never said that christ himself would come down in this day as it were himself as he walked on the shores of galilee doesn't say he's going to come now and walk on this earth as that man right no place in scripture to speak to that but the scripture speaks over and over again how he would come in this generation now where is he at where's he at saints come on think about it amen he come to magnify himself in his bride and he said when i magnify myself in her because i am righteous she's going to be cloaked in righteousness she's not going to be walking independent just hoping she's making it he said this work i began in you i'm going to finish and what was that he started out when god first started do you remember when god first started to deal with you hey man he started to touch your heart you started to realize that a bottle at dance hall at this or that out here was not the answer to my problem and what did god do he started actually at that time wrapping that cloak of righteousness around you now we just think it's done no sir no sir god's working on you and i working on us worked on me this morning a little bit amen i felt the robe coming a little farther around my life this morning i hope you can say the same thing i hope you walk away from here today knowing and and having that i'm not talking about feeling as an emotion but feeling the presence of god the cloak of righteousness coming around us once again because that's god's expression of him in you amen because his word is not producing a people that just run and shout i'm okay with that some people get nervous i'm good with that my brother and sister but that doesn't mean that the cloak is around us that's right amen it doesn't mean that we're walking in the presence of god we can speak in tongues and that doesn't prove it because there's all kinds of nonsense goes with people speaking in tongues that when that cloak of righteousness makes its complete wrath around the bride of jesus christ she then is a complete magnification on this earth of jesus christ himself hallelujah not a chino right we're not just christians in name only there's got to be a life that backs it up i've shared with you the the pentecostal preacher that that i kind of like to listen to once in a while he's getting quite old now doesn't preach too much but um i just remember a time that he's standing in a convention a house to be thousands great big uh great big coliseum type building i think it actually was a church but just huge thousands of people in there and and he comes and he just starts in now look under the upc my brother and sister speaking in tongues is the evidence right but here's a man that says look i've spoken tongues and i believe it's important and and god bless him for that opinion that thought amen but he says what i'm expecting what i'm expecting is those of you that have spoken tongues you have spoken tongues and boy hands just the whole building is nothing but hands i expect to see a life out of you well i'll tell you what hands went down people got quiet you see it's not just some outward display but it is the cloak of righteousness amen it has to be around us because here we see this manifestation of the word right we do believe that the word must come to pass right amen so god is choosing to display his righteousness in his bride amen easy enough to understand god as righteous right we serve a righteous god he's holy but when it comes to us it gets a little more difficult doesn't it sure glad our thoughts aren't projected sometimes because my inner voice is just tearing me up i don't think any of us would have to go back very far to remember our last mistake we don't have to maybe even the devil climbed in the car on the way to church with us i don't know and we're going to spend the rest of the service thinking about that mistake unless of course you recognize that cloaked in his righteousness you know my wife didn't even know what i was preaching this morning but she's wandering around the house what's in what's him i can't sing the proper verse because i sing it to the home of the tractor and it comes out differently but you see let's not get confused about being cloaked in god's righteousness and this flesh being perfect that's right the devil wants you to move from the cloak of righteousness to the cloak of our tradition of righteousness our version of righteousness is the pious man now look my brother and sister brother branham says that that those uh was the kind of priest they they thought jesus was off the rails he he was there plating a rope and beating them out of the temple and doing all of these things and here was the kind old priest who had paid their medical bill and helped pay their rent and encourage them and so they viewed jesus as being the radical and the kind old priest who is actually deceiving them by tradition as the one that had righteousness isn't that interesting we would have such a view now look at this see god's word which is christ magnified amen fulfill the promise of this day in this great hour of resurrection notice it gives them joy this talk about the bride of christ now gives them joy to know that we are with him a flesh of his flesh a bone of his bone what a joy that's the only thing that a real believer cares about you see now i'm not talking about we live a double life right but i'm telling you if you focus on your mistake you'll walk out of here today thinking about whatever mistake you made today or last night and we should walk out of here with the revelation and a joy in our heart that god said i have wrapped my cloak of righteousness around you and i am not even to hold now why would he say in his scriptures that he won't even hold our sin to our account that's it if we had no sin that's right amen but i'm a believer i'm a believer now i'm sorry i'm sorry do you know that fear is a sin and i run into a lot of people they're afraid of coven we hear all kinds of things oh they give you the shot and they can put a magnet on there they give you the shot they can track you now they give you the shot they can now give something else and you'll catch that disease they did all this stuff what is it my brother and sister it's fear you realize my brother and sister as we look at the word of god to reach into a fire and have a venomous snake latch onto you and you grab that snake and cast it away and claim your healing in the name of jesus christ we have scriptural example and if god did it for one man god is obligated to do it for you if god ever forgave one man of his sins he's obligated to forgive you god ever healed one man he's obligated to heal you because i am god and i change not amen so god doesn't play some kind of double standard like we do we're having this family over honey just throw out a couple biscuits and uh triscuit and that'll be fine oh we're having these over oh my we gotta get this get this run to the store get this get this get this come on that's right come on i kept it simple like that because as message believers food is our fellowship circle have you ever noticed that right that's why we're all fat we're going to have a fellowship yeah amen so look coming to revelation is how i'm going to put this coming to revelation it gives them joy to know that we are with him flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone look my brother and sister when a man we're talking about in in a scriptural spiritual fashion when a man takes his wife she then becomes his identity amen amen and i don't care how nice the man might be right if is oh are we allowed to use these kind of words in church if she's a snark then the image in the community is that family are snarks well it goes both ways we're talking in a spiritual fashion so what is it then the identity of the husband is identified in the character of the wife that he takes oh are you with me are you following me this morning and so god come along and said you know what i knew i know who i chose for a wife i know who i chose for a bride and i'm gonna wrap my cloak of righteousness around her and then she is now not identified as herself she is identified as me oh hallelujah under this traditional now people do whatever they want to do when it comes to names and i understand cultures and don't misunderstand this but my brother and sister you know when a woman in this day and age gets married and keeps her own name well i i personally this am i allowed to express opinions when a woman gets married and won't take her husband's name i think it's a bigger deeper issue than just a cultural thing because we have now my brother and sister even in the day that we're living spiritually and it is there that the thing is is what we want and we see it in scripture right we will seven women taking one man we'll keep our own name amen we'll keep our own identity oh they take the name of jesus christ but they really have kept their own name that's exactly right i've seen a wedding jerry jerry and i was talking about this just a memory we were remembering that was coming come back to us and and uh oh can i tell little back story you know i i drive around not that i really i'm not expecting to move or anything like that but it's kind of a little family joke we drive along and we're like oh that is a very nice church we'll claim that it's got grass for our young people and adequate parking and signs already up that say you can't park here and uh anyway we're driving along and jerry goes why don't you claim that church and i said oh and she goes well you've already been in it and i was like i have and then she starts describing and it was a wedding and the the minister comes down to the very end of the wedding and and he says i uh pronounce you man and wife and whatnot and now i introduce you and he has the man's first name right but entirely different last name and i think in the church the preacher was the only one that didn't figure it out everybody's like the bride and groom are looking at each other you know my brother and sister we we're not going to keep a different name we're not going to be identified over that we are the bride of jesus christ [Music] we're not bride of first nazarene we're not bride of first methodists we're not bright of whatever we are the bride of jesus christ amen and so to be identified in him is very important to us right i don't want another name i don't want somebody attaching another name to me amen so now in first corinthians the first chapter uh verse 21 he says for after after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god so we understand that he says by the he'd hide it from the wise and prudent it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching and i can say amen nobody else has to even say amen i'll say amen to this foolishness of preaching to save them but believe for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews of stumbling block and unto the greeks foolishness but unto them which are both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god now look at this when we look at this and and the expression uh christ the power of god this brings us back again to the gospel my brother and sister we can preach the bible we can do a lot of things but if there is no power behind it we can recount these things we can read them it can becomes a liturgy and or the doxology and we just speak this reminds me on a plane flight one time amen we literally got into such turbulence that the the cart in the center the announcement comes over and says stewardesses sit down and the carts start rattling against things and the stewardess and i don't say this be crass but up a few chairs in front of us this stewardess just literally sits down in this gentleman's lap and he's a little shocked but you know all of a sudden the cart's rattling back and forth in this big old jumbo jet that we're on we're not on some little thing big old jumbo jet just starts flopping around and across the aisle from us faster than you could draw a gun in the wild west this lady had out her rosary and she's there muttering to herself now she might have walked away and said oh praise god god heard me but my brother and sister the word of god so i'm not i'm not defaming the catholics but the word of god clearly says that these things of repetitious nature is not what god is into god is in that personal relationship where we identified as his wife and when she speaks he listens amen not not to do that and we have oh i'm not going to go in depth this morning but we have very similar traditions showing up absolutely imagine yes sir but the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh and not many mighty or not many noble are called but god had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound uh things which are mighty now i want to expand on that for a minute the moment that you say i can do this you're right here in this scripture you're placing yourself mightier than your position as a wife in other words i don't need a husband to fix this for me i don't need to consult i don't need to share i don't need to ask i don't need to appeal to i can do this that's not what god said god said you know what the wife now you can take this natural take it spiritual the wife is the weaker vessel so she doesn't need to go as it were into the gym and start pumping iron because i'm going to show my husband that i can plow the field i can build the house i can do this i can lead the family amen no amen well i hope that didn't hurt you see he's chosen the weak he's looking for a wife that says lord i i tried once did you ever try to put that cloak of righteousness on i tried once and i found out lord the cloak is much greater than i am i i cannot i cannot wrap this cloak around myself remember the little story about the man coming to the lord and saying lord i i can't bear this cross any longer i said okay come over here open the door take it in there leave it come on out they walk down a hallway and down a hallway and turn a corner and walk in a door go in there and choose a cross and he walks through the room and walks through the room and walks through the room and he comes to a cross it's the smallest cross in the room and he picks it up and he says this is the cross i want to bear and he says that was the cross that you deposited here see we can't wrap this cloak of righteousness around us it's just far too great for us to do it's more than we are capable amen and there's a reason look at this but god has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen ye and the things which are not to bring to not those things that are that no flesh i have this enlarged torah it takes up the whole page that no flesh can glory in his presence that we could come to the place that in everything in our life we are calling out to him lord lord i need you lord i need you to guide me this is why words of encouragement come over and over again get up in the morning ask the lord to lead you and guide you and protect you and you do that what you're doing you're telling him lord i'm submitting my day to you and i i don't want to be the one that has the answers for my day lord i want you to have the answer for my day otherwise we could start to glory we start to tell ourselves that i'm a great christian i'm a strong christian i can do this isn't it amazing every time you even get an inkling of being that that a trial comes that shows you you know why because god loves you that's exactly god loves you so much it's like i'm not going to let you become fat head have you ever been called a fat head well i'll tell you what happens even if you didn't get called a fat head we become fat heads have you ever seen kids it's fun to watch kids there's a toy on the floor nobody's played with it for 30 minutes one kid goes over and picks it up and the other one comes stampeding over there and says that's mine and the other one says no that's mine and then they start a runkus with each other and almost always one gets in trouble and one goes away crying and the one who got in trouble he cries too right but he goes away with a little spark of knowledge i can take that away from him any time i want we've watched it for generations my own children your children yeah you children now what happens we carry that same kind of knowledge right up into adulthood that's it and we carry it right over into our spiritual experience and we can pray and say lord i rebuke the devil in your name and god comes on the scene and a little child with a fever gets up and goes off and plays something happens here something happens there and if we're not careful we get this little idea ah we meaning i that's right can take this away from the devil anytime i please but it's quite the opposite my brother and sister we in the flesh have no ability to deal with the devil but when we are wrapped in that cloak of righteousness it is no longer us it is god himself and you will find that a man or a woman wrapped in that cloak of righteousness will not have a religious spirit she will not have an attitude she will not think she is something she will recognize i am nothing without jesus christ in me i am nothing i have no strength amongst myself i have no ability in myself it all lies in christ himself and i can do oh get this now the depth of that scripture i can do all things oh sounds fat headed don't it but look at the identifier in christ jesus so what is it when i'm inside that cloak of righteousness i'm not afraid of the devil i'm not afraid of sickness i'm not afraid of the circumstances of the world but we get outside of that cloak my brother and sister we have no authority against the devil and he knows it but when you are inside that robe of righteousness wrapped in that fine linen of the word amen the devil knows and recognizes whoa i i might be able to get them and trip them once in a while but it's only because they've maybe put their foot outside amen because the word says as long as you're hiding in the tabernacle the devil can't touch you come on saints i want you to think about it amen god didn't want us to glory in ourself amen my a lot of thoughts i'll just keep to myself this morning now look we'll go in second corinthians 5 here as we just come pretty close to closing down here therefore if any man be what to say here come on not next to him not in the same building not on the same street not on the same continent not in the same religion he's got to be in christ here my brother and sister is the robe of righteousness and what is it when we as the bride are walking in that fine linen which is the righteousness of saints we're in it it's only in this generation that we live in that people's clothes clothes are on them and they're not in them i hope you follow that because i really don't want to have to explain that but we live in a generation that they think if they just have something on them that they're clothed and we probably won't go into the scripture here today but my brother and sister it is there that they don't think they're naked but revelation says they are naked and don't even know they're naked because the robe of righteousness they are not in it it's on them in other words it's a religious amen spirit a religious experience and they're not really in the robe of righteousness therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given us the ministry of reconciliation now i want you to catch this given us who is us yes us as you you as us where is the spirit then that shows up in the confines of the christian church that is constantly trying to bring separation trying to they don't see it like we do this don't like this now let's not mistake what i'm saying here for dealing with air in other words we don't let the wolf into the sheep pin because we don't want to offend the wolf that's it i've seen a cute little cartoon i i hope you can catch this see this in your mind and uh we're not here you know to to be kind to the devil you know that i see in this cute little cartoon it shows a wolf packing a sheep and he goes up to the mailbox opens it puts a letter in the mailbox closes it and walks off then here comes the shepherd you know bald head big beard robe staff comes to the mailbox opens it pulls out the letter opens the letter reads it and in there it just says i o e w e i o u only he's stolen the you but i owe you no my brother and sister this reconciliation is where you come and you say look brother sister what you're doing what you're saying is not the word take it back to the word where is it at in the word and they say i don't care it's revelation okay my brother and sister i'll just tell you talk to you as a pastor to a church we don't say it we've reserved these seats for you and you're welcome to go to every fellowship and have your own fellowships and spread your version see that's not reconciliation because you go into the scripture right by the foolishness of preaching my job or the ministry's job is to reconcile you back to the word not reconcile you to another ministry not reconcile you to somebody's ideology or somebody's thoughts but to reconcile you back to the word and so we should be praying for the spirit of reconciliation to be on us to come back to the word and unto others to come to the word amen did that make sense to you to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them thank you lord amen inside that robe of righteousness you are then not having any sin imputed to you if we're out here on our own we can look at the word and say oh he's not going to put any sin on me no you're covered in your own righteousness you're covered in your own work you have to be covered in his hallelujah right coming back to the mercy seat and the blood upon the ark and the blood upon the mercy seat amen it was not my brother and sister that we can flaunt that we will not be judged it is the fact that the mercy seat with the blood on it stands between you and the ark stands between you and judgment so we have to have the blood to with that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and half committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ do you know when an ambassador goes to another nation maybe he comes and he says our country is willing to do this for you under these terms and we agree to this do you know when that ambassador signs his name to that accord it's the same as our government that's right signing their name to that accord so do you realize that when we become ambassadors for christ come on get this now remember there's always two spirits in the framework of the church when we come as true ambassadors for christ we're actually signing christ's name in word and deed i don't mean to be negative but my brother and sister that's why so many people in this day and age don't even want anything to do with christianity because people have signed a lifestyle a behavior a conscious a moral value they've signed that in the name of christianity in the name of jesus christ and even the world out here can look at that and say that's bogus because they weren't true ambassadors let a true ambassador be a true representation of jesus christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you and christ said be ye reconciled for he hath made him to be sin being reconciled to god but he has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness amen of god in him see here's our path coming god just didn't just throw it out there and say just claim righteousness and you're righteous you see he had a pathway he had a process for us hallelujah hallelujah boy i've got so much more here amen sister emmy sean would you come amen we could we could just go on and on but i just feel led to to stop here we go into it i would encourage you go listen to 640614 unveiling of god amen you'll see what's happening my brother and sister because let me just kind of bring my thoughts around and close them up you see when we become the unveiling of god did you catch my words when we become the unveiling of god that is the word of god made manifest in our midst not when we are identified with this church over here identified with this but when god manifested in his bride do you realize my brother and sister now every family is different i i don't mean to imply anything for your family and we're not perfect so don't misunderstand that i'm trying to make some kind of statements perfect but you see many many times i won't say even all the time but many many times my wife will come she'll stand before me and she'll say how do i look in this [Music] let me just put this out here honesty should come with a certain degree of wisdom [Music] and as godly as my wife is there's times i just tell her please don't wear them it is not [Music] uplifting to you it's not i wouldn't say it's terrible [Music] i just want and maybe it's because she's a pastor's wife i want her to be an example but let me stretch this a little further as a pastor's wife i hold her and i believe the lord holds her to a standard to represent godliness holy [Music] but under that cloak of righteousness it's not about paul's standard it's not about the church's stance it's about the holy spirit leading and guiding and setting that you see as a church we can set a standard of this is acceptable and this isn't but what about the holy spirit can we get so cloaked in righteousness saints now this might specifically kind of come back to you sisters and i i certainly say this with love in my heart of us [Music] might help me lord to say this correctly some of us just need just a little more wisdom that maybe we and of ourself could look in the mirror and say this is not the image of my husband not talking about natural this is not the image of my husband i'm going to present to the world i'm going to present an image to the world of my husband that he and me being flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone being a part of him has a higher standard of righteousness of holiness not legalism we're talking about a wife a wife caring enough of the image she projects of her husband that she then raises her own standard not the pastor not even a natural husband not a church book of creed of do's and don'ts but they themselves saying you know what i want to raise him up i want to give glory to him i want to present him in the highest possible way and so therefore i will present myself in the highest possible way so that when my neighbor and i meet over the fence as it were or at the mailbox as it were whatever it won't be that they're saying all just another christian they'll be saying there's something different something different here my i've got another 30 minutes 40 minutes 50 minutes [Music] but i want to put this last closing words to you see the word shows us we are reflecting the glory of god amen see the glory is as it were not endless we are not the glory of god i am a sinner saved by grace but i am also a new creation in christ jesus a new being and so therefore it is me coming and becoming the reflection of the glory of god hallelujah but i want you to see this it can no longer be hid in us many years ago i have a very good farmer friend and the lord opened the door and my heart breaks that he kind of went the route he did but we would talk we would meet on a field road and canal bank whatever and we would talk and and i i started expounding things to him and when it got uncomfortable for my friend he backed up and said you know what um paul his name is paul also he said um i've decided that my my faith my religion is very personal and i'm just i'm just not gonna go there anymore i'm just gonna keep it to myself hide it under a bushel yes i'm not gonna let it shine i'm gonna hide it under a bushel yes i'm not gonna let it shine no my brother and sister we're coming [Music] let me tie this the anointing on some believers in afghanistan that said no if my time on earth is limited i'm taking the basket off and i'm going to let the world know jesus christ is alive and well because you see the glory of god was not meant to be hidden in us [Music] it was meant to be revealed in us made known [Music] hallelujah made known saints we're not here to hide it under a bushel we're here to let it shine if it costs our life you know i met a man once and of course it helps when you're like 75 to have this attitude but i met a man once and he says well praise the lord whatever comes in the future he said i'll gladly give my life and you think okay well he's older that might be good but you see my brother and sister it's not a thing about age it's a thing about revelation who am i i am nothing but a stick figure i'm closing i'm nothing but a stick figure wrapped in the righteousness of jesus christ that's all we are we're no great men because he said he doesn't reveal his word to the great mighty men were nothing but the stick figure wrapped in the righteousness of god he made himself to be sin who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god hallelujah oh my i have such beautiful things to share maybe next sunday hallelujah open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart amen you love the lord today i tell you saints i just each day of my life i make so many mistakes i don't even know why god would call me to be a pastor it just seems like i just am so mistaken but then i realized he has already provided everything i cannot pull that robe around me any farther any tighter i can't do it it's more than i'm capable but i can submit to him and say lord you know my heart you know my heart lord you know my heart lord and i just submit myself to your lord and my brother and sister even in our darkest trials we can see this cloak this robe of righteousness wrapping around us and we might say i'm not worthy but please don't say that that's not what the word says the word says you're worthy because he's worthy that means the issue of worthiness he'll take care of you just keep coming back i was thinking about this in the early hours of this morning [Music] david a man after god's own heart did what we might consider unforgivable things wouldn't listen to god wanted to bring the ark back it's been killed [Music] looks from his palace and to the roof of another house and lust in the flesh for besheba and the list could go on and on but you know what david did he always kept running back to the throne of grace he kept running back and god just kept wrapping that robe of righteousness around him and said he's a man after my own heart oh i i would just oh to see that written of me and you would just make our hearts be overjoyed but he is writing that amen [Music] open the eyes of my heart let's just stand and worship the lord for a few minutes eyes of my home i want to see i want [Music] to open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i'll sing this from your i want to see you [Music] to see [Music] riding in the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we sing holy [Music] [Applause] holy holy holy [Music] how do i want to see you lord [Music] o shining in the light of your glory [Music] and love [Music] holy holy holy holy holy i want to see you let me just hold my peace after this don't go looking for him in the galaxies don't go looking for him out there somewhere he is right here well let's get a little more personal about that he is right here hallelujah let him wrap his righteousness around us and all we have to do is say forgive me lord i'm sorry lord i just give you you know i say this maybe there's a tad bit of humor in this and i don't necessarily mean to be bringing humor at this point but we can say well i gave him the steering wheel but as long as you've got the clutch the brake and the throttle amen you got to give it all to him just surrender it all amen we could sing that song i surrender all and that would cover that we recognize i've got to surrender it all and he is the one who's putting the robe of righteousness it's not me i can't do it if i'm trying to do it i'm trying to create a works gospel and this is not a works gospel my brother and sister this is a surrender gospel this is a yielding gospel this is a gospel of us standing up and saying okay lord i've messed up enough i'm just going to give you everything and let you take care of it hallelujah amen brother jason you sang that song in the service uh [Music] i will forever lift my eyes i just got yes let's sing that in hey man help us 3 48 amazing grace shall always be my song of praise [Music] for it was great [Music]

means there's a possibility hallelujah i'm all about possibilities in fact i read a quote this morning that was talking about possibilities [Music] and i believe prophet said god fails in possibilities but he also deals insurgencies hallelujah now i'm going to live my whole life for the lord i'm going to do everything i can within my ability submitting myself to the lord and there's a possibility that i would get a be with him for eternity no you see god deals in certainty amen so it's not a matter of if why don't we move from possibility to certainty well that same [Music] he dwells in me [Music] oh yes that's [Music] it has quickest [Music] quick [Music] hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah thank you lord [Applause] well i've been to the water and i've been

you feel well you just speak the word you claim it he's the one who promised he said that this wife the lamb's wife would make herself ready what is she doing she's not running to and fro she's not running out here trying to find more not trying to find something to please the lord you know what she's doing making herself ready she's stopped she stands still she's quiet in the presence of god
