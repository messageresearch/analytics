[40:36] hallelujah you know i just want to take
[40:39] just a second if you don't mind i
[40:41] wouldn't want to embarrass anybody
[40:44] but i cannot tell you
[40:46] how wonderful this day is to me
[40:49] because there was a season there was a
[40:51] time that our sister sharon
[40:54] the world had waved
[40:56] their best
[40:59] you know the devil never throws a
[41:01] half-hearted offering
[41:03] he always throws his best and
[41:07] it
[41:08] just brings joy in my heart our sister
[41:10] sharon here today and i say this with a
[41:13] tad bit of humor she's just now
[41:16] just another married woman
[41:21] but how beautiful god is
[41:24] to bring together a relationship our
[41:26] brother yannick sister sharon
[41:29] to bring forth this beauty
[41:31] a blessing a gift from god
[41:34] and how we have such a wonderful
[41:36] privilege
[41:38] to
[41:39] raise these children up in the fear and
[41:41] admonition of the lord
[41:43] not a casual we hope
[41:46] that they will serve god but we have a
[41:49] confidence we have a trust
[41:52] that that
[41:54] we saw in satan's best offering
[41:57] a redeeming power
[41:59] and
[42:01] i'm thinking about my my sermon today
[42:03] i'm thinking about our special song
[42:07] he's began this good work in us saints
[42:09] and he promised
[42:11] he would keep it and i i say i believe
[42:13] it was just the lord
[42:15] led our sister yulia
[42:17] and family and brother sean to sing that
[42:19] song this morning
[42:21] because there is
[42:22] a keeping power
[42:24] there is
[42:26] something that satan cannot equal he can
[42:28] offer his best of the world
[42:31] but my brother and sister god's got
[42:33] something greater for us and
[42:35] i consider it a real privilege this
[42:37] morning to
[42:39] be able to dedicate
[42:41] this wonderful little treasure this
[42:44] blessing of god
[42:46] that we are claiming today and speaking
[42:48] from our hearts
[42:50] that
[42:51] the lord having called him from the
[42:54] foundation of the world will keep him
[42:56] to the culmination amen and so we just
[43:00] want to take this time
[43:02] to just speak blessings over this child
[43:05] and yes there'll be challenges
[43:08] there'll be times that this will be a
[43:10] sassy little boy
[43:12] there'll be times of a disobedient
[43:14] little boy
[43:16] and there'll be times that these parents
[43:18] will feel like just
[43:20] lord why
[43:22] why lord
[43:23] but in the end when we see the power of
[43:26] god come down
[43:27] and seal this little soul with the seal
[43:30] of the holy ghost
[43:32] and to see this young man if the lord
[43:35] tarries to see him lifting his hands in
[43:38] the house of god and declaring that
[43:41] jesus christ is his lord and savior in
[43:44] the end just like our own spiritual walk
[43:47] we'll declare
[43:49] it was worth it
[43:50] it was worth every trial every
[43:53] temptation every struggle
[43:56] amen hallelujah
[43:58] i'm glad he's sleeping he won't look up
[44:03] and become afraid of brother paul
[44:06] um
[44:08] yes
[44:09] isn't he a handsome little guy
[44:12] my i'm telling you i just

[46:32] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i tell
[46:36] you i know that sometimes verbiage can
[46:39] kind of spook people but i have a
[46:42] special love affair with our sister
[46:43] sharon
[46:45] i got to see her come
[46:48] as a sister
[46:51] even when it was hard
[46:53] she'd come
[46:54] and would speak to me and pour her heart
[46:56] out
[46:57] and it just bonded my heart and that's
[46:59] what i'm talking about love affairs just
[47:01] bonded my heart with hers because there
[47:03] was something so deep within her heart
[47:05] and her soul
[47:07] that even in the times we might be
[47:09] embarrassed by what we have done or what
[47:11] is happening around us
[47:13] we still would come and be able to say i
[47:15] want to be right
[47:16] with the lord and so i have that special
[47:19] relationship and i love and appreciate
[47:21] brother yannick is always so open kind
[47:24] and loving uh to speak and and we
[47:27] appreciate that let's just thank the
[47:29] lord for little mary and neville today
[47:31] amen god bless you my brother
[47:34] god bless you hallelujah
[47:37] hallelujah
[47:39] how beautiful
[47:41] amen i think it was brother ron peterson
[47:43] one time said you know i could make a
[47:45] career out of dedicating babies
[47:48] and um and i think i agree with him 100
[47:51] percent
[47:52] amen
[47:56] well
[47:57] this
[47:58] morning i
[48:00] find it remarkable
[48:02] once again god is so faithful let us
[48:06] come
[48:07] and
[48:08] to be able to find through the service
[48:12] i'm taking little thoughts as it were i
[48:15] might be incorrect so
[48:17] correct me if i'm right or wrong or
[48:19] whatever
[48:21] i think sister yulia you were going to
[48:23] sing that song on wednesday maybe so
[48:25] there was something about
[48:27] would be
[48:28] sunday
[48:29] well i believe it was ordained for
[48:31] sunday
[48:32] that's what i think it wasn't uh a lack
[48:34] of time or circumstance whatever it was
[48:37] when god ordained it to be and i believe
[48:40] that song fit very very well
[48:42] and uh also i won't go into detail on
[48:45] that but um there was um
[48:48] uh
[48:50] uh
[48:50] things in the song service that that
[48:53] just uh
[48:54] really touched me i thought well thank
[48:55] you lord i i appreciate that and um
[48:59] my brother jason and i was having just a
[49:02] a little revival in the back room
[49:04] uh there
[49:06] and uh
[49:07] you know i tell you i just uh i was
[49:09] started crying back there and i'm kind
[49:11] of having a little bit of a struggle to
[49:14] quit
[49:14] and that's i think
[49:16] jason's fault
[49:18] uh
[49:20] amen
[49:22] let's just stand saints and let's go
[49:24] right into the word
[49:25] amen appreciate the
[49:27] work of the musicians what they're doing
[49:29] for us
[49:32] just
[49:32] an atmosphere
[49:34] amen
[49:39] it's really the prophet of god shares
[49:41] with us over and over again
[49:43] how much of it is built
[49:46] around the atmosphere
[49:48] and with the wrong atmosphere we can
[49:50] have all of the message of the hour and
[49:53] the wrong atmosphere and god will not
[49:55] move in our midst but by god's grace we
[49:58] can come
[49:59] and in that atmosphere the lord will
[50:02] even take our inadequacy
[50:06] and he'll
[50:08] bless it
[50:10] when we are weak
[50:11] he is strong
[50:13] and when we come thinking that we have
[50:15] something to offer
[50:18] then
[50:18] it always i'm reminded you know the
[50:20] minister brother brown talks about went
[50:22] up there with his chest puffed out and
[50:25] he did that and was preaching to those
[50:27] pentecostal people
[50:29] and he come down humbled and
[50:31] you know it was voice that if he went up
[50:34] the way he came down he'd came down the
[50:36] way he went up and so we want to create
[50:39] an atmosphere that god is is pleased to
[50:42] come in and we can walk away from the
[50:44] house of god built up and strengthened
[50:47] amen
[50:48] hallelujah
[50:49] uh
[50:50] i want to give early announcement on
[50:52] this even though it's actually a little
[50:54] more than it's like roughly two and a
[50:57] half weeks away
[50:58] but our brother marcus becker from
[51:00] germany
[51:01] uh will be passing through this part of
[51:04] the world on a wednesday night on
[51:06] september the 14th
[51:08] and uh i hope this doesn't sound too
[51:11] critical but i would encourage some of
[51:13] you who don't even show up on wednesday
[51:15] nights that wasn't too harsh was it
[51:19] to show up
[51:21] you'll be blessed
[51:22] brother marcus a wonderful brother
[51:25] and uh he's passing through from one
[51:28] speaking engagement we've just caught
[51:30] him
[51:31] uh on his passing through you might say
[51:33] he even changed his route that he was
[51:36] traveling to come see us
[51:38] so let's just come and fill up the
[51:40] church on wednesday night september the
[51:42] 14th to um
[51:45] to uh just receive a blessing
[51:48] and also give support to a brother who
[51:50] has changed his itinerary to to just
[51:53] come and be with us amen
[51:55] now once again i don't mean to be too
[51:58] harsh
[51:59] but
[52:00] how many of you did your homework
[52:07] and how many of you even remember you
[52:09] had homework
[52:14] proverbs the third chapter
[52:17] is a lovely lovely now i'm i'm not
[52:20] throwing down on you saints don't
[52:21] misunderstand but i received a text late
[52:24] last night
[52:25] from a brother who doesn't even live in
[52:27] this country
[52:28] that let me know
[52:30] he had done his homework
[52:33] and uh i thought hmm
[52:35] do i mention it
[52:38] and i just couldn't help myself i just
[52:40] had to ask you did you do your homework
[52:42] so you know uh there's brothers in
[52:44] foreign countries that are doing their
[52:46] homework i pray that we our local body
[52:49] of believers can also do our homework
[52:52] amen
[52:53] and maybe i should do you want me to
[52:55] send out a group text on the home would
[52:58] that be good as a little reminder i know
[53:00] life is busy
[53:03] yes
[53:04] i know we're busy in life and i i don't
[53:06] mean that judgmental or whatever but i
[53:08] know we're busy but you know sometimes
[53:11] uh we can grasp a lot
[53:14] from what it's taken from and so
[53:17] i will a little later today
[53:20] i'll give you another homework
[53:21] assignment we can try again
[53:24] amen
[53:25] hallelujah
[53:27] now
[53:28] a key element saints before we go in
[53:30] this scripture i want to lay this out a
[53:32] key element to being an overcomer
[53:34] is a good solid foundation in christ
[53:37] right if we have a very poor foundation
[53:40] uh we you know uh many years ago uh
[53:43] sister sue has bought me just a lot of
[53:46] history books on warfare and things of
[53:49] that and you know uh
[53:51] a book that she bought me many years ago
[53:54] and i've read it oh probably three times
[53:56] at least
[53:57] and it's about a a commander a major i
[54:01] believe he was at the time
[54:03] training troops to go to vietnam
[54:06] and in the base where they are training
[54:08] there is uh many groups like this and
[54:11] and different men of rank training are
[54:14] overseeing this and this man
[54:16] drove his men so much that they talked
[54:19] about uh uh fragging him which was a
[54:22] term in that day when they would wait
[54:24] till a man went to the restroom or
[54:26] whatever and they'd throw a grenade in
[54:28] there and then they were history and
[54:30] there was all kinds of talk but his
[54:32] common phrase was as hard training
[54:36] now
[54:37] more blood on the training ground will
[54:40] be less blood on the battlefield
[54:43] and his men hated him for it
[54:46] and he would look them in the face and
[54:48] say the reason i'm doing this is i want
[54:50] you to come back to your life
[54:54] they still hated him for it
[55:01] but nothing ever happened to him no one
[55:03] ever
[55:04] hurt hammer
[55:07] they became
[55:09] the
[55:10] infantry battalion that went to vietnam
[55:14] and came home
[55:16] with the lowest casualty rating
[55:21] so truly what he put them through
[55:25] manifested itself
[55:27] that more of them came home
[55:31] than any other group that was sent there
[55:35] now taking that thought in mind i would
[55:37] like to lay out before you my brother
[55:38] and sister
[55:40] us being overcomers
[55:42] on one side we can say is locked into
[55:44] predestination
[55:48] but if we
[55:49] say well i'm just predestinated to be an
[55:52] overcomer do you believe that
[55:55] but you're going to find many bloody
[55:57] battles
[55:59] because we don't have a good foundation
[56:01] we don't have the right training
[56:03] and so it's there that if we have the
[56:05] right training
[56:07] the prophet of god preaches on it speaks
[56:09] of it the scripture lays it out very
[56:10] clearly that when we can understand the
[56:13] wiles of the devil the prophet of god
[56:16] says when we learn to block the fiery
[56:19] darts of the enemy
[56:23] then
[56:24] we know true joy and victory in jesus
[56:26] christ but if we don't learn to block
[56:28] those we will then be repeating over and
[56:32] over and over again these same
[56:34] challenges facing the same pain the same
[56:37] heartbreak
[56:39] the same condemnation as it were
[56:42] you see what god wants us to do
[56:44] is he wants us to take the word
[56:47] and learn
[56:48] how to weld it
[56:51] as a powerful two-edged sword
[56:54] not just to hold the bible up and say
[56:56] devil back up back up i've got a bible
[56:59] best-selling book on the face of the
[57:01] earth today millions upon millions have
[57:03] a bible and millions and millions you
[57:06] can hear the chain rattling
[57:08] in their life
[57:10] we've got to learn how to weld this
[57:12] two-edged sword
[57:14] and use it with wisdom and judgment
[57:17] and use it without fear
[57:19] amen
[57:21] i want to speak to you today
[57:24] on our once again the overall thought
[57:27] our position of strength i want to speak
[57:29] to you today on being anchored
[57:31] and as we look at this i want to just go
[57:34] into the scripture hebrews the sixth
[57:35] chapter
[57:37] verses one through eight
[57:39] as we will
[57:40] look at this now
[57:44] i want
[57:46] i want um as we are going to actually
[57:48] take the whole chapter
[57:50] of hebrews 6
[57:52] but i want to break it down in two parts
[57:54] because it in essence is dealing
[57:56] entirely with two different people
[57:58] and uh we want to by god's grace be able
[58:01] to step into that and break
[58:04] this down
[58:06] hebrews 6 and 1 says therefore
[58:09] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[58:11] of christ
[58:13] now i'm telling you when this was spoken
[58:15] to the hebrew somebody would have rose
[58:17] up and said whoa that's wrong you're
[58:19] trying to leave the principles of the
[58:22] doctrine of christ
[58:24] that's that's false you're not going to
[58:26] deceive us
[58:28] but you see he's telling him to move
[58:30] forward saints to be in church today you
[58:33] had to leave your house
[58:35] and you could have drove to church but
[58:36] decided to stay in your car
[58:40] i'm going to sit in my car in the
[58:41] parking lot and stream the service
[58:46] no you had to leave your car
[58:48] we could start that all the way back to
[58:50] getting out of bed
[58:52] yeah
[58:53] and we know how much some of you love to
[58:55] nap so getting out of bed is a pretty
[58:57] big challenge
[58:59] but you have to leave that you have to
[59:00] leave the dinner the breakfast table you
[59:02] have to you know and it goes on and on
[59:05] therefore leaving the principles of the
[59:07] doctrine of christ
[59:09] let us go on unto perfection
[59:12] not every church service laying again
[59:14] the foundation of repentance from dead
[59:16] works
[59:19] and of faith toward god let me read that
[59:22] correctly so no one would say i
[59:23] misconstrued the word
[59:25] not laying again the foundation of
[59:27] repentance from dead works and of faith
[59:29] toward god of the doctrine of baptisms
[59:33] of laying on of hands and of
[59:35] resurrection of the dead and of eternal
[59:37] judgment
[59:38] and this we will do if god permit in
[59:41] other words these are things that need
[59:42] dealt with these things need to be
[59:43] preached about they need to be taught
[59:46] but that's not my brother and sister now
[59:48] i hope i don't offend anyone this
[59:49] morning but i'm just going to say it
[59:51] right out this is not for us to come
[59:54] again and constantly service after
[59:56] service preach god sent a prophet
[1:00:01] it's time for us to move on
[1:00:04] time for us to realize what this message
[1:00:06] really is and it's so so so much more
[1:00:11] than god sent a prophet
[1:00:14] and some people would have almost
[1:00:16] elected fit over me saying that
[1:00:19] but the truth of it is my brother and
[1:00:22] sister it's time
[1:00:24] for us to grow up from milk
[1:00:27] to strong meat
[1:00:28] and move on into perfection
[1:00:32] those aren't too strong of words are
[1:00:33] they
[1:00:34] and this we will do if god permit for it
[1:00:37] is impossible for those who are once
[1:00:39] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:00:41] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:00:44] the holy ghost
[1:00:45] and have tasted the good word of god and
[1:00:48] the powers of the world to come
[1:00:51] if they should fall away
[1:00:54] to renew them again and to repentance
[1:00:57] now my brother and sister you have to
[1:00:58] understand because the devil will now
[1:01:00] try to inject this in people's minds i
[1:01:02] have a husband i have a child that's not
[1:01:05] serving god it's going to be impossible
[1:01:06] for them to come back that's not what
[1:01:08] this scripture is saying this is to the
[1:01:10] people who have turned their heart
[1:01:13] against god
[1:01:15] turn their heart against the word
[1:01:18] these are the ones that have come to the
[1:01:20] place that they are like well if god
[1:01:23] loved me if god this and they then
[1:01:26] create an atmosphere that once again in
[1:01:29] their life they're actually by rejecting
[1:01:31] the word of god
[1:01:33] are putting a period at the end of
[1:01:36] everything god ever said
[1:01:38] so we're not talking we're seeing god
[1:01:40] move in a mighty way in the land my
[1:01:42] brother and sister
[1:01:43] not just in america but through the
[1:01:45] continents we're seeing god move in a
[1:01:47] mighty way and men and women who have
[1:01:49] went away from the word of god many
[1:01:51] years ago are coming back and i love
[1:01:54] this now i don't want to sound harsh but
[1:01:56] i love this because they have a common
[1:01:58] testimony and that is i have been
[1:02:00] miserable
[1:02:02] well praise the lord for that
[1:02:05] you all know some of you'd be offended
[1:02:06] pray for my son i will i'm going to pray
[1:02:08] they're miserable
[1:02:10] pray for my wife my sister my whatever
[1:02:12] yes i will lord make them miserable
[1:02:16] don't give them a flowery bed of ease
[1:02:18] make them miserable lord
[1:02:23] your horse
[1:02:25] i had a sister in the message with good
[1:02:27] intention a twinkle in her eye tell me
[1:02:30] you're harsh
[1:02:32] well sister i'm not going to pray that
[1:02:34] your son who has come back to the lord
[1:02:37] i'm not going to pray that your son has
[1:02:39] a good life
[1:02:40] i pray that every time and everything
[1:02:43] that he does and everywhere that should
[1:02:45] be great joy overwhelmed
[1:02:50] drunk on the beach with the moon shining
[1:02:52] so beautiful and everyone laughing
[1:02:55] may he be in the corner
[1:02:58] saying what is wrong with me
[1:03:01] what is wrong with me
[1:03:04] yeah
[1:03:05] hope you don't find that too harsh
[1:03:08] and have tasted the good word of god and
[1:03:10] the powers of the world to come if they
[1:03:12] should fall away to renew them again and
[1:03:14] to repent and seeing they crucify to
[1:03:16] themselves the son of god afresh and put
[1:03:19] him to an open shame
[1:03:22] we're
[1:03:23] going to
[1:03:24] take down to the eighth verse for the
[1:03:26] earth which drinketh in the rain cometh
[1:03:30] oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs
[1:03:32] meat for them by whom it is dressed
[1:03:35] receiveth blessing from god but that
[1:03:38] which beareth thorns and briars is
[1:03:40] rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose
[1:03:42] end is to
[1:03:44] be burned
[1:03:45] now we're going to make a break here and
[1:03:47] just allow you to be seated because you
[1:03:50] see verse 9 goes on and says but beloved
[1:03:53] we're persuaded better things
[1:03:56] of you heavenly father we ask lord you
[1:03:59] would come
[1:04:00] speak to our hearts touch us
[1:04:02] and father for our loved ones i stand
[1:04:04] here today
[1:04:06] lord jesus with a son and a daughter-law
[1:04:08] and grandchildren not serving you
[1:04:11] lord jesus i will not give up
[1:04:14] i will not lose hope
[1:04:17] i will not
[1:04:18] quit praying
[1:04:20] and believing
[1:04:22] i claim them i have brothers
[1:04:24] their families lord jesus we will claim
[1:04:29] what is rightfully ours
[1:04:31] in the name of jesus christ now open the
[1:04:34] word to us lord make it alive i pray
[1:04:36] amen
[1:04:38] you may be seated saints hallelujah
[1:04:51] now i'm going to
[1:04:53] just speak some very direct things today
[1:04:55] and i hope it doesn't offend anyone
[1:04:58] sometimes we just have to quit patty
[1:05:01] caking around things
[1:05:04] you'll find my brother and sister that
[1:05:07] there's many dividing lines in the
[1:05:09] message
[1:05:10] uh brother i won't name his name today
[1:05:12] don't want to like toss them under the
[1:05:14] bus trying to break that habit but
[1:05:16] there's a brother shared once that he
[1:05:17] says i believe marriage and divorce will
[1:05:19] become a dividing line in the message
[1:05:22] and we are now seeing that being
[1:05:25] manifested where some people uh are
[1:05:28] there's very staunchly on one side now
[1:05:30] i'm not talking about marriage and
[1:05:31] divorce of a circumstance in your life
[1:05:34] but marriage and divorce as a place of
[1:05:36] justification of what you're doing or
[1:05:38] how you're doing it uh marriage and
[1:05:40] divorce as uh something that you believe
[1:05:42] you can completely disregard my brother
[1:05:45] and sister god did not give us this to
[1:05:47] play it as a game but to take a vow and
[1:05:50] live up to our vow because if we can't
[1:05:52] hold the simplest of vows then we won't
[1:05:54] hold any vow at all and so there it is
[1:05:58] my brother and sister uh the dividing
[1:06:00] line of these elements
[1:06:03] nowhere my brother and sister does the
[1:06:05] message of the hour the scripture lay
[1:06:07] out that being a follower of the message
[1:06:11] is making you a part of this plan of god
[1:06:14] now people would say whoa whoa we
[1:06:16] followed the message my family has
[1:06:18] followed the message
[1:06:20] and uncle and followed the message but
[1:06:22] my brother and sister i want you to go
[1:06:24] if you want to and make a little
[1:06:26] homework of this and look up what the
[1:06:28] word follower means now being a follower
[1:06:30] does not mean that you strictly adhere
[1:06:33] to what it is you are simply as those
[1:06:36] who left egypt right there was a what
[1:06:39] does this scripture say mixed multitude
[1:06:41] that left out of israel
[1:06:44] out of egypt i mean and followed israel
[1:06:47] they were not followers of jehovah they
[1:06:50] were looking for a way to get out of
[1:06:53] their circumstance that was though
[1:06:55] controlling their life in egypt and so
[1:06:58] this mixed multitude did not make them
[1:07:00] israelites and did not make the promise
[1:07:03] of the land their promise
[1:07:06] are you with me
[1:07:08] amen but it's rather moving into a
[1:07:10] position with christ
[1:07:13] this is what this is about it's not
[1:07:15] being a follower but it's being put into
[1:07:17] a position now i don't have the quote
[1:07:19] but i'll make reference to it where the
[1:07:20] prophet of god says that i didn't come
[1:07:24] to make you followers or for you to look
[1:07:26] to me but i come that you would be
[1:07:29] introduced to jesus christ
[1:07:32] that's what it was he wasn't gathering
[1:07:34] up followers he wasn't gathering up a
[1:07:37] group of people that would be identified
[1:07:40] with him my brother and sister you can
[1:07:43] look beyond the curtain of time of what
[1:07:44] the prophet of god shares therein and
[1:07:47] he's there and and you know uh he he
[1:07:50] gives us this uh confidence that it is
[1:07:53] what paul preached and brother brown
[1:07:54] says i preached what paul preached and
[1:07:57] we as the bride of christ responded were
[1:07:59] counting on it so he didn't come and say
[1:08:02] i've got an all-new original message for
[1:08:05] you but he was preaching the collection
[1:08:08] as it were of the things god had
[1:08:10] revealed through the ages and made it
[1:08:12] real to us and the prophet of god tells
[1:08:15] us over and over again i've always
[1:08:16] pointed you and i will always point you
[1:08:18] to jesus christ
[1:08:20] amen so it is this message my brother
[1:08:23] and sister is a moving
[1:08:25] now if we are not moving today if we
[1:08:28] find ourselves and well i've been in the
[1:08:30] message and i am what i am and we
[1:08:33] haven't moved my brother and sister
[1:08:35] you're gonna find that you're not far
[1:08:38] outside of egypt if you haven't moved
[1:08:44] see the original word would have been
[1:08:45] come right down to the waters of the red
[1:08:47] sea and keep right on walking and walk
[1:08:49] right out into it and god would have
[1:08:51] said they believed my word and the
[1:08:52] waters would have separated but you see
[1:08:54] what happened is satan throws a tendency
[1:08:57] for us to get all comfortable
[1:08:59] well my family has always been message
[1:09:02] believers or they can put a date my
[1:09:05] parents grandparents coming to the
[1:09:06] message at a certain time oh that's good
[1:09:09] and i i actually am very happy to hear
[1:09:11] those kind of conversations just as long
[1:09:13] as we can see there's a moving
[1:09:16] well without a moving my brother and
[1:09:17] sister we might very well be right where
[1:09:19] we was when we were introduced
[1:09:21] and so it's there you know it reminds me
[1:09:23] speaking of moving i won't mention names
[1:09:25] here as i said trying to break the habit
[1:09:28] but i was friends many years ago not in
[1:09:31] a real deep way but with a young man who
[1:09:33] was just incredibly bashful and shy
[1:09:36] and um they ended up back in missouri i
[1:09:39] believe it was and he met a young lady
[1:09:41] there and uh he really really liked this
[1:09:44] young lady and and i loved spending time
[1:09:47] with her but he was so shy and so afraid
[1:09:50] of being rejected that uh you know he
[1:09:53] expressed all kinds of little things uh
[1:09:56] you know showing that he loved her young
[1:09:58] men i can give you a few lessons on
[1:10:00] courtship if you want amen you got to
[1:10:03] show them
[1:10:04] oh they're way clever they're way clever
[1:10:06] brothers
[1:10:07] but in the end you've got to show them
[1:10:10] you're going to let them know you're
[1:10:11] serious
[1:10:12] amen
[1:10:14] so
[1:10:15] he just kept you know take her for
[1:10:17] dinner buy her gifts
[1:10:19] finally
[1:10:20] one day she says oh
[1:10:22] james
[1:10:23] let's go for a walk in the park
[1:10:27] they're walking through the park
[1:10:30] and she says james
[1:10:33] let's sit on this park bench right here
[1:10:37] and he's kind of like okay sits down
[1:10:41] she pulls her skirt up a little bit
[1:10:44] james
[1:10:45] will you marry me
[1:10:49] totally backwards
[1:10:51] but effective
[1:10:53] because
[1:10:54] he just couldn't
[1:10:56] get it out
[1:10:59] but she knew he loved
[1:11:01] and he loved her it was obvious
[1:11:03] but you see my brother and sister
[1:11:05] sometimes we have to make sure that what
[1:11:08] we're expressing and how we're
[1:11:09] expressing it is going to put us in a
[1:11:12] position to move forward
[1:11:14] we can't just say i love the lord and
[1:11:16] never change
[1:11:18] we can't say i believe in the power of
[1:11:20] the word never change
[1:11:22] we can't believe that this is the real
[1:11:24] word for the hour amen this is what
[1:11:27] broke the yoke of bondage and never
[1:11:30] change
[1:11:32] the yoke is broken but we act like and
[1:11:34] live like we're still under bondage no
[1:11:36] we have to move into a position a deeper
[1:11:39] position with christ and entering into
[1:11:43] my brother and sister you want to talk
[1:11:45] about a change that's happening and this
[1:11:47] is part of that um oh when i preach this
[1:11:49] myself it would just come out so
[1:11:51] eloquent
[1:11:54] you know this great fuss that's around
[1:11:56] the world today of whether the seals are
[1:11:58] open or not or the seventh seal i kind
[1:12:01] of shared with a few of you i don't
[1:12:02] remember if i mentioned it or not but
[1:12:04] you know you get a text and somebody's
[1:12:06] saying i was told you don't believe the
[1:12:08] seventh seal is open and i thought what
[1:12:10] a paradox when here we had all this
[1:12:13] friction and all this within the church
[1:12:15] about us believing the seventh seal was
[1:12:17] open and them telling us we're wrong and
[1:12:20] now somebody comes along and says we
[1:12:21] don't believe you believe seventh seal
[1:12:23] is open and i thought the devil is
[1:12:25] unrelenting if he's gonna attack from
[1:12:28] any direction but the people who declare
[1:12:30] these things don't even know you
[1:12:35] it's just a talking point from the devil
[1:12:40] think about that
[1:12:42] don't feel sorry for me that's not what
[1:12:43] i'm bringing it about it's like my
[1:12:45] response was
[1:12:47] if they said that they don't know us
[1:12:49] they've never heard us preach they don't
[1:12:50] know our church
[1:12:52] amen but you see what it is my brother
[1:12:54] and sister this
[1:12:56] moving being a follower of the message
[1:12:58] is wonderful but there comes a time that
[1:13:01] something is taking place can someone
[1:13:03] say amen
[1:13:04] something is taking place i have moved
[1:13:07] from being a follower and my brother and
[1:13:10] sister at the opening of the seventh
[1:13:12] seal i moved from being a follower of
[1:13:15] the message to being the message
[1:13:18] amen so i'm no longer people like we
[1:13:21] follow the message i'm sorry i don't
[1:13:23] follow the message any longer i am the
[1:13:26] message
[1:13:27] i am the revealed word in this hour the
[1:13:30] prophet said so my bible says so i am
[1:13:34] the word in flesh on the earth today
[1:13:38] hallelujah
[1:13:42] yeah listening to a song
[1:13:45] you've come too late
[1:13:48] to tell me about it
[1:13:50] yeah
[1:13:51] too late
[1:13:53] we have become the word
[1:13:55] expressed in this hour
[1:13:57] this is who we are
[1:13:59] why
[1:14:00] because we follow the message
[1:14:02] no
[1:14:03] christ has come and take us deeper
[1:14:07] beyond just followers
[1:14:09] we are not mixed multitude we are the
[1:14:13] bride of jesus christ
[1:14:15] not a mixed multitude not sitting there
[1:14:17] my brother and sister will the word be
[1:14:19] preached to the lukewarm and to the make
[1:14:22] believers and to the those that are
[1:14:24] called the word will be preached but
[1:14:26] this message was not sent to go remind
[1:14:29] the lukewarm or remind the unbeliever
[1:14:33] this message was sent to bring life amen
[1:14:36] to bring forth a german nation and a
[1:14:39] life into the bride of jesus christ that
[1:14:42] she could come and manifest jesus christ
[1:14:46] here on the earth today
[1:14:49] otherwise we're nothing but a bunch of
[1:14:51] talking heads with notes and things that
[1:14:53] we can research to argue
[1:14:57] the argument's over
[1:14:59] the devil lost
[1:15:00] the word's been open
[1:15:03] i am the bride of christ
[1:15:05] oh does that mean i'm perfect no it
[1:15:07] doesn't mean i'm perfect i'm still in a
[1:15:09] body of flesh but i am moving forward
[1:15:13] into perfection i'm not here to argue
[1:15:16] how you want to be baptized and how you
[1:15:19] believe the thunder's men and what this
[1:15:21] over here is that i am here to live the
[1:15:25] life that is in this word that it was
[1:15:27] poured out into me
[1:15:30] oh my brother and sister
[1:15:33] you say brother paul you're just
[1:15:34] rehashing the same old things
[1:15:36] well as long as the devil's talking
[1:15:39] as long as the devil's talking long as
[1:15:41] the devil
[1:15:42] is coming
[1:15:44] and saying no you got to just see
[1:15:46] i heard a quotation of this the other
[1:15:48] day all you've got to see is that god
[1:15:50] sent a vindicated prophet with a
[1:15:52] vindicated message
[1:15:54] the devil sees that
[1:15:57] there's people that would rip you off
[1:15:58] for your last dime see that
[1:16:02] i'm looking for life
[1:16:04] i'm not looking for words i'm looking
[1:16:06] for life
[1:16:07] i want to see the life oh not to prove
[1:16:09] them right or wrong i want that life
[1:16:12] that life is who i am and that's what my
[1:16:14] heart cries out for is that life i want
[1:16:17] to be that life
[1:16:22] oh my
[1:16:25] let me say it this way in case any of
[1:16:28] you misunderstood me
[1:16:31] god sends a prophet in our day is that
[1:16:33] right
[1:16:34] introduces the revealed word for the day
[1:16:39] many follow the message
[1:16:41] receiving two from the message however
[1:16:44] you want to say
[1:16:46] but the opening of the seventh seal
[1:16:49] made us
[1:16:50] the message
[1:16:52] that's what god's intent was
[1:16:54] otherwise my brother and sister
[1:16:58] we can intellectually
[1:17:00] open the seventh seal
[1:17:05] will that do us any good
[1:17:08] show up in heaven
[1:17:10] you know the old figurative deal meet
[1:17:12] saint peter at the gate
[1:17:14] saint peter what's my name on the book
[1:17:18] before he can even answer
[1:17:21] let me prove to you
[1:17:22] saint peter the seals are open
[1:17:28] saint peter would hear us as we quote
[1:17:30] quotes and quote scriptures and we tie
[1:17:33] it together we bring in a little bit of
[1:17:35] luther we bring in a little bit of
[1:17:37] wesley we bring in a little bit of
[1:17:39] of all of these men through the ages
[1:17:42] and when it would all get done peter
[1:17:44] would still say
[1:17:46] no name
[1:17:52] sorry
[1:17:56] come on we often times hash over this oh
[1:18:00] yeah well it's not intellectual
[1:18:02] intellectual message but then we explain
[1:18:04] it
[1:18:09] and that's good because that's what the
[1:18:10] preaching of the word does it brings
[1:18:12] forth and lays it out clearly for us
[1:18:15] but you see my brother and sister
[1:18:18] can you explain it
[1:18:21] i was in the clay
[1:18:24] i wasn't sure there was even a god
[1:18:26] but one day
[1:18:28] something
[1:18:30] something started stirring in me
[1:18:32] something
[1:18:33] and when i found myself in my greatest
[1:18:35] time of need i didn't say oh buddha
[1:18:42] i said oh god deliver me
[1:18:46] and he said i've been waiting
[1:18:49] you see i actually led you up to this
[1:18:51] point that you would cry out my name
[1:18:55] and god opening the word
[1:18:57] moves us forward
[1:18:59] amen and as the song says we won't leave
[1:19:01] our little ones behind and some of our
[1:19:03] little ones are 60 50 60 70 years old
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:09] so you look at this my brother and
[1:19:11] sister the bride of jesus christ
[1:19:14] what is she
[1:19:18] a lot of explanations
[1:19:20] you get as many people together and you
[1:19:22] can have a lot of explanations what the
[1:19:24] bride of christ is
[1:19:26] they're predestinated they're called
[1:19:28] before they're those that he died for
[1:19:30] and just various deals brother jason and
[1:19:33] i've been having conversations like this
[1:19:34] you know what is the message
[1:19:39] maybe as we exit today we'll have a
[1:19:41] little poll
[1:19:43] some of you look terrified already
[1:19:46] but i want you to stop we won't do
[1:19:48] something like that but i want you to
[1:19:50] stop what is the message to you
[1:19:53] it really should come down that we would
[1:19:55] all have the same theme or the same
[1:19:57] thought because my brother and sister
[1:19:59] the message is not tapes it's not books
[1:20:02] it's not a church amen this message the
[1:20:06] only
[1:20:07] possible defendable position is this
[1:20:11] message is jesus christ
[1:20:14] that's the only thing that comes because
[1:20:17] we can come to a position that we say
[1:20:19] god sent a prophet my brother and sister
[1:20:22] but you can see as i said earlier there
[1:20:24] are men that will just adamantly defend
[1:20:26] that god sent a prophet but you better
[1:20:29] hold on to your wallet when you do
[1:20:30] business with them that is not the
[1:20:32] message
[1:20:34] that is not the life that is there we
[1:20:37] are talking as the prophet of god laid
[1:20:39] it out for us what is the gospel it is
[1:20:42] the life behind the word
[1:20:45] amen not a bunch of words but a life
[1:20:49] that is behind the word that makes it
[1:20:51] living in you and i
[1:20:54] hallelujah people say well we had that
[1:20:56] without the seals
[1:20:58] well my brother and sister that might be
[1:21:00] fine but you see there's an hour that it
[1:21:03] is not just we are redeemed we sing that
[1:21:05] song that we're redeemed it's not just
[1:21:07] that we're redeemed we've been redeemed
[1:21:10] as the bride
[1:21:12] you know uh
[1:21:13] could be
[1:21:15] you know could be me could be some other
[1:21:17] brother here whatever
[1:21:20] disperse these
[1:21:22] you might have started out at 16 17 18
[1:21:25] 19 years old
[1:21:27] and you just went to
[1:21:30] you know
[1:21:31] camp
[1:21:32] and you met several fine young ladies
[1:21:34] and
[1:21:35] you can tell how old-fashioned i am you
[1:21:36] guys would tweet and twitter and
[1:21:38] whatever all this stuff would be back in
[1:21:40] our day the way to do that is you wrote
[1:21:42] a letter
[1:21:44] now the downside of writing a letter
[1:21:47] is that someone else holds the evidence
[1:21:49] besides you
[1:21:53] and that was actually good because you
[1:21:55] know they have i guess this thing in
[1:21:57] this day and age now where they can send
[1:21:59] a photo they can send a text and after
[1:22:02] 48 hours or something
[1:22:07] it's gone
[1:22:09] my you could be very bold
[1:22:13] oh you're the most beautiful girl on
[1:22:14] earth and my heart just twitter painted
[1:22:16] and writing the same message to seven
[1:22:18] different girls
[1:22:22] you guys know what i'm talking about it
[1:22:24] happens
[1:22:26] oh you know
[1:22:28] but i tell you what you get a holy
[1:22:29] ghost-filled young man you get a holy
[1:22:31] ghost-filled young lady and uh yeah you
[1:22:33] might write seven letters as it were hey
[1:22:36] how are you god bless you happy to meet
[1:22:38] you but there'll be one letter
[1:22:41] that returns back maybe the other four
[1:22:44] don't even respond
[1:22:48] one responds with thank you
[1:22:50] your wonderful friend
[1:22:53] you set that one to the side
[1:22:56] but there'll be one letter that comes
[1:22:58] back and it was like i was so happy to
[1:23:00] meet you too and you know let's keep
[1:23:02] writing and blah blah blah and one of
[1:23:05] those letters will come and say ask my
[1:23:07] dad if you can call me
[1:23:11] wow that's a sign
[1:23:15] god said in our day he would discern the
[1:23:17] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:23:19] did you realize in a courtship in a
[1:23:21] minor factor is discerning the thoughts
[1:23:24] and the intents of the heart
[1:23:27] i'm not trying to spiritualize it i'm
[1:23:28] just telling you it's a fact you realize
[1:23:30] this young lady
[1:23:32] or this young man
[1:23:34] there's something special there and i
[1:23:36] like them and and then next thing you
[1:23:37] know you know a year later they are mr
[1:23:40] and mrs
[1:23:41] it all started from a little
[1:23:43] communication it all started from a
[1:23:44] little
[1:23:45] something you know
[1:23:46] i know i know
[1:23:49] some funny stories maybe i shouldn't go
[1:23:51] into that but let's just say i know a
[1:23:53] married couple that it all started with
[1:23:55] a wink
[1:23:57] yeah
[1:23:59] god bless you shaking a sister's hand
[1:24:01] god bless you and she winks at him and
[1:24:03] he's like
[1:24:10] they're mr and mrs
[1:24:12] yeah
[1:24:16] somebody told me they asked her
[1:24:18] why did you do that and she said i
[1:24:19] didn't know how else to get his
[1:24:20] attention
[1:24:23] yeah
[1:24:24] so this bride of christ my brother and
[1:24:26] sister is not just some people that
[1:24:28] heard the preaching of the message
[1:24:31] this bride of christ has had a deeper
[1:24:33] communication and something discerned
[1:24:36] the intent of the heart and you might
[1:24:38] think i'm presenting this kind of
[1:24:40] strange but we discerned the intent of
[1:24:44] the heart of god
[1:24:46] we were able to discern that god in the
[1:24:49] written word is telling me i am the
[1:24:53] bride of christ you are discerning the
[1:24:56] heart of god while he discerned your
[1:24:58] heart because predestination is god not
[1:25:01] forcing you to be a believer but god
[1:25:04] acknowledging and writing down that he
[1:25:06] saw in you from the foundation of the
[1:25:09] world that you believed his word and he
[1:25:11] says i write record of this that they
[1:25:14] are a believer
[1:25:16] hallelujah
[1:25:18] amen what is it this bride of christ
[1:25:20] those spiritual beings are there any
[1:25:22] spiritual beings here this morning that
[1:25:24] we call brother and sister what are they
[1:25:27] they're wrapped in the word and not of
[1:25:29] their own accord but of god's choosing
[1:25:32] amen you've all seen the poster that
[1:25:34] shows like the wedding gown that's
[1:25:35] nothing but the word everything about it
[1:25:37] the veil the gown the whatever you call
[1:25:40] it the trails out behind it it's all
[1:25:42] just the written word and they're
[1:25:44] dressed in that they're clothed in that
[1:25:46] word and so my brother and sister it is
[1:25:49] there that when we become uh through the
[1:25:52] word of god not of our own accord but
[1:25:54] it's god's business i like being part of
[1:25:56] god's business
[1:25:58] amen god's business is profitable
[1:26:00] business
[1:26:01] amen
[1:26:02] we don't do this to become overcomers
[1:26:04] you know i just preached to you have
[1:26:06] been just touching on this in the last
[1:26:08] little bit my brother and sister we
[1:26:10] don't
[1:26:11] wrap ourselves in the word
[1:26:13] to become
[1:26:15] overcomers
[1:26:18] we have always been
[1:26:20] overcomers
[1:26:23] there's a revealing taking place
[1:26:26] there's revelation if you want to word
[1:26:28] it that way taking place that is
[1:26:30] revealing to you and i that we were
[1:26:33] called to be overcomers and others say
[1:26:36] can't live the message i have to lift my
[1:26:38] hand you can get in trouble doing this
[1:26:39] because they think you're on their side
[1:26:42] somebody says i can't live this message
[1:26:44] and i'm like i can't live it either so
[1:26:46] later they send you texts like hey are
[1:26:48] you
[1:26:48] quitting what are you talking about
[1:26:51] all i did is acknowledge i can't live it
[1:26:54] but christ that has wrapped himself
[1:26:57] around me in his word and clothed me and
[1:27:01] pulled himself up so close to me he's
[1:27:04] living it and i am up in him and
[1:27:07] therefore i can live it and they go on
[1:27:09] and they say well i thought you were
[1:27:11] quitting and we're quitting we're gonna
[1:27:13] go thought you were on board with us no
[1:27:15] i'm sorry you misunderstood i can't live
[1:27:18] this i still even this morning can't
[1:27:21] live this but the word the word that's
[1:27:24] been wrapped around me and has bound me
[1:27:27] to christ is living it
[1:27:30] amen then i don't have to go out and be
[1:27:33] up and down in my struggle oh my heart
[1:27:36] my spirit it might be i'm gonna use the
[1:27:38] word depressed forgive me now i might be
[1:27:40] a little depressed when i know i have
[1:27:42] come short of the glory of god but
[1:27:44] there's something in me says my mercies
[1:27:47] are new every morning and i get up the
[1:27:50] next morning and something inside of me
[1:27:52] says today will be different i'm one
[1:27:55] step closer to the lord i'm one step
[1:27:58] deeper into his word and he is that much
[1:28:00] deeper into me
[1:28:02] hallelujah
[1:28:04] wrapped in the word you see not our own
[1:28:07] accord
[1:28:09] but god's choosing
[1:28:11] my
[1:28:13] see not to try and become the overcomer
[1:28:16] because we're already
[1:28:18] right
[1:28:19] as brother brown brings it out says you
[1:28:21] know what if god jesus christ was
[1:28:22] standing right here tonight he couldn't
[1:28:24] heal you
[1:28:26] do you realize how stunning that was to
[1:28:28] the denomination in that day
[1:28:31] if jesus christ was here tonight he
[1:28:33] couldn't heal you
[1:28:36] you know people rejected that
[1:28:38] said oh no
[1:28:40] if jesus was here tonight
[1:28:42] he could heal me
[1:28:44] but then the prophet of god lays this
[1:28:46] out
[1:28:47] and says he couldn't heal you because he
[1:28:49] has already
[1:28:51] healed you
[1:28:54] so it's not another kind of healing
[1:28:58] oh my brother and sister
[1:29:01] do you realize
[1:29:11] brother stephen coffey
[1:29:16] made some comments
[1:29:18] i thought were very interesting
[1:29:21] he said he went to israel was there in
[1:29:24] all the holy places on the mount at the
[1:29:27] tomb
[1:29:28] all these holy places
[1:29:30] and he said he felt a bit of
[1:29:32] disappointment
[1:29:34] and he thought what is what is wrong
[1:29:35] with me
[1:29:38] disappointed
[1:29:41] then he recounts another time
[1:29:43] that he went to brother branham's tomb
[1:29:45] and went to the tabernacle
[1:29:47] and he's there brother branham's
[1:29:49] tombstone
[1:29:51] and there was kind of an emotion there
[1:29:52] but still
[1:29:54] something missing
[1:29:58] this young man must not have the holy
[1:29:59] ghost right this is not moving him he's
[1:30:01] standing in a prophet's grave
[1:30:04] goes to the tabernacle moved but not
[1:30:07] really a disappointment
[1:30:12] and then it struck him
[1:30:15] you see being
[1:30:17] on the mount didn't move him
[1:30:20] being in the tomb didn't move him
[1:30:22] being at a gravestone didn't moving
[1:30:25] because that's not where god is
[1:30:28] those is holy ground
[1:30:31] sacred to god but that's not where god's
[1:30:34] dwelling he is dwelling in you and i
[1:30:38] amen that's where god's at today my
[1:30:40] brother and sister he's not in a cave
[1:30:42] he's not on a mountaintop he's not by
[1:30:45] the sea he's not there he's in you and i
[1:30:49] today
[1:30:50] hallelujah i'll tell you that stirs my
[1:30:52] heart makes me so happy hallelujah
[1:30:56] hallelujah
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:58] now look we we come and you would say
[1:31:02] well you know i i just
[1:31:04] i just want to be victorious i want to
[1:31:07] have any of you ever felt that in your
[1:31:09] flesh usually after a great battle has
[1:31:11] come and you're like oh lord i want to
[1:31:12] be victorious can someone say amen to
[1:31:14] that i want to be victoria but you know
[1:31:17] my brother and sister they they just
[1:31:19] sang this special song today amen now i
[1:31:22] might not get the words as they sung
[1:31:24] them exactly right forgive me but you
[1:31:26] know what sometimes what god said and
[1:31:28] what we thought he said can end up being
[1:31:31] two different things we thought god said
[1:31:33] if i was good enough i would heal you if
[1:31:36] i'm good enough he'll deliver me if i'm
[1:31:39] good enough he'll do but that's not what
[1:31:41] he said
[1:31:42] amen he already from his own life his
[1:31:46] own sacrifice what he did for you and i
[1:31:50] and amen i'm telling you my brother and
[1:31:52] sister sometimes we're not giving enough
[1:31:54] value to the things that god has already
[1:31:57] done we should be rising up and saying
[1:32:00] he is my healer he is my deliverer he is
[1:32:05] my victory
[1:32:07] and people say i don't feel victorious
[1:32:09] you are victorious because you are in
[1:32:12] him and he is in you and he's already
[1:32:14] conquered it all you are victorious you
[1:32:18] don't have to look around and say lord
[1:32:19] give me something that i would feel
[1:32:22] victorious it's up to you to declare it
[1:32:25] it's up to you to say i believe what he
[1:32:27] said i believe the word as it's revealed
[1:32:30] i believe this and i am victorious
[1:32:33] and if you don't think so just ask god
[1:32:35] to rewind the last 10 years
[1:32:39] of your life
[1:32:40] and tell me god's not been present
[1:32:43] with you
[1:32:48] hallelujah
[1:32:50] here we come down to our special song
[1:32:52] today
[1:32:56] what i have
[1:32:59] done in your life what i've given you
[1:33:04] it cannot
[1:33:08] will not
[1:33:09] shall not
[1:33:12] return void
[1:33:17] now if god sent the seed out and placed
[1:33:19] it in your life
[1:33:22] do you want to be the first one to
[1:33:23] declare you know what
[1:33:25] i had the revealed word
[1:33:27] and it wasn't enough
[1:33:32] sorry i'll flee from that one
[1:33:34] hallelujah because i can take you right
[1:33:36] in the message where the prophet of god
[1:33:37] maybe i even put that in this sermon
[1:33:39] today prophet to god to tell you
[1:33:41] whatever you confess is what you'll be
[1:33:43] i'll tell you what the word opened up
[1:33:45] the life that's in the word i'm
[1:33:47] victorious i'm an overcomer i am healed
[1:33:50] i am everything i have no spirit of
[1:33:52] depression i have no spirit of anxiety
[1:33:55] because the word said that's been taken
[1:33:57] from me and i believe the word over my
[1:34:00] own emotion and my own circumstance and
[1:34:03] my own feeling i'll tell you just so
[1:34:05] you'll understand here this morning i
[1:34:07] haven't hardly been able to get out of
[1:34:09] bed because that sciatic nerve has been
[1:34:12] so enraged that i moan and groan and
[1:34:14] even get tears trying to function but
[1:34:17] i'm telling you this morning amen my
[1:34:20] wife has prayed for me this morning
[1:34:22] brother jason prayed for me in the back
[1:34:24] room and i'm declaring this morning i've
[1:34:26] got victory that demon is not going to
[1:34:29] stop me from standing here and preaching
[1:34:31] this word to you i don't care what my
[1:34:34] brain registers as pain i've declared it
[1:34:37] defeated in the name of jesus christ
[1:34:40] hallelujah
[1:34:41] you're already
[1:34:43] an overcomer and by the word you're
[1:34:45] already victorious so why don't we live
[1:34:47] out what the word says about us
[1:34:50] oh come on my brother and sister
[1:34:53] oh
[1:34:54] [Applause]
[1:34:55] hallelujah
[1:34:58] anybody ready for homework
[1:35:03] go home if you would please i ask you
[1:35:05] from the depths of my heart
[1:35:07] i don't want to guilt or force anyone
[1:35:09] but read all of isaiah 55.
[1:35:14] from beginning to end
[1:35:16] but isaiah 55 11.
[1:35:19] i don't
[1:35:20] i don't know if the brothers caught it
[1:35:21] it's not here on the board
[1:35:24] i don't know if they had that did they
[1:35:25] have that in there
[1:35:28] no probably not
[1:35:30] because i wrote it off as a side
[1:35:33] i wrote it off to the side on the end of
[1:35:35] the deal there doesn't matter
[1:35:37] was it
[1:35:39] did i miss it
[1:35:41] which way
[1:35:45] somebody help us
[1:35:49] oh there we go praise the lord
[1:35:52] look at this
[1:35:53] 55 11.
[1:35:55] we're only catching a little snapshot
[1:35:58] of what god is saying right here
[1:36:00] but he says right here so shall my word
[1:36:02] be
[1:36:03] that goeth forth out of my mouth
[1:36:08] not just neo words
[1:36:10] not just any old voice
[1:36:13] god's voice
[1:36:15] god's voice
[1:36:16] it shall not return unto me void
[1:36:20] but it shall accomplish that which i
[1:36:22] please and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:36:25] where to accent it
[1:36:27] hallelujah with a confidence amen that's
[1:36:30] why i believe that that song was not
[1:36:32] ordained for wednesday night it was
[1:36:34] ordained for this morning hallelujah
[1:36:36] because my brother and sister the work
[1:36:38] that god started in us is not going to
[1:36:40] be derailed no matter the amount of
[1:36:43] minions and demons that satan could
[1:36:45] dredge out of hell will not stop this
[1:36:48] word from coming alive in you and i and
[1:36:50] what is it doing it's anchoring us it's
[1:36:53] holding us down that no matter how the
[1:36:56] storm blows from the north from the
[1:36:58] south from the east and from the west
[1:37:00] from within the church and without the
[1:37:02] church within the family and without the
[1:37:04] church out of the family within the
[1:37:07] company or wherever we were or without
[1:37:09] it no matter where it come from amen
[1:37:11] this word will not return void
[1:37:15] god's got to hold to you and i he's got
[1:37:17] a halt of our life he's got a halt of
[1:37:20] our circumstance and he says i wrote my
[1:37:22] word and my word was written
[1:37:25] to encourage you
[1:37:27] to strengthen you
[1:37:29] to deliver you my brother and sister
[1:37:31] this word is not for the unbeliever
[1:37:34] you've seen it before in the quotes i
[1:37:36] can't think of the sermon off top my
[1:37:37] head where somebody tells brother
[1:37:39] branham i can't believe that brother
[1:37:41] brown's response is not like
[1:37:43] you're just you know this and argue the
[1:37:45] points brother brown says well it's not
[1:37:47] for the unbeliever
[1:37:49] but it's for me
[1:37:52] whether it hurts
[1:37:53] whether it rubs my hide raw or not
[1:37:56] amen i'm not throwing sister jerry under
[1:37:58] the bus but we're having conversation
[1:38:00] and i said well what about this and she
[1:38:03] just starts laughing and i thought what
[1:38:05] is her deal
[1:38:06] and she said i wasn't thinking about for
[1:38:08] me i was pitch forking it to someone
[1:38:09] else
[1:38:10] well did any of you receive that text
[1:38:15] oh i think i know who she was pitch
[1:38:16] forking it to
[1:38:19] yeah but it's all right that's what
[1:38:21] husbands and wives are for and sometimes
[1:38:23] even your own children
[1:38:25] yeah dad husband
[1:38:28] you need this well
[1:38:31] sometimes we do
[1:38:33] amen
[1:38:35] hallelujah
[1:38:37] we need to be reminded
[1:38:39] that there's no way this message
[1:38:42] can return void
[1:38:47] i'd go into another thought here but i
[1:38:49] shouldn't
[1:38:50] amen now let's look here
[1:38:56] i'm trying to remember now let's go to
[1:38:58] the second half of that six
[1:39:00] and nine
[1:39:02] okay there we go
[1:39:04] now what is he doing here's a here's a
[1:39:05] fundamental shift he said but beloved
[1:39:09] we're persuaded better things of you
[1:39:12] things that accompany salvation
[1:39:14] though we thus speak amen so is god
[1:39:17] speaking to you
[1:39:18] can we today say god is speaking to me i
[1:39:22] am not of those that are going to turn
[1:39:25] back i am not of those that this word
[1:39:28] will never bring fruition in my life i
[1:39:31] am not one to lay it down and walk away
[1:39:34] i am the one this word was sent for
[1:39:38] amen but beloved we're persuaded amen he
[1:39:42] didn't say i think or i hope he's
[1:39:44] persuaded
[1:39:47] better things of you and i say that to
[1:39:49] you church today i'm persuaded of better
[1:39:51] things of the saints of grace tabernacle
[1:39:54] for god is not unrighteous to forget
[1:39:56] your work your labor of love which you
[1:39:59] have showed toward his name and that you
[1:40:01] have ministered to the saints and do
[1:40:03] minister and i remember years ago
[1:40:05] somebody saying well that's to the
[1:40:07] preachers no sir
[1:40:09] every one of you here this morning is a
[1:40:11] minister of this gospel
[1:40:13] amen called ordained of god to bring
[1:40:17] forth words of righteousness
[1:40:19] amen
[1:40:20] some are called to do it from behind to
[1:40:22] desk some are called to do it in their
[1:40:24] own living room some are called to do it
[1:40:26] in a workplace or the grocery store
[1:40:33] some beautiful stories my brother and
[1:40:34] sister we don't have time today to touch
[1:40:37] of sisters
[1:40:39] you know from the early days of the
[1:40:41] message you know you sisters sit down
[1:40:44] shut up
[1:40:46] get back in your kitchen
[1:40:50] you guys don't remember those days of
[1:40:52] the message
[1:40:53] you wonder why there's a few people are
[1:40:55] kind of leery of the message
[1:40:58] because that was the atmosphere in my
[1:40:59] childhood
[1:41:02] but what about the little sisters
[1:41:04] sitting there
[1:41:05] sorting through the fruit
[1:41:07] in the grocery store
[1:41:11] and have somebody walk up and say
[1:41:15] i hope this don't offend you but you're
[1:41:19] kind of weird
[1:41:24] how dare you call me weird
[1:41:28] i'm offended
[1:41:31] no
[1:41:33] thank you
[1:41:36] can we do that
[1:41:38] i tell the old flesh would be more like
[1:41:40] the world we live in right now i'm
[1:41:42] offended
[1:41:45] oh thank you
[1:41:47] i didn't mean that offensive i mean
[1:41:50] you have long hair
[1:41:54] like my grandma
[1:41:56] used to
[1:41:58] used to
[1:42:00] and there's most of all some
[1:42:03] something around you
[1:42:06] oh praise god
[1:42:08] it's because i followed the message
[1:42:12] you didn't expect to hear that did you
[1:42:15] i follow the message as the reason i am
[1:42:17] what i am today
[1:42:19] no
[1:42:21] the message pointed me
[1:42:23] to jesus christ
[1:42:26] and he's alive in me
[1:42:28] and to witness to a little girl
[1:42:31] and them to cry
[1:42:33] amen when we see sister andrea
[1:42:35] sister uh uh alice again
[1:42:38] ask him about the little girl at the
[1:42:40] fair
[1:42:43] tattoos rings in their nose and whatever
[1:42:45] else
[1:42:46] break away from their friends oh i'm
[1:42:48] telling the story ain't i
[1:42:51] come back
[1:42:53] please pray for my mama
[1:42:56] she's an alcoholic
[1:42:58] and her life is crashing
[1:43:02] and a little girl
[1:43:03] break into tears
[1:43:05] when they said we will pray for your
[1:43:07] mother
[1:43:09] my brother and sister you talk about the
[1:43:11] clash
[1:43:12] of the culture
[1:43:16] but there's something real
[1:43:18] there's something real
[1:43:20] i rather doubt that little girl walked
[1:43:22] up to the man with the water filtration
[1:43:24] display
[1:43:26] and said pray for my mama she's an
[1:43:28] alcoholic and her life is crashing
[1:43:32] why god puts us in a place
[1:43:34] to perform
[1:43:36] the word
[1:43:37] you say perform that's a bad word
[1:43:38] brother paul no it is my brother and
[1:43:40] sister you see just go study what the
[1:43:42] prophet of god said about the spirit of
[1:43:44] dillinger and all of that you'll see
[1:43:46] with there's no way to be what you
[1:43:47] aren't and that's why they say actors go
[1:43:49] insane because many of them enter so
[1:43:52] much into what they're acting
[1:43:55] that they can't separate themselves from
[1:43:57] that well we're not actors
[1:43:59] we are the bride of christ we're not
[1:44:02] acting to be a bride we are a bride amen
[1:44:06] so it'll bring peace and it'll bring joy
[1:44:08] and it'll bring deliverance because
[1:44:10] we're not acting in that part we are
[1:44:12] that part
[1:44:13] hallelujah
[1:44:15] oh my somebody stole the time
[1:44:18] again y'all need to pray for me
[1:44:22] somebody just keeps coming has to be the
[1:44:24] devil just stealing my time
[1:44:35] and we desire that every one of you to
[1:44:37] show the same diligence to the full
[1:44:38] assurance of hope until the end
[1:44:41] that you be not slothful but followers
[1:44:44] of them who through faith and patience
[1:44:46] inherit the promises so we've got my
[1:44:49] brother and sister godly example before
[1:44:51] us we've got a people that we can look
[1:44:54] out it might be a parent or it might be
[1:44:57] a sibling even and it might be a
[1:44:59] grandparent or it might be a close
[1:45:01] friend to you or whatever it is but we
[1:45:04] have the scripture says been given such
[1:45:06] a great cloud of witnesses
[1:45:10] i'm telling you anybody who doesn't uh
[1:45:12] uh uh uh want to close his eyes if you
[1:45:15] if you want to open your eyes and you'll
[1:45:17] look you will see delivering power
[1:45:20] you'll see the manifestation of the word
[1:45:22] of the hour coming forth in lives around
[1:45:25] us amen so we don't have to stop and say
[1:45:27] well
[1:45:28] is it true or not just open your eyes
[1:45:31] look
[1:45:32] the devil wants you to focus on one
[1:45:34] mistake
[1:45:38] reminds me of a little story hope you
[1:45:40] don't mind me throwing some humor in
[1:45:41] there
[1:45:43] wasn't his own grandma some other
[1:45:45] grandmother comes up to a little boy and
[1:45:47] says do your parents ever fight
[1:45:49] it's like
[1:45:52] yeah
[1:45:54] my parents fight
[1:45:57] what do you what do your parents do
[1:46:00] after the fight
[1:46:02] a little boy
[1:46:06] well what do they do
[1:46:08] they kiss and make up
[1:46:13] some of you probably go ahead take that
[1:46:15] advice
[1:46:16] go ahead some of you married people take
[1:46:18] that advice home with you today okay
[1:46:21] amen when you fight it's time to kiss
[1:46:23] and make up
[1:46:24] amen not to just go well
[1:46:27] i'm not going to speak to them until
[1:46:28] they speak to me well that same devil's
[1:46:30] hanging around the chandelier so
[1:46:32] nobody's going to speak and finally you
[1:46:34] do and i was just sharing this with a
[1:46:36] brother the other day my brother and
[1:46:37] sister look what happens is you realize
[1:46:40] that when you declare a truce
[1:46:45] the war is not over
[1:46:49] let's turn this into a marriage
[1:46:51] counseling seminar here
[1:46:54] parents
[1:46:55] brothers sisters
[1:46:57] when you don't repent to one another
[1:47:00] you have declared a truce in other words
[1:47:04] we are not going to give in but the
[1:47:06] fighting will stop do you realize the
[1:47:08] warfare is still there
[1:47:10] you cannot say well you know that's just
[1:47:12] how we deal with our deals no no you're
[1:47:15] not because you've never repented
[1:47:17] the battle is still there the devil
[1:47:19] still has access to the battlefield of
[1:47:23] your mind and of your spirit because
[1:47:25] you're both too stubborn
[1:47:29] well i would have repented if he would
[1:47:30] have repented
[1:47:32] yeah
[1:47:34] the devil would have got baptized if
[1:47:36] he'd have been repented also
[1:47:40] you see it's time for us
[1:47:42] to realize
[1:47:43] god's anchoring in our life the way to
[1:47:46] deal with everything in our life
[1:47:49] the weapons of our warfare need to maybe
[1:47:52] start right in our own house where we as
[1:47:54] parents would come to a place that i
[1:47:57] know i was right it's wrong my wife is
[1:47:59] so opinionated nobody say amen
[1:48:03] my husband's so opinionated
[1:48:07] show me in the scripture who has to say

[1:48:56] message go back many times brother
[1:48:58] branham was there the holy spirit come
[1:49:00] down and there was only a little ripple
[1:49:02] on the water there wasn't a big wave
[1:49:04] rose up out in the middle of the lake
[1:49:05] and crashed to the shore to get his
[1:49:06] attention it was a still small voice it
[1:49:09] was just a stirring in the leaves of the
[1:49:12] mulberry bush it was just a quiet move
[1:49:15] of god my brother and sister what god's
[1:49:17] trying to do is anchor these principles
[1:49:20] in our life that when satan comes we can
[1:49:23] come and put up a forbiddable defense
[1:49:25] against the wiles of the devil amen
[1:49:29] you guys are all too quiet today
[1:49:31] i really i put my order in today for at
[1:49:34] least a thousand amens and you guys
[1:49:35] haven't got past 100 yet
[1:49:38] come on
[1:49:41] so we'll go quickly here
[1:49:43] look at this now these verses coming
[1:49:45] down here we just show that you would uh
[1:49:48] the same diligence to a full assurance
[1:49:50] of hope to the end that you be not
[1:49:52] swaffled but followers of them who
[1:49:55] through faith and patience inherit the
[1:49:57] promise in other words don't go follow
[1:49:59] the family over here that's made a
[1:50:01] million dollars but they're on the verge
[1:50:02] of divorce
[1:50:04] don't follow that family that is
[1:50:06] boisterous and they're gifted in this
[1:50:08] and that but they cannot come as it were
[1:50:11] and bring the presence of god into their
[1:50:13] own life my brother and sister don't
[1:50:15] follow them we get caught up and we're
[1:50:17] looking at the wrong thing and god's
[1:50:19] here standing saying all you got to do
[1:50:22] is look to me and i will make it i will
[1:50:25] anchor you and you will be able to stand
[1:50:28] every test that has come in this hour
[1:50:31] amen he made a promise to abraham verse
[1:50:34] 13 because he couldn't swear by anything
[1:50:37] greater he swear by himself and i just
[1:50:39] want to go through this real quick do
[1:50:40] you realize that god swear an oath to
[1:50:43] you
[1:50:46] oh you don't you know what a swearing an
[1:50:49] oath is
[1:50:51] somebody speak up help me
[1:50:54] a vow
[1:50:57] god swear an oath we're like god swore
[1:51:00] an oath to me yes sir
[1:51:03] he
[1:51:04] made a
[1:51:04] vow he said i'd shake heavens
[1:51:08] and earth
[1:51:09] on your behalf
[1:51:11] whatever going back whatever i've
[1:51:13] started in you
[1:51:14] i will finish
[1:51:16] you don't want paul for your savior
[1:51:18] because you can just walk into my house
[1:51:20] and you can see about 42 projects i have
[1:51:22] started not finished
[1:51:24] would you want god to be your god paul
[1:51:25] to be your god
[1:51:27] no sir you sure wouldn't
[1:51:30] you sure wouldn't
[1:51:32] but our god made a vow to us
[1:51:35] he gave an oath
[1:51:38] and that oath came in the prophet of god
[1:51:41] said god is greater than his promise
[1:51:44] can somebody say that with me
[1:51:46] god is greater than his promise
[1:51:50] amen you don't have to worry about him
[1:51:51] fulfilling that promise
[1:51:53] amen he says sure saying surely
[1:51:57] blessing i will bless thee i claim that
[1:52:00] lord
[1:52:01] multiplying i will multiply thee
[1:52:04] and so after he had patiently endured he
[1:52:06] obtained the promise
[1:52:08] that's part of that's part of this
[1:52:10] message that's part of this gospel amen
[1:52:12] god teaching us patience
[1:52:14] i always laugh about that it's a good a
[1:52:16] joke between brother jewel and i'm
[1:52:17] brother jewels like i am not praying for
[1:52:19] patience and it's like brother jewel you
[1:52:21] might as well pray for it because as a
[1:52:22] son of god god's going to give it to you
[1:52:24] anyway he goes that doesn't mean i have
[1:52:26] to ask for it
[1:52:28] now look my brother and sister
[1:52:31] we're gonna
[1:52:32] obtain it
[1:52:34] we're gonna obtain it
[1:52:37] but you're gonna have to endure it
[1:52:39] to obtain it
[1:52:40] for men verily swear by the greater and
[1:52:42] the oath for confirmation to them
[1:52:45] and end of all strife wherein god
[1:52:48] willing more abundantly to show unto the
[1:52:51] heirs of the promise the immutable
[1:52:53] mutability
[1:52:55] of his counsel
[1:52:56] con affirming it by an oath a vow
[1:53:01] now what is this immutable
[1:53:06] unable
[1:53:08] to be changed
[1:53:12] now i hope this doesn't offend any of
[1:53:13] you but i'm i'm just going to speak it
[1:53:15] anyway
[1:53:16] amen
[1:53:18] you can fire me any way you want as long
[1:53:19] as not with gasoline and a match
[1:53:23] we got a lot of voices more and more as
[1:53:25] time goes on raising up saying well
[1:53:27] brother adam meant this
[1:53:29] brother brown said this
[1:53:35] you know why they can do that saints
[1:53:40] this might sound harsh but let it be
[1:53:43] they can say that
[1:53:45] because they're not pointing you
[1:53:47] to jesus christ
[1:53:50] they are pointing you
[1:53:52] to william branham
[1:53:54] because the word declared
[1:53:57] god can't change
[1:53:59] not only that he can't change but we can
[1:54:02] take it from the position that even if
[1:54:03] he could change he wouldn't
[1:54:06] and then they come along
[1:54:09] things like
[1:54:10] preachers and marriage and divorce and
[1:54:12] gifts in the church and different things
[1:54:15] like that that they're saying well no
[1:54:17] brother branham told brother so and so
[1:54:22] come on hang on to your seat belts
[1:54:24] we've got voices in the land saying well
[1:54:27] if we understood what the prophet really
[1:54:29] was saying we don't need a five-fold
[1:54:32] ministry
[1:54:34] it's not what my bible says
[1:54:38] and my bible says god can't change
[1:54:42] so he put a five-fold ministry into the
[1:54:44] church
[1:54:45] not to lift up a five-fold ministry but
[1:54:48] that me i could irritate you
[1:54:52] that god would give you patience
[1:54:56] oh you thought it would come some other
[1:54:57] fashion
[1:55:01] but you see the voices my brother and
[1:55:02] sister the reason these people can say
[1:55:05] these kind of statements
[1:55:07] is they're not pointing you
[1:55:09] to the word
[1:55:10] which is jesus christ
[1:55:12] they're pointing you
[1:55:14] to a message
[1:55:19] even though that same message says
[1:55:22] always go back to god's written word
[1:55:26] now you say brother paul um
[1:55:29] you seem to beat on that well let me do
[1:55:32] we have a moment can i can i just make a
[1:55:34] little explanation a little defense
[1:55:37] on paul's part
[1:55:40] do you know why i keep beating on the
[1:55:41] saints
[1:55:42] some of you might think i have a grudge
[1:55:44] against people who are in this church
[1:55:45] and left
[1:55:46] but you're wrong
[1:55:47] i actually love those people
[1:55:51] but there's a spirit in the land
[1:55:54] that says
[1:55:55] just get them
[1:55:56] to change
[1:55:58] one word
[1:56:01] all it takes get them to change
[1:56:03] one
[1:56:05] word
[1:56:07] now if we was to go back to the bible
[1:56:09] and deviate off of this what does
[1:56:10] scripture say
[1:56:12] you add one word you take one word away
[1:56:16] you will find yourself in the lake of
[1:56:18] fire
[1:56:19] you think oh i don't know that you do
[1:56:21] but if you think i'm preaching against
[1:56:23] some people or some circumstance or
[1:56:25] whatever i'm trying to preach you out of
[1:56:27] the lake of fire or keep you from that
[1:56:29] because it's just one word
[1:56:32] oh not a whole new doctrine not a whole
[1:56:34] new deal we've got to write a new book a
[1:56:36] new definitions we've got to do no my
[1:56:38] brother and sister one word
[1:56:40] and when someone comes to you and i'm
[1:56:42] going to use marriage in divorce because
[1:56:43] it's it's very much present in our own
[1:56:45] community definitely present the message
[1:56:47] people are like there's nothing wrong
[1:56:49] this is this this that and brother
[1:56:50] branham forgave it in the sermon
[1:56:52] marriage in divorce no he never
[1:56:55] no he never you can't find one word to
[1:56:57] back that up
[1:56:58] not one word but i want you to take it
[1:57:01] to scripture and i want you to prove it
[1:57:02] i made this challenge to men but i tell
[1:57:04] you what my brother and sister the
[1:57:06] spirit is there well it was told to so
[1:57:09] and so who told it to so and so
[1:57:11] and you've all seen norman rockwell's
[1:57:13] painting
[1:57:14] have you
[1:57:15] if not we'll round that up and we'll put
[1:57:17] it on the screen and show it to you let
[1:57:19] me just give you a picture of that here
[1:57:21] is all these squares with all these
[1:57:22] pictures in there and it starts out with
[1:57:25] this person here
[1:57:26] a man telling a woman and a woman
[1:57:28] telling another woman woman telling a
[1:57:30] man and by the time it gets down here
[1:57:33] we've got the original people that was
[1:57:35] in this first square
[1:57:38] and you can tell man is upset
[1:57:41] why
[1:57:43] because
[1:57:44] the story
[1:57:45] changed
[1:57:47] come all the way through
[1:57:51] and when it got back to the original
[1:57:55] and the prophet of god said take it back
[1:57:57] to the written word
[1:58:01] i wouldn't care if we were best friends
[1:58:02] with the greatest minister in this
[1:58:04] message my brother and sister
[1:58:07] one word
[1:58:09] if it doesn't line up
[1:58:11] one word
[1:58:14] not one word with explanation
[1:58:17] not one word with ideology
[1:58:20] one word
[1:58:22] one word
[1:58:24] saints i'm not beating on the people
[1:58:26] i'll say this again just so close and
[1:58:27] move on it's not about the people it's
[1:58:30] about the spirit that's trying to get
[1:58:32] you on one word
[1:58:36] because the devil knows god has to hmm
[1:58:39] immutable
[1:58:41] can't change
[1:58:42] he said if you one word
[1:58:45] in or out one word
[1:58:49] and the devil's there anoint him
[1:58:51] one word but it was brother so and so
[1:58:54] and you don't understand he was no one
[1:58:56] word
[1:58:59] one word
[1:59:02] why is god doing my brother and sister
[1:59:05] he's anchoring us
[1:59:07] that when the winds of doctrines blow
[1:59:10] we're not going to be stumbled
[1:59:12] by one word
[1:59:16] come on i made this example before and
[1:59:18] i'm off here and we'll close
[1:59:20] but look at this my brother and sister
[1:59:22] look at the deception in the garden
[1:59:25] all satan did was come
[1:59:28] and took away one word
[1:59:31] lord
[1:59:33] supremacy
[1:59:35] supreme deity
[1:59:38] final authority lord
[1:59:40] removed it
[1:59:41] the minute they fell introduces it right
[1:59:44] back
[1:59:45] because this god that i got you on one
[1:59:47] word is now going to judge you and he is
[1:59:50] the supreme judge
[1:59:52] so what'd he do he depersonalized this
[1:59:54] message
[1:59:55] he took our anchor out now look
[1:59:58] i i'm willing to jump out of this real
[2:00:01] quick if you guys will let me read one
[2:00:02] more quote
[2:00:04] okay actually i should ask for two is it
[2:00:07] too late
[2:00:10] look some beautiful things
[2:00:17] i'd like you
[2:00:19] more homework is that okay you got your
[2:00:21] pen and paper go search the message out
[2:00:24] brother branham says right here let me
[2:00:26] get it up on the screen so you can at
[2:00:28] least see an authority of the word amen
[2:00:30] look this sermon up write down the notes
[2:00:32] here you can find it real easy
[2:00:34] jesus on the authority of the word
[2:00:37] amen the prophet of god talking about
[2:00:39] this my brother and sister you will see
[2:00:41] just the power that there is because the
[2:00:44] authority of the word overrules
[2:00:47] everything i don't care who says amen
[2:00:49] people say well the lord told me if it
[2:00:52] doesn't line up with the word then it
[2:00:54] wasn't the lord it was the devil come
[2:00:56] dressed up like you expected the lord to
[2:00:59] look like and gave you a word if it
[2:01:01] conflicts with the word of god
[2:01:03] so we'll we'll just skip over that amen
[2:01:06] although it's got some beautiful stuff
[2:01:08] like if you come to receive you will
[2:01:10] expecting to receive and you'll receive
[2:01:12] just what you expected to receive amen
[2:01:18] i'm telling you i it breaks my heart
[2:01:20] when i hear people say well
[2:01:22] the ministry in our church you know it
[2:01:24] just seems like this and seems like that
[2:01:27] well i'm going to turn the table i'm
[2:01:28] going to defend the preacher for a
[2:01:30] moment if y'all don't mind amen it
[2:01:32] wasn't about the preacher
[2:01:39] it's never been about the preacher
[2:01:44] y'all okay if i throw it back at you
[2:01:47] where did we come to church did we come
[2:01:49] ready to burn the house down did we come
[2:01:52] expecting the holy spirit to move from
[2:01:53] wall to wall and lift us up into
[2:01:56] heavenly places did we expect to be
[2:01:58] healed when we got to church did we
[2:02:00] expect god to deliver this one and
[2:02:02] deliver that one did we expect the holy
[2:02:04] ghost to get a grip on our young people
[2:02:07] and pull him into his presence where
[2:02:09] they couldn't resist if they wanted to
[2:02:11] or was it just another sunday
[2:02:13] that we stayed out around the bonfire
[2:02:16] too late last night and we're here today
[2:02:21] no
[2:02:22] brother paul's preaching long again
[2:02:29] what
[2:02:30] did we expect
[2:02:35] i'm telling you
[2:02:36] pardon me i'm not preaching to you but
[2:02:38] people like you in another place maybe
[2:02:41] if we were businessmen with that same
[2:02:43] approach we'd be bankrupt
[2:02:46] and we come in the house of god and walk
[2:02:48] out and say nothing stirred me today
[2:02:50] it's because we didn't expect to be
[2:02:52] stern we didn't expect for the holy
[2:02:55] ghost to come down and grip our hearts
[2:02:57] to where we couldn't help ourselves and
[2:03:00] say i love you and i need more of you no
[2:03:04] instead we're already thinking about
[2:03:05] what i'm going to do this afternoon and
[2:03:08] i've got this chore and i've got this
[2:03:10] thing and we got to do this and we're
[2:03:12] going to go out we're gonna have dessert
[2:03:15] and we'll have to drop one of those now
[2:03:16] because brother paul preached too long
[2:03:19] oh don't feel sorry for me my brother
[2:03:21] and sister you know how hard it is for
[2:03:22] me to preach this
[2:03:25] but what is our
[2:03:26] expectation what is our expectation god
[2:03:30] wants to anchor us then our expectation
[2:03:34] is every single time we are in the house
[2:03:37] of god i'm expecting the holy ghost move
[2:03:40] i'm expecting the power of the word to
[2:03:43] come and show that i've got a smudge on
[2:03:46] the hem of my garment i'm not going to
[2:03:48] say lord you're picking on me i'm going
[2:03:49] to say thank you lord you reveal the
[2:03:52] smudge
[2:03:53] thank you lord that you stirred my heart
[2:03:56] because i was getting just a little bit
[2:03:58] stoney
[2:04:00] but instead
[2:04:02] we've gone into our tradition
[2:04:08] i'll leave that rest
[2:04:12] because i really want to read another
[2:04:13] quote to you
[2:04:18] okay
[2:04:22] you know what i got a little bit of i
[2:04:25] got a little bit of dialogue here i want
[2:04:26] to share before we go into this next
[2:04:28] quote
[2:04:31] it's really what's been on my heart i
[2:04:32] walked downstairs and saw what
[2:04:35] chris we i come down here with brother
[2:04:37] isaac to help just do a couple things
[2:04:39] the other night and i saw what chris had
[2:04:41] wrote on the board for the young adults
[2:04:42] and i was like oh no
[2:04:44] oh no
[2:04:45] oh no
[2:04:46] he's coming he's burglared my house and
[2:04:49] went in my office looked at my notes
[2:04:52] that's after he preached the other half
[2:04:54] of that original sermon on wednesday
[2:04:56] night stole that from me
[2:04:58] and i was like my goodness what am i
[2:05:00] going to do with this young man
[2:05:05] so it's like okay
[2:05:06] imagine how long the service would be if
[2:05:08] i preached chris wednesday night and
[2:05:09] landed it to this morning
[2:05:12] so it's good
[2:05:13] but look you want to dislodge the devil
[2:05:15] my brother and sister you're getting a
[2:05:17] pushing shoving match with the devil do
[2:05:19] you realize saints that he is so
[2:05:21] powerful compared to us in the flesh
[2:05:24] that we go to pushing on the devil i
[2:05:26] should get jay up here an example but it
[2:05:28] embarrassed me because he'd pushed me
[2:05:29] when i shoot squeaking all the way down
[2:05:32] the aisle out the back door but you
[2:05:34] getting a push and shove match with the
[2:05:35] devil and you think i'm gonna do this
[2:05:37] look the seven sons of siva thought they
[2:05:39] were gonna walk in there and push that
[2:05:41] devil out of there and he walked him and
[2:05:44] chased him out of there stripped him
[2:05:46] almost half naked and just beat on them
[2:05:48] and they run away from that and imagine
[2:05:50] you and i gonna walk up and face the
[2:05:51] devil and tell them devil get out of
[2:05:53] here
[2:05:54] he's gonna go you know how it all starts
[2:05:57] high school or wherever it's ever been
[2:05:59] you know
[2:06:04] you don't push me around i'm a son of
[2:06:06] god
[2:06:09] and when we wake up we're like who am i
[2:06:12] and what am i doing here
[2:06:14] hmm but what happens
[2:06:18] in a tug of war
[2:06:20] a shoving match
[2:06:22] when someone
[2:06:24] is anchored
[2:06:25] oh i hope you guys can follow me here
[2:06:27] and the devil pushes you and pushes you
[2:06:30] but there reaches a point he can't push
[2:06:32] you any farther because you're anchored
[2:06:35] in the word of god you're anchored in
[2:06:37] the rock and we are there going oh this
[2:06:40] is a terrible battle i've been through
[2:06:42] but god takes that storm and turns it
[2:06:45] into victory because you're anchored in
[2:06:47] christ and the devil can't push you off
[2:06:50] of the word
[2:06:51] you're tethered you're tied you're
[2:06:54] anchored he can't push you off the word
[2:06:56] and the devil can push for so far but
[2:06:58] then it comes a point he can't push you
[2:07:00] any further because then he's got to rip
[2:07:03] the word amen out of the presence of god
[2:07:07] and break it up fracture it to push you
[2:07:10] any further and that's why god wants you
[2:07:12] and i to be anchored in this word it
[2:07:14] wants you to be settled down in that
[2:07:16] when it comes down to it become even if
[2:07:19] it's a last resort we can come and say
[2:07:22] lord it's written devil it's written
[2:07:25] it's not within me as i said earlier an
[2:07:28] old friend's saying oh you can't live it
[2:07:30] paul oh i can't live it are you gonna
[2:07:33] quit no i'm anchored
[2:07:36] i'm tied to the word i can't quit you
[2:07:39] don't understand the devil has beat me
[2:07:42] to a pulp but i couldn't be pushed off
[2:07:45] of the word
[2:07:47] because i've anchored to that word
[2:07:50] and realized it wasn't me that drove the
[2:07:52] pen
[2:07:54] amen
[2:07:57] study the concept go
[2:07:59] read what the serious
[2:08:01] dangerous mountain climbers will tell
[2:08:04] you
[2:08:05] what is the word brother chris they
[2:08:06] drive him in the rock
[2:08:09] pit on
[2:08:11] something like that
[2:08:12] do you know a serious mountain climber
[2:08:15] when it's life and death will never
[2:08:16] trust
[2:08:18] another man's
[2:08:20] revelation
[2:08:25] i remember years ago i was reading about
[2:08:27] these guys climb some mountain over in
[2:08:29] italy
[2:08:30] it's considered harder than mckinley and
[2:08:33] harder than everest and whatever
[2:08:35] because it is a spire of rock
[2:08:38] oh it's not really super tall
[2:08:41] it's a spire of rock
[2:08:43] that goes straight
[2:08:45] up
[2:08:48] and the only way you can climb it
[2:08:51] is within hope you follow this
[2:08:55] the level of your revelation is how far
[2:08:57] you can reach
[2:08:59] don't jump any higher
[2:09:01] than you can live
[2:09:04] and these guys climb
[2:09:06] and they drive these
[2:09:10] and what struck me in that story was
[2:09:12] they come to a face of a rock
[2:09:15] and there's literally hundreds
[2:09:18] of these things driven in the rock
[2:09:21] and these guys are such die-hard
[2:09:23] mountain climbers
[2:09:25] of which life is so sacred because they
[2:09:27] named
[2:09:28] dozens of their friends that have died
[2:09:30] through the years
[2:09:32] and instead of climbing right up the
[2:09:34] mountain
[2:09:35] they spent i believe it was a day and a
[2:09:36] half
[2:09:38] moving back and forth across this rock
[2:09:40] face
[2:09:41] breaking off
[2:09:43] all of the
[2:09:44] i don't know if i'm saying it right
[2:09:46] pins
[2:09:47] that others have left behind
[2:09:51] they felt an obligation
[2:09:54] to remove
[2:09:55] some
[2:09:56] they could pull out with their hands
[2:10:03] and some
[2:10:04] were led
[2:10:05] down a trail that was dead end no way to
[2:10:08] go any further
[2:10:09] and they went out there and started
[2:10:11] their way back breaking them off
[2:10:14] because
[2:10:15] they didn't want to be responsible
[2:10:18] for anyone losing their life
[2:10:21] i hope you don't mind me putting it this
[2:10:23] way
[2:10:24] from bad revelation
[2:10:28] and they spent the time
[2:10:30] to root these things out
[2:10:32] cost them a day and a half which
[2:10:34] ultimately put them in a storm
[2:10:36] and this is why brother paul is a farmer
[2:10:39] fields are flat
[2:10:41] tractors drive on fields
[2:10:45] they end up spending a day and a half
[2:10:47] in this little tent thing anchored on a
[2:10:50] perfectly straight rock face while the
[2:10:53] wind blew as the storm reports later
[2:10:55] said up to 80 miles an hour
[2:10:58] and they're basically in that pup tent
[2:11:00] you guys camped in a church camp
[2:11:03] hanging on the side of a rock
[2:11:06] huh
[2:11:07] sorry
[2:11:08] farm fields are beautiful
[2:11:14] and the only way to go up
[2:11:17] is by something anchored in the rock
[2:11:21] and the only way to live through the
[2:11:23] experience
[2:11:25] is to anchor that so deep
[2:11:27] that nothing
[2:11:29] can pull it out
[2:11:31] no storm
[2:11:33] no care of life
[2:11:36] i won't go into the whole story but one
[2:11:38] of those climbers lost a family member
[2:11:42] they got a little squawk on their radio
[2:11:45] and someone had died
[2:11:48] and a man sent in his little tent
[2:11:50] there and he cried
[2:11:54] but he had a place to cry for the
[2:11:56] challenge of his life
[2:11:59] without failing because he was anchored
[2:12:01] in that rock
[2:12:03] and even in that tragedy he didn't have
[2:12:05] another tragedy
[2:12:07] in that tragedy he was able to stop
[2:12:10] and reevaluate life
[2:12:12] and live through those things because he
[2:12:14] was anchored in that rock
[2:12:17] my brother and sister i'm sorry to keep
[2:12:19] you a little long here
[2:12:20] but you see if you plan on dislodging
[2:12:22] the devil
[2:12:24] you've got
[2:12:25] to get anchored
[2:12:27] amen you've got to come to a place that
[2:12:29] no matter how hard the storm rages
[2:12:31] around you the devil can't shove you off
[2:12:34] of the rock amen and when you're
[2:12:36] anchored in jesus oh look this is the
[2:12:38] part i get excited about when i'm
[2:12:40] anchored in jesus and i know i can't get
[2:12:41] pushed on i start pushing back
[2:12:44] amen he's got me cornered in a corner i
[2:12:46] know i can't do this it's not me oh my
[2:12:50] friend i can't live it or are you gonna
[2:12:52] quit no i'm gonna push back
[2:12:55] i can't go any farther that way i'm
[2:12:57] gonna push back because i know now
[2:13:00] anchored into the rock of jesus christ
[2:13:02] that i can push back of these little
[2:13:04] things the little fiery darts of the
[2:13:06] enemy little temptations that come i can
[2:13:09] push against that and say satan get thee
[2:13:12] behind me
[2:13:14] because you realize if satan's behind
[2:13:16] you and he starts pushing he's pushing
[2:13:17] you in the presence of god
[2:13:19] hallelujah the devil don't like to be
[2:13:21] behind you
[2:13:23] he wants to be in front of you that all
[2:13:24] you see is the devil hallelujah okay
[2:13:27] look i'm going to skip over too much of
[2:13:29] this but we're going to
[2:13:30] amen
[2:13:32] believe us thou this
[2:13:34] hallelujah there we go click on that for
[2:13:36] you brother joshua
[2:13:39] oh
[2:13:40] is this okay
[2:13:42] okay i'm starting to feel convicted
[2:13:45] about preaching too long but it's really
[2:13:46] hard saints you spent the whole week
[2:13:49] sometimes two weeks you're praying
[2:13:51] you're looking you're studying waking up
[2:13:53] in the middle of the night it's on your
[2:13:55] mind it's just really hard just to just
[2:13:57] cut it off
[2:13:59] now look at this i went into a place not
[2:14:01] long ago
[2:14:02] they were having a healing service
[2:14:04] in the back of the room
[2:14:06] the psychopathic cell
[2:14:08] i went back there there was lunatics
[2:14:10] sitting in there in their straight
[2:14:11] jackets and things
[2:14:13] and there said a beautiful young lady
[2:14:16] sitting there
[2:14:17] and i said how do you do
[2:14:18] you got your patient
[2:14:22] i'm the patient
[2:14:24] hmm
[2:14:27] i'm not gonna
[2:14:28] look to see what god's gonna do with
[2:14:30] these young people
[2:14:33] i'm not gonna look what god's gonna do
[2:14:34] for you
[2:14:37] i'm the
[2:14:38] patient when they recognize they are the
[2:14:41] patient
[2:14:43] then they can go to the doctor
[2:14:45] and be
[2:14:47] dealt with delivered their own self
[2:14:49] right that's the problem we got
[2:14:51] amen

[2:18:29] to meet a friend there's scarf coffee at
[2:18:31] starbucks waiting for me
[2:18:34] i've got to go
[2:18:36] ever notice when the holy spirit moves
[2:18:38] oftentimes the children start to cry
[2:18:41] the devil
[2:18:43] look what he says here
[2:18:46] you never touched god yet sis she said i
[2:18:48] said let's pray she got down she prayed
[2:18:50] and she prayed and tried to speak to her
[2:18:52] well brother brown she said i believe
[2:18:54] i'm going no you're not
[2:18:56] you're going out to do the same thing
[2:18:59] look lady it's the devil i said you
[2:19:02] don't want to do that a woman as pretty
[2:19:05] as you are
[2:19:07] and made i joked with jerry i hope you
[2:19:09] don't mind saying this it won't sound
[2:19:11] crass but i'm telling you my brother and
[2:19:12] sister brother branham is telling you
[2:19:15] giving a very vivid description he had
[2:19:18] looked at this girl he didn't look at
[2:19:20] her with the wrong intent or the wrong
[2:19:22] desire but he's making a declaration a
[2:19:25] young woman as pretty as you are a
[2:19:29] beautiful woman there's an emphasis
[2:19:31] there you know sometimes i think it pays
[2:19:34] that god just lets us be average
[2:19:37] yeah there's certain things that the
[2:19:38] devil just prays upon when it comes to
[2:19:40] those kind of things
[2:19:42] and a woman as pretty as you are made
[2:19:44] the way you are would be an idol for any
[2:19:47] man's heart
[2:19:50] i don't get the
[2:19:51] image
[2:19:52] that she was some dumpy
[2:19:55] girl
[2:19:58] you realize what satan had done right
[2:19:59] there
[2:20:00] he had taken her in her beauty
[2:20:02] used that against her
[2:20:04] because in satan's chosen occupation
[2:20:09] that was a plus
[2:20:11] is that too forward to speak
[2:20:14] so satan used that because in the job of
[2:20:17] a prostitute
[2:20:18] that was an attractant
[2:20:21] and satan then
[2:20:23] anointed that
[2:20:25] oh i hope you guys get this
[2:20:29] no you're not
[2:20:30] you're going out to do the same thing
[2:20:32] look lady it's the devil
[2:20:34] you don't want to do that a woman as
[2:20:35] pretty as you are made the way you are
[2:20:37] would be an idol for any man's heart
[2:20:40] don't you like to be a little mother and
[2:20:42] have some children like other ladies and
[2:20:44] she said i always wanted it brother
[2:20:46] branham now i can never have it like
[2:20:48] this
[2:20:49] you don't want to do that she said no
[2:20:52] something drives you to it that's right
[2:20:55] it's the devil she says i always thought
[2:20:57] it was
[2:20:58] but my brother and sister being able to
[2:21:00] identify it's a devil
[2:21:02] doesn't give you deliverance
[2:21:05] oh i hope that you can catch that down
[2:21:07] in the depths of your heart many people
[2:21:09] are like that's an evil spirit that's an
[2:21:11] evil spirit that does not deliver
[2:21:15] just exposing the devil
[2:21:18] now that's the devil that's the devil
[2:21:21] that's the devil
[2:21:22] won't bring deliverance
[2:21:25] just like oh i hate to even go here but
[2:21:27] i'm going to
[2:21:28] right here in this message i've been
[2:21:30] around men that would have called out
[2:21:32] your name
[2:21:33] and said you've got a devil on you
[2:21:36] and people would be like
[2:21:37] that's got to be god
[2:21:39] because i do have this thing
[2:21:45] but they never give them
[2:21:47] an avenue
[2:21:48] for deliverance
[2:21:51] you know what it does do
[2:21:53] i don't want to point any of you i'll
[2:21:54] come out here and just sit down for a
[2:21:55] month ah
[2:21:57] what it does
[2:21:59] is the devil then says now everybody
[2:22:01] knows
[2:22:04] everybody knows
[2:22:06] how can i ever face these people in
[2:22:08] church
[2:22:10] ever again
[2:22:13] and those people cause more people to
[2:22:14] quit
[2:22:15] than they ever got delivered from the
[2:22:17] spirit
[2:22:22] hmm
[2:22:25] that's why the cleansing power of the
[2:22:26] holy ghost doesn't have to call your
[2:22:28] name in public
[2:22:30] it comes down into the depths of the
[2:22:32] soul it starts its work and works its
[2:22:34] way right out
[2:22:37] and the inside out
[2:22:39] oh hallelujah
[2:22:41] i always thought it was
[2:22:43] and i said but jesus christ the son of
[2:22:45] god said in my name they shall cast out
[2:22:48] devils believe this and she said yes sir
[2:22:50] and we went to prayer there for a little
[2:22:52] bit and after a while the power of the
[2:22:54] holy ghost come and i never said a word
[2:22:57] just prayed and she raised up them big
[2:22:59] black eyes with tears drip dripping down
[2:23:02] and said brother branham some things
[2:23:05] happened to me
[2:23:06] amen this is not a religion that brings
[2:23:09] a deliverance that we don't know whether
[2:23:11] we're delivered or not we don't know
[2:23:13] whether we got the holy ghost or not we
[2:23:15] don't know whether god's real or not
[2:23:17] when god comes on the scene you know
[2:23:19] he's present
[2:23:21] amen my brother and sister i'll tell you
[2:23:23] right now i hope you don't mind but i'm
[2:23:25] tired of living some kind of powerless
[2:23:28] message

[2:23:32] street god's gonna do this god's gonna
[2:23:34] do this i'm looking my brother and
[2:23:36] sister it's not god it's us i hope that

[2:23:41] god's saints it's us not creating an
[2:23:44] atmosphere not a desperation not a
[2:23:47] desire god help us
[2:23:50] this little woman wanted delivered and
[2:23:52] she was enough that the prophet of god
[2:23:54] could deal straight with her and when
[2:23:56] she thought she had been delivered the
[2:23:58] prophet of god tells her you're going
[2:23:59] right back to where he was don't get up
[2:24:02] and walk out of here resist the urge to
[2:24:05] leave the house of god without the
[2:24:07] deliverance you came for

[2:24:12] it'll happen another day

[2:27:40] he'll do
[2:27:43] now i left out the quote
[2:27:45] where the prophet brings it out so
[2:27:46] beautifully i skipped over
[2:27:49] about the high priest
[2:27:52] but i'll close it with this right here
[2:27:54] isn't it awesome you go somewhere
[2:27:56] you go to the bank
[2:27:59] and they say
[2:28:02] well

[2:28:08] loan representative

[2:28:14] yeah we're looking for mortgage i got a
[2:28:16] personal
[2:28:18] mortgage representative
[2:28:26] i got a high priest brother trevor
[2:28:30] my high priest
[2:28:32] amen he's been assigned to me
[2:28:34] my high priest

[2:28:39] confession
[2:28:40] and he's here to bring about anything i
[2:28:44] ask in the name of jesus christ
[2:28:47] my personal representative oh don't be
[2:28:50] shocked when you find out your high
[2:28:51] priest and my high priest are the same
[2:28:53] guy but hey look he's everywhere and he
[2:28:56] covers all things

[2:29:05] and he's here to facilitate
[2:29:08] the desires of my heart

[2:29:39] your profession
[2:29:41] now if you're here saying i'm weak
[2:29:45] how's high priest going to work with
[2:29:46] that
[2:29:47] what he's got to do is show you
[2:29:49] that when you're weak he's strong so
[2:29:51] step from your position to this position
[2:29:55] and also when you're there saying i'm
[2:29:56] not much of a believer remember what

[2:35:24] we have need of deliverance
[2:35:27] i know that within our midst lord
[2:35:29] there's someone
[2:35:31] that needs a deliverance
[2:35:34] lord you don't have us preach on

[2:35:46] father whatever that need might be great
[2:35:48] or small
[2:35:50] father that we would come lord not
[2:35:53] not measuring as it is because we know
[2:35:55] that one drop of your precious blood is
[2:35:57] all that we need

[2:36:42] father that we
[2:36:44] lord might come out holy clean
[2:36:48] filled with joy filled with your holy
[2:36:50] spirit
[2:36:52] lord let us take every thing lord every
[2:36:55] sin that would so easily beset us

[2:37:05] and lord may we just take it under the
[2:37:07] blood
[2:37:09] oh your blood quenches
[2:37:12] quenches every accusation
[2:37:14] quenches every condemnation
[2:37:17] quenches everything that's not of you

[2:37:22] father
[2:37:24] lord may they not put it off for another
[2:37:26] day

[2:37:30] lord may they not have come so
[2:37:31] comfortable lord
[2:37:33] with these things in their life
[2:37:36] lord that they would disregard
[2:37:38] i believe father you laid this upon my
[2:37:40] heart
[2:37:42] i believe the burden of it's been great
[2:37:44] lord because you desired for me to
[2:37:46] preach it
[2:37:48] lord forgive me for anything lord that
[2:37:50] would have been the human
[2:37:52] but lord i know lord jesus i know father
[2:37:56] that lord when we get into your blood
[2:37:59] it changes us
[2:38:01] it delivers us it strengthens us it
[2:38:04] anchors us
[2:38:06] oh lord and i desired lord not to be
[2:38:08] blown by every wind of doctrine lord
[2:38:11] never ever slight of the devil father
[2:38:13] but to be anchored in you
[2:38:16] that lord as the times the challenges of
[2:38:18] the times become greater
[2:38:21] we're here father
[2:38:23] anchored in you
[2:38:26] not blown away
[2:38:28] by the spirit of laodicea
[2:38:32] oh then truly from our hearts lord we
[2:38:34] could sing the song
[2:38:36] i shall not be moved
[2:38:39] i shall not be moved oh lord jesus
[2:38:43] this is my prayer today lord this is my
[2:38:46] heart's desire
[2:38:48] lord this
[2:38:50] is my profession
[2:38:53] may the power of the holy spirit sweep
[2:38:55] across this church today
[2:38:59] any spirits
[2:39:01] lord any spirits lord
[2:39:04] that would cause us father
[2:39:07] lord to just
[2:39:09] become resisted
[2:39:11] any spirits lord
