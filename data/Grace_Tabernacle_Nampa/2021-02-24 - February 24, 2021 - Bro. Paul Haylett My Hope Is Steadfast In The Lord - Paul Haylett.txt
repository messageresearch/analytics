each one of you tonight amen quite a few of us missing tonight so we just ask the lord whatever circumstance might be just to go and be with our brothers and sisters just to strengthen them you know it's always nice when the presence of the lord comes around us you know you might be at work you might be in the car whatever it might be and and when that presence comes and settles around us there's just a comfort just a peace that comes and that is so beautiful so we just ask that for our brothers and sisters this evening the lord would just come and settle in around each and every one in their homes or wherever they might be tonight so let's just stand as we'd go into the word of god i just want to you know as i've been reading and looking through the book of proverbs it's just been encouraging to me actually uh just to be reminded of these things to to stir our hearts in remembrance and thank you uh brothers and sisters for uh the music amen it's always good set an atmosphere and so i would just like us to turn in proverbs 13 tonight and you know my title is not necessarily directly reflected in our thought tonight but it does tie into a verse of which we will make emphasis on but aren't you glad tonight that your hope is steadfast in the lord amen we're not wavering to and fro and and our hope is not my brothers and sisters it reminds me of a man you know um that him and his wife um kind of you know profess to be be christians and and whatnot although they've got discouraged of the church that they attended and uh one day we were just talking as men as fellow farmers and uh he was making he made a comment and something just come up in me and and i i just had to ask him this question and it actually kind of frustrated him and and he kind of spoke pretty direct to me but i just asked him i said what are you going to do when all of this investment and all this land and all our savings account and our bonds and our you know all of this what are we going to do when we wake up one morning and all of this is nothing and he said well what makes you think that'll happen i said well that's what my bible says and he says well kindly thank you but you didn't have to mention that and the thing is is it's just as startling for you and i as it would be for them right because we labor and we build and we we do all of these things and yet our trust our hope is not in this and that is what makes the difference is that we don't have it all pinned on what the stock market's doing or what real estate is doing or what is happening our hope is steadfast solid in the lord amen and that to me is i think probably the reason i can go on i can press forward every day amen let's turn our bibles proverbs 13 and 1. a wise son heareth his father's instruction but a scorner heareth not rebuke a man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth but the soul of the transgressor shall eat violence he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction the soul of the sluggard desireth and half nothing but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat a righteous man hateth lying but a wicked man is lost them and cometh to shame righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way but wickedness overthroweth the sinner there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing there is that maketh himself poor yet half great riches my that right there is a paradox the ransom of a man's life are his riches but the poor heareth not rebuke the light of the righteous rejoices but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out only by pride cometh contention but with the well advised is wisdom all saints i just want to make this comment right here that's why we should be praying i'm not talking about praying for paul or for brother david or brother chris but that's why we should be praying that the word would be preached to us that we are well advised that we don't just talk and now i'm not pointing i don't mean this towards any group or anything don't misunderstand me but we don't want to just talk about we're the bride we're going in a rapture we're go the bride we're going in a rapture we believe the message we're going in a rapture it's much deeper than that and we should be praying lord let this ministry whoever stands in these pulpits and when we're listening to the prophet let it come to us that we would be well advised that when we would face the calamities and the challenges of the age that we live in that we would understand what we see what we hear and what is going on amen and we won't do that just simply by osmosis we have to be participating hallelujah otherwise we could sleep with our bible under our pillow and that would make all the difference only by pride cometh contention but with the well advised is wisdom wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished but he that gathereth by labor shall increase hope deferred maketh the heart sick but when the desire cometh it is a tree of life who so despiseth the word shall be destroyed but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded the law of the wise is a fountain of life to depart from the snares of death heavenly father we just ask for your blessings this evening lord just may your holy spirit just move amongst us father lord for we know lord as we just reading the quotes reading the words and believing them father lord that this is not something that we can just be taught but lord this is by revelation and we ask your father just open our hearts and open our eyes our mind father that by revelation we can see clearly the whole picture and not just see the picture father but lord be what you called us to be father to bring forth the word of life bring forth the will of god amen your word is your will lord and to bring that forth in such a fashion that our lives truly would be counted as a testimony of the power of our lord jesus christ we ask for your blessings tonight in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints now you know i would like to go back here and just as i have been in the last few services i would like to just uh kind of make some commentary on some of these verses and they just they just strike me and i i'm a lord help me i'm not a very good teacher uh but you know i think that we don't have to look at ability of ourself because the word will speak for itself amen and so we just want the word to speak to us and you know it's interesting we made a comment here just uh uh in the last couple weeks you know how it seems as though we hear the advice of our fathers of our parents i should say and you know sometimes we simply have to learn the lesson for ourself and we can start from the time it's little you know you tell a child to to not touch the stove and you tell them it's hot it's hot it's hot but you know once that child uh actually touches the stove there is an understanding that comes and you know a wise son hearing his father's instruction and you know we're we're here tonight as believers as christians and you look at this and realize that the wisdom of our fathers not necessarily just natural but our spiritual fathers how that we have been uh given so much we we have a wealth we have 1200 plus sermons uh we have a ministry that's uh god has anointed with the holy ghost to to preach the word to us and this wisdom this instruction is there available and yet we'll find even as we see the supernatural taking place in our midst that there would be the scorners that would come and they they would make statements i come across this statement here just a few days ago not even intentionally but a person was saying now william branham says that you're not making to heaven unless you believe his message my brother and sister you can go all through the message you will not find a statement where brother branham says you are not making it to heaven unless you believe my message but when he speaks he's speaking in the context of the message of our lord jesus christ but yet this corner instead of looking with balance and saying you know what god's got a message and we have to believe it they would choose then to put it back to an individual and say we have to believe that man no way i'm not doing that i won't participate i won't be that you see they actually then put themself in a box because when a man is speaking the word of god this is scriptural he is not a mouthpiece of himself but he is a mouthpiece of god this is why we can trust the word of the prophets this is why the apostle paul's word rings so true to us because we know that the apostle paul was not speaking of himself when he says i paul a prisoner of christ it sure sounds like a personal thing that he's speaking but he's declaring a position or an office a duty that he's called and he's declaring i'm bound to christ i'm not bound to the synagogue i'm not bound to the high priest i'm not bound to this group or that group i'm bound to jesus christ and that's who i represent and so then when one would reject paul he is not really rejecting paul he's actually rejecting christ and so we look in the age that we live in my brother and sister and i find it interesting that the scorners usually don't show up until the voice is quieted and so it's there then they can say anything they want make any challenge they can twist the words in any way but you see they won't hear any kind of correction they don't want to hear uh the as it were explanation or the context the they have their mind made up now as we look at verse two uh i i think this is so wonderful uh i got excited about this and i i really don't want to belabor too much of any one of these because we could be here all night but a man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth now my brother and sister what do we have to offer of the fruit of our mouth we either according to the scripture out of the mouth comes either blessing or cursing amen it either comes as it is as a sweet a flavor or odor to god or it comes to a judgment and so you look at this and realize this is why the prophet of god this is why the word of god encourages us to not speak the negative right you go in there and that quote where brother branham says you know don't say i'm not a very good christian i'm weak i'm this and that he said you're talking the devil's language so he's encouraging us to speak those things that would actually be a good to eat good i am a son of god amen i am a daughter of god i the word is real to me i am alive i'm filled with the holy ghost these things actually influence us in a measure that we often can't can't or don't measure it we we don't realize what we're actually saying and and you know sometimes you realize it's just a habit and god help us to break habits can someone say amen to that you know you know you can get in a habit to you know you cut a board the wrong length or you do something wrong and you're like well that was stupid or i'm stupid or something don't speak those words amen i'm a son of god and this is in material and i will not allow what is coming from my mouth to come back to me as something bitter i want what comes out of my mouth to come back as a good let's just type it good fruit amen it was the fruit right now the word says that we would give praise or the fruit of our mouth would be praise to god let that be the fruit of our mouth saints not not of what we see wrong and right and this and that and how i feel about myself but let the fruit that comes from our mouth be something that is a blessing to yourself you say brother paul can i really bless myself well i happen to believe you can really bless yourself you can speak the words of god that god said about you and when you repeat the word of god that god spoke about you you're telling god you believe what he said about you amen if we speak the opposite of what god says about us then we're actually speaking the devil's language instead of god's language and then we wonder why these things boomerang and come right back to us any of you ever learned that one from experience yes well i have but we won't bore you tonight with the 10 000 times i have hurt my own self or hindered my own self amen so let the fruit of our lips give praise to the lord amen now it says here he that keepeth his mouth keep us his life but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction and we live in a world my brother and sister that people use the name of our savior our lord jesus christ they use the name of our god they you know use the context or connective words of damnation and they speak these things and it has become so habitual that they don't even think about it amen they could use any other word but those are the words they're conditioned i hope you follow me those are the words they're conditioned to speak i ask a man once we're actually working on a beat digger in the middle of the field and it was cold the wind blowing and it was getting to be night and uh he smashed his hand and he let forth a string of words and i just looked him in the face he was on the other side of a lifter chain about that far away from me and i just looked through the chain in his face and i said do you really want god to damn us no i don't mean it that way i said but that's what you said he said well it's just a habit i have but our habits become who we are we will be identified that my brother and sister you know the proper word to speak if you smash your hand foot head whatever it might be is ouch but if we need an alternative we could smash our hand foot or head and say praise god now the world will think you're a nut but at least we're attached to the right bolt hallelujah amen remember the little story i just read that a few days ago brother branham talking about that man you know hallelujah it's the nuts that hold it all together but praise the lord the nuts aren't just laying in the bed of the truck they're hooked to a bolt and that's what makes a truck praise the lord amen so we want to keep our mouth because that actually will speak greater to our own life now you say but brother paul what we say can be heard and be a testimony to others but i'm dealing with you tonight i'm dealing with me tonight that we would speak those things that would influence ourself amen it's not what you say my brother and sister that might cause concern amongst someone else if it's just a sinner that's never going to serve god but if you're influenced by your own words then you'll realize that the devil will handicap you now i'm not into horse racing but i just want to put this to you do you realize my brother and sister that when they run a horse when they do these kind of things to equalize it they have a person that weighs 150 pounds and one that weighs 120 pounds they add 30 pounds to that horse to to balance or equalize that they call it a handicap and so the devil would like to get you to carry every burden possible amen want you to carry every burden possible he said that he's broke the lord has said i broke the yoke of bondage i have delivered you i have brought you out i have set you free i have brought you from this uh you know from the ju in the jubilee i brought you from bondage into freedom and the only way you remain bound was you yourself stood at the post and they drove the all through your ear you see satan says if i can keep them bound if i can keep them handicapped are you with me following that example amen keep them handicapped they will never run free as they would if they were delivered completely in the name of jesus christ so the devil keeps coming along trying to put on these handicaps and we're over here volunteering oh my now i'm not preaching maybe to you tonight but it might be somebody like you or it might be your circumstance tomorrow morning amen hallelujah the soul of the sluggard desireth have nothing but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat now i find this so interesting because you know when you look at this uh uh it's kind of interesting because i i could give you a real life example of this of men that i have known and by god's grace i caught i caught something not even saying i was spiritual but i caught something out of these situations and you work with someone or you enter into an enterprise with someone and you're supposed to be contributing 50 50 and and you're supposed to be doing these things together but yet one is free to spend his money on this that and the other and always saying if i had five thousand dollars i would do this and this but you see in the time that i was associated never had five thousand dollars so it was always you might say just wishing now i don't speak highly of myself because like i said i believe it was god that that just guided me on this but i realized if i was ever going to attain that same position because i desired that same position then i had to do more than just desire it my brother and sister when the prophet of god talks about in the late hour when they start to come the denomination starts to come for the wine and the oil amen they're desiring the spirit of god they're desiring these things but you see it will take more than desire to get that to them so they're desiring a move of the holy ghost but they're not willing to pay a price they're not willing to step out and possess what the word of god says because it actually requires a sacrifice and they then kind of speaking a little blunt here they want the system of their church and the holy ghost not realizing those two don't go together so then they desire they desire they desire but they never move beyond that so they never possess the moving or the actual uh essence of the holy spirit in their life not just an anointing on the flesh but the real true holy ghost because they desire it but they don't want to give up what they have and we'll we'll talk maybe this coming sunday a little bit more on that you see the soul of the slugger desires but he doesn't do anything about it so therefore he has nothing but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat now my brother and sister we want to tie this just for a moment this diligence here amen the scripture tells us to have all diligence to make our calling an election sure in other words you are going to have to pursue this constantly day in day out never giving up relentless in your pursuit of being filled with the holy ghost amen not talking now just hearing what the prophet of god said we're not talking of an experience that happened 40 years ago that's what he uses the word yeah and it's something that happened 40 years ago we're not talking about something that happened he brings it right down we're not talking about something that happened last month but a diligence that brings us to lord i want to meet you i want to be in your presence i want to be filled with your spirit today i want to come into the supernatural today i don't even want to look back 30 days i don't want to look back to a previous service i want a day by day experience amen because you see every denomination and every individual and pardon me for just putting this blunt we can talk about what happened in brother branham's ministry uh you know in 1961 62 63 4 5 we can talk about those things and we ourselves be as dry as a husk blown in the wind rattling in the in the in the courtyard in the barnyard nothing there you know the house that blow around are always empty it won't do us any good to quote what brother branham did now my brother and sister you know me i'm not stepping away from the prophet even though he told us that we would move on from that position it's right in the message he told us you will move on from this position but you see while we study we listen and god blesses us for doing that we're not looking back to that day we're seeing where the leadership of the holy spirit was pointing us and encouraging us and filling us up to to bring us with faith to come and claim what is rightfully ours today if the prophet came on the scene today i'm absolutely convinced my brother and sister he would not be happy with us what we have done with the message we have created an atmosphere where we do a lot of looking back and i believe god would want us to look forward i believe the prophet if he was here would want us to look forward i believe he would he would kind of chastise us which might be a kind word for saying he'd whip our hides amen so you look at this now moving on here a righteous man hateth lying but a wicked man is loathsome and cometh to shame and you know when i was reading this it reminded me of something i actually learned from my dad and because that was taught to me at a young age i i looked around and uh for probably since i was about 13 or 14 years old uh this got planted in my mind and my my dad used to say son be careful of those people who will lie when the truth would serve them better now my brother and sister tell me what it is about preaching this gospel that would cause us to have any need to deviate from it that's right amen other than we the ministry struggled to line up with the word ourself so we brought the standard of the word back down to our level and then when we preached it to the people we softened as it were you might say the blow and there we made the word of none effect because the first thing you steal from it is the power of the word the prophet of god said soon as the spirit of denomination these are my own words here but as soon as the spirit of denomination is expressed or accepted it is dead oh god help us amen we want the power of god to move in our midst my brother and sister i don't care if we're talking from the front of the church to the back of the church and wall to wall we need to just buckle down and say lord help me to live it amen we don't need a compromise we don't need a watering down we don't need kind of setting a new standard what we need to do is just ask god to give us the strength and the courage to live it hallelujah amen now look as we look at this the righteous righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way so we realize it's not our own righteousness it's not anything that we can do kept us in the way right as we shared with you here a few weeks ago the word shows us that the holy spirit is the keeper of the way amen he keeps us on the path we would veer right and left and we would have all kinds of things that we would do but it's the holy ghost that comes and keeps us centered up and right here this righteousness which would be uh the righteousness of our lord jesus christ is actually what keeps us upright in the way but wickedness overthroweth the center now i'm going to throw this out and you can digest it however you want but my brother and sister you look around and everyone who forsakes holiness they don't just step down one notch it starts a slippery slope that just continually moves them away from the word of god that's a simple fact amen we don't have to point it at any group of people in a denomination you can just go and do your own research and study that that every holiness church that ever was in the united states that compromised on holiness on righteousness uh they didn't stop right there they just kept right on going see so it's a slippery slope that satan is so tricky about getting people to take the first step amen and it's a first step that that hurts amen there's an old joke about what it is about a cliff and he said is two things about a cliff that that are bad for you one is the first step and the second is the landing amen those two things only two things wrong with a cliff amen so you look at this now verse 7 would actually be a good dave ramsey lesson you know i think most of us are familiar with who dave ramsey is right a good dave ramsey lesson amen there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing and you can apply that just in the natural people can make all kinds of money now look i'm not preaching about tithes i don't know who does who doesn't i don't know how much i don't know none about that and i'm glad that i don't but i'm telling you i have from personal experience known that people who will not follow the word of god will not they have a reason well that's old testament that's this that's that i can't afford to but my brother and sister if they were just actually more in a spiritual sense if they would actually just go far enough to pull that uh how do i word that it's not theoretical it's really real even though their pants pocket might not have a hole in the pocket this one doesn't but you see when we choose to not obey the word of god this happens and that happens and this and that and that and that and this and that and that and you see i can't afford to pay tithes because i'm fixing a car i'm fixing a house i'm fixing this and i didn't have that and that failing to catch the revelation failing to catch the revelation that you can make six figure money and be broke and you can make small five figure money now we realize that too small is impossible you're not going to raise a family on 5 000 a year well i shouldn't say can't we should never say can't when god's involved with god all things are possible but you understand where i'm at but the man who makes good six-figure money might not live as well as a committed son and daughter of god on half the income or a third of the income because mentally they were not able to grasp that god makes the difference that's not it's not our money it's not how much we make it's god that makes the difference and that's why i even bring this up saints i i'm not going to preach to you about tithe you do what you want to do about that but if you got a hole in your pocket the best seamstress or the best uh whatever you would call it we're not going to gender eyes god the best fix here is to just let god sow up your pocket amen because you see it's that work of god but there is a man there is a way there is something then people do this and and yet they don't have anything and life is a struggle and there is that that maketh himself poor yet half great riches i've said this in church many times i will say it again i believe that many the reason that many of us uh are not of great wealth around the message is that it would just be a trap for a lot of us and god by his grace just keeps us where we're asking he's providing amen he's still jehovah jireh today amen and it's not just something about well i i need healing or i need this great thing to happen but jehovah jireh is here for our simplest needs amen but we have to come and we have to line up as it were or abide by the word of god amen now i think about verse 8 the ransom of a man's life or his riches when you read that superficially you're thinking well it's what the man has acquired his riches but the word of god says from the abundance of a man's mouth or abundance of his heart i mean his mouth speaks what are you going to declare as your riches that's really what it's going to come down to it's not whether you have fifty dollars in the bank or fifty thousand in the bank it's going to be what you make the riches in your life and the ransom of a man what the value there is to a man it is not necessarily that he is hostage but the ransom or the price of a man's life are his riches it reminds me of a story about a man amen lives back in kentucky and uh here he is in this day and age and and they're old now and and he they had quite a family they got i think he had seven or eight daughters four sons and you know he just always everything was about his children and he turned down good jobs that would take them from being able to go to church and and they did this their whole life and now here they are in their elderly years and uh has almost no social security has almost nothing has a little house that that is finally paid for and everybody's like what are you going to do and you never acquired you could have done this and you could have done that and the man then points to his family that's there eating together on a sunday afternoon and every one of his children and their spouses and their grandchildren are serving god and the man said i am the richest man on the face of this earth you see there's where he paced his riches it wasn't in what he acquired it wasn't what he had in a bank account but it was in his family and them serving god and he said i'm a rich guy and so a little farther deeper into the story which was shared with me uh was that this brother every one of his uh children their families every one of them contributed a certain amount of money which wasn't really that substantial every month to take care of mom and dad because we have something to uh uh thank them for we have something to do that look at the riches god's providing amen they didn't need a big house they didn't need a yacht a boat a plane a train they needed god and that's what they gave to their children amen and they've passed that on and their grandchildren are being raised in that same value system amen now verse 10 i want to just touch real quick only by pride cometh contention but with the well advised is wisdom did you just read what i read only when we have contention i'm right you're wrong this is this that is that i'm not going to talk to you i'm fussed up i got my feathers all done up pride somewhere in the equation that's what the word of god says you know we could stand and the prophet of god actually expresses this quite a few times through the message men that disagreed with him and he makes the declaration but we can still call his each other brother amen how could that be god help us you know what i'll be honest church i must have a little pride hiding in me somewhere because there's time i get my little bandy rooster feathers all up and it's like oh no you're not but you see we can actually get by without that we can sit down and say brother i'm sorry i see it differently the prophet says this here and this here and you see it this way in this way but one thing we can do is love one another but you see when pride comes in there someone's got to be wrong so that i can be right i hope i didn't step on anybody's toes there but it's scriptural amen and if it's in the word we ought to pay attention to it so really the truth is is we actually bring contention upon ourselves wealth gotten another dave ramsey lesson here wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished but he that gathereth by labor shall increase you know it's funny my brother and sister when i read that i thought you know we live in a world that has more get rich quick schemes then there are almost as many quick rich schemes as there is real jobs you know i'll just give you an example every time down in phoenix that they have one of those seminars on how to sell out people's profit property with no money of your own and make lots of money ever i can tell when they have these seminars in phoenix they just had one you say how do you know brother paul because i get 40 or 50 phone calls about selling a house i haven't owned for two years but you see these people fork out anywhere from five to seven thousand dollars to get this seminar about people like paul haylett who owns his house in phoenix arizona but lives in idaho is so disgusted with owning a house in phoenix he's going to beg you to sell his house and here's this list of all these people and will give it to you they just forgot to tell them their list is old and these people are sincere sir i can help you sell your house well that's wonderful but i haven't owned it for two years what yeah no those people who sold you on this i'm sorry i sound like a preacher probably on the phone the people who sold you on this set you up and fleeced you and you were happy and they're like okay thank you goodbye and i'm like wow do you realize the devil my brother and sister is not here to see you prosper he's here to trip you up and he's got how does that song go been offered everything that's gonna name all the wealth i'd want and worldly flame but i'd threw it back at the devil and i told him no ah man i don't know if there's a market for two-line songs or not but you see my brother and sister god don't want you to get rich easy god don't have a scheme of some multi-level sign up the whole church you'll get rich and the rest of them will all be mad that isn't what god's got he wants us my brother and sister part of the curse you say brother paul i don't want to be under the curse but you are under the curse and actually the labor that we give is very symbolic into the labor that we give as sons and daughters of god god doesn't say oh here's the holy ghost i love you all so much here's the holy ghost god wants us to get down silent cry for the sin and the abomination in the city he wants us to labor he wants us to struggle he doesn't want to crack the shell and pulling out little chick so you can have life easy he wants you to have to peck and peck and peck and back and back and push forward but we think i'm a son of god it should be easy no no one of the greatest fallacies is my problems would go away when i get saved no sir that's the start right because as we preached this last week amen it was character that's what it was and we read about esther and we read how lovely this story is and we do this but we don't comprehend what she had to go through to have her character molded to become who god wanted her to be we want to be queen but do we want this struggle amen we want to be the bride but do we want to be the one who fights to overcome we want to be these things are we willing we know it's not by work saints but are we willing to struggle are we willing to labor are we willing to fight amen and you can look around you i'll just throw this out kind of a carnal example but you see very few people that win the lotteries that these nations you know our nation canada etc puts on these great big lotteries these people win this money and they end up divorced they end up alcoholics drug addicts they end up in bankruptcy all of this stuff because it is gotten by vanity and it will be diminished but you ever look out here i'm just looking for the natural you ever look at a young man i'll tell you how it was you look at a young man my brother and sister that has labored to buy his first vehicle you're not going to find him out here jumping the curbs and and peeling out and burning his tires off he's going to be the one that says you know i work too hard for this i'm not going to do this sean listen to me buddy amen when you get that first vehicle if you get that toyota four-wheel drive or whatever it is that you've got your heart set on amen remember how much time and how much effort how many times a mow in a yard and raking weeds and post holes and this that and the other packing stuff out of a house and throwing it in a trailer all this stuff remember what it took to accomplish that and then remember that you'll have to do it again if you destroy what you got now and that's where god's at dealing with us he he tells us here if you got this by vanity it come easy come easy go amen but if you labor for it you respect it and that's why god my brother and sister let you as the bride of christ labor so hard it looks like denomination out here i was talking to a man one day he said well our pastor was preaching on this you know kind of prosperity thing and we started applying those principles and right off the bat we got this and this happened this happened this happened and i thought that's good but your pastor actually perverted the word of god to make you excited about this that turns out it was a business opportunity that was coming your way anyway and now they give credit to god two years they're divorced because the secretary of this business understood him so much better than his wife did yeah my brother and sister that's why the word of god says don't despise the wise of your youth reason she might be whole sister jerry might club me with this one but the reason she might be kind of tired and discouraged is not that she's gave up but the fact that she deals with you every day and then the young one she didn't hang around real long because she figured out what took that other lady 40 years and why it was it only took her a couple you see what i'm saying the devil oh my goodness look how rich we've got god's blessed us know my brother and sister it's like a friend of mine this is kind of contrary to this but a friend of mine when the economy crashed had an opportunity to buy a great big house six bedrooms swimming pool huge family room game room three four car garage and he says my wife wants to sell it but she doesn't i said why you want to sell the house and he says well we live in one bedroom when our grandkids visit they occupy one bedroom and we still have four more that got to be cleaned and dusted and whatever it's a waste it's the reality of it is right i'll get on home economics here but you see these spiritual lessons hard lessons answers that come from god in the midst of the battle are not soon forgotten my brother and sister they're not soon forgotten when you are struggling as it were you're right there in the midst of the battle and god comes on the scene and gives you an answer gives you encouragement you won't forget that lesson hallelujah now look here verse 12. got to hurry along here hope deferred maketh the heart sick but when the desire cometh it is a tree of life now you look at this and that scripture is pretty self-explanatory in a way you look at that that when hope something that we have is is just constantly seems to be out in front of us right the old carrot kind of approach you just never quite get there it's just always just going to be another day another this another that will somehow get this my brother and sister whether you're talking in the natural or whether you're talking spiritual that's not a way to live life looking out there we as sons and daughters of god might be praying for something you'll be praying for something right now but you should still have something stirring in your life that you know god's on the scene that god is real he's present just because god hasn't answered that prayer or given to you something you desired doesn't mean that god's not on the scene so when we put our hope on one certain thing then we will find ourselves discouraged we will find ourselves making our heart sick now brother brown says an identified christ of all ages he says that's the way we find god when we take off our pride and lay it down and walk up in the presence listen to that voice identify i am that i am i am the god of abraham isaac and of jacob i remember my promise amen that's something we're going to remember my brother and sister i remember my promise and i see the condition is right see we got to get all these things put together remember when the prophet of god had that vision he's supposed to go and pray for that baby and he goes in the house and then the woman is there and then the mother-in-law comes and brother brown starts to move forward realizes that the hat is on the chair and it's supposed to be placed up on top of the i don't remember what it was on top of a piece of furniture or whatever and so the brother branham's checked all the other conditions are all good there's the woman her mother the child but you see how to get all the conditions right and the moment that the mother-in-law i believe it was took the hat set it up on top bingo there it is everything's correct the condition is right i have come down and i'm going to speak and i'm sending you and you'll be my voice oh my and that's the way he does it what did uh what did he do it by identifying himself in his characteristics in the supernatural the supernatural sometimes is so phenomenal it gets plum away from the people the people get to be good people nice people but sometimes they misunderstand and that's what that was the same thing with joseph he couldn't understand he's a son of david but he couldn't understand that how mary could conceive now no doubt with them big pretty brown eyes looking into his face said honey i know we're engaged to be married i've got something to tell you i've had a visit by gabriel and i'm conceived by the holy spirit he told me and this thing that's going to be born will not be your son it'll be the son of god and now joseph wanted to believe that but he just couldn't believe it hardly i hope i hope you're following me you see god moving in a certain fashion and we struggle to believe that we struggle to be able to enter into the supernatural we struggle to be able to lay claim to that but you know it was unusual oh but he just couldn't believe it hardly it was too hard for him to believe now saints i don't want to speak real direct to you but i guess in a way i am i think we ought to admit to ourselves there's times that we face things that are just almost too hard to believe no wonder the devil's got a foothold we got more and more christians that are rejecting the idea of a second coming or supernatural coming of jesus christ rapture more and more are rejecting that idea more and more are reasoning well he was supposed to have come a long time ago and did you know that that spirits actually moved into the realm of the message the prophet of god said that the coming of there's nothing left but the coming of the lord jesus christ and we have went what 50 plus what would it be 55 56 people starting to waver on this could this be right he said there was nothing left well one will have to take and put this out here as a little marker god didn't show his prophets everything that's the words of a prophet god doesn't show prophets everything but you see what's happened here now is we're seeing the supernatural taking place without explanation i want you to understand how that will throw people how that can throw you for us sometimes to believe we have to understand that's a human element but when there's no explanation why has it been 56 years just dealing with a young man he might even be hearing this asking the question brother paul brother billy paul was not supposed to be an old man before there was shark swim in front of what was that building the may company i always want to say macy's the may company ask me an honest question i said brother billy paul is not he's an old man now but you see my brother and sister one you go back and search the message for that go back and find where the word of god would substantiate that was the marker for the timeline you'll find neither so you either believe until who's going to believe and tell ah catch isn't it depends on how you digest those words i'm going to believe until something else comes along brother george i don't think he'll mind me putting this way if brother branham william branham was not the man then we need to be searching for the man because the word of god promised they would be the one who come and brought the word but you see it's easier to say he's not the man and search for nothing so i'm going to believe until can i put some dots here i'm going to believe until and brother jason singing the song tonight hit it right on the head i'm going to believe until i either see him face to face or i have paw uh crossed over that riven veil i've been laid to rest you've said the words over me you've cried tears or somebody might uh you know one way i'm going to believe and tell but it's not going to be until someone's got a better explanation or until someone's got this or until someone's got that my brother and sister i'm going to believe until i see his face or i am in his presence amen hallelujah meaning in the grave so you look at that and realize my brother and sister it's there that it does now look what brother branham go on here i got sidetracked amen this thing's going to be uh will not be your son it'll be the son of god now joseph wanted to believe that but he just couldn't believe it hardly it was too hard for him to believe but you know it was unusual women don't conceive virginally so it was unusual and that's the unusual things that god does it stumbles the people it brightens it opens the eyes of some and blinds others in the same time it always did that he the unusual things an unusual way amen now he says here uh and i'm going to well is that the next quote yeah it is same sermon amen that i was looking at let me just go back here um now look my brother and sister what was birthed in mary was of the holy ghost right that's what the word tells us now i want you to see that what was birthed in you is the holy ghost too we're having this same exact phenomena taking place in the year 2021 as took place there with mary and joseph this is birthed in you of the holy ghost it's not birthed of a man could someone say amen to that not birth of a man this is not a man's idea amen no man can bring it to pass i'll tell you my brother and sister in spite of what the world thinks about the pope he has never ever singularly brought a prayer to pass in all of their generations of popes because he's just a man he's not god no matter how they raise him up to represent god he's just a man and he cannot bring that prayer to pass but i tell you tonight if you would care to lift a hand how many has had their prayers answered how many it's supernatural we're not talking about superficial we're talking supernatural amen we see god come on the scene and we realize this is not a man's idea amen now it may have been taught to you we've been taught by good ministers of this message we've been taught amen we may have had it explained in man's wisdom so that you would understand what connected to what but the prophet of god tells you this cannot be explained it must be a revelation and there's where it breaks down of why we don't have great teaching seminars i've had people say why don't we in the message have great teaching seminars because my brother and sister without revelation there is no comprehension it takes a revelation for this word to come and stir our hearts and move us to understand the word of god hallelujah amen but it's been conceived in you tell me it isn't oh tell me it isn't my brother and sister how that mere mortal people from all over were represented by by you might say all over the world tonight right here how is it the same word producing the same thing is coming to pass in your life like my life like their life like their life because it was conceived in you of the holy ghost hallelujah it was not a great man in the south a great man in the north the east or the west it was almighty god moving in the midst of his people amen i'm telling you today saints if you will stop and ponder this this as of the holy ghost is just as supernatural as mary's conception amen millions and millions and millions of people on the earth why you why do you believe it why do you see it because it was the holy ghost come down stirring your heart opening your eyes amen coming right down to bring forth the word of life the son of god once again hallelujah now if this is a holy ghost and not a man thing we don't need or want to even wait for another day what we want to do is possess the supernatural today saints we're not looking for hope to be unfulfilled we're not looking for a day when a supernatural move is moving in the message that supernatural move is right here it's right here today and it'll be just as supernatural as you and i allow it to be we don't got to wait for some certain brother to preach some certain service or some certain event to take place the holy ghost is here the prophet of god says it over and over and over that god is here he speaks of it god is here he speaks of it as jesus christ is here he speaks of it as the holy spirit is here and he also says all of this is god hallelujah it's here now how much supernatural do you want well i'll tell you how much supernatural we'll have is just exactly how much supernatural we desire no wait we're waiting for something to happen no i'm sorry my brother and sister revelation says that the spirit and the bride say come this spirit's already saying come and the bride's got a voice now and she's saying come we could be at any moment right now right into a rapture hallelujah so here it is the limiting factor of the supernatural in our midst is you and i it is not the plan of god it is not what it is we're waiting for something we're waiting for something brother paul people have been waiting my brother and sister do you know i met a man we all understand what people took of 1977 many people believed that absolutely it was coming to an end in 1977 they geared everything about their life to that i met a man that still believes it was supposed to come in 77 but something something held it up i wished i'd a voice this to him i used to not be so vocal maybe it's you sir right maybe it's you now i want to throw something at you i need to close here what if we were all you might say inspired or anointed to dig into the word into the presence of god as though it was ourself that was holding up the rapture do you follow me if you had an anointing had an inspiration that the only reason the rapture hasn't took them places my life is not ready i think we would get way way intense we would be saying lord i don't want to lord make me ready lord help me father let me get in the right position lord i want to do this we would get so sincere but you see we're all waiting and sorry i i phrase it that way but we're all waiting for something else to happen over here that would bring on the rapture that's right brother help us lord help us lord now brother branham the same sermon here quite a few paragraphs later he said i'm going to visit you talking about god according to the time of life a man that eat the flesh of a calf drink the milk from the cow eat corn cakes drinking milk a man dust on his clothes sitting there with his back turned to the tent said where is sarah thy wife said she's in the tent behind you and sarah said me an old woman as i am 100 years old as husband and wife has ceased long have pleasure with my lord and him old too in the bible said well stricken has been years and years she was 45 years past menopause or longer than that maybe 55 years past menopause and me have pleasure with my husband as a young woman she laughed up her sleeve you know and what that man that men in that human flesh said why did sarah laugh what happened abraham called that man elohim almighty god represented in a human being jesus our lord said as it was in the days of love so shall it be at the coming and watch when the son of man is being manifested man known luke 17 when the son of man in the last days is being revealed the son of man being revealed his gospel is identifying as it was in the days of lot look how they're doing now now look where this this fits right to our day saints look how they're doing now perverted nations oh my look at the homosexuals look at what we got now the church is a mess the nation is a mess and the whole thing god is belching it up from top bottom of the earth the whole thing is a mess geographically also in the material the scene is set isn't it time for god to come back in human flesh the word that's sharper than two-edged sword and the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart to appear on the scene to make jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it's a promised word that's been lotted for this day we're living in this day god is here with us to manifest that and make it true now my brother and sister i'll close on that right there sister emmy if you'll come could it be that we could actually how would i say this have an intensity that maybe we've never experienced before oh i'm not talking about an intensity just so we all jump and shout and run around the church or intensity of of you know speaking loudly or quoting scripture but an intensity to just submit ourself uh intensity to get up and i i saints i'm preaching to myself an intensity to get up in the morning and say lord let me die today a little more than i was yesterday lord let me just come into that place as the quote said earlier and come into that condition into that atmosphere saints also i'm trying to communicate that's all i'm trying to encourage we see the signs of the time whether kamala harris is the the testimony or the words of the prophet talking about the scarlet dress and talking about a woman in authority whether she fulfills that or not my brother and sister they're trying to pass laws in our nation this is the timepiece one of the major timepieces of scripture is it will be as in the days of lot now i want to don't want to be too crude our young people here but look in the days of lot lot offered his daughters to them and they turned down the daughters and said we want the men but look at the other perversion trying to pass a law that any man could walk in a restroom behind you sisters any man could identify himself any way that he wants to and no one under the the strength of the law can do anything about it protect it [Music] you understand what it is scripture says in this day we often think saints that well well they're going to come under a strong delusion to believe a lie and so people are going to believe false doctrines they're going to believe this they're going to believe that look we've got big husky men i just saw a little little video clip the other day this dude must be six three six four he's got arms the size of my legs and now calls himself miss strong delusion to believe a lie utterly convinced in his mind that he was supposed to be born a woman now i don't mean to take humor out here but i'll just put it this way if he was meant to be born a woman he was meant to be born an ugly woman and the reason i say that is not to make the humor but he looks like a man because that's what he is but the person interviewing him says well if he wants to call himself miss i'll call him miss you're under a delusion too right you see but look let's not look at the flesh my brother and sister it's not a flesh warfare this is not a battle of flesh and blood this is a battle of principalities and powers of darkness [Music] and what has helped this same anointing my brother and sister and this might sound legalistic forgive me but this same anointing of men and women and the way they dress and the way they act and how what they do with their bodies and all of this stuff and then they come under this same anointing and call themselves christians do you realize that anointing is just as disturbing as the anointing of a man calling himself a woman and a woman calling herself a man is these people living all kinds of things having pagan symbols and pagan activities and they do this and do that and yet come and claim the name of christ sister jerry spoke at the seven women claiming one man i'm sorry i meant to close but let me just share this with you we come across a deal that just shocked both of us seven men women claiming one man is that right right in the scripture what is it isaiah 4 we were just listening to some christian music not even with this thought in mind all of a sudden sister jerry goes oh my oh my oh my and i was like what what's wrong he said do you really paul did you catch what they're saying [Music] the name of jesus these people are if i spoke their name you would you would know it the man has sung christian music forever millions and millions of records big concerts but here is him and his wife singing this song all i want all i need is the name of jesus no holy ghost no new birth nothing all i want all i need is the name and it's being spoken to the world and coliseums full of people are got their hands up crying weeping praising god all i need is the name all i need is a name i'll tell you what i need i need the life i need the nature i need his spirit i need his blood to wash over me i'm not going to settle for just a name when i can have his life hallelujah my brother and sister we're coming to the day it's coming and i don't want to be an alarmist but i'll tell you the condition of this world amen i laugh at myself when i think how years ago i was like look at this it's it's sodom it's sodom look at this look at this oh my back then wasn't even a fraction of what it is now hallelujah okay i i will i'll just stop i've got some other things here oh my goodness my oh my let's just stand praise the lord sing a song or two before we're dismissed is that okay amen don't mean to keep you late but i tell you sometimes you just get excited you can't help yourself you just see what's coming i'll tell you you know i don't know how many of you use a planner right you know like a day planner a calendar or whatever many of you do many of those you know the brothers in the message have have done those i know um the one coffee brother has made a nice one and

going to separate the wheat the tares i'm here to shock you to tell you right now that's taking place right this moment that is not a future event it is happening right here as we speak it is

hallelujah hallelujah well god bless you brother tim sister when i woke this morning i oh victory is mine it's victory it's mine told is to get me behind oh joy today it is his happiness is mine oh happiness is foreign amen do we got a little victory in the camp hallelujah you know when israel had victory in the camp they shouted oh i'll tell you saints let it out you don't got to hold it in let the world know god saved you filled with the holy ghost amen he secured you said he sealed you to the day of your redemption you don't have to worry about it slipping away you don't have to worry about some fraudsters stealing your identity because unless they go through the blood they'll never have your identity before the one and only that matters hallelujah well i can i will i do believe amen [Music] to that jesus heals me now i'm trusting only in the lord i'm trusting in the lord that jesus heals me now [Applause] [Music] [Music] now i'm trusting only in in the lord that jesus fills

precious name hallelujah i just want to just uh kind of a little prayer for our brother scott roberts sister kristen's dad i know i'm gonna get beaten up for this but he's coming up here to celebrate
