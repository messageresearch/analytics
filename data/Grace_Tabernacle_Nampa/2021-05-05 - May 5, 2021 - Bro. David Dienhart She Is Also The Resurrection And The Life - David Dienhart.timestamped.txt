[24:18] the word i'm thankful for
[24:20] this time i have and just to express
[24:23] what god laid in my heart i had
[24:25] something that's been on my mind for
[24:27] my heart here for about two or three
[24:28] weeks four weeks
[24:31] and thought that's the way it would go
[24:32] and the lord was opening that really
[24:34] quickening that to me further this
[24:36] morning when i got home it changed
[24:37] completely
[24:39] and i feel like the lord wanted me to
[24:41] bring this and then next
[24:42] the next time we speak the lord willing
[24:45] i'd like to bring
[24:46] the other so god knows how to do things
[24:49] just right
[24:51] he knows what the people need and who's
[24:53] here
[24:54] and i felt it would be more appropriate
[24:56] maybe to bring the next one
[24:58] when everybody on a sunday was was
[25:01] present but tonight
[25:03] this is the revelation of the hour
[25:06] amen and we just are thankful we have
[25:08] the revelation of the album the message
[25:10] of the hour
[25:12] the unveiling of the word which we are
[25:15] by grace here again by grace through
[25:17] faith
[25:18] a part of i'm so thankful for that
[25:22] to know who we are and it's becoming
[25:25] clear and clear and that's what's taking
[25:28] us
[25:29] in a rapture and that's where we're
[25:32] standing today and i'm thankful for that
[25:34] time
[25:35] let's just bow our heads for a word of
[25:36] prayer our heavenly father as we
[25:39] as we open the bible here lord any man
[25:42] as your prophet said can open the bible
[25:44] but it takes the holy spirit to break it
[25:46] to open it up to reveal it and father we
[25:49] know that a message in this hour has
[25:51] come forth
[25:52] a full revelation of jesus christ so
[25:55] that we can go
[25:56] home lord and we know without the
[25:58] unveiling of yourself there be no
[25:59] rapture
[26:01] so we thank you lord for the
[26:03] completeness
[26:04] of the revelation and this hour that
[26:06] you've hid in the back part of your mind
[26:08] and held it and would make it known in
[26:11] this hour when the book would be taken
[26:13] and the claim made on your bride we
[26:16] thank you for this lord we thank you for
[26:18] mercy
[26:19] and grace now father bless your word
[26:22] open my mouth to what you want said
[26:24] close it to what you would not have said
[26:26] i'm dependent upon thee lord i have no
[26:29] ability in myself
[26:30] i'm strictly an instrument of yours and
[26:33] lord as far as i know completely
[26:35] submitted to you
[26:37] and lord jesus i pray that you would
[26:39] open your word in the hearts of these
[26:41] believers tonight
[26:42] by revelation we pray that you would
[26:44] reveal it there is a people here have
[26:46] the ability to hear from god
[26:48] and we are thankful for them lord and
[26:50] thankful to be a part of this
[26:52] great unveiling of yourself that will
[26:54] take us right into a body change
[26:57] lord so thankful for that revelation of
[27:00] rapture
[27:02] that is progressing increasing
[27:05] lord day by day blessed be your name and
[27:08] for your glory
[27:09] we pray amen amen turn with me to second
[27:13] corinthians the fourth chapter
[27:15] i have a couple scriptures and i'll let
[27:17] you be seated
[27:18] i want to title this an interesting
[27:21] title but
[27:22] and very straightforward she is talking
[27:25] of the bride she
[27:26] is also the resurrection and the life
[27:30] she is also the resurrection and the
[27:33] life
[27:34] amen now that's a little that that may
[27:37] choke some carnal believers
[27:39] but i don't believe there's carnal
[27:40] believers here i believe we can receive
[27:42] the word for the hour and time we're in
[27:45] because we're not talking about humanism
[27:47] here we're talking about the unveiling
[27:49] of the word
[27:50] and and it's not a human knowledge it's
[27:52] not some human exercise and
[27:54] and something we're we're learning by
[27:57] man's teaching
[27:58] this is the this is what's known by the
[28:00] revelation of the word given by
[28:02] the spirit spoken through a prophet
[28:05] amen i i just thankful for the spoken
[28:07] word because we wouldn't make it in a
[28:09] rapture without spoken word
[28:11] the original seed and that's what's
[28:13] coming our day
[28:14] and that's what's that's what's called
[28:16] us and that's what's
[28:18] that's what's bringing us home amen
[28:22] so ii corinthians 4
[28:25] and um let's see
[28:29] believe we start with the 16th verse
[28:33] let's just start with the 13th i just go
[28:36] back to that point right there
[28:40] so then death or excuse me we having the
[28:43] same spirit
[28:44] i just want to put emphasis on that of
[28:46] faith same
[28:48] spirit of faith according as it is
[28:51] written i believed and therefore have i
[28:53] spoken isn't that just exactly what true
[28:57] confession is
[28:58] amen that's what god acts on
[29:02] that's why the bible said hold fast the
[29:04] confession of your faith
[29:06] amen he said
[29:09] because it's not it's not human faith
[29:11] it's god's own faith
[29:14] the bride's faith is god's own faith we
[29:16] have the faith of god
[29:19] being born of god we have the faith of
[29:21] god amen and god is
[29:23] opening his word the faith of god in us
[29:26] is the holy spirit himself
[29:28] and god reveals himself to us as we have
[29:30] need of it
[29:31] you believe that yes absolutely he's
[29:34] he's he's already determined you to be
[29:37] in the body change
[29:39] amen so so he said
[29:42] so we having the same spirit of faith
[29:44] according as it is written i believe
[29:46] therefore have i spoken
[29:48] we also believe and therefore speak
[29:50] knowing that he
[29:51] which raised up the lord jesus shall
[29:53] raise up us
[29:54] also by jesus and shall present
[29:57] us with you for all things are for your
[30:01] sakes isn't that lovely
[30:02] that the abundant grace might through
[30:05] the thanksgiving of many
[30:07] rebound to the glory of god for which
[30:10] cause we faint not
[30:11] but though our outward man i put
[30:14] emphasis there
[30:15] for which cause we faint not but though
[30:17] our outward man
[30:18] emphasis perishes perish
[30:22] yet inward man i put emphasis on that is
[30:26] renewed revived
[30:29] renewed day by day so you're you're
[30:33] the little bride's living in a revival
[30:35] she has a revival
[30:38] amen she's in revival it's not a
[30:41] reviving
[30:43] excuse me let me just say like it's the
[30:44] reviving of what you've got
[30:48] amen it's bringing you up it's it's
[30:51] reviving it's revival going on
[30:53] in the bride it's a bride's revival it's
[30:56] actually a rapture
[30:57] revival and but the inward man
[31:00] is renewed day by day for
[31:04] our light affliction which is but for a
[31:06] moment worketh for us a far
[31:07] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[31:09] glory now i want to make i want to
[31:11] emphasize 16th verse and also the 18th
[31:14] while we look
[31:15] not we look not at the things which are
[31:19] seen now we're looking here by faith
[31:22] we're
[31:23] now now it's it's not if we look by
[31:26] faith it's not looking at things which
[31:28] are seen
[31:28] but the things which are not seen
[31:32] amen all right for the things which are
[31:36] seen
[31:36] are temporal but the things which are
[31:39] not seen
[31:41] are eternal but you're looking at it
[31:45] amen are you with me
[31:47] that's faith because faith is the
[31:49] substance of things hoped for the
[31:51] evidence of things not seen
[31:54] amen all right now
[31:58] i want you to go to the scripture with
[32:00] me in saint john 14.
[32:04] saint john 14 and i'd like to
[32:09] to read here 19 and 20.
[32:17] let's just take the 18th verse with it i
[32:20] will not leave you comfortless
[32:23] i will come to you
[32:26] yet a little while and the world seeth
[32:29] me

[32:57] change there
[32:58] yeah and if you're if you're not born
[33:00] again and predestinated to be born again
[33:02] you shall live again
[33:04] you shall live also but those that are
[33:07] in christ
[33:08] are living
[33:11] they've risen there's been a
[33:12] resurrection within them
[33:14] of the word amen is that that
[33:18] without that you wouldn't have no
[33:20] resurrection of the body
[33:22] amen is that right all right let's go on
[33:25] here a little further
[33:27] he said at that day now now a little
[33:30] while
[33:30] because i live you let me just say it
[33:33] the way the prophet because i live
[33:34] you live also ye live also
[33:38] at that day you shall know not imagine
[33:42] not hope so this is faith at that day
[33:45] you shall know
[33:46] revelation that i am in my father
[33:50] and ye and me and i in you
[33:56] now with that scripture it tells you who
[33:59] you are
[34:01] amen all right you may be seated
[34:06] faith sees what god sees
[34:12] amen faith sees what god sees faith sees
[34:15] what god wants you to see
[34:18] amen faith sees what god sees
[34:23] and faith will always humble
[34:27] itself to the word faith
[34:30] humbles itself amen
[34:34] all right brother branham on the message

[35:24] from the dead
[35:27] amen be quickened from the dead
[35:31] to be made alive in christ
[35:34] jesus by god's quickening power
[35:38] amen by what god's quickening power
[35:42] what did he come to quicken what did he
[35:43] what did he send out his word for what
[35:45] he what he what did he send himself
[35:47] forth through the word to do
[35:49] quicken his seed
[35:53] amen ephesians 1
[35:56] 4 if you'd like to turn with me to these
[35:58] scriptures ephesians 1
[35:59] 4
[36:04] very familiar scriptures but oh the
[36:07] scriptures can be familiar and that's
[36:09] good
[36:10] but it's the revelation those scriptures
[36:13] hold
[36:14] it's quickened to us
[36:17] see we don't preach the letter we preach
[36:19] the spirit
[36:22] the letter everybody's got the letter
[36:24] it's not the letter
[36:27] the letter killeth but the spirit
[36:30] to have the spirit is to have the mind
[36:32] of christ to have the mind of the letter
[36:35] the mind of the word amen all right
[36:38] according as he has chosen us where
[36:42] in him wonderful
[36:47] he has chosen us in him who's him
[36:50] eternal life
[36:52] we are chosen in him hallelujah
[36:56] before the foundation of the world see
[36:58] it didn't have anything to do with it
[37:03] didn't have a thing to do with it amen
[37:06] he chose us in him
[37:09] now is the devil going to come and take
[37:10] you out of him when he chose you in him
[37:15] like we preached one time you see the
[37:17] plague can't come nigh
[37:19] our dwelling this isn't it our dwelling
[37:22] is christ
[37:24] our habitation's in christ there's no
[37:26] plague going to come nigh that devil
[37:28] can't reach in and take you out of him
[37:31] out of that habitation brother brahm
[37:32] said christ is our temple we are his
[37:36] temple
[37:38] hallelujah amen all right
[37:41] so but because he said i live you live
[37:45] also and you're chosen in him before the
[37:48] foundation of the world that you should
[37:50] be holy and without blame
[37:53] well that's a good one who can lay
[37:56] anything to the charge of god's elect
[37:58] who can lay anything to their account
[38:00] and say you did this
[38:02] who what sin can be imputed to the elect
[38:10] hallelujah no sin imputed to the elect
[38:14] bride there's none because if you impute
[38:16] sin to the elect bride you've imputed it
[38:18] to christ
[38:21] amen and you can't impute sin to him
[38:24] he's perfect
[38:26] and so the bride in him has to be
[38:27] perfect
[38:29] the bride in him would be what he is she
[38:32] can be in him and not be what he is
[38:34] all right with that so the so the
[38:38] scripture says
[38:39] i mean the yes the scripture says that's
[38:41] what i'm talking about
[38:42] tonight but the prophet said this said
[38:45] it several places
[38:46] different little different ways it says
[38:48] all that he was
[38:51] we are all that he was
[38:55] we are she is also the resurrection in
[38:59] the life
[39:00] all right saint john 11
[39:04] saint john 11
[39:08] verse 25 26 this is jesus at the grace
[39:12] of grave of lazarus
[39:14] jesus said unto her this is martha said
[39:16] unto martha
[39:18] i am the resurrection and the life
[39:22] he that believeth in me
[39:26] now the prophet noted that in me when he
[39:29] quoted john 3 16.
[39:32] he said he that believeth in me
[39:36] amen he said when did we believe in him
[39:40] when were we believers in him did we
[39:43] just become a believer in him
[39:45] no we always were a believer in him we
[39:47] just had to realize it by the unveiling
[39:49] of the word for our season
[39:51] because we were predestinated to be the
[39:54] word manifested for the season
[39:57] in this hour this day is our day
[40:00] amen you were ordained to manifest the
[40:05] word for this season
[40:06] not another season not even his season
[40:09] but this season
[40:13] amen i'm talking about his season i'm
[40:16] talking about the calvary man season
[40:18] of when he came to give his life yet
[40:20] it's all christ
[40:21] in his season amen
[40:25] all right verse 26. now verse 23 again i
[40:29] am the resurrection and the life
[40:31] he that belie i was going to title this
[40:32] i am the resurrection the life and i
[40:34] thought well to make it a little more
[40:35] pointed she is also this yes
[40:38] all right i am the resurrection the life
[40:42] he that believeth in me though he were
[40:44] dead yet
[40:44] shall he live
[40:48] and whosoever liveth and believeth
[40:52] where in me shall never die
[40:57] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[40:59] shall never die
[41:01] believe this thou this the question is
[41:04] here tonight
[41:06] believe us thou this amen
[41:09] all right
[41:13] so all that he was we are every seed
[41:16] remember
[41:16] every seed will bring forth of its
[41:20] kind every seed will bring forth of his
[41:23] kind
[41:24] you have a farmer ought to say amen to
[41:26] that every seed shall bring forth of its
[41:28] own kind is that right
[41:30] you don't plant a wheat and get corn
[41:35] that's right didn't and you don't plant
[41:37] the word seed and not get the word
[41:40] jesus christ it could be planted in you
[41:41] the seed of god and not have jesus
[41:43] christ
[41:46] is that right all right
[41:49] so he said so we go on here every seat
[41:52] will bring fourth was kind
[41:54] what is this bride but he she is himself
[41:59] revealed the bride is himself
[42:04] i say eve but it wasn't eve at that time
[42:07] until she had
[42:08] cain and abel then she was the mother of
[42:10] all living that's what eve meant
[42:12] that's when he called her e but before
[42:14] that her name was adam
[42:17] adam's wife
[42:21] was the was the was adam
[42:24] revealed in morphe is that right
[42:29] she was another form of adam she
[42:32] she had the same spirit adam had amen
[42:36] amen that's right it's not another
[42:39] different body same spirit same dirt
[42:42] same flesh but a different but a
[42:44] different form
[42:47] amen but she was adam she wasn't
[42:50] identified nothing else
[42:52] she was adam if you saw her you'd see
[42:56] adam
[42:57] now this is what it had to come back to
[42:59] in this revelation of himself in this
[43:01] day
[43:02] because without that there be no rapture
[43:05] it took
[43:06] this revelation to bring about the eden
[43:08] again
[43:09] amen because when that when that's
[43:11] manifest god has a bride
[43:13] and what did it take to do that
[43:15] unveiling of himself
[43:17] all right so let's continue on the bride
[43:19] is himself revealed
[43:21] he was not only the mechanics
[43:24] god's word now see the
[43:27] god's word has the octane oh the words
[43:30] full of power yes it is
[43:33] but it's mechanics until the dynamics
[43:36] come on
[43:37] is that right so he's not only the
[43:40] mechanics he was not only the mechanic
[43:42] now put the bride here because i'm
[43:44] speaking of him the bride's the same
[43:47] he was not only the mechanics god's word
[43:49] he was the dynamics to prove it
[43:53] amen not only did was he mechanics he
[43:56] had dynamics
[43:58] not only was he not only is she mechanic
[44:01] she's
[44:01] the dynamics he said brother david she's
[44:03] not the dynamic yes she is
[44:05] she is the dynamics the prophet said
[44:08] that holy spirit in you is who you are
[44:12] he that's joined to the lord is one
[44:13] spirit
[44:15] so what's this union take talking about
[44:17] it's bringing us to that oneness that
[44:19] revelation
[44:20] the growing up into who we are
[44:24] the foundation was laid is that right
[44:26] what's the foundation upon this rock
[44:28] i will build my church the revelation of
[44:31] who i am he said
[44:32] i'll build my church and she'll grow up
[44:34] to be who i am then
[44:39] god's place god's place of worship what
[44:42] is the bride it's his body
[44:44] that's where he put his name he put his
[44:46] name in his body
[44:48] amen he put his name in his house
[44:52] in his place of worship hallelujah
[44:57] all right see we're taking god likes to
[44:59] take the fear and scare out of your body
[45:01] and all your mistakes and failures god
[45:04] likes to take it out of you say well i
[45:06] failed devil's right there i'm ready to
[45:07] accuse you isn't he
[45:08] but see we don't serve god by senses we
[45:11] can't contact god by our senses
[45:13] we contact god through
[45:17] amen faith we contact god through faith
[45:20] god's given us his faith to contact him
[45:22] amen
[45:24] amen that's right no so he said he
[45:28] he was the mechanics he was dynamics to
[45:30] prove it and as he's being the groom
[45:33] the bride has to come forth
[45:38] i'm i'm i'm bringing this out of seed is
[45:40] now there with the shock
[45:43] no out of excuse me out of the rising of
[45:45] the sun
[45:47] and he being the groom the bride has to
[45:49] come forth
[45:50] because it's a part of him glory
[45:55] it's a part of him
[46:00] and it can only be the manifestation
[46:04] what is this part of him it can only be
[46:06] the manifestation of the fulfilling of
[46:08] all the revelations and any others has
[46:10] spoke
[46:11] of the bride it can only be manifest
[46:16] see if of what spoke of the bride was
[46:19] revealed in the groom
[46:22] amen he was the fullness of the godhead
[46:24] bodily
[46:25] is that right when he went to calvary
[46:27] you were in him
[46:29] when he raised you were in him he was
[46:33] the fullness you had to be there
[46:36] amen hallelujah it's victory we're not
[46:40] fighting to get victory we have
[46:42] victory we already have victory
[46:46] we are his victory
[46:49] hello we are his victory
[46:53] amen all right so he said
[46:56] it can only manifest what this bride can
[46:58] only manifest what the groom
[47:00] it can only manifest what he is it can
[47:02] only be his character god is not going
[47:04] to have a bride
[47:05] that's different character it's going to
[47:07] be his cone character
[47:11] amen she come from the she's come from
[47:14] the same source
[47:17] what source the same source he came from
[47:22] amen as a son if we come from the same
[47:26] source
[47:28] where were you before the foundation of
[47:30] the world when the sons of god shouted
[47:32] for joy
[47:34] see where were you you were in eternal
[47:37] life
[47:38] that makes you eternal now you can't be
[47:41] eternal then and not eternal now
[47:43] but that took the word to open that up
[47:45] to you to awaken you
[47:47] to your position and your place
[47:52] because brother brown said you were born
[47:53] in sin shaped iniquity you come
[47:55] with that with that seed germ of life
[47:57] already in there
[47:58] planted but he said you were under
[48:00] darkness and darkness held it down
[48:02] held that that soul he said held over
[48:05] that soul
[48:06] but he said you were to come forth and
[48:09] he said so he
[48:10] sent the light and when he sent the
[48:12] light he said
[48:13] he said all he's got to do is get that
[48:15] soul of yours to agree with him
[48:17] and the darkness is broken
[48:20] and the life comes forth it's already
[48:23] laying there
[48:26] hallelujah i am the resurrection in the
[48:30] life
[48:32] amen the i am you and i are both
[48:35] i ams that's right exactly what we are
[48:42] amen you say well that's present tense
[48:44] that's right it's christ present day you
[48:46] know what the gates of hell are against
[48:48] the divine revelation of christ being
[48:50] here now
[48:54] hallelujah the divine revelation of
[48:56] christ being here now he said is what
[48:58] all
[48:59] hell is against satan hates that
[49:02] manifestation
[49:03] but we are here to be the manifestation
[49:06] of the word for this hour
[49:11] amen and not only this hour
[49:14] all seven ages
[49:18] we are the we are the climaxing
[49:21] manifestation of his
[49:22] revelation he climaxes it coming forth
[49:25] he coming forth
[49:26] in the form of a bride of his wife
[49:32] i wonder if you see the promise of the
[49:33] hour
[49:35] the promised word for the hour what the
[49:38] book has opened up
[49:40] is the mystery hiding in you
[49:46] amen it was always in you it's laying in
[49:48] you
[49:49] you're the mystery revealed
[49:52] that's what calls your name that's
[49:55] what's laying in the book hallelujah
[49:59] amen all right i'm not saying these
[50:01] things be cliches and all this
[50:03] this is genuine reality this isn't
[50:07] some idea it's reality
[50:15] not just a word to us anymore it's not
[50:18] just a word
[50:19] it's reality the word has become alive
[50:23] the word is alive living the bride is
[50:25] the word living
[50:27] and brother paul here it is inaction
[50:31] the bride is the word living and in
[50:34] action and how can we be an
[50:38] action without a proper preparedness of
[50:41] being
[50:42] two wings over our face and two wings
[50:44] over our feet now we can come into
[50:46] action
[50:47] when we humble ourselves to the word
[50:51] well we look not at things that are seen
[50:54] but the things which are not
[50:55] seen our focus isn't on what's seen our
[50:58] faith doesn't recognize that our faith
[51:00] recognizes
[51:01] what's not seen there's a greater vision
[51:04] here
[51:06] amen we have a greater vision than what
[51:09] we see
[51:11] we see the unseen not with these eyes
[51:16] with this eye and that's more real than
[51:19] what we see here because what we see
[51:20] here
[51:21] is just temporal
[51:25] hallelujah all right now
[51:28] see it does something the bride has to
[51:31] be manifested and if it does something
[51:34] different from the groom it isn't the
[51:35] bride
[51:37] because she is flesh of his flesh bone
[51:40] of his bone
[51:41] life of his life life of his life spirit
[51:44] of his spirit
[51:45] power of his power she is
[51:49] another person
[51:52] she is him
[51:57] she is him this is what makes the bride
[52:00] such an oddball
[52:03] this is what makes the bride a nut
[52:06] but look at the bolts she's holding
[52:08] together
[52:10] amen drawing drawing drawing what are we
[52:12] drawing the third pull is doing the
[52:14] drawing
[52:15] it's a third pull what else do we have
[52:18] to preach but the third bull
[52:20] that's right thank god he got our
[52:21] attention thank god we see the son of
[52:23] man but the revealing of the son of man
[52:25] was to unite the two together
[52:31] hallelujah all right now
[52:34] remember in communion i was going to
[52:36] read that i'll just bypass it because of
[52:37] time
[52:38] but he did say one little thing here he
[52:40] said
[52:41] where was it he said what was it he saw
[52:44] the elements of freezing elements he
[52:45] said
[52:46] there was two natures he said born of
[52:48] charles nelli branham
[52:50] but in there was another nature present
[52:51] too predestinated was in there by god
[52:54] in this body two natures in there
[52:58] is that right you are sitting here
[53:00] tonight
[53:01] born of the spirit of god with two
[53:03] natures sitting in here
[53:06] but one is greater than the other
[53:10] and you have to recognize what is the
[53:11] other what is the one that's greater
[53:14] is who you are satan's trying to hide
[53:16] that from you
[53:18] he say he wants to identify you as your
[53:20] mistakes and failures
[53:22] when that isn't how god identifies you
[53:24] at all god's already identified you in
[53:26] him
[53:28] god's already identified you perfect
[53:30] god's already identified you
[53:32] sinless if you have the holy spirit that
[53:36] wrote this word
[53:36] abiding in you the person of christ
[53:39] revealed in you
[53:41] which is who you are you are sinless
[53:45] it's a new creation it's a new race and
[53:48] he was the beginning of that race
[53:52] hallelujah he was the firstborn
[53:58] he was a spoken word birth is that right
[54:02] the the birth of jesus christ matthew 18
[54:05] or matthew 1 18 as unthis wise what
[54:08] about the birth of the bride is on this
[54:10] wise
[54:11] not physically spiritually to come into
[54:14] a physical change
[54:17] it's already begun it's already begun
[54:19] right it's already begun
[54:21] you've already got you've already have
[54:23] if you have the holy ghost you already
[54:24] have the identification
[54:25] that you've come to the blood and
[54:27] accepted without that identification
[54:29] you're not
[54:30] sure whether you come through the blood
[54:33] if you are sure that faith is in you
[54:36] god's going to identify it by giving
[54:38] you his life and then living that life
[54:40] through you
[54:41] to the hour to the time you're going to
[54:44] hear
[54:44] and receive the word for the season
[54:49] talk about a perfect evidence there it
[54:53] is
[54:54] amen all right because not everybody is
[54:57] called to receive it
[55:00] is that right not everybody's called to
[55:02] receive that
[55:04] everybody can there's a special people
[55:06] in the land today
[55:07] i say special i'm not afraid to say that
[55:10] the bride is special

[55:14] here taking place they're
[55:15] no longer going are twain they're
[55:17] becoming one
[55:18] for the wedding supper brother brahm
[55:21] said we
[55:21] are in the marriage now he said not the
[55:24] rapture the rapture is going to a
[55:25] wedding supper not the marriage he said
[55:27] we're being united now
[55:29] we're putting on the garment of his life
[55:31] now
[55:33] amen and he said the revealing of the
[55:36] son of man would unite those two
[55:38] together
[55:39] what does our message today what did he
[55:42] do he unveiled himself
[55:44] unveiled in a full revelation of himself

[57:08] that's what she's got to be that's got
[57:10] to be manifest how many know that
[57:12] and when it's manifest and you're seeing
[57:13] it you can say this day

[57:28] it's been written now it's being
[57:30] manifested
[57:32] hallelujah all right now see
[57:36] she's got to be the word not for his day
[57:38] but of this day
[57:40] that he promised would be in this day
[57:43] that he
[57:43] sent his word for to mold his bride and
[57:46] make her
[57:49] as i said upon this rock i'll build my
[57:52] church
[57:54] been laid right there and the gates of
[57:56] hell can't prevail against that
[57:58] it's a revelation of jesus christ in you
[58:01] which is who you are that is revealed in
[58:04] you that's the birth
[58:08] amen how may is with me that's the new
[58:10] birth that's the birth word

[58:35] unto me according to thy word
[58:39] all right paragraph 151
[58:42] now and brother branham said here let me
[58:44] finish this up on
[58:45] he said what was in there what was down
[58:47] inside of me
[58:49] i saw that seed and these things coming
[58:51] forth that other predestinated
[58:53] pushed in there he said what was it
[58:55] there was another william branham
[58:57] see watch what he called a little spot
[58:59] of eternal life
[59:00] down there of the genes of god
[59:04] the word of god that was placed in there
[59:06] it
[59:07] was working
[59:10] amen boy when you can come to communion
[59:14] table like that
[59:17] that's the revelation that god sees
[59:19] that's what you're testifying to on
[59:21] these sacraments
[59:23] right there that's what you're
[59:25] testifying of
[59:26] i am his and he is mine and i am one
[59:29] with his body
[59:30] i'm in fellowship with jesus christ i'm
[59:33] testifying of my faith
[59:36] i died with him i raised with him
[59:39] and everything that he did for me at
[59:41] calvary is mine
[59:44] i'm not saying come well don't take it
[59:46] if you don't feel like it i thought what
[59:47] i'm talking about you take it
[59:49] because it's a revelation brother brahma
[59:51] said you take it because it's a
[59:52] revelation that i'm a part of him and
[59:54] i'm a part of you
[59:57] and it's not a second-handed revelation
[1:00:02] somebody tell you that
[1:00:05] no it's revealed to you personally you
[1:00:08] see brother sister
[1:00:09] this is an individual
[1:00:13] it's affair a group affair it's an
[1:00:15] individual affair
[1:00:16] between you and god it's individual but
[1:00:19] there's one thing g
[1:00:20] what the lord will not do he can't lead
[1:00:22] you off his word he can do anything he
[1:00:23] wants to do
[1:00:24] in any way but he'll never lead you out
[1:00:26] of that word
[1:00:29] so you have an absolute and the absolute
[1:00:31] lives in you
[1:00:33] amen the absolute is in you
[1:00:37] living if i'm not careful i'll get into
[1:00:40] this other message that i
[1:00:42] was going into so i'll back it off a
[1:00:44] little bit but on paragraph 151 of this
[1:00:46] day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:00:48] watch the promise i said here's the
[1:00:50] promise jesus made the promise
[1:00:52] watch here he says
[1:00:56] now we found out the conditions of the
[1:00:58] world we see where the church nominal
[1:01:00] is and organization denomination we see
[1:01:03] where they are
[1:01:04] we see where the nations are we see that
[1:01:07] that's this day
[1:01:08] these promises is fulfilled of course
[1:01:10] disasters he talked about earthquakes
[1:01:12] divers places all these things being
[1:01:14] fulfilled
[1:01:16] but then he says now now now he's coming
[1:01:19] right down to the day we're in
[1:01:21] now his corner been turned here
[1:01:25] the corner has been turned out of
[1:01:26] pentecost we haven't done away with
[1:01:28] luther's message we haven't done away
[1:01:29] with wesley's message we haven't done
[1:01:31] away the pentecostal message
[1:01:32] but it's not our message of the hour the
[1:01:35] message of the hour is what those things
[1:01:37] made way for amen
[1:01:40] you have those you have luther wesley
[1:01:43] you have
[1:01:43] pentecost
[1:01:46] now what do you have the seed again
[1:01:51] the token amen
[1:01:55] because what follows it is the token
[1:01:57] himself
[1:02:00] amen amen many many men
[1:02:04] i'd like to stay on that for about
[1:02:05] another hour all right
[1:02:08] watch what he now but in this day he's
[1:02:11] identifying a day
[1:02:12] he said but in this day there is to come
[1:02:14] a super
[1:02:15] royal seed of abraham
[1:02:20] that's exactly what it would be that's
[1:02:22] exactly what
[1:02:23] it'd be would be a royal bride
[1:02:29] to the royal promised son as i spoke
[1:02:32] last night it won't be a natural seed
[1:02:35] it will be a spiritual seed
[1:02:38] amen amen which is greater the natural
[1:02:42] the spiritual
[1:02:44] amen which is eternal
[1:02:50] that's pretty easy to answer and
[1:02:54] because the natural's temporal so it
[1:02:56] won't be a natural seed
[1:02:58] it will be an eternal spiritual seed
[1:03:01] of god his own seed
[1:03:05] all right now he said as i spoke last
[1:03:08] night it will be natural be spiritual
[1:03:10] seed there is to be
[1:03:11] there is to be a royal a spiritual bride
[1:03:14] raise up
[1:03:14] which will be the royal seed of the
[1:03:17] royal
[1:03:18] faith boy there's a lot of things in
[1:03:20] this
[1:03:21] to be the royal seed of the royal faith
[1:03:24] of the abraham's royal son
[1:03:27] she is to come on the scene in the last
[1:03:30] days
[1:03:31] and the time and the place is a promise
[1:03:34] that's given
[1:03:35] to her glory to god now you see your
[1:03:39] message
[1:03:42] it's himself
[1:03:45] in bride form
[1:03:50] why does that have to come to
[1:03:51] manifestation because it's the same with
[1:03:54] adam and sarah or abraham and sarah in
[1:03:55] the natural
[1:03:56] in order to have the promised sun
[1:04:00] amen where was that sun coming through
[1:04:04] sarah abraham and sarah is that right
[1:04:08] there had to be a union made there had
[1:04:11] to be a change to have it
[1:04:16] amen then they could meet the sun
[1:04:19] what's taking place in us there's a
[1:04:22] spiritual union taking place
[1:04:24] there's an invisible union taking place
[1:04:26] in order to meet the sun
[1:04:28] we've got to have that union we are
[1:04:30] bringing forth the royal seed
[1:04:33] the royal sun
[1:04:37] without this it wouldn't come in a
[1:04:38] manifestation there would be no meeting
[1:04:40] in the air
[1:04:43] but you know what that wasn't a public
[1:04:47] show when that took place
[1:04:48] the son of man revealed himself and
[1:04:50] looked like nothing else happened
[1:04:53] and all the time we're being changed and
[1:04:54] bringing forth the sun
[1:04:58] is that right it wasn't publicly known
[1:05:00] was it wasn't a public show
[1:05:02] it wasn't known to the public it was the
[1:05:04] seventh seal right there we see it
[1:05:06] right there amen right there we see it
[1:05:10] right here
[1:05:10] revealed right in abraham and sarah
[1:05:14] you can take these seals all the way
[1:05:15] through the bible take that seventh seal
[1:05:18] go all the way through the bible with it
[1:05:19] start it in genesis right down here to
[1:05:21] where we are and we're saying this day
[1:05:22] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:05:29] satan can't have it satan can't know it
[1:05:32] satan can't know that third pull but we
[1:05:34] are
[1:05:35] in it because we are that third pull we
[1:05:37] are the open word
[1:05:41] boy that's becoming
[1:05:45] real
[1:05:49] all right but see she's to come on the
[1:05:52] scene in the last days and there's
[1:05:54] scriptures to back
[1:05:55] up revelations
[1:05:58] 10. malachi 4
[1:06:02] luke 17 30. on and on we could go
[1:06:06] all right i gotta hurry
[1:06:09] so that's to come on the scene how
[1:06:13] how would how would he make his bride by
[1:06:15] the word revealed to her alone
[1:06:17] first john first john 3 9.
[1:06:22] first john 3 9 whosoever is born of god
[1:06:27] doth not commit sin for his
[1:06:31] seed his seed
[1:06:35] couldn't be born of god without the seed
[1:06:36] you cannot be born of god without the
[1:06:38] seed there
[1:06:42] that's why many can have the anointing
[1:06:43] on their spirit
[1:06:46] the anointing of the true holy ghost
[1:06:48] anointing even be baptized in their
[1:06:50] spirit
[1:06:50] and never hear the word for the season
[1:06:53] can't hear it
[1:06:54] why because it's not in their soul
[1:07:00] they do signs miracles wonders dance
[1:07:02] shout speak in tongues and live under a
[1:07:04] denominational spirit
[1:07:06] that's exactly right
[1:07:10] i preached that last time i preached
[1:07:12] here so i'm going to go into all that
[1:07:14] i'd like to finish it don't know if i
[1:07:15] will but anyway
[1:07:18] but that's pretty obvious and pretty
[1:07:20] clear brother brown said talking about
[1:07:22] that he said that needs to be preached
[1:07:24] on in this day
[1:07:26] that's what he said it needs to be
[1:07:28] talked about and preached about
[1:07:30] amen all right but anyway let's keep
[1:07:33] going
[1:07:34] so he that's bored his seed remaineth in
[1:07:36] him
[1:07:37] and cannot he cannot sin
[1:07:40] sin is unbelief he cannot sin
[1:07:44] singular sin unbelief because he is born
[1:07:47] of god amen
[1:07:52] if you're born of god whoever whatever
[1:07:54] god is you are
[1:07:56] so you're a little god
[1:08:02] brother brown said he said i don't want
[1:08:03] to choke you but a man surrendered
[1:08:06] completely god is omnipotent
[1:08:11] that right completely submitted
[1:08:13] surrendered to god
[1:08:17] that's the full picture today that's
[1:08:19] what's happening
[1:08:20] and i don't want to start on that that's
[1:08:23] later
[1:08:25] all right john 1 13.
[1:08:28] keep that born of god john 1 13 we come
[1:08:31] back if you want to turn
[1:08:32] john chapter 1 verse 13
[1:08:36] which were born as many as received him
[1:08:39] to them gave ye power to become sons of
[1:08:41] god even to them that would believe on
[1:08:42] his name
[1:08:43] which were born not of blood nor of the
[1:08:46] will of the flesh
[1:08:48] see no denominational manhandling
[1:08:52] in the birth of the word bride
[1:08:55] virgin all right see
[1:08:58] which were born not of blood nor the
[1:09:00] will of the flesh nor of the will of
[1:09:05] the ball man makes me happy not born of
[1:09:07] the will of man
[1:09:09] no man handling in this virgin born word
[1:09:11] bride
[1:09:13] all right he said see order the will of
[1:09:16] man
[1:09:16] but of god amen and we could go to first
[1:09:20] john or first peter 1 23 and show that
[1:09:23] we were born by the word
[1:09:26] and the word will never pass away is
[1:09:28] that right
[1:09:30] that word can never pass away can never
[1:09:32] fail it can never pass away
[1:09:34] that word hallelujah
[1:09:37] that word brother brown said if you be
[1:09:39] that word you can't pass away either see
[1:09:41] because
[1:09:42] he said my word will never pass away and
[1:09:45] the word but the word of the lord
[1:09:46] we're born by an incorruptible by the
[1:09:49] word of god the seed the
[1:09:52] we're not born of corruptible see we're
[1:09:54] born of the incorrupt by the word of god
[1:09:58] which liveth and abideth forever but the
[1:10:00] word of the lord endureth forever and
[1:10:01] this
[1:10:02] is the word by which the gospel is
[1:10:03] preached unto you
[1:10:05] amen so the revelation has got to be
[1:10:07] preached
[1:10:08] you say i'm wondering how many are going
[1:10:10] to receive it those that will receive it
[1:10:12] are those that have the ability to hear
[1:10:14] it
[1:10:15] we just preach it i'm not paul isn't
[1:10:18] brother's
[1:10:19] brother here is not responsible for you
[1:10:21] receiving anything
[1:10:26] boy i don't hear any men that's amazing
[1:10:30] that's the truth you're not responsible
[1:10:32] for that you're responsible for bringing
[1:10:34] it
[1:10:35] it takes the pressure all off it stops a
[1:10:38] lot of complexes
[1:10:41] about others it can't receive it like
[1:10:43] what just goes in one ear and out the
[1:10:44] other they never change
[1:10:47] we're preaching that we're preaching
[1:10:48] that we're preaching and then never
[1:10:49] change
[1:10:51] it's not for you to change them you
[1:10:52] can't change them
[1:10:54] but you can preach it as god gives it to
[1:10:56] you you preach that faith and those that
[1:10:58] have an ear to hear will hear it and
[1:11:00] they'll be changed by that word
[1:11:02] for faith comes by hearing the word
[1:11:07] not the word for another season the word
[1:11:09] for this season
[1:11:14] amen that's right that's what has to be
[1:11:16] ministered
[1:11:18] we aren't responsible brother said for
[1:11:19] them getting it
[1:11:21] we're not responsible for them receiving
[1:11:23] it
[1:11:24] or how they act or how they respond to
[1:11:27] it
[1:11:29] well that's a good one didn't it i
[1:11:31] remember when the lord quickened that to
[1:11:32] me it just lifted a ten thousand pound
[1:11:34] weight off of me
[1:11:37] it made me have a lot of liberty to
[1:11:39] preach the word
[1:11:41] who am i to judge whether this one can
[1:11:43] receive it or not by the way they look
[1:11:45] right isn't that right who can i
[1:11:48] judge because they look at me and they
[1:11:50] how do i know what's going on in their
[1:11:51] heart
[1:11:52] but their fruit will manifest pretty
[1:11:54] soon what's in their heart
[1:11:58] you don't put anybody in you don't put
[1:12:00] anybody out i don't care how many
[1:12:01] tattoos and earrings they have on
[1:12:04] or anything else that's not putting
[1:12:05] anybody in or out
[1:12:07] you preach the truth you preach the word
[1:12:09] for the season and the bride
[1:12:10] predestinated seed for the season will
[1:12:12] receive it
[1:12:14] and not only is it being preached it's
[1:12:16] being lived
[1:12:18] it's not well i hope i live it today no
[1:12:20] you've got to live it today because
[1:12:22] you're born of god
[1:12:26] is that right and if you're not living
[1:12:28] it he'll show you you're not living
[1:12:30] and he'll correct you how many have that
[1:12:32] confidence
[1:12:34] you do anything wrong he gives us a lot
[1:12:36] of liberty if we do anything a little
[1:12:37] thing wrong
[1:12:38] he said he'll show you
[1:12:41] and what will be your response yes lord
[1:12:44] forgive me you
[1:12:45] change amen
[1:12:53] first john 5 12.
[1:12:58] first john 5 12.
[1:13:01] i thought i had a short sermon this
[1:13:02] month
[1:13:06] that's a typical statement isn't it a
[1:13:08] preacher
[1:13:10] all right now the witness of god is
[1:13:14] greater
[1:13:14] verse chapter 5 first john 5 10
[1:13:19] he that believeth on the son of god hath
[1:13:21] the witness in himself
[1:13:23] he that believes not god hath made him a
[1:13:25] liar because he believeth not the record
[1:13:27] that god gave of his son
[1:13:30] and this is the record that god has
[1:13:32] given to us
[1:13:34] eternal life
[1:13:37] god has no other record of you bride
[1:13:41] no other record satan will come up and
[1:13:45] accuse they did this and it is but
[1:13:46] god says there's no record
[1:13:50] there is no record of it all right you
[1:13:52] have one record he's given you
[1:13:54] and that's eternal life all right
[1:13:58] and this life is in his son
[1:14:03] and he who hath the son
[1:14:07] man and he who hath the son
[1:14:11] hath life
[1:14:15] and he that hath not the son of god hath
[1:14:18] not life in galatians chapter one
[1:14:22] verse
[1:14:26] verse 16. paul's saying in verse 15 but
[1:14:30] when it pleased god who separated
[1:14:32] brother brother paul said i never
[1:14:34] received what i received by man
[1:14:36] i was taught it by the revelation of
[1:14:38] jesus christ
[1:14:41] all right then he comes down the line
[1:14:43] here and he said
[1:14:44] but it when it pleased god who separated
[1:14:46] me from my mother's womb and called me
[1:14:47] by his grace
[1:14:49] to reveal that's unveil to reveal
[1:14:52] his son in me he that hath the son
[1:14:57] hath life to reveal his son in me that i
[1:15:00] might preach him
[1:15:02] among the heathen immediately i
[1:15:04] conferred not with flesh and blood
[1:15:06] how can you preach him and have no
[1:15:08] revelation
[1:15:09] of him then all you're preaching is the
[1:15:13] denominational manhandling
[1:15:17] is intellectual teaching
[1:15:21] of the message
[1:15:27] that's right exactly right and listen
[1:15:30] if if just that that old denominational
[1:15:33] spirits already put him out
[1:15:36] right that shuck put him out
[1:15:40] that denominational spirit's already
[1:15:41] done put him out
[1:15:43] you're not in there you don't belong in
[1:15:46] there
[1:15:47] you don't belong even being influenced
[1:15:50] by them
[1:15:54] and if you're not discerning what that
[1:15:56] spirit is you need a new birth
[1:15:59] that's pretty strong statement but
[1:16:01] that's the truth
[1:16:04] because you're looking at something
[1:16:05] other than the revealed word for the
[1:16:07] hour made manifest
[1:16:09] you're looking at something that's
[1:16:10] dividing not bringing unity
[1:16:12] under the word
[1:16:18] that's right i'll let the pastor pick it
[1:16:21] up from there
[1:16:22] all right when you come face to face
[1:16:27] with him the problem is not the exact
[1:16:31] word that's
[1:16:32] very close when you come face to face
[1:16:34] with him
[1:16:36] you've come to yourself
[1:16:40] you come to yourself now where do you
[1:16:43] find that brother david second
[1:16:44] corinthians 4
[1:16:45] 6 god who commanded the light to shine
[1:16:49] of the darkness has shined in our hearts
[1:16:51] to give the knowledge of the glory of
[1:16:52] god in the face
[1:16:55] of jesus christ in the very person
[1:17:00] himself
[1:17:02] there you are therefore we have this
[1:17:06] treasure
[1:17:06] in earth and vessels right there you go
[1:17:09] right there it is
[1:17:10] all right amen that the
[1:17:13] that the power is not of david or paul
[1:17:16] or
[1:17:17] anyone else it's of god
[1:17:21] we are of god little you are of god
[1:17:23] little children
[1:17:24] and have overcome them
[1:17:28] what overcome who antichrist spirit
[1:17:32] you cannot bring that denominational
[1:17:34] antichrist spirit down here
[1:17:36] no matter how nicely they are how good a
[1:17:38] people they are how nicely the dress how
[1:17:40] much they shout
[1:17:41] how much all those things and then deny
[1:17:43] the truth of the word
[1:17:44] being lived before them and being
[1:17:47] preached to before them
[1:17:48] just exactly how he's preached
[1:17:51] same spirit and say you have fellowship
[1:17:55] with that
[1:17:58] there's no fellowship with that amen
[1:18:01] where is our fellowship it's two men in
[1:18:04] one ship
[1:18:08] our fellowship isn't out here we can
[1:18:10] have human fellowship
[1:18:13] but that fellowship won't amount to
[1:18:14] nothing when it comes down to spiritual
[1:18:16] fellowship
[1:18:17] you're in the same ship therein you're
[1:18:21] just like brother brother paul and i
[1:18:23] talking on the phone like goodness sakes
[1:18:25] we'd gone all day
[1:18:27] yeah because why there was fellowship we
[1:18:30] were just
[1:18:30] there was no barrier there we just we
[1:18:32] knew we just speak something and
[1:18:34] exactly what we're speaking of others
[1:18:36] scratch your head and say i don't know
[1:18:38] what he's coming from
[1:18:41] you see there's carnal believers and
[1:18:42] then there's spiritual believers
[1:18:47] there's make believers and there's
[1:18:49] unbelievers in the message
[1:18:52] they're believers
[1:18:55] amen are you with me but there's a true
[1:18:58] believer
[1:18:59] that's the seed of god you'll say who do
[1:19:01] you think you are nothing oh
[1:19:02] well wait a minute who do i think i am
[1:19:04] nothing but who does he think i am
[1:19:07] and who do i think by his thoughts i am
[1:19:10] i'm jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:19:12] today and forever
[1:19:14] that has nothing to do with david but
[1:19:17] it's manifested through david
[1:19:20] okay and that's what stirs up the devil
[1:19:24] that's what he's trying to stop he hates
[1:19:26] the manifestation of the word because
[1:19:28] that's
[1:19:29] light and light when it's put on
[1:19:30] darkness exposes it
[1:19:33] and that's the problem right there
[1:19:35] that's what he hates
[1:19:36] he hates that manifested word for the
[1:19:39] season
[1:19:41] amen amen if i could emphasize that i
[1:19:44] would
[1:19:45] all right god has come in full view of
[1:19:47] you
[1:19:49] are ready are there any seed here
[1:19:51] children of god then god has come
[1:19:54] he has come in full
[1:19:58] full view of you
[1:20:01] the perfect then has come
[1:20:06] the veil's taken off the veil has been
[1:20:08] rent
[1:20:09] you're looking you're looking right into
[1:20:11] the glass the magnification of the word
[1:20:13] and said that's me
[1:20:15] you're looking right at him in the in
[1:20:17] the mirror of the word and saying that's
[1:20:19] me
[1:20:23] amen that's exactly what god wanted you
[1:20:25] to see
[1:20:26] that's why he unveiled himself that's
[1:20:28] why the seventh seal opened
[1:20:31] that you would recognize your day and
[1:20:33] hour that you're in
[1:20:35] when the sleeping virgin's going out
[1:20:37] there for oil trying to get it
[1:20:39] shouting and dancing all the way and
[1:20:40] trying to speak in tongues
[1:20:44] brother man i got the quote on i just
[1:20:46] read he said and they're trying to get
[1:20:47] they're trying to get oil trying to get
[1:20:50] oil and he said don't you realize that's
[1:20:52] the time the bridegroom came
[1:20:53] and left them and he said and the bride
[1:20:55] was ready and went in
[1:20:59] who makes her ready yeah how is she
[1:21:02] ready
[1:21:05] don't you realize that back here in 1962
[1:21:08] don't you realize they're trying to get
[1:21:09] oil
[1:21:10] david duplici's he said is out there
[1:21:12] trying to trying to he said
[1:21:14] my ministry brother brown has to call
[1:21:15] them out to call out of babylon
[1:21:18] to do what he said trying to get him to
[1:21:20] all thinking they're coming into a
[1:21:21] pentecostal realm of getting
[1:21:23] the oil they're trying to buy oil he
[1:21:24] said don't you realize
[1:21:26] and he said that just before and several
[1:21:28] times after
[1:21:29] he said that's when the bridegroom came
[1:21:31] don't you realize the secret the mystery
[1:21:33] of the seventh seal is this coming
[1:21:35] amen right he doesn't come out here
[1:21:38] just full blown out in front of
[1:21:40] everybody he comes in secret
[1:21:42] and that purpose of that he had to pick
[1:21:44] up his bride he had to manifest himself
[1:21:46] in bright form
[1:21:47] he had to be that coming for the rapture
[1:21:50] for the body change
[1:21:55] that's the mystery that's what's so hard
[1:21:57] for people you begin to
[1:21:59] preach that and they say oh no no oh no
[1:22:02] wait a minute
[1:22:08] it's not known to the public
[1:22:15] brother

[1:22:29] arrived

[1:22:47] be good when he comes i say he wasn't
[1:22:49] that good that he is yeah
[1:22:51] and that we're looking for a climax of
[1:22:53] that
[1:22:57] i'll let you just go in the message and
[1:22:59] search it out
[1:23:01] all right

[1:27:20] flower has bloomed to a blossom now it's
[1:27:22] seed time
[1:27:23] that's right jesus promised these things
[1:27:26] now when you see
[1:27:27] when you see god make his promise live
[1:27:29] before us and see that it's in us
[1:27:31] when you see god make his promise live

[1:27:46] the only true way you can worship
[1:27:50] how did jesus say the true worshipers
[1:27:52] worship in spirit and in truth
[1:27:54] dynamics and mechanics all right

[1:28:12] carefully
[1:28:17] i mean brother brother chris and brother
[1:28:20] paul they don't preach like i do
[1:28:24] they can't but they know the same father
[1:28:29] they can preach the same word they can
[1:28:32] preach the truth of it
[1:28:33] in the way god made them to preach it
[1:28:40] amen
[1:28:42] on these wednesdays like this this is
[1:28:43] what it does but you just get
[1:28:45] catch it you catch the revelation of it
[1:28:48] because these aren't just words these
[1:28:49] are god's thoughts expressed
[1:28:52] and he had to express them to someone
[1:28:54] might as well be you
[1:28:59] all right it's not them people
[1:29:02] see brother i'm trying to say it's not
[1:29:04] the flesh man it's not the flesh people
[1:29:06] he said the headship and the body has
[1:29:08] become one unit
[1:29:12] it's god manifested in his people that's
[1:29:15] the reason the husband and wife is no
[1:29:17] longer twain
[1:29:18] no longer twain
[1:29:24] amen no longer twain he said god in his
[1:29:27] church is one
[1:29:28] christ in you god's great revelation
[1:29:33] now that's what we're preaching on for
[1:29:36] the rest of
[1:29:37] my life is god's great revelation glory
[1:29:40] to god
[1:29:41] even bearing his name impregnated
[1:29:45] bringing forth christ amen that's what
[1:29:48] you're doing
[1:29:49] you're bringing forth christ you're
[1:29:50] bringing about that day and that meeting
[1:29:52] you're bringing it god's waiting on his
[1:29:54] bride she lays in the presence of the
[1:29:56] son
[1:29:57] in the unveiling of his word she's
[1:29:59] laying in that presence what's she doing
[1:30:04] ripening
[1:30:07] oh well i'm just too busy i can't do it
[1:30:10] you're too busy then to go on the
[1:30:11] rapture
[1:30:13] that's all there is to it satan will see
[1:30:16] to it you get busy
[1:30:17] you'll see to it that you've got other
[1:30:19] idols in front of you instead of the
[1:30:20] word
[1:30:21] you'll see to you put anything he can
[1:30:23] any kind of idol he can between you and
[1:30:24] that word
[1:30:25] and you'll bow to it and serve it
[1:30:27] instead of serving god in his word
[1:30:31] he said pretty strong you bet it's
[1:30:32] strong open get strong
[1:30:34] because that the world today message
[1:30:37] around the message arena is
[1:30:39] full of idolatry
[1:30:43] i said the message arena
[1:30:46] you bet it is
[1:30:49] and did not paul and did not peter say
[1:30:52] little children flee idolatry
[1:30:57] amen anything you put between you and
[1:30:59] god anything
[1:31:01] that comes between you and takes first
[1:31:02] place and you bow to that thing
[1:31:05] and you serve that when you could be in
[1:31:07] prayer you could be
[1:31:09] feeding on the word but you're not
[1:31:10] redeeming the time
[1:31:12] i'll just get a little evangelistic
[1:31:14] right there let's use me all right
[1:31:16] now i'm about ready to close
[1:31:20] i said about
[1:31:24] i'll just see if i bypass the headship
[1:31:26] he said is here amen
[1:31:27] christ the risen lord is here and with
[1:31:30] the same power of his resurrection that
[1:31:31] he ever was
[1:31:32] manifesting himself he said there's the
[1:31:34] devil's answer
[1:31:37] not me that liveth is christ that liveth
[1:31:39] in me there's the devil's answer
[1:31:41] he's manifesting himself he just told us
[1:31:43] where and who he was manifesting himself
[1:31:45] in
[1:31:46] and where he'd be seen and where he's
[1:31:47] unveiled today
[1:31:49] and here we are a little group but here
[1:31:53] we are
[1:31:54] rejoicing in the light of this message
[1:32:01] and when the word moves down into the
[1:32:03] body from the head what is it
[1:32:04] the same word nothing can be added or
[1:32:07] taken from it and that's
[1:32:08] exactly what denomination does they add
[1:32:11] to and take from
[1:32:13] that's the same thing i don't care if
[1:32:15] it's a hierarchy of the message
[1:32:19] in jeffersonville
[1:32:22] if they're going to add to and take away
[1:32:25] that's exactly what's happening well we
[1:32:26] don't need the fivefold ministry we'll
[1:32:28] just kind of water that down
[1:32:29] they've added to or taken away
[1:32:36] that'll cost you billy david so it cost
[1:32:38] me god will keep me.
[1:32:41] i know they don't like it but that's the
[1:32:44] truth
[1:32:45] they've lifted up they've lifted up
[1:32:47] things
[1:32:48] idols

[1:35:51] the word of promise of this day openly
[1:35:55] manifested that's a big word if you can
[1:35:59] get it see
[1:36:00] all true believers that's in the word
[1:36:03] see god
[1:36:04] openly sounds like the third pull to me
[1:36:07] doesn't it
[1:36:08] like the seven seals open
[1:36:12] the veil is rent and god stands
[1:36:16] openly before you openly before you
[1:36:21] full full view full view not partial
[1:36:24] view not dark view not a halfway view
[1:36:28] full view before you manifested
[1:36:33] brother sister there's what the bride
[1:36:35] sees
[1:36:36] what's he see she sees she sees him in
[1:36:39] her
[1:36:40] manifested she says that's who i am
[1:36:45] that's my identification i'm already
[1:36:47] identified in the rapture
[1:36:49] that identifies me in order to do this
[1:36:53] the old denominational traditional veil
[1:36:55] must be
[1:36:55] rent again so he takes his sword and
[1:36:58] rips that veil from top to bottom
[1:37:02] why top to bottom sure god did it
[1:37:06] all right you've got to come out of that
[1:37:10] stuff
[1:37:11] you'll never do it they'll keep pulling
[1:37:13] the veil before you every time
[1:37:15] oh there is nothing to that but it is
[1:37:17] written and here it is made manifest you
[1:37:19] see
[1:37:19] if you don't come out of it he said
[1:37:21] they're going to pull that veil down
[1:37:23] before you every time
[1:37:24] and there's they'll say nothing to it
[1:37:30] and then what are you doing you're
[1:37:31] listening to garbage
[1:37:36] amen all right always his word
[1:37:40] is his sword and we and he took his
[1:37:43] sword that day full of fire
[1:37:45] and ripped that veil from top to bottom
[1:37:47] he said
[1:37:48] he said but the sword of the lord see
[1:37:50] rips the veil down and you see
[1:37:52] and then you see god standing in plain
[1:37:56] view manifested
[1:38:00] in his word what a glorious view to look

[1:38:09] 10 through 12 the perfect has come

[1:38:15] come then we don't believe the seals are
[1:38:17] open
