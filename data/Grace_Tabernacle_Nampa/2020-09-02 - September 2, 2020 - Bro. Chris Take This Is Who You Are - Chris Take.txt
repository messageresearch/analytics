you musicians amen you want to always stand tonight amen the uh well let's just get this out of the way here suit coat for a preacher is just a formality praise the lord amen the song surface uh the emphasis on the bride and that we are the bride was just vindication that god truly did lay this on my heart tonight amen just right in line with what we're going to speak on tonight and i didn't get the quotes to brother alex so you forgive me for that as well you just have to uh jot it down and go make sure i said it right amen praise the lord tonight we're going to speak on this is who you are and the subtitle is are you going to accept it amen genesis chapter 24 as a believer as a son of god it's a great burden on my heart for myself and for the believers around me to realize who we are we live in a day in an age that is stricken with uh low self-confidence low self-esteem people taking their life out of desperation but the direct opposite of that is if you could just believe who you are believe what the word says about you i heard it said one time where are you going to take what the devil says about you or are you going to take what god says about you amen genesis chapter 24 verse 10 eliezer was sent by abraham to get a bride for isaac and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia under the city of nehor and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water and he said oh lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy picture i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camel's drink also let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou has showed kindness unto my master and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebecca came out who was born to bethul son of mccall the wife of nahor abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her picture and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy picture and she said drink my lord and she hastened hasted and let down her picture upon her hand and gave him drink and when she had done giving him drinks she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking and she hasted and emptied her picture into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels and so god honored the prayer of of eliezer and the request of abraham and sent the bride for isaac second timothy chapter one hmm verse six wherefore i put thing in remembrance that does throw up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind isaiah 55 verse 11 i did i just put it down here you can turn to it if you want to i'm just going to read it isaiah 55 11 says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i sent it amen let's bow our heads it's your heavenly father lord jesus you know how lord the past few days the past day has been lord the devil just doing everything he can to disrupt father forgive me calm my nerves lord jesus lord may you speak to our hearts tonight we didn't come here to hear an eloquent speech and then we didn't come here to hear somebody who speak like they have it all together because we don't father it's it's all you lord i pray that you just come now father captivate the hearts of your people lord jesus move aside every doubt lord every spirit that is contrary to your word father we take the spirit the atmosphere and the control father at the promised lord and the commandment that you have given us lord jesus and we hand ourselves over into your hands father lord do with us lord how you see fit father lord and speak to our hearts tonight lord jesus take these words lord jesus and touch the hearts of your people tonight we ask in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated tonight praise the lord this is who you are are you going to accept it so we read here about rebecca and isaac and eleazar was sent to get a bride for isaac and um he went out and he asked god the damsel that comes that gives the water to my camels then i'll know that this is the one that you have picked and we know that rebecca isaac is a type of christ and rebecca is a type of the bride and we'll come back to rebecca but i wanted to to just the focus i think tonight and what god was speaking to the lord speaking to my heart is that is about fear and um it actually came to me the other day i was uh i am i was out running and i'm i it's i'm just gonna be honest i have a fear of dogs and you would be surprised if you run through a neighborhood how many people's dogs are all over the place and i deal with it constantly and i'm learning to face my fear but i saw this this dog a little innocent old bulldog at the in the driveway of someone's house and i was like oh that if that dog wanted to chase me it could and as i ran past it i kept looking behind me to make sure it wasn't chasing me even though i knew there's no way that dog is not going to chase me it's a nice looking dog i have given it no reason to chase after me and i kept looking back and i had to actually say chris it's not and i had to force myself to look forward and the lord spoke to my heart and i realized what the mama says you'd rip down the rear of your mirror don't look behind you you look behind you you crack up what causes you to look back is fear many times god has come down and and that and and he's given you the the deliverance you've asked for but your fear of going back to that causes you to look back to fall right back into it and and i realize you know begin to think that if the bride of christ if we as the bride of christ if we had no fear of what was behind us that we if we would realize let me say it like this if we would realize who we are there would be no fear of what was behind us you know the the saying goes the armor of god doesn't address the back there's two two ways because you always fight forward but also christ has your back the lord the lord is protecting you but it goes further than that that you have you don't have to fear what what might come from your pastor or what happened in your past once you settled that then that's that's gone that's all behind you and you don't have to the bottom line is you don't have to fear and fear causes you to to what doubt the word of god and uh paul tells timothy says i put thee in remembrance and um remember so remember who you are timothy you know in this in this instance paul is telling timothy we laid upon the the uh in remembrance that thou stirred up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands but he's he's reminding timothy who he is he says timothy remember who you are and so tonight remember who you are when the devil comes and says you know and whispers behind you and want you to get to look back just like a lot's wife did she looked back right because she heard the screaming of her loved ones and everything and the angel of the lord the angel said don't look behind you and she looked back and she turned into a pillar of salt a type that we're not called to to look behind us we're called to look forward because this isn't who you are but the devil see the devil can defeat you every single time if he can get you to doubt who you are there's a lot of people in this world today who don't know who they are they're born a female but they think they're a man they're bored a male but they think they're a woman there's many many people looking for their identity it's the thing right go on a road trip and discover who you are the only way to do it is in a vw van a prius won't work right so everyone's trying to find out who they are where they came from you got the the dna test i have one and it's been sitting on my shelf for a year and a half i need to take that everyone's looking to to to discover who they are what's in their background and it's just natural brother branham says natural always types of spiritual and it's a it's a spiritual type the bride of christ is coming to a maturity we're not talking about um we're not talking about god's sin a prophet anymore we're we're talking about who the bride of christ is what was the message that was brought to us it was to show us who we are and it's there and we've been told and and and we know and i think once we catch a revelation of that well brother brown said when the bride catches the revelation of who she are she'll be an invincible army how what makes someone invincible no fear that's like the marines right or the army they train them so they think they're never going to die they don't have fear that no no you know he might die but i'll never die and they just go headlong into into flying bullets because there's no fear and so you as the bride of christ will go headlong into victory but as soon as you fear you stumble you trip fear causes you to look back fear keeps you from accepting what the word says about you you want to know who you are don't go back and read your family history go back and read the real family history don't try to don't try to don't accept what someone said you are that's like they say you know never tell a kid they're stupid or they grow up grow up believing it you tell somebody a lie enough you get them to believe it people want to what happens is the devil puts people in your life and and and and and you you you begin to think you are this person because they keep telling you you're that person that's what the devil wants to do he wants to because here's the thing the the the sieging of god in your heart the holy ghost is who you really are but you fight the flesh every day so if the devil can get you to believe him you're a house divided because the holy spirit brings the flesh under subjection but as soon as you start to believe the devil's report about you just like the children of israel did with the with the spies that went across to jordan they believed the evil report fear was put in into their hearts and they weren't able to accept their promise i mean they weren't able to accept their promise remember that drop that down fear keeps you looking back at what you were instead of forward at who you are that can be anything genesis chapter 15. i've been uh going to the book of genesis um it's good to go back and read read the familiar stories because you'll find there's a lot of little things you missed along the way that and the word of god just keeps unfolding amen genesis 15 verse 1 and after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine air but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord and he counted to him for righteousness and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldeas to give thee this land to inherit it so here we have abram i didn't jot it down so i'm checking back here this is uh ishmael has not come yet so here we have abram and and when the lord called abraham out of heron or of the chaldees he says he said this is in chapter 12 verse 1 it says get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation anybody who's anybody knows that means abraham's going to have children and so here is abram and the lord comes to him and after after abraham goes out and he fights and he delivers lot from the those four kings and um the lord returns to him and he says he says look fear not i've i've i've promised it and i'm going to keep that promise i'm the one that brought the out of the ear of the earth the child is to give thee this land to inherit you have an inheritance fear not i will give you a son i will give you this land to inherit and the same promises given to you though time passes and those though though it seems you know to the world over that it's been thousands and thousands of years since christ left the earth and gave a promise he would return to take us home and and people would say well you know we're just going to go on and there's nothing after death and you just you just cease to to exist and the message of the hour that we've been given that word that we've been given people have started to fall away people have started to to to disbelieve this and and and you would think you know well what happened you know like the the 1977 how many people turned and left you know because it wasn't the end of it and and time goes on and what time has a has a has a habit of doing if i could say that is it has a habit of dulling what what you heard originally so when abraham comes out of the land and he goes to follow follow the lord everything was new and everything was exciting and everything was an adventure but after wandering for so long abraham began to get weary and so god comes along and says to him look fear not i am that abraham just went and took out four kings do you think abraham had a lot of fear but god says abram fear not doubt not don't disbelieve though time should pass that's why i have i i've mentioned this before but it comes to me again now you know friends that that said well i asked for the holy ghost and god never gave it to me so i'm going to go out into the world sometimes you have to and when you say terry i don't mean lay at the altar i mean keep on keeping on keep on going to church keep on reading your bible maybe god hasn't healed you yet keep on keeping on keep on reading your bible keep on going to church why because abraham went um what 25 how many years 25 years before he received the promised son 25 years i'm only 28. i'm only three years over that abraham was 75. see all that guy's been in the world for 40 years we heard there's no hope for him abraham wasn't called of god till he was 75 75 but the lord says you know it's easy for us because we can read the story and in two verses it's a hundred years give or take sometimes that's 20 years oh wow yes amen god keeps his promises yet you're standing there and that's what you want to believe i'm not saying that but but sometimes you're standing there in the desert and you're wandering the plains of memory so to speak spiritually and you're going what in the world where am i what am i doing and so the lord has come tonight to say fear not it takes time hey you know what at least you only live to be well 80 90 height 100 if you're really lucky abraham lived till he was 185. 175 actually i think it was 85 right so god's got to keep his promise to you in a shorter amount of time if you catch what i'm saying here tonight sometimes that promise if the lord so sees it is your reward on the other side sometimes that's that that's your healing amen praise the lord but a but god says to abraham he says fear not i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward what do we have need of that god can't supply for us tonight look this is who you are keep running that through your head this is who you are i'm reading about abraham but guess what you said you say to yourself when when i i said i am up here reading it but god says to abraham fear not this is who you are you are the seed of abraham isaac genesis 26 23-24 says and he went up from dance to bear sheba and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i am the god of abraham in this chapter chapter 26 i i'm all over the place tonight i i'm skipping back and forth and hither and john i just kind of threw it all on the pages threw it all down trust the lord to bring it together but genesis 26 we see isaac and and he goes into the valley of guerrero and um in the philistines where his his father abraham had digged wells and the philistines wouldn't stop them up and he ain't that the devil right god does something in your life and he come the devil comes behind you and tries to stop that up well it's time some i get tonight it's time for some of us to go back and re-dig those wells amen praise the lord that one was free and isaac so so now isaac goes and he digs in the valley and and he finds a spring of water and then the the herdman of guerrero did strive with isaac turman so there's conflict and then so they wouldn't dig another well and and um and then he left there and then they strolled for it again so another conflict over this well there was fighting so isaac's like fine i'll just move on so he moves on to another spot he digs another well and he says oh i will call this rehoboth re-hope rehoboth for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land and he went from thence to bear sheba bear sheep was an interesting thing i had to go look it up so so here is isaac experiencing conflict and conflict and then he he finds a well and he finally digs one then he goes and then he after he goes off to beersheba and beersheba means it is a well of the oath because abraham made a a an oath with abimelech because they i can't remember you have to go back and read it but there were some kind of this uh a bim likes to get out of my land until abraham left and then the abimelech came back and it's like look look look let's be friends let's make sure everything's okay so they made a pact and made an oath at and and um abraham built an altar and called this place beersheba beersheba was also the place that hagar that the lord came to hagar and ishmael and made water come out of the rock and so isaac experiences this conflict and this and and is striving and he goes to beersheba he goes back to the well of the oath back to the promise because what is an oath an oath there's a promise what back to the promise back to remembrance goes back to the place where look this is the place of remembrance this is the place of well of the oath the promise that god gave to my father abraham as isaac and rebecca were still had without child at this point nope he worked sorry they had jacob and esau already but isaac is striving and coming through conflict and sometimes as a christian you go through conflict and it's time you you go back to beersheba or you go to beersheba back to the well of the promise guess what the word of god is a well of promise there are promises upon promises upon promises that god has made to you that god has said it's yours alex it's yours brother tim it's yours sister miriam they're your promises you read about it in its history sometimes you know isaac going to beersheba this is who you are now all you have to do is accept it right you have to say yes that's me yes that's me you have to accept it for yourself israel jacob genesis 46 1-4 and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba so israel is heading to egypt he's gone for years missing his son joseph years of conflict and striving and here he is going back to meet joseph finally and what does he do this isn't coincidence saints of god he stops at beersheba the well of promise and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices i think i'm going to have to do a part two because i think this needs a lot more going into praise the lord if the lord so wills it offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac and god spoke unto israel in the visions of the night notice now i just have to break off for this right real real quick here abraham god gives abraham a promise but see how that promise rolls then to isaac now now god says i will be with you i will keep my promise because of your father isaac but for excuse me because of my servant abraham's sake but then you go on and and now it's it's it's it's jacob and he says i'm going to keep my promise because of isaac my promise to isaac and so that promise moves through the generations moves down with the word of god the promise didn't stop back there with isaac when he went into the ground the promise didn't stop when jacob went into the ground the promise didn't stop when christ went up into glory the promise didn't stop when paul was beheaded the promise didn't stop when isaiah was sought asunder the promise didn't stop when peter was hung upside down on the cross the promise didn't stop with the revolution of justification the promise didn't stop with the evangelism of sanctification and the promise didn't stop with the handing down of the king's sword into the hand of brother branham the promise has moved on into the bride of christ and what is that promise you shall receive a son who is that that is jesus christ praise the lord the promise is moving on and so now here is his is israel at beersheba and it offers a sacrifice unto the god of his father isaac and god saves a personal relationship amen it was not it was not you know it wasn't isaac's god he offered a personal sacrifice to god who was the god of his father isaac you don't offer a sacrifice to your father's religion you offer your sacrifice to the same god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and god spoke unto israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob and he said here am i and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go down into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation i will go down with thee into egypt i will also surely bring thee up again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes god took them down into egypt and there in the midst of conflict in the midst of strife in the midst of laodicea god built a nation today in the midst of laodicea in the midst of this world god is building a bride god is building a nation praise the lord israel in the midst of their turmoil god is building a nation little benjamin well back to beersheba so israel makes us stop at the well of the promise to remind himself because he knew he was old he wasn't going to be able to go back there again going down into egypt and god says don't worry take the promise from here with you down into egypt i'm going to be with you so god what does god do at beersheba to israel in the in in a dream he said he re what is the word i'm looking for reinstates his promise reminds jacob of the promise i will be with you and i will make of thee a great nation that was the promise i will make of thee a great nation praise the lord amen first kings chapter 19. verse one and ahab told jezebel we're jumping forward here a few hundred years in history same god same promise and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time notice jezebel threatened to kill elijah god reversed that that that judgment and she was killed and when and that's what god's going to do he's going to take what they say against you kind of like those those people that came in the meeting that had those prayer cards with all those sicknesses and they came up to brother branham and they he might have called them out of the audience i have to look that one up but they he says everything you know you came to tonight to to try to get prayer for stuff you don't even have to then say well i wasn't healed he said not everything on those prayer cards you have god turn that that that attack god turn that attack on his on his son back onto them praise the lord and when he's uh verse three and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba so you think elijah oh what a great man he's a man jezebel threatens him you know under the anointing right you say oh i could stand before a gun and then you're not at the anointing on monday morning and then that's when they pull the gun god gives you what you need when you need it praise the lord and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to bear sheba here we have elijah in fear and he runs to where beersheba which belonged to judah and left his servant there but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness so the wilderness of beersheba and came and sat down under a juniper tree you ever been under a juniper tree in beersheba and he requested for himself that he might die and say that i would say he was pretty low and said it is enough now oh lord take away my life for i am not better than my father's and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him a rise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the coals and a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and lay down him down again excuse me and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto horeb the mount of god so in a time of trouble elijah goes to beersheba and there at the well of promise receives strength and meat to go 40 days and 40 nights now i'm not telling you to go eat a page out of your bible and not eat for 40 days and 40 nights it's a very different thing it's spiritually in your life god you go back to the well of promise and you say you know oh you know sometimes i did this a while back i was tired and i was wore out and and and instead of instead of trying to think of how i can drink more coffee or injected straight into my veins or or how i can you know do this or maybe maybe take this vitamin i said lord i need strength i need you to give me more energy i need you to give me more strength excuse me and spiritually it's the same way they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength yes because i know saints of god we're real tonight i know tomorrow you ain't gonna be feeling so much about do not fear you're gonna be feeling the fear i know tomorrow life's gonna get real and or the next day after that you don't know what you're facing i i i preached a message um and back in phoenix and i um i was talking about the storm and i can't remember what i what exactly i preached about but there was a sister sitting in the congregation who was thinking yes lord wow it's so good i'm finally out of the storms two days later her husband died of a heart attack you never know what your future holds and she said that service not to lift myself up absolutely not that service was preparing her for what was to come here she thought it was a reminder of where she'd come from and it was but it was preparing her for what she was about to face we were good friends with them we we went directly to the to the hospital and and um so so it was very very real to me as a per as an individual how it's crazy what what happens and how quickly our situation can change how quick we don't know what comes tomorrow but what's the first thing you want to do when you hear a story like that fear what's that what's the what's the reaction of the flesh man it's fear but god has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind and she stands today testifying of the power of god bringing her through the trial are there bad days yes but god is ever faithful i have a good friend recently who committed suicide leaving his family in shambles and now his daughter is questioning what does she need she needs to she she need well she needs prayer but god is faithful she didn't know that was in her future her mother didn't know that was in her future but god is faithful and god knows what you're going to go through and he's not calling you to fear your future but he's calling you to say this is who i am and today i accept it abraham came to a place where he accepted it and that's when god gave him circumcision a covenant of the faith that god recognized in abraham praise god it's time to go back to beersheba back to the well of promise the well of the oath the well the greek uh the concordance strong second corner says the well of the sevenfold oath i think is what it is seven-fold oath praise god i'm telling you it just keeps getting better and better the more you go into the word the more you the more you read and the more you take the time to really take in what you're reading amen god just brings all of this out and what it what is it tonight i have it i have a little piece of paper here i wrote some notes on big bold letters this is who you are yes awesome you ever wish you could just really get somebody to get it i believe i believe by god grace tonight that that's not you but that's how i feel for myself i've been thinking about this myself i said oh it's easy for me to get up behind the pulpit and tell you this is who you are but what about me lord help me believe it help me accept it you think about all the things you go through and the struggles and the little the little things you get upset about or the things you get offended about on a daily basis if you just stop and say that's not who i am this is who i am you are the bride of christ oh how dare you confess that i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm going to confess it to the grave that i'm the bride of christ you say oh well you're arrogant no i'm not i've got humble confidence that god gave a promise and god's going to keep it what is that revelation that's what that is that's revelation and you know why people get so offended by it because they're not revelated well it's because the devil hates revelation you start to talk about how it's christ in you living it out and how christ you unzips and steps into your body and you start talking about how i am the bride of christ and you start talking about how god has revealed himself to you and the opening of the word and people get offended because there's a spirit behind that that hates revelation why does it hate revelations because it says this is who you are that's revelation revelation came for you to receive water baptism revelation came for you to receive the holy ghost revelation came for you to see the open word revelation came for you to recognize christ through genesis through revelation revelation is going to come for you to really say i'm the bride of christ revelation is going to come for you to go in the rapture okay brother brown says the verb the revelation of the rapture lays in the word you know what that is do you remember i don't know i don't know about if it's the same for everybody but but in my person in my person in in when the lord opened the word to me the opening of the word i always say that because it was a monumental point in my life and i was literally just like whoa my mind was blown and i i started going back to scriptures i had read before and i was like wow now i get it now it makes sense right god and so for me it was a very definitive point in my life and so that's how i always i reference it but but i really believe that's how it's going to be with the rapture you're going to be sitting here sitting here or at home listening to a tape or at home reading your bible or at home just sitting there if you ever do that just sit and think about the word of god you don't have to always get on your knees and shout and shake your hands and pray and sometimes you just meditate on the word of god and god just keeps speaking to you wow wow right maybe it's gonna blow down all of a sudden you're gonna go the rapture is because what happened when you caught revelation of the open word you couldn't see any other way if you get your revelation of the rapture you can't do anything but leave praise the lord in the moment in the twinkling of an eye but you know what's you know what's amazing about that we're all going to catch it at the same time praise the lord amen so beersheba the place of the promise so the same in the same chapter in first kings elisha goes into the wilderness of beersheba excuse me elijah and um he goes up into the rocks verse 11 and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by in a great and strong wind first kings 19 11. and the great and the great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind and earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake you know what what if elijah would have been like some of us and when the wind passed by they ran off down the mountain shouting about the glory of god but then monday came and or what if they they heard the wind and they felt the earthquake and they running off the down the mountain shouting about the glories of god but then monday came again or what if after the earthquake they saw the fire and they were running off down the mountain talking about the fire yeah but then monday came yeah but elijah stayed and lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou hear elijah the still small voice moved elijah out to speak with god elijah is in a turmoil he strives he goes to bear sheba god gives him the strength to then go to the mountain to speak with god but then but then god sends of great wind then he sends an earthquake and he sends a fire but the the but elijah waits for the word from the lord how often it is is it that we that we that we we we go to beersheba we're reminded of the promise we're in remembrance we get our strength and then we go out and we don't stop to listen long enough for god to give you the still small voice to then step out and say lord what is it you have to say to me what are you doing what what do you want me to see what you want me to catch see it's it's funny because in in the in the in the software industry there's well in any industry really okay but it's prevalent in in in my recent history in my career is that people get an idea for a a website and then they they we you know all right come on run run run run run run code code code code code code code and then it doesn't work because nobody to stop to figure out what exactly the user is expecting because the client says what they want but what they say isn't really what they want so you have to take the time you have to stop listen write notes ask questions write some more notes three weeks later you might write some code same with the word of god suddenly god calls you to a place god is in run run run run run run [Music] wait in the mulberry bush david you ever been sitting in a bush saying i really wish i wasn't sitting in this bush but uh flies and mosquitoes scratchy right is the wind gonna blow again right it's not always easy to sit and wait especially for some of us not you people like you i'm allowed to use that now i live here right stop rushing around wait for the still small voice why do you think the entertainment of the world is so loud and so fast you know it's not good enough for just a steady drum beat it's gonna be right break the drum heads off the drums get all crazy you gotta shake their heads around other gut whiplash it's not good enough to drive down the highway with your volume at 33. the beats going it's got to be 100 and then that's not good enough so they got to put subwoofers in the back of their car now there's no one for no one no space for anyone to sit it's loud because god they're they're literally drowning out the voice i i saw i read this this um there's a guy by the name of james clear he's an author and he wrote a book called atomic habits and he's got it's pretty it's pretty interesting um but i have a newsletter and he sends out these little things and and he sent out this study that that they took a bunch of a bunch of men and a bunch of women and it was like you could either you had to sit for 15 minutes that's all it was with no sound no noise no outside stimulation unless you wanted to shock yourself you could shock yourself not 12. that's nothing dangerous not 12. um and like 60 of men and like or 80 of men and 60 percent of women chose to shock themselves rather than sit there for 15 minutes with their own thoughts have you ever been shocked by like 110 hello i don't think they were using 110 but it had to be painful enough rather sit there and afflict bodily harm and be caught with their thoughts that's what god wants you to do he wants you to stop turn off the noise and listen stop and listen why is this here in the bible we could have just skipped right on down to the still small voice no god's trying to show you he's not always in the noise i adventure to say he very rarely is and the noise praise the lord so still the still small voice inside your heart so even within you and it's funny that the lord knows you know he puts things in the sermon but what what i what spoke to my heart was this was that does that you know this is who you are that even from within you the word speaks out amen that still small voice speaks out from within you amen praise the lord now we read about rebecca and like i said it's chopped up so perhaps i put that scripture too early if you're real we're all sensitive to an organized sermon there's a baptist church down in the corner rebecca had to get up that morning here's the thing and and and i don't know if this is a problem anymore today right i don't know if this is a problem with you all and and by god's grace um it's not always a problem i'm not even going to say that amen praise the lord but many times people think that they that that that you know god's promised it all right god has promised it all amen okay so can i just go like this and wait for the promise to come rolling to my feet stand up climb into my hands move my hand into my mouth doesn't work that way so people sit down oh praise god he's giving me a promise and they sit down and they get up and they go so god doesn't keep his promises i've been in this message for 30 years and i'm leaving because god doesn't keep his promises or you still serve god you're still living and you've been going for 10 years in the desert and you're sitting there going god doesn't keep his promises you're sitting under your juniper tree even the food that the angel brought to elijah elijah said i'd put in his mouth you think you say well that's silly that's so simple yes it is but how often do we fail to do that so rebecca had to get up that morning and go down to the well i'm going to take a political license i'm going to take my liberty to fill in the the gaps in this story rebecca woke up and she was really really really really tired the night before she had been out with her friends a little later than she should have been wasn't doing anything wrong just having a lot of fun playing a game of risk and the last morning she woke up and and and she laid there in bed and she hit snooze and she was like there's some mornings when you're tired and there's some mornings when you're really tired and this is that morning you start to think of all the excuses for not going down to the well well i get it later i don't have to have a cup of water for a couple of hours the horses they'll be fine they're not going to die the camels will be fine they're not going to die maybe laban will get it i was just laying but maybe i'll just text laban can you get the water maybe i'll just get on social media and talk about how you know women shouldn't have to get the water no i'm not going to get the water i'm just going to read my bible no i'm not going to get the water i i can't i i'm not gonna go to church i'll just stay and play a tape wow i went flat you see you can you can use you can twist the good you can twist the good but she said but see here's there's always the end of the story right because we've been there but you're here tonight so there was that day where you got up anyways believe that tonight don't we don't wanna we don't leave you hanging on the negative we believe hanging on the positive because you're here and you are an overcomer don't look back behind you those days you stayed in bed go back and remember the day you got up and you went down to the well so rebecca gets up and the pot the only one that was there laban must have used the other the light one late man that guy he beat me to it right because there was two pots one layman had something he had to do so he there was always two pots there was a lighter one and there was a bigger one well that morning laban felt like he'd take the lighter one and we know layman he's a cheat right go a little farther down in the story and you figure that out now i think i have my bible wrong anyways forgive me if i've messed history up and uh so rebecca gets the uh oh that's right laban was rebecca's brother okay so rebecca gets the the has to carry the heavier pot ever seen pictures of them pots they're about you know from the lady's hips to her head and it's on top of her head you ever tried to do that don't recommend it so she takes it down to the well and as she's walking she was thinking about her life wondering when it was going to go somewhere wondering when it was going to happen she had heard about this god that her her uncle had followed and left where she was and she wondered you know how how was he doing out there where was he what was he doing and for some reason today she was thinking a lot about abraham as she's walking down to the well and and um she began to feel something in her heart like man i wish i could could have been old enough to go with abraham i wish i could have could have gone and and i wish i would have been alive when abraham left and and then and and and gone with him hey doesn't he have a son named isaac it's because it was her cousin wow i wonder i wonder what he's up to you think about the lord he comes near right yep that's the bible that's the message so i rebecca gets down to the well and there's this guy standing there with some camels and she goes and she noticed it there was other people there with their camels but she noticed this one guy with his camels and something you know a little connection there she gets the water and she's walking back he says hey he says can i have a drink she's tired it's a heavy pot to give him a drink she has to take the pot off her head give him a drink then put it back on her head i'm gonna guess it was at least five gallons of water and that's not light and uh well it is if you're as buff as sean um sorry buddy so she she puts the the the water down and gives him a drink and now she she's remember she's tired she doesn't want to be getting water and she looks at those camels and they look really thirsty and that's a lot of jugs of water somebody broke it down one time some preacher broke it down one time it was a lot of water then things drink in one slurp like 30 gallons of water something crazy like that go look it up it's a lot of water and she she she gave them water tell the camels were satisfied so now instead of her morning routine going down to getting water being half an hour to 45 minutes it stretched out into like two to three hours of hauling water working hard and then eliezer gives her the gold bracelets tells her about isaac and the rest and the rest of me know the rest of the story but the but the the the thing it is here is that rebecca had to go meet eliezer she had to get up did she know she was meeting ellie easier did she know that i was going to be the same morning eliza showed up no did you know you were going down to meet god at the well when you got up no but god knew before the foundation of the world and god laid the way and you met eliezer and excuse me eliezer took you on a camel to isaac and now you are mrs jesus christ eliezer once he gets rebecca he goes into immediate action and he's like look we need to you you know they're like hey stay around for a few days and he said no way we need to get out of here i've got the girl let's go back to my master at once and so they look at rebecca or we're back look same day i believe it is same day maybe the next day and he's ready to leave no time for her to say goodbye to anybody no time for her to go and what did what is what did jesus say let the dead bury the dead he said well i'd follow you but i i let me first go back and rebecca was given the option do you want to first go back and she says no i'm ready to go because when you catch a revelation of christ you're ready to go you're not you're what is that a type of you're not you're not looking around saying well wow i'm this is fun and i and i want to still do this and i want to still hang on to this no she was ready to drop everything put on the garments he had given her the jewelry that she'd given he'd given her and leave her home behind and that's what god called you to do the same thing and now this is who you are you did the same thing rebecca did genesis 24 i won't read it for the sake of time tonight genesis 24 61-67 you can go and uh and and look it up i'm just going to flip to it so i make sure i have my information straight right so we're so so eliezer brings rebecca and and and isaac goes to walk in the field in the evening time and he sees the camel's far off and rebecca sees him and she drops off the camel and runs to him because she asked asked eliezer who is that guy and he said that is isaac just like eliezer said this is christ and here's the thing that really spoke to my heart brother branham says it beautifully here he said in 1953 earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints he says look it was in the cool of the evening when isaac walked out and some people say what if you see him and he is real dark jew if he is this i don't care what he looks like he's my savior and when the bride sees him it'll be love at the first sight love at first sight when rebecca seen isaac she jumped off the camel and run to meet him it was love at the first sight i tell you when we see him it will be love at the first sight off we'll go and a way will go into his arms certainly how beautiful the bride the evening lights coming the faith that was once delivered to the saints beginning to restore back to the church the fig tree is putting forth its buds i rebecca sees isaac and his love at first sight you see you saw christ and there was love at first sight it was revelation that that is christ and so and so now you and and and you have people that don't that don't understand it and then and and and they're playing tapes and and i don't need to go into all of that but what why wasn't it love at first sight maybe they weren't looking maybe they were looking at eliezer instead maybe they weren't even on the camel we don't know but brother brown says it was love at first sight you saw christ and you said that's what i've been looking for that's it now i understand the bride has met christ amen in the evening time it's the evening time that we live in today and and when she met christ she was clothed in the raiment from eleazar eliza gave her garments and gave her jewelry praise the lord she was clothed in the word you we were clothed in the word we will be clothed in the word when we when we meet christ praise the lord well we've already met christ and we receded seed here on here in this crazy world that we live in but the brown also says in redeemer redemption 1955 he says and now they had a kinsmen there by the name of boaz and he was a rich man and naomi sent ruth out into the fields to glean in boaz's field which was the custom in the d that day and still today right in that same field made glean behind the reapers so what was she gleaning for she was leaning for food and that's what the gentile church did come in behind the orthodox church picking up all they had which was the old testament gleaning what god give to the prophets the gentile church the young church the holy spirit church of the firstborn gleaning when boaz came out to see her to see how everything was going on a righteous man a type of christ boaz was a type of christ when he come out to look upon his harvest field he was the lord of the harvest christ is the lord of the harvest and he came out to look upon the field and notice as soon as his eyes fell upon the beautiful ruth it was love at the first sight said who is this young maid out here who is gleaning in my field christ loves you more than you love him sometimes we go around and we think you know we we we beat ourselves down because we're looking behind us and the lord is standing there going that's not what i see that's not what i think that's not who you are the lord and what does that come from low self-esteem but i'm here i tonight we're here to say that this is who you are you are this beautiful ruth you are the the beautiful rebecca and it was love at first sight for you and it was love at first sight for christ he says that's exactly what i'm looking for when he saw you you say me believe it accept it it's you it's not it's easy to say it's for somebody else it's easy for me to stand here and say it's for you but it's for me it's for me that this is who you are and you can only catch that by revelation from christ but love at first sight is revelation of jesus christ amen i'm closing here musicians want to come up this is who you are don't doubt what god says about you accept it and believe it doubt is unbelief or the inability to accept it for yourself brother brown says in in the working of the holy spirit he says one day abraham sitting in that condition talking about love at first sight he raised up his eyes and looked one hot day and he seen three men coming walking had dust all over their clothes and abraham was spiritual he recognized immediately who that was immediately and he ran run out and fell down by the side of the man's feet and said my lord stop by a little while and sit under the tree and let me bring a morsel of meal and refresh yourself and then you may go on for this purpose have you come to your servant what they looked like men but you know who it was see but it says it doesn't matter if he's a dark jew or what he looks like i'll know him when i see him his bride will know him when he sees him someone called my hand on that one time he says and said brother preacher do you mean to tell me you believe that was god i said almighty god set down there as a human being and abraham went and killed the calf and god eat the meat of the calf drunk the milk from the cow and eat butter and cornbread the bible said god almighty did that and angels with him you try here's why i pulled this quote in i pulled this quote because abraham saw at first sight abraham knew who he was when he saw him sometimes people are introduced to christ and they miss it but you were introduced to christ and you recognized it he says you tried to limit god you try to limit god to your theology you try to let a god to your way of thinking why he will never do it well my god is so great how did he do it why it was easy when you see this picture here you'll never doubt the resurrection you'll never doubt the resurrection when you saw christ you accepted it don't limit god this is who you are don't accept what the devil says you are or what your parents said you are or what your friend said you are or what some pastor told you you are accept what god says you are and god tonight is telling you you are the bride of christ you are a jewel in his crown you are everything he ever dreamed of because he dreamed you before the foundation of the world you are you look exactly like he wanted you to because you're clothed in his word he took you from the field in the evening time into the tent into the secret place because you are exactly who he saw at the beginning before there ever was a an earth hanging in space before there was a sun hanging in space before there was any planets anything in all was darkness he saw you standing before him in the field at the evening time i i i i'm a software engineer now but i was a carpenter and i was i still do like to do woodwork and i've had projects where i had him in my head exactly how i wanted it and when it was done it was exactly how i pictured it in my head and it just it just about drives you crazy it's so it's so exactly what you wanted it's a type of christ you are literally he sees you and he wants us like michelangelo smite the knee of moses and say speak you're ex excuse me you're exactly what he saw you say well i yelled at my husband this morning i spoke ill of this person or i was rudy in the drive-thru i was rough with the salesman i didn't say he was looking at your flesh he's looking at who you are inside it's there in you this is who you are oh lord help us to accept it are you ready to accept it i'm ready to accept it but i need his grace and i need his mercy and i'm going to keep on keeping on and one of these days i'm going to realize it you say we have but we have to bring you in remembrance god has to bring you and remember and say this is who you are this is who you are right you you you you tell somebody you encourage somebody you keep telling them every day this is who you are this is who you are you can do it you can do it you can do it then they do it because why they heard it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again who is the bride isaiah paul peter [Music] martin luther john wesley brother branham polycarp james john jacob isaac what is that promise doing rolling from generation to generation telling you this is who you are this is who you are this is who you are why is it written down so we can read it because we didn't live back then so we can read it again genesis abraham this is who you are isaac this is who you are jacob this is who you are joseph this is who you are [Music] jeremiah this is who you are joshua this is who you are blind bartimatus this is who you are are you catching it tonight are we catching it uh timothy this is who you are rebecca this is who you are [Music] sarah this is who you are i see you're with child this is who you are is that the promised son you're showing yes because this is who you are why because it's the promise and the promise keeps on going and it keeps on going what is the same yesterday today and forever you say jesus christ guess what also is the same yesterday today and forever the promise brotherhood says that buella bear sheba still stands there today i read it in a quote the promise never ever ever expires never gonna keep on in the mail and it's already expired that ain't gonna happen because the promise keeps going the promise is there every day you wake up maybe you fail to use it the day before maybe you didn't recognize it the day before but tomorrow is another day tomorrow tomorrow morning i challenge you and i challenge myself wake up and says and say this is who i am the promise is today god is not a god of the past he's a god of today what did he tell moses to tell him uh forgive me i'm going over what did he tell moses to say i am what is that telling us today god is the god of the present you say well god did it back then god did it for abraham god did it for isaac god did it for jacob god did it for paul [Music] tomorrow i can say god did it for christ tomorrow you can say god did it for nadia as well you can say god did it for sean sean can set up and say god did it for me the promise is as real today but we like to keep it in the past but god is saying today stop looking back and look forward look forward your car moved you from point a to b to point b yesterday i moved you from point a to point b this morning tomorrow are you gonna get in it worried it's not gonna take you from point a to point b no how can god's promise be less than that that's the material thing man created god's promise stands true day after day rebecca was not was rebecca was barren for 20 years but did god leave off his promise no why because listen i'm gonna say i i [Music] lord help me tonight praise the lord god told abraham i will make of your seed a nation and then for 20 years rebecca stood barren they doubted but god promised i will raise up a seed after abraham that had to come through isaac and rebecca the same promise lays for you in the word of god if he did it for rebecca he can do it for you because that promise kept on rolling forward and it rolled forward and if rebecca had daughters and the daughters had the same problem that promise rolled forward and then on the next generation that promise roll on forward why because it's god today and god said it he is going to keep it you just have to say i accept it praise the lord he will not leave his promised void i read isaiah 55 11 in the beginning it goes so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper it shall accomplish that which i please what does he please for his promise to come to pass in your life praise the lord [Music] amen this is who you are one in a million [Music] one in a million praise the lord i guess i shouldn't have called you all up yet i am sorry i just get excited [Music] amen the spotless bride of christ you are the spotless bride of christ because you're clothed in his righteousness i was reading out the other day too they kept the lamb for four days because the lamb could look good on the outside but it could have a blemish on the inside so they kept the lamb for four days to make sure it was healthy just like they kept christ in jerusalem for four days praise the lord but you've god has given you the spotless word and that's what he sees amen praise the lord amen let's stand tonight i'm sorry i i'm not sorry don't be sorry i'm not sorry sometimes god does that you know he comes in you know maybe it's just me the music i just relax and then god can come and i get out of the way but it doesn't matter i i believe that if it's the word that it's god amen let's bow our heads heavenly father lord jesus oh lord it hurts so bad to just we want to see that
