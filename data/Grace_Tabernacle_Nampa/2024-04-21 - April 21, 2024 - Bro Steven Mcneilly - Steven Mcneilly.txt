really beautiful song Amen um we have a testimony were you gonna come up first or just brother job brother job you want to come lot more people from this end of the room so as brother Steven was preaching yesterday he was talking a lot about how a lot of times Christians and especially young people will get stuck in these cycles of you know you really want to serve God and you'll have ups and downs and like you'll be serving God but then you'll fall and you'll be serving him again you'll fall again and it really can trap people and I'll be open with you I was one of those people um for about i' say a couple weeks ago you know is really when God really dealt with with me because I had so many times even after receiving the Holy Spirit I had still just fought this battle and the devil just kept dragging me down with it and I would stand on faith and I would say NOP I'm not going to do this anymore I believe and I would truly thought I had faith and then I would fall again and it happened multiple times and I began to feel hopeless like I would never be be able to stop and I would I would go to a camp and I'd catch on fire for God and I'd be like wow this changes everything and then nothing changed and then I would I would sorry um I would just go to a service and the preacher would be talking about my exact scenario and I'm like wow that's amazing and still nothing would change and it was a problem for me and I didn't know how to stop it until finally one day I really I truly discovered the problem of it because I was I was in a very little place and I don't know why but I just by myself I just said loud I was like I'm afraid I don't I don't know I'm afraid and then I just said fear not for I'll be with you even in you till the end of the world and then I realized that was the problem it was the fear fear is just unbelief packaged in a different form that's it took that realization for me because I was always afraid of falling back into my sin because I would I thought I believed but then I'd fall and the devil would say oh look at this time you thought you believed then you thought you believe then how do you know you're not believing now and so finally I was really struggling and I was just had a long talk with the Lord I was driving home from school was like 30 minutes so I had a while to talk talk with him and I just said I don't care how many times I thought I believed in the past and fell I don't care how many times I tried and failed I have faith and I believe nothing can change that and I just had to stand firm on that I had to recognize that it was just this fear that God was or sorry that the devil was just holding down on me it's his the same tactic that he always used before when I was younger I struggled with us for a long time and before the fear was oh I can't tell anyone because everyone's going to hate me and that was the fear then and then the fear was the fear of falling back into it always the fear of pulling it back in and really once I could recognize that it was just that fear that the devil was holding me under I was able to give it to God because he has not given us a spirit of fear he has given us the spirit of righteousness and there in that chapter in I believe it's Ezekiel where it says I will remove from you Your Heart of Stone and give you a heart of Flesh later on in that chapter it goes on to say and you will remember the acts that you did that were evil and you will loathe yourselves for it that was me I hated myself and I was I like brother Steven was preaching to the people yesterday he was talking about how there will be times where you don't even feel like you're a Christian you don't you have just the devil really holds you down and that's what he was doing to me and once I was able to give that fear up and and just stand in faith I was The Temptations didn't stop but the weakness was gone so the devil was still trying but I could tell he lost immediately and it's just that fear that if just have to defeat it because that is I think the biggest tactic of the enemy almost it is just unbelief this same tactics he's always used just trying to change it but I don't know I think that's [Applause] all amen when we can grasp the word he's already told us who we are he's told us where we're going he's told us that whatever we go through he's going to take care of us amen once we can believe that we're Unstoppable amen amen hallelujah um sing number 861 wonderful mer Merciful Savior precious Redeemer and friend who would have thought that a lamb

the love of God huh who can understand it the love of God that he would love a sinner a richet such as I even when I was unlovable when I was unlovely Mar in sin and shaped in iniquity yet the love of God thank you how many of you have tasted of the love of God hallelujah hallelujah there's nothing like it we greet you all this this morning in the lovely name of Jesus Christ and it's certainly an honor and a privilege for me to be here and thank you brother Paul for the invitation uh you know he's treated us so well so well that you know even if we don't miss Minister we'd want to come back and visit and so uh we just certainly had a a very nice time last night and uh with the young people and everything and you know it was a very direct straight word that we preached but I think we need that once in a while absolutely cuz brother Brenham said uh real Christians they're uh they don't need to be babied and they don't need to be petted just give them the word let the word have an effect and so we just greet you and we have my I have my lovely wife with me here this morning where is where she at here she is right in the front row I was looking way in the back for God bless you love you and uh this is the first time that she's traveled with me or I don't really travel that much but it was just such so nice to have her with me and we know that the woman is a reflection of the man and so if you want to see what I believe and what I preach just uh look at my lovely wife wife and that'll tell you all you need to know so God bless you and it's good to see brother Chris and uh uh our friend from Arizona and congratulations on having your little boy Alistair there and uh you know five is a good number for kids it's a good number believe it or not because five is the the number of Grace and then you have brother Chris and sister Kristen that's seven which means completion I think we can all read between the lines there God bless you real good brother Chris we love you and your family there so if you have your Bibles turn with me uh to the book of Deuteronomy chapter 8 and uh the Lord placed this thought on my heart and uh and I trust it'll be a blessing for you this morning brother Ron sends his greetings to the Saints here that Grace Tabernacle praise the Lord Deuteronomy chapter 8 we'll read verses 1 through6 and it says all the Commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe and do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear onto your fathers and thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness notice why he led them in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee and to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments or no understand that God knows exactly what's in your heart but sometimes he needs to take us through a Wilderness for us to recognize what is in our hearts cuz God already knows and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with Mana which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth Man live and the congregation said amen amen thy reignment waxed not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these 40 years and our older sister said amen Thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son so the Lord thy God chastens thee therefore Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to fear Him amen let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord my desire this morning is that your word would have an effect in our lives father that when we leave this place that we would have a closer walk with you and I believe that that is the desire of every Minister Lord and father I ask a blessing upon this service a special blessing upon your children this people at Grace Tabernacle the visitors from different places Lord I ask that you would bless them uh uh bountifully in their lives father God not necessarily with natural things but with spiritual blessings Lord because that's the blessings that'll Hold Us father we love you we commit this service into your hands for thy Kingdom's glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may take your seats this morning I would like to title my sermon this morning desert places deserts are a very dry hot Dusty uncomfortable places to live in and we would say that deserts are designed only for reptiles and snakes to live and to survive in and it's a place where the cactus is the tallest tree in town and I live in Arizona it's a wonderful place to live but the climate there is very dry it's it's very dusty it's it's a it's a hard place to live in it's a hard place to survive in but yet I I believe as we look at this natural type of a desert and of the things that live therein that we can also apply it to our spiritual lives and we can see that as we go through these types and shadows and these examples in this sermon this morning we can see that God actually uses desert places in our lives it is actually a good place to be in it's actually a good place to live in though it's uncomfortable though it's dusty though it can be a very lonely place to be in yet God uses desert places in our lives in the sermon planting the vine and where to plant it in 1959 brother brandham says thus it is with the church today that when the church gets away from the Fountain of Life so what happens when the church gets away from the Fountain of Life he says it gets away from the joys of Salvation did we did we have the quotes there or no were we able to get them up there yeah let's follow along with me if you would poor favor first quote that's okay I don't think you have it on there no that's not my sermon let's see what Brother Paul's been preaching here let me get some [Laughter] inspiration brother brandham says when it gets away from the joys of Salvation when it gets away from the Lord God then that person becomes a sticker always finding fault sticking now I know you live in not a very dry climate here and and there's a lot of rain and there's a lot of this and and perhaps there's nobody in Idaho that have gotten dry and are stickers there's no one in this church but I'll just preach it anyways because I'm from Arizona a lot of times when we get away from the Fountain of Life when we get away from the from the rivers of Life the first thing we lose is the joy of our Salvation David one time said he said Lord restore unto me not my salvation but the joy of my salvation so it's very easy for us now as Believers both young and old and middle-aged for us to lose the the very Joy of our salvation and to become a sticker that's right and we're just sticking and we're always finding fault nothing is good enough within the church the song leader didn't sing you happy the preacher didn't preach you happy the uh the the church was too hot this and that and on and on and on and on and sticking we're always sticking we're always finding faults have any of you ever got to that place in your life yes I have why what was the cause of it because I got away from the Fountain of Life and so when you find somebody that's that's that's sticky you know it's hard to give a cactus a hug have you ever tried to do it I wouldn't recommend it but what happens is you try to give a CA God bless you ah oh did you hear about this did you hear about this in the church that person said this did you see what that sister was wearing oh my goodness did you see did you see that brother my what are they doing finding fault they're sticking they're prickly they're not soft their Spirit isn't soft but their spirit is hard and they're like a c walking Cactus and everywhere they go They're sticking everybody that they come in contact with and the person that is walking around like a walking Cactus think everybody else is the Fault right well this person didn't shake my hand and this person over here and why does nobody want to talk to me and why and why and why well because you're a walking Cactus and you've gotten away from the Fountain of Life saints of God if you find yourself in a spot where you're always finding fault and you're all dried and and shriveled up and you're acting like a walking Cactus you need a trip back to Calvary you need a trip back to the Fountain of Life and say Lord give me this drink I need to drink from thy Fountain this morning because I'm sick and tired of finding fault in everybody else we've all been there and chances are we're all going to be there again right so it's up to us as Believers to keep our spirit soft how did Brother brand tell us to keep our spirit and nature soft through prayer Lord I'm up this morning I'm praying onto thee because I don't want to be a sticker I don't want to be finding fault I don't want to be the glass is half empty kind of a guy but I want to see the good in life I want to be uh the glasses half full kind of a person because it's all depends on how you look at the situation ation we have a choice and I know this is very simple but it's right down to where we live it'll help you in your Christian walk it'll help the young people with your relationship with your parents and it'll help the parents with your relationship with our kids because guess what I'm a father of five that's why I can give Chris a hard time because I know five hey it's it's completion man it's good that's a good place to stop sex is too much okay it takes a special person and 100 acres of land to have six kids it's just a fact not a little backyard in Phoenix Arizona sometimes life can be so encumbering and we get so stressed out and we have the pressure of having to provide and we have the pressure of taking care of our our our family and our children and we have the pressure of church we have the pressure of work and so much of the time we get so pressurized that that we do we let off the pressure right A lot of times for a man we let it off on our children we become sticky to our children we let off the pressure and we explode what did Brother brandham say to do he said you've got to let off the pressure but when we let off the pressure valve he doesn't want us doing it in worldly things it doesn't mean that we have to go and and and and go and play golf every night or or go hunting every weekend or because that's my release valve that's what I like to do no the best place to release the pressure in your life is in church he say I'm going to come to church I'm going to forget about life for a minute I'm going to forget about work I'm going to forget about my circumstances and I'm going to let off the pressure and I'm going to praise the Lord I'm going to raise my hands I'm going to say Thank You Lord I'm going to say Amen to the word and I'm going to Worship the Lord my God for two hours on Sunday releasing the pressures of life that are surrounding me cuz if you don't release it here in the Right Places You'll release it in the wrong places which will not bring forth the right kind of fruit in our lives it'll not bring forth the right kind of fruit in our family's lives or in our children's lives right what a responsibility that we have to keep our spirit sensitized in the presence of the Lord too much of the time we put God in a little box you know what the boxes are called Wednesday and Sunday oh God I pray that you'll move in the service on Wednesday night I pray you'll set them minister to the side and we'll have such an awesome time and Sunday morning oh my that's when everybody shows up and the congregation is full maybe your congregation's full on a Wednesday night ours isn't but Sunday is when everybody comes oh God oh God move amongst move into the sight speak to our hearts let the presence of God fall in our midst what about Thursday and what about Friday and what about about Saturday what about Monday and Tuesday what about driving in your car what about when you're at home listening to a to a song do you think God can move on your heart do you think God can move in your heart when you're driving to school when you're taking the kids somewhere when sure he can but too much of the time we put God in this little Wednesday and Sunday box that that's the only time that God can move in our lives some of the greatest personal times that I've had with God is when I'm driving my truck amen cuz I'm just relaxed I don't notice nothing my wife on the other hand she notices oh look there's a person on the freeway three cars up and they go to the the same school as our kids I'm like how do you know this she look there's brother and sister so and so she's just so alert well I'm just yeah praise the Lord I don't know how I got home but I got home I sure had a nice time with the Lord in the car this morning so we need to like break out of this mentality that uh God can only move when we congregate together as a church body but God can move in your heart when you're at work God can move in your heart when you're out fishing God can move in your heart when you're doing the dishes if you will just sensitize yourself and let him speak amen praise the Lord I think that's real good because it keeps us in anticipation every day of the week for God to speak to our hearts like the brother said I'll take away your Stony heart and I'll give you a heart of Flesh if our hearts are Stony and our hearts are hard and our spirit is hard and we're not sensitized to God when he speaks we miss it you know that you can miss the voice of God when he speaks to you because he's a gentleman he's like a dove he's soft he's tender he doesn't shout like this but he's soft and he's gentle and he waits and he speaks but if we're not sensitized in our hearts if our spirit is not right we miss miss the voice of God when he's talking to us we miss the flashing red miss the BL stop don't go there don't let your thoughts go there they're going in the wrong direction we miss it completely because we are in the flesh I want to tell you something you are not a flesh person on a spiritual journey but you are a spiritual being on a journey through this flesh man so don't yield yourself to your flesh and to your imaginations and to your own thoughts yield yourself to the spiritual God to the spirit that dwells within you when he speaks you will hear yes and when I hear I will answer and I'll say yes Lord here I am Amen brother brandham says they're always finding fault sticking cus and put it into a land for a few Generations where there's plenty of water and that sticker will unfold and it so how do we bear fruit in our lives it's the atmosphere in which it's planted in take the same plant the same seed the same Cactus take it from Arizona and plant it here in Idaho in a few Generations because the atmosphere is different what will happen to it it will soften it up and it'll begin to bear fruit it's all about atmospheres which which is a completely different sermon on its own but you are a creator of the atmosphere in your life and the atmosphere that you create in your life will either breed fruit of the Holy Spirit or it'll be a sticker let me just leave the atmospher is right here what kind of atmosphere are you creating in your life because the atmosphere that you create in this Earth is going to be the atmosphere that's created in the earth of your home and in the Earth Earth of the people that are planted round about you you want to change people around you start by changing yourself start by changing your own atmosphere people like to say well brother brandom you know what he did he put on the apron and he started doing dishes it changed the atmosphere all the sisters hollered amen cuz they need as much help as they can but not not only did he put on the apron and start doing dishes put his hand on her and he starts talking to her oh mey there was this dress that I saw and it would look so cute on you cute is the word of the banquet this weekend in case some of you didn't know now a man can say cute and not feel embarrassed it's okay oh it would look so pretty it would look so cute oh bill you know we can't afford that what's he doing doing all the time he's talking to her he has his hand on her he's praying for her Lord change the situation calm her spirit sensitizer she's been at home all day with all these kids and trying to clean and people coming to the house and people wanting to see Bill and here she was she was always a a a what would you say a wall or a protection between the public and brother brandom and so she had to deal with all these people she had to deal with her children she had to deal with people Luna takes coming to the house and wanting prayed for and here she was she was at her Wit's End and brother Brandon realized he needs to change the atmosphere in the house and so when he began to talk nice to her when he began to give her words of endearment Hallelujah you know when we begin to speak to our wives with words of endearment it changes things it changes atmospheres when was the last time you told your wife she was pretty amen words of endearment I learned this I learned that from ashlin's dad when we were just dating she'd he'd tell the boys you make sure and you tell you're your mom and the girls that they look pretty today he saw the in the effect that it has in their lives because so much of the time we're so caught up with hello magazines and and this magazine and this one over here and all the pretty girls of the earth that have absolutely no character behind them just selling their body for money and their looks that ain't pretty that's false that's fake it's lies take a picture of them when they wake up in the morning and see how pretty they look but words of endearment can change marriage amen I hope some of you are listening cuz I'm touched in my heart and I know when God touches me in my heart like this that it's for somebody yes amen don't wait for her to ask do I look pretty but tell her before she asks and then she'll probably ask you anyways because she wants to hear it twice Hallelujah says don't talk to me about that stuff it has no fruits you take that same plant and plant it in the right kind of atmosphere it brings forth fruit he says what's the matter with the church today it's been set into a denomination that has put denominational Creeds and bound it no joy just a Sprinkle now and then of a little Revival to hold it what it needs to be is to come out from among scoffers and unbelievers and be planted by the rivers of water that's what we need in our Liv lives we need to come out of the unbelief that has us bound once in a while and come in and plant ourselves by the rivers of life which is Jesus Christ it's an everflowinglife Christ and him alone will die in our sins it doesn't matter how much good we've done in our lives it doesn't matter how much tithing we've paid or how much we've come to church unless we've been born again by the spirit of God it will amount to nothing I say father give us all that true New Birth experience that we've passed from Death onto life Hallelujah cuz that is what holds us many times in our lives as Christians we're going to come across periods within our lives that we're in a desert place no one's exempt from it and if you've just been in the joy of the Lord and on cloud nine since that day that you surrendered your life to him and you've never been in a desert experience or a desert place in your life just get ready cuz it's coming if it hasn't come yet it's on its way so be prepared for it it'll be times where it seems like it's impossible to take your Bible and spend time and to read it there will be times where it feels like it's impossible to pray the anointing is completely dry the skies are like brass you can't pray through through you can't feel no inspiration you don't feel the presence of God around you and it seems like it's just a dry lonely uncomfortable hot climate in the atmosphere that surrounds your life all of us who have been there we're going to be there again right but I want you to know and and that it's a good place to be in I want you to know that God uses those times in our lives for his glory amen that it's not because you're a rank Sinner and God doesn't love you but he's taken you apart to a desert Wilderness place because he has a purpose behind it Hallelujah desert places are extremely lonely places to be in and we've all been there it doesn't matter matter whether you go to a small church or a big church there' be times you can go to a big church with all these people and all the youth and all these people around us but yet still feel lonely right that's right alone in a big group by yourself and nobody knows because you still got a big smile on your face because you're hiding up what's really going on on inside of our hearts you know as Believers we have this thought process me me mentality that if if you share what's really going on in your life that that people a lot of times will think well you're just a weak Christian and you just got to have faith just have faith what's wrong with you all you got to do is just have faith I think that's nonsense I think we've we've put Faith to a place where if you have faith that you'll have no issues in your life but if you have faith you'll have more issues in your life because God is wanting to show to Satan and to the world around us the faith that you have in your life and so we have this mentality built up like oh yeah that person's struggling we have a bunch of job's comforters in the message we have job's comforters within our own families well this is happening in their life because their secret sin are because of this and they haven't been doing their due diligence nonsense don't listen to that kind of Tommy rot have God send you what was his name the one that came around and he was a real good guy huh elu what was it it was God God send us someone like elu around in our life that won't be a comforter in point the finger cuz he's an absolute sticker amen but that he'll Comfort us in a way number one if we're in sin he'll tell us the truth out of love but number two they'll give us an opportunity and a way out of that sin not just to point the finger but to provide a way out hallelujah amen amen there's many things that we go through in Life Unexpected accidents to yourself or to a family member Financial issues you lose your job put you into a desert place somebody gets sick in the family you have a car wreck whatever it might be the list can go on and on you fill in the blank yes you fill in the blank of what has happened in your life you fill in the blank of what could happen there's many things that can take us all as Believers into desert places but we realize that God has a purpose for these things Exodus 3 1-5 and it says now Moses kept the flock of Jethro's father-in-law the priest of Midian and he laid the he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb I want to ask what was it that led Moses to lead his sheep to the backside of the desert because there was an appointed time in the backside of the this desert that was going to happen he said and and the angel of the Lord appeared onto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned can you imagine taking the Sheep out into the country out into a Wilderness place and all of a sudden there's a there's a fire that's not being consumed what did it do it caught the attention of Moses because God had to get Moses by himself in order to grasp his attention because he had an appointed time with Moses because he had a purpose and a plan for Moses to go into Egypt amen why did he get them all by himself because there was no other voices there was no other distractions there was nothing that would hinder the voice of God in his life life out in the wilderness out there am so God had to lead him out there why because he wanted to grab his attention and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called onto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is ho Holy Ground what was God doing God was was drawing him out of a a comfort zone and he was bringing him into a Wilderness place because he wanted to grab his attention by this Supernatural Bush that was not being consumed by this fire it was a supernatural fire in the bush was not being consumed the supernal is designed to catch our attention first two p of brother bram's Ministry what did it do it caught the attention of the people first pull he would take them by the hand and his hand would begin to bump what was it dealing with it was dealing with the Flesh and he would say oh my uh uh such and such is wrong with you and he would pray for them and if the little bumps or the vibrations went away he would say you're healed in the name of Jesus Christ because it was a sign that God was given to this prophet and what was this sign for it was to catch the attention of the people the second pull the the the Discerning of the hearts and so forth he would say oh I see somebody way in the back there your name is such and such and you're from such and such a place and and and what was it doing it was the people were wowed by it wow what was God doing he was moving from the flesh man into the spiritual realm God condescending not just dealing with our flesh but now with our spiritual man until finally it would get to a place the third pool what was it the revealing of the word doesn't deal with the flesh the intellects of man nor the spirit of man but the soul of man where the seat of God lays Thy word oh God have I hid in my heart that I learn not to sin against you so God is the god of our flesh our spirit and of our soul the first two were designed to catch the attention of the people but the last one it wasn't for all of the peoples but it was for a particular people a royal priesthood a people who were predestined who were elected to catch the word of God in this hour the first two pools hey it's all to do with the flesh all to do with the flesh and whenever the whenever the flesh didn't feel the emotion anymore guess what those people were no longer held whenever he stopped telling the people what was upon their hearts guess what they said ah brother brenham's all washed up his gift isn't working anymore uh and whenever he stopped doing it as much guess what people begin to walk away why because they were being healed by uh emotions and and and and and by the the spirit of conscience and memory and so forth like that he he said if I tell one person their name and where their address and where they live they think I'm a God the next person that comes through if I don't tell them they think I'm a devil he couldn't win but it was to catch the attention because within that group with within that that that that net of fish that was being cast every service guess what there was a rainbow trout within that that was had a destiny with God to hear the revealed word of the hour that it might change their lives and that someday it might change their body for a Rapture first and second pull Believers guess what I doubt they'll make the Rapture that's why is that because there's no Holy Spirit that's revealing the word to them it's the Holy Spirit who's the Divine interpreter of the word that's why a person filled with the Holy Ghost can listen to the same service and catch the inspiration ation they can catch the anointing and say wow even though it was spoke by the prophet and there will be others that'll hear the exact same service and say I didn't catch anything what is it that makes a difference it's the Holy Spirit who will bring things to our remembrance who will Who will show us things to come and who is the only Divine interpreter of the word sir Amen Let me throw you a curveball the prophet of God was not the Divine interpreter of the word otherwise everybody would catch it that listens to the sermons that's right but though he preaches it there's still a supernatural element direct quote a supernatural element that remains where the Holy Spirit reveals it to the believer so if there's one thing that we need to be praying for is the holy spirit not just one baptism but many outpourings and not just one Revelation but God keep revealing to me keep unfolding to me Lord for one purpose not that I can be a stuffed shirt right right not that I can tell somebody when they're wrong right but that I know how to live a life that is pleasing to him yes am amen seven seal brother bradam he says don't try to put your own interpretation to these things don't do it why because there's carnal impersonations that'll arise men's intellect and Creeds and dogas will be added to it he said just go and live a Christian Life ah brother Stephen that's way too simple that's why I love it because I'm not an intellectual person just talk to me for 20 minutes and you'll understand but I'm glad that it does that I don't have to rely on my own intellects of my mind but I rely upon the holy spirit of God to bring the Revelation to my life and you also amen amen Moses was raised in the house of pharaoh he looked like an Egyptian he talked like an Egyptian and he was taught as the Egyptian children were taught but at an appointed time he realized that's not who he really was and and I believe that most of us in here are belie belies and we've had a a true experience with God but you know what there come a time in brother bram's own life that he realized he wasn't the son of of uh what's his dad's name Charles and Ella brandom but he was the son of the King when he was when he saw himself as a as a as a brandom as a son of Charles brandom guess what he tried to do he tried to smoke a cigarette right right he tried to drink a drink of whiskey I ain't no don't you call me oh that's that's that's Bill he's a his dad called him that here he was the oldest of all the brothers I ain't no he give me that drink watch me and that voice spoke to him he run away crying like what like a little but he was a brandom and he tried to do the things that brandom's done he one day he he he took a beaten from these boys and what did he go to he went and got his gun I'll put enough bullets in here I'll kill all these guys which one of you want to die first huh remember he says and they were all screaming he cocked that thing back click click click why was he doing that because he was a brandom but he came up to a point in his life where he realized that's not who I am and when he realized who he really was guess what when remember that lady said you little kinky headed whatever and she was calling his mom bad names he goes I knew something happened in my life because because I prayed and I had a love for that woman if that would have been a couple of weeks before he says I never thought a a man that would hit a woman isn't man enough to hit a man he goes but I would have hit her that day but now he realized I'm not the son of Charles brandom though that's my name that I have here on Earth I'm a son of the king I've been given a new name I've been given a new heart I've been given a new nature therefore I'm going to bring forth of the fruit of my heavenly father and that's the place that all of us come to as Believers in Christ and you don't realize it until somebody steps in your toes right amen Abraham Abraham stay thy hand for now I know that you love me I thought God knows all things God knew exactly what was in Abraham's heart he knew exactly how much he loved him but Abraham might not have known to the extent that he loved god wow I can't believe I was about to do that Sarah's going to kill me when she finds out my mother-in-law last two years ago uh she got covid and she was going through menopause and stuff and she just had a a very very hard time and to say that she was losing her mind is an understatement she wasn't sleeping at night and and she's already kind of a nervous person and you get a nervous person that's not sleeping and they don't know what's wrong with them and they're always crying and they're they're suffering within themselves a uh she was she was absolutely losing her mind and so she would call this person and call that person she would call me and you know she was uh if I would say this respectfully she was trying to find that one sentence that would deliver her you see what I'm saying somebody give me an anointed word that'll deliver me from this from this atmosphere that I'm in right now and one night you and it was just hard on the family and I remember talking to my brother and sister-in-laws and my wife and stuff and we're like you know what we might just have to get used to this that she might never get better she might always be in this state of mind I I I don't know but we need to have Grace for her and so anyways one night she called me and she's crying and stuff of course and and uh and I'm not much of a crier um I only cry really when I when I Minister and God touches my heart it's like the only time it's strange and so she uh she called me she's crying I'm like okay you'll be all right Mom and you know I'm trying to console her and stuff and she's like Stephen I don't know why I'm going through this but all I know is I love the Lord Jesus I said do you realize what you just said right now that's you're here in the darkest deepest trial of your life that you've ever been through you're losing your mind you've contemplated committing suicide and all these dark thoughts in your mind but yet you've come to a place that you have said I love the Lord Jesus I don't care what happens if I ever get healed or whatever and now when you see my mother-in-law she's taking care of our five kids this weekend if that tells you anything of how she is mentally God supernaturally touched her in her mind and her body and in her life she was in a desert place but she had to get to a place where where she realized that she loved God and sometimes God will take us to the depths of Despair right in order for us to realize wow I do love him amen praise the Lord praise the Lord so we see at age 40 Moses fled uh Egypt after slaying a man in the wilderness he fled to a desert place and there God got a hold of Moses by the way of a burning bush and brother Bram said that it took 40 years in the backside of the desert to unlearn Moses of the 40 years that he had learned while in Egypt in the sermon Faith 1957 brother brandham said how that Moses after having 40 Years of religious training by his mother how having 40 Years of military might in his hands of how to whip a nation how to conquer and it taken God 40 years to take it out of him but once out there in the wilderness alone one day he came face to face with God right now when he was at the youth banquet not when he was at the at the church service not when he was around all of the Believers but when God got him in the wilderness alone then God began to speak to Moses Moses slayed an Egyptian living off his mother's revelation our understanding that God was going to use him to deliver the children of Israel and it made nothing but a stink in the sand his mother had raised him in the house of pharaoh you're going to be the deliverer they're going to listen to you you're God's anointed you're you're you're going to stand and you're going to deliver you're going to be the deliverer that the people of Israel have been looking for from Egypt but yet when he tried to do it by his mother's Revelation and he took it into his own hands and he slave an Egyptian what happened the people said to him huh you want to tell us what to do what about that Egyptian that you killed over there the other day they turned against him it did nothing but make us stink in the sand of a dead Egyptian understand with us we can't live off of pastor's revelation we can't live off of Mom and Dad's Revelation but we have to have our own Revelation in order to fight this good fight of Faith just like David of old when David of old he said I'll I'll kill that who is this this uncircumcised Philistine how dare he come and and defy the armies of Israel he's got a big mouth and I'm going to shut it Saul says oh this young boy he's got some he's got some Zeal let's bring him in here here I'm going to give you all my ecclesiastical training gives him his shield his armor his helmet his spear it didn't fit him here was David I think we have in our mind of David as a a little a little tiny boy and stuff and and all that but I I personally think David was a warrior you know you ever see these uh you see these guys that work out and they're big and they're buff and they can't really move much you know that's kind of how Goliath was well I see David not being a scrawny kid I see him like like an Idaho farmer out here like Gideon I kind of see him like Gideon a little bit back there big old forearms and you know no fat not much fat on him and a good good pair of hands and stuff and yeah this guy's going to take care of business he might not look big and stuff like Goliath but he's wiy that's how I see him take it or leave it it's up to you but here he was and he said this this this this shield and and all these things I haven't proved these things I don't know these things this is not my Revelation this is Saul's Revelation he has proved these things there's one thing that I have that I know that works and that's this little slingshot and I know that if I get a couple of smooth stones from the brook there a few stones that have been through of a few rainy days you know a stone that's smooth in the brook it's been there for a while it's seen a lot of weather it's seen a lot of fish pass by it's seen a lot of weeds pass by but it's been molded by the weather till it's smooth right a revelation that stands F AI t h j s u s here David picks up these Stones he didn't need five stones but for God just to prove that it takes Faith to beat a Goliath he picks up five you don't need to have all of the understanding of this scripture you just need to have a little Revelation here and there you don't need to be able to to to uh uh explain it to everybody take what you have and use it the faith that he had in what he had proved before with the lion and the bear killed Goliath a lot of times in our lives God will use a lion and a bear experience because he knows that we have a Goliath that's laying ahead of us that's it so notice where he was he was in the backside of the desert what was Moses's purpose for being there it was for him to to meet God face to face and it was because of his previous choices of slaying an Egyptian that took him to that place some of you give yourselves such a hard time on past choices and past decisions but let me say this if you believe that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and that God is with us and that he has paved a way for us and we're walking in his perfect will your bad choice are the choices that led you to this spot in your life whether you think it was good or it was bad it was all orchestrated of God that's the truth so give yourself a break gentlemen give yourself a break Brothers those choices that you think were poor sure they might have been poor but God is using them for his Kingdom's glory to make you walk in his perfect will that's what he did to Moses so God called him and uh he took him to the he took him to the Mount of horb one time which is called siai and at that place God gave Moses the Ten Commandments what was it it was in a desert Place why did he lead him to a desert place to begin with because he wanted to meet with Moses face to face why did he take him to a desert place in Mount Si because he wanted to reveal his word to Moses it has two parts to it now put yourself there don't just think of the story let's be spiritual because everything that we preach all comes back to you and I as Believers every example that we give we should be able to bring it back to us as Believers because if we can't apply the word to our lives it's no good for us so it was God to reveal himself and also for God to reveal his word onto him Paul was on the road down to Damascus one time excuse me Paul was on the road down to Damascus one time to persecute the Church of the Living God when a light appeared from the heavens and the light spoke to him and it said Saul Saul why are you persecuting me why are you doing this to me and brother brandham said that Paul had enough uh teaching and learning he was he was a Jew that he would never have called that light Lord unless he knew that it was God Elohim and so he said Lord Who Art Thou after all his training with celeia after all his his his ecclesiastical uh learning and whatever it might have been he said Lord I don't know you who are you you know you can go to a message church and you can learn the the precepts and the dogmas and you can learn the the doct and all those different things and still not know him I want to know him and in the power of his resurrection and he told him exactly who he was he said I am Jesus The Great I Am what was he showing him that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament right Hallelujah the God above us was the god with us and now he's that same God that same Pillar of Fire that same holy ghost that same being that lives within us my how mind-blowing is that huh you know why you can't accept that because you look at your flesh too much of the time right look at the desire of your heart right you know the Apostle Paul one time he said he said uh when I try to do good evil is with me and those things that I want to do I can't do them and the things that I don't want to do those are the things that I do the Apostle Paul First Church age messenger had the same issues that we have in our life but he said he said my grace Lord told him my grace is sufficient for you and I want to say this morning that God's grace is sufficient for you because he that began the work is able to finish the work so don't lay down when you get knocked down get back up again why because God's grace is sufficient don't look at your carnal man but look at the desire that's coming from the heart if you have any kind of desire to serve God if you have any kind of desire to pray and read your Bible it's because God has placed it within our hearts amen oh the love of God hallelujah that light blinded Paul took him off his high horse didn't it God blinded Paul in the natural so that he could open his eyes in the spiritual I pray that the Lord does that to each and every one of us father blind our eyes to materialistic things to bigger houses bigger cars better things more money all the different things that that makes the world go round that makes it easier to live I don't care about living easy In the Flesh I just want to live for him I have a desire to live for him these things are they're slowly fading away from my life yeah amen and I hope they are from yours too because what happens to much we get caught up in chasing the Mighty Dollar we get too too caught up and chasing the nice nicer things trying to keep up with the Joneses who cares I hope there's no Joneses here who cares about the Joneses and what color they painted their curbs at the front of their house let them do it man live for God who cares if someone in the church got a nicer vehicle than you and you feel you have to keep up with them who cares your vehicle gets you from A to B back to a again it's does a good job keep it amen okay sorry brother Paul maybe that's the pastor that should preach that stuff I feel at home so you know I I just kind of preach like how I preach at home so yeah further Paul can speak to me in the back I saw a big stick back there Galatians 1:1 15-17 but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach among the Heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went into Arabia and turned again onto Damascus what did Paul do Paul went to a desert place he didn't go asking everybody else's opinion but he got by himself he spent time with God and into a desert place and when he went there and when he went back to to meet with the Believers guess what he was saying the same thing that they were saying why because it's the same Pillar of Fire the same Holy Ghost God that was given the Revelation to the apostles as to the Apostle pet Paul if we get the same Holy Spirit we'll say the same thing we get the same Holy Spirit we'll think the same way we'll dress the same way our lives will be very similar why because he is God and he changes not Christ is the mystery of God revealed Paul went down then till he got all of his ecclesiastical stuff cut off of him down at the backside of the desert for three and a half years down there in Arabia until he learned the word and the word became he and he became a prisoner here was Paul putting people in prison but now Paul himself became a prisoner Here We Come Back In Chains of love all my Seminary experience is gone I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ amen Filman my brother I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ I only can speak and say what he tells me to speak I say God help us to keep our mouths shut when it should be shut and to say something when it needs to be said amen so what was God doing to Paul in the desert desert of Arabia he was revealing himself to him through the scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah later on Paul was in another desert place in his life he was shut up in a jail in a dungeon everybody thought he was all washed up everybody had forsaken him he said Demus has forsaken me for this for this evil world and here he is writing and brother brandham types this stage of Paul's life to his own Ministry he says everybody has forsaken me even Deus sharan huh here he was all by himself in a desert place but when Paul was in a dungeon guess what happened he wrote most of the New Testament books right so what was God doing to Paul first of all in Arabia he was revealing himself to him that Jesus was the Messiah but here he was in a dark cold dungeon all by himself in a desert place what was God doing he was revealed feeling the word that the word might be given to the people are we starting to see that God does things in desert places let's give one more example in our day we see that brother brandham himself ever since he was a little boy he he was never really satisfied with the country that he had lived in that he was living in and he longed somehow he always wanted to go west and you know we all believe that everybody should move to Arizona sure it's yeah brother Bram said that Phoenix is the closest thing to Heaven direct quote maybe in the 60s huh not no more he always wanted to go west ever since he was a little boy even when that astronomer that one time told him he said that he would never be success uccessful in the East but he would have to move west and you all know the layout of the Tabernacle that whenever the high priest would would enter the Tabernacle that he would enter from the East heading towards the West into the Tabernacle to perform his duties then he would leave heading to the east again so he would come from the East the high priest he would go in towards the West he would perform his duties he would turn back out again and he would go towards the east one more time the seven seal brother brandom said because before we even went into it and I left to go west the Lord showed me a vision one day about 10:00 one morning and I come and explained it here that I had seen it didn't know what it was it was a constellation of seven angels we we we remember that you'll get it on the tape called what time is it sir well now now that is exactly what you're seeing now the seven angels I was in the west you remember the little bitty Messengers they went East the second messengers the dove little little bit larger bird they went East and I looked they was with me all the time that was that first and second pool now the third came from the West sweeping forward with great terrific speed and they picked me up that was that was coming back East with the mystery of the Seven Seals so notice what God was doing in the Old Testament with the high priest to Israel he was doing the exact same thing with the if you want to call it the high priest of the church Age The Prophet messenger brother brandham he was bringing him from the East taking him towards the West raising him up in this constellation of angels to do what to reveal the word but he didn't leave him in the west he brought him back East one more time where did he lead him to a desert place all alone no one would have fellowship with him he only preached a couple of times in a few years in Tucson and Phoenix people had closed the doors what was God doing getting brother brandham alone in a A wilderness place a desert place for a purpose that he might reveal his word to his servant prophet he says now the third picked me up just like it said in junior Jackson's dream that the Lord let me interpret him for there on the inside of that pyramid there was white stone that wasn't written on that's the reason I had to go west to connect with these angels message to come back here to reveal it to the church remember I said the next things that happen will be here at the church that's just exactly what is this what is this Cloud all about what was the purpose of this cloud is it is it just a picture that we hang upon our walls that we know nothing about but what was the reason for it what was this Cloud brother Brenham said there it is he said I was looking at it and and and I was looking at it in Life magazine and and and the Science magazine and stuff and and the angel someone they talked to him and said turn it to the right and he said oh I wasn't sure if I heard it right but but I obeyed The Voice anyways he said and I took it and I turned it to the right and there it was he says Hoffman's head of Christ he says there it is you can see his eyes you can see his his beard and you can see the the the the the white wig of his hair showing that he is supreme authority that he is supreme authority of Heaven he is supreme authority of Earth you see brother brandham was looking at it through the eyes of man he was looking at it through the anointing of man but when he was told to turn it to the right and he obeyed The Voice he was no longer looking at his bible through the Through The Eyes of Clarence Lin he was no longer looking at his bible Through The Eyes of hislop's 2 Babylons and all these different man that he had read before but now he was looking at it with prophetic Insight he was looking at it through the very Mind Of God because that's what this cloud is all about it was all about God sharing his mind the Mysteries that have been hidden since the foundations of the world with his servant amen it's more than a picture it's more than a story it's a supernatural event that God was fulfilling scripture that God was bringing things to pass that God was finishing up with the Gentile dispensation finishing his work is almost completed time is almost over the seals have been revealed the mind of God has been made known to the people to the Bride of Jesus Christ where are we at brother brandom said if I could get her to sit stand still long enough in the presence of the son I'll dress her in the word what are we doing right now we're standing still we're waiting God hasn't lost no power we're not depending upon emotions and all these different things no we're waiting we're standing still we're saying Lord here I am in your presence dress me with this un uh this word that has been unveiled right before us I want to ask you a question brother Paul says that you guys answer questions back when will the work to the Gentiles be completed somebody tell me rapture the Rapture people like to say well yeah time time will be no more when these things are revealed but brother brandham said that he's still on the throne intercessing that's in the seals right what is he waiting for he's waiting for that last one to come into the body and take their position in Christ then he leaves the seat of mediating for the people then he comes for his bride and when the Rapture takes place there's no more representation of blood here upon the Earth the days of the Gentiles are completed there will be no one else saved in the Gentile dispensation when that time happens so is it all over now are we in the Millennium no there's still time there's still Grace and I hope that there is because I got little kids that need to come into that grace of God Amen the work was he said it is finished the work of redemption but it is completed for the Gentile dispensation at the going away of the the Bride of Jesus Christ then he turns to the Jews you see him already turning to the Jews you see the red haers and all these different things and Israel's in war and and everything like that and uh you know what what's kind of funny and I'll just share this with you um uh people see that more of a sign of the end time Believers a sign of the end time than Malachi 4 sometimes hey man we've received our last sign turned his back to the audience I I give you your last sign just as MDC had his back turned to the tent and he revealed the secrets that was in Sarah's heart brother brandom done the exact same thing what was he showing as it was in the days of lot so shall it be he said I give you your last sign we have received our last sign no matter what goes on in the world so we should turn to the message of the hour which is Christ instead of turning to CNN instead of turning to Fox News amen okay uh anointed ones at the end time 1965 notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pool was the opening of them seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it so what was God doing to brother brandham he was getting him apart in a desert place in Arizona just like he did with Moses and just like he did with Paul and he was giving him the revelation of the word for this day in which we are now living in and that's what God has to do to us sometimes God has to get us to a a desert Place feels like we're all alone it's dusty it's dirty we got no friends around us you don't get invited to things that other people get invited to in the church and you just feel all by yourself but I want you to remember this that God uses desert places in our lives just like he did with the Apostle Paul just like he did with Moses just like he did with brother brandom he's going to do it to you and I Wilderness experience es desert experiences are not always a sign that God is rebuking you but rather it is a time of molding and shaping of your character when God had delivered Israel through the Red Sea he led them three days into the Wilderness to test their Faith remember what God remember what happened to Jesus whenever uh whenever the the spirit like a Dove came down upon him where did it lead him to desert Place led him into the Wilderness why so that his faith might be Tried by Satan the trying of your faith bringeth forth pure gold bringeth forth character which is the only thing that we're going to have with us on the other side I like that especially those of us who don't like how you look and and all that stuff you know right now and everything hey when we get over there you'll be perfect amen yeah you'll look like a 20 20year old you in shape how nice will that be I'm 36 I don't think I'm past that yet am I maybe I can get back there we'll see let's see here okay I'll try to hurry up Mo uh Exodus 15: 22-2 so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the Wilderness of sh and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water and when they came to Mara they could not drink of the Waters of Mara for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called Mara what was happening they had bitterness in their hearts they got sticky because they were being led into a Wilderness experience when God leads you to the Wilderness don't get bitter get happy because God is doing something in your life the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink and he cried onto the Lord and showed him a a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statue and an ordinance that there he proved them what was he proven to them he was proven to them that he was their provider that he was with them but it took something Supernatural for them to realize that God was with them understand the supernatural it just catches our attention but the Bible says blessed is he who has not seen yet believes Hallelujah let me skip some stuff here Jesus himself when he was baptized he entered into the Wilderness for 40 days Luke 9: 11 and 12 and the people when they knew it followed him and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of God and he healed them that had need of healing and when the day began to wear away then came the TW and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and Country roundabout and lodge and get vict VI victuals for we are here in a desert place where was Jesus leading the people that they may receive their healings and deliverances in a desert Place Mark 6: 34-36 and Jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things and when the day was now far spent his disciples came on to him and said this is a desert place and now the time is far pasted where was he Leading the People to desert places am places of uncomfortableness places of wilderness places that it would seem where our needs are not be met being met but that's where God leads his people Jesus himself took his disciples into a desert place to teach them the things of God you see God uses desert places in our lives let's read our opening scripture Deuteronomy 8: 2-6 and follow along with me and it says and thou shalt verse two says and thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness now he's going to share with us why they were LED Into the Wilderness and I want you to put your name there within that scripture within that that example don't just leave it as a story but apply it to yourself that's when the minister says when you see yourself in the book this is what we're talking abouten when you see you put you in the behold I send you Elijah that's me behold I send Stephen so now we're going to look through this and we're going to see why God sends us as Believers to desert places he says uh uh the 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keepest keep his Commandments or no so why is he leading Us in verse two it's to Humble us it's to prove us and my interpretation of that is for us to see what's in our hearts right of how much we really love God because he already knows what's in our hearts amen verse three and he humbled thee and he suffered thee with Mana which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee to know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord doth Man live what's he doing with us in verse four in verse three he's saying that man May learn to live by not bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God every word that's written within this scripture I'm going to take you to a desert place that you might have faith in my written word to know not to live by bread alone but to have your faith in my promised word verse four thy reignment wax not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these 40 years what was he wanting us to know here that God provides all of our needs it's in real desert experiences that we realize that God is our only provider yes verse 5 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chastens his son so the Lord thy God chastens the why does he bring us to desert places to chasen us to correct us to get us alone like a good father does he never embarrasses or spanks his kids in front of anybody else but he takes him into a room separate and he treats him with respect and corrects out of love that's what God does with us as Believers takes us aside into a desert place and he gives us a good old weapon you know what chances are we never got a spanking we never deserved yeah one way or another we deserved it whether it was heavy-handed or not hey yeah I did wrong and I deserve it father forgive me what does it bring in our lives it brings peace you know as a father what I've noticed with my with my children especially my boys you know boys particularly they respond to to being chastised and it brings a peace in their heart and a love for Dad and a respect that kids who don't get chastened or spanked however you want to say it they don't have that same love and respect for their kids my father-in-law I whenever they have our kids I give them full Authority hey Whip them if you feel they need it you give it to them and that makes him so happy I ain't I ain't one of these dads and my wife isn't one of these moms that hey don't you dare touch my that's my kid Papa that's my kid Mama nope they're out of line in your house your rules you deal with it as you should you know my boys have such a love for their papa they listen they respect him they can't wait to run and give him a hug while why because love is corrective it's almost a paradox but God does that with us when do we feel the love of God most in our hearts is when he corrects us and we're sorry and we repent and we say father I am so sorry I'm a silly person I've made this mistake I did this I did that I said that I didn't mean to Lord please forgive me when does it come after the correction it yields that Peaceable love and spirit within our lives we say wow thank you Lord verse six therefore Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to fear Him what is it what what is this Wilderness experience doing is teaching us to walk in his ways and to fear Him as the musicians come this morning we'll bring this to a close Moses David Paul brother brandom and even the Lord Jesus himself they all spent time in a desert place before God could use them for something greater in their lives and it's no different with you and I God ain't is going to give you some big position or something like this or whatever it may be that a lot of people are chasing after until first that person has been proven until that person has met God and face to face in a Wilderness experience God ain't going to just go ahead and start playing there brother whatever whatever song you want uh God just doesn't let us get away with anything he doesn't just leave us out here to live whatever kind of life we want but he leads us to places of sometimes Darkness places of desert dry Dusty hard sometimes it seems like unlivable circumstances and he gets us all by ourselves and all alone and a lot of times we think in our lives well it's because God doesn't love me and I'm here and I'm struggling and this and that and we have a big old pity party for ourselves but really it's the love of God that's leading us to those places in our Lives why is he doing it just like he did with Moses just like he did with Paul just like he did with brother brandham and just like he did with Jesus so that he could meet him face to face and so that he could reveal his word onto them and God does the exact same thing with you and I he has such a desire to reveal his word to you in a personal way he has such a desire to make himself known to you in a such a uh I would say a romantic way almost that he gets you by yourself away from the crowds of people away from family away from loved ones away from church people sometimes even though you're in church he gets you a little separated why because his love for you is so great and he has such a passion that he wants to have a an intimate relationship with you he knows that he can't do it with other voices in the way so he pulls us back he gets us alone through circumstances of life and he says here I am here's my love here's my word I'm going to reveal myself to you now you're in a place where you're not distracted by the world you're all by yourself it's just where I want you perhaps many of you here this morning you've been there and you've done that but you didn't exactly know why God was doing it now you know perhaps some of you are in this very place right now in your lives a desert place you fill in the blank I want you to know that God has a purpose for this desert place it is not a time for you to give in it is not a time for you to walk out it is not a time for you to quit it's not a time for you to lay down and stay down no it is a time for you to seek God it is a time for you to be intimate with God to reach out and say father here I am all by myself I'm no one else's but yours now speak to my heart and use me as you would let's all Stand Together praise the Lord I trust that uh the next time you're in a situation that you you look at the bigger picture winners never quit and quitters never win just because you're in a Wilderness experience let me let me say this quitting Church don't fix anything no a lot of times changing Church don't fix anything sometimes it does brother brother Ron always says everybody at our church is happy some are happy to come some are happy to leave everybody's happy we are in a such a battle many people are quitting walking away Turning Away preachers preachers that we've loved enjoyed their Ministries what happened it's between them and God but us I choose this day to serve the Lord whether I'm on a Mountaintop whether I'm in a desert place whether I'm halfway up the mountain to my Mountain Victory I'm going to be happy in the Lord because I know that my footsteps are ordered of him because I am a righteous man by his blood amen let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord I I I love you and I thank you for this for this thought and for this sermon Lord and I pray that it would just have a lasting effect on the lives of your children I ask one more time for a a blessing upon our our pastor brother Paul and his wife in the assembly here may you give wisdom and inspiration and and anointing and Leadership and guidance Lord for the for the Saints here at Grace Tabernacle father God I I just ask now for traveling mercies for those that would travel after we have the potluck at the park here and may you just take everyone to their homes safely Lord and and in the joys of the Lord and father when we start to get sticky in our lives may we may we not point the finger to other people but may we realize that we've gotten away from the Fountain of Life So remind us of these things Lord and we'll be sure to give you the honor all the glory and all the praise for it only belongs onto thee father in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen if we could have the words please to this song you know know what what song are we singing day of redemption oh day of
