[43:29] but look at those words right there
[43:31] father
[43:33] i see you see it's not the preacher it's
[43:36] not men
[43:37] i see you father drawing a line in the
[43:39] sand
[43:41] hallelujah now you think about that i'll
[43:44] get off my sermon this morning on this
[43:46] right here but
[43:47] you think about that line in the sand we
[43:50] think well some people will say well
[43:52] god's
[43:52] cutting some people out and some people
[43:55] in
[43:56] i'll tell you what he's doing my brother
[43:57] and sister people say well
[43:59] it's not fair it's not fair that god
[44:03] would
[44:03] save some
[44:07] and judge others
[44:10] do you realize if we got what was fair
[44:12] every one of us would go to hell
[44:16] this has nothing to do with fear this
[44:18] has to do with god's grace
[44:20] and i say thank you lord that your grace
[44:23] is sufficient and your grace chose me
[44:27] hallelujah otherwise there's none of us
[44:31] righteous none of us are holy
[44:34] but the line that he drew in the sand my
[44:37] brother and sister
[44:38] is also a two-way street you see it
[44:41] shows you
[44:42] what side you're on and it also showed
[44:45] the devil the line he can't cross
[44:48] amen we stay in the word we just stay in
[44:50] the presence of almighty god and his
[44:52] presence is with us
[44:54] amen see i want to be standing on your
[44:57] side lord
[44:58] and i want to be holding your hand lord
[45:01] so let your kingdom come
[45:04] well praise the lord his kingdom's
[45:06] coming regardless
[45:08] but i want it living in me i don't want
[45:11] to just talk about the kingdom of god
[45:12] has come we see the signs we see the
[45:15] evidence
[45:16] we see this here the prophet of god
[45:17] saying he is here
[45:19] some people are going no no that can't
[45:21] be if he's here he's off the mercy seat
[45:24] but go study the message the prophet of
[45:25] god said
[45:26] that god is on the mercy seat of the
[45:30] believer
[45:32] all the time hallelujah
[45:35] this is my prayer this
[45:38] is my plea good to be in the house of
[45:42] the lord today
[45:43] amen just uh i think you know there was
[45:47] something i told you i was trying to
[45:48] remember
[45:49] brother vasily i think back on the road
[45:51] let's just lift him up in prayer
[45:54] definitely a tough world out there amen

[46:08] kinds of believers the little breakdown
[46:10] graph
[46:11] now saints i hope you this morning don't
[46:13] mind just
[46:14] kind of a tad bit of humor if we could
[46:18] ever
[46:18] i was watching some news online and if
[46:21] we could ever get that guy that was
[46:23] running around
[46:24] the uh congressional building with a
[46:27] buffalo head on
[46:28] we could ever get him converted he would
[46:32] change the worship in your church
[46:35] yeah for goodness sakes
[46:38] a man so uninhibited that he could run
[46:43] out in public with tattoos and paint in
[46:45] a buffalo head
[46:47] in his shorts and they call us crazy
[46:55] you can do anything in the name of the
[46:56] world and you're all right
[46:58] you do anything in the name of the lord
[47:01] and you're a radical
[47:03] boy i'll tell you what if this is not
[47:06] the word
[47:07] coming to pass when it said that they
[47:09] would call
[47:10] good evil and evil good
[47:14] oh look at the world we're living in but
[47:17] praise the lord it said when we saw that
[47:22] don't get all dejected and start looking
[47:24] down like oh
[47:26] what's wrong what's going to happen no
[47:28] look up your redemption is nigh
[47:30] hallelujah amen well thank you lord
[47:34] hallelujah thank you brother jason
[47:36] sister emmy
[47:38] amen very encouraging uh sister naughty
[47:40] i appreciated that
[47:41] i was so engrossed in my thoughts i
[47:44] never lifted a hand to even
[47:46] give praise to the lord and
[47:48] encouragement to you
[47:50] um but uh that is i love that song
[47:53] i believe amen hallelujah i've got
[47:56] nothing i've got nothing else to do but
[47:59] belief
[48:00] i i look in the world out here and i see
[48:03] all the chaos and oh wasn't it wonderful
[48:06] to receive a stimulus
[48:08] check amen
[48:12] deposited in your bank account you just
[48:15] contributed to the bankruptcy of the
[48:17] united states of america
[48:19] and we can say thank you lord because a
[48:21] prophet said
[48:23] that this nation would be completely
[48:25] broke and come to a place it must be
[48:27] bailed out
[48:28] and there would be only one to bala now
[48:31] look at this
[48:32] in this short course of years we
[48:35] absolutely double the national debt
[48:38] and yet there's a debt behind the debt
[48:40] that they don't tell us about
[48:42] and that is the one where they secured
[48:45] you
[48:46] that's right as the guarantor of the
[48:49] debt
[48:53] sounds very conspiratorial
[49:02] on saints when this breaks open
[49:07] sons and daughters of god i think will
[49:09] it'll break that last little veneer that
[49:11] we have when this breaks open and we
[49:13] will be there
[49:14] and see the absolute enormity of what
[49:17] god saved us from
[49:20] oh hallelujah i say i'ma let's lift our
[49:22] hands if you would amen
[49:24] just give a little thank you lord for
[49:26] your saving grace
[49:27] it's not just from our sin my brother
[49:29] and sister but it's from an insanity
[49:32] and god is saving us from an insanity
[49:35] hallelujah hallelujah so if you
[49:39] would let's see let's just go right here
[49:41] so
[49:42] you probably haven't seen this for a
[49:43] while because i've been focused mostly
[49:47] on this side of being
[49:48] sold out but instead of preaching this
[49:51] all the way through
[49:52] i've kind of reached a little point i
[49:54] want to come and instead of
[49:56] like i said the other day jumping all
[49:58] the way over to being sold out
[50:00] on lucifer's side i i'm going to kind of
[50:04] something i was just reading just part
[50:06] of my my
[50:07] devotions my bible that's by my chair
[50:09] there and
[50:10] and you know i just read along it takes
[50:12] me sometimes weeks to get through a
[50:14] single chapter
[50:16] and uh you know i was just reading the
[50:18] other day and
[50:19] so we're going to kind of have a a
[50:21] little thought today if it would be my
[50:23] brother and sister
[50:24] because while this is nothing special
[50:27] right when brother paul put this
[50:28] together it wasn't like some revelation
[50:30] came to me
[50:31] but i want you to look at that and i
[50:33] want you to realize how profound a
[50:35] little graph like this is that anyone
[50:37] could have created
[50:38] it's very profound because you see uh
[50:42] it is this absolute uh
[50:45] separation amen that brings a contrast
[50:49] in our lives it's the absolute
[50:51] separation that shows us that without
[50:54] god's grace in our life
[50:56] uh we actually would have get this now
[50:59] many of us would be saying no i'm lost
[51:01] i would have been lost i would have been
[51:02] lost but and i don't disagree with that
[51:05] but i want you to understand the most
[51:06] profound separation is not between here
[51:09] and here the most profound separation is
[51:13] is that we could have went all the years
[51:15] of our life
[51:16] believing we were serving god in a
[51:19] religious spirit
[51:21] only to wake up lost as we spoke to you
[51:24] the other day
[51:26] the rich ruler amen so the most profound
[51:30] so what we're going to do today by god's
[51:32] grace
[51:33] we're just going to kind of have a
[51:34] little blending here but i'm still
[51:36] can't quite get away from just preaching
[51:38] to the bride
[51:40] amen it's hard to get too excited about
[51:42] preaching about the lost
[51:44] amen if they want to get saved don't let
[51:47] anything hinder you give your heart to
[51:48] the lord
[51:49] don't hold back don't say well if i
[51:51] could see this if i could see that
[51:53] if lightning would strike only the
[51:55] tulips
[51:58] i i could believe no take the song
[52:01] sister nadia
[52:02] i believe just let your heart believe we
[52:04] were created to believe
[52:06] amen we were not created to to
[52:09] have a doubt or a fear of god that's
[52:12] satan's influence
[52:14] and that's why the world is going to be
[52:15] in such a profound
[52:17] agony when that anointing comes off
[52:22] and they realize how little it took for
[52:25] satan
[52:26] to deceive them that's going to be the
[52:29] people that are going to sign cry a nash
[52:32] gnashing of teeth
[52:35] see those that are sold out to the devil
[52:37] lucifer they're going to gnash their
[52:39] teeth because they're angry
[52:41] but there's going to be a lot of people
[52:42] who are in this middle ground their
[52:44] teeth are going to gnash
[52:46] to realize how little it took for satan
[52:51] you know america has such an issue right
[52:53] now we're going back and we're
[52:55] living history 300 years as it were ago
[53:00] and
[53:01] we're recriminating people
[53:05] you know the founding fathers of america
[53:08] they lived in their day just like we
[53:10] live in our day
[53:12] and imagined if the day would come that
[53:14] everything we've done
[53:15] would be looked in retrospect and
[53:17] someone would say see how evil they were
[53:19] how bad they were how unkind they were
[53:23] and i saw a deal the other day and this
[53:25] woman is talking about how
[53:27] that we should go to mount rushmore and
[53:28] blow the faces off the mountain because
[53:31] it's uh one domineering man and two
[53:34] slave owners on land that was stolen
[53:36] from the indians
[53:39] well the prophet of god even talks about
[53:41] how our nation didn't do right
[53:44] to our native americans right and we're
[53:47] going back and we're reliving
[53:49] uh what was slavery and all of this and
[53:53] it's interesting the narrative of all of
[53:55] this my brother and sister because you
[53:57] see
[53:57] what satan is doing i hope you catch
[53:59] this satan is doing
[54:01] is he he's not causing the people to
[54:04] look
[54:05] forward see that's what the true word of
[54:08] god preached to you
[54:10] will cause you to look forward
[54:13] you're not looking back to what you was
[54:16] but you're looking to what god
[54:18] said you are but look what satan's doing
[54:21] he's taking
[54:22] nations and causing them to look back
[54:25] amen and all that looking back does i
[54:27] don't care right in your own life
[54:29] now those of you that made mistakes
[54:33] that's right well do you bitter good to
[54:36] look back
[54:38] our hope is in the lord that is looking
[54:42] forward
[54:43] so what they're doing is they're looking
[54:44] back to our nation they were slaves
[54:47] and and they were this and they were
[54:48] that but you know let's
[54:50] study real history and we'll realize
[54:52] that all through the ages no matter what
[54:55] your color people were taken and sold as
[54:58] slaves
[55:00] think of the little jewish girl amen
[55:04] but god sent her there so that she could
[55:08] testify
[55:09] i would that my master would know
[55:13] that there is a god a prophet
[55:16] in israel
[55:20] would have been better if she'd never
[55:21] been taken prisoner and raised in her
[55:23] own household
[55:25] but you see my brother and sister we
[55:28] look forward
[55:29] lord thy will be done so i want to hurry
[55:33] up and get going here
[55:34] because we're getting started a little
[55:35] late and i'm a little slow
[55:38] but we're going to be kind of a blending
[55:39] of this today so
[55:41] amen if we'll just come i want to preach
[55:43] to you today
[55:44] this is a season um
[55:56] this is a time i mean i was looking at
[55:58] the screen here excuse me
[56:00] this is a time that we will live or die
[56:03] by the word test
[56:05] and we'll draw this out of uh
[56:08] judges the 12th chapter and uh
[56:12] in that my brother and sister we will
[56:14] then take
[56:15] these things and look at the word of god
[56:18] today
[56:21] so we just thank the lord for god's
[56:24] grace and mercy
[56:28] amen
[56:34] judges the 12th chapter starting with
[56:36] the first verse
[56:39] and the men of ephraim gathered
[56:42] themselves together and went northward
[56:44] and said unto jephthah wherefore
[56:48] passes thou over to fight against the
[56:51] children of
[56:51] ammon and did us not call us to go with
[56:55] thee
[56:57] we will burn thy house upon thee
[57:00] with fire that sounds like some real
[57:03] friends isn't it
[57:05] you didn't invite us to the party so
[57:08] we're going to burn your house down
[57:11] i'm telling you i don't need friends
[57:12] like that
[57:14] amen this story goes much deeper and
[57:16] we'll touch on that in just a minute
[57:19] and jephthah said unto them i and my
[57:22] people were at great strife with the
[57:24] children of amen and when i
[57:26] called you you delivered me not out of
[57:29] their hands
[57:30] so really what we have saints here is a
[57:33] more of a jealousy issue
[57:36] because um the men of ephraim were
[57:39] actually afraid
[57:40] to go up against the people of amen
[57:45] and to them they wanted not just to go
[57:49] bail jephthah and the gideonites out
[57:52] they wanted a formal invitation that
[57:55] they
[57:55] might have been able to come and enjoyed
[57:59] all of the the pomp and circumstance of
[58:03] an alliance joining together but my
[58:06] brother and sister no matter what your
[58:07] battle is we're not here to create
[58:10] alliances that are outside of god's word
[58:13] god would rather you fought alone than
[58:16] to bind yourself to someone who proves
[58:18] to be a hindrance to you
[58:20] you can say but this person is my friend
[58:22] i enjoy this company on that
[58:25] are you uh fighting for exactly the same
[58:28] thing if you're not
[58:29] you'll find yourself actually unequally
[58:31] yoked
[58:33] hallelujah and so we look at this he
[58:35] says unto them i and my people are a
[58:37] great strife with the children of amen
[58:39] and when i
[58:39] called you you delivered me not out of
[58:41] their hands and when i saw that you
[58:43] delivered me not
[58:45] i put my life in my hands and passed
[58:48] over against the children of ammon
[58:50] and the lord delivered them into my hand
[58:53] now we'll touch in just a minute at the
[58:55] great cost
[58:56] that came for them being delivered into
[58:58] his hand
[58:59] wherefore then ye come up unto me this
[59:02] day to fight
[59:03] against me then jephthah gathered
[59:06] together
[59:07] all the men of gilead and fought with
[59:09] ephraim and the men
[59:11] of gilead smote ephraim because they
[59:14] said ye gileadites
[59:15] are fugitives of ephraim
[59:18] among the ephraimites and among the
[59:21] menacites
[59:23] and the gideonites took the passages of
[59:26] jordan before the ephraimites
[59:29] and it was so that when those
[59:31] ephemerites
[59:32] which were escaped said let me go over
[59:36] that the men of gilead said unto him art
[59:39] thou
[59:40] and ephraimite if he said nay
[59:44] now i hope you can follow where we're
[59:46] coming i'm taking this context of
[59:48] scripture
[59:48] a word test
[59:53] then said they unto him say now
[59:57] should be left
[1:00:00] and he said sibyleth
[1:00:04] for he could not frame to pronounce it
[1:00:08] right
[1:00:09] then they took him and slew him at the
[1:00:11] passages of jordan
[1:00:12] and there fell at that time of the
[1:00:14] ephemites forty and two
[1:00:16] thousand you see
[1:00:22] it was a word test heavenly father we
[1:00:25] just ask you lord for your blessings
[1:00:27] upon the service
[1:00:28] today lead us guide us father be in full
[1:00:30] control we ask in your name
[1:00:32] amen you may be seated
[1:00:37] now we look here at this great conflict
[1:00:40] that took place and i think my brother
[1:00:42] and sister if we would just look at a
[1:00:44] little human element we would find that
[1:00:46] probably
[1:00:46] jephthah was not uh in a frame of mind
[1:00:50] to to play games with these people
[1:00:52] because while they
[1:00:53] kind of claimed to be their brothers or
[1:00:56] part of you know a a relationship
[1:00:58] there uh they were simply in something
[1:01:01] for themselves and
[1:01:03] if we'll just uh if you would just uh
[1:01:05] you got your bibles open still just go
[1:01:07] back to the 11th chapter
[1:01:09] and you'll find the backstory or the
[1:01:11] history of what is happening here
[1:01:13] and as jephthah is fighting against
[1:01:15] amenites coming down that the battle is
[1:01:18] very sore and he he raises up
[1:01:21] into a position that he says lord
[1:01:25] if you will let me uh be victorious in
[1:01:28] this battle
[1:01:30] then lord whatever it is that i see when
[1:01:33] i come to my home i will
[1:01:35] offer that up to you as a sacrifice
[1:01:39] all my brother and sister the lord comes
[1:01:41] on the scene so you know god heard that
[1:01:43] prayer
[1:01:43] the lord comes on the scene gives them
[1:01:45] the victory but yet when he goes back to
[1:01:48] his house
[1:01:49] the very first thing he sees is his
[1:01:51] precious
[1:01:52] daughter and she comes running out to
[1:01:54] him and she can't understand why
[1:01:57] her her father's countenance is fallen
[1:02:00] and he is distressed and she presses him
[1:02:03] to know why
[1:02:04] and he shares that now this little girl
[1:02:07] doesn't speak words like father you've
[1:02:09] betrayed me and how could you do this to
[1:02:11] me
[1:02:11] but she understands and so she's there
[1:02:15] and uh you know the agreement they make
[1:02:17] is that she would be able to go with her
[1:02:19] friends and bewail her virginity
[1:02:22] now some people reading that carnally
[1:02:24] it's interesting when you
[1:02:25] you uh read these kind of things that
[1:02:28] the interpretation that people
[1:02:30] put to the scripture but in this my
[1:02:32] brother and sister
[1:02:33] her bewailing her virginity was her
[1:02:36] looking on into life and she was
[1:02:39] bewailing the fact that she would never
[1:02:41] have a husband
[1:02:43] she would never bear a child she would
[1:02:45] never be a mother
[1:02:47] she would never get to raise that child
[1:02:50] and she goes and she spends a time and
[1:02:52] she comes back
[1:02:54] and she offers herself back to her
[1:02:57] father to jephthah
[1:02:59] and jephthah breaks the law
[1:03:05] amen for there was a law in israel that
[1:03:09] absolutely forbade you to
[1:03:11] offer your child as a sacrifice
[1:03:16] there was a religious faction
[1:03:19] in israel at that time
[1:03:22] malek and those that were in that that
[1:03:24] would offer
[1:03:26] children probably not their own children
[1:03:29] it's okay to offer your children
[1:03:32] but not mine they would offer children
[1:03:35] as sacrifices believing they were
[1:03:37] pleasing god
[1:03:38] brother branham talks about that taking
[1:03:40] place in africa
[1:03:42] people have birthing a child and
[1:03:44] believing they were pleasing god take
[1:03:46] that child to the riverbank and feed it
[1:03:48] to the crocodiles
[1:03:50] to spirit spirits don't die
[1:03:53] but spirits take on religious
[1:03:55] connotations and we'll find
[1:03:56] people that through their lifestyle and
[1:03:59] the beliefs that they embrace that are
[1:04:01] contrary to the word of god
[1:04:03] would offer their children up as a
[1:04:06] sacrifice in the day that we live in
[1:04:08] are you with me amen offer their
[1:04:11] children up as
[1:04:11] a sacrifice even though they don't go
[1:04:14] physically take their life
[1:04:15] they've offered them up into a
[1:04:17] secularism they've offered them up into
[1:04:19] a watered-down religion
[1:04:21] mom and dad don't want to conform to the
[1:04:23] word of god so they just pass that right
[1:04:25] on to their children
[1:04:26] and wonder why their children end up
[1:04:29] being a product of laodicea
[1:04:32] amen so the spirit is still here
[1:04:34] hallelujah my brother and sister this is
[1:04:36] why we as
[1:04:38] parents amen as ministry of a church
[1:04:40] ought to stand strong on the word not
[1:04:42] compromise for nothing
[1:04:44] amen you know often times even our own
[1:04:46] children many years ago would
[1:04:48] made little statements like well
[1:04:50] so-and-so gets to do that
[1:04:51] well good we're not so and so amen and
[1:04:54] you're not so-and-so's children
[1:04:57] hallelujah so we want to stand strong on
[1:05:00] the word parents
[1:05:02] we're not here to offer our children up
[1:05:04] as some kind of sacrifice
[1:05:06] but i want to display this before we go
[1:05:08] on you know for many years i've spoke to
[1:05:11] you
[1:05:11] just a little phraseology you might say
[1:05:13] that the vow
[1:05:14] is greater than the law and i take that
[1:05:17] out of this scripture right here
[1:05:19] because god honoring jeff this vow
[1:05:23] even though jephthah broke the law
[1:05:28] are you with me you don't find god
[1:05:32] repudiating
[1:05:33] jephthah for breaking the law god
[1:05:36] actually honors him
[1:05:37] for keeping his vow
[1:05:40] my brother and sister we make a vow to
[1:05:42] the lord jesus christ we should do
[1:05:44] everything within our ability to keep
[1:05:47] that vow
[1:05:48] and i'm telling you that vow has great
[1:05:51] value
[1:05:52] amen that vow is is so incredible my
[1:05:55] brother and sister
[1:05:56] you might say well it might put me at
[1:05:59] odds with the with the old testament law
[1:06:01] keep the vow hallelujah
[1:06:05] amen so you look at this great conflict
[1:06:09] that's coming and
[1:06:10] and jephthah battles the ammonites and
[1:06:12] god comes down and
[1:06:14] he makes this vow to the lord and and
[1:06:17] that moves on
[1:06:18] now ephraim comes and says you know what
[1:06:20] we've got a grudge to settle with you
[1:06:23] uh because you didn't let us actually
[1:06:25] share
[1:06:26] in this defeating of the ammonites it's
[1:06:28] just gideonites all the community
[1:06:30] the newspaper the evening news is all
[1:06:32] talking about the how the ephermites
[1:06:34] went over there
[1:06:35] and beat the ammonites and if you had
[1:06:37] given us our part our name would also be
[1:06:40] in there
[1:06:41] and so there's a little grudge that they
[1:06:43] have a little struggle that they
[1:06:45] they have there and you know what
[1:06:47] happens is is when this comes and
[1:06:49] and this behavior now my brother and
[1:06:52] sister
[1:06:52] you know uh uh pardon me for putting it
[1:06:55] this way but
[1:06:56] you know people are like well you know
[1:06:58] what you know brother branham
[1:07:00] said we should no matter what you know
[1:07:01] be brothers and sisters and i would say
[1:07:03] amen to that amen
[1:07:05] but you know what i'm going to come burn
[1:07:07] your house down and you still got to be
[1:07:08] my brother
[1:07:12] that's not my brother and sister what a
[1:07:13] prophet of god was talking about
[1:07:15] that's not what the word of god's
[1:07:17] talking about that i can treat you
[1:07:19] terrible but you must treat me nice my
[1:07:22] brother and sister
[1:07:23] now it might be good for our character
[1:07:26] hallelujah but remember i don't remember
[1:07:30] who said this
[1:07:31] tozer or spurgeon you know said be
[1:07:33] careful how you let people treat you
[1:07:36] you are training them
[1:07:44] and we ought to come to the place that
[1:07:46] while we can love someone are you with
[1:07:48] me
[1:07:49] and still vehemently disagree with them
[1:07:52] and have the courage enough to say what
[1:07:54] you're doing
[1:07:55] is wrong you cannot come and disrespect
[1:07:58] brothers and sisters in christ
[1:08:01] and then turn the word around and say
[1:08:04] but you gotta love me anyhow
[1:08:07] you see the whole foundation they're
[1:08:08] building that on is
[1:08:10] incorrect now we should as sons and
[1:08:13] daughters of god
[1:08:14] be able to say lord forgive them lord
[1:08:17] help me
[1:08:18] amen i don't want to be influenced by
[1:08:20] this and end up with an attitude i don't
[1:08:22] want to do this
[1:08:23] but you see somewhere along the line
[1:08:25] someone's going to have the courage to
[1:08:26] tell these people
[1:08:28] you can't have it your way and god's way
[1:08:30] at the same time unless your way
[1:08:32] is god's way and so it's there in this
[1:08:36] battle of the ephraimites they
[1:08:38] come and you know they decide we're
[1:08:40] we're going to prove the point
[1:08:42] that you know uh uh uh the gideonites
[1:08:46] beat the ammonites so we're going to
[1:08:48] beat the giddy knights and then we can
[1:08:49] tell the whole world
[1:08:50] we're the best hallelujah
[1:08:54] in modern times that might be our church
[1:08:56] is having a bigger revival than your
[1:08:58] church
[1:08:59] you know if god was moving in your midst
[1:09:01] like he was moving in our midst this
[1:09:02] would happen or that would happen
[1:09:04] or you wouldn't have any teenagers or
[1:09:06] young people in your church struggling
[1:09:08] to serve god
[1:09:09] if you had what we had i'm sorry i'm not
[1:09:12] in that battle with you
[1:09:14] amen our battle is not down the road or
[1:09:16] over the mountain or across the desert
[1:09:18] our battle is right here
[1:09:20] and we'll stay right here in our land
[1:09:22] and we'll fight our battle and we'll
[1:09:24] fight for our children
[1:09:25] and for our families amen and for those
[1:09:27] in our midst
[1:09:28] that's what we'll do amen
[1:09:31] so they come to settle this this grudge
[1:09:34] and
[1:09:35] they go to war and when this battle is
[1:09:37] over saints i hope you catch the depth
[1:09:39] of this when this battle is over
[1:09:42] it become a mixed multitude it says that
[1:09:45] the gideonites
[1:09:46] they possess the approaches to the
[1:09:50] jordan river
[1:09:51] so you might say they possessed all the
[1:09:54] crossing point
[1:09:57] the bridge you might say across the
[1:09:58] river they controlled it
[1:10:01] but look at this mixed multitude my
[1:10:03] brother and sister i want you to
[1:10:04] understand this and think about three
[1:10:06] kinds of believers while you're thinking
[1:10:07] about this
[1:10:08] this mixed multitude would come to the
[1:10:11] crossing of the river
[1:10:12] and the gideonites did not just look at
[1:10:15] them and
[1:10:16] say because of your shoes you're an
[1:10:18] ephemite
[1:10:19] because of your trousers you're an
[1:10:21] ephemeric because of your shirt you're
[1:10:23] an ephemeric because of your
[1:10:24] haircut you're an ephraim i know my
[1:10:27] brother and sister this mixed multitude
[1:10:29] joined together
[1:10:30] there was no way think about this three
[1:10:32] kinds of believers
[1:10:33] no way to separate this they're looking
[1:10:37] at these people
[1:10:38] and they don't know what they're looking
[1:10:41] at
[1:10:42] this could be a gideon gideonite this
[1:10:43] could be an ephraim i and they ask him
[1:10:45] are you an ephemeric
[1:10:46] nay but god has a way
[1:10:50] and has had a way all through the
[1:10:51] generations when the prophet of god
[1:10:53] talked about the word being a separator
[1:10:56] in our day
[1:10:57] he didn't just pull that out of a hat
[1:10:59] somewhere and say i'm going to just make
[1:11:01] up a principle
[1:11:02] and apply it and throw it out here he
[1:11:04] could come right back here
[1:11:06] and take it right into the word of god
[1:11:08] and then
[1:11:09] brother branham talks about the word
[1:11:11] test amen you can look it up he talks
[1:11:13] about give a word test
[1:11:15] and so what it is that you go back right
[1:11:17] here and so what did they do
[1:11:19] when they would come are you nephremite
[1:11:24] nay
[1:11:26] what kind of believer are you are you a
[1:11:29] make believer
[1:11:30] nay are you an unbeliever
[1:11:34] nay we'll give you a word test
[1:11:39] we're going to give you a word test and
[1:11:41] we want you to pronounce this simple
[1:11:44] word
[1:11:44] which is not simple i'll be honest with
[1:11:47] you
[1:11:47] i got my daughter to look it up on the
[1:11:50] pronunciation thing and had to listen to
[1:11:52] it a few times see
[1:11:53] and i'm still not sure i got it quite
[1:11:55] right because you know
[1:11:56] how do you say that word i don't know
[1:11:58] how to say that word i need help how to
[1:12:00] say that word
[1:12:01] and you know they have all these
[1:12:02] wonderful gadgets we call technology
[1:12:05] the very thing that causes you to waste
[1:12:06] hundreds of hours of your time
[1:12:10] but you can waste that extra time that
[1:12:12] you save looking up the words
[1:12:14] pronunciation
[1:12:18] and he says i'm going to give you a word
[1:12:20] test
[1:12:22] all i need for you to do is say
[1:12:25] the word
[1:12:29] should be left
[1:12:32] now you know my brothers and sisters
[1:12:34] that speak french
[1:12:37] those of you that would speak spanish
[1:12:40] look i speak idaho english
[1:12:44] that's not even a proved form of english
[1:12:47] but those of you that speak french and
[1:12:49] you speak other language
[1:12:51] spanish etc you know that there's
[1:12:53] certain things you must do
[1:12:55] with your tongue and the way you
[1:12:56] pronounce things
[1:12:58] you know like in spanish you know you
[1:13:00] gotta roll
[1:13:02] do i get that close no my daughter said
[1:13:05] i flunked
[1:13:08] you got to do certain things and here
[1:13:11] they
[1:13:11] are now faced
[1:13:15] with a life and death test
[1:13:19] over the word
[1:13:23] why did they pick that why couldn't they
[1:13:26] used a word
[1:13:27] like um i don't know house
[1:13:30] i mean everyone can say house
[1:13:35] are you with me everyone can
[1:13:39] say i'm a christian
[1:13:43] why can't we just settle for the words
[1:13:46] i'm a christian
[1:13:48] or let's condense that out even a little
[1:13:50] easier
[1:13:51] everyone can say i'm a believer
[1:13:56] so why can't we just bring it down to
[1:13:58] the simple words of saying
[1:14:00] i'm a believer and if i say i'm a
[1:14:03] believer then nobody bothers me never
[1:14:05] nobody looks or nobody questions or and
[1:14:07] my behavior is no longer important
[1:14:09] what i actually believe is no longer
[1:14:11] important and what i do in my life
[1:14:14] is no longer important because i
[1:14:17] said
[1:14:21] but what do they do they come with a
[1:14:22] word by divine inspiration no doubt
[1:14:25] you say the word i was going to look up
[1:14:27] to see what should be left means
[1:14:29] and i forgot this morning but my brother
[1:14:32] and sister he knew there was one thing
[1:14:34] that by their cultural training and by
[1:14:37] their schools you might say
[1:14:38] and who they were as a people there was
[1:14:40] one thing they couldn't fake
[1:14:43] and that's the holy ghost i mean that
[1:14:45] was that word
[1:14:48] one thing that cannot be faked and
[1:14:50] they're there now each man saying no i'm
[1:14:53] not an ephemeric
[1:14:54] good pass the word test
[1:14:58] and they got up there and no matter how
[1:14:59] i can imagine i i'm not meaning to be
[1:15:02] funny
[1:15:02] but i can just imagine the guy there you
[1:15:04] know okay all you got to do is say
[1:15:06] should be left and the man's like
[1:15:08] sibuleth
[1:15:10] no that's not right give me another
[1:15:11] chance
[1:15:14] uh
[1:15:22] sibiulev no you didn't get it right
[1:15:26] have mercy guys one more chance
[1:15:36] i've got it
[1:15:39] cbf a little better but still not
[1:15:44] sorry you're an ephraimite
[1:15:53] lost his life over the word test
[1:15:57] are you with me saints you see this very
[1:16:01] simple thing right here
[1:16:03] of a word test and we come right down
[1:16:06] into the day that we're living in and
[1:16:07] the prophet of god says it'll come right
[1:16:09] down to you and i
[1:16:10] and to those that would come my brother
[1:16:12] and sister they would make a rapture
[1:16:14] those that would come into that position
[1:16:16] they will pass the word test amen
[1:16:19] brother branham says god the holy ghost
[1:16:21] could no more lead you away from the
[1:16:24] word
[1:16:26] amen he can't lead you away from the
[1:16:29] word
[1:16:30] i've got the holy ghost but i believe
[1:16:31] this over here
[1:16:33] no we have a word test i've got the holy
[1:16:36] ghost i
[1:16:37] believe the word and even if i
[1:16:41] find myself wrong i'm not going to stand
[1:16:45] on i believe what i believe because i
[1:16:47] was
[1:16:47] taught this as a child and i won't move
[1:16:49] from this no
[1:16:51] the holy ghost will cause the individual
[1:16:54] in the word
[1:16:54] test to look at that and say you know
[1:16:56] what i need another chance lord oh
[1:16:59] aren't you glad god's uh
[1:17:00] god give second chances amen and the
[1:17:03] lord had come along and we would have
[1:17:05] maybe
[1:17:05] said no it's in the name of the father
[1:17:08] in the name of the son the name of the
[1:17:09] holy spirit
[1:17:10] and the word would speak to us and say
[1:17:12] no that's not right
[1:17:14] and god would deal with us and one day
[1:17:16] we'll recognize hey
[1:17:17] this is who i am i'm the word and the
[1:17:20] word very clearly
[1:17:21] shows this lord forgive me that i
[1:17:23] believe that
[1:17:24] but i believe your word now but my
[1:17:27] brother and sister
[1:17:28] if you're an ephraimite amen you can't
[1:17:31] just
[1:17:32] become gideonite that's right
[1:17:37] once you are an ephemeric born in
[1:17:38] ephemeri you will always be an ephemeric
[1:17:41] the prophet of god said
[1:17:42] if you are in god now you were in him
[1:17:45] in the beginning you were always in him
[1:17:49] amen we didn't just come down here and
[1:17:52] receive the lord jesus christ
[1:17:54] and become converted undocumented you
[1:17:57] might say
[1:17:58] in the plan of god my brother and sister
[1:18:00] god
[1:18:01] knew that the word would come to us he
[1:18:03] knew that we would embrace that word
[1:18:06] that it would find a resting place in
[1:18:07] the heart and the soul of sons and
[1:18:09] daughters of god
[1:18:11] hallelujah hallelujah excuse me if i get
[1:18:15] a little excited
[1:18:17] i'm telling you saints i wish i could
[1:18:19] have the
[1:18:21] i don't know why maybe it was just for
[1:18:23] this reason but i woke up about
[1:18:25] 20 this morning amen and just laying
[1:18:28] there in bed
[1:18:29] and there was such an inspiration come
[1:18:31] over me i should have got out of bed and
[1:18:32] started writing
[1:18:34] but i was so tired and i thought lord i
[1:18:36] pray actually prayed this prayer lord
[1:18:37] let me just remember this anointing in
[1:18:39] the morning
[1:18:41] amen i should have got out of bed
[1:18:43] there's some essence i believe that has
[1:18:45] escaped me
[1:18:46] but my brother and sister when you
[1:18:48] realize that you look in this mixed
[1:18:50] multitude that we are living in right
[1:18:52] now
[1:18:53] amen brother brown talking about israel
[1:18:55] was a mixed multitude coming out
[1:18:57] amen look at this how they look similar
[1:19:02] i'm telling you in many cases the
[1:19:04] unbeliever
[1:19:05] looks like the make-believer look like
[1:19:07] the believer
[1:19:09] you can't pick them apart by their looks
[1:19:13] amen they walk similar
[1:19:17] they talk similar but there must be some
[1:19:21] way
[1:19:22] must be some way to separate them
[1:19:26] right we're coming down here right you
[1:19:28] don't the word says you don't go out in
[1:19:30] the wheat field
[1:19:31] and start pulling up the tares lest you
[1:19:34] would pull up
[1:19:35] the true wheat the true seed
[1:19:38] amen so it's got to come to the harvest
[1:19:41] and there in the harvest the wheat is
[1:19:44] gathered in the garner
[1:19:45] and the tares are bound so coming into
[1:19:49] maturity and i
[1:19:50] know this is a farmer and those of you
[1:19:51] would know too uh
[1:19:53] you come when it gets to the maturing
[1:19:56] time
[1:19:56] it's not so hard to tell the difference
[1:19:59] between the wheat
[1:20:00] and the rye and the wild oat and the
[1:20:02] thistle and the whatever
[1:20:05] amen but boy early on the year when the
[1:20:07] field's just the green and lost you go
[1:20:10] out there and start trying to decide
[1:20:11] you know what i think you're a terror
[1:20:14] you go tear a real believer out
[1:20:16] disrupt their life ruin it no that's not
[1:20:19] how it works
[1:20:20] we gotta do it but you see we're coming
[1:20:22] we're not we're not
[1:20:23] in the we're not in the uh uh um uh what
[1:20:27] we would call the vegetative state
[1:20:28] as believers we're coming into maturity
[1:20:32] amen so it's no longer that we sit back
[1:20:35] and people
[1:20:36] uh you know they think you're mean cruel
[1:20:38] harsh
[1:20:39] judgmental but my brother and sister
[1:20:44] when they were walking through their
[1:20:45] roguing the field of the wild oats and
[1:20:47] the rye
[1:20:48] they didn't apologize to it
[1:20:52] you're not wheat sorry you go in a
[1:20:55] different pile you go in a different
[1:20:56] bundle
[1:20:58] but we've come into such a touchy feely
[1:21:01] world
[1:21:05] we don't want to offend anyone so what
[1:21:08] we're going to do is we're going to
[1:21:09] preach it a little bit
[1:21:10] softer and hope that somehow you grasp
[1:21:12] this
[1:21:14] you know what you're doing you're
[1:21:16] starving the bride
[1:21:18] and making the tear feel comfortable
[1:21:25] that's all it comes down to i'm here to
[1:21:28] feed the bride
[1:21:29] i'm sorry i don't i pray with all of my
[1:21:32] heart there's no tear in the building
[1:21:33] today
[1:21:34] but i'm here to feed the bride and if it
[1:21:37] makes the tear uncomfortable
[1:21:39] then we just have to live with that
[1:21:42] because if we get all touchy feeling
[1:21:45] you know i tell you i do my best to hide
[1:21:48] this but
[1:21:48] i'm actually a very emotional person
[1:21:52] i'm the kind of guy that sees something
[1:21:54] sad and i
[1:21:55] i start crying i i did it yesterday
[1:21:58] just a little something in it and i was
[1:22:00] like oh my goodness
[1:22:04] and this tears come in my eyes that's
[1:22:06] kind of i am
[1:22:10] and something i have to guard against
[1:22:11] i'm also raised up as a child one of
[1:22:13] those
[1:22:14] huggers i don't think about it
[1:22:18] i'm just one of those it's like oh god
[1:22:20] bless you
[1:22:21] oh wait that's a sister
[1:22:26] nothing carnal it's just my nature
[1:22:29] amen i don't want to embarrass sister
[1:22:31] gabriella but i i'm
[1:22:32] i'm telling her i i she's like a
[1:22:34] granddaughter to me
[1:22:36] you know sister sarah how old was she
[1:22:38] when you moved here
[1:22:43] just a baby
[1:22:47] first family outside of my own children
[1:22:51] and become a habit to wrap my arms
[1:22:53] around this little girl and
[1:22:55] let her know i love her but she's
[1:22:58] turning into a young woman
[1:23:00] so please forgive me if you ever see me
[1:23:02] in the foyer give her a hug i
[1:23:04] i'm breaking that habit because she's
[1:23:06] coming into a young woman
[1:23:08] right she's no longer a baby but you see
[1:23:11] i love her and by my very nature
[1:23:14] do you understand what i'm saying by my
[1:23:15] very nature i want to just give her a
[1:23:17] little hug
[1:23:17] just a little let her know i love you
[1:23:20] girl
[1:23:22] people misunderstand i don't want you to
[1:23:24] misunderstand sister jerry's my
[1:23:26] encouragement she's like paul she's a
[1:23:27] woman now
[1:23:30] she's right there you have to you have
[1:23:32] to let go
[1:23:35] let's see our old nature sometimes hard
[1:23:37] to break
[1:23:39] and so you see it we come into that
[1:23:41] realm where where because of our nature
[1:23:44] i want you all to be happy i want you
[1:23:46] all to like me so if i water the word
[1:23:48] down
[1:23:48] the prophet of god give an indictment to
[1:23:51] a weak
[1:23:52] pulpit for sending souls to hell
[1:23:56] i don't want to be guilty of that amen i
[1:23:58] want to stand firm but i want you to
[1:24:00] know i love you each one of you i just
[1:24:01] hugged you
[1:24:03] but you see we got to stand firm on the
[1:24:05] word of god because if we don't
[1:24:07] every bit of our effort is wasted if we
[1:24:10] end up like that rich man
[1:24:12] who passes and wakes up in hell
[1:24:16] oh it won't do us a bit of good amen so
[1:24:19] there has to be a way to tell them apart
[1:24:21] now brother branham says here and the
[1:24:22] spoken word is the original seed
[1:24:24] amen he says here give it the word test
[1:24:28] that's the way to tell whether it's
[1:24:29] right or wrong that's just just give it
[1:24:32] the word test see what it says about the
[1:24:34] word
[1:24:35] any spirit see what it says about the
[1:24:39] word any spirit
[1:24:41] if it denies the word it's not of god
[1:24:44] see no matter what it is if it denies
[1:24:47] the word it's not
[1:24:48] of god look give it the word test and
[1:24:51] see what happens
[1:24:53] now look saints this is not amen
[1:24:56] oh hallelujah
[1:24:59] word test brother branham doesn't say
[1:25:05] give them a word test and
[1:25:08] see how kind they are no
[1:25:12] give them a word test to see
[1:25:15] if they still love you
[1:25:19] give them a word test to see if they'll
[1:25:22] stand with the word
[1:25:24] you see that's all that really matters
[1:25:28] you know i'll tell you right now just
[1:25:29] speaking from my heart to you this
[1:25:31] morning
[1:25:31] when the preacher gets more worried
[1:25:33] about what you think about
[1:25:35] him than he thinks about the preaching
[1:25:37] of the word
[1:25:38] then you need to run or
[1:25:42] have another pastor or whatever
[1:25:45] because you see that's nothing but
[1:25:49] that's nothing but a spirit you see it's
[1:25:51] not an association test
[1:25:55] he didn't say anything about now look
[1:25:57] who they hang out with
[1:25:59] if they hang out with the right people
[1:26:03] then overlook all of this
[1:26:08] i know brother so-and-so oh my
[1:26:11] now look saints this is uh something a
[1:26:14] little tender to some people okay
[1:26:16] i don't mean it to be crass or harder or
[1:26:18] i'm not trying to be edgy
[1:26:20] but look at this my brother and sister
[1:26:22] we have people
[1:26:23] who are like oh my
[1:26:26] they were with brother branham
[1:26:31] i'm telling you you don't dare let go of
[1:26:33] your wallet
[1:26:34] you don't dare take a word that they
[1:26:36] said you'll find there's nothing to
[1:26:38] verify
[1:26:39] any of the stories that they pour out to
[1:26:41] you and that's rightly so many things
[1:26:43] take place in personal
[1:26:45] but i'll let you know right now my
[1:26:46] brother and sister if you want to know
[1:26:48] where brother paul stands
[1:26:50] you can find it right here it's not
[1:26:53] going to be because i know brother
[1:26:54] george smith sorry brother george for
[1:26:56] including you in our service this
[1:26:57] morning
[1:26:58] although he did text this morning and
[1:27:00] say he was praying for us and that might
[1:27:01] be the reason right there
[1:27:03] my brother sister it is in a position
[1:27:05] because i know brother george smith and
[1:27:07] can consider him a bosom friend it makes
[1:27:10] no difference brother george is either
[1:27:12] on the word or he's off the word
[1:27:14] and from brother george's point looking
[1:27:16] back our direction we're either
[1:27:18] on the word or we're off the word it's
[1:27:20] not an association
[1:27:22] amen it's not that we can name drop
[1:27:25] there's no
[1:27:25] test about who can name trump well you
[1:27:28] know we are standing here and this
[1:27:29] brother was with the prophet
[1:27:31] that's good did he have the holy ghost
[1:27:33] that's what i want to know did he have a
[1:27:35] revelation
[1:27:36] of the word that's the only thing that
[1:27:38] matters to me
[1:27:39] there was a lot of people walk with the
[1:27:41] prophet you look at this it's a
[1:27:42] wonderful story tommy osborne
[1:27:44] my brother and sister he sits there in
[1:27:46] the coliseum in portland oregon
[1:27:48] and he looks at brother branham and
[1:27:50] tommy osborne's own words now this man
[1:27:52] did not go on to follow the message
[1:27:55] but i'm telling you the power of god in
[1:27:57] the presence of god
[1:27:58] and tommy osborne's ministry was failing
[1:28:01] he would go into cities and it used to
[1:28:03] have nice crowds and it was dropping and
[1:28:05] god wasn't moving
[1:28:06] he sits there in the coliseum in
[1:28:07] portland oregon he looks down there and
[1:28:09] tommy osborne's testimony is
[1:28:11] uh for the first time in my life i saw
[1:28:14] god
[1:28:15] in the flesh and something spoke to him
[1:28:19] and said
[1:28:19] if you will do that for him i will do
[1:28:22] that for him
[1:28:24] then i will do that for you but my
[1:28:26] brother
[1:28:27] look at this come on people get all
[1:28:30] bent out of shape about these things
[1:28:32] tommy osborne's ministry
[1:28:34] went on to circle the world people were
[1:28:37] healed
[1:28:38] people were delivered all kinds of the
[1:28:41] supernatural
[1:28:42] but tommy osborne did not embrace even
[1:28:45] some of the basic scriptural things
[1:28:47] that were right here not in the message
[1:28:50] in the bible
[1:28:52] but you see he tapped into that he
[1:28:55] caught a revelation
[1:28:56] that we can approach this in this
[1:28:58] fashion and god
[1:29:00] will honor his word
[1:29:03] now look i want you to line up with the
[1:29:05] word of god i'm not i'm not trying to
[1:29:06] give you an
[1:29:07] out but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:29:09] sister if you
[1:29:10] will challenge god in the sense that if
[1:29:13] he said it i believe it
[1:29:15] and you believe it with all of your
[1:29:16] heart you wait and see if god will not
[1:29:19] honor your word
[1:29:20] and your claim to that and will bless
[1:29:22] you and so
[1:29:24] much sore my mother brother and sister
[1:29:26] if you will submit yourself
[1:29:28] to god just surrender you know what our
[1:29:30] biggest problem is we want it
[1:29:33] our way
[1:29:40] i want it hard way this is how it should
[1:29:44] be
[1:29:45] no i'm sorry my brother and sister being
[1:29:47] associate with god
[1:29:49] won't do it god and i are friends
[1:29:53] that's wonderful i'm glad you and god
[1:29:56] are friends
[1:29:57] when you're going to let him in
[1:30:00] hallelujah
[1:30:01] when are you going to let him in you can
[1:30:03] talk about god did this and god did that
[1:30:05] and god said this and god said that why
[1:30:07] don't you let him in
[1:30:09] hallelujah and no longer become a debate
[1:30:12] it'll become a life
[1:30:14] hallelujah now look at this
[1:30:19] to them it was a pronunciation test
[1:30:22] right if you had been an ephemeric and
[1:30:24] you would have been able to pronounce
[1:30:26] that
[1:30:27] you would have just blew your way right
[1:30:29] through it but my brother and sister
[1:30:31] you'll find
[1:30:32] the word of god says from the
[1:30:38] abundance of the heart
[1:30:42] the mouth speaketh
[1:30:46] that's exactly right you know we got a
[1:30:48] problem in the world today
[1:30:50] i'm just going to speak blunt to you
[1:30:51] this morning i wasn't going to but i
[1:30:52] will
[1:30:54] we got way too many ministers they're
[1:30:55] falling like flies around the message
[1:30:58] why because they could pronounce it
[1:31:04] but it wasn't revelation they said all
[1:31:08] the right things
[1:31:09] that's right well you know what amen
[1:31:12] god sent a prophet i believe that with
[1:31:14] all of my heart
[1:31:15] amen is he my savior no i'm sorry i had
[1:31:18] to cut it off right there
[1:31:19] he was the one who pointed me to christ
[1:31:22] he's the one that let me see it
[1:31:24] in such a fashion that it became so real
[1:31:27] to me
[1:31:27] that nothing's going to change my mind
[1:31:31] but he's not my savior never was never
[1:31:34] will be
[1:31:35] but i believe that god ordained my life
[1:31:38] to cross the path
[1:31:40] of this revealed word and when it
[1:31:42] crossed that path something
[1:31:44] changed amen so here it's not about me
[1:31:47] pronouncing it right well god sent a
[1:31:49] prophet
[1:31:50] god sent a prophet god sent a prophet
[1:31:54] that's good we can pronounce it oh but
[1:31:57] my brother and sister where's the word
[1:31:59] test amen that word test comes down and
[1:32:02] produces the word
[1:32:04] right one of the very first things you
[1:32:05] think about this very first things go
[1:32:07] back to genesis we won't go off into
[1:32:09] this
[1:32:09] but one of the very first things that
[1:32:11] god places in his word was
[1:32:13] the seed amen
[1:32:17] oh my brother and sister it comes down
[1:32:19] the importance of this seed
[1:32:20] we can talk about it we can talk about
[1:32:23] it right now i'm growing this beautiful
[1:32:25] corn
[1:32:26] crop wait
[1:32:29] it's january corn they'll grow in
[1:32:31] january in idaho
[1:32:33] i can talk about how great my crop is
[1:32:35] going to be the evidence of what i
[1:32:37] believe is whether i slap the seed
[1:32:40] in the ground or whether i just go out
[1:32:42] there and and just
[1:32:43] haphazardly do it or whether i become
[1:32:46] very meticulous
[1:32:49] hallelujah brother jason will know
[1:32:51] sometimes you can't get any work done
[1:32:53] for crawling behind the planter
[1:32:57] i always laugh brother brown says now a
[1:32:59] farmer he'd plant a seed
[1:33:01] he doesn't go out there every day and
[1:33:03] dig it up to see how it's doing
[1:33:05] i know what brother branham was saying
[1:33:07] so don't don't think then i'm
[1:33:08] counterdicting this
[1:33:10] but brother branham wasn't a farmer
[1:33:14] there's hardly a day goes by in the
[1:33:16] spring after we have planted
[1:33:18] that we're not out there digging up a
[1:33:20] seed
[1:33:22] is there enough moisture to get the seed
[1:33:24] out of the ground
[1:33:25] you see you have to decide that you
[1:33:27] can't decide it after the fact
[1:33:29] right remember the parable of the sower
[1:33:31] when that seed gets started if there's
[1:33:33] not sufficient moisture
[1:33:34] the life springs forth but when the
[1:33:36] conditions are not right the seed dies
[1:33:38] you can't resurrect that seed in the
[1:33:40] natural
[1:33:42] we're out there digging is there
[1:33:44] sufficient moisture in the ground
[1:33:46] there is the next day oh look at that
[1:33:50] it's putting out a tail i know you guys
[1:33:54] i don't know where your enthusiasm's
[1:33:55] about
[1:33:59] no these are wonderful things these are
[1:34:02] wonderful things
[1:34:03] you go out there the next day and it's
[1:34:05] not just putting out a tail the tail
[1:34:07] has put off now and i can't pronounce
[1:34:09] all those fancy little words they have
[1:34:10] for that
[1:34:11] but that little tail has now put off
[1:34:13] this little micro hair root
[1:34:16] oh hallelujah it isn't just enough god
[1:34:19] sent a prophet hallelujah
[1:34:21] something's taking root hey man
[1:34:24] something's sinking down
[1:34:26] roots amen and you can go out in the
[1:34:28] field i remember one time i was planting
[1:34:31] corn for a guy called him up and i said
[1:34:33] um you know you got to do something
[1:34:34] different
[1:34:35] i said uh um my plant will barely go in
[1:34:38] your ground
[1:34:39] and he said i got time to do something
[1:34:41] different planted anyhow
[1:34:42] so we went out there and he paid us to
[1:34:44] plant his corn but my brother and sister
[1:34:46] we always take a shovel along i couldn't
[1:34:48] get that shovel
[1:34:49] in the ground imagine what his corn crop
[1:34:52] turned out like
[1:34:55] but i tell you what when that seed lands
[1:34:58] in the good soil oh hallelujah what is
[1:35:02] that
[1:35:03] that's that channel that the holy ghost
[1:35:05] brings it right down my brother and
[1:35:07] sister the prophet of god talks about
[1:35:09] that channel
[1:35:10] and we want that channel that goes right
[1:35:12] down to the soul
[1:35:13] so when that revelated word of god comes
[1:35:15] right down and he hits that channel
[1:35:17] it comes right down here and hits in our
[1:35:19] soul and
[1:35:20] something takes place amen we don't need
[1:35:23] someone to drive it home
[1:35:24] to us it's putting out its roots it's
[1:35:27] doing everything
[1:35:28] it's popping up above the soil unfurling
[1:35:30] a leaf
[1:35:31] it's saying right there hallelujah i
[1:35:34] have produced a seed
[1:35:35] but you say where's the seed it's in me
[1:35:39] hallelujah i don't got to go somewhere
[1:35:42] and find a seed i don't need a book
[1:35:44] how to produce that seed that seed is in
[1:35:47] me
[1:35:48] oh hallelujah that life of christ is in
[1:35:51] me
[1:35:52] oh my you see it's not about our
[1:35:55] pronunciation otherwise i'd fail
[1:35:58] amen but what the word that we're
[1:36:01] anointed to speak
[1:36:02] when the fiery trials come will you
[1:36:06] pass the word test whole another kind of
[1:36:09] word test
[1:36:10] will you pass the word test hi my name
[1:36:12] is shadrach
[1:36:13] they're fixing to throw me in the
[1:36:15] furnace god has betrayed me
[1:36:18] oh no king let me tell you
[1:36:22] if god lets me burn up regardless
[1:36:26] i will serve him
[1:36:29] if god chooses for me to be eaten by
[1:36:32] a lion in the den then my god is in
[1:36:36] control
[1:36:38] hallelujah we need to learn to pass a
[1:36:40] word test
[1:36:41] amen we don't want to speak the devil's
[1:36:44] language
[1:36:44] i'm not a very good christian i'm weak
[1:36:47] i'm this i'm that
[1:36:49] amen let the word they hit the channel
[1:36:51] of your soul
[1:36:52] come right down in there and let that
[1:36:55] take betting ground in your soul
[1:36:57] that when the time comes and troubles
[1:37:00] are upon you
[1:37:01] oh brother paul how could we in the time
[1:37:04] of need
[1:37:04] speak to that mountain and it be moved
[1:37:07] i'll tell you how
[1:37:08] because the seed i believe that seed
[1:37:12] is in there already and god anoint that
[1:37:16] and you say this is a time nothing else
[1:37:18] will work
[1:37:19] nothing else will work i can't get a
[1:37:22] friend i can't get to government
[1:37:24] nothing's going to change nothing but in
[1:37:27] the name
[1:37:28] of jesus christ who is my husband
[1:37:31] who is my bridegroom who is my creator
[1:37:35] he is my savior in his name
[1:37:39] i believe
[1:37:40] [Applause]
[1:37:42] and then we have life-changing events
[1:37:45] oh hallelujah because you see if you
[1:37:48] want to put it down in simple words
[1:37:50] in those fiery trials you'll either
[1:37:52] speak victory or you'll speak defeat
[1:37:55] it'll come in a lot of different words
[1:37:57] it'll come in a lot of different
[1:37:58] explanations
[1:37:59] but you'll be speaking one or the other
[1:38:01] victory
[1:38:02] or defeat i'll tell you i get excited
[1:38:06] about this not to relive things in the
[1:38:08] past
[1:38:09] but i remember a sister in south africa
[1:38:11] amen the devil come in like a
[1:38:13] tornado ripped her family apart amen we
[1:38:16] were preaching there
[1:38:17] and something stirred my heart and you
[1:38:20] you shaken your shoes afterwards because
[1:38:22] you're like lord what did i say to that
[1:38:24] sister
[1:38:25] but i stood there on the steps of their
[1:38:26] camp meeting building
[1:38:28] and i told that sister right to her face
[1:38:30] in front of witnesses
[1:38:31] god will give you your children amen
[1:38:34] amen
[1:38:34] oh years went by i would i think i
[1:38:38] shared that with the church she sent me
[1:38:40] uh emails and whatnot and pictures
[1:38:43] she wanted me to know brother paul my
[1:38:46] last one
[1:38:47] gave his heart to the lord and not only
[1:38:50] that he brought his wife
[1:38:51] actually was his girlfriend he was
[1:38:53] living with her and brought her with him
[1:38:55] and god saved both of them and they got
[1:38:58] married in the back room of the church
[1:38:59] and went on to serve god the sister my
[1:39:02] brother and sister
[1:39:03] i remember looking that sister in the
[1:39:05] face that day
[1:39:06] and i'm telling you a sheer faith in god
[1:39:10] that calls her to say i believe that
[1:39:12] brother paul
[1:39:13] because it was in a dire strait a son
[1:39:15] that thought he was elvis
[1:39:17] he had a good voice too hallelujah
[1:39:24] anyone to teach it to all the kids
[1:39:29] and the ministry of the church had to
[1:39:30] take a hard stance
[1:39:32] and tell him you won't like walk back in
[1:39:35] the doors of our church
[1:39:36] you're not welcome here

[1:40:09] it on your
[1:40:10] family amen no my brother and sister
[1:40:13] let's not beat around the bush
[1:40:14] that's right come on
[1:40:17] what we've got to do is have what it
[1:40:19] takes for word test
[1:40:21] amen now we're not talking
[1:40:25] we're not talking a 70s word test
[1:40:29] though that you earned around the
[1:40:30] message in the 70s you might not
[1:40:32] recognize this but in
[1:40:33] in the 70s the message
[1:40:36] was a very very hard line
[1:40:40] very hard line as a child growing up in
[1:40:43] the church
[1:40:44] in them days it was nothing
[1:40:47] for a deacon to walk up the aisle of the
[1:40:49] church
[1:40:51] sorry sister naughty and just slap you
[1:40:54] on the back of the head
[1:40:58] straighten up or i'll deal with you
[1:41:01] after church
[1:41:05] i really want to serve god i just love
[1:41:08] going to church
[1:41:11] now no 70s i'll tell you i'll give you a
[1:41:14] word test
[1:41:15] if you don't believe it like i do
[1:41:18] you're of the devil no no
[1:41:22] i'm sorry that word test got scuttled
[1:41:25] that was a man's idea
[1:41:26] i'll tell you the word test we're
[1:41:28] standing on today my brother and sister
[1:41:30] and it's not one where i have to come to
[1:41:31] your house brother david brother chris
[1:41:33] come to your house
[1:41:34] force it this is the word test to the
[1:41:36] true bride because the holy ghost has
[1:41:38] hit the channel
[1:41:39] and come right down in you and you pick
[1:41:41] up your bible because you
[1:41:42] want to you read your bible because
[1:41:45] something inside
[1:41:46] of you desires that and the bible
[1:41:48] becomes a lie
[1:41:49] and it tells you to quit your smoking
[1:41:51] and quit your drinking and quit your
[1:41:52] dancing and quit your doing
[1:41:54] and not quit defiling your body and you
[1:41:56] look at that and say it's the word
[1:41:58] it's the word and while i like that
[1:42:00] stuff i'm gonna obey the word
[1:42:04] and you say well i'm gonna do it what
[1:42:06] you don't realize is you're taking the
[1:42:08] word test your own self
[1:42:10] amen it's a self test hallelujah
[1:42:14] i'm sure glad they didn't do this online
[1:42:16] homeschool stuff when i was a kid
[1:42:18] because i'd got an a in everything
[1:42:23] yeah see the believer
[1:42:26] you know everyone's a believer today
[1:42:29] come on
[1:42:29] everybody's a believer today amen
[1:42:35] but the real true believer when the word
[1:42:37] comes
[1:42:38] he opens up that channel the prophet of
[1:42:40] god talks about us going down there and
[1:42:42] cleaning out that channel
[1:42:43] and a real believer cleans that channel
[1:42:45] out when the holy ghost falls it goes
[1:42:47] right down into that channel
[1:42:49] and comes right into the soul amen hey
[1:42:51] amen i did put this
[1:42:53] note in here i guess i kind of forgot i
[1:42:54] did luke 6 45 amen
[1:42:57] a good man out of the good treasure of
[1:42:59] his heart
[1:43:00] bringeth forth that which is good amen
[1:43:03] you can't just fake that my brother and
[1:43:05] sister you can't fake it when you're not
[1:43:07] happy but you still do the right thing
[1:43:09] you can't fake it in the times of great
[1:43:11] distress when you still say lord thy
[1:43:14] will be done you can't fake that
[1:43:16] you can't fake it when there's no one
[1:43:18] else there to to determine your
[1:43:19] direction
[1:43:20] but you something inside of you says
[1:43:22] that's what i want
[1:43:24] hallelujah and an evil man of the evil
[1:43:27] treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[1:43:28] that which is evil
[1:43:29] for of the abundance of the heart his
[1:43:31] mouth speaketh
[1:43:33] oh god let me pass a word test amen let
[1:43:36] me say amen to the word
[1:43:38] no matter how hard it hurts oh you know
[1:43:41] that song listen to my heart
[1:43:43] i pray maybe this will give a little
[1:43:45] deeper significance to that
[1:43:47] because sometimes my brother and sister
[1:43:49] the old mouth and the old heart seem to
[1:43:50] be in a conflict with
[1:43:52] each other sometimes you know sister
[1:43:54] jerry she's just ruthless
[1:43:55] but sometimes i get just feeling a
[1:43:57] little down underneath a little cloud
[1:44:00] and i'll start like remembering she's
[1:44:02] like oh yeah
[1:44:04] negative
[1:44:08] no don't look down at her i needed that
[1:44:12] i needed somebody to remind the preacher
[1:44:14] to live what he preached
[1:44:17] oh did i did my inner voice come out
[1:44:25] wow sorry about that delete that from
[1:44:27] the record please
[1:44:33] look when the right words come
[1:44:36] i want you to think about this not all
[1:44:39] preaching my brother and sister makes a
[1:44:40] difference in your life
[1:44:46] not all preaching makes a difference in
[1:44:48] your life
[1:44:51] only the preaching that you led in
[1:44:55] makes a difference in your life that's
[1:44:57] right
[1:45:01] brother david will be our favorite
[1:45:02] villain this morning
[1:45:05] brother david preaches something real
[1:45:07] straight and it skins both of your
[1:45:09] knuckles
[1:45:10] and you're like
[1:45:14] you might as well act like you're going
[1:45:15] to the restroom and go home
[1:45:19] because you see you've shut yourself up
[1:45:21] and nothing else that's said
[1:45:23] is going to make i didn't get much out
[1:45:25] of that service
[1:45:27] no that's right i heard you close the
[1:45:28] door i heard the key and i heard the
[1:45:30] chain on the latch
[1:45:32] i don't know why i didn't get much out
[1:45:34] of this service i guess brother david's
[1:45:35] preaching just don't do it for me
[1:45:38] thank you for being my villain brother
[1:45:42] david but you know the word that makes a
[1:45:45] difference in our life
[1:45:47] prophet of god told us it ain't the man
[1:45:48] that brings it
[1:45:50] it's the atmosphere so the preaching
[1:45:53] that makes a difference in our life is
[1:45:55] the one where we come in and we throw
[1:45:57] open the doors
[1:45:58] oh lord i need to hear from you today
[1:46:02] lord let your word come right down to
[1:46:04] the channel of my
[1:46:06] soul today and you walk out of church
[1:46:08] you know brother david said this and
[1:46:10] this and brother david did say i never
[1:46:11] said that
[1:46:12] but you see what they heard was not
[1:46:14] brother david's voice
[1:46:15] it was a voice speaking to their life
[1:46:17] and my brother and sister let me just
[1:46:19] tie this to you this way
[1:46:21] that was what happened my brother and
[1:46:22] sister hattie wright is sitting there
[1:46:24] listening to a prophet of
[1:46:26] god talk about the moving of god the
[1:46:28] moving of the holy spirit
[1:46:30] and she's there and she says that ain't
[1:46:33] nothing but the truth
[1:46:35] i want to know was she talking to
[1:46:37] william branham
[1:46:38] or was she talking to god if she was
[1:46:40] talking to william branham then william
[1:46:42] branham had to give her
[1:46:44] what she asked
[1:46:47] are you with me if it was william
[1:46:50] branham
[1:46:51] then william branham would have been
[1:46:53] responsible to provide to her
[1:46:56] what it was that she spoke but she was
[1:46:59] talking to god
[1:47:02] and she said that ain't nothing but the
[1:47:06] truth
[1:47:08] well i have my favorite preacher
[1:47:14] well hallelujah i have my favorite
[1:47:16] dessert too
[1:47:20] i like brother so-and-so because he
[1:47:22] presents the message
[1:47:24] in such a sweet dignified fashion
[1:47:29] and i really appreciate his ministry
[1:47:31] because every time i hear him
[1:47:33] preach i walk out feeling so
[1:47:37] good about myself
[1:47:40] spurgeon says if a minister preaches and
[1:47:43] doesn't offend someone he has
[1:47:45] failed at his job now i don't know who
[1:47:50] that spurgeon guy was i think he was
[1:47:52] just some random guy
[1:47:53] off the street but i embrace what he has
[1:47:56] to say
[1:47:58] hallelujah what time is it somebody no
[1:48:00] don't answer
[1:48:05] look at this when the right words come
[1:48:09] what are those right word saints those
[1:48:12] are the ones
[1:48:13] you accept
[1:48:16] i don't care how good the preaching is
[1:48:20] i don't care how much you like the
[1:48:22] preacher
[1:48:23] you've got to accept
[1:48:26] it
[1:48:30] doesn't say debate it doesn't say
[1:48:32] research it
[1:48:33] what you will accept amen
[1:48:37] let's go back to hattie wright
[1:48:39] interesting
[1:48:40] how do you write this hillbilly
[1:48:44] no education made so little money
[1:48:49] that people couldn't understand how they
[1:48:50] even existed had a crippled sister
[1:48:53] two rebellious sons my goodness
[1:48:57] here just second i mean my kids aren't
[1:49:00] serving the lord
[1:49:02] i don't know if god hears my prayers
[1:49:06] lousy lousy
[1:49:12] woo
[1:49:14] if god loved me come on saints i've
[1:49:17] heard this out of believer's lips
[1:49:20] if god loved me he'd give me a better
[1:49:22] job brother you don't understand i felt
[1:49:23] like saying this to that brother that
[1:49:25] time
[1:49:25] brother you don't understand what little
[1:49:27] money you have right now
[1:49:29] you do such a horrible job with it i
[1:49:30] can't imagine if you had a lot of money
[1:49:38] let me
[1:49:42] one of those watered-down preachers at
[1:49:43] that moment in my life and i was like
[1:49:45] yeah okay brother i'm sorry he probably
[1:49:48] wouldn't call me friend right now if his
[1:49:50] this paul that was there i'd tell him
[1:49:52] brother
[1:49:53] you need to go listen to dave ramsey you
[1:49:55] need to read your bible it actually has
[1:49:57] the best budgeting program
[1:49:59] hey man you got so many holes in your
[1:50:01] pockets
[1:50:02] you know what i just happen to know
[1:50:04] because i is dropped on the trustee
[1:50:06] talking to your pastor that you ain't
[1:50:07] paid ties in a year and you're trying to
[1:50:09] borrow money from the church because
[1:50:11] life is so hard
[1:50:12] when you catch the real principle of the
[1:50:15] word of god
[1:50:16] you will go back and say i don't care if
[1:50:18] we have to eat soda crackers and branch
[1:50:21] waters
[1:50:21] i'm going to say amen to this word and
[1:50:23] i'm gonna
[1:50:25] and then oh hallelujah i hope you'll
[1:50:27] forgive me for my craziness
[1:50:28] but then you'll feel something rustling
[1:50:30] in your pocket and realize the holy
[1:50:32] ghost is in there so
[1:50:33] and will hold up hallelujah
[1:50:37] and you go out there and that old car
[1:50:39] that would barely start yesterday
[1:50:40] fires right off and drives like a top
[1:50:43] amen but no no
[1:50:45] i don't like it the preacher when he
[1:50:46] preaches about ties did i just mention
[1:50:48] tyson
[1:50:51] it's all about the money it's all about
[1:50:54] the money
[1:50:55] i want your money like i told a brother
[1:50:58] years ago that was ripping into me about
[1:51:00] that
[1:51:01] if i wanted more money saints i'd quit
[1:51:03] being your pastor and i'd farm more
[1:51:05] ground
[1:51:09] because corn don't back talk
[1:51:11] [Laughter]
[1:51:18] come on i'm glad you guys got a sense of
[1:51:20] humor this morning
[1:51:22] you see my brother and sister it's the
[1:51:23] anointing of the holy ghost got to find
[1:51:25] its betting place it's got to find the
[1:51:27] correct place
[1:51:28] and we have to open up and receive that
[1:51:31] word
[1:51:31] and when we open up and receive that
[1:51:33] word you say well brother paul i come to
[1:51:35] church in the right attitude i come
[1:51:37] and it didn't really seem to make a
[1:51:38] difference will you just wait
[1:51:41] you just wait god is faithful
[1:51:44] he says i haven't forgot your labor of
[1:51:46] love
[1:51:48] you just be faithful amen she was
[1:51:51] anointed to speak the right words how
[1:51:53] about you and i can we this morning say
[1:51:55] lord
[1:51:55] anoint me to speak the right words
[1:51:59] i don't want to speak what i feel
[1:52:03] i hope you have a little sense of humor
[1:52:05] this morning i heard last night even
[1:52:07] yesterday news travels so fast
[1:52:09] sister kerry might be standing up in
[1:52:11] church tomorrow
[1:52:13] sister kerry don't be embarrassed amen
[1:52:15] but everybody loved the idea that sister
[1:52:17] carrie might be leaning against the wall
[1:52:18] over here too sore
[1:52:20] to sit down
[1:52:31] i crawled around on floors for three
[1:52:33] days
[1:52:34] working on my nice house my knees hurt
[1:52:38] so bad i can't hardly stand here
[1:52:40] you guys want to hear about that
[1:52:44] i want to hear about how hard my life is
[1:52:48] my first world problems
[1:52:53] no what i want to hear about
[1:52:56] is the power of almighty god that will
[1:52:59] come down and we'll save our children
[1:53:02] we'll heal our bodies and the time of
[1:53:05] discouragement will take us and lift us
[1:53:07] up into heavenly places
[1:53:09] i don't want to hear about problems my
[1:53:11] brother and sister
[1:53:12] i'm not going to look behind me and i'm
[1:53:14] not going to look down
[1:53:16] in a crazy world where people will run
[1:53:18] through the congressional deal with a
[1:53:19] buffalo head on their
[1:53:21] head and and do and wash out windows and
[1:53:24] do all of this craziness
[1:53:26] and nation against nation and wars and
[1:53:28] rumors of war
[1:53:29] and pestilences and plagues i'm not
[1:53:31] gonna worry about the problems
[1:53:33] i'm gonna look to the promise and as
[1:53:36] long as there's life in this
[1:53:38] body i can breathe out i want to claim
[1:53:41] the promise
[1:53:43] amen because the promise is more real
[1:53:45] than my problem is
[1:53:47] hallelujah it all depends on the size
[1:53:49] you give credit to your problem
[1:53:52] if you look at your problem have you
[1:53:53] ever noticed that
[1:53:55] the only time i wake up in the middle of
[1:53:57] the night knowing
[1:53:58] oh what am i going to do about this is
[1:54:00] when i haven't let go of the problem
[1:54:05] i'm telling you i've had this in my life
[1:54:06] go to bed at night a major dilemma
[1:54:09] and get down beside the bed lord you
[1:54:11] know i need a good night's sleep and
[1:54:13] father you know paul can't fix this so
[1:54:15] lord i'll just give this to you
[1:54:17] i hope you don't mind lord that this
[1:54:19] looks actually like a trash can but i'm
[1:54:21] going to deposit it right here on the
[1:54:22] altar
[1:54:24] and you go to bed and you sleep all
[1:54:26] night long
[1:54:27] and you get up the next day and somehow
[1:54:29] the problem doesn't seem quite as big
[1:54:32] but the devil will come roaring maybe
[1:54:34] with a phone call
[1:54:36] maybe with an email maybe with a tax
[1:54:38] come back what about your problem
[1:54:40] what about your problem well i'll tell
[1:54:42] you what
[1:54:43] i'm not talking to anybody but the lord
[1:54:46] right now
[1:54:47] but lord when i heard and when i read
[1:54:49] about your word
[1:54:50] and the life it produced i something
[1:54:53] inside of me said that
[1:54:55] ain't nothing but the truth
[1:54:58] hallelujah oh my
[1:55:02] god hallelujah i've got to quit
[1:55:07] first corinthians 2 9 says
[1:55:11] but as it is written i have not seen
[1:55:14] nor ear heard neither
[1:55:17] have entered into the heart of man the
[1:55:19] things which god hath prepared for them
[1:55:21] that love him but god hath revealed them
[1:55:24] unto us

[1:55:28] we're standing there it's revealed to me
[1:55:31] i don't know about you saints but it's
[1:55:32] revealed to me
[1:55:34] amen are you with me it's revealed to me
[1:55:38] this is revealed to me but god hath
[1:55:41] revealed them unto us by his spirit
[1:55:43] for the spirit searches all things yea
[1:55:46] the
[1:55:46] deep things of god amen
[1:55:50] amen for what man knoweth the things
[1:55:54] of a man save the spirit of a man which
[1:55:57] is in him

[1:56:00] but the spirit of god

[1:58:13] the world but the spirit which is of god
[1:58:16] that we might know the things that are
[1:58:18] freely given to us
[1:58:20] of god hallelujah thank you lord
[1:58:23] lord i got my hands up today i'm
[1:58:25] receiving lord everything that you are
[1:58:27] giving
[1:58:27] everything that's free lord i want that
[1:58:30] today
[1:58:31] hallelujah oh no that's not like the
[1:58:34] deal brother isaac told me about one
[1:58:35] time i don't remember it was a video
[1:58:37] clip or something
[1:58:38] people standing in front of the church
[1:58:39] and the pastors up there and he's
[1:58:41] talking about them now god will bless
[1:58:43] you the more you give
[1:58:44] the more god will bless you you know i'd
[1:58:46] like some of you to finally get blessed
[1:58:51] the preacher's standing up there and he
[1:58:53] starts doing the saying
[1:58:55] money money money money money money
[1:58:59] and you know what all of a sudden money
[1:59:02] started
[1:59:03] floating down
[1:59:09] but the problem was the camera swung a
[1:59:11] little bit too high
[1:59:17] and so people got excited and run it up
[1:59:19] started grabbing the money because it's
[1:59:21] floating down it's real money
[1:59:24] but then the preacher you see he wanted
[1:59:26] his money back
[1:59:28] or the church's money back or whoever's
[1:59:30] money it was back
[1:59:31] and so people are running up there
[1:59:32] grabbing that and they're telling whoa
[1:59:35] stop you put that right up here on the
[1:59:36] platform dude
[1:59:39] wait you told us to ask for money
[1:59:46] come on saints some of us treat the holy
[1:59:48] ghost the same way
[1:59:50] praise the lord god moved in the service
[1:59:52] today hasn't been in my house for a year

[1:59:57] oh he's sure strong in church
[2:00:00] well just go ahead bring it all up here
[2:00:01] and leave it on the platform
[2:00:03] you don't need to take it with you no
[2:00:05] that's not what it's about
[2:00:07] it's time for us to realize if you're
[2:00:09] going to be able to pass the word test
[2:00:11] you've got to be reciting come on
[2:00:15] you've got to be reciting you've got to
[2:00:17] be eating you've got to be
[2:00:19] in the presence of the word constantly
[2:00:22] you've got to find the carcass you can't
[2:00:24] say oh i took a bite off the carcass
[2:00:26] that was so good and left it behind
[2:00:27] no sir you got to come back every single
[2:00:30] day
[2:00:30] to the carcass every single day to the
[2:00:34] presence
[2:00:34] every single day that my words would be
[2:00:37] pleasing to god every single day
[2:00:40] my actions every single day amen
[2:00:43] hallelujah because the day will come
[2:00:46] when you're the weakest
[2:00:47] amen and you'll have to pass a word test
[2:00:55] sister emmy would you come musicians
[2:00:57] please
[2:01:00] let's look at this verse 13.
[2:01:04] yes sir which thing's also we speak
[2:01:09] words not in the words
[2:01:13] which man's wisdom teacheth that's right
[2:01:17] that work test my brother and sister is
[2:01:19] called intellectual
[2:01:24] i remember talking to a brother one time
[2:01:26] remember me
[2:01:27] i'm a high school dropout sorry
[2:01:32] i was talking to a brother one time and
[2:01:35] i pronounced the word i knew i
[2:01:36] mispronounced it but i didn't actually
[2:01:38] know exactly how to pronounce it and the
[2:01:40] brother corrected me
[2:01:40] i said well thank you brother and we're
[2:01:43] talking a little longer and i
[2:01:44] mispronounced another word and he
[2:01:45] corrected me
[2:01:48] and then it seemed like the frequency
[2:01:49] got sooner and sooner so i wondered how
[2:01:51] many he had ignored on the front end of
[2:01:52] the conversation
[2:01:54] when it seemed like every other word he
[2:01:55] was like no that you didn't pronounce it
[2:01:57] right
[2:01:57] you didn't use that word in the right
[2:01:58] context you didn't finally i was like
[2:02:00] who's having this conversation
[2:02:08] i'll sound judgmental my brother's
[2:02:11] english was really good and he knew a
[2:02:12] lot of big words and he had
[2:02:14] letters and whatever after his name but
[2:02:17] he doesn't serve god today because the
[2:02:18] word test that mattered
[2:02:21] he didn't pass
[2:02:22] [Music]
[2:02:26] sounds hoarse don't it his life's the
[2:02:28] reality of that
[2:02:29] i'm not judging him the scripture says
[2:02:31] to judge yourself
[2:02:34] but see we want to speak the words which
[2:02:36] the holy ghost teaches
[2:02:38] comparing spiritual things with
[2:02:39] spiritual hallelujah
[2:02:41] you love the lord today oh man
[2:02:45] i tell you i love the lord the natural
[2:02:47] man receiveth not the things of the
[2:02:48] spirit of god
[2:02:50] their foolishness unto him neither can
[2:02:52] he know them because they're spiritually
[2:02:53] discerned
[2:02:54] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[2:02:57] things
[2:02:58] yet he himself is not judged of no man
[2:03:00] that doesn't mean we walk around judging
[2:03:01] everybody yeah i don't think they're a
[2:03:02] believer i don't think this i don't
[2:03:04] think that's also talking about
[2:03:06] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[2:03:08] that he may instruct him
[2:03:11] but we have the mind of christ
[2:03:16] hallelujah amen look i
[2:03:22] my oh my i thought i didn't got enough
[2:03:25] notes up here for nothing we'll be out
[2:03:27] by
[2:03:28] 11 45. i guess that was on monday
[2:03:33] [Music]
[2:03:36] when a man once catches the vision
[2:03:39] of the invisible god and knows that he
[2:03:42] is
[2:03:42] always present you see this what changed
[2:03:46] the
[2:03:47] difference someone might say you know
[2:03:48] brother paul what what was the
[2:03:51] what was the effect of the message on
[2:03:52] you well we were good
[2:03:55] family that was nazarene we were
[2:03:59] good god-fearing people
[2:04:00] [Music]
[2:04:03] you went to church on wednesday night
[2:04:05] you went to church on sunday
[2:04:07] the rest of the time you did whatever
[2:04:09] you wanted
[2:04:14] a married man three children a godly
[2:04:17] wife
[2:04:18] you know what made the difference for me
[2:04:21] i hope this doesn't
[2:04:23] bother any of you it wasn't the words
[2:04:26] that god sent a prophet
[2:04:28] didn't make the difference for me
[2:04:31] it was the effect of the message
[2:04:35] that he carried to us
[2:04:39] and well in my thirties when i woke up
[2:04:41] one day
[2:04:43] and i caught a vision
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:48] that this god that i can't even see
[2:04:52] is right here with me
[2:04:56] it's no longer me against the world but
[2:05:00] it's god in me there's something
[2:05:05] that stabilizes that man's thinking
[2:05:11] i don't know if you're familiar with the
[2:05:12] phrase wilder than a peach orchard boar
[2:05:17] you know what that phrase is that's an
[2:05:20] old hog that's out in the
[2:05:22] peach orchard when the peaches have
[2:05:24] fallen on the ground and they've laid
[2:05:26] there
[2:05:27] and they've started to rot i've
[2:05:30] witnessed this with my own eyes this is
[2:05:32] real this reality
[2:05:34] calves will do the same thing they go
[2:05:37] out there and they start eating these
[2:05:38] half rotten peaches
[2:05:40] and then you got this pig that's drunk
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:44] and when he's drunk pardon me
[2:05:48] he thinks he can do anything
[2:06:01] [Music]
[2:06:04] but when he wakes up from that
[2:06:07] [Music]
[2:06:09] realizes that all he's done is made a
[2:06:10] fool out of
[2:06:15] one himself catches that and that vision
[2:06:19] starts to stabilize his thinking
[2:06:21] [Music]
[2:06:23] it stabilizes his actions
[2:06:26] and the time of distress and trouble
[2:06:30] he won't look in a bottle he won't look
[2:06:33] in a bong
[2:06:35] he won't look in all this garbage of
[2:06:36] this world he'll look up
[2:06:40] the things that are happening around him
[2:06:41] because he's looking at the unseen amen
[2:06:44] yet by promise oh hallelujah
[2:06:48] now how abraham not only did he see the
[2:06:50] unseen and the reason he believed it
[2:06:52] was a revelation that is so simple
[2:06:57] people are missing it god
[2:07:01] said it i didn't have to say it brother
[2:07:06] branham didn't have to say it we don't
[2:07:07] have to pin it to this guy
[2:07:08] spurgeon tozer this one that one
[2:07:11] whatever my brother and sister god said
[2:07:13] it
[2:07:14] who god used to speak it is irrelevant
[2:07:16] god
[2:07:17] said it and god brings his word to pass
[2:07:21] if we being dead in christ we are
[2:07:24] abraham's seed and if the spirit that
[2:07:25] was in christ dwells in us
[2:07:27] it does the same thing it takes every
[2:07:30] divine promise of god that's in his
[2:07:32] bible
[2:07:32] and calls it present
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:38] tense
[2:07:40] and rest itself upon there
[2:07:43] hallelujah i'm gonna pass a word test
[2:07:48] amen when i need to say amen to it i'm
[2:07:51] gonna be able by god's grace it's gonna
[2:07:54] be hurt it's gonna be painful you guys
[2:07:56] don't think the preacher doesn't sit up
[2:07:57] here sometimes and go ouch
[2:08:00] sometimes our own preaching you think oh
[2:08:02] if you saw my notes this morning you say
[2:08:04] how did he get all he got out of that i
[2:08:05] don't know
[2:08:07] but there's times our notes are such and
[2:08:09] we're going this way
[2:08:10] and what the reality of it is is we walk
[2:08:12] out of church repenting
[2:08:16] come on saints i'm telling you the truth
[2:08:18] we walk out of
[2:08:20] church repenting because god's dealt
[2:08:22] with our own heart
[2:08:24] the preacher i'm talking about dealt
[2:08:26] with his own heart
[2:08:27] in the service and we realized lord i'm
[2:08:29] not doing all i could do
[2:08:31] lord i i didn't necessarily do the right
[2:08:33] thing there lord
[2:08:34] oh we're not talking about
[2:08:38] horrible things but you see god's a
[2:08:40] refining firing
[2:08:42] he says you know i got to put a little
[2:08:44] more heat back on you paul got a couple
[2:08:46] more things to get out of you
[2:08:48] and sometimes you think well okay the
[2:08:50] lord would let me sit in church and
[2:08:51] somebody else would preach it and i
[2:08:52] would say amen to and go home
[2:08:54] sometimes you talk about the real irony
[2:08:56] of this when god allows you to preach
[2:08:59] the very thing
[2:09:00] that convicts your own heart that causes
[2:09:03] you to go home and repent over
[2:09:05] oh hallelujah tell me god's got a sense
[2:09:09] of humor
[2:09:10] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:09:15] yes okay we're gonna call it good right
[2:09:17] there
[2:09:18] amen brother jay help me
[2:09:21] amen

[2:09:31] the world my brother and sister
[2:09:35] they're at it again oh if the economy
[2:09:38] gets any worse
