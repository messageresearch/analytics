[28:27] as they'll be gathering on friday
[28:31] i don't have the number here but there's
[28:33] a lighthouse i think i think it's just
[28:35] lighthouse is the
[28:36] title of the song let's sing that as we
[28:40] get
[28:41] ready to receive our pastor
[28:45] kfc
[28:52] there's a lighthouse
[28:55] on a hillside
[28:58] that overlooks
[29:02] life sees when i'm tossed
[29:08] it sends out
[29:13] light that i might see
[29:17] and the light that shines
[29:20] in darkness now will
[29:24] safely
[29:29] [Music]
[29:38] no more
[29:42] and i thank god
[29:46] for the lighthouse
[29:51] i owe my
[29:53] [Music]
[29:56] king jesus is the lighthouse
[30:03] and from the rocks
[30:06] of sin he has
[30:09] shown a lie all around me
[30:13] [Music]
[30:15] and i could clearly see
[30:20] if it wasn't for
[30:24] the lighthouse where would this
[30:35] everybody that
[30:38] lives around me they say
[30:42] tear that old light house down
[30:47] all the big ships
[30:52] [Music]
[30:58] when my mind goes back
[31:01] to that stormy night when
[31:05] just in time i saw the light
[31:10] the light from that old lighthouse
[31:16] that stands up there on
[31:19] a hill
[31:23] and i thank god
[31:26] for the lighthouse
[31:30] i owe my life to him
[31:36] king jesus is the lighthouse
[31:42] and from the rocks of sin
[31:47] he has shown his life
[31:51] all around me and i
[31:55] can literally see
[31:59] if it wasn't for
[32:02] the lighthouse tell me where
[32:07] would this ship be and
[32:10] i thank god
[32:12] [Music]
[32:19] [Music]
[32:26] is
[32:28] and from the rocks
[32:31] of sin he has shown
[32:35] his life all around me
[32:40] that i
[32:51] [Music]
[32:54] skippy
[32:57] [Music]
[32:59] hallelujah you know the prophet of god
[33:03] told us
[33:04] not to look back that the windshield was
[33:08] bigger
[33:08] the rear view mirror was small he said
[33:11] if you keep staring in that you'll run
[33:13] in a ditch
[33:14] but did you know to be a safe driver
[33:18] every once in a while you need to look
[33:19] in the rearview mirror
[33:21] and it does us as sons and daughters of
[33:24] god
[33:25] good to just glance up in the mirror
[33:28] every once in a while and
[33:30] realize you know the paradox as it is
[33:32] that we were in him from before the
[33:34] foundation of the world
[33:36] but yet we in this natural life
[33:39] have a beginning a time that we can say
[33:42] this is when i got
[33:43] saved this is when god turned my life
[33:45] around and
[33:47] thankful that we can look back and see
[33:49] that day amen
[33:51] that we can stand upon the word of god
[33:53] and know that we are secure
[33:56] amen i just want to remind everyone
[33:59] this saturday evening at 7. um
[34:02] also don't forget
[34:06] brother jay grace kids
[34:09] [Laughter]
[34:12] the young people i'm like you're
[34:14] forgetting us you're forgetting us
[34:16] uh at uh brother sergey sister yulia's
[34:19] house at
[34:20] seven o'clock amen i know brother chris
[34:22] is garnering kind of all the attention
[34:24] but we're
[34:25] we're gonna pull some of that back from
[34:27] him a little bit
[34:29] amen well i want to speak to you tonight
[34:32] uh
[34:33] once again the age-old proverbs are
[34:36] still blessing us today are they not
[34:38] and so we want to just go in
[34:42] my thought tonight my title tonight
[34:44] would be
[34:45] my god can do anything amen and and
[34:48] that's a beautiful thing when you think
[34:50] about
[34:51] all through the scripture all through
[34:54] the ages
[34:55] uh the incredible things that god has
[34:58] done
[35:00] if you're a believer
[35:04] i was just looking and studying a
[35:06] certain approach to a thought and
[35:09] as i was looking at that i saw a little
[35:12] blip on the computer screen and i
[35:14] thought oh what does
[35:16] uh i've just now forgot what it is that
[35:18] deal where people write
[35:19] the descriptions of things wikipedia
[35:24] so there was a little notation of
[35:26] wikipedia
[35:28] and so i just thought i'm going to see
[35:29] what somebody said on wikipedia about it
[35:32] and and it said you know that this was
[35:34] just a story
[35:36] just a an allegory an analogy
[35:39] uh if you could even believe it to that
[35:41] extent and i thought
[35:43] you know isn't this interesting it all
[35:45] comes down to
[35:46] we're either believers or we're not
[35:49] right
[35:50] amen and by god's grace we can look at
[35:52] the word of god today and
[35:54] we see ample evidence that when our god
[35:57] decides to turn heaven and earth
[36:00] that he does and so let's just stand and
[36:04] we'll go right into proverbs the second
[36:06] chapter
[36:07] and um we'll read the
[36:12] first to 11th verse amen
[36:16] my son if thou wilt receive my words
[36:21] and hide my commandments with thee so
[36:24] that thou
[36:25] incline thy ear into wisdom and apply
[36:28] thine heart to understanding yea if
[36:31] thou criest after knowledge
[36:35] and lift us up thy voice for
[36:38] understanding if thou
[36:40] seekest her as silver and
[36:43] searches for her as for hid treasures
[36:47] then shout thou understand the fear of
[36:51] the lord
[36:52] and find the knowledge of god for the
[36:54] lord
[36:55] giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh
[36:57] knowledge and understanding
[36:59] he layeth up sound wisdom for the
[37:02] righteous
[37:03] he is a buckler to them that walk
[37:06] uprightly he keepeth the path of
[37:09] judgment
[37:10] and preserveth the way of his saints
[37:14] then shalt thou understand righteousness
[37:17] and judgment inequity yea
[37:20] every good path when wisdom entereth in
[37:24] to thine heart and knowledge is pleasant
[37:27] until thy soul discretion shall preserve
[37:30] thee
[37:31] understanding shall keep thee heavenly
[37:34] father
[37:35] we thank you lord for your word we look
[37:37] low
[37:38] back through the bible find so many
[37:40] things
[37:41] lord that that are encouraging and
[37:43] strengthening and giving guidance and
[37:45] wisdom to us today
[37:47] lord bringing peace to our hearts lord
[37:50] in these troubled times father
[37:52] there's a reassurance that comes from
[37:54] your word
[37:55] lord it's not just the words that give
[37:57] the reassurance but it's your holy
[37:59] spirit that accompanies these words
[38:02] and father we ask you to bless each one
[38:04] tonight
[38:05] those who are not here my brother sergey
[38:08] i believe still out on the road
[38:10] lord of those around us lord maybe that
[38:13] are sick
[38:14] whatever the situations might be the
[38:17] prayer requests lord that have been put
[38:19] forth
[38:20] we're just asking lord for you to touch
[38:22] and move in our midst
[38:24] we ask this in the precious name of
[38:25] jesus christ amen
[38:27] you may be seated i would like to go
[38:30] back
[38:31] and we will just look at this kind of
[38:34] what we did
[38:34] the last wednesday that i spoke and
[38:37] we'll look my brother and sister just
[38:39] real quickly through this uh tonight uh
[38:42] and we'll just start here in the first
[38:44] verse he says my son which would include
[38:46] each and every one of us
[38:47] if thou wilt receive my words and so
[38:50] he has given in that right there a a
[38:54] position to accept or reject
[38:57] if thou wilt receive my words and and he
[39:00] says and you hide my commandments with
[39:02] thee
[39:03] so that thine incline thine ear into
[39:05] wisdom so this is not just saying we
[39:08] have
[39:08] these commandments that we have heard
[39:10] these words but these words are actually
[39:12] bringing an
[39:13] action in our life it's actually causing
[39:16] us to stop and
[39:17] and turn our ear unto wisdom and
[39:21] apply that heart to understanding you
[39:23] know this reminds me of a conversation i
[39:25] had with an
[39:26] individual the other day and and we were
[39:29] talking
[39:29] about how it is interesting that
[39:32] that we as as young people
[39:36] you know are our parents they tried to
[39:38] share
[39:39] certain things with us and they would
[39:41] say you know now
[39:43] whatever you do don't don't go down this
[39:45] path
[39:46] don't don't get a spirit of rebellion uh
[39:49] whatever and they laid out these
[39:51] guidelines and and uh you know i praise
[39:53] god for those that
[39:55] follow those guidelines but uh many said
[39:58] you know what i'm going to find out for
[40:00] myself
[40:00] and so you see from generation to
[40:03] generation
[40:04] how that the lessons have to be learned
[40:07] over and over and over again
[40:10] and and you look at that and you think
[40:11] oh lord would there be a way
[40:14] that we could express to our children
[40:17] that that if they could just uh skip the
[40:20] rebellion
[40:21] and move into the the time of knowledge
[40:25] move into wisdom uh skip those times uh
[40:28] and just trust as it were your parents
[40:31] or your elders or whatever it might be
[40:33] grandparents and but you know it's in
[40:36] the human nature
[40:37] that that we have to have things proven
[40:40] i i think of my
[40:41] little grandson declan you know as we
[40:43] have the little wood stove
[40:45] uh running there in the family room and
[40:48] and how you
[40:48] you tell him no and he turns and looks
[40:51] at you and he shakes his head he takes
[40:53] about three steps away
[40:55] and then he turns right back and he's
[40:57] headed towards it with his hand down
[40:59] and you know my brother and sister i
[41:00] think that's very reflective
[41:02] of how that we are as humans but he's
[41:05] speaking to
[41:06] us here and saying if you'll receive my
[41:08] words and
[41:09] hide my commandments with thee i believe
[41:11] we could take this without changing the
[41:13] scripture
[41:14] and say hide my commandments within thee
[41:17] amen not just you know have them on a
[41:20] piece of paper or something
[41:22] but sow that down and climb thy ears so
[41:25] to be moved in such a fashion that we
[41:27] start to turn our ear
[41:29] to the wisdom of god and as we look down
[41:31] further in this scripture
[41:33] verse 6 he says the lord giveth wisdom
[41:36] so if we're inclining our
[41:37] ear unto wisdom now this is not to be
[41:40] mistaken for
[41:41] the knowledge or wisdom of this world
[41:44] but to
[41:45] be of the things of god and so if we're
[41:47] inclining our ear into wisdom
[41:50] that means we're listening to god we're
[41:52] listening to what god's got to say to us
[41:54] and
[41:55] and you know he's always right on time
[41:57] saints we're the ones that's out of time
[41:59] and
[42:00] he's right on time and so if we incline
[42:03] our ear we we turn our ear to him
[42:07] and he is speaking you'll know that what
[42:09] he's speaking
[42:10] is right for the season it's right for
[42:12] the hour that we're living in
[42:14] and we can trust that and you know we
[42:18] come to a place and
[42:19] and i i don't know i just i will offer
[42:21] myself up and say sometimes uh
[42:25] we're guilty i'm guilty that in times
[42:28] that we need
[42:29] knowledge we need to be able to make
[42:30] decisions it seems like we just become
[42:33] mute
[42:34] we become you know as it were deaf and
[42:36] dumb we can't speak we can't hear
[42:38] and we just labor over what should i do
[42:40] lord what should i do lord what should i
[42:42] do lord
[42:43] but yet we don't really approach it in
[42:45] the correct fashion
[42:47] it's like we become paralyzed oh if we
[42:50] can break through that incline our ear
[42:52] and say
[42:53] lord you have the answers and lord i'm
[42:55] waiting
[42:56] i'm listening and when you speak lord i
[42:59] will be here
[43:00] to hear amen now you think about how he
[43:03] wants us to approach this verse four
[43:06] he says if thou seeketh her as silver
[43:10] my my brother and sister they've turned
[43:14] the whole world practically upside down
[43:16] in the search
[43:17] for precious metals they they go to the
[43:20] far
[43:21] frozen frozen north and and grow i was
[43:24] just reading you know
[43:25] you don't think about it right we think
[43:27] of gnome and we think of all those
[43:29] places in alaska
[43:30] but i was reading where i forget now the
[43:33] the metal was a barium or something like
[43:35] that
[43:36] that you know they are in siberia
[43:39] and uh you know it is such a
[43:42] harsh environment that when the winter
[43:46] closes in they often times they park the
[43:48] equipment
[43:49] and try to winterize it but in the
[43:52] spring when they come back to it
[43:54] things have got so cold that steel beams
[43:57] have snapped off
[43:58] and that's what they do in search of
[44:01] precious metals and
[44:02] and if we could just take that if thou
[44:04] seek us her
[44:05] as silver and searches for her as for
[44:09] hid treasures not my brother and sister
[44:12] is no
[44:12] small effort that is not a passing i
[44:15] think i'll try
[44:16] but that is a serious pressing pressing
[44:20] into desiring for amen
[44:23] amen then thou shalt see when we get to
[44:26] the place that we seek as though
[44:28] it this precious metal we search for as
[44:31] the hid
[44:32] treasure it's then thou shalt understand
[44:35] the fear of the lord
[44:36] not the superficial not just uh from the
[44:39] surface not just
[44:41] the momentary uh consideration
[44:44] is not going to uh reveal to us
[44:47] this understanding but it is those who
[44:50] are
[44:51] so sold out uh kind of tie into what
[44:54] we've been talking about on sunday
[44:55] someone
[44:56] so sold out that they're not going to
[44:58] quit until they find the treasure
[45:01] aren't you glad we found this hidden
[45:03] treasure in
[45:04] human vessels amen thus earth and
[45:06] vessels
[45:07] hallelujah that's where we're not here
[45:09] to glorify ourself
[45:11] we're not here to say oh look at us
[45:14] we're believers
[45:15] but to be able to look at this vessel
[45:18] and say
[45:18] look how profoundly god has changed me
[45:23] look how profoundly god has given wisdom
[45:26] and guidance to us
[45:28] how profoundly god has opened our eyes
[45:31] and
[45:31] ears to see the word for the day that we
[45:34] are living
[45:35] it's easy enough to look at luther my
[45:37] brother and sister the lutherans still
[45:39] are
[45:41] it's easy enough to look at wesley and
[45:42] the wesleyanist nazarene
[45:45] methodist holiness groups are all still
[45:48] looking back into that day
[45:50] but how by god's grace and now what i'm
[45:52] going to say here i hope is not profound
[45:54] to you
[45:55] i hope it is not something you say oh
[45:57] wow but i want you to understand this my
[45:59] brother and sister
[46:00] how blessed we are to see brother
[46:03] branham's ministry
[46:05] but i'm telling you you're even more
[46:07] blessed to see what the ministry was
[46:10] promised
[46:11] to bring forth you see it's one thing
[46:14] to look back and we have all the tapes
[46:16] and we have the testimony
[46:18] and see what brother branham was doing
[46:20] what god was doing through him
[46:21] but to see the opening of the word
[46:25] and how that this coming forth in this
[46:28] day right now is coming forth producing
[46:32] this
[46:32] bride oh thank you lord that we can see
[46:35] the move of god that's taking place
[46:38] right now hallelujah because you see
[46:41] all we have to do is have an ability to
[46:43] look into the historical side
[46:46] if we want to look backwards but you
[46:48] have to have as
[46:49] it were a prophetic vision to see what
[46:52] god is doing
[46:53] right now amen and you know in the world
[46:56] of technology
[46:57] uh brother isaac brother chris brother
[47:00] alex are working in this world of
[47:02] technology
[47:03] my brother and sister brother persona uh
[47:05] right there maybe even on the foremost
[47:07] you know
[47:08] as he told me once brother paul it's
[47:10] just the size of a grain of sand
[47:13] and he said and it's really about made
[47:16] up of the same stuff
[47:17] and my mind just goes because all the
[47:20] sand that i deal with just lays there
[47:22] and
[47:23] blows away if you're not careful it
[47:25] doesn't have memory it doesn't have
[47:27] ability
[47:28] but you see to be on the cutting edge of
[47:31] technology
[47:32] is an incredible thing and to be on the
[47:34] cutting edge
[47:36] of the revelation of jesus christ
[47:39] is a wonderful thing hallelujah you see
[47:42] my brother and sister
[47:43] it's good and it's great to be able to
[47:45] say we saw what god did
[47:48] but to see him moving right now is the
[47:51] very
[47:52] blessing of almighty god opening our
[47:55] hearts and our minds
[47:56] to receive even the unction of the
[48:00] moving of the holy ghost
[48:01] hallelujah not doing lightnings and
[48:04] thunders my brother and sister but as we
[48:06] know
[48:07] as a gentle dove just to feel
[48:10] the sweep of the wing
[48:13] just the stirring and know that it's our
[48:17] lord jesus christ
[48:19] in the form of the holy ghost and coming
[48:21] down here as brother branham teaches us
[48:23] he come down
[48:24] it is god the prophet of god said it is
[48:27] all god
[48:28] my brother and sister but in morphe he
[48:29] come down as the holy spirit
[48:31] moving in our midst
[48:34] we don't need thunder we don't need
[48:36] lightning we don't need the building to
[48:38] shake
[48:39] we just need to be conscious of the
[48:42] presence of almighty god
[48:44] and for us to be completely conscious of
[48:47] that it
[48:48] takes him himself to stir the heart and
[48:52] make that ability within us come out
[48:55] oh many people would say well i i think
[48:57] you're overstating that i feel the
[48:59] moving of god
[49:00] but my brother and sister the word of
[49:02] god shows us clearly
[49:04] that many people will recognize and feel
[49:06] the moving of the holy spirit
[49:08] but never receive what he has for them
[49:12] oh thank you lord that he's stirring our
[49:14] hearts and making us able
[49:16] with a great ability not a simple
[49:18] ability saints
[49:20] i i'm not i'm not here tonight just to
[49:22] roll you up and get you all excited but
[49:24] i'm here to tell you
[49:25] the ability to hear from god is not a
[49:29] simple ability
[49:30] amen while it's god in simplicity this
[49:33] is a very complicated thing
[49:35] because the prophet of god over and over
[49:37] and over again
[49:38] says if you believe if you believe
[49:43] takes the scripture all things are
[49:45] possible
[49:46] only believe if you can believe
[49:49] i want to know what keeps you believing
[49:52] in a world full of fear in a world full
[49:54] of doubts and
[49:55] a world fill all kinds of drama to to
[49:58] take your time
[49:59] what keeps bringing you back to the well
[50:01] of grace
[50:04] nothing but god himself hallelujah
[50:10] oh praise the lord that we would truly
[50:12] understand the fear of the lord
[50:15] and find the knowledge of a god our god
[50:19] he gives wisdom and out of his mouth
[50:21] cometh knowledge and understanding
[50:23] you know the scripture tells us not to
[50:25] worry about what you're going to say you
[50:26] know why
[50:28] he's took over your mouth he's took over
[50:31] your mind
[50:33] you don't have to say well now if they
[50:35] say this i'll say this
[50:37] because you know what'll happen is they
[50:38] won't say that
[50:40] and then they'll take you somewhere you
[50:42] never thought the conversation would go
[50:44] and you'll even find yourself going well
[50:46] now how can i do that
[50:48] and then the holy spirit comes on the
[50:50] scene and you start to speak
[50:52] later you walk away and said well why
[50:53] didn't i say this and why didn't i say
[50:54] that because god didn't want you to
[50:57] amen in some places you speak into the
[50:59] depth of the knowledge of god
[51:01] sometimes you just speak in the
[51:03] superficial
[51:05] because god knows exactly where they're
[51:07] at
[51:08] hallelujah oh my oh my oh my
[51:15] now look at this verse eight
[51:20] you see there's a path of judgment
[51:25] aren't you glad tonight we get to walk
[51:26] that path of judgment
[51:29] we're the one that can walk the path of
[51:31] judgment even tonight
[51:33] and whatever it might be as we before we
[51:35] come out actually brother jason prayed
[51:37] for the service tonight
[51:39] amen and he's saying lord whatever
[51:41] happened today don't
[51:42] let that be any hindrance now what
[51:45] happened today might be just frustration
[51:47] it might not be anything great but you
[51:50] see
[51:51] there's something in the heart of the
[51:52] believer that says lord anything that's
[51:55] in the path
[51:56] forgive me for it clear the path lord
[52:00] i'm asking you lord just clear the path
[52:03] because you see i want nothing between
[52:05] my soul
[52:06] and the savior no obstacles no things we
[52:09] need to stop
[52:10] stumble over you know like i told you
[52:12] before about how
[52:13] years and years ago we'd come to
[52:15] communion and everybody's scurrying all
[52:17] over the
[52:18] church you know telling everybody and
[52:20] you know and you said it to everybody
[52:21] because you wasn't sure who you offended
[52:23] and who you hadn't
[52:25] but you see the holy ghost deals with us
[52:27] differently now
[52:29] because we're recognizing this path of
[52:31] judgment but the word says he keeps that
[52:34] path
[52:36] it's not even us keeping it right it's
[52:39] not us in our ability and what we can do
[52:42] but it's him that keeps the path and he
[52:44] keeps the path by moving
[52:46] on you by the spirit to sweep the path
[52:51] but it's actually him keeping the path
[52:53] because you know i i know you
[52:55] know what i'm talking about and if it's
[52:56] not you it's some folks kind of very
[52:58] similar to you
[53:00] you know we can justify
[53:04] i did that and i shouldn't have but
[53:08] they had it coming and give yourself a
[53:11] few days
[53:12] not only did they have it coming you
[53:14] should have gave them more
[53:16] that's how we justify but what
[53:20] does the keeper of the path of judgment
[53:22] do
[53:23] he comes down we pick our bible up
[53:27] i should have chosen another scripture
[53:31] we go to church and the preacher comes
[53:34] out
[53:35] and you think he must be he meant that
[53:38] towards me
[53:42] and then we're driving home feeling bad
[53:43] because the preacher stomped all over us
[53:45] and we put on a tape
[53:47] and the prophet of god says and you know
[53:49] you should have never done that
[53:52] why because there's a keeper of the path
[53:55] of judgment
[53:56] and he keeps bringing us back to the
[53:59] place of repentance
[54:01] providing atmosphere for us to say lord
[54:05] i'm sorry and the path is then clear to
[54:09] the believer
[54:10] but imagine my brother and sister those
[54:12] that can't be moved by the holy spirit
[54:14] the
[54:14] the baggage the luggage that must be
[54:16] strewn
[54:18] in their path of judgment and it must be
[54:20] dealt with someday
[54:22] right it doesn't just go away
[54:26] you know i run into an old friend at
[54:29] brother joe's funeral and
[54:31] we we were talking and uh some of you
[54:34] would know him brother roddy sheffield
[54:35] and
[54:36] we were we were talking and i don't know
[54:39] where he goes
[54:39] remember the time that you and i did
[54:42] this and this
[54:44] and it actually served to drive home to
[54:47] me
[54:48] how that each one of us has different
[54:50] views
[54:52] of something taking place he remembers
[54:55] something
[54:56] and i said honestly roddy i i don't
[54:59] remember
[55:00] that at all and he's like
[55:04] really
[55:06] i'm like really you see how easy things
[55:10] can
[55:11] fall behind us and be forgotten
[55:14] but god says no problem i'm the keeper
[55:16] of the path
[55:18] and i'll i'll bring it up i'll remind
[55:20] you through the preaching of the word it
[55:22] wasn't something bad we did it was
[55:23] something stupid
[55:25] so but uh you know and the keeper of the
[55:28] passing by the preaching of the word
[55:30] will dredge up things
[55:31] you know what our reaction is they're
[55:33] preaching it's starting to dredge up
[55:35] something i didn't really deal with in
[55:37] my life in the past
[55:38] and you kind of just want to shut that
[55:40] off but do you realize it's the holy
[55:42] ghost saying
[55:43] i want you to get this out in the past i
[55:46] want you to just deal with it
[55:48] all you got to do is say forgive me lord
[55:51] and
[55:52] if it was just something as it were
[55:53] between you and the lord if something
[55:55] someone else then god
[55:56] opens the door for you to deal with
[55:59] those things because god won't bring it
[56:01] to your recall
[56:02] and give you no opportunity to set it
[56:04] correct amen
[56:06] amen then see if he brings it to our
[56:08] recall it's up to us
[56:10] to set it correct you see that's how the
[56:14] spirit of bitterness gets done is
[56:16] because when that was little one could
[56:18] have dealt with it
[56:20] but then it grows so big that it's hard
[56:22] to face that monster
[56:23] in your own personal mental
[56:27] closet praise the lord
[56:32] amen when wisdom entereth in thine heart
[56:34] knowledge is pleasant to thy soul
[56:37] discretion shall preserve thee
[56:40] understanding
[56:41] shall keep thee now i want to just go
[56:44] here
[56:44] into the sermon paradox brother brown
[56:47] says here the hebrew children
[56:50] how would you
[56:53] now how would you make science believe
[56:56] today that a man could go into a furnace
[57:02] oh i would be afraid to say how many
[57:05] fahrenheit's hot it was
[57:07] but could go into that furnace back
[57:09] there in the book of daniel
[57:11] and stay in that furnace until they
[57:13] thought that he
[57:14] they was all burnt down to ashes which
[57:16] even the man the great army of soldiers
[57:19] great husky men
[57:20] that moved out there to throw them in
[57:22] the furnace those men that went in there
[57:24] perished by the intense heat of the
[57:26] furnace against them
[57:28] and they fell into the furnace and was
[57:30] down there
[57:31] down in there for all this time and come
[57:34] out
[57:34] without this even the smell of
[57:38] fire upon them
[57:41] you know what saints if i could just
[57:44] take a moment
[57:45] kind of old home week here
[57:49] i understand how they don't believe this
[57:55] do you understand how they don't believe
[57:56] this
[57:59] defies every bit of logic
[58:03] defies every bit of science
[58:07] physics defies it all
[58:13] what they don't realize is
[58:17] the god we serve amen see that's the
[58:21] problem
[58:22] they're caught up with the idea
[58:25] that god is like us and there's just
[58:28] some things
[58:30] you can't do
[58:34] so they look in word
[58:37] of themself to reason
[58:41] this is not possible
[58:45] but the word gave the antidote didn't it
[58:48] yes sure enough i bear my
[58:49] shoulder i take the antidote that
[58:52] all things are possible
[58:57] and when that antidote takes place and
[58:59] gets a hols of our life
[59:00] we find ourself coming and approaching
[59:03] everything in life
[59:04] not just spiritual things my brother and
[59:07] sister
[59:07] everything in life you start to approach
[59:10] it why because it has
[59:12] like a vaccine if that would be an
[59:13] example it has
[59:15] permeated every pore of your
[59:18] body if it is a church experience you
[59:21] will only satisfy that at church
[59:24] it is a physical human element
[59:26] experience
[59:27] you will only satisfy that in the thrill
[59:30] and adrenaline rush and etc
[59:32] of this life but when it becomes an
[59:35] all-encompassing
[59:36] experience it takes a holds of you no
[59:39] matter what's going on in your life
[59:41] you realize i'm a believer that means
[59:43] god can come on the scene
[59:45] this moment right now i don't need to
[59:48] question
[59:49] how when where what it would be my god
[59:52] is able
[59:53] hallelujah and that is the the effect
[59:57] that the word of god has when it starts
[59:59] to move through the life of a real
[1:00:01] believer
[1:00:02] you say brother paul you said real
[1:00:03] believer that's right my brother and
[1:00:05] sister
[1:00:05] the make-believer the partial believer
[1:00:07] the nine-tenths believer
[1:00:10] will never have the same effect upon the
[1:00:13] word upon
[1:00:14] them that they have my brother that the
[1:00:16] real believer i'm just excited excuse me
[1:00:19] amen that nine tenths believer will
[1:00:22] never
[1:00:22] understand the fact that the word of god
[1:00:25] would bring
[1:00:25] because they've only received it in that
[1:00:28] portion
[1:00:29] and if you are in a falling number
[1:00:31] declining you know 8 10
[1:00:33] 7 10 6 5 4 3 2 1 no wonder my brother
[1:00:37] and sister
[1:00:37] that the church has become dead no
[1:00:40] wonder because people are approaching it
[1:00:43] from their accomplishment now i'm not
[1:00:45] faulting anyone
[1:00:46] we all have our place in life but my
[1:00:48] brother and sister you will see it in
[1:00:50] humanity
[1:00:51] some people they just dream at the level
[1:00:53] that they live in other words
[1:00:55] if they got a job at the dog food
[1:00:57] factory when they were 18
[1:00:58] they'll retire in the dog food factory
[1:01:01] but there's others that look at the
[1:01:03] heavens
[1:01:04] and say you know what i can do all that
[1:01:06] i
[1:01:07] set my mind to and they go out and they
[1:01:10] pursue that and people say well
[1:01:11] they failed five times well number six
[1:01:14] might be a failure
[1:01:15] number seven might be the answer
[1:01:18] hallelujah and then everybody says well
[1:01:20] i wished i'd got
[1:01:20] rich quick like them yeah
[1:01:25] see these great men they died
[1:01:29] just throwing them into the fire
[1:01:32] and when the time is right let me put
[1:01:34] that right the word
[1:01:35] says there's a season for everything
[1:01:38] amen when they're down in there for all
[1:01:40] this time
[1:01:41] and they come out without even the smell
[1:01:44] of fire upon them
[1:01:46] i'm going to tell you right now that is
[1:01:48] physically impossible
[1:01:51] would you agree with me it's physically
[1:01:53] impossible
[1:01:54] but it's not impossible for my god
[1:01:57] hallelujah when the son or daughter of
[1:01:59] god anointed by the holy ghost in the
[1:02:01] service of almighty god
[1:02:03] my brother and sister the word promised
[1:02:04] we could walk through the fire
[1:02:06] amen and we could come out without the
[1:02:08] smell of smoke amen we can walk through
[1:02:10] those things or they say the diseases
[1:02:13] and this and that sister jerry shared
[1:02:15] with me that bill gates is already
[1:02:16] declaring the next pandemic
[1:02:18] is going to be 10 or 20 times worse
[1:02:22] what is he talking about maybe he's
[1:02:25] helped created
[1:02:27] the next pandemic after all the ultra
[1:02:30] rich would like less people on the earth
[1:02:32] and those people that are on the earth
[1:02:34] they actually want them there
[1:02:35] for their benefit that's called
[1:02:38] servitude
[1:02:41] well i'm not so scared about having to
[1:02:43] serve a man as it would be to be coerced
[1:02:46] to serving the devil
[1:02:49] amen because in the year of jubilee
[1:02:52] the man was set free and i'm telling you
[1:02:55] what we can stand tonight and say
[1:02:57] he who has been set free is free indeed
[1:03:00] hallelujah we didn't put our ear to the
[1:03:02] post
[1:03:02] we went out of there so fast all they
[1:03:04] saw was dust
[1:03:05] hallelujah amen
[1:03:08] god performing a miracle oh hey we serve
[1:03:12] a miracle working god
[1:03:14] that was a genuine paradox of the
[1:03:16] keeping power of god
[1:03:18] against do you read what i read
[1:03:22] it was just talking about them at the
[1:03:24] fiery furnace is what the prophet's
[1:03:26] saying here right
[1:03:29] come on i need to downplay this so
[1:03:30] nobody gets any great expectations
[1:03:36] are you with me saints the prophet of
[1:03:39] god if you think he's just saying words
[1:03:41] then that's good
[1:03:42] but he said this is a genuine paradox of
[1:03:44] the keeping power of god
[1:03:46] against any enemy
[1:03:49] and when a man is ready to admit god is
[1:03:52] true
[1:03:52] and god keeps his word and honors those
[1:03:54] who believe in him certainly
[1:03:56] i believe in a paradox
[1:04:00] hallelujah that's the god we serve amen
[1:04:04] a god that can do anything
[1:04:07] now as we look at this i want to go to
[1:04:10] first thessalonians
[1:04:14] 5 21-24 here
[1:04:18] and this is something that we as
[1:04:19] christians should not just roll over and
[1:04:21] play dead and act like we don't need to
[1:04:23] do this
[1:04:24] we should come and do our homework
[1:04:27] in the word of god we should take
[1:04:31] time to prove to ourself
[1:04:36] you say well brother paul wouldn't that
[1:04:37] be doubting absolutely not
[1:04:39] because god put it right here in the
[1:04:40] word prove all things
[1:04:45] that's the good the bad the ugly the
[1:04:47] total stranger
[1:04:49] or the people who are closest to you who
[1:04:52] might speak
[1:04:54] something that would affect your eternal
[1:04:58] destination
[1:05:00] amen so that might come right down here
[1:05:04] sorry preachers you make up about half
[1:05:06] the congregation tonight
[1:05:10] anything that comes right here right
[1:05:12] ought to be able to be put here
[1:05:15] you see not this i'ma just say it like i
[1:05:18] feel it is that all right
[1:05:19] not this garbage i was raised up with
[1:05:22] how dare you
[1:05:23] question the ministry no i say my
[1:05:26] brother and sister
[1:05:27] the scripture says prove all things
[1:05:31] hold fast to that which is good abstain
[1:05:35] from
[1:05:35] even something that appears to be wrong
[1:05:42] and the very god of peace sanctify you
[1:05:44] holy
[1:05:45] and i pray god your whole spirit and
[1:05:47] soul and body
[1:05:48] be preserved amen
[1:05:52] i almost preached on just the thought of
[1:05:55] being preserved tonight but
[1:05:57] we'll save that for another time
[1:06:00] amen he said i pray god your whole
[1:06:03] spirit and soul and body be preserved
[1:06:05] blameless
[1:06:06] in other words can find fault why can't
[1:06:09] they find fault
[1:06:11] because you allowed the master of the
[1:06:14] path
[1:06:15] control of your life he said i want to
[1:06:18] bring you down this path to judgment you
[1:06:20] are going to judge yourself
[1:06:21] now that you don't have to be judged
[1:06:23] later
[1:06:25] and you've said yes lord yes lord
[1:06:29] thank you lord it's painful it's
[1:06:31] embarrassing i'm ashamed of myself
[1:06:33] i'm this i'm that but it doesn't matter
[1:06:36] because you see now there's no luggage
[1:06:37] no baggage behind you
[1:06:40] amen oh isn't that beautiful you're
[1:06:42] preserved blameless into the coming of
[1:06:44] our lord jesus christ
[1:06:46] faithful is he that calleth you who also
[1:06:49] will do it oh isn't that beautiful
[1:06:52] amen when we wouldn't volunteer to walk
[1:06:55] down the path of judgment
[1:06:56] he comes and woos us and we step into
[1:06:59] the path and we say lord forgive me
[1:07:02] and some people would say well that's
[1:07:03] just living life what are you worried
[1:07:05] about
[1:07:06] i'm not worried i'm just obedient
[1:07:10] to the wooing of the holy spirit
[1:07:13] that comes and says what you said what
[1:07:15] you did what you thought how you acted
[1:07:17] it's not right oh my isn't that
[1:07:20] beautiful
[1:07:21] hallelujah see my god can do anything in
[1:07:25] laodicea
[1:07:26] the most wicked of the ages
[1:07:29] coming right back in the very semblance
[1:07:32] of it was
[1:07:33] of sodom
[1:07:36] but in a much more complex age
[1:07:43] why because we have seven ages worth of
[1:07:45] demons
[1:07:46] they've been released out of the river
[1:07:48] euphrates just poured out
[1:07:51] you can call it what you want some
[1:07:53] people might reference it as hollywood
[1:07:55] some might reference it uh you know
[1:07:57] something different whatever it is see
[1:07:59] it's all been
[1:08:00] turned out it's all been turned loose
[1:08:02] and you're standing here in the middle
[1:08:04] of this
[1:08:04] doing what the devil thought would be
[1:08:07] impossible
[1:08:08] and that was to stand solid on the word
[1:08:10] of god not
[1:08:11] compromised not mixing it not making it
[1:08:14] into a pale horse
[1:08:16] but standing there saying i want just
[1:08:18] the purity of the holy spirit
[1:08:20] hallelujah oh how beautiful that is now
[1:08:23] let's just keep going here so i can go
[1:08:25] now in the choosing of a bride what an
[1:08:27] incredible sermon
[1:08:28] i i just have to say it's an incredible
[1:08:31] sermon
[1:08:32] amen now i'm just pulling this out so
[1:08:35] remember go
[1:08:36] read more study it out we're not trying
[1:08:38] to cherry pick we just don't have
[1:08:40] uh uh you know enough time i guess you
[1:08:44] would say
[1:08:45] the other so obviously you'll see
[1:08:48] what he's talking to he's bringing
[1:08:50] reference now now he says the other is
[1:08:52] pregnanted by the word of god
[1:08:54] and we'll bring forth the body the
[1:08:56] finished
[1:08:57] oh don't you love that the finished not
[1:09:00] an immature as we were talking on sunday
[1:09:02] see
[1:09:03] you know while esther was coming into
[1:09:05] her maturity
[1:09:06] vasti already was in a position but she
[1:09:09] would have dis
[1:09:10] discounted or not been inclined to give
[1:09:13] much credit to someone like esther
[1:09:15] because hey she's a nothing but esther
[1:09:17] was on the way up and
[1:09:18] vashti was on the way down
[1:09:22] whoa the finished body of jesus christ
[1:09:26] which is the bride
[1:09:28] the body of christ isn't finished yet
[1:09:31] now this was in 65 my brother and sister
[1:09:34] but a rapture has not taken place so we
[1:09:37] are still looking
[1:09:38] at a body of believers being molded into
[1:09:42] this body
[1:09:43] called the bride amen and it's still
[1:09:46] taking place and i say thank you lord
[1:09:48] because people are saying well you know
[1:09:50] it might be the last one is in
[1:09:52] well you know when the last one comes to
[1:09:54] perfection we'll have a rapture and you
[1:09:56] know what i hate to say this but it
[1:09:58] could be one of us
[1:10:01] right still fighting with things of our
[1:10:04] life still
[1:10:05] fighting with struggle still working on
[1:10:07] surrendering but don't be ashamed of
[1:10:09] anything like that because this body is
[1:10:11] a perfect body right
[1:10:13] amen let's just say how does that phrase
[1:10:16] go
[1:10:16] to uh you know even if you don't start
[1:10:19] the game
[1:10:20] to make the first team is incredible
[1:10:26] you understand people are like well
[1:10:30] i made the team but somebody else is
[1:10:32] playing
[1:10:33] shortstop and i'm not just the fact you
[1:10:36] have a uniform on
[1:10:38] and you are standing there as it were
[1:10:39] this analogy of the stadium
[1:10:43] and you're right there at any moment for
[1:10:44] them to call upon you
[1:10:47] you see just because this bride hasn't
[1:10:49] made a rapture yet doesn't mean she's
[1:10:51] not glorious
[1:10:52] does not mean that she is some kind of
[1:10:55] crippled or
[1:10:56] inadequate amen god's just perfecting
[1:10:59] her
[1:11:03] and a man and woman christ isn't
[1:11:06] finished yet
[1:11:07] how many knows that a man and woman is
[1:11:10] one and christ is one body the
[1:11:12] word the bride will have to be the rest
[1:11:14] of that body i read this to you just the
[1:11:16] other day
[1:11:17] so i have to be the rest of that body
[1:11:18] and the two together makes one body
[1:11:20] again
[1:11:20] like adam was at the beginning man and
[1:11:22] his wife are one now she
[1:11:24] the true bride so sold out to
[1:11:27] him that she has no
[1:11:30] that she used no mind of her own
[1:11:35] i think that might be some of our
[1:11:37] problem
[1:11:38] we're still using our mind
[1:11:44] we're getting closer though aren't we
[1:11:46] hallelujah
[1:11:48] i'll tell you what we'll see it god's
[1:11:49] way whether we come willingly or he
[1:11:51] comes dragging us
[1:11:53] but you called as the bride of christ
[1:11:55] will come you are coming you are
[1:11:57] it hallelujah now she
[1:12:00] the true bride so sold out to him that
[1:12:03] she used no mind of her own
[1:12:05] his mind of course is his will
[1:12:08] and his will is his word
[1:12:12] amen amen amen
[1:12:16] i'm just going to throw this in if
[1:12:19] somebody comes along and says
[1:12:21] the lord told me to do this
[1:12:27] that doesn't fit right here
[1:12:32] we don't even need to argue about it
[1:12:37] it doesn't fit in here if it's contrary
[1:12:39] to one
[1:12:40] word the prophet of god said flee from
[1:12:43] it
[1:12:45] now flee i think is a faster pace than
[1:12:47] the shanter right
[1:12:50] flee from it that means i think probably
[1:12:53] meaning running
[1:12:54] full tilt but have you noticed saints
[1:12:57] what's happening
[1:12:58] in the world today and i'm not talking
[1:13:01] about
[1:13:02] some denomination out here i'm talking
[1:13:03] about in the in the world that we know
[1:13:06] people are saying well i was praying the
[1:13:08] other night and the lord told me
[1:13:11] and it's contrary right with the word of
[1:13:14] god
[1:13:17] but we're such an enlightened what do
[1:13:19] they call that now
[1:13:21] we're woke we're woke
[1:13:26] and i don't mean to embarrass sister
[1:13:29] jerry but she
[1:13:30] sometimes i wouldn't say she has more
[1:13:32] time than i do but while the dishwasher
[1:13:34] is running she
[1:13:35] you know so to speak or the clothes
[1:13:36] washers running she has these moments
[1:13:38] and she pointed out we were just
[1:13:41] discussing this the other day and
[1:13:42] and how people seem to be offended if
[1:13:45] the preaching gets
[1:13:46] sorry sister nadia
[1:13:51] if the preaching gets just too close
[1:13:58] people get offended it just wasn't right
[1:14:02] i don't say this is something you need
[1:14:04] to do
[1:14:06] but if you want to have time and you can
[1:14:08] just listen to the prophet
[1:14:10] he names names way more often
[1:14:13] than we would like to admit
[1:14:17] he doesn't beat around the bush either
[1:14:20] imagine you're the little lady that's
[1:14:22] been troubled by spirits
[1:14:24] and about out of your mind and finally
[1:14:28] you come to the prophet and you're there
[1:14:30] in an interview
[1:14:32] and he tells you when your husband was
[1:14:34] here you were
[1:14:35] here you were unfaithful to him and
[1:14:38] she's screaming no don't say that he'll
[1:14:41] leave me he'll leave me
[1:14:42] the prophet god says don't worry about
[1:14:43] it he has the same thing to confess
[1:14:47] and then i believe it's one or two
[1:14:49] services later
[1:14:52] prophet of god stands in the pulpit
[1:14:55] tells the whole world
[1:14:58] they were unfaithful they run into each
[1:15:00] other's arms and they repented and god
[1:15:02] restored both of them
[1:15:04] and anything less than a rocket
[1:15:08] scientist
[1:15:12] connects all the dots
[1:15:16] you think the prophet cared
[1:15:19] no jesus stood right there and spoke to
[1:15:21] them and says imagine
[1:15:24] pretty close company you are of your
[1:15:28] father
[1:15:29] the devil you imagine you're a priest
[1:15:33] you're important and there are people
[1:15:36] around here that you know are believing
[1:15:38] this this this beelzebub and and he just
[1:15:42] said you're of your father the devil and
[1:15:45] i had no way to refute that
[1:15:48] just mumble a few words in our defense
[1:15:51] our fathers yeah your fathers are the
[1:15:54] ones
[1:15:55] who put them in the tomb and then whited
[1:15:56] them
[1:15:59] i'm telling you god god gets downright
[1:16:00] and personal my brother and sister
[1:16:03] i'm telling you i think we're going to
[1:16:04] come the prophet of god actually said
[1:16:06] we'll come to a day
[1:16:07] when these things will be called out in
[1:16:10] the house of god
[1:16:11] and it won't be called out by an angry
[1:16:13] preacher getting a vindictive stab at
[1:16:16] somebody
[1:16:16] it will be god bringing a people into
[1:16:19] the path of judgment
[1:16:21] and bringing them to come to a place
[1:16:23] that they'll repent and
[1:16:24] and clear these things out of their
[1:16:26] lives i say god let us come into that
[1:16:28] path
[1:16:29] without you having to bring us oh
[1:16:32] hallelujah amen because you see we're
[1:16:35] the rest of that body do we believe that
[1:16:37] we are the rest of that body and the two
[1:16:40] together makes one body again
[1:16:43] amen and that's what his word declared
[1:16:45] and his word is his will so god is here
[1:16:48] tonight telling us saints
[1:16:49] my will for you is to get yourself to
[1:16:52] the place
[1:16:53] i can be brought back and molded right
[1:16:57] back
[1:16:57] you molded to me i mold it to you
[1:17:00] however you want to put it there
[1:17:01] coming into one body we don't need
[1:17:04] something else we don't need the world
[1:17:07] between us we don't need the world
[1:17:09] leaving a lump as it were
[1:17:10] we need to clean it all out and let best
[1:17:13] come that we can come right together
[1:17:16] and be that one in christ oh hallelujah
[1:17:20] lord help me to be that sold out that's
[1:17:23] my
[1:17:23] that's my heart's desire lord amen is to
[1:17:26] be sold out
[1:17:27] now look if god called you then he will
[1:17:31] provide for you
[1:17:33] and my brother and sister when i say
[1:17:34] he'll provide for you i'm not talking
[1:17:36] about a house closed food whatever
[1:17:38] if god called you then he's provided the
[1:17:41] prophet of god said everything you need
[1:17:43] to make the
[1:17:44] rapture is already in you god has
[1:17:46] provided for you
[1:17:48] already everything it takes to make a
[1:17:51] rapture
[1:17:52] oh god help us to tap into this not
[1:17:55] later
[1:17:56] but now amen i don't want to be out of
[1:17:59] season lord
[1:18:00] but we don't want this to slide behind
[1:18:02] us
[1:18:03] as some kind of historical thing when
[1:18:05] the promise is right here
[1:18:07] for us to possess it because he said i
[1:18:10] provided it for you
[1:18:13] will you come no lord i'm on a spiritual
[1:18:16] diet right now
[1:18:17] i felt like i was getting too spiritual
[1:18:19] for my church
[1:18:21] so i just went on a drought
[1:18:24] come on no the devil would like us to
[1:18:28] the devil would like to bring us to a
[1:18:30] point that we just feel like we're so
[1:18:31] spiritual we don't need any more of god
[1:18:34] i remember one of the most ridiculous
[1:18:35] statements that i ever heard
[1:18:37] i heard a person say we've heard enough
[1:18:39] of the message
[1:18:41] i think i'll tell you at the time i'm so
[1:18:43] stunned i never even responded
[1:18:45] but i'm telling you that's one of the
[1:18:46] most ridiculous statements i've ever
[1:18:48] heard an individual
[1:18:50] make that we've had enough of the
[1:18:52] message
[1:18:55] well i'll tell you what my brother and
[1:18:56] sister that might work for them but it
[1:18:58] ain't working very good for me
[1:19:00] hallelujah you know it's kind of like
[1:19:04] this city buffet that's over there by
[1:19:06] by winco or whatever my brother and
[1:19:08] sister
[1:19:09] if you walk out of there hungry you
[1:19:12] probably
[1:19:12] you probably deserve to be hungry the
[1:19:14] food's terrible
[1:19:16] but there's a lot of it
[1:19:21] yeah i didn't want this to sound like a
[1:19:22] ringing endorsement for the city of the
[1:19:24] city buffet the food's terrible
[1:19:28] but there's so much food in that place
[1:19:31] that if you walk out hungry it's still
[1:19:33] your fault
[1:19:35] amen if you find even just one egg roll
[1:19:37] that you like
[1:19:38] there'll be 500 of them there for you to
[1:19:40] eat
[1:19:42] hallelujah but look at this
[1:19:45] i want you to understand when god gets
[1:19:48] in the provision business gets into the
[1:19:50] providing business
[1:19:52] amen he will come and as he deals with
[1:19:55] sons and daughters of god
[1:19:57] now sometimes my brother and sister you
[1:19:58] have to understand we
[1:20:00] do things and we don't even realize why
[1:20:02] we do them only to find out later that
[1:20:04] was the moving of the holy spirit
[1:20:06] positionally placing you amen
[1:20:09] things i i know we're guilty of this and
[1:20:11] it works both ways
[1:20:12] they'll be the time that we'll say amen
[1:20:14] to things and end up saying
[1:20:16] amen to something that we realize whoa i
[1:20:18] i wish i hadn't said amen to that
[1:20:20] but the holy spirit will move on you
[1:20:23] to say amen to things of the word
[1:20:26] that you can't even explain
[1:20:30] but god wants you to be a partaker of
[1:20:34] this
[1:20:35] portion of the promise that he anoints
[1:20:38] you
[1:20:38] to sit there on the pew and say so be it
[1:20:42] lord
[1:20:43] and you don't even understand what
[1:20:45] you're saying amen to
[1:20:46] but god is counting it to you for
[1:20:49] righteousness
[1:20:50] and releasing that to you in your spirit
[1:20:53] and people say well why can't you
[1:20:54] explain this and why can't you
[1:20:56] explain that i don't know i don't know
[1:20:58] the finer details what i do know is it's
[1:21:00] real and i believe it
[1:21:02] amen and people then say well well you
[1:21:04] just can't believe that if you don't
[1:21:05] understand it can't explain it
[1:21:07] no mother brother sister you can amen i
[1:21:10] wasn't called to be an explainer
[1:21:11] i don't find anywhere in the world that
[1:21:13] it says amen that you
[1:21:15] you would uh uh attain to the promise
[1:21:18] because you explained it
[1:21:20] no i tell you what it does it shows you
[1:21:22] over and over and over again you attain
[1:21:23] to the promise because you believed it
[1:21:26] hallelujah amen amen
[1:21:30] because see she's not to have a mind of
[1:21:31] her own amen
[1:21:33] you know what god will do he'll even
[1:21:35] provide you
[1:21:37] an alibi
[1:21:41] did you know that every christian needs
[1:21:42] a good alibi
[1:21:46] when the devil says you're going to be
[1:21:48] over here this is what you are this is
[1:21:50] it
[1:21:51] you can stand on the word the holy
[1:21:53] spirit will say he never did it
[1:21:55] that's right never did it
[1:21:59] and the devil will say i've got proof
[1:22:01] and god would say
[1:22:02] bring it out you know i spoke of that
[1:22:06] inspiration come to me that one one
[1:22:08] service you know
[1:22:09] all satan's got us as xerox coffee he's
[1:22:12] got no other proof my brother and sister
[1:22:14] and god says well nope sorry i've got i
[1:22:17] hold
[1:22:18] the evidence off the evidence what would
[1:22:21] you call it
[1:22:22] room i hold the evidence room and
[1:22:24] there's not
[1:22:25] one bit of evidence in here he ever done
[1:22:28] it
[1:22:29] god says i give you a better alibi than
[1:22:31] that he's under the blood
[1:22:33] that's where he's at that's where he's
[1:22:35] at it's right here under the blood
[1:22:38] boy that must be frustrating for the
[1:22:39] devil
[1:22:41] amen as brother jason brought that out i
[1:22:43] i got quite a good chuckle out of that
[1:22:45] amen saying happy birthday to the devil
[1:22:47] so he was
[1:22:48] reminded he's got an end coming amen he
[1:22:51] might have a lot of birthdays under his
[1:22:53] belt right now but that just means his
[1:22:54] days are shortened
[1:22:56] yeah yeah he provides a scriptural
[1:23:00] foundation for you
[1:23:02] you realize that every one of us is just
[1:23:04] enough different that we come
[1:23:06] out of the scripture you might say the
[1:23:07] same only different
[1:23:10] that's right absolutely you catch that
[1:23:13] you understand that
[1:23:13] yes you come out the same only different
[1:23:16] and you realize god puts a spiritual
[1:23:18] foundation a scriptural
[1:23:20] foundation under every one of us
[1:23:23] one never has went out and done a thing
[1:23:25] wrong in their whole life
[1:23:27] another comes he looks like an absolute
[1:23:30] tornado of trouble
[1:23:32] god puts a foundation under him god puts
[1:23:35] a foundation under him
[1:23:38] some young lady might come from totally
[1:23:40] the wrong side of the city
[1:23:43] but the saving grace of almighty god
[1:23:45] comes and puts a spiritual foundation
[1:23:48] under her that she can look in the word
[1:23:50] of god and say well i didn't come the
[1:23:51] way they all came
[1:23:53] but praise the lord i can identify right
[1:23:56] here
[1:23:56] and put a scriptural spiritual
[1:23:58] foundation
[1:23:59] under them and a young lady can grow up
[1:24:02] in church and never spend a day or
[1:24:04] time of her life ever outside of the
[1:24:06] walls of the word of god
[1:24:08] and god comes says blessed blessed
[1:24:14] oh think about it saints my god can do
[1:24:17] anything
[1:24:18] oh hallelujah amen
[1:24:23] you know what what we have is a problem
[1:24:24] in the world we live in today
[1:24:26] god will provide for every need but in
[1:24:28] this confused world it's become a
[1:24:30] confused world even in the church of
[1:24:32] wants and needs
[1:24:34] amen what we really have need of is god
[1:24:38] and it really should become what our
[1:24:40] primary want as i come out of this
[1:24:42] scripture
[1:24:43] that we read there amen it should be our
[1:24:45] want amen we should presu
[1:24:47] pursue it as though it was silver
[1:24:51] we should pursue it as though it was
[1:24:53] hidden treasure
[1:25:03] hallelujah well i just i'll finish up on
[1:25:06] this last quote
[1:25:07] just happens to be about 10 pages long
[1:25:13] what time is it
[1:25:17] i was talking some time ago to a
[1:25:18] scientist that was
[1:25:20] that when joshua the great warrior who
[1:25:23] stood by the river of jordan that
[1:25:24] separated israel in the wilderness from
[1:25:26] the promised land
[1:25:27] the great stream that's always believed
[1:25:29] among the people that represents death
[1:25:31] that we cross
[1:25:32] the jordan to the promised land as jesus
[1:25:34] gave us in john 14.
[1:25:37] the just separation is the death line
[1:25:40] when joshua who had stood and heard
[1:25:42] moses teach
[1:25:43] and had heard moses the prophet and had
[1:25:45] saw the great signs of god
[1:25:48] of god work by his prophet one day while
[1:25:51] encamped a great military man had all
[1:25:54] israel gathered at the bank they had
[1:25:56] come out because god had given them a
[1:25:58] promise
[1:25:59] and he had performed many miracles
[1:26:02] now i want to stop has our god performed
[1:26:05] many miracles
[1:26:07] so so we are for sure talking about the
[1:26:09] same god right
[1:26:11] amen because sometimes you know i hear
[1:26:14] people talk
[1:26:16] especially the antis what what was the
[1:26:19] quote sunday i think
[1:26:20] brother brown called the rejecters get
[1:26:22] away from the rejecters
[1:26:25] you know to hear the rejecters talk
[1:26:27] sometimes
[1:26:29] god had done nothing ever
[1:26:34] in this message it's dead
[1:26:37] d.o.a god hasn't moved
[1:26:40] come on this is according to the
[1:26:43] rejecters
[1:26:48] but it's funny because i could just bore
[1:26:51] you to tears because you've probably
[1:26:52] heard most of
[1:26:54] things in my life before
[1:26:57] but while they say god's never done
[1:26:59] anything
[1:27:00] i stand here and tell you i serve a
[1:27:02] miracle miracle-working
[1:27:04] god hallelujah
[1:27:07] i've had like little things you know
[1:27:09] just to kind of give you a little
[1:27:10] glimpse of it i might have told you
[1:27:11] about my childhood how
[1:27:13] we spun a pickup out on the top of a
[1:27:15] ravine and it's sitting there
[1:27:17] virtually straight up and down like this
[1:27:19] and we're looking about 300 yards down
[1:27:21] at the bottom of a ravine
[1:27:23] thinking what it's going to feel like to
[1:27:24] die and yet able to climb out of that
[1:27:27] pickup and not only that be able to hook
[1:27:29] a
[1:27:29] cable on that pickup and pull it back up
[1:27:31] the bank to find out it was held in
[1:27:34] place on the side of the mountain by a
[1:27:35] rock that big
[1:27:38] wedged up against the tire in the winter
[1:27:41] time
[1:27:42] in mud
[1:27:45] i'm sure that rock way i don't know i
[1:27:47] can't inspect the rock because it fell
[1:27:49] in the canyon
[1:27:50] as soon as we pulled the pickup back up
[1:27:54] oh but i have a rock i have a rock
[1:27:58] saints
[1:27:59] i ever tell you about the time i was
[1:28:00] traveling through the middle of oregon
[1:28:02] in the middle of the winter in the
[1:28:02] middle of the night
[1:28:05] and it turned into freezing fog and i
[1:28:07] was so tired i should have been parked
[1:28:08] but on top the mountain there's nowhere
[1:28:10] to park and
[1:28:11] i looked in the mirror brother trevor
[1:28:12] really appreciate this brother vasily
[1:28:14] would really appreciate this
[1:28:16] i looked in the mirror and i thought
[1:28:18] that's really weird that looks like my
[1:28:20] load
[1:28:21] tarped and i'm driving down the mountain
[1:28:24] with my trailer sticking straight out
[1:28:26] beside me
[1:28:29] and all i could do i had lightning quick
[1:28:32] reaction you know that lightning quick
[1:28:34] god help me
[1:28:40] my feet never moved my hands never moved
[1:28:42] nothing else never moved
[1:28:44] my lightning reaction was god help me
[1:28:48] and i watched in the mirror as the
[1:28:50] trailer just drifted right behind me
[1:28:53] and never even gave the truck a tail bob
[1:28:56] and i went on down the mountain i don't
[1:28:58] know i guess that could have just
[1:29:00] happened
[1:29:04] oh did i tell you that as i was looking
[1:29:06] at it before its momentum was going
[1:29:08] further
[1:29:08] and further and further
[1:29:13] and pretty soon i would i'm sorry for
[1:29:15] the humor i might have thought
[1:29:16] i was mistaken i'm actually driving up
[1:29:18] this mountain
[1:29:20] yeah no no i'm sorry the rejecters
[1:29:23] what they got to say my brother and
[1:29:25] sister but you see
[1:29:28] the promise of the word was that moses a
[1:29:31] prophet let me put it that way would
[1:29:32] teach
[1:29:33] and we would hear the prophet and we saw
[1:29:36] the great signs that god did by his
[1:29:38] prophet
[1:29:39] and one day in camp the great military
[1:29:41] man had all israel gathered at the bank
[1:29:42] they'd come out because god had given
[1:29:44] them
[1:29:45] a promise good
[1:29:48] and he had performed many miracles they
[1:29:50] were down at the end of the road
[1:29:52] and had taken the hand of god and as i
[1:29:54] said this afternoon in the service
[1:29:56] how god loves to get oh no no no please
[1:29:59] lord
[1:30:00] that's right he loves to get his people
[1:30:04] just in that condition oh my
[1:30:07] you know that's like who wants to pray
[1:30:09] for patience you know the whole church
[1:30:11] sits on their hands
[1:30:14] don't worry he'll give you patience
[1:30:15] anyhow whether you pray for it or not
[1:30:18] right amen so whether we
[1:30:21] we volunteer and say lord yeah whatever
[1:30:23] you want thy will be done lord it don't
[1:30:24] matter my brother and sister god loves
[1:30:26] to get you in that condition
[1:30:28] and shows you he can just show them his
[1:30:30] power
[1:30:31] and his love but did you know the
[1:30:33] rejecters say if god lets that happen
[1:30:36] in your life that god doesn't love you
[1:30:39] but god says i do love you
[1:30:42] amen i heard a man speak the other day
[1:30:47] or wrote a book
[1:30:48] a famous man i would not call his name
[1:30:51] because he ridiculed me
[1:30:54] that's it won't face up to the ridicule
[1:30:58] well let's read a little line a little
[1:31:00] further
[1:31:01] there's no need of disgracing him
[1:31:07] he said he didn't believe me well that's
[1:31:09] all right i didn't ask him to believe me
[1:31:11] and i asked him to believe the lord
[1:31:13] and he said here's one reason said i
[1:31:16] have never seen william branham but i
[1:31:18] know he's false
[1:31:20] why there's a lot of them around aren't
[1:31:21] there well now that would be a pretty
[1:31:23] bad testimony the law would be
[1:31:25] produced something better from that they
[1:31:27] didn't judge a man until they heard him
[1:31:29] so yet he said i had a man come to me
[1:31:32] and say i want you to pray for me dr
[1:31:34] so-and-so
[1:31:34] i have a kidney trouble he said now how
[1:31:38] long have you been bothered by it said
[1:31:40] 30 years altogether
[1:31:43] but i was healed for two years and it
[1:31:45] come back on me again
[1:31:47] and the man said well what doctor did
[1:31:49] you go to
[1:31:54] said well in louisville kentucky a
[1:31:57] fellow by the name of brother branham
[1:31:58] was praying for the sick
[1:32:00] and the man never and the man never seen
[1:32:03] me in his life
[1:32:05] but he looked up in the balcony and told
[1:32:07] me who i was
[1:32:08] and told me i'd been suffering with this
[1:32:10] kidney trouble for many years
[1:32:12] but he said i was healed well the doctor
[1:32:14] of divinity said
[1:32:16] were you healed two years i never had
[1:32:19] one sign of it
[1:32:21] but it come back on me again
[1:32:26] now i want to interject this because i
[1:32:29] believe it was
[1:32:30] providence of god that sister jerry
[1:32:34] wanted to read something to me
[1:32:38] and she i might because i didn't
[1:32:40] actually read it myself she recounted it
[1:32:42] to me i might not get the words exactly
[1:32:43] right
[1:32:45] but brother branham talking about how
[1:32:47] anyone can get healed
[1:32:50] but if you want if you're an unbeliever
[1:32:53] and you get healed if you want to keep
[1:32:56] your healing
[1:32:57] you need to serve god
[1:33:01] now i want you to keep that in mind the
[1:33:02] prophet's words on that
[1:33:04] right god's just given you might say
[1:33:07] divine favor
[1:33:09] and gave healing to a person who doesn't
[1:33:12] even serve him
[1:33:15] but the prophet says if you want to keep
[1:33:16] that healing amen
[1:33:18] you need to serve him you need to give
[1:33:20] your life to him now take that
[1:33:22] thought in mind right here two years i
[1:33:24] never had one sign of it
[1:33:26] but it came back on me again
[1:33:30] he said therefore you see william
[1:33:32] branham is false
[1:33:34] i called him up long distance and i said
[1:33:36] sir i want to ask you something
[1:33:38] if a man had pneumonia tonight and the
[1:33:40] doctors
[1:33:41] uh come and could give him no hope give
[1:33:44] him some penicillin tomorrow he comes
[1:33:45] back and finds out
[1:33:46] he is well on his road to recovery in
[1:33:49] two or three days from now the man has
[1:33:51] passed a physical
[1:33:52] examination that says he's perfectly
[1:33:54] normal no symptoms all
[1:33:56] he goes out and works for two years
[1:33:59] again takes pneumonia and dies
[1:34:03] was the man healed at the first place
[1:34:10] the simple reality of it is that man
[1:34:13] went two years
[1:34:15] with a kidney problem that god healed
[1:34:18] him from
[1:34:19] but you see he didn't find
[1:34:22] complete deliverance because
[1:34:26] it's not just about healing
[1:34:30] are you with me it's not just about
[1:34:32] healing
[1:34:33] now let me hurry up and finish this he
[1:34:36] said
[1:34:36] you can't do that uh oh you you don't
[1:34:40] class divine healing
[1:34:41] where you get your mistake you try to
[1:34:43] put divine healing on the same basis as
[1:34:45] salvation you can't do that because when
[1:34:47] you're born again you're forever a new
[1:34:48] creature
[1:34:49] you become absolutely born again a new
[1:34:51] creature but when you're healed you're
[1:34:53] not
[1:34:53] a new body but the holy spirit living in
[1:34:56] here the old covenant providing divine
[1:34:58] healing
[1:34:59] and we have a better covenant and divine
[1:35:01] healing was included or provided in the
[1:35:03] atonement so i said of course
[1:35:04] lazarus was raised from the dead and
[1:35:06] died again
[1:35:08] but divine healing is one of the
[1:35:10] benefits that we enjoy
[1:35:12] by being christians amen
[1:35:15] now in the proverbs here the scripture
[1:35:17] says to enjoy all of god's benefits
[1:35:20] amen david said now forget not all his
[1:35:24] benefits
[1:35:25] who forgives all thine iniquity whose
[1:35:28] heals all thy diseases
[1:35:29] it's the benefits that we draw from god
[1:35:32] by being
[1:35:33] a believer amen and as joshua crossing
[1:35:37] over he heard the voice of god that told
[1:35:39] him to get everything ready in order
[1:35:41] and he would cross over jordan he was a
[1:35:43] witness he wasn't afraid
[1:35:45] he sanctified the people see as a pastor
[1:35:48] joshua was doing exactly what he was
[1:35:50] supposed to do
[1:35:51] he didn't say i don't want to offend
[1:35:52] anybody but he said about
[1:35:54] sanctifying israel that knowing without
[1:35:57] that sanctification
[1:35:59] then the promise would be void when it
[1:36:01] come to the crossing of jordan
[1:36:04] so he set about to do that because he
[1:36:05] knew that was right
[1:36:07] he wasn't afraid he sanctified the
[1:36:08] people and had them wash their clothes
[1:36:10] get ready and the priest stepped into
[1:36:12] the water
[1:36:13] got wet feet but before they got to the
[1:36:15] middle of the jordan
[1:36:17] it was all dried away they were
[1:36:18] witnesses that god
[1:36:20] would keep his word amen they stipped it
[1:36:23] stepped in with wet feet and walked 20
[1:36:25] yards and had dry feet in the middle of
[1:36:26] the ocean or in the
[1:36:27] middle of the dead or red or jordan i'm
[1:36:30] glad to hear brother branham stumble
[1:36:31] like that because it makes me feel
[1:36:32] better about myself
[1:36:34] amen amen twice oh that's god
[1:36:38] god keeps his promise just be a witness
[1:36:41] step in don't be afraid
[1:36:44] joshua never heard of anything like that
[1:36:47] a scientist told me one day
[1:36:48] same man that there was proven in the
[1:36:51] solar system that a certain star
[1:36:53] passed over a certain star and it caused
[1:36:55] a great wind
[1:36:56] to blow back the river i love this
[1:37:01] brother bran i'm speaking now very
[1:37:04] strange
[1:37:06] two stars cross and a wind comes
[1:37:10] blows the river back but i believe it
[1:37:13] might be true if it can be
[1:37:14] scientifically proved
[1:37:17] but god moved the stars over
[1:37:20] i love how he brings that around right
[1:37:22] our mind would be like two stars
[1:37:23] crossing and a wind blow the water back
[1:37:25] that's nonsense
[1:37:26] but if god crossed the two stars
[1:37:31] amen how he does it that's up to him
[1:37:35] just so he does it how can he do it it's
[1:37:37] not my question to it's not my business
[1:37:40] it's not me to try or you to try to
[1:37:43] question
[1:37:43] it's except what he said you can't prove
[1:37:47] it
[1:37:47] you can't prove god but there's lots of
[1:37:50] things i can't prove
[1:37:52] i accept it anyhow because we see it
[1:37:55] working
[1:37:56] and he's a witness sister amy would you
[1:37:58] come
[1:37:59] hallelujah my god can do anything
[1:38:03] amen he might beat a cross in a couple
[1:38:06] stars
[1:38:07] causing a wind to blow it doesn't matter
[1:38:09] my brother and sister it would have took
[1:38:11] god to make that happen
[1:38:12] or else those two stars would have
[1:38:14] surely crossed again
[1:38:22] hallelujah but we have a promise
[1:38:28] and god's here and he can make it come
[1:38:30] to pass
[1:38:32] he is making it come to pass
[1:38:35] hallelujah hallelujah brother jay help

[1:40:11] want worldly fame if i could still i
[1:40:15] wouldn't take

[1:41:15] hallelujah this is a tough journey
[1:41:18] joshua my brother and sister had to be
[1:41:21] fully prepared
[1:41:23] because while he had a promise that god
[1:41:25] would send them
[1:41:27] into the promised land
[1:41:31] he also knew that the fulfilling of that
[1:41:33] promise meant
[1:41:35] a battle a battle a battle a battle
[1:41:38] a battle a battle a battle a battle a
[1:41:41] battle a battle a battle of battle
[1:41:42] that the promise to israel they still

[1:42:06] it to
[1:42:07] they'll pray for everything and i'll
[1:42:10] give it to them
[1:42:13] because it's my wife it's my bride and i
[1:42:16] know
[1:42:17] that i can give her half of the kingdom
[1:42:19] and she's going to say thank you lord
[1:42:22] but never actually try to possess it
[1:42:25] in a carnal fashion she'll always
[1:42:28] possess it
[1:42:29] in the spiritual oh isn't that beautiful
[1:42:33] isn't that beautiful you realize saints
[1:42:35] god honors those promises so strongly
[1:42:38] that's why the world out here
[1:42:39] christendom out here are driving nice
[1:42:42] cars living in big houses
[1:42:44] and then they say god gave this to me
[1:42:47] but you see the bride has another
