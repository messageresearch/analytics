into my heart and have your way [Music] no it's not number eight I'm sorry I don't have that one I couldn't find it we know it well enough sing it your word into our heart and have your way oh have your way thank you Lord thank you and have your way [Music] speak your words how many would receive it if he did speak to you personally and individually this morning only a few hands [Music] I say we all ought to have our hands up if he speaks to me I'd want to answer wouldn't you wouldn't you want to move you know what the prophet said we ought to move on the spirit of the moment when he speaks it's time to move not become dilatory amen I don't mean to come out so strong but that's true where have we come to in this Sovereign what's this message come to do you not know that the message is set for you're going home do you know the only way you're going to make it home in a Rapture is this message becomes a revelation to your heart [Music] that's how important it is we ought to be feeding on the book then I think God is saying to us this morning consider your ways consider your ways we can't play with this anymore here realized today could be the day of the resurrection and you're left behind what about that [Music] do you know that he's already began his coming and you know it's going to be consummated in a meeting in the air where are we standing today I say again this message was sent for your going home we ought to be feeding on this open book because it if you're really seeking him if you have a desire for him then I say give yourself to that desire because he's given you a filter to draw through and you're going to draw through that field or life to Quicken that seed on the inside of you to manifest Jesus Christ and that's what you're here for bride you're here to manifest Jesus Christ in this hour that we ought to consider our ways what's hindering you what's stopping you from taking your full position coming to where you belong in this hour and this time what fear is there that would keep you from just drawing nigh to him not moving away from but drawing nigh to him he said he would draw an eye to you do you realize that he is the message of the hour foreign I would think that's very obvious he's already unveiled himself showing you and Vindicated himself perfectly that it's the son of man himself being revealed in this hour what an hour we're in but you know what there is a bride that has an ear to hear and she will respond to this word she will answer she will quickly answer and respond why because she loves him and why because he first loved her amen I don't mean to come on so strong but I think it I just feel very moved this morning [Music] when we asked the question and he asks a question how many would move if he spoke to you this morning and would answer and do it and move quickly think of it brother sister where are we at where are you individually standing let's have a word of Prayer our heavenly father I'm quivering and shaking on the inside realizing that we're in the very presence of the king of kings what that ought to do is where to us Lord we are not we had not come here by chance this morning we've come here to see you to worship you to draw from you and to walk away here with a race to a higher plane walking closer to you there's a bride today that's walking with you Lord there's a bride today walking with you in her there's a close communion taking place between a bride and yourself [Music] Lord help us if there's anything in our life that would keep us out of our ordained position that you called us to take away the fear and quickly quickly Lord move upon these hearts that you've ordained to life and knowing that not one will be left to us behind then I say Lord to those that have that desire draw let that desire draw on the word of the hour and the time we ask you to bless your word now and then Lord I must I'm your servant I know that in myself there's not one good thing I cannot at all possibly be able to minister a word in season that would be for these people only you can do that and I'm not having confidence in this flesh because it's nothing I am confident in you that you will bring the word as you've ordained it this day here in this assembly of these people to feed your bride I'm nothing and I pray this Lord that you unveiled me from their sight and unveil yourself to their hearts and Lord May the revelation of the word stand in this hour Lord because there is individuals in this Earth today that is that revelation of yourself those are they that you're taking out of here we're on the March Lord I just say if anybody's got on a step of the word here in this assembly may they get back and step quickly and just be able to sell out everything and abandon themselves completely to what you've moved on their heart to do then Lord help them to consider their ways the house of God's got to be built and Lord every mineral every part every member of that body has a position in Ministry to minister their portion as you've given it to them that portion of yourself that little spoonful of yourself help us Lord to realize where we're at make your will known today I pray and reveal yourself we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ and For Your Glory amen amen God bless you babies see the musicians appreciated what was ministered through brother Tim this morning and the songs you may be seated it's absolutely perfectly with the message this morning the god laid in our heart I'd like you to turn with me to to the to Exodus 25 I want to title this sermon this morning you the complete revelation of the whole thing you the complete revelation of the whole thing those are not my words that's a direct quote amen and I will come to that but I want to take that as a as the title of the sermon you the complete revelation of the whole thing my subject is this unveiled Treasure of God this unveiled Treasure of God she is the words in the book what book you say the book of redemption a little book held in the hand of the Angel The Mighty angel of Revelations 2 10 2 you are the words in the book other words you're the message of that book amen you are the words in the book now I'm not saying that's another quote but I just titled that I want to bring that to you because we'll come to it in a few minutes you are she is the words in the book to be a word it had to be first a thought Amen to be a word it had to be first a thought because a word is a thought expressed amen the word complete before I read my scripture I'm coming to it the word complete means finished ended concluded it also means perfect amen amen if you'll stand with me turn to Exodus 25 with me verse 31 and then I want to go to Isaiah 60. and then I have one more scripture before we move on here Isaiah our Exodus 25 31 and thou shall make a Candlestick of pure gold now we know what the Candlestick represents seven Church ages amen and what's in that seven Church ages and who's standing in the midst of it clothed as a bride he said where'd you get that from Prophet said so we see the sun we see one as the son of man clothed with perhaps gird about the golden girdle but thou shall make a Candlestick a pure notice it's pure gold and notice of beaten work it's a beaten work what was the gold have to be beat for so he could see his reflect his reflection in it is that right it was beaten work and so the character of of what was in that gold that the dross had to be taken out so that the character could Shum and shine forth amen all right so and El beaten gold shall the Candlestick be made notice his shaft his and his branches his Bulls his knobs and his flowers shall be of the same all pure gold all right Isaiah chapter 60. and then I want to follow up with second Corinthians 4. and this Isaiah 60 will tie in with second Corinthians 4 and I begin with the sixth verse there Isaiah 60 verse 1. arise he's speaking to someone here I wonder if you're one of them arise shine we sing that song rising up God is lighted in him is no Darkness is that right the message is that God is light and in him is no Darkness who's the light coming upon arise Shine for thy light personal identification individually thy light is come arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord which he would not share with anyone else but himself and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee notice this Candlestick is his work it's his achievement it's his Candlestick it's his bride second Corinthians chapter four and that could take a lot of the second Corinthians 4 which which we can follow up with here talking about beaten we could take after we're through here but you could read more of it and maybe refer to it you believe the bride has a Ministry well revelate or check second Corinthians 4 1 said seeing we have this ministry what is this ministry the unveiled Christ it speaks of it right here and second Corinthians 3. amen all right this ministry is the unveiled word it's an unveiled treasure you know treasure is something of Great Value we're talking about a treasure here all right so we sing We have this ministry as we've received Mercy we faint not how many has received Mercy every one of us ought to have our hands up here this morning we have received Mercy you know what you know what you're raising your hand means I surrender to the word you know it takes a whole it takes a spirit for you to raise your hand yeah all right now let's go to verse six let's take verse 5 with this we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord we are not here on this Earth the preach ourselves brother sister we are not here to do that we are here to preach Christ the unveiled revealed word in you the message of the hour all right ourselves your servants to serve you the message of the hour right ourselves your servants for Jesus sake now watch this sixth verse you talk about a birth you watch the sixth verse here's the new birth here for God who commanded the light who is it who we're speaking of Elohim the self-existent one the Eternal one eternal spirit are you right there's only one form of eternal life that's God all right then here he said for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ what's the face mean the person in the person of Jesus Christ what is the new birth it's Jesus Christ revealed in you personally amen it takes the work of God to do that and it takes the seed of God in your soul to be quickened or there is no birth you can be anointed in your spirit brother Branham after the seals he got the he got the soul the spirit before the seals he said coming from the inside see the spirit soul body but after the seals it was Soul Spirit body why after the seals because the book became a brand new book it opened up the word would discern between the spirit and the soul between who you are and who you're not amen that seed had to be quickened it takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost to Quicken that seed and they're all and they're in the ground both seeds are in the ground as we had heard last Sunday they're in the ground but one is wheat and the other is wild wheat they both very similar but they can't produce the same fruit are you with me they will never only one can produce Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever the other cannot because it's not of him it was not his thought to begin with so you'd have the baptism on your spirit and still not have that ultimate of the word seed in your soul right that's right you go back and see what the prophet said it's your soul that came predestinence that seed that came predestinated eternally from God it was the thought and thought was made word and the Word was seed if you wanted him to begin with you're not a part of the word amen that's the bottom line that's why you respond to the word for the season because you're a part of that word for That season amen I know it sounds like I'm upset but you know me I you know what I'm like here I can only preach how God made me to preach amen so amen that's that that's the truth all right I'm nothing don't look at me look at him judge it by what you hear amen hearing from the word okay so we look here back again for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shine let me put in your heart predestinated seed in your heart to give the light of what the Revelation the knowledge of the what's something something's opening here something's on being unveiled here to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the person of Jesus Christ who are you meeting in you himself you come to a face-to-face meeting the Revelation in you now notice your light has come you may be seated the Revelation in you is the substance the revelation of the word in you is the substance the Eternal thought attribute that God had of you of himself let me read that again the Revelation faith is a revelation the Revelation Faith Revelation is the substance of things hoped for whatever the word promised you Revelation gives you the substance of it and the evidence of that which is not seen right you ever see it manifested but you have it and you know you have it because Revelation is not an imagination it's not a hope so it is a no so okay so the Revelation is in you oh who's what is the Revelation in you the word Christ the word Jesus Christ the word the Revelation in you is the substance it's the Eternal thought attribute because the attribute is God's thought he had attribute is that right that's God's thought of himself a being manifested declared tangible so the the Revelation in you is the substance Eternal thought attribute that God had of you of himself and we can find that well I'm referring you know what I'm referring to I just said Hebrews 11 1 for your body for and it's a it's the attribute the thought attribute that God had of you of himself the substance of your body change and the meeting of your bridegroom in the air as promised that's the earnest of it what is this Holy Spirit in you it is his Seed Faith all right Hallelujah brother what was what was Abraham's seed it was a face seed bro the prophet said Faith seed what's this faith in you that's been opened up it's himself it's his faith not yours it's his faith then then we begin to see this message brought us to our positive position which is our Victory because our Victory is our faith amen whose Faith his faith what's his faith it's our faith I'm talking about the bride's faith the bride's going to see this and it's only going to be known in her alone I don't know who she is but it'll be known individually by you because God will vindicate that to you himself personally you can't explain it you can't give it to somebody else it takes revelation you can't give revelation but you can impart life to Believers how through the word amen all right let's go to first John 4 19. see when we come back to that word being expressed we come to John 1 1 and 2. don't we in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was with God yeah are you with me and the same was with God what was with God what was with God let's look at the in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God what's the word the thought expressed okay the same was in the beginning with God what was the same in the beginning with God the word what was it his thought expressed then he himself became Melchizedek yeah is that right a word body yeah we didn't come to that but when he became Melchizedek I was in him Hallelujah I was in him now we can just take a long time I I had a lot of quotes on that on who is this Melchizedek about the thought becoming word you bypassed that theophany but you became in him when he met Abraham and you were in him when he met him at the tent amen because there was a man with Elohim represented through a man eating the Flesh of a cow and drinking the milk amen what God what God was as Melchizedek finally become flesh in his son Jesus Christ is that right and now at the end time he still speaks to us through his son I may know that Hebrews 1 what is it he'd have to come in the form of a prophet again with a perfect interpretation of the word and we saw God Among Us through a Ministry through a prophet now where do we see God that word had that message had to go somewhere where'd it go it was said to someone where is it Hallelujah amen all right so we see here that John 1 1 is true now this is where we're identified how are we identified by knowing him we don't know him as an imagination of thought we know him as a person to know him is to know the person of Christ so in first first John 4 19. very familiar scripture we love him because he first loved us then with that thought in mind you say I love him I know I love him I'm certain that I have his love then he loved you before the world began then if he loved you then he knew you now let's go over to first let's go over to Saint John chapter 10 verse 14. I am the Good Shepherd and I know my sheep when did he know you before the world began if he could love me before the world began and I love him by that love then did not he know me as the reason I know him hallelujah how can I know him if he had known me first how could I choose him if he hadn't chosen me first yet he gave me a choice didn't he but you were what I couldn't have chosen him except he had already chosen me but he gave me a choice of choosing to prove his choice Hallelujah hope you got that all right so I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine they know me I knew them I knew them there's a reason they know me all right verse 15 16 and other sheep I or 15. and as the father knoweth me even so know I the father then in that day you shall know that I'm in the father father me and I in you and you and me then you know who you are people where's the bride today she knows who she is and it's this Revelation that's taking her to a body change amen the Rapture has already begun within you it's already progressed it's already started it's their unfolding itself right into a body change what are we walking with in the step of this perfect interpretation of his word by Divine vindication we have that brother sister if you knew we'd have it you'd be running to this message because this message is the thing that brings life this is the eternal what you see is not Eternal it's temporal but what is not seen is eternal I'm talking about these eyes you don't you what you while we look not at the things which are seen but the things that are not seen for the things we look at that are seen are temporal but the things that are not seen are what Eternal and the Eternal is the real the Eternal is the true substance amen amen amen all right so we we know we realize that he knew us now let's go back to what the prophet said the church AIDS book about where I referred he loved Jacob how Jacob was before he'd done Jacob resaw done any works of of any good or bad Works he loved Jacob see it's not of your doing it's his doing Satan wants to twist you around on your failures and your faults and your mistakes and say see you did this you did that I can turn right back to it instead of according to the word I never did it I have the blood I'm under the blood I have the blood I have the identification of the blood applied in me I can point you back to what the scripture said and have the authority of that life in that blood and the Seal of God for where the Seal of God is God is you can't have the Seal of a king without the king being there you can't have the Seal of God without God being here so where is he he says in his word then where is the word Hallelujah then I point right back and point back to a finished work of Calvary the seal denotes a fittest work the sealed denotes who I'm owned by the seal denotes my destination it's finished Brian it's finished just lay in the presence of the son of the revealed word of the message of the hour which is the revelations 10 which is the Seven Seals and lay in that presence of that open book start feeding consider your ways start feeding and growing lay in the presence of the sun to ripen when that last one recognizes and realizes who she is and what she is it will take the body change that could happen very quick I'm warning you by the presence of the Lord Jesus that is very soon to happen I mean very soon I know that you say how do you know that because I see the level the bride's coming up to yeah amen she's right at the level of maturity she's she she's realizing she's one with her head she's one she has what is her what is what is her what is her outcome she's the queen of the king she has her place in his throne she's a part of his headship Hallelujah do you realize what this revelation of this message is doing amen all right so concerning Jacob brother Brown says see Jacob it was the thought what comes predestinated eternally from God brother Branham asks the question it's not the person it's not David it's the seed it's the thought of God when you realize that you're the summary substance of himself and realize that that substance is existing and always was existent in God you will get a great distance in your own in your own living with God because this in itself is the very thing that that that becomes alive to you and to realize you always were eternal life I'm talking about the real you I'm talking about you that was in him you that was his thought who expressed in the word and he expressed you today in a word he said let there be and here you are glory to God that's exactly what had happened how did he do that because his word Came To His prophets and they expressed the very thought of God for the season and you're we're in that word and you had to be spoken into manifestation brother Brown said that's how his children are born did you know that because they are a spoken word creation I just said right there this God who spoke the light in the darkness has expressed himself in you given to give the knowledge of who you are to give the knowledge of this birth to show you that you're the new birth you are the seed you are the thought just like Jacob he knew Jacob he knew him he loved him before the world began where is those Jacobs out here this morning where is those true ones that have had a name change amen that showed we have Victory we are his victory the bride is his victory the brightest is very blood because the blood contains and holds the life so she is his life manifested amen amen which is light amen amen amen and he said and ye are the light then you and the light become one rise Shine for thy light has come then you and the messenger one you are the words you are the Revelation in the book the little book amen amen you say why is a little book because it's contained as another record in the Book of Life it's the eternal life record of himself that's exactly right and who's this book open to her the bride alone this Secret can only be known by her alone The Secret of his coming is only known by her alone because she's here to glorify and manifest that very thing see it come in such Simplicity that goes beyond the theologians beyond the message theologians beyond the rest of the theologians it comes down to an individual and you are holding that very revelation Hallelujah amen I'm going to come to if the Lord Lobby I'll come to the very evidence of the Holy Ghost when you have a Divine perfect evidence whether you have the Holy Ghost or not think of that all right now let's look at this a minute just starting all right Daniel let's go to to Daniel and I I'm just gonna I cover those pretty quick but you can go back in the church age book and find out he said Jacob alone had the seed not Esau even though they came out of Godly Parents but Jacob alone had the seed that was God's choosing that was God's achievement that wasn't Jacob's achievement that was God recognizing himself right Jacob was a shyster but God didn't look him at it as a shyster he saw him as wanting that Birthright there was something in him that desired that Birthright and God gave him a God gave him a a a a filter to to draw through you're gonna have to come through the word if you're gonna have a word birth you've got to come through the blood you've got to come through the blood of the blood is the light word for the season right now you are hearing the message preach you are hearing the blood the blood is being preached right here before you right amen that's exactly right if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have what do we have we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin then you're hearing light this morning you're receiving light you're hearing the message of the hour preached this morning I'm not it hasn't been preached I'm just saying here this morning that's what's happening right that's what's happening with these word ministers they're bringing the light to the season and the bride's going to respond to that light that's all there is to it I can't make him respond I don't have to make him respond it doesn't matter to me how you respond right it doesn't matter to me how you respond to it God will see to it that the light picks up the seed the light was sent to the seed the only one that can have a new birth is those elected because in the rest of them there's nothing to Quicken they can have the anointing they can shout they can dance have every outward expression even have the gifts of Saint or First Corinthians 12. and still not have the word inside of them because the gifts are nothing but just the manifestation of the spirits among you but without that word said those are no evidence that's no evidence that the Holy Ghost dwells in your soul having those gifts because they're going to work among the people and it's the Holy Spirit doing it but without that word the evidence lays in the revelation of the word and the ability to be able to hear the word for the season it will be revealed to you Hallelujah they have an ear to hear you can't keep that bright from knowing your husband because she always was part of her husband and when the husband was expressed as the message of the hour she's got to be expressed too yeah I'm just going to jump ahead just a bit here the same word that spoke of the groom this is a direct quote right out of I think it's a uh the seals third seal I believe but I've got it written I've got it here the same word that spoke of the groom spoke speaks of the Bride because they're not separated she was the very she was the very she's she is his eternal thought of himself you think that can fail and it's ordained to be in its season in its decreed season you being that thought have to come to life in that season to manifest himself amen I've got all this backed up I don't know how much I'm going to get of it but I'm just going to say it anyway because it's every bit the message all right now so we know then that that was there in that thought of Jacob because Jacob alone was seed if you are true seed you will he said hear that word there it is just this simple if you are true seed you will hear that word and God will have is obligated to make sure you hear it correctly yeah yeah you're not going to be deceived because Jesus Christ can't be deceived you may get off the line a little bit off the track but he's got him obligated to bring that word back online you'll never get offline you're always hid to begin with and nobody else can have you amen you let that become a revelation to you personally one time and see what happens to you you're a totally changed man person all right then the true evidence becomes and he said you will hear that seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age he said see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you you will you will receive the full revelation of God and from God for that day here's your evidence and when what's the Revelation to do a true revelation will be Vindicated by the word it'll be backed up by the word to you personally it's not a whim it's not an idea it's God unveiling himself to you personally individually this is an individual Affair not a group affair amen this is an individual affair you can get it no one else can get it I can get it the one set and to be missing that doesn't mean anything that just exalts Jesus Christ and his promised word of election though that election might stand Jacob I loved Esau I hated so elections got to stand he knows his own he knows his own people amen is that right the foundation of God stand assure having the seal the Lord knoweth them that are his amen amen there you are that ought to give you enough Assurance right there when you see the word opened up in you God has taken the seals off of your life and has opened up himself in you there's your treasure I didn't even read oh I I didn't even finish let's go back here to Second Corinthians I didn't hit the most point here but now's the time to hit it so we read verse six did we not second Corinthians 4 6 let's read verse 7. but we have this treasure what's this treasure I've been preaching it here this morning this unveiled major word of himself in you personally Vindicated in you personally himself personally Vindicated to you she sees it you see it okay he said he said but we have this treasure from verse 6 as treasure this ministry this unveiled word this gospel we have this treasure in Earthen vessels no good vessels Earthen vessels dying vessels hello corrupt there's not a there's there's not a sound boat in David in David there isn't that soul of mine though let's see so I have no confidence in the flesh in the carnal man because my carnal mind is enmity to God what's an enmity mean it's an enemy against him who's controlling him the word the words bringing him under Authority the word the word that's been quickened in me amen if the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ the anointed word where in you what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is I'm living in a resurrection I pass from Death to life and because I have that as substance I've got to be a part of that Resurrection because I realized I was in his thought and his thought became word and I was in Melchizedek I've already heard from my theophany because when the word was spoken today I received it I was able to hear it I've already received my theophy I've already heard from it then I've got to come to it I'm already identified to be there talk about arrest talk about arrest talk about a seal look at the authorities been given to you bride through the word not to use loosely frivolously but as he directs You by faith he's the sovereign you're his wife amen are you are you with me you always were a part of him then because of that you have his mind second are Philippians 2 5 and 6 let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus who be in the form or a morphe of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God I'll come to that in just a minute Lord willing much of this I'm just going to have to speak out I have the message in my heart I like to back it up with what he said but you can search out what he said we're far enough down the line you ought to be feeding on this word you don't ought to be not scratching your head and wondering what in the world is being said you need to get in this word if there's any movement of God in you at all I I say to you by the grace and mercy of God get in this word start realizing where you're at start feeding lay aside these other things get rid of all this stuff that wants to hinder you your jobs and your this and your money and your jobs and this and that consider your ways you go to your own ways you go you put your foot on the Sabbath you do your own things on the Sabbath day our Sabbath day is rest our rest is the Holy Ghost himself God said I can't even bless you because of that but because you're wanting to do your own thing you're wanting to do your own way you're trying to mix those two things together and it can't be mixed God's word will not be mixed with your own self it's either the word or nothing either the words you're absolute or you're your absolute and if you or your absolute you've lifted up as an idol there's only one Idol you serve and that's not a dead Idol that's a living Idol of the living presence of Jesus Christ in you and he makes you a living image of himself amen okay those are hard statements You Don't Preach so hard Brother David if I don't preach it hard you're not going home I've got to preach it this way well that offends us if it offends you I'm sorry I'm not here to offend anybody I'm here to bring the truth let the truth stand then either it's truth or it isn't it amen amen amen now my dear precious wife said take your handkerchief out and leave it on the pulpit you don't have to be reaching all the time into your suit pocket get it out now see I heard her voice and I know what she meant I'm leaving it right here thank you sweetie I had to remember that because it's necessary not always scratching down here reaching for something foreign I know it bothers me to have to Snuff all the time too and it goes on record okay now I may hear from that but anyway that's all right I just remembered and I'm thankful that I remembered at my age it's hard sometimes to remember so now that I've loosened you up let's go on let me read here what he said and about this Exodus 25 31. brother Brown seven golden candlesticks and he quotes that scripture and thou shall make a Candlestick a pure gold he reads the scripture I just read it to you let's go on what he said the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes remember the attributes is his thought her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what do you got to worry about what others think of you that's not your identity your identity is in him what greater identity could you have than him himself the King of Kings the Lord of lords the almighty the Everlasting one your Refuge your rock your strength your Revelation who is my revelation God is my revelation Shalom I can say to the church the bride shalom Christ in you is perfect contentment perfect shalom all right what is he what her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her underline that there is no fault in her now if you know to do good and doeth it not you need to repent is that right if you've done something that displeases him take a hold of blood and apply it right if you know that you're his you're his son you're his seed and manifest in flesh which makes you a son then just simply repent of it genuinely from your heart and take a hold of what God said there's no fault in her who's he looking at when he sees that he's not judging you by this outer man he's judging you by his revealed word amen himself Jesus Christ is the revelation of the word amen amen there you are all right now what he was what he has what he has she is to manifest so what he has is it on property but here she is to manifest what he has she is so what does that make us Christ in Bride form whoa Brother David now you're getting too deep no you're not going deep enough you don't start getting a little deep you're going to miss the rapture I'm not talking about deep in your intellects I'm talking about deeper in Revelation amen well I believe God said a prophet that won't put you in the rapture but the message revealed in you will amen that's right oh but we'll we have our own ways we'll do our own things I won't let you in that door of my personal life Lord just come in step inside the house just stand there don't go to meddling through these other doors of the house is that what you're saying to me or do you want him to go in every door every door and clean out every door there's something that's contrary to as well cleaned out Lord because there's one ambition I have become absolutely one with you amen and and we realize we're in the age of the marriage and that's a union okay yeah yeah and he actually did perform that when the seals were opened up the lamb performed it and he had a prophet perform the marriage it took the prophet to do that you know he said the first thing I did at the start of that message God in Simplicity 1963 the opening of those seals first thing I did was to perform a wedding and he did it in the back room kind of a little room you know set aside in the cathedral you'd have been around the message you know what I'm talking about unless you go back in that little room behind that Veil you gotta have blood to go back in there you've got to go in there yourself and if you go in there yourself you're going to come out totally changed I guarantee it because you met him face to face second Corinthians 3 6. face-to-face meeting with Christ himself that's what it takes because it was brought last Sunday you've got to come those three steps but notice the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself to come right down in Perfection again back to the word amen amen amen all right now so what he has she's to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without so settle Into Your Heart Right Now how God sees you and quit Looking Through The Eyes of others or your own self to see how and what you are from the beginning to the ending he that has begun a good work remember the Bible said he will finish it and he who calleth you Faithful Is He Who calleth you who also will do it right okay then he said from beginning to ending she's the work of her Lord she is Alpha also she's Omega how may know you've read that Masterpiece she is also Alpha and Omega and the reason she's she's brought to nothing today because there's no Beauty we desire her right she's despised rejected because she is the word also she is himself revealed in Bride form and who is this bride revealing the son of man again listen brother sister we're not doing anything away with real Pentecost real Pentecost started without a ending but Pentecostalism ended because ism is denominationalism organization Pentecost real Pentecost was life that doesn't end with that doesn't he brother Brown said it started without an ending it had to have a moment coming out of Eternity where it had to have its manifestation and that manifestation without ending are you with me but Pentecostalism come to an end because it denominated on tongues and manifestations of gifts they denominated on the very thing of shouting and feeling good when it's not in at all it was the word revealed in you which only God can do doing that to the word promise for the hour and when that comes in you it's going to live out but still you have people wanting to judge you by how how hard you scream and how hard you speak and how how how how how offending it is and everything can't be instead of by the word and the life you live let me see the let me see the music you listen to let me see the pictures you have in your wall let me see how much of this video and this nonsense you're looking at let me see what you're feeding on and I'll tell you what's in you because what's in you if it's a word has one Joy one pleasure has one thing that it rejoices in and that's the word for the hour let me see where you're feeding how many know the prophet even said that let me see what you look at let me see where you're feeding let me see what pictures you have on your wall let me see you're let me see your life every day when you make a mistake what are you going to do about it if you air somebody what are you going to do about it let me see the Holy Ghost in action is that right sure it's right you know it's right it brings conviction but conviction's good it's better than condemnation conviction's good when you know to do it then repent and make it right and go on say Lord I need you yeah it just only shows I need you I need more of you if you don't have the desire for more of him I wonder about your experience with Christ if you're not having any desire for this message I wonder about your experience in Christ if there's no desire to feed on the word and only your desires to have more of the world if you love the world the things of the world the love of God which I just spoke of is not even in you amen that's right all right so notice I related to that having the mind of Christ God's become in morphe in a form and he's here in the form today in Bride form did anybody ever hear Prophet say that on the message invisible Union it's Jesus Christ it's Jesus again in Bride form the same Jesus now without a revelation of who he is you'll miss it a million miles but when you realize that he's the word let me just go back here do you realize that that the same God let me look at this just a moment God in morphe mask in a pillar of fire now let's just back up here a minute the bride form and that's what the Bible has been it's been a work of God that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and its Sevenfold mystery we'll come to that in just a minute and it's Sevenfold mystery and God promised in this day at the end of the laodicean age he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it so it's been a hidden Mystery but now unveiled and we hold this in Earthen vessels why because so the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of David David can't produce that it's not of the man it's of the word himself revealed in you this is what sets the bride apart from the tribulation Saints right there because they that were ready had the birth had the birth of the word came through their Pentecost they that were ready was entered was ready to enter into the message of the hour of Revelation 10. and when they entered into that message what happened they entered into marriage with him Matthew 25 10. and they that were ready only she was ready he said I don't disagree with that that's fine if you disagree that's fine I'm not asking you to stand up and disagree with everything I say but if you disagree I ask you one thing go search it out right amen they that were ready went in because the med the Messi The Voice already went out the bridegroom coming and all of the virgins rose up to meet him but some lacked oil no revelation no Holy Ghost no revelation oh they had the shout they had the feeling they had all these others they had the gifts amongst them everything else but they had no revelation but they that were ready went beyond they turned the corner and went into the bride age they went into the bride time they went into the seed time do you realize this is seed time back to the seed again back to the grain again do you rise who you are bride you're that grain made manifest in the bride form you're that grain in the formation of the Bride well you say he was the grade that's what I'm talking about that's her also and in order to fulfill scripture it had to go back to the type of Genesis 2. she came out of Adam she was the mystery of Adam revealed and Christ in you is the mystery of God revealed well that was a good one Christ in you is the mystery of God revealed that's what makes you the complete revelation and that is the message of Revelations 10. that is the message of Revelations 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the finished mystery of God would be finished the mystery of God would be finished completed what's the prophet trying to tell us here don't you see the formation of the word Back to Eden we're heading what where are we headed now right back to Eden as bride and bridegroom the prophet said it very clear and cry and if you haven't read Christ The Mystery of God revealed I would suggest you saturate yourself in it because he's preaching the seventh seal in that message his message is right there I mean it's not it's in all the rest of them too because I got several quotes but it ties everything ties together right under that threefold mystery amen of himself amen that's right now he said now under the unveiling of what's been opened up he said now I can say this The Head and the body had become one unit what is that for the bride it's maturity because brother Branham said What followed those mess what was hidden in that in that pyramid that stone was in there Unwritten word Unwritten what not out of the word not out of the Scripture it was in the scripture but it was Unwritten in Revelations 10. and that Unwritten word that mystery had to go somewhere and it had to be unveiled because he said this message unveils it how many believe the Seven Seals opened only just a few here all right believe it's opened well bless your hearts because I'll tell you what it is opened and it's unveiled who you are and where your sand is you have been positionally placed by that revelation do you realize that Brother Brad said it's so good to see ourselves positionally placed in what Christ which is what the mystery of God revealed the whole message he preached there was Christ The Mystery of God revealed what was he saying about you bride and the whole thing that you're the mystery completed and if that mystery is completed then it's ready for Redemption to the Earth it's got to come back to Eden again and the seventh day has got to be finished an Earth Day a seventh stage time for the Earth you did you come out of that you're now heading into the rapture you've got eternal life now working in you you've got Rapture in you what's it for to take you to a body change if this message had to come in this hour there's no way we would have a body change there is no way this would be fulfilled it took something it had to be revealed that hidden word those seven Thunders spoke of what those seals would make known it was a revelation contained in those seals that set the bride literally literally turned the heart of the Bride back to the original faith what was the original Faith Christ's own faith glory to God that's exactly right notice so from beginning then she's the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up you know what a sum is if you sum up something and you you find the completed thing well that's the cost it's completed here's the sum right here the completion it's the Finish in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God oh think of that where is that found in her right I'll make it even in you any hers here men or women it's her it's in her in you what was in him is now manifest in you so it's himself manifested Among Us brother Branham said it's the mystery of his coming all right and I'm not saying it's all all finished I'm saying but I'm saying this it's climax in our meeting in the air but he has come he appeared on Sunset Mountain just exactly what Acts chapter 1 verse 11 said he would and he said now brother Brad said I've introduced you to him I must decrease he must increase so where was he increasing in the bride they became one they are becoming one he's pouring himself into her and they are becoming one for the wedding supper she has the same Spirit he's God amen and that Spirit became word so we've already heard from our theophany haven't we because the because the the very listen you say well Brother David I believe I'm walking with God I do too I'm walking with God then you realize that your headship is a kingdom because the prophet said now we see the head and the body uniting they have United did you hear him say that in Christ the mystery God revealed he said the head and body have United as one amen they're no longer Twain he said they are one you've heard me quote that here many times they are one amen no longer Twain then who joined us together let no man put asunder amen are you with me all right I'm running over these things I know I'm going to run out of time I've got to I could take many many quotes showing you were the thought of God you are the expressed thought of God you are the Eternal thought of God and they're real and they're existing in his thoughts I could quote after quote I've already done it here I took a message not long ago on the very substance of faith that very substance right there that's who you are amen all right then then we could take that out to bypass that but I want there are some key things I want to get to so I have a little bit of time left not that we have any definite time to stop I could probably stop at three o'clock if I get by the pastor I say that smiling brother Paul no that's not my that's not my but you know it's possible I know it's possible that's the danger part because there's no stop to this you could just go on and on and on we just have to hit the high points I'm expecting you to find out what he said right if you don't have an interest in doing that then I'm sorry nothing will help you yeah that's the truth exactly the truth amen if you have no longing for him what are you in the message for if I I can say possibly you just made it a religion it's not a religion it's the literal life of G hent Jesus Christ Sunday in human vessels again just like Adam and Eve came out of Adam only this time there's no way to turn that bride out of Christ amen it's impossible for her to fail it's impossible or hard to fall because she's predestinated not to do it now think of that people say I can just live any way I want to yes and I challenge you to if you're a real believer otherwise you're a make-believer because I'll tell you right now you're not going to live just any way you want to with a real believer God will lead you to live the way you want to you'll have no desire to displease him how many preachers could say Amen this morning that's right it's a truth every member of the Bride ought to say that because they know that's right you have no desire to displease him and how you're going to please him by faith that you ought to be calling on God for Revelation more than anything else the emphasis is on Revelation amen the revelation of the word to you cannot be over emphasized the importance of it I don't get going I'm not going to get going all right now so we see the Promise in this day and age and we're seeing it because he's taken the bail off of it so what is he taking the veil off the mystery that was laying in your soul of himself he's taken the seals off of it off of your life and you can see now who you are and where you belong where you came from where you're going I mean excuse me where you came from and who you are and where you're going if you know where you came from you know who you are and if you know who you are then you know where you're going that's the whole message right there God becoming tangible and you know what he redeems only his thoughts I'll get to that in just a moment here so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ now you're getting into bride material you're getting into rapturing condition perfect faith that's out of the message perfect faith if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are we'd be a Mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what if forbid you would not do that's the way it is all believers are Mystic they don't understand because they live in a world to themselves okay themselves that's not selfish attitude they live in the world of the revealed word what they are to themselves amen amen amen that's the truth I'm not crazy it may appear to be and I know right where I'm standing and I say God keep revealing more the more I see of it the more I want the more I see it the more I want and What's That Drawing me What's That Drawing what's that what's that pulling what's that thing pulling me it's pulling right into that body change I'm gonna get so full of that I'm not going to appear anymore behind that pulpit right and the church may be closed before that happens and I maybe go to the dust where it happens but don't worry about me I'm in my theophany I'm not bragging I'm speaking the truth this is more than real to me more than what I can imagine this is a revelation I say Lord help us each one you think I'm standing up here wanting to condemn people no I'm not I'm trying to get the truth to you to set you free how can you be free unless you have the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free he who the son he who the son sets free then if you have the son you have life this is the record eternal life and he's given that to us therefore he that has eternal life has the son and the son has made you free do you believe that Jesus Christ has come down in this day spoken to us to a messenger and we're receiving the message and becoming one with that message then it's Jesus Christ among his friends not a man it's Jesus Christ Among Us veiled behind human skin in the form of his bride and more faith because this is the act that he would manifest himself as bride this is the bride act this is the bride age we turn the corner yes the bride's come out of laodicea she come out of dark denominationism this is the bride coming of Christ let me say it again you say I don't agree with that I don't care if you agree with it or not I'm going to say it this is the bride coming of Christ you want to know what he's coming this is what he's coming this is his doing right here this is what is a mystery to the majority I'm not saying because I know but I say to the majority of message followers does that make you anything it makes me one thing it makes me one thing I'm accepted by him and we are special people a special calling I could take you back to Deuteronomy and show you you know where I'm going we are special people especially his own bride amen we know that Paul knows that we know those quotes people say who do you think you are somebody special very we are his wife do you realize that God Eternal God he created creator of Heaven than Earth the author of life and The Giver of every good gift it has a bride and here she is right here attending here this morning hearing the word that he has been brought to us unveiled do you realize the treasure that you hold in your heart do you rise your position bride do you realize your position do you know a position is not your doing it's a place where someone is located or has been put who put you there put someone in a particular position particular place do you know the Bible says in First Corinthians 12 you are a member of Christ in particular amen that's right you are a member of the body United with Christ one with Christ amen you were baptized in that body and the brother Brown said that baptism what that baptism is that you were birthed into that body by the one Holy Spirit birth amen all right now excuse me I okay now let's go a little into the week we accept what we have but brought how can one fathom that is all in hers summed up the manifested the and subbed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one fathom it how can one in his intellects understand it though we cannot do it we accept it by Faith amen faith is a lot more real than my carnal understanding yes because my carnal understanding is not substance amen his faith is the very substance of his thought the thought in the word expressed is the substance I am that's what you are right God loves to tell you who you are and to them that receive it it's more than gold to them yeah more than life more you can take all the carnal life you take all the jobs you want take everything else I said Lord let me get in my ordained position and stay there I don't care how poor I get I don't care what I have to scratch about I don't care nothing else I want to be where you want me to be in the position you place me to be and I'm speaking of a position in the body as a as a as a as a manifestation in your portion the rest of it our manifestation is in the head our position is the headstone in the throne we are his Queen and thank God for every beating we've gotten thank God for every test thank God for every trial we could go back and and read further into second Corinthians 4 there and find out distressed and purged and put down and bearing about in our mortal body the dying of Jesus Christ every day that the life also of Christ might be made manifest it's a dying we take up our cross daily I appreciate that song and every song because it went just along with what was everything been here said we take up our cross follow him who you following who's your absolute yourself you've got a very poor absolute he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna build you up and hit you down you'll fret you'll worry and you'll Scream and Shout kick but your absolute the word it's finished if you have the seal showing your part of it you've already got the seal showing you're in the word already already was a part of me the new birth is Christ revealed in you you were existing in his thoughts yes sir what about those thoughts that are Eternal yes they are and him was attributes I want to get down to this God and morphe mask in a pillar of fire god and morphy and A Man Called Jesus God and morphy in his church God above us God With Us now it's God in us the condescending of God now it's God in us the Holy Spirit appearing in bodily form of the Bride his spiritual seed amen his spiritual seed do you realize there's a bride to raise up in this last day there's to be a royal bride to the Royal promised son do you realize she's the promised word to appear let me say it again do you realize she is the promised word to appear in this hour Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever what is that virgin birth of the Bride it's Jesus Christ amen all right you have no other identity your identification is in him and if your dedication is identification is him you ought to be the happiest person alive in this hour right because you're identified you're identified in him everything he is you are all that you are he is and all that you are he was and all that you are he is thank you he spoke a word and the Word was made manifest it's God becoming material god with his thoughts becoming material there you are that's Melchizedek and speaking of our theophany who is that Melchizedek same person it's the same person amen when he come down to the body form you were in him that's just what the prophet said right here okay now there's to be a spiritual bride rise up there's to be a royal bride to the Royal promised son as I spoke last night he's preaching this message on a on a message called this day this scripture is fulfilled how much plainer do you want it he said he's talking about a royal bride to the Royal promised son is to appear in this day laughs amen he said he would come again is that right and he'd be United he's you isn't that exactly John 14. now you may disagree with this but John 14 said he would have come again and received you unto himself this day these scriptures are being fulfilled this scripture what's he receiving you for and you comes again and receives you unto himself that's not all the Rapture we're looking out here this is happening right this is what the seals revealed was all about this is what the what the the picture of himself up there as he appeared exactly as he said he would in the scriptures in sunset Mountain sunset time End of Time end of time brother Brad said this is where he makes himself known and these Pentecostals trying to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and these other nominals he said don't you realize when they did that that was the time he come he said that most of that before the seals without the Seven Seals the rest of the message wouldn't have made any difference you ever thought of that unless we had the completion of the of the word we had we had we had serpent seed we had we had godhead right we had the baptism right we had eternal security we had those things all preached but without the opening of those Seven Seals you would never realize and understand his coming right you would miss it yeah amen that's exactly right and he's shown that sign into heaven brother Brown said that sign his picture take the picture of him who's ever turned the picture to the right do you see him he didn't even see that until 1965 almost two and a half years later think of that then he begins to say it's a rising of the Sun it's the rising of the sun it's a rising of the Sun looks like a bride but it's him but it's him who's uniting with his bride that's right that's right they are becoming one for the wedding supper a celebration of a spiritual union that what I'm saying to you this morning is kicked out at most churches in the message maybe not most a lot of them well yes it is the most because few there be that find it but it's not the message churches anyway you ever think of that it's not this church in that church I'm talking about the word being turned out it's not the church turning it out it's the word it's her she's very few and far between but they almost lock it out anyway don't they who's they other than bride the public locks it out amen is that right this isn't a public show this unveiled mystery we're talking about is not a public show brother Jesus said they asked when demanded of him when the kingdom should appear he said the kingdom of God is within you he said he said this and it cometh not with observation it's a hidden Mystery revealed it's a treasure unveiled it doesn't come with observation it's not public it's between me and my bride this is called the bride age amen this is called it's bride time bride time this is bride time she's to come on the scene it took the messages it took the seals it took everything the unveiling of the outside of the pyramid and the inside had to be unlocked amen are you with me all these things I mean look at what He restored look at look at Malachi 4 restoring everything back so that that message of what's on the inside hidden could come to manifestation and be perfect I'll let you study that out a lot to be said about that but I'll just back up here there is to be a spiritual bride she'll be a spiritual seed she's not a natural seed she'll be a spiritual bride raise up that will be the Royal seed of the royal faith of Abraham's royal son she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise that's given to her amen amen amen Hallelujah amen in Daniel 12 9 if you want to turn I'm going to close here real quick in Daniel 12 9 he said here and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end now that ties in right exactly with shut the book John seal it up don't write until the time of the end and the days of the seventh angel the mystery would be opened okay and he said now we see a perfect identification this message is absolutely correct pointing to the sign in the heavens at 1963. of himself he said this is a perfect identification a perfect Vindication this message is correct is the truth I got the quote if you want to read it that's exactly what he said all right now there's got to be somebody live the message amen amen and one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them all right now so in Daniel there we see on paragraph 524 of Christ the mystery now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but some now let me say that again so you don't miss it we see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming why was it back there he was redeeming wasn't he is that right back there he was redeeming but he stood as a mediator during those Seven Ages is that right but a Corner's been turned now watch he said when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday but someday he comes forth to get this book who took the book someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed brother man said what is the book it's the names of those he's redeemed all right he said in all that's in that book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book let me read it again for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in that he came forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world amen hallelujah now and he saw he spoke to me and said these Seven Seals this is on paragraph 12 rising of the Sun and so he spoke to me and said the Seven Seals will be opened the seven Mysteries Sevenfold mystery of the Bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed amen amen think of that okay and we at a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessings uh hearing these Mysteries and he refers to marriage divorce that was a total mystery until after the seals were open marriage divorce serpency we never got the full revelation of serpent seed until after the seals were open okay in fact a lot of fullness of what was what he brought up was little loose ends left amen watch and he said now he said and these and he completely revealed to us has been has been completely revealed to us not by man but by God himself that opened those seven Mysteries now watch what the seven Mysteries were open what were their opening for watch what he says of what the church was how it was in Christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in this last day why were the Seven Seals open for you to come to your perfect complete revelation of where you started who you are and where you're going all right now he said see and how it and he said how how it was and how it'd be real into us today the open book The open book open to whom and I said this is what I'm saying behind it the open book open to whom and where is it opened now that ought to have been already answered this morning in you he opened the seals that sealed your life and you have come face to face with him she is him you are him by what a why why what my what a treasure is revealed to his bride in her alone the secret is known to her alone this Secret it's still a secret to many but to the bride it's unveiled to her as She lays in that presence of that unveiling it becomes clearer and clearer matured more matured until we take the body changed what's the stature of it's the statue of him what are we going to himself what's the what's the Capstone of himself himself Who's Coming For You himself what's he coming to himself it's the word coming to word it's a word predestinated to the word for the hours written for the hour it's the word coming to word it's word on top of word on top of word word on top of word word on top of word manifestation and revelation of himself the complete you are the complete okay I think we're covering this pretty good and I'm going to start to give off here he tells about how has anybody really looked at the picture in the way it should be you see it's Christ can't the audience see that his eyes looking here is perfect as it can be it's Christ he didn't pull the body well it looks like Christ it's just a it's a it's a form of Christ he said it's Christ right don't add to it don't try to take and put your own thoughts like some of them I know have amen and make it something like it's just a form it's just this they don't realize what they're saying he's come for his people that's what his coming is about he's coming do you realize what the scripture said now we see the Promise being fulfilled do you realize what the prophet was saying when he said that we see the Promise coming being fulfilled do you realize that your headship is a kingdom and the kingdom of God is within you do you realize where your headship is your headship is the kingdom and the kingdom of God is within you the word made Spirit the word made Power in you you have nothing to fear I don't care what happens it's under it's under complete control by him you've given yourself you are his bride he's not going to allow you to go into Great Tribulation you realize that he's going to keep you out of that so how close are we we're right here we're right at the doors right here born at the door the door is already started the door's already opened you we're just stepping through it yeah yeah truly the door's been opened you just got to walk into it through it amen and when you come through it you come through a threshold you've come into a brand new day of another Reveille a new revelation amen and that right there is taking you fully into the fullness of his coming it's coming do you realize he's coming this is the Revelation right here you say they look at you like Brother David you lost your head no he's just doing what he said he would do but he kept it a mystery until he made it known to the bride who else is going to see it as she's becoming more vocal with it all the time and that's good because they're not afraid to stand up here I'm not ashamed to say that right you may not see it I pray that you will but I know people are and I know I have and I know their bride is amen okay just a couple more things and I'll close he said I've introduced you to him he said notice he's wearing the white wig of supreme deity the judge of all heavens and earth can't you see his eyes his note pretty descriptive isn't he can't you see his eyes his nose his mouth he said it looks just like he looked when I met him in the same spot right here right here at this High School there he is he said the angel told him like turn it to the right first it was The Headstone the mystery was in that right there what is that Unwritten word we'll turn the picture to the right who is it who are you bride where is this being revealed where's this mystery unfolding where is it do you realize what treasure you have it's beyond words it's beyond explanation you can't even fathom it mentally but it's real and it's more real than any feeling I have every day it gets more real and more real and more real he said Brother David where are you heading out of here where I'm heading out of here then lay in the word ask God to reveal it to you meet him if you haven't met him yet and you have the desire you can tell what's in your soul by the desire you have there then God's given you a filter to draw through then you need to be drawing through it and you'll draw life that'll manifest Jesus Christ personally personally he'll become personalized to you we said Brother David I have that desire I want that desire then let him become personalized becomes personalized to you then you and he are one it's not another person calling to you he's calling to you he's asking you do you love me then believe what I said how do you prove your love to him by believing what he said right quit adding your own ideas quit putting your own interpretation to it quit trying to do things through your own psychology and your mind take the word there's only one Deliverance of all cares and that's through the word nothing else there's not a book of psychology there's nothing else there's only one thing can deliver you of your cares and unless you can reach that Spirit realm all you want and have all kinds of emotion it'll never last there's only one thing that can release your cares release your burden and that's through the bird the bloody word I say this have you been identified as a our brother said last Sunday has his Spirit confirmed you to be his seed has his Spirit confirmed and recognized you to be his faith it takes that you know it takes a circumcision as a sign it takes the token don't you downplay the token if you don't have the token you're not going in a rapture that's just all there is to it it takes the token to show that you've come through the blood amen there you are all right I've introduced you to him and he he here we see him up here his dark face his beard his eyes his nose his mouth just turn it this way you've got to look at things the right way you're looking at them wrong all right just turn the picture he's Supreme judge there's none of them but him and that's a perfect identification a Vindication that this message is the truth that's his words this is the truth it is true it's not making him a third person but the only person and now he's in you same God above us same God With Us and the son same God in you then who are you he said I'll build my church upon this revelation of myself foreign to himself who are you amen what's the Holy Ghost news shows you are in his thinking alive in his thinking existing in his thinking and here you are in your decreed season manifesting him what a revelation of the treasure all right that same 1933 that same light he came right down in 33 he said as John the Baptist was sent the first for a run the first coming your message will forerun the second where is he in you in Bride form when he come before run brother Brown said seed that's spoken words Original Seed he said what is my purpose for being on Earth he said to forerun that coming word where is it you are that word made manifest in the formation of the Bride where is Jesus Christ today he's manifested in Bride form amen that's the truth they are the same word they are they are one same word brother Brown said he said this Union would make her and the son of man absolutely the same person she is the same self person he said he's no longer he said as he was he as he was embodied in Jesus Christ he said that same spirit that same one that same word that same Christ is embodied in you now he said it's embodied in the body of the bride and the body of the Bride the bride which is his body is absolutely the revelation of himself not another amen good I didn't have to hardly quote any quotes that's good okay it's embodied Holy Spirit showing the same thing he did when his body in the body of Jesus Christ now it's embodied in the body of his bride his thoughts are Eternal they are real hey amen amen the same one the same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks to the bride amen well how can the Bride come and come how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of the groom did you catch what I what you just said right here yes okay he said and the groom come and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride did you did you sweet did you catch kind of a little jingle let me read well now how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride it's a question she would have to be the groom if the groom come it'd have to be the bride oh no they're separate not anymore she is him and he is her amen are you with me same God Same Spirit manifesting form and more faith in this act it's bride in this act he's bride amen now after the battle is over let's let's go on and I'll close look notice this God foresaw the bride in the groom Hallelujah he foresaw it to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her Adam knowed what he was doing Eve didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife and Jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her remember he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place that's scripture you know that okay he took he became sin for you that you might become his righteousness all right now he stood in your place you might stand in his place what a love and I say what a position what a love what a love what a fellowship how can we deny it how can we do anything but love him friend notice after the battle was over Melchizedek served his Victorious child speaking of Abraham is it who was what the seed he he served his Victorious child communion think of that part of himself now we sing the song the battle is over the battle is over that's true we've conquered in Christ the battle's over is that right and we're going to have a new body and and death will be this death will be swallowed up in Victory we already have Victory we are his victory this is no mystery how this will be swallowed up then amen this this humanness this carnlness this sin can't rise again but you'll rise again in a body this body will be changed so he won the victory in Jesus Christ so after the battle are you with me okay now listen to what he says I just want to make sure we got that point think of of you gave you a part of himself that's what the seals was about all right now now we want to see how he gave himself he gave you a spirit that's true you have a spoonful of him but do you realize the Spoonful is no better different chemical than the whole ocean you can't cut up God's little piece and say you got less power and more power and less power and more power it's all the same power it's just in the measure amen you're a major I'm a major I can't do it without you you say you're closing I am now we want to see here in type there the view of communion he communed with his child now we see here in type here is in view the communion after the battle he gave himself because the communion is part of Christ now watch the deeper meaning of communion versus what we take showing that communion this is what brother Brown's showing you here he said the view of communion after the battle he gave himself he gave of himself because the communion is part of Christ how can you commune with him and not be a part of him right I'll just stop and think about that how can you walk with him and not commune with him there's somebody Walking with God today are you one of them Walking with God then apply the token start applying the token where's your headship Enoch walked with him he was above him he was with him he had Enoch walked with him is that right had a real revelation of him type of the Bride today seventh and Adam but you're walking with him with him in you he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you there's the communion do you realize there's the community even Enoch had communion with him but uh on a different level now we have communion with him in a full different level a deeper level all right because now this is the corner of the whole thing this is the head of the whole thing what is it without us they can't be made perfect all right so Christ in you brother Bram said Christ the mystery revealed in you would make you does make you the complete revelation of the whole thing the final the Finish the song what a position bride to see ourselves positionally placed in Christ amen all right so after the battle he gave himself because the communion is part of Christ he gave himself and after the struggle is over after you've done got yourself whipped out after you've got yourself whipped out you have to die before you can have a birth you have to die to yourself before you can have a birth before a resurrection which is a new birth you have to die to yourself to spiritually rise in a birth New Birth to spiritually rise as himself you have to die to yourself and for him to be manifested daily you've got to die to yourself all right because this man will be much alive until it's changed but you've conquered him he's a defeated enemy you see who your enemy is it's not your brother's sister it's you your own self stinking self right carnal cell but greater is he that is in you that is conquered and promise he that raised up Christ shall also Quicken your mortal body and bring it subject to the word and change it one day but now while we're here he's going to bring it subject to the word that shows Christ in you because there's only one thing that can bring this man under objective subjection to the word that's the quickening power of the Holy Spirit himself so everything we do it'll either vindicate the word keep with the word stay with the word if you've got another Spirit speaking to you and voices and it don't lay it with the word you've got a carnal negative demon spirit if what you think you're prophesying and thinking you're speaking out and it doesn't lay with this word you've got a wrong spirit speaking to you amen pretty straight but God will say with his word always all right you can't leave that word okay because God in his word is one but do you get what I'm saying after the struggle is over after you've done whipped yourself out then I'm closing now with this remember he said then is when you partake of Christ become part of his being you get it he said now watch the next we're going to take communion next Sunday listen I'm not bringing this just to be bringing it God said you bring this this good morning and I knew I'd had to close with this right in this area he said after this he said Jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed him see a birth is a mess it's not easy it's a dying he said that's right he said he battled for life and after the battle is over God gives you of himself that is his true communion the little bread and wafer just represents it when you come up here to take that communion you're representing to the people that you're in Divine communion born of his spirit in communion with Christ you can take that I got other places you could take the same thing brother Brown says the same thing and one of them is future home no one has a right to take it until he'd been born again amen now that's pretty straight I know that's straight but that's the truth and I say if Christ is not manifested in your life I'm not talking your mistakes and failures I'm talking about life here I'm talking about the fruit of that life if Christ isn't you don't see him manifest in your life get right with God okay now watch what he says here he said the little bread and wafer just represents it you shouldn't take it unless you've wrestled it out and become part of God that applies to me that applies to you that applies to every person in here we might as well get the order right the problem today is too many people look at the order the church order and Order of God in the church as being some legalistic something it's not legalistic God has an order and he has a way and we've got to come under that order it's either the head it's either the word take his possession as it has headship over here over an assembly over people or it isn't amen unveiling of God you want to stand I'm closing with this positions you can come but I don't want you to miss this statement unveiling of God this is brother Brandon this is what he says I was he said he's talking about being identified as a as a a citizen U.S everything the U.S is I've become everything that Paul Revere did I did or George Washington I was identified there was identified I was identified to be a Christian I have to be identified with Christ and watch what he says he said I was identified with him with him Christ I was identified with him all that he was I am how can you be all he was without having the same Spirit and the Same Spirit in you revealed is the new birth what is the new birth it's Jesus Christ who are you that must be born again Jesus Christ that is the new birth it's not meeting an imagination you meet a person don't tell me you won't know it can a mother give a birth to a baby and not know it I'm not saying you could be begotten you may be begotten but until there's a birth you can be begotten of the spirit within you justification sanctification that'll save you but it's not enough to put you in the bride because the bride is the one that's going to be born again you can be begotten of God brother Brown said but still not have a birth amen [Music] amen there are two comings of the Holy Spirit brother Brown said there isn't one coming and then subsequent to that another one go back and search Church agency if you said that what he said he made it very clear what the new birth was and we've heard it you need to really listen all right all that he was all that I am he says excuse me all that he was listen to The Prophet's words now unveiling of God all that he was how can we be unveiling of God and then start talking about what we are because it's the unveiling of God how you hear me listen to me listen to her what he said you have a part of the unveiling you are a part of that in Daily all that he was I am all that I am he was amen being dead in him we are identified with him what he is I am amen now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship coming in going in being fulfilled this day this scripture is being fulfilled right in the midst of the people and they don't see it but the bride does and I'm thankful I don't know who they are but I know who I am [Music] well you should say Brother David I'm I'm reaching for it no there's more to be revealed in that I'm sure but I know who he's revealed it to and I know he's revealed in me and you can know that it's just not David knowing that it's just not brother Paul it's not the ministry you can know it this isn't something that's just well it's just for the ministry no we are servers to the bride to serve them food in due season we must remember we are serving food in due season and what is the season [Music] right time [Music] son of man revealed seed time right age Rapture time [Music] you say all those were Quotes no they're not cliches they're real [Music] I don't believe God speaks to a prophet cliches he speaks the truth and the truth becomes real to you and I how can we be still [Music] so do you love him all that he ever was I like to be identified with him if I'm in Christ I'm his word if I'm in Christ I'm his word for he is the word and what he is I am amen he said do you get it being Eternal at the beginning eternal life that you had the thought of what you was only he wanted you he wanted you me to stand in the Pulpit say he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose and the old look at that just he say well Brother David you mean for me to sit here in the seat you're serving I'm serving his purpose yeah you are for me to stand in the Pulpit I'm serving his purpose I am does that make me big and you little no it's serving his purpose it's him working do you realize what he said pick up your pen and write he said the bride is now working in excuse me God is working in and through his bride that's this day and she knows it she knows it now if you want to go back and read and continue to read on that uh first you know I didn't even read that I think I'll finish with that but all right all right then after it's finished she he said then serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to the Earth to serve his purpose is that right all right then after it's finished it's brought right back in a glorified State it's matured it's matured and brought back again foreign what a Time first John I'm going to close I'm going to let you go with this scripture God just brought my attention I needed to read it [Music] first John 5 he's I believe 10 verse 10 he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself what is the witness the Holy Ghost is the witness eternal life is the witness all right oh I hope that's something brother Paul I think you've I know I know I've I've had some of this too you remember something and then you think oh man I've got to get that because if I don't it's not fulfilled complete I wanted to go back here to yeah I'll get it [Music] you know what all [Music] what was what was once in God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is this is very important is put in the hearts of the believer [Music] there's your hidden treasure is put in the hearts of believer that is the body of Jesus of Christ what was once God's Great Secret in his mind before the foundational world is now made manifest think of it the God's great mystery what the Eternal God has a mystery has been unfolded in Jesus Christ then given right down to his bride what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church is bride Whispering secrets to her amen amen amen I'm trying to find a certain place here also just a moment oh yes here we are I told you I'd come to the evidence and I can't leave this until I get you the evidence of the Holy Ghost in you most perfect evidence I can think of brother Branham said is love so we got to thinking on that and then I thought that sounded pretty good so I just held to that if a man got love but one day the Lord in a vision straightened me out he said the evidence of the spirit is those who could receive the word [Music] neither love nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word he that has an ear to hear let him receive he can build he has the ability to receive all right and then Dr Vale was saying to me that is scripturally said because John 14 said when the Holy Ghost has come he will reveal these things to you that I've taught you he will show you things to come so there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost he's never told me anything wrong yet it is the evidence of the Holy Ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it what do you say he would do [Music] he said in John 14 and verse also 16 that he would reveal these things that I've spoken to you and show you things to come there is the genuine evidence what are you playing huh now let's sing that song commune with me [Music] okay just a moment still didn't get that scripture [Music] he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself he that believeth not God hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that God gave of his son and this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life [Music] and and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life he that hathness not the son hath not life now now that brings up something I'm sorry I just got to follow through with this you say that's ridiculous no it's not ridiculous I be careful what you're saying [Music] amen because listen I've got to get to that I've got to get to a place yeah here it is [Music] oh that's not it it's a minute I've got places I'm pulling out of different messages okay here it is church age book now truly as far as I know I'm closing I'm closing names are going to be blotted out of The Book of Life Oh Brother David that can't that's exactly what he said we went through that in a series to understand I brought that exactly how I brought it no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life now I just said names would be blocked blotted out of The Book of Life how The Book of Life and brother Branham said The Book of Life the land Book of Life is the same book but there is this watch how he says it no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the Book of Life [Music] this is the record that God has given us and this life is in his son you see why I had to read it now he that hath life eternal hath the son he that hath not the son hath not life eternal and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundational world that great Royal seed Jesus Christ was planted he died and that life was in him came up through the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in multitudes of wheat seed having the same life in them and being like the original because of my spirit they are original remember he went there with you in him Calvary he never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body amen amen amen so that he God foresaw the bride in the groom Amen to save his wife like Adam amen amen the rest of it I've read praise the Lord I'm happy in the Lord anyway let's sing the song though you sang it started there commune with him come you [Music] you calm you with me between the wings of the cherubim commune with me [Music] with me
