is star This song is called maker of the Stars by the en cockman family and um it talks about how he Christ came down in very humble beginnings yet the whole time he was the maker of the Stars and then Rose from there and took took the burden of to Calvary all the while being the maker of the stars and that that is Unthinkable love God bless you one star shines the brightest on this very special night and Joseph lifts the baby up to see it brilliant light like a million candles he a glory of its own the stars sing out together like the morning they were born their ancient fires burning in remembrance of the joy as he cast them brightly shining through the darkness of the void and Mary smiles and wonders just how high they really are as she holds a tiny baby to her heart Unthinkable love he's the maker of the Stars maker of the Stars set your fire in me and let it burn burn burn so bright it's Christmas time and let it shine that all might see in this Dark World it can be very hard for the maker of the star from a baby in a Manger to a man upon the cross when he cried it is finished all creation felt the L and as a soldier pierced him the Earth recoiled in pain and the sun refused to shine upon the Kindler of his flame oh days star are you weeping you watch over him so long now you're powerless to save him from dying all alone there's nothing you can do but to turn and face the dark as the Earth shakes with the last speit of his heart Unthinkable love he's the maker of the Stars maker of the Stars set your fire in me and let it burn burn burn so bright this Christmas time and let it shine that all might see in this Dark World it can be very hard for the maker of the Stars maker of the Stars sets your fire in me and let it burn burn burn so bright this Christmas time and let it shine that all might see in this dark rule it can't be very hard for the maker of the [Music] [Applause] Stars for yes [Music] we've heard about how Jesus came in such a humble way a baby born through a virgin birth and in a major land we heard about the shining star the wise men traveling from afar the Shepherds fed their flock By Night an angel sending Holy Light sometimes we don't notice and some forget to see the grace is brought to every man the likes of you and me so in this Christmas season let's take the time to grateful for his precious gift of love [Music] Christ is born Emmanuel God is with us from his throne for his own the savior of the world we've heard about how Jesus came in such a simple way how he came in flesh as a lonely man his purpose to display this is our Redemption Story how we came to Earth from glory to redeem s for plan to Redeemer from fall in man as Christians we are privileged to live every day as Witnesses of Jesus Christ who gave his life away so when we gather with our families and bow our heads to pray let's give the Praises To The King of [Music] Kings Christ is born uel God is with us from his throne for his own the savior of [Music] World Christ is born uel God is with us from his throne for his the savior of the world from his thr for his all the saor of the world from his throne for his own the savior of the world [Applause] am [Music] to the Earth the king was born in a quiet peace peaceful manger God Of Heaven came his people to redeem who would come to worship him bring him praise and adoration humbly bowing as Jehovah lay on him and though the heavens all resounded with the angel song singing Glory Hallelujah to the king that's born yet the people lost in s wouldn't come to H him they were satisfied with their religious c as we celebrate his birth bringing praise and adoration gift of life eternal for our soul may the light within my heart touch the lives of many others May the Life of Christ be flesh in me today it's not enough to know the story of that Holy Night God he send it in our in all his power and might now the birth of Christ is real in my heart it's been revealed I'm a witness of the coming of the Lord today it's not enough to know the story of that Holy Night God's descended in our day in all his power and might now the birth of Christ is real in my heart it's been revealed I'm a witness of the coming of the Lord today [Music] amen 136 U [Music] Immanuel his name is [Music] called [Music] Manuel he's God With Us raled in US his name is called uel see that one more time U [Music] Immanuel his name is called immanu he's God With Us his name is called amen you one more time [Music] uel his name is [Music] called he's God with us we in US his name is [Music] called Praise the Lord amen isn't it wonderful be such a part of the economy of God Amen he chose to be revealed in US yes that's right you know we sometimes don't think we're much but when we recognize that you must be something to be the house of the Living God not a historical God I remember just always you know sometimes profound things happen in your life and when we were in Israel and when you get the full context of when Jesus asked them who do you say I am and that's right you're right there and here's the tombs of all of these Gods all their all their dwelling Dwelling Places and you stand there it's all ruins now but at one time history gives a very clear picture that each one had his house and Jesus is standing there once he's told them I don't even have a place to lay my head they're not going to build one of these for me but who do you say I am that's it that's right and we can stand there just as it would be if God allowed us to go back in that time and we know what we would say that's exactly we know we wouldn't be pointing somewhere else but we would be looking at him and we would know who we were in Jesus Christ and I'm thankful today amen just visiting with a a minister brother a pastor and and he was just expressing to me the other day he says brother Paul he said I am shocked at the identity crisis in our world today not just in our world but even in the church that's right oh Lord help us to know who we are help us to see clearly who we are amen you know I time flies so fast when got to greet brother Marvin sister Cindy I nine years he knew he knew and I I'm I'm just like when was the last time I saw when was the last time but you know time goes so quickly and we're so happy to have them here with us and visiting and uh God bless you in this time and Hannah you know girl I don't want to embarass you but I'm putting sister on the front of that amen you know the thing is my brother and sister identity chrisis sometimes faces us face to face but our character is molded by the adversity that we face and all the challenge of life and I say God bless you and good to see you here today amen Let's uh I want to talk to you this morning the contrast thank you musicians that's beautiful the specials and everything let's just give thanks to God for the talent within it Hallelujah we've been blessed amen uh it's not my brother and sister a natural Talent of a voice but it's the the voice that is coming from within amen if you understand what I'm saying it's what's coming from the heart is what makes this a beautiful thing to be rejoicing over it it's not a natural Talent you can take almost anyone I'm told and train them to be able to sing they did that with a mon but you see for something to come from the heart that's it to be able to express that's right amen hallelujah how wonderful I want to um give a little clarification to next weekend we'll have Sunday morning service uh and a regular time then uh Sunday evening here at the church if you want to Fellowship more you need to come a little earlier so we're setting the time at 6 but you're more than welcome to come at 5: 5:30 whatever you want to do somewhere in the 7:30 range we're going to have a h a service and um then um about 8:30 we're going to have communion and uh I've made a decision and I hope you're not disappointed with it that uh we will have communion and uh no foot washing and so in that time we'll uh celebrate around the word of God we'll have uh some things that I don't want to announce right now that we'll take place and we'll have communion and then how you choose to spend the rest of your Sunday evening we will leave in your hands uh we may just after communion sing for a few hours whatever is your heart's desires amen so I would like you this morning once again again on the thought of the contrast of the two Natures I want you this morning to look at the law of life and um as I speak today there might be some things that uh at first you might question a for a moment uh but you'll uh I trust have patience with me as we turn in our Bibles to 2 Corinthians the 10th chapter verses 1-5 and uh it is here my brother and sister that God is always working on our behalf and many times we find that the word being preached uh is not anything new but it comes to us from a direction maybe we hadn't thought or saw or been expounded but we wish know that it's always the word of God I believe the ministry here in the church with all of my heart has no more desire than to preach the pure word of God we don't have an agenda we don't have a side thought uh just the pure word amen 2 Corinthians the 10th chapter now I Paul beeech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presence and base among you but being absent and bold toward you but I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the Flesh and my brother and sister we're seeing what he was speaking to the Corinthians coming to pass once again people believe that it's just being spoken from the Flesh and um sometimes you know people would think well I think the preacher is preaching towards me but you see if you catch the Revelation that Paul was speaking to the Corinthians it is not I but Christ in me that's right and so you know the old phrase I'm I'm sorry sometimes just being you know a farm kid comes to life but seriously if the shoe fits wear it that's true if it doesn't fit it wasn't intended for you that's right and you know we can make it fit force it or we can decide it simply doesn't fit and Skip right over it but truly let's just take the position if it fits Lord let it come to life in me amen that's right to be bold think as if we walked according to the Flesh and that's actually Saints don't mean to keep you standing but that's actually a great Revelation because if we're here today in the flesh we're going to have disappointments the preacher is going to say this or that the service is too long whatever the flesh but at some point in time we got to realize that God's called us Beyond flesh that's right he's called us Beyond how we feel sir right you know I love the little story a brother shared with me one time and and um present company um be kind with me but a special service and the brother that's preaching us the one that shared it with me and he says he looks in the third row and here's a young lady that's just dressed in a certain fashion and he was just like oh my oh my oh my and partway through the service the Holy Spirit dealt with him and said speak on this and he's like I'll offend them the Holy Spirit Come and said speak and he spoke at the end of the service he thought well we probably probably you know DET them the next service the next night they've moved up a row and in that service the Lord speaks to him says speak and he speaks and he's once again in the flesh thinking that would be too much but on Sunday morning they were on the front row and before that service was over they were in the altar you see God knows what he's doing that's right let's not try to put mind around this and look at this according to our flesh there is a plan of God and we are here to fulfill that plan for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ that's right Heavenly Father we just ask you Lord Jesus today Lord as these things you've laid upon our heart father let let us manifest that speak that father but let it not just be words Lord let us bring it into an action that's father that we can step up and step out into a higher Kingdom father we thank you for this day bless each and everyone that is here Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you you may be seated you know in the world today and I do not say this judgmentally in the world today people Express how they are so happy that we are no longer under the law and naturally and spiritually my brother and sister there are laws that are in us there is uh laws that control life and you look at this my brother and sister that uh I I know this might not be a Perfect Analogy but there is a certain law that would declare that in the body of man uh you need the heart to move the blood and it doesn't matter how much oxygen is in the air if the heart is not functioning not moving the blood then your life is finished and that could be then also that your heart could beat strongly and if there's no Oxygen your life is finished it could be that you could be injured in such a fashion that if there's not a signal coming from your brain that your heart will beat in what they call sympathy for a period of time sometimes s they have recorded even a heartbeating for minutes when a person should not have life at all in them but ultimately the law of Life dictates what happens and so it is there that uh these laws within us are controlling life we we need water amen and we need food and we need all of these things they're all ingredients we can give substitutes often times we'll see a person in the hospital might be receiving as what you might say is a substitute they're being fed through a tube or uh you know different things like that would be on uh oxygen uh intubated or whatever it might be and uh these laws are in us but each one of these laws ultimately is controlling life and in verse three it says though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the Flesh and I just I don't want to be rude this morning but my brother and sister I I believe I could speak with confidence not judgmentally that each one of us today we still have a segment of us I believe we're Sons and Daughters of God Can someone say Amen we were called to a high calling but each one of us is still laboring walking in the flesh and we are there and you'd say oh how do I overcome this flesh well my brother and sister we'll we'll by God's grace touch on this but you see while we're walking in this flesh our vision of who we are should be higher than this flesh it should be a place that we would look at this flesh and be able to say with all honesty Lord I have sinned forgive me I have come short of the glory of God forgive me but you see there should not be a war there and while I would some would say well there needs to be sometimes a a conflict within us to move us yes but my brother and sister not a war because in war there is destruction and when Satan can come and cause you to look at yourself as unworthy then how do you go out your door in the morning if you in your heart in your spirit believe I'm unworthy when Satan throws it in front of you it tends to be a nature such as well I'm already unworthy does this matter but when we can come to a place to recognize as Sons and Daughters of God that we are walking here in this flesh but we're not Waring after this flesh and you know the fight against our flesh you know my brother and sister often times you'll see this as you deal uh maybe with young people well old people let's just say people amen you know they think if I stop doing this or I start doing that amen that that that would be what makes the difference you know we try to constrain our flesh my brother and sister you cannot constrain the flesh the flesh just like the tongue is an unwieldy monster it has certain things about it that must it must be fulfilled it tells itself I can't live without but my brother and sister you can constrain the Flesh and force it into subjection are you with me you can force the flesh into subjection and at a Sur surface surface level let me put it this way because I don't want you to take this as a deep thought but if we are going to force the flesh into subjection we're not much different than a Buddhist punk I wasn't called to be a Buddhist monk you weren't called to be Buddhist monks amen so I I don't even want to be in a comparison you know sleep on a stone bed because you're not worthy eat bread and water because you're not worthy no heat in your room because you're not worthy that will not redeem the soul amen amen you could live in the comfort of this world in the Natural Things my brother and sister and you could believe that that must be what you were called to be but I'm telling you whether you are hot or cold whether you are rich or poor it's a substance that's been poured into your soul is what makes that difference and without that my brother and sister the battle the war goes on now as we look here I think it's safe to say we've been called to another level would you agree with me you know as I was putting these thoughts to paper I I I didn't put it on on the deal but you know look at this my brother and sister I've never been a a video game person in fact I personally this is just Paul personal right don't want to make a big stand on that but I personally think they're one of the most clever things that Satan has ever invented uh people kill steal destroy but it's only a game but if good Christian Youth would spend that much time in the word of God my they would actually be building something exactly right they would actually have something they could lay their hands on but you see in the video world you know you must perform certain things to move to the next level and I remember when I was a young man maybe the reason I don't like video games is cuz I'm a failure at playing them and back in the days when it was just asteroids do any of you know what asteroids was amen it might be look at this you guys are in rarified country asteroids is simplest of all video games and I never made it past level two and if you don't know what level two is that's basically down Sammy and Dean's level so you look at this my brother and sister maybe I never went there because I wasn't any good at it but maybe I never went there because God didn't allow me to be good at it and as we come and recognizing now I make that to make a point and I hope it makes sense to you you see we must realize that we cannot take ourselves to the next level right it must be Christ in US it must be revelation of the holy spirit that moves us to be able to step into a realm we have never before habitated a place we have never been before in our life and God takes us there it's not what we can do but what he has done amen and so we've been called to this nether level amen what is this level it's a manifested level we can talk about the word of God all we want we can say well you know if we have the Holy Ghost we'll do this and we'll do that and we can do this and I can overcome that but my brother and sister all the overcoming that is within you came from Christ it is not you amen it's him in you and so what happens is is God comes down pouring in the Holy Spirit and we're not going to put this as it is we talked about faith by measure the other day my brother and sister we're we're not going to come and and start to try and put some quantification that if I can get here I'll get this I get here I get this I get here I get here oh my brother and sister what we got to do is get in Christ amen and when we get in him amen we're coming to a manifested level does that make sense to you amen they're coming to a level that the flesh is less important to you than living in the spirit amen and it's at that place right there we're slowly able to look at the failures of this flesh right here we don't want these failures can we say Amen to that but when you do have that it doesn't have the impact on your life Brother David hit right in that vein we come here without condemnation today why because we're not living by the flesh any longer we're moving into the spirit realm and God is manifesting that in us because we still have our challenges is that a fair way to put it we still have our challenges and it's not that we just look over our challenges though it never existed but we realize that's not really me that's it amen I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God that's not really me and Satan you might be the accuser but you're accusing the wrong one amen the one you're accusing amen is the one that's living by the Holy Ghost amen and you have been vanquished amen the devil never admit he's defeated that's right he will never admit he's defeated but I tell you if we saw a Clear Vision that's it of the devil he wouldn't be a roaring lion right the scripture says he came as a roaring lion he's got the megaphone but if you saw him face to face he would be a toothless almost voiceless adversary to you yeah amen hallelujah amen that's right but you see this Living Word this man ested level is a living word amen uh Christ Living in us today it it should not even be a second guess for us we should be able to say absolutely without a doubt I know he is living Can someone say Amen this morning he's living in me and I know he's living in you cuz if he wasn't you wouldn't be here you would be there that's right but he's here he's in this building this morning by promise that's it amen he made vow to us where two or three are gathered together I will be in their midst amen well I'll take my brother and sister without going outside of the boundaries of scripture and tell you we one son or daughter of God filled with the Holy Ghost believing every word of God for their day is standing then God is right there amen I'm not circumventing two or three but I'm telling you it comes down a holy Coast filled believer is a majority that's right amen amen we don't have to to count numbers we just have to count what's in us that's it and when we know what's in us then we know where we stand that's it Hallelujah for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal now my brother and sister we look in the world today and all the politics and everything that's going on all of that is just fulfilling scripture we can sit here today and say but what about this and what about that and what's going to happen my brother sister the bride's going to be gone that's right it's just that simple that's right before they can drop a bomb the bride's going to be gone that's right God didn't have you judge yourself now to judge you again that's right amen he has you judge yourself by the word today and that word is our very Deliverance that's our very life it's our deliverance today and I think sometimes we need to maybe go when no one's in the house no one's in the car just look in a mirror and say I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God and you need to repeat those things until yourself you yourself believe it because the word's already declared it amen it's just now time for us to believe it amen our our Warfare is not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds I'll tell you what my brother and sister we can have strongholds in our life without even recognizing them being a stronghold right now this all ties together right here casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ that's right now let's look at this for a minute our Warfare is not carnal so you're not going to take this flesh and cause this flesh to make you Victorious but you come and it's mighty through God to the pulling down of stronghold I want to ask you this morning you don't need to speak it out loud it would be completely unnecessary to have it named but you need to stop and find the strongholds in your life and it doesn't mean they're sin that's right that's right we can preface almost everything that we speak with I'm not worthy what are you really saying it's not news to God that's right you standing here today and saying I'm not worthy the reason I'm not doing this this and this is because I'm not worthy God knew that and he called you anyhow he's trying to move you anyhow amen because he knows if you will move you'll manifest amen and as we move we manifest amen so what's happening here these strongholds must be pulled down amen and cast down our imaginations now I don't know if this one will apply to any of you but in years ago there's a stage of my life that I wanted to go to church but I didn't want to go to church I didn't want the preacher talking about me every sermon he always talked about me constantly talking about me I didn't want ago I didn't want to hear about it I already know what my problems are preacher you don't have to tell me what my problems are and so what I would do is I would sit in church and I would fix my problems I would let my imagination go over now why is this like this oh maybe there was a few misunderstood amens in church cuz when I figured out out why that tractor wasn't running right amen but you see my imagination aren't you glad you have an imagination in the right place the right time used for the right reason a wonderful thing the wrong time the wrong place the wrong reason is a tool of the devil that's right so we can't say today that our imagination is evil or sinful or you shouldn't have one but as he's speaking to the Corinthians he's telling them cast down your imaginations and those who heard those words and even heard those words today knew exactly what he was talking about now imaginations we don't want to go off into the sinful side of it but my brother sister I have seen people this is a true story they had this vivid imagination that when I win the lottery all my problems are going to be fixed and they dwelt on that for so long that they started secretly spending the family money on lottery tickets until they bankrupted their family still never won a lottery but the imagination of what they would do with the wealth let's stop for a moment what would you do with that much money I say that with humor you'd pay your ties first right but you see where Spirits like that take you yeah that's right that anointing takes you until pretty soon you wouldn't be giving your tithe and offering to the church you'd be buying lottery tickets believing it was just a deferred action that later you could come back and offer the church a pile of money wickness let me throw it out even more direct a friend of mine dealt with this in his church that a brother come and said I had a dream a vision last night okay brother what the Lord spoke to me and told me I've been married to the wrong woman for 20 years and a day later a sister come and said the Lord come to me last night and said I've been married to the wrong husband for however many years and it manifests and they leave their spouses and they go off together because this was God that had told them their marriage didn't even last a year right what was that a vain imagination now we won't dwell on those things any further but my brother and sister you see if we do not put these things in their correct place every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God aren't you glad for personal revelation yes I thank God so much for personal revelation but when personal revelation becomes your Revelation and not in the context of God giving it to you but it becomes yours connected directly with vain imagination it suddenly becomes your view of what God meant my brother and sister won't go into it but years ago we saw a man that we knew quite well pull off draw many people into this movement that he had and he had even the the the uh uh same sword that was given and the prophet was placed in his hand showing he had supreme authority of the word and deceived my brother and sister and destroyed marriage and marriage and marriage and marriage just going right down the line some of you'll know who I'm talking about my brother and sister as you'll look at that you see what it comes from a vain imagination have we all had and and I trust that we do experience the supernatural I pray every one of us amen at a time in our life we'll be able to say I have experienced the supernatural but it must fit the word that's right it won't be God speaking if it doesn't fit the word amen every thought to be in Obedience of Christ so we can get caught up in all kinds of thoughts but let me just bring this back around because this really fits where I'm at today we can have these things these vain imaginations we can have all of these things that come and they're run ack Satan's there're anointing it amen and it's there my brother and sister we can believe that that must be for someone else this message and the Revelation the full expression of the Revelation would be for someone else and we never even try to attain to it because we believe the very thing that Satan anoints our mind to believe and God's calling us to a higher level that's right man I miss sister Sue this morning pray for her she doesn't feel well but look at this my brother and sister you see you're not sinning you're not down in the corner you're not here you're not whatever but you're not going to move into the fullness of the Revelation for this hour that God has given to the bride because you're going to believe that's always for someone more spiritual than you and God wants you to believe what he said that's right not how you compare there's no graph there's no Matrix there's nothing out there I compare like here my brother and sister the word of God shows each and every one of us that we're unworthy that's right but by Grace Can someone say by Grace by Grace amen by his Precious Blood we've been elevated into a place of the family of God into a place that he called us to not our Merit but Satan that liar is a clever one Philippians 4:8 says finally brother now let me just isolate this just a little bit if you don't mind just to make a point we've been over everything and everything and we've talked about everything and we've tried to convince you of everything and we've looked through this and looked through that but finally my brethren okay don't take that as an absolute interpretation on the scripture finally brother whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things amen did you hear about brother so and so sister so and so the so and so family did you hear about this did you hear about this church here my brother and sister those things don't bring no benefit to us amen they're no blessing to us all it is is Satan's way to throw a bunch of glitter and a bunch of garbage in your mind you know they figured out years ago when we got into the realm of missile Warfare and they started applying this to jet fighters when a missile would be fired at them they would reach over and toggle a switch and it started kicking out uh uh bundles of aluminum foil and on the radar of the plane that was uh seeking that or the missile that was seeking them it become a bunch of clutter that was there and the radar say this is it and start to go that way and then go no it's this over here no it's here no it's there and the enemy amen would become confused or the believer would become confused scripture tells us that they say Christ is here don't go if he's there don't go right the word where did he say the word would be in you amen don't follow this ISM don't follow that ISM don't get cluttered up in your mind about these things amen cast down the imaginations I'm going to move all the way across the country go to this church because I think I'll be a better Christian in that church my brother and sister you ought to be a good Christian whether you're in the best church or you're in a prison that's right amen that should not make a difference amen it's when we trust in Christ so what we got to do is figure out what it is we're supposed to be thinking on see it says bring into captivity every thought amen if you don't mind I'm pulling that thought and I'm putting it over here as I already said not every thought is evil Vil but a thought can be a distraction that's right let me just throw one at you you be in church whoever the minister is says something it reminds you of another Minister said something along the same line your mind then detaches from what is right here reality right reality and you start reliving what some preacher preached that you listen to on a on a audio or whatever it might be and your mind takes you out of the service right here and takes you over there and your mind says I was so blessed that was such a good service I was so blessed missing every blessing that's being poured out right in front of you missing everything that God's got for you today well praise the Lord if that works for you send your grocery money to me and I'll play a video for you of somebody eating good food you can't live there my brother and sister God give you you present Mana fresh Mana it's what he give to you and look how Satan will do that I know it works he's done it to me yes sir so thoughts can be distractions yes sir and our thoughts can be strongholds amen we won't go into a lot of this but my brother and sister look how often it is that what we have is a preconceived notion about how somebody feels about us I just noticed in church when we were walking out how they just gave a sideways glance and looked ahead and just walked off I saw this I saw that I felt yeah pretty soon you've built such a complex they walk in the room you leave that's it now who's snubbing who that's it but see how Satan Works he's so clever often times he lets us my brother and sister Dam up our own stream that's it that's exactly right amen we've already touched on imaginations I bring it in another fashion but I believe we got the point every thought that even has potential to exalt itself against the knowledge of God we should be putting that thought down that's it whether it's like well you know brother brandham said this but you know I was reading over here and they expressed it here and it was so much more clearer than what brother Bram said I'm not sure brother brandom fully understood what he was saying after all he had no education by his own admission he had none of this and he had none of that and so I think I'm going to just take this over here because it seems to have more clarity problem is it has no dovetail that's right it might have Clarity to the mind but no dovetail in the word that's right amen so everything that even has potential amen you realize we got a lot of of stuff to declutter that's exactly right if you come to Brother Paul's sister Jerry's house we go through these spurts of decluttering and then you walk back in the garage where the shelves just a few weeks ago were lined up just perfect and I look up and it's like who put that there you did Paul it doesn't go there it goes here but something's already occupying this space so I need to set this down and take this and put it where belongs but something's already occupying that space and then an hour or two goes by that you thought you were going to clean the garage and all you've done is do a circular motion of a bunch of things that you're not sure where it belongs somewhere along the line we got to take things and say you know what I learned this here and it doesn't fit anywhere I was taught this but it doesn't fit anywhere in the message that's it right there it isct and when I say message I mean the word of God that's right sometimes we just got to be brave some of you my friends have mocked me before come on Paul just let go of it I do you realize I've had this thing forever it's almost has historic value in my life let go that's it right clean it out that's right got message people still trying to reconcile Matthew 28:19 come on Saints I'm not being judgmental but I'm telling you because it's such a strong teaching in their life they are afraid they might be wrong so they won't let go of Matthew 28:19 but they don't know where to put it that's it they're going around the garage of their life saying where do I put this where do I put this why don't you take Matthew 28:19 and recognize that the word cannot counter dict the word and it be the word and so just take that thought that you've got and take it over there and let go of it because Matthew 28:19 is fully explained in Acts 238 amen you don't have to go any further but we hold on to these things and it becomes clutter in our minds do you know if I could shift gears turn a corner here we've been taught many of us have been taught that we're no longer under the law right that is a real Mantra in the denominational World we're no longer under the law we're no longer under the law we're under grace my brother and sister as we find balance in our life aren't you glad for balance I can't help it brother George forgot his level last time and he said Paul I don't know if this a compliment or a dig but he said Paul just keep it you probably need it more than I do I was like how do I take that brother George was quick he goes any way you want but my brother and sister we've heard it's one of brother George's uh topics you might say he likes is the balance amen and as we find balance in our life we recognize that we will be always were and always will be under the law some people struggle with that even around the message they say no no Jesus did away with the law give me a scripture for it he actually said I come to fulfill the law not do away with it amen so he brought it down in a level amen that we would always be under the law now my brother and sister let's stop for a second if we Define the law in a certain fashion being under the law is hard it's abrasive we cha under the law but all the law was was defining the parameters that God wanted us to live in right you know in the farm country maybe even in the city good fences make good neighbors right yeah yeah I sold some hay yesterday to a lady she she's been buying hay from us and she she came yesterday and she's very apologetic she says Paul I am so sorry she was about 45 50 minutes later than she said she would come and she said I am so sorry but I had things I had to take care of and I was like oh it's fine her name is Holly and I said it's fine Holly she goes well no it was very important and I said okay no problem my pigs were out and they were rooting up the neighbor's yard you know Holly you should take care of that some things are very important but the law was there to give us parameters to live in not every willy-nilly of our thoughts and our imaginations to take us over but God put that there for us as I said Jesus declares he didn't come to do away with the law but to fulfill it so I'm here this morning maybe controversial to tell you that we're called to live under the law now you know that always gets a little scratchy you know people are like wait wait where's Grace in this no just be patient with me okay I'm not here to drag you off in the bushes out here and drop you in a Ravine and tell you to find your way home amen we're called to live under the law and God's got laws that he wants you he wants you to live under those laws he he wants you to recognize that it's him that has done this and and just come and settle down don't don't be you know bouncing off the fences trying to get away from this but God wants you so much he wants you to embrace that law amen because you see my brother and sister when we fight against the law we often times think that the law is somehow separate from Christ and the law is there to cause us to have to do things against what we really want to do but my brother and sister when we app apply the law of life then our thoughts are on Christ life that's it there's no life outside of Christ right so when we think of the good things Philippians 4:8 amen we think on Christ my brother and sister we're thinking on life we're in embracing life everybody's you know I won't I'll get in trouble uh probably uh certain mother here in the church will slap me if I go singing off some song again and uh but my brother and sister uh you know there there's songs out there that's come out through the ages of of people and they sing about they're looking for Life there there's something they're seeking and they can't find it but they want it they long for it and as they try to embrace this thing of life life actually is passing them by because the only life there is is Christ and so while they're trying to make this flesh feel like it's accomplished something and it's embraced something and it feels good and feels filled with something then we see that it's going by why because Satan is taking us over here in an alternate Channel and moving us and we're believing success is life we're believing this is life we're believing that's life and that's why my brother brother and sister I don't want to be too rude but that's why they drape the half clothed woman on top of every article in mankind because there's so many men out there that are looking for Life they're not fulfilled if I buy this pickup does the girl come with it never that's right if I do this does a girl come with it never but it plants a seed of life and they Embrace that because they longing for life and the vi vice versa yeah I never did see an advertisement with a man in his underwear in a pair of tennis shoes this is the Ridiculousness I'm going to just speak bold isn't it great getting older brother David I I don't want to be old I want to be young but I'm telling you this is a greatness that comes with that because all you guys can do is just fire me it's against the law for you to beat me but you see what it is my brother and sister there is a yearning a desire a longing for life and they present life as some fashion and some thing over here and people say if I go there I can get it and then they run from that one if I go here I can get it all they do is they're still who they are and I hope I don't offend anybody but they're still old and undesirable yeah the 100 ,000 pickup didn't change that the 85 year-old guy driving a 2023 Corvette is still an old man with wispy hair amen saggy muscles a bald head and can't do anything but climb in and out of his car he didn't change one drop so when we realize that we can applaud the LA law of life and then shift our whole thoughts from Corvettes and this and that and the other I use Corvette for an example because I think from the time I was about 12 years old till long long long after we've been married raised a family I would tell I have enough money one day I'm going to buy a Corvette well I don't know I necessarily have enough money to buy a Corvette but I tell you I climbed in one not not even that many years ago I thought boy that's a nice car brother Trevor I don't know I don't mean to me to whatever in church but you know I climbed in that thing wow cool the speedometer and the tachometer and the traction control is all on the windshield and this thing's got 600 horsepower okay it's time to get out of the car okay the asphalt's clean Corvette on life list you see God has a way of working my brother and sister I joke with sister Jerry you guys have probably find my humor a little bit off limits but I I joke with Jerry what would it look like if we pulled into church you know in a brand new 2023 you know they are pretty cool looking I pull in the parking lot over here and park in the unproc but proclaimed pastor's parking spot of which Brother David one time parked in there and I was like doesn't he know doesn't he know this is my spot what with the church yeah he did that's mental assault Brother David but you see what image is that this world is not my home right and if I owed money on it at the bank I could sing this Corvette is not my own that's right but you see my brother and sister what happens is Satan and anoints a thought the thought becomes an imagination the imagination starts to be manifested and if the Master Gardener doesn't come and cut that weed out you guys often wonder do you ever wonder why certain things head the way they do and then it just seems like it's just like cut off that's cuz the Master Gardener went and said that don't belong in my garden cut that out I think I'm going to go this way I want to do this you know there's a Time amen well we won't go into that we won't go into that you see we apply the law of Life Christ our thoughts will be on Christ want to live today today excuse me you want to live today under the laws of the Lord I do now can I read this quote in about five minutes brother Alex the guys in the back are all let's just hurry through it and if Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter of God we have right this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God bring them back that's right I'm glad that law applies because I was at a time not serving God and this applied to me and brought me back if he's Afflicted you made you sick we have a right before God to enforce the laws of God that's by his stripes we are healed did you realize these are not my words amen this is a law of God not random words in the scripture this is a law of God by his stripes we are healed amen bring him back turn him loose you're taking him out yonder of death and we claim him bring him back now that's the enforcement restore it back to its natural condition again a man is sick a baby is sick a woman is sick see they're out there in their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claim not our claim it's our claim because God give it to us by his stripes we were healed he was wounded for our transgressions have you ever had a transgression amen with his stripes we are healed now we have a right to enforce that law and the lawgiver that's it see we got to get our relationships correct how we view all of this the lawgiver is not to be afraid of the lawgiver is to be praised the Holy Spirit himself is here the agent of God to see that it's done that way amen and now the only way he can work is when that's it the preacher preaches the best healing service ever the best alter call ever no sir he can only work when you let him work amenallah see we've got you've got to believe it that's that's the law oh if I ever get to my text see we weren't the only ones with a problem like that there's a law there's a law given amongst everything can we read that again there's a law given amongst everything am if you took the law of gravity away my brother and sister we'd have serious problems I'm actually really happy about gravity if you remember around the turn of the century or when the automobile first got to be popular they were so afraid that if they went over 30 miles an hour that they would just fly off the face of the Earth wow oh and you sisters I'm glad that by the law of God a skirt an inch Too Tall an inch too low heels an inch too low doesn't leave you in The Stockade for a week why because we have balance of the word of God look at the Puritans they thought their deal was going to make this so uncomfortable you'll conform well let me put it this way this morning I don't want you to conform I want you to be conformed Amen to the mind of Christ not to law of man and the law of of this and the law of church but have your minds renewed amen being molded into the mind of Christ I liked how this is put there's a law given amongst everything you know a fish has a law and that fish can stand up here in water and he has a law within him and if he'll just let go of that law that's in him he can sink Plum to the Bottom of the Sea won't bother him a bit won't break one cell you try to do it that law is not in you that's it and let me just take here I I had it and I was going to carry it but I chose not to but right now we're going to take a little break there's another law that's in you and that's the law of death amen and if we give oursel to the law of death what will it produce it produces death amen my brother and sister this is the contrast of the the two Natures I chose to focus on the positive this morning I wanted to expound or or share out the positive amen that law is not in you okay so the law of death is not in you the law of life is you can't do it but the fish can he deflates himself with that air such a way that uh such a way that he can't there's nothing in him to burst open and he's made that way he knows it and he can enforce that law I think there's whole series right there enforce that law that's right a policeman blowing a whistle no sir the life in US enforcing the law of God to take him Plum to the Bottom of the Sea and then raise him back up again oh what a lovely type that is amen there was a law in Christ that law is in men you can bury him in the deepest grave or the deepest sea or the lowest hell there's a law of the spirit of God that will raise him up again oh Hallelujah and a bird has a law now its body is material it's Earthbound sits on the earth here but it has a law within it that the way it spreads its wings it can fly Plum out of sight that's against science they claim it's Earth found gravitation has its hold here but it can defy gravitation aren't you glad you've got that law in you amen not in this every day in the flesh amen but in the spiritual realm we are defying gravitation amen CU when he calls we are out of here oh [Music] Hallelujah but it can defy gravitation lift itself right off of it and go right on out because it has to put that law that's in it to work and if a bird has to put that law that's in it to work where will Sons and Daughters of God be putting that law in them to work that's right see this law is not to constrain us but to empower us that's it amen and it's built to possess that law now I'm beginning to feel religious now we have a law the law of the life in us we don't only thing you have to do you are made and born and placed here in the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of God you don't have to knock down to the devil you've got a law That's the Law of the Holy Spirit the only thing you know have to do is to know how to let go and let God that's right come on my brother and sister we can write out all kinds of rules about what you got to do and how you got to go about it if you're going to be a Christian how about we could just get down to Simplicity and preach let go and let God let that be a Doctrine Among Us let go let God hallelujah amen law of the Holy Spirit only thing you have to do is to know how to let go and let God you keep fighting at it see and it won't never work that's right when you let go and let God that's all see amen if the fish said see now I relate to this from my own youth if the fish said wait I'll catch my breath real good and I'll breathe up a little oxygen in me and I'll see if I can go down no he does that he'll burst open see the bird says I'll see how fast I can run down here and maybe I'll take off no he won't do it he'll fall down you got to know how to control how that law can control him and I'll tell you as a young man I thought that I had to just do this and I had to do that and someday God would just come and save me but you know when I finally got so low that I didn't have enough strength to even support life in myself God then come and says okay now you've reached at the level I can work with you that's it that's right see I was always trying to work my way up God said no I got to let you go down and down and down and down until you reach this point that you're pliable amen I can work with you I can change you can I have just a few more minutes to finish this quote amen and the same way it is with us it isn't what we fight and Pull and hurry and oh if I don't get this if I don't get that that's not it it's to know that the law of life is in you you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing take you to the baptism of the spirit or anything that he's promised any claim he's given is yours and letting go and letting God now I want to just say this I don't say this against any sermon ever been preached in this church or anywhere else but my brother and sister we often times put this quantification of what it's going to be to get the Holy Spirit and we don't put a bit of that away to the side but the bride of Christ already has something in her that when she will Just Surrender completely to Christ and say I can't do this Lord he will take and put us in our rightful position amen we can be oh I need this I need this I need this I need this my brother and sister let go let God Amen Let Us learn how to let go amen amen amen takes you to your healing to the baptism of spirit anything that he's promised amen did you catch that anything that he's promised and he claimed that he's given is yours by letting go and let letting God now if an officer was going to take the fellow that stole your property was going to take him to the court and you kept pulling him back well I don't know just whether he should do this or not he he'll never get him there just let him go that's right I like this right here catch this now Ponder this and that's the way you do let Satan just get away our problem is you see the you see these um coffee shop evangelists if they didn't tell you they were a Christian you would never know and what they want to do is argue you to their point of view yeah that's right I'm sorry I I'm not interested May the best arguer win no no no let the life that's within us just shine that's right I don't mean to make any point or emphasis concerning my wife But Here recently somebody gave her a very very very lovely compliment and it had to do with we see the light shining in you Jerry my brother and sister God help us if you don't believe the message you're lost that wins them every time no sir but Christ in you that's right wins every time amen everything flee from your mind then God will raise you up good now it's Easter time I like Easter yes sir there's too much on Easter today about bunny rabbits Ducks pink chickens pretty hat new dresses that's not Easter Easter is the resurrection restoring to restore back it's God's restoring time is that not what the word is for our hour yes you look out over the Earth God is restoring restoring what nature that's right he's restoring flowers he's restoring leaves he's restoring the fruits of the field what is it God is restoring it's Easter means to bring it back what is it there's been a sentence a claim Easter claims or or the flower claims it has a right to rise again see and God's law of nature pulls the Earth around and makes the law of God in nature bring forth an Easter a resurrection amen it's beautiful the return of the sun to restore what the winter killed what it was from the earth and God sends the Earth back around the Sun as we're told from way back here the earth the earth went away from the sun went back out there that's the way a us that's it I can say Amen to this amen that's the way a sinner does gets away from the so n and this is the Su n but when this Earth begins to come back when it's out there death strikes it the winter it kills every living thing it can kill out here out in Here and Now when the earth gets back around the seeds that's laying in the ground they're frozen you know I've been so far from God in my life I was frozen that's right Iceberg I thank God I never found any desire or anything in me to ever curse or maybe what you would say curse word would come out here and there and I never was happy when it came out but you see my brother and sister it don't matter how cold that's it it no matter how far away that's it all it takes does the flower stand up and say son no move 10° to the West no it's just laying there amen until the law of life that's it shines on it that's right and makes it come to pass that's right amen the life had to be in that seed that's right the sun didn't put the life there the s o n did before the foundation of the world but the Su cannot put that seed amen now when the earth gets back around the seeds laying in the ground they're frozen the pulp has run out of them and everything is gone but there's a little life preserved and as soon as the sun gets back in position with the Earth again then there is an Easter a restoration up comes the flowers again up comes everything all that the winter killed the sun restores all that the Winter's Death kill the Sun of life that's right restores Hallelujah okay well we still got another paragraph are you okay amen so it is now with the people all that Winter's coldness of cold formal religion killed out there the nearing of the Son of God in the last days coming to his church restores it back to life again I will restore saith the Lord see there's a law right there my brother and sister see God restores his flowers his leaves his nature his seed of the earth and therefore we know then that God will restore also his habitation that's it oh aren't you glad that you are his habitation amen he will restore his Eden he will restore everything that death killed that's right now the only way it can ever remain dead is that it lay in the wrong place but if it falls in the right place it's got to come back to life again so God let us fall in the right channel amen would that be our prayer today Lord let us fall in the right channel that's right amen that's right for restoration all that winter kill then the sun restores returning of the Sun what does it do it forces that's it amen hallelujah well I was away from the Lord as a Young Man wandered to and fro all over the south of Arizona Colorado Utah Nevada until I finally decided I I was going to serve God now I tell you what happened God forced me to come back that's right when the world becomes vomit to you when nothing satisfies you you go here and you're not satisfied you can have a new pickup you can have a new dirt bike you can have money in the bank you can have all this and you're not satisfied you can have some friends that want you to do this and that and you think about it and something inside it says that's not who you are that's it what happened I was forced that's right oh people don't like that idea I'm not going to let anybody force me anything no I'm telling you God can force you he can make you so miserable that you are forced to come to the place that he has because you're looking for the law of life for restoration all it is actually forces death to give up its dead amen when the sun the spring comes back in line with the Earth again it actually forces death to give up its dead to a resurrection what a restoration restore again what does it the sun coming that's it that's that's right God's law that's right amen I told you this was a long quote that's all right good I kept wanting to cut it off and then I'd read down the next paragraph and I was like that's just as good as the last I'll keep this one cut that one off well that don't make sense God set the Earth in law gravitation law everything in nature Works according to God's law everything in nature Works according to God's law and the flower served its term the seed served its term it died into the Earth and then there was a restoration now it's laying there dead that's not a thing we could take one of these here lights like this and turn it on it would never do any good there's no way for us to do it but God has a law and when the sun comes into the seed it forces that life out of the seed and death can't hold it anymore amen God has set all of his laws to serve him that's it amen this is why I was going back even levitical law my brother and sister the law of Moses was not to bring judgment to the people it was to bring them to a place to serve him that's it but they already had a grudge against Moses and they didn't view this as God's law even today the Torah calls it Moses's law that's right that's where they went wrong let me step away out on a limb this morning if we think this is William branham's message we've missed it just like they missed Moses's law this is God's word to a bride in this hour exactly amen I thank God every day for the message that brother Brandon brought to us my brother and sister but the people who believe it belong to him want to copyright it to his name or do whatever they want to do they have missed the point just like Israel did they give credit in the wrong place they give criticism in the wrong place my oh my it forces the Life Death can't hold it that's right God said all of his laws to serve him both natural and spiritual working according to his word regardless come on listen to us Saints listen to me young people anyone with the trouble today listen regardless of the conditions amen I love that I had a scripture here on that yes sir God sets all of his laws in motions think of it let us soak in now because we're coming to a healing service in a few minutes see God set all of his laws in motion that it must work according to his own word amen well you know there's some things in the message I I I can't accept I'm going to step away from the message and I I'm going to just follow the word I'm going to just stick with the word well my brother and sister if you got a real seed it'll bring you right back around because there's only one seed there's only one law there's only one word that's come forth God doesn't have a multitude of it and either lines up or it doesn't and I'm here to tell you today it does that's right amen that's right absolutely amen amen God has set his Laws and Motion must work according to his own word are you getting it yes sir see his word his laws has to work according to his word He commands the sun he commanded the moon he commanded the Earth he commanded nature and they all fall right in line and all the laws work in harmony with God's spoken word and the law of life that's it could we possibly read that line together yes sir oh my yeah amen wow Hallelujah my heart just melts amen my heart just literally is melting and the law of life that's in us will also bring us to a resurrection Hallelujah I have fought for years I want to make myself ready I got to make myself ready and wake up one day with a revelation that's it if I just believe the word it's all going to fall in line for me that's it amen we have a part to play we can't just sit back and you know eat popcorn and put our feet up but you see that labor that I can make something happen it's gone that's it I just just have to embrace the word amen Embrace that life oh my I tell you what my brother and sister just my heart just melts when I think about this he promised to bring me into a resurrection amen that's it it's not what I'm going to do to get there Hallelujah he just promised Hallelujah Paul I'm going to take you it's got to it's impossible for it not hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord that's the reason the law of life that was in Christ when the word was spoke he said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in Hell there wasn't enough time there wasn't enough Devils there wasn't enough anything to keep Christ in that grave till he his body began to rot because the law of God would bring the word to pass and the law of God by the Holy Spirit brings any promise to pass you get it regardless of the condition yes sir job said though the skin worms destroys my body yet my flesh I'll see God regardless oh I love this this is why I could not this is one of those I was saying I can't cut it off here I can't cut it off look what it says right here well I got to keep going I got to get to this point regardless of how little we are how low we are how impure pure we are how Unholy we are how sick we are how Afflicted we are the law of God's spirit by his word makes it obey him forces the issue and says give it back am amen amen oh if we could just think of that for a minute forces it regardless of conditions no matter what the condition is the law of God's word forces a condition to cope with his word see it's got to oh my brother and sister my heart just melts because I tell you I don't care who you are what position you have attained in life we still have the battle with this flesh and the word of God says I'll take you through it just
