[27:28] amen just to realize that God would come
[27:31] down and meet us and
[27:34] um we once again want to look at this
[27:37] and let's turn our Bibles to acts the
[27:41] eighth chapter brother Trevor sister
[27:43] Kerry not well
[27:46] okay
[27:51] let's remember Sister Carrie and brother
[27:53] Trevor for strength amen
[27:57] chapter starting with verse 26.
[28:01] and um
[28:03] I have verse 40 here but we'll just see
[28:06] where we end up
[28:08] amen now I love this my brother and
[28:11] sister because through the scripture we
[28:13] we see times and places
[28:18] now when an angel of the Lord comes my
[28:20] brother and sister
[28:22] it is not a lesser message
[28:25] than God himself
[28:28] it is absolutely lip to ear from
[28:31] almighty God to us
[28:34] and so as we look at this and an angel
[28:36] of the Lord spake unto Philip saying
[28:40] arise and go toward the South and to the
[28:43] way that goeth down from Jerusalem into
[28:45] Gaza which is Desert and he arose and
[28:49] went and behold a man of Ethiopia a
[28:52] eunuch of great Authority Under Candace
[28:55] Queen of the Ethiopians who had the
[28:58] charge of all her treasure This truly is
[29:01] an important man
[29:02] and had come to Jerusalem for to worship
[29:06] now brother Branham says that he had
[29:09] come God brought him there for the day
[29:10] of Pentecost
[29:13] so we're not talking about a man who had
[29:15] come just with a remote interest in
[29:17] religion
[29:18] this was a man who had a burning desire
[29:21] to know God
[29:25] was returning and sitting in his Chariot
[29:27] read Isaias the prophet then the spirit
[29:31] said unto Philip go near and join
[29:34] thyself to this Chariot and Philip ran
[29:38] there to him and heard him read the
[29:41] prophet Isaiah saying understandeth thou
[29:44] what thou readest
[29:47] and he said how can I
[29:49] except some man should guide me
[29:53] and he desired Philip that he would come
[29:55] up and sit with him
[29:58] and the place of the scripture which he
[30:00] read was this he was led as a sheep to
[30:03] the slaughter and like a lamb dumb
[30:06] before his sheer so opened he not his
[30:10] mouth
[30:11] in his humiliation his judgment was
[30:14] taken away
[30:15] and who shall declare his generation for
[30:19] his life was taken from the Earth
[30:21] and the eunuch answered Philip and said
[30:24] I pray thee
[30:26] of whom speaketh the Prophet this
[30:30] of himself or some other man
[30:34] then Philip opened his mouth and began
[30:37] at the same scripture and preached unto
[30:40] him Jesus and as they went on their way
[30:43] they came unto a certain water and the
[30:46] eunuch said see
[30:48] here is water what doth hinder me
[30:52] to be baptized and Philip said if thou
[30:55] believe us with all thine heart thou
[30:58] mayest and he answered and said I
[31:01] believe that Jesus Christ is a son of
[31:04] God
[31:05] and he commanded the Chariot to stand
[31:08] still and they went down both into the
[31:10] water both Philip and the eunuch and he
[31:13] baptized him and when they were come up
[31:15] out of the water the spirit of the lord
[31:17] caught away Philip that the eunuch saw
[31:20] him no more and he went on his way
[31:22] rejoicing
[31:24] but Philip was found
[31:27] I'm not sure how to pronounce that word
[31:29] I was going to look it up but zodus
[31:32] passing through preached in all the
[31:35] cities till he come to caesarea Heavenly
[31:38] Father we ask you Lord just to come and
[31:41] speak to us tonight and lord it's our
[31:43] hearts desire father
[31:46] Lord we see so many things happening
[31:48] around us
[31:50] father Maybe
[31:52] it hasn't changed maybe it's just our
[31:55] attention has been drawn
[31:57] but Lord it sure seems to me that you
[32:00] are moving upon your people
[32:02] to draw them into a higher realm to draw
[32:06] them into a higher place to make father
[32:09] even as that Lord graduation of our
[32:13] brother Gideon father to make us aware
[32:15] we need to live right for the moment
[32:18] not looking to the Future not looking
[32:21] down the road but to live in the moment
[32:23] for how quickly our life can change
[32:26] Lord we ask that you would change our
[32:29] lives father
[32:30] and Lord we don't want to be slothful so
[32:32] we ask you Lord come quickly
[32:35] let your word come upon us anoint us
[32:38] Lord for our lives to be corrected
[32:41] Lord or for our lives to be lifted up
[32:43] and edified before you father not in
[32:46] days or weeks or months to come but now
[32:49] Lord
[32:50] we ask you to bless this time in the
[32:52] name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[32:55] seated
[32:58] I certainly would ask you to pray
[33:01] not as it is just for
[33:04] uh the retief family
[33:08] but
[33:09] sister Jerry and I was very blessed to
[33:11] spend time
[33:13] with the youngest
[33:15] of brother Gideon's grandchildren
[33:19] and I don't say this to bring emotion on
[33:22] you but I I've share this with you to
[33:25] realize it's not just Lord bring them
[33:27] comfort
[33:29] but the youngest grandchild Gareth
[33:37] was at the scene of the accident
[33:42] crying out to God
[33:46] raise up my grandpa raise up my grandpa
[33:50] Lord raise up my grandpa
[33:53] that young man's heart
[33:56] is
[33:57] completely broken
[33:59] we need to remember Gareth in prayer
[34:03] amen I don't believe it was an undue
[34:08] Vision review he had of his grandfather
[34:12] but this young man
[34:14] lifted up loved adored his grandfather
[34:20] this is the kind of pain
[34:23] and that our family is experiencing
[34:26] amen
[34:30] let me get on Focus here every time I
[34:33] think about these things I start to cry
[34:40] as we are reading this scripture
[34:43] my thoughts go my brother and sister how
[34:46] that God always works
[34:48] in the realm
[34:50] of the supernatural
[34:53] it is not that we expect to see some
[34:56] flashing of light and thunder and
[34:58] whatever it would be but my brother and
[35:01] sister whether we recognize it or not
[35:03] God veils himself in our everyday life
[35:06] he's right here with us and whenever God
[35:09] is dealing with you amen as God dealt
[35:12] with you this week spoke to your hearts
[35:13] just touched you when God is dealing
[35:16] with you do you realize that that is a
[35:19] supernatural event taking place and so
[35:23] as we look at this because our God is
[35:25] the god of the supernatural now the
[35:27] world out here believes they need to put
[35:30] God in the book of history and study him
[35:32] as a history book but my brother and
[35:35] sister we serve a risen savior that is
[35:38] truly Supernatural and so is God is uh
[35:42] dealing with us do not downplay that you
[35:45] know I I'm finding as I get a little
[35:47] older I wish that by God's grace this
[35:50] would have happened a few years before
[35:51] but it no doubt I'm the one that
[35:53] hindered it but my brothers and sisters
[35:55] we get down the road I start to be just
[35:58] a little more open and expressive about
[36:00] the fact that sometimes we get caught in
[36:03] a realm that we tend to downplay God
[36:06] like well the Lord was speaking to me
[36:08] well I don't mean really speaking to me
[36:10] I mean it was no my brother and sister
[36:12] don't downplay that that was God whether
[36:15] it was in your heart that he spoke or
[36:17] here in the mind that you comprehended
[36:19] God is speaking to his church amen
[36:22] speaking to his bride and we need to
[36:24] come to a place where we have confidence
[36:26] enough and display that confidence where
[36:28] our young people would say you know what
[36:30] when God's dealing with me I don't need
[36:32] to be ashamed I can stand up and say
[36:34] God's been speaking to me and and I
[36:37] believe this amen and so as you look at
[36:40] this and realize that the realm of the
[36:42] Supernatural is taking place around us
[36:45] each and every day and we don't always
[36:48] understand God's plan but we'll look at
[36:51] this and realize my brother and sister
[36:52] that that truly Our God's plans are
[36:55] perfect and so is God is veiling himself
[36:58] in our everyday lives they realize that
[37:01] our day-to-day life is a supernatural
[37:03] event taking place and if you want just
[37:06] a little a very low-key example of a
[37:09] supernatural event taking place we'll
[37:12] look at this and look at the scriptural
[37:14] definition of the demons that have been
[37:17] turned loose in the day that we live in
[37:19] and anyone that has been around it all
[37:22] recognizing the oppressive spirit that
[37:25] is building up in not just our nation
[37:27] but the world and so you see this
[37:30] outpouring of these demonic spirits my
[37:32] brother and sister they're overpowering
[37:35] they're causing what you would call Sane
[37:37] people and causing them to do crazy
[37:40] things even to taking of lives into
[37:43] different things like that and you
[37:45] realize that the supernatural event
[37:47] taking place today is the Hedge as a
[37:50] word that God has put around you and I
[37:52] he said I would raise up a standard my
[37:55] brother and sister we don't need to look
[37:57] for a wall being built up we need to
[37:59] look and realize the Holy Ghost is here
[38:01] and it is sufficient for our present
[38:04] need amen as it is we have the answer to
[38:08] the devil's question and so we don't
[38:11] need to be ashamed of that we need to
[38:13] stand on the word and say thank you Lord
[38:15] for a supernatural event taking to place
[38:19] today amen and so is this a supernatural
[38:22] events are taking place now look at this
[38:25] the prophet of God emphasizes this was
[38:28] not the holy ghost that come upon Philip
[38:30] my brother and sister he says Philip
[38:33] already had the Holy Ghost this was an
[38:36] angel of the Lord amen let's not be
[38:40] mistaken that there was just a little
[38:41] stirring as it were in Philip's Spirit
[38:44] to go and do this but it literally was
[38:47] an angel of the Lord moving in the midst
[38:51] of a Philip as speaking to him now I
[38:55] just want to throw this in in the world
[38:57] we live in today there's many critics
[38:59] say well William Branham Angel of the
[39:01] Lord waiting for this that's all just
[39:03] some strange Hocus Pocus well my brother
[39:05] and sister my Bible said he's the same
[39:07] yesterday today and forever and God sent
[39:11] an angel of the Lord down to Philip God
[39:13] can send an angel of the Lord anywhere
[39:16] he pleases
[39:17] I don't care what their theological
[39:20] understanding says I don't care what
[39:23] their words of the Greek and this and
[39:26] that Arabic whatever means my brother
[39:28] and sister if God wants to send an angel
[39:30] God sends an angel and then God anoints
[39:33] Sons and Daughters of God to receive the
[39:35] message that an angel brings
[39:37] amen because what good would it do if
[39:39] God sent him Angel a messenger and
[39:42] there's no one to hear it
[39:44] and no one would obey it
[39:47] so we look at this and he tells them
[39:49] rise and go
[39:51] my brother and sister you realize how
[39:53] Divine this appointment is
[39:55] Philip doesn't know there's an Ethiopian
[39:57] on the road
[39:59] there's no one come along and told him
[40:00] but an angel
[40:02] and he gets up and now I want to bring
[40:04] this because we actually are a people of
[40:07] science did you realize that
[40:09] amen the prophet of God said that that
[40:13] man had broke into God's laboratory
[40:16] Laboratories are used for science
[40:19] so it's there that we are a people of
[40:22] science
[40:23] but we've got the original formula
[40:26] amen we don't need another formula we
[40:29] don't need a new modern version of this
[40:31] but it is there if you would just bear
[40:34] with me tonight to make the point amen a
[40:37] Divine appointment and so here is God
[40:39] putting in place the Ethiopians rate of
[40:42] travel velocity
[40:45] and he's taking now in Rising Philip up
[40:49] from a place obviously sitting or
[40:51] resting and he raises him up and God
[40:54] knows exactly my brother and sister by
[40:57] this formula where the Ethiopian and
[41:00] Philip are going to come together and
[41:02] you say brother Paul how do you figure
[41:05] this because there had to be a pool of
[41:08] water in a dry land
[41:10] and so God intersects this to come
[41:13] together Philip with a message Ethiopian
[41:16] with a hunger in his heart and a pool of
[41:19] water
[41:21] oh my brother and sister don't tell me
[41:23] God wasn't up there doesn't have that he
[41:25] can go up there the X and the Y and the
[41:27] this and that and whatever only he don't
[41:29] need to take a pencil and wave his arm
[41:31] it's just there and he speaks it and he
[41:34] gets Philip up and sends him on his way
[41:37] now I believe if we could study history
[41:39] far enough we'll find that this
[41:41] Ethiopian has already made great
[41:43] progress in his journey but he's coming
[41:46] down my brother and sister without
[41:47] realizing it to a Divine appointment in
[41:51] a supernatural event oh I say Lord let
[41:55] us have a Divine appointment in a
[41:58] supernatural event don't let us be home
[42:00] when we should be in the house of God
[42:02] don't let us be absent-minded when we
[42:04] should be focused Lord don't let us be
[42:06] distracted when we should be looking
[42:09] with intensity
[42:11] oh my brother and sister
[42:15] so as we look at this
[42:17] if you were a naval officer you would
[42:19] say I could take a Sextant that I could
[42:21] took and take and look at the Horizon
[42:23] look at the stars look at this and I can
[42:25] then Mark a mark on a map which is
[42:28] amazingly accurate
[42:32] and how much more
[42:34] that God would come down into
[42:37] Supernatural and be able to mark the
[42:40] time and the place and everyone who
[42:43] should be involved and where it should
[42:45] happen I say thank you Lord amen the
[42:49] Lord dealing with us is no accident my
[42:51] brother and sister God did not
[42:53] accidentally bring you to church tonight
[42:55] God did not kind of just stumble along
[42:57] and kind of give a little influence to
[43:00] you well could I should I no my brother
[43:02] and sister God knows what he's doing
[43:04] amen and so we see Philip he rises and
[43:08] goes and he meets this Ethiopian now
[43:11] this unit my brother and sister is a man
[43:13] of great Authority the word says that he
[43:16] has charge of all of Queen Candace's
[43:19] wealth her treasure
[43:22] I mean that's pretty important man
[43:27] but do you realize that everyone is
[43:30] equally important to God
[43:33] doesn't look and say oh that's a queen
[43:35] she's higher than you
[43:38] that's a king you're underneath
[43:41] God looks down and says that's sons and
[43:43] daughters and I'm telling you my brother
[43:46] and sister of the first level oh I don't
[43:48] know how to say this of the first level
[43:50] of genealogy
[43:52] always comes down
[43:55] Sons
[43:57] and daughters
[43:59] you don't find Sons and Daughters lifted
[44:02] listed after fourth fifth tenth cousins
[44:05] they're always right there at the top
[44:08] so God is moving in such a fashion that
[44:10] as this uh Ethiopian is is going along
[44:14] there uh you know it is that way that
[44:18] God uses
[44:21] the prophet shows us so clearly we could
[44:23] take it out of scripture we can take it
[44:25] from the prophet however you desire to
[44:28] do it but I'm just going to speak it to
[44:30] you tonight everyone the scripture says
[44:32] everyone that hungers and thirsts after
[44:35] righteousness
[44:41] shall be found
[44:45] see I'm going to confuse you a little
[44:47] bit
[44:49] it is true
[44:53] because there's only one place we find
[44:55] the satisfaction of the Soul
[44:58] and the prophet of God says we never
[45:00] sought him he sought us
[45:03] so we're hungering and thirsting I don't
[45:05] mean to confuse anybody whatever I just
[45:06] want to lay this out in another little
[45:08] fashion every one of us in our position
[45:10] we are found I'm hungry and God found me
[45:16] amen my soul needs satisfied and God
[45:19] brought the word to me amen so I didn't
[45:23] go to him oh I went to church either no
[45:25] my brother and sister it's God who has
[45:28] found us and it's in our time of need so
[45:31] I say this this Ethiopian traveling down
[45:34] the road it was not anything to do with
[45:37] when he left and how far he would travel
[45:39] that day and what ability or the
[45:41] endurance of his horses or whatever it
[45:43] would be an endurance of the human
[45:45] element God said I have appointed the
[45:48] time to come to you
[45:50] it was never never Philip never the
[45:54] Ethiopian but God said I've appointed
[45:56] this time and I will find you in the
[45:59] desert don't you love the symbolism as
[46:01] it were of that not in a lush easy place
[46:04] let's go over here and pick a
[46:05] pomegranate let's go sit over here in
[46:07] the shade let's do this but God met him
[46:09] and every one of us has come to a
[46:10] supernatural event in the desert
[46:13] in the drive time of our life we've met
[46:16] God and he come to us why because there
[46:18] was something down inside of us that was
[46:22] saying I don't know this world has to
[46:24] offer my brother and sister as I've
[46:26] shared there's testimonies around the
[46:28] message people sitting on a bar stool
[46:30] there's a brother back to East I won't
[46:32] be any more specific than that and he
[46:34] taught he shared with me I I preached in
[46:37] their church and by God's grace a lovely
[46:39] service and he comes to me and he said I
[46:41] want to share my testimony briefly
[46:43] brother Paul I was sitting on a bar
[46:45] stool been born and raised in the
[46:48] message walked away from it in business
[46:51] making good money sitting in a bar stool
[46:54] and somebody said God's not real and he
[46:57] said I've gone up slam my beer on the
[46:59] counter and said let me tell you
[47:02] and then he walked out of there angry
[47:04] and when he got out the door he was like
[47:07] what did I just say
[47:09] and behind that come the words I believe
[47:12] that
[47:13] and it turned his life around
[47:16] oh I'll tell you what my brother and
[47:18] sister why would we even bother to put a
[47:21] limitation on God
[47:23] why even let the devil bring that to our
[47:26] lips a limitation on our God
[47:30] Hallelujah
[47:32] so here's a man with a hunger and he's
[47:35] going along
[47:36] in his Chariot and it's reading aloud
[47:40] maybe my brother and sister he was
[47:42] reading aloud so that his servants would
[47:44] hear also or maybe that's just a value
[47:49] that he recognized hearing it with his
[47:52] own ears
[47:53] now I prefer myself to believe that
[47:57] reading aloud has a certain
[47:58] characteristic to it that has an impact
[48:01] on us and I just share just sorry to
[48:04] bring it back to my own life but many
[48:05] years ago sitting in church sister Jerry
[48:08] just Faithful is faithful with the
[48:09] children in church and you know me
[48:11] wavering in and out and in and out God
[48:14] dealing with me amen and one day as it
[48:17] were my Chariot come to a halt amen and
[48:19] God start dealing with me and I realized
[48:22] my problem was is I didn't believe it
[48:24] enough to say it out loud but in my
[48:26] heart my heart said I believe
[48:29] and I found myself standing behind a pig
[48:32] shed one night doing chores and speaking
[48:35] out loud to the stars in heaven Lord I
[48:37] believe
[48:42] and then I had to start working on Amen
[48:47] but by God's grace I broke through that
[48:49] barrier
[48:51] that had been placed there
[48:53] and as that happened I started to be
[48:55] able to sit in church this might not
[48:57] seem like a great significance my
[48:58] brother and sister but I'm telling you
[49:00] in some places and sometimes the
[49:03] question asked to you that is ask you
[49:06] demands an answer out loud
[49:12] in the military you're never allowed to
[49:14] nod your head
[49:17] Soldier is this weapon ready
[49:21] no sir I I sir
[49:25] hmm
[49:27] what if we changed ourselves
[49:29] our our
[49:31] perspective
[49:33] and looked at it and said God wants an
[49:34] answer from me
[49:37] not a nodding of my head
[49:39] not a wave of my hand
[49:42] he wants to hear my voice amen speak
[49:46] amen amen
[49:52] now look this anointing that was on
[49:54] Philip was not to just say I went down
[49:56] on the road to Gaza and there was an
[49:58] Ethiopian there and I yelled at him you
[49:59] need Jesus Christ
[50:02] you know like people in the
[50:03] intersections and the cities they got a
[50:05] little a little sandwich board or
[50:07] whatever and they stand the intersection
[50:08] almost getting run over and they're
[50:10] yelling at the cars that go by you need
[50:12] Jesus
[50:15] but God said that isn't what I want you
[50:17] to do Philip I want you Philip to go
[50:19] near I want you to get right over there
[50:21] where this gentleman can look at you and
[50:24] recognize something sense something
[50:26] about you and he gets right over there
[50:29] very near hey man I'm kind of thinking
[50:31] my brother and sister that near must
[50:33] have been about in the middle of the
[50:34] road
[50:35] amen not often the bushes somewhere
[50:38] yelling at him as he went by but in the
[50:40] middle of the road and there it is that
[50:42] now he is present in this man's life and
[50:46] and I'm not trying to take Liberty
[50:48] tonight but I want to stretch these
[50:49] boundaries just a little bit amen you
[50:52] know it's not enough just to wave over
[50:54] the fence at your neighbor maybe
[50:55] sometimes you need to draw nearer to
[50:57] that neighbor you need to come right
[50:59] down where that neighbor can look eyes
[51:01] on you and he can see there's something
[51:03] about this family next door that's
[51:05] different amen now if they don't care to
[51:08] know why you're different you can't
[51:10] knock their fence down
[51:12] but my brother and sister are often
[51:14] times The World Is Still Desiring
[51:16] they're hungering they don't know where
[51:19] to find it they've been to this church
[51:22] and this church and this church and this
[51:24] church they don't know where to find it
[51:27] and it's there at the point that they
[51:29] would assume that all churches are the
[51:31] same God put you in the neighborhood and
[51:34] he calls you to come right down there
[51:36] and draw nigh to them draw near to them
[51:39] and so as it is he's standing there very
[51:41] near
[51:43] amen
[51:45] Philip doesn't shaunt her over there
[51:48] he ran to him
[51:51] and he heard
[51:53] him reading the prophet isaiahs
[51:56] and here's another thing I think
[51:58] sometimes this might be just you can
[51:59] just put it down to opinion so that way
[52:01] you toss it out it's just fine you don't
[52:03] have to be guilty
[52:04] but many times my brother and sister our
[52:08] first words are positive pointed
[52:11] statements
[52:13] but what did Philip do
[52:16] understandeth
[52:18] what thou readeth
[52:21] you see the Ethiopian didn't see him as
[52:24] any form of adversary
[52:26] he almost will look down and says maybe
[52:28] this guy's as confused as I am maybe he
[52:31] doesn't understand it either and maybe
[52:33] we could have a dialogue so he wanted he
[52:36] wanted Philip to come up in the Chariot
[52:38] because now hey this is a this is a good
[52:41] discussion I don't think you run all of
[52:43] The Treasure of the queen without being
[52:45] a pretty smart guy
[52:47] I don't think that you're going to
[52:48] graduate into that position without
[52:50] understanding how to lead people and how
[52:54] to deal with situations and have problem
[52:56] resolution and and have a vision and and
[53:00] a kind of you might say an open mind to
[53:02] uh grasp the concepts and so it's there
[53:05] that he invites Philip to The Chariot
[53:08] and he says you know what I can't even I
[53:12] can't even uh figure this out I'm not
[53:14] going to figure this out there's no way
[53:16] for me to figure this out lest some Man
[53:19] shows me now I want you to catch the
[53:21] contrast of the world we're living in
[53:23] today we don't want anyone to tell us
[53:27] anything
[53:30] but here's a man of great Authority
[53:35] saying how can I know
[53:37] last some man he didn't say unless some
[53:41] Supernatural
[53:43] event takes place
[53:47] no sir
[53:48] what he didn't know at that time was the
[53:50] supernatural had already taken place
[53:51] when God the angel of the Lord tells
[53:54] Philip come on get up and go find this
[53:57] man there was a supernatural element
[53:59] taking place and this man is here honest
[54:02] opening heart very clear saying you know
[54:05] what I want to know but I don't know how
[54:07] unless somebody would tell me and so God
[54:10] opens this door and I'm telling you my
[54:12] brother and sister when God opens the
[54:13] door for you to speak that blunt to
[54:15] people you better have the courage Lord
[54:17] help me too Amen to speak amen that God
[54:20] knows what he's doing my brother and
[54:22] sister
[54:23] and so he goes and he starts to speak to
[54:26] me he says you know what how can I
[54:28] except some man should guide me now this
[54:31] man is not going to force him
[54:33] this man is not going to tell him what
[54:35] to do and then just leave him but this
[54:38] is the key that Philip is there and
[54:41] Philip is going under the leadership of
[54:43] the holy spirit amen Angel of the Lord
[54:45] speaking to him he comes down there and
[54:47] he is now going to just be
[54:51] guide
[54:54] non-religious Authority
[54:56] not a man demanding of what he should or
[54:59] should not do
[55:01] right
[55:03] there's a song says
[55:05] he leads his dear children along
[55:09] it doesn't say he hurts them
[55:13] or drags them
[55:15] he leads them
[55:18] what is it we have the perfect guide
[55:19] Saints amen we have the perfect guide
[55:23] oh my oh my oh my we have the perfect
[55:27] God and so it's there uh you look at
[55:31] that and he says okay Philip I gotta
[55:33] head myself a minute to go there he
[55:35] desired Philip come up and sit with him
[55:38] and I'm telling you Saints tonight I I
[55:40] hope you don't mind that I'm just a
[55:42] little excited about this but I thank
[55:44] the Lord for Holy Ghost leadership
[55:46] amen there's men that have come into my
[55:50] life through the years and maybe the
[55:53] season didn't look so good we had a
[55:55] pastor once here in the valley I treated
[55:58] him just lower than dirt and I'm ashamed
[56:00] of that but I'm telling you I look back
[56:02] through my life and see the impact that
[56:05] man had on my life he was there
[56:07] constantly when I was rude to him he
[56:10] always come back with with kindness he
[56:13] always come back with Grace and and you
[56:15] know God give me an opportunity many
[56:17] many many years ago to to make it right
[56:20] with him and you know as I'm looking at
[56:23] him and standing there crying as a grown
[56:25] man crying looking while I was in my 30s
[56:29] I don't know if I was grown man or not
[56:32] I was working on it though
[56:36] and I said forgive me brother
[56:39] you know what his response was
[56:43] your bum but I knew God would do
[56:45] something with you
[56:47] know his answer was brother Paul
[56:51] I always knew
[56:53] God would work in your life amen and I
[56:58] knew that you would come
[57:02] then I was Marvel how'd you know this
[57:06] because it was something
[57:08] that spoke to him
[57:11] not a carnal voice
[57:13] something in the word
[57:16] and I I just I'm so appreciative my
[57:19] brother and sister I can't even I'm just
[57:22] my world got turned upside down this
[57:24] last few days
[57:26] it's maybe brought out the chemical
[57:28] reaction of emotion striking neurons
[57:30] which causes your tear ducts to open
[57:37] or a supernatural
[57:40] event
[57:42] you know it's pretty easy to get just a
[57:44] tad bit callus
[57:46] just attend it
[57:48] not enough to feel like we're
[57:50] disrespectful or anything but
[57:53] just enough
[57:54] and then God sends something in your
[57:56] life
[57:58] did I tell you about that reaction that
[58:01] strikes the neurons
[58:04] or a supernatural event
[58:07] and God comes down and says you just
[58:09] need a little tenderizing
[58:11] and I want you to know when God
[58:13] tenderizes his doesn't look like a
[58:14] mallet with little spikes or little
[58:16] pyramids on top of it that's not God's
[58:18] idea of tenderizing
[58:20] so as it is my brother and sister I got
[58:22] to stay on track tonight amen so he's
[58:25] there saying I don't know about this man
[58:27] I just want to say tonight lift my hand
[58:29] and say thank you Lord for Holy Ghost
[58:30] leadership
[58:31] amen that the power of God would come
[58:33] down to where we are amen and thank you
[58:36] for men and women that will listen to
[58:38] the voice of God amen amen it's just
[58:42] it's a beautiful thing to see this take
[58:44] place so he he's led by the spirit spoke
[58:47] to go join yourself he starts his
[58:50] witness with a question
[58:52] amen versus a statement
[58:55] and then
[58:57] when he asked this
[58:59] he sets back and gives
[59:02] this
[59:03] Ethiopian eunuch he gives him time
[59:07] to you might say formulate his answer
[59:11] he doesn't throw any yes or no's at him
[59:14] he just throws it out there for the man
[59:16] to be able to speak from his heart and
[59:18] say you know what I I don't know how I
[59:20] could unless someone would help me and
[59:24] what that was as he's speaking he's not
[59:26] actually speaking see this whole time my
[59:28] brother and sister he's not actually
[59:30] speaking to Philip
[59:32] everything that Philip is speaking and
[59:35] every response spoken by is not to
[59:38] Philip Philip is the vessel and I want
[59:41] you for just a moment to turn Philip
[59:43] into nothing more than a giant jug that
[59:47] contains the the a spirit of God
[59:50] contains the wine amen the new wine is
[59:53] Hope Philip's nothing more than a joke
[59:55] but this man don't recognize it and so
[59:57] it is as he's speaking to Philip God is
[1:00:00] then anointing Philip to pour out a
[1:00:02] little more only he's not pouring out
[1:00:05] Philip
[1:00:06] he's pouring out the words the very
[1:00:08] Spirit the very nature the very life of
[1:00:11] our God Amen and so is it is there
[1:00:14] tipping the the vassal and pouring out
[1:00:16] just a little bit more it wasn't
[1:00:19] quenching to the hunger of this man I
[1:00:22] want you to catch this he didn't quench
[1:00:24] the hunger of that man
[1:00:27] it increased it
[1:00:29] amen as this is poured out to him it is
[1:00:32] increasing his hunger in other words a
[1:00:34] few words of the Gospel will not satisfy
[1:00:38] him
[1:00:39] and I've heard people say well just a
[1:00:41] little bit of the Gospel will just do
[1:00:43] the job I'm telling you my brother and
[1:00:45] sister the word of God says it's an
[1:00:47] inexhaustible Supply and God would not
[1:00:49] give us an inexhaustible Supply so that
[1:00:52] we would sip at it amen he wants to pour
[1:00:55] it out and we are drinking it up amen
[1:00:58] and it's becoming the very life and the
[1:01:00] Very nature of us and he wants us to
[1:01:03] take a bigger drink and a bigger drink
[1:01:05] and a bigger drink amen and while we
[1:01:08] will be satisfied to quit searching as
[1:01:11] it were for the world out there my
[1:01:12] brother and sister don't any let anybody
[1:01:15] fool you that you're going to just come
[1:01:16] to the place there's a difference
[1:01:18] between being satisfied and being filled
[1:01:20] amen we can be filled with the spirit
[1:01:22] right go back many refillings but
[1:01:25] there's still a Hunger for More Of God
[1:01:28] the prophet of God shows us and says
[1:01:31] even shows us how even in heaven
[1:01:33] there'll still be a hunger but we'll
[1:01:35] satisfy it by standing and being and
[1:01:38] worshiping in the prayer presence of God
[1:01:40] not that we got to sip and we go off and
[1:01:43] ignore him for a month or two or many it
[1:01:46] don't work that way
[1:01:47] Hallelujah
[1:01:49] so as he starts to speak to him
[1:01:52] amen I want to read to you out of a
[1:01:54] quote here hear ye him
[1:01:56] see so you see that it doesn't take
[1:02:00] great big things to bring Christ it
[1:02:02] doesn't take great organization neither
[1:02:05] does it take great churches great
[1:02:07] Gathering but it takes a sincerity of
[1:02:11] one heart to bring him and I think in
[1:02:14] the Bible when Philip was having a great
[1:02:16] healing campaign and the Holy Ghost Holy
[1:02:19] Spirit called him from his campaign and
[1:02:22] went into the desert to meet one
[1:02:24] Ethiopian oh it don't even make sense
[1:02:27] look at the success we could have had
[1:02:30] Philip if you had stayed here in town
[1:02:32] kept the stadium full kept the people
[1:02:35] engaged talked to them it would have
[1:02:37] been but God saw the hunger of one
[1:02:40] Ethiopian in a backside of a desert and
[1:02:44] said I will satisfy that sincere hunger
[1:02:49] to lead him to a saving knowledge of the
[1:02:52] Lord Jesus
[1:02:53] you see my brother and sister you can
[1:02:55] fill the building but how many will be
[1:02:57] filled when they leave the building
[1:02:59] there's the difference right there
[1:03:02] and it's a human nature to worry about
[1:03:04] filling the building
[1:03:06] but what we want to do is see those that
[1:03:09] were there filled when they leave the
[1:03:10] building
[1:03:11] Hallelujah
[1:03:13] and so we see here
[1:03:15] that he starts to read to him or speak
[1:03:18] to him and referencing the scripture he
[1:03:21] was led as a sheep to the slaughter and
[1:03:24] like a lamb dumb before his sheer so
[1:03:28] open not
[1:03:30] he not his mouth
[1:03:33] you know there's some theologians
[1:03:38] I don't know exactly what all these
[1:03:41] terms might be
[1:03:47] there's theologians in the day that we
[1:03:49] live in
[1:03:51] actually so Brazen to declare that
[1:03:55] Jesus just didn't speak because you know
[1:03:58] basically they would just hold it
[1:04:00] against him and you know kind of like
[1:04:02] they read the riots today you know
[1:04:04] anything you say can and will be used
[1:04:05] against you in the court of law
[1:04:08] so Jesus just
[1:04:10] chose to be silent
[1:04:13] that ain't what that scripture just said
[1:04:15] is it
[1:04:17] he was silent
[1:04:19] to fulfill the word of God amen amen
[1:04:28] that wouldn't fit most of us most of us
[1:04:30] would be their hey officer you're asking
[1:04:32] the wrong guy I'm innocent you do this
[1:04:34] I'm calling my lawyer I want my one free
[1:04:36] phone call and I don't know
[1:04:40] Jesus is silent anointed
[1:04:44] fulfilling the word
[1:04:49] might have been easy my brother and
[1:04:51] sister to have called them white at
[1:04:52] walls and pointed out very clearly you
[1:04:56] know just as those he met that day with
[1:04:58] the woman he could have just started
[1:04:59] telling them
[1:05:01] well you sir
[1:05:04] and this is what you have done have you
[1:05:07] confessed that to the priest
[1:05:12] he could have defuse them
[1:05:16] poured water as it were on their powder
[1:05:19] there was no bang left when he started
[1:05:22] to tell him the sin and the things of
[1:05:24] their life
[1:05:25] but that didn't fulfill the word
[1:05:30] absolute silence is what fulfilled the
[1:05:33] word
[1:05:35] and the world mocked him for that as
[1:05:37] though he had nothing to say
[1:05:39] the critics would mock him even to our
[1:05:42] present day for not having anything to
[1:05:44] say
[1:05:46] but the word
[1:05:48] had already said it amen now I want to
[1:05:51] lay this little point just briefly I
[1:05:53] don't get sidetracked my brother and
[1:05:54] sister there's times for us to be silent
[1:05:56] because the word has already spoken
[1:06:00] people say well I just got into this
[1:06:03] deal to defend the message
[1:06:06] the scripture has already spoken
[1:06:09] no amount of words on your part
[1:06:12] will defend the message
[1:06:16] There's A Time For Us
[1:06:18] to be silent
[1:06:22] what made the difference
[1:06:24] even to the thief on the cross was not
[1:06:27] the words that were spoken but it was
[1:06:29] the presence of God
[1:06:32] him
[1:06:34] takes a man where he can say he's
[1:06:37] innocent
[1:06:38] be silent over there be in he's innocent
[1:06:43] there's no sin found in him we we
[1:06:46] deserve this but not him
[1:06:49] and you know it's kind of a tricky
[1:06:52] conversation when we should speak
[1:06:55] and when we should be silent
[1:06:58] God give us wisdom
[1:07:00] God give us wisdom
[1:07:07] let me hurry right along here
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:11] so he's verse 32 he's talking about he
[1:07:14] takes him the scriptures LED as a sheep
[1:07:16] to the slaughter now let's turn to
[1:07:18] Isaiah 53 1-7 I believe this is just a
[1:07:22] very uh
[1:07:24] Fitting Place to go ahead and actually
[1:07:26] uh
[1:07:28] uh read the scripture that is being
[1:07:30] referenced here
[1:07:31] who hath believed our report and to whom
[1:07:35] is the arm of the Lord revealed
[1:07:37] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:07:40] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[1:07:43] ground for a hath no form nor comeliness
[1:07:46] and when we shall see him there is no
[1:07:49] beauty that we should desire him
[1:07:52] he is despised and rejected of men
[1:07:55] definitely would not make it
[1:07:57] on TBN
[1:08:01] that might seem like a dry statement to
[1:08:04] say but
[1:08:05] my brother and sister you understand the
[1:08:07] religious world today is half Hollywood
[1:08:09] the Prophet The Prophet spoke
[1:08:12] half Hollywood
[1:08:15] and half religion
[1:08:18] I read a little blip of a guy that was
[1:08:20] associated with TBN
[1:08:22] and he said you know for a spontaneous
[1:08:25] religion religious show it sure took us
[1:08:28] a long time to put their makeup on
[1:08:33] hmm
[1:08:38] despise rejected of men a Man of Sorrows
[1:08:40] and acquainted with grief and we hid as
[1:08:43] it were our faces from him
[1:08:46] it was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:08:49] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:08:51] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:08:54] him stricken you want to take this in
[1:08:57] context my brother and sister you can go
[1:08:59] back to Peter's Behavior
[1:09:01] amen several of the Apostles called upon
[1:09:04] deny him
[1:09:06] amen and many a person today who calls
[1:09:10] him Lord and savior
[1:09:12] denies him under pressure
[1:09:16] um
[1:09:17] oh no I'm not talking about a dungeon
[1:09:19] somewhere Saints I'm talking about the
[1:09:21] office at the water cooler
[1:09:31] yeah surely it's born our griefs carried
[1:09:34] our sorrows yet we did esteem him
[1:09:36] stricken smitten of God and Afflicted
[1:09:39] but he was wounded for our
[1:09:41] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:09:43] iniquities can we say Amen the
[1:09:45] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:09:47] and with his stripes we are healed I
[1:09:51] believe this is scripture we need to
[1:09:53] come to the place my brother and sister
[1:09:54] that we hold this very dear and all we
[1:09:58] like sheep have gone astray we have
[1:10:01] turned every one to his own way and the
[1:10:03] Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us
[1:10:08] all he was oppressed he was afflicted
[1:10:10] yet he opened not his mouth and he is
[1:10:14] brought as a lamb to the slaughter and
[1:10:16] as a sheep before her shears is before
[1:10:19] her Sears is dumb so he opened not his
[1:10:23] mouth now you look at this I'm believing
[1:10:26] my brother and sister that out there on
[1:10:28] that dry dusty road to Gaza we've been
[1:10:31] out there my brothers sister it's
[1:10:33] nothing but a desert Amen in modern
[1:10:36] times they've drilled big Wells and done
[1:10:38] different things but in those days my
[1:10:40] brother and sister you look at the
[1:10:41] landscape and realize that for Miles
[1:10:43] there's nothing
[1:10:47] and that's where God takes this takes
[1:10:49] this to take place
[1:10:51] and Philip anointed by the spirit
[1:10:53] amen following the leadership of a voice
[1:10:58] of an Angel
[1:10:59] starts to lay out who Jesus Christ is
[1:11:03] and all that pertain to him
[1:11:06] now this man my brother and sister was
[1:11:08] not dumb he was not foolish
[1:11:12] he was without knowledge
[1:11:14] right
[1:11:15] we can use the terms they're kind of
[1:11:17] blunt we can use the words is someone
[1:11:19] stupid that can be a connotation that
[1:11:22] they have an inability to learn but one
[1:11:24] who is ignorant is just lacking the
[1:11:26] knowledge my brother and sister are you
[1:11:27] with me go verify with that with Webster
[1:11:30] if you need to so you see he is there
[1:11:33] without this knowledge and as Philip is
[1:11:36] speaking to him a fire a light is coming
[1:11:39] on and a fire is kindling and he's then
[1:11:42] says okay this Prophet you're talking
[1:11:44] about recognizes as a prophet
[1:11:47] ma the kingpins of Israel didn't
[1:11:49] recognize him as a prophet as this this
[1:11:52] Prophet is he speaking of himself or
[1:11:55] someone else the writer now my brother
[1:11:57] and sister he's looking back to Isaiah
[1:12:01] now is Isaiah talking about Isaiah or is
[1:12:04] he talking about someone else
[1:12:07] oh my don't you wish that you got those
[1:12:09] kind of openings around the water cooler
[1:12:11] gas station grocery store wherever it
[1:12:14] was somebody would want to know what is
[1:12:16] the voice that is speaking in this day
[1:12:22] and then he lays all about our lord
[1:12:25] Jesus out before him now my brother and
[1:12:28] sister you'll find as this is done we
[1:12:30] don't know what the actual uh words in
[1:12:33] the text and everything that was there
[1:12:35] but as this goes along we will find that
[1:12:39] this man is coming to a place give such
[1:12:42] a Clarity to this Ethiopian of the
[1:12:46] message of the hour
[1:12:49] some of you know brother Kyle's
[1:12:51] testimony
[1:12:53] I got to visit with him for quite a
[1:12:55] while the other night
[1:12:57] he's a very enthusiastic
[1:13:00] amen just
[1:13:03] just has such a burning desire
[1:13:06] and he said now brother Paul I know this
[1:13:07] will take too long but I just want to
[1:13:09] share my testimony with you and I
[1:13:11] thought about it's like well if you take
[1:13:13] as long as I would take me then I'll
[1:13:16] I'll just wait for another day amen but
[1:13:18] we had this lovely time my brother and
[1:13:20] sister what happens when the word is
[1:13:22] given to you in the right way this man
[1:13:26] didn't say well I don't know about you
[1:13:28] but Matthew 28 19
[1:13:33] Brother Kyle faced family
[1:13:37] they're rejected not
[1:13:39] completely but in this sense
[1:13:42] you got it wrong boy
[1:13:44] but it was Revelation in him because God
[1:13:47] did the speaking
[1:13:50] amen and when it come down it's there my
[1:13:52] brother and sister this ethiopian's
[1:13:54] catching this he's like okay okay so now
[1:13:57] if this is the if this is the word and
[1:13:59] this is this and this is this this okay
[1:14:01] put this over here put that there and it
[1:14:04] says x times iPhone sometimes
[1:14:13] nobody had to beat him nobody had to say
[1:14:15] look you've been in the church for six
[1:14:16] years now and why aren't you about
[1:14:19] no sir there was Revelation struck him
[1:14:21] because this comes straight from the
[1:14:23] Throne of almighty God right to him and
[1:14:25] it's laid out and he says you know what
[1:14:27] I I I need to be baptized you know would
[1:14:30] there be some reason why I can't be uh
[1:14:32] baptized and and Philip you know says
[1:14:35] hey look if you are a real believer
[1:14:37] now I'm going to say this slightly
[1:14:39] different Philip did so just give me a
[1:14:41] little Grace if you're a real believer
[1:14:44] you will be baptized
[1:14:48] not you might or you'll think about it
[1:14:50] or you know surely it was good the first
[1:14:53] time it's just a matter of words no sir
[1:14:55] you'll desire to be baptized and so God
[1:14:59] is dealing now as he brings him to this
[1:15:02] place my brother and sister if we would
[1:15:04] spend more time I think preaching about
[1:15:06] Jesus and last time educating people
[1:15:08] about the message
[1:15:10] did I say that out loud
[1:15:13] uh oh
[1:15:15] I said that out loud
[1:15:21] you guys will forgive me right
[1:15:24] because I can prove it about a thousand
[1:15:26] ways over by scripture
[1:15:28] we're trying to educate people
[1:15:32] into a message
[1:15:36] how about
[1:15:38] a revelation
[1:15:45] oh my
[1:15:47] Saints I'll just tell you I'll just
[1:15:48] speak it blunt
[1:15:50] I've had people say well if you believe
[1:15:52] that explain it to me
[1:15:54] and God turned me
[1:15:57] mute is that right mute's not speaking
[1:16:02] God's turned me mute and I'm actually
[1:16:03] saying oh why can't I oh
[1:16:07] oh
[1:16:09] only to realize later
[1:16:12] it was exactly the right thing
[1:16:15] because someone
[1:16:16] wanted a paragraph by paragraph
[1:16:20] explanation
[1:16:21] of the message of the doctrines Etc of
[1:16:24] that and say well I'm a Believer explain
[1:16:27] it to me why can't you explain it
[1:16:31] because God didn't want me to explain it
[1:16:35] because you see once we have explained
[1:16:37] it
[1:16:39] theologically
[1:16:40] I'm getting ahead of myself let me just
[1:16:42] hurry amen
[1:16:44] that was a rabbit Trail
[1:16:46] excuse me
[1:16:48] so what this was my brother and sister
[1:16:50] is I skip over a couple things here this
[1:16:52] was a predestinated Son of God being
[1:16:55] revealed amen you say well well he was
[1:16:58] catching baptism and catching this
[1:17:00] revelation of who Jesus was my brother
[1:17:03] and sister that whole oh I know this is
[1:17:06] going to sound a little strange to you
[1:17:07] tonight but it was not Jesus Christ
[1:17:09] being revealed at that place our lord
[1:17:12] Jesus doesn't need to be revealed again
[1:17:14] he's already been revealed it's
[1:17:18] revealing the seed in the son or
[1:17:21] daughter of God Amen we don't need to
[1:17:24] re-crucify our lord Jesus we don't need
[1:17:27] to bring him to another Resurrection we
[1:17:29] don't need to take him up in a cloud my
[1:17:32] brother and sister and it's all been
[1:17:33] done we need to look to the revelation
[1:17:36] of the word of God revealing the son or
[1:17:39] daughter of God on the Earth today and
[1:17:41] if they have a theological Spirit on
[1:17:43] them a religious spirit they'll want you
[1:17:45] to explain that but if they have a c
[1:17:48] Gene of almighty God they will look at
[1:17:52] that and say I always knew there was
[1:17:55] something more there
[1:17:57] but the problem is if we educate them in
[1:18:00] we get them in the message but they've
[1:18:01] never ever got a revelation of who Jesus
[1:18:04] Christ was because they've never got a
[1:18:06] revelation of who they are and until
[1:18:08] they get a revelation of who they are
[1:18:10] they will not see themselves in the word
[1:18:13] of God
[1:18:16] but the minute you catch the the deal I
[1:18:19] don't care what happens I don't care if
[1:18:20] I fall I don't care if I got mud on my
[1:18:22] face I don't care if I wear the knees
[1:18:24] out of my britches crawling along like a
[1:18:26] beggar I'm a Son of God and God will
[1:18:29] Redeem Me
[1:18:31] Hallelujah those are the ones my brother
[1:18:33] sister that don't quit
[1:18:35] amen what is it
[1:18:37] there's no argument there's only amens
[1:18:41] well
[1:18:42] what did the prophet say
[1:18:44] he said Real Son of God will say Amen to
[1:18:49] every word of God and I don't mean to
[1:18:52] come across like I'm
[1:18:56] might have sounded
[1:18:59] but simply that's what happens
[1:19:01] a Believer says Amen to the word
[1:19:03] believer doesn't say well go get your
[1:19:06] Concordance
[1:19:07] I once you can take this and run it
[1:19:10] through prudence and this is man I can
[1:19:13] believe that no real believer something
[1:19:15] inside of them says that's the truth
[1:19:17] that's nothing but the truth
[1:19:21] so Philip tells him if you believe with
[1:19:24] all your heart
[1:19:25] now mayest and the answer said I believe
[1:19:27] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God can
[1:19:29] we say that tonight I believe that Jesus
[1:19:32] Christ is the son of God
[1:19:35] and so he commands The Chariot to stand
[1:19:37] still and they went down both into the
[1:19:39] water
[1:19:39] Philip and the eunuch and he baptized
[1:19:42] him
[1:19:43] and when they come up out of the water
[1:19:45] the spirit of the lord caught away
[1:19:47] Philip
[1:19:48] you know brother and sister we need to
[1:19:50] have a little more of this in our
[1:19:51] churches because the problem we have is
[1:19:54] we get to such a place now this can be
[1:19:57] hard for me to really explain very good
[1:19:58] so please grasp it it's we we come to a
[1:20:02] place that you'll find people that are
[1:20:04] like well this was Pastor he he led me
[1:20:07] to the Lord he baptized me and it's
[1:20:10] there it'd be good if some of those just
[1:20:12] disappeared out of your life
[1:20:14] all that was left was a revelation of
[1:20:17] Jesus Christ
[1:20:19] because see you're not pressing forward
[1:20:22] we're always waiting for the next word
[1:20:25] from Philip
[1:20:27] what is the next thing that Philip
[1:20:29] brother Philip has for us on Wednesday
[1:20:32] night
[1:20:33] what does brother Philip have for us
[1:20:35] during these special meetings
[1:20:38] what we need is get brother Philip out
[1:20:40] the presence of God the Holy Ghost in
[1:20:43] and it wouldn't matter who was up here
[1:20:45] speaking you'd walk out and say God
[1:20:47] spoke to me tonight
[1:20:49] amen God revealed himself to me tonight
[1:20:51] but you see my brother and sister I
[1:20:53] believe with all and you can find this
[1:20:55] if you want to spend a few hours
[1:20:56] studying not really that hard to find at
[1:20:58] all just to take you just a few hours
[1:21:00] but you look at this now the prophet of
[1:21:02] God ties this in and he says and so here
[1:21:05] is the eunuch and when he comes up out
[1:21:08] of the water Philip disappears and he's
[1:21:11] there now the unit under the spirit of
[1:21:13] the Lord
[1:21:15] he doesn't go I got to go back to
[1:21:17] Jerusalem I got to go wherever I got to
[1:21:18] find Philip no what does he do he's
[1:21:20] rejoicing it's back in the Chariot and
[1:21:23] starts heading to his house and his
[1:21:26] house is all the way down here in
[1:21:28] Ethiopia and by the time he gets down
[1:21:30] there he's so burning on fire that he
[1:21:33] doesn't just tell mama or daddy or wife
[1:21:35] or kitties he starts to tell Ethiopia
[1:21:38] amen he starts to let him know that
[1:21:40] Jesus Christ is alive and well there's a
[1:21:43] supernatural God on this scene it's a
[1:21:46] real word of God in this hour he doesn't
[1:21:49] go down there and say well I think I'm
[1:21:50] gonna build a church
[1:21:53] I think I'm going to copyright this go
[1:21:55] down to the Ethiopian government
[1:21:57] copyright this
[1:21:59] no sir he starts telling people
[1:22:02] hey I'm in a position of authority
[1:22:05] this is who I am people be hell yeah
[1:22:07] you're important but let me tell you
[1:22:09] what happened to me
[1:22:11] nothing to do with importance God met me
[1:22:14] and the backside of the desert amen what
[1:22:18] did the prophet to cut this a little
[1:22:19] short if you don't mind me skipping over
[1:22:20] a couple of things what did the prophet
[1:22:22] of God say he said tell them how your
[1:22:26] candle got lit amen here's the Ethiopian
[1:22:29] almost on the back side of the desert
[1:22:31] I'm wondering what does this even mean
[1:22:33] and God sent a man to me and he revealed
[1:22:38] the word to me he revealed a message
[1:22:40] that was for my hour amen he wasn't
[1:22:43] telling him about what happened uh in in
[1:22:47] Egypt he wasn't telling him about what
[1:22:49] happened beyond that my brother and
[1:22:50] sister he was telling what was happening
[1:22:52] right now he is risen
[1:22:55] amen he's alive it's real today he's
[1:22:59] risen and I want to tell you I want to
[1:23:01] just to put this I don't know you
[1:23:03] probably caught it but it's not his road
[1:23:05] to Gauss and my brother and sister it's
[1:23:08] our road to Gaza that God said I'm going
[1:23:11] to meet you wherever you are at and I'm
[1:23:14] going to send the right person into your
[1:23:16] life to speak to you that you can
[1:23:19] believe and when the supernatural
[1:23:21] happens you are not oh this will be
[1:23:23] misunderstood but you're not tied belt
[1:23:26] to belt with the man amen God took the
[1:23:29] man amount not took him out of your life
[1:23:31] literally but spiritually amen the
[1:23:34] prophet said I have come to introduce
[1:23:37] you to Jesus Christ amen the prophet of
[1:23:41] God himself he said I did not come to
[1:23:45] tie you I'm just paraphrasing to tie you
[1:23:47] to bring you to bring something to
[1:23:50] myself I didn't do that I came to
[1:23:52] introduce you to Jesus Christ and if you
[1:23:55] don't mind me going this far tonight
[1:23:57] amen God took the prophet out of our
[1:24:00] life amen in the Physical Realm took him
[1:24:03] out that we would then look to the word
[1:24:06] which is Christ himself and we're
[1:24:08] looking to the word and we are walking
[1:24:11] on to our house to our nation to our
[1:24:14] Kindred to our tongue not constantly
[1:24:17] looking back what will brother Philip
[1:24:19] say what will brother Philip say my
[1:24:22] brother and sister are what does the
[1:24:24] Lord Jesus say what does a revealed word
[1:24:27] in this hour tell us
[1:24:30] oh I'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:24:32] it's time for us on our road to Gaza to
[1:24:36] realize God didn't call us to turn
[1:24:38] around go back to Jerusalem and see what
[1:24:41] the religious leaders had to say about
[1:24:43] it but he called us to go on and carry
[1:24:46] the word oh Hallelujah
[1:24:49] oh my you didn't gonna see Philip I
[1:24:52] don't believe there's never another
[1:24:54] recorded place of Philip referring to
[1:24:56] the Supernatural on the road to Gaza
[1:24:59] why oh he cared
[1:25:02] trust me he cared
[1:25:05] but it had become such a common place
[1:25:08] that when God took him out there to the
[1:25:10] Ethiopian
[1:25:11] he knew God was doing something amen and
[1:25:14] when God took him back
[1:25:17] planted him again and he traveled
[1:25:19] through all those lands and ends up
[1:25:20] going to caesarea
[1:25:22] Philip didn't look back and say now I
[1:25:24] hope that God will be with me again
[1:25:27] I hope that this message I'm sharing
[1:25:29] might impact somebody like the Ethiopian
[1:25:33] he knew if God sent him there
[1:25:36] there was a seed present
[1:25:38] there was a life that had to be oh did
[1:25:42] you guys memorize the formula
[1:25:44] I didn't either
[1:25:46] but I tell you what it worked so well
[1:25:49] long before man ever thought about GPS
[1:25:52] God's been positioning his men
[1:25:56] Hallelujah sent one into my life
[1:25:59] amen that brother amen
[1:26:02] you might say he didn't have I don't
[1:26:04] even know how to describe that
[1:26:07] I don't even know how to say that I'll
[1:26:09] tell you what God did though
[1:26:11] God showed me a man that could be
[1:26:13] treated every way every ill way
[1:26:17] I didn't call him names
[1:26:21] I probably come close though
[1:26:25] but that brother God put him right
[1:26:29] in the midst of my road to Gaza
[1:26:33] a man that could show such love
[1:26:36] in the face of such disrespect amen
[1:26:40] and it changed my life
[1:26:44] I was like
[1:26:46] my
[1:26:47] if I could grow up to be half that man
[1:26:49] that brother is
[1:26:51] I would feel very happy
[1:26:54] my brother and sister
[1:26:56] we don't need to be in charge of the
[1:26:59] Queens Treasury
[1:27:02] to be important in the kingdom of God
[1:27:05] but what we do need to do is climb in
[1:27:08] our chariot
[1:27:09] they look a little different now don't
[1:27:10] they
[1:27:12] my
[1:27:14] man had a four horsepower Chariot in
[1:27:17] them days
[1:27:19] he is important guy
[1:27:21] six horsepower Chariot he was really on
[1:27:24] top of it
[1:27:25] if you had a one horse power chariot
[1:27:29] well
[1:27:30] it was the economy car
[1:27:33] amen you go a lot further on less feed
[1:27:36] none of that mattered to God
[1:27:39] didn't care that he held the checkbook
[1:27:42] to a kingdom amen
[1:27:45] what he did hold was a treasure
[1:27:48] Bound in an Earthen vessel
[1:27:51] and he said that's good enough for me
[1:27:55] to keep this appointment can you say
[1:27:59] Thank You Lord tonight amen we didn't
[1:28:01] have to be important we didn't have to
[1:28:03] have any of these things but God says I
[1:28:06] know where you're at and I know the
[1:28:09] season and I will meet you there amen
[1:28:14] Amen Let me just hurry I have
[1:28:18] about two minutes
[1:28:20] and
[1:28:22] thou know us all things
[1:28:24] Philip was sent from you remember
[1:28:26] telling you he left Mary had to go out
[1:28:28] into the desert right in the midst of a
[1:28:30] big meeting left thousands of people and
[1:28:32] the city was rejoicing and God said go
[1:28:34] out and stand in the desert you remember
[1:28:36] that for one man in Ethiopian a covered
[1:28:39] colored man coming down from Jerusalem
[1:28:41] returning to Ethiopia who had joined
[1:28:44] greatly with the queen and he was
[1:28:47] reading the prophet Isaiah and he didn't
[1:28:49] understand what he was reading and God
[1:28:51] told Philip go join yourself with him
[1:28:52] and when he did he spoke to him about
[1:28:54] Christ Jesus baptized him in a little
[1:28:57] hole of water out there and Philip never
[1:29:00] did return back to Samaria as far as we
[1:29:02] know or as the Bible gives reference the
[1:29:04] Holy Spirit caught him away and the
[1:29:06] eunuch didn't see him no more
[1:29:10] oh sorry about that
[1:29:12] sorry about that
[1:29:14] go ahead brother get in
[1:29:16] and the eunuch taking that message on
[1:29:19] down into Africa well there you are you
[1:29:21] see God knows what to do many times we
[1:29:23] guess at it but God knows just exactly
[1:29:26] what's right doesn't he oh how I love
[1:29:29] him his sovereignty his goodness his
[1:29:32] Mercy
[1:29:33] oh I tell you my brother and sister it's
[1:29:35] not a chance that we could in honesty
[1:29:37] say tonight that God doesn't know what
[1:29:39] he's doing in our life and maybe if we
[1:29:41] could just let go as that eunuch did and
[1:29:43] just say you know what I'm going to
[1:29:45] trust you to lead me and show me what I
[1:29:48] need and my brother and sister God's
[1:29:50] gone I'm not defending preachers God's
[1:29:52] got Faithful Men on the Earth today that
[1:29:56] want nothing more than to share the
[1:29:58] Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:30:00] but the world today doesn't want to
[1:30:02] accept
[1:30:04] little Philip
[1:30:07] they want something greater
[1:30:12] and you know what he left with this man
[1:30:13] this Ethiopian
[1:30:16] well Philip left with him
[1:30:19] he didn't leave a man
[1:30:23] the man wasn't rejoicing
[1:30:26] you're going to get baptized in the name
[1:30:27] of Philip
[1:30:30] what he left with him my brothers and
[1:30:33] sisters
[1:30:34] was
[1:30:36] a man
[1:30:38] that had a functioning revelation of
[1:30:41] Jesus Christ
[1:30:43] and what Philip left with the Ethiopian
[1:30:47] was a functioning revelation
[1:30:51] of Jesus Christ
[1:30:53] not a broken revelation
[1:30:57] go look up the word function or
[1:31:00] functioning amen
[1:31:02] you'll find
[1:31:03] that there is purpose and responsibility
[1:31:05] associated with those words
[1:31:09] he left a man with a purpose
[1:31:13] and because God had been so gracious to
[1:31:15] meet him on the road
[1:31:16] he realized he had responsibility
[1:31:20] to this gospel that had been shared to
[1:31:23] him
[1:31:24] my he didn't tell him out of there now
[1:31:27] this Doctrine you've got to take this
[1:31:28] Doctrine you've got to do this he'd
[1:31:30] already caught the doctrine
[1:31:32] Jesus Christ
[1:31:34] Doctrine
[1:31:36] man it ought to be the doctrine that we
[1:31:38] tell everybody about
[1:31:40] you see we need less intellectual
[1:31:42] Revelation and more functional
[1:31:44] revelation
[1:31:46] you know my brother and sister I'm going
[1:31:48] to say this in a tad bit joking
[1:31:52] but you can buy something and you don't
[1:31:54] even need to see where it's made from
[1:31:56] all you have to do is open it up and
[1:31:58] follow the directions
[1:31:59] and if you can't make no sex no sense at
[1:32:02] all out the directions I think I can
[1:32:04] tell you what country it was made
[1:32:08] you know attach a to d
[1:32:12] but D is a not
[1:32:15] what am I attaching it to and what am I
[1:32:17] attaching it with and what's it supposed
[1:32:19] to do it's like hey we can save one
[1:32:23] millionth of a cent by not printing that
[1:32:25] page of the directions
[1:32:29] but God's got a step
[1:32:31] by step
[1:32:32] and is there in the chariot
[1:32:35] Philip didn't fill his mind full of all
[1:32:38] kinds of other things
[1:32:40] he filled the Ethiopian eunuch's mind
[1:32:43] with the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:48] let the Revelation fill in all the other
[1:32:51] blanks that need to be filled in
[1:32:55] but you see how I can't help but just
[1:32:57] explain this amen sister vika if you
[1:33:01] would come maybe start to play something
[1:33:04] Satan's comments got us explaining it
[1:33:07] all
[1:33:09] we get their minds so muddled up with uh
[1:33:12] well if you catch this now and this and
[1:33:15] if you get that you'll get this over
[1:33:16] here and you'll get that my brother and
[1:33:18] sister we left a page out of the
[1:33:20] directions
[1:33:22] maybe more than a page
[1:33:25] how about we just get the people
[1:33:28] pointed
[1:33:29] to Jesus Christ
[1:33:31] oh now and I'll speak this as I close as
[1:33:34] I'm done
[1:33:35] I believe this message is Jesus Christ
[1:33:38] so we don't have to go throw the message
[1:33:41] on a shelf somewhere
[1:33:43] no no but we need to make sure that we
[1:33:46] don't add
[1:33:47] all these other things
[1:33:50] all of this so you'll just understand
[1:33:53] not my brother and sister the Holy Ghost
[1:33:55] God Can Explain himself God knows how to
[1:33:58] explain himself amen can we witness that
[1:34:01] tonight amen that God explained himself

[1:41:58] of the Ethiopian
[1:42:00] I don't believe he was reading
[1:42:03] this to satisfy a curiosity
[1:42:07] if one has ever been truly hungry
[1:42:12] for the word of God
[1:42:14] there is
[1:42:18] something taking place inside here
[1:42:22] it's not just a thought my brother and
[1:42:24] sister but there is something
[1:42:27] just as though it was absolutely a
[1:42:29] physical need remember brother Brown
[1:42:32] talking about the little boy eating The
[1:42:33] Petal off the bicycle
[1:42:35] there was something deep down inside of
[1:42:37] him made it satisfied
[1:42:40] I still don't know how I don't say this
[1:42:44] to be funny but I don't know how
[1:42:47] you discover
[1:42:49] that what you're craving is in a petal
[1:42:51] on a bicycle
[1:42:54] but there had to be Supernatural sense
[1:43:01] and I don't know how it is that we pick
[1:43:04] our Bible up brother Trevor and days
[1:43:07] that were discouraged
[1:43:10] I didn't say I don't know really how but
[1:43:13] in my flesh I don't know how it is that
[1:43:15] my Bible can fall open
[1:43:18] right to the very scripture
[1:43:21] I need
[1:43:23] and I hope you follow me here
[1:43:26] there's something maybe it was a smell
[1:43:30] maybe there was just some sense there
[1:43:33] that he looked one day to The Petal of a
[1:43:36] bicycle and said that's what I need but
[1:43:39] I can tell you the supernatural sense
[1:43:41] that has come to you and I to look at
[1:43:44] this word and say I've got to eat this

[1:43:49] live without this hey man let's Close
