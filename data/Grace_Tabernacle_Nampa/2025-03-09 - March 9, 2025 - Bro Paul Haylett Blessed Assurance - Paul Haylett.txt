sit the site of this church there's also a site CI te to site something when faith comes sight when we begin to see the things we believe that's but when we begin to speak the things we believe we begin to sight the things we believe little bit different way to think about it but it struck me and I said glory to God you know it's going to take us to the sight right hallelujah amen I just

some little bug amen I just want to make announcements here pardon me I'm just trying to find my way where I'm supposed to be uh Grace kids if it's all right with the families Grace kids at our house this coming Friday at 700 p.m. um so I we just look forward to that and uh it's awesome news brother Tim Sister Miriam got a new grandson handsome little guy and um just great Noah James Black and I'm sure that sister Miriam is just bursting at the seams at this moment amen isn't that good um I just want you to remember the Saints in South Africa uh there are so many things not just what's going on in the church but in a nation that had uh come to the point that they basically have uh throwed out any form of Christianity they're they're uh ruling a nation uh based on their feelings their thoughts and you know it's interesting I just want to say this this morning it's interesting my brother and sister that uh racism could have such a key factor even in the running of a nation and I Pray by God's grace we never let racism in the church amen we if you know I'll tell you what it is if if it ever comes into the church you can tell that we've quit praying you can tell we've quit entering into the word because we are Sons and Daughters of God God didn't Define it by our skin color just pray for the Saints there in South Africa just a lot it actually has racism has come into the church and uh people are saying the reason the church has run like it is is because the people running it are racist my brother and sister let's pray for them amen that they could get back and be aligned with the word of God and and be able to look and see this is my brother this is my sister let us as Believers be color blind amen so remember the Saints there in South Africa and uh I bring you greetings um from Brother Dany and sister Michelle and from many in the church there in Sarasota uh we just had a a lovely time there I don't know if this is a good time to even mention that cuz we we had good Services God was very gracious to us uh to be able to just get right to some points um but a a lovely time for sister Jerry and I I actually um I actually got to hold a real live wild alligator and the little guy had so many teeth I was terrified and they are need sharp it was just incredible experience you don't often get to to you know do something like that and um so greetings from brother Danny and sister Michelle and the Saints there in Sarasota uh communicating with a little bit with Brother John Andes and uh just Desiring to remember them in prayer uh brother John and I in our conversation uh touched upon the fact we'll actually be in South Africa at the same time and uh he'll be ministering for brother medba and um we'll be there obviously at Emanuel Gospel Center so let's remember brother John sister Sharon uh brother Jonah sister Edna imy uh bring greetings today and um if you don't know I don't remember if I announced or not but uh brother Jonah will be coming and ministering for us in July and um also this morning uh greetings from Brother Roar uh that we reached out just uh thinking about him this morning thinking about all the Believers there and I miss sister Rachel's parents um uh brother Moses and family we miss them while we were gone but we love to have seen them so we bring greetings from that amen I want to speak to you this morning musicians thank you so much God bless you and um I want to speak to you this morning on a title of bless Assurance um and U that is the place that God has wanted us to come to he's called us to a place of Blessed assurance that we can stand in the day that we live in and we don't have to get up in the morning you know um am I doing okay that's right you know we don't have to get up in the morning and say I'm afraid of of what is happening um you know we can get up in the morning and say praise God as a son or daughter of God I've got another day to live the word in this world Amen and that's what we desire amen so let's turn in our Bibles to um the book of Galatians and um I hope you don't mind I don't know what will happen today but if it's a little short I just ask you to pray for me we're just uh struggling with our voice a little bit uh Galatians 2 chapter: 16- 21 and um we thank God for each and every one of you today God bless you our sister Maria good to see you and uh each and every one of us here as a part of the body of Believers the body of Christ we should lift one another up into Heavenly places every single day Amen brother Logan God bless you and uh Galatians 2:16 knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ and not by The Works of the law for by The Works of the law shall no flesh be justified amen so want to just stop for a moment and look at that and ponder that to realize my brother and sister I I mentioned this here I don't know it seems like it must be at least a couple weeks ago um oh yeah pray for brother Paul's blood sugar my phone is telling me from the office that it's too high so anyway we look at this and realize that there's action required but it's not by our works amen that's right do we do we understand there's action required we can't just sit back and say okay praise God I'm Justified amen there's an action that's necessary but your works the works of the law shall no flesh be justified but if while we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves also are found Sinners is therefore Christ the minister of sin God forbid so don't ever justify what's happening in your life oh I'm a Believer it's okay I've jumped the fence I'm here where I don't belong but praise God God's predestin predestinated me into the rapture no realize that God's never going to be a minister of sin we have to come back into alignment with the word that's that's the whole thing that we must do and if we're not willing to do that then we should be terrified we should be terrified of our own motive direction action Etc if we're not concerned for if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me can we say that together nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave him self for me I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain that's right Heavenly Father we just ask you to be with us today Father just study our thoughts Lord and just help us we ask in your precious name amen you may be seated now I'm I'm not really didn't want to get Sidetrack as it is to go into part of this but I think it's good some time saints that we would stop and maybe this morning just stop and say you know Lord what is this this life which I now live what when we examine our own life what what are we actually looking to because you see now it won't be your final destination and don't be discouraged if if uh things have been going difficult for you but you know we need to stop and say you know what I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God God I've been called of God to live the the word in this hour and what has that produced in me now my brother and sister if you if you put uh things together that should produce something uh you know and it's not producing it you would go back and say you know uh I've added water to my plaster of Paris and and uh uh it never set up it's just mush there you would have to stop and say what was this and what was the ingredient of this to bring it to a place and the life which I now live I think we should stop and we should examine our life and say now what is producing now if this hurts a little bit we can rub some Sav on it but the life I'm living right now what produced that life now if it's a life right now of nervousness and anxieties and tensions and fears and and and uh you know lack or I should say frustrations lack of patience and whatever it might be you know we have to stop and say what produced that you know God's not a god of fear amen and uh he's not a god of anxiety although he will come and he will cause a sheep to be nervous sometimes because he wants us not to get comfortable when we're in places we should not be but it's there that we have to look at what is the life which I now live now my brother and sister I'm going to take it radically to one side right now if we find oursel outside of church cursing or lying or cheating or stealing and and you'd have to stop and say what is producing that in me my brother and sister if we're here we're taking this outside of the church if we're here outside of the church and your heart is not sighing and crying for those that are living in this world my brother sister that sounds well I'm doing right I'm spiritual I I'm not doing anything wrong I'm not lying cheating stealing anything like that but you have no care for the world here here the prophet of God says that you should be afraid because God is coming for those who are sighing and crying for the Abominations done in the city so you see we can detach ourselves uh from sin but we can also go so far that we detach ourselves from everyone around us and that isn't what God's calling we were called to live in this world just not of this world and so when we come and find ourselves too detached that we really just don't care we'd say well you know I I just don't care about this I don't care about that my brother and sister we are called to care about souls and so what is being produced in us if today God is working in our life and we're living uh balanced lives we're we're moving forward in the word of God we care about those around us it do us well to look around us and say how much do I care about those to my right and to my left and those in front of me and those behind me how much do I care and if you don't find yourself caring and in the fullest of measure please go home and pray today don't leave the church without praying today because you see God's going to only be the prophet says words we won't get into all of that but you know these words amen that love is a one of the greatest or right a pinnacle that we'd have now my brother and sister you see it's the unfeigned love of the Brethren it's not that the not the oh yeah I love them I love you God bless you no my brother and sister we got to get to where it's unfeigned in other words even if they cause you offense that's right yeah but the prophet balanced that didn't he he said a real believer can't be offended that's right and now that causes us another struggle we could detour over on that one and spend weeks couldn't we cuz I think all of us would say at some point that while we were uh you know had a prayer life reading our Bible going to church we become offended over people's behavior we shouldn't be offended over that no we should be uh uh moved prostrated over that but not offended now I want to just move right along here so as we examine and it would do us all well to examine the life which we are now living uh what is producing the life that we have if we have bitterness anger fear anxiety whatever stop and and ask the Lord to reveal what is bringing that into your life and then ask the Lord to give you rem it uh and as we look at this um I had the title of Blessed assurance and on my notes um uh for every question at home for every question there is a Biblical answer so there's our solution is back to the word it's not uh not in theology not in our thoughts or opinions you know uh the Lord just really and I won't go into detail but the Lord just really moved this weekend uh uh this last weekend certainly not to boast on man by any measure but the Lord just really come down and and pointed some things out and and uh this was a report of others you know and you look at that and it's not man that facilitates that but it's God bringing his children amen back to the word for the answer and so that's what the prophet was doing and in this time of reflection of who we really are uh you know useing as a thermometer of our present spiritual condition now my brother and sister just because you didn't jump out of bed this morning you know click your heels to together praise God um that's no sign of whether you have a a good solid spiritual temperature right we're looking in the world today seeing things that that uh men who were last week in the pulpit telling you God spoke to them are now this weekend in the midst of Scandal so one saying that God is dealing with him and God's speaking to them none of that matters you see it's actually the thermometer of the word in our life is what dictates and uh so we look at this some uh high points amen can you think of a high point in your life this last week or two or three you know something God answered a prayer spoke to you you saw something in the scripture that high point we can live in the Afterglow of that high point but when you have a low point in your life you can also live in the Afterglow of it but my brother and sister what God's looking for is this thermometer of your present spiritual condition so what last year was or what uh you know you felt about it is irrelevant of this morning God wants us to take our temperature this morning he wants us to look at this and say you know what where is my life today you could have been shouting Hallelujah yesterday but if you are defeated today yesterday's Hallelujah will not take away today's defeat God wants us to know what our temperature is and so you know if we are coming short of the word we're coming short of things you know never look at that as though it's a permanent position never look at it as though you know the Troubles of this last week is where I'm at spiritually don't don't look at it that way my brother and sister you cannot take the troubles you know we have I think everyone I'll just speak in a positive tense every one of us has experienced Satan coming in like a flood and when that flood takes place my brother and sister if you take it as the snapshot of your life you will move forward saying you know what I'm practically defeated but that was just a moment in your life and when Satan comes in like a flood we have to remember God said I'm going to raise up a standard amen amen so there's the point see God coming and moving and with every flood there's a standard now when the standard is raised we think that would protect us I've heard it interpreted that you know if if Satan comes in like a flood God raises up a standard that flood will never touch me that's not what the word says my brother and sister God is coming in and raising up after Satan's assault he's raising up a standard and that standard is himself amen it's not a burm out here to keep the waves out we're driving around uh my phone doesn't have it uh uh uh uh but uh you know we're driving down the road and sister Jerry goes oh we're 20 ft above sea level and next thing you know Sister Michelle's got her phone out out and brother Danny's got his phone out and and mine was the only F I had no Revelation but you see I got nervous when their phones said we were actually below sea level and we're driving along there we're not very far from the coast and it says we're actually below sea level and I thought my I I don't like this kind of an idea you know that we're living below sea level well my brother and sister I hope you follow me the prophet of God said too often we're living below our rightful position in Jesus Christ that means you're underwater this might seem strange to you but it doesn't mean you're drowning we're looking at a phone and it says that we're below sea level but we weren't wet we weren't drowning because every time Satan comes in like a flood God has revelation he's got his presence he's pouring into his people and yes you're going to go through trial but I say God bless you for going through the trial and standing and just trusting the Lord in that time because you see we're never in a permanent position the only permanent position that applies to the Bride of Jesus Christ is the fact that he said you are mine from before the foundation of the world there is a permanent fact and it don't matter what your ups and downs are this day what happens with your marriage with your family with your career with your automobile or whatever it might be my brother none of that is permanent only our position in Jesus Christ is permanent amen and that's what we need to remember so we can stand on that and the prophet of God said he has provided everything we need for this journey so why would we stop and say you know what everything's Fallen apart I'm depressed he's got what is necessary for this journey provided will we stand long enough to receive the provision often times people get so pardon me to say it this way people get flaky and they run before God can present them the solution to the problem God wants you to stand still amen amen as speaking to Israel at the Red Sea Moses being anointed of God said stand still because the enemy that you see today you will see no more forever amen what is this referring to into our day is a group of Believers the Bride of Jesus Christ that will face trials she'll face an enemy that's closing in on her quickly she will have a natural instinct to have fear and doubt and anxiety but God wants us to stand still because when God delivers you from the fear and from the anxiety and the depression amen you don't have to face it again you don't have to go back and claim that again you can stand solid on the word and say my God is more than able amen that should be our position that we take amen amen so if we have everything we need for this journey my brother and sister amen we're not found wanting we're found complete and it's time for us to stand up and be able to say you know what I don't care what yesterday they was I know what the word said about me and I'm taking this position in the word cuz the devil's a very profoundly efficient liar amen he can come in and he can he can come after a church service and he can come into the mind of the people and they can tell them that could have been better could have been more inspired could have been more Revelation could have quoted more could have quoted less should have had more out of the Bible should have had less out of the Bible you see Satan knows what to present to each individual that they would be profoundly affected by the devil's voice right but you see my brother and sister I'm not talking about just taking something if a man got up here and did a whole lot of 's and O's and E and didn't have anything to say but if he said one thing that changed your life you could stand there and say it was a good service today but you see God wants us to stand here and say you know what God knew what we needed the service is what it was God knew what I needed amen maybe if the service didn't meet your expectation God was working on your patience now I know he doesn't need to work on any of our patience because we are his patients come on it's like the man who walked in true story walked in into an ER several gunshot wounds walks into an ER none of them enough to kill him got blood running out dripping on the floor and the nurses try to get him on a gurnie and the man tells him I only need a couple aspirin and he walked out of the ER and a few minutes later 911 receives a call there's a dead man in the middle of the intersection my brother and sister he refused to accept God's offered answer God's chosen place of worship but you see he was in such a case in this case intoxicated he didn't even realized he was intoxicated on a spirit of alcohol but in this day people are intoxicated on the spirit of leoda and don't even realize how damaged they are but they want to come to church get an asp mother brother don't don't don't refuse God's provided way amen now brother Brown says here excuse me Church ages he says I Know Thy works and if a man fears that he might not please God then let him fulfill the word you see if we fear that we're not going to please God we don't run away we don't ask for an aspirin and go die in the street amen we go and we accept God's provided solution so if a man thinks he might not please God then let him fulfill the word if a man wonders if he will hear those words well done uh uh good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of God in his life and assuredly he will hear those words of praise you see my brother and sister people get concerned enough they're concerned enough to tell themselves they need help but not concerned enough to do anything about it and there's a different you say but I live a good life I don't find anywhere that the scripture says a good life gets us into the kingdom of God Amen it's the man who's pleasing God Amen ass surely he will hear those words of praise the word of Truth was the Criterion then it is a Criterion now there isn't another standard there isn't another Plum line now my brother and sister this has no reference to our trip so don't don't you know formulate anything there but we are facing a crisis around the message amen we have so many new Plum lines so many new criterias that that are what it would take to make a Rapture uh uh Brother David preached on this and and uh touched on these things these last few services and my brother and sister you see what it comes down to we've got one point of reference do you realize for GPS or anything else to work correctly there has to be just one point of complete reference right that's right I'll tie that back in a natural sense to you I fire up a tractor tomorrow morning and I start working ground and the lines are perfect at the end of the day I shut it off I go home I get up Tuesday morning I fire it all up again will the tractor Drive the exact same line it did yesterday if its point of reference is correct it will but we're using in the world of GPS natural GPS we're using satellites for points of references satellites move that's right so in the morning you have to come and you have to change the line back to the original and when we change it back to the original it will go on and drive exactly the same line through the day are you following me amen and this is where the Prophet come in people are are like well what do we really need a prophet in this day people who say they believe the message we're beyond the prophet well my brother and sister let me put it to you this way we as the bride of Christ are beyond the prophet we have come to the place we've been introduced to our Lord Jesus Christ and that introduction brother brandom himself says this amen I never come to call you to myself but to point you or introduce you toes Jesus Christ but my brother and sister for many of us to know where we should be standing in the word it took a prophet's message to put it back in line for us to find where we can go and know the prophet is not our absolute but the word he pointed to is our absolute and we can go back to that word every single time and it will set us in line set us in order and guide us correctly amen and you can experience people that to say I believe this message but I don't isn't that a paradox I believe this message but the prophet was wrong I believe the Bible and the Bible does Point towards the prophet but the prophet is outdated unnecessary they got their whole list of things that they would say but my brother and sister where is our point of reference you can say it's Jesus Christ but the prophet said I came here to introduce uce you to Jesus Christ and without an introduction we have no point of reference and we look at this amen there isn't another standard there isn't another Plum line as the world is going to be judged by one Christ Jesus we can say Amen to that even so it's going to be judged by the word amen amen and if a man wants to know how he's making out let him do as James suggested look into the mirror of God God's word amen there is our Plum line there is everything that we need to do come right back to this word okay well if we go back to the word then we don't need the prophet my brother and sister we don't even understand the word as God wants us to be able to see it but God said no problem I can introduce you to a Seer I can introduce you to a prophet I can introduce you to a man that can lay it out very clear for you and by Revelation you can then follow that amen but we and I don't mean to speak negative this morning but some parts of the world it seems like there's just plenty of people we probably have more of them around here than I recognize but there's people that are like well that was good for that day but we need something more spiritual we need something more revelated we need something more well you know my brother and sister the prophet of God said we should be praying for Revelation I wouldn't ask you to raise your hand but did we pray for Revelation this last week amen we should be praying for Revelation because we're asking God for his Divine Direction you're not saying Oh Brother Paul is treats us good as a pastor you know preaches from the word does all that stuff my brother and sister if you're following Paul you'll find my brother and sister even 1,000th of a degree off on the compass of the word would leave you destitute but when we come back and God by his Divine leadership puts the compass directly on the word that we know what is true north we know what is the true word of the hour we know what true Revelation is then we can line up on that and we can trust it with our life right for every problem any problems in the church you don't have to lift a hand I've already got the answer there is a scriptural solution Amen to that problem amen I don't mean to be too pointed but I just say this if we got children problems we have scriptural answers Absolut to those problems amen we've got financial problems we got scriptural answers to those problems and you can go right down the list and I don't want to offend anyone but my brother and sister I'm afraid even us here Grace Tabernacle you love people that I love with all of my heart I think if we're not careful we'll get off even that one 10,000th of a degree and we'll start thinking that we have answers we'll start thinking that we've got a solution here just recently I had a a brother mentioned to me uh about and and I I was kind of surprised where it came from a brother mentioned about well there's this this uh denominational Christian has this really really good counseling course and maybe I would want to consider subscribing and reading it I'm telling you my brother and sister I love that brother but I thought I'm already in a counseling course amen and it works just as efficient as I let it work right if I resist it just like the man that's a counselor if I resist his advice it's not going to work and it's not his fault and if we resist the advice right and it doesn't work it's not his fault amen but people will say oh I I thought God said he did say don't interpret it he's his own interpreter let God bring it to pass but we got to stand still long enough to say Lord here I am right here I am amen now let me put it this way just for a side note for a second it says that if we want to be glorified with him we have to suffer with him that's right that's right would we today go out here in the parking lot and somebody beat us with a whip somebody Scourge us oh no that wasn't what he's talking he's talking about mentally suffering is that what he said did he clarify that suffering as a complete statement would be whatever come your way whether it's demons whether it's physical whether it's your health whether it's emotion whatever it is if you're going to reign with him you are going to suffer with him and you know we as message Believers have got so pampered we love the blessings we don't like the suffering amen Lord help us amen would you agree with me amen amen we do not like the suffering but we want the blessing amen Lord help us I can only imagine what my week coming will be yeah yeah it's all right for every problem there's a scriptural solution and I want to put the emphasis every problem amen I don't care what the problem is you know some people born under certain birth signs they're the kind of people that say oh this is this I can fix it you know that's not a blessing that's actually a curse to think you're going to fix it when there's only one who can fix it but we are so strong in our own opinion of our own selves that we're just certain that God intended for us to fix it say Amen Paul amen now this might seem a hard right turn but in the Book of Esther and you can follow this if you're familiar with the the scripture there you could follow this through the chapters but we see how hmon used the law to place a means to destroy and I I'm changing this from the Jew and from Israel because God looks at them if you follow me here God looked at the jew as a Believer and he looks at you as a Believer amen so the story of Esther is not old Old Testament it's not for Jews it's not just for Israel it's for the believer amen and so as we look at this we'll see the Book of Esther hmon used the law to put in place the means to destroy the believer now my brother and sister when we come to the place that we think we can tow the mark and live the law you will find that that very idea will destroy you that's right and there's many a Believer many a Christian that today is sitting there still trying to live under some form of the law if I do this God will be pleased well I'll tell you what my brother and sister this might strike you a little different but just trust it I'm speaking the truth if you can sit there today and say if I do this I'm a message believer if I do this God will be pleased how about you coming to the place that you will say Lord I am nothing without you and you are in control of my life and I am a Son of God I'm a daughter of God from before the foundation of the world and it was your suffering before the foundation of the world that wrote my name in that Lamb's Book of Life and I'm confessing that that will please God because as you confess it God will bring it to pass in your life it won't be what I have done but it will be what he has done it's not what I can can become it's what I already am in Jesus Christ amen that is what will please God not us here in a physical form trying to attain to some kind of hierarchy of of I I've had more answered prayers in you or or God would hear my voice more than yours oh or whatever it might be my brother and sister but God is looking for his children his Believers to just simply stand up and say you said it I believe it righten and it will be so now hmon used the law to destroy the believer and unfortunately there's still many on the Earth today that are under the law right now if this law is left unchallenged it will isolate the believer and Destroy them you say what law is that that was hmon getting king of hazus to sign it put the ring to it and that the rule of mes and Persians and whatnot is that once it's been spoken can't be changed they did have some things right are you with me today amen they weren't that far off the word CU God said when I claimed you before the foundation of the world I am not going to lose you I've never lost a single one so we can stand on that when God claimed us he's not going to say that was a mistake I'm sorry I'm here to change this today no he put it to Time and Eternity you're my sons you're my daughters you are my bride you are the Church of the Living God Amen and he never turned from that but here it is that hmon uses this gets the king to agree they put a law in place that these pesky old Jews uh Believers I'm just going to take a brief note if you don't mind right here on the board about right there on that wall is a letter received here at the church inviting us the man who sent the letter is LDS the man supporting it is a Nazarene and they're sending an invitation out to over 130 churches in this city did you know there were that many churches here 130 churches and you know if you right up Midland top the hill where it makes a hard left and there's Gravel Road and a big beautiful building down by the lake they were going to provide a free meal whether you are a rabbi a priest oh the whole list Pastor ah can't remember all the names they had there they're going to provide a free meal for us to all join together did the prophet it not give us warning of these kind of things abely but you're going to love part of their joining together you'll see how spiritual minded this is it's all the preachers all the preachers coming together and we're going to have a meal together and we're going to have Fellowship can we find that in our Bible we can amen I love that Brother David you bet we can amen we can find it my brothers and sisters and they're going to come together in this multitud 130 churches which many of them could be the same denomination of a slightly different leadership or flavor and we're going to have Fellowship around the word but you're going to love this part of the reason that this thing is being called together is we're going to vote on what religious pictures get to be present at the city of Nas prayer breakfast I told my dear Aaliyah hurry up paint a picture want to take it down there might be the only one to vote for it but you'll have a vote you see where religion's going to a free meal balum I'm sure wrote a flyer very similar to this one come on down we're not going to we're not going to preach against you we're not going to you know do anything no insults no recriminations no nothing just come on down here and vote for our art have a free meal Fellowship because catch these words the prophet spoke all these years ago exactly right we're all the same that's it let's have a vote this morning first vote on the agenda is our are we all the same not according to the word not according to the word we are not all the same now I just bring that out these will be good people amen I don't want to sound like I'm cadic what I said earlier we should be sighing and crying for these These are good people if you knew them as a neighbor as a friend as a coworker whatever you would know them at you would say these are good people but my brother and sister good people isn't what's going to keep you on the word that's right the designation of good people unless I sound that do that I have so many friends that I would trust with everything I own the care of my family some of them don't even believe there's a God but they're good people see we've got to stay focused on this but the prophet said this day would come right here so we could say in the city of Nampa this day this scripture is fulfilled so amen so if these these things these challenges you might say that Hon's brought forth uh uh you know to to have to do this and everyone who is a Jew he said you know let us have a judgment that wherever they would be found that you could slay them but when the whole story comes out Esther comes she's looking for someone this is the bride of Christ that's right she's looking for a solution somewhere she doesn't know quite where to find it because she doesn't think that she can go to the king cuz the king hasn't called me but the word says go boldly Before the Throne that's right you must believe the word amen and so in this a new law as it is is passed and says wherever the Jews are join together defend yourself I don't want to offend anybody this morning I just want to put this out and mark the note if you are the bride of Christ trying to stand alone you'll find that you're defenseless they recognized and wrote it and put it into the law gather together and defend yourselves don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together that's right because it's in the assembling of yourself together that God gives us the ability to defend yourselves you say well I I live just as well no my brother and sister God knew what to anoint in that day and God knows what to anoint in this day let's just take the word let's stand together we we don't need to try and stand alone let us stand together amen now so we see that that uh Esther's got a little trouble and Mori who is her stepfather I hope you'll catch this little spiritual angle we had one closer but he said I'm not going to try and redeem him we don't even know what Esther's real father was but God gave her a man for a father would stand on the word stood on it even to his own daughter who he loved with all of his heart and he tells his own daughter for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this if God didn't think you couldn't live the word in this age he wouldn't have placed you in this age but God did place you in this age and the word of God that he has given you is powerful sharper than a two-edged sword let's not waver my brother and sister let's not even let it come from our mouths to say I'm not able I can't do this I'm not Victorious I have trouble no don't even say it rise up and say you know what I have come to the kingdom for a Time such as this this is the Year this is the time this is the season God called me and I'm here to perform what God has called me to amen you're placed in this particular time and place for a specific moment right exactly right right to fulfill a crucial purpose yes sir to take action to address a critical challenge this all part of definitions placed with this Leo is the moment you've been prepared for can we say amen amen but you realize just listening to the prophet here a few days ago we're not even in leod deia anymore we've already been called into the supernatural beyond the seventh day into the eighth A New Beginning amen new creatures and a new beginning so let's not use leod deia as an excuse why I'm in the condition I inan God's called you manifested you empowered you into a new day into the Eighth Day into a new beginning to rise up in Heavenly places this is what God's called us I'm tired my brother and sister of my own self using leoda as an excuse it's time for me to stand up and say God has placed me in his word which is the new beginning of the eighth day is the word my brother and sister Christ himself and it's time for us to put Leo deia aside as an excuse stand up and say you know what God said it I can do it I've been prepared for this time not for years ago or something that might be in the fure future but I'm worried about being deceived they'll be so close to be deceived you get full of the word they can't deceive you that's exactly amen get anointed by the Holy Ghost they can't deceive you the moment you've been prepared for do you know when you judge Leo deia in spiritual warfare it would be judged as extreme it's a season a time of extreme spiritual warfare and you know that in an extreme Warfare go study the history Romans some of the others there'll come a time they actually fought with honor they literally fought with honor if you was a man that was struck down and you lifted a hand you are now a prisoner but they passed by you because it was a battle of Honor but as the Roman Empire progressed naturally and spiritually they realized that sometimes these that they struck down come back later and was their adversary again and then they took this basically no prisoner left behind and you could be there and they would just finish you helpless as you were this is a season of Extreme Warfare y Satan doesn't want to just maim you might not take your life think about job might not take your life but he will destroy you every way he can destroy you and bring you to a place I won't go into the details but you'll see people that will acknowledge that that they need to come back to the roots of their childhood their early adulthood they need to come back to that but they bring it up oh I couldn't do that because my pastor yeah my brother and sister their Pastor according to those that were sharing this with me their pastor's been dead 20 years but still this pastor is what is the reason I can't serve God oh my father did this and your father is no longer in the picture you see I hope I don't offend anybody but you see extreme Warfare and Satan doesn't just hurt people he mimes them spiritually tries to knock every bit of life out of them well it's justifiable I was treated Ill give you an example young woman in the message she's probably about 45 years old now she doesn't serve God today because when she was a kid in the church at the fellowships the preachers and the dads ate all the chicken before any wives or kids well you must admit I mean surely that qualifies as a valid excuse white Throne judgment lord I can't serve you because they ate the chicken come on see how Satan's done in this extreme Warfare he's given them a delusion and by delusion not by bodily harm but by delusion has killed them to where they're hardened against the gospel because they ate the chicken just in case any of you would wonder after I come across that I decided I'd just go at the end of the line when we have fellowships I go at the end of the line I'm not going to be accused of eating the chicken but I'll stand here this morning and tell you there's many a time I got to the counter and you guys have already eaten the chicken should I quit serving God no because it's a phony excuse and only those that are looking for an excuse will find a phony excuse to follow if you ate the chicken then I say Lord I guess I wasn't supposed to have any chicken and don't quit eating chicken because I said that but I want you to understand how phony the excuse can be in leoda but anointed it becomes a great excuse so the age of extreme spiritual warfare see this is an age Satan's trying to separate us right here in this church we've seen the spirits of that trying to separate my brother and sister God has a separ separator but my brother and sister the separator is not Satan's separator they're not using the same separator as far as the bride who we're talking to it's not a time to be separated from one another but it's a time to be joined together and why because just like it was with the Jews there at the time of hmon there's where our protection is amen right you know what we need to be as church as Believers brother Titus will you stand up you can bring your sword brother Titus and I should be close enough that when the enemy comes you know it ain't going to be very long he's going to be looking down on me brother Titus and I should be close enough that when I turn to face my me I don't have to worry about my back that's right and as Titus turns to face his enemy he doesn't have to worry about his back that's what Satan's trying to destroy that's what he wants to take away where I don't know if I can depend on them they're human good don't depend on them as a human depend on them as a son or daughter of God see that Fellowship being destroyed tells people no one cares about me it tells us I have little or no value in the church let me remind you that Satan is a liar amen that's not the word of God you won't find it in the word so therefore that means it's Satan's lie so we we come for Mutual defense and our weapon amen what is our weapon the weapons of our Warfare my brother and sister the prophet of God showed us very clearly that our weapon in this day is prayer oh you need the word you need to be in the word you need to have a prayer life you need all of these things my brother and sister but he come down and he told us Prayer Changes Things amen we should believe that modern events I don't even know what time it is can I just preach off the time of my iPad um my iPad says that it's only 12:00 we'll quit in just one moment musicians if you'll come modern events made clear by prophecy brother Brown says here dear God you've healed our sickness now forgive our sins Lord of not being the kind of Christian that we should be not professing to be Full Gospel men or women here we find ourselves slumping off like denominational chicken and people are like I just wish the prophet was here he would be so polite and kind to us yeah you denominational chicken you yeah no my brother and sister he tore their height off now and I just want to be a good message preacher so it gives me an option occasionally to tear a little of your height off not one harly smile in the whole congregation cuz we don't like our hide being tore off that's right spiritually let's not slump help us dear God take us Shake us with your Holy Spirit Can someone say amen and there be anything in us that's not like you take it out of us Lord and I say Amen to that too and plant our feet on God's holy word and let the Holy Ghost burn down into our heart and take all the dross of unbelief and the drowsiness of this day and arise and Shake Yourself Grant it God cleanse us mold us make us God granted can we say Amen to that as a prayer in our own life hallelujah amen you see the thing is Saints we've got a Blessed Assurance what God placed in you will say Amen to every word of God Amen now one last little bit we'll just hurry I I'll leave out the commentary in the seven Church ages here Le oia now then there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word that's right amen now I liked what brother Isaac shared he shared it in the office with me and I encouraged him to to share it you see there comes a time that we have to cite it we have to speak it but there's a time we have to live it that's right right yes sir your prayers your fastings your repentance no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that Throne that's right it will be granted only to the word bride that's right Lord help me amen that's right now this might sound like an awkward statement but I have no desire to spend my years on Earth serving God to find out I I not him not the word I missed it that's it right we're so close let's just make a full commitment that's it granted only to the word Bride As The Throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is United to him so only they who are of that word even as he was of that word will share that Throne that's what I desire my brother and sister amen let's just stand Hallelujah look I hope this was not too blunt not too straightforward but it's just about time for us to come to a place we got Blessed Assurance amen not blessed hope no not my brother and sister it's not going to be because you said God sent a prophet it's going to be because the very word that filled the prophet overflowed from him and was spoken to us amen is in us and it will overflow in US our life amen and we will become the word amen that's right Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah bless it Assurance Amen brother Ivan outsmarted me right there he's just had that right there oh [Music] blessed Jesus Is Mine oh what a full Taste Of Glory Divine I'm an air
