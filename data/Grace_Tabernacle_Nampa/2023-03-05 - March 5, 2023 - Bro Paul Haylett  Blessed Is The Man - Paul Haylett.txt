bless this service bless his time together Lord bless each one we ask in Jesus name amen amen you may have your seats [Music] I got a couple announcements here to make so um hey somebody wrote on here it's brother Scott's birthday today I don't see him here today but God bless you brother Scott if you're listening we love you and we appreciate you brother and we miss you not here um we're gonna go over so we've got everything squared away for camp this year um well I shouldn't say everything squared away a lot of the preliminary stuff so I've got a quick little slide thing here we're going to go through real quick and then I believe you have a special is that right okay so as soon as I'm done you can come up get the special on um you put that first one up so um Gray's Family Camp 2023 being Camp Cascade up in Donnelly Idaho so it's kind of right right there on the lake um and I'll we can get maps and stuff as that gets closer but uh so it'll be a check-in on Thursday evening June 15th at uh after 4 P.M um and then the checkout we've got the camp till Monday morning um so we got to be out and cleaned up by 1 pm on Monday morning so you move on to the next one there this is the kind of the flyer that Chris put together with the quote there that he felt was the quote for this year Psalms 105 41 he opened up the Rock and the waters gushed out they ran in the dry places like a river amen so go ahead and move the next one there so this year it's going to be quite a bit different than last year you know last year it was a bunch of us with RVs and Tents so this year we've got cabins for those that don't want a tent which I'm sure there's some people that rather not stay in a tent this year if they don't have to we have three premium cabins with a full bath with shower in those ones they sleep six they do have Heating and ceiling fans so this will be mid mid-june who knows what it's going to be like you know you never you know I never know how it is around here it is up in Donnelly so it should be cooler but you know those evenings can still be cool so they do have Heating in those there's 18 there's actually nine standard cabins but they split into they have like a wall that goes down the middle and divides them one side sleeps six and one side sleep seven so we're pretty much just dividing all those up but we'll see how the the sign up how when people sign up how that comes in um so the each one of those divided sleep six on one side and seven on the other they also have Heating and fans provided um those don't have restrooms or running water they have electricity obviously but um no running water so there's a central bath house um you know divided man on one side women on the other um and I believe there's four showers four sinks four toilets in each of the bath houses so um and there is no cooking allowed in the cabins so we'll get onto the meals here in just a second so you can go to the next one um there's a lodge dining hall for services and and obviously obviously the Mills seats up to about 200. as you can kind of see there in the picture there they've got a little platform up there with a projector and stuff like that so the services will be in there as well um there will be three three meals served daily so on that Thursday there will be a dinner served if you get there if you check in that Thursday night there will be dinner served and then on Monday morning if you stay till Monday morning to leave that morning there will be a breakfast served as well um so there's that um and then this has everything for the worship services and then the meals there's some other details around that but we'll address those as we get closer to the dates so move on to the next one there um there's a big fire pit area for devotions and stuff like that um seats about 100 with the logs and stuff around it it's kind of secluded it's it's surrounded by trees and stuff like that so it's got a nice little area um there are some RV sites with hookups and um several tent sites in the area as well so next one there uh there's also a big big kind of grass common area there uh activity area so um you know whatever we want to play out there soccer volleyball whatever that might be they also have stuff for archery a ropes course and kayaks since it's by the lake um and then whatever whatever other activities we decide to introduce there so move to that last one this has the fees and stuff in there so it is it is more money this year with the cabins and all the meals included so um the fees include three meals a day as you can see there and a meal on that Thursday or Friday depending or sorry Friday Thursday or Monday um so there's kind of the fees um if you have any questions about this ask myself I think I even can probably answer questions too after service um and then we will be sending out a a form to get signed up in the church WhatsApp so I've got a form all built out for that we are going to cap the attendance of Camp I think last year we had about 75 people this year we're opening it up since we have more room more spaces to about 125. um so um we want to make sure we want the form once we send that out we would like don't share that with anybody outside of our church for at least a couple weeks we want to make sure everybody in church has a chance to get signed up and be a part of that before we start opening it up to people outside so we just asked yeah once we send that out don't don't be sharing it right away um we want to make sure that everybody uh everybody here has a chance to get that get that done so um like I said if you have any questions around this uh please just ask me or Ivan um Chris isn't back yet but he would be the other one you could talk to him as well so um so looking forward to that hopefully everybody is I am amen we had a great time last year um oh and brother Stephen will be back this year as well so brother Stephen Coffey will be the speaker again um he's coming back so looking forward to that enjoyed it last year amen Hallelujah uh so sister [Music] thank you there is a sword s in times of need that gives me hope that brings me peace [Music] My Savior stands in my defense so in the road you walk [Music] know your strength is gone and your heart feels good Lord remember God is greater than the storm [Music] the battle is the Lord when the water is he calls my name beats me cry [Music] this day should falter and makes me stand upon the Water [Music] heart feels sore [Music] amen [Music] foreign let's just stand I'd like to sing that little chorus before we ask our brother Paul to come up or as we ask our brother Paul to come up number 824 He Knows My Name [Music] he for my heart foreign [Music] he sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call I have a father he calls me his own and he'll never leave me no matter where I go he knows my name [Music] he knows my every thought he sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I call I have a father who calls me his own and you'll never leave me no matter where I go He Knows My Name he knows my every thought he sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call He Knows My Name [Music] he sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I call [Music] and we say thank you Lord to that amen that he hears us amen when we call foreign just I think we overlooked it brother Trevor shared with me and I overlooked that um whether Trevor sister carrier down visiting for the Traverse parents and Reno area just a little Trevor sharing that he sees his parents aging so quickly and feels a great need to interact and maintain a relationship with them and so let's just lift that up we miss our sister Sue today and all those who are not with us I want to speak to you this morning overall title again of things that are to be and I want to speak taking this from the scriptures uh blessed is the man and I believe today we can take our claim our position as the Blessed of almighty God thank you sister Sarah brother Isaac amen it's good to see Sister Sarah back it's been quite some time but we appreciate that let's turn in our Bibles to Psalms first chapter verses one through six and we're going to kind of at least I think at the moment wrap up our little thought on job and we'll see how this carries from The Book of Job down through our thought today carries from The Book of Job right into the book of Psalms and well Psalm and we know that God always works in continuity he does not um he does not just start and stop something does not leave us hanging but everything is in continuity and while you're turning maybe you're already there but I just want to tell you we went and visited I'm still a little confused we call him brother mellow but then as we went uh and met them it's brother Paul and sister Lillian and had a lovely visit with them Friday evening there and just a lovely couple they're just getting everything in order now those of us who were born and raised here have never left the continent never crossed an ocean to start a new life we probably don't realize the complexity but they are uh by God's grace they're just moving forward um and and uh soon will be established in their own apartment and uh uh they shared with us the Lord has blessed them with a vehicle and blessed our our brother with a job and uh so just lift up our um brother Paul sister Lillian their family they have uh uh four children here yeah I think it's four children four or five children are here some grandchildren are here they do have a son uh Paul Jr um uh is is uh handicapped young man has been since his birth and so just remember them in prayer and uh and certainly our brothers and sisters that have come and started a new life you know the complexities that are are part of that uh labor so certainly I believe we would have a compassion uh for our brother and sister amen Psalm 1 1-6 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth fruit his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper young Godly or not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveeth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor the sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish Heavenly Father we just ask Lord come Lord bless each brother each sister today wherever they might be Lord bless those that are here in the house of God today just speak to Hearts we pray for our brothers out on the road Lord just be with him keep them safe from their Journeys we thank you Father for the privilege and the joy it is to be Sons and Daughters of God we ask now in your precious name amen you may be seated foreign just a little prayer for me we just had a little bit of a little sickness I guess it is congestion and stuff amen now as we look at this today I want to tie this back together uh uh in uh our thoughts concerning job and we look at all that happened to job here was a man of God and we see the testimony of the word declares to us that God viewed him as a righteous man and uh one that would stand faithful in the test and are are uh the word of God chose us so clearly how that that he is offered up as a testimony as a witness uh and Satan is there very quickly believing uh believing a very um oh I'm just struggling with the right words here give me a moment just seeing that he can unravel or undo the plan of God that that the God's promise God's election could be undone but my brother and sister I say thank you Lord today that God's election cannot be undone there's no way that Satan can grab as it were the thread at the end and start to just unravel that but God has sealed this he's he's brought this to a fruition even though it is not a finished work as it is in the natural but God in the spiritual has made it a finished work and so we see that what's happening to job and and it wasn't just job my brother and sister we'll look today and realize that those that were around job Joe laments that uh all of my friends they have disowned me all of my neighbors and even my own family and all of this have pulled away from me I have not a friend I have no one and it was there that job is in this time and this this struggle but my brother and sister if you'll look through the word of God and follow the continuity of the scripture you'll find that God always brings everything in a full circle God is not allowing us to be tested just simply for the sake of being tested but God always brings it around for a spiritual growth for for a growth of our character and it is my brother and sister this thought was upon my mind as we were just had a little conversation downstairs God uses these things for building blocks now my brother and sister if we have no trial and no struggle in our life we have no building block and if we don't want to go I I think we should be able to say Lord I don't want to go through this life and not grow in nature and grow in character and grow in spirit I want to grow in the very presence of God into the stature of a perfect man and it's there that we preach about these things but sometimes I believe we failed to grasp the real true reality team of what God is trying to do and so God brings us around in a full circle we'll touch on this I I kind of struggled on what order to put some of this so I'm just going to go with what the god left or laid upon my heart here and we'll see this story is not only about God dealing with job it's easy to look at job and say my God offered him open the Hedge and I I know this might strike us my brother and sister is a little awkward but I think today that we should be able to lift our hands and lift our hearts and say thank you Lord to have confidence to open the Hedge around my life oh what we would be as pampered Christians if God kept the Hedge closed all the time and just let us Prosper without trials but my brother and sister it is fiery trials that molds the character of Sons and Daughters of God and so it's there that God was dealing and opened the Hedge on job but it didn't end with job it also come and was there to reveal you might say some flaw of character that was in those that were around job and we just view them as friends of job but I would like this morning to just present them as these were men that went to church with Joel these were people job had set and talked about the great things of God and talked about the word of God with and their families worshiped together and and were in that environment and God says you know what I'm not only going to prove job Satan's Focus was on job but God said I'm going to use this to bring about a growth in his friends and those around him and you know these were the men my brother and sister I hope this this strikes us deep in our hearts here to cause thought these are the men that should have been standing with job they should have been the men that said job I don't know what's going on I don't know why this is happening but I'm here for you job and I'm going to be praying for you should have been the men that were praying for job should have been the men that were encouraging job and the part my brother and sister of the tests that we face is a season that God chooses for us to stand alone I want you to just go look in the word it appeared that even God had stepped away from job it was caused to stand alone in that time and job if you study this out maybe I should have made this into a little longer series but as you study this out you'll see that while job puts questions of why this is happening and why is God allowing and what is this that I'm not seeing you don't find job forsaking God he has question marks he he has uncertainties but you'll find job comes to a certain place have any of us ever come that we've just kind of felt down in our spirit and you might even say Lord do I have a friend or why is this like it is and we'll come but have you ever noticed that God only allows this to go down to a certain point before God comes on this scene and starts to remind us you're not alone I have never left you I have not forsaken you I am here with you and so God is allowing job to come to a certain place and his friends certainly accelerated that what is it you've done job what secret sin what what are you hiding in your life and I pray this morning my brother and sister that wanna not one of us have something hiding in our life that we can say I'm going through a trial we're going through trouble and struggle but I'm not hiding anything and job kept telling them over and over again I am not hiding anything that I know of there's nothing in my life that I know of that is displeasing to God but yet they really didn't believe him but did it matter whether they believed him and doesn't matter if the world believes you we know in our hearts who we are we know God has taken us he's led us to the altar my brother and sister one of the things the prophet of God was concerned about years ago is that people came to the altar with dry eyes and got up with dry eyes and walked away and the scripture talks about how that they would be as that brittle stick we don't want to be the brittle stick my brother and sister it is so easy today for us as Sons and Daughters of God with the message opened before us to be able to stop and say Lord you know my heart and Lord with there be something unclean as the David spoke Lord Give Me A Clean Heart Lord amen that should be our heart's desire today don't Harbor that that if God opened the Hedge even further in our life that we wouldn't have to say yes there is something I'm hiding but to be like job and say I know of no sin in my life I have given myself to God all that I am all that I have is from him and is him and they said no job what is it come on open up what is it but God you see was working more than just job and it doesn't seem as though those that were unreasonably critical or unreasonably in their stance against job it doesn't seem as though that there's going to be a restoration there and I can tell you my brother and sister we don't always understand what's happening in our life but I will tell you I can say this from from the word of God not not to to be like oh we are Untouchable but the word says my brother and sister this work that's in you is already finished amen it's not about the trial you're facing today it's not about the struggle of today it's not about what this and the Very foreseeable future for you the word says that it's already finished and I say Lord help us to believe help us to just take that I don't need to understand it I don't need to explain it I need to believe it and when we will give God a chance to move in our life you will find that he will then at the end of it all bring it in a full circle and we will understand what is happening amen you see these thoughts that God is faithful can we say God is faithful amen God is faithful my brother and sister that should be something that's so anchored in our life that no matter what is happening we have this Anchor Point God is faithful whether it's troubles In the Flesh the family whatever kind of trouble we should be able to come back to this place Hebrews 13 5 says to us amen referring to it let your conversation be without covetness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee can we say Amen to that this morning come on Church we're a little quiet this morning but we ought to be able to say Amen to the word of God Amen no matter how tired you are or what is happening in your life you should be able to come to the place I believe this he said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you amen because I can stand on that word and believe that amen now we look here I want to just take you into Jeremiah 11-13 here again God using the Prophet Jeremiah to speak and declare but this word is just as true and faithful and established today as it was when it come from the prophet from the prophet Jeremiah's mouth from his voice for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord now my brother and sister when we were in South Africa there was a young man that had had some things happen in his life and he literally put this to me he said brother Paul because of the things that I have done I was backslid and the things that I have done is God punishing me my brother and sister how do you have an answer you don't know every equation of their life but all I could do was bring that young man to this scripture all I could do is bring him to the place this is what I want you to look at I don't want you to look at where you've been and what Satan is saying to you I want you to know that God's thoughts towards you are thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end and God has never the prophet of God I'm paraphrased this the prophet of God lays out the foundation that God did not call us to see us fail he called us to finish this race and not finish it as crawling across the finish line but victorious in Jesus Christ and so it's there that we look at this what is God's expected end for us this morning Saints of Grace what is God's expected in amen it is to complete the word that he has placed in us to bring it to a finality of us in him amen we're his bride we're a part of him we're not separated we are a part of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's in there that his expected in is not for us out here faltering in the wilderness his expected end Is Us in his presence us walking and living with him and ultimately when this is all finished to be standing in his presence and worshiping him Before the Throne of almighty God my brother and sister it's there that God gives this expected end I tell you we maybe should study the scripture a little more to know what that expected end is then shall he call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you you know a very common thing that is is spoken I young people once again referring back to being in South Africa brother Paul does God hear my prayers unlike every teenager I've listened to music I shouldn't Listen to I I have some behaviors I know I shouldn't have and when I pray does God hear my prayer my brother and sister the word of God says he hears our car our call our cry and he hearkens to us he's responding to us he didn't say because you have missed this no desert were and miss this over here I'm going to ignore you that's a human trait that's not a god trait my brother and sister God says you call I hearken amen and he says ye shall seek me I love this scripture you shall seek me and find me what a declaration to tell someone walking through the Wilderness of laodicea walking through the spirits of the age that we live in my brother and sister you can't hardly function in this world that there isn't Billboards and magazines and music and stuff everywhere it's saturated you can't even buy groceries without hearing the world much less go to a shopping mall I sometimes Find humor in that just simply how subtle Satan is that maybe there's something that was some music we were talking with the with the young adults this morning music my brother and sister it's such a part of us you might walk in a store and there's some song that used to be something important to you and so subtle does it come to you you walk out of the store and you're humming it and then you stop and say but that's not me I reject that because you see God is bringing us to a place we have to open the door to let those things in and God is giving us the strength to hold the door to only let him in so you see he says you shall seek me and find me and when ye shall search for me when with all your heart let's not make Saints of Grace that are here this morning whoever might hear this let's not make a half-hearted attempt at serving God a half-hearted attempt will not give us what we want it only satisfies the flesh for a moment as though that the idea that we can check off something that we have done well I tried to do this or I gave my little part I went to church my brother and sister let's not be half-hearted let's pour ourselves into it you know there's been many a man and many a woman on the earth that has been given great talents I remember reading a story once I believe this was France that uh this uh I can't remember his young man or a young woman but I believe his young man had incredible talents and and it was I I always get it wrong uh I think it was a violin it seems like a fiddle is more of a lively whatever I believe it was a violin this young man is instructor said you are destined to be one of the greatest violin players in the world But ultimately this young man come to naught disappeared right off the scene as he he was rising up through the ranks of this these uh you know I don't know how you even describe that you guys know the music there you start off just the beginners and move to the next and at some point right there there's those people who start to rise above everyone else in their age group and they rise above those older than them they rise up into the level they're playing better than adults in a practice for years and it's a gift that God has given them and they move on and this young man had been in that place and then he disappears from the scene and one day someone found him and says what has happened why did you disappear and he said I quit because it asks too much of me did he not have the ability he had the ability did he not have opportunity he had opportunity but he was not willing to give of himself to achieve the gift that had been placed in him and I believe that fits perfectly in our life serving God God has given you and I amen the very Life of Christ has come down the very nature it's been given to us are we gonna step back because it asks too much of us or are we going to say Lord see this is a difference in the flesh it might ask too much but my brother and sister in the spirit if we just say Lord I know this is what you called me to be this as it were talent that you have given to me Lord I am not going to bury it I'm not going to put it to the side I'm going to let this Talent bear fruit and let it rise up now Lord I've reached the end of what I can do now I need you amen it never was about our flesh and what we could do it's always been about him amen and certainly we can say this is what happened to job as job had reached an end my brother and sister scraping the boils how many of us hardened enough to sit around the ash Heap scraping our boils without feeling forsaken without feeling that something has went wrong but God held job and you might have your own Ash Heap this morning and you might have your own things in your life that you are dealing with but I'm here to tell you this morning God has not forsaken you hold on cry out to him Lord I need you because otherwise we'll come to the place that as it were job's own wife saying why don't you just curse God she lost more hope than job did she doesn't scrape a boil she doesn't lay in the ash Heap she doesn't deal with all the criticism and yet she has sunk lower than job himself and she is now declaring you should just Curse God and die and job says hmm you're not a fool woman but you're talking like one isn't that a little scary we go through trials and there could be people around us actually sink lower in the trial than we do they have less hope for the outcome than we do Lord help us but Satan that's Sly old Fox he knows how to do it because you know when job said I Harbor no secret sin his own wife didn't believe him that's pretty rough amen when you shall search for me with all your heart now this morning I think it's safe to say every one of us experiences we have challenge us but you realize that every experience is opening a channel to the presence of God is not simply just testing us to Let It Go but all of these things that we uh go through all these things that we face are opening up a channel now the prophet of God preached to us about how that all kinds of things stop up that channel he talks about how they would be Limbs and logs and leaves and sticks and all of this stuff clogging up the channel and when the channel is clogged nothing gets through it but yet the spirit is still coming but it's not going where it should so as it would be a river or a a creek or whatever it might be and a creek here in Idaho is that little stream running down the side of the Hill they call them Creeks back East but we're in Idaho it's a creek amen and so it's there my brother and sister that when that water gets stopped up in the channel it runs somewhere else it's got to go somewhere and God is here dealing with us Satan's constantly muddying the water and throwing things in trying to clog that up it might be family relations it might be in the marriage it might be in finances it might be in just personal complex but Satan's constantly pitching things in there to stop that up but the prophet of God talks about how once that channel when it is clear when it is open the presence of God the power of God flows down that channel into the believer's life and it changes the atmosphere it changes how we look at everything Can someone say I've been there amen I know what that is and when that channel is is cleared out all of that Throwdown suddenly we realize it doesn't matter what it is that is happening in the world around us that God is present he's with us now my brother and sister it's times that we are there or climb as it were to the Mountaintop but God is not just going to let you sit on the Mountaintop the rest of your life he takes it down Satan's still present he's still throwing sticks in the channel to clog it up he's still muddying the water and it's there that we go through Cycles hmm and someone say Amen you guys all stay up too late last night amen come on I can't even get a smile out of you over that one now look at this my brother and sister that's there that we go through these cycles of life at the bottom of a cycle is that the end of it all we just quit no sir God gives us a reminder that we are climbing the mountain once again we've had to cross over and we're climbing the mountain again we come back and we as humans go through this cycle now I would challenge you to study the message and you will see it very evident in the message a prophet's own Cycles being reflected to us his own times my brother and sister he didn't come with the dealings with the IRS and just brush that off as though it was nothing it troubled him greatly it affected him you can hear it in his voice when he's preaching any reference to the IRS to the government to this thing it's a burden to me he's talking about this he was just like us my brother and sister and so we're going through these Cycles but I want you to remember that we come to a time and we come to a place we either decide that God has a plan for my life and I'm going to press into the plan imagine you've got troubles and you pray into that trouble instead of fleeing from it you press into it why because God has already made a way through this situation in my life and I will overcome it what is happening things are being thrown out of the channel God is Not anointing everyone else to throw it out of the channel he's anointing us to throw it out of the channel and it goes right down to our young people going to their school work and whatever else I can't understand this I can't accomplish this Mao remember God is not causing you to step away to be discouraged to quit he wants you to dig deeper he wants you to put more effort and more prayer oh we can labor in the flesh in the mind all we want but he's wanting us to come into him and enter into him and say Lord I am your child I am of your family I have a need Lord and you said if I ask anything in your name you would Grant it and he knows my brother and sister that we're not I just heard a brother preaching the other day I thought it was very good he said you look God's doing God's blessing the bride God's blessing his people God is taking care of his people and we can stand here and hear the word say ask anything in my name and he said why is it we don't have the same Spirit and the same attitude as the world in the world out here if God granted unlimited Authority for them to ask this is how the brother put it he said you would see an unlimited Fleet of learjets because that's what they desire but the bride of Christ he's asking in his name and you would see her coming into Revelation coming into the presence of God acting God lead us Lord guide us Lord open the word to us Lord make this real and that's the difference of this denominational spirit and of the true holy spirit amen God working because the bride of Christ wants more of Christ she doesn't need another Fleet of Cadillacs she wants Christ that's what separates us amen so these experiences bring us amen ultimately in opening the channel into the presence of God my brother and sister you know that the opening of the seventh seal we've been right here in our church and seen the controversy that that raises up when you start talking about the seventh deal but you know what the opening of the seventh seal is not a Doctrine my brother and sister it is an experience and if no one's ever had that experience then to them it's nothing more than a Doctrine as this says this that says that that says that it can't be open or there will be you know this and that will happen over here oh my brother and sister when the experience comes when that experience comes it's like no I'm sorry I have been in his presence I know who he is I know what he desires for me he walks with me and he talks with me my brother and sister it's not a matter of talking about whether The Mercy Seat is off my brother and sister who's what this and this is going to happen at this time the bride of Christ is in the presence of almighty God that seventh seal which is Jesus Christ himself has been revealed to her no you can't explain it people want well show me show me a quote I can't show you an experience I can't show you what happened down inside but I can tell you it is real just like the tent Vision not brother and sister it was there they went into the tent and when they come out there was someone there saying what happened in there what was the answer they gave them they didn't say well we had a good old Holy Ghost Pentecostal experience of this and of that they come out and I don't know what happened but I'm changed because there it's not a Doctrine it's a experience it's God dealing right down into the depths of the Soul we're not just church-going Christians we are Christians by experience hmm job 19. as I talk about like the opening of the seventh seal you know in you when you look at this It just strikes you in job 19 or 25 he says I cut these scriptures very brief I'm sure you're familiar with them if not go read them but job comes to this time comes to this place and he makes this statement for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God this is not the man who is scraping boils around the fire wondering what has went wrong this is man is a man that has caught a revelation of what has happened in his life and who his relationship with God is and what it's going to do for him and the opening of that seal to him showed him that no matter what happened even though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God whom I shall see for the church's sake no Joe caught a revelation It's All About Me you know there's a few times my brother and sister that we can come and kind of you might say almost be selfish I want the Holy Ghost I want the relationship with Jesus Christ I want overcoming power few times that we can come it might sound selfish but what is God doing he's making this so personal to us and that we can sit there and say this isn't about and I'm sorry to say this in this fashion but I would trust you and understand it's not about you it's about me and each one of you should be able to stop and say I'm sorry but it's not about all of you it's about me but then collectively as the body of believers it is all of us that make up the body of Christ the bride every one of us that makes that up see just want to maybe give you a little homework if you would Job chapter 42 the very last chapter of job you'll see there I'm just going to draw out of verses 7 through 10. and as it was so that after the Lord had spoken these words unto job the Lord said and I'm just going to jump over these names and I'll struggle with trying to pronounce them he's telling them I'm not happy with you I'm not happy with you I'm not happy with not exactly how you treated job but you never even spoke positive of me as God you catch that you know my wrath is kindled against thee against our two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right they were actually putting this negative view on God himself as though God couldn't deliver God didn't know what he was doing this is all out of control so God is not very happy with these men who were job's friends not happy with them at all instead of coming in like they should have as real Christians and saying job we're going to come to your house you are sick you have all this issue we don't understand it but we're going to come to your house job and we're going to have a prayer meeting until God brings an understanding a change a correction a Revival whatever it is job we're here we're going to be at home job praying for you we're going to be in the marketplace job praying for you we're going to be a church job praying for you instead it was easy what's your secret sin what is your failure job a man who served God all these years what is your failure my brother and sister see how that negative Spirit just talking to the young adults there are some influences amen look at this my brother and sister it's always a spirit working with the spirit and it's either almighty God or it's the devil there's no halfway point let's quit fooling ourselves that we're only mildly backslid we either are or we aren't do us well to judge ourselves Brother Paul's not here to judge you today but it would do us well to judge ourselves where are we at you know maybe we need to put some technology sister Jerry's Grill my grill however you want to call it our Grill you know technology is so great you can put the little probe in in the the piece of meat and then you can go off about your day today around the house and just pull your phone out oh there's something wrong it's not getting hot oh well I'll deal with it at supper time you go out there and you got this piece of meat that's inedible what do you do I hope this little analogy catches you what do we do Saints we're barbecuing we we have guests for supper and the Wi-Fi your phone tells you that that it's 90 degrees inside the barbecue you don't ignore that you go and you do whatever it takes to get that Barbecue on fire get it hot to do what you wanted to do and I say God give us something amen the holy spirit is our Wi-Fi my brother and sister to show us whether we're hot or not and Lord I want to be hot I don't want to be just a lukewarm half-baked Christian I want the word to come and show me what I need to do to change my life or we can just sit here and say well I don't know church is so hard going to church all my friends are goofing off today my brother and sister are you going to go to hell because your friends went to hell that was a little blunt wasn't it maybe we need a little blunt once in a while amen I don't want to come to your house and eat a cold raw steak I want to eat something that was cooked and cooked correctly prepared correctly now in job 42 we see how God then is dealing with them and verse 18 or 8 I mean he tells them uh therefore you guys take the seven Bullocks seven Rams and go to my servant job my these friends are having a moment of Reckoning all of their criticism of Joel their basic expression that God was not enough to keep job that's where they were really at Saints they were speaking in a context that God was not enough to keep job that there is something that has crept in that even job don't know about and God says Nope you haven't spoken correctly of me now I want you to go take these seven Bullocks these seven Rams and I want you to go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you imagine the turn of events just a few days ago they're talking about Joe being backslid now God is coming and telling them you need job the backslid man to pray for you because he truly was sinless he truly had no hidden besetting sin he was truly just under the influence of the greatest battle ever fought and that is true my brother and sister you need to go back and listen to the prophet preach that again if that's not real to you you are in a battle and Satan is so convincing he'll convention you it's not worth it you don't belong there you can't live it you weren't a part of this he is so convincing we can walk away believing that but whenever the anointing of that spirit is broken and we can get back into the presence of almighty God we realize what has happened here Satan has spun a lie he's presented his story he's painted the picture but it's not God's picture we are God's picture amen we are not Satan's picture we are God's picture and so it's there that God comes in this case and says you know what you go and do this and my servant job will pray for you and for him will I accept I'm not going to accept it look at how God's working he's not going to accept it from job's religious friends God's only going to accept it from job the very man that they said you guys are crazy for believing God sent a prophet you guys are just nothing but a bunch of cult members well I tell you what the most amazing thing I've ever saw in my life is every denomination there is tells their churches what to do now I'm willing to open up I Pastor Grace which is my email I'm willing to let you see all of my mail I'm willing to let you other than the sensitive things of dealing with people's lives read and listen to every voicemail and text that I have with other ministers and have you show me where someone is telling us how to live someone holding us to an account or you'll have to deal with headquarters it doesn't exist but the very ones I find it ironic Saints the very ones that say this is a cult are getting their newsletters and their guidelines and their online directives and all of what your church can and can't do and they're getting that and being poured into them constantly and they say you're in a cult well I'm telling you my brother and sister the deceiving Spirit of the day is so blunt and it's so out in the open but it's not that it's the fact that the people are under delusion to believe a lie and so it's there that this is working that these people were sure job was the one that's wrong but here it is in job 42 God is telling them you're the one who made the mistake you're the one who didn't realize what was happening the plan of God was going to come to pass whether you guys are on board or not and you weren't but God rich in Mercy says you know what I'll tell you what you do you get the Realms and you get the Bullocks and you go to job and you get him to pray for you and from his prayer I'll accept it unless I deal with you after your folly and in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant job isn't this amazing joke down here in the ash Heap is still talking about how great his God is but as we shared here already my brother and sister when we look at this I wonder what they thought when job was there in chapter 19 and started to declare this this Revelation as it were that was unfamiliar to them and he starts to declare you know it doesn't matter what you guys think my redeemer liveth amen and I shall stand in the latter day and I owe my skin worms I'm done I'm toast but yet God's going to raise this body up our resurrection and bring us to a place to see that and we will see God my brother and sister they would have been thinking what is job talking about because they just like today were a cold formal representation of their Church are we going to be cold are we going to be formal but I do want to be a representation I want to be the right kind of representation I want to be able to represent that and have my Lord come and say you know well done my good and faithful servant you were a good representation of what I desired now we look at this and just see how that what happens is as they come and they did according as the Lord commanded verse 9 and the Lord also accepted job see this was a package deal job didn't pray a prayer Lord my worthless buddies here these no good buddies job made an honest from the heart sincere prayer concerning them and himself because by then he had realized all that the plan of God was and even in the times that he was low and he even had the question mark he realized at that point it was all a part of God's plan and God's plan will come to pass we're either on the boat or we're not amen now let's go back to Psalms 1. uh just uh take just a a moment more here look how this just rolls right out of job right into psalm now it's man who put the punctuation in the spacing and everything in the word of God God wrote it as one continuous flowing word that come forth and so we move now to Psalms 1 1 we read it as our opening scripture blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful oh my brother and sister to realize that this plan that God has for us we don't need to take advice from the ungodly what do we do about what's going on in my life I'm struggling I have these troubles what do I do that's not the place that you get your counsel my brother and sister they're going to be out there put your wife to work they're going to be out there you know if you just would get a another job work weekends don't you don't need to be in church on Sunday they give a promotion you know that's where the devil invented shift work shift differentials I can I can work I can work nights I can work weekends I'll make another 75 cents an hour no my brother and sister we don't need to go that direction we don't need advice from the world's way we need God's advice amen and so he said look at the effect on job from his friends when they started giving him counsel that was not godly counsel now I know some of this might go for like a lead balloon forgive me but I'm telling you I'd rather hear the truth and digest it than come later and find out that we are not you know when the scripture says that they're not going to be the ungodly is not going to be in the Judgment do you understand what that scripture means they're not going to come and stand you say but they will be judged no they're already judged the word has already judged them and it's there that just what the verdict of the Judgment of the word is is what is spoken at the white Throne judgment because they're already judged by the word but the righteous won't be judged my brother and sister because they've already been judged worthy by the word amen so there will be a white Throne judgment don't misunderstand there'll be a people standing up and their sins and everything being laid out before it but the judgment's already been done by the word and so they are not there see when it says that the Saints shall judge the wicked we're not going to be standing up there and going oh that was my old friend or my neighbor or my co-worker that was and and I'm sorry buddy but you know you're guilty no you're going to be there how are you going to judge them the word you're not going to be going well let's see I gotta let me read all the scriptures that you violated you know the very same ones that we had sometimes violated but the blood of Jesus Christ washed us and presented us and said we were worthy and they never sought forgiveness and they're there we don't have to read that to them it's already been judged get sidetracked on that topic so you see you look at this the friends had this effect and you know verse 2 this Believers Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night you know reminds me of the song Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus it's not this world here but I like this as we're closing here and he shall be like a tree planted by rivers of water this who I am somebody going to be kind of selfish this morning and just say this is who I am amen this is where the word shifted and now they're talking about me this is not talking about the Heathen not talking about anyone else this is where the word's talking about me and he me shall be like a tree planted by the river the water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and his Leaf talking pretty positive isn't it it's not coming down and saying well now this is God did this look we could never be planted it had to be God and we could never bring forth fruit it'd have to be God's fruit and our leaves would never no you know why the word has come in that fashion right there my brother and sister because God's already identified you and I as the word it's already identified us as being in Christ being one with him it's already identified it doesn't need to come every single time and say oh remember again you are remember again you are remember again you are when God identified you God identified you you forever amen for eternity you're identified now it's a human element that sometimes will stop and say well it's not me it's the lord well yes of course it is because if it was us we wouldn't last a minute it's God Christ in US Christ in you the hope of glory in that wonderful identified in the New Testament as a mystery Mysteries have to be revealed Mysteries have to be open I want to ask you has that mystery been identified in US that we in Christ the mystery oh my my oh my amen so let's look at this shall be like the tree planted by rivers of water which bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also thou not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper I like this identification I like this I claim this my brother and sister because what happens is drops right back to the ungodly it didn't leave any area in here there's no area in here to say but except for I had this happen in my life and but that happened in my life and I went to a church and had a bad pastor uh we went this and had this Pro no that doesn't leave any exceptions in there we are either my brother and sister the tree or we are the ungodly um y'all okay okay the ungodly are not so but are like chaff which the wind driveth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish now look at how God lays this out we're not here this morning my brother and sister talking as though we're unbelievers we are here as Believers we we believe this word of God but sometimes Satan just gets us so beat down we're just like job and we're just like job's friends and I don't want to be identified as job's friends but in the end job's friends even found Redemption so even in their in their uh not so Godly approach of dealing with their brothers and sister and the issues in the church and things of life in the church and of families in the church they didn't do such a good job in their treatment and their representation and how they lifted them up or pushed them down but God come along rich in Mercy and said I'll give you another chance you're going to make an offering and you're going to ask for prayer and I'll forgive you oh I say thank you Lord but I would rather be the one that says job I don't know what's going on in your life brother sister I don't name all your names this morning I don't know what's going on in your life but I'm going to lift you up in prayer I'm going to stand and say even if you have a secret sin even if you have a secret sin I'm going to go before my God and say Lord come and deal kindly with them deal with that take that out of their life not to look and say you know what I think the reason you're having troubles is because you are a sinner no my brother and sister I say this morning I believe if there's a question mark you are having troubles because your sons and daughters of God and God said I'm going to let you be tested and prove it oh Hallelujah blessed is the man blessed is the man that could stand in the house of the Lord hallelujah amen sister Sarah if you would come the uncertain sound brother Branham says this he says then over in Psalms the first psalm we read this blessed is the man who God this is how brother Branham brings this out will not impute to him unrighteousness or sin but the blessed man is a different man David's being saying that how blessed he was that the blessed man he was like a tree that was planted by rivers of water Psalms 1 and how that he would bear his fruit in the season and the ungodly would not be so but he would perish and so forth but the blessed man was God's man and I'm going to stand this morning with a boldness of confidence of Who We Are we are a blessed man of scripture we are blessed because we're God's people amen we're not standing here as our people we're not standing on our ability but we're standing on the word of God that he put in us and not just put in US my brother and sister as an unwanted deposit but he put in US of something we long for something we desire I long to be even a more blessed man I long to be even a greater representation of my Lord Jesus I long to be able to stand and have discernment and judgment as it is to pray and to lift up my brother and sister to support and stand if someone's got to be not one that stands to to keep things to hold things says be as it were the support be the unknown or the unnoticed I don't care my brother and sister just so I'm part of God's plan that's what I care about because he's the one that gives a blessing not this world not this world it's not our churches that give the blessing it's not the collective message around the world that gives a blessing to us it is our lord Jesus and I say Lord I want to be a blessed man Hallelujah God bless you this morning Saints let's just stand sing a song or two before we're dismissed amen Hallelujah now if I come across just a tad bit too excited this morning forgive me but you can't spend hours and days of your week just looking looking reading studying praying and and just walk away just yeah okay no there's something inside start stirring something inside starts boiling starts to Bubble Up and then hallelujah it's there and sooner or later it's got to be let go and well God just chose this way for us to Let It Go amen amen 700 in the morning when I Rise amen Hallelujah [Music] in the morning when I oh [Music] oh give me [Music] Give Me Jesus oh give me Jesus Jesus you can have all this world but give me a chance thank you when I am alone [Music] look at me please oh give me Jesus

let's just start with the chorus if we would really get in [Music] this worship and Saints just just thank him for what he's done for you your job experience you say brother Paul haven't been on a Nash Heap well yes you have you've faced the fiery trials and you've lived with the residue but remember [Music] it was God who had the confidence in you he's the one that said you know what I can

ever faithful Lord you never forsake us Lord no matter how hard the trial no matter how low we feel like we are Lord let us just stop and be able like job after Revelation struck him and be able to look up and be able to declare My Redeemer liveth there's nothing on this can ever take that away from us all nothing on this Earth can ever turn our eyes oh Lord maybe for a seasoned father but Lord nothing can turn our eyes from you keep us from you and I just pray father in the hard days the difficult times the struggle when it seems like there is not a friend nor just remind us Lord let these words come back to our mind Lord that my redeemer is faithful and true Lord just father you know the life of your Saints you know the life father I don't know the life and I try not to pry into their lives father but Lord Brother would desire for the leadership of your Holy Spirit to speak to us Lord if we might today be on an ash Heap and Lord maybe we are discouraged today Father Lord I would

with the words of Life Lord anoint me with the words of Life Lord Jesus as I would give counsel and advice to this body of Believers Lord let me have the words of life that would lift up and build and strengthen and restore Lord not words as though we have failed but rather Lord the words that bring us to Victory the words that bring us to life I say from My Heart Lord thank you for truly your mercies are new they're fresh every morning just ask you Lord deal kindly give strength give us courage in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless your Saints amen [Music] thank you [Music] foreign
