remember that one [Music] is that it okay well you know you have to you guys have to just realize that brother paul's reaching an age there's other clouds floating along sometimes they obscure the sun and a little word comes in mind and i'm sure i know what song that's and then you all look at me blankly so yeah this is it i just feel like something good is about to happen i just feel like something good is on its way he has promised that he'd [Music] jesus [Music] and brother is to be this very day i just feel like something good is about to happen i just feel like something good is on its way he has promised that he opened all of heaven and brother it could happen any day i have happened [Music] investment well of course we should be singing the verse hallelujah well i think i got my message across hallelujah i want to speak to you tonight on part two of something good is happening amen we're not looking for it to happen but it is happening can someone say thank you lord hallelujah amen my subject would be remember that we are only what we are by the grace of god and we'll take that just right out of thought tonight if we just stand i just want to share with you there were those in the church that were inquiring of one of the prayer requests that we had off of the mission site and brother tommy mckinstry i'm not sure exactly what city in great britain that he is in but uh we had prayer requests for his dad brother william mckinstry and uh so we followed through with that uh brother tommy was just very thrilled that someone was actually you know had remembered and his his dad is in a difficult situation just getting weaker every day as this cancer is afflicting him and brother tommy said that he himself and his dad brother william uh definitely appreciate your prayers a very difficult time for their family and uh brother william has been a real mainstay in the church and so they would just desire you continue to pray and i don't know if i'm supposed to share this or not but um i want you to see the humor of this about maybe i don't know i have to look at my phone again i don't want to exaggerate but maybe let's say 12 30 this morning my phone went ding and brother prashant's like glory to god we're coming to visit and so i say glory to god they're coming to visit so just pray for them i believe they're planning on being here this coming weekend and maybe even staying into this next week the way i understood it uh so let's just pray god give them traveling mercies i know they're excited and i know that you all love uh brother persona and sister akoncha just as much as jerry and i do so a little homecoming amen you know prayer changes things and it also changes addresses i hate men you know just saying just saying and uh so we want to remember them amen and you know as the lord just moved upon our sister concha you know just a difficult time uh you know to those that have had i know brother adam has had you know some back issues before and it can be uh debilitating it can just stop you you can't really do anything so let's just remember them sister concha and we're claiming an absolute complete healing amen galatians the sixth chapter we want to go through these 10 verses take a little thought nothing real deep tonight saints i i hope that's all right but just to take a little stroll through the bible is always a lovely thing and to learn the lessons amen and take them to heart to realize that if we took i know this is going to sound awkward to you but if we took all revelation out of the bible and we just simply read it we would still be blessed there is all of these words of wisdom that are just laid out there that we can look at that let's just start with verse one for an example brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault does that ever happen yeah we don't need revelation to figure out that happens ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness now i don't know maybe we're tainted because we do have revelation of the word but i look at this and it seems to me very cut and dry if a man believes he's spiritual and you see a brother overtaken in a fault what you should do is start out set in order to restore that brother not get in a hurry to see how fast we can kick him out of the church lest it would taint our reputation but to pull them in and let the preaching the washing of the water of the word deal with them and and do that and we're all guilty sometimes of not doing our part and god's been dealing with me on a couple little things i won't go into tonight but we know that that god is in control amen bear ye one another's burdens but brother paul and brother paul speaking to you i've got so many things on my plate there's just no room to bear someone else's burden i know that sounds selfish but i want you to understand i just have so much going on in my life i simply don't have time for you but that's not what the word said the word in very simple terms doesn't say when you can explain all of these things in all of these revelations and you can no it just simply tells us bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing now isn't that funny because when you think you're something there's no realization that you are nothing you are convinced this ship doesn't sail without me right and that's the anointing that comes with it we're so important this church couldn't function without paul but the scripture just said when he thinks he's something when he's nothing he deceiveth himself and i've repeated this phrase many times here in the church the greatest fool is a fool who fools himself you see if we get to the place we feel like we are it or we have the answer but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but and i want you this this verse 8 i want you to take this because we will tie this into a quote here in just a little bit he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting and let us not be weary in well-doing now saints i'm just i'll let you be seated in just a moment but i just want to drive this home i have suffered from that right there lord i have done all i can do i can't take another step i can't do another thing become weary but the problem was saints is we were trying to do it in our own flesh and not under the anointing of the holy ghost do you know how hard it is i have done it can we have a little confession time kill the cameras kill the sound i have come to this pulpit in great travail in times of my life and i have mechanically preached to you you probably could remember the times it'd be like i think that's dead on arrival but you see sometimes we can be in such great travail in our life that we have just become so weary that we just feel like it's all for naught and the devil's over here in the shadows licking his chops all i gotta do is hit this brother hit this sister one more time and i've got him finished but i want you to know how wonderful it is what god thinks of you and i that in the meantime while satan is winding up to get that lick on you god comes down and your bible might be laying there and some inspires you and you open it up and you go he that is in me is greater than he that is in this world and something breaks loose and flows through you and satan comes to knock you out and you're there get behind me he's like whoa this is not the guy i was dealing with this is not the the gal i was dealing with a few minutes ago what happened well i'll tell you what happened i got a father you've got a father he loves you so much a bridegroom however you want to put the terminology that loves you so much hallelujah for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith you may be seated heavenly father bless this time this word we pray in your precious name amen you know as we look through these scriptures i want to bring out just a couple points before we move on verse four if we could go back to that brother alex uh we'll look at this and i want to just drive home a little point my brother and sister that i find this is something that come from my childhood something that i saw and i still see and and that would be that people get so engrossed in what someone else would do it might be a pastor it might be a ministry it might be a individual and they're constantly talking about well you know one brother brother so and so and brother so-and-so or sister so-and-so or that family uh god sure answers their prayer they're sure doing things and they're this and they're that but the word right here tells us that we should come to a place that we prove our own work now when we take this if you take this in a carnal forefront you would say well okay i guess we go out and prove what we are but it's not us it's christ in us so we have to make sure that we have the correct context but we look at this see what we have to do is prove that the same god that come down with william branham according to the word of god is the same god that's here tonight it's the same god that is resident in your house resident in your soul amen we don't have to my brother and sister i know i've been accused had some people just very much chew me up that i i'm down on the prophet and i must be some kind of secret unbeliever no i'm sorry i sit and i read things in my chair oftentimes my the families doing their own thing i sit right there and read things in the message in the word of god and i cry like a baby to think the sacrifice that was made to bring the word to me i am not callous to what god called brother branham to do but i know my brother and sister that the word that was brought i had this brought up to me the other day what is the vindication of brother branham's ministry and once again my brother and sister the vindication to paul amen this is spelled op oh wait maybe i shouldn't have started to do that o p i n i o n that's it i got it this is opinion okay i want to present it to you opinion i look to what god used brother branham signs and wonders uh demons cast out healings and all of this thing but to paul haley the real vindication of this message is the fact it is producing in the year 2021 exactly what it was supposed to produce amen it wasn't a flash in the pan it wasn't some people that are all going to go back to their denomination and just you know run around in their and their tank tops and their surfer shorts and blah blah blah my brother and sister this word is producing a bride to jesus christ amen that's what means something to paul now i hope that doesn't offend anybody my brother and sister i've got to visit with people that were there in the meetings amen sister sarah's parents say they have personal testimony of what they got to see and it is supernatural but my brother and sister i have to have a revelation that the god that was there is the god that is here with me right now and so i'm not looking back into history to say well god was there in a certain year in a certain place to be able to stand with confidence and say god is here tonight with our young people he is here tonight with our needs for health he's here tonight for deliverance of spirits he's here tonight for blessings on the bride of christ so let us prove our own work my brother and sister that we can stand with a confidence before a world that would judge you harshly and say you know what you can't convince me any different i'm sorry i met god on the backside of my desert i didn't go to arabia but i went to the backside of my desert i met god and god is real so you can tell me this is all nonsense you can tell me this is all just a hoax you can do all of that but i can tell you you're wasting your breath amen because it becomes a very personal thing here because we have proven what god spoke to us see what he spoke to brother trevor sister kerry uh brother jason sister emmy sister sarah you know uh brother chris brother sergey whoever it might be what god dealt with you and guided you is not the same exact footstep he called me into and or you didn't come to walk in the same exact footstep so i have to not have cookie cutter proof this is a problem we have saints cookie cutter proof everybody's pointing to the same thing saying in vindicated vindicated and this is the example that they lift up i'm good with that on one side but i want to know where you're at i want to know what god did for you and is it real enough to stand the test of time and the fire because you ain't seen nothing yet amen i don't mean that bad so we look at this and realize that god has proven his word to you and i now as we are proving this word it brings us to the place that we are called now to bear one another's burdens but let's bring a little reconciliation to the word here you see we can't take our burden and come along and say you know if this church had prayed for me i wouldn't have backslid first off i don't know who prays for who and how long right i never want to sound boastful but i had a horrible night last night i woke up at 1 38 i could not go back to sleep i literally i told sister jerry when i woke up i i leaned over out of bed because the phone is actually on the floor and i was sure it was going to say it was you know 5 45 or 6 o'clock i was actually shocked when it said 138 i was like what in the world am i awake for and i laid there and i laid there and i laid there and then the power went wrap and quit altogether i have to share this to you i hope you don't mind a little humor so it woke sister jerry up and jerry's like well okay we better call idaho power make sure the powers they know that the power's out which they didn't i kind of thought they probably would we're walking through the house in the pitch black and i stepped on our teddy dogs squeaky toy and i just about had a heart attack it was like i'm like [Music] needless to say i had no need to go back to sleep for a long time that was that was caffeine i was i was an adrenaline caffeine mega shot but you see my brother and sister i can't come along and say you know i'm struggling in life and i'm not talking spiritually i'm talking about in a sense just having a hard time sleeping i do desire your prayers but it's all your fault no you see the words telling us i have to carry my burden to the altar i can't hand it to brother david and say brother david will you take my burdens to the altar because i just can't do it but do we share that we share that we help we pray we ought to now let's not turn into psychologists where we all are looking um sister gabriella there really appears to be something wrong i oh i know what it is you're left-handed i'm sorry i have an affinity for left-handed people i've got a wife i've got a son amen got a granddaughter look at this you see we should be in tune enough saints with one another when you see one with a burden lord help us no we don't have to do it physically and we don't even have to do it verbally in fact we're probably better off if we don't if we just go over and say you know what i'm going to help them carry their burden but then again we can't just dump our burden off and say you know i'm backslid now because nobody prayed for me you don't have a clue whether somebody prayed or not remember we have to get up and walk across the red sea on our own hallelujah i don't i remember seeing a cartoon once where it's it said something on the order of fred was re fred was afraid of water fred was reluctant to cross the red sea and it shows two guys dragging him and there's tracks from his heels going down through the red sea god's not going to do that saints we got to get up and say you know what i'm going to make it i'm going to go i'm going gonna press into this but when you look over and you see someone that would express to you i'm praying for you and i love you and we're gonna make it together my brother and sister it does something to avoid the the spirit of a man of a human amen and so we we look at this and realize that we have to uh uh carry our own burden amen we can't just throw it down and give it to the pastor and say it's his problem or give it to somebody else or give it to church as it were you have to bring your own burden to the lord but you have to come and look around you also and my brother and sister sometimes our trials that we are so under pressure uh we are sitting there so under pressure it's not about the trial at all god's testing you to see what you will do with that trial amen what will be the word test that you have in the time of that trial will we stop and say well god must not love me because this wouldn't be happening maybe god loves you so much more than you are able to fathom and he said there's a little defect a little something there that you need to get rid of and so god just loves you so much contrary to our human nature we as parents we love our children so much that we'll tell them 35 times don't do that and we call it love well i tell you what i've raised three kids that turned out somewhat normal amen for the presence of those that are here very normal but my brother and sister real love the word of god says is corrective it's not passive it's not padding it's not manipulative it's corrective and so if we really love then we will make sure that we approach it correctly ourself and we apply the correct antidote so that it will produce what love should produce now i want to go into god's chosen place of worship and uh just look at this now this is a prayer that we're starting with right at the start of the service he says our heavenly father as we now humbly approach this great throne of grace by faith we move into the beyonds where god and the angels and the cherubims and all the heavenly hosts is assembled together for he said there cannot be even a sparrow fall to the ground without the heavenly father knowing it how much more does he know when it know here when hundreds of people have their heads bowed and calling upon thee for special requests father look down upon the needy world tonight for we are a needy people and i lift my hand and say i am a needy person and i pray god that because we have assembled here and express to thee our faith in a living god who does answer prayer we have come out from among the world of the uncircumcised of the heart and ears and come out to live a separate life to live in confessing our faith in thee so here is you know what i always refer to as the quantifiers amen my brother and sister we can say well my faith i have a good farmer friend he's a good friend to me he doesn't want to talk about god he doesn't want to talk about church he doesn't want to talk about these things he says my my faith is very very personal and i don't like to discuss it my brother and sister the word of god says if you have faith you confess it to the world amen you you will not be found silent in that day you will not be the silent witness amen so it's there that it's just by singing of songs uh in your own privacy you know if you're kind of uh uh i don't mean it this way as it sounds but if you're kind of a socially awkward person right you you you get kind of bound up to stand up in public or something like that god understands that he made you the way you are you're not backslid because you're shy you're not backslid because your heart bout beats out of your chest when you know they would call upon you for something or the idea of having to get up and sing a song you're not backslid because of that but make sure that satan doesn't use those things to keep your worship silent amen find your way to worship god find your way it might be sisters when you're vacuuming amen to be in there amen did you know that the vacuums all run on the key of f and so you can sing with your vacuum amen in fact there's lovely songs that go uh with with that there's lovely songs that go with the harmonics of an old wore out tractor there's all kinds of things if you have joy in your heart your lips can find a way to worship amen are you with me i'm not just trying to be funny tonight but i'm telling you whatever your circumstance is you know you just like well you know my neighborhood think i'm pretty weird if i'm out screaming in the backyard do it while you mow the yard all they'll hear is thinking you're asking the wife for lemonade amen they won't know the difference it's fine we're not ashamed of that but just use the opportunity to worship god amen so as you look at this now we realize that god answers prayer i appreciate that brother chris when you come up here and and the very first words you say you know god answers prayer amen amen that's a testimony of what we're talking tonight amen something good is happening a bride is coming to life and she is this final voice to this final age and she will be that voice she won't talk about someday being a voice she will recognize i am the voice now and god has called me to be part of that voice oh hallelujah i love that i appreciate that amen you know i got a lot of farmer friends that are all kind of some of them a little bit mocking you know about preacher paul and this that and the other and you know what i've done i just i'm not going to be offended by it i just refuse to be offended so i've turned it around and here recently one of them said something about well what you've been talking about preacher paul and i said well if you've got a couple hours set down i'll tell you whoa i don't have time nor interest is what he's really saying but you see i'm not going to back up from that and be all embarrassed you know like well whatever no i'm sorry buddy sit down right here i'll tell you what i've been thinking about and i'm not only that give me five minutes i'll run over my pickup and i'll bring a bible over here and i'll show you what i'm talking about hallelujah amen so you see we're uh to live to live a separate life and to live in confessing our faith in thee i love this prayer amen that's why we're we're reading it tonight we've raised our hands saying we are needy dear god answer every one of their requests and then father we pray that you'll visit us tonight in the word we come here for correction i hope we can say amen for that for understanding right which is another more subtle or toned down word for revelation that we might know just how to live in this present day now let me throw this back in times past we had people my brother and sister when i was a child the little town of greenleaf became very anti-message very fast because people had no wisdom on how to deal with the people in the community and so people would walk up to the clerk in the little green leaf store and they would just tell them you know what you have to believe what we believe or you're going to hell now here's somebody who's been faithful in church their whole life they don't know any different now somebody's told them you have to stand where i'm at or you're going to hell see no wisdom no knowledge in the lord on how to approach that they would have been much better off sister and sister as it were man to man would have been much better off to have stood there and become their friend oh you have three children how old are they what do you guys like to do do you oh you have a garden you this and become a friend and at some point in time when you hear the door opening you can talk about these things of god and i'll tell you what it does if they never open the door you've got a friend and the scriptures make says make friends of those of the mammon that's not to go rub elbows and socialize and stay up till midnight in their backyard when they're doing whatever they do at midnight in their backyard but it's that they would look at you in the front yard and go hey how are you guys doing how's your family did you have a good church service yesterday they don't really have a desire to serve god like you do but you have this friendship but you see my brother and sister going back into my childhood it become a very hard harsh you either believe this or you definitely are on the fast track to hell imagine that the problem was as many of these parents i was friends with their kids and the kids would come and i'll censor that anyway you know things would be said and as a kid i i didn't understand and i would go no that's not what my dad says well what a defense startling isn't it you guys believe in a serpent and a tree in the garden that's that's just sick well no it's not like that well then what's it like i don't know how to explain it to you god help us to raise our young people up that they know what they believe they're not just message believers in a message church i'm not talking about nitty gritty you know going back through all of this stuff thumbing through the bible putting everybody in order but they need to know why that's why i appreciate what brother chris did for for youth group here uh what we believe my brother and sister it's right here in the bible amen this is this what we believe in it's right here in the bible it didn't come out off a golden plate buried behind a tree somewhere in illinois hallelujah it's out of the bible hallelujah don't let me get sidetracked tonight i had this really really short sermon and it's going haywire already amen so he says right here and then father we pray that you'll visit us tonight in the word we come here for correction for understanding that we might know just how to live in this present day i believe that's moving right here to 2021 and what to look forward to and what to do for we know the coming of the lord is drawing nigh according to all the signs that the prophets foretold we're nearing the time lord when complete deliverance will be given to your children now my brother and sister i don't care what's going on in your life i want you to look at these words right now and i want you to understand this is not brother branham's promise this is a scriptural promise that they will be the hour when we have complete deliverance over every spirit of laodicea amen we don't have to sit back and be knocked around blown around by every wind of doctrine by every spirit subjected to the devil's assault and harassment but we can stand with a complete confidence knowing who we are amen hallelujah for we know the coming of the lord is drawing nigh according to all the signs that the prophets foretold we're nearing the time lord when complete deliverance will be given to your children god let us everyone be there father may there not be one missing that's our purpose of being here lord we love you and we're trying to prepare for that hour and i can definitely say amen to that speak to us we ask again tonight and heal the sick and all the sick and afflicted that's in the building we pray that you will heal them lord you've got an affliction in your body tonight saints i encourage you right now lift a hand claim what it is that god amen he's your healer amen we don't have to have a specific time i can stand as it i i don't mean to point it back to me but i remember many many years ago standing you know and i've told this story you probably remembered about the the wart growth in my foot and the fact that i'd ruined my knee standing in church service around new year's in cloverdale and brother bischo coming up and standing on the edge of the platform and saying you know the prophet of god said communion is a good time to receive your healing well hallelujah i don't have to talk about someone that got healed at communion time my brother and sister i can talk about this boy getting healed at communion time amen by god's grace proved the word that that was true and it come and i received it and i said lord i am desperate and i need a touch from you and my god come on the scene and heal me and i have never been afflicted of that growth ever again in my life hallelujah amen heal the sick and all the sick and afflicted that's in the building we pray you will heal them lord and especially them with spiritual needs we pray that you'll save every lost soul fill every believer with the holy spirit now my brother and sister i'm going to just inject this i hope you don't mind as i get older and bolder but we got young people in our church that haven't been baptized they haven't uh fully submitted to the lord and i'm not going to lean on you i'm not going to pressurize you i'm not going to tell you that something's wrong with you if you don't do this but i am going to believe and i hope you don't mind if i confess right to your face then i believe god is going to come and touch lives of our young people and have them in a place where they recognize that god came for them amen our lord jesus died for them amen and that you can reach out and take a holds of that and then as it were pull the trigger and say you know what i'm going to give my heart to the lord i'm going to start right here as a child i don't need a bunch of scars i don't need a bunch of calluses there's a phrase where people say well they're out there doing that they're working on their testimony well i'm telling you there's some young people right inside the walls of the church that are working on their testimony that if the lord tarries they'll stand 5 10 15 20 years from now and say the lord has held me all the days of my life i did not have to go out into this slum that they call laodicea i didn't have to get marred with the muck of this world but god in his keeping power come and fill me with the holy ghost and i trust him and i give my life to him that's what i call working on a testimony hallelujah but sometimes you take somebody like brother paul talking about how he backslid and how he went out in the world and it turns stirs the heart strings and people are like oh it's so beautiful brother paul come back i'll tell you what i'd like to have i'd like to have a revelation and never left in the beginning that's what i really would have liked amen i didn't need to go out there and work on some testimony i would have liked to been like you young people and be able to stand one day and say you know what i've been in the house of the lord all my life hallelujah i'll just tell it to you straight amen we pray that all the sick and afflicted it's in the building we pray you will heal them lord and especially them with spiritual needs we pray you'll save every lost soul fill every believer with the holy spirit and renew the strength and power in your believing children grant these things father we ask much because you told us to ask ask abundance ask for great things many of them that our joys might be made full and we ask them in jesus christ's name amen when i was studying and i read this prayer it stirred my heart i i'd have to say it just melted it i was just like lord that there it is just uh i believe that would be the prayer of every pastor every believer every parent you know lord just come in here and and just move father a healing of the body is wonderful you know just uh reading you know brother branham talking about howdy right you know she could have just asked for the healing of her sister and people would have said isn't that so wonderful he had that opportunity to ask a blessing of god and now her sister is no longer a but you see my brother and sister you can be filled with the holy ghost and be a amen but you can be the perfect athlete the olympic athlete go to hell amen so what would we really choose amen had he right she chose the right thing thank the lord for that amen now look at this we want to go on into a total deliverance hope you guys don't mind just had a few quotes it's kind of the way my thoughts went now brother brown i'm talking in a total deliverance he said if our hearts condemn us go back and go back into these sermons right we just have a moment just to reach in and pull a little chunk out if our heart condemns us comma pause we want complete deliverance amen if your heart condemns you don't run away amen don't don't don't flee run to the cross we don't want to be a halfway church isn't that right grace we want to be a real church or no church at all we want to be real christians or no christians at all we want total deliverance from our habits from our sin from our evil thinking from our evil doing from our negligence whoa look what he threw right in the line with the guy that might be corrupt negligence oh but what did he say iniquity those knowing to do it and not doing it to them it is sin and so is evil thinking and evil doing whatever we've done we want total deliverance so that when the people come into this church can we read this present tense when people come into this church to be prayed for there will be just this little group now i i don't know about these numbers here i'm pretty happy where we're at but maybe not over a hundred or two sitting here but they'll be completely in the hands of god now saints i'm not trying to force you to be interactive with me tonight but don't we want to be that kind of church that is regardless of the number just completely in the hands of god amen just so completely committed to god that god says i know i can trust this group of believers because they're speaking from their heart and they back it up with their life and they believe the word and they say amen to the word and the word is them amen and when we pray and god will hear from heaven god wants somebody that he can hold in his hands somebody that he can say i got confidence in and i can send this my sick servant to the branham tabernacle to grace tabernacle at jeffersonville at nampa and that group of people are one accord you realize saints i don't think there's a disunity in our church so don't anybody get let that spirit come but you see over and over again if you go study the message brother branham's talking about how there has to be a one accord there has to be a unity we can't have somebody over here spewing out venom and it be you know okay we'll just uh we'll like a sliver you know we'll just encapsulate that oh i shouldn't even even bring this up but saints that's why sometime back here brother paul seemed like a rabid dog because you see if we leave that spirit sitting in the sanctuary then we'll wonder why god's not moving in our midst we'll wonder why our kids hey look i'm telling you the truth these things happen be right in a message church in the deacons busting kids playing video games on their phones i don't want that i want the power of god i want the holy spirit here when our kids come to church they come to church because they know god is real and they want to grow up and live up to that expectation because mama lives up to it and daddy lives up to it and the deacon lives up to it and their best friends live up to it and their best friends parents live up to it and the pastor lives up to it and the ministers live up to it and they can look out and say that's not fake that's real amen but remember no amount of words will overcome our actions brother brown says i don't say a lot at funerals because they already saw their actions no i'm not talking about church tonight that's not the funeral he's talking about but you see it's important saints now this i'm just turning the heat up now you're not frogs but i'm just going to turn the heat up okay is that all right amen so the people and that group of people are one accord what is the final words there something will happen we don't have to sit there and hope our kids will get saved i hope so and so will get delivered hope god will come on the scene for someone who's sick when we can come into these positions that lines up with god's word something will happen i say lord i want to be part of the catalyst that makes something happen i want to be part of that moving of the holy spirit i don't want to be the boat anchor hallelujah amen i don't want to be the boat anchor you know saints uh there's a little bit humorous but i'll just tell you to make the point i saw a video one time this is i think lake of the ozarks and these guys are going up the that's a huge lake down there in arkansas and they're they're going up the lake in their boat and they look over and they're gaining on this other boat uh pretty fast and as they get up beside of it that all of a sudden you know the one guy turns his camera and you hear words and some of the words aren't the kindest but they're like look at these people look at these people look at that look at that and they edged their boat over and here's a boat going up the lake with the trailer still attached wow praise the lord god come and moved in our midst now i'm pointing at mtp but there was a brother sister child teenager whatever with their trailer still attached and we wonder why god won't move in our midst come on saints are you with me see we've got to get to the place god intended us to be in and i'm not saying we're not headed there right because i want you to go back to my title something good is happening amen i'm not speaking down on you tonight i'm actually speaking up to you hallelujah something good is happening why because we are becoming the word and the word is becoming us and we are manifesting the very thing god said i will do in this laodicean time at the closing of the book uh there's going to be a people that will bring the rest of the bible to culmination and that they without us whoa hallelujah that ought to get somebody excited they without us cannot be made perfect oh god i want to help them be perfect oh but i need to be perfect in the word first amen oh hold this do that move that look i asked you to do that five minutes ago and then of course your wife is a sweet angel said actually it was a minute and 45 seconds ago lord give me patience right now come on saints god's working on us and we should be so happy we should look at this and say thank you lord that i'm not who i used to be because you are bringing this word to pass in me oh hallelujah oh hallelujah that might not mean much to some of you but i'm telling you somebody like me means quite a bit hallelujah well look what he does for us in the condition we're in now as brother brown's words not ours but let me read it again and we can highlight that in bright red and put an underline on it look what he does for us in the condition that we're in i want you to think about that saints i'm going to just rub you a little bit raw we don't read our bible like we should we don't pray like we should we don't have the right attitudes and god still comes down and shakes heaven and earth for you and i oh there ought to be hands up saying thank you lord lord because even in the condition that i'm in some days of my life stressed out struggling lord and you still come on the scene i'm telling you god loves us more than we could even ever love ourself what would he do if we were one heart and one accord the only way we can do that is to unify our parts together with brotherly love obey oh my goodness huh let me stop for a moment we do believe god sent a prophet right is it okay have humor is grace tabernacle humored or humorless i hope we can have a little humor because i i don't mean just frivolous humor but my brother and sister sometimes it's good laugh or cry laugh or and cry unify unify our hearts together with brotherly love officers of the church and the pastor that we don't have or a disobedient pastor because he won't preach the true word i'm not scanning your hope the reason i say these things saints is spirits come in a certain fashion that can say we have unity but what is it with that's right we can all agree but if we're wrong we're just all wrong because 10 wrongs do not make a right and this is a prophet's words not mine amen he said we unify our hearts together with brotherly love obey the officers of the church in other words if the deacon says your kid's misbehaving don't fight with him that's just a simple simple analogy and the pastor because you see honestly saints sorry about the older bolder thing you know i just not that far past my 59th birthday here and i just fell off another cliff if you can't open your heart to hear your pastor you've got the wrong pastor time to put an ad in messagepastors.com help wanted because you see if you come to church and you reject everything that's preached to you you may as well not come because we're well on our way of becoming a social structure oh and if you need me to find the quotes where brother branham preached against that then you haven't searched the message very hard they are abundant where the prophet of god hammers that over and over and over again they're not churches they're lodges oh god help us never to go there i'm not picking on nobody don't misunderstand me i'm not preaching against the so and so is down yonder and the so-and-so is a thousand miles away and the so-and-so is over there i'm not i'm preaching to you and i because i want you and i to mature in this word and not be derailed by somebody that peddles some sweet smelling stuff hallelujah officer the church the pastor and the pastor obey god see we can't leave that out then god works through the pastor through the board down into the church and all together one unit to the kingdom of god then god will hear when we have a unified group that's when god hears the saints when we have a unified group not dysfunctional not one that's why the word of god says that he considers an abomination a curse for someone to so sows discord into the body of believers right because he's tearing the heart right out of the believers where no one cares brother and trevor going brother trevor going sister kerry going through a hard time well i remember that they did this and this i ain't praying for them praise the lord i've got the holy ghost i've got some kind of ghost wrong spirit unified let nothing bother you don't be dismayed at anything now that's the kind of person that god ordained to take the land moses was complete he was a man that wouldn't compromise if there were stews and fusses and so forth he wouldn't compromise that's what god wants us that's what god wants us now pharaoh wanted to agree said moses you all can go but you leave your children behind children grace tabernacle if i have to swim upstream towards hell you can expect that hand around your neck and i'm not choking you you can expect a hand on your ankle you can expect that hand on your caller you can expect that hand we're not letting the devil have you i'm sorry amen we're not throwing we're not throwing you out what was that malik was that the spirit of malik that was the one that they uh killed the children malek amen idaho english sister kerry you see my brother and sister i've witnessed it people praise god we're speaking in tongues we're doing this and their kids are getting drunk and terrorizing the town and every testimony they had down at the marketplace god so strong in our church was undone by the behavior of their children and they said oh praise god that's why i heard this years ago over and over again well they're just working on their testimony hallelujah come on saints i could i could share some things with you that i witnessed my own self that might just shock you of days gone by i know brother isaac share some things that will talk you message kids we're not message kids we're sons and daughters of god and we as the adult version of sons and daughters of god need to live a testimony that our children say i wouldn't have a problem being my mom being my dad being like my pastor pastor's wife this minister his wife well you know you don't want to really be me but you know what i'm talking about moses complete okay that's what god wants us now pharaoh wanted to agree moses you can all go but you leave your children behind or leave some of your cattle back here amen and that's the way the devil wants a christian to come it'll be all right for you to join the church come on some of this is just real straightforward saints i chose it on purpose well i don't believe i chose it i believe god led me to it praise the lord i'm a message believer but i ain't never forgiven the jones sorry can't happen best thing you can do is walk out of this church maybe you can't do it tonight they might live 100 miles away a thousand miles away but the best thing you can do is get your courage up and go face to face and just say i don't care who is right or wrong i don't care we're not even going to discuss who offended who or whatever you please forgive me and you know if you're dealing with a real christian they're going to try and say well it really wasn't your fault it was my fault no we're not discussing that we're not going back and we're not digging up the garden to see who had the right we're gonna just say i want you to forgive me but you see i'm gonna throw this in sister jerry and i have practiced that in certain circumstances and had people look us in the face what did you do i'm sorry it really is not about it i ask you forgive me well it's a good deal none of you knew me when i was young you know communion was a big deal in church when i was a kid it'd take two to three hours because everybody lined up to everybody and said i'm so sorry i thought bad thoughts about you and it wasn't really done until everybody had you know 150 x's on their forehead and here's paul doesn't have a clue about serving god because it wasn't really something they drilled into the kids in that church imagine the look on a sister's face when paul dutifully lines up with everyone else and goes through the line brother i want you to forgive me oh what's wrong i said you were stupid sister forgive me who why i said you were fat you think i'm being funny it was that ridiculous why no revelation at all because the real revelation of the word that if i had fought those words which i did the holy ghost the prophet of god said when god lays that on your heart not when the line that communion is fixing to take place when god lays it on your heart is when we go and say i'm sorry i said what i said i'm sorry what i did and we come into communion and everybody's like wow this must be a perfect church but you see why it looks perfect is because there's unity in that body and they are all here and they are unite and we're saying i want the water clear i want everything clear i want it to be that that god would be pleased with us are you with me saints amen this is our job not let it not let it drag out well i tell you what i do i'd ask them forgive me if they ask me to forgive them first that's not scriptural no if you know there's something there go and say you know what forgive me i might not even know what i've done but forgive me because we need to clear this out see you don't have to give up you can bring you don't but you don't never forgive jones it'll be all right if you can bring in your if you can go you don't have to give up you're smoking you're drinking you're lying you're stealing your fault finding your backbiting you don't have to give that up just join the church but moses wasn't a compromiser he wanted complete deliverance he said we'll not leave one hoof behind amen we'll take everything that belonged to us when we go to worship the lord that's the way the church ought to be we'll take righteousness we'll take holiness we'll take the holy spirit we'll take a unified group when we go to the altar we be a real group we'll leave nothing behind we'll take everything there won't be one hoof stay back here you know and the people can pray in such a way till the devil will have to give in now saints i'm not trying to force an issue on you tonight but just the burden on my heart are we on the same thought are we of one mind are we one accord is this a desire that we have amen the days of like playing church amen i pray that they are just so far behind us that we just never even look twice at playing church hallelujah you know on the internet today we have what they call influencers are you familiar with it these are people that have an opinion they might be handsome they might be pretty they might have a real personality they can really talk well amen some people say preachers or influencers if he doesn't have the holy ghost you can say he's an influencer and he's got the holy ghost it's god doing the influencing amen but influencers typically in the world we live in today will go on something like youtube twitter uh um pinterest all of these things they influence people to go certain ways and oftentimes there's a sponsor because that company likes this person's message and how they present it and they can influence people and typically you might see that they have hundreds of thousands of followers and and uh constantly doing now my brother and sister these people peddle an opinion to influence others to follow fact or what they perceive as fact now you find these people everywhere now sister sue if you're listening tonight part of this sermon i say thank you for she always gives me these history books in the war and i'm closing saints but i want you to catch this part right here refugees often times they are under the influence of influencers in a book that sister sue just shared with me gave to me as a gift refugees in the great war in france walking the roads headed north they're sharing the road with refugees from the war headed south how can this be they're both fleeing from the war but they're just going to wherever the other one was displaced from no sanctuary no refuge for them no place of sanctuary pressing forward and in many cases people collapsing on the road in in great racking sobs to find that they thought that there was some place that they were going where there would be no war where there would be peace where they could settle down and they find themselves in great despair because the very place that they were so excited to press into is in conflict and many times they literally collapsed on the side of the road and didn't move for days in despair because all the hope that they had has now evaporated because of the message from someone else who's fleeing the war come on i hope you catch this the laodicean war is everywhere you cannot go north and escape it you cannot go south and escape it you cannot go west and escape it you cannot go east and escape it in fact if you simply uh close the doors and huddle inside of your own house it will come and creep its way right into your house the laodicean war is not something to be a refugee from but it is something for you and i to stand up with the rally cry with the battle cry and be able to look at one another and say brother sister i've got your back i've got you we'll fight this we will not give up amen to sing the song onward christian soldier let it not be just a cute song but let it be the reminder that we're not here to flee from the presence of laodicea we're not here to try and hide our children from the effects of laodicea my brother and sister we're here to empower our children in laodicea we're here to show our children they can live the overcoming life they can be victorious hallelujah my brother and sister it's not a time for us to flee from our problem it's time for us to face the problem head on if we need more of the holy ghost it's right here for us we need a deliverance from a situation it's right here deliverance is right in our midst and we need some encouragement oh i tell you sometimes i need some encouragement amen i just need something you know i i took up drinking some coffee because i thought it might help but you know coffee don't do one single thing for encouragement in fact i haven't figured out much it does do that you see the laodicean war you only find one group of people that have purpose in laodicea and they're the ones that are pressing to christ and there it gives oh come on let can i can i be real carnal when i have just an ounce of permission to be just a tad bit carnal brothers you want to be successful in business point towards christ because the more you pour in him he says you seek me first and i'll add all the rest of this stuff to you amen but what we do is we go out here so far and we get sidetracked and we get turned this way and we get turned to that and then pretty soon we join the the multitude of the disappointed you know that's one of the gr greatest or the biggest uh sex there is in the in the message or one of the biggest groups it's in the message is the disappointed they're the ones happy with pastors they don't want to sit home and listen to a tape they don't want to go sit in a building listen to a tape they don't want anybody to tell them what to do they're waiting for brother branham to come back and i'm sorry but i just don't see that in the word of god amen so they sit there in a place and i know people like this they sit there with three and four hundred thousand dollars worth of ties that they're going to give back to brother branham soon as he comes back but they don't have any scripture to back it up and i'm not picking on them for that fact why i'm picking on them saints is because they have chosen to join the group of the disappointed and we live in an hour when the word of god a prophet's words said the holy ghost he said he is here we got no reason to be disappointed we got every reason to press into his word and believe it and confess it and stand up and start marching into the battle we're not here i'm just reading the same book sister shared with me amen there was a general that was there and he said the very best defense is offense and when he come into world war one all the trenches were dug and they just sat there every day and basically the people who died got hit by a a balm or a a mortar shell that come and crashed into their their place and nobody charged nobody there was no face to face they just hunkered down in their trenches amen every sunday and wednesday they didn't do anything imagine where that new pastor moved into town come on saints can you be with me that new pastor coming to town he says and i want you guys to all get ready clean your guns get your stuff ready if you need new boots we'll get your new boots if you need more ammunition we'll get you more ammunition they're like what's going on well in two days time we are all climbing out of this trench and we're running across this 100 yards of no man's land and we are chasing the germans out of their chain trench and we are not stopping until we have chased them beyond those trees and people went i know brother jewels just came through town and preached we could be delivered but we know how it is y'all still love me but you know happen on the wednesday of that week 10 000 men died but they chased the germans in fact much farther than beyond the trees they didn't stop chasing them for miles i hope you catch this but somebody had to die amen somebody had to come to the place whether it's the altar at home the altar in the heart or the altar in the church somebody had to come to the place they said i'm willing to die and they later calculated those 10 000 men maybe saved as many as 50 000 lives sister i'm not here on emotion tonight saints just a little reminder saints of grace we need to make sure we're dead we need to make sure that our best defense is offense that we are not digging a hole somewhere to defend ourselves but we're going to stand up and say count me in on the battle because we're going to chase the devil out of our church we're going to chase the devil out of our homes we're going to chase them out of our friends homes our brothers sisters home we're going to stand together shoulder to shoulder because we believe this word and it's not just god sent a prophet i believe the words that he preached amen and those words were to bring a revival amongst the people and set everything in order oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my i'll just forgo this last quote brother brown's talking about how when you see people and i think about our church right here can i can i have just a couple more minutes i'll try not to commentate too much on it and we look here we see they're just a shadow anyhow we're a shadow i look here on the platform see men that moves and look out on the streets see men and women that moves they got life yet it cannot be real life because it's death in it and david said i'll walk through the valley the shadow of death now it takes so much light to make a shadow there has to be so much light and if it altogether darkness it cannot make a shadow see it has to be so much light in the dark to make a shadow now it depends on which one of those sides that you're leaning to if i see a man walking fine looking young man saints i'm sorry but when i read this quote i think about the young families we have right here in our church the little children and our our mothers our sisters with their babies and as i read this quote it struck my heart i thought lord come quickly come quickly but lord if you don't come quickly make sure we lord just give us something special to stand this test of time [Music] if i see a man walking fine looking young man in a few years i watch his hair turn gray and slip out and his shoulders droop down beautiful young girl standing with a sainted godly face on her and standing and praising god now come back in a few years and find her stoop shoulder packing to her children [Music] oh my there it shows that in the body there is death no matter how well it is and how lovely it looks it's still got death in it now watch which way that spirit in there leans now look how brother branham turns this saints i watch which way that spirit in there leans and if it's always representing the light speaking of the light talking of the light it'll go with the light but if it's always on the other side of the world the things of the world influenced by the world there is nothing but it to turn into darkness when it dies into outer darkness so you see what we are we must remember that we are only what we are by the grace of god and none of us can brag about it we can only bow in adoration and humility before god and give praise to him for his goodness and we just stand and worship the lord for a minute or two brother jason would you have a song or two or three oh god bless you saints i love you so much [Music] so [Music] onward christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of jesus going on before christ the royal master leads against the fall forward [Music] marching as to warm with the cross of jesus going on before like a mighty army was a church of god brothers we [Music] [Music] in charity onward christian
