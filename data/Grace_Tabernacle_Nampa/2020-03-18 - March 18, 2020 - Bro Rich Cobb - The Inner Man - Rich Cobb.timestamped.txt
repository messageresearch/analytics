[26:36] Lord according to the word Lord we pray
[26:38] for that Lord Jesus thank you so much
[26:41] Lord amen and amen
[26:43] praise the Lord Jesus amen hallelujah
[26:46] God is good isn't he all the time praise
[26:51] the Lord amen
[26:53] it's just good to be here tonight and
[26:57] good to be Mike's people of like
[27:00] precious faith and we just want to see
[27:04] God work the way he wants to work amen
[27:08] it's always a blessing to be among his
[27:13] people and we just greet you in the name
[27:16] of the Lord bring greetings from
[27:17] Monmouth and we have been reduced 25
[27:24] people in a meeting so this weekend is
[27:26] going to be an experiment we're gonna
[27:28] have two on Saturday and two on on
[27:30] Sunday amen so divided everybody up in
[27:33] groups and I said I'm sorry I can't
[27:36] please everybody but this is how it's
[27:37] going
[27:38] so praise the Lord and but God is he's
[27:43] no lesser of God in times of trouble
[27:45] Amen I'm getting ready to retire in June
[27:48] and I just been saying all along no
[27:51] matter if my retirement there or not and
[27:54] I tell you God is taking me on my word
[27:56] amen because most of the retirement at
[28:00] least on one side of it is it's probably
[28:02] half but I'm not worried about that
[28:05] because little as much when God is in it
[28:07] when he has started something you'll
[28:09] finish something a man and we grew up
[28:12] living by faith and all of us here have
[28:14] grown up living by faith in and oh I
[28:17] forgot brother Eugene from Ukraine said
[28:21] to greet the people that would know him
[28:22] from Dennis came in I don't know if
[28:24] there's any here or not
[28:25] but he right there he just gave a
[28:29] testimony of a woman at their church who
[28:32] had been plagued with smoking and they
[28:34] all prayed for she said this is it I got
[28:37] to be delivered and they all prayed for
[28:39] and they'd seen a black cloud leave her
[28:42] and go out the door amen and so I tell
[28:44] you what you get closer to God when you
[28:47] need him when you're under persecution
[28:48] amen and so this light affliction that
[28:50] we have hey Matt it's only make you
[28:54] stronger praise the Lord let's stand and
[28:57] turn to Revelation chapter 3 Revelation
[29:01] chapter 3 verse 14 through 19 and we're
[29:05] going to read there's going to be some
[29:09] other scriptures and inserted in between
[29:11] but we're going to read through
[29:13] revelation 3:14 through 19 some of the
[29:17] other scriptures in between our
[29:19] Colossians 1:18 and second Corinthians
[29:22] 5:19 and some others amen and unto the
[29:27] Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans
[29:28] write these things saith the Amen the
[29:31] faithful and true witness the beginning
[29:34] of the creation of God Lord we want you
[29:38] to speak your mind tonight I just thank
[29:40] you so much Lord God God you did it
[29:43] again I want to go another direction but
[29:45] God you kept bringing me back to this
[29:46] sermon and so I just God I'm believing
[29:49] and trust in God this will speak to the
[29:51] ha
[29:51] of someone here tonight Lord in the name
[29:54] of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord you
[29:56] may be seated and so I like that because
[30:00] unto the Angel of the Church of the
[30:02] Laodiceans write these things saith the
[30:04] Amen the faithful and true witness the
[30:06] beginning of the creation of God he
[30:08] immediately establishes who he is what
[30:12] he will do amen
[30:14] and so he's victorious he's faithful a
[30:17] man he's true
[30:18] praise the Lord Jesus but he says at the
[30:20] end the beginning of the creation of God
[30:22] and we know that that Jesus Christ was
[30:25] the beginning of the creation of God
[30:27] amen
[30:27] because he was the firstborn from the
[30:29] dead he was the first of the super race
[30:32] amen in in the in the sense of he was
[30:36] God he was flesh but had God dwelling in
[30:39] him amen and he was that wave sheaf to
[30:41] the rest of the world to the end of time
[30:43] that you and I would live that way
[30:45] victorious and overcoming Amen
[30:47] Colossians 1:18 it says and he is the
[30:51] head of the body the church who is the
[30:53] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[30:55] that in all things he might have the
[30:58] preeminence amen
[30:59] and so his idea of of lordship is to
[31:03] have the preeminence through our flesh
[31:05] as God the Father had preeminence
[31:07] through his flesh amen and he says I do
[31:10] nothing unless I see the father do it
[31:12] amen
[31:13] and with us we can say we do nothing
[31:15] unless the Spirit allows us to see it in
[31:18] the word and so the difference with the
[31:21] bride is that she sees and does things
[31:23] in the time and the season of the word
[31:25] amen she doesn't get ahead of God amen
[31:28] but she she does exactly what he wants
[31:32] her to do amen that's why our decision
[31:34] to slow down amen
[31:36] because now we're searching and praying
[31:38] for what the what the Word of God wants
[31:40] us to do amen second Corinthians 5:19 it
[31:44] says to it that God was in Christ
[31:47] reconciling the world unto himself not
[31:51] imputing the trespass their trespasses
[31:54] unto them and hath committed unto us the
[31:57] word of reconciliation oh I love that
[32:00] amen we serve a God who knew us when we
[32:03] were born he
[32:05] we didn't know him but we were permitted
[32:07] to calm his brother Baron said we were
[32:09] permitted to have a soul but the soul
[32:12] was of the devil a man because it only
[32:15] knew unbelief but when we were of age he
[32:18] began to draw us to himself and he
[32:20] brought us to the point where we
[32:22] received him a man by faith and then we
[32:24] were justified and sanctified and we
[32:26] came and received the gift of the Holy
[32:29] Spirit after we were baptized in the
[32:31] name of the Lord Jesus Christ but his
[32:33] whole nature is reconciliation and so
[32:36] that's why those that smoke those that
[32:39] may be addicted to different drugs or
[32:41] addicted to habits or things Amen God is
[32:44] here to reconcile them back amen don't
[32:47] give up on your relatives don't give up
[32:48] on those who you think are not savable
[32:52] amen because look at Paul Amen he was he
[32:56] they thought he was unsavable that he
[33:01] exists and they didn't even know it amen
[33:03] hallelujah God is a miracle working God
[33:08] he's the god of reconciliation and so
[33:11] God is a spirit and so he had to create
[33:16] a body a piece of the earth so that he
[33:19] could come and redeem his creation back
[33:21] to him amen and so that's why we were
[33:24] laying in the earth and he we were born
[33:27] were part of this earth but it was his
[33:29] plan that way because Christ was a part
[33:32] of that earth but with the fullness of
[33:34] the Father in him but now in our day and
[33:37] time we have its a portion of it yet
[33:40] it's the fullness of him back inside
[33:43] amen and with that portion then we are
[33:46] walking around victorious amen we we can
[33:50] speak the word and God will heal us
[33:52] nothing that is not in if it's in the
[33:55] word then speak and go forward amen it
[33:58] says it's only the spirit of Laodicea
[34:00] that will keep us in fear amen break out
[34:04] of fear hallelujah and let let the word
[34:08] let the Holy Ghost that should be in us
[34:11] amen just release the word amen
[34:14] hallelujah amen
[34:17] first Corinthians 6
[34:19] 17 how are we joined to him by one
[34:24] spirits amen there's not there's not a
[34:27] hundred different denominations in the
[34:29] message there's not a hundred different
[34:31] versions of the message there's not
[34:32] there's one and the one that is real is
[34:36] powerful and it is quick and sharper
[34:39] than any two-edged sword Amen that that
[34:42] revelation Amen you will walk around as
[34:45] a god upon this earth because you have
[34:48] Jesus Christ in you you are a little
[34:50] time hallelujah but it says in 1st
[34:54] Corinthians 6:17 but he that is joined
[34:57] unto the Lord is one spirit amen
[35:00] hallelujah and that's why the bride she
[35:04] is one Amen just because you go to a
[35:06] message Church it doesn't make you bride
[35:08] but there's Brides in every message
[35:11] Church amen and that's why the Holy
[35:14] Spirit in you calls out to the others
[35:16] amen that's why when you go to a church
[35:18] you're looking around and God allows you
[35:20] to run into the believers Amen
[35:22] hallelujah
[35:23] 1st Corinthians 12:13 for by one spirit
[35:27] we are all baptized into one body one
[35:30] bride amen whether we be Jew or Gentiles
[35:34] whether we be bond or free and have been
[35:36] all made to drink into one spirit amen
[35:40] and so there's one spirit one Lord one
[35:44] baptism one word one one interpretation
[35:47] amen
[35:48] hallelujah Ephesians 2:18 and 19 for
[35:53] through him we both have access by one
[35:56] spirit unto the Father now therefore ye
[36:00] are no more strangers and foreigners God
[36:03] knows you now when he comes down and and
[36:06] brings a conversion which the conversion
[36:08] is the filling of the Holy Spirit now he
[36:11] knows you you're not a stranger you're
[36:13] not a foreigner anymore but
[36:14] fellow-citizens with the Saints
[36:17] with the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[36:19] and of the household of God you are now
[36:22] part of his kingdom amen
[36:24] Oh hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus
[36:27] because you've been borne by one spirit
[36:29] Philippians 1:27
[36:32] and then we'll slow down the scriptures
[36:35] but I want to I want to nail this down
[36:38] only let your conversation be as it
[36:41] becometh the gospel of Christ that's why
[36:44] we talk when you get together we talk
[36:46] about Jesus we talk about the word amen
[36:48] we talk about what he's done we we
[36:50] exchanged text testimonies that whether
[36:53] I come and see you or else be absent I
[36:56] may hear of your affairs that you stand
[36:59] fast in one spirit with one mind
[37:03] striving together for the faith of the
[37:06] gospel amen one mind one spirit amen
[37:10] and we're all with our arms spiritually
[37:13] locked together going forward amen and
[37:17] victorious
[37:18] praise the Lord Jesus and so what was
[37:22] going on and we'll get to the rest of
[37:24] Revelation chapter three through 19 what
[37:28] was going on with Jesus he was the
[37:31] manifested word amen and that's why
[37:33] we're the religions and the religious
[37:35] people of the day they didn't understand
[37:38] him amen in fact I don't forget if it
[37:41] was Felix or one of the other rulers a
[37:44] man they actually wanted to believe in
[37:46] Jesus a man more than the religious
[37:48] leaders did hallelujah
[37:51] a man because he wasn't all cluttered up
[37:53] with religion and it's so wonderful that
[37:58] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[38:00] and forever he was manifested then he's
[38:03] manifested today and he will be
[38:05] manifested at the end hallelujah and he
[38:07] was the word amen if we are part of the
[38:10] body than we are part of the word
[38:12] hallelujah
[38:14] and so all God's sons and daughters are
[38:17] part of the word a portion of the earth
[38:20] amen and so you have to receive his
[38:25] spirit if you're part of him you must be
[38:28] filled Amen hallelujah and so when he
[38:31] does that he redeems you he sees you he
[38:35] sees your need he sees your life and he
[38:39] says I want to get into that life I want
[38:41] to be victorious through them I want
[38:42] them to just release everything to me
[38:44] amen hallelujah
[38:46] and so we become the manifested word
[38:50] when the foolish when the wise virgin
[38:53] and the foolish virgin were together
[38:54] what was the difference amen
[38:56] one had lamps well they both had lamps
[38:59] and though others had some oil but they
[39:01] ran out but the bride the the wise had
[39:04] oil and it was on fire it was burning
[39:08] which brother Bram says means word
[39:10] manifesting in their life amen
[39:12] hallelujah hey man praise the Lord back
[39:17] to Revelation chapter 3 15 through 19 I
[39:23] know thy works that thou art neither
[39:26] cold nor hot I would that thou wert cold
[39:29] or hot amen
[39:31] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[39:34] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[39:37] out of my mouth
[39:38] hallelujah see at work in the fire
[39:42] department
[39:44] most of our personalities are we like to
[39:48] know our enemies and you respect
[39:52] somebody who doesn't like you
[39:54] Amen I men are like that I don't know
[39:57] how women are cuz I'm a man but I like a
[40:00] person who would just tell me what he
[40:02] thinks and then and then we can work
[40:06] together see at work we don't have to
[40:08] like each other but when we are we face
[40:11] a common common enemy whether it's a
[40:13] heart problem or a lung problem or a
[40:16] heart attack or a house fire or a
[40:18] structure fire then we come together
[40:20] under one common goal amen and then it
[40:23] doesn't matter what I'm working with an
[40:26] atheist who hates me doesn't matter if
[40:28] I'm working with a hypocrite it doesn't
[40:29] matter if I'm working with other
[40:30] Christians amen
[40:32] we come under one common goal amen
[40:34] hallelujah and and we know that that
[40:38] when when we know where we stand
[40:40] oh I like that amen and so that's the
[40:43] way it is with us I want to know where
[40:44] we stand and and and and I want each one
[40:48] of us no matter if you're just starting
[40:50] out or you're a veteran of the faith a
[40:52] man being honest with God just letting
[40:55] them know where you stand let people
[40:57] know where you stand a man that the
[40:59] ministry know where you stand
[41:00] and then God can help you amen
[41:03] hallelujah because they'll say us I'm
[41:07] rich and increased with Goods and have
[41:08] need of nothing and knowest not that
[41:11] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[41:13] and blind and naked what is going on
[41:15] with latest Ian Church it is the church
[41:18] that doesn't have the token amen
[41:22] that's the difference they don't have
[41:25] the token
[41:25] they have many of them have the baptism
[41:28] of the Holy Ghost on them on their flesh
[41:32] on the spirit realm and that doesn't
[41:34] have to be just signs and wonders and
[41:35] miracles that can be intellectual
[41:37] stimulation amen
[41:39] I counselled thee to buy of me gold
[41:41] tried in the fire that thou it may us be
[41:44] rich amen and white raiment that thou
[41:48] mayst be clothed and that the shame of
[41:51] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[41:54] thine eyes with eyesalve that tell me us
[41:56] to be free as many as I love I rebuke
[41:59] and chasten be zealous therefore and
[42:01] repent oh I just God wants this age to
[42:06] receive the anointed word amen I just I
[42:09] feel so sorry for people when they when
[42:11] they think they have it all a man they
[42:14] think they have this message figured out
[42:16] yet their life is screaming unbelief
[42:20] amen and and so I don't dislike those
[42:23] people but my heart cries out and says
[42:26] Oh God open their eyes give to my savvy
[42:29] men how they do but for the grace of God
[42:31] there goes us amen oh we are so
[42:34] fortunate and so for a minute here let's
[42:38] look at three different types of people
[42:40] in the eyes of the Lord amen one is not
[42:45] a churchgoer I see them you see them at
[42:48] your work your school they don't have
[42:50] any mind of God and and so actually
[42:52] they're better off if you in their state
[42:55] right there but they don't have any mind
[42:57] of God but the other one you may work
[43:00] with or go to school with the other ones
[43:02] a churchgoer and and they think they're
[43:04] saved because they've been taught that
[43:06] that if you just confess that the Lord
[43:09] Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior
[43:11] then you're saved and filled with the
[43:13] Holy Spirit
[43:14] so you have one of they think they're
[43:16] saved but they don't have the mind of
[43:18] God either
[43:19] because the mind of God is the Holy
[43:20] Spirit and so yet the two are going to
[43:25] the same destination unfortunately they
[43:27] don't realize it but the churchgoer
[43:29] looks at the one who has nothing from
[43:32] God and compares what they do and what
[43:36] they say amen to them amen so let's keep
[43:40] that in mind they're comparing their
[43:43] goodness to that person's lack of
[43:46] goodness amen right so the next the
[43:50] third person let's say is Full Gospel
[43:52] they have way more revelation than even
[43:56] that person who is religious and goes to
[43:59] church they have maybe the signs the
[44:01] wonders and miracles yet they are
[44:03] looking again at the behavior of the
[44:07] religious one and the behavior of the
[44:09] ungodly one and comparing their life and
[44:12] they're saying oh God I'm glad I'm not
[44:14] then I have you so I am going to your
[44:17] heaven amen and so we have those three
[44:22] people a man and and and I don't want to
[44:26] be any of those Haven hallelujah but see
[44:30] God is doing something different in this
[44:33] day he is looking for the people that
[44:37] are in that fourth group and that fourth
[44:40] group are people that compare who they
[44:43] are to Jesus Christ the word Amen how
[44:47] they knew who they say I don't know what
[44:49] the ungodly is doing I'm gonna pray for
[44:50] them I don't know what the church person
[44:52] is doing I don't know what the Full
[44:54] Gospel person's doing but all I want is
[44:57] to compare my life with this anointed
[44:59] word amen and and not a word from a days
[45:04] gone by but the fullness of the word
[45:06] today hallelujah we are living in that
[45:10] time of the Elijah ministry brother
[45:12] Graham says the bride is ministering
[45:15] amen it's a body ministry they're the
[45:17] great men and the message they're gone
[45:19] amen the fivefold ministry is absolutely
[45:22] part of the word but the
[45:25] looking for their salvation and their
[45:27] victory all the time through one of
[45:29] those five we are past that we are in
[45:32] the time where we are looking up to
[45:34] Jesus Christ the word Amen hallelujah
[45:39] so God is looking for that type of
[45:41] people God's looking for you and I just
[45:44] to stay with what the word says because
[45:47] here's here's the thing here's part of
[45:49] the plan is that the greater the
[45:51] revelation we profess then the greater
[45:54] recognition of unbelief hey man where
[45:58] there's more revelation there's more
[46:01] responsibility amen hallelujah
[46:04] and so God expects more from us and he
[46:07] says come up a little higher amen
[46:09] after a while he says come up a little
[46:10] higher come up a little higher aren't
[46:12] you glad he just doesn't kick you out
[46:14] amen
[46:15] when you're little a little guy is
[46:17] starting to walk and he trips you don't
[46:19] say get up what are you doing no you say
[46:22] get up and here's how to do it amen and
[46:24] that's what God is doing for us and so
[46:27] what is going on is that the Church of
[46:29] the Living God is being born together
[46:33] under the one spirit the Holy Ghost for
[46:36] today amen
[46:37] which is a powerful overcoming fullness
[46:40] amen and it always takes you back to the
[46:42] word it always takes you back to the
[46:44] word hallelujah praise the Lord Amen a
[46:49] lot of us do we've come out of the world
[46:52] have been transformed I love that we can
[46:55] look back and say that's not what I am
[46:58] anymore
[46:59] and I want to be more hallelujah and so
[47:02] if we think of that in relationship to
[47:06] what we claim we believe then we must
[47:11] work we're going to be the most clean
[47:14] and holy people on the face of this
[47:15] earth hallelujah because brother Brown
[47:19] says God's revelation is always pure and
[47:22] clean and holy amen because what God
[47:25] calls revelation is is not what we do
[47:27] around the message we call high
[47:29] revelation do we walk out of a service
[47:31] and you really don't know what they said
[47:32] now because a teacher will take things
[47:37] here and
[47:38] take them down - so the six and
[47:40] seven-year-olds can understand Amen
[47:42] praise the Lord Amen I was trained to be
[47:45] a teacher that's what you do and we have
[47:48] a teacher and in progress right there
[47:51] and you break it down so everybody can
[47:53] understand and you know what you do you
[47:56] you let them touch it you let them hear
[47:58] it and see it amen and that's the gospel
[48:01] it's just going into all the world not
[48:03] just the ministers and preach the gospel
[48:05] and these signs shall follow them to
[48:07] believe yes you will do all the things
[48:10] that that the word says amen and part of
[48:13] those signs believing is they're going
[48:15] to see that you're a transformed person
[48:17] giving out of Jesus Christ the word
[48:21] hallelujah and so it's so gradual today
[48:25] that most churchgoers don't they don't
[48:28] realize that sin has taken control of
[48:31] their life it's so subtly men all the
[48:35] fundamental I work with a handful of
[48:37] them at work the fundamental believers
[48:39] amen they look at all the guys who who
[48:42] don't know anything about God and and
[48:45] and they try to get them to receive
[48:47] Christ they said just profess that Jesus
[48:49] Christ is Lord and you're saved amen and
[48:51] those guys are the biggest stumbling
[48:53] blocks there's a one and he's from Blues
[48:58] Mecca Stan awesome man trained to be a
[49:00] minister and he's he drinks like a fish
[49:04] amen he drinks alcohol and I'm just
[49:08] going what are you doing we have another
[49:10] one so intent on studying the word yet
[49:14] he's talking about all the different
[49:15] beers he likes to drink and I'm just
[49:18] going where is God in these people and
[49:20] see all of the unchurched those are my
[49:23] friends the ones that don't know
[49:24] anything about God because I respect
[49:26] them and they respect me hallelujah but
[49:30] those other ones are a stumbling block
[49:32] and they don't realize it brother Bram
[49:34] says that that a hypocrite is the
[49:36] biggest stumbling block to the to heaven
[49:39] than anything else
[49:40] amen but see the religious person has
[49:44] been taught that they can do anything
[49:46] Amen that even when it's not consistent
[49:49] with the word look at all the tattoos
[49:51] you see all over all the Christians
[49:53] there was a street preacher the other
[49:54] day down in our town and one of our
[49:57] brothers in Christ seen him and he had
[49:59] tattoos everywhere all over his head and
[50:03] again God can use that it we can't say
[50:07] Oh God can never use those things no you
[50:10] can't do that because God will get a
[50:12] hold of you wherever you're at amen
[50:14] but see they're taught things that are
[50:16] not consistent with the word yet they
[50:18] still believe that they're in a
[50:20] condition to go to heaven and they're
[50:22] not the only way you and I know is
[50:24] individually meet this word meet the
[50:27] holes and let the word tell us where
[50:29] we're going
[50:30] amen hallelujah and so and here's the
[50:34] thing a person in that condition
[50:37] brother Bram says has nothing to judge
[50:39] if you're religious there's no altar
[50:42] there there's nothing for him to judge
[50:43] that's why when they get to heaven he
[50:46] goes to part from me I never knew you
[50:47] amen there's no altar in the heart Oh
[50:52] amen hallelujah amen but see what a what
[50:57] a son or a daughter of God received
[51:00] Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior
[51:03] and and is filled with the Holy Spirit
[51:05] then the inner person now has an altar
[51:09] and now your sins are daily judged
[51:13] because what do you do you Oh Lord I'm
[51:15] sorry please forgive me for doing that
[51:17] you go through your day doing that in
[51:19] your devotions you're reading oh god I'm
[51:21] sorry for that your daily judging each
[51:23] yourself that's why communion Amen if
[51:26] you never take communion I doubt if
[51:28] you're a believer I'm sorry
[51:32] Amen if you don't pay your tithe and
[51:34] give your offerings I doubt you're saved
[51:35] because I know unbelievers who do that
[51:38] but see because here's the thing people
[51:41] they want to believe God sent a prophet
[51:43] they want to believe all these things
[51:44] and when it comes to little things then
[51:47] they don't want it
[51:47] brother Brown says it's the little
[51:49] things we leave undone not the big
[51:51] things that we do and so we have to look
[51:54] at when we take communion we have to
[51:56] look into the mirror of God's Word and
[51:58] that's where the issue is amen
[52:00] hallelujah amen I say bring more
[52:05] persecution because I want people to go
[52:11] to heaven and more persecution brings
[52:14] out more of God Amen Alleluia amen but
[52:19] see then then he can say oh I don't
[52:23] you're saying oh god I'm so sorry for
[52:25] doing that he goes okay it's in my sea
[52:27] of forgetfulness amen Galatians 2:20
[52:30] very familiar Paul says I'm crucified
[52:34] with Christ nevertheless I live I'm
[52:36] alive yet it's not me but Christ who's
[52:41] living in me hallelujah and the life
[52:44] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[52:46] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[52:50] and gave himself for me so it's not you
[52:52] doing this you didn't even want to come
[52:55] to church amen you didn't even want to
[52:57] live for God but is Christ in you
[52:59] hallelujah and so it takes you and I out
[53:03] of the picture amen Oh hallelujah and so
[53:06] our conscience our memory reason and
[53:09] affection and imagination they're fine
[53:12] until you deny the word then it's not
[53:15] good I know people there they're gifted
[53:19] and and they may have gift of
[53:22] discernment and prophecy and all those
[53:24] things and and there's a lot that are
[53:26] right on them I mean as far as I know
[53:29] these ones where they want to compromise
[53:31] because oh you know well III believe I
[53:35] believe God doesn't God doesn't really
[53:38] care and I'm going okay fine you know uh
[53:43] I'll love you I'll preach to you or are
[53:47] all I'll eat dinner with you but you are
[53:50] an idiot hey man basically you are but
[53:57] see they can't see it because their eyes
[53:59] need ice mmm
[54:01] uh I'm sorry I'm firefighter/paramedic
[54:04] and we just were playing amen
[54:07] I promised my our church that I wouldn't
[54:10] be so plain anymore
[54:13] but see it's good until you deny the
[54:19] word oh brother it's who's who's
[54:23] revelation the word I don't care about
[54:28] brother Paul's revelation I don't care
[54:30] about brother rom Peterson's rich Cobbs
[54:33] I don't care about any of it this is the
[54:36] revelation and if I'm going to preach it
[54:40] it must run from cover to cover
[54:43] it must be congruent it must be right
[54:49] here amen
[54:50] hallelujah and so until so we need to
[54:54] leave those intellectual or emotional
[54:56] things alone until God comes on the
[54:59] altar then God will use whatever he
[55:01] wants to do amen hallelujah
[55:03] look at this when I was young I was
[55:05] involved in musical theater and when we
[55:07] would get all of the choir behind the
[55:10] the screen and we're we're singing these
[55:12] songs I tell you what that is a
[55:14] religious experience if you've been
[55:16] inquired before because it's just oh
[55:18] you're all the voices and it's just
[55:21] taking you away but see what happens at
[55:24] the end you feel cleaned out you do I've
[55:30] been in Broadway meet in I'm not that
[55:33] good Amen but I went to Broadway
[55:36] musicals and sitting there and and the
[55:40] the type of music and in the singing the
[55:43] oh just the harmony and the all those
[55:46] things you're crying or you're laughing
[55:48] Amen it's it's a religious experience
[55:51] amen and so that's why we don't we're
[55:56] not made to touch God with our emotions
[55:58] we're not made to touch God with a brain
[56:00] amen or me to know that we know that we
[56:03] know he's on the inside and whatever
[56:05] comes our way we will take it back to
[56:08] the word we will be victorious through
[56:10] him by the word amen hallelujah see your
[56:13] flesh is made to contact the earth not
[56:15] God hallelujah and so when we come to
[56:19] Christ and we have that token in our
[56:21] life now we contact Christ now he knows
[56:25] who we are
[56:26] we go to the other side you'll say well
[56:29] done my good and faithful servant you
[56:32] received the token and coming to me amen
[56:35] hallelujah that token is independent of
[56:38] your flesh your brain or your emotions
[56:41] amen
[56:42] hallelujah and so our worship is from
[56:45] within a man when I wake up in the
[56:47] morning I'm singing something amen it's
[56:50] in my heart when you you wake up you're
[56:52] singing sup because he is in your heart
[56:54] it comes from within and so that's why
[56:58] on the way to church here you know don't
[57:01] listen to talk radio don't listen to the
[57:04] news amen
[57:05] when you before it when you get up on
[57:07] Sunday morning don't read the newspaper
[57:09] hey man put on good worship music and on
[57:13] the way just talk about the Lord or
[57:15] seeing as a family or a husband and wife
[57:17] create an atmosphere so when you come in
[57:20] here it that half hour before then the
[57:22] Holy Spirit will be able to work and you
[57:25] say well everything happens usually in
[57:27] the after service duh you know why
[57:35] because now you're in the spirits a lot
[57:39] of things could be happening before the
[57:41] preaching of the word amen hallelujah
[57:44] amen that's a no-brainer but see our
[57:47] worship comes from within if you're a
[57:49] church member you have to have outside
[57:52] stimulus to bring you into worship
[57:54] whereas whereas it doesn't matter what
[57:57] it is who knows it could be spoons and
[58:01] it'll start having you clap your hands
[58:04] and reminding you what Jesus Christ has
[58:06] done amen and so God will judge us by
[58:09] our acceptance of Christ on the inner
[58:11] man not in the flesh not in the spirit
[58:16] man he is a free gift and it is so hard
[58:20] to go to hell today it is you it is
[58:27] because if you're not bribed and see
[58:30] where we're out in our churches we want
[58:33] to be that bride and there's foolish
[58:37] virgin and there's others amen and
[58:40] it's hard to go to hell amen but but
[58:44] it's a lot easier just to surrender
[58:45] because when you surrender then he takes
[58:48] over Amen hallelujah and but it takes a
[58:51] revelation of who he is on the inner man
[58:54] and so look at this this is how easy
[58:57] this is when when the Saints pray for
[59:00] you what do you do you say oh god I hope
[59:04] they get please please please lord
[59:07] please heal me please simply move no no
[59:10] you they lay hands upon you if that's
[59:13] what you choose to do and they pray and
[59:15] you agree as touching that you agree
[59:18] with God you agreed with all the others
[59:20] and and you say lord I thank you for
[59:23] healing my body and you walk out and
[59:25] every day you're saying thank you lord
[59:27] thank you lord amen
[59:29] it is no different with the Holy Ghost
[59:31] amen hallelujah amen I'm not preaching
[59:34] see here's here's the razor's edge
[59:38] people preach the Holy Ghost without
[59:40] sensation and that can happen because
[59:44] sensation and emotion are two different
[59:47] things do you realize that sensation
[59:50] emotion two different things
[59:52] amen but brother Branham says I doubt if
[59:58] you're desperate and you want more of
[1:00:00] God you're gonna say thank you Lord God
[1:00:04] thank you for the Holy Spirit no you're
[1:00:09] gonna be snot inand cried oh God or
[1:00:13] whatever your personality is I meant if
[1:00:15] you're an introvert you're just gonna be
[1:00:16] inside go amen so but it's something's
[1:00:22] gonna happen amen hallelujah but see
[1:00:26] after you received the finish after you
[1:00:29] get your hands laid on you and you walk
[1:00:31] away in faith and so when when you feel
[1:00:34] that conviction and you or condemnation
[1:00:36] if you're unsafe and you come and you
[1:00:38] receive Christ as your Lord and your
[1:00:40] saving your baptized then you say Lord
[1:00:43] I'm gonna get that Holy Ghost if it
[1:00:45] kills me amen and so every day I'm gonna
[1:00:48] wake up saying thank you Lord for
[1:00:49] filling me with the Holy Spirit and I'm
[1:00:51] gonna pray I'm gonna read your word
[1:00:53] I'm gonna be in that atmosphere and
[1:00:55] you're gonna all of a sudden one day
[1:00:57] you're gonna go wait a minute that's not
[1:00:59] a desire of me anymore that's not a
[1:01:00] desire of me that's not a desire of me
[1:01:02] hallelujah and so it's no difference
[1:01:06] ah hallelujah amen it is simple faith
[1:01:09] believing what he's already done but see
[1:01:13] we have to recognize him Amen the people
[1:01:17] in Jesus had to recognize who he was to
[1:01:19] them and in our day we have to recognize
[1:01:22] who we are and who he is to us because
[1:01:24] we are born of our own free will and
[1:01:27] when we meet Christ and receive His Word
[1:01:29] and believe Amen he will absolutely
[1:01:32] absolutely absolutely fill you with the
[1:01:35] Holy Ghost he cannot do anything else
[1:01:38] he's obligated he he's stuck with you
[1:01:43] I'm serious he is he birthed you you
[1:01:49] think he's gonna kick you out someone
[1:01:52] says well Judas remember Judas could not
[1:01:56] go to the upper room his name was not on
[1:01:59] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:02:00] his name was taken out of the book of
[1:02:02] life amen hallelujah
[1:02:04] and so people will stay and receive what
[1:02:10] the devil tells them oh I hate that
[1:02:12] good people well I guess my kids are
[1:02:16] never gonna come they're never gonna be
[1:02:19] saved then living with this sickness a
[1:02:22] long time and I guess God wants me sick
[1:02:26] I just want to say I guess you're gonna
[1:02:31] live like that the rest of your life
[1:02:32] then I guess I guess your kids are never
[1:02:34] gonna come but see they turn down what
[1:02:38] the word says not because they want to
[1:02:40] because Laodicea is such a deceptive age
[1:02:43] and and churches that profess the
[1:02:46] message we still live under the effect
[1:02:48] of that there's we don't have this big
[1:02:50] force field that goes when we start
[1:02:52] church
[1:02:54] No amen it's not like that those demonic
[1:02:58] forces are they go to church with you
[1:03:00] they they get into everything we do amen
[1:03:03] but greater is He that is in you that
[1:03:06] creates the forcefield then he that's
[1:03:08] trying to deceive you amen
[1:03:10] they do good people are tricked into
[1:03:13] thinking that they don't need the token
[1:03:16] for a sister all you do if you believe
[1:03:21] that brother Brown is a prophet and that
[1:03:23] the seals are open you got the Holy
[1:03:26] Ghost amen
[1:03:30] your there's some things left out amen
[1:03:34] hallelujah amen
[1:03:37] but see they're being told that the
[1:03:40] token is something or they're being told
[1:03:43] the token is not something where brother
[1:03:47] Branham tells us exactly what the token
[1:03:50] is hallelujah amen and when that happens
[1:03:55] then the inner man it energizes you and
[1:03:57] it cleans you out and it supercharges
[1:04:00] your life amen and you walk around and
[1:04:03] saying I'm a little Messiah Amen I'm a
[1:04:06] little God on this earth and Satan get
[1:04:08] out of my way because greater is He that
[1:04:10] is in me than he that's in this world
[1:04:12] amen hallelujah and so this doesn't mean
[1:04:17] that good people without the Holy Ghost
[1:04:19] will not receive things from God they do
[1:04:23] they do all the time and I can rejoice
[1:04:26] and praise God I'd rather see that and
[1:04:28] then have a barroom or them being down
[1:04:31] drinking or smoking dope but and they'll
[1:04:34] receive many things yet without the
[1:04:36] token amen but see on the other side
[1:04:38] people go where's the miracles in the
[1:04:41] message where is the healings in the
[1:04:42] message and I'm going are you blind are
[1:04:44] you ignorant amen we were just speaking
[1:04:48] of a couple from brother Wendell
[1:04:53] Martin's Church totally delivered from
[1:04:56] heroin literally delivered from heroin
[1:05:00] hey man I was on a call the other day
[1:05:03] and this woman we'd been on her several
[1:05:06] times he's an alcohol
[1:05:08] and and we're trying to get her help and
[1:05:11] she had a little card from the Mormons
[1:05:12] on on how to how to be delivered and the
[1:05:16] other side was Jesus and I said you know
[1:05:19] I can't say much because I'll get in
[1:05:21] trouble but I took that turned it over
[1:05:25] to the side of Jesus I said I used to be
[1:05:27] an addicted to gambling and alcohol and
[1:05:30] she goes really she goes well how did
[1:05:33] you do it and her friend goes did you go
[1:05:34] to his 12-step program I said no she
[1:05:40] good she was oh all right
[1:05:46] amen turned it down because if she would
[1:05:50] have asked I would have broke the rules
[1:05:51] and told her more she was that's like
[1:05:57] saying you know I used to have no arm
[1:06:00] and I was prayed for and God drew it
[1:06:02] back and they're going Oh
[1:06:05] God doesn't do that anymore okay I'm
[1:06:10] glad he doesn't do it could but he did
[1:06:11] it for me amen hallelujah and so if God
[1:06:16] is on the throne then he will feed you
[1:06:18] on the things of God amen he'll feed you
[1:06:24] on the things of God amen
[1:06:27] praise the Lord first John 2:15 love not
[1:06:30] the world neither the things that are in
[1:06:32] the world
[1:06:32] If any man love the world the love of
[1:06:34] the father's not in him Luke 4 for Luke
[1:06:40] 4 4 and jesus answered him saying it is
[1:06:43] written that man shall not live by bread
[1:06:46] alone but by every word of God amen and
[1:06:51] so we don't get to this pick and choose
[1:06:53] of the message we have to do it all it's
[1:06:56] better you it's better to do the whole
[1:06:58] thing and make mistakes we're full of
[1:07:01] mistakes our flesh is not raptured we're
[1:07:03] full of mistakes but if our desires have
[1:07:05] changed then our desires will carry us
[1:07:08] from glory unto glory under glory under
[1:07:11] glory amen keep on pushing drink and
[1:07:14] push drink and push amen hallelujah amen
[1:07:18] and so the inner man I don't care about
[1:07:21] flash I don't care about my spirit realm
[1:07:23] I care about the inner man and so if the
[1:07:26] inner man is transformed from this world
[1:07:28] then it doesn't sin anymore when you are
[1:07:32] transformed you are no longer a sinner
[1:07:34] you do not sin because faith is at the
[1:07:38] throne and doubt has been pushed out
[1:07:40] hallelujah you now have the ability to
[1:07:44] speak worlds into existence but let's
[1:07:46] just settle for speaking your home into
[1:07:49] existence speaking your children into
[1:07:51] existence speaking your job into
[1:07:53] existence hallelujah oh yeah when that
[1:07:57] soul is transformed then it changes
[1:08:00] everything
[1:08:01] praise the Lord I like Isaiah 59 19 when
[1:08:05] the enemy shall come in like a flood
[1:08:07] some people think that the comma is in a
[1:08:10] different place and so they like to read
[1:08:12] it when the enemy shall come in then
[1:08:15] like a flood the Spirit of the Lord
[1:08:17] shall standard against him shall a man
[1:08:23] when when this coronavirus comes in like
[1:08:25] a flood he shall lift the standard of
[1:08:29] healing up against it amen if and and
[1:08:32] even if the stock market crashes all he
[1:08:34] shall if the standard for your
[1:08:36] retirement for your job amen Oh can you
[1:08:41] bring up Jeremiah 17 7 and 8 this is one
[1:08:48] of my favorite new couple scriptures
[1:08:55] blessed is the man that trusteth in the
[1:08:58] Lord and whose hope is the Lord is for
[1:09:04] he shall be as a tree planted by waters
[1:09:07] and that spreadeth out her roots by the
[1:09:12] river and shall not see when he cometh
[1:09:17] amen
[1:09:19] well brother I believe God could do a
[1:09:22] lot of things well believe this but her
[1:09:26] leaf shall be green in famine in drought
[1:09:30] and shall not be careful in the year of
[1:09:33] drought
[1:09:35] amen do you know what your chicken still
[1:09:38] lay eggs whether it's raining or not
[1:09:40] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:43] neither shall cease from yielding fruit
[1:09:46] in the time of trouble in the time of
[1:09:48] doubt your your family will yield fruit
[1:09:52] amen
[1:09:53] you was still brother BAM says that you
[1:09:56] you yield the fruit of the manifested
[1:09:59] word amen hallelujah you if you time he
[1:10:03] says he rebukes the devoured hallelujah
[1:10:08] oh he goes to bat for you he does what
[1:10:12] he fights your battles hallelujah amen
[1:10:16] and so if something was wrong a hundred
[1:10:19] years ago
[1:10:20] for a Christian to do then it's still
[1:10:23] wrong today it was a little Amalekite
[1:10:27] then but now they're full grown still an
[1:10:31] Amalekite well that little one you could
[1:10:33] least go over and step on it's still an
[1:10:37] Amalekite it was in its infancy but
[1:10:41] Laodicea its full-blown it's it's
[1:10:43] full-grown hallelujah I I pulled up a
[1:10:47] video of these southern gospel singers
[1:10:49] and their fundamentalist they're
[1:10:51] probably Baptist conservative and I had
[1:10:54] to shut it right off because they said
[1:10:56] we're gonna sing these old hymns most of
[1:10:59] them by Fanny Crosby but we're gonna see
[1:11:01] him as if they were written in modern
[1:11:03] times it was blasphemy I shut it off
[1:11:07] amen but see hey I'm saved I can do
[1:11:09] anything I want I can make fun of the
[1:11:11] gospel I can make fun of the word and
[1:11:13] and I'm good just for the case of
[1:11:16] entertainment and so good people of this
[1:11:23] search age have grown into total
[1:11:25] blindness and they're following God with
[1:11:28] their flesh and emotions not the soul Oh
[1:11:31] see we we were Pentecostal growing up
[1:11:34] and so and and and so I knew that there
[1:11:38] was living God because I've seen many
[1:11:39] miracles and and I know that he's real
[1:11:42] so I know that when we came into the
[1:11:44] word that the word would be just as real
[1:11:49] hallelujah but see what happens in
[1:11:51] churches birds of a feather feather
[1:11:53] flock together huh why isn't there more
[1:11:58] people here tonight
[1:12:01] lazy spirits like to congregate amen I
[1:12:07] know some people they they do they have
[1:12:09] legitimate excuses and so but and it
[1:12:13] church dinners how come all the
[1:12:17] troublemakers sit together hey Matt we
[1:12:23] still love them work we have divine love
[1:12:25] but how come all the like spirits sit
[1:12:27] together how come the ones that really
[1:12:29] love God sit together huh because you
[1:12:34] have fellowship with the spirit you're
[1:12:36] up amen and so that spirit that you're
[1:12:39] born of when I when I went to my first
[1:12:42] message camps I wasn't converted what
[1:12:45] was I looking for
[1:12:46] can anybody tell me amen so I'm gonna
[1:12:52] find the people of the same spirit amen
[1:12:55] hallelujah that's just the way it is
[1:12:59] amen
[1:13:00] and so when you are in church people
[1:13:03] like to seek out those of like spirits
[1:13:05] and they and and so it's not right amen
[1:13:09] and we should be seeking the spirit of
[1:13:11] Jesus Christ so we can be armed and
[1:13:13] armed amen
[1:13:14] in unison in step with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:17] hallelujah and so just like a young man
[1:13:20] and a young woman if you have the Holy
[1:13:22] Spirit then you're gonna seek a man or a
[1:13:25] woman a mate who has the same spirit
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:29] who is predestinated to doing the will
[1:13:32] of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah because
[1:13:36] that's why none of the women were makeup
[1:13:39] because they don't need it because
[1:13:42] there's a beauty of holiness amen
[1:13:44] hallelujah amen there's a beauty on the
[1:13:48] inside of holiness see the worst spirit
[1:13:52] whether you're man or woman is fleshly
[1:13:54] beauty with a manipulating spirit you
[1:13:57] will bring many people down to hell even
[1:14:00] when
[1:14:00] Minister I was in service years ago and
[1:14:04] the man was young at the time dis black
[1:14:07] nice hair he is he was a beautiful men
[1:14:09] and the women come we're coming out of
[1:14:12] the service Gordon whoo man he's a
[1:14:16] good-looking man and I'm just going what
[1:14:19] did he preach on oh I don't know
[1:14:23] beauty is deceiving amen that's why God
[1:14:27] made me fat and bald amen hallelujah and
[1:14:31] so beauty with the manipulating spirits
[1:14:37] watch it all the father's with daughters
[1:14:40] watch watch those manipulators amen you
[1:14:45] sons don't fall for all the pretty face
[1:14:48] and everything hallelujah and so we know
[1:14:52] that the entertainment mindset of the
[1:14:55] world is is because of Flash is because
[1:14:58] of that spirit realm living and they
[1:15:01] they once the the churches wants you to
[1:15:03] tie into the entertainment amen not tie
[1:15:06] into the Holy Ghost my friend who passed
[1:15:08] away a while back last year he went to
[1:15:11] Assemblies of God Church and he told me
[1:15:13] that they only had one old man that
[1:15:15] spoke in tongues and he died and nobody
[1:15:19] speaks in tongues that's the Assemblies
[1:15:21] of God and he says it's so terrible they
[1:15:23] put they put a tarp over the baby grand
[1:15:26] and that and here's blasphemy over the
[1:15:29] Hammond amen and they brought the youth
[1:15:33] group out and they're up there and so
[1:15:37] it's so bad that the older people and he
[1:15:39] wasn't old but old 40 and up don't even
[1:15:44] come be at the SOG service because they
[1:15:46] can't take it they want to hear the word
[1:15:48] and they want they just want something
[1:15:50] that is real it's it is so terrible and
[1:15:55] so brother Branham said that a young
[1:15:57] person without the Holy Ghost will
[1:15:59] absolutely go to rock and roll
[1:16:00] every single time amen and so but when
[1:16:04] Christ is on the altar of that inner man
[1:16:07] then your life is controlled by him not
[1:16:10] you Amen we have a we have a
[1:16:14] 86 years old he's been an alcoholic all
[1:16:17] of his life he could prophesy and be a
[1:16:20] hundred percent correct but beat his
[1:16:24] wife and drink all the time dad had to
[1:16:28] bail him out of jail
[1:16:29] but he called me up the other day I
[1:16:31] didn't know he's still alive
[1:16:33] 86 he goes is this Richard calm I said
[1:16:35] yeah he goes do you still preach the
[1:16:36] message yes he goes well what's your
[1:16:38] church service times well he was at home
[1:16:41] and he he he told me he goes I given up
[1:16:45] because I couldn't overcome that spirit
[1:16:47] and he goes I was just gonna live out my
[1:16:48] days and go to hell but he said he was
[1:16:52] sitting there and God spoke to him and
[1:16:54] say how long are you gonna do that how
[1:16:57] long are you going to try to do it and
[1:17:00] he goes why don't you let me do it he
[1:17:03] was delivered right there when he walked
[1:17:05] into the church he was not the same
[1:17:08] friend he was not the same spirit Amen
[1:17:10] because Jesus Christ was now on the
[1:17:12] throne and so now he gets up and he
[1:17:15] prays and reads his word now he loves
[1:17:18] the fellowship of the Saints God has
[1:17:20] delivered him at 86 years old hallelujah
[1:17:24] his life God is now teaching him how to
[1:17:26] be controlled by the move of his Spirit
[1:17:29] through that word amen and so the things
[1:17:32] that are important to you and now you
[1:17:34] and I now are the things of God
[1:17:36] oh praise the Lord Jesus amen the spirit
[1:17:41] though the spirit of the world goes
[1:17:43] after those things that please your
[1:17:44] flesh amen we've we've had so many over
[1:17:47] the years leave the church and that's
[1:17:49] fine that there are free moral agents
[1:17:51] you know all's you have as a piano and
[1:17:56] an organ don't got any programs for the
[1:18:02] kids and I go hmmm but for the Jose he
[1:18:08] was sitting there in the middle of the
[1:18:09] service and complete completely deaf in
[1:18:11] one ear God touched him and healed him
[1:18:13] yeah I know we sure don't have anything
[1:18:15] happening you know and and sister
[1:18:19] so-and-so she was praying and she had
[1:18:23] asthma and she felt a wind come down
[1:18:25] through her nose and completely Hillier
[1:18:28] I guess that's I realize that's not very
[1:18:31] much
[1:18:33] we have people their lives are changing
[1:18:37] but that's not good enough I'm sorry I I
[1:18:41] know we're we're not that great of a
[1:18:44] church but see the believer goes after
[1:18:50] the things that the spirit and the word
[1:18:53] like amen
[1:18:55] and so we're at a time where it's just
[1:18:57] plain talk we're at a time where we know
[1:18:59] we need to know who we are
[1:19:00] hallelujah in fact I want again it
[1:19:03] happened tonight again I wanted to
[1:19:05] preach this other message but this
[1:19:07] message just kept it wasn't me I tried
[1:19:09] to purposely not think of it as and so
[1:19:12] obviously maybe someone on the internet
[1:19:14] needs it Hank Amen but see the believer
[1:19:16] is not lifted up into the presence of
[1:19:19] God through their emotions amen oh when
[1:19:22] we were young my dad would preach in
[1:19:24] black churches as long as the music was
[1:19:26] going as long as the miracles were
[1:19:28] happening all they were right there but
[1:19:30] as soon as all those stopped it's like
[1:19:33] amen
[1:19:34] how they did yeah amen you don't have
[1:19:38] any this or that no no well you must not
[1:19:42] be a very good church know it that's
[1:19:45] right just move on down the road and
[1:19:46] don't bother coming amen but see we're
[1:19:49] not lifted up into the presence by your
[1:19:51] emotions
[1:19:51] you don't come in here and get worked up
[1:19:54] into worship you come in and now you
[1:19:57] your spirit that has been rejuvenated it
[1:20:01] comes and meets the song leader spirit
[1:20:03] and then you're rejoicing in the Lord
[1:20:05] amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:09] but it's the Holy Ghost itself that is
[1:20:11] napping to you praise the Lord Jesus
[1:20:13] amen
[1:20:14] see before the Holy Ghost was given in
[1:20:17] the Old Testament what did they have to
[1:20:18] do they Elisha said bring me a minstrel
[1:20:21] he needed worship music to get into the
[1:20:25] spirit to see visions amen Saul they had
[1:20:29] to drive out the a cranky spirit by
[1:20:34] songs amen hallelujah
[1:20:39] amen yeah amen
[1:20:49] there's a thing called Christian hate
[1:20:52] metal do you know what hate medallist
[1:20:53] it's heavy metal plus and it's like
[1:20:57] instead of the drumming being normal
[1:21:00] it's ya boy it looks op - bad day I mean
[1:21:08] that's real that's a real group of the
[1:21:10] real song that doesn't that doesn't
[1:21:14] bring the the holy spirit does it hey
[1:21:17] hey men see God knew that they needed to
[1:21:20] mellow the atmosphere and so that's why
[1:21:23] when we come to church and we sing the
[1:21:26] the songs of Zion
[1:21:28] it is mellowing our spirit amen and
[1:21:31] getting our minds shifted from the day
[1:21:33] into Jesus Christ so Elijah could see
[1:21:36] visions his spirit had to be quite 'end
[1:21:39] amen but today and we know that that
[1:21:42] presence of God came in so that he could
[1:21:44] tell Jehoshaphat and they have what the
[1:21:47] truth was because we are worth trying
[1:21:49] being we have a flash we have a spirit
[1:21:51] we have a soul amen and so the that that
[1:21:55] one that is on the outside it has see
[1:21:58] taste feel smell hear the one that's
[1:22:00] next in the spirit has the conscious
[1:22:02] memory reason infection imagination amen
[1:22:05] and so that's why we must go past that
[1:22:08] that's why we must get the Holy Ghost on
[1:22:10] that inner man amen you are born a
[1:22:13] sinner you are born with unbelief and
[1:22:15] you must be converted amen hallelujah
[1:22:18] Bible says casting down all imagination
[1:22:21] and every high thing that exalts itself
[1:22:23] against God hallelujah your thoughts
[1:22:26] what do you think your feelings amen
[1:22:29] hallelujah amen praise the Lord Jesus
[1:22:35] Amen again you can be baptized with the
[1:22:37] Holy Ghost every day and still go to
[1:22:39] hell Wow
[1:22:41] amen look at Simon the sorcerer it said
[1:22:45] that he was baptized the right way and
[1:22:47] he believed yet he was still in the gall
[1:22:51] of bitterness
[1:22:53] because he said I want to I'm gonna give
[1:22:56] you money so that I can lay hands on
[1:22:58] people and then receive the Holy Ghost
[1:23:00] hallelujah so he believed and was
[1:23:03] baptized he'd be he would be considered
[1:23:06] saved in a lot of message churches huh
[1:23:10] no you have to be filled with the Holy
[1:23:13] Spirit amen
[1:23:15] how they do because remember it's one
[1:23:17] spirit one Lord one baptism hallelujah
[1:23:20] because what happens is is is that the
[1:23:23] people begin to take that religious
[1:23:25] spirit and that's that that's the most
[1:23:27] demonic spirit of them all hallelujah
[1:23:31] amen because then it says well this
[1:23:33] doesn't matter and this doesn't matter
[1:23:35] but the Holy Spirit when it comes in
[1:23:37] says Oh Lord this does matter Lord take
[1:23:39] this out lord thank you that we're doing
[1:23:41] this right thank you for healing us
[1:23:42] thank you for giving us these things in
[1:23:45] our home thank you for changing the
[1:23:46] atmosphere thank you for doing all these
[1:23:48] wonderful things in our life hallelujah
[1:23:52] but see people will only grow as much as
[1:23:57] what their church believes amen so you
[1:24:02] want a pastor who's gonna preach the
[1:24:05] word amen we have to have the word and
[1:24:10] so if the word is being preached then
[1:24:12] your belief is gonna be in the word
[1:24:15] hallelujah amen because the word of the
[1:24:19] Lord is the absolute it is the ultimate
[1:24:22] hallelujah but it's still so hard for
[1:24:24] people to accept it oh oh that's the
[1:24:28] spirit of Laodicea Amen it makes it so
[1:24:31] hard for them just to settle in to what
[1:24:34] it says Amen hallelujah
[1:24:37] so a person for a person to walk in the
[1:24:41] life of Jesus Christ in his word you
[1:24:44] have to be ordained into it because you
[1:24:47] were with him before the foundation of
[1:24:49] the world you were a part of him before
[1:24:51] the world began hallelujah and so now
[1:24:54] you live above the spirit realm you live
[1:24:57] above your brain you live above your
[1:24:59] flesh and you begin to have Christ
[1:25:02] revealed to you Oh hallelujah
[1:25:06] aim brother Brown says how we ever gonna
[1:25:09] see visions and live in his presence if
[1:25:13] we're still questioning the word doesn't
[1:25:18] happen
[1:25:19] people think that we can have little
[1:25:21] little attitudes towards one another in
[1:25:24] the church your church can get bigger it
[1:25:26] can be more prosperous the word can be
[1:25:29] spoken a hundred cent but brother BAM
[1:25:31] says you're fooling yourself you died
[1:25:34] right there you died when your scuffling
[1:25:38] with one another you died when you have
[1:25:41] a little a little feeling towards
[1:25:44] another sister or brother amen your
[1:25:46] church will never go forward in what God
[1:25:49] calls important until those things are
[1:25:51] cleared up I I've been to a huge church
[1:25:54] amen which will remain unnamed and and
[1:25:58] one time the person goes yeah
[1:26:00] there's a lot of us here but we really
[1:26:02] don't like each other very much it would
[1:26:05] surprise you that was I don't think I
[1:26:12] want to go there amen
[1:26:14] I want to go where people really love
[1:26:17] one another and we have differences
[1:26:20] brother sister I don't agree with that
[1:26:23] one bit but if you have a need if your
[1:26:26] kids need something I'm gonna help you
[1:26:28] financially we're gonna gather up the
[1:26:30] family we're gonna help you amen
[1:26:32] hallelujah that's what we're looking for
[1:26:34] and so how are we gonna ever do see God
[1:26:37] moving in our presence if we're
[1:26:39] questioning what the word says oh praise
[1:26:43] the Lord I tell you it's not in these
[1:26:45] notes but brother Branham said and what
[1:26:47] I was studying the other night he goes
[1:26:48] we need to pray the unbelievers out of
[1:26:50] the congregation I'm going oh man you
[1:26:55] don't you wouldn't preach that anywhere
[1:26:58] because we are we're about to find love
[1:27:01] amen and to those that are pure all
[1:27:03] things are pure and we want everybody
[1:27:05] but it comes a time where God says Moses
[1:27:09] separate yourself Abba Ram amen Dathan
[1:27:13] Acorah and all his cohorts in the two
[1:27:15] hundred fifty princes get out of the way
[1:27:18] hallelujah
[1:27:20] amen praise the Lord and so we're almost
[1:27:23] done is that the soul must have the
[1:27:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost so God can
[1:27:31] change you amen I was a good actor I was
[1:27:34] a Pharisee amen
[1:27:38] we we have him you I went to church
[1:27:41] people thought oh he's a good boy and
[1:27:43] he's a good kid and and and where I
[1:27:47] lived for a few years they let me lead a
[1:27:49] young people's Bible study perfect place
[1:27:53] for a pervert I believed in miracles I
[1:27:59] believe brother Branham was a prophet
[1:28:01] I believe all those things and you let a
[1:28:06] fox into your henhouse because of lack
[1:28:10] of discernment amen hallelujah that's
[1:28:15] why that's why our children spouses are
[1:28:19] gonna be a revelation amen oh he's in
[1:28:23] the message oh go ahead
[1:28:24] sure sure go ahead No oh you're in the
[1:28:27] message what what do you believe are you
[1:28:29] converted what are your parents like
[1:28:31] are they christians are they're
[1:28:32] believers amen what church do you go to
[1:28:35] amen but see the soul must have the
[1:28:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:40] and then God will change you praise God
[1:28:43] you man hallelujah what does it say over
[1:28:47] here in the Bible it says Jesus says my
[1:28:49] sheep hear my voice and a voice of a
[1:28:52] stranger they will not follow and the
[1:28:55] voice that you hear will express itself
[1:28:58] through you amen hallelujah when you
[1:29:01] hear the voice of the word and it says
[1:29:03] to do something
[1:29:03] it'll be expressed amen everything that
[1:29:07] you see in the word you take it you eat
[1:29:08] it it's Express through you amen how are
[1:29:11] you because that's the message is the
[1:29:13] expression and the manifestation of
[1:29:15] Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but see
[1:29:18] again good people living in that second
[1:29:20] round and they turned down what is
[1:29:22] important but see the the person living
[1:29:26] in a converted life will make a lot of
[1:29:29] mistakes but they can actually save a
[1:29:32] man praise the Lord I know that I'm not
[1:29:35] like that
[1:29:36] oh I've been I've been changed I know
[1:29:39] that that God is on the throne and the
[1:29:42] absolute lives within me hallelujah
[1:29:44] praise the Lord and you're overcoming
[1:29:47] the world praise the Lord I was with
[1:29:53] somebody a while back and we're talking
[1:29:56] good good person but I'm watching
[1:29:59] because the barista she had kind of a
[1:30:03] short and I'm purposely watching him he
[1:30:10] had to take a look
[1:30:11] and I thought brother there's more than
[1:30:16] that amen
[1:30:19] you say well brother richer old no when
[1:30:23] I was saved God took that from me
[1:30:25] amen I don't care what anybody thinks
[1:30:28] God took that from him amen that's why I
[1:30:31] can live victorious today because the
[1:30:33] desire had changed and so it manifests
[1:30:35] it it starts here and manifests
[1:30:38] hallelujah Amen hallelujah that's why in
[1:30:42] your business dealings you give the
[1:30:45] other person a good deal you don't try
[1:30:48] to take them amen
[1:30:50] how they do you that's why something
[1:30:53] transforms you everything becomes
[1:30:56] different because you're no longer your
[1:30:58] own you can now brother Branham says
[1:31:00] that we begin to cope with the word we
[1:31:03] begin to now that the word is gret is
[1:31:06] grabbing on to us where we're grappling
[1:31:09] not not in a fight but it's saying you
[1:31:12] got to go this way and you're going okay
[1:31:14] I'll go this way
[1:31:15] amen it's showing you it's straining you
[1:31:18] how to how to live in the spirit and the
[1:31:20] victory of the word and so every little
[1:31:23] portion of the word you begin to cope
[1:31:25] with it and cope with it and cope with
[1:31:26] it amen hallelujah and so whatever you
[1:31:29] receive from God you realize it's a
[1:31:31] revelation it's not you you didn't
[1:31:34] figure it out
[1:31:34] God figured it out through you and that
[1:31:37] revelation comes to the soul and it just
[1:31:40] takes authority over all parts of your
[1:31:42] flesh all parts of your marriage
[1:31:46] our marriage is better today than it was
[1:31:48] the first year and it's gonna be 23
[1:31:51] years amen
[1:31:53] why is that Holy Ghost
[1:31:58] through a there's been trials for us
[1:32:02] both in and out of the relationship but
[1:32:07] never never one time wanted to give up
[1:32:09] on it because of the Holy Spirit praise
[1:32:13] God amen and so if we didn't get a
[1:32:17] chance to experience that but you can
[1:32:18] drive the stake down and then teach your
[1:32:21] grandchildren amen or others a great
[1:32:23] grandchildren or whatever it may be what
[1:32:26] the Spirit of the Lord says and so
[1:32:28] here's the great thing is that when once
[1:32:31] the Holy Spirit is there and it's
[1:32:33] beginning to train us and teach us and
[1:32:36] cause us to fall in love with him I tell
[1:32:39] you what you begin to harmonize with him
[1:32:42] there's a harmony not in the desert but
[1:32:45] there's a harmony in you and the Lord

[1:33:09] whatever you think I don't whatever he
[1:33:14] is the husband we are the wife it
[1:33:16] becomes a unison an invisible union a
[1:33:20] harmony becomes you you become one with
[1:33:23] it Amen oh praise the Lord Jesus amen

[1:33:59] fit a man we've been in India and people
[1:34:02] see the pillar of fire in meetings there

[1:34:06] it's because of you it's because of your
[1:34:09] desires it's because you're crying up to
[1:34:12] God and he is here tonight in the
[1:34:15] presence and the fullness of his word to

[1:34:55] breach amen in that beautiful I tell you
[1:35:00] my brother and sister I think sometimes

[1:35:05] be preached and remember that we are all
[1:35:08] that the Prophet said we would be amen
[1:35:14] we are not just a little portion we're
[1:35:16] not just the leftovers or something we
[1:35:19] are all amen I was just before the
[1:35:22] service just studying some thoughts on
[1:35:25] my iPad there and the prophet of God
[1:35:28] speaks these words he says that he had
[1:35:31] to be speaking of Jesus Christ had to be
[1:35:33] all that the father said he would be and
[1:35:37] when I read that I thought that is us we
[1:35:40] have to be all that the father said we
