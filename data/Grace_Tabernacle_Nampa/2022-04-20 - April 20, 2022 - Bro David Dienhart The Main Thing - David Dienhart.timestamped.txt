[37:30] is in this hour
[37:32] to be walking and fellowshipping and
[37:34] communing with the king

[37:38] and greater and greater it's going to
[37:40] and it's going to climax in the meeting
[37:42] of him personally

[37:49] could be any moment we could have a
[37:50] resurrection right here this evening

[38:18] what god wants us to be unified where
[38:21] his presence
[38:23] what's the binding tie is very life
[38:27] that's the token that god
[38:29] must see
[38:30] that's the token he recognized the only
[38:32] thing he'll recognize

[39:51] name
[39:51] we come in your name
[39:53] and we are here to to glorify and
[39:56] manifest you in this hour in our decreed
[39:58] season that you brought us to be here
[40:01] we have one purpose lord one goal in
[40:03] this life and one focus and we should
[40:05] have our eyes single to that one focus
[40:08] and that's to bring glory and honor
[40:10] to he
[40:12] our husband our lord
[40:14] our king
[40:17] our life
[40:19] and lord jesus we are thankful that we
[40:21] could be here we knew it took faith for
[40:23] us to come here now we are here now
[40:26] father may you deal with each of us
[40:28] individually and personally we pray
[40:30] in thy name we pray and ask the blessing
[40:32] upon thy word in jesus christ's name
[40:35] amen
[40:37] amen luke 18
[40:39] and a certain ruler asked him saying
[40:41] good master what shall i do to inherit
[40:44] eternal life
[40:45] now he knew there was a person he was
[40:47] standing for
[40:48] before
[40:50] he knew there was something he did not
[40:52] have
[40:53] and that was the eternal life
[40:55] they knew there was an eternal
[40:58] they knew there was a god that's eternal
[41:01] and he said what must i do to inherit he
[41:03] was looking for something he could do in
[41:06] the works of his own self to do to
[41:08] inherit eternal life
[41:10] and jesus said why call us thou me good
[41:13] none is good save one
[41:16] that is god
[41:17] thou knowest the commandments do not
[41:19] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[41:22] do not bear false witness honor thy
[41:24] father and mother
[41:26] and he said all these have i kept from
[41:28] my youth up
[41:30] see
[41:32] he knew there's still something missing
[41:33] all that
[41:34] all that could do was
[41:36] put him in prison couldn't get him out
[41:38] but he knew there was a life lived in
[41:40] this man that could get him out
[41:42] now when jesus heard these things he
[41:45] said unto him yet lacquest thou one
[41:48] thing
[41:49] sell all that thou hast
[41:52] and distribute unto the poor and thou
[41:54] shall have treasure in heaven and come i
[41:57] want to put emphasis on this and come
[42:00] follow me
[42:03] and then i'd like you to turn with me to
[42:04] hebrews chapter 2
[42:09] starting with verse 1.
[42:21] therefore we ought to give the more i
[42:23] want you to listen to this carefully
[42:26] every individual
[42:27] and i've had i've had a real burden with
[42:30] the young people for the young people
[42:32] tonight now it's ev to everybody
[42:34] but the lord laid this on my heart
[42:36] yesterday in prayer
[42:37] and and just seemed to focus
[42:41] it's
[42:42] speaking to you young people tonight
[42:45] i'm not differentiating age i'm saying
[42:47] young people
[42:49] and
[42:50] and it's to everyone not just young
[42:52] people
[42:53] but there's a focus and i want i believe
[42:55] the lord wanted me to say that he's
[42:57] going to focus on you tonight
[43:00] amen
[43:02] so
[43:03] listen to these words carefully this is
[43:05] the word of the lord
[43:07] the prophet said this is god in written
[43:09] form
[43:11] amen this is what your bible is it's god
[43:13] in written form
[43:17] therefore we we are are you a we yes
[43:20] amen
[43:21] therefore we ought to give the more
[43:23] earnest heed
[43:25] earnest the more earnest heed
[43:28] to the things which we have heard
[43:31] lest at any time we should let them slip
[43:35] for if the word spoken by angels was
[43:37] steadfast that's messengers
[43:40] for the word spoken by angels was
[43:42] steadfast in every transgression and
[43:45] disobedience received a just
[43:48] not unjust one but a just recompense of
[43:51] reward
[43:52] how shall we escape
[43:56] let me read that again how shall we
[43:58] escape if we neglect
[44:01] so great salvation
[44:04] which at the first
[44:05] began to be spoken by the lord and was
[44:08] confirmed unto us by them
[44:12] that vindicated the message
[44:15] by them
[44:16] that vindicated the word
[44:18] by them that heard
[44:20] him that received him
[44:23] they were living manifestations they
[44:25] were the voice of god to you
[44:28] there you are all right then i'd like
[44:31] you to go with me to matthew 16.
[44:42] matthew 16
[44:45] the 24th to the 26th verse
[44:52] then said jesus unto his disciples
[44:56] if any man will come after me
[44:59] let him die to himself
[45:05] amen let him deny himself
[45:08] take up his cross cross means death
[45:10] there's something died
[45:12] take up his cross
[45:14] and follow
[45:16] me who is he
[45:20] the word the living word the word
[45:22] himself
[45:25] in the beginning was the word the word
[45:26] was with god the word was god
[45:29] and the word has become flesh and dwelt
[45:31] among us and now that same word is in
[45:34] flesh again today
[45:36] dwelling among us
[45:42] verse 25
[45:44] for what's for whosoever will save
[45:47] his life
[45:49] shall lose it
[45:53] and whosoever will lose
[45:56] his life
[45:57] for my sake
[45:59] shall
[46:00] find it
[46:01] wonder what kind of life you'd find if
[46:03] you lost your life for his sake
[46:06] the same thing the rich young ruler was
[46:07] desiring
[46:10] eternal life
[46:12] amen
[46:15] amen all right now
[46:19] for what
[46:21] is a man profited
[46:23] if he shall gain the whole world
[46:26] and lose his own soul that's right
[46:29] that soul is who you are
[46:32] that's your beginning
[46:34] what that soul is is who you are tonight
[46:38] amen that's right
[46:43] for what a man what is a man profited if
[46:46] he shall gain the whole world and lose
[46:48] his soul or what shall a man give in
[46:50] exchange
[46:52] for his soul
[46:55] you see there's a there's a greater
[46:56] reality of someone in the inside of you
[46:59] it's either eternal or it's not right
[47:01] but it can be
[47:03] if you have the tug for god
[47:05] because you couldn't have that hunger
[47:07] and thirst for god
[47:08] except there was a deep to respond to it
[47:12] and there is
[47:14] his own life
[47:15] amen you may be seated
[47:20] i want you to turn with me to the song
[47:21] of solomon very short verse but i want
[47:24] to read it
[47:26] and that's chapter 2
[47:30] and verse 1.
[47:31] there's a couple things here a couple
[47:33] stories that i'm going to read and then
[47:35] comment on those things and i want to go
[47:37] into something to climax this tonight so
[47:40] you pray for me
[47:42] if you haven't already pray for me
[47:45] if you have already thank you keep
[47:47] praying
[47:49] so
[47:50] so we just that's what we need isn't it
[47:53] how many believe prayer changes things
[47:55] there's power in prayer
[47:58] amen when you pray you're speaking to
[47:59] god
[48:01] you want to remember that it's not just
[48:03] a happen chance thing
[48:06] you're coming before him
[48:09] amen amen it's a serious thing
[48:12] this is some little thing that we do you
[48:14] know just
[48:15] but it's communing it's talking to
[48:21] if you want to be in his presence pray
[48:27] pray
[48:29] i can't express that enough pray
[48:32] jesus said watch and pray
[48:36] amen
[48:37] all right
[48:38] song of solomon chapter 2 verse 1
[48:41] i am you know who the i am is
[48:44] i am the rose of sharon and the lily
[48:48] of the valleys
[48:50] i want to title this called the main
[48:52] thing
[48:54] the main thing
[48:58] i want to read a little story to you
[49:01] or before i do that i want you to turn
[49:02] with me to john i'll just
[49:05] bring this out before we do this and
[49:06] this is something that brother branham
[49:08] i'm reading this this is stories that
[49:10] brother branham gave so we're not it's
[49:12] not a story i have it's something i'm
[49:14] relating to that he said
[49:17] saint john 15
[49:19] and verse 5
[49:21] there's the i am again
[49:24] i am
[49:25] the vine
[49:26] you are
[49:27] the branches
[49:30] he that abideth abideth
[49:33] that's not in and out
[49:35] that lives there
[49:36] he dwells there
[49:39] all right i am the vine you are the
[49:42] branches he that abideth in me
[49:46] amen
[49:48] think of that
[49:49] abiding in him
[49:52] now how's the devil going to find you
[49:55] he can't get in there
[49:57] is that right
[49:58] so there's a place to abide there's an
[50:00] abiding place there's a perfect place
[50:02] there's a place of rest there's a place
[50:04] of satisfaction there's a place of life
[50:07] there's a place of resurrection
[50:09] there's a place
[50:10] eternal
[50:12] amen
[50:13] all right i am the vine you are the
[50:16] branches he that abideth in me and i in
[50:19] him sounds like oneness to me doesn't it
[50:22] it's what it is
[50:24] the same bringeth forth much fruit
[50:28] now he just got done saying i'm the vine
[50:30] he just well you just said it yes you
[50:32] are the branches
[50:34] but the same if you abide in me and i
[50:36] and he or he he and i and
[50:38] if he he that abideth in me and i in him
[50:41] the same bringeth forth much fruit
[50:43] for without me
[50:45] i want to make this real clear without
[50:47] me
[50:48] you can do nothing
[50:52] for without me
[50:54] you can do
[50:55] young people nothing
[51:00] amen that's that's all if you expect to
[51:02] go home if you expect to go in a rapture
[51:05] without him you can't make it
[51:08] you can have all the world you want you
[51:10] can have the best of finance you have
[51:12] the best of jobs but without him it's in
[51:14] vain
[51:16] it's totally fruitless
[51:18] you've been brought on this earth for
[51:19] one purpose you've said in front into a
[51:21] message heard the message hear it preach
[51:23] for one purpose that's that you might
[51:26] enjoy that same life eternally
[51:30] that you can give your life to him
[51:32] unreservedly that's what he wants
[51:36] amen you have only two powers there's
[51:39] only two powers that work today that's
[51:41] the power of satan and the power of god
[51:43] who is the word
[51:44] and satan is against it
[51:48] two powers you're serving one of those
[51:51] two
[51:52] tonight
[51:54] that's the truth tonight
[51:56] you say that's pretty direct i want to
[51:58] be very direct
[52:00] you're gonna serve one or two you're
[52:02] serving one or two of those tonight
[52:04] and that determines what's in your soul
[52:08] amen god's looking for his life to be on
[52:11] display
[52:13] and there's only one way that life can
[52:14] be on display is that he quickened the
[52:16] word in you
[52:18] himself amen
[52:20] amen our brother paul said sunday god
[52:22] planted that word in you before the
[52:24] foundational world it was planted it was
[52:26] planted for you to be here in this
[52:28] season to hear the message of this
[52:30] season the light of the season so that
[52:32] seed would
[52:34] manifest
[52:36] come to life
[52:38] amen
[52:39] amen that's him dwelling in you
[52:43] but it takes a submission it takes a
[52:44] surrender so brother david i've i've
[52:47] repented i pray that you have
[52:50] repentance isn't a little thing
[52:51] repentance is you're going one way you
[52:53] turn around go the other way repentance
[52:55] is a realize that what christ did for
[52:57] you calvary you couldn't do for yourself
[53:00] he gave you life purchased your life
[53:03] bought it and you've accepted it by
[53:05] faith believing that
[53:08] and you've asked him to come into your
[53:09] heart you've asked him to give you life
[53:12] you've asked to say lord i realize that
[53:13] you shed your blood for me i want that
[53:16] life you promise to give it to me i'm
[53:18] repenting of my past sins
[53:21] lord i want you to come in and live in
[53:22] me forgive me lord repentance
[53:26] genuine repentance you know sorry to say
[53:28] but there isn't too much genuine
[53:30] repentance anymore
[53:32] but then if you do that
[53:35] genuinely from your heart
[53:37] and
[53:38] accept it and show it outwardly that you
[53:40] believe that jesus christ died for you
[53:42] and when he died you died with him
[53:44] he took your sin right there in his body
[53:47] he judged he was judged for you and i he
[53:50] pardoned you and i and you've accepted
[53:52] that pardon
[53:54] then you rise up and take his name in
[53:56] baptism as outward expression of that
[53:58] inward faith that you believe in what he
[54:00] did and when you do that and you show
[54:03] yourself buried with him and raised with
[54:05] him
[54:05] the bible says and you shall receive the
[54:07] gift of the holy ghost
[54:11] is that right
[54:12] all right
[54:14] then
[54:15] don't stop at baptism
[54:17] go on the promises to you
[54:21] the promise is to you the devil doesn't
[54:23] want you to believe that
[54:25] and don't look for some emotional outset
[54:28] look for a revelation in your heart of
[54:30] truth
[54:31] that he
[54:32] that he and i'm not saying there won't
[54:33] be emotion
[54:35] i'm sure there probably will be because
[54:37] no man can be changed you can't be
[54:39] changed and not know it and something
[54:40] happened to you
[54:42] but it's going to be a reality look for
[54:44] reality
[54:46] he promised it he said he would give it
[54:48] to you
[54:49] let him fill you let him bring that
[54:51] peace let him bring that satisfaction
[54:53] that you can't bring
[54:55] of knowing him
[55:00] now you're born again
[55:03] now you've got a conversion
[55:05] now he has control and all he asks is
[55:08] follow me
[55:10] give yourself unreservedly bring
[55:12] yourself and die to yourself daily
[55:14] depend on me and take my word and follow
[55:17] me
[55:18] and i will take care of the rest of it
[55:23] it's not works is it brother david no
[55:25] work said
[55:26] he's not looking at outward works
[55:28] anymore it's no more the ways of the
[55:30] flesh
[55:32] is that right it's the way of the word
[55:35] it's the way of life it's so he comes in
[55:37] and quickens himself and comes and
[55:38] dwells in you and lives in you and you
[55:41] can't get enough of this message then
[55:43] you can't get enough of this word
[55:45] when that comes in when it came in me
[55:47] when i was just a young man
[55:49] 14.
[55:51] i couldn't get enough of this word from
[55:53] there on i still can't
[55:57] that hunger that desire that i have i i
[56:00] just got to feed on this message i got
[56:01] to feed on this word
[56:04] i've got to get alone with him i've got
[56:05] to pray
[56:08] what causes that
[56:10] it's a drawing from the inside
[56:13] drawing
[56:14] me what does he ask you to do heed that
[56:17] drawing
[56:18] if you feel that tug give way to that
[56:20] tug that's the thing he quickens
[56:22] he sent the holy spirit to quicken that
[56:25] to you and it will bring it up in and
[56:27] you'll grow as you draw through the word
[56:29] as you as you hear the word as you're
[56:32] hearing the truth it'll grow because
[56:34] he'll reveal himself
[56:36] from glory to glory from faith to faith
[56:39] right into a body change
[56:43] you can't have him dwelling in you and
[56:45] not know that and no by him in you it's
[56:47] identified that you'll be in the rapture
[56:52] i'm talking about him and you i'm not
[56:54] talking about just an anointing and feel
[56:56] good feeling i'm talking about the word
[56:58] living in you
[57:01] amen
[57:03] amen all right so
[57:06] i want to read a little story here
[57:09] and i want to comment here notice he is
[57:11] that rose of sharon that sweet smelling
[57:13] savor
[57:14] the anointing upon his people
[57:18] you cannot come before him with any
[57:20] creed or anything
[57:22] but anointed with that rose of sharon
[57:24] the word
[57:27] the word what himself in you
[57:31] he also
[57:33] he also not only the rose of sharon he's
[57:35] also the lily of the valley
[57:37] he's bridegroom and bride
[57:42] there's a rose of sharon he's the rose
[57:44] he's the lily
[57:45] what would the bride be
[57:48] she would have to be another rose and
[57:49] another lily by what power by what
[57:52] spirit by what life his own the
[57:54] anointing on his people on the word
[57:58] who are you you become the word when
[57:59] you're born again that new birth is the
[58:02] revelation is jesus christ revealed in
[58:04] you
[58:07] and it grows
[58:10] and it takes over the ground
[58:13] amen that seed has power in it when that
[58:15] seed's quickened it takes over the
[58:17] ground it brings your body subject to
[58:19] that spirit
[58:23] hallelujah isn't that romans 8 11 when
[58:25] the spirit when he
[58:27] when he the spirit of the spirit of
[58:30] christ when he
[58:31] comes in you will he not
[58:34] quicken your mortal body
[58:37] by that spirit that dwells in you
[58:39] amen
[58:43] all right
[58:44] so he was squeezed his life was squeezed
[58:47] out on calvary
[58:48] why was the squeezed out
[58:51] for you and i
[58:55] he's imparted his own life he's sharing
[58:57] his own life with you and i what's that
[58:59] resurrection got to do with us
[59:01] he imparted life to us
[59:04] hallelujah he had to bring forth his
[59:06] body he had to bring forth his bride and
[59:08] it came out of him
[59:12] hallelujah
[59:15] all right so he said he was squeezed out
[59:18] on calvary he was wounded for our
[59:20] transgressions
[59:21] do you believe that tonight
[59:25] he was wounded for our transgressions
[59:27] with his stripes we were he'll see he's
[59:29] already taken your transgression
[59:32] he's already taken your sicknesses
[59:35] he's already saved you

[59:41] he's already healed you what do you have
[59:44] to do brother david what do i have to do
[59:46] accept it
[59:48] amen
[59:49] hallelujah
[59:51] hallelujah so he said he was wounded
[59:54] stripes by his stripes we were healed
[59:56] in that that squeezing out of the
[59:59] flowers he was a flower
[1:00:02] i want you to hold that because we're
[1:00:03] coming into a little story brother madam
[1:00:04] gabe bought a flower

[1:00:08] flower that ever growed
[1:00:11] was the lily of the valley

[1:03:30] it's not a religion this message i did
[1:03:32] refute that fact this message is not a
[1:03:35] religion and it's not psychology
[1:03:39] god has his own psychology and it's the
[1:03:41] word
[1:03:42] but the man's psychology is a bunch of
[1:03:44] trash
[1:03:45] because it's what is it it's it's
[1:03:48] psychology is psyche the mind that's
[1:03:51] exactly where the devil wants you all
[1:03:53] the farther he wants you to go is your
[1:03:55] mental mind a feel good
[1:03:59] we want more than feeling good
[1:04:02] we want a true revelation
[1:04:04] something that's going to keep you that
[1:04:05] holds you that won't let you go
[1:04:08] that's himself in you revealed
[1:04:13] amen you know what i'm talking about
[1:04:15] there's three realms
[1:04:16] of a human
[1:04:18] there's that spirit mental realm but
[1:04:20] they're behind that there's a soul in
[1:04:22] that heart there's a place for the soul
[1:04:27] all right
[1:04:29] there
[1:04:30] is where you've got to meet him
[1:04:32] it's either the word or it won't be the
[1:04:33] word
[1:04:35] but the holy spirit was sent to quicken
[1:04:36] that word
[1:04:38] and without the quickening of that word
[1:04:39] there's no birth
[1:04:41] you can have as much anointing as you
[1:04:43] want but if that word's not there to
[1:04:44] receive that quickening power of the
[1:04:46] spirit poured out there's no birth
[1:04:50] but if you have a draw so i can't i
[1:04:52] can't i want him i've got to have him no
[1:04:55] matter what the future holds who i'm
[1:04:57] going to marry whom i'm not going to
[1:04:58] marry what kind of job am i going to
[1:04:59] have what i'm not going to have the
[1:05:01] first things first seek ye first the
[1:05:03] kingdom of god and his righteousness and
[1:05:06] all these other things will be added
[1:05:07] unto you
[1:05:09] put him first
[1:05:11] what would you have me do lord you show
[1:05:13] me what to do
[1:05:15] you show me what steps to take
[1:05:19] open the word to me reveal the word
[1:05:21] reveal the truth to me lord
[1:05:24] i hear people talk about revelation i
[1:05:27] need revelation lord reveal yourself to
[1:05:29] me
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:35] he wants a personal communion and union
[1:05:38] with you
[1:05:40] whether the rest of them do or don't
[1:05:42] it's you
[1:05:43] it's you and god
[1:05:45] it isn't you and parents it's you and
[1:05:47] god
[1:05:49] it's not you and the rest of the the
[1:05:50] peers the rest of your friends it's you
[1:05:52] and god it isn't what they do it's what
[1:05:55] does god want you to do
[1:05:56] what does the word want you to do
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:05] so he said the burden of douma i didn't
[1:06:07] finish that
[1:06:09] watchman what of the night watchman what
[1:06:11] of the night the watchman said the
[1:06:13] morning cometh and also the night
[1:06:17] good morning bride there's a morning
[1:06:18] coming amen
[1:06:20] but also the night
[1:06:23] gross darkness upon the people
[1:06:26] darkness on the earth
[1:06:28] but you're walking in light
[1:06:32] all right then he says but he said if
[1:06:34] you will inquire inquire means to seek
[1:06:37] out
[1:06:38] that inquire there means to search out
[1:06:42] if you inquire if you will inquire then
[1:06:44] inquire ye
[1:06:47] seek it out
[1:06:49] you know take my word for it search it
[1:06:51] out
[1:06:51] seek it out what would be what spirit
[1:06:54] would keep you away from reading and
[1:06:56] feeding on the word of god
[1:06:58] feeding on the message of the hour you
[1:07:00] tell me what spirit that is that would
[1:07:02] point you to something else that's
[1:07:03] temporal
[1:07:04] that will not give you life it's not god
[1:07:07] doing that
[1:07:08] when you have that pull in your heart
[1:07:09] for you i i want more of him he'll point
[1:07:12] you to where you'll find more of him
[1:07:14] he'll point you to his word
[1:07:18] he's not going to point you away from
[1:07:19] the message of the hour he's going to
[1:07:21] point you to the message because the
[1:07:23] message of the hour is jesus christ made
[1:07:25] flesh among us
[1:07:29] it's the fullness of the seed it's the
[1:07:30] fullness of life it's the complete
[1:07:33] revelation of himself that's their
[1:07:34] message of the hour that's easter to us

[1:09:26] attitude
[1:09:30] i won't go there tonight it's the sermon
[1:09:32] in itself
[1:09:36] so we don't know we don't know just what
[1:09:39] time it'll take place what's he speaking
[1:09:40] of he's speaking about the resurrection
[1:09:42] the meeting with our loved ones a
[1:09:44] meeting
[1:09:45] catching
[1:09:46] you know we're going to be caught up
[1:09:47] together
[1:09:50] to meet the lord in the air do you know
[1:09:51] that where's the air is someplace
[1:09:53] between heaven between earth and glory
[1:09:56] in another dimension
[1:09:58] that's right
[1:10:00] you're going to meet him i'm going to
[1:10:01] meet him
[1:10:02] we're going to come and gather it up
[1:10:04] together we just don't know when that's
[1:10:06] going to take place
[1:10:08] we know we're in the season don't we how
[1:10:10] many believe that you know that
[1:10:12] we've already had it said you're at the
[1:10:13] end
[1:10:14] the seventh seal was the sign that the
[1:10:16] end has come
[1:10:18] how much longer the prophet said i don't
[1:10:20] know
[1:10:20] but keep keeping on
[1:10:22] keep steady keep your focus let your eye
[1:10:24] be single
[1:10:27] amen if it's not single say lord sharpen
[1:10:30] my focus on one thing
[1:10:32] that's you the person christ the word
[1:10:34] the presence of jesus christ living in
[1:10:37] me
[1:10:40] what are you trying to say i say focus
[1:10:42] on your strength not your weakness
[1:10:45] this is a weakness this is a weak thing
[1:10:47] and thank god it is because if it wasn't
[1:10:49] you'd be trying to do something that you
[1:10:50] can't do
[1:10:55] that right
[1:10:56] but when you focus on your strength your
[1:10:58] strength is the word revealed in you he
[1:11:00] said i'll take care of it all you die to
[1:11:02] yourself you take up your cross you
[1:11:04] realize you're a weakling and when you
[1:11:05] do you'll yield yourself to me
[1:11:09] and let me work through you my strength
[1:11:11] is made perfect in your weakness then
[1:11:13] paul said now glory in my weakness and
[1:11:15] when i'm weak i'm strong
[1:11:19] when i when i falter and want to make
[1:11:21] mistakes i have to go back and say
[1:11:22] repent it just shows i'm a weakling
[1:11:27] god says that don't bother me
[1:11:29] i'm not looking at what you did or
[1:11:31] didn't do
[1:11:32] i'm looking at my life in you
[1:11:35] isn't it somehow we can be happy and sad
[1:11:37] at the same time
[1:11:40] it's a paradox isn't it
[1:11:42] how we can be happy and sad at the same
[1:11:44] time because one side of us is eternal
[1:11:46] life and the other side is a bunch of
[1:11:48] clay
[1:11:50] that hasn't been born again has been
[1:11:52] changed yet has a nature in it two
[1:11:54] natures living in the same body
[1:11:57] but who's gonna prevail greater is he
[1:11:59] that is in you
[1:12:00] greater is he that's in the word that's
[1:12:02] already begun the work of his own life
[1:12:04] in you to live it and mature it and take
[1:12:06] it home
[1:12:07] and quicken your mortal body as you're
[1:12:09] here subject to the word and then
[1:12:11] quicken and change it
[1:12:13] brother sister if you're not living for
[1:12:15] the lord the lord's not living in you if
[1:12:17] you're not living for the lord
[1:12:20] you don't have nothing
[1:12:23] because it's all going to go away it's
[1:12:25] all passing it's like dust
[1:12:30] what do you have you have nothing
[1:12:33] because everything else is temporal
[1:12:35] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:12:39] and that's god himself the word himself
[1:12:43] living in you
[1:12:45] making you eternal with him making you
[1:12:48] that eternal life
[1:12:50] all right
[1:12:51] i'm not going to get done if i don't get
[1:12:52] done if i don't get started
[1:12:55] okay so we have so we don't know just
[1:12:57] what time it'll take place but it
[1:12:58] behooves us to be ready and listening to
[1:13:00] the warning voice
[1:13:02] listening to the warning voice
[1:13:09] yeah fearful sights see a roaring men's
[1:13:12] hearts failing for fear perplexity of
[1:13:14] times distress between the nations
[1:13:18] how many same men
[1:13:21] all right all these things were to take
[1:13:23] place and we got it
[1:13:25] and
[1:13:26] he said the church would be heady
[1:13:29] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:13:31] lovers of god look around you lovers of
[1:13:34] pleasure lovers of pleasure more than
[1:13:38] lovers of god
[1:13:42] listen that isn't the world out here
[1:13:44] they're talking about the church
[1:13:49] they claim to be believers they claim to
[1:13:51] have the holy ghost they claim what's
[1:13:53] these what what's happening here
[1:13:55] it's that carnal church
[1:13:57] we want your name but we don't want to
[1:13:59] we don't want your life we want your
[1:14:00] name
[1:14:04] and that spirit comes right down and say
[1:14:06] we want the message we don't want the
[1:14:07] life we want the message
[1:14:12] we just want a prophet to tell us what
[1:14:14] to do we're looking for him to come back
[1:14:16] and tell us what to do
[1:14:17] he's already told you what to do
[1:14:23] hallelujah yes he has he's already done
[1:14:25] told you thank god for the revelation of

[1:15:06] that's more the way he's not complete he
[1:15:07] said i'm not complete without you

[1:18:24] mental
[1:18:25] human appetite hungry for what is your
[1:18:27] soul hungry for
[1:18:30] what is it yearning for way down deep
[1:18:32] what do you really want
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:40] let the holy spirit influence you
[1:18:42] you're going to have someone or the
[1:18:44] other spirit or power influence you but
[1:18:45] let the holy spirit influence you you're
[1:18:47] going to go out in the world and you're
[1:18:48] going to be you're going to be lambasted
[1:18:50] with every influence there is influence
[1:18:52] of music influence of dress influence of
[1:18:55] others dressing influence of this
[1:18:56] influence of that
[1:18:58] every spirit you can imagine it's all
[1:19:00] coming down from one spirit
[1:19:04] amen that's right just in many faceted
[1:19:07] forms
[1:19:08] many members
[1:19:10] just like god has many members but all
[1:19:12] one word
[1:19:14] one god
[1:19:15] you see how satan doesn't have anything
[1:19:17] original
[1:19:20] you just remember that satan does not
[1:19:22] have anything original
[1:19:24] he's a perverter of the original
[1:19:27] he's a high breeder
[1:19:29] and high breed anything is death it's
[1:19:31] not an original form
[1:19:33] he can't reproduce
[1:19:35] so
[1:19:37] god wants you to know have the original
[1:19:41] amen you don't have to add your opinion
[1:19:44] to the original you don't have to add
[1:19:45] your thoughts and your reasoning to it
[1:19:47] you just accept and believe it because
[1:19:49] that original word is perfect
[1:19:51] it's flawless
[1:19:52] it doesn't need anything added to it or
[1:19:54] taken from it and in that form it'll do
[1:19:57] what it said
[1:19:59] amen
[1:20:01] that's right
[1:20:03] so anything the devil's god is an
[1:20:05] impersonation why would you want a bogus
[1:20:09] dollar
[1:20:10] the word bogus anybody know what word
[1:20:11] bogus means okay
[1:20:13] or a copy of anything when you can have
[1:20:16] the original
[1:20:18] why would you want a copy of religion
[1:20:21] when you can have the original why would
[1:20:23] you want a copy of christianity when you
[1:20:24] can have the original
[1:20:26] why do you want a copy of god's life
[1:20:28] when you can have the original
[1:20:32] the original is present why take a why
[1:20:35] take a copy why take why take a
[1:20:38] counterfeit
[1:20:40] when you can have the original
[1:20:42] the very original object himself
[1:20:45] himself
[1:20:46] well you could have the person himself
[1:20:49] living in you
[1:20:52] amen
[1:20:54] it's kind of ridiculous isn't it
[1:20:56] to think we'd turn down
[1:20:58] eternal life and accept death yeah
[1:21:00] wouldn't that be crazy wouldn't that
[1:21:02] just absolutely be insane
[1:21:06] and it is
[1:21:10] if you've got a tug for him
[1:21:12] why don't we let go of it
[1:21:14] i mean let it go let it let him have it
[1:21:17] amen
[1:21:19] amen don't try to don't try to cover it
[1:21:21] over with your reasoning well maybe
[1:21:22] another time maybe something the devil
[1:21:24] will tell you what are your friends
[1:21:25] going to think
[1:21:27] yeah that's right
[1:21:30] what's others going to think when you
[1:21:32] said i believe the message and all of a
[1:21:33] sudden you've come to the realization
[1:21:35] you really don't have what you thought
[1:21:36] you had
[1:21:38] but you need it
[1:21:39] and god's wanting to give it to you you
[1:21:41] know what the believers think of you
[1:21:43] praise the lord
[1:21:45] that's my brother that's my sister
[1:21:48] we'd say hallelujah thank the lord
[1:21:50] that's exactly what we want that's
[1:21:52] exactly the truth that's life
[1:21:54] why accept death when you can have life
[1:21:58] so let me tell you this story before
[1:21:59] time gets away from me
[1:22:02] so he comes down to a little story i
[1:22:04] heard one time from of a man
[1:22:06] oh he was poor he always wanted to he
[1:22:09] said it's a little fairy story like
[1:22:13] it always stuck with me though
[1:22:15] one day he picked up a flower and the
[1:22:18] flower was magical
[1:22:20] he told a magic story
[1:22:23] yeah you sure did
[1:22:25] but do you get the gist of what he's
[1:22:26] talking about
[1:22:28] it's a lot more than magic
[1:22:32] the flower was magic
[1:22:36] are you going to read between the lines
[1:22:39] all right
[1:22:40] the flower answered to him and said
[1:22:44] now here's the flower speaking
[1:22:48] hello
[1:22:49] here's the flower speaking we're going
[1:22:52] to call the flower the rose of sharon
[1:22:58] amen
[1:23:00] the lily of the valley
[1:23:04] he's speaking and he spoke to this man
[1:23:07] and he said you've been poor all your
[1:23:08] life he said now ask what you will and
[1:23:11] it'll be given to you
[1:23:15] sound familiar
[1:23:21] he said he said that yonder mountain
[1:23:23] would open up
[1:23:25] and that the boy said the man said the
[1:23:27] yonder that yonder mountain would open
[1:23:30] up and i could go there in
[1:23:32] wonderful i wonder if you find a white
[1:23:35] stone
[1:23:40] with a mystery
[1:23:43] that needed to be revealed opened
[1:23:46] you know it was in the pyramid mountain
[1:23:49] all right
[1:23:51] all right so he said that yonder
[1:23:53] mountain opened i could go there in and
[1:23:55] find the gold the gold the gold
[1:23:59] in the
[1:24:00] mountain
[1:24:02] all right then he said well he said
[1:24:04] you'll have to take me with you though
[1:24:09] yeah thank the lord
[1:24:12] i'll have to go with you you know
[1:24:16] you'll have to take me with you
[1:24:18] so wherever i am
[1:24:20] then you can ask what you will
[1:24:25] if you abide in me
[1:24:27] and my word in you
[1:24:29] ask what you will
[1:24:31] is that right and it shall be done unto
[1:24:34] you
[1:24:35] i'll never leave you i'll never forsake
[1:24:37] you i'll be with you even
[1:24:40] in you
[1:24:42] but you'll have to take me because where
[1:24:44] i am
[1:24:46] there will my servant be amen
[1:24:50] amen
[1:24:52] or where my servant is
[1:24:54] i abide in him i can't if she goes i go
[1:24:57] with her
[1:24:59] this isn't a boyfriend girlfriend affair
[1:25:01] this is a union we're talking about
[1:25:02] between the bride and the bridegroom
[1:25:07] it didn't come to full fruition like
[1:25:08] we're going to see today because now
[1:25:10] this is coming to a wedding supper
[1:25:13] in the original beginning it didn't
[1:25:17] i'm not talking about i'm talking about
[1:25:19] when christ was here that original
[1:25:20] pentecostal ride
[1:25:22] it had a marriage
[1:25:24] but it didn't come to full fruition
[1:25:26] why because god kept that mystery a
[1:25:28] secret
[1:25:30] until this hour
[1:25:32] that's the very thing that will
[1:25:33] literally turn the heart of the children
[1:25:35] back to that original faith
[1:25:38] that mystery
[1:25:42] that's what makes the bride so different
[1:25:45] what makes you so different
[1:25:46] what must i
[1:25:48] do to inherit what you have
[1:25:52] to do anything to inherit it
[1:25:55] it's freely given
[1:25:57] in fact we're here to impart it if you
[1:25:59] believe
[1:26:03] amen
[1:26:04] all right you think you have the pot do
[1:26:06] you have the authority to depart life

[1:26:13] gold have a numb but such as i have i
[1:26:15] impart it
[1:26:18] amen

[1:26:23] all right
[1:26:24] that's what god that's what we come to
[1:26:25] church for he's imparting
[1:26:31] you'll take me so wherever i am then you
[1:26:33] can ask what you will he walked to the

[1:26:58] this mountain
[1:27:03] and the mountain opened up and he went
[1:27:04] in and the shelves were full of gold

[1:28:14] about message trial
[1:28:17] right

[1:28:18] he preached a message called trial in
[1:28:20] fact he gave jesus christ a fair trial
[1:28:22] maybe you ought to go and hear it
[1:28:24] sometime

[1:28:34] besides one they didn't even minister
[1:28:36] tape and and probably
[1:28:38] tape but that's the ones we have on
[1:28:40] record and a volume the volume do you

[1:28:55] if it was written of jesus christ which
[1:28:57] it is the full revelation i'm the
[1:28:59] completed revelation of himself
[1:29:03] it's written of me
[1:29:07] hallelujah it's written of me
[1:29:11] all right
[1:29:13] so he walked the mountain the mountain
[1:29:15] opened up the shelves were full of gold
[1:29:16] and diamonds and a little fairy and the
[1:29:18] little fairy story goes he laid the
[1:29:20] flower down
[1:29:25] like going off and leaving jesus in the
[1:29:27] mountain
[1:29:29] what happened when they got out there
[1:29:30] without him
[1:29:32] but you know what
[1:29:35] he always comes back on time
[1:29:38] he has mercy endureth forever
[1:29:42] amen
[1:29:43] so he said he a little he laid the
[1:29:45] flower down on a table on or a rock and
[1:29:48] he run and grabbed a great big gem
[1:29:51] and he said i must go show this to my
[1:29:54] friends
[1:29:56] nothing wrong with that go show it to
[1:29:57] your friends
[1:30:02] if you got something that's of value you
[1:30:04] like to share it

[1:30:08] where'd you find that
[1:30:10] in a hidden place
[1:30:12] well i got to go there but you can't go
[1:30:14] there you've got to have this flower
[1:30:18] all right
[1:30:20] nothing like that flower you know
[1:30:21] there's nothing like it
[1:30:26] and he laid the flower down okay then he
[1:30:28] said i have everything now i must go
[1:30:30] this showed my friend now i'm a rich man
[1:30:33] i have everything i must show this
[1:30:36] and so the flowers spoke up and said you
[1:30:38] have forgot the main thing
[1:30:45] so he runs back and picks it up and says
[1:30:47] well maybe i'll get a piece of gold i'll
[1:30:49] i'll get a piece of silver and so he
[1:30:51] said i'll hurry out to tell the people
[1:30:53] how rich i am and all i've got and he
[1:30:55] got to the door and the flower said but
[1:30:56] you forgot the main thing
[1:31:05] he forgot the main thing so he runs back
[1:31:07] and he said in here
[1:31:10] he runs back and he said in here we find
[1:31:12] all kinds of materials so he picked up a
[1:31:14] stone he said i'll take this stone and
[1:31:16] show the people what kind of a stone in
[1:31:18] this mountain made of so i can find my
[1:31:20] way back to it see
[1:31:23] and he started out the door and the
[1:31:25] flower said for the final time you have
[1:31:27] forgot the main thing
[1:31:32] oh he said oh shut up
[1:31:38] he what did he do
[1:31:39] still the warning
[1:31:42] he forgot the main thing
[1:31:45] see he didn't want to hear it anymore
[1:31:48] forgot the main thing and he ran out the
[1:31:50] door and when he did the door closed
[1:31:52] behind him
[1:31:54] someday the door is closing
[1:31:56] yeah i trust it isn't already
[1:32:02] but if you have a desire for him
[1:32:05] i'd run as hard as you can into his
[1:32:07] presence
[1:32:10] because tomorrow may be too late
[1:32:15] i don't mean to scare you i mean to be

[1:42:55] all right
[1:42:57] now
[1:42:59] you he is the head of the church
[1:43:02] that in all things

[1:43:08] first born from the dead that in all
[1:43:10] things he might have the prominence can
[1:43:11] i have one more story here before i
[1:43:13] leave and i'll i'll have to close
[1:43:16] i was going to get into mechanics and
[1:43:17] dynamics because that's the main thing
[1:43:19] too
[1:43:20] you can have all the words you want but
[1:43:22] without the dynamics it won't live
[1:43:25] that's right you can have all the you
[1:43:27] can have all the word you want without
[1:43:29] the dynamics won't live and you can have
[1:43:30] all the dynamics you want without the
[1:43:32] word and it still won't live
[1:43:35] so it takes dynamics and mechanics
[1:43:37] together you've got to have dynamics and
[1:43:40] mechanics together the
[1:43:42] dynamics have to come on the word no
[1:43:44] matter how much of a simonized job and
[1:43:46] how much of a paint job you've given it
[1:43:48] and how much of everything else you
[1:43:49] might dress even look alike and
[1:43:51] everything else you might shout and
[1:43:52] everything else without the word there
[1:43:54] for the holy spirit to quicken
[1:43:56] it doesn't it won't live
[1:43:59] you can't manifest the word but you can
[1:44:01] have all the word you want you can have
[1:44:02] the gasoline the powers in the gasoline
[1:44:04] but if there's no spark to spark the
[1:44:06] gasoline
[1:44:09] it won't live the word won't live
[1:44:12] will manifest we are here to manifest
[1:44:15] what the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:44:18] that's our purpose for being here
[1:44:21] so i'm just going to give you that's a
[1:44:22] quick synopsis you can go back to you go
[1:44:25] back to about paragraph 100 through
[1:44:27] about paragraph 113
[1:44:29] of rising of the sun
[1:44:32] and find what i'm talking about and i'd
[1:44:34] say maybe you ought to do it find out
[1:44:36] what god's wanting until we become both
[1:44:39] dynamics and mechanics no good
[1:44:42] the spirit without the word no good and
[1:44:44] the word without the spirit no good
[1:44:48] amen
[1:44:50] it's got to have both
[1:44:51] and this bride will be both because he
[1:44:53] was both if you want to see a genuine
[1:44:55] manifestation of jesus christ in your
[1:44:57] life you've got to have both
[1:44:59] amen
[1:45:01] amen and it'll send you right down the
[1:45:02] road to the rapture
[1:45:05] that's it you want to see jesus christ
[1:45:07] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:45:09] you've got to have both mechanics and
[1:45:11] dynamics
[1:45:13] amen now let me
[1:45:14] finish well we're letting you brother
[1:45:16] david okay
[1:45:18] let me finish
[1:45:23] let's turn to saint john 10.
[1:45:26] this is the last scripture i'll read
[1:45:27] here saint john 10.
[1:45:30] remember
[1:45:32] the lord said i am the way
[1:45:34] i am the truth
[1:45:36] and i am the life
[1:45:38] so without me
[1:45:40] you can do nothing
[1:45:42] i am the way i'm the truth and i'm the
[1:45:44] life that's saint john 14 6. but st john
[1:45:48] 10.
[1:45:56] watch what the watch what the thief is
[1:45:58] trying to do
[1:46:00] we're going to talk about a thief here
[1:46:01] in just a minute
[1:46:02] this last story i want to give you we're
[1:46:04] going to talk about the thief
[1:46:08] jesus said in the ninth verse i am the
[1:46:10] door by me if any man enter in he shall
[1:46:13] be saved and shall go in and out and
[1:46:17] find
[1:46:18] pasture
[1:46:20] you're going to have food
[1:46:24] amen
[1:46:25] verse 10 the thief
[1:46:28] cometh not now you know the lord isn't
[1:46:29] the thief
[1:46:32] he does come as a thief
[1:46:34] but he's not a thief
[1:46:36] so we're not talking about that we're
[1:46:38] talking about the thief himself so the
[1:46:41] thief cometh not but for to what
[1:46:43] steal
[1:46:45] and to kill
[1:46:46] and to destroy
[1:46:49] i am come that you might have life who's
[1:46:52] speaking who is the i am saying i will
[1:46:54] come
[1:46:55] i am come not i will i am
[1:46:59] i am come
[1:47:00] that you might have life and that you
[1:47:02] might have it more
[1:47:05] abundantly
[1:47:09] what an offer
[1:47:13] who could turn that down
[1:47:19] there's only one person that would turn
[1:47:20] that down the devil
[1:47:25] the rest of them are believers
[1:47:28] all right are you with me
[1:47:30] unbelief come from the devil sin came
[1:47:32] from the devil they don't believe this
[1:47:34] to begin with but you were in him to
[1:47:36] begin with and you believe it to begin
[1:47:39] with
[1:47:40] and you always did believe it to begin
[1:47:42] with so let go and let god have his way
[1:47:46] amen
[1:47:48] i'm speaking to believers here
[1:47:50] right all right but the thief cometh not
[1:47:53] but for to steal from you to kill you
[1:47:55] and to destroy you and oh he does it so
[1:47:58] suddenly and so beautifully and so
[1:47:59] reasonably
[1:48:04] he wants you to reason with the word it
[1:48:06] can't be because you can't have because
[1:48:09] because what nothing
[1:48:11] the bible didn't say you can have it
[1:48:12] because
[1:48:14] the bible said you can have it take it
[1:48:16] believe it accept it it's yours
[1:48:20] if he gives you a free gift

[1:48:25] 100 bill or something like that in the
[1:48:26] service one time come and get it or
[1:48:28] dollar bill maybe
[1:48:30] anyway
[1:48:32] what if i had a thousand dollars here
[1:48:34] and i was handing it to you
[1:48:36] oh i can't take it
[1:48:38] i can't take that what will people think
[1:48:40] if i take this thousand dollars you
[1:48:42] wouldn't care you could care less what
[1:48:44] people think

[1:48:49] should you care what people think
[1:48:59] that's the truth why would you care what

[1:51:25] are here cattle ranch above here above
[1:51:27] phoenix i was reading
[1:51:29] a piece
[1:51:31] of of a prospect a paper about a
[1:51:33] prospector
[1:51:35] then there was no roads
[1:51:37] through here then just a little sand
[1:51:39] paths
[1:51:40] they still do a lot of prospecting in
[1:51:42] here you know
[1:51:44] and i know there's gold mines up above
[1:51:45] if anybody's from really their arizona
[1:51:47] up above phoenix and wickenburg
[1:51:49] there's gold mines a vulture mine up
[1:51:50] there was a big gold mine at one time
[1:51:53] so there's prospectors there's been a
[1:51:55] lot of prospectors in arizona
[1:51:58] still a lot of prospectors here
[1:52:00] i pray you're prospecting tonight
[1:52:06] you say i've been prospecting
[1:52:08] you just keep searching
[1:52:10] seek and you shall find
[1:52:13] amen
[1:52:15] all right all right
[1:52:17] but the prospector he said no roads here
[1:52:20] just a little sand paths they still do a
[1:52:22] lot of prospecting here you know but the
[1:52:24] prospector had come in
[1:52:26] and he had found a lot of gold a lot of
[1:52:28] money and struck a lot of gold and on
[1:52:30] his road in he stayed in a cabin he had
[1:52:32] found
[1:52:33] and he had a dog with him
[1:52:35] faithful dog
[1:52:37] been with him for the years he's been
[1:52:39] out there searching and looking
[1:52:42] tied up on the outside
[1:52:45] and that and that night there had been
[1:52:47] an outlaw following him
[1:52:51] called the thief
[1:52:55] we just read about
[1:52:56] him he's after you if he could get you
[1:53:00] he wants your gold
[1:53:02] he can't have it but he don't want you
[1:53:04] to have it
[1:53:10] but it's not for him
[1:53:13] all right
[1:53:15] and so he had a dog faithful dog had him
[1:53:17] tied up on the outside he had this cabin
[1:53:20] and that night there had been an outlaw
[1:53:22] not knowing it he had an outlaw
[1:53:23] following him to get his gold
[1:53:25] he had packed it up in the old spanish
[1:53:27] he had picked it up in the old spanish
[1:53:29] mines and he was coming in with it and
[1:53:31] the dog started barking so here's the
[1:53:34] prospector inside he lays his bag upon
[1:53:37] the table
[1:53:38] he said you know they didn't say that
[1:53:40] brother david but i read another story
[1:53:42] refers to it he laid his
[1:53:44] bag upon the table
[1:53:46] starts counting it out
[1:53:48] and my i'm just going to be i'm really
[1:53:50] wealthy boy and just right in the
[1:53:52] morning i'm going to take this now he
[1:53:54] started dreaming about how what he'd buy
[1:53:56] and what he'd do and he's unwealthy
[1:54:02] and that night
[1:54:04] outlaw was following him he picked it up
[1:54:07] he excuse me and the man didn't want to
[1:54:09] be bothered with the dog but as he
[1:54:11] started to lay down
[1:54:14] dreaming about what he'd do the dog
[1:54:15] started barking
[1:54:19] and the man didn't want to be bothered
[1:54:21] with that dog
[1:54:25] i hear that minister all the time all he
[1:54:27] does is yell at me
[1:54:31] i'm getting tired of his barking
[1:54:39] i wish you wouldn't bark so but if i
[1:54:41] didn't bark you wouldn't be warned
[1:54:45] or if my brother didn't bark not just me
[1:54:48] i'm talking about the ministry
[1:54:50] it's not easy to bark
[1:54:53] when you know you might get shot
[1:54:58] that's right
[1:54:59] you don't want to hear the bark many
[1:55:01] people don't want to hear the bark you
[1:55:02] know he told that enough about how i
[1:55:04] dress and what i do and what i don't do
[1:55:06] god's not pleased with it
[1:55:10] so why shouldn't i tell you the truth
[1:55:13] why keep it from me if god's not pleased
[1:55:15] with it let me tell you he's not pleased
[1:55:18] if he's not pleased
[1:55:20] don't neglect the voice
[1:55:25] all right
[1:55:26] and so
[1:55:27] he comes there he says
[1:55:36] said tomorrow i'll take this to the city
[1:55:40] and so and i'll have it wait up and i'll
[1:55:42] be a rich man i'll buy great cars i'll
[1:55:44] have all kinds of women and big parties
[1:55:45] and i'll be a rich man because i've
[1:55:47] already struck a threat to claim
[1:55:50] i've got the gold here much of it
[1:55:52] and while he was trying to go to sleep

[2:00:57] let's bow our heads

[2:01:05] do you want more of him or don't you
[2:01:08] every head bowed i want your eyes closed
[2:01:10] just every head well
[2:01:12] do you want more of him
[2:01:14] if you do you want him to come and live
[2:01:17] in you raise your hand high so he can
[2:01:19] see it
[2:01:20] not just a halfway hearted raise of hand
[2:01:22] let's raise it up you really want him
[2:01:28] then accept it
[2:01:29] [Music]
[2:01:31] it isn't just for brother david it isn't
[2:01:32] just for ministers it isn't just for old
[2:01:35] people this message listen brother
[2:01:37] sister
[2:01:38] this become real to me at 12 years old
[2:01:42] this is not a play thing
[2:01:45] god kept me
[2:01:47] through those teen hard teen years
[2:01:50] he wouldn't leave me
[2:01:52] but he changed me
[2:01:54] i'm not
[2:01:56] special as any of you
[2:01:58] he can change you
[2:02:01] when he called me
[2:02:03] i answered why because he put that in me
[2:02:06] to answer
[2:02:08] [Music]
[2:02:10] could i do that on my own no
[2:02:13] but he put that in me
[2:02:15] to do it
[2:02:17] now what means more to you
[2:02:19] what the devil's telling you through
[2:02:20] reasoning saying oh don't do that don't
[2:02:23] do that you got all kinds of time no you
[2:02:25] don't you don't even know how much time
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:32] i'm gonna ask you
[2:02:35] to get alone with god tonight
[2:02:37] if you're serious
[2:02:40] if you're serious
[2:02:41] and you really want him i'm asking you
[2:02:44] before you go to sleep tonight you take
[2:02:46] that time with him you stay there
[2:02:49] and i challenge him
[2:02:51] to take him at his word
[2:02:55] if you're serious with god god will get
[2:02:57] serious with you
[2:03:00] but you're gonna have to ask him
[2:03:02] you're gonna have to go to
[2:03:07] repenting and being baptized is not a
[2:03:09] ritual
[2:03:10] it's not something we just do
[2:03:13] it's a genuine sovereign sincere thing
[2:03:17] now you've done that
[2:03:19] now go on with him
[2:03:21] some have some haven't done that
[2:03:23] [Music]
[2:03:26] but it's open for you that's the command
[2:03:30] that's the obedience that he wants you
[2:03:32] to obey
[2:03:34] there's only three physical things that
[2:03:36] god asks you to obey physically physical
[2:03:38] ordinances
[2:03:42] that was
[2:03:43] water baptism by repentance
[2:03:47] after repentance it's not the water that
[2:03:49] saves you brother sister it's the faith
[2:03:51] in the blood that saves you
[2:03:53] and then the life of that blood can be
[2:03:55] imparted to you
[2:03:59] because then the power of the blood
[2:04:01] sanctifies
[2:04:03] sets a
[2:04:04] person clean
[2:04:06] he can come and live in
[2:04:10] the other two is foot washing and lord's
[2:04:13] supper
[2:04:15] but how you gonna take that until you
[2:04:17] are in communion with him
[2:04:20] because when you're in communion with
[2:04:21] him
[2:04:22] then you can show the rest of them you
[2:04:24] are in communion
[2:04:31] if you don't take it
[2:04:33] it shows you have no part with it
[2:04:37] so it becomes a showdown
[2:04:40] you take it unworthily
[2:04:43] see if you take it
[2:04:46] don't take it i should say
[2:04:50] then you're showing
[2:04:52] you have no part with him
[2:04:54] [Music]
[2:04:57] but if you take it unworthily
[2:05:00] you bring damnation upon your own self
[2:05:04] so be right there's no reason to be
[2:05:06] halfway
[2:05:08] let's go all the way
[2:05:11] amen
[2:05:14] let's sing that song i'm going to leave
[2:05:16] it in your hands
[2:05:20] no special rituals
[2:05:22] [Music]
[2:05:23] you've been told how to get it how to
[2:05:25] come to it
[2:05:28] you need
[2:05:29] you need to make your decision
[2:05:34] dragging you
[2:05:35] nobody's forcing you nobody's pounding
[2:05:38] on your back
[2:05:40] you either come by the way of the word
[2:05:43] or you don't come the right way
[2:05:46] amen
[2:05:47] it's the way of truth
[2:05:51] and if he's called you and he's pulling
[2:05:53] on you then you better thank the lord
[2:05:55] because whom he called
[2:05:58] he can justify
[2:05:59] and we
[2:06:00] justifies and glorify
[2:06:03] amen
