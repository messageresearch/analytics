down in my heart his spirit is moving deep down in my heart as the prophet said it would be oh deep down in my heart there's a mighty revelation of the coming of the lord as the waters cover the sea now here it is all around the bride that's the only place his spirit is moving in the bride of christ the bride it's a mighty revelation of the coming of the lord as the waters cover the sea

hallelujah hallelujah [Music] is it good to be in the house of the lord today amen well we're very happy to have our brother diddy sister leslie ann their son william it's been a long time since i think i was trying to remember when we shook hands last and it's actually would have to be measured in years and uh that's too bad but welcome grace tabernacle this morning amen my brother david sister natalie god bless you and your lovely children they're so grown up my they were just what a friend of mine calls kneecappers when we saw them last and sister chicana god bless you just get a jump in the car and go for a trip it looks like so how much fun that would be so happy to have all of you i just want to ask our brother didier to come and just greet you brother didier pastors of church is that marysville or you can tell us amen so just good to see your brother amen certainly not i'm a privilege to be here this morning i was also trying to remember when was the last time brother paul and i had met i think i couldn't really place it but uh it's very good to see you he hasn't changed much alexander's funeral oh yes yes yes yes that's correct you see he's he's much younger you know his his memory is better than mine so god bless you and it's good to be here for the first time but to feel the prince of the lord and to realize that this is a portion of his lovely bride as we heard and that pulsation of faith that is coming even in the song just makes us feel at home so we're here to enjoy the prince of the lord and the word and it's good to also see some old friend with jason well just bring a lot of memory when you make this kind of a connection with sister amy and our brother sergey is not here but i saw his daughter and also other sister sarah and brother dean of course we were connected recently uh brother dinardo such a precious visit that we made in in oregon there had a chance to see him so we're just glad to be in the company of the saint where the spirit of god can move freely and where the word of god can touch our lives and our hearts and revive us this is the time for the bread revival you know you can't look for it to come down the road uh today is our day so we just want to jump in the water as it's being stirred not studying it wondering what's happening but just getting the spirit as the song are moving us already in that channel so you always do a fantastic job god bless you and we appreciate it of course i realized that uh yes things run in the family your brother's such a preacher and you're such a song leader just about so god bless you and marry just to enjoy the prince of the lord let loose and let the holy ghost move upon us and anoint his servant it's good to be with you god bless you amen well i have to tell you that um when brother tim was making his words there if you can't preach under this i was actually afraid he was going to bust out and start quoting the quotes i have in my sermon this morning amen so it's just good to be in the house of the lord just pray each and every one of you let's just open up amen we have the pure word of god it's come to us and we are the recipients of the greatest gift that has been given to mankind amen so let's just stand and go in our bibles to first samuel the second chapter once again uh just going to speak to you on a second part of our call to action and uh you know just kind of uh i just really feel like the presence of the lord is moving this morning just to hear the words of our brothers and what they're saying and and talking about revelation talking about action already and this is what's upon our heart today so just believing that uh god is moving in our midst do you believe god works in the whole body amen he's not just looking for some anointed minister while the people the prophet of god speaks of this while the people sit there and wonder what's going on there's just some anointed ministry this bride brother didier as you just spoke this bride is anointed by the word she is the word and it is alive in her it's it's not a dead letter we're not sitting here quoting as it would be uh luther and trying to find that was there we know what was there right as i was just you know sharing uh uh with uh brother tim as we talked to him just a little bit before the service today uh my brother and sister we don't quote the message because that validates what we're speaking we quote the message because we relate to what it is and it becomes alive to us and and really speaks the very essence of what is in our hearts amen if we need to quote the message to validate ourselves as message believers we've missed the whole revelation of jesus christ amen hallelujah let's just go to the word i got quite a bit today so amen first samuel the second chapter the first verse and hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the lord my horn is exalted in the lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies now we have to recognize my brother and sister that one of the enemies that hannah had was herself so see the word of god will come and actually cause you to overcome all of your self well i was raised in a very quiet or by nature our family doesn't worship by nature this by nature that by you'll overcome that you'll overcome that because i rejoice in thy salvation there is none as holy as the lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our god hallelujah we'll tie i pray with god's grace that back together talk no more so exceedingly proudly let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are girded with strength they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they that were hungry ceased so that the baron hath born seven and she that hath many children is waxed feeble the lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and lifteth off he raised up the poor out of the dust and lifted up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory oh can't you say hallelujah to that we were nothing we were nothing my brother and sister and he brought us and makes us to inherit this throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lords and he has set the world upon them he will keep the feet of his saints and the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail lord we ask blessings upon your word today bless your saints we pray amen you may be seated you know as we read these scriptures we see the action that god bringeth forth we see that everything that is done is done of the lord that no man can by his own strength accomplish anything and as we look at this i want to just go back real quickly and just to look at this through the scriptures verse 2 says there's none holy as the lord and there's no rock like our god my brother and sister everything we have has been built upon that rock hallelujah it was not a rock that come from some man's idea was not a rock that was something where we found a place and said okay this is this and this is that you know the prophet of god talking about how that these people gave reverence as it was to the supposed nails that were driven in our lord jesus and declares then that there are several sets they claim they have it they have that they have it they have it but those meant nothing my brother and sister because it was the very life of jesus christ that was given for you and i was what it was all about it wasn't if we had wood from the cross or the nails or the hammer that drove them none of that mattered my brother and sister because the plan of god was not actually centered around the actual event of the crucifixion but it was about the life that was in him and the restoration of the life in you and i amen and he knew what it would take to redeem you and i and so he went through the action of redemption because he knew what it would be now my brother and sister we can tie this back as we have spoken many times here in the church and realize that the very plan of redemption you see the lamb died before the foundation of the world and so it's not that we had an act even if they had had a video as it were of of the crucifixion that my brother and sister is something that god made real to you and i to understand in our human element uh the very cost that it was so it was not just words upon a page but mankind become a personal witnesses of the event of the sacrifice that was given and so it says here that uh by him actions are weighed and so as we are speaking of this my brother and sister you will find uh just trying to parry this down today to not be too long but you look at this and the prophet of god says in several places that if you believe that i'm paraphrasing this if you believe you will act upon it so if you don't act upon it you don't really believe it so we want to not today just be men and women of words but we want to be men and women sons and daughters of god of action we want to be able to take this word and apply it to ourself and brother brown uses many examples he talks about how you can't blame the the uh uh pharmacist you can't blame the man if you won't take the medicine and so as we'll come today by god's grace uh every man that was ever called had a calling in his life to the ministry and he stands there my brother and sister it is not by him but he is ordained of god called of god to bring as it were the medicine to the bride of christ and if she will receive it if if men and women will receive it it is a life-changing event but we have to receive it or act upon it and we go and look at these paradoxes that go down through this scripture verse 4 the bows of mighty men are broken so the very strength they had everything they had behind them is now broken and the weak the they the stumble are girded with strength all these are a paradox and so those that were once full once that had everything they needed had need of nothing uh find themselves uh hiring themselves out or laboring for bread and you know those that were hungry uh cease to be hungry now i want to tell you my brother and sister there's something that is happening in the bride of jesus christ a lot of things happening in the bride of jesus christ but one of the things that's happening in the bride of jesus christ i believe with my heart in the hour we're living is that they are hungering they're not just sitting waiting we can sit and watch the hours the days the weeks uh tick by but my brother and sister the bride of christ is hungering to see the word fulfilled it is not just well when the time has come it will be fulfilled you see we are there the ones that are called to sigh and cry for the abominations we're the ones that are troubled not just to see what's happening in the inner cities and to see all of the disparities of our nation and and governments but my brother and sister we are longing as brother jason sang the song this morning led us in that song this world is not my home and i hope that's not just words what we speak i hope there's something in an unction inside of us saying lord come quickly come quickly lord this is not my home i i don't feel comfortable here anymore i can't relate to it amen i know as a young man i was interested in sports and i'm not speaking about that if you have interest i'm not speaking down on that i'm just speaking along these lines but i i was a young man i was fanatically involved you love to ride dirt bikes i like to do certain things and and i found through the years my brother and sister that my interest in all of these things has waned but something inside me has not waned something inside me has not faltered something inside of me has not went away with time and there's something inside of me that's actually growing and it's getting stronger and stronger and stronger and that is my desire to stand in the very physical presence of my lord jesus christ no longer just to be a person that would just talk about it but lord let it be an action that takes place in me amen and we look at this and realize the lord killeth in verse 6 and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and lifteth up he raised up the poor out of the dust lifted the beggar from the dung hill and set them among the princes to make them inheritors my brother and sister not just a name on a page i i like to you know study these things just to look at examples and my brother and sister you see you can write a will you can have an ancestry and you can write a will but the will in and of itself has no value unless there is something inside of the will for a man to die and just leave a note and to say to my son and to my daughter and there's nothing else there it's empty but my brothers and sisters we're inheritors of the greatest gift that has ever been imparted on the face of the earth we're inheritors of an inheritance immeasurable in the carnal we're inheritors my brother and sister of not only just eternal life but to have the very nature of our lord jesus christ i'm telling you that's something and we don't have to wait my brother and sister to inherit most of this for the word of god says and the prophet reiterates these things that we're here in heavenly places my brother and sister that's not when we're standing before the throne that's here you and i in the presence of almighty god receiving of the word and the life that was imparted in the word right now hallelujah not looking for a move tomorrow not looking for a move next week or next year but to know christ is here in you and i the hope of glory made a life hallelujah no longer ink upon the page but a living word testifying of jesus christ right here today hallelujah oh i'll tell you when we get to when we get that my brother and sister we catch that the very essence of it the fact that the hunger that you have is ceased but it's not and the reason we can say it ceased because in the carnal we look at this and realize okay you get up in the morning early with the sun and you work five or six hours you're hungry you said now and you eat in a few more hours you're hungry again or some of us seemingly in 30 minutes we're hungry again that in the flesh will never cease and the parallel is that your hunger has been satisfied when you come into the presence of god but yet in a little while you want to experience that again and again and again you see we don't come into the house of god and then leave here and say oh i'm satisfied and then have to go out there to find something to eat we get to come back again and again and again i love that because we can sit here i hope you're following me we can sit here today and say we are satisfied are you with me but i do want more i want to be fed again and i want to be fed again i want his presence again and again and again you see but our hunger for the things of the world has ceased i thank god for that my brother and sister because you see without the holy ghost we would be out there hungering with them but god in his mercy has come and and has satisfied that hallelujah and you look as we look down through these scriptures i think i've given enough example for you to see all of this my brother and sister is an action that god is bringing forth he's declared in his own word through the words of a prophet through through the words of the ages of men through the ages he has declared all of the things that he can and will do and desires to do and will do and you hope for and he will do amen and it comes down to that my brother and sister you see that everything that we have is because of him and he says in verse 9 he will keep the feet of his saints my brother and sister you can't tell me today god has not honored that in your life and my life he has kept our feet amen there has been so many things even in the context of the message come around where people trying to draw away different ideas different concepts but yet god constantly brings us right back to the word of god that has become our absolute and he guides us back to that over and over and over again you know forgive me for such a poor analogy but you know sitting in a modern day tractor and sitting there going down the field you know and and we're planting and season now is upon us and we're planting it i can watch the the gps monitor in the tractor amen and and i'll help you take this i hope this doesn't sound just ridiculous but all kinds of little analogies that people have put on that i always just like to view gps as god's positioning system amen he's got a way to position his bride and and you know i'm sitting in the tractor natural and i'm going down the field and i can watch the deviation and it's incredible what technology is done and this will tell me i'm now three tenths of an inch off of the line to the right and then the tractor will correct itself and we'll hit a little dip in the field and it might be an inch and a half off the line on the other side but you see what's happening is it is constantly trying to come back to the center it is constantly trying to come back to the line that was designated for it to follow and that's what the word of god is doing to you and i we might drift to the right or to the left but god's got a line his word that he called you and i to follow and he's bringing us back and we can fret and go oh my goodness i kind of got off over here in a little ism don't worry about it he's bringing you back he promised that he would bring you back he promised that he would guide your feet hallelujah and so you stand on that do we care yes we should care i don't want to get off and say oh no problem god will lead me back god put something in you to desire to be right on the word hallelujah it's not a desire to be close to the word the wicked shall be silent in darkness you know that's actually a pretty big subject really when you look at that and you can tie this back my brother and sister just a quick example egypt darkness come upon the land where they could not even function it was so dark but there was light and goshen hallelujah it was a world that was in darkness it was not in goshen there was not darkness and goshen and this world my brother and sister you can just look and i don't really follow the news but you know every day i kind of click on a deal just to see what is the craziest headline you might say of the day and we got we got people that are seemingly they were smart enough to make millions of dollars but not smart enough to have common sense and you look at the world and the insanity of what is becoming the normal come on i want you to think about this why can they say what they say and you look at that and go how could they say that what are they thinking is because the world is in gross darkness you know when sister jerry and i moved into the house here well i think it's been about a month we've tried to keep it real simple but you know you're used to being oriented a certain way you get up in the middle of the night and you run into everything you stubbed your toes you catch the chester drawers in the chest you thought the doorway was in front of you my brother and sister that's gross darkness it's upon the land they don't know which way to turn they don't know what they're doing they can't find a direction that is there some say we must this and some say we must list and some say but you see because they're in gross darkness the ones with the questions there's no one with the answer but he'll keep the feet of his saints because you see my brother and sister while they are in darkness isaiah 60 verse 2 you look at that while they are in darkness my brother and sister for behold darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon who thee that's where god's at he's with these not out here in the church and i could even go further he's not here in a building my brother and sister it's just a building unless you're in it hallelujah and when you're in it you it becomes a house of god so you see it could be this almost became a daycare but god's grace we were able to buy the building so today this building that we enjoy as a house of god anointed filled with the spirit of god could have all week little children screaming unhappy parents and unhappy babysitters and all kinds of chaos which unfortunately is how i see babysitting but darkness is going to cover the earth and gross darkness the people but look how the word of god this prophecy coming forth so strongly so direct but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be near you it will be somewhere in the building no it says it would be upon thee hallelujah that's the position we claim do we not this morning it's upon me the spirit of god is upon me i'm not just going to go i'm not going to be a follower of the message i am the message [Applause] hallelujah too many people are happy to be followers you know that mex multitude left out of egypt my brother and sister they never had a hope from that moment of ever making it to the promised land they were followers and having mentioned that sometimes we in our human element get a little carried away we get caught up with spirits we get caught up with stuff but i just want to remind you all the complainers were left in the wilderness come on now i'm not i'm not trying to silence anybody so nobody misunderstood this but i'm just here just to remind you the complainers all stayed in the wilderness now i want to just follow along on this zachariah oh looks like we missed zechariah on the screen here that's fine zechariah 14 7 but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light now my brother and sister this is close enough you see he didn't come along and say it'll be on this certain day or certain time because we know human nature you and i oh i know most of you are not procrastinators but some of us are some of us are not you but people like you but you see my brother and sister what's happening is god's moving in the midst of his people and while some are just trying to nail down a certain day because really the truth of it is if they knew what day it was they could just be lax until that day but god don't want you to be locked until that day he wants you to get up every morning saying today is today the day is the day i'm going to serve god with all that's within me today is the day that i will walk and be a living testimony of jesus christ but we have this assurance that it's evening time now i want to ask you my brother and sister is there any more evidence needed according to the word of god that we're in the evening time do we need to look around and say well you know what maybe another no the prophet of god showed us clearly there's not another age amen there's not another witness as it were that's going to come upon the earth we have it we have had the word of god it has come he has been made known the seals are open the life is revealed it is in you and i we have the identification hallelujah so it's in this season that it shall be light not tomorrow not next week not next year this season right here this morning we should be able to lift a hand and say thank you lord i'm walking in the light hallelujah hallelujah and if we're not let's just not just ignore it move on let's stop and say lord what is blocking the light right for yea i walked through the valley of the shadow of death the light had to be there or there could not be a shadow so something's just between you and the light so just look and figure out what it is that's blocking the light and get that out of your life and walk in the light hallelujah not something to be afraid of amen god revealed the light you might be in the shadows right now might be in what you call dark shadows right now but god by revelation will open our eyes to look and see what the light is and move into that light now in the fourth seal brother branham excuse me i i feel pressured for time this morning you know it just well anyway look what brother brown says here on the fourth seal and when god tells you anything and says you go do this and i'll be right with it for this is my word he shows it in the bible then god stands right behind that right hallelujah everything that's in here for the bride of jesus christ you should be able to take a hold of with full confidence and march forward without looking right or left you know as i spoke to you the other day there's some things in our life you don't need to stop and pray about oh lord do lord do you want to heal me no sir stand up lord i claim my healing in the name of jesus christ lord do you want to fill me with the holy ghost no stand up i have repented i've been baptized and i fully expect to receive the holy ghost sometimes we just need to take action we get down and it's like well what should i do about this what should i do about that some things you need to pray through till you know absolutely but there's so many things that are right here in the word that god gives you direction and when he gives you direction you don't have to stop and say lord should should i do that lord should i praise your name lord should i have a prayer life should i read my bible lord i'm going to pray about should i go to church come on there's so many things are right here take a hold of it act upon it well you know no i'll tell you what that is so many people have turned to i'm praying about it as their cover i'm not doing it i know i should do it that's iniquity but i'm going to cover that i'm praying about going to church amen i'm praying about come on it's in the word act on it don't sit around with some excuse i'm i'm praying about it i'm praying about it i'm praying about it send the word do it and if it's not written in the bible god stands behind it anyhow if it's god's word see now you'll find my brother and sister that people will use that right there as a loophole we won't even cover that this morning because it could take hours just covering that of what well let me just let me just poke at that just a second it's okay just to poke that i shared with you some time back i know these people breaks my heart well praise god i woke up in the middle of the night and the lord told me to leave my wife and go marry sister so and so well it's not written in the word that's for sure but it doesn't fit in the continuity of the word either but god told me i'm sorry that wasn't god that told you that was a spirit that come masquerading as the holy spirit you see the foundation the context is not there but it was present that that was written back then this is now well i'm sorry god's word is the same yesterday today and forever and so you come now to balance this example out there'll be things that happen in your life that you won't find a direct scripture to deal with and god deals with you and says go do this go speak this but you see it will always have continuity it will never transcend the word of god even though you can't go find a scripture to back it up it will always be in continuity and if god tells you well actually there's verses forgive my analogy because there is verses to back this up but if the lord told you you go to brother so-and-so and you give him everything that's in your wallet and he spoke to you and you just walked out of the bank your whole paycheck's in your wallet i know the people that this happened to no i won't share their name walked out of the bank wallet full of cash several thousand bucks in his wallet the lord spoke to him and says go to this family give them everything that's in your wallet i can't do that lord i have a house payment i have a car payment i have groceries my kids are in private school i can't go i don't remember the exact number he had four or five thousand dollars in his wallet he felt so weird knocks on the door brother and sister opened the door god bless you brother what are you doing here the lord told me they're like they look at each other then they start smiling greedy little beggars weren't they no sir because they just got off their knees praying lord we're in a desperate situation we need you to touch our situation here's the money brother gets back in his car he's like do i call my wife do i tell her that uh we're worse than bread and water this coming month and he gets home and walks in the door and his wife's standing there in there something to share with you honey i just i don't i don't know how to tell you i don't know how to tell you remember that brother we met at those meetings and he said oh god we'll bless you one of these days soon you know that brother i'm talking about yes honey he sent us a check for sixteen thousand dollars now look get it out of your mind about the numbers it's whether or not you can step outside the word of god and just follow god god says can you do it amen oh do your due diligence come on saints do your due diligence is this in the word of god or not is this voice that spoke to me is this the word of god or not i hope you follow me oftentimes though no i i can't i can't do that i can't do that and then if it's outside of that's revealed to prophets we realize that all the mysteries of god is made known to prophets and them alone see amos 3 7. now we'll get down really to the gist of this quotation i included that other just because i thought it was interesting it was awesome now now the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer now if you say i saw something in the word i never saw before oh well there's something wrong there my brother and sister the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer for the power of wine natural wine is to stimulate see it is to bring a person that's all slumped down to a stimulation see see well then now there is power is a power of the revelation of the word gives stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction the stimulation that it's vindicated it's proved see there is a stimulating power in the word of god when you can pick up this bible and recognize yourself in the chapters and the verses and the lines you recognize that it's you that this word is talking about it's a redemptive power of this word coming directly down to you that you can do that now my brother and sister you can't sit on a pew like some old dead stump you can't sit there somewhere there's got to be a stimulation that comes into the heart of the soul now we are indifferent as humans some can jump and shout and run and others are nice and quiet but i'm telling you somewhere someway there's got to be a stimulation comes to you and you recognize hallelujah i am a son of god i'm a daughter of god and before the foundation of the world god put this all in motion you come right down to my household in eyes i as a little swaddling baby and god identified it yes it's this one oh hallelujah oh we could go off into predestination but you know what i'm talking about this morning you see there's something that stirs it it's the power of the revelation of the word and this is why the world today there's like whatever there is 30 40 000 different religions all of this stuff my brother and sister and you can go and i'm sorry when i study sometimes i look at these things and they will argue endless arguments over a word while they themselves oh i hope this don't offend no one are sitting there so far out of the word and argue whether this word should be in greek or hebrew or aramaic and was it theory or the old come on i come across the deal the other day two ministers on youtube fighting over whether or not this woman preacher is right or wrong come on if either one of them had half a lick of sense they'd be going we can't find any place in the bible for her in that office period so whether she interprets the word this way or that way is irrelevant she shouldn't even be there interpreting it so you see that's what happens when you walk in darkness you think you're going out to the kitchen you end up in the closet now look at this stimulated now i want to just kind of catch this you know brother branham used this example about uh a wine here now my brother and sister this example of using wine here is to stimulate see to bring a person that's all slumped down to a stimulation we got people around the churches that are upright until they get to the wine and when it's all done they're slumped down they got a wrong revelation about that a little wine is good for the belly's sake well i'll just back up on that excuse me i didn't mean to bring that up in public it may be lawful but the word says it may not be expedient we saw this i won't name the country but sister jerry and i have witnessed this we witnessed a stimulation doctrine come amongst a group of people and it all started off with a little sip here and a little sip there and pretty soon it made it to the kitchen table pretty soon it made it to recreation and pretty soon i felt compelled and i'm not boasting on paul don't misunderstand me but i felt compelled to tell the interpreter that i was dealing with i will never ever ever preach with you again until you find deliverance from this but our pastor doesn't mind i don't care what your pastor minds you look like the world every little picture starting to show up on social media there's a wine bottle in the background and crystal and the table sat and pictures of them sipping swirling it do i got that right i wouldn't know you see my brother and sister this stimulation we're looking for is not in this carnal realm it is the power of god and if we get oh i'm going to take a hard line if any of you are drinking wine i'm telling you this is where i stand as a pastor my brother and sister if you get to the place you need a stimulation of wine to exist in this world you are backslid go find you an altar somewhere get down and pray because we've been provided with the greatest stimulation that was ever given to mankind and that is the revelation of the holy ghost god in you we don't need some carnal stimulation hallelujah amen that becomes a crotch that the devil throws out and then justifies hallelujah that wasn't in my sermon so we get that one for free today but you see to be stimulated my brother and sister we're not looking for a superficial stimulation we're not looking for an action that just gets it for the moment otherwise you know what that was one of the things as a young man that i i got i was caught up in you know they used different words for it but i was an adrenaline junkie you know i i that's why i love to ride a dirt bike is because it was you know literally just this one constant you know ride in the desert was one constant drill and rush to the next during the rest of the next adrenaline rush and and it's cool if you've ever done it you would say well that is that is really fun brother paul but i'm telling you my brother and sister it comes so dominant in my life god had to deliver me from that so to go out and ride through the woods or do or whatever it might be see that's fine but whenever you become over dependent on something god will remember we're getting back to god's positioning and god will take that from your life because you then have another god before you and god says i won't allow no other god god doesn't come and say oh they got another god before him i'm throwing them out no god repositions you brings you down to where it's him and him alone hallelujah and so this is the action that the word is taking bringing us moving stimulating us to a place you see it's not superficial just uh makes it skin deep my brother and sister it's not intellectual amen there are those amongst us that are very intelligent very very intelligent you can't stop and say well they they can't have the revelation of jesus christ they're super smart no my brother and sister the revelation is not intellectual doesn't mean the man cannot have a great iq and and whatever else but my brother and sister the revelation that satan wants to give to the people is an intellectual intellectual come on can i drive that home intellectual revelation of the word of god for our hour but my brother and sister it is not intellectual intellect will not hold you it never got the uh amen i said it almost it never got the three musketeers i almost said that never got shadrach means meshach and abednego out of the fire intellectualism never got him out of that fire but faith in the world did amen now look what this word's doing my brother and sister by the washing of the water of the word we're being stimulated to revelation the words preached something clicks i've never heard it preached that way before lord is that correct the lord promised he would reveal himself to you so the word being preached and you say lord is that correct reminds me first time i heard a brother preach on the third pole i look back on this with great humor right because we were probably amongst the most superficial of message believers there was coming out of the church we came out of i remember a brother got up and he preached a sermon tied it all together of the third pole and i remember sitting there going what is he talking about i've never heard that preached in my life what is he talking about and just my own personal shorthand you know how you all know how to take notes and understand your own notes or maybe you understand your notes after you wrote them i made a little note third pull a circle with a check in the middle of it and to me that was check this out you know before i had a chance to check it out the very next message i was in brother brown's talking about the third pole and then another third pole and then the third pole and the third pole on the third point you see that's how revelation is coming in the church my brother and sister you might have a brother he comes and he preaches from a certain direction of something he's been studying and it comes and you say i've never heard that before don't just chunk that thing out ask god to reveal it is it true or not god said i will guide your footsteps i will keep your steps i will take care of you and so there that's how revelations being opened in the word and we come and we take a holds of that and as that stimulates us we start to do what we start to dig into the word deeper when i heard that brother preach on the third poll you know that's been i don't know probably 30 years ago but when i heard him preach on that you see there was something there i didn't just throw it out like that i'm never listening to that guy again i like that preacher i liked how he brought things and you know i want to do that but you see i prayed the little prayer god if this is real reveal it to me and so god come and before i even had a chance to become a a a i'm not a great student you know but to sit down and try and figure this out and those of you remember the old eagle program it wasn't the easiest to use and not every quote on something would come up you know so it would be easy to type something in and push it and say see it's not there but then you push play over here and hear the prophet's voice and there it is stimulation of revelation was it due you have a choice saints when god speaks the word to you you've got a choice to dig into it or to toss it out but if it's false i don't want to have gotten involved with it if it's false and you're a son or daughter of god you can't be deceived by it how many people sit in churches today have heard the open word preached and said i've never heard that before and they tossed it out right come on saints we're coming down to the time you either believe that the word of god will not let you be deceived or is if it were possible means something else besides what i understand see you're simulated to revelation and related to an action now my brother and sister look at this persuasion is not a substitute for revelation this is somebody can explain to you take a chart take a a deal start drawing lines and tying scriptures together and put in a quote here and do all of this and you go okay i see how that is that's not revelation revelations when it's made alive to you and it becomes a living part of you the living word amen otherwise it is just an intellectual understanding hallelujah but whenever it comes and revelation comes to you now look here in luke 4 i mean luke 6 and 48 amen what happens when you have revelation my brother and sister you come here he is like a man which built a house and digged deep he didn't scratch the surface to build his relationship with god on he dug deep and he dug all the way down until he got to the rock hallelujah anybody can scratch a little trench in the sand and pour a little concrete in it praise the lord god sent a prophet good you're scratching sand that's because the prophet of god said i came here to introduce you to jesus christ so that means that you might come to your place in your life that god anoints you by revelation to start digging and you start digging and you sweat and you get now pardon me pardon me some of you will some of you won't but i'm just gonna say it this way most of you can't handle a shovel for eight hours you end up with hands like this i don't mean that as an insult take it spiritually scratch the sand okay that's good enough for me or by revelation the prophet said there's a rock here somewhere and i'm going to keep digging till i get to that rock and you dig when you're tired you dig when you're sad you dig when you're happy and you dig when you're glad but you will not stop digging till you get to that rock and then when you get to that rock you can stop and say praise the lord this word of god is true this message is true this life is real and i believe it and you start building your house from there and then no matter what comes whether it's somebody on youtube somebody on the radio somebody here or somebody there or some circumstance of life no matter what comes you can say that's all right i dug down to the rock and i built upon the rock i didn't build on men's idea i didn't build on a man's revelation i built on the very word of jesus christ and this house will stand hallelujah that's the kind of action we need you just keep digging young people dig till you get to the rock all people dig till you get to the rock hallelujah that house will stand people say well i don't know does it really matter well i'll tell you i think it really matters not even for just eternal security as it were you know for eterna uh eternal life but my brother and sister i know a man and sorry to put it this way kind of a direct deal i know a man i guess you would say he's a friend of mine and you know and after he went through his third wife his third marriage and everything was a wreck he woke up one day and he had courage enough to say you know what paul i figured out that the women the wives they weren't the problem i was the problem oh my brother and sister are we going to get to the place that we recognize i am the problem it's not the pastor of the church it's not a song leader a piano player this family that family that family i am the problem and when we can grasp a host of that you're getting pretty close to the rock because the rock brings us the prophet of god says the rock brings us to humility it doesn't bring us to arrogance it doesn't bring us high and mighty it actually humbles us down when we get to the rock oh thank you lord this is the kind of action we need to have amen hallelujah see not some shallow feeble attempt pardon me for putting it this way but not a sandbox experience now i've got a quote just in case anybody kind of wonders where i'd pull this from now it was all the way back from 53 and to people who like to use the calendar to dictate whether it was revelation or not this might be too old for you i'm not making fun of that there's a lot of people if it don't fit right here it's not real revelation well you go ahead and fit it on the calendar i'll tell you if it fits right here it's real revelation i don't need a calendar to tell me whether it was revelation or not making the valley full of ditches now as i tell you all the time saints go back read the whole context people don't like that term they like to use it derogatory you cherry pick that yes i did otherwise we'd be here for several hours because i got quotes out of three or four different sermons and we had to go from beginning to end we might be having our fellowship about 10 o'clock tonight i give you the resource you do your homework if i took it out of context or used it ungainly for the point then you are more than welcome to come and say you use that incorrectly trouble of it is you go to digging first thing you know you stick your shovel down and say pay 10 he's talking about tithe oh oh can't do that you don't get much water you know i had a brother he never preached it i often wondered why i think he thought maybe it actually was a little too strong of a pill he said i felt like preaching a service brother paul where i called on each husband each brother and cause them to show what they have and what they give and the correlation of the blessing involved then i got to thinking about it and he thought as a visitor that's probably not a good idea but my brother and sister the scripture says amen the scripture says oh can't do that you don't get much water the next you god if you'll just keep on digging brother come on keep on digging brother that's what i'm here for this morning saints keep on digging brother keep on digging dig them old doubts out them old dish pans and rocks and stones and things like that dig deep enough to throw it mostly out oh dig deep enough to throw it all out get enough water flowing there so you can get a good decent drink once in a while what's the matter tonight you got to dig away from your church you know i might as well just go for broke today you know the very thing where the prophet of god talked about people standing up and saying are you a christian no i'm a baptist i'm now serene you know that's invaded us i go to this church this brother is my pastor who is your pastor well you ain't never heard of him dig away from your church we didn't come here to be identified by our pastor dig away from this dig away from that dig into christ jesus there's the whole point now look my brother and sister don't misunderstand me we have brother didier here today there's nothing wrong with the saints of his church which i know love him very much identifying brother didier is our pastor and we are happy about that but here it is i believe well let me just maybe not worth quite as much confidence i i believe you guys love me and it's okay to be identified brother paul's our pastor but you see my brother and sister this message is not about the pastor the message is about jesus christ and the word revealed in you and i and god ordained through the word of god to use our brother to use ministry to bring the word out to you and i but remember god will not let another be before him so many people are like our heart is broken our pastor fell well the reason he fell is you put him on top of this pinnacle where there's no oxygen up there and he fell off for lack of oxygen so whose fault is that if the people had said i love my pastor i love how he preaches a word but you know sometimes i don't agree with him i think he ought to use a fork and he eats with his mouth open and he you can do all of that but honor the office honor the man in the office my brother and sister and you will come and find god will bless you for that and the channel is open and the word of god can be preached with liberty and you can walk out knowing that it was god that spoke to you and you can walk out knowing that god put that man in the pulpit and he was there because that was the right man for your life for your family for the word to be open to you in the way you understood it but it had to be god the action behind all of it has to be god so what are we going to do we got to dig away from our church we got to dig away from this and dig away from that and dig into christ and when we get dug into christ my brother and sister then we are on the right track then we're on the right point then we're guided by the word of god hallelujah not a man hallelujah i'm telling you this revelation of this hour is not a feeble little revelation this is not a look i signed my name on the book kind of revelation this is god himself coming down scrubbing you inside and out and pouring himself into you hallelujah that's the kind of revelation i want hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now look i know that research says you shouldn't read a lot because people lose attention but i'll just do my best to keep this now look i tell you my brother and sister i just was studying and felt very inspired in this it's quite lengthy but i think it's a sum total of what we're trying to say today let me show you another reason why satan hates this book of revelation of jesus christ in the church he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and change is not i'll tell you what i think i think i just heard my shovel hit on the rock hallelujah he knows a whole lot more than 90 percent of the message preachers oh excuse me that might have been my note whole lot more than 90 percent of theologians he knows that since god is immutable in his nature then he's just as immutable in his ways thus satan knows assuredly that the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action now let's look at this my brother and sister mark 16 in action oh is the true church that jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be now look at this mark 16 when we study it is a recollection of eyewitness report go read it that way don't just run through it my brother and sister mark 16 brings it down very carefully we saw jesus this morning amen that's it he's risen no you didn't where'd you get this crazy idea how do you think you saw jesus go read it two were walking in the way and he comes and he walks with them and when revelation strikes them this is the christ right here in our presence he disappears from them what did they do went home said we'll sleep on it no sir they turned right around and beat feet right back to the city and went right back to the city and told them we saw the christ and what did they do no you never we don't believe that come on saints there's more to mark 16 than just taking up serpents and drinking things and whatever there's a lot more to this you see what it was is he was there in their presence and they couldn't get enough faith in them to believe that his word had actually come to pass but he told them this is what's going to happen he'd already revealed the word to them of what was going to happen and while it's happening they can't find enough faith to believe it now i'm going to tell you we've been told what's going to happen and we are seeing it happen and it is coming to pass right in our presence and people don't have enough faith to believe that god is in them they got enough faith to believe that god is present in the church that he's present in the bride that the word is unfolded that the mystery of jesus christ is open they don't have enough faith to believe that but yet it has been spoken it's a true church that jesus claims this is oats all else is false claims as his own all else is false has to be now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts now brother and sister i've heard it spoke this way i hope you just give me a little grace in making this representation i heard a brother one time say the book of actions because you look in the book of acts and there's all kinds of things happening you do not open the book of acts and find some people sitting in a church singing three songs meditating for a few minutes getting up and walking out to come back on wednesday and do it again to come back on sunday to do it again to come back on wednesday to do it again come back on sunday to do it again it was a book of action they believe the word of god they spoke the word of god they claimed the word of god and the word of god came to pass a book of action my brother and sister and the prophet of god says right here i hope you'll give me grace on that example and the prophet of god says right here this is a continuation of the book of those actions it's going to be present in our day it's going to be alive in our day and he promised to be here in our day hallelujah not hey we believe a message oh everything's good my brother and sister a book of actions but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless don't feel bad it was right there when they come back and said we just saw christ no you never he was walking with me who do you think you are he talked to us god don't do that anymore oh you think those spirits are dead those spirits are alive i'll tell you you probably upset somebody but when people say you're only going to hear from god if you listen to a tape are defying the written word of god they've got it in their mind that it's got to be this way because we're going to eliminate the preachers i'll show you where god put it in the word of god you showed me where he took it out yeah that's right come on why because they don't want a living god in their midst with action because that living god's going to walk into and oh and i know we're all susceptible to these things i'm not preaching against you but we don't want the word coming into our video library we don't want the word coming into our music library we don't want the word coming into our closet and we don't want the word censoring our language come on right so antichrist spirit would come into the church defile it making it lukewarm and for formal and powerless oh my let me just go back to mark 16 for just a moment mark 16 10 she went and she told him she'd been with him they're mourning and weeping she's there to tell him i've been with him can we this morning saints are you that one are you the one i asked you this morning are you that one i've been with him i've been with him he's been in my house he's been in my bedroom he's been in my car he's in my heart he's in my mind i've been with him sorry that's right amen praise god who do you think you are who do you think you are come on saints the spirit's not dead that spirit's still living and he appeared in another form unto them too as they walked and went into the country they went and told it into the residue neither believe they them come on don't look at me like i'm sensational this morning but i've been walking with him i've been walking with him it's only by his grace but i'm walking with him hey man i'm not sitting down i'm not just waiting for him to do something i've been walking with him [Music] hallelujah well you're the most unlikely person that god would reveal himself i know i don't understand it either but he has been walking with me hallelujah look my brother and sister and when he meets them oh my forgive me no holds barred this morning some people believe that when brother brother comes back there's going to be a big tent and it's going to be clear full had a brother one time tell me he says bro paul if that's true he says i'm poor and i live in south america i could never i could never go there i said don't worry about it brother just pray god will make a way and don't worry about a seat because after the first couple nights the tent's gonna be mostly empty well come on you say why do you say that brother paul because he met them right here and he said he upgraded them our prophet the kind old grandfather is going to rip the hide off of us oh don't think i believe he's coming back i'm making a point to you he can't be anything but the word here you guys have watered it down the church is all cold and formal but praise god you believe my message no sir if we believed his message we'd acted on it and our church won't be cold and it won't be formal and it won't be filled with all kinds of garbage it will be swept out and the fire will be burning and there will be sons and daughters of god that will be testifying of the power of god and how he's still moving in me and my wife and my children and their children will be saying i saw god moving me my mama and my daddy come on saints you see satan's very clever he's come right here and he's moving into the church and he's trying to make it lukewarm and there'll be one thing that stands before the church being lukewarm and that's the holy ghost we can agree with that can't we but you know what it will be the holy ghost in you come on it's not just the holy ghost my brother and sister if we all compromise then we are a compromised church it will be the holy ghost in you that stands up and says i want the pure word of god i don't want some other kind of garbage don't be taking my milk and watering it down don't make my pepsi and water it down amen you wouldn't drink that in the natural come on i know these are poor analogies forgive me for that but it's the word of god and people sitting back watching it watered down and saying well i think i understood what he did and it sure is nice our church is growing it is it's growing lukewarm formal and powerless am i preaching too hard this morning hallelujah amen hallelujah see this is the church it was called action what does it do my brother and sister sometimes you know i have that little complex you all know it i apologize for things i shouldn't apologize for i should tear the height off even harder and i'm apologizing i'm sorry i apologize for apologizing but look what the word of god says the prophet says it exposes satan now satan the biggest chameleon there is knows how to hide in every way knows how to just do everything just right knows the right language they're not right dress the right dis all this stuff he knows it just right but it still exposes it revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people that ought to get you now when i use these words i don't mean it in the flesh like we would normally but that ought to make you mad the fact that satan wants to destroy you ought to make you mad you ought to stand up and say you know what i've had enough of that devil you're not going to tear me down you're not going to ruin my marriage you're not going to ruin my family i will not put up with it right the word of god says and i'm victorious the word of god says i'm an overcomer the word of god says i have the token over my household and satan no more [Applause] but we'll have an obama line oh i shouldn't have said that forgive me but if you just look back through history you'll understand what the term obama line was that's when he went out and he told the world i'm sorry i have to draw this line and if you don't like that line i'll draw this one and if that was still offensive i'll draw this one no sorry there's got to be some preachers not right brother did he got to be some preachers are going to stand up and say this is a line it's always been the line and we're not moving it for nobody and the devil or even the most favorite deal the biggest tithe pair in our church the line don't move [Applause] yeah destruction god's people discrediting god's word right down to the time he he's cast in the lake of fire imagine how the devil knowing he's going the lake of fire right he's read the book how he's going to still exalt in the fact that even as he's being tossed in the lake of fire he takes one last one with him well i'll tell you what brother ron spencer preached down louisiana sermon take it back amen he's talking about the promises of god concerning you your family your salvation well i'm here my brother and sister to tell you today give it back when the devil says that you're a loser and not worthy just give it back to him when he says you can't just give it back to him because you know what the devil ain't making it to heaven but the blood oh hallelujah the blood on this old mortal flesh that we labor over and we pamper and we do all of this it's the blood my brother and sister that takes us hallelujah it's not us remember the scripture says not by strength not by strength i need to hurry up and close out here he knows that if the people get the revelation of the true church what she is come on we have a revelation i hope today of what we are amen of what she is and what she stands for oh come on my brother and sister that stand for let's take that into a physical realm you got to stand up for what's right you can't sit down you can't lay down you can't sleep on it you've got to stand up and say i want the word of god and nothing else if i have to move plum across the country to get the true word of god i will go it is not i'll pray about it and i'll move my children to the wilderness and pray that somehow they survive and meet a godly man or a godly woman and get married and live happily ever after well i had a man sit there and tell me one time praise the lord i'm moving my family out here in the sticks to get him away from all this worldly stuff you know his kids almost to the one have backslid because it's not flesh and blood amen it's not addressed if they get a true revelation true church what she is what she stands for and that she oh oh oh think the prophet of god just accidentally said these words in this way oh it can't be because if he did he made a lot more accidents of the way he said things that she can do you know what that is action action she's got a revelation of what i'm gonna do i'm not gonna sit back and say oh i praise the lord i hope it all works out she's gonna do the greater work she's gonna stand up and say the bible said do it i'm gonna do it amen the holy ghost moved me to do it i'm gonna do it hallelujah she can do the greater works she will be a invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her you know what my brother and sister i hope this doesn't hurt any of his feelings but the reason that we're not got satan in a powerless position is we haven't dug all the tin cans and all of the garbage out of our foundation yet we tried to build the house before we had the foundation solidify you know those of you know anything about construction there are always constantly trying to reinvent the house i just watched a video this company's actually persevered to be successful in their concept and that is while they've got a crew over here framing the floor they've got a crew already framing walls they've got a crew over here framing the roof and they've got their little process by which they tie all the trusses together sheet it even the fascia board on it they have these huge brackets they have a design where they leave several sheets out they reach down in there put these uh almost like forklift forks under it lift the roof up and set it on the house shortens the building of the house considerably hardly anyone has to really get up on the roof and do that really cool isn't it except for the very first house they did that way they lifted the roof on and it didn't fit we have a problem i mean most of you would like to be able to go in your bedroom and just reach out and see how cold it is see my brother and sister that why that way that's why god's got this process that he he's building and he said what i need you to do is i need you to take the action to dig and dig and dig and i'm tired of digging dig come on i'm digging prophet said sometimes he's not building a wall he's building a house so we come we've got to make the corner and dig and dig for time i'll mine my own business here they get a revelation see it's not persuasion it's not teaching that there's two spirits in the framework of this church it's a revelation then my brother and sister they can start withstanding it's only after you have it all in place that you can start to withstand you see this is why we have people who have actually literally i've got friends it breaks my heart i've got friends they gave 30 years of their life following the message and got up one day and walked away you see they run into the perfect storm go back study the scriptures when the rains fell this house never fell because it was built on the rock this house right here from the very beginning of the storm it started to wash under the foundation and then that storm was over but the foundation was never done right so it never changed another storm comes and washes a little more but this foundation that you were anointed to dig can you say amen to that i was anointed it wasn't me i i didn't have the energy i didn't have the ability i didn't have the understanding i was anointed to just keep digging until i got to the place that i realized this is what it's all about here's the rock oh we could say look i built my house on the rock but my brother and sister without the holy ghost anointing you you would have never persevered to dig that deep some people are like you believe god sent a prophet oh that's ridiculous you know what they did they took one shovel full of sand threw it away and built a house they didn't persevere to dig or they would figure it out okay let me hurry on i'm starting to get hungry amen when this happens see satan will be powerless before you'll be definitely thwarted today is when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation oh hallelujah can somebody agree with those next words but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen it's not our understanding it's not our intellect it's because we have followed the word and what the word said do we did it and when satan comes in like a storm i love that it's sad brother trevor's not here this morning brother trevor you know got up that day and he says you know saints you know it's just the devil comes in i got i got all nervous i got all nervous you remember that sunday when brother trevor was praying over the request and he got up here and goes you know you know there's just times the devil just comes in and like a flood and i'm like oh debbie downer but god raises up his standard and then he went right back in that voice and then the devil comes right back in but god raises up his standard but then the devil comes right back in but god raises up a standard hallelujah i love you guys maybe i read more into this than you did i'm telling you and he repeated that about five times you know the devil comes but god raised up standard amen it don't matter my brother or sister how many times the devil comes the standard is still being raised and you are the standard the word in you is the standard of this age well praise the lord it's in the bible they don't need you well i'm sorry it's just written words if it's in the bible but our bible is a living bible it's a living word it's alive it's going to have someone to live in it's living in you and i today oh hallelujah with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them now look i'm getting really close here to quitting sister emmy will you come you'll recall that i mentioned at the beginning of this message that the book we are studying is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages my brother and sister we are the future ages you realize my brother and sister that this word has been stored up and the doors of the storehouse have been unlocked amen it is not some time in the future that we're going to access this storehouse some people act like whoa no we got to keep this for another day my brother and sister eat to your hearts content don't stop until you are satisfied because he said that he would quench your hunger he would satisfy you he said he would do this for you and i and you take a hold of that word and you just keep eating on it keep eating on it keep eating on it and i don't care how you feel i don't care how you feel i don't feel like praying pray anyhow i don't feel like reading my bible read it anyhow i don't feel like going to church go to church anyhow oh hallelujah excuse me for getting excited today then i mentioned oh this is the future age sure oh my brother and sister this is a future age then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it come on i've said some direct things today i'll try and finish on this one that's why we have people right around our belief system have no revelation that's not my word saints it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we'll fail to get it intellectualism [Music] i met a brother one time pardon me for sharing this but i just want to drive it home to you i met her brother one time me dumb as a rock i'm not tearing myself down i'm just i'm just some average old guy maybe a notch or two below average [Music] i mean i passed most of my classes in high school if you want to understand i passed him you can still pass with a d-minus [Music] and you start to speak quote this man would just gone of this ebill age page 22 paragraph 351 i'm like okay but don't you dare disagree with that man don't you dare disagree with a man or he just rip you up i'll tell you what saints i'd rather be as dumb as a rock and god in control of my life be so intellectual that i can tell you this that and the other and not have his spirit amen it's not about what we know it's about knowing him it's all about that relationship and i mentioned it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take an operation of the holy ghost could somebody lift a hand and say lord come and operate in our midst come today lord and operate in our life in our midst lord change us change us lord mold this into your image father now some people would say this is arrogant in fact i could get you the quotation it's right on on a recording where a man says that we're just arrogant means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people i never drew the lines on that that's right come on saints don't go drawing the lines don't go saying i think they're out and you're in no sir don't draw the lines just recognize the fact that you can believe and this word is real to you and you hunger after this word that this word stimulates you and you read something and you get excited i tell you there's many a time not to sound boastful but my wife will come busting out there paul you've got to read this and there'll be days i know she'll be listening a certain sermon i know because my phone all day long goes ding ding ding ding ding quotes out of that message what is it stimulation she's not doing it to prove some point she's like look look look what it says praise the lord look at this oh i want to live in that kind of inspiration she does that partly because she knows i'm out there with my lip hanging down because i preached yesterday this ought to encourage you this ought to encourage you pretty soon please don't send me any more text my phone's going ding ding ding and the battery's almost dead it's going to take operation of the holy ghost i mean this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people hallelujah i thank the lord today we can claim to be a special class of people amen we were designed we were built we were our operating system was programmed in such a fashion that when we hear the word the word in you says hallelujah that's a part of me i'm a part of it praise the lord it will take one with prophetic insight it require the ability to hear from god wait everybody in christendom hears from god don't they [Music] it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves hope we're back to another action look at this god's put another quantifier here another quantifier saints we need to hear from god and we need to lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know amen oh hallelujah you say brother paul that's what we're doing that's right i was just here to stir up your pure minds today every one of you already know that's good but don't you love it i didn't i don't think i hit any of you with my stir stick did i come on it's not many how many quotes you know it's not what continent you live on it's whether or not you know him it is right and if you know him you can live in poverty or you can live in riches and it won't matter if you know him you'll never find yourself with an arrogant spirit but you're reminded daily that i am nothing without christ hallelujah god bless you i kept you a long time today saints and hopefully the food hasn't burnt but if it has somebody will buy you takeout hallelujah let's just stand worship the lord for just a minute or two before we go under direct today's saints i just felt that not to beat around the bush but you see this is the day that it's come for the bride to take action we're not here to sit around now and debate it we're not here to sit around and say well i see it this way and i see it that way what we're here is to say lord show me how you see it i want to see it just like you see it lord amen that's the unity my brother and sister that some people are trying to do by gathering together and having single thought longs and sing-a-thons and and do all these things that we because we need to have unity but the prophet of god said that the unity is in the word of god so i say we are here today in the spirit of unity because i believe we're here today in the word of god where we're desiring the word we want the word give me the word all i want is the word you know i like that you go in a restaurant you sit down and they say okay what do you want well i want this and i want that would you like onions no would you like mushrooms would you like this would you like that no no no no no no i don't need anything that distracts me from that big old piece of steak don't need any distraction you see the devil's going to come along my brother and sister and we can say you know where is this in the church and where is this in the church and what's happening over here that church does this but this our church don't do that good good god put certain gifts i was joking about this sean i hope you don't mind to use your example you see sean comes out works around the house for us [Music] does things things we wouldn't get done and he works with a very high degree of enthusiasm [Music] i mean it never makes it to its face i'm not picking on you sean i'm actually going to give you a compliment but you put a guitar in his hand and he's sitting there and it reaches all the way through him from the tips of his toes to the top of his head and he's there and he's just flirting i'll leave it that way he's flirting with his guitar he's happy and i would be just the opposite give me a shovel i'm good with this give me a guitar i don't know what to do with this thing you see we're all made different we're not another church saints we're grace tabernacle we're not over here we don't have 200 300 400 500 problems i mean people we're grace but we are sons and daughters of
