[49:31] if you ever come to the place in your
[49:33] life that a day a week a month feels
[49:37] like a
[49:38] tornado but in those times right there
[49:40] we need a savior we don't need religion
[49:44] we don't need a place to go we don't
[49:45] need a beautiful choir what we need is
[49:49] our Lord Jesus amen to come and comfort
[49:53] us and just put his arms around us and
[49:56] [Music]
[49:58] love
[49:58] us

[50:06] me this morning got some decisions some
[50:08] things happening in his life and uh just
[50:11] sends greetings to your church says he
[50:14] loves you and I believe him and um he uh
[50:18] just ask for prayer for the Lord to just
[50:20] give him wisdom on on what direction in
[50:23] his life so let's be faithful remember
[50:27] uh our brother manasse in prayer and um
[50:31] I don't think she's maybe still in the
[50:33] sanctuary but brother Gideon's friend
[50:35] Lily um many of you would have saw what
[50:38] we posted the other day um please be in
[50:42] prayer I'm believing God's going to
[50:44] change her life and Lily if you can hear
[50:48] me and no doubt you
[50:50] can amen we're believing God's going to
[50:53] change your spiritual life amen those
[50:56] things that you spoke the other night
[50:58] that made the devil mad amen I believe
[51:01] God will bring them to pass the hunger
[51:03] in your heart The Emptiness that's there
[51:05] I believe he'll feel that and we want to
[51:08] bind that Spirit of epilepsy it's
[51:11] nothing but a
[51:12] demon and we want that demon bound and
[51:16] put back where he belongs let's pray for
[51:19] that let's hold that up amen and uh so I
[51:25] think Lily's already figured out that
[51:27] I'm a little bit forward but um the
[51:30] thing is is she's also a little forward
[51:32] so maybe she'll understand that amen
[51:35] please pray for us we'll be in Florida
[51:38] uh not a vacation but not overly worked
[51:42] um uh brother Danny has asked us to
[51:46] minister Wednesday night and uh Sunday

[51:52] case any of you are actually feeling
[51:54] like that we're just going to have a

[52:20] speaking of direct sister Dorcas I've
[52:23] been praying for you amen I've been
[52:29] amen it's interesting how God
[52:32] works sister Dorcas I want you to
[52:35] understand this God has valued my
[52:38] prayers for you more than he has valued
[52:41] my
[52:42] sleep and I say thank you Lord to wake
[52:46] up in the middle of the night you cannot
[52:49] sleep and God just lay individuals on
[52:53] your heart and be able to just enter in
[52:56] for them
[52:57] and um I I just say God bless you we're
[53:00] lifting you up amen each and every one
[53:03] of you I I I you know just kind of have

[53:11] down every Pew and pray for you where I
[53:14] remember you sitting
[53:16] amen so let's turn in our
[53:19] Bibles this morning a little bit
[53:22] different scripture maybe I hope you can
[53:24] catch our Anchor Point but r Romans the
[53:27] 3r chapter veres
[53:30] 1-4 some of the things that brother
[53:32] Isaac voiced right here resignate with
[53:34] me out of these scriptures right
[53:37] here and
[53:39] um we just Saints Lily's in the back
[53:44] room showing the
[53:45] signs of those little seizure type
[53:49] things right at this moment let's bow
[53:51] our
[53:52] heads Heavenly Father we come before you
[53:55] we know that Satan is mad because Lily
[53:59] is in the house of God this morning but
[54:02] father we are here knowing that the
[54:04] Great I Am the deliverer Our Savior our
[54:06] healer is here this morning and father
[54:09] we're asking you now just to go in touch
[54:11] Lily Lord Jesus bind that Spirit father
[54:15] that would try to cast its spell upon
[54:18] her Satan you are bound in the name of
[54:21] Jesus Christ it is not by our ability
[54:24] it's not by our power but it's by
[54:26] authority of the word of God that is in
[54:29] us that we speak Satan depart this
[54:32] morning in the name of Jesus Christ Lord
[54:35] we'd ask that your holy spirit will just
[54:37] move right down touch our sister Lily
[54:40] father just touch it father right down
[54:42] into her physical body Lord whatever it
[54:45] might be that's there in the brain that
[54:47] short circuits to cause these seizures
[54:49] we bind that in the name of Jesus Christ
[54:52] and we're asking for your Holy Spirit to
[54:53] come put these things back to their Norm
[54:56] noral rightful and god-given position
[54:59] that she can come forth and live life as
[55:01] you called for her to live Lord we ask
[55:04] you in the name of Jesus Christ now may
[55:07] the word the presence of your Holy
[55:09] Spirit Come and change this situation
[55:12] even as we pray in your precious name
[55:16] amen
[55:19] hallelujah
[55:21] amen the prophet told us Satan has his
[55:24] punch that he G gets but my brother and
[55:28] sister we do not have to sit here and
[55:30] accept his
[55:32] verdict it is the word of God it is
[55:35] Christ in you and I it is the word that
[55:37] is standing here this morning can we say
[55:40] Amen to that we are the word standing
[55:43] here this morning and Satan will attack
[55:46] the word every opportunity he gets but
[55:48] he will not defeat the word amen I say
[55:53] thank you Lord and we're just sending
[55:54] the Holy Spirit right there to the
[55:57] forier that God would touch her
[56:01] amen Romans the 3rd chapter:
[56:04] 1-4 what advantage then hath the Jew or
[56:08] what profit is there in of
[56:11] circumcision much every way chiefly
[56:14] because that unto them that were
[56:16] committed the Oracles of God for what if
[56:19] some did not
[56:21] believe shall their unbelief make the
[56:24] faith of God without
[56:28] effect under the circumstances we have
[56:31] right here this morning my brother and
[56:33] sister unbelief will not make the word
[56:36] of God without
[56:39] effect God forbid yay let God be true
[56:43] but every man a liar but is as it is
[56:46] written that thou mightest be justified
[56:49] in thy sayings and mightest overcome
[56:52] when thou art
[56:53] judged amen Lord just bless this time we
[56:56] ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ
[56:59] amen you may be
[57:02] seated we look in the world we live in
[57:05] today
[57:06] Saints unbelief is all around
[57:13] us just to those of you might not have
[57:16] seen it but those that did maybe to
[57:18] bring but you know isn't it interesting
[57:21] that our own
[57:22] government and all the inaugural and all
[57:25] of these days of prayer and all this
[57:27] stuff actually chooses someone a woman
[57:30] Minister that gets up and everything
[57:33] that she portrays everything that she
[57:35] believes everything that she speaks out
[57:38] is contrary to the word of God and yet
[57:40] they would say we have chosen a minister
[57:42] of God to speak and to bring forth and I
[57:46] think it is very very evident as it is
[57:48] in this day that we live in that the
[57:51] very fabric of our nation is unbelief
[57:54] there is nothing there now you'd say
[57:56] well they believe in God brother Paul
[57:58] but my brother and sister the devil
[58:00] believes in God it's something more than
[58:03] just believing God exist amen and this
[58:06] might be a little blunt a little direct
[58:07] it's more than just believing God sent a
[58:10] prophet amen you have to have the
[58:12] evidence of the message of the hour in
[58:15] your life or we're missing it amen and
[58:18] so as you look at this we see this
[58:20] unbelief and in the world we live in
[58:23] today I'm going to just be blunt today
[58:25] hope you don't mind so many people have
[58:27] stepped away from the message because
[58:29] someone they respect said nope this
[58:32] isn't so but it tells you this is what
[58:34] it tells you my brother and sister they
[58:36] never had a personal experience their
[58:39] self because if you have a personal
[58:41] experience now this sound a little rude
[58:43] forgive me but if I have a personal
[58:45] experience let me turn it around I'm
[58:46] going to give you the positive side if
[58:48] you have a personal experience there's
[58:50] nothing negative I can say that will
[58:53] turn you around but with without that
[58:56] personal experience then we look to
[58:59] people and become respector of persons
[59:01] and we say well they say it's not true
[59:04] so I guess it's not true my brother and
[59:06] sister we're supposed to have enough of
[59:08] the word of God in us to rightly divide
[59:11] and discern the word of God and so as
[59:14] you look at this when we get this
[59:15] relationship with the lord the devil can
[59:18] come he can whisper in your ear just as
[59:20] much as he wants to whisper in your ear
[59:23] because if you are sealed then my
[59:25] brother and sister his words are not
[59:28] coming or penetrating into your life his
[59:31] unbelief will not affect you in fact it
[59:34] shouldn't make us arrogant but we should
[59:36] be in a place in our life we could
[59:38] remind the devil I have words that
[59:40] declare where you are going and I have
[59:43] words that declare where I am going amen
[59:46] so your words don't apply to me and
[59:49] obviously the word to me does not apply
[59:52] to you and the prophet of God you know
[59:54] the quote said you know if you're under
[59:56] the blood if Satan could come in there
[59:58] I'm paraphrasing could come in there to
[1:00:00] you when you're under the blood he would
[1:00:03] be your brother that's how powerful this
[1:00:05] Blood this message this word is in this
[1:00:08] hour if Satan penetrates into your world
[1:00:12] and you were under the the Covenant
[1:00:14] under the word under that my brother and
[1:00:17] sister it'll have the same impact on him
[1:00:20] that's right oh my brother and sister
[1:00:22] let us be hid in Christ amen not just
[1:00:26] close not to say we are
[1:00:28] friends but to be hid in him amen people
[1:00:34] can say what they want but it's always
[1:00:35] the action that tells the story is that
[1:00:37] not true amen it's the action that tells
[1:00:41] the truth amen and their unbelief will
[1:00:44] only affect you if you open the door
[1:00:47] that's right amen if you do not accept
[1:00:50] it if you do not open the door then that
[1:00:53] unbelief cannot even affect you we have
[1:00:56] been sealed my brother and sister and
[1:00:58] when you think about it the blood over
[1:01:00] the mantle what did it do you a lot of
[1:01:03] ways you can look at this but please
[1:01:05] catch this when the blood was over the
[1:01:07] mantle of the door my brother and sister
[1:01:10] it sealed what was on the inside it
[1:01:13] wasn't sealing what was on the outside
[1:01:16] amen so they had to be in the house with
[1:01:18] the blood over the the mantle the lentil
[1:01:22] H it was there that's the position not
[1:01:24] outside not outside the blood had to be
[1:01:27] in the blood under the blood and so
[1:01:30] there it was God sealed them and here we
[1:01:32] are today living here in this age a time
[1:01:35] that we need God more than ever
[1:01:39] before my brother and sister don't be
[1:01:41] looking back and saying I wish I had
[1:01:43] been with the prophet there in meetings
[1:01:45] in
[1:01:46] 1965 what we need to be is with the
[1:01:49] great prophet in meetings here in
[1:01:52] 2025 amen cuz when we're here with the
[1:01:55] great prophet our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:01:57] same power that was seen and witnessed
[1:02:00] is there is right here in this building
[1:02:03] this morning ready to do what you would
[1:02:06] ask what do you need this morning it's
[1:02:10] about time maybe we acknowledge we are
[1:02:12] needy
[1:02:13] people
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:24] unbelief can it do away with with belief
[1:02:26] no
[1:02:28] sir in fact
[1:02:31] unbelief doesn't even contain the same
[1:02:37] ingredient it can't water down real
[1:02:42] belief because unbelief is a lack of
[1:02:45] faith a lack of word lack of the
[1:02:48] presence my brother and sister belief
[1:02:51] contains all of that amen so you can't
[1:02:54] just say I'll add a little belief or
[1:02:57] faith to unbelief and turn it into
[1:02:59] belief it doesn't work that
[1:03:03] way and we look at this I love this
[1:03:05] shall their unbelief make the faith of
[1:03:07] God without effect I say my brother and
[1:03:10] sister it's time for us to just make
[1:03:12] sure I'm not preaching like your Sinners
[1:03:14] I'm not preaching like your unbelievers
[1:03:16] but I'm just saying this is a time we
[1:03:18] should make sure that we're in a
[1:03:20] position that the faith of God the word
[1:03:22] of God has the correct effect on us
[1:03:26] that's right we don't want the word to
[1:03:28] run off of us like water on a duck's
[1:03:31] back we want to absorb the word we want
[1:03:34] to be as it were a sponge instead of a
[1:03:36] brick amen
[1:03:40] amen you know we look at this often
[1:03:42] times have have any of you been
[1:03:43] influenced by talking in a positive
[1:03:46] sense believer Christian been been
[1:03:49] influenced by another believer I I think
[1:03:51] every one of us that's that's really the
[1:03:53] pattern that God chose that he would put
[1:03:56] those that would be amples to us and we
[1:03:59] could look to them but you see a true uh
[1:04:02] example or ample that God would give
[1:04:05] will never allow the credit to be
[1:04:08] pointed to themselves that's right it
[1:04:10] they're always pointing you on to Jesus
[1:04:14] Christ on higher higher higher so we
[1:04:19] look at this and realize that that our
[1:04:21] relationship with the Lord needs to be
[1:04:24] based on our relation ship
[1:04:28] alone in other words if I was to say you
[1:04:30] know I serve God today brother Lonnie
[1:04:33] Jenkins was quite quite a mentor to me I
[1:04:37] cannot live on brother Lonnie's
[1:04:38] Revelation
[1:04:39] today in fact even many things that I
[1:04:42] have tried to pass on to others around
[1:04:45] me I share them but you see my brother
[1:04:48] and sister what brother Lonnie spoke to
[1:04:51] me in those days would be empty if I
[1:04:55] never the revelation of what he was
[1:04:57] saying right so if I just tried to live
[1:05:00] off of the words alone the time would
[1:05:03] run out memory causes us to not be able
[1:05:07] to remember exactly how it was but you
[1:05:09] see when that relationship that one
[1:05:12] would Mentor you into one would
[1:05:14] encourage you into when that
[1:05:16] relationship becomes your
[1:05:20] relationship as a child I lied to my dad
[1:05:23] and it's not acceptable in this day but
[1:05:26] it was I think in the
[1:05:28] 70s I lied to my dad and I thought he
[1:05:31] was beating me to death he whooped me so
[1:05:35] hard and when it was all done he looked
[1:05:37] me in the face and says if you'll tell
[1:05:39] the truth the first time you don't have
[1:05:41] to remember the story that's right I
[1:05:44] tell you it changed my life I didn't
[1:05:46] appreciate being whooped on what I did
[1:05:50] appreciate was a lesson behind it that
[1:05:53] if I'll just stand for truth I don't
[1:05:55] ever have have to remember what I said
[1:05:57] when I said it and my brother and sister
[1:05:59] if you will build your relationship on
[1:06:02] the Lord Jesus Christ going through life
[1:06:05] when you hit the hard times you don't
[1:06:07] have to stop and say what did I build
[1:06:09] this relationship on you'll be able to
[1:06:12] stand there and say I know who my
[1:06:14] relationship was it wasn't this pastor
[1:06:16] it wasn't this church it wasn't this
[1:06:18] great man it was Jesus Christ and cuz
[1:06:21] pastors and churches and great men can
[1:06:23] fall fail go away but that relationship
[1:06:27] that has been formed and and brought
[1:06:29] right in and become one with Christ it
[1:06:32] won't fail you it can't fail you and you
[1:06:34] will remember that in every situation in
[1:06:37] every day of your
[1:06:39] lives in the good times we praise His
[1:06:43] name just a principle right there in the
[1:06:46] good times we praise His name and when
[1:06:49] we have learned the real relationship in
[1:06:51] the bad times we still find oursel
[1:06:54] praising his his name it won't be about
[1:06:57] our condition my brother and sister but
[1:07:00] it will be about the relationship that's
[1:07:02] right
[1:07:04] amen you see when that
[1:07:07] is on him when our
[1:07:12] witness is Jesus Christ that's right I
[1:07:16] had a brother one time I thought it was
[1:07:17] interesting how he put it he wasn't
[1:07:18] trying to be
[1:07:20] contrarian but brothers were sharing
[1:07:22] well brothers so and so witnessed to me
[1:07:25] other brother's like well you all know
[1:07:27] brother so and so yes that's who
[1:07:29] witnessed to
[1:07:30] me this and they were sharing and and
[1:07:33] they weren't speaking out of line it was
[1:07:35] just a a little testimony of who and
[1:07:37] this one brother I don't know maybe was
[1:07:39] a little
[1:07:40] contrarian he said well it was Jesus
[1:07:42] Christ that W witnessed to me everybody
[1:07:45] else stopped
[1:07:47] H how do you respond to
[1:07:51] that but you see it might have well and
[1:07:53] it would have been Jesus Christ in
[1:07:56] brother brother sister sister brother
[1:07:59] amen there it is but we got to realize
[1:08:02] that no man ever come to God
[1:08:05] himself amen God come to man our Lord
[1:08:09] Jesus Christ found us we did not find
[1:08:11] him and so when we can find the true
[1:08:14] witness of who we are and how we fit in
[1:08:16] the plan if it was of man it would be
[1:08:19] man again and again and again now
[1:08:21] remember in the scripture you know that
[1:08:23] young Prophet goes to testify to the
[1:08:25] king and God tells him now when you
[1:08:28] leave you don't go back the same way so
[1:08:31] he had a word of the Lord right a thus
[1:08:33] saith the Lord and he goes and God
[1:08:37] accomplishes what God wanted to do and
[1:08:39] the young man is leaving now another
[1:08:41] Prophet man this will throw us this will
[1:08:44] throw us cuz man this is a Prophet this
[1:08:46] is not you know the janitor at the
[1:08:49] church this is a prophet comes and says
[1:08:51] hey you need to come to my house you
[1:08:53] need to do this and you know it's in
[1:08:55] that case here's a young Prophet what
[1:08:57] was it inexperience and lack of
[1:09:00] discipline you say lack of discipline
[1:09:03] that's right some people just have a
[1:09:06] hard time following God's leadership
[1:09:10] that's
[1:09:12] right and he says look after God spoke
[1:09:15] to
[1:09:17] you he spoke to
[1:09:19] me you know why we have a Thunders
[1:09:22] Doctrine that's it because someone stood
[1:09:24] up and said after the prophet was
[1:09:26] finished speaking God anointed me to
[1:09:28] finish
[1:09:31] it come back to my house rest
[1:09:36] eat imagine how he felt when he was
[1:09:39] there on the road and he meets the lion
[1:09:42] face to face there would have been a
[1:09:44] time of recognition I did not obey the
[1:09:48] Lord I'm sure glad God didn't use a lion
[1:09:51] in my life yeah hey I'd be a pitcher on
[1:09:55] wall as a memorial somewhere come on you
[1:09:58] know you would too amen but we got to
[1:10:01] learn that When God says this is how I
[1:10:03] want it done God speaking not man
[1:10:05] speaking this is how I want it done I
[1:10:07] don't care what anyone else says I don't
[1:10:09] care how they want to rearrange the
[1:10:11] message of the hour I put the word out
[1:10:14] there I gave it to you from the voice of
[1:10:16] a prophet direct to you just obey it
[1:10:20] just stay with it don't turn the right
[1:10:22] or left don't come with well God called
[1:10:25] me told me to say and oh no my brother
[1:10:28] and sister that's called confusion that
[1:10:29] is chaos but the word is always clear
[1:10:37] amen so our witness of Jesus
[1:10:41] Christ what is the This Man Called
[1:10:46] Jesus what is his track
[1:10:50] record could we just for a moment kind
[1:10:53] of taking a little bit from what brother
[1:10:54] brand taught in the sermon the trial can
[1:10:58] we just a moment
[1:11:00] stop can we put this man Christ
[1:11:04] Jesus what's his track
[1:11:08] record do we have anyone that says can
[1:11:11] stand today and testify he
[1:11:15] failed anyone testify that he was
[1:11:20] insufficient you
[1:11:22] see there has to be
[1:11:26] a
[1:11:27] witness right a true witness one that
[1:11:30] experienced amen that's right now
[1:11:32] there'd be people that say I prayed and
[1:11:36] God never answered my
[1:11:37] prayer yes he did you were just
[1:11:39] listening for your answer you were
[1:11:42] listening for what you wanted it to be
[1:11:44] and God
[1:11:45] did answer your prayer amen just not the
[1:11:51] way you wanted him to that's right just
[1:11:53] not in the time and the fashion
[1:11:56] but this man now will go over here and
[1:11:58] witness that God did not answer his
[1:12:01] prayer what kind of witness is he F
[1:12:05] false witness that's
[1:12:09] right by the same token men will stand
[1:12:13] today and say the Lord told
[1:12:17] me and if it doesn't bear witness in the
[1:12:20] word that's it what kind of witness
[1:12:23] that's right is that right
[1:12:26] the word will always take us to the word
[1:12:30] the prophet of God puts it this way and
[1:12:32] says the word of God will never take you
[1:12:34] away that's right from the word
[1:12:38] amen the spirit will never take you away
[1:12:41] from the word so as we look at this my
[1:12:44] brother and sister we just see that the
[1:12:46] track record of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:48] should be here this morning if you are
[1:12:51] discouraged if you're sitting here and
[1:12:53] you feel like you do not have aners you
[1:12:55] feel like there's things that are out of
[1:12:57] kelter my brother and sister just the
[1:12:59] testimony of Jesus Christ should
[1:13:02] increase your faith to be able to stand
[1:13:04] because here's one who has testified he
[1:13:07] says this is what I'll do and I will do
[1:13:09] it according to my word but he didn't
[1:13:12] give us a timeline so perfect now
[1:13:15] actually we do have revelation of of a
[1:13:17] timeline we really honestly do have a a
[1:13:21] witness of the timeline he said before
[1:13:24] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:13:26] gives you a timeline amen that when
[1:13:29] these things shall take place when you
[1:13:31] see these signs we have timeline my
[1:13:34] brother and sister what should we worry
[1:13:36] about when the Lord is going to call us
[1:13:38] home when should we worry about when is
[1:13:41] the rapture taking place why should we
[1:13:43] be worrying about whether our children
[1:13:46] are going to be saved or not if we have
[1:13:48] placed them under the blood and
[1:13:50] committed fully gave them take your
[1:13:52] hands off and give them to the Lord you
[1:13:56] might not like what you see happening in
[1:13:58] their life because my god oh oh my God
[1:14:01] does not play games when he wants to
[1:14:03] change your mind amen we know I know
[1:14:07] personally brothers that will tell you
[1:14:10] don't play games with God cuz I put a
[1:14:12] challenge to God and I regretted what
[1:14:15] happened in my life because of the
[1:14:17] challenge but I serve God today because
[1:14:20] I realized God was listening when I
[1:14:21] challenged him amen right don't say that
[1:14:25] to God cuz God will do the work and if
[1:14:27] he can't lose a one how are you going to
[1:14:30] change it that's right but that doesn't
[1:14:32] take away the fact that we as parents as
[1:14:34] pastors Ministry Etc don't commit our
[1:14:37] time and pray for you and pray for the
[1:14:39] outcome of your children pray for the
[1:14:42] outcome of this church we must do that
[1:14:45] that is our part and don't worry about
[1:14:47] it God will do his part but we've got to
[1:14:50] let go amen and let God Amen do his work
[1:14:54] that's it
[1:14:55] that's it I'm going to hold my children
[1:14:58] a little cocoon I don't want anybody to
[1:15:00] look at my children and and and
[1:15:02] criticize them and and I'm going to
[1:15:05] protect my children cuz I'm a good
[1:15:08] father you just took it out of God's
[1:15:11] hand that's right and put it into your
[1:15:14] hand and then later you'll wonder how
[1:15:16] did we end up I I I I took this position
[1:15:19] and how did it end up like
[1:15:21] this because that's God's business amen
[1:15:24] your job is get down and pray amen your
[1:15:27] job is to get in the word your job is to
[1:15:29] create the atmosphere in the house right
[1:15:31] absolutely right and God that's it is
[1:15:34] there to do his
[1:15:36] job but we've got to let
[1:15:39] go amen and let God do the work amen
[1:15:42] amen amen that's right right young man
[1:15:46] that I met one time his testimony was
[1:15:48] his mother a faithful mother a loving
[1:15:50] mother a caring mother and every time
[1:15:52] she saw him she just tore into to him in
[1:15:55] a motherly way uh you need to serve God
[1:15:57] you've got to serve God you know what's
[1:15:59] right you got to stop what you're doing
[1:16:01] you got to do this and finally one day
[1:16:02] in a fit he told him mom as long as
[1:16:05] you're nagging me I'll never come back
[1:16:06] to
[1:16:08] church sounds
[1:16:10] disrespectful but it shocked his mother
[1:16:14] and she thought is that how it comes
[1:16:15] across I thought I was encouraging my
[1:16:18] son to serve
[1:16:21] God and she got down in prayer and said
[1:16:23] Lord what what can I do to get my son
[1:16:25] how can I encourage my son and she's
[1:16:27] listening to a tape and the prophet of
[1:16:29] God says pray that's it Prayer Changes
[1:16:34] Things amen she got a revelation all of
[1:16:36] her nag time sorry to put it that way
[1:16:38] but all of her nag time converted into
[1:16:40] prayer time and it wasn't long before
[1:16:43] her son says you know I just can't stand
[1:16:45] it any longer I've got to serve God but
[1:16:47] imagine now I because we don't know what
[1:16:49] the other outcome but maybe she just
[1:16:51] decided that nagging was the best way
[1:16:57] her son had made a
[1:16:59] vow I'd have to say with the devil
[1:17:01] anointing him he would have kept that
[1:17:03] vow I'll never come back to
[1:17:07] church but when God got a hold of it
[1:17:11] amen God said you know what you just do
[1:17:15] what I ask you to do and we think it's
[1:17:18] such a minimal thing oh just praying for
[1:17:20] them what what are you doing for them
[1:17:23] I'm just praying for them seem so
[1:17:24] minimal does it till you have Revelation
[1:17:27] and when you have Revelation you realize
[1:17:29] you are shaking Heaven and Earth because
[1:17:33] now you have completely let go of it
[1:17:36] which took a supernatural event in our
[1:17:39] life and let go of that and said Lord
[1:17:42] here it is it's yours amen I can't
[1:17:45] change it anyhow that's right I can't
[1:17:48] fix it but you can and I'm trusting you
[1:17:52] to fix it because you said so that's it
[1:17:55] that's exactly you spoke it Lord I
[1:17:58] believe it and we'll see this come to
[1:18:00] pass Hallelujah but as long as we have
[1:18:03] our hand in there telling the Lord I
[1:18:05] need to help you I need to help you Lord
[1:18:09] You're not quite seeing it from my point
[1:18:11] of view and the Lord's over here pardon
[1:18:13] me this sounds maybe a little outlandish
[1:18:15] thank God I don't see it from your point
[1:18:17] of
[1:18:18] view cuz we get skewered come on let's
[1:18:21] be honest can we be honest with one
[1:18:22] another we get that thing they call a
[1:18:25] opinion and it's because it's our
[1:18:27] opinion it has to be correct nobody's
[1:18:30] going to come and say well my my opinion
[1:18:33] really isn't correct it's false but I'm
[1:18:35] going to give it to you anyhow know
[1:18:36] everybody who shares their opinion
[1:18:39] believes it's the right thing well let
[1:18:41] me share an opinion with you let go
[1:18:44] that's it and let God that's it just
[1:18:47] hand it over to the Lord that's right
[1:18:50] and he'll deal with it in
[1:18:53] time does that mean it's next week
[1:18:55] brother Paul no might not even be next
[1:18:57] year that's it we might see a world in
[1:19:00] chaos such that we never dreamed it was
[1:19:02] but I want you to really study the
[1:19:04] thought I many years ago preached to the
[1:19:07] church we were down by by the post
[1:19:09] office area down there uh across from
[1:19:11] where the police station is now you know
[1:19:14] and I remember preaching there saying
[1:19:15] look how Wicked this world is this is
[1:19:18] Sodom oh the coming of the Lord must be
[1:19:22] imminent and it's about 40 times worse
[1:19:24] first
[1:19:26] now you you couldn't trust Paul's
[1:19:28] opinion on what I thought was so
[1:19:31] horrible Sodom was a lot rougher city
[1:19:34] than we give it credit
[1:19:43] for the testimony of a true
[1:19:46] witness brother brandham says
[1:19:50] here now a testimony before a person has
[1:19:54] to have an
[1:19:55] experience before they can testify
[1:19:58] absolutely now look I don't want to
[1:20:00] discourage nobody here but we got people
[1:20:04] without the Holy Ghost testifying God's
[1:20:07] opinion that's it
[1:20:09] right scripture tells us that you can't
[1:20:12] even say that Jesus truly say you can
[1:20:14] say the words but you won't be saying it
[1:20:16] in spirit and in truth that Jesus is the
[1:20:19] Christ without the Holy Ghost that's
[1:20:21] right amen it it gives you a very clear
[1:20:24] picture of the line that God has cut
[1:20:26] through there saying just cuz these
[1:20:27] words come from your mouth doesn't mean
[1:20:29] you're a witness that's right without
[1:20:31] experience you're not that's right don't
[1:20:35] discourage it get the
[1:20:37] experience amen if you're called in
[1:20:39] court you have to have to as give a
[1:20:41] testimony you have to know something
[1:20:44] before you can testify right that's
[1:20:47] right any old man can stand and say
[1:20:49] God's a
[1:20:50] Creator
[1:20:52] exactly then then they'll go and support
[1:20:54] for evolution yeah still believing that
[1:20:58] God's a
[1:20:59] Creator Sorry God doesn't straddle
[1:21:02] fences God doesn't hang to the side he's
[1:21:06] clearcut God's very
[1:21:10] clearcut he's so clear-cut that
[1:21:13] basically he'll say if you'll just get
[1:21:14] out of my way that's right you're in
[1:21:17] desperation for this for that the other
[1:21:19] if you just get out of my way I'll take
[1:21:22] care of
[1:21:23] it you know that's nothing like I'll
[1:21:25] just take this back to experience you
[1:21:27] know um you you be a young man uh this
[1:21:31] was my life I'm a young man I want to be
[1:21:33] a carpenter I've got all the
[1:21:36] tools I got every tool I
[1:21:39] need and I'm there working and I'm
[1:21:42] working underneath this older
[1:21:44] gentleman finally one day in frustration
[1:21:46] he turns around and said are you my
[1:21:49] puppy or
[1:21:51] what no I'm not
[1:21:54] then why don't you sit back and
[1:21:57] learn but you see what I wanted to do I
[1:22:00] wanted to I wanted to prove that I
[1:22:01] really cared I wanted to be there every
[1:22:03] time he turned around
[1:22:07] here and he's like get away from
[1:22:11] me get away from me and observe get away
[1:22:15] and when I say this is how you do this
[1:22:17] pay
[1:22:18] attention but we think oh I'm following
[1:22:20] the Lord so closely
[1:22:25] out of
[1:22:27] ignorance yeah are you with me yeah you
[1:22:30] know it's good I like to see enthusiasm
[1:22:33] I want to see my grandkids learn the
[1:22:35] things that God's blessed me with but I
[1:22:38] don't want to you know step on their
[1:22:40] feet till they hurt and turn around
[1:22:42] elbow them in the head I don't want to
[1:22:44] do all of this stuff what God wants us
[1:22:46] to do is to look and live amen when when
[1:22:50] they were there with the Brazen serpent
[1:22:52] God didn't say you have to come up here
[1:22:54] and touch this thing what you had to do
[1:22:56] is look and live amen whether you on the
[1:22:59] near side or on the far side in the
[1:23:01] valley or On Top of the Rock you look
[1:23:03] you can live my brother and sister God
[1:23:05] doesn't want us to have to go become
[1:23:07] some preachers some pastors uh best man
[1:23:11] as it were to be there beck and call and
[1:23:13] to th just throw ourselves into the work
[1:23:15] what he wants us to do is sit back and
[1:23:17] say you know what there's a principle
[1:23:19] there's something and if I get the
[1:23:20] principles I will be as my pastor is I
[1:23:23] will be a faithful man of God I will be
[1:23:26] what it is that that God has called me
[1:23:28] to be my brother and sister but you
[1:23:30] won't do that by tagging along cuz
[1:23:32] tagging along you'll miss most of what
[1:23:34] is done and the reason it's done so you
[1:23:37] look at that see seeing something that
[1:23:39] knows the witness is a person who has
[1:23:42] seen something and knows that it is the
[1:23:45] truth yes
[1:23:50] y could we get a better understanding of
[1:23:53] Christ in you
[1:23:55] you
[1:23:57] amen I've shared it in the church here
[1:24:00] brother in Chile older brother used to
[1:24:03] be a pastor but but you know as time
[1:24:06] went on he he wasn't a pastor anymore

[1:26:16] day he's like Lord I don't think they're
[1:26:19] ready the Lord the brother puts it this
[1:26:22] way it wasn't an audible voice but it
[1:26:24] rung in my
[1:26:27] head today is the
[1:26:30] day do you know that
[1:26:34] church was roughly half of the
[1:26:37] church when he got up and says have you

[1:26:45] Springs it to them half of the church
[1:26:48] says you're an ult and you were
[1:26:50] deceiving us the other half of the
[1:26:52] church including the pastor and in the
[1:26:54] ministry says that's what we've been
[1:26:56] looking
[1:26:59] for when we let go and let God that's it
[1:27:04] right that's it oh in the wrong season
[1:27:06] my brother and sister no wonder the way
[1:27:08] it's approached I I believe this this
[1:27:09] personal opinion okay can can I have
[1:27:11] permission to express I think half the
[1:27:14] time that people re back up or kind of
[1:27:16] reject the message is not the message
[1:27:18] itself it's how we present it that's
[1:27:21] right yeah
[1:27:24] yeah like a brother told me once he
[1:27:27] Saidi love scrambled eggs but I don't
[1:27:29] like scrambled eggs that look like
[1:27:31] they've come off the
[1:27:32] floor you see we can scramble it all up
[1:27:36] and we present it in the wrong
[1:27:38] fashion no wonder they don't want to eat
[1:27:41] it but when we step back and let God do
[1:27:45] his work am when the season was right
[1:27:49] and it was the Holy Spirit that
[1:27:50] discerned the season that told this
[1:27:52] brother today is the day not next week
[1:27:56] not next month not next year today is
[1:28:00] the day amen and it works
[1:28:03] perfectly amen absolutely amen witness a
[1:28:07] person seen something that knows it is
[1:28:08] the truth they are called to give
[1:28:12] witness amen did he say
[1:28:16] speak
[1:28:17] witness and then a witness must know
[1:28:20] what he's talking about oh now he's
[1:28:21] starting to talk yeah so so there's a
[1:28:24] time that you can be a witness without
[1:28:26] talking but then when you come to the
[1:28:28] time that he knows what he's talking
[1:28:30] about he must not be somebody told me a
[1:28:32] certain certain thing he must be the
[1:28:35] witness himself if not he is speaking of
[1:28:37] someone else that could be a witness at
[1:28:39] the scene right exactly let's go to that
[1:28:43] did that have another part to that I
[1:28:44] don't remember if I posted it in there
[1:28:46] or not maybe not okay I was trying to
[1:28:49] keep it a little shorter but you see my
[1:28:51] brother and sister God's always always
[1:28:54] got a witness Amen on the scene amen
[1:28:57] amen now I'm not speaking harshly don't
[1:28:59] un misunderstand me but this morning
[1:29:01] somebody will walk out of here and say I
[1:29:02] didn't really understand what brother
[1:29:04] Paul was saying somebody will walk out
[1:29:05] of here and say God spoke to me this
[1:29:07] morning and one will be a witness
[1:29:09] because they know exactly the other ones
[1:29:11] say I went to church but you see God
[1:29:14] knows exactly what he's doing in the
[1:29:16] time and the place and the condition
[1:29:19] that he wants everything to be in right
[1:29:21] going to pray for the baby but the Hat
[1:29:24] has to be in the right place and brother
[1:29:27] brandham says I couldn't move the Hat
[1:29:30] that's right amen it wouldn't be the
[1:29:32] preacher moving the hat or the preacher
[1:29:35] trying to move the spirit in the church
[1:29:38] it is God that must put the hat and God
[1:29:41] might use a man or a woman to move the
[1:29:44] hat but it's got to be God that's moving
[1:29:46] the Hat that's right amen we can't come
[1:29:48] and say we're going to have a Revival
[1:29:50] get everybody in this building saved we
[1:29:52] might have a Revival and turn way more
[1:29:54] than we bring to Christ because we
[1:29:56] didn't do it God's way but when we let
[1:29:59] go and say Lord here it is I commit this
[1:30:01] to you this is your word if they are
[1:30:04] your seed Lord they can't walk away from
[1:30:07] this
[1:30:09] word oh
[1:30:13] my I believe this morning in spite of
[1:30:16] the unbelief around us that the faith of
[1:30:20] God is still in full effect amen I'm not
[1:30:23] worried about the message puttering out
[1:30:25] burning out being blowed out my brother
[1:30:28] and sister there'll be a lot of men
[1:30:30] there'll be a lot of men that will come
[1:30:32] and say nope the message is not I I I
[1:30:34] say this because I've heard them say it
[1:30:36] and the message just doesn't have the
[1:30:37] same effect it used
[1:30:39] to says who
[1:30:42] yeah says
[1:30:44] who the seed can't grow without light is
[1:30:47] a sun any less the light today than it
[1:30:49] was when God spoke it my brother and
[1:30:52] sister it's just as powerful and it will
[1:30:54] bring forth we need to do our part but
[1:30:57] you see this is what happened right Leo
[1:31:01] deia right if I had my little grandson
[1:31:04] up here I'd use him for an
[1:31:06] example all the rest of you are a little
[1:31:08] bit
[1:31:09] big Le
[1:31:14] deia sleep my baby
[1:31:18] sleep everything is just fine
[1:31:24] sleep my baby
[1:31:30] sleep the Lord told me everything's just
[1:31:33] fine I'm sorry the Lord's not here to
[1:31:36] lull you to
[1:31:37] sleep he's here to wake us up amen he's
[1:31:41] here to bring it that we would recognize
[1:31:43] what the message really is we have got a
[1:31:47] misconstrued idea of what the message is
[1:31:49] we believe God sent a prophet we see it
[1:31:51] in the scripture see all this but we
[1:31:53] don't see the personal conviction amen
[1:31:56] that the message was sent to bring
[1:31:59] that's right you say brother Paul isn't
[1:32:01] that a little straight it might be but I
[1:32:02] tell you what if you standing there with
[1:32:04] the Apostle Paul he'd have let you know
[1:32:07] directly you don't got it
[1:32:10] yeah he comes back my brother and sister
[1:32:12] after his journey he gets back to
[1:32:15] Jerusalem he doesn't run in there in
[1:32:17] high five and hug all of the disciples
[1:32:20] he goes back there and says what are you
[1:32:21] guys you guys are lukewarm you're like
[1:32:23] the phical you're you're you're not
[1:32:25] sincere you're not committed they didn't
[1:32:27] like Paul some said Paul come to stir us
[1:32:30] up yes he did praise God anybody want to
[1:32:34] be stirred up by the word amen let's not
[1:32:36] be laxidasical let's not just sit here
[1:32:38] and say hey God sent a prophet
[1:32:40] everything's fine my brother and sister
[1:32:42] why don't we let God go and let him do
[1:32:45] what he really wants to do oh let's have
[1:32:47] a Revival why don't you start the
[1:32:49] Revival amen it doesn't need to be a
[1:32:52] guest preacher it doesn't need to be
[1:32:53] anything but you and God and then you
[1:32:55] can start a Revival
[1:32:58] amen are we brave enough to commit
[1:33:00] ourselves and say Lord start with me
[1:33:03] amen amen or we would rather that after
[1:33:05] it's kind of proven to half of the
[1:33:07] church then then we'll jump on board my
[1:33:10] brother and sister sorry this will be
[1:33:13] blunt what if the other half of the
[1:33:15] church never has a Revival that's it and
[1:33:19] you're waiting for them
[1:33:22] uh is this too blunt no
[1:33:26] individual time to let go and let God do
[1:33:29] his
[1:33:30] work time for us to get rid of all the
[1:33:32] little petties and the little these
[1:33:34] things that come and and oh we're shook
[1:33:36] up about this and we're shook up about
[1:33:37] that well what if you're the only one
[1:33:39] the prophet preaches this I feel
[1:33:41] confident to to paraphrase this quote
[1:33:43] what if you're the only one in this
[1:33:45] church that's it that's going to go in
[1:33:47] the Rapture and you're waiting for
[1:33:49] someone else amen my why don't you let
[1:33:53] go and let God that's it amen that's it
[1:33:57] right have we seen enough to say we're
[1:33:58] Witnesses
[1:34:00] amen amen any hands raised here to say
[1:34:03] we've seen enough to say we Are
[1:34:05] Witnesses my brother and sister we've
[1:34:07] seen the supernatural
[1:34:15] amen when you let the witness
[1:34:20] Testify the false witness is judged of
[1:34:23] his testimony
[1:34:26] and the true witness is judged of his
[1:34:32] testimony what
[1:34:34] sentence do we want to
[1:34:40] receive because we will be judged amen
[1:34:43] of what we testify what we witness we
[1:34:48] will be
[1:34:50] judged I'm going to lift my hand today
[1:34:52] I'm no better than any one of you so
[1:34:54] don't misunderstand but I lift my hand
[1:34:55] today and say Lord I Want My Testimony
[1:34:59] to be a true witness of Jesus Christ I
[1:35:02] want my testimony to ring true if
[1:35:04] somebody says I'm going to take you and
[1:35:06] I'm going to run you through the word of
[1:35:08] God and see if you go through the word
[1:35:10] of God you say but I know my life is not
[1:35:13] worthy it wouldn't go yes it will I'm
[1:35:15] telling you cuz you see God will not
[1:35:17] judge you by the flesh God will judge
[1:35:19] you in the spirit and if you have the
[1:35:22] Holy Ghost and in the right spirit in
[1:35:24] the right approach God will take your
[1:35:26] flesh yes yes brother Donnie calls it
[1:35:29] that old rotten filthy
[1:35:34] flesh he'll take that flesh anointed by
[1:35:37] the spirit right through the filter amen
[1:35:40] cuz God said I'm not looking at your
[1:35:42] flesh that's right I'm looking at the
[1:35:44] word and if you don't believe this world
[1:35:46] out here can be anointed to let your
[1:35:49] flesh go through the filter and see the
[1:35:51] spirit that's in you then then you
[1:35:53] missed it God will anoint them to not
[1:35:56] see the little everyday failures some of
[1:35:59] them not religious at all and they have
[1:36:01] more Revelation on that than the
[1:36:03] religious
[1:36:06] people I love it let's take it back the
[1:36:09] woman caught in the very
[1:36:12] Act was God speaking to them in the
[1:36:14] flesh or in the
[1:36:17] spirit you could say both
[1:36:20] really but I believe amongst those there
[1:36:23] would have been some of those Sadducees
[1:36:26] Pharisees never had committed adultery
[1:36:29] never had done that would not be guilty
[1:36:32] but
[1:36:33] spiritually they were guilty
[1:36:37] amen God deals with some In the Flesh
[1:36:41] some in the spirit some in
[1:36:43] both if you're guilty in the flesh well
[1:36:46] that'd be horrible that they high
[1:36:47] priests and everything would be guilty
[1:36:49] of the very same things but my brother
[1:36:51] and sister sometimes
[1:36:54] God brings those things and manifests
[1:36:56] them in the spiritual realm the prophet
[1:36:59] of God now there's some crazy people out
[1:37:01] here have said you know that the
[1:37:03] pastor um is your spiritual husband I'll
[1:37:08] let you soap on that one for just a
[1:37:13] minute brother Paul is our spiritual
[1:37:17] husband you could find a minute context
[1:37:20] for that right
[1:37:24] but if you can take it in the flesh
[1:37:25] realm I just divorced you
[1:37:28] all because I couldn't handle it I
[1:37:31] couldn't deal with it trying to control
[1:37:33] your
[1:37:35] life I would put it blunt pardon the
[1:37:39] humor if I'm in
[1:37:41] control you all probably driving a white
[1:37:46] car yeah we won't even go any further
[1:37:50] than that cuz I know some of you don't
[1:37:51] like white cars so we're going to have a
[1:37:52] doctoral argument here see how silly
[1:37:56] that is but spiritual husband's side
[1:37:59] just to reinforce
[1:38:00] this the prophet of God said the wife
[1:38:04] will never answer for the
[1:38:08] husband but the husband will always
[1:38:11] answer that's right for the
[1:38:14] wife if a minister preaches false
[1:38:18] doctrine that spiritually impacts you
[1:38:21] God will have Grace
[1:38:24] but not for the preacher that's right
[1:38:26] the man will answer yes sir take this
[1:38:31] principle go study it go listen to
[1:38:33] brother Eugene he really drives at home
[1:38:35] Redemption always comes through the mail
[1:38:38] amen
[1:38:40] and it is
[1:38:42] there that when we deal that what is the
[1:38:46] husband doing for his wife binding her
[1:38:49] in
[1:38:49] legalism binding her in false control
[1:38:54] no a real husband gives his wife Liberty
[1:38:58] amen amen amen now Sister Jerry that
[1:39:01] doesn't talk about the
[1:39:05] wallet we just we've been discussing
[1:39:09] this let me put it that
[1:39:14] way it's good don't don't worry about it
[1:39:18] it was a small bus I threw under let the
[1:39:21] witness Witnesses testify
[1:39:24] false will testify
[1:39:27] false true will testify truth see we go
[1:39:31] back my brother and sister that uh God
[1:39:34] forbid this is verse four out of our
[1:39:36] original scripture God forbid yay let
[1:39:38] God be true let every man a liar as it
[1:39:41] is written that thou mightest be
[1:39:43] justified in thy sayings what you're
[1:39:46] testifying of and mightest overcome when
[1:39:48] thou art judged God putting us in a
[1:39:51] position that what is testified we will
[1:39:54] find deliverance and what is Justified
[1:39:56] we will find Deliverance you see this
[1:39:59] what the word's doing my brother and
[1:40:01] sister it's not a click now let me hurry
[1:40:03] hurry hurry along here uh in
[1:40:10] expectations what if someone come up in

[1:40:46] them they belong to the express company
[1:40:49] which is Satan transfer and storage he

[1:41:09] critical Spirits amen whatever it would
[1:41:11] be it doesn't have to be just entirely
[1:41:13] with healing but anything that the devil
[1:41:16] would deliver we don't have to accept it
[1:41:19] amen and it's time for us to be bold to
[1:41:21] stand up and say you know Satan I took

[1:41:59] her and they have this little video
[1:42:01] where they depict this all out and
[1:42:03] finally in the end they grab that and
[1:42:05] it's throwed out the door and when Satan
[1:42:07] comes back they rough him up and throw
[1:42:09] him out the door and what this little
[1:42:12] video was depicting was the fact that
[1:42:14] this sister at first accepted I have
[1:42:16] cancer but God spoke to her and said you
[1:42:19] know what you don't have to claim this
[1:42:22] and became Revelation to this sister and
[1:42:25] she started thanking God every single
[1:42:28] day for her healing and she goes back to
[1:42:30] the doctor and the doctor says we don't
[1:42:33] understand why it's not there we know it

[1:48:45] Faithful Men out into the Groves and
[1:48:48] they tore them things down amen you know
[1:48:52] but poor O Gideon man I'm telling you
[1:48:55] poor O Gideon he got it from every angle

[1:49:15] today you will amen because you are his
[1:49:19] chosen amen amen all through scripture
[1:49:22] chosen
[1:49:23] chosen look now my brother and sister
[1:49:25] see look through the scripture also I'm
[1:49:28] I'm way slow as I should be just another
[1:49:31] couple minutes
[1:49:32] here look what God
[1:49:34] did God so anointed his
[1:49:41] ark they
[1:49:43] took the
[1:49:45] ark stole
[1:49:47] it tucked it away in their temple in
[1:49:50] front of their gods
[1:49:52] and every one of them bowed down that's
[1:49:55] right amen now imagine how shocked they
[1:49:58] were cuz see this is not just like oh
[1:50:00] Mighty Wind or earthquake or something
[1:50:03] the ones that were behind the ark fell
[1:50:06] towards it ones to the right fell
[1:50:09] towards it the ones to the left fell
[1:50:12] towards it the ones Beyond it fell
[1:50:14] towards it that's right and I don't care
[1:50:16] what leod deia all the spirits of this
[1:50:19] age what anyone says every one of these
[1:50:22] spirits will fall subject to the word of
[1:50:25] God they will bow down now my brother
[1:50:28] and sister I I want to put this to you a
[1:50:30] little strongly if in the end they'll
[1:50:32] bow down God has given you and I
[1:50:35] Authority today to make them bow down
[1:50:37] right here today to you to Bow subject
[1:50:41] to you as Sons and Daughters of God it's
[1:50:43] time for us to look at the word and say
[1:50:46] that's not history and that's not
[1:50:47] something over here I am the word and I
[1:50:50] am here I'm living in this today and the
[1:50:53] spirits of this age are going to bow
[1:50:56] down in this day to the bride of Christ
[1:50:59] which is the word
[1:51:01] amen is that too
[1:51:03] strong too far out there it's about time
[1:51:07] my brother and sister we get that kind
[1:51:08] of confidence in God that the Satan the
[1:51:12] spirits of the age are going to bow down
[1:51:14] to the word of God and the word is in
[1:51:16] you amen
[1:51:18] hallelujah oh and we have a real God
[1:51:23] the same
[1:51:25] yesterday he's the same today and he'll
[1:51:28] be the same tomorrow that's right he'll
[1:51:32] he'll do the same
[1:51:34] things well brother Paul if we were in a
[1:51:36] lion's
[1:51:38] den would the Lions leave us
[1:51:42] alone it all depends if God chose a lion
[1:51:45] to be what took you home exactly right
[1:51:48] see you can't say well praise God if we
[1:51:53] are in the Dark Ages and we were in the
[1:51:55] Coliseum those Lions wouldn't have
[1:51:57] touched
[1:51:58] us no if God ordained you to give your
[1:52:02] life you would give your life amen and
[1:52:06] if he ordained you to
[1:52:07] live you would be anointed to declare
[1:52:10] the life in you and Satan like a roaring
[1:52:14] lion is roaming to and fro in this day
[1:52:18] and I just this is just personal opinion
[1:52:20] okay is that all right to express this I
[1:52:22] believe if I'd have been in the Lion's
[1:52:24] Den or in the Coliseum I believe I would
[1:52:26] have lived and the reason I believe that
[1:52:28] is because Satan today is going as a
[1:52:31] roaring lion and God has anointed you
[1:52:34] and I not to death but to life amen
[1:52:37] we're standing here serving the same God
[1:52:39] under the same principles of the same
[1:52:41] word and God says you know what I'm not
[1:52:44] calling you to death in this day I'm
[1:52:46] calling you to life in this day and I
[1:52:49] believe whatever age we would have been
[1:52:51] we were called to life
[1:52:53] now that's just an opinion take it how
[1:52:54] you want here amen but I'll tell you
[1:52:57] what my brother and sister we got to
[1:52:59] start standing up and giving God the
[1:53:02] opportunity to fulfill his word now in
[1:53:07] Witnesses did I not finish that
[1:53:10] quote that's all right we move
[1:53:13] on in witnesses there as God spoke from
[1:53:17] Heaven he saw the spirit of God coming
[1:53:19] like a dove falling upon man who had
[1:53:22] been born born in a manger see what the
[1:53:24] world call great God calls foolish and
[1:53:27] what the world called foolish God calls
[1:53:29] great that's right so don't mind to be
[1:53:32] called foolish that goes against this
[1:53:34] old flesh every one of us just want to
[1:53:37] be accepted of our pows we want to we
[1:53:39] want to be you know cuz remember you
[1:53:42] can't have the mind of Christ and the
[1:53:45] mind of the world at the same time you
[1:53:48] can't be in your way and God's way at
[1:53:53] the same
[1:53:57] time that's right I want to learn to be
[1:53:59] a carpenter and I'm going to do it by
[1:54:02] being in your
[1:54:03] way no that's what that Old Gentleman
[1:54:06] you move over there about 8 feet and
[1:54:08] stay out of my way and just
[1:54:11] learn we can't be in God's way no that's
[1:54:15] right we've got to let God have his way
[1:54:20] amen you have
[1:54:22] to get out of your own way to let God
[1:54:25] have his way that's the only way you're
[1:54:28] ever going to do anything you got to get
[1:54:30] away from your own thoughts your own
[1:54:32] reasons don't try to reason amen just
[1:54:35] believe
[1:54:36] amen I'm going to close
[1:54:40] here we have a lot of needs in this
[1:54:42] assembly don't we I think that we could
[1:54:45] just go there wouldn't be a Pew that
[1:54:48] didn't have a need represented on that
[1:54:50] pew
[1:54:55] how are we going to deal with
[1:54:58] that will it help if the pastor preaches
[1:55:03] harder will it help if I tell you you're
[1:55:08] Sinners will it help
[1:55:10] if if if
[1:55:14] if no it
[1:55:17] won't no it
[1:55:20] won't the difference my brother and
[1:55:25] sister is we have to let God have his
[1:55:29] way and I tell you God is God right amen
[1:55:35] can you tell God what to do no
[1:55:38] sir can you move
[1:55:44] God depends on I know how brother
[1:55:46] David's looking at it but you can move
[1:55:49] God by the feeling of our infirmity we
[1:55:52] can move God by our fervent righteous
[1:55:55] prayer we can move God not in man's way
[1:55:59] of thinking I'm going to make God do no
[1:56:01] you're not going to do that but we're
[1:56:03] Sons and Daughters of God we can get God
[1:56:06] to move now it's not take away my
[1:56:10] Affliction change
[1:56:13] me you know there's a brother in
[1:56:15] Cloverdale can't remember his name

[1:57:19] that's right if God would Grant to us a
[1:57:20] spiritual Talent like that
[1:57:22] amen maybe we wouldn't be so so
[1:57:25] dependent upon our self if our self had
[1:57:28] been born Afflicted that's it maybe we
