the master amen aren't you glad you know him hallelujah what a relationship you know if there was ever i don't know why sometimes little thoughts come across your mind if there was ever a name you a person a name that you would want to name drop i think that'd be the name of jesus christ amen well i just want to welcome my good friends the ortega family and good to see you here they're really they're from idaho they're just accidentally been transplanted somewhere else and um you know who knows the lord might lay on their heart someday to come back to their roots but i actually owe rick jr an apology i was supposed to take him for dinner when he was here before and i don't know my life got so full and then when i realized you had already went home it's like oh my but please forgive me you know sometimes we don't mean to to do that but it seems like the cares of life can build up pretty fast sometimes and keep you amen so we're happy to have rick and mary and their children with us tonight amen uh of course uh we miss brother tim sister miriam and joshua here tonight uh joshua i think's arizona isn't he he got back today so and we want to continue to remember brother bob and sister joanne you know sometimes they just they're in our hearts in our mind but we don't you know voice it and we just want to voice that tonight that we miss them i appreciate them amen my it's pretty scary my brother and sister when people are married as long as i you expect to live so anyway um let's just stand and we'll go into the word this evening amen good to see grace and sister sophie tonight um our brother manasseh just texting with him a little bit and just remember him in prayer got a real heart wants to serve the lord amen we live in a day that satan would throw everything he's got out in front of us to distract us from serving him amen hallelujah let's turn to john uh preparations of the inner man i just want to talk to you tonight uh continuing on this thought uh deity has a dwelling place and this uh is just going to be a little foundational we'll actually backtrack a little bit in future services here i think just two or three to kind of cover uh this topic but uh we'll we'll go into the book of john tonight and it's quite a lengthy scripture reading so we'll read part of it and allow you to be seated amen hallelujah everybody got their sword tonight we live in electronic age you know and it's easy sometimes to say well i got my bible right here on my phone but it's just not the same amen we ought to be packing our sword everywhere we go electronics is it ought to be considered convenience you know like you're driving down the road and you want to read your bible you know stuff like that but it ought not be our primary thing it's just not the same to sit down in your chair in the evening or in the morning pick up your phone and read your bible they're proving that the amount that you remember is significantly less when read on a device than it is when your fingers actually touch the page oh my well i want to remember amen i don't want it to be convenient i want to be powerful and i want it to be alive amen john 14 and 1 let not your heart be troubled boy that's something the world's even talking about right now people are tore up amen that you're not let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also and whither i go ye no and the way ye know now this is interesting my brother and sister because thomas we always call him doubting thomas right just because he had a question but if that was the case put your name right behind doubting because we've all asked for a confirmation from god at some point in our life we we need the reassurance we're just mere humans we need that reassurance and so sometimes people like well that doubting thomas well hallelujah doubting paul doubting put your name there amen but look at this now jesus says whether i go ye know and the way ye know thomas said unto him lord we know not wither thou goest and how can we know the way you see it's a context you could say down through the scriptures that god has hid himself and the revelation of his word in plain sight see so it's not going to be intellectualism it's not going to be a seminary it's not going to be whatever that reveals christ to us and jesus is telling them you know see they've already heard it preached the background is already there the lights just got to be turned on oh thank you lord for turning on the light amen jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me if he had known me you should have known my father and from henceforth you know him and have seen him philip saith unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us jesus said unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayeth thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works i believe verse 10 should be a testament to us today amen that it is not what we know it's not what it is but everything that we would speak everything that we would know would not be of ourself but it's the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works amen you know about the time that we ever get to the point we think we're just doing pretty good in our spiritual walk have you ever noticed that right after you boast about what position you're in as a christian that that you get kind of run into a bad spot you might say you run into a place that you feel like you've let the lord down you've had troubles in your life maybe you say something that wasn't quite up to par and you realize my brother and sister that all that we are all that we can do every bit of fiber of our being is christ in us amen hallelujah he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go into my father amen we'll just bless the word and let you be seated heavenly father we just ask you this evening lord this time as i joked with my brother jason i didn't want to be too long tonight lord and i pray you would help me with that but lord this little plate that i brought tonight is very full and father i just ask you to help me lord to go quickly to speak it correctly lord without confusion lord bless this time the saints lord the body of believers whether they're present tonight or out on the road or home lord just ask you to be with them in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints amen you know i find it interesting i want to expand on verse 12 for just a moment amen that he says right here he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also so if we're believers tonight are we believers tonight amen so we should not settle for just some little token representation of having the holy ghost and the life he says the works that i do shall he do also we should stand up and say lord i i am ready i want to be prepared to do this work for you i need you lord to present me or prepare me in such a fashion lord that i can fulfill this scripture right here and he said greater works than these shall he do because i go in into my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son and if she shall ask anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandments amen i was just listening to a man on the radio yesterday and boy he was just tearing into it i i was actually quite surprised that uh a man of uh of uh the amount of coverage or exposure he has but he ripped into it and he said you know one of the problems we have is a weak pulpit we have this that the people got he nailed it right on the head he said the churches got so concerned about what they were doing their building programs their finery all of this stuff that they started watering down the gospel to keep the people coming and keep the ties pouring in and he says so what happened was as time went on the only way you can keep these people satisfied is to continue to water down the word of god hello i tell you my brother and sister if we get right down to just a little handful i say we stick with the original word of god we don't deviate we don't have to come to a place that we would water it down and then he went on to say he said the children they're out in these streets tearing it up the children that are rioting and doing all these behaviors he said we might blame the parents we might blame all kinds of things we might blame our schools but he said i'm going to squarely today place the blame on the preacher in the pulpit if he had continued to preach the truth and it held the standard and encouraged the people to hold the standard that there might be some families like the ortega children that have been out rioting in the streets you see there's a difference my brother and sister when you raise a family in the fear and admonition of the lord they have a desire to travel to the world amen and i'm giving a compliment to their children which i love very dearly they have more desire to go and share the gospel and live a good life than they are to go out and knock the windows out of your car and take the tires amen so you see it's all what we present before our children and when we come to the place my brother and sister that it comes right back and moves right up the chain of command you might say and comes and rests right at the pulpit well this this and gentlemen is not the only one not the first one and will not be the last one to declare that it's a weak pulpit that has caused many of the problems we have today amen you know there is a a bishop uh back east that's been in the news just a tad bit and and he he got up and now while we don't necessarily agree with the catholic church this man had a little fortitude had a little courage and got up and said that that we should not be supporting this we should not be giving encouragement to to the things that are happening in the the things that are being projected and the catholic church the local uh uh bishop or whatever of the diocese there overall has taken the man from his office and said i may well make it to where he can never ever be a priest over a church ever again you see my brother and sister it's not just the ungodly so to speak out here it's not the ones that are the heathen and they're the agnostic or the atheist you see it's invaded to the very core of what we call christianity amen and so as we look at this we recognize as we move forward today that deity must have a dwelling place amen and so as we look at this we'll recognize as jesus is speaking he's making this declaration to the people if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth now my brother and sister we well know as bible i i would use the word scholar just because as christians we study the word of god uh every every bible reader would understand that what jesus was talking about was sending the holy spirit which is the very spirit of god sending it down as a comforter to the people but look how jesus right here in these words declares it as a spirit of truth see it's not just a presence that has come he didn't descend a comforter but it was a spirit of truth and when that comforter has come my brother and sister truth must surround it amen it cannot be something contrary to the word of god but it must be the very life that god has presented to us and our lord jesus christ come forth as a sacrificial lamb he made that sacrifice for us can we hold another standard and say that sacrifice was for us amen it is to take the liberty that we have as americans and say we want to be communists my brother and sister that's an oxymoron amen that is a paradox when people say well i want to take from you and give to me and we'll call that liberty no my brother and sister that's not what it is it is a bondage that is being brought and we can look at this and people will say well there is a a marxist movement uh antifa or whatever they pronounce that all of these movements here my brother and sister come on let's get right back the word of god shows us there's two spirits in the framework amen so these are not just a movement these are not it's either moving forward to serve god or it's tearing down and separating which is of satan amen so you see right here in the midst of our streets this might be a little strong forgive me if you feel it is but right in the midst of our street you are seeing not just misguided children but children anointed well they're not all children they arrested some 60 year old so you know it's it's all happening maybe he was an old hippie i don't know but you just you see my brother and sister what you have is the spirit of the antichrist right magnified walking the streets of our cities destroying and people say well they have a right to their opinion and that's right god gave satan the opportunity to voice amen he can speak it forth amen but there's even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me oh my he's never disappeared from the believer he's never disappeared my brother and sister from the presence of the believer but ye see me because i live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him what a beautiful promise we see in the scripture my brother and sister how clearly that god lays this plan out before us it is not something that you need to understand greek that you need to understand aramaic or hebrew or whatever it might be but my brother and sister what we need to do is pray for revelation that we can understand god because he's right here in our midst right in our presence and he says right here that he will manifest himself to us amen when i put the else on there that's because we are to this individual amen look at this and how god has blessed us now i want to come down and just go right into another scripture if you'll just bear with me tonight amen second corinthians the ninth chapter i mean the second chapter verses 9 through 16. amen but as it is written i hath not seen nor ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him so in our previous reading he said if you love me do my commandments now they're telling us here that the scripture is as the apostle paul was speaking to corinthians he's telling us that the very heart of man and the things that god has given our eyes to see our ears to hear what is entered into our heart and and when i say this i hope you follow me god's done some glorious things saints i've seen god just do the supernatural can someone say amen we've seen god do absolutely the supernatural i've seen the sunrise and the sun set i've seen some of the most beautiful places on earth and all of those things it's done i've seen god come on the scene and heal people i've seen god come on the scene and just uh it's just incredible amen i just don't even have time tonight to to stop and so all of that that we have seen all that we have heard and all that has entered into our heart are not even enough to prepare us for what god has come to give to you and i that love him amen look about this you know we sing that song how beautiful heaven must be well my brother and sister if we just get into the spirit stay in the spirit i'm preaching to myself tonight get in the spirit stay in the spirit this old earth we live in right now is just pretty beautiful still amen there's a lot of chaos there's a lot of problems around us but the presence of god is moving in the midst of his believer amen saints sons and daughters of god they're seeing the supernatural they're seeing the sinner still my brother and sister seeing the sinner repent and see lives completely turned around we're seeing as it were the natives and people say well that's a pretty few now but there are still places on the earth my brother and sister where people do not even know the name of jesus christ and when they receive that name there's such miraculous change comes in their world my brother and sister it's just beyond measure to see what god does amen well i'll tell you when we look at this for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god see we can never approach this i preached a little bit on this in the past few weeks my brother and sister we cannot even know or understand or express the things of god without getting into the spirit amen we cannot approach it in a carnal fashion we cannot come it's not about the beauty of our church the beauty of our closed car house whatever it might be none of that will do anything for us but when we get into the spirit of god a whole different world appears amen reminds me of a story once of an individual he was talking about how that he had come on the verge of committing suicide and uh something stopped him and a few days later he was i think riding a subway or a city bus and some man just said i feel like the lord spoke to me and told me to give you this and and he looked down and it was a little pocket bible and the man was like well okay i i don't read the bible and the man says well i know as the lord told me to give it to you a few days later once again that spirit and that's what it is exactly a spirit uh come upon him and he was thinking about taking his life and then he remembered that somewhere in a pocket there that he had that bible amen and when he opened that up my brother and sister one of the most common scriptures that's quoted in the world of christendom he opened it up and it opened directly to john 3 16 and god so loved the world and he said something poured over him he said it was so supernatural he said he felt there was a presence as though there was someone right there he could reach out and touch and something struck deep in his heart that god loved him oh my my brother and sister tell me not god's not real man could be sitting there thinking about taking his life and move from that to knowing god loves him in just a moment of time amen hallelujah so now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god so see without receiving this spirit of god we cannot even see the things that god has given to us amen the spirit of the world my brother and sister is the spirit of separation the spirit of the world is what is anointing the people to come to a place that they don't even though they might know that a judgment is coming they might know that there is a hell but they are anointed by this spirit that is the spirit of the world to not even care if they are separated from god so it is not a even a care in their heart not a burden in their heart that they could face the judgment and go to hell see that's been completely erased satan has taken that from them and so when the spirit of the world possesses a person now let's not be mistaken that you might have someone that could even tonight be doing some despicable act and it might be in the day or a week or month or a year god would come to them totally change their life so we need to remember that god's still moving amen in the midst of the people our people us you and i the world amen now which things verse 13 which things also we speak not in words which man's wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual now i want to ask you before you got saved maybe in the process of being saved god dealing with you is the bible the same book now as it was then i don't believe it can be back then we were looking at our sin what god was going to do for our sin we were looking at being washed we were looking at repenting and being baptized we were desiring the holy ghost which we still do amen but you see the book has taken on much more meaning amen now we're looking into the promises of god we're looking into the revelation the book of revelation is the revelation of jesus christ we're looking into the revelation of jesus christ and he said all that he was he poured into the church which is not a building with a name over the door but it's you and i and so we cannot look at the book the same that we have and as time goes on my brother and sister uh you know i'll just type this not to embarrass my wife but every once in a while probably not as often as we should sister jerry will pull this box out that has all the letters that i i wrote uh uh to her in our courtship amen this is long before you know internet and and we had just a few moments uh of time you know to talk on the telephone i don't know it was sunday afternoons at what time was it three o'clock that was our little time we had a little short time on the telephone but looking back through this my brother and sister i hope you catch this i'm trying to embarrass my wife or be too public but you know when you open that up and you just select a little letter or card out of there and i read that card sometimes we laugh and go oh my were we silly but you know what it does it turns something inside of me amen because you see the desire the love i have for her has not waned it has got greater and i hope you understand what i'm talking about your bible not being the same as i look these letters and i tell her you're beautiful and i i longed to see you i wished i was there today but a letter will have to do and what did you do and what did all this stuff my brother and sister i look back and i think lord how blessed i am amen you know it is wonderful to check that out it's good you know even when you're fighting it might be good to look through your old love letters amen you know even in hard times maybe you ought to look through your love letters amen i'll tell you what we have right here we have a love letter that's right here this is what this is my brother and sister some people get all confused thinking the bible is about the heathen and the agnostic and the atheist out here but the bible really truly if you encapsulate it is a love letter to the bride of jesus christ oh my take your love letters with you amen oh hallelujah well look at this see things we all which things also we speak not in words which man's wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual amen not an intellectual gospel saints right but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned here's revelation coming right out of the word telling us right here that they cannot understand this because it has to be spiritually discerned does the word of god say that we wouldn't cannot even call jesus the christ without the holy ghost amen so people can mimic or voice that let me use the word i hope it's not offensive they can parrot it anyone can come and parrot the gospel i love the lord i'm thankful for this i'm thankful for that and god bless all this and those words can just be parroted my brother and sister but when you get back down into the spiritual side and a man says you know what jesus christ is lord it has an entirely different significance than the man who does not have the holy ghost but has a religious spirit might have raised up in church always faithful in church might pay tithes and support building programs and be on committees but if he doesn't have the holy ghost those words do not contain the same authority amen just like some other man a stranger pardon me for bringing it personal but a stranger could walk up to my wife and we might be somewhere in my walk up to her and say i love you it will not bring about the same response are you with me tonight amen you see what happens is there's an intimacy that only comes from getting in the inner veil into the very presence of almighty god amen but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man now we hear this quoted a lot and i just spoke on it here a while back a few words but i want to just remind you my brother and sister that he is spiritual justice all things yet he himself is not judged of no man that's because he has already allowed himself to be judged by the word of god amen so it's not going to matter whether some man says he's right or he's wrong that he's a fanatic that he's a jesus freak or whatever they might say my brother and sister a holy roller whatever it won't matter see when that man has been judged by the word of god he's already judged and the words of no man will change the judgment of god amen that doesn't mean that you can't judge me i'm out here robbing banks getting drunk oh don't judge me no that's not what it's talking about but people twisted into that realm because they just don't want to face the judgment but my brother and sister it's when a man's already been judged by the word that the world won't judge that man amen so you look upon standing upon that to know that we have been given such a beautiful opportunity to be judged by the word of god and to respond as i've been speaking to you my brother and sister it's one thing to read your bible it's another thing to pray but if you do not submit yourself to the word of god none of that will do you any good amen for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ now you know if you go around and you spout that off people are going to say that you are uh well i don't know we live in such an age where everybody's offended i don't know what they'll call you spiritually racist i don't know what they would call you people don't like it people don't like the idea that christians can stand up with confidence and declare to the world that they've got the holy ghost that they have the mind of christ they don't like that you're too confident you're supposed to as a christian just kind of stumble around and stumble along and make all kinds of mistakes and then tell everybody i tell you this just gets my goat up amen i hope you don't mind but it just really rips me up when people are like well god knows i'm broken well good i have a repair manual that's got all kinds of repair instructions it's got all kinds of instructions to break everything that you could possibly as a human break amen i don't think god's gonna buy the excuse well god knows i'm broken well good let god fix you that you can stand up and say you know what i've got the mind of god amen i've got his spirit i'm gonna do greater works amen i don't have to sit down and be some just lily pad christian just hoping that it'll be a good day the sun will shine and everything will be all right i can have some confidence the word says i can bind amen this word says i can loose the word says that i can offer the grace of god to those around me my brother and sister i don't have to become a wallflower christian i can stand up with a little confidence and say you know what god answers prayer and i will pray for you if you desire i will pray for you and i believe god will come on this scene i remember once uh years ago my brother and sister now i spoke and i'm not speaking of me but just to give a reference i remember i actually went to uh to uh some neighbors a few miles from us actually but can still consider them neighbors and i was looking for the husband and uh but he wasn't home and they have a couple handicapped children one of them has passed away now and uh so we're standing out in the yard and uh these people used to be holiness and i was talking to her and um just it just come out of me she said well i see i see your wife in the store i i see your wife sometimes in town and i i see she still wears a dress all the time and i said yes cause we it's not something that was church it's something that's down in her heart she don't do it because i wanted her to do it she does it because there's a conviction in her heart and that's how she feels to be and you know we got to talking and and she said well you know i used to just be on fire for the lord and i just really loved him but you know life is hard and i don't know it just come out of me and i told her i said look if you will turn now saints i was shocked by the very words come out of my mouth but i spoke to her just with confidence a almost booming voice if you will turn back to god god will heal both of your children now for myself after hearing my own voice i was like oh my what have i just said but i tell you what hurt me what cut me right to the depth of my heart she had tears in her eyes she looked me in the face and said i can't do that oh god it broke my heart saints you see there comes something a divide in there so conquered by the spirit of the world if you're with me amen so conquered she wasn't able to even take the basic promises of god and apply him back to her life and she said my church has failed man i said it never should have been your church it should have been a relationship with god we run into them just here uh uh two or three weeks ago restaurant here in town and you know i've always there's always been a little strain there but they were just they were just open and speaking to me and as they walked off i actually was a little surprised they said well god bless you paul you and your wife now my brother and sister we don't want to put a period on the end of what is happening amen but we got to fully realize we need to fully realize the position fully realize the value what god has given to us this position god has given us should not ever be considered a burden whether we are old we should never say well being a christian is so hard we should just talk my brother and sister of the power of the word we should open our mouth and we ought to declare that i am so thankful i consider it a privilege god would call my name and that he would come and save me and give me an opportunity to serve him we shouldn't ever come to the place that we say well i i don't know i this is so much it's so uh you know intensive i i have to give up or i have to do my brother and sister oh lord help us to realize the value that has been given to us amen remember the story about the violin and the auctioneer just a few dollars but when a master stood up and started to play the violin they realized this violin might have been a little battered it might have a scratch and be a little faded maybe the finish is checked just a little bit but the heart of that violin come out in the hand of a master oh it don't come out with someone that just half-heartedly plays it someone they're just gonna bang around on it but a master my brother and sister will bring it out and the master has come and offered you and i this position isn't this beautiful i'll tell you you talk about value oh it's a greater value than anything that man could ever be given now look this isn't to give us some kind of self-importance not for us to be a permissive people now permissive is a word with several you might say uh uh definitions but the one coming out in this context is not to be a liberal people i'm saved i can do anything you know sometimes that creeps into our house sometimes we let it in ourself the devil don't even have to slip it in the door we drag it in amen but look at this my brother and sister god called you and i the people who can recognize the eternal worth of the gospel to us this is not just about us sacrificing to ourselves i've been preaching to you about dying to ourselves and giving christ preeminence this is not about just dying my brother and sister the monks not the monks the monks the monks look there's people on the face of the earth that daily physically punish themselves you might say to to try to gain god's favor show me in the word of god it's not there but to die to ourself is not to so much torture ourself i i put this in a nutshell it's not so much to to to force ourselves what dying to ourself could be put in a nutshell is we just simply quit listening to the devil you'll die to it because you see the devil doesn't deal with the soul the devil deals with the mind and with the flesh so we can die to ourselves right the scripture tells us to put away our vain imaginations boy i'll tell you what every time i think it's pretty funny i think about this we drive down the boulevard over here and we get to the main intersection down there where where you know the car wash is here and the glasses place and and uh the texas roadhouse on the other side and just beyond the texas roadhouse about 40 feet in the air is the mega lotto sign come on don't tell me you guys have never thought about it what would i do with 500 million dollars probably backslide amen see that just be one more added thing on your plate that you'd have to deal with the devil had come and tell you how smart you was and how good looking you was and how you deserved and maybe god needs to keep us poor amen maybe we need to be a praying lord you know we need some help to get through tomorrow amen you see my brother and sister we come to this place when we recognize the eternal worth of the gospel to us when we start to realize what it is that not everyone on the face of the earth will have the opportunity and feel compelled to respond to the word of god now i just i don't mean to be rude to you but i want to just put you in a spot here to acknowledge yea or nay do you believe god called you or not amen amen if you don't believe god called you then what are we doing here amen but if you believe god called you then recognize the value that come from god calling you amen it's not trivial it's not insignificant it is incredible my brother and sister and if you don't think so you just hold that breath until we get into the white throne judgment and the world comes up in judgment and how they will cry for mercy and you will praise god that he called you and washed filled you with the spirit amen there won't be nobody there saying well you know it was tough no there'll be a lot of rejoicings thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord well maybe we ought to get to the place we thank him a little bit right here right now thank you lord because this eternal value that you have deposited in us lord is not just a a labor a burden it's not an inconvenience amen it's worth more than all amen you know one time saints i had a pretty big calculator at that time i don't remember how many decimal places it was and you know uh uh the the soul is worth ten thousand worlds and it just struck me i don't know of any ever done anything like this so i i went this was you know late enough to been in the world of computers and i went on there and i started down the alphabetical list of the nations of the world and their gdp and i just started adding up their gdp and pretty soon the comp calculator said value to great to display hallelujah one soul value too great to display oh hallelujah that's you and i saints one soul worth of value too great for a computer to display it oh i'm sure there's computers that could go to that but it number grew really really fast amen hallelujah i'm worth more than the whole united states tonight you know brother jason you're worth more than all of canada hallelujah amen sister nadia ukraine belongs to you hallelujah wherever you're from my brother and sister recognize the value that god placed in you today hallelujah it's incredible amen sorry to have to use a carnal thing to express it to you but truly that is the word of god amen oh look as this to recognize the part you know when they have a great show broadway or whatever it might be amen they they have characters and there are people with great talent and they vi compete to be the one who plays a certain part oh my brother and sister if we could recognize in this great drama that we call life that god has come down and said you know what i want to choose you to be a teenager in the year 2020 i want you to be filled with the holy ghost i want you to display me to a world that will mock you and and make fun of you heckle you but i want you to do this because you're mine and i do this because i selected you and then we would look at this and say oh lord it's so hard my circumstance to be a in junior high and high school and to be whatever it's just so difficult stop remind yourself i am privileged that god placed this value in me hallelujah oh remember the word tells us that the lamb wasn't slain on calvary the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and so how long have we been in jesus christ before the foundation of the world amen he knew my brother and sister this is not a game of chance amen he's not he's not rolling dice he's not pulling a card from a deck amen you talk about selection oh hallelujah now look at this when we'll look and recognize the power and the holiness of the world now this will be a little harsh a little critical sounding please forgive me but my brother and sister when you have people who smoke drink dance cheat lie whatever it is and say they're a christian they're denying the power and the holiness of our lord jesus christ amen there's nothing supports that there's nothing but it is oh let us take this right back and wind it back up it is weak pulpits don't want to offend anybody we don't want to make anybody uncomfortable well my brother and sister i imagine the white throne judgment when a man who's lived his life any old willy-nilly way gets called he's going to be really uncomfortable he's going to be wishing you had made him uncomfortable here so he wouldn't have to be uncomfortable there amen so what happens the anointed word now look saints not every sermon i've ever preached to you is anointed you know that well you know how i know you know it because some of you slept right through it hallelujah i love you all now look my brother and sister the truth of it is not every sermon does the minister break through into that anointing and be able to express maybe even just a few hours before the the uh the anointing that was on him but maybe something happens and and that just seems to be bound up and he never really gets into that but i want you to take this and chew on it every time you hear the word of god even if the preacher is not anointed this word is anointed i don't care if the preacher can put you to sleep you've heard those kind before right i don't care if he puts you asleep you got to come to the place you recognize this word is anointed right in the middle of one of them someone crying out to god i just read you the scripture ask anything in my name and i will do it well the preacher wasn't anointed so i just didn't get anything out of church really you need an anointed preacher maybe what you need is an actor or you need something to draw your no come on the value is not in the man holding the book the value is in the book this anointed word will bring a supernatural effect every single time that you approach it as an anointed book amen you appoint approach it is just ink on paper then it is ink on paper to you but when you approach it as a supernatural word amen it will bring about a supernatural effect amen oh i'll tell you what it'll do it'll either move us deeper into the word it'll meet me with move us deeper into our own ideas amen that's what it'll do we'll look at that now i want you to look at the power here for a moment i didn't get much response out of you guys on that hey man hopefully it was just a mouthful and you're chewing on it come on this is not going to be what brother paul can preach or how well brother paul can preach then it would become a talent show but when you approach i approach the word of god as a supernatural word that we have been privileged to have opened and dispensed to us then the power of the word will be unleashed in you and i hallelujah we get so pampered my brother and sister on this good preacher and that good preacher and i won't come to church if this preacher's preaching because you know he just preaches too long or too boring or to this or to that my brother and sister and they wonder why they're not getting anything out of church because they have made this book a dead letter not the preacher not the church not anyone else they themselves have made this a dead letter i refuse to allow this to become a dead letter this book is living it's supernatural stirs my heart every time i read it either to to absolute joy or to repentance hallelujah i don't you know i've come to a place i don't even care if god's correcting me i'm not even like oh oh it's correct to me again it's actually thank you lord thank you lord you're correcting me again amen you're not going to let the air remain in me because i am a supernatural being and the supernatural word was sent to stir the life inside this supernatural being i want to ask you again tonight if you participate is there any supernatural beings here tonight amen or anyone that the power of god has so radically changed your life you're not ashamed of that change hallelujah amen oh hallelujah now let's look at the power here for a minute now it might not seem as though i have really preached to my title but in just a few minutes lord willing i i will get there let's turn to the book of isaiah now actually i didn't want you to read all of that first i wanted to talk to you but i've done it it's all right you see my brother and sister many times we get so comfortable in our skin you might say we get so comfortable in our world you oftentimes ask people well uh you know how long you been a christian i'll have you to know i've been a christian for 40 years or worse they'll say well i've attended such and such church for 40 years but my brother and sister it's really not about the time 40 years of mediocrity is just mediocrity would that be correct i think we should change the matrix by which we measure christianity how many years have you been on fire for god how many wildfires have you left behind you i'm guilty but you know what that come from we haven't been putting enough value on the word of god we read our bible as though it was a book you know my you know my opinion i'll voice it again i guess because i'm here and nobody's going to stop me from voicing it let's just start throwing stuff at me my brother and sister i'm not one of these that is all excited about people who are like yup i read five chapters of the bible in 10 weeks what did you get out of it see we got to stop and ponder that it's not about the quantity but what are we getting from it and if you read it and you are not oh i've said this before but i have to say it again if you are reading it and it is not inspiring you you need to stop and read it again well i didn't really get a whole lot out of jehu doing what he did well it ought to be a lesson in there in fact there's a great lesson in jehu amen it don't matter they build in the walls they they were rebuilding the city rebuilding the temple they were doing this they were doing that my brother and sister it just doesn't seem exciting i'll tell you just an example can i can i just share one example real quick i have read about gideon so many times in my life so many times in my life i've read the story of gideon and there they are on the side of the mountain they're hiding from the midianites trying to hide food they're living in rags because the midianites come and take everything like locust and then one day i'm sitting there reading it i literally said lord there's something here i am missing and i'm reading it again and i i don't know how i miss this the fire come up out of the rock and consumed and it struck me like a load of bricks jesus christ the representation of the word the rock was right there in his midst all the time god was with him all the time and it was an inconvenience it was something to hide behind it was something i remember it just struck me and right behind that another scripture come and i went and turned in my bible and i was like there it is there it is this has been many years ago i was like here he is he's the rock in the wilderness he was the rock here he was the rock there he was a rock rocks from the middle of the jordan that made the altar for sacrifice all of it just tied together so and all of a sudden you get excited it's like wow this book is living this is this is good stuff or yeah okay i mean it's just perfectly normal isn't it brother jason that you set something down you're putting a fleece before the lord you set something down on the rock and fire comes out of the rock and just consumes it i mean i happens four or five times a week but you know what happens the supernatural in our midst is so common to us come on saints i want you to think that supernatural is so common we've got to we're up god healed somebody ah no big deal we ought to be stopping and saying thank you lord thank you lord we live in a world where half of the world is afraid of every little virus and every little bug i mean you've no doubt all saw the deals that you know i just saw one here the other day it listed everything that's happened in the last 40 years it was going to kill all of us do you guys realize now i'll forget the dates but you guys realize it's a like in the 70s we were going into the ice age amen we were going to all be like the wooly mammoth they're going to find us frozen a rock peanut butter and jelly sandwich in one hand and they're going to be going what is that yeah come on we ain't got nothing to be afraid of the scripture says that we are sealed until the day of our redemption and if i keeled over with a heart attack right now saints you guys would all be going oh my goodness brother paul just died right in front of us but i sealed to the day of my redemption hey man it don't matter how god chooses to take us ain't got nothing to be afraid of amen hallelujah look i'll tell you about this years ago i had a friend live in san diego and his mother-in-law and sister-in-law and a cousin were sitting in a house when an airliner fell out of the sky and there was no more house my brother and sister what are you going to hide from where are you going to hide nowhere i'm gonna hide in christ hallelujah i'm gonna hide in the word oh now let me get going here this plate this little plate i had is so big in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and above it stood the seraphims and each one had six wings with twain he covered his face with twain he covered his feet with twain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory well that's of course wasn't where we lived because god just ain't doing nothing in our neighborhood hmm and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said now this is the prophet isaiah my brother and sister and i want you to understand we get comfortable in our skin and here is the prophet isaiah amen as a prophet priest he has become used to doing the things of god as god would command him he was faithful you'll find nowhere that isaiah was a blatant sinner stepping off of the word outside of the boundaries of the word but it becomes such commonplace to him influenced by those around him and here he is as a man of god still doing the word of god the word doesn't call him backslid doesn't call him a devil doesn't say he's got a devil on him but here he is now in this vision and he is seeing this come to pass and in this he's there and he says whoa is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts oh my brother and sister oh i tonight i just i guess if i could express it maybe i'm not getting the right words out to you but my brother and sister how it is that we as believers as as christians and we have the word of god we've got the life of god i believe every one of us could stop and say god's done something supernatural that i can speak of healing me delivering me providing for me and we come so commonplace to this are we living worldly lives no we're not are we doing uh evil things or we're not liars we're not thieves we're not doing this but we've fallen into a pattern where we would take the word of a man over the word of god the word of a a doubter or a negative person would influence us whether to come up and claim healing or just simply stand in our sea and say lord it's your word that by your stripes i am healed period i claim it but we'll let the naysayer well you know when you get this and the doctor has a better medicine and this is going to do my brother and sister i say we have seen the lord of hosts we have seen him his train has filled the temple and the earth is full of his glory and we'll sit right here and come to a place that we are immobile we are paralyzed to it but i would ask tonight if god by his grace we could be like the prophet isaiah and recognize god is here and look at that and say whoa unto me woe is me amen i have seen god and what did he do the isaiah prophet isaiah he comes to a place that he repents here oh forgive me i'm so excited i can't really contain myself amen he's repenting he's declaring woe is me i'm undone amen i'm a man of unclean lips i repent lord and i dwell with people oh my goodness i just called you guys unclean well hallelujah in the right context i hope you can lift a hand and say oh lord amen lord that's us lord then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he'd taken with tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged what was this the fire amen right from the altar of almighty god my brother and sister we don't have to have an angel with a a a coal off the altar tonight we got the holy ghost and would it come in our midst oh you say out brother paul do you think we're all backslid no i'm not i just think we can be purged by the power and the fire of the altar of god a closer consecrated walk than we've ever walked before am i asking too much because you see it goes further than this amen touched his lips and i heard the voice of god saying whom shall i sin and who will go for us and something stirred in the heart of isaiah then said i here am i send me amen amen oh saints look at this go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not see you indeed but perceive not make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed see how thankful you ought to be some's eyes were made not to see some ears were made not to hear some hearts were made so heavy they can't receive it but not you amen you realize the value of what god has placed in you that we could be in that position but god chose for you to be in this position there's many my brother and sister they don't even really care whether there's a god or not that's right i was reading a book it was a history sister sue got me about world war ii and this man is recounting a certain situation and even in the book i i actually set the book down and i can't decide whether to finish reading it or not there's so much cursing in the book but the man's describing how he jumped out of an airplane on at normandy and how his buddies are getting shot up by the the germans shooting them up as they're floating down in the parachute and many of them falling so heavy laden it takes a few minutes to unstrap the straps so they could even get up and the germans just coming by shooting them on the ground and he said here i am he said you know and he's using all kinds of curse words going along this and the lord's name in vain and all this and he said there i was praying dear god let me live you see there's a misunderstanding my brother and sister that we can use the lord's name in vain and have no reverence to him and then want him to come on the scene and save my life now the man no doubt feels like that his life was saved and god answered his prayer because he lived through the whole war through very bloody very bloody things but you see my brother and sister we have to place a value on presence of jesus christ in our life you know i've got some other things to read but this is going to carry on tonight far too long ah live tired go to bed tired get up tired let me just hurry through it you see my brother and sister i never have preached i preached it down in phoenix uh their evening light but you see for every action there has to be a reaction and i would pray as we would look here and see how the power of god this come upon isaiah so strongly that he declared this is a prophet of god saints i hope that drives home to you not some common street guy is prophet of god and it come upon him so strongly that he says woe is me for i'm undone he realized how in the presence of god that his life was not uh uh uh um uh oh i'm just at loss for words his life was not he was not clean enough he he just felt dirty you might say in in before the lord and and so it comes upon him now my brother and sister for every action there has to be a reaction and i would pray tonight that there would be some constant reaction to this action not just like having a revival you know where the preacher the really good evangelist comes and preaches so strongly and so hard that moves everybody to the altar and they cry out forgive me lord forgive me lord get up and go right back to their life my brother and sister that's not what we need to do we need to recognize the value that god has given us and we need to come to a place whether it's here there yawn in the closet in the car on the ditch bank whatever it is well woe is me lord forgive me i live maybe a little two lakhs of a life amen you see it ought to be a constant reaction every reading of the word of god every time in prayer ought to be a lord if there's something in my life rooted out lord if there be something that you're not pleased with take it from me lord amen you might say a continuum as it were amen a continuum my brother and sister while this is not mathematical but something that would just come and continue it don't matter in a continuum you can have changing uh numbers you can have changing things but my brother and sister we live this word here you can say well that's 2 000 years old brother paul but i'm telling you it's the same god the same word and a different world out here but the same power that was there my brother and sister is sufficient it was sufficient then amen aren't you aren't you glad you weren't daniel come on a lot of 20th century 21st century christians would have quit praying oh this sounds a little strong doesn't it but i believe it's the truth they said well we can worship in secret just as well no what did daniel do this is the window this is where i pray i don't care what they say i'm gonna pray oh nice to meet you mr lyon daniel just went down there pranced right up to the lion tickled him pulled his whiskers rubbed his ears well that's how they tell the story now no sir i think from the very second that they said daniel you're being sentenced to the lion's den he was in travail before god lord thy will be done you imagine a heart of that say i'm fixing to become lion food lord thy will be done but also think about what it would be to be nailed to a cross no less painful actually probably much quicker to go in the lion's den as a carnal man a few swipes over but they had enough courage and they recognized the power of god in them but daniel said lord if this is the end so be it well i'll tell you my brother and sister i've seen a artist's depiction of of uh the lion's den which supposedly was so totally historically correct these lions you wouldn't want to bend that lion because them lions were scrawny they were hungry they were angry they were looking for their next meal they want some plump lying laying down there i'll tell i'll play with him like a cat with a mouse for a little bit no sir they were like that's food i want it but god come down because he knew the value he placed in daniel and the work was not done amen but if daniel had showed fear well we can't go there because he didn't but you see fear paralyzes fears what causes you not to pray when you know you should fear is what holds you back from claiming the promise hallelujah i've been rude enough tonight i guess i should move on see we're in a different time but it's still the same reaction see there's power in the name of jesus now i want to just share a quote with you i think it's really good myself hopefully it stimulates you like it stimulated that me i mean and that same power that same christ hallelujah let the fundamentals let them people who deny the power of god say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the holy ghost well right i just read you the scripture earlier amen that's right men and women it's time that we found out who you are the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little cow down something boy i mean that's what he works at my brother and sister well i just know i should i need to call the pastor call the pastor i don't mind you call the pastor call the pastor that's fine but the pastor is going to encourage you to pray about it all right you pray the prayer of faith a pastor's prayer of faith might influence you to claim something but how about you pray the prayer of faith claim something for yourself hallelujah reminds me of a story true story back east this preacher got in trouble with his denomination because he was encouraging his church he said i won't preach about you buying lottery tickets if you share it with me that must have made it better right god wouldn't have cared they were gambling because the preacher condoned it weak pulpit amen we're not little cow down things the word of god it said it we believe it we're gonna live it amen amen you're not a little cow down something you're not you are sons and daughters of god the deity is not in heaven it's in you hallelujah i know you think i'm crazy but let me tell you something brother brother knocks on the pulpit when you realize that almighty god lives in you immortal life my life i give zoe the life of god is in the human being amen we're not just talking about some kind of story and we're not talking about some theoretical thing we're talking about the word of god he said i would be with you even in you hallelujah amen amen you know it all depends on whose version of christianity you're listening to they've got jesus christ there's everything from some kind of perverted lifestyle to a a marxist socialist they've got him living on the wrong side of the tracks they've got a living whatever my brother and sister you see when they do those kind of things they're not placing value on who he is that's right and when they place that behavior and say that they have him in their life they're testifying then that his life was of sub-par value you know what i'd rather do i'm not much of a cheerleader they would have never let me been a cheerleader but what i'd like to do is just come down and cheerlead you if i could to change your vocabulary to testify i'm worth ten thousand worlds i've got the power of god i've got the grace of god i've got the glory of god i've got the holiness of god it's all in me amen oh but that just sounds way too pompous in the world of understated christianity that we have now hallelujah i've got the holy ghost how do you know that got the holy ghost i go serve in a soup kitchen real quote real quote i'm not making that up i'm serving the people so i've got the holy ghost my brother and sister the holy ghost is the life that is in that word living through you amen it's not an action you do because there's men that give tens of thousands of dollars i've shared that story about that rich guy in kansas that donated money to all them churches because he knew that the principle of paying tithe and giving to the church worked and so he didn't even believe in god but he donated money to the church and people said he's such a comments and stuff he's such a good christian the man right in the article denies that he even believes in jesus christ and they say he's such a nice christian because he helps these people come on come on oh my i got you all thoroughly disappointed tonight remember what i said to you this is supernatural so you can go home and say you've seen the supernatural tonight hallelujah and i don't see that just to be funny now i want to close with one last quote here amen sister emmy would you come the piano louis i like this i think we can all say amen to that jesus alone can lead you to that eternal life there's no church no denomination no preacher no peace priest no nothing else can lead you to it you must be led by him the only one that can lead you could you imagine him leading you out of his word which that's him amen and if he is the word and you're part of him won't you be a part of the word the word that god wants to pour the waters of salvation upon today to identify him today like the apostles identify him like luther like wesley like in the people in them days identified him this is another age it's the word the word said these things that we're seeing taking place now is predicted to take place in this hour so accept jesus christ and let him lead you to eternal life it all comes back to our lord jesus oh since somebody say thank you lord hallelujah amen in the meantime saints i want you to look in the mirror if you would just appease me and i want you to look in the mirror and remind yourself of your true value in jesus christ you see we won't get on to those things but deity has to have a dwelling place amen god could be anywhere he wanted to be but he chose to be and you and i my that ought to get us excited oh my he chose me hallelujah well you know we all have insecurities and i wasn't a bad baseball player when i was younger but i wasn't the best and i can remember that we'd be playing some baseball and it'd get right down you talk about keeping you humble as a kid get right down there's always just one extra kid it seemed like and when it come to the last player to be chose it was me or him you know what it felt like to be chose even being the last one chose there was something special but i got a complex even as a kid over and i started apologizing to the other kid and i tell him look i'll trade innings with you because i felt bad i realized i didn't know better than him they just liked me better he was kind of a cranky kid [Music] and i say that because i don't know why god chose me i don't know why he chose you but he did and let's put value in that let's lift him up and put him in that place of preeminence that he desires to be in let's not put god as secondary to our life we're doing this and we're doing this and i've got this and i'm busy and i've got a job and i've got a vacation and i need no let's put the real value in jesus christ brother jason would you come and lead us a song or two i have to tell you we were in the back i asked brother jason to pray for the service tonight and he prayed my notes and i told him he scares me uh he was just there in prayer and he just started speaking in the prayer and i was just utterly amazed amen i tell you my brother and sister i might have sounded a little harsh this evening forgive me i'm not but i think as i study as i read as i listen i think the value that we should be placing on our lord jesus christ is slowly diminishing i think that people have have just placed less value on it now than they did just a few short years ago [Music] i won't go there my i just need to stop amen lead us in a song or two brother jason there is power [Music] there is power in the name of jesus there is power in the name of jesus to break every chain break every chain break every chain oh there is power in the nave of jesus there is there is to break every chain break every chain break every chain hallelujah hallelujah now if it seemed like i was a little direct tonight maybe it'll make some of you feel better if i tell you i was just preaching to myself hallelujah hallelujah brother jason lead us in some songs why don't we stand let's sing that song he leadeth me [Music] heavenly [Music] still god's hand that leadeth me he leadeth me he leadeth me by his own hand he leadeth me his faithful followers [Music] [Music] sometimes [Music] see still ties his hand and needed me he leadeth [Music] his faith [Music] [Applause] [Music] whatever lord i see
