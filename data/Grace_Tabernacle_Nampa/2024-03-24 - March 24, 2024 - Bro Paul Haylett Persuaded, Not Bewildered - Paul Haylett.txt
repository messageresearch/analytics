amen sister miam trust that your trip to see family and your mother went well and U let's remember brother Trevor sister Carrie uh I believe probably coming home tomorrow uh time with their family and you know as we look around amongst this body of Believers let's let's just remember to pray for one another amen you know we we just we're not going to make it very far if we're trying to stand on our own but we're part of a body of Believers and and uh you know you don't always have to like your family but you have to love them and uh so you know just let's be faithful to one another you know let's just remember uh just thinking about our brother gyrus uh their little group over there in southern Southwest Oregon there um I forget what town they're in Roseberg Oregon just remember uh them wonderful people and uh Lord just lift them up give them strength and and encouragement [Music] amen Amen brother Jose sister sephi send their greetings we were visiting with brother Jose yesterday and uh they just desire to send their greetings and to be remembered in prayer and uh so just a few things on our heart today the Lord would be gracious to allow us to speak I want to speak on the thought of persuaded not bewildered amen and this kind of comes out a little bit of something the prophet said and not a little bit it comes out of what the prophet said amen not a little bit but it is and uh let's turn in our Bibles to the Book of Romans thank you musicians such love lovely music amen Romans the 4th chapter veres 20- 25 and as we look at this uh we just want to uh take this thought as Paul is speaking to the Romans he's making reference to Abraham and uh we have to remember that we are Abraham's spiritual seed and so when the word spoke and was given out that it would be as the Sands of the seashore he was not talking as it were in a direct lineage of a natural manifestation but talking in a spiritual element and um I think I declare that we are here today as Abraham seed amen we are here because of Revelation am it's open to us it's alive to us the promise is our promise and we need to have the confidence to stand up and claim it as our promise amen I believe everything that God LED brother brandham to reveal or touch on CU let's think about this for just a moment how much of this Bible did the prophet actually preach I like that answer all of it but there's literally upon the thousands of scriptures he never touched that's right but he preached all of the word amen so we'll find that the Bible now these kind of thinking would cause some people to say what's wrong with this guy but you know the Bible is a very repetitive book you see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he didn't come along to Le oysa and say I need to write a whole new chapter I need to write a whole new deal it's a different age it's a different circumstance it's a different people I need to do something now he knew the word that was in the beginning would be sufficient for the middle and the end and we are here today as a recipients of that word so while we may In Our Lifetime not hear every scripture of the Bible preached we have all of the word amen isn't that wonderful Romans 4:20 through2 he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God now certainly my brother and sister God was thinking about you and I amen this is who we are in the day that we live in right we're not going to stagger at the promise amen with unbelief but we're strong in faith and we give glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now now it was not written for his sake Alone um by I can't hardly read my own not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification Heavenly Father we ask for your blessing upon the word today touch each life those present those not present father you know every circumstance we ask you Lord to deal kindly let our lives father be anointed Lord to respond to the word to manifest every word of God for our day every life father Lord we thank you in your name amen you may be seated to be persuaded is to be caused to believe and we look at this and the Apostle Paul speaking of these promises concerning Abraham which were not just to Abraham but to were you and I H it is that we truly can today can say we're fully persuaded now if we were persuaded by a man if someone come and laid out such a very carefully crafted uh Direction Through the word of God and laid that out and you were persuaded that what he had just laid out before you was the truth uh without Revelation without anointing of the Holy Spirit another man could come and equally well present something that would persuade you and it is there that we stand here as in verse 21 fully persuaded is because this did not come to the flesh man that did not come to our intellect it did not come to our knowledge but it come by revelation of who we are just as it was with Abraham he come now when you read the word and you look at Abraham's life you'll see that there were things in Abraham's life that we would stop and say but but that seemed like he was questioning or he dis believed or he whatever but God was looking down below the level that man can look and knew that down in the depths of Abraham's heart he was fully persuaded amen that it was not the flesh's reaction you know In the Flesh they have this uh this theorem if you would call it it's called Fight or Flight and you'll see that in the personality of human nature that some people they will avoid controversy uh no matter what at all cost and others uh when they are threatened as it were they rise up and they're going to stand their ground and you'll see that my brother and sister that it is in the human nature that we'll find how God can look beyond that nature Can someone say thank you Lord look beyond that nature and see who we really are underneath that we might be one that would not want to stand in controversy until it comes to the day that we can't back up up when we have to stand Satan would say boo we say boo right back to him because we can't back up amen it might have been that we were a certain way the entirety of our life but the day comes that God puts us into circumstance and there's something in us and I say thank you Lord for Faith amen that we can stand on the word and say I'm no longer backing up I'm going to stand right here it is not about whether we've made mistakes or not it's not about how smart we are or Rich we are or whatever it is but it's God looking down through the very depths of our humanity and knowing what he has placed in us and I say thank you Lord for what you have placed in US amen hallelujah acts 26- 28 we see here Paul is speaking to Agrippa fesus and others that were there in the court and we see how that he is there the scripture says that he's persuading them he's speaking to them concerning these things and Agrippa said unto Paul almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian now my brother and sister AG gria could not be persuaded because he did not have that seed Gene in him to believe but I tell you how convincing uh the Apostle Paul was in his preaching and witnessing testimony of of the word was even an unbeliever was Almost Persuaded to believe that's a powerful testimony that's a power and demonstration of the holy spirit in their midst that an unbeliever would be there saying I am right on the very borderline of believing what you're saying but what he would have finished if he would was there's just nothing in me to go ahead and take that and make the next step it's not there I can't do it but when you look at this we see they thought that by much learning it had caused Paul to be almost mad they looked at him and what were they looking at they weren't looking at a man that was crazy in his behavior but they were looking at a man that was so on fire so convinced so uh uh revelated in the idea and it was so real now my brother and sister I believe that that what was done was partly because uh the Apostle Paul his testimony his sincerity was so powerful that they couldn't help but believe it they saw that it was real they saw it was a passion it wasn't just religion it was real amen and they were there looking at that and they knew there was something behind that because as it were the fire of humanity cannot burn that bright without something behind it feeding the fire amen and they also Paul's reply to them and I really like this this was not done in a corner my brother and sister I want you to think about this we live in a world right now unfortunately breaks my heart many people have come and gone through the years many people have said this is not for me and went on into a a whole different life but my brother and sister regardless of what others have chose to do what God did in your life what he did in my life was not done in a corner he did this right out in the open amen we never glorify those things but there was the unbeliever and the make believer the drunk and the Harlot and everything you can think of and God changed their lives and those who knew that life knew there was a true and honest change it was not just a coding of religion which is a covering but it was the truth a life that had come forth and it's there that God said I don't need to hide in the corner I will make it a public display I don't need to do uh uh things in such a fashion to to just make them kind of camouflaged in the world I'm going to call you to be set apart I'm going to call you to stand out I'm going to call you to be awkward to this world I'm going to call you to be something different and my brother and sister this is God not allowing the word to hide in the corner but every grocery store visit every time here and every time there wherever you're at God's putting you the bride of Christ on display because it's not going to be in a corner it's going to be alive it's going to be well and it's going to be out before them hallelujah amen you see my brother and sister I I'll just if I can go on a rant for just a moment is it okay just for a moment brief moment my brother and sister you know I've mentioned in this church before that sometimes I become a little bit uncomfortable with the the terminology we're believers we're Believers in what the Buddhist is a Believer name any religion you want they're Believers amen and even the word Christian has become very generic but it's who we are amen amen I don't care how many false Christians there are there's Christians on the earth and we're not in a corner we're out in the open we're in the work place we're in the family we're in the store that we're wherever because God said I'm going to have real people that are going to be like me amen I I don't need to hang a tag on them because when you look at this I know this is going to sound bad for me but when you look at this brother brandham talks about how when when Jesus calls them and they're there they won't be identified as Nazarene and Baptist and Methodist and this and that my brother and sister and we won't be identified as message we'll be identified by our relationship that we have with Jesus Christ and Christ Alone amen there is no umbrella called message that we're going to hide under my brother and sister it is that personal relationship and when Paul stood before a grippa fesus and all of them and started testifying of Jesus Christ he didn't point to a church he pointed to the Lord Jesus Christ he said that's who I follow that's who has anointed my life that's my protection that's that's my strength that's my provider and he can be yours too agria and it was so powerful AG grippa was like you almost got me here I'm almost ready to accept this but wait I've got position I've got Authority I've got an image I must uphold I'll tell you there's an image I want to uphold amen the image Amen in the very likeness of Jesus Christ the word that is spoken the word from the original coming right down Through the Ages coming alive in every generation Can someone say thank you Lord that it's alive in every generation it didn't say I don't know what I can do in the middle I'll just skip to the end no sir every generation's had a true witness every Generations had its a grippa yes sir and this generation is not Exempted there's got to be someone with revelation and sincerity filled with the Holy Ghost that stand in this generation and witness Jesus Christ in the same Authority we believe the Apostle Paul was called as a prophet uh Apostle to that age right that's who he was but my brother and sister what Christ poured in him he's poured in you amen amen he didn't have a different different thing for their day so what God has done is poured into us in this day the power of the word living word that has brought it alive that we can can have that same influence we can have that same uh uh presentation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and my brother and sister it isn't our flowery words it isn't our education and all the big words that we could use and do whatever it's a life and when that life is on display even the devil can't argue with that life amen but we got to look be on flesh amen that's right you know when the scripture said if our hearts condemn us not it wasn't just talking about a superficial thing my brother and sister when your heart knows who you are amen not your mind that's right when your heart knows who you are then you have confidence to put Christ on display no we're not putting Christ on display when we hand out a book sir you are the display amen amen I just love that very very infatuated as I study this thought out about it not being done in a corner I I I I love this I I recently read a little deal was a criticism of the message it's strange that you can find satisfaction reading that because one person writes and says you don't have to worry about them there's only a few of them around Jeffersonville and I was like isn't amazing what God can do he'll hide them all over the world in plain sight amen hiding Us in plain sight amen so much so that people I was at a wedding sister Jerry and I went to a a wedding a funeral H they're both the same [Laughter] sorry about that we were in a funeral yesterday and had many many ex- Believers there people I grew up with people I knew for years and okay I'm not even going to put a prefigure this is not judgmental I'm just going to say it some of them were just talking about about how wonderful their life is I'm not even going to paint a picture for you of what their life looks like right now they're just telling me how wonderful their life is but there's nothing about the Wonder on display yeah it I visited with a lady she never she her sister was in the message at one time she was there lovely lady very lovely lady and as we're visiting she goes well how do you know my sister and I said well it goes all the way back into my childhood and this and she suddenly her eyes of understanding start to open now what do you guys follow what wasn't it some little book yes it's called the Bible oh I believe the Bible me too amen me too you see what is promoted what is presented what is offered up can be construed as what you believe that's right let me put it to you this way what you believe came directly out of the word of God amen amen not man's ideas not man's presentation amen what would we have to offer today to AG gria so and so said oh King Agrippa so and so said and this one over here said and this one thought this no sir the Apostle Paul's standing there in front of AR grippa he is presenting Jesus Christ nothing but Christ he's not offering an antidotal type of a sermon not an antidotal type of thought he is offering a fresh view at Jesus Christ not a a a history not something in the future he's off offing something very present right at the moment for them to look at and say this is what's real and this is what is coming to pass and this is what is prophesied and you need to believe it and it was powerful enough to change the point of view of AG grippa except for there was nothing in him to hold to it so my brother and sister it has come amen that God today is not doing it in a corner he's doing it right out in the open he's doing it right in the face of the world today he's doing it in such a fashion but look I want to present this to you in a in a nice kind way my brother and sister the word said that their eyes would be dimmed and their hearing would be dull and it's there that you have people good sincere people but they just can't grasp that there's a higher calling they cannot grasp that God has something more for them they cannot grasp that there is a life beyond this life right here they speak the words they talk about it they make reference to it but without a revelation because if a grippa could manufacture Revelation he would have went down in scripture as a Believer but he couldn't that's right and in the world today my brother and sister there is this whole presentation of what it is and and you know they they would talk of being persuaded but how come they're bewildered how come they're bewildered my brother and sister you can talk about the word and yet they will say um now do I remember um the Bible does say something about prophets if you read your Bible you know it says something about Prophets You don't have to guess but you see because of the age that we live in the hearing the vision they're just like a grippa right they're almost persuaded amen they almost are ready to step over the line and make a full commitment but but can't quite do it amen I think we have something to praise the Lord for today can we just give the Lord a little thank you thank you Lord Jesus amen we come face to face with that word and we weren't Almost Persuaded we were completely totally persuaded this is God's word and here is our foundation and here is the promise and I'm claiming the promise every bit of that promise my promise amen amen amen and then God puts you out takes you out of the corner you know personality wise a lot of us would just like hang out in the corner corner quietly we wouldn't put ourselves out but God knows how to put us out amen God knows how to put a love for friends neighbors people he puts a love in there and the love is what causes you to step out like Apostle Paul I can say this morning Apostle Paul loved Agrippa and he loved him enough to give the word to him amen had an individual not that long ago talked to me about where's the line of us putting the word the Pearl before the swine and we have to stop and think about that we're like well they're unbelievers they're unbelievers I don't want to put put the word out there because you don't know that's right you don't know if the man's Blasphemous you don't put the word in front of a Blasphemous angry man but my brother and sister let God do that sorting follow the leadership right be instant in the season but you know to be instant in the season we have to be in tune with the one who is the season and if we aren't in tune with the one who is a season we'll go I don't know if I should have or I shouldn't have you should have a confidence to know whether you should or shouldn't you should have a confidence Lord are you leading me to speak and be able to have a confidence that I was called to share this gospel to live this gospel to be a convincer a Persuader amen because you got to realize taking this from this scripture you can't convince a grippa if agrippa's got nothing to be convinced of Amen no don't go throw the word out front of them to watch them tear it apart and throw it in the trash but don't be afraid Amen to plant the seed amen I have a beautiful analogy but I'll refrain from using it amen see if you're going to cause someone to believe then you leave out all of the other factors that are in Scripture predestination Revelation so if I can just convince amen I get them in the mail all the time I don't know if any maybe it's just because of the church or I don't know but I get these flyers all the time maybe you do the giant postcards we're holding a deal down here at this convention center uh you know come we're going to give you Revelation I thought about going because I wouldn't mind having more Revelation I want to see just what they had to give but then I flipped the card over and read the backside and I should be a featured speaker at their conference because they are coming oh this sounds bad but they're coming and they are giving them milk we're meat people aren't we amen we're meat people amen not strong milk not strong you know but meat my brother and sister the meat is for the mature and and God does that and I'm not TR do a rally rally thing this morning but I want you to understand how far God has brought you down this road of Revelation it is not just a beginning it's not just a first step you are far down the road of Revelation because God said you will be ready when I come you will be filled with the word you'll have the life you'll have the nature you'll have the love you'll have it all when I come cuz I have not missed a one I will not miss a one and God is there powerful the devil's just got a lot of distractions do you guys ever get distracted amen you know here here recently I I only use this for an example But Here recently I I got down to the end of the day and I thought my I haven't done anything and then I was like oh I was supposed to return a call to so and so and I started scrolling back through my phone uh that's probably oldfashioned way to do it but that's how Paul does it you know scrolling back 41 phone calls in one day no wonder I didn't get anything thing done some of them were friends and I was probably guilty of yakking too long but still my brother and sister isn't amazing that when we can get right on the custom of getting something from the lord the devil has all kinds of distraction he just takes a bucket full of distractions and pours them out on the floor amen when I was a kid I had quite a few of them Jacks you know the little the little star things with the little balls on the ends you know I had quite a collection of those Jacks and and then um my dad got up in the middle of the night one night and I didn't clean him up like I was supposed to and by the next morning I had no Jacks amen because when my dad stepped in the first one you know you take the next Quick Step and there was more Jacks there and by the time he got done with that at middle of the night he turned the light on took out a broom and my Jacks disappeared now my brother and sister that's what Satan's doing to you and I he's dumping out all kinds of distractions to keep us from coming with a confidence because our time is consumed in other factors other things and our lives are consumed with we have this stress we have that stress you know what most of that is most of us called Drama any of you have courage enough to admit you have drama in your life yeah drama yeah the devil loves drama he loves drama my brother and sister God deals in facts amen God doesn't deal in drama God deals in facts and Paul is talking to a grippa and and he's laying out the list of facts and not one of those facts was attend our church and you'll make it not one fact was there if you will just be our friend you'll be okay every one of those facts was rooted in Jesus Christ having died and resurrected amen and was living forever more and that was something that they could not quite grasp it's something that maybe even we could admit without God we could not Gras but the word my brother and sister cannot live in a realm of unbelief it cannot live in the realm of death it cannot live in a realm where the resurrection is not first and foremost amen amen amen that's right we talk about Easter celebrate the resurrection my brother and sister we should be celebrating the resurrection every single day of Our Lives amen he's raised us from death unto life hallelujah amen and I can say today I'm so glad God came to my corner amen amen not just that we came to church but God came to us right brother brand lays it out very clearly no man has come to God but God comes to man amen and I'm glad he came to my corner I'm glad he came to my household I'm glad he came to my life because without that the devil would be here saying I'll let you be cloaked in your religion I'll let you be cloaked in what you think you believe I'll let you be cloaked in anything uh that pertains to that world but if you don't have an absolute anchor and it's not there I don't have to worry about you you'll be the shock brother Brandon put it this way the drunk will not be shocked that he gets sent to Hell amen the unbeliever will not be shocked but it will be the make believer the guy who thought by attending church the guy who thought by the fact he believed a certain thought that it would be okay that's the one that's the one that'll be shocked and I'm glad my brother and sister God came to our corner and said I'm going to show you what real faith is I'm going to show you what real power in the word is I'm going to show you the formula for having your prayers answered I'm going to show you for the path that you will walk and it's going to get narrower and narrower and narrower and narrower and sometimes we get uncomfortable with how narrow God has called us to walk but my brother and sister lift up your eyes your redemption's drawing nigh amen he's called us to walk that way he's made it possible he's given us the strength and the vision amen amen that's right or we can settle for religion no sir sir I want to be careful what I'm saying don't get too carried away but I'll tell you my brother and sister in some parts of the country divorce and the ranks of marriage people is equal to the world exactly right can someone offer a reason why oh King AG grippa our pastor says oh King of grippa the Bible says but by experience they've never seen it happen oh king of gria God's real amen and he's here amen and the same signs that he performed is still here they haven't left there's still a holy ghost there's still a word there's still a life and there's still a people that are going to hold on to this word and not depart from it a grippa you can throw us in prison you can torture us you can do whatever you want but we're still believers amen amen sometimes it's good for us reminds me maybe this makes sense maybe it don't but it reminds me one time of this lady true story she had all these beautiful roses and she said I'm going to tear my roses out and I was working with a guy who built retaining walls and stuff and and and uh hard labor you know but we we would go in and and do these things and and he's telling him what will you just tear my roses out and he like they're beautiful roses why do you want them tore out every time I get around the Roses when I get around the Roses I break out in hives and the first thought was well maybe you're allergic to roses but the man I work for goes out to all these huge rose beds and there's poison ivy growing everywhere in the midst of the Roses now I hope you follow me without a deeper look it's the Rose's fault and the prophet of God said the devil goes to church yes sir so without a deeper look that's right we'll think it's something about church that's it amen but the devil's in the midst amen the poison ivy was in the mid guess who got to cut all the poison ivy out of those rose bushes yes it was okay if Paul did that but it was fine the little old lady you know was just so so happy she was overjoyed she loved her roses but with a false conclusion she was going to get God out of her life it's a conversation I had with a lady yesterday she looked me in the eye and said Paul I'm trying to get God back in my life life can I speak stronger don't try do that's it don't try do that's right don't try to love your neighbor do that's it amen don't try to be in the word do that's right don't try to be faithful in the house of God do maybe that's straightforward forgive me but it's truth amen amen see what God's doing today wasn't done in a corner don't you love that I went on the internet the other day and just typed in brother bram's name it's a very interesting thing the very first things to show up were he was a good man but went off oh he he was a Deceiver he was this go ahead just move down a page or two and you start to read headlines of healing Deliverance urrent we're not talking about 50 years ago 60 years ago 70 years ago we're talking about now amen but you see the devil to those who won't dig in how many of you ever studied that way before maybe for a class had to write a paper surely I wasn't the only one I don't know if they call it plagiarizing when you just write down the very words right out of an encyclopedia word for word it used to work but you see God did not call us to confusion or chaos that's right God called us to the word that's right amen he called us to be persuaded and it's not what somebody else says about it but I stand here as we can say today devil you're too late we have heard the word we have believed the word and we've saw the word come in action in our life he's our healer he's our deliverer he's our provider he's our peace and comfort he's everything Can someone say Amen to that this morning it's too late devil amen and no matter who spoke to AG grippa Agrippa looked Paul in the eyes and knew that what Paul was sharing was the truth because he was sincere in the word amen and so it is that it come to our corner and I'm glad it came to where we are amen now to some it comes as confusion to some it comes as chaos I have confusion in my life I have chaos in my life but it didn't come from the word that's right are you with me amen the confusion and Chaos in my life did not come from God did not come from this message amen it come from the devil amen amen and he's there in causing this chaos and confusion amen he's trying to distract us he cannot do away with the truth as I spoke in the church here recently my brother and sister you'll see all through the message through the scripture how that it was there in heaven the very thing that got Lucifer was the fact that he wanted to be at or higher than the word he wanted a preeminence on attention attraction the praise our Lord Jesus Christ he's standing there on the earth and he could have easily have said worship me when an angel come spoke to John they start to bow down what does he tell them worship God that's right that's what I want you to do I want you to stop all this I want you to worship God Amen a prophet stood in this day and he's there and people started to worship and lift him up make deity out of him which is not all that far removed amen and neither is it to say that you are deity all that far removed amen but he says no I am not amen I am not who you're trying to make me out to be he tried to get them to stop all they did is just went underground and created their own deal still exists today that Spirit took root and still exists today where people are willing to accept the exaltation of other men and women and they feel good about that I'm telling you my brother and sister there is a point that you can say thank you for the compliment but it's nothing but God it's not us it's not you it's Christ in you the hope of glory that's the only thing that we can accomplish is opening the door and letting Christ in that he becomes the preeminent part of our life and when he becomes that preeminent part we'll stand and see great things amen we'll see the power of God answered prayer mothers amen Housewives amen why the prophet of God said your prayer is just as effective Ive as his prayer was why because it's the same God it's not a god of yesterday and we're not looking at a God that's going to appear in the future we're talking about the very God that stood on the platform when a prophet was in a prayer line and he said he is here my brother and sister you can stand in your kitchen and make the same declaration he is here and I believe in and my prayer is sincere and my motive is correct he will answer that prayer and we can stand with confidence on the word amen that's right that's right because the idea that some have that we would have to go back to a prophet don't misunderstand me we got to go back to a profet to get this my brother and sister if brother brandom appeared on the Earth today they would hand you a number like you do when you go to the hardware store and it would have a million something will be your turn but when you have a need does anyone have a need today when you have a need you don't need to draw a number you've got a direct line to the throne room you can stand up and say my God Amen They Crucified him but he rose and he's living again and he's living in me Hallelujah I have a direct line to that throne room and I can stand here right now and say Lord I have need I got a sick child I got a strain in my relationship in my family in whatever it is oh Lord I need help and he's right on this scene hallelujah amen amen yeah isn't it amazing how God came he came as revealed word amen that's it that's so anti-climax some people can't hardly just deal with that amen people will tell you oh no for the bride to get raptured we need something special to happen and that is we need a Revival in the church we need a repentance and we need a Revival there's our something special we need to get back to the word we need to get back to A Life That's consecrated and devoted and we place God in the first and the foremost they'll be our something my brother and sister you see he came as a revealed word and people just Overlook that no our church says oh you think that's only my brother and sister sorry to speak almost sounds rough you think that's just out there in the denomination our church says no sir no sir it's right amongst people that believe the very things you believe amen well I say the very things to a point they believe the same amen that's right let me tell you how technical people can be sometimes I hope you see humor in this I was talking to a man about the message one time and I saidwell it's as simple as the fact that a page has two sides and he said well you're wrong the page has this side and that side and this side and that side and this side and that side okay fine fine write me a note on this side write a love letter on that side no sir what will you do you'll take this side or this side that's right sir because these sides if I could put this to you are the Supernatural and it takes God to reveal to us what's on this side this side this side and this side any man can write on the front and the back it takes God to write in the margins are you with me takes God to write in the margins of our heart and soul no man can write in there it takes God to write that in there and you won't even be able to really understand why you believe what you believe and how you feel and why that is such so important to you because God wrote it in the margins of your life he wrote it in the edge that's too small for you and I to even comprehend it but it's still written amen amen amen so where did God reveal this message to us did he reveal it up here no sir he revealed it here did he reveal it here he revealed it right here why don't we go back to that point to find our answer why don't we have enough confidence in here to stand as Paul did before King agria and preach the word to him preach the life to him we don't need to have well if this will happen and that will happen amen Paul did not tell Agrippa that he's risen if he'll change your life if he preached the word amen he preached a living God Amen a Living Word a living message a living life is what he preached and King Agrippa caught the Revelation that there's something Beyond this life and I'm almost convinced to commit myself to it but I can't quite but I'll tell you what my brother and sister the Apostle Paul as we sit here today you might say we're uh uh converts of the Apostle Paul's Ministry yes sir are you with me yes sir yeah cuz brother brandham said hey what about Paul yeah Paul will have to stand with his people amen I preached what Paul preached yes sir Paul had a much more Supernatural Ministry than I think we give credit yeah in the day that we live I'll just skip over a couple of these things here amen now Mark 11 we'll look here my brother and sister and I've shortened this script scripture up it it's it's much broader I hope you don't mind but you can go read the whole context and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whoever shall say unto to this mountain be thou removed amen when the last time you moved a mountain come on most of you don't even have dirt underneath your fingernails so is he talking carnal or spiritual amen now I want to ask you when's the last time you moved to Mountain amen I hope you lift a hand and say it's been recent amen I asked the Lord and that mountain that situation that thing that was so big in my life I woke up in the morning it was gone anxiety and fear and depression and all of these spirits and all of these thoughts that were tormenting my life and I said Lord I need your help and the word said when you cry out his name he draws nigh to you and you fell asleep because your flesh and it was there in the middle of the night your faith is out there with a shovel move in the mountain and you wake up in the morning and say thank you Lord I've been delivered from this depression this fear this anxiety I've been delivered from these doubts you didn't move the mountain it was your faith that moved the mountain amen it was there the word working over time on your behalf but you had to believe it you had to make claim for it and I'm going to ask you right now you got a mountain in your life right now amen lift a hand lift a heart say Lord please move the mountain I need you to move Lord I got children that don't have the Holy Ghost I got children not serving God I've got family here I've got health issue I got whatever it is amen have faith in God move that mountain it's no longer for us to sit back and say God will do it someday amen God's called us to do it today he's called us to have faith enough in him today my brother and sister we have so many arguments in the message over this and over that but I tell you you can't argue with this right here when Jesus saith unto them have faith in God there should be nothing to argue over there because we're not putting someone between us and God be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart now I hope you don't mind me Taking Liberties but what see is this we got this idea that we're going to be sitting out here you know how far we live from the sea I think people that live in the middle of the country whatever country it might be must have more faith in the others because they're going to have to cast That Mountain a lot further no it's into the sea of God's forgetfulness it's in the sea that when you said Lord I need a Deliverance I need a revelation I need yes Lord I need your healing touch I need you to provide and that mountain is removed my brother and sister don't dwell on that mountain oh I used to be this I used to have this problem I was this and that was this and this was this forget it it's in the sea it's gone it's out of sight it's been covered that's what God wants us to do have that much faith in God maybe is a a besetting sin and you just come and say oh God forgive me I want this I need it out of my life in the name of Jesus Christ I command it to leave my life don't go back tomorrow and say I used to be an adulterer I used to be a drunk I used to lust In the Flesh I used to this I used to that quit talking about that mountain it's gone amen amen what you need to do is start lifting it up I had a prayer I had a need God came on the scene he took it out of my life and it's gone hallelujah hallelujah be a time for us to stand on the word instead of Our Own understanding that's right amen I like verse 24 don't you therefore I say unto you what so what things soever you desire amen is this a lost covet kind of Desire no sir this is a soul desire this is a heart's desire this is the word that is turning our world around amen whatsoever things whatsoever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them amen is it all right I'm trying to cure this getting too personal with the congregation how many of you ever have a time that you're praying you get down and pray you got something serious to pray about and you remember you left the keys in the car and you remember that you got to pay a bill that you forgot to pay for two weeks now it has to be paid in the morning and oh by the way that online sale ends at midnight am I close to home yes sir now this is the hard part how many of you got up from prayer that's it and took care of those things that's it am I too rough you see what Satan's trying to do is get us come to a place when we did get down to pray we almost take a pencil and a pad with us to write down the things we remember come on that's it right but what does this word say he's talking to you the believer he's talking to the bride of Christ he's talking to a people that he redeemed from the ages amen and he says I saying to you what things soever you desire he's talking to the spiritual man amen When you pray believe believe that you receive them and ye shall have them that's why the word says if your heart condemns you not you get down to pray I'll ask you oh my this will be juicy how many of you when you get down to pray suddenly remember the misguided words The Temper Tantrum is there somebody in here that's like me yes sir amen yeah yes sir thank you there's at least two amen look my brother and sister you see how much Satan hates this position amen how much he hates us coming to the place that when we get down to pray that we believe we will receive them or we're believing that what we didn't repent from is going to hinder that from us and we readily accept that I'm not worthy to have this prayer answered can I answer for all of you ouch yeah forgive us Lord that's right and that would be sufficient in sincerity yes sir amen CU you see Satan knows if he can keep you and I from this position that's it with liberty in our hearts keep us from entering in knowing are you with me today knowing god is going to answer this prayer amen now look the prophet of God talks about exaltation in different places likeoh we did this but I'm not trying to exalt myself my brother and sister I'll tell you I stand in that same position today how many times in different places of this Earth this world that we have encountered people of dire need dire circumstance young people on the verge of suicide and all kinds of perversions and it's there with a prayer of faith and I'm standing there I'm the one that is speaking and I know in my heart that I cannot do a single thing but I believe amen I believe God wanted them delivered I believe God's got an answer for them I believe there's power in this word it is not an exaltation of the man himself but it is a confidence knowing that whatever we ask in his name he's going to do it imagine how powerful we'll be as a church when we get to the place that we have that kind of confidence not Mis guided confidence but real confidence in God's word that's right I'm going to ask he's going to answer that's right amen hallelujah but we go down I want to hurry through this believe and you'll receive them when you stand praying forgive yes sir amen that's another beautiful tool the devil's got amen well they deserve that I'm angry with them they deserve this they deserve me to be rude they deserve no what they deserve is for you to forgive them that's right exactly that's what they deserve because when you forgive them amen it releases you am to receive this that's exactly right amen CU I don't know about you I ask the young people it's kind of entertaining we have a lot of fun in young adults I have a lot of fun picking on the kids anyway uh but you know I think that was a week or two ago got legitimate you got a legitimate gripe I'm right and I know I'm right come on any of you ever been there yes sir I know you married people know what I'm talking about I've told my husband 42 times if I've told him once he hasn't caught the Revelation yet but I guess you know that's why he's got the muscles I have the brains oh my anyway do we remember that conversation the more right you are the more obligated you are to be the one that seeks reconciliation yes sir come on can you grasp that yeah the writer this is Idaho English here in case you guys don't know the writer you are that starts with an I not a w the writer you are the more obligation you have to reconcile the situation I'll let you do your homework you can find it I'm very solid on the word where I stand on that I'll give you a couple hints communion communion doesn't say if they are the guilty party if you have an not do you know being too right can be an not yes sir oh my yall looking at me just like where is this guy going well I'll tell you what it is when you know that you're right you're not the one deceived and if you're not the one deceived then you know that reconcil iation relies upon you being the one to break it open and let the blood the presence of God come down in this situation I I I challenge you search it out in scripture I'm not going to look it up for you if you care enough you can find it amen amen because you see what happens is is whether right or wrong if our spirit's wrong it doesn't matter if you have the right answer that's right yeah right yeah reminds me of a teacher high school she handed out a test somehow or another she knew that kids had got answers to this test maybe from a previous class she passed out a test all these kids with their cheat sheets and they whip all the way through the test and every answer is right and uh you know just looks like the whole class is acing it and one kid in the back of the class he can't deal with it he's like teacher we all cheated she saysi know that but that was just a test to warm you up here's the real test who have you lied only one kid in the class raised their hand and she says okay class is dismissed and they're like what about the test that was it I flumed so sometimes the test is not what we think the test is that's right and God dealing with you and I'll just put it to you this way if you can come humble enough before God that it doesn't matter who's right and who is wrong but you want relationship that's right then you will initiate reconciliation amen are you with me amen amen okay I can't help but give you a little bit of a hint they're crucifying Jesus did Jesus ever do anything to hurt them they're crucifying Jesus did Jesus ever lie to them they're crucifying Jesus did he ever inflict personal pain upon them can anybody tell me the words that he spoke father forgive them he was perfectly right was he not amen he was perfectly correct but he was also in Perfect Harmony that's right with the word of God Amen I couldn't help myself just to share that amen is God a historical God you know how I can be so contrarian our God is a historical God because I can look back through my Bible and I can see all kinds of History concerning my God Amen but the word says he's the same yesterday that's history today which even two seconds ago is now history that's right amen and tomorrow what did the prophet say about that so many are looking back at a historical God and many are looking forward to what he will do but I want to know right now Saints I say this in a sense that I just want to stir your thoughts what is your relationship right now right now not yesterday not tomorrow not 10 years from now my brother and sister what is it right now the same yesterday today and forever that's our God he's right here right now I serve a historical God and I serve a god of the future but I serve a God that's living here right now a God that answers prayers in real time amen not in past time and not in future time but in real time right now A Prayer answering God Amen Hallelujah are we looking forward yes I'm looking forward the raptures in the future future I'm looking forward amen and how is it do I know that I have Redemption I look back and I see my Lord offering himself freely on a cross amen for me freely they said oh no no it was under duress they forced him to do that no my brother and sister imagine God our awesome God and the snap of a finger if he would have said Lord take these Legions from me I don't know if that armor would have stood up or fell down or what but they would have been done they're gone but he willingly walked up there to put us in a sense that we can look and see what it is amen oh that a friend would lay down his life amen he's our friend is he not amen you know come brother Alex Heen I still got a lot of notes Here Romans 15:14 I myself am persuaded of you my brethren that you're also full of goodness and this beautiful how God looks at us he doesn't see oh I know this is way too personal today I'm so sorry Saints but any of you ever just offered up an answer that really would qualify as a snide remark probably not a single one of you but people like you do that you know people that resemble very closely but here Paul's speaking to the Romans some of the most crft and hard people of the New Testament a a rough crowd and he says I'm persuaded of you my brethren that you're also full of goodness and filled with all knowledge able also demonish one another that word demonish my brother and sister is quite interesting cuz some believes that's we have a stick to beat people with but admonished would include also the words encourag amen so we are a people that should be able to encourage one another we should be able if you see fault in brother Paul amen you should come and talk to me but if not you should pray for me amen you should and this is what the word wants us to do this is how we bring Harmony in the body this is how the body becomes one that we look at one another and realize you know what I'm persuaded of this I am not caught in confusion I am not bewildered amen I am not bewildered Hallelujah can I just read this super long quote to you amen I'm sorry I I should be more thorough more organized but um it's the greatest news flash in history just greatest news flash you know years ago I became interested I don't think we even kept them but we had newspapers from South Africa concerning Nelson Mandela we had newspapers from you know the Twin Towers we had newspapers from all these different things that happen in the world real newspapers not souvenir newspapers real newspapers and you know you look at those and almost every one of them presented itself as a news flash this latest breaking greatest thing that ever happened right here and we're the first one to give it to you says everyone but here the prophet names a whole sermon the greatest news flash in history I think this is legitimate I think this is real he said oh what a glorious thing it is for his church after 1900 years almost 2,000 years ago to know that he lives we meet him in church on Sunday mornings no he says we meet him in every Bend of the road amen at every turn and every place we go we see Jesus see his living presence flowing like a radiant light from his glorious Church of the Living God did you guys catch the shift he took it from just being a light to a light that's in a glorious Church to be seen of the world you realize man I when I was a kid had a teacher that said Paul you love to talk you should be in drama class I ended up taking speech class instead which turned out to be much better you know cuz um I was well anyway if you guys think you don't have words I've heard some of you saywell we just don't have words to say that it's cuz I got them reason you don't have words is cuz I got them but look at this you see we see Jesus living presence flowing like radiant light from his glorious Church of the Living God how thankful we should be for that the message was given at the tomb are you with me am I being too personic if I focus down too tight the message was given at the tomb well we don't believe that the message really becomes applicable until the seals were open in 1963 everything before that was baby chatter no no come on nonsense nonsense my brother and sister people got this point that oh it starts here it starts there it stops there this applies that doesn't apply no the prophet of God said the message started was given at the Tomb come see go tell first thing come and be convinced nowadays people don't want to come uh to see those who do come can't set 10 minutes 5 minutes sometimes if you cross up their path I hope this doesn't hurt anybody's feelings if you cross up their path they're gone come see don't just peep in stand and look it over come and see and then go and tell look what happened God took Apostle Paul down to Arabia and he was right there he didn't run off from Arabia where's my where's my Hilton where where's my you know five star where is my my comfort zone where is he went down the backside of a desert and God dealt with him and when he come back amen he had something to share and that was so real that even King Agrippa who wasn't even a believer said I almost catch this [Music] Revelation I've worked with you seven years and uh I see you're [Music] different yeah we're different what do you believe um here's my pastor's phone number ask [Music] him we should have something to witness sir amen I was a sinner and now you know what the answer is oh I I I must be just cranky today forgive me I got up on the wrong side of the bed even though it's the same side I always get up on [Music] ah where do you go to church um this little red Church um down Midland there you probably wouldn't like it how do you know you like liked it well king agria um they preach are pretty straight there for Holiness wait till you witness I witnessed this to a lady not long ago and I said well we are Holiness at our church cuz she was like oh I think I might bring my mother and come my hair was twice as long as hers and I'm guilty of having J Ed her come on right go back to the testimony of sister retif going to meet brother brandham she goes down gets her hair trimmed gets a perm Everything She Wants to be picture perfect and she meets the prophet sets through one service and her heart is broken she's like oh my I thought it was doing a good thing I thought it was doing that brother brandom turns to her sister Betty the minute you believed amen you had long hair exactly oh we can make such an emphasis when they going to let their hair grow when they going to do this when they're going to do that no my brother and sister it's the minute we believe sir Hallelujah the minute come on Saints the minute we believe it doesn't take years of transition which is almost a bad word anymore oh I'm transitioning into a Christian oh no no no no you either identify I'm a Christian yes sir I've got the Holy Ghost I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I'm not transitioning into one I am one I am a believer Hallelujah oh listen this is a good spot right here just to start back into those who do come can't set 10 minutes 5 minutes sometimes you cross up their path they're gone come see don't just peep in stand and look it over come and see and then go and tell that was what he told the woman uh women that morning at the grave come and see where he has laid past T but he's not here no more then go tell his disciples that I'll meet you over in Galilee go tell who his bewildered disciples they were certainly bewildered they didn't know what to do many of them had returned back to their fish nets they wanted to go back to catching fishes they were bewildered because they didn't know what or how to make in Meet they had absolutely trusted that he was the Messiah and here he was dead see that's the problem so many people think he's still dead [Music] my they had absolutely trusted that he was the Messiah and here he was dead and they didn't know what to do now but go tell this bewildered church that I'm alive amen I'll go before them and I'll meet them in Galilee as I have promised to do that church bewildered then is no worse than the church is today it's still bewildered it can't make out the scripture somebody say thank you Lord that the word has become real to me thank you Lord that I can read my Bible and see between the lines amen I can see beyond that Jesus died for me amen this is not just Child's Play Amen oh it cannot understand why
