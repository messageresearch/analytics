[46:50] passed away
[46:52] I don't know they say there's an
[46:54] accident
[46:55] because of that and I just trust that
[46:57] there was anyone else involved in that
[46:59] accident that Lord would just have his
[47:02] hand upon them
[47:04] you know we were privileged
[47:07] sister Jerry and I
[47:10] to spend

[47:32] got to hear his vision for the church
[47:36] this desire to the people
[47:40] [Music]
[47:42] we got two spend time with his daughter
[47:46] and family
[47:47] grandsons that adored him
[47:49] [Music]
[47:52] son Anthony who's from where a little
[47:55] boy has been handicapped
[47:57] but yet it would be as though A light
[48:00] turned on when he would
[48:04] see and hear his father
[48:08] a heart would be broken as though Lord
[48:11] why would you
[48:13] take them away
[48:15] take him away
[48:18] but we stand today and say my God's way
[48:21] is perfect

[48:27] to know
[48:28] and believe that God's way is perfect

[48:37] brother Andrew sister Gloria O'Brien
[48:41] called me right after you did Brother

[48:48] I have to appreciate that
[48:52] they're saying brother Paul you're going
[48:53] to need somebody to pray for you this
[48:55] morning
[48:57] and we're here to pray for you
[49:01] Saints must remember the church there

[49:19] we think
[49:21] I pray that it is
[49:24] amen
[49:25] [Music]
[49:27] around a little bit this morning please
[49:29] forgive me
[49:35] let's just stand as we go into the word
[49:38] this morning I want to preach to you on
[49:40] a very simple thought
[49:43] thank you brother Isaac
[49:45] thank you sister
[49:47] amen
[49:49] on a simple thought what is our vision
[49:53] and my brother and sister God has never
[49:58] left his people without a vision
[50:01] because the scripture clearly says that
[50:03] if there is no vision the people perish
[50:05] and God never called you and I to perish
[50:08] in fact God said I'm going to bless you
[50:10] about beyond measure amen so I say today
[50:13] thank you Lord for your grace and mercy
[50:16] let's turn in our Bibles to Luke the
[50:18] second chapter
[50:22] and uh I had not announced this but uh
[50:26] sister Jerry and I will be
[50:29] preaching I I will be preaching for
[50:34] Brother Rich and
[50:36] Oregon this coming uh Sunday
[50:40] so if you would just please pray for our
[50:42] time there with the Saints amen
[50:47] Luke 2 21
[50:52] and when eight days were accomplished
[50:54] for the circumcising of the child
[50:57] and his name was called Jesus
[51:00] which was so named of the Angel before
[51:03] he was conceived in the womb
[51:07] and when the days of her purification
[51:10] according to the law of Moses were
[51:12] accomplished they brought him to
[51:14] Jerusalem to present him
[51:18] to the Lord
[51:20] now I find that very interesting my
[51:22] brother and sister how God would choose
[51:24] to represent this to us
[51:26] because you we could look at this and
[51:29] say but Jesus
[51:31] was God in flesh
[51:34] but you see even then there had to come
[51:37] a maturity
[51:39] so we see the vessel
[51:44] but that vessel was not a direct
[51:48] manifestation of God in flesh
[51:51] does that make sense
[51:53] that was a baby
[51:56] because God wanted to do all things
[51:59] liken as we would see it as we would
[52:02] experience
[52:04] so God didn't come in a complete way
[52:06] opposite of anything that we would ever
[52:08] experience but he came in the same path
[52:10] walked in the same steps manifested the
[52:13] same revelation
[52:16] does that make sense to you all amen
[52:22] to present him to the Lord as is written
[52:24] in the law of the Lord every male that
[52:27] openeth the womb Shall be Called holy to
[52:29] the Lord
[52:30] and to offer sacrifice according to that
[52:34] which is said in the law of the Lord a
[52:36] pair of turtle doves or two young
[52:39] pigeons and behold there was a man in
[52:42] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the
[52:45] same man was just in devout waiting for
[52:48] the consolation of Israel and the Holy
[52:51] Ghost was upon him
[52:53] oh my I'm telling you what my brother
[52:56] and sister what God will do in our life
[52:58] amen when the Holy Ghost is upon us and
[53:01] it was revealed to him by the holy ghost
[53:04] that he should not see death before he
[53:08] had seen the Lord's Christ
[53:10] and he came by the spirit
[53:14] now my brother and sister I want you to
[53:16] catch this so I don't really need to
[53:17] deal with it later he didn't come by an
[53:20] intellectual revelation
[53:23] he didn't come by figuring out the odds
[53:26] the chances just how it might be but he
[53:29] came LED of the spirit amen Our God does
[53:34] the same in our life
[53:36] amen
[53:42] and when the parents brought in the
[53:45] Child Jesus to do for him after the
[53:47] custom of the law then took he him up in
[53:50] his arms Simeon took him up in his arms
[53:53] blessed God and said Lord now let us
[53:56] thou thy servant depart in peace
[53:59] according to Thy word for mine eyes have
[54:03] seen thy salvation which thou Hast
[54:06] prepared before the face of all people a
[54:09] light to light the Gentiles and the
[54:11] glory of thy People Israel and Joseph
[54:14] and his mother marveled at those things
[54:17] which were spoken of him and Simeon
[54:21] blessed them and said unto Mary his
[54:23] mother behold this child is set for the
[54:26] fall and the rising of again of many in
[54:30] Israel and for a sign which shall be
[54:32] spoken
[54:34] against amen Heavenly Father we just ask
[54:37] you this morning
[54:38] come father
[54:40] Lord while my heart is sad this morning
[54:43] at the passing of my brother
[54:45] Lord my heart rejoices to see your word
[54:48] coming to pass in this day in this
[54:51] people
[54:52] father for truly the light has come upon
[54:55] us and we can walk in that light father
[54:58] we thank you for the revelation of that
[55:00] we thank you for the life Lord that you
[55:03] have poured into us something father we
[55:06] would not be capable
[55:08] in the flesh
[55:09] you have not only made it to happen that
[55:13] we would be capable
[55:15] but you have manifested father
[55:18] as the prophet of God said Supreme deity
[55:20] has come to us
[55:22] that we can walk in that light father we
[55:26] thank you today in the name of Jesus
[55:28] Christ amen amen you may be seated
[55:31] Saints
[55:47] thank you
[55:49] all right
[55:54] as we see the supernatural has come to
[55:57] Mary
[55:58] as a virgin
[56:00] now that promise was to Israel
[56:03] that a virgin shall conceive and
[56:06] not my brother and sister was no doubt
[56:09] generation after generation of young
[56:13] women in Israel
[56:16] devout
[56:18] living their life correctly
[56:21] maybe their mama when they were a child
[56:24] said you know it could be you
[56:27] and there was an expectation
[56:31] but God come and fulfilled his word he
[56:34] come down and
[56:36] Angel spoke to Mary and
[56:39] we would understand I believe today
[56:41] saints that if God has made a promise
[56:43] for us it will come to pass amen
[56:47] people question they say but brother
[56:48] Branham made prophecies and we haven't
[56:51] seen them come to pass but my brother
[56:53] and sister
[56:55] there are things happening around the
[56:57] world today that we know nothing about
[57:00] and we tend to assume that maybe if
[57:02] something was prophesied that it must
[57:04] come to pass and make as it were the
[57:07] evening news of the message
[57:09] but it's not so God brings it to pass
[57:12] prophecy is fulfilled no matter where
[57:15] this takes place
[57:17] and so as God brings about this there
[57:20] isn't a great attention called there
[57:22] isn't uh something that is trumpeted in
[57:25] the evening news but here is Joseph and
[57:28] Mary following the law of Moses so they
[57:32] are just being good Jews to follow the
[57:35] law and to bring this baby to the temple
[57:39] to be blessed to give it to the Lord and
[57:41] so is as they are coming little do they
[57:45] know that while they are following the
[57:47] law they're soon going to be a part of
[57:50] the fulfilling of Prophecy and I say
[57:53] this morning my brother and sister we do
[57:55] our very best each and every day to live
[57:58] the word of God for this hour but little
[58:00] do we know that we are actually also in
[58:04] the midst of fulfilling prophecy amen
[58:07] and I'll put it this way my brother and
[58:09] sister I look at the very Vindication of
[58:12] the message of brother Branham not that
[58:15] brother Branham was there and
[58:16] Supernatural signs took place
[58:18] discernments and and healings I don't
[58:21] look at that myself personally my
[58:23] brother and sister because that's all a
[58:25] part of the commission that God give to
[58:27] him but what I see is a Vindication
[58:30] today is there is a people on the Earth
[58:33] today that are living out and fulfilling
[58:36] the word that was testified in our day
[58:39] if that word was testified and there was
[58:42] no life in it it would not produce a
[58:45] people whose heart's desire is to serve
[58:48] God with all their heart mind body and
[58:50] soul so I thank God today that it wasn't
[58:52] just a prophet coming my brother and
[58:54] sister there was power in that word
[58:56] there was life in that word and the
[58:59] power and that life come down wasn't
[59:01] kept to a prophet but it was poured out
[59:04] as the word says into the church and we
[59:07] are the church and this life is here and
[59:10] now it wasn't for us just to acknowledge
[59:12] that a supernatural sign come in our day
[59:15] but it is to recognize the supernatural
[59:17] natural sign which was Jesus Christ has
[59:20] come and rests upon us today and it is
[59:23] our position now not only to live and
[59:27] let me use it this way to do the law
[59:32] but the law
[59:35] had purpose
[59:36] Beyond just fulfilling the law
[59:40] here is prophecy concerning Mary you're
[59:42] going to have a child
[59:49] I don't know if I can accept that
[59:54] but right in their midst was the
[59:56] prophecy
[59:58] right in the midst of Israel right in
[1:00:00] the midst of the people was the prophecy
[1:00:02] they didn't have to take anyone's word
[1:00:04] for it they could go back because they
[1:00:07] testified of Isaiah they testified of
[1:00:09] him being a man of God a great man of
[1:00:12] God all they had to do is go back and
[1:00:14] look at what the prophecy was and they
[1:00:17] would have stopped and said you know
[1:00:18] what we believe this is going to come to
[1:00:21] pass and we'll look for it but you see
[1:00:23] my brother and sister what happened was
[1:00:25] is there was something that got in
[1:00:27] between them and you know it's it's
[1:00:30] there that we'll see how that God was
[1:00:33] bringing now to fulfill the law and the
[1:00:36] Very one that says I didn't come to do
[1:00:38] away with the law I come to fulfill the
[1:00:40] law the very one is Babe in arms at the
[1:00:43] moment and they're looking to the law
[1:00:45] and saying we must take him to the
[1:00:48] temple and we must give offering
[1:00:50] but little did they know what God was
[1:00:52] really doing was bringing them in the
[1:00:54] intersection of time to fulfill the
[1:00:56] prophecy of Isaiah to fulfill these
[1:00:59] things in the word of God to bring them
[1:01:01] to a place a junction of time that these
[1:01:04] things could come to pass because you
[1:01:06] see my brother and sister God follows
[1:01:08] his own teaching
[1:01:10] God doesn't have shortcuts
[1:01:12] that's why it bothers me I'll be honest
[1:01:14] bothers me in the day that we live in
[1:01:16] when people ministers around the message
[1:01:18] are offering shortcuts my brother and
[1:01:21] sister God does not give shortcuts God
[1:01:24] does not take shortcuts but God has a
[1:01:27] word and he's going to fulfill his word
[1:01:29] and we see Simeon the scripture says he
[1:01:32] was a just and devout man
[1:01:35] and he was waiting for the consolation
[1:01:37] of Israel now let's just take this word
[1:01:40] consolation my brother and sister the
[1:01:43] consolation of Israel
[1:01:46] was a comfort that would come from a
[1:01:48] fulfilling of Prophecy
[1:01:51] it wasn't to make them comfortable my
[1:01:53] brother and sister to set today just for
[1:01:56] life to be cushy we're not talking about
[1:01:58] that kind of comfort but it was a
[1:02:00] comfort that would come to the soul when
[1:02:02] Israel had their Messiah prophecy
[1:02:05] declared that there would be peace in
[1:02:07] Israel and I'm telling you my brother
[1:02:09] and sister too many people took that
[1:02:11] word piece and said you know what
[1:02:12] there'll be no more Wars there'll be no
[1:02:14] more but the peace my brother and sister
[1:02:16] is what has come down in the heart and
[1:02:18] soul of Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:02:21] that peace to rest upon the word of God
[1:02:23] it didn't take away our trials it didn't
[1:02:25] take away our struggles as it were but
[1:02:28] we have a peace in who we are and where
[1:02:30] we stand and that was a position that
[1:02:33] was prophesied and given to Israel at
[1:02:35] that time that they would come at the
[1:02:37] acceptance or the the return of the
[1:02:40] Messiah that there would be a peace come
[1:02:42] to Israel and so they're all looking and
[1:02:44] this is why as we shared this last uh
[1:02:48] service on the road to Emmaus you see
[1:02:51] they thought that they that Jesus was
[1:02:54] going to be the one that was going to to
[1:02:57] bring Israel to a place of being
[1:02:59] conquerors Overcomers that put down all
[1:03:01] of their enemies that's the peace that
[1:03:03] they were looking for but little did
[1:03:05] they know as the prophecy of Isaiah said
[1:03:08] that the Prince of Peace amen was coming
[1:03:12] to them and so as it's here we'll look
[1:03:15] at this and they're waiting for the
[1:03:16] consolation Simeon was waiting for the
[1:03:19] consolation of Israel waiting for
[1:03:22] comfort that had been prophesied
[1:03:26] promised to Israel
[1:03:29] now as we'll look here real quick in
[1:03:31] Isaiah 9 and 6 just to bring these
[1:03:34] scriptures you're very familiar with
[1:03:36] them but I just feel to tie them in
[1:03:39] For unto us a child is born
[1:03:42] unto us a son is given
[1:03:46] the government shall be upon his
[1:03:48] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[1:03:49] wonderful
[1:03:51] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[1:03:54] father
[1:03:55] the Prince of Peace of the increase of
[1:03:58] his government and peace there shall be
[1:04:00] no end
[1:04:02] upon the throne of David and upon his
[1:04:04] kingdom to order it to establish it with
[1:04:07] judgment and with Justice from
[1:04:09] henceforth even forever the Zeal of the
[1:04:12] Lord of hosts will perform this my
[1:04:15] brother and sister is such a beautiful
[1:04:16] scripture
[1:04:18] this was the promise to Israel this was
[1:04:21] their consolation
[1:04:22] and we see this baby now what
[1:04:25] appointment many poignant moments in in
[1:04:28] Israel
[1:04:29] in the history of Israel many many
[1:04:31] things my brother and sister that were
[1:04:34] filming of many prophecies and you know
[1:04:36] when something is uh poignant it is uh
[1:04:39] many times there's a degree of sadness
[1:04:42] sorrow uh Etc attached with this so many
[1:04:45] times through Israel there was something
[1:04:48] that happened where the people just come
[1:04:50] just a little bit short and what they
[1:04:52] thought was going to be fulfilled or
[1:04:54] what was going to happen did not happen
[1:04:56] and we see that Israel even to this day
[1:04:59] is in a constant state of of seeking
[1:05:04] reaching out grasping out trying to find
[1:05:06] peace in the natural trying to find the
[1:05:09] Fulfillment of the word all of these
[1:05:11] things still to this very moment
[1:05:15] they're still grasping at that and still
[1:05:18] at this very moment there's Publications
[1:05:21] there's writings
[1:05:23] there's things in recent and past
[1:05:26] history
[1:05:27] you might say they're lamenting if only
[1:05:30] this had happened
[1:05:33] well I want to tell you my brother and
[1:05:35] sister do we believe God's in control
[1:05:36] this morning
[1:05:38] there is no need for us to be setting if
[1:05:40] this had happened we need to walk in the
[1:05:43] light right now not trying to live in
[1:05:46] the past if we have issues in our life
[1:05:48] don't look back at those issues look at
[1:05:51] the light standing right now and say
[1:05:52] from this moment I'm going to walk in
[1:05:55] the light amen from this moment I'm not
[1:05:57] going to look back and say if only this
[1:06:00] if only that
[1:06:02] I'm gonna walk in that light and I'm
[1:06:04] going to claim every promise of God from
[1:06:05] this moment on
[1:06:08] oh how easy it is to live in the past
[1:06:12] I remember brother once saying you know
[1:06:14] there is a reason the windshield is as
[1:06:17] big as it is in the rear view mirror is
[1:06:19] the size that it is
[1:06:23] yes
[1:06:24] imagine if God had wanted it Opposite he
[1:06:27] would give us very limited vision
[1:06:30] to the Future
[1:06:32] and give us a very large revelation of
[1:06:36] the past
[1:06:37] but it's the opposite
[1:06:39] amen so God is dealing now he comes down
[1:06:43] and here is is this time
[1:06:47] prophecies must be fulfilled we know
[1:06:49] that there is no there is no bypassing
[1:06:52] prophecy my brother and sister
[1:06:55] and so here is right in the temple that
[1:06:58] day
[1:06:59] there is no great light there's no
[1:07:01] sounding of symbols or horns that there
[1:07:04] is a incredible event taking place now
[1:07:09] Joseph and Mary are just bringing baby
[1:07:11] Jesus to fulfill the law
[1:07:14] I I don't know if this will register
[1:07:16] with you my brother and sister but we
[1:07:19] can get up on a Sunday morning
[1:07:21] and we can think I'm just going to
[1:07:23] church today but my brother and sister
[1:07:26] God's got a whole greater plan than us
[1:07:28] just showing up at church he's got a
[1:07:31] supernatural amen can I say this a
[1:07:34] supernatural appointment with you and I
[1:07:37] the house of God and you say life is
[1:07:40] difficult and we have this trouble we
[1:07:42] have this trouble but what about the
[1:07:44] prophecy no one asked Joseph and Mary
[1:07:47] how do you feel about taking Jesus to
[1:07:50] the temple today they were just like
[1:07:52] we're fulfilling the law we didn't get
[1:07:54] out of bed this morning jump and Shout
[1:07:56] praise God something Supernatural is
[1:07:58] going to happen at the temple today they
[1:08:00] were there it is according to the law
[1:08:02] the days have passed the days of
[1:08:04] purification and we now according to the
[1:08:08] law have a duty to take Jesus to the
[1:08:10] temple to give him to the Lord for him
[1:08:13] to be blessed and they might not even
[1:08:15] have been excited my brother and sister
[1:08:17] maybe so there would be a degree like a
[1:08:19] mother a father dedicating their baby
[1:08:22] there's something there but you know
[1:08:24] maybe not heel clicking excitement to
[1:08:26] run around and say whoa this is the day
[1:08:28] my brother and sister it was another day
[1:08:30] the sun had Rose they had put on their
[1:08:33] best garment they had a duty to do and I
[1:08:36] want to emphasize a duty that's right
[1:08:40] and they went off to the house of God to
[1:08:42] give
[1:08:43] their little baby boy
[1:08:45] to the Lord
[1:08:47] but an intersection of time is a man
[1:08:50] named Simeon
[1:08:52] filled with the Holy Ghost anointed of
[1:08:54] God then at some date history doesn't
[1:08:56] really lock this down for us but at some
[1:08:59] point of time the Holy Ghost come and
[1:09:01] spoke to him and said you will not pass
[1:09:04] from this life until you have seen the
[1:09:07] Lord's Christ now this man didn't say
[1:09:09] well I hope this happens I'm wondering
[1:09:11] how this will happen he took that in
[1:09:14] because why he had that relationship
[1:09:16] with God that the spirit speaking to him
[1:09:19] and him speaking in the spirit and he
[1:09:22] knew when that voice spoke to him why
[1:09:24] because he knew the voice
[1:09:26] it wasn't just a voice he knew that
[1:09:29] voice and as that voice spoke to him and
[1:09:31] says you will not pass from this life
[1:09:33] until you have seen the Lord's Christ
[1:09:36] and he believed
[1:09:38] oh I tell you you'd help a lot of us if
[1:09:40] we'd throw the nonsense around us throw
[1:09:42] it out throw this voice out throw this
[1:09:45] influence out throw this negative
[1:09:47] thought out and just believe
[1:09:49] amen here's the there there had to be a
[1:09:51] lot of reasons why Simeon would have
[1:09:53] thought may I don't know see it don't
[1:09:55] really lay it down for us but if you'd
[1:09:57] give me the kindness to just lay this
[1:09:59] out maybe Simeon had walked for 40 or 50
[1:10:03] years with this revelation
[1:10:06] that's right maybe not a revelation my
[1:10:08] brother and sister they just showed up
[1:10:10] yesterday and said oh I'm not going to
[1:10:12] die until I see no I believe he carried
[1:10:14] this with him because God likes to test
[1:10:16] us with time
[1:10:18] God likes to use time to test us
[1:10:23] and he believed
[1:10:25] and so as we see this
[1:10:28] the hustle and bustle of all the things
[1:10:30] of the Temple
[1:10:32] and here's Joseph and Mary coming
[1:10:35] now my brother and sister
[1:10:37] to the Casual Observer
[1:10:42] they see Mary
[1:10:45] as a young woman with compromised morals
[1:10:50] they don't see her as that chosen virgin
[1:10:53] out of Israel
[1:10:55] that found favor with God to bring forth
[1:10:58] the Redeemer
[1:11:02] in their religious World they were so
[1:11:04] caught up with their rights and their
[1:11:06] wrongs and their measures
[1:11:08] that all they saw was a little girl I
[1:11:10] don't care what they say I don't care
[1:11:12] about her story about being met by an
[1:11:14] Angel she's a young girl and she's
[1:11:16] having a child now she's had a child
[1:11:18] she's married Joseph it's such a mess
[1:11:21] she'll never have happened in our
[1:11:24] community should have never happened in
[1:11:27] our church should have never happened
[1:11:29] prophecy said it would happen
[1:11:32] amen so they are looking in flesh at the
[1:11:35] word of God not even understanding no
[1:11:39] revelation of what God is doing I pray
[1:11:41] we don't stand that way today I pray
[1:11:44] that by God's grace we can see the word
[1:11:46] coming to pass see the life that is in
[1:11:49] the word being poured out
[1:11:51] because otherwise we'll see the
[1:11:53] supernatural pass right before our eyes
[1:11:56] and never respond I'm sorry I I don't
[1:12:00] remember the sermon now but brother
[1:12:01] Branham one time is speaking to a young
[1:12:04] lady
[1:12:07] I say young lady
[1:12:09] to a lady to a sister
[1:12:13] and he tells her what's wrong with her
[1:12:18] tells her her name
[1:12:20] and when you hear it on tape you'll hear
[1:12:22] the prophet of God in a very deep
[1:12:25] burdened voice
[1:12:28] respond yeah
[1:12:30] respond
[1:12:33] in a space and he says you missed it
[1:12:37] and then he goes on and discerns another
[1:12:40] individual
[1:12:42] my brother and sister I pray that we are
[1:12:44] not sitting here today in such a state
[1:12:47] of the message that the Holy Spirit
[1:12:49] would deal with our hearts and we would
[1:12:51] fail to respond amen amen amen
[1:12:54] hallelujah
[1:12:58] so that casual Observer looking at Mary
[1:13:00] didn't see anything at all
[1:13:02] my they're married now but we know that
[1:13:05] child probably shouldn't even be here
[1:13:07] shouldn't even be brought the scripture
[1:13:10] says child like that shouldn't even be
[1:13:12] bought into the house of God for
[1:13:14] Generations
[1:13:19] but that was a carnal man's vision
[1:13:24] because God's Vision had come to him
[1:13:26] godly man holy ghost-filled man named
[1:13:29] Simeon
[1:13:30] saw an entirely different Vision my
[1:13:32] brothers and sisters than the priests
[1:13:34] saw entirely different Vision than all
[1:13:37] the religious people saw and God come
[1:13:40] down to Simeon and is giving a
[1:13:42] revelation of what is to happen here and
[1:13:45] so it's there my brother and sister this
[1:13:48] Vision amen there's the carnal man's
[1:13:50] vision and then God had a vision in the
[1:13:53] land that was there for the benefit of
[1:13:55] the people they didn't understand it but
[1:13:57] God had it there and this Vision brought
[1:14:00] the Revelation brought by the revelation
[1:14:02] of the Holy Ghost is declaring to the
[1:14:06] people that this is going to be the one
[1:14:09] oh my brother and sister when Simeon
[1:14:11] prayed in the temple Simeon didn't
[1:14:13] whisper Simeon prayed
[1:14:16] and those around him if they had had an
[1:14:18] ear to hear would have heard simeon's
[1:14:21] prayer now the prophet of God will read
[1:14:23] a quote here in just a bit prophet of
[1:14:25] God doesn't talk about Simeon as just
[1:14:27] being a man he's talking about a man on
[1:14:29] position a man that was respected a man
[1:14:32] that was honored
[1:14:35] and if they had just listened to Simeon
[1:14:38] many of them would have said there's
[1:14:40] something special Supernatural taking
[1:14:41] place right now in our midst
[1:14:44] all they had to do I'm telling you my
[1:14:46] brother and sister I don't want to sound
[1:14:48] judgmental today by any means shape or
[1:14:50] form but what we need to do is just get
[1:14:52] back and hear what the voice for our day
[1:14:55] says amen not what somebody interpreted
[1:14:57] to us not what somebody else explained
[1:15:00] it to us but we need to just listen to
[1:15:02] the voice because the voice has declared
[1:15:05] Deliverance The Voice has declared the
[1:15:07] coming of the son of man in our midst as
[1:15:11] declared that we would become as a
[1:15:14] prophet teachers that we would become
[1:15:16] God in morphe in US amen God in us
[1:15:20] living that's what the word says not us
[1:15:23] in form and formality not us declaring
[1:15:25] ah we follow my brother and sister no
[1:15:28] I'm not going to follow the message I am
[1:15:30] the message
[1:15:33] God help us to realize that we are the
[1:15:37] message in this day
[1:15:38] amen we are the evidence that this word
[1:15:42] is true because you look around I'm not
[1:15:44] justifying who we are but look around
[1:15:46] this is why my brother and sister that a
[1:15:49] good heart a a minister with the right
[1:15:52] heart does not just want to preach to
[1:15:55] you he wants you to see yourself in the
[1:15:59] message of the hour he wants you to see
[1:16:01] yourself in the Bible he wants you to
[1:16:04] see yourself filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:06] because it's in that position right
[1:16:08] there that it's God in you and
[1:16:11] everything else is shot out in that
[1:16:13] little room the prophet of God talked
[1:16:15] about you're in there you walk out what
[1:16:17] happened I don't know what happened but
[1:16:19] I know it happened
[1:16:21] I know that God is changing me I know
[1:16:25] that whatever I was in the past even
[1:16:27] when I say past might be just this
[1:16:29] morning whatever's in the past is the
[1:16:32] past and I'm a son I'm a daughter and
[1:16:34] I'm going to walk forward in the vision
[1:16:38] because if we don't Satan will
[1:16:40] constantly throw those things in front
[1:16:41] of you that you will constantly be
[1:16:43] reminded you're human in flesh and God's
[1:16:46] I don't care about your flesh I didn't
[1:16:48] come to redeem the flesh I come to put
[1:16:50] the word in you and let the flesh
[1:16:52] manifest the word of God
[1:16:55] oh you go brother Paul you're getting
[1:16:57] out there no I'm not I got I got
[1:16:59] scripture and I got quotes to back this
[1:17:01] up amen because God wants the life to be
[1:17:05] manifested not just for people to say oh
[1:17:08] Jesus Christ is is alive he's
[1:17:10] resurrected but for people to be able to
[1:17:13] say he's walking in flesh again my
[1:17:16] neighbor
[1:17:17] Maya Maya Auntie my uncle whoever it
[1:17:22] would be is a representation of Christ
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:29] now you look at this my brother and
[1:17:31] sister
[1:17:32] I've changed the words just a little bit
[1:17:34] and I hope you don't mind but this
[1:17:35] Vision was bought brought by the
[1:17:37] revelation of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:17:39] right it wasn't as it were riding on the
[1:17:42] wall that we said okay I gotta follow
[1:17:43] this
[1:17:44] or a scroll that was turned that somehow
[1:17:47] no one had ever interpreted correctly
[1:17:50] no my brother and sister they had read
[1:17:52] the Scrolls front to back top to bottom
[1:17:54] every way you can read it every way you
[1:17:57] could study it every way you could
[1:17:58] interpret it they had done that but it
[1:18:01] was done in an intellectual approach and
[1:18:03] they had missed the revelation of the
[1:18:06] Holy Ghost that was to bring this to
[1:18:08] pass amen
[1:18:10] amen amen
[1:18:18] I prayed for years over my mother
[1:18:22] it was my heartfelt desire
[1:18:24] I prayed for years
[1:18:26] that my mother would be alive
[1:18:28] and remain at the coming of the Lord
[1:18:32] it was my heart's desire
[1:18:39] God chose otherwise
[1:18:42] my brother Gideon
[1:18:44] God chose otherwise
[1:18:49] does not take one thing away
[1:18:54] from the promise of God Amen that's
[1:18:57] right
[1:19:00] and Simeon celebrated another birthday
[1:19:05] and another birthday amen
[1:19:08] and another birthday
[1:19:12] and I believe on the other side we'll
[1:19:13] get to talk to Simeon we ask him Simeon
[1:19:15] do you ever have doubts
[1:19:17] oh there was a time or two
[1:19:20] time or two maybe my heart gave me a few
[1:19:22] issues and you know it just looked like
[1:19:24] it was over
[1:19:26] I don't know how that would be
[1:19:30] but I believe Simeon had one thing
[1:19:34] I didn't include the quote but the
[1:19:36] prophet of God said there's one thing
[1:19:37] about a Believer paraphrasing this one
[1:19:39] thing about a Believer they always come
[1:19:42] back to the word
[1:19:45] not to emotion not to thinking not what
[1:19:48] the devil painted the picture they come
[1:19:50] back to the word I say Lord help us help
[1:19:53] us no matter how defeated we feel how
[1:19:56] weak we feel what the flesh is doing
[1:19:59] what the mind is doing let us Circle
[1:20:01] back around to the word and let us look
[1:20:04] at the word and say Lord what did you
[1:20:06] promise me and Lord you said that you
[1:20:09] called me before the foundation of the
[1:20:11] world you said I was a son you said I
[1:20:13] was a daughter you said that I had
[1:20:15] eternal life I'm circling back to that
[1:20:18] I'm not going to receive any other
[1:20:20] explanation
[1:20:22] and Simeon is there
[1:20:24] and my brother and sister history would
[1:20:27] tell you that he was old and he was
[1:20:28] feeble
[1:20:29] he was coming to the end of his life but
[1:20:32] God is faithful Can someone say Amen my
[1:20:35] God is faithful and he knew he didn't
[1:20:39] guess he didn't hope he knew that he
[1:20:41] would not pass from this life until he
[1:20:44] had saw the Lord's Christ and I'm going
[1:20:46] to get ahead of myself and I'm sorry I
[1:20:47] can't help it but there will not be one
[1:20:50] son or daughter of God that's name is on
[1:20:52] the Lamb's Book of Life will pass from
[1:20:54] this life until they have saw the Lord's
[1:20:57] Christ
[1:20:58] amen there is no way God will lose a one
[1:21:01] go study what the prophet says about
[1:21:03] that God will not lose a one the picture
[1:21:06] might not be pretty the picture might
[1:21:08] not be pretty my brother and sister but
[1:21:10] God will not lose them
[1:21:13] oh Hallelujah and here's Simeon
[1:21:15] believing
[1:21:16] amen what the Holy Ghost had spoke to
[1:21:18] him
[1:21:19] amen and it's in that position that he
[1:21:21] anchored that down in his soul
[1:21:24] you see my brother and sister knowing
[1:21:26] this
[1:21:28] if Israel had not been influenced
[1:21:30] by other things
[1:21:34] you know what the greatest
[1:21:36] thing that influenced Israel
[1:21:39] was religion
[1:21:45] I want to bring you right here to this
[1:21:47] day right now
[1:21:49] I don't want our young people
[1:21:51] listening to this garbage music
[1:21:53] I don't want our young people acting
[1:21:56] like these these almost like lunatics
[1:21:59] out here
[1:22:00] I'm telling you I've done this before
[1:22:02] and maybe it comes across funny but my
[1:22:03] brother and sister there's nothing
[1:22:05] normal about young men walking with
[1:22:07] their knees poked out to keep their
[1:22:08] pants from falling on the ground there's
[1:22:10] nothing normal about young men walking
[1:22:12] along with one hand holding up the back
[1:22:14] of their britches to keep their pants
[1:22:16] from falling on the ground there's not
[1:22:18] one thing normal about that behavior not
[1:22:20] one thing normal about a young man with
[1:22:22] hair that he has to keep flipping out of
[1:22:24] his face like a girl see young men the
[1:22:27] other day with bobby pins in his hair
[1:22:30] come on that's nothing normal about that
[1:22:32] my brother and sister and it goes to the
[1:22:35] other side but we won't go there you've
[1:22:36] got the point I believe so we look at
[1:22:38] the world today and realize that there
[1:22:41] is something that has Twisted the mind
[1:22:43] of the people and the prophet of God
[1:22:45] said even what happened in Russia was a
[1:22:48] Church's fault
[1:22:50] communism
[1:22:52] sweeping the nation exactly
[1:22:54] was the church's fault
[1:22:57] why because they had given the people an
[1:23:00] empty promise but here stands Simeon as
[1:23:04] a witness today
[1:23:05] to tell you God gave me a promise the
[1:23:08] revelation of the Holy Spirit and I
[1:23:10] believe that promise and I went birthday
[1:23:13] after birthday after birthday I went to
[1:23:15] the temple time after time to do my own
[1:23:19] worship and it was there often no doubt
[1:23:21] wondering is this today is this the day
[1:23:24] is this the time and when he walked back
[1:23:26] out of the temple and it had not
[1:23:28] happened it didn't say that was an empty
[1:23:30] promise he said this is not the day this
[1:23:32] is the day but the day of the Lord is
[1:23:34] coming and I will be there testifying on
[1:23:38] the day of the Lord amen and so it's
[1:23:40] there this Revelation brought to him
[1:23:43] and if Israel had not been influenced by
[1:23:45] other things when Jesus came to the
[1:23:47] temple that day they would have been
[1:23:49] there to worship with them
[1:23:53] why weren't they
[1:23:55] in the temple
[1:23:57] looking for the babe
[1:24:00] because in their mind
[1:24:02] various sects of the religion of that
[1:24:05] time various groups
[1:24:07] some believed he was going to float down
[1:24:09] like an angel to the Pinnacle of the
[1:24:11] Temple
[1:24:12] and stand there while all of Israel come
[1:24:15] to worship Him
[1:24:17] you know it was closer to that
[1:24:18] revelation
[1:24:20] Satan's offer to our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:24] see where their interpretation was much
[1:24:27] closer to Satan's interpretation than
[1:24:30] God's interpretation so they're all
[1:24:33] viewing this and Satan my brother and
[1:24:35] sister would be sitting there saying now
[1:24:37] if that does come to pass it will be a
[1:24:40] manifestation where I am now in control
[1:24:42] and then see how this comes and there it
[1:24:44] is with our lord Jesus he comes and says
[1:24:46] hey look I'm going to bring you here to
[1:24:48] the Pinnacle and I want you to look at
[1:24:50] all of this I'll give to you if you'll
[1:24:52] just bow down and follow me
[1:24:55] shows you religious world doesn't like
[1:24:58] that
[1:25:01] because it shows where the influence
[1:25:04] now if you go listen to the sermon
[1:25:06] Satan's Eden
[1:25:07] you'll see how the prophet of God ties
[1:25:09] it right back to our day that is there
[1:25:11] all this stuff we're coming to the Lord
[1:25:13] building multi this back then he said
[1:25:15] million dollar churches my brother and
[1:25:17] sister now it'd be like have to be a 20
[1:25:19] 30 40 million dollar church amen so look
[1:25:22] at this
[1:25:26] how many in that day
[1:25:29] We Believe
[1:25:31] that that little baby being carried into
[1:25:33] the temple
[1:25:38] how many would believe that was the
[1:25:42] Messiah
[1:25:43] in morphe
[1:25:51] Supernatural
[1:25:53] how do I do this I'll just use the word
[1:25:54] anatomy
[1:25:56] instead of trying to give you a
[1:25:58] breakdown
[1:25:59] I could see sister April going no no no
[1:26:03] go back to the old childhood and uh
[1:26:07] hip bones connected to the I can't even
[1:26:10] remember all the words that go through
[1:26:11] that
[1:26:13] I was all Supernatural my brother and
[1:26:15] sister that baby that was in Mary's arms
[1:26:18] was not a product of a human
[1:26:23] that was God himself in more faith
[1:26:26] being carried in there not one person
[1:26:29] but uh Simeon and Anna recognize who
[1:26:33] this is
[1:26:34] right
[1:26:36] but look what the word of God's done
[1:26:38] today my brother and sister a prophet of
[1:26:40] God come he laid this out God speaking
[1:26:43] through him lay this out that you and I
[1:26:46] today by Revelation couldn't stand and
[1:26:48] say I am Jesus Christ in morphine I am
[1:26:51] God in more faith today it is God it's
[1:26:55] not Flair it's God because it says flesh
[1:26:58] my brother and sister it can't stand the
[1:27:01] fire and everything must pass through
[1:27:03] the fire it's only the supernatural of
[1:27:06] the Lord Jesus Christ that can pass
[1:27:08] through the fire of this day
[1:27:12] you'll find that it is
[1:27:16] I'll get sidetracked if I go there
[1:27:19] just think about Daniel
[1:27:21] Shadrach Meshach and bedniko just think
[1:27:23] about them
[1:27:25] my brother and sister if they had just
[1:27:27] been flesh
[1:27:28] they'd have caught on fire
[1:27:31] not Daniel but shadrache would have just
[1:27:33] caught on fire
[1:27:36] goes to show you see that God had
[1:27:37] already taken over that body they gave
[1:27:40] that body to God and our God is
[1:27:42] fireproof
[1:27:43] Hallelujah aren't you glad about that
[1:27:45] I'm glad our God is fireproof amen
[1:27:48] there's no way
[1:27:50] oh Hallelujah
[1:27:52] so let me keep going here
[1:27:55] I hope you forgive me today my thoughts
[1:27:57] are just such a a jumble all the things
[1:28:00] that have happened
[1:28:04] you see
[1:28:06] as hard as it would have been to see
[1:28:09] that wasn't man's Vision right there
[1:28:11] that was God's vision
[1:28:13] that was God
[1:28:15] in the midst of the people fulfilling
[1:28:18] the word
[1:28:19] and only a handful
[1:28:22] caught the revelation of the opening of
[1:28:25] the word
[1:28:26] it went right over the head of so many
[1:28:28] that they saw this happening they no
[1:28:31] doubt heard Simeon praying they no doubt
[1:28:34] as they was saw Anna my brother and
[1:28:37] sister these things taking place and not
[1:28:38] one understood
[1:28:40] but those who had Revelation understood
[1:28:43] now brother Branham says here in
[1:28:45] expectations
[1:28:48] now the waiting of the Messiah had been
[1:28:50] four thousand years and in every
[1:28:52] generation they had looked for the
[1:28:54] Messiah to come but that did stump
[1:28:57] Simeon
[1:28:59] Simeon didn't look and say man they've
[1:29:01] been waiting for the Messiah for so long
[1:29:03] surely there was a misunderstanding
[1:29:05] there was certainly a misinterpretation
[1:29:07] it didn't stump Simeon why because a
[1:29:11] holy ghost spoke to him God himself
[1:29:13] spoke to Simeon and Simeon knew that
[1:29:16] voice and said you know what this is the
[1:29:18] truth I'll stand with this truth so it
[1:29:20] didn't stump him he was an old man in
[1:29:22] his 80s but still he believed he would
[1:29:24] see the Messiah and he had a long white
[1:29:27] beard I could imagine and white hair and
[1:29:29] he was a great man among the people
[1:29:32] he had great prestige
[1:29:35] but he had a testimony besides that
[1:29:38] that's what I like besides all of his
[1:29:40] scholarships and all of his popularity
[1:29:42] he had a humble heart before God a
[1:29:46] receptive heart that God could deal with
[1:29:48] and he had a testimony by that that he
[1:29:51] was going to see the Lord's Christ
[1:29:52] before he died think of it amen I'm
[1:29:56] telling you my brother and sister the
[1:29:57] whole world today theologians over here
[1:30:00] there's the Rapture is not in the Bible
[1:30:02] uh there's this there's that you can't
[1:30:04] explain this you do this but my brother
[1:30:07] and sister the word come and spoke to
[1:30:09] our hearts and said you know what I'm
[1:30:11] not going to have you consecrate and
[1:30:13] judge yourself now to take you through a
[1:30:15] judgment no sir that's what you're doing
[1:30:17] right now and Saints I want to encourage
[1:30:20] you do your preparation now no one be
[1:30:24] saying another day another day another
[1:30:26] day I'll get over this complex I'll get
[1:30:28] over this hurt from my childhood I'll
[1:30:30] get over this issue I'll get over that
[1:30:32] issue do it today amen and give it to
[1:30:36] God and claim the word claim the
[1:30:39] Revelation the opening of the word today
[1:30:41] say it's mine today Lord it is mine Lord
[1:30:45] and I claim it Hallelujah because
[1:30:48] another day my brother and sister is
[1:30:50] just another day which is nothing more
[1:30:52] than another day and it won't get you
[1:30:54] any closer to the promise but when you
[1:30:57] can come to that place and say Lord I
[1:30:59] believe the word that you have opened
[1:31:01] already
[1:31:03] we're looking for a greater Revelation
[1:31:05] why don't you live the Revelation that's
[1:31:07] already been given
[1:31:09] amen don't be looking off in the future
[1:31:11] that's Satan my brother and sister has
[1:31:13] us stargazing off in the Horizon
[1:31:15] somewhere of a great move of God but how
[1:31:18] about we stand today and say Lord what
[1:31:21] you have opened to me today I believe it
[1:31:24] you know God never gave Simeon a
[1:31:28] detailed book
[1:31:31] he gave him a promise
[1:31:34] and all Simeon could do is follow
[1:31:37] the promise
[1:31:40] hmm amen do we have a promise
[1:31:43] how about Saints we just
[1:31:46] ask the Lord to give us strength
[1:31:48] to follow
[1:31:50] that promise that's right
[1:31:54] excuse me if I get a little excited
[1:31:59] now
[1:32:02] this is scripture verse 25 26 27.
[1:32:07] reiterating once again is what we've
[1:32:09] already read you know that it comes down
[1:32:13] the very Holy Spirit
[1:32:16] that revealed this to Simeon
[1:32:20] led him
[1:32:24] I would like you to catch this
[1:32:27] same holy spirit that said you'll not
[1:32:30] die
[1:32:31] till you see the Lord's Christ
[1:32:34] didn't leave Simeon
[1:32:36] there
[1:32:37] trying to figure it out
[1:32:40] didn't leave Simeon out there
[1:32:43] wandering around like a blind man in the
[1:32:46] dark trying to find you don't see Simeon
[1:32:49] you don't see this testimony of Simeon
[1:32:50] going down the streets of Jerusalem
[1:32:52] saying are you the Lord's Christ are you
[1:32:55] is this baby no my brother or sister
[1:32:57] this leadership of the holy spirit is so
[1:33:01] positive it is so direct it is so real
[1:33:05] that we just need to learn to trust it
[1:33:07] it is we just need to learn to say okay
[1:33:10] Lord it doesn't seem like I'm headed the
[1:33:12] right direction it doesn't seem this is
[1:33:14] the way that I should go but Lord I
[1:33:16] trust you so much and to understand that
[1:33:19] God's plans are perfect he will not lead
[1:33:21] you the prophet of God said God cannot
[1:33:24] lead you away from his word amen
[1:33:29] come on I don't care where you've been
[1:33:31] and what you've stumbled over God will
[1:33:33] not lead you away from his word amen
[1:33:37] amen
[1:33:39] and it was that Holy Spirit
[1:33:41] I don't know what the circumstances are
[1:33:44] I don't none of that
[1:33:47] but I know that the holy spirit let
[1:33:49] Simeon
[1:33:50] now when you realize we've been there
[1:33:53] just uh I'll say a few weeks ago that
[1:33:55] the time is flying
[1:33:59] the temple my brother and sister wasn't
[1:34:01] the size of Grace Tabernacle
[1:34:05] in fact the area to wash your feet and
[1:34:08] stuff to enter into the temple
[1:34:11] was an area that's as big as our church
[1:34:16] walk down the stone steps men on one
[1:34:19] side they even had a rail
[1:34:21] men on one side women on the other you
[1:34:23] washed your feet and prepped yourself
[1:34:25] and washed yourself and you come out and
[1:34:27] exit over here
[1:34:34] God let him
[1:34:36] to the porch
[1:34:38] the entrance
[1:34:40] for him to enter in
[1:34:46] you don't have to lift a hand
[1:34:49] but I just want to put this before you
[1:34:52] do we really believe
[1:34:55] with all of our heart
[1:34:58] that God has led us to the place
[1:35:01] to enter in
[1:35:06] so God called us to go
[1:35:09] study the word study the message that
[1:35:11] has come to us
[1:35:13] to go years and years to stop and say
[1:35:15] Well it fits the word but this isn't the
[1:35:17] right
[1:35:18] entrance
[1:35:20] no I'm sorry that's not what the Holy
[1:35:22] Spirit does
[1:35:24] make run for reference once again the
[1:35:27] song God leads his dear children along
[1:35:30] and when Simeon come that day
[1:35:32] he walks right in there and my brother
[1:35:34] and sister I want you to catch the
[1:35:36] visual of this
[1:35:38] here is Joseph and Mary
[1:35:41] carrying Jesus
[1:35:43] Simeon isn't busting through the crowd
[1:35:46] trying to find a little boy that would
[1:35:49] be inspiration for him to say this is
[1:35:52] the one
[1:35:53] but the Holy Spirit
[1:35:57] Joseph and Mary step by step
[1:36:01] Simeon
[1:36:03] step by step and all the mothers and
[1:36:08] fathers
[1:36:09] there that day
[1:36:11] God takes Simeon
[1:36:13] write to them amen
[1:36:18] I hope you catch the spiritual
[1:36:19] significance of that
[1:36:22] the very Prince of Peace
[1:36:26] come and as a baby he couldn't reach up
[1:36:29] and say Simeon this
[1:36:32] is the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[1:36:36] so God then put that in the heart of
[1:36:38] Simeon this is the one this is the
[1:36:42] Fulfillment of what I promised that I
[1:36:45] would see the Lord's Christ watch you're
[1:36:47] looking at a little baby Simeon that's
[1:36:49] right I am by Revelation I see him of
[1:36:53] who he is and what he was called for and
[1:36:56] the supernatural that will be taken
[1:36:58] place and for a rising and for a falling
[1:37:01] of Israel my brother and sister the
[1:37:04] prophecy was brought right out right
[1:37:06] there and even to the point it was
[1:37:08] spoken the words that this would be in
[1:37:10] my words ill spoken of it would be
[1:37:13] degraded it would be cursed it would be
[1:37:16] cast down but it will be the truth
[1:37:19] Hallelujah and that's what God's done
[1:37:21] right here
[1:37:22] you look with this and so he had this he
[1:37:24] was going to see the Lord's Christ amen
[1:37:27] so he looked at this he led him in the
[1:37:29] temple that day write to Jesus amen so
[1:37:33] what was it the consolation of Israel
[1:37:36] see Simeon been looking for this
[1:37:38] consolation of Israel and the
[1:37:40] consolation of Israel was right there
[1:37:43] maybe no one else well Anna that day but
[1:37:47] no one else my brother and sister would
[1:37:49] have went away from there that day
[1:37:51] with the peace that Simeon had in his
[1:37:55] heart
[1:37:56] what the Lord spoke
[1:37:59] I believed
[1:38:01] and I watched it come to pass
[1:38:04] no doubt my brother and sister Simeon
[1:38:06] walked out of there with a great joy in
[1:38:09] his heart
[1:38:10] oh look God has brought this to pass
[1:38:14] amen but look at this you know
[1:38:17] I I hope this doesn't come across too
[1:38:20] hard but I felt led to say it so here we
[1:38:22] go
[1:38:23] how is it today that people say well the
[1:38:25] Lord led me by the spirit to the message
[1:38:29] but refused to follow the leadership of
[1:38:31] the Holy Spirit
[1:38:34] here's what the message says
[1:38:36] and here's what I think
[1:38:42] now I can take this quote and if I stop
[1:38:45] at this sentence I can shout hallelujah
[1:38:48] for the first half of this quote
[1:38:51] but the last half the quotes hard for me
[1:38:53] to swallow so I will just cut the quote
[1:38:56] off right here
[1:38:59] that way I'm happy
[1:39:03] but see the holy spirit that called us
[1:39:05] to hear this word of the hour
[1:39:08] is the holy spirit that's going to call
[1:39:10] us to come completely amen into a
[1:39:15] relationship with the Lord's Christ come
[1:39:17] into a complete relationship which means
[1:39:19] my brother and sister I'm still working
[1:39:21] on it so don't think that I'm hammering
[1:39:23] on you I'm still working on this but
[1:39:25] it's coming easier and easier to go
[1:39:27] through the word and go through the
[1:39:29] message and stop and say that's got to
[1:39:31] get out of my life I've got to take this
[1:39:33] and get rid of this I've got to toss
[1:39:36] this away I've got to forsake this
[1:39:38] feeling or this idea I've got to do that
[1:39:41] because God's working on us
[1:39:43] God's bringing his word out and and
[1:39:45] Satan
[1:39:47] just makes it so easy
[1:39:50] right this morning our brother rap crook
[1:39:52] will be preaching in Hickory may be
[1:39:54] already done
[1:39:56] about boiling frogs in Babylon
[1:40:01] sounds like an interesting topic doesn't
[1:40:03] it what is boiling frogs in Babylon got
[1:40:05] to do
[1:40:08] it's got to do with your life
[1:40:11] Satan just keeps turning the heat up
[1:40:16] go to Hickory Bible Tabernacle if
[1:40:19] nothing else just go there to look at
[1:40:21] brother rap's little screen
[1:40:24] and he's got a frog
[1:40:27] sitting in what he calls a Jacuzzi
[1:40:30] his hot tub
[1:40:33] fire under it
[1:40:35] what is happening
[1:40:37] brother app
[1:40:39] will be telling them this morning
[1:40:41] how Satan's going to make them really
[1:40:43] happy right to the moment they get to
[1:40:44] hell
[1:40:46] they won't be happy after that but
[1:40:48] they'll be happy all the way there
[1:40:52] my mother and sister I want you to think
[1:40:54] about it
[1:40:56] amen I was tempted this morning just to
[1:40:58] stream it and just put wraps sermon up
[1:41:02] on the screen
[1:41:03] I was sitting there in my office just
[1:41:05] crying my eyes out and I thought well
[1:41:07] that'd be a lot simpler
[1:41:08] but I don't believe this time I spent
[1:41:10] studying this was just to be put on hope
[1:41:13] and believe God put it to bring it to
[1:41:15] this hour
[1:41:16] amen so what happened
[1:41:18] we refuse to follow the leadership of
[1:41:21] the Holy Spirit my brother and sister we
[1:41:23] were designed by God to follow the
[1:41:25] leadership of something
[1:41:27] so if we step away from the leadership
[1:41:29] of the Holy Spirit we will step into the
[1:41:32] leadership of another spirit
[1:41:35] and so why don't we just simply oh
[1:41:37] brother Paul Paul you're just being too
[1:41:39] too whatever Common Sense maybe call it
[1:41:43] why don't we just look at the word and
[1:41:45] if the word says don't then we just
[1:41:47] don't and the word says do then we just
[1:41:50] do instead of asking everyone to give us
[1:41:52] 14 interpretations of why we should do
[1:41:55] my brother and sister if God sent a
[1:41:58] prophet we believe that was the
[1:41:59] leadership of the Holy Spirit then we
[1:42:01] should say Lord I want to follow that
[1:42:03] leadership I don't need someone
[1:42:05] explaining me out of that leadership I
[1:42:08] don't want somebody giving me a
[1:42:10] comfortable way to live in this life
[1:42:13] that's outside of the word of God
[1:42:17] but Simeon comes he takes the baby he
[1:42:19] prays a blessing over the baby and it's
[1:42:22] there that this blessing is so
[1:42:24] incredible and I've got to hurry amen so
[1:42:27] real to Simeon my brother and sister
[1:42:28] it's there verses 28 29 and on then he
[1:42:32] took him up in his arms and blessed God
[1:42:33] and said Lord now let us that servant
[1:42:36] depart in peace according to Thy word
[1:42:38] see he didn't even view it as his own
[1:42:40] words that he was going to depart in
[1:42:42] peace
[1:42:44] he was trusting God that his departure
[1:42:46] would be in peace
[1:42:48] where my Knives have seen thy salvation
[1:42:51] which thou has prepared before the face
[1:42:53] of all people I like to lighten the
[1:42:56] Gentiles my brother and sister this
[1:42:58] event right here was for you and I and
[1:43:00] the glory of God glory of thy People
[1:43:02] Israel and Joseph and his mother Marvel
[1:43:05] now these are people marveling at what
[1:43:08] Simeon says and here is Mary that met an
[1:43:11] angel
[1:43:14] there shouldn't be anything that would
[1:43:15] cause her to Marvel
[1:43:17] I'm telling you my brother and sister if
[1:43:19] an angel come down and said you are
[1:43:20] going to have a child by the Holy Ghost
[1:43:22] and you have a child my brother and
[1:43:24] sister shouldn't be anything else in
[1:43:25] life shock you
[1:43:27] but we're human and we tend after a
[1:43:30] little season and I just want to put it
[1:43:32] to you this day how many times in our
[1:43:34] life has God come down on the scene and
[1:43:37] we can with all honesty in our soul say
[1:43:40] it was the Lord that came on the scene
[1:43:42] but you give it two years and we've
[1:43:44] forgotten all about it
[1:43:49] hmm
[1:43:50] so maybe Mary was just a normal little
[1:43:53] girl
[1:43:54] in Israel
[1:43:57] because she's just like you and I
[1:44:00] um
[1:44:05] you wouldn't believe that if you're a
[1:44:07] Catholic though
[1:44:09] you'd think that Mary was just right
[1:44:11] there
[1:44:12] jumped out of the pages of Mythology
[1:44:15] and was the greatest thing
[1:44:17] there was
[1:44:20] an amazing how idolatry can just creep
[1:44:23] in
[1:44:26] amen taking this from the message from
[1:44:29] what the prophet said every Generations
[1:44:31] had a witness of the supernatural
[1:44:33] every generation has been given a vision
[1:44:36] right scripture says without a vision
[1:44:38] the people perish and my brother and
[1:44:40] sister this generation has seen the
[1:44:42] problem boy I'm struggling this morning
[1:44:44] proclamation of Christ once again in the
[1:44:47] temple
[1:44:51] come on that ought to get somebody a
[1:44:53] little excited God's got a proclamation
[1:44:56] in this generation in the temple where
[1:44:59] is the temple
[1:45:01] Hallelujah we are the Temple of the Holy
[1:45:05] Ghost amen so the word has declared just
[1:45:09] as sure as it did to Mary just as sure
[1:45:12] as it did to Simeon it has made a
[1:45:15] declaration that God would once again be
[1:45:18] in his Temple oh Hallelujah I say thank
[1:45:22] you Lord we don't have a Mecca to go to
[1:45:25] we don't need to go back to Israel to
[1:45:27] find a temple God has proclaimed and
[1:45:30] embodied himself in the temple today oh
[1:45:35] thank you Lord Jesus my it's interesting
[1:45:38] how we need such reminders my brother
[1:45:40] and sister but I'm telling you God is
[1:45:42] going to give us the reminder because we
[1:45:45] are the very Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:48] amen but he didn't come back in the
[1:45:51] temple as a babe
[1:45:55] there's a lot of Babe Revelations out
[1:45:57] there
[1:45:58] baby acting
[1:46:00] producing baby
[1:46:02] I'm telling you
[1:46:05] I think Jerry and I is loving
[1:46:07] grandparents are going to let deki drive
[1:46:09] us home from church today
[1:46:15] no that has to be maturity Amen to
[1:46:18] manifest the gift
[1:46:21] hmm are you with me
[1:46:23] has to be maturity to manifest there's a
[1:46:26] lot of people got all kinds of the Lord
[1:46:27] told me
[1:46:29] this nonsense like the Lord told me I I
[1:46:31] should go you know do this and I should
[1:46:33] go do that and it's just right there
[1:46:35] black and white in front of them
[1:46:39] I was just gonna
[1:46:41] share one of the later comments brother
[1:46:43] George shared with me but it wouldn't be
[1:46:44] fair to brother George but it's quite
[1:46:46] humorous and direct to the point
[1:46:48] now look at this
[1:46:50] as our consolation our comfort
[1:46:52] our peace
[1:46:55] can we say this morning we have that
[1:46:58] if we can't say this morning
[1:47:01] that we have our consolation
[1:47:04] then I encourage you not to even leave
[1:47:05] the sanctuary today till you break
[1:47:08] through and let God be the one who gives
[1:47:11] that consolation gives that peace to you
[1:47:13] because my brother and sister without
[1:47:15] that we are like a ping pong ball or
[1:47:18] whatever a pinball just bouncing from
[1:47:21] one thing to the next amen
[1:47:23] it's not what God called us to do but
[1:47:25] you see he come came as a lion he came
[1:47:28] as a lamb
[1:47:30] and now he's came as a bridegroom
[1:47:34] so what is our position today
[1:47:36] I want to recognize my bridegroom
[1:47:39] when my bridegrooms in the temple
[1:47:42] if you're with me when my bridegrooms in
[1:47:44] the temple I want to recognize the
[1:47:48] bridegroom is in the temple
[1:47:50] my brother and sister you see he's come
[1:47:52] down once again in morphe right that's
[1:47:56] it he's present we need to recognize him
[1:48:02] sorry I'm skipping some of this it might
[1:48:04] be confusing forgive me
[1:48:07] Queen of Sheba now God in all generation
[1:48:11] has had his servant and his Prophet or
[1:48:14] his message somewhere in the earth going
[1:48:16] at all times God has never been without
[1:48:19] a witness and in every generation they
[1:48:22] received a witness of God then if the
[1:48:24] people received that witness then that
[1:48:27] is a golden age for that generation if
[1:48:30] they turn that witness down then it is a
[1:48:33] dark age for that Generation Now I want
[1:48:35] to bring just a little bit of
[1:48:37] understanding and what the prophet of
[1:48:39] God said here we're looking in the day
[1:48:41] right now where they have turned down
[1:48:45] now does that mean the bride of Christ
[1:48:47] has a dark age
[1:48:49] no but I want you to understand right
[1:48:51] now we all understand money I'll just
[1:48:53] use that as the uh the the breakdown my
[1:48:56] brother and sister you can go home I
[1:48:58] won't even quote the numbers to you you
[1:49:00] can go home and go back and just go back
[1:49:03] 20 years and compare the value of the
[1:49:05] dollar then and its purchase power to
[1:49:08] now and you'll see that our nation is on
[1:49:11] a downward slide
[1:49:15] it is coming to the place that they just
[1:49:18] produce more dollars to do what they
[1:49:21] want but do you realize it's not just
[1:49:23] their way of dealing with the debt the
[1:49:25] debt is intentional
[1:49:27] you understand that the dead is
[1:49:29] intentional
[1:49:30] I'll give you a common example
[1:49:33] when the theory come into our government
[1:49:35] on economics
[1:49:36] that a part of the government would be
[1:49:39] given X millions or billions of dollars
[1:49:42] then they told them if you don't use
[1:49:45] that you will lose it
[1:49:48] so what did they do they started wasting
[1:49:51] the money
[1:49:52] because they want that amount of money

[1:52:52] all I want to make sure you catch it
[1:52:54] but each generation what does it get
[1:52:58] its opportunity at the fresh word of God
[1:53:02] each time amen amen
[1:53:05] amen that's why I'm just throwing that
[1:53:06] out of there the quote goes on about how
[1:53:09] they take the truth and make a
[1:53:10] denomination and Etc but I want you to
[1:53:12] just catch that one God has given to you
[1:53:14] and I a fresh opportunity to catch the
[1:53:18] revelation of Jesus Christ in this day
[1:53:22] Hallelujah
[1:53:23] well my brother and sister what we are
[1:53:25] today would be if we went back
[1:53:28] a hundred years
[1:53:30] 200 years
[1:53:31] 500 years
[1:53:33] A Thousand Years
[1:53:36] see there's no age that God said this is
[1:53:38] going to be the easiest stage
[1:53:41] everyone
[1:53:48] I don't like to do that but I like to be
[1:53:50] transparent
[1:53:52] I was listening as I finished up my
[1:53:54] sermon this morning right before Brother
[1:53:56] David called
[1:53:58] and I'm glad he called I don't
[1:53:59] misunderstand there
[1:54:01] but I was just finishing the last of my
[1:54:03] notes
[1:54:04] and I'm listening to brother Rapp
[1:54:07] and he was like yeah
[1:54:10] look back in those ages
[1:54:14] I I couldn't I I don't know that I could
[1:54:16] have dealt with it having them shove
[1:54:18] slivers
[1:54:20] under my fingernails
[1:54:23] breaking my bones
[1:54:27] I don't think I could deal with that I'm
[1:54:30] glad I'm in this age
[1:54:34] but I want you to look
[1:54:37] God looked back down through time had a
[1:54:39] prophet anointed to preach a message
[1:54:42] greatest battle
[1:54:45] ever
[1:54:46] fought
[1:54:49] I can't handle the idea
[1:54:52] being stretched until my bones popped
[1:54:54] out of joint
[1:54:58] I mean cut with a thousand
[1:55:01] little cuts and bleeding slowly to death
[1:55:07] but I want you to think about Satan
[1:55:11] he's come right down in this hour
[1:55:14] and his deception is a thousand little
[1:55:17] thoughts a thousand little complexes a
[1:55:21] thousand emotions all kinds of things
[1:55:25] you can't go anywhere I appreciated what
[1:55:27] brother Chris preached to us how that
[1:55:29] they have come so smooth
[1:55:33] that all they need is a few milliseconds
[1:55:36] to plant something in your mind
[1:55:40] is the bride under attack
[1:55:43] yes she is
[1:55:45] but as a bride got a defense
[1:55:47] in this hour
[1:55:49] amen
[1:55:50] God's got a defense in this hour
[1:55:53] and what is it doing right here my
[1:55:55] brother and sister it's got this
[1:55:57] opportunity of the fresh word of God his
[1:56:01] mercies new every morning we get out of
[1:56:03] bed and we can sit there and the devil
[1:56:06] would try to come but we can sit there
[1:56:08] and say you know what thank you Lord
[1:56:10] amen thank you Lord I Thank you for the
[1:56:12] word I see this I understand that maybe
[1:56:14] you read something last night in your
[1:56:16] Bible or in the message and you didn't
[1:56:18] understand it but you wake up
[1:56:20] and you go that's what it means what is
[1:56:23] it fresh
[1:56:25] every morning amen hallelujah
[1:56:29] oh Hallelujah
[1:56:32] amen sister Ruth will you come
[1:56:35] Hallelujah
[1:56:43] would we just stand Saints
[1:56:48] and I would just ask you in your heart
[1:56:52] maybe you just speak to the Lord this
[1:56:54] morning
[1:56:55] and say Lord
[1:56:57] what is your vision for me
[1:57:00] see I don't want I don't want Paul's
[1:57:02] Vision that's right
[1:57:03] [Music]
[1:57:04] many thoughts I thought this morning
[1:57:09] how wonderful
[1:57:11] I didn't want him to be memories as it
[1:57:12] were in the sense that has come to pass
[1:57:15] but to hear my brother Gideon's Vision
[1:57:19] to young people
[1:57:21] his vision to the church his vision for
[1:57:25] his grandsons
[1:57:30] brother and sister what is our vision
[1:57:34] what is our vision today or are we just
[1:57:38] gonna just kind of shuffle along
[1:57:42] I'll tell you with my heart lifted up I
[1:57:45] want to say Lord I want a vision
[1:57:48] like Simeon had
[1:57:51] Lord I I don't want to pass from this
[1:57:53] life
[1:57:55] kind of a two-edged way to explain this
[1:57:58] but I want to pass from this life my
[1:58:01] brother and sister I would desire to be
[1:58:02] one of those alive and remain at the
[1:58:05] coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:58:07] amen but I also don't want to be one
[1:58:09] that passes from this life till I have
[1:58:12] met the Lord's Christ face to face
[1:58:15] till I know him and know that the word
[1:58:18] has come alive and I am present with him
[1:58:21] and he is not just present with me but
[1:58:23] he's in me
[1:58:25] and he's leading me in guiding me and I
[1:58:27] just would ask you today just to close
[1:58:30] your eyes if you would and I I just this
[1:58:32] is strong upon my heart maybe you slip a
[1:58:35] hand up and say Lord just open to me
[1:58:37] Father Lord give me Clarity what what
[1:58:40] your vision for me is
[1:58:43] what it is Lord where you're leading me
[1:58:45] where you're guiding me Lord you called
[1:58:48] me I know that you've called me to
[1:58:50] something Lord help me to see it help me
[1:58:54] to live it father to walk in that Vision
[1:58:57] let me be a fulfillment of a word in
[1:59:00] this hour Lord that is my heart's desire
[1:59:03] today to be like Simeon Lord and walk
[1:59:07] even in the midst of the people in the
[1:59:09] Temple and be led
[1:59:14] they led to you Lord
[1:59:16] led to the Lord's Christ
[1:59:20] that I could fulfill my part
[1:59:22] of this gospel in this hour prophecy
[1:59:26] Lord that's my heart's desire
[1:59:30] Lord I pray you disturb our hearts don't
[1:59:32] let us be a church that is caught in
[1:59:35] complacency
[1:59:37] don't let us be a church Lord that is
[1:59:40] satisfied to be lukewarmed
[1:59:43] Lord don't let us be a church that hears
[1:59:45] the word of God but it's not anointed
[1:59:47] enough to move from our present position
[1:59:51] [Music]
[1:59:56] help us Lord
[1:59:59] help us Lord lay aside every sin that so
[2:00:02] easily besets us
[2:00:05] help us the Lord to look at your word
[2:00:07] and if we don't understand it not to
[2:00:09] just pass over it and go on
[2:00:11] it's a stop and say Lord I need to
[2:00:13] understand you
[2:00:15] I need to understand your written word
[2:00:19] let us not be moved Lord I Pray by the
[2:00:22] Holy Spirit
[2:00:24] maybe to pray for one
[2:00:27] but yet we would use the excuse I'm too
[2:00:29] busy
[2:00:30] maybe you would call us the workplace or
[2:00:33] home or car
[2:00:35] to pray
[2:00:36] [Music]
[2:00:38] and we would offer
[2:00:40] an alternative time
[2:00:43] Lord maybe you would call upon us
[2:00:46] to deal with something in our own life
[2:00:50] and father
[2:00:52] we would lack the motivation
[2:00:55] to act upon it
[2:00:57] all I can say today is Lord forgive us
[2:01:01] Lord forgive us
[2:01:04] Lord if you call me let me answer
[2:01:07] Lord if you move upon my spirit let my
[2:01:10] spirit respond to you Lord
[2:01:13] if you call me to change Lord let me
[2:01:16] with joy change
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:19] let me run father to possess the promise
[2:01:24] Lord let me rise up to the mark of the
[2:01:27] high holy
[2:01:29] that is my heart today Lord
[2:01:33] I don't want to miss the vision
[2:01:36] I want the vision to be re revealed or
[2:01:40] reflected in Me Lord
[2:01:42] father I just lift my hand and I say
[2:01:44] Lord come and help me Lead Me Lord Jesus
