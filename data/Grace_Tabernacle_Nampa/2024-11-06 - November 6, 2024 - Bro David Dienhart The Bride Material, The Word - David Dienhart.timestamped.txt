[35:41] you're here to feed our
[35:43] souls you're here to do the exceeding
[35:46] and abundantly above all that we ask or
[35:49] think and now father may we lay aside
[35:52] the Affairs of today the worries the
[35:56] frustrations the
[35:58] discouragement and let us
[36:01] Focus Lord upon your presence upon what
[36:05] you've given us your
[36:08] word Lord Jesus we are
[36:13] not here just to be here we're here to
[36:17] meet
[36:19] you and so Lord that's our our desire
[36:24] and that's your
[36:26] will I pray that you would bring us into
[36:28] a greater unity and a fellowship with
[36:31] you
[36:34] individually and let us realize Lord
[36:37] what we are here to represent and who we
[36:39] are here to obey and what is our
[36:45] absolute we pray now that you would
[36:47] bless your
[36:48] word as it goes forth as you speak it
[36:52] forth through this vessel of clay this
[36:56] instrument is nothing until you pick it
[36:58] up and use
[37:00] it and so father as the word comes out
[37:03] of these lips may it go into your heart
[37:07] of your children their
[37:09] soul and may they walk out of here
[37:12] raised in a higher Plaine we pray for

[37:17] and
[37:17] glorified in thy name we pray with
[37:21] Thanksgiving because we know that if we
[37:23] ask anything in your name it'll be done
[37:28] and so father we rejoice in
[37:31] this because your words cannot fail you
[37:35] cannot lie and we give you thanks in
[37:38] jesus' name amen amen amen I'd like you
[37:43] to turn with me in your Bibles to
[37:49] Matthew chapter
[37:54] 4 My Title tonight is the bride material
[37:58] the
[38:00] word the bride material the word my
[38:03] subject is she will only believe the
[38:06] word and it's a god-given
[38:11] quality so my title is the bride
[38:14] material the
[38:17] word and the subject she will only only
[38:21] I want you underline that in your mind
[38:23] only believe the word it's a god-given
[38:28] quality what's the god-given quality to
[38:33] believe Matthew 4 verse
[38:36] one then when Jesus was led up of the
[38:39] spirit Into the Wilderness then was
[38:42] Jesus led up of the spirit Into the
[38:45] Wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[38:48] now can you imagine and not imagine but
[38:51] realized that Jesus led him into the
[38:54] Wilderness to be tempted tried
[38:59] did he lead
[39:01] job yes is he leading us yes all right
[39:06] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[39:08] nights he was afterward
[39:10] hungered now we know what the prophet
[39:13] said about a fast you don't get hungry
[39:14] during a fast but then when you're
[39:17] hungry afterwards you're
[39:19] hungry but when you go into a fast you
[39:22] don't get hungry so if you want to know
[39:24] the difference between a real fast and
[39:26] one that's just some helpful thing but a
[39:30] real fast a Godly fast you won't be
[39:33] hungry all right verse three I thought
[39:36] I'd Dro that in for extra measure it's
[39:37] just a sideline and when the tempter
[39:40] came to him he said now listen to the
[39:43] tempter you meet him every single day
[39:45] don't tell me you don't because if
[39:47] you're a Christian you're you're meeting
[39:49] that tempter every day he'll try to
[39:52] reason with you speak to you and one
[39:55] purpose alone get you off
[39:57] of the
[40:00] word all right but when the tempter came
[40:04] to him he said if thou be the Son of God
[40:07] command that these Stones be made breads
[40:10] he were dealing with his physical
[40:12] being if you're the son you can speak to
[40:15] these stones and make him
[40:17] bread but watch Jesus's
[40:20] reply but he answered and said it is
[40:23] written all right I'm going to emphasize
[40:25] that in great big letters
[40:28] his answer was it is
[40:32] written man shall not live by bread
[40:34] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[40:37] out of the mouth of God then he goes to
[40:40] the next Temptation Jesus answered and
[40:43] said him again verse seven I don't I
[40:45] won't read through those but it is
[40:46] written
[40:47] again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[40:50] God he offered him a supernatural
[40:52] element
[40:53] now brother Braham said that was real
[40:55] bait for the Pentecostals
[40:59] oh my just give us some Supernatural we
[41:01] know if we do the Supernatural That's
[41:02] the evidence that God's with us or God's
[41:05] in us no it isn't evidence God's with
[41:07] you but it's not the evidence that he's
[41:08] living in
[41:10] you listen let me tell you right now the
[41:13] anointing of the Holy Spirit upon you is
[41:15] no evidence that God's dwelling in your
[41:19] soul I didn't hear any mens on that I'm
[41:23] listen you can be Anointed with that
[41:24] same spirit and still be a devil in the
[41:27] Soul so the anointing isn't the evidence
[41:31] it's the word revealed to you personally
[41:34] by that spirit is the evidence because
[41:37] you recognize the word for your hour and
[41:39] time that's the evidence that you have
[41:42] the ability to hear the
[41:44] word
[41:46] amen that's exactly what it is you go
[41:48] back and see I I was going to cover some
[41:51] of that tonight out of the church age
[41:52] book but you can go back if you want to
[41:54] see it we can show it to you the
[41:56] evidence is here heing and receiving the
[41:58] word by
[42:00] Revelation all right now so let's get
[42:03] back to my I don't want to get on my
[42:05] sideline here now verse 10 he tempted
[42:08] him again showed him the kingdoms of the
[42:10] world the glory of them but Jesus saith
[42:12] unto him get thee hence
[42:14] Satan for it is written see it is
[42:19] written what Jesus stay with here the
[42:22] word the
[42:24] word we ought to be very thankful and to
[42:27] realize that God has given us his word
[42:31] everything we need is in the word
[42:36] everything and the word if you're a
[42:39] Believer Born Again believer the word is
[42:41] in your
[42:42] ship that's
[42:44] right and his way is perfect his leading
[42:47] is perfect and he made your way
[42:50] Perfect all right so Jesus again said
[42:53] for it is written Thou shalt Worship the
[42:55] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[42:58] serve see he it's every time I'm making
[43:02] the emphasis that he went back to the
[43:04] word he said the the weakest of
[43:06] Christians can defeat the Devil anywhere
[43:09] at any time on any PL at any place by
[43:12] the
[43:13] word by the word I want you to notice
[43:16] before you're seated here before we read
[43:18] another scripture I want you to notice
[43:20] here as we go through this tonight that
[43:23] Jesus here did not reason with the Devil
[43:27] he went right to the word and that's
[43:29] where he
[43:33] stood now what are we to
[43:36] do if we're growing up maturity of
[43:39] himself we will do the same thing our
[43:43] Victory is the word and we are his
[43:46] victory because we are the word
[43:48] amen all
[43:50] right turn with me to
[43:54] Philippians Philippians 1 verse vers 20
[43:58] and
[43:59] 21 Paul speaking according to my Earnest
[44:02] expectation and my hope that in nothing
[44:04] I shall be ashamed but that with all
[44:07] boldness as always so now also Christ
[44:11] the
[44:12] word Christ is the anointed word amen
[44:17] amen all right Christ in you Christ the
[44:21] anointed word in all boldness as always
[44:23] so now Christ all shall be magnified in
[44:26] my body whether it be by life or by
[44:32] death Paul has been ministering on the
[44:35] change of thought the change of thought
[44:37] is a right mental attitude toward the
[44:39] word that's in your heart and written
[44:42] here in the
[44:43] scriptures that's exactly what a change
[44:46] of thought is it's a attitude is a
[44:49] positioning and when you change your
[44:51] thought and bring it in line with the
[44:52] word the word's got to be manifest
[44:55] because just a right mental attitude
[44:57] toward the word will bring it to
[45:00] pass I may always said that over and
[45:02] over again the prophet said thus sayeth
[45:04] the Lord he said the angel told me that
[45:07] a right mental attitude toward the word
[45:09] of God will bring it to
[45:13] pass
[45:15] amen yeah we do need to change the
[45:17] thought we need to bring our thought
[45:19] mental con our thought our spirit realm
[45:22] our mental realm under obedience to the
[45:25] word and stand right there only
[45:30] believe now the next verse
[45:33] 21 because he wanted to see that the
[45:35] what what what for what for that the
[45:37] that God Christ will be magnified in my
[45:39] body what body whether it be by life or
[45:42] by Death Christ will be magnified yes
[45:45] amen all right verse 21 for me to live
[45:49] is Christ we're talking about our
[45:52] absolute here Paul was speaking about
[45:54] his absolute for me to live is the word
[45:58] for me to live is Christ everything I
[46:01] need in this life everything absolutely
[46:04] everything is the
[46:06] word I don't need to go off of it away
[46:08] from it reason with anybody about it it
[46:11] comes right back to this word if that
[46:14] word said so I believe it if it
[46:15] commanded something I want to do it
[46:18] that's all there's to it it's
[46:20] written all right okay so for me to live
[46:23] as Christ and to die as gain you may be
[46:25] seated God God bless you bride material
[46:30] here's something that brother Bram said
[46:32] he said you can't make yourself
[46:35] believe amen you can't make yourself
[46:40] believe he said you he said it's
[46:45] something it's a quality that's in you
[46:50] you can't make yourself you can't make
[46:52] you believe is what he's trying to say
[46:54] it's a it's something and it's a quality
[46:56] it's something that's a quality that's
[46:59] in
[47:02] you all right he said and and he and he
[47:07] he was referring now I'll just stop
[47:09] right there and I'll go back to here's
[47:10] something else there's brother Brandon
[47:12] speaking on the message perfect
[47:15] Faith now it's talking about the bride
[47:19] material material means substance it
[47:22] also means evidence so something that's
[47:25] material is a substance material is a
[47:28] substance of something and and also
[47:31] means an Evidence it can mean an
[47:33] Evidence you take a material of
[47:35] something it's an Evidence of something
[47:36] else it's an
[47:38] Evidence okay and so on paragraph 114 a
[47:42] perfect faith and so when a man lives by
[47:45] faith now we know that faith is a
[47:47] revelation and when a man lives by faith
[47:50] and walks by faith I mean substance
[47:54] Faith he is Isola ated from the entire
[47:58] world and becomes a new creature in
[48:00] Christ he's absolutely become isolated
[48:03] from the entire
[48:05] world now you know now you see what
[48:08] we're to walk by and we'll come into
[48:10] this more as we go he said there there
[48:13] now there now you're getting into bride
[48:16] material he said see he said you're
[48:19] getting into rapturing condition that
[48:23] means for each one of us not just the
[48:25] pastor the the trustees that means for

[48:33] individual amen walks in a world with
[48:36] God
[48:37] alone I pray that that strikes your soul
[48:40] that you're walking with God alone
[48:42] you're not walking with God and the
[48:45] outer man you're walking with God
[48:49] Alone other words I said that because
[48:52] the the Bond woman will not be air with
[48:55] the free yeah amen that's right because
[48:59] you're the free woman you're the one
[49:01] that has come alive you're the new
[49:02] creature you're God's
[49:04] material amen and you're not and it's no
[49:07] evidence of what the outside feelings
[49:09] are is the evidence of what you have on
[49:11] the inside because it's not air with
[49:14] this free woman or the free word on the
[49:16] inside NE and plus the Elder is going to
[49:20] serve this quickening power this
[49:22] quickening spirit that is me on the
[49:24] inside
[49:27] amen that's right the second man was the
[49:29] Lord From Heaven is that right first man
[49:32] is Earthly the second man hello the New
[49:35] Birth the new creation is the word is
[49:37] the is a quickening spirit the Bible
[49:40] said and the prophet said you are the
[49:42] spirit of God that lives in
[49:46] you and that spirit of God is the
[49:49] quickener of the word it's a quickening
[49:52] spirit he said I'll also it will also
[49:55] Quicken your mortal body and bring it
[49:57] subject to
[49:59] what his
[50:03] word hallelujah his word all right so he
[50:08] said every individual walks in the world
[50:10] with God Alone you're baptized into this
[50:12] kingdom and there's nobody in there but
[50:14] you and God watch what he said he gives
[50:16] the orders he that loves me keeps my
[50:19] commandment he that loves me will keep
[50:22] my
[50:22] word he that does not keep my word does
[50:25] not love me
[50:27] amen all right he said he gives the
[50:31] orders and you the body you the vessel
[50:39] you
[50:40] amen the part of him the body member you
[50:44] pack them
[50:46] out whatever he says there's not a
[50:50] Shadow of Doubt nowhere you walk right
[50:53] on whatever he says that ought to to be
[50:58] ultimate there's no adding to it there's
[51:01] no taking away from it there's no
[51:03] listening to anything contrary to it
[51:05] though the devil will try to reason you
[51:07] out of it and try to get you to give you
[51:10] a reason why you believe the word you
[51:12] don't have to give him a reason about
[51:14] why you believe it you don't have to
[51:15] explain it we cannot I don't have to
[51:17] explain at all to you why I believe what
[51:21] the word said he said it and that
[51:23] settles it
[51:28] amen that's the word you said it that
[51:30] settles it but the devil's going to ask
[51:32] you why you believe such and
[51:34] such I don't I don't even have to know
[51:37] why if he said it my soul says Amen to
[51:40] it and I believe
[51:42] it and it doesn't change it God's word
[51:46] is Flawless God's word is complete God's
[51:49] word is is absolutely perfect beyond our
[51:54] estimation of perfect he's
[51:58] perfect Hallelujah all right so whatever
[52:02] he says there's not a shadow of a doubt
[52:04] any nowhere you walk right on because
[52:06] why it's the word if there's a Shadow of
[52:09] Doubt there's something wrong with your
[52:12] experience with him if there's a Shadow
[52:14] of Doubt if your soul has a Shadow of
[52:17] Doubt you better get to the word real
[52:19] quick and ask for the shadow to be
[52:21] removed because in him there's no shadow
[52:24] of turning he is the light and he he
[52:26] that's walking in the light walks with
[52:29] God and God is the word and in him is no
[52:36] Darkness you can't add to the word and
[52:38] take away from it the original color is
[52:41] white you add anything to it it's
[52:44] perverted you have a shadow
[52:48] then the reason there's a shadow there's
[52:51] Light present but then there's a
[52:53] negative
[52:56] but in the word is no
[52:58] negative the word has no negative it's
[53:01] all
[53:02] positive all right
[53:05] now there's not a Shadow of Doubt
[53:08] anywhere you walk on the Lord says this
[53:10] there's nobody in the world can talk you
[53:13] out of it but how easy we are to be
[53:17] talked out of it how easy we are to have
[53:20] no patience to wait on it and we go out
[53:22] and try to accomplish what we think the
[53:25] word is trying to tell us to do we go on
[53:27] her own not under headship but on her
[53:30] own and that's exactly what Eve did hey
[53:33] Adam I found a way to fulfill God's word
[53:36] of bringing bringing reproduction
[53:39] here and she went out on her own without
[53:42] headship out of her out of her
[53:46] headship and that's exactly that
[53:48] dominating female Spirit rules this
[53:51] political realm in the world and the
[53:52] nation today is that dominating Spirit
[53:55] female Spirit which brother brandham
[53:57] said is the greatest curse in the
[54:05] world we don't have to have a woman
[54:07] president the woman's already
[54:10] president hello spiritually she already
[54:15] dominates this nation is number 13 I say
[54:19] don't get caught up in that political
[54:21] nonsense stay out of it stay with the
[54:24] word go back to the word everything you
[54:27] need is the word and the bride is the
[54:29] word and her Fellowship is the word and
[54:31] her word is her absolute nothing else
[54:35] you don't get caught up in their
[54:37] political moves stay out of their
[54:39] political moves there's a lot of things
[54:41] well we you don't believe in abortion
[54:44] yeah yeah we don't believe in abortion
[54:45] right we agree to those things but that
[54:47] is no R well why don't you join up with
[54:49] the sin because you're doing it out of
[54:52] the word you're doing it out of headship
[54:54] you're doing it wrong
[54:57] you're going about it you're not going
[54:58] about it according to the
[55:05] word you see the word is our
[55:10] head all
[55:12] right if there's nobody in the world can
[55:14] talk you there's nobody in the world
[55:16] talk yet you go right on just the same
[55:18] now you're Now That's What Makes You
[55:20] unusual and er radical to people around
[55:23] you because you're staying with the word
[55:26] and you can't explain
[55:31] it I don't care any preacher that and I
[55:34] say it I probably said it myself stand
[55:36] up say am I making any sense to you that
[55:39] is
[55:41] wrong it's not the word making sense to
[55:44] you that's
[55:48] reasoning it's the word whether you
[55:50] believe it or not it doesn't have to
[55:52] make sense
[55:58] no it doesn't have to make sense he said
[56:00] it that's all I need to know he said it
[56:03] I believe
[56:04] that it's
[56:07] written and the Holy Spirit will always
[56:10] go back to the
[56:12] word can't lead you off of the word away
[56:14] from the word it always leads you right
[56:16] back to the word and all you must do
[56:18] with the word is only believe what's
[56:21] only mean
[56:22] alone the word alone you don't have to
[56:25] reason with it figure it
[56:29] out don't go back to your feelings don't
[56:32] go back to your feelings then you've
[56:34] made yourself an idol you've made
[56:36] yourself your feelings become what
[56:37] you're bowing to instead of the
[56:42] word nothing will if that's the case
[56:45] your feelings are your absolute
[56:51] then all right you go on you're just
[56:53] coming see what are you doing now you go
[56:55] right on just the same now you're coming
[56:57] into perfect Faith what is perfect Faith
[57:01] God's Own
[57:03] Faith perfect Perfection perfect
[57:08] Faith perfect Perfection that cannot
[57:11] fail that faith never
[57:15] fails yes he was a Mystic to them with
[57:18] this perfect faith and so is it now with
[57:21] those who have perfect Faith are a
[57:23] Mystic other words they're a mystery
[57:26] to others they're unusual they're
[57:29] strange because all they go back to is
[57:31] the word it's written it's written it's
[57:33] the word and that's all you need to go
[57:34] back to right amen amen when you obey
[57:37] the word it puts God on the scene and
[57:39] that settles it amen you don't have to
[57:41] question the word if you question the
[57:43] word that's the spirit of
[57:47] unbelief amen all right
[57:53] now this man brother Braham talks about
[57:55] this father was getting brother Bram
[57:57] come in him and his wife was wanting to
[57:59] have prayer for their son dying of black
[58:03] diptheria and I'll just bypass a lot of
[58:06] that but finally he got in and the and
[58:09] the the doctor allowed him to come in
[58:11] you know wouldn't allow him to
[58:12] originally be and but now he allows him
[58:14] to dress him up like a Cooks clu Clan
[58:17] and you know as the prophet made it and
[58:19] so he said uh and they and they just
[58:21] said just a simple prayer and the and
[58:23] the father got up and said said he said
[58:28] just think
[58:29] honey our son is healed and they started
[58:32] rejoicing over his
[58:36] healing now look what they were standing
[58:38] on okay rejoicing over here remember
[58:41] they couldn't have believed like that
[58:44] without having given that quality okay
[58:47] it's got to be a revelation we do not
[58:50] walk by our
[58:51] senses we can say things all we
[58:54] want cuz confession wise but unless you
[58:57] believe it it's not a confession of your
[59:00] mind carnal it's a confession of
[59:07] Faith a confession of
[59:10] faith is what moves God to
[59:13] action and faith is a revelation and you
[59:17] don't move until God says
[59:21] move now that's the communion between a
[59:23] Believer and his and his Lord
[59:27] how do they operate by love which which
[59:30] works what
[59:33] faith faith works by
[59:36] love obedience brings absolutely God on
[59:40] the
[59:41] scene but he's Sovereign when he will
[59:43] manifest it but it's for you to wait
[59:46] because God is
[59:49] faithful he must keep his
[59:52] word so he's going to test you to see if
[59:54] you'll stay with it yeah the devil say
[59:58] well you know it's meant already 5 days
[1:00:00] and you haven't had a
[1:00:02] change or a month or two years or 5
[1:00:05] years or 25 years and you know you know
[1:00:10] you must not have
[1:00:15] faith that's just the way the devil
[1:00:17] talks sure is but the word didn't say
[1:00:20] that your senses are telling you that
[1:00:21] he's using your senses brother Braham
[1:00:24] said reject him he said you don't have
[1:00:26] to accept anything he offers you through
[1:00:29] your
[1:00:32] senses amen all right now he said now he
[1:00:37] said I'm he's this fellow said just
[1:00:39] think he's healed well the little nurse
[1:00:42] I forget the man's old look his
[1:00:44] father-like fellow walked up the nurse
[1:00:46] said sir you don't understand your your
[1:00:48] son is dying oh no he said no he's not
[1:00:51] dying he said the old fellow walked up
[1:00:53] put his hand upon the little nurse's
[1:00:55] shoulder and said sister he she said see
[1:00:57] you're looking at that chart said that's
[1:01:00] all you know is look at that but said
[1:01:02] I'm looking at a Divine
[1:01:05] promise that's the
[1:01:10] difference stop a minute he's given you
[1:01:14] his word heavens and earth will pass
[1:01:17] away but my word shall never pass
[1:01:23] away the steps of a good man are ordered
[1:01:26] of the Lord do you believe that that's
[1:01:29] written
[1:01:30] right when's the last time you told the
[1:01:33] devil that when he question you're going
[1:01:34] and
[1:01:35] coming see but my steps are ordered of
[1:01:39] the Lord you always have the word for
[1:01:41] every answer you can come back to the
[1:01:43] word with the Enemy and the devil can't
[1:01:45] break through that word as long as you
[1:01:47] stay with the
[1:01:52] word all right
[1:01:56] that's your
[1:01:57] head now equality is a distinctive
[1:02:00] attribute or characteristic possessed by
[1:02:03] someone or something equality is a
[1:02:07] distinctive
[1:02:08] attribute are you a distinctive
[1:02:11] attribute of
[1:02:14] God
[1:02:17] okay other words a that quality is a
[1:02:21] standard it's your
[1:02:24] standard I Isaiah 59:19 said when the
[1:02:28] enemy shall come in like a
[1:02:32] flood the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost
[1:02:34] will lift raise up a standard against
[1:02:37] him and then the prophet says quoting
[1:02:39] that scripture he said are you one of
[1:02:45] them are you one of those standard are
[1:02:47] you the word if you're the word where's
[1:02:50] your faith what's your faith
[1:02:53] in the standard is there there yes amen
[1:02:58] amen all right then he then he said are
[1:03:01] you one of them the word bride the word
[1:03:04] bride is one of them that's one of them
[1:03:07] and the word bride is yoked with
[1:03:10] him remember Jesus said take my yoke
[1:03:13] upon
[1:03:14] you become a prisoner as I
[1:03:18] am take my yoke take the word upon you
[1:03:22] take my yoke upon
[1:03:24] you said he
[1:03:27] said you're yolked with him your
[1:03:30] absolute is the word a prisoner to the
[1:03:34] word Deuteronomy 76 let's just read that
[1:03:39] we can go back to Deuteronomy a very um
[1:03:43] probably you already know what what it
[1:03:45] is but let's just read that Deuteronomy
[1:03:48] chapter 7 and verse 6 for thou art a
[1:03:52] holy people we're talking about this
[1:03:55] bride
[1:03:56] being a of a special
[1:03:59] quality now I want to say not only is
[1:04:01] she given that quality to believe but
[1:04:04] she is also a different quality the
[1:04:07] prophet said a Believer is of a
[1:04:09] different quality
[1:04:12] yes all right now he said but she said
[1:04:16] now thou art a holy
[1:04:20] people and what who's she speaking of a
[1:04:23] special
[1:04:24] class thou th art a holy people unto the
[1:04:27] Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath
[1:04:31] chosen thee to be a special
[1:04:37] people unto himself above all people
[1:04:41] above all people that are upon the face
[1:04:43] of the Earth other words she's of a
[1:04:46] different material that's right
[1:04:49] quality now there's one material but but
[1:04:53] he takes out of that out of a certain
[1:04:55] section of that material and makes the
[1:04:58] bride the rest of it is good
[1:05:01] material still the good material but he
[1:05:04] takes out of a section of that material
[1:05:07] just like the book of life is all the
[1:05:10] word but there's an eternal life section
[1:05:13] in that book that's bride only and he
[1:05:16] takes out of that material and makes the
[1:05:19] bride the rest of it amen is foolish
[1:05:24] virgin which is a which is a uh
[1:05:29] Remnant yes of that
[1:05:32] seeden now she is not of the quality of
[1:05:35] the
[1:05:36] Bride number one she's not born again
[1:05:39] number two she never did get
[1:05:42] oil even though she tried to go to get
[1:05:45] it the prophet said she didn't get
[1:05:49] it several places the prophet said she
[1:05:51] did not get it
[1:05:53] yeah all right she she went to get it
[1:05:56] but she didn't get it if she got it
[1:05:58] she'd be in the Rapture that's right
[1:06:01] am I'm not saying she might not had an
[1:06:04] anointing to do what she did because she
[1:06:07] was a she was a certain class of people
[1:06:09] that were good to the people of the
[1:06:11] bride and would be saved and would
[1:06:13] receive eternal life at the Judgment
[1:06:16] white
[1:06:18] throne but the bride was already ready
[1:06:21] to go into the marriage they that were
[1:06:23] ready went in well why she was clothed
[1:06:26] in that Garment of righteousness the
[1:06:28] bride was why too because they took
[1:06:31] their lamps the foolish virgin but no no
[1:06:33] oil but the bride had oil in their
[1:06:36] vessel that's
[1:06:38] rightel that's the
[1:06:41] difference
[1:06:42] amen so she was a special class of
[1:06:45] people with a special
[1:06:47] quality and was and was material bride
[1:06:51] material that's taken out of that
[1:06:54] material a special
[1:06:56] class and put in the book into a
[1:06:59] section one book just a different
[1:07:02] section
[1:07:05] yes Hallelujah that's right it was
[1:07:09] called the eternal life section which is
[1:07:11] the Lamb's
[1:07:13] wife the lamb and the Lamb's wife the
[1:07:16] only things that H that are Eternal and
[1:07:19] always
[1:07:20] were well that was a good
[1:07:23] one amen that's right because he's
[1:07:27] Eternal and had in himself his own
[1:07:30] substance called The Bride that's
[1:07:34] right all right I'm getting off my line
[1:07:36] here let's go back all right now so
[1:07:39] she's chosen in him holy and without
[1:07:42] remember the Bible said Ephesians 1 we
[1:07:45] chose him he chose us in himself to be
[1:07:48] what holy did not Deuteronomy 7:6 said
[1:07:52] thou art a holy people all right
[1:07:56] Ephesians 1 said he chose us Ephesians
[1:08:00] 13 or 4 he chose us in himself before
[1:08:03] the foundation of the world to be holy
[1:08:05] and Without Blame before him in
[1:08:09] love who's love he
[1:08:12] is why would he choose us in love
[1:08:15] because he chose us in
[1:08:19] himself and so therefore we are his love
[1:08:23] today projected amen that's why we are
[1:08:27] also his love but we are also his
[1:08:29] victory because the word is our Victory
[1:08:33] amen and he is the
[1:08:36] victory therefore we are the
[1:08:39] victory what is the victory that
[1:08:41] overcometh the world our
[1:08:44] faith what's Faith do Faith takes its
[1:08:47] resting place in the unmovable Eternal
[1:08:51] Word of God that's what faith does amen
[1:08:54] amen
[1:08:57] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:08:59] the spirit saith unto the churches see
[1:09:01] he that hath it's a god-given
[1:09:04] quality to be able to
[1:09:07] hear and to hear is to
[1:09:10] receive the word for the season by
[1:09:15] Revelation that's the
[1:09:19] faith that's why the prophet said a real
[1:09:22] believer is the faith of God that moves
[1:09:24] in him in
[1:09:27] you amen all right so now coming back to
[1:09:32] this he said I mentioned this is out the
[1:09:35] church age book I mentioned that it
[1:09:37] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[1:09:38] Revelation or we will fail to get
[1:09:41] it bringing these two thoughts together
[1:09:44] you'll see that it won't take ordinary
[1:09:46] study and thinking to make the book real
[1:09:49] that's carnal that's that's that's
[1:09:52] intellectual thinking God never did tell
[1:09:56] you to go out and learn it that way he
[1:09:57] said it would be revealed it's given to
[1:09:59] you as a quality he said I've chosen you
[1:10:02] in myself and you're going to know me
[1:10:05] because I knew you you'll know
[1:10:09] me it's exactly right all right now he
[1:10:13] said that means this book he said is he
[1:10:16] said it's going to take the operation of
[1:10:18] the Holy Ghost to make the book real
[1:10:21] what book the
[1:10:23] book of redemption
[1:10:28] all right all right see now he
[1:10:31] said this book that means this book
[1:10:35] can't be revealed to
[1:10:37] anyone or other words it can't be
[1:10:39] revealed to
[1:10:41] everyone everyone if they bride but not
[1:10:44] everyone public outside of bride all
[1:10:49] right it can't be revealed to just
[1:10:51] anyone but it's revealed to a special
[1:10:54] class of people
[1:10:56] yeah now I didn't say that he said it no
[1:11:00] you say brother brandham said it but
[1:11:01] brother brandham had the sword in his
[1:11:03] hand and when he had the sword in his
[1:11:04] hand God had it in his
[1:11:08] hand is that right then the word cames
[1:11:12] to it and we don't have to question
[1:11:14] whether this Prophet is a Vindicated
[1:11:16] prophet he was Vindicated by the word
[1:11:18] Vindicated by by the by The Works that
[1:11:21] he did Vindicated him it proved it was
[1:11:24] Messiah
[1:11:26] it proved it was God standing in flesh
[1:11:28] before us it proved that it was him God
[1:11:31] himself Among Us the son of man
[1:11:34] revealed and if he's revealed who's he
[1:11:36] revealed to and if he's revealed to you
[1:11:39] you are the manifestation of the son of
[1:11:44] man because today the promise is he
[1:11:46] would be revealed through the bride in
[1:11:49] the bride and through the bride he would
[1:11:52] work in and through her so the son of
[1:11:54] man is revealed field in Bride
[1:11:59] form amen because in you is not a
[1:12:02] different person it's him we see him in
[1:12:07] Revelation chapter 1 in the midst of the
[1:12:09] church as it looked at as he was the son
[1:12:13] of man but how was he dressed he was
[1:12:15] dressed in women's
[1:12:18] garment I'll leave that go drop it right
[1:12:21] there all right
[1:12:23] now it will require it'll take it'll
[1:12:27] take one a special class of people with
[1:12:29] prophetic Insight it will require the
[1:12:31] ability to hear from God it will require
[1:12:35] the quality ability to hear from
[1:12:39] God it will require Supernatural
[1:12:42] instruction that's why the evidence is
[1:12:45] that instruction in you showing the
[1:12:47] teacher the inside teacher has come in
[1:12:49] you and leading you into all truth you
[1:12:52] don't have to question it believe it
[1:12:54] amen
[1:12:56] glory to
[1:13:00] God this bride this woman the bride is
[1:13:03] under submission to her
[1:13:05] head just as a wife is submitted to her
[1:13:09] husband she doesn't go out and run out
[1:13:12] of that and do and that's why the vote
[1:13:14] of the woman was wrong because at the
[1:13:16] same time she began to Bob her hair just
[1:13:18] to cut the
[1:13:20] ends is cutting your hair you're denying
[1:13:24] your head ship of the word or your
[1:13:27] husband if you're a married woman you're
[1:13:30] under headship God put her under
[1:13:33] headship amen is that right in the
[1:13:37] beginning because she went out on her
[1:13:39] own reasoning and tried to make
[1:13:41] something work and tried to do and and
[1:13:43] tried to bring
[1:13:45] about by knowledge the Fulfillment of
[1:13:48] the word and it wasn't she did it in the
[1:13:51] wrong
[1:13:53] way she should have waited on the word
[1:13:55] and the word would have come forth and
[1:13:57] spoke and inspired and it would have
[1:14:00] taken place by the word that's
[1:14:04] right all right a lot could be said
[1:14:07] right there all right
[1:14:09] now it will requir Supernatural instru
[1:14:12] not just a student comparing verse with
[1:14:14] verse though that is good but a mystery
[1:14:16] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:14:19] it never becomes
[1:14:21] clear getting back how you're a Mystic
[1:14:23] to others a mystery to others didn't the
[1:14:25] didn't Paul say we we speak this mystery
[1:14:29] we speak a hidden
[1:14:31] Mystery but we speak to them that are
[1:14:35] perfect that can re other words them
[1:14:37] that can receive it and there's only one
[1:14:40] perfect that's Christ but if Christ be
[1:14:43] in you you're perfect you you the real
[1:14:47] you the you birth word
[1:14:51] you is perfect
[1:14:57] all right because why it's
[1:15:00] him okay
[1:15:04] now it'll require a teaching of the
[1:15:06] spirit never comes clear we need to hear
[1:15:08] from God and lay oursel look at lay
[1:15:09] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[1:15:13] spirit to hear and know what's know
[1:15:18] Faith all right now notice long hair
[1:15:23] Nazarite vowed to the word
[1:15:25] I'll picture the bride of Christ now
[1:15:27] we'll PCT we picture the Antichrist
[1:15:29] where she is and it's two women today
[1:15:32] one's Antichrist the other's the word
[1:15:34] coming right to their
[1:15:37] head amen it's right there two of them
[1:15:40] all
[1:15:41] right he said now notice he said we
[1:15:46] picture that now where she is the
[1:15:49] Antichrist is religious and everything
[1:15:51] Science Now The Humble little bride of
[1:15:53] Christ just simply believes the
[1:15:56] word whoever she is it's
[1:16:01] individuals simply believes the word
[1:16:04] it's not groups right it's
[1:16:07] individuals amen
[1:16:17] yes the word can only
[1:16:21] recognize the word
[1:16:26] amen I hope you capture that it it can't
[1:16:30] recognize a denomination or a perversion
[1:16:34] why would it be a perversion they take
[1:16:36] something add something to it take
[1:16:38] something away from it operated under a
[1:16:41] different contrary to the word than what
[1:16:43] God Said
[1:16:45] Yes and it looks so reasonable so
[1:16:49] right but it's wrong it's anti-
[1:16:53] word all right
[1:16:55] right I
[1:16:58] all and I hope that I brought said every
[1:17:01] one of you said the word can only yeah
[1:17:04] it knows better it know the word knows
[1:17:07] better than that perversion it catches
[1:17:10] the per it's the word it can't
[1:17:12] recognize you can't recognize nothing
[1:17:17] but the
[1:17:19] word a wheat can't be nothing but a
[1:17:22] wheat it started a wheat it'll head up a
[1:17:24] wheat a weed can't be a wheat yet it's
[1:17:28] watered by the same
[1:17:32] anointing you see false anointed ones
[1:17:35] doesn't mean the anointing was false it
[1:17:38] means that one that's anointed is
[1:17:41] false do you
[1:17:43] understand all right the
[1:17:46] anointing is the Holy Ghost that's why
[1:17:48] you've got to be careful you don't speak
[1:17:50] against the anointing
[1:17:55] that's right because it'll anoint both
[1:17:57] of
[1:17:58] them make one shout make one cast just
[1:18:02] because see they'll cast out Devils
[1:18:04] Judas did just as well as the real seed
[1:18:06] did they C so casting out Devils is the
[1:18:09] evidence that you have the Holy Ghost
[1:18:10] dwelling in you although it's the Holy
[1:18:12] Ghost That cast out Devils right that's
[1:18:14] right and it's done by
[1:18:19] faith but was Judas a seed of God no he
[1:18:24] was a seed of
[1:18:27] Satan doing miracles signs wonders
[1:18:31] speaking tongues prophesy and be the
[1:18:33] truth what about balum what about cfas
[1:18:36] they were anointed by a genuine Holy
[1:18:39] Ghost anointing and that Holy Ghost can
[1:18:41] anoint your spirit not only the flesh
[1:18:45] the spirit the second
[1:18:48] realm but the soul realm the Third Realm
[1:18:53] isn't the word
[1:19:00] right amen that ought to be preached on
[1:19:03] brother Braham said it should be
[1:19:04] preached on and talked about in this
[1:19:07] age because that's one of the Mysteries
[1:19:10] when Jesus said there shall be false
[1:19:12] christs and false prophets false
[1:19:17] teachers well then brother brandham
[1:19:19] would you say the anointing would be a
[1:19:21] false no he said the anointing can be
[1:19:23] the Holy Ghost anointed anointing the
[1:19:26] genuine Holy Ghost now you've heard that
[1:19:29] spoken over and over again you go back
[1:19:31] in the scriptures and see if that's not
[1:19:33] true but what are we talking about today
[1:19:36] I'm not talking about the false ones
[1:19:38] that are anointed I'm talking about the
[1:19:40] true seed that's
[1:19:41] anointed it's Jesus Christ for the day
[1:19:45] revealed in Bride form other words the
[1:19:49] prophet said he's manifesting himself in
[1:19:52] the formation of the Bride
[1:19:55] things that are to be he said he's
[1:19:57] revealing himself in the formation of
[1:19:59] the bride and he said the revelation of
[1:20:02] Jesus Christ not for his day but for
[1:20:05] this day it's not another person being
[1:20:08] revealed but he said the revelation of
[1:20:10] Jesus Christ for this day is growing in
[1:20:13] a
[1:20:14] bride to the full stature but we had to
[1:20:19] have the full word to come into full
[1:20:21] stature that's why the seals opened
[1:20:25] amen because it was the full revelation
[1:20:28] of Jesus
[1:20:31] Christ and that's the secret of his
[1:20:35] coming because he's coming in a form
[1:20:38] they didn't expect him to come
[1:20:40] in he's coming for a body change he's
[1:20:44] picking up his
[1:20:46] people I could go a lot of I'll just
[1:20:48] save that because I'll probably hit that
[1:20:50] later on in the next meeting or two we
[1:20:51] have all right now
[1:20:56] now I'm I'm losing time here but I'm
[1:20:58] just going to try to watch my time very
[1:21:02] closely now her long hair a Nazarite vow
[1:21:06] showed that she is vowed to God and if
[1:21:09] you have hair long it shows your under
[1:21:14] headship amen and your husband's your
[1:21:19] head well he's not a Believer it doesn't
[1:21:22] matter he's still your head as long as
[1:21:24] he doesn't cause you or make you to do
[1:21:26] something contrary to the
[1:21:29] word you're still to honor him and serve
[1:21:32] him you're under headship you're vowed
[1:21:35] to
[1:21:36] him We're vowed to Christ is that right
[1:21:41] all right then he said and she is vowed
[1:21:44] to God her beautiful gown what is that
[1:21:47] referring to Revelations 198 to her was
[1:21:49] granted she should be raid and fine
[1:21:51] lenen clean and white with which are the
[1:21:55] right why righteousness of the Saints
[1:21:58] and what's that righteousness the Saints
[1:22:00] denoting that she's accepted she's
[1:22:02] received and that she's pure and God
[1:22:05] sees her as faultless and no
[1:22:08] sin she's
[1:22:11] recognized she has a purity and she was
[1:22:14] ready to go into the marriage and the
[1:22:17] marriage is
[1:22:20] come amen and there's a union taking
[1:22:23] place and and it's not a public show
[1:22:26] it's a mystery because it's the mystery
[1:22:29] of his
[1:22:31] coming now I'm I'm going to stop there
[1:22:33] because I'm not going to go any further
[1:22:35] on that all right let's get back I keep
[1:22:37] moving well no the Lord's moving this so
[1:22:40] he is the word and that's your absolute
[1:22:43] be true to Christ the word he'll V if
[1:22:46] you'll be true to Christ the word he'll
[1:22:48] vindicate it to be
[1:22:50] true no sir he said not even an of
[1:22:55] anything towards making love to the
[1:22:56] other man not join his ranks or anything
[1:22:59] to Satan or let him get you in his arms
[1:23:02] or in his care or talk you over to his
[1:23:10] way oh my I let's just go on here I was
[1:23:15] going to read something out of the
[1:23:15] church age book that can
[1:23:21] well let me just read a portion of it
[1:23:25] if I
[1:23:26] can because in paragraph or page one uh
[1:23:30] 355 paragraph 127 of the book of the new
[1:23:34] church age book we
[1:23:36] have it's quoting the scripture I will
[1:23:38] keep thee in the hour of from the hour
[1:23:40] of Temptation which shall come upon all
[1:23:43] the world to try them that dwell upon
[1:23:44] the Earth this verse is not a
[1:23:47] declaration that the true church will go
[1:23:50] through the tribulation it meant that it
[1:23:51] would have said that but it said I will
[1:23:54] keep the from the hour of
[1:23:57] Temptation this temptation is exactly
[1:24:00] like the Temptation in
[1:24:02] Eden now we're facing that today all
[1:24:05] right he said it will be a very inviting
[1:24:09] proposition held up in direct opposition
[1:24:11] to God's commanded word and it's
[1:24:14] happening brother and sister and it's
[1:24:16] going to get
[1:24:18] worse so why is God trying to speak of
[1:24:21] something here today tonight to you like
[1:24:23] this
[1:24:24] because it's a
[1:24:25] warning you have been given his word
[1:24:29] that's all you
[1:24:34] need don't let the devil reason you into
[1:24:37] other things and proceed on your
[1:24:40] own amen listen to it now all right I
[1:24:45] will keep thee from the hour of
[1:24:47] Temptation okay I other words I'll keep
[1:24:50] thee out of tribulation out of Great
[1:24:52] Tribulation not out of of tribulation
[1:24:55] but out of Great
[1:24:56] Tribulation all right now so this this
[1:25:01] inviting proposition held up in direct
[1:25:03] opposition to the command of God's word
[1:25:05] and yet from the standpoint listen to
[1:25:07] this of human reasoning it will be very
[1:25:10] so very right so enlightening and
[1:25:13] lifegiving as to fool
[1:25:16] Eve the
[1:25:18] world the woman but not the
[1:25:22] bride but watch it's going to seem very
[1:25:25] reasonable so enlightening just like it
[1:25:28] was to
[1:25:30] Eve so reasonable so enlightening this
[1:25:34] man makes sense he's speaking knowledge
[1:25:38] and they were commanded not to partake
[1:25:39] of that tree of Good and Evil is that
[1:25:42] right but here Satan's telling her why
[1:25:44] if you partake of this tree you'll know
[1:25:46] good from
[1:25:48] evil see right back very
[1:25:52] thing contrary to the
[1:25:56] word if Eve would have said no no Satan
[1:26:00] no I'm going to stay with the
[1:26:04] word it's written I'm not talking to you
[1:26:08] brother Bram said she
[1:26:10] stopped and listened what he had to
[1:26:14] say is that right don't
[1:26:18] stop brother R said keep going you have
[1:26:22] nothing to question nothing to add to
[1:26:24] the word or take from it it is written
[1:26:26] that's your standard yes
[1:26:31] amen all right
[1:26:35] now it but it'll be light enlightening
[1:26:38] lifegiving as to fool that's why I said
[1:26:41] eve it's fooling EES
[1:26:44] today but it can't fool the
[1:26:47] bride because she's a part of the word
[1:26:50] if she should start to go off God will
[1:26:53] bring her back yeah it's always the word
[1:26:57] it's always the word but don't you go
[1:26:59] out knowing right and not do
[1:27:03] it because him that knoweth to do good
[1:27:06] and doeth it not to him is
[1:27:08] sin just take the word all you need
[1:27:12] everything is already provided for you
[1:27:14] to make a Rapture in this
[1:27:20] word all right now I'm not I don't know
[1:27:23] if I'll read any further only the elect
[1:27:26] brother Bram said well it sound like the
[1:27:28] bride but he says only the very elect
[1:27:30] will not be
[1:27:32] fooled why won't they be fooled brother
[1:27:35] brandom said why would those two Spirits
[1:27:37] be so close it would deceive the elect
[1:27:39] if possible if he said why can't they be
[1:27:42] deceived because they are the word and
[1:27:46] he just said the word comes to the word
[1:27:48] the word will receive the word they
[1:27:51] can't disbelieve no one can make them
[1:27:54] disbelief the
[1:27:57] word then you become aware by the word
[1:28:02] Satan is opposite he will do anything he
[1:28:05] can but you check it with the word don't
[1:28:09] you receive it and well you say how do I
[1:28:12] know if it's wor word or not if you got
[1:28:14] the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:28:19] discerner amen he'll show you
[1:28:25] that's right where's your confidence in
[1:28:27] your own ability to know right from
[1:28:29] wrong or God's ability working in
[1:28:33] you all right
[1:28:36] now the Temptation will be as follows
[1:28:39] this Ecom munical move that has started
[1:28:41] on what seems to be a blissful and
[1:28:43] blessed principle fulfilling God's
[1:28:45] prayer that we all might be one becom so
[1:28:48] strong
[1:28:49] politically today it's become strong and
[1:28:52] is becoming stronger politically
[1:28:55] what is this dominating
[1:28:59] female she's left the word and gone to
[1:29:03] politics she rejected the word God's way
[1:29:06] of doing things and works through
[1:29:08] politics that's why you stay out of it
[1:29:12] don't you get your mind all consumed
[1:29:14] with
[1:29:15] politics stay at the word Satan will use
[1:29:18] that if he can to get you away from that
[1:29:21] word and you be put your mind on that
[1:29:24] you begin to work through the same
[1:29:26] realm trying to CH they're trying to
[1:29:29] change the world oh we'll get the world
[1:29:30] back the very thing they're day we'll we
[1:29:32] will we will make America great again no
[1:29:36] they won't they left the word there's no
[1:29:40] way for it to be great
[1:29:42] again get your mind get your attitude
[1:29:45] get your mental attitude get your
[1:29:48] thought on the word and remain there and
[1:29:51] ask God to open that word to youen
[1:29:54] I say that pretty hard don't I that
[1:29:57] sounds like I'm pretty mad doesn't it
[1:29:59] but I'm not and I love you and I love
[1:30:00] this word and I'm not afraid to be what
[1:30:03] God made me to
[1:30:08] be amen and I'm not going to preach like
[1:30:12] this one or that one or somebody else
[1:30:14] I'll preach it just the way he wants to
[1:30:15] preach it but check it by the
[1:30:22] word all right and don't judge it by the
[1:30:25] outer
[1:30:26] man because if you judge the outer man
[1:30:29] John missed
[1:30:31] it John the John the Baptist missed it
[1:30:35] if he judge it by the outer man Jesus
[1:30:37] himself missed it it wasn't like the
[1:30:39] kind old priest he raided ropes and beat
[1:30:43] him out of the temple now if you judge
[1:30:44] him by that you would say he's not
[1:30:46] bearing
[1:30:48] fruit what's the fruit that bear the
[1:30:50] word for the season
[1:30:55] it's got to be the
[1:30:57] word we don't judge a man by the outward
[1:31:01] what is his inward saying what is he
[1:31:03] living what's his
[1:31:07] life what's he pointing you
[1:31:11] to Jesus when he did that pointed them
[1:31:14] to the word he was making correction by
[1:31:17] the
[1:31:18] word it's always the
[1:31:22] word and Jesus is in you what will he do
[1:31:26] he will keep his
[1:31:28] word Glory all
[1:31:34] right so she Bears political power she
[1:31:37] Bears pressure upon the government to
[1:31:40] cause all to join with her either
[1:31:42] directly or indirectly through adherence
[1:31:44] to principles enacted into law so that
[1:31:47] no people be recognized actual Church
[1:31:50] actual churches unless under direct or
[1:31:52] indirect Den domination of this Council
[1:31:55] that's coming to pass that will
[1:31:58] absolutely
[1:32:01] happen little groups will lose Charters
[1:32:04] and privileges they lose property and
[1:32:06] spiritual rights with the people as this
[1:32:09] pressure
[1:32:10] increases and it
[1:32:12] will it'll be harder to resist for to
[1:32:15] resist is to lose
[1:32:18] privilege where are you standing then
[1:32:22] when Satan comes along and says you know
[1:32:24] just just agree with them they'll let
[1:32:25] you preach about brother brandom and all
[1:32:27] about him and everything just agree with
[1:32:32] this if you agree with it you're going
[1:32:35] against the
[1:32:39] word okay you see why it it's a must
[1:32:43] that you must come to that Holy Spirit
[1:32:46] in
[1:32:48] you okay I've got to
[1:32:50] close now you listened only one
[1:32:55] voice
[1:32:57] amen see
[1:33:00] see so many will be tempted to go along
[1:33:03] for they'll feel that it's better to
[1:33:04] serve God publicly in the framework of
[1:33:06] this organization and it's going to be
[1:33:08] very looks very right and real to do
[1:33:10] that all right
[1:33:12] reasonable then not to serve God at all
[1:33:15] publicly but they he to believe the
[1:33:17] devil's Li is to serve
[1:33:20] Satan I could go on and read more if you
[1:33:22] want to read it page 35
[1:33:25] 6 all right you listen to only one voice
[1:33:29] my sheep know my voice a stranger what's
[1:33:33] his voice the word it's the Bible just
[1:33:35] stay with that voice a stranger they
[1:33:38] won't follow see the two opposing
[1:33:41] Spirits at work in this evil age can't
[1:33:43] you see it each very religious Cain and
[1:33:46] Abel Spirits again among coming to their
[1:33:48] heads as they started one worshiping by
[1:33:51] Beauty and by knowledge by education and
[1:33:53] science and ethics and the other one by
[1:33:56] faith the revelation of the word of God
[1:33:59] there's the
[1:34:01] difference amen both of them standing
[1:34:04] right here in this building this morning
[1:34:06] he
[1:34:08] said when when that little woman that
[1:34:11] was about ready to die and only had one
[1:34:12] cake to make and one little bit of oil
[1:34:15] and the Elijah the word came to her and
[1:34:18] said bake me a cake
[1:34:22] first what the Bible say say Seek Ye the
[1:34:24] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:34:26] all these other things that go with that
[1:34:28] righteousness will be added unto
[1:34:31] you go with it see all right but put God
[1:34:34] first put his word first put his Spirit
[1:34:36] first put him first instead of that we
[1:34:39] put him last we put him under our
[1:34:42] feelings we put him under our emotions
[1:34:44] we put him under reasoning we put him
[1:34:46] under
[1:34:47] imagination and
[1:34:49] memory and Satan is the master with
[1:34:52] using any of that
[1:34:56] that's your mental that's your
[1:34:58] mind that's where the battles
[1:35:01] fought all right but will you have an
[1:35:03] Adam Bomb laying in the soul if you're
[1:35:05] born again just raise it up and apply
[1:35:08] the word it's written and Satan has to
[1:35:12] flee resist the devil and he will flee
[1:35:15] from you to resist him is to turn him
[1:35:18] down just what Jesus did turn him
[1:35:22] down don't reason with him you never saw
[1:35:25] Jesus in any one of those Temptations
[1:35:28] reasoning with the devil he did not
[1:35:30] reason with him he didn't discuss
[1:35:33] it he came back and said it's
[1:35:36] written that's the
[1:35:39] believer that's the
[1:35:41] bride that's his character yesterday
[1:35:45] that is his character
[1:35:50] today
[1:35:52] amen make me a little cake first Elijah
[1:35:55] told her what's what's she going now
[1:35:58] Elijah's testing her the word's testing
[1:36:00] her what's she going to
[1:36:02] do if she's obedient to the see to see
[1:36:07] if she's obedient to the word she turns
[1:36:09] and starts not knowing why she's doing
[1:36:12] it she couldn't explain it she just knew
[1:36:14] to
[1:36:17] obey okay don't let the devil come to
[1:36:19] you and say why don't you do this why
[1:36:21] don't you do that why is this happening
[1:36:23] why is that happening I thought you were
[1:36:25] a Believer don't you discuss it with him
[1:36:28] it's written greater is he that is in me
[1:36:31] than he that is of the world when your
[1:36:33] flesh wants to talk to you come back to
[1:36:35] it and speak to
[1:36:37] it it's written Satan want to use that
[1:36:41] it raises
[1:36:44] up all right but you must die daily take
[1:36:49] up your cross and follow the word follow
[1:36:53] the word word keep your focus on the
[1:36:56] word he's present he's not a he's not a
[1:36:59] history he is but he's not a historical
[1:37:01] God he's present tense right here in you
[1:37:04] amidst the storm amidst the trial he
[1:37:07] knew every bit of it and led you that
[1:37:08] way and if you'll obey him he'll get you
[1:37:10] out of it if he told the people that in
[1:37:13] the ship they're going to the other side
[1:37:15] they're going to the other
[1:37:17] side he was in the ship to fulfill it
[1:37:20] but as soon as they started popcorn
[1:37:22] testimony telling how great things he
[1:37:24] did great things he did great things he
[1:37:26] did and all of a sudden the storm comes
[1:37:28] upon him and then they turn and realize
[1:37:30] he's in the ship and say is it your will
[1:37:33] that we
[1:37:35] perish what care no he said care ye not
[1:37:39] that we perish can you can you imagine
[1:37:42] that here they're just exalting him the
[1:37:44] great things he did he's the word and
[1:37:46] then so don't you care that we perish he
[1:37:49] was in the
[1:37:51] ship just to be called
[1:37:54] just the word and the word has never
[1:37:57] failed in the mouths of believing
[1:37:59] Christians now I'm I'm coming to a
[1:38:01] close all right
[1:38:05] now so bring me a cake and when she
[1:38:07] obeyed the
[1:38:08] word then men and women who are led by
[1:38:12] the spirit of God sometimes do things
[1:38:14] they don't know why they're doing don't
[1:38:16] know they're doing what they're doing
[1:38:18] turned and started into the house and
[1:38:20] she heard the voice behind him voice
[1:38:22] again
[1:38:24] and the cruise of Wilds will not and the
[1:38:27] meal will not pass
[1:38:30] see when she
[1:38:33] obeyed Amen brother Brandon was in a
[1:38:37] storm coming out of that storm KN he had
[1:38:39] to get out of that storm in Colorado if
[1:38:41] he didn't get down there quite he'll
[1:38:43] never get out of there he knew that he
[1:38:46] was on his way
[1:38:49] down quite away number of yards down and
[1:38:52] the Holy Spirit spoke to him he said
[1:38:54] turn around and go back where you came
[1:38:57] from he knew in his reasoning that if he
[1:39:01] went back humanly he wouldn't get out
[1:39:03] again but did he consider it no he
[1:39:10] obeyed did you hear me yes he obeyed
[1:39:14] what the spirit said do taking no
[1:39:16] question he said I knew better than to
[1:39:19] not obey that voice I obeyed that voice
[1:39:22] I went back up there when he when God
[1:39:24] saw that he obeyed what happened God met
[1:39:31] him what's God looking for
[1:39:34] obedience obedience is better than
[1:39:37] sacrifice obey the word Jesus was taught
[1:39:42] Jesus learned obedience what did he
[1:39:44] learn obedience hear me he learned
[1:39:47] obedience by the things he
[1:39:50] suffered and being made perfect is that
[1:39:54] right he became our perpetuation he
[1:39:56] became our
[1:39:58] sacrifice the perfect lamb amen by what
[1:40:03] by testing trials suffering he learned
[1:40:08] obedience how you going to learn
[1:40:11] it all
[1:40:14] right the bride will only do his will
[1:40:17] nobody can make them do otherwise
[1:40:19] Revelation which is Faith makes no
[1:40:21] claims of knowledge the real true
[1:40:23] Christian it belongs to Christ it's his
[1:40:26] wife the real Christian belongs to him
[1:40:28] not a church wife but she's an obedience
[1:40:31] this little faith woman that lives by
[1:40:33] faith in obedience to
[1:40:36] him that's your
[1:40:40] bride
[1:40:41] amen and so this little bride is walking
[1:40:44] by what faith to Faith to Faith to Faith
[1:40:48] the just shall live by faith is that
[1:40:52] right all right then the Bible said and
[1:40:55] from glory to glory he's changing
[1:41:02] me all right
[1:41:05] now she has the mind of Christ to know
[1:41:08] what he wants done with the word she
[1:41:09] performs the command of the word in his
[1:41:11] name for she has thus saith the Lord
[1:41:14] then the word is quickened by the spir
[1:41:16] then then the word is quickened by the
[1:41:18] spirit and it comes to pass like a seed
[1:41:21] that is planted and watered it comes to
[1:41:23] Harvest serving its purpose those in the
[1:41:26] bride do only his
[1:41:28] will no one can make them do otherwise
[1:41:31] they have thus sayith the Lord or they
[1:41:32] keep still they know they know but see
[1:41:35] what's the secret of this here's the
[1:41:37] secret the word is in the
[1:41:41] bride the word is in the bride that's
[1:41:44] the
[1:41:45] secret what's the secret of it what's
[1:41:48] the
[1:41:49] silence the word is in the bride
[1:41:54] where is he coming the word is in the
[1:41:58] bride there's a union taking place she
[1:42:01] was ready she went
[1:42:03] in amen that's
[1:42:06] it and the door was shut when at the
[1:42:09] last Trump the last one come in and the
[1:42:12] other standing outside let us in let us
[1:42:14] in and Jesus turned around and said I
[1:42:16] don't know
[1:42:19] you with me all right
[1:42:23] all right
[1:42:28] now so now we know God they know that
[1:42:31] God is in them fulfilling his own word
[1:42:34] so now he works in and through the bride
[1:42:36] I'm rushing through this just stay with
[1:42:38] me just a minute Christ the word is
[1:42:40] heading up also the Christ word bride
[1:42:43] excuse me is heading up also in her head
[1:42:46] the other is in an Ecclesia heading
[1:42:48] heading to an ecclesiastical head but
[1:42:51] the bride is coming to a head because
[1:42:53] she's going to be United back to the
[1:42:55] mate it's got to unite everything church
[1:42:58] and everything else has got to unite
[1:42:59] brother Bram said we are in the uniting
[1:43:02] time amen the wheat everything comes
[1:43:05] back to its head where it started from
[1:43:07] Canan Abel word bride heading up in the
[1:43:10] person look the word bride is heading up
[1:43:12] in the person of the word of God made
[1:43:16] manifest in this evil age that we're now
[1:43:18] living
[1:43:28] and I said the believer day is is of a
[1:43:30] different quality all right I'm I'm this
[1:43:34] is I'm
[1:43:36] closing oh could you compare a Christian
[1:43:39] today with them Christians of long ago
[1:43:41] how then disciples walked in the power
[1:43:43] of the spirit moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:43:46] just a prisoner as I preached on the
[1:43:48] other night a prisoner to the word and
[1:43:51] will of God he couldn't even even move
[1:43:53] until God moved him now there it is
[1:43:56] right there you're led by the spirit
[1:44:00] Faith
[1:44:01] leads all right the word's
[1:44:04] leading she can do nothing outside of
[1:44:07] the
[1:44:09] head
[1:44:11] leading think of that amen
[1:44:15] now because she's under headship she's
[1:44:18] not going to go out of
[1:44:20] headship would he said a prisoner to the
[1:44:22] word and will of God he couldn't even
[1:44:24] move till God moved me wouldn't you like
[1:44:26] to see a church rise like that it's
[1:44:28] going to it's got to come that's right
[1:44:31] it's on its road
[1:44:33] now and where are we now 60 years later
[1:44:36] where are we in the maturing of it amen
[1:44:40] I believe we're right at the
[1:44:42] maturity just think of that now yeah all
[1:44:47] right oh he said he said see Jesus knew
