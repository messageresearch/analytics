sun season and all the days Hallelujah can we say this morning it is good to be Sons and Daughters of God Hallelujah so good to see each and every one of you today amen and uh to greet our guests amen God bless you and uh you know it's just uh it's just wonderful the many things that God is doing in the bride today and we're seeing the word unfolded you know my brother and sister just uh maybe a poor analogy but if you just take what is the front page of the newspaper that is not the news that's right that is sensationalism what they're trying to draw you to that's why the prophet of God told us that we have to come and look between the lines and look in the letter and not just take what it is the the superficially upfront but to dig into the word of God and the good news there's the Gospel of Jesus Christ everybody wants to just use John 16 and make it a poster child but my brother and sister they're so much more amen but we've got to dig into it and we've got to find the content of the word for our hour and I just want to say God bless you to each and every one this day amen for those that are not with us which reminds me our sister April I know Sister Jerry and I are probably not in the loop and there will be those of you who do know but I believe maybe she's already went off to a wedding in far off lands not yet not yet okay see how much I'm out of the news amen but anyway remember Sister April uh you know I I thought I had a busy life but um anyway we just want to remember amen I want to greet our sister Rachel our brother Joan amen uh just uh such a joy part good it was a lot of years ago I don't know if they even remember but when I first met them they were just young children amen and uh it might even have been jobed that was underneath the chairs in the church wasn't born yet okay but I I just remember that some of the family you know uh they're in Sandpoint were pushing their little trucks and you know how little kids are they're there in church with their little truck underneath the chairs but you know God still comes God still moves right because he knows the heart of a child amen but to always feel such a kindred spirit with them and just pray that you take greetings back to the family amen and um just uh let's see uh brother Stan sister Merlene I've had a wonderful time in the Philippines brother Stan sent a personal note to us to thank us for the prayers that uh it's it's kind of a deep story in a way but God just give him a confidence that you know as he got older here he just kind of felt like maybe he wasn't effective anymore but I'm telling you my brother and sister until the day God takes us home every one of us is effective amen we're making a difference in the lives around us and amen just like brother Bob and sister Joanne if nothing else are not here in church not here with the amens not here with the interactions and the God bless you's and I love you but I just look at their life and we were discussing that just a moment young adults my brother and sister they've been serving God longer than most of us have been alive and never faltered never failed have had trials oh my have they had trials they've had struggles amen you know Sister Joanne once collapsing on the bed we believe that she actually was dead and brother Bob just under the anointing of the word says if I lay hands on her and call out in the name of Jesus Christ he promised he would come on the scene amen God give us confidence God give us strength to stand on that and say I believe your word Lord you said it it will come to pass and so we're thankful for all of these things amen God bless you brother Alex I enjoyed the song service he could have just read a scripture and kind of covered my thought amen and musicians I I thank the Lord were blessed amen so as we look at this I would just like to speak to you today on measure of time and as we'll look at this my brother and sister we we know that the word of God tells us we've been allotted a certain amount of time on the earth we've been allotted um uh certain days and while the word promises us basically 70 years some will receive more some less but we realize it's not about how we view it and I have as a little subtitle not really a title but just as something to provoke your thought our view God's view you know I mean our view of time is my you know time is in Swift transition I need to be afraid no you need to be happy look up and rejoice your Redemption is that much closer to you amen will the government's collapse well I don't know the prophet had a vision my brother and sister he said it was America and it was craters and Smoke and Ashes that should terrify us except for the word showed us we're not here amen we're not part of that Hallelujah amen so we got to take the measure of time and you might say a point of view what is our point of view versus God's point of view hallelujah amen let's just turn in our Bibles today amen the Book of Psalms the 39th chapter Verses 4 through 7. and pray for technology my brother and sister it's interesting how it will come down to a Time the buy-in cell might not be what we think it is have you ever thought about that we think they're going to stand in the marketplace and they're going to say you're not allowed to but God's thoughts are so much greater than our own the world is obsessed now with what do they call them emds isn't that what it is EMTs emds yeah the electromagnetic yeah poof everything Electronics done my brother and sister the world is fixing to collapse man has created his own demise they want to blame God now look this is a little distraction forgive me but in the 60s I had a great earthquake I believe 1964 in Chile the churches were filled with people crying out for God's mercy then they had one in the 70s and the churches were somewhat filled they had one in the 80s and very few people changed they had one in 2010 and the people stood in the streets and cursed God we're seeing a decline it's going to happen but something else is going to happen amen there's a bride hearing a word she's hearing a trumpet sounding she's she's hearing a voice and in that voice she's heard something that says this world is not my home I'm not happy in this world and if we're not happy in this world then get in Christ let him become our world Hallelujah Lord make me to know mine end can we say Amen to that I want to know what my end is and the measure of my days what it is that I may know how frail I am oh my behold thou Hast made my days as a hand breath and my age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity Silo can we say Amen to the word at our best state we're just vanity amen oh if my life was just different if my life was this if my life was that my brother and sister that's your best state is just vanity surely every man walketh in a vain show surely they are disquieted in vain he hepeth up riches and knoweth not Who Shall Gather them my and now Lord what a what wait I for My Hope is in thee the only hope we have Heavenly Father we ask you to come father you know the needs of every life every heart father you know that we have no remedy we were called to preach the gospel The unfailing Riches of our Lord Jesus Christ we were called to stand for truth to preach truth to live truth manifest truth father let us fulfill our portion of this great calling father speak to us today Lord let the word ring true may it go deep in the hearts of those with needs in their lives father I I on purposely father don't try to dig into people's lives unless they choose to share it because father I don't want to preach a tainted gospel a Prejudice gospel a a gospel disappointed to someone but father I believe if we just preach the truth it will find its resting place we preach the truth and it will bring deliverance we preach truth Lord and it will bring healing and deliverance let the truth go forth I pray today in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated Saints as we speak today on the measure of time we've been preaching about The Measure of Faith the measure of Grace my brother and sister we also have to quantify or put this in that of the gifts that God has given he has given us a measure of time now it is not we often hear in in the human vocabulary they will be someone maybe in their 30s 40s 50s pass away and they will say oh he he went before his time but my brother and sister if we believe God is a sovereign God then we would recognize that their time was not appointed by circumstance whether a car accident or a plane crash or this or that or a heart attack but it is appointed by God and not man amen and so it's there that we have confidence today that we live walk in the perfect will of God and I trust we can also say Amen to that too my God doesn't make a mistake because if he made one mistake my brother and sister how could I trust him with everything in my life how could you trust him if you were questioning everything is this right or is this just a mistake but we believe with all of our heart that it is the word of God and so it's not how many days we have but I want to ask you today what are you doing with the days God has granted to you if God has given you these days to manifest the word of God and to bring praise honor and Glory unto him are we fulfilling what we are called to do are we fulfilling the very uh manifestation of the word that has been placed in us and I say my brother and sister you'll find in the world today that a man can be granted a full life of 70 years or so and accomplish almost nothing my brother and sister and others would be there in their allotted days doing many things for the gospel reminds me of an a story of some Believers back East there and how as the brother and sister got old they had quite a few children I think 11 or 12 children and somebody one day said you know you sure didn't accomplish much in your life you didn't really do much you just always worked a menial job and now that you're old you have nothing not even a house of your own and the man said well I disagree with you I have been blessed beyond measure I believe I have accomplished yes I do not own a home my wife and I live with a family member so with a daughter her husband grandchildren yes that is true but I have raised 12 children to serve God and he viewed his life as success amen because he knew that he had made a difference amen not financially all of his children had to go make their own way in life but he had to live by the grace of God he had lived the word and left something angered in this soul and I would ask you what would be the measure of that man's days I say he was very blessed you know my brother and sister I would say this emphatically yes I want to live life just like you do I'm going to live it to the fullest but I would rather have a few days with the Lord than a hundred years without him and that is what we have to find in our life is how are we looking at the time that God has given us is there as we see in the prophet of God brother Branham says you know I'm 50 years old and if I'm ever going to do anything for the Lord I better get started and you look at his life at 50 years old my brother and sister and all that God had used him for he was not speaking the meaning of himself but he was speaking of an inner desire to do more for God amen and I say God let that desire be expressed in you and I that we would have a desire to do more for the Lord amen when we become satisfied have you ever noticed my brother and sister we become satisfied we're less motivated now there's no absolute direct correlation between those scriptures of the Rich Young Ruler and the man who is there to tear down his barns but I believe everything points to that being the Rich Young Ruler in his future in his maturity and he come to a day and said all of my barns are full all of my crops all of my Acres everything is great I'll just tear it all down and I'll build it up even greater and that was the time God said I call on you his measure of time was finished now my brother and sister I know this is just a pet topic for me I don't say it is Doctrine but I believe it's thought provoking that at the time that Jesus asked him to sell all he had and give to the poor the gift that God gave him was making money are you with me if he'd have started selling everything he had and giving to the poor God would have poured into him greater and greater and greater riches because then he would have surrendered what he had to God and knowing god was in control but what did he do he was afraid to lose what he had and if I sell it all I will become a pauper maybe homeless as they are well I can't do that I'm used to a good life but what he didn't realize is everything we pour out he promised to pour back into us with increase and this is not Prosperity Gospel this is Christ knowing I can trust this vessel I can trust this son this daughter that when I pour into them they don't hoard it they poured it out and there that God is moving in such a fashion that's why we as Sons and Daughters of God should not be ashamed to share this gospel you talk of the blessings of God you pour them out to the clerk in the store you pour them out to the neighbor you pour them out to the homeless and the despised and God will pour it right back into you oh my brother and sister you want to get blessed well you pour it out God will fill it back up and God is not a stingy God Amen he's not going to be there measuring it to the last cent if you were talking money or to the last of your spirit that you would be I poured it out and now I'm empty no my brother and sister they that wait upon the Lord shall have their strength renewed it's a promise of God Hallelujah if we would turn in our Bibles to Proverbs the third chapter verses one through seven amen proverbs 3. amen three and one we might have got that backwards I might have wrote it backwards it might have just happened who knows praise the Lord my son forget not my law I was talking to the young adults this morning you see it all depends on how you look at God when you look at God and you believe it's all judgment I made a mistake I asked the young people this morning you know they're a little shy I think maybe Brother Paul's a little too forward I don't know hopefully we can break them out of that pray that amen we we deliver our young people from there well anyway if we view God as a judgmental God everything about your life you're going to be looking for the equation of judgment in it but when you look at God as a God that says no I'm Desiring Perfection from you I've sent to I've sent a five-fold Ministry amen Ephesians 4 to bring you to Perfection but while you're working toward Perfection I've got more than enough Grace I've got the greatest measure of Grace to pour out upon you to get you to that place but you see if we view the law Jesus said I didn't come to do away with it I come to fulfill it amen change your view if you feel like it's harsh change your view don't ask God to change his laws amen because the law my brother and sister is our deliverance as I express to the young people sorry get sidetracked to this my brother and sister if you don't believe in God's laws and think that he ought to soften it this universe is held together by God's laws amen when he placed the Stars he placed the heavens of the Sun the moon the Earth it's all hung by God's law he declared it and it must come to pass and why is it they can predict a a eclipse 40 years in advance and tell you at this time of 3 41 a.m it will take place and because God's timepiece is so perfect amen it's not chance they didn't use a super computer amen I always thought it was interesting read a story about how that some guy built a team of people MIT I believe it was built a supercomputer and they called it the supernova because there is a supernova amen that is so predictable in its actions reactions to the timing its placement in the heavens that they were actually giving compliment to God that it's perfect on time all the time my brother and sister God is good amen hallelujah for length of days and long life amen that's what most of us strive for is good long life and peace who wants peace I'll tell you what my brother and sister we live in such a chaotic world Amen it's we ought to just be bold enough to stand up and say Lord I live in a chaotic world my mind is in a turmoil I need your peace I don't want to find peace out here I was talking to a lady yesterday that I've known for many years and she was just making a comment about what the world was like and it's just a miracle she's not a raging drunk and I had to agree with her it's just a wonder my brother and sister why because there's a peace beyond our comprehension there's a piece beyond what we can manufacture Hallelujah amen and shall add that's how they add to thee let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them are you reading that scripture with me let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them amen bind mercy and Truth amen about thy neck and write them upon the table of thine heart and so start thou so shout I'm sorry I'm having a hard time reading here so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart that's not all that's left over that's not the portion you haven't given to laodicea that's all of your heart and lean not thine own understanding that's why I always like to be very clear my brother and sister when I talk about things such as the story of the Rich Young Ruler I want you to know clearly I'm not trying to make scripture out of that I'm not trying to make Doctrine out of it it's how I see the word and I want you to know that but I want you to also realize I believe the principles are there to defend it amen the word is not stagnant it is not stale neither is it locked up the book is open trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not unto thine own understanding in other words have a flexible mind my brother and sister that whatever you believe when the word comes and shows you further Revelation you're willing to take what you believe set it to the side and say I was headed in the right direction but I didn't have the right Vision thank you Lord for the vision to see where you're taking me because otherwise my brother and sister we could be locked into the just shall live by faith and believe that's all there was to the gospel but look how far the word has come right look how far Revelation has brought us Through the Ages we still say Amen to Martin Luther's words my brother and sister his words are worthy of acknowledgment but God has took you much further Hallelujah in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy Pals be not wise in thy known eyes fear the lord and depart from evil oh my how much that would spare us if we would just come to the point that when evil showed its face on the horizon that we would just depart from that location amen now look my brother and sister because of the Fall you know it's interesting in a human element we would look at the fall and say man Adam Eve you sure did us wrong I could be living in Paradise right now I could I could be you know enjoying life without this struggle except for you but you realize my brother and sister right to the Garden Adam and Eve the serpent all the perfect plan of God you say well it'd been perfect if it hadn't to happen then my brother and sister where would the manifestation of Deliverance come from where would the manifestation of healing come from where would the moving of the Holy Spirit on us have come from well we wouldn't have needed all that brother Paul then God would have not proved he was God build a big enough fence you know brother Brian Jones Mahala Halla there in South Africa you know he has I don't know I guess it's still alive haven't been there for a while um but he had some honey badgers and do you know a honey Badger's whole goal in life is to get out of wherever it's at Hallelujah it digs under it climbs over they had a beautiful video they set a camera up because their honey badger kept what's the name of that thing I can't remember but anyway that little thing was constantly out and you know to create an environment that that honey badger would feel kind of home in the woods they had throwed these sticks and different things into the pin with a honey badger and on video you see the honey badger coming over there and pushing and pushing and pushing and he manages uh by sheer determination that's right to stand the stick up but it's in the middle of the wall he's halfway up it slides down the wall it falls he figures out if I stand this stick in the corner it's not going anywhere and he climbed right up and he's out and gone amen so they eliminated all the sticks or hooked him to the ground and then they go one day and the camera it just picks up the edge of it you see some dirt flying and the honey badger has dug a three foot deep hole under the wall and is free amen I'm telling you there's nothing keeping Mr honey badger in that cage and there is nothing going to keep the Bride of Jesus Christ locked up in laodicea on this Earth subject to Satan and his cage amen if we can't as it were go over it we'll go under it we'll go through it or we'll fly right out of it amen why because we're Eagles we're not meant to be caged we're not meant to be kept here but we were called into the heavenlies Hallelujah and I say my brother and sister because of the Fall we must labor that was a curse we must labor physical we all understand that physical you know sometimes sorry to put it this way Brothers but I think well these brothers that got these office jobs and computer jobs they just man they've got it made in the shade they don't know what it's like to donate blood and to stretch and to bruise into this and that and work long hours until I sat down at a computer trying to do something and then I'm like I'll just go back give me a shovel you see every one of us been equipped for what we've been called to you I want to Anchor that in your thoughts this morning we have been equipped what we've been called to we're not here ill-equipped or unequipped or unable but we are more than able through Jesus Christ he made us to be what he wants us to be Hallelujah so physical or spiritual this struggle is real but my brother and sister here's where Satan gets us he presents himself as the strong one he come to Jesus look at all the kingdoms of the Earth if you will fall down and serve me worship me I'll give all this to you was he lying no he was telling the truth he didn't tell all the truth all the truth was is he actually only had a lease not ownership Elise and his lease every single day is ticking ticking ticking until the point it expires Hallelujah so what are we going to do do we just have to exist and say well we'll just hopefully Lord survive long enough for the least to run out no my brother and sister amen he presents himself as powerful and it's influential in our daily lives can we we can admit that right it's not unspiritual to admit that Satan has influence in our daily life you know on on social media they call them influencers and I looked at that their social media influences or something like that you look at that and oh my I hope that I hope I'm don't sound sacrilegious but I wonder who they're influencing when you've got this young lady who's barely clothed with eyelashes and if you do this and this you can be like me not click yeah don't want to don't want to go there that's not who I am then you got the guy praise God I have a money stream by investing and I did this and I did that and there he is all muscular little Trunks and Tennis Shoes gives me time to be in the gym and if you sign up to my program you can end up like me no sorry not interested but the real influencer comes and says I laid my life down for you I paid a price so that you can be like me and something in my heart says yes Lord that's what I want to be I want to be just like you Lord he laid his life down we'll have to lay ours down we'll have to decide that what we think is happiness is not happiness if he's not in the picture amen what we think is prosperity it's not Prosperity unless he's in the picture and when he's in the picture oh how beautiful it is Hallelujah this influence in our daily lives you know what happens it's one of the things it can be a two-edged sword I have quite a vivid imagination the devil knows how to use it against you sister Jerry shared a little deal to me the other day and it was just spot on you see Satan can use every aspect of your life against you I'm a strong determined person the devil anoints it and it becomes stubbornness I have a great imagination the imagination will take you in places you should never go I have this Satan will use it I have that Satan will use it but when we yield it to Christ when we give it up it's no longer ours any longer my imagination is not my imagination God gave me an understanding to look at things and see it in a certain way and I say Lord let me commit that to you then it's not there for Satan to use against me but it's for you Lord to use to bless me amen so you look at this my brother and sister because if we're not careful Satan will come and dominate our thoughts but the prophet already gave us a warning says you know what the greatest battle you will ever fight will be right here it won't be with a sword in your hand it won't be with a spear or a gun or a cannon and a rocket my brother and sister it's not a balm that we can drop there's not a gospel balm to blow them out of there my brother and sister God says you're going to come and you're going to fight this battle and you're going to overcome in this battle right here and I'm gonna anoint you to be the Overcomer so give me your talent give me your ability give me your thoughts give me your imagination give it to me and I'll use it and you will be blessed buy it who wants to be blessed today I say Lord I want to be blessed I'm not ashamed my brother and sister not bashful to say Lord I want you to bless me but that doesn't mean more land more houses more cars mirror this or that it means I want more of Jesus Christ that's the real blessing for a son or daughter of God now I'll tell you this morning I'm selling kind of stride in teme it's not that I I mean to present it that way but there's just something been bubbling up inside of me Brother David hid on the edges of it Wednesday night and I you know you got to be careful that you're not there saying hold back now hold back buddy don't go there or to realize God's got continuity in thought continuity and song service he's got continuity in the scriptures we read and the desires of our heart God's got continuity my brother and sister now look at this as Adam and Eve isn't this lovely I love this portion the story gets kind of rough hits a few bumps in the cool of the evening Adam and Eve are walking through the garden and you see how it was my brother and sister they just walked they didn't go into the garden and say God are you here where are you God I don't see you I don't feel you where are you gone we've done that though haven't we wondered where is God oh but look my brother and sister Adam and Eve just walking in the cool of the evening through the garden and just as it was on the road to Emmaus he just would appear and he would walk with them amen oh how joyous how beautiful how present just moves my heart to think how it would be but then the fall came they're ushered out the gate and the angels are given commission don't let them return now that was only to the garden was not to return back to the presence of God but now they had to approach God differently do you see the transition that took place in the garden no longer was just walking through the garden enough to attract God to their presence but now God says you need to call on me now you need to call amen but when you call I will answer I will draw nigh to you you see a subtle change I'm going to ask you my brother and sister as they were walking through the garden and that time in this fellowship with God we see that there is a you might say a scriptural change in the approach but I want to ask you this one question this morning what is keeping you from an eye from walking as it were in the garden and calling on the Lord and his presence being with us people say well I haven't felt the spirit of God move you're not walking in the garden provided you're not calling on his name because he said that he would come and draw nigh to you if you would call on his name see nothing stopping us we can look back and say oh to be in the garden my brother and sister oh to be right here and laodicea as Sons and Daughters of God to call on his name and say Lord I need you come now to me Lord amen but we got this idea that it's all changed it hasn't changed Satan has interjected himself and said look I'm more powerful God doesn't hear your voice God's not going to answer your prayer God is gone that what was the voice that kicked him out of the garden it was in God's voice it was Satan's voice that kicked him out of the garden God's voice would have been don't do it sorry I'm just getting wound up I think I wound my spring too tight I had two cups of coffee this morning Hallelujah I'm telling you right after church we're all going to go run through the park So Adam and Eve walked in the cool of the evening with the Lord and I want to know what is stopping you from walking in the cool of the evening with the Lord it's not him it's not even Satan we've put Satan in too high of position of authority have you ever noticed brother Brown talks about this it's down in the evening time Satan's smart down in the evening time what's he doing he's looking back in time and saying it was in the evening times when the fellowship took place right in the evening time we'll have thoughts of unrest well thoughts of Unfinished things there'll be a little turmoil shows up in the family go study it yeah domestic abuse and all of these other things starts usually escalates in the evening time what's he doing Satan breaking Fellowship oh he doesn't care whether they're ranked sinners they can be a bunch of drunks in the evening time amen that's why some cities the police force has just a little handful of officers going around during the day and the evening shift will be three times as large the night shift because the spirits disrupting everything in the cool of the evening and the time for you and I to worship first thing in the morning and the cool of the evening don't let Satan dominate that that's right kick him right out Hallelujah now look in Job 14 and 1 it says man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of wonderful prosperity and blessings no my Bible says it's full of trouble well I want to be a happy Christian well walk in the cool of the evening amen get it be the one that brings the sacrifice be the one that lays it down be the one that draws upon the inexhaustible Fountain of God but my brother and sister are you a born of a woman anybody here not born of a woman amen you know the government's suddenly on a deal you talk about distracting a whole Kingdom a whole nation we suddenly have an incredible need to find unidentified flying objects and aliens it's of utmost importance to our nation in its economy and people is that we identify but they won't believe my brother in simple simple word of God when a prophet of God said they're investigating angels they call it they call it crazy but do they have an offering for it nothing at all no we have a petrified mummy found in the desert or it looks like it be it could just be a rock but we're pretty sure this is a petrified alien and so far your government has wasted only like 20 million on this and what will it prove if it was a petrified alien nothing they're still corrupt they'll still crooked they're still serving a system but they're anointed of God to fulfill the word to create an atmosphere for you and I and we in that atmosphere are not caught in their atmosphere because their atmosphere is rejecting our atmosphere and that atmosphere of laodicea of this world this wicked world that Satan could boast and say I give you these kingdoms that atmosphere is pushing you out oh don't cry that you've been pushed out of laodicea rejoice Rejoice I got solved out I have no Fellowship in laodicea oh that's too bad that's too bad don't feel at home here my heart breaks Hallelujah amen I want to ask you a simple question will the trouble of your life young people old people listen to me will the trouble of your life Define Who You Are I say the word of God defines who you are amen God's calling in your life God's desire to you the creative word of God that came from the foundation of the world that come and made you is what defines you it's not Satan it's not laodicea not the spirit of the aid not the fashion of the age not the religion of the age it's God that defines Who We Are Hallelujah look the word says that Satan was going to and fro and if you'll just forgive me for this little twist of the word but Satan going to and fro seeking whom he may convince that the trouble is greater than the Lord he's doing it he's doing it you don't understand our problems no I don't understand your problem but I do understand the solution to your problem right amen right the devil's over there your problem's so big your problem's so big and God says just give it to me I'll take that big problem amen I'll take the problem I'll deal with it I'll take it and drop it in the ink of my blood or I mean the volume of my blood and the ink of your sin and problem will gone not even an element do you catch that I know you do I I almost sound like I'm speaking down but you realize my brother and sister when that drop of ink hit the bleach it didn't swallow it it dismantled it that's right it pulled it molecule from molecules from molecule to molecule until there was not one drop of cohesion amongst the molecules and when the word of God says that our sin went to the sea of forgetfulness it's not like the devil could mount an expedition and go and search and search and search until he would find our sin when the blood of Jesus Christ took our sin it dismantled it amen not not one person of it would ever be able to come back together and that's why it can't be remembered because it can't be brought back oh Hallelujah hey man it's gone oh thank you amen but Satan trying to convince hit the trouble is greater than the promise of the word my brother and sister his he's such a liar it just comes down to that simple he's such a liar you know there's just people anointed that if they would just tell the truth it'd actually be better for them but they're so anointed they just have to lie you know somebody runs over something you can look at the tire tracks and say oh those are the tires that are on that truck did you run over that not me well how come the truck the trucks lead right to your truck my truck must have done it without me knowing well if I have a truck that does things without me knowing make me nervous I don't know my truck might go out and rob a bank you can do it without me knowing but I tell you what my brother and sister in the struggle of Our Lives once again sorry to put you on the spot do we have struggles I'm gonna lift both hands here okay for those of you that won't lift your hands I'm gonna lift both hands we have struggles amen we have trials we have all kinds of things that come upon us there's nothing to be ashamed about that's the devil says where you should be ashamed my brother and sister there is no shame in Jesus Christ amen in the struggle I want you to remember this scripture turn to First Samuel 17 45 to 47. and I just want to say I just want to say this I don't say this boasting I don't say this to boost brother Paul I don't say does nothing but sometimes you've got to just stop and say God is using something greater uh we around our house there's been some kind of little something going on you know and like clockwork I mean for for days upon days and days and days wake up at 4 30 a.m almost on the Dot 4 30 A.M and I'm like my I worked all the way into the dark I've worked so many hours I'm not I'm just laying a foundation for you I've worked so many hours in Harvest here that I'm just physically exhausted I hate to admit this Brother David but I'm sitting there listening to you preach Wednesday night falling asleep amen nothing to be proud about but so tired just simply the body checking out and then you look at that and say oh Lord forgive me but my brother and sister I tell you what wake up at 4 30 a.m I'm laying there at 4 30 a.m and I'm like Lord why you know I need to sleep and he speaks to me and says you need to pray you don't need sleep I want you to pray and I'll lay there in bed too tired even get out of the bed and I lay there and I start on one end of the valley and I'm praying for you I don't know what's going on in your life but I know that God wants prayers to go to heaven for you he wants him to come to the throne he wants a sweet older to come and I say God for whatever needs are in this body let the prayers move us to the place we believe the word and we believe he's moving in our midst Hallelujah first Samuel 17 45. then said David you might wonder how does this even connect together brother Paul I hope you see it then sent David to the philistine now cometh to me with a sword and with a spear and with depression and with this spirit and with thy Spirit you come with a spirit of laodicea and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied I want to ask you does Satan never defy you amen you'll be saying Lord it and boy it just seems like the wheels fall off the wagon Lord did you hear my prayer he sure did but the prophet of God told us God has granted to the devil one punch most of the time we don't want to face that one punch because regardless of what you think about the devil people got him as some limping toothless lion no my brother and sister he's as close and imitation to the lion of the tribe of Judah as Satan could produce that's how close he is he looks like a lion Walks Like A lion roars like a lion but he's not the lion of Judah amen he's the impersonation amen you realize when the prophet of God oh I'm sorry we're going to really mess up today I said Lord don't let me get distracted but my brother and sister do you realize if two lions walked into this church now I have been those of you that have been there you see this I have been in Africa and I've been within just this little distance of I think would be why they call him the king of peace the end of his nose this big his paws this big that tall get up and stretch and make every human bodybuilder envious as every muscle ripples down his body even the moving of his tail causes muscles to go Bing Bing Bing and if two lions walked in here we would not know the difference between the lion of Judah and Satan's lion so close to deceive the very left amen one would come and say worship me and I'll bless you and you would need the Holy Ghost it's not my brother and sister us against the denominations to be deceived and some say well it's right in the message to deceive it but my brother and sister the prophet of God said he'll bring it so close right if it were possible but it's a holy ghost in you not doctrines no no how much you read the Bible how much you've listened to the message it's the Holy Ghost and that is not a teaching that is a relationship that is not our doctrines better than your Doctrine that's those I have dug into the word and received the inoculation against laodicea and the moving and the filling with the Holy Ghost makes it with eyes of wisdom and discernment and understanding and revelation and we think we're going to teach people into the Rapture we're going to explain people into the Rapture we're going to convince people into the Rapture no sir it'll be revelation of the word taking us into the rapture and if it's revelation of the word then what do we need more word I'll tell you what the Zeal of thine house Lord Hallelujah amen somebody helped me where was I defy come to thee in the name of the Lord to host the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand who would actually lift a hand this morning I'm not meaning to place but I lift a hand and say you know what the devil is going to be delivered into my hands you say no no that's for God no you are the hands and the feet of God he's going to deliver how that confession let it be today from your lips Satan you're going to be delivered in my house I'm not going to be delivered into your hands oh Hallelujah I will smite thee now I want to just ask you sorry I'm probably way over time I think we can wrap up five pages in five minutes brother and sister look at this now when does it ever really just strike you in your everyday struggle Satan God's delivering you into my hands mostly we're writing out a writ a decree of truce devil you don't bother me I won't bother you Lord if you just let me get through this day devil leave me alone everything will be all right no sir that's not what's going to deliver you and I out of laodicea it's going to take more than a truce remember the truce of world war one because that's really what it was they said it was a surrender but the actual words of the documents were a truce that's it the prophet touches on those things and so because it was a truce it had to carry on look at what's happening in Korea our truce what is truce you think you're getting Deliverance by calling a truce with the devil truth is actually defined as unended War you want to truce with the devil you're just asking for a fight that goes on and on and on and on it's time we're more than conquerors we're not truthmakers Hallelujah amen I was smite thee and take thine head from me and I will give the carcass of the host of the Philistines this day into the fowls of the air and the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all Hallelujah I love words all this assembly amen we're going to put another name in there all this assembly Grace Tabernacle amen shall know that the Lord saveth not with the sword and spirit for the battle is the Lord's no see you're facing struggles in your life right now it's not your battle you think well if I can just defeat this if I can just defeat that I'm sorry you are not going to defeat anything the battle is the Lord you want Victory give it to God hey man you want Victory go to him and say Lord I need you and he shall give you into our hands I want to put Clarity to this I believe the Lord laid this on my heart I believe it fits in continuity of the word but my brother and sister when we studied this you go back and he says I'll cut your head off wow we're going to cut the devil's head off praise the Lord cut the devil's house no sir you know what you're doing you're cutting off his headship that's exactly where there's no head there's no headship and God is giving to you and I the ability Hallelujah now I don't mean this to be anything if you did or didn't but how many of you brought your sword to church today amen what are you going to cut the head of the devil off gonna cut his headship off with you're going to take this very word of God and David was there and he took the devil's own interpretation of the Bible and he took it and cut off that headship that there was no headship over Israel from that and we are here my brother and sister the Goliath I don't know what goliath is in your life but we are here under the headship of the Holy Ghost to take the word of the hour and cut off Satan's headship then we can then say we've been set free from you you roaring lion you're no longer have headship over me no longer headship of the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and the spirit of laodicea but I've been set free can somebody say that I have been set free amen that's what this gospel is about it's not to create another denomination another group another religion but it's here for a people to take the word and cut the headship of Satan away from our life Hallelujah this is the time my brother and sister this is a season this is the age that I say this this morning this is the moment of time cut it off amen cut it off David could have just hit Goliath in the chin knocked him out and with Goliath come too he could have had him all bound up like that little kids story about the Beanstalk or whatever and they tied the guy up and he couldn't convert it Goliath because Goliath had would have had fear I'm not here to scare the devil I'm not here to throw the name of Jesus Christ around seven sons of Siva they went in there in that den of spirits and thought they were going to scare those spirits my brother and sister but when the word went in to those spirits the word cut the headship off and when the headship was cut off Deliverance oh help me Lord cut the head of this thing off I'll tell you what God's doing he's using Sons and Daughters of God Amen yes God in you look it up God in you my brother and sister people are like his god in me if you don't know that answer don't leave here today till you find that answer you better know that God is in you this is not some kind of phraseology this is a literal interpretation of the word of God Amen what is it oh I'm just waiting come on Saints I'm waiting for God to deliver me from this spirit that spirit or this Behavior or this thing over here God's waiting for you to pick up the five stones of faith in Jesus Christ go read it again you don't see that God provided David with a rocket launcher with a sniper scope but David had to wind his arm up amen and the scripture often returns to it refers to it as the arm of faith he had to take the arm of Faith what was he doing the prophet of God says you need to exercise your faithful Faith muscles and build them up and that's what David did he exercised by getting down five Stones those weren't just any old stones they weren't going to be the stone of denomination of the stone of intellectualism the stone of emotionalism my brother and sister those were the stones of Jesus Christ in faith amen and he let that go and when he hit that old devil he didn't go he won't be bothering me for a while no sir he took the word and said today Lord is a day you ordained me to find my own freedom in Jesus Christ you imagine what kind of pampered princesses we would be oh God just take this from me take that from me I have a boss that's so bad or just I don't know what you want to do with him just make him disappear maybe that boss is there to build character that's right maybe that job is to build character maybe I'm here to build character in you sister Jerry laughs yes that's good I don't say that mockingly amen Hallelujah Hallelujah why because God is going to use you and I amen you Sons and Daughters of God yes it's God in you to cut off Satan's headship you say the message is going to do it the message is going to do it no it's the message Jesus Christ in you that's going to do it right do we believe that we're his hands and his feet we believe his voice amen we believe that we are the very action of the word the book of Acts and continuation hey man Somebody's gotta be that believer that's going to carry on the book of Acts Hallelujah let me hurry here amen you know one of our problems I don't know why this was like a random thought only I don't believe in random but don't focus on the unbeliever come on Saints well they don't or they do what about don't focus on them well why focus on Goliath focus on God all of Israel was focusing on Goliath amen and David was focusing on God he was the only one that had that testimony that day you've defied the army of the Living God so what's the ownership it's not the Army owning God it's God owning the army Hallelujah so amen don't focus on what's look I don't know why I'm speaking this like I said I don't believe in random there's random in my studies in a sense that it just come to me but my brother and sister don't Focus on the unbeliever that's telling you what's wrong with you don't focus on what ain't happening in their life oh I prayed and I searched and I asked God for Revelation I'm sorry I'm sorry I I don't know how to deal with that other than you just keep getting before God but your life or lack of is not going to determine my life do we serve a prayer answering God if their prayers are not being answered does that mean we quit no sir it means we Rejoice we lift our voices and we say thank you Lord thank you Lord it's not me that's special Lord but it's you in me has made me a special person and I believe that hallelujah look my brother and sister the battle certainly the word not to place an emphasis but the battle is the Lord's of very very much so in the day that we live in amen we're living we're seeing this wicked time we're seeing these things come to pass and we realize amen how many of you got up this morning and said praise God devil get out of my way you know in one sense you could because it is God in you speaking but when we get in the flesh and we start thinking who we're going to tell the devil and anybody else what to do back to seven sons of Siva Satan I adjure you well they do they ran out of there almost stripped naked and beaten and clawed and bit and and just just destroyed my brother and sister we we're not the overcomer it's Christ in US amen is he overcomer Hallelujah okay so in this age amen if the battle is the Lord's then we must be his hands his feet his voice scriptural right every one of those be defended with scripture amen the word says we're the army of the Living God hallelujah who's in the Army today amen every one of us ought to be lifted in the hand and say yes sir now look at this my brother and sister if the the we are those five little stones or have those five little Stones I should say of faith and Jesus Christ amen and you can take that without being out of context and say it's faith in Jesus Christ amen so those five little Stones amen that measure of faith that God has given you and I is sufficient okay how many times have we spoke to ourselves and said Lord if I had more faith amen don't say that any longer Lord let the faith in me come forth amen let the grace that you have given Lord be on display oh don't go giving yourself Grace I can behaved this way because there's Grace no sir give Grace to someone else and they'll give real Christians grace to you and the prophet of God says this is how Unity comes in the church yeah when Christ is on display that's right exactly there's where Unity comes in the church when Christ is on display not when Paul is on display or you are on display but when Christ is on display amen so these five little stones of face Measure of Faith is sufficient I say Amen to that amen his measure of grace is sufficient amen and these things will defeat the enemy I'm skipping over notes in case you wonder what's going on here amen hallelujah and so the measure of Grace the word of God the prophet of God said this word of God this anointed word will defeat the enemy at any time in any place under any circumstance now I want to encourage you today to take the word and when the word has slain the enemy cut off his headship don't walk out of here today and say well I'm dealing with this and I'm dealing with it and I'm dealing with that no I'm dealing with Christ I'm dealing with the word and the word says Hallelujah you think when he said any circumstance he actually had a fine print you guys have all heard the radio ads always comes with car dealers and we have you know this BMW blah blah blah blah blah for this price blah blah blah I don't know there's only one blah blah blah blahness this applies and even though you didn't read the fine print when it's all done you always triple but what do we hear what do we hear I get a 5 Series BMW for only 300 a month and that's the devil how about we stop and say devil you're a liar the word says whenever we sin I'm paraphrasing this whenever we sin even as Believers we pay ice why because God wants you to make make you sick and tired of being sick and tired he wants you to come to the place you stand up and say Lord I'm taking the word I'm hitting this spirit that bothers me right between the eyes and then I'm going to take this sword that the enemy actually provided I'm going to cut its head off amen and I'm going to walk out of here I am you know Brother Paul's Twisted it they even added a verse to it I'm sorry I can't help myself I'm no longer a Slave To Fear but it strikes me and I found myself in the tractor one day singing I'm no longer a slave to sin I am a child of God Amen I am no longer a slave to sin I have been set free of the headship of Satan oh Hallelujah hallelujah sister vika will you come oh Hallelujah what's doing this inexhaustible Supply I'll just go really quick brother branham's talking Amen in this and show us the father is what I was listening to yesterday and he's in there and he's talking about the Apple amen everything every leaf and every apple is in that tree when it's just this little thing now if every Redemptive blessing of God has been given to the bride of Christ is it when you are fully mature or when you're just this little Christian not Redemptive blessing is available to you let me push out leaves the prophet of God I just sit there and cried my heart rejoiced what does it do the little apple tree doesn't set in fret oh how can I produce all these leaves how can I produce all these apples but the prophet of God lays it out with such anointing all it's got to do is drink and push out drink and push out drink and push out and that's what's in it how it comes to manifestation drink and push out oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh I'll tell you my brother and sister I got so moved I'd really like to do this what has God placed in you already he said he already placed in you Faith he placed Grace do you realize every amen you'll ever speak is already in you do you realize my brother and sister that every Hallelujah that you'll ever see in your life is in you oh it's not just words it's God placing in you the very seed of the manifestation receive the word and to magnify the word every Lord forgive me is already in you you know why is it so hard to repent we act like it all I'm wrong and I know I'm wrong but God placed that forgive me inside of you let it out oh don't throw it around flippantly ah forgive me amen no my brother and sister but don't act like somebody's pulling your eye teeth out why don't you just say you know what that's the word I know I'm wrong a holy spirit already spoke to me it's not going to degrade me Lord I need to say it give me courage you imagine what life would be if every time we thought we were offended none of you ever get offended right let's just use it for an example it's it's a church like this one but different people [Music] what it would be when offense comes husband wife parents to children children to parents brother sister preacher to preacher right that if we was alive sure didn't like that [Music] well that sure looked pointed forgive me brother well you didn't do anything I'm just following the word the prophet said Prophet said just follow the word you're offended you go to them you don't sit I'm not moving until they apologize well I can see buddy Robinson out there in the field saying Lord I'm not moving until I got the Holy Ghost rather you'll find my bones there but I'm telling you with that kind of attitude they'd find our bones there and it sure wouldn't be because we were waiting on the Holy Spirit come on Saints all of this has already been placed in US amen every response of Amen to the word of God is in US waiting to come out God help us let me drink Lord and push out let me drink and push out let me drink and push out Lord hallelujah do we have time for one more quote or one quote period I guess amen is that can we put that on the screen brother Gideon [Music] be not afraid it just I'm spoiled Saints it's just so much better to read it they've proven the things that you read you absorb versus what you hear yeah I think that's a proven fact of why the word of God says listen to The Voice yeah okay when Jesus was God made flesh the fullness of God was in him foreign he had the spirit without measure I read a quote here the other day we have it by measure now if you go out here and pick up a spoonful of water out of the ocean well that's what Jesus had the whole ocean but you and I have got a spoonful that's the difference you would never miss it he don't have to have us but we have to have him but if you took that spoonful of water and took it down to the laboratory the same chemicals that's in the entire ocean is in that spoonful and when God on the day of Pentecost when he come down like a rushing wind did you notice he was a pillar of fire but did you notice he separated himself from that Pillar of Fire and divided himself amongst his people and cloven tongues of fire set upon the congregation the preacher each one of them each of them God separated himself to his church no wonder he spoke wherever two or three are gathered in my name Amen Let me put it this way I mean where they gathered in my name they've got every ingredient that was in me in the beginning Hallelujah I'd have the ocean if I had a lot of it no you can have that Spoonful and you have it hey man no wonder he spoke where two or three gathered my name I'll be in their midst if two will agree upon anything and ask I'll give it to you see you know why we don't have my brother and sister because we haven't come in the correct Unity we're coming well this is where I stand that's where you stand this is where this church is at that's where that preacher is at how about we stand and identify in Jesus Christ and let that word be our identification Hallelujah oh my what was that when the little fire here and a little fire here and each one of you is a part of God when we come together it's the body of Christ uniting God separating himself giving part to me in part to you and part to the next fella so we can all live and have eternal life and now that eternal life comes from the word the Greek word as I said Zoe which
