[38:03] Jesus Christ and for your glory amen
[38:07] amen I'd like you to turn with me now
[38:11] sister I'm going to upset you on the
[38:14] scriptures here because I had the first
[38:16] scripture First Corinthians I'll read
[38:18] that in a moment but I want you to turn
[38:20] with me Genesis 5 24.
[38:25] to begin with
[38:27] and my title as she had if you want to
[38:30] put that title up again
[38:32] or I don't know if you had it up perfect
[38:34] satisfaction
[38:36] perfect peace
[38:38] perfect Rest In Christ
[38:41] amen
[38:43] my subject tonight is the faith of God
[38:46] that moves in you
[38:49] is the True Believer
[38:53] the faith of God that moves in you
[38:56] is the True Believer we'll come to that
[38:58] quote in just a minute
[39:01] but in Genesis 5 24
[39:05] or I'm sorry five I said yes 524 and
[39:09] enocht walked
[39:11] with Excuse me yes and Enoch walked with
[39:14] God
[39:15] my glasses are playing tricks on me and
[39:18] Enoch walked with God I want you to
[39:20] notice that walked with God
[39:25] the Eternal one
[39:27] and he was not and he was not for God
[39:32] took him
[39:34] then I want you to go to Hebrews 11.
[39:43] Hebrews 11.
[39:45] and we'll begin reading with verse 5 and
[39:48] verse 6.
[39:58] he was 11 I'm sorry to mix that up back
[40:01] there I
[40:03] told my brother where we was going and
[40:06] then I change I didn't change it he
[40:08] changed it
[40:11] I'll put the blame on him
[40:14] it's not blame it's perfect in what he
[40:16] does how many believe that okay
[40:19] Hebrews
[40:21] 11.
[40:23] verse 5.
[40:25] excuse me
[40:27] all right
[40:30] bye
[40:31] faith I want you to notice this faith
[40:35] is a revelation
[40:40] revelation
[40:42] is faith
[40:44] all right by Faith by Revelation Enoch
[40:50] was translated that he should not see
[40:53] death
[40:55] and was not found because God had
[40:58] translated him for before his
[41:01] translation he had this testimony
[41:05] remember there's going to be Overcomers
[41:07] here that are going to have a testimony
[41:10] a testimony of a true Witness
[41:13] we find that in Revelations 12 11.
[41:16] amen they are they are Washed by the
[41:19] blood the blood of the Lamb the
[41:21] Overcoming By the blood of the lamb and
[41:23] the testimony which they held is that
[41:25] right all right so God had translated
[41:29] for before his translation he had this
[41:31] testimony he pleased God how did he
[41:36] please God the prophet said with
[41:37] rapturing faith
[41:40] amen and so the next verse says answers
[41:44] it for without faith
[41:46] it is impossible to please him
[41:49] for he that cometh to God must believe
[41:52] that he is
[41:54] he must have faith that he is
[41:57] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[42:00] diligently diligently
[42:03] not slothily
[42:06] amen not dilatorily
[42:09] that's right that's how the that's how
[42:12] the the tribulation Saints one of the
[42:14] reasons they missed
[42:16] didn't have the oil was it was dilatory
[42:19] amen all right so
[42:23] in them that diligently seek Him Hebrews
[42:26] 11 1.
[42:29] now Faith is the substance

[43:34] incapable of making mistakes or being
[43:37] wrong
[43:40] incapable

[44:04] incapable of making mistakes or being
[44:06] wrong other words perfect Flawless
[44:09] error-free faultless precise accurate
[44:12] never failing
[44:14] amen
[44:16] let's read this quote you can follow
[44:18] with me as I read it here so it so isn't
[44:22] it wonderful to know
[44:24] yes it is what is that no faith
[44:28] isn't it wonderful to know that it's all
[44:31] settled
[44:34] amen
[44:35] that you can know that you know your
[44:37] future is clear
[44:41] amen
[44:42] all right you have you have a a
[44:47] expected
[44:49] end
[44:52] it's all settled I just love it don't
[44:54] you
[44:56] just that perfect satisfaction
[44:59] and no
[45:02] or knowing that his Spirit lives in you
[45:06] that his Spirit something you know that
[45:08] his Spirit lives in you that lives in
[45:11] you is an abiding it's a difference to
[45:14] have the spirit abiding you than just
[45:16] anointing you
[45:20] amen
[45:21] certainly we love the anointing
[45:22] certainly we have to have the anointing
[45:24] the water of the anointing Must Fall
[45:26] upon the seed but then it ought to bring
[45:29] but then the seed is made manifest
[45:31] that's the word in spirit form living in
[45:35] you
[45:37] amen all right
[45:40] now what is it doing bearing record of
[45:43] the resurrected Jesus Christ remember

[46:11] Spirit he won't come he won't he'll work
[46:14] through the spirit which is a
[46:15] sanctification
[46:18] but you've got to go beyond
[46:19] sanctification don't you the new birth
[46:21] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[46:23] on the seed
[46:25] that's the new birth
[46:27] you can't have a new birth without the
[46:29] seed laying there by pre or other words
[46:31] predestinated there it was placed there
[46:34] before the foundation of the world all
[46:37] right now
[46:39] so you're very so the spirit living in
[46:42] you is bearing witness or record of the
[46:44] resurrected Jesus Christ
[46:46] and right to living friendship with him
[46:50] every day not trying
[46:53] to live this or live that but him in you
[46:58] just lives his own life out
[47:02] going where he wants you to go
[47:05] saying what he wants you to say
[47:08] doing what he wants you to do
[47:12] that's the way to live isn't it
[47:16] and you people who are living that way
[47:19] speaking to you tonight
[47:22] God bless you my dear brother and sister
[47:24] and just strive and pray for others to
[47:27] come into that wonderful faith
[47:33] the Revelation in Christ Jesus what is
[47:36] that Revelation it's the faith of Jesus
[47:39] Christ
[47:41] amen
[47:43] all right
[47:45] and that never failing that infallible I
[47:49] think I already mentioned that it's
[47:50] never
[47:51] failing word
[47:55] if you'll put the next quote up in
[47:57] perfect faith my sister listen I'm
[47:58] wanting to read these first before I go
[48:00] further
[48:01] in the word here delay a little
[48:03] Foundation
[48:06] this is the perfect faith
[48:09] paragraph 68. now the only thing you
[48:12] have to do that is have faith in what
[48:13] you are you
[48:16] now the only thing you have to do is
[48:17] have Revelation who's going to give you
[48:20] that Revelation and how does it come
[48:22] you can't please God otherwise without
[48:24] it
[48:26] and we're not talking about a faith
[48:27] brother Brown we'll say this a little
[48:29] bit later we're not talking about a
[48:30] faith but
[48:32] substance faith
[48:34] perfect faith
[48:36] there's only one perfect Faith that's
[48:38] God's own faith
[48:41] amen and to have God's own faith has to
[48:44] have God in you
[48:47] Hallelujah all right now so the only
[48:51] thing you have to do is have faith we'll
[48:53] come back to he'll come back to this a
[48:54] little bit is have faith in what you are
[48:56] have faith in what the word says you are
[49:02] and Jesus you know what the word says
[49:04] you are the word says you are him
[49:08] the problem brother Brown said every
[49:10] promise that pertained to Jesus Christ
[49:11] pertains to the bride
[49:14] praise the Lord
[49:17] all right he said he said now have faith
[49:20] in what the word says you are and Jesus
[49:22] had Faith Revelation in the word of God
[49:24] that said what he was it is it is
[49:28] written of me
[49:30] can you take this word and realize it's
[49:33] written of you
[49:35] it never was written of you to be a
[49:37] failure it's written of you to be
[49:39] Eternal it's written of you to be a part
[49:41] of him it's written of you as an
[49:44] overcomer
[49:46] more than an overcomer all right
[49:51] said and and
[49:55] Jesus had faith in the word it's written
[49:58] of me didn't David in the Psalms and the
[50:00] prophets and all then speak of him
[50:02] I am the member I said is spoke of him
[50:05] can you see yourself written there
[50:08] he said I am the bread of life that came
[50:10] from God out of Heaven you see brother
[50:12] sister that was the hidden Mystery
[50:15] that God had in the back part of his
[50:17] mind
[50:18] that he was not to let out until the
[50:20] opening of the word or the book
[50:22] containing the record of his bride
[50:26] that's why without that open book we'll
[50:29] never have a Rapture in our body
[50:32] it takes that opened record
[50:35] not not opened at the white Throne
[50:37] judgment open to us now we have the
[50:40] record opened and the judge is saying
[50:43] there is no fault in her
[50:45] she is me she is who I am she's myself
[50:49] revealed the bride is himself quoting
[50:52] brother Branham the bride is himself
[50:54] revealed
[50:56] that's the faith we're speaking of all
[50:59] right he said and Jesus he said didn't
[51:02] David the psalm the prophet all of them
[51:04] speak of him I am the bread of life that
[51:06] come from God out of Heaven amen

[51:37] said from the garden on the tree of life
[51:38] from the Garden of Eden I am all these
[51:41] things I am that I am
[51:44] and he knew with that perfect faith
[51:48] substance faith that he was the anointed
[51:51] Messiah

[51:55] pouring out his Spirit Upon Us anointed

[53:02] surrender yourself it's a surrendering
[53:04] every day we die daily we take up our
[53:07] Cross of death

[55:49] and we'll read with starting with
[55:52] verse
[55:54] 16.
[55:55] and 17.
[56:09] therefore let's it will just take 16
[56:11] with it wherefore henceforth know we no
[56:14] man after the flesh
[56:20] foreign
[56:23] let's just start at verse 14. just give
[56:26] you a background for the love of Christ
[56:28] constraineth us because we thus judge
[56:31] that if one died for all then we're all
[56:34] dead
[56:37] amen and that he died for all that they
[56:40] which live should not henceforth live
[56:42] unto themselves
[56:44] goes right with the sermon Sunday
[56:46] but unto him which died for them and
[56:49] rose again
[56:51] him where
[56:53] him and you him in the word the word in
[56:56] you
[56:58] all right wherefore henceforth wherefore
[57:02] henceforth
[57:04] we know no man after dead flesh
[57:11] we know no man after the flesh
[57:13] your flesh you find no good thing in
[57:16] your flesh so don't quit quit trying to
[57:18] judge yourself by your flesh your
[57:20] mistakes your failures your your
[57:22] inactions you're this you're that but
[57:24] what's in the soul what's revealed
[57:27] where's the evidence lay it lays in the
[57:30] unveiling or revelation of Christ in you
[57:33] that you're his seed what will that do
[57:36] live the word
[57:37] it moves in you
[57:41] all right not something you do he said
[57:43] not something you tried to do live this
[57:46] live that but he works and you acts in
[57:49] you Works speaks in you amen does in you
[57:54] it's a daily living it's not just a
[57:56] church it's a daily living he doesn't
[57:59] change when you're in church and then
[58:01] change when you're out
[58:03] amen he's the living
[58:06] word living person
[58:10] Amen brother Trevor a living person the
[58:13] living person
[58:15] eternal life person
[58:17] all right let's let's go with this a
[58:19] little bit as we go further here so we
[58:22] know no matter for the flesh though we
[58:24] have known Christ after the flesh yet
[58:26] now henceforth no we him no more after
[58:31] the flesh
[58:33] you can't judge yourself by your outward
[58:36] God doesn't so why should you I'm
[58:38] speaking to the bride tonight
[58:43] amen all right therefore If any man be
[58:47] in Christ
[58:50] amen there's the big statement in Christ
[58:53] when were you in Christ before the
[58:56] foundation of the world
[58:58] amen you were existing in his thought
[59:01] you were in him then
[59:04] he chose you before the foundation of
[59:07] the world all right and and you're and
[59:10] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[59:14] now watch this Revelation he is a new
[59:18] creation
[59:19] a new creature
[59:22] not the old creature patched up this is
[59:24] a new creature this is a birth creature
[59:28] by the word of God by the thought of God
[59:31] expressed in word for this season he
[59:33] births you
[59:36] that's what the message of the hours to
[59:38] do
[59:40] Amen brother Brandon when he started his
[59:42] message his ministry he laid the
[59:44] foundation he laid the Cornerstone
[59:47] is that right what was his ministry
[59:49] doing taking these loose taking these
[59:51] loose things that had been forgotten
[59:53] through the years
[59:55] right baptism
[59:57] eternal security predestination
[1:00:00] amen
[1:00:02] on and on
[1:00:05] but what happened
[1:00:07] the corner was turned
[1:00:09] and the coroner became the head
[1:00:12] to cap off that
[1:00:14] building
[1:00:16] which takes The Headstone Ministry and
[1:00:19] the seventh seal message of Revelations
[1:00:21] 10 is The Headstone Ministry
[1:00:26] it's the Capstone Ministry
[1:00:29] this is our perfecting
[1:00:31] this is our perfection
[1:00:34] we're not going to make a bride without
[1:00:36] coming into that stature
[1:00:39] brother brother Marcus made it very
[1:00:41] clear you grow up into him and we have a
[1:00:44] scripture here you must grow it's not
[1:00:46] the the new birth you're an infant but
[1:00:48] you must grow now
[1:00:50] and what how do we grow we'll come to it
[1:00:53] in a minute but from glory to glory
[1:00:55] another place that said from Faith to
[1:00:57] Faith
[1:01:00] amen amen all right from Faith to Faith
[1:01:05] Enoch walked like that Enoch walked with
[1:01:08] God from Faith to Faith with a raptured
[1:01:11] faith he said
[1:01:13] pleasing God he had this testimony
[1:01:17] that he pleased God
[1:01:20] Glory so the new creature we're talking
[1:01:23] about is a person
[1:01:27] and that person is the unveiling of the
[1:01:29] word in you now let's let's see what he
[1:01:31] said here
[1:01:33] and he said All Things become new
[1:01:35] now let's let's go to another quote here
[1:01:38] but the real believer no matter what
[1:01:41] they are he said no matter what excuse
[1:01:43] me but the real believer no matter what
[1:01:46] they are thoroughly satisfied they are
[1:01:49] thoroughly convinced
[1:01:53] because the life that's in them has
[1:01:56] already become Christ
[1:01:59] there's the person
[1:02:01] what is the New Birth the revelation of
[1:02:04] Jesus Christ in you
[1:02:06] unveiled Christ in you
[1:02:09] identification that you're sealed to the
[1:02:12] day of your Redemption
[1:02:15] that you're faultless that you're
[1:02:17] sinless that you are found and always
[1:02:19] was in him it's your identification it's
[1:02:22] your evidence
[1:02:24] Hallelujah
[1:02:27] what did Abraham have to have the Seal
[1:02:30] of circumcision as a sign a token
[1:02:33] that his faith was received it was
[1:02:36] accepted
[1:02:39] by God
[1:02:42] amen what did God see his faith what did
[1:02:45] man see that Faith living
[1:02:49] so the faith in you moving in you is the
[1:02:53] real believer there's the believer you
[1:02:56] know we'll have to look at yourself no
[1:02:58] more you don't have to look at your
[1:02:59] ideas your failures look to Christ who's
[1:03:02] revealed in you that's the real believer
[1:03:04] you are not counted an unbeliever you
[1:03:06] are counted as a True Believer
[1:03:09] you are his seed you are his life
[1:03:14] Hallelujah
[1:03:16] Hallelujah he said he said they are
[1:03:19] thoroughly convinced because the life
[1:03:21] that's in them has already become Christ
[1:03:23] it is Christ it's no more you
[1:03:27] glory to God point that back at the
[1:03:30] Devil and tell it bring it back to the
[1:03:32] word

[1:03:36] greater is he that is in you you see
[1:03:38] it's no more you
[1:03:41] glory to God
[1:03:45] it's a revelation of who you are it's a
[1:03:48] revelation that you are an accepted True
[1:03:51] Believer
[1:03:53] Hallelujah
[1:03:55] Hallelujah
[1:03:58] he said it is Christ it's no more you
[1:04:00] but Christ that lives in you no more you
[1:04:02] but Christ that lives in you and no
[1:04:05] matter there is nothing Paul said
[1:04:07] present future death Peril nakedness
[1:04:10] whatever it is can separate us from the
[1:04:13] love of God that's in Christ
[1:04:15] you see there's a perfect satisfaction
[1:04:17] in every trial in every test that's sent
[1:04:20] to you that's come your way by God's
[1:04:22] Direction by God's leadership everything
[1:04:25] he does is perfect all that he allows
[1:04:27] you to go through is absolutely working
[1:04:29] for your good
[1:04:31] it's it's gold try it in the fire it's
[1:04:34] for your it's for you to glory in him
[1:04:36] it's for the manifestation of his
[1:04:38] character it's absolutely for you to be
[1:04:41] brought to a place where you've
[1:04:42] manifested and glorify him and live for
[1:04:45] him in this hour proving him to the
[1:04:48] world
[1:04:50] amen we are here for that purpose
[1:04:53] to live Christ to others to bring Christ
[1:04:57] to others
[1:04:59] amen
[1:05:00] we are here for that very purpose
[1:05:05] after we become his property
[1:05:08] our confession and our baptism
[1:05:12] and our promise to walk in life with him
[1:05:15] for him then every trial that comes upon
[1:05:17] us is perfect
[1:05:19] is to perfect us for his glory
[1:05:22] it's to bring us to a place where God
[1:05:24] can make himself more real to us than he
[1:05:26] was before the trial come
[1:05:29] amen
[1:05:30] and remember no matter how great the
[1:05:32] distress is Satan cannot take your life
[1:05:34] until God is finished with you
[1:05:38] and who's the real believer God in you
[1:05:41] God above us God With Us now it's God in
[1:05:43] you

[1:05:52] you there's nothing can happen to you
[1:05:54] unless God permits it there's no evil
[1:05:56] can come unless God permits it and it's
[1:05:58] for your good he's working that
[1:06:00] why does God let troubles come God
[1:06:02] harnesses trouble puts bits in his mouth
[1:06:04] makes it obey him do you see what we
[1:06:07] just read here at the very beginning he
[1:06:09] said in right living friendship with him
[1:06:11] every day not trying to live this or
[1:06:13] that but his own life living out going
[1:06:15] where he wants you to go
[1:06:17] through this trial that trial
[1:06:22] so would God lead you into trials you
[1:06:24] bet he does he loves to do so
[1:06:27] because he knows without it you'll never
[1:06:29] be in a Rapture you could never meet him
[1:06:31] in the air
[1:06:33] that's your growth that's your growing
[1:06:35] time
[1:06:36] amen but you need to keep your focus on
[1:06:38] who's the believer
[1:06:41] amen
[1:06:43] that's right
[1:06:44] don't turn to the right or left of that
[1:06:46] just remember that every one of those
[1:06:48] things you're going through just
[1:06:50] remember it's for your good it's for
[1:06:52] your benefit it's it's to bring you to
[1:06:54] the place where you're glorifying him
[1:06:59] hey man that's right we are here as a
[1:07:02] very manifestation of himself the
[1:07:04] complete revelation of God is who we are
[1:07:06] in this hour
[1:07:09] did you know that we are the complete
[1:07:11] Revelation Christ in you makes you the
[1:07:13] complete revelation of God in this hour
[1:07:16] of the whole thing
[1:07:20] my
[1:07:23] talk about Destiny
[1:07:26] amen
[1:07:28] you can't there's no way if God comes in
[1:07:31] and seals you that real believer and
[1:07:32] there's going to take you right into a
[1:07:34] body change
[1:07:35] it's got to he's already identified it
[1:07:37] he's already identified you've got a
[1:07:39] glorified body waiting he's already
[1:07:40] identified during you've heard from your
[1:07:42] theophany he's already identified that
[1:07:44] you the the outfit of you bypassed
[1:07:46] you've got to come to it
[1:07:48] it's already there waiting
[1:07:51] convinced of it
[1:07:53] and he's leading it perfectly to bring
[1:07:55] you to that place
[1:07:58] can you believe that can you accept that
[1:08:01] can you look beyond your own
[1:08:03] self-motives can you look beyond your
[1:08:04] own self feelings and realize who the
[1:08:07] believer is
[1:08:09] where are you identified where are you
[1:08:12] identified what does identify you
[1:08:17] amen
[1:08:20] all right
[1:08:22] see
[1:08:23] now where was I gotta go back here all
[1:08:26] right
[1:08:30] he we asked for comfort and peace God
[1:08:32] gives us the best he could give us
[1:08:33] trials and tribulations
[1:08:36] but that's part of his plan that's part
[1:08:38] of his leadership
[1:08:39] going where he wants you to go saying
[1:08:42] what he wants you to say
[1:08:44] doing what he wants you to do forget
[1:08:47] your own reasoning and figuring out that
[1:08:51] those things right there
[1:08:54] recognize who you are recognize him in
[1:08:58] you know it it's not an it's not an
[1:09:00] imagination it is an actual Revelation
[1:09:03] which is substance
[1:09:07] Hallelujah
[1:09:09] all right
[1:09:14] and he said trials and tribulations are
[1:09:16] better than comfort and peace and yet
[1:09:17] I'm talking about perfect satisfaction
[1:09:19] why because perfect satisfaction lays in
[1:09:22] the reality of the revelation of the
[1:09:25] True Believer which is Christ in you
[1:09:27] which you are
[1:09:32] hallelujah it's a person
[1:09:36] it's a leadership of eternal life

[1:09:46] amen how can you go wrong when you're
[1:09:48] meant to go right well the right is the
[1:09:51] harder way Brother David but the harder
[1:09:53] way is the way of comfort and peace
[1:09:59] it is if as long as you're in Christ
[1:10:01] forget your feelings your feelings is
[1:10:05] not your identification
[1:10:07] God's not dealing you about Ways by ways
[1:10:10] of your flesh anymore he's he's taking
[1:10:13] this body and quickening it by the Holy
[1:10:15] Ghost that's in you bringing it subject
[1:10:17] to the word then let him do it the way
[1:10:20] he wants to do it sovereignly
[1:10:23] Hallelujah
[1:10:24] Hallelujah
[1:10:27] that's right
[1:10:29] all right so
[1:10:33] see it's Christ no more you but Christ
[1:10:35] that lives in you no matter no matter
[1:10:37] and no matter there is nothing nothing
[1:10:40] future present naked whatever can
[1:10:42] separate you from the love of God's kind

[1:10:49] other Rise how many doctors of divinity
[1:10:52] can explain it away and say it's for
[1:10:54] another day and they're saying it right
[1:10:56] here in the message
[1:10:57] well that's for another day
[1:11:01] that's for another day yet to come
[1:11:04] or that's another day that was passed

[1:12:12] what is you what is the real you
[1:12:15] the faith that's in you the spirit of
[1:12:18] God that's in you that's the real you
[1:12:20] now there is the believer
[1:12:24] praise the Lord
[1:12:26] you didn't know you had that kind of
[1:12:27] belief did you
[1:12:31] who's that believer perfection
[1:12:34] who's that believer your headstone who's
[1:12:37] that believer your husband who is he
[1:12:40] where is he he's one
[1:12:42] with you
[1:12:45] talk about a union and talk about a
[1:12:47] place I'm getting ahead of myself a
[1:12:48] little bit so let's back up here a
[1:12:49] minute all right
[1:12:51] now now watch if you abide in me
[1:12:55] and my word abides in you don't lose
[1:12:57] that word abide
[1:13:00] if you abide in me and my word in you
[1:13:04] abiding in you you can ask what you will
[1:13:07] it'll be done what you will
[1:13:10] what do you have the faith
[1:13:13] what is the will his faith
[1:13:17] your confession should be the confession
[1:13:19] of faith
[1:13:22] amen
[1:13:26] now let me just say something here
[1:13:35] intellectual faith
[1:13:37] is not perfect
[1:13:44] there is an intellectual faith
[1:13:46] people do great things with intellectual
[1:13:48] Faith they can be anointed to do great
[1:13:50] things with intellectual faith do you
[1:13:52] know that
[1:13:55] but that's not perfect Faith No More
[1:13:58] Than filial Love is perfect love
[1:14:01] amen but where perfect love is perfect
[1:14:04] Faith exists with it
[1:14:06] because perfect love is God
[1:14:08] and perfect faith is God
[1:14:11] the believer are you with me but that
[1:14:14] perfect Faith Works by that love
[1:14:17] so you can you'll go back to First
[1:14:19] Corinthians 13 and you'll find without
[1:14:21] charity none of those things matter you
[1:14:23] can have a knowledge you have a
[1:14:24] knowledge of the truth you can even you
[1:14:26] can quote the messages you can even
[1:14:28] bring forth the Mysteries intellectually
[1:14:30] and be right
[1:14:32] but without the nature of that love
[1:14:34] Christ in you living you're not
[1:14:36] connected with the word
[1:14:40] boy that was a good one
[1:14:44] amen that Nature's got to be in you
[1:14:46] living that word
[1:14:48] recognizing hearing the word for your
[1:14:51] season
[1:14:53] your time
[1:14:54] your age your moment this is bright age
[1:14:59] we're gone above the layout to see you
[1:15:01] we're in the bright age we're in bright
[1:15:03] time we're in the seed time
[1:15:06] who is that Christ in you the True
[1:15:09] Believer Christ in you the new creation
[1:15:12] Christ revealed in you you are that
[1:15:15] believer
[1:15:18] amen
[1:15:20] all right now so God is the only God's
[1:15:25] faith is the only Faith that's perfect
[1:15:29] amen
[1:15:32] thank the Lord
[1:15:33] all right
[1:15:36] and if you want to find where I said
[1:15:37] Faith worketh by love that's Galatians 5
[1:15:39] 6. Galatians 2 20 said that we live by
[1:15:43] the faith of the son of God
[1:15:46] I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:15:48] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:15:51] and the life that I now live
[1:15:55] in the flesh
[1:15:57] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:16:00] his faith
[1:16:03] and if it's his faith in you working
[1:16:06] you're going to come to the realization
[1:16:07] and knowing of where you're standing Who
[1:16:10] You Are by that Faith by that spirit
[1:16:15] because he's going to lead you into all
[1:16:17] truth
[1:16:19] he's going to guide you not away from
[1:16:21] the word but into the word more and more
[1:16:25] the path of the just is as a Shining
[1:16:28] Light clear and clearer unto that
[1:16:30] perfect day what's the perfect day our
[1:16:33] meeting in the air
[1:16:35] amen that perfect realization of the
[1:16:38] faith that's in you that brings you
[1:16:40] there
[1:16:41] amen
[1:16:43] amen yes faith in you israelization but
[1:16:46] it brings you to a perfect completion
[1:16:49] amen
[1:16:51] it's always Faith first it has to be
[1:16:53] faith
[1:16:56] Hallelujah God has made that thus he
[1:16:59] even proved it between Cain and Abel it
[1:17:01] was Faith Revelation that made the
[1:17:03] difference
[1:17:05] both religious both boys seeking God
[1:17:08] both had a church but revelation of the
[1:17:11] word was the evidence that Abel was the
[1:17:13] seed of God
[1:17:16] amen
[1:17:17] amen amen talk about a perfect evidence
[1:17:20] amen all right ability to hear Brother
[1:17:24] Brown said it isn't love that's the
[1:17:25] evidence he said it's the ability to
[1:17:27] hear the word for the season for your
[1:17:30] time
[1:17:32] and what will that Faith do live the
[1:17:34] word
[1:17:36] because it's God in you living
[1:17:41] oh my what a place what a relationship
[1:17:43] what a union
[1:17:47] all right now
[1:17:49] so you see
[1:17:57] recognize your pre okay if you abide in
[1:18:00] me in my word in you ask what you will
[1:18:01] to be done then recognize your position
[1:18:04] in the scripture as a believer
[1:18:06] you've got to recognize your position as
[1:18:09] he recognized his position
[1:18:14] now you must believe what you asked for
[1:18:17] if you are a Believer recognize yourself
[1:18:19] as a Believer recognize these things are
[1:18:22] for you if there's condemnation in your
[1:18:24] life straighten that first
[1:18:27] because you can't have no confidence in
[1:18:29] what you ask for of God unless if
[1:18:31] there's condemnation
[1:18:33] all right I can do nothing in myself why
[1:18:36] he relied upon what he was see he relied
[1:18:39] knowing that he was the word that he had
[1:18:41] faith in God who made him the word amen
[1:18:43] because he understood Faith give Faith
[1:18:47] because he understood his position
[1:18:48] therefore he relied upon what God had
[1:18:50] made him he relied upon what God had
[1:18:53] made him and if he did that then can't
[1:18:56] we rely upon what God made us as
[1:18:59] believers
[1:19:01] and not has he hath
[1:19:06] it's just being manifested
[1:19:09] that you always were in him if you know
[1:19:12] where you come from then you know who
[1:19:14] you are and if you know who you are then
[1:19:17] you know where you're going
[1:19:20] amen
[1:19:21] all right
[1:19:25] if you are a Believer have faith in what
[1:19:27] you are you are a Believer and these
[1:19:30] signs shall follow them that believe he
[1:19:33] had faith in what he was
[1:19:36] amen
[1:19:38] have faith in what you are that's what
[1:19:39] God's trying to get across to this
[1:19:41] tonight is that faith that real believer
[1:19:45] in what that's who you are
[1:19:50] who identifies that who identifies
[1:19:52] Christ in you who identifies that you
[1:19:54] were in him before the foundation of the
[1:19:55] world
[1:19:56] when you catch that Revelation there's
[1:19:58] not enough devils in Hell could take you
[1:20:00] out of that because you always were
[1:20:02] you're as Eternal as he was eternal you
[1:20:05] are eternal life living in you
[1:20:09] don't look to this outside man and say
[1:20:11] well do I have eternal life or don't I
[1:20:14] know look to what God's revealed in you
[1:20:16] look at what he's made manifest in you
[1:20:19] look at himself in you then he said I'll
[1:20:22] bring this body under obedience to my
[1:20:24] word and that might lead you through
[1:20:25] trials and tests
[1:20:28] all right
[1:20:32] but do you have confidence in his he
[1:20:34] that's in you do you know he's in you do
[1:20:37] you know that that is your
[1:20:38] identification
[1:20:40] my
[1:20:42] we have a face-to-face identification
[1:20:48] all right so we don't need to live in
[1:20:50] Vertigo anymore
[1:20:54] not knowing where you are upside down
[1:20:56] right side up why is this happening why
[1:20:59] is that happening

[1:21:10] the word
[1:21:13] so we don't fly by sight do we
[1:21:18] we fly by revelation
[1:21:23] I like that I think Chris does too
[1:21:26] that's piloting
[1:21:30] he's our pilot
[1:21:32] right I got confident he says no no
[1:21:34] you're turning left you think you're
[1:21:36] turning right
[1:21:38] you think you're climbing says no you're
[1:21:40] diving
[1:21:42] you think you're right side up he says
[1:21:44] you're upside down
[1:21:46] or you think you're upside down he said
[1:21:47] no you're right side up
[1:21:51] amen hallelujah amen
[1:21:57] where's your confidence where's your
[1:21:59] identification who are you
[1:22:01] are you a True Believer
[1:22:05] than if you are you're in Christ

[1:22:11] this we're talking about a person
[1:22:14] unveiling of Jesus Christ and you the
[1:22:16] person

[1:22:21] well it could be him but it's not really
[1:22:23] him yes it is him

[1:22:28] the same word made flesh in you
[1:22:30] you come from the same source
[1:22:34] as he did

[1:23:00] but that has to be said again they are
[1:23:02] thoroughly satisfied they are thoroughly
[1:23:04] convinced it's Christ in them
[1:23:10] we have the faith of the Son of God Mark
[1:23:12] 11 22 says have faith in God the right
[1:23:15] translation on that is have the faith of
[1:23:18] God
[1:23:20] have the faith of God

[1:25:46] you won't be in a rapture
[1:25:48] because the person of Christ in you
[1:25:50] unveiled is the rapture
[1:25:53] and therefore you already have the
[1:25:55] substance of the Rapture because the
[1:25:57] Rapture is a revelation
[1:26:00] Hallelujah the Rapture is a revelation
[1:26:04] then you have Rapture already
[1:26:09] amen then you have the substance of the
[1:26:12] thing that's promised you
[1:26:14] and expected end
[1:26:17] a new body
[1:26:20] Hallelujah
[1:26:22] because you're already identified in
[1:26:24] Melchizedek
[1:26:27] Hallelujah then you can say looking
[1:26:30] Beyond the Veil this opened right up
[1:26:31] said who is this Melchizedek
[1:26:37] Hallelujah
[1:26:39] oh the other David you're getting
[1:26:41] foolish no I'm not I'm dead serious
[1:26:43] that's exactly the truth
[1:26:46] all right now
[1:26:49] verse 13 we having the same Spirit of
[1:26:52] Faith according as it is written I
[1:26:54] believed
[1:26:55] amen how many Believers we have here I
[1:26:58] believed and therefore have I spoken and
[1:27:02] therefore have I spoken
[1:27:05] we also believe and therefore speak
[1:27:09] now Romans 10 8 said what let's go over
[1:27:11] there just a minute with that scripture
[1:27:13] in mind let's go over to Romans chapter
[1:27:16] 10 verse 8.
[1:27:19] but the righteousness which is of Faith
[1:27:22] verse 6.
[1:27:24] speaketh on this wise
[1:27:26] saying you don't say in your heart who
[1:27:29] shall Ascend into heaven that is to
[1:27:31] bring Christ down from above somebody
[1:27:32] has got to go up there and bring him
[1:27:34] down
[1:27:35] somebody's got to come up there we've
[1:27:37] got to have a prophet lead us we've got
[1:27:39] to have a church we got to have an
[1:27:40] organization some we lead us to where we
[1:27:43] can go where he is
[1:27:45] bring him down here
[1:27:47] we can't have faith until he comes back
[1:27:56] I'm not making fun
[1:27:58] but that's the definite strong
[1:28:00] Spirit today
[1:28:03] amen
[1:28:05] amen now watch he said here
[1:28:09] he said who shall Ascend into heaven and
[1:28:11] bring him down from above who shall us
[1:28:13] descend into the deep that is to bring
[1:28:15] up Christ from the dead
[1:28:18] but what's saith it
[1:28:21] the righteousness of Faith what does
[1:28:23] this righteousness of Faith say
[1:28:26] the word is nigh thee
[1:28:29] even in thy mouth
[1:28:33] why why
[1:28:35] and in thy heart
[1:28:39] what is in thy heart what is in thy
[1:28:42] mouth the word of faith
[1:28:45] revelation
[1:28:47] that we preach
[1:28:50] I wish I could explain it to you
[1:28:54] but we can't explain it to anybody
[1:28:57] it's up to God to reveal it but it comes
[1:28:59] by hearing that
[1:29:01] preached
[1:29:05] by hearing the word
[1:29:07] all right
[1:29:14] okay I could go further you can read
[1:29:16] that further if you'd like but Romans 10
[1:29:18] 8 so we having the same Spirit of faith
[1:29:21] therefore we speak
[1:29:23] we believe and therefore speak
[1:29:26] all right now second Corinthians 3
[1:29:35] excuse me
[1:29:38] and those always wants to run when they
[1:29:40] preach
[1:29:46] second Corinthians 3
[1:29:50] verse 2.
[1:29:53] you are our epistle written in our
[1:29:56] hearts
[1:29:58] known and read of all men for so much as
[1:30:01] you are manifested declared to be the
[1:30:03] epistle or the written word ministered
[1:30:04] by US Written not with ink but with the
[1:30:07] spirit of the Living God not in tables
[1:30:10] of stone but in fleshly tables of the
[1:30:12] heart that's where the Prophet said
[1:30:14] we'll find where it's written
[1:30:17] although we'll find words written in the
[1:30:19] scripture too but where's it got to be
[1:30:20] written to be manifest
[1:30:22] in your heart
[1:30:24] all right
[1:30:26] he said
[1:30:29] and in and such trust have we through
[1:30:32] Christ to God's word not that we are
[1:30:35] sufficient of ourselves no human ability
[1:30:37] no see
[1:30:40] to think anything as as of ourselves but
[1:30:42] our sufficiency is of God
[1:30:45] that's our abilities of God Amen who
[1:30:48] also has made us able Ministers of the
[1:30:51] New Testament not of the letter
[1:30:54] you could have an intellectual
[1:30:55] understanding of all you want the
[1:30:57] message the letter everything but unless
[1:30:59] God can take that letter and bring it
[1:31:01] out there in Revelation and reveal to
[1:31:03] you the thought behind those words
[1:31:05] letters
[1:31:07] amen how can you be connected to that
[1:31:10] unless God's in you that would lead you
[1:31:12] into that truth
[1:31:13] there you are see see yeah you say well
[1:31:16] brother God brother Graham said a right
[1:31:18] mental attitude yes you have to receive
[1:31:20] it that way a right mental attitude or
[1:31:22] any promise will bring it to pass but
[1:31:24] when it drops down into your soul as a
[1:31:27] substance
[1:31:29] it's yours
[1:31:31] that's it settle
[1:31:33] nothing can ever move that
[1:31:36] oh Satan will try to
[1:31:38] but he can't move it
[1:31:40] because he can't enter into that which
[1:31:42] is behind the veil because if he comes
[1:31:44] he has to come through the blood so he
[1:31:46] can't get where you dwell
[1:31:48] he can't get to you your dwelling that's
[1:31:51] why no no plague shall come nigh your
[1:31:53] dwelling
[1:31:56] because your dwelling is in Christ
[1:31:58] amen amen amen
[1:32:01] amen all right
[1:32:04] now so we come down to verse 16.
[1:32:08] nevertheless
[1:32:10] oh but we're Ministers of the spirit for
[1:32:12] the letter killeth the spirit giveth
[1:32:13] life
[1:32:15] verse 16 nevertheless the Bible said the
[1:32:18] veil is upon their heart Israel as as
[1:32:21] Moses is read nevertheless when it IT
[1:32:24] the heart
[1:32:26] shall be returned shall turn to the Lord
[1:32:29] the veil shall be taken away
[1:32:33] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[1:32:36] the spirit of the Lord is
[1:32:38] there's liberty
[1:32:41] amen
[1:32:42] not anguish not droopy lip disease no
[1:32:46] complaining and murmuring and
[1:32:50] I know the flesh does that
[1:32:52] but we are commanded to keep it under
[1:32:54] subjection and the more this unveils to
[1:32:57] us that who we are we grow into that
[1:32:59] manifestation we grow into that headship
[1:33:01] we grow into that Capstone Revelation
[1:33:03] that's perfection
[1:33:06] you can't go any higher than the
[1:33:08] Capstone that Capstone is our perfecting
[1:33:11] we grow up into him
[1:33:15] amen it's not growing up perfecting this
[1:33:17] it's growing up into him
[1:33:20] that's the maturity that's the
[1:33:22] Perfection he was speaking about
[1:33:25] amen so let us go on to Perfection not
[1:33:28] stay in the baby stage let's go on feed
[1:33:31] on the word and be fed upon the open
[1:33:33] book and feed on the open book
[1:33:36] amen and grow into that stature of
[1:33:39] himself because this ministry this
[1:33:42] message this opening of these seals this
[1:33:46] message of the seventh angel is the
[1:33:49] Capstone message
[1:33:53] it's The Headstone message and brother
[1:33:54] Branham said the head and the body has
[1:33:58] look at how he's projecting watch how he
[1:34:00] he already sees that already a finished
[1:34:02] work he said has become one unit
[1:34:07] and this is an individual affair
[1:34:09] but he saw that body perfect
[1:34:13] has the heads been uncovered the head's
[1:34:16] been revealed from heaven and now he's
[1:34:18] uniting with his bride and they are
[1:34:21] becoming one four
[1:34:24] the Celebration The Wedding supper
[1:34:28] of a marriage a union amen
[1:34:32] amen
[1:34:33] all right
[1:34:35] now
[1:34:38] so we see verse 17 Liberty where the
[1:34:41] spirit of the Lord is there's liberty
[1:34:43] but we all with open face not veiled
[1:34:45] face an open face
[1:34:48] the seventh Seal's been opened that
[1:34:51] which is perfect is come
[1:34:54] amen
[1:34:57] and not looking through a veil anymore
[1:34:58] we're not looking at this Darkly we are
[1:35:01] looking at this face to face
[1:35:04] this is what changes us from glory to
[1:35:07] glory we are being changed
[1:35:10] amen
[1:35:12] we see as he sees us this is what the
[1:35:16] opening is to us
[1:35:18] is to realize he's here
[1:35:21] in Bride form
[1:35:25] who is it the revealing of the son of
[1:35:28] man
[1:35:32] at your position
[1:35:34] amen hallelujah all right
[1:35:38] verse 18.
[1:35:40] but we all with open face beholding is
[1:35:42] in a glass a mirror the glory of the
[1:35:44] Lord are changed
[1:35:48] raptured change what a resurrection that
[1:35:51] was and what a resurrection this is
[1:35:56] amen what a resurrection that was and
[1:36:00] what a resurrection this is to come out
[1:36:02] of Darkness into the manifestation of
[1:36:05] light
[1:36:06] God is light that's the message God is
[1:36:09] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:36:13] and if you walk in the light as he is in
[1:36:15] the light
[1:36:17] you have fellowship with him and if you
[1:36:19] have fellowship with him every member of
[1:36:21] the body is himself
[1:36:26] amen
[1:36:27] so you see where our fellowship is is
[1:36:30] under the blood
[1:36:32] is in the light
[1:36:34] and if we're not walking in the light
[1:36:36] it's not you're not under the blood
[1:36:39] well that's a good one
[1:36:43] if we walk in the light then the blood
[1:36:45] of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[1:36:48] amen
[1:36:50] amen all right now
[1:36:53] then the glory of the Lord we are
[1:36:55] changed
[1:36:57] we are faced open face beholding is the
[1:37:01] glass the glory of the Lord what is the
[1:37:03] glory of the Lord his wife
[1:37:05] his own Glory
[1:37:07] he did not would not share that with
[1:37:09] another
[1:37:10] but he will share it with himself
[1:37:14] did you know that the Bible said he
[1:37:16] won't share his glory with another but
[1:37:17] you are not another
[1:37:22] that's exactly right you go back to
[1:37:24] Isaiah 60 and see if the light the light
[1:37:26] is upon you bride and the glory of the
[1:37:28] Lord is seen upon you
[1:37:31] amen

[1:37:38] speaking about is your husband
[1:37:40] and the wife is the glory of the man
[1:37:45] amen
[1:37:49] it's an unveiling you see it it's an
[1:37:51] unveiling your Victory is unveiled
[1:37:55] I didn't even read I didn't even finish
[1:37:57] my scriptures while we're at this pause
[1:37:59] and I'm going to quit in just a few
[1:38:01] minutes first John
[1:38:04] let's go to first John
[1:38:10] five four
[1:38:15] let's look at this very familiar
[1:38:17] scripture
[1:38:18] for whatsoever is born of God
[1:38:23] overcometh
[1:38:24] the world
[1:38:27] overcometh the world's system
[1:38:32] overcometh the world
[1:38:34] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:38:37] the world even
[1:38:40] the Revelation that we are the Believers
[1:38:45] even our faith
[1:38:48] amen is that right even our faith
[1:38:54] that's right our Revelation what is it
[1:38:57] the revelation of Christ in you
[1:39:00] the new creation is a person Christ in
[1:39:03] you
[1:39:05] don't keep him back there in the manger
[1:39:09] he's your head
[1:39:12] amen
[1:39:13] amen yeah he's birthed in a Manger all
[1:39:15] right the brother sang about it tonight
[1:39:18] amen he's birthed in you isn't he the
[1:39:21] holy spirit overshadows that seed and
[1:39:23] brings himself to life it's an unveiling
[1:39:25] of Christ in you that's your victory
[1:39:28] that's the victory that overcometh the
[1:39:31] world
[1:39:33] and who is it it's Jesus Christ
[1:39:36] our Revelation is Jesus Christ
[1:39:40] all right
[1:39:43] so then
[1:39:46] let's go back to Second Corinthians 3
[1:39:48] again
[1:39:49] so then we are changed into the same
[1:39:52] image from glory to glory
[1:39:54] even is by the spirit of the Lord
[1:39:56] because we look into the glass we see a
[1:39:58] person and that person that open face
[1:40:01] that person is Jesus Christ and we
[1:40:03] realize mama
[1:40:04] Daddy
[1:40:05] father
[1:40:07] that's me
[1:40:10] okay therefore
[1:40:12] and that's a direct quote by brother
[1:40:14] Brandon he said you look into that glass
[1:40:15] and you see that Glory he said that's
[1:40:17] you
[1:40:19] that's what he said
[1:40:20] amen all right he said you're seeing
[1:40:23] yourself
[1:40:24] all right therefore seeing we have this
[1:40:27] ministry we have this message we are the
[1:40:30] message
[1:40:32] we are the manifestation of eternal life
[1:40:35] we are his eternal possession we are his
[1:40:39] kingdom
[1:40:40] our headship is a kingdom
[1:40:44] and the kingdom of God is within you
[1:40:48] we don't belong to a denomination we
[1:40:51] belong to a kingdom
[1:40:53] the kingdom of God is within you amen
[1:40:58] and the kingdom of God is the word of
[1:41:00] God made spirit and life in your own
[1:41:03] life bringing to pass every promise in
[1:41:06] this day as it did in that day when the
[1:41:09] word in God Was Won and the word and God
[1:41:11] is one in his bride today making it the
[1:41:14] headship of the body that is redeemed to
[1:41:18] bring the message in the last day so
[1:41:21] where's the final voice
[1:41:24] you are the final voice
[1:41:27] under her messenger the bride becomes
[1:41:30] the final voice
[1:41:32] to the final age
[1:41:34] who's the people hearing from today
[1:41:36] he that knoweth God heareth us because
[1:41:39] why you are of God
[1:41:41] and have overcome them because greater
[1:41:44] is he a person he and a person that's in
[1:41:48] you than he that's in the world
[1:41:51] then he
[1:41:54] that he and you has overcome your enemy
[1:41:58] amen are you with me has overcome your
[1:42:02] enemy
[1:42:05] This Old Man
[1:42:09] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:42:12] that is in the world
[1:42:16] this body is not born again
[1:42:22] amen are you with me but
[1:42:25] it will come to a change
[1:42:28] it has to
[1:42:32] because the god that
[1:42:35] put himself in you
[1:42:37] will change it
[1:42:41] you have a glorified body waiting so you
[1:42:43] don't have to look at this anymore look
[1:42:45] Beyond the Veil look beyond your senses
[1:42:47] look beyond the camp look beyond your
[1:42:51] feelings look Beyond and see eternal
[1:42:53] life
[1:42:54] see the real believer
[1:42:56] okay it's about ready to close this off
[1:43:00] Galatians 5 1 says this
[1:43:04] Stand Fast in the Liberty wherewith
[1:43:07] Christ hath made us free
[1:43:11] and be not entangled again with the Yoke
[1:43:14] of bondage steadfast in the Liberty what
[1:43:17] is the Liberty where the Liberty is the
[1:43:19] spirit of the Lord is
[1:43:21] Stand Fast in your Liberty of the
[1:43:24] revelation of Who You Are

[1:43:31] you fear man then you've got confidence
[1:43:33] in man if you fear man you're gonna
[1:43:35] you're gonna serve and believe who you

[1:49:47] greater it's Christ then it's not you
[1:49:49] anymore living it's him living in you
