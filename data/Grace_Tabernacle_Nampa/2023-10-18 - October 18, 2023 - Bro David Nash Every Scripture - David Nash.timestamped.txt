[38:12] uh it's glad to see all your smiling
[38:15] faces brother Paul make sure thank him
[38:17] for us being here tonight we're we seem
[38:21] to be traveling a lot even when we're at
[38:24] home we uh and then between some of the
[38:27] things my wife's been quite sick quite
[38:29] ill looks like here we were are with the
[38:32] electronics again here's my electronics
[38:34] expert back
[38:36] there
[38:42] and is that okay is that better better
[38:46] worse okay how's that so but she's been
[38:51] really sick do remember her she was
[38:53] pretty much over something and then they
[38:55] didn't quite get all the infection gone
[38:57] so she was wanting to be here tonight
[38:59] but not sure she was just up for sitting
[39:03] I think she slept the whole afternoon so
[39:05] praise the Lord she's getting better and
[39:07] for me now if I stop and look at you
[39:09] funny it's uh since I saw you last we uh
[39:13] had new lenses put in these here
[39:15] eyeballs and it's kind of like wow look
[39:18] at all the
[39:22] colors and wow it's bright in here I
[39:25] almost need my son
[39:27] glasses and uh so and but we're happy
[39:31] the because the the the other physician
[39:34] man that we go to for the eyes when he
[39:36] tested us he asked us to uh you know
[39:40] read the they put the chart thing up
[39:42] there and they got you in that machine
[39:43] and they tell you you know read the
[39:45] furthest line down and well I started
[39:47] picking letters out of the bottom line
[39:49] and he said you missed one out of
[39:52] whatever it was eight or 10 and he said
[39:55] do you know he kept saying using the
[39:57] word amazing and I said why do you keep
[40:00] saying that he said well because usually
[40:03] it takes about six weeks before people
[40:05] can see the top
[40:06] line so the Lord has done a very nice
[40:10] work and it's wow it's nice to see
[40:13] you I thought I thought the world would
[40:16] everything had turned brown and yellow
[40:17] and it really hasn't so not to keep you
[40:21] standing I I had uh Isa said you can
[40:25] bring it up on the word let's turn uh to
[40:28] Second Timothy the 3r chapter and we'll
[40:32] start about the 16th
[40:35] verse and then we'll get you seated
[40:38] here been studying a lot of things at
[40:42] with the little group there in Tri
[40:44] Cities and they would send their
[40:46] greetings to you tonight and uh say a
[40:51] healthy God bless you and I know Jose
[40:53] would like to get back over this way
[40:55] sometime not too distant
[40:58] future so uh 2
[41:01] Timothy 3 and verse
[41:07] 16 uh all scripture is given by
[41:10] inspiration of God and it's profitable
[41:14] for
[41:15] Doctrine uh for Doctrine for reproof for
[41:20] correction or instruction in
[41:22] righteousness that the man of God might
[41:25] be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[41:28] good
[41:29] works and then let's turn to Psalms
[41:40] 51 very familiar scripture we have the
[41:44] song that we sing out of these
[41:55] verses and it reads uh we'll start with
[41:58] verse uh n is what I have written here
[42:03] uh hide thy face from my sins and blot
[42:06] out all mine iniquities create in me a
[42:09] clean heart oh God and renew a right
[42:11] Spirit Within Me cast me not away from
[42:15] thy presence and take not thy Holy
[42:17] Spirit from
[42:19] me restore unto me the joy of thy
[42:22] salvation uphold me with thy free spirit
[42:25] then will I teach transgressors thy ways
[42:28] and sinners shall be converted unto
[42:32] thee and I'm going to read one more
[42:35] hopefully we'll get this far and it's
[42:37] from job and again it's a familiar
[42:39] scripture I'm sure to most of
[42:41] us uh and it's where job has been going
[42:45] through the trials and the struggles and
[42:49] all the things that job went through
[42:51] and uh wow when anytime I think I'm
[42:56] having trouble and struggles go back and
[42:58] read the book of
[43:01] job because it's
[43:04] uh kind of a tough spot there in life
[43:07] for him except for I didn't even somehow
[43:11] I'm missing it here what did I do with
[43:14] it oh there we go
[43:17] okay got stuck behind Nehemiah
[43:23] there I know it's right ahead of Psalms
[43:25] okay okay and this was again a for
[43:28] familiar verse it's in chapter
[43:32] 19 praise the
[43:35] Lord and this is where job after he's
[43:38] been going through all these struggles
[43:40] and he turns to his friends and uh
[43:44] starting there in verse uh 22 he says
[43:48] why do you persecute me as God and are
[43:51] not satisfied with my flesh oh that my
[43:54] words were now written oh that they were
[43:56] printed in a book that they were Graven
[43:58] with an iron pen and led in the rock
[44:01] forever for I know that my redeemer
[44:04] liveth and he shall stand at the latter
[44:06] day upon the Earth and though the after
[44:09] the skin worms destroy this body yet in
[44:11] my flesh shall
[44:14] I shall see God and we could keep going
[44:17] it's so beautiful gracious Heavenly
[44:20] Father we've read a great portion of
[44:22] your scripture this evening and what I'm
[44:25] asking father is that you would bring
[44:27] something that would draw these people
[44:30] closer to you that would refill their
[44:33] lives with a desire with a hope with a
[44:35] cause with a with a Faith Lord the faith
[44:38] of Jesus Christ for thou art the word
[44:42] Lord and faith comes by hearing the word
[44:45] so let the Word of Life Jesus Christ
[44:48] come forth the evening and fill the
[44:51] hearts of your people we ask in Jesus
[44:53] Christ's name amen please be
[44:58] seated as we looked at these things and
[45:02] been looking at them for a while uh
[45:06] different
[45:08] things there in Timothy we'll start back
[45:11] where we started there in
[45:13] Timothy
[45:15] because it gives us a real
[45:18] insight to the scripture gives us
[45:20] something that we can understand I know
[45:22] brother brandham I was looking it up
[45:25] today and uh
[45:26] uh he said that
[45:29] uh oh back in
[45:32] 1957 there was a message that he was
[45:35] preaching where he said that every
[45:37] prophecy he used the word prophecy there
[45:39] instead of scripture but he said every
[45:41] prophecy has compound meaning we know
[45:44] that every scripture is essentially a
[45:47] prophecy or a a coming forth an
[45:49] inspiration from the Lord and it has
[45:51] compound meaning and then again in 1965
[45:55] he said said that history always repeats
[45:58] itself yeah and he said that every
[46:01] scripture or or in scripture has
[46:03] compound meaning and this time he adds
[46:05] another word compound meaning and
[46:07] compound
[46:10] Revelation so as we begin to look at
[46:12] scripture we think of it and and one of
[46:15] the words there if we were to look at
[46:17] the definition when it uses uh
[46:21] inspiration I believe it is it's that
[46:23] word that it's uh
[46:27] the well let me I better go back I want
[46:29] to get this right because
[46:31] it what it said it calls it that it's
[46:37] uh I'm not going to get the word right
[46:39] yet here are we lord Jesus if you want
[46:41] to go a different way take me
[46:44] now okay but it's what it actually is it
[46:48] means that when it comes forth it has
[46:52] stacked meanings it's like it's as in
[46:55] there's a floor underneath this carpet
[46:57] well the carpet superimposition there it
[46:59] is it's
[47:00] superimposed and okay so on top of the
[47:03] floor is this
[47:05] carpet and it has a time and a place
[47:07] where it's being used and on top of the
[47:10] carpet we have what we call a Pulpit so
[47:14] it's superimposed upon the carpet which
[47:16] is superimposed upon the floor then we
[47:20] have on top of that we have tonight we
[47:23] have a Bible That's superimposed closed
[47:26] up on top of the pulpit that's on top of
[47:28] the carpet that's on top of the you
[47:30] understand but then there's something
[47:32] even beyond that because part of this
[47:35] superimposition is tonight there is a
[47:38] breath of life that is bringing a life
[47:43] that's superimposed in this word to
[47:47] you and the scripture is in the same
[47:51] form it's has superimpositions of things
[47:55] that can be be and it says time and
[47:57] space when you look up that word and so
[48:00] it's you know there's a time and a space
[48:02] that the carpet wasn't there but now
[48:05] it's there and now it's being used and
[48:07] there's a time and a place when the
[48:09] pulpits used but there's times when it's
[48:11] not used and there's times when we
[48:13] should be in this a
[48:15] lot where it's being used but the real
[48:18] thing behind it is the life or the
[48:21] Breath of God which is part of that
[48:23] where it says all scripture is by
[48:25] inspiration
[48:27] that word let's look at it because the
[48:29] word scripture there actually means to
[48:31] write or to grave or engrave to describe
[48:37] and
[48:39] inscribe or to document
[48:43] something so in other words there's
[48:45] something you know there's something
[48:47] happening tonight going on here and that
[48:49] we have all these superimpositions going
[48:51] on and yet behind that there's somebody
[48:55] back there probably got a recorder going
[48:57] that's documenting this service and even
[49:01] beyond that there is a God in heaven
[49:03] that's
[49:04] documenting every
[49:07] thought everything that's in our hearts
[49:09] everything that's in our mind he knows
[49:12] it all and it's all being
[49:15] documented in a word
[49:17] somewhere because he said he
[49:20] documents these things by his
[49:23] word but there's a couple things that
[49:26] aren't being documented or written
[49:28] tonight and that's your
[49:30] sin the Lord if it's conf if it's been
[49:34] confessed he said blessed is the man to
[49:37] whom God imputes not iniquity or or
[49:40] sin because it's also been documented
[49:44] that he said once it's confessed he
[49:46] drops it into the sea of God's
[49:50] forgetfulness and it's no longer
[49:52] remembered it's as though it never
[49:54] happened the example of course I think
[49:57] we might have said this before but
[49:59] brother brand said you take the uh the
[50:02] the eye dropper and you put all your sin
[50:04] in there and boy it looks terrible and
[50:06] he said there's a big tub of bleach and
[50:07] when you drop that sin into that bleach
[50:10] he said that bleach is so
[50:13] powerful that it breaks down the
[50:16] elements of that ink he said use ink and
[50:20] if if it breaks he said it breaks down
[50:22] the elements to to it's as though it
[50:25] never
[50:28] existed that's the blood of Jesus
[50:31] Christ it makes it so your sin my sin
[50:36] our iniquities never
[50:40] existed and even God can't see something
[50:44] that never
[50:48] existed compound meaning compound
[50:53] Revelation and so there in the well we
[50:56] better get into this says all scripture
[50:59] and and that's what it means and it's
[51:01] also uses the word holy RIT it can be
[51:03] written it can be Graven we realize that
[51:06] we read there from job and it said oh
[51:08] that my words were Graven with an iron
[51:11] pen hopefully Lord will bring us back to
[51:14] that but also in the Old Testament I
[51:17] think believe it's Levi Leviticus 7 when
[51:19] it talks about the high priest and the
[51:22] at the ending of the sacrifice and he's
[51:25] G he's changed His Garment he's gone out
[51:27] he's dumped the ashes he goes back into
[51:30] the sanctuary and as he leaves the
[51:32] sanctuary the Bible said that the skin
[51:34] from the
[51:37] sacrifice that the high priest made that
[51:40] be becomes
[51:41] his the rest of the sacrifice belong to
[51:45] the people because it's separated it's
[51:48] cut and it's all done with all those
[51:50] things and it's and it's cooked and it's
[51:52] all dispersed among the people but the
[51:54] last thing when he leaves the
[51:57] sanctuary he picks up the skin it
[51:59] belongs to him I think it's I believe
[52:03] Leviticus 7 around verse 8 somewhere in
[52:05] there it said the skin belongs to the
[52:08] high priest and so we we look at
[52:11] that and it's kind of like the carpet
[52:14] that was it's there I can kind
[52:18] of all these things with that carpet
[52:22] but that's just the beginning
[52:26] of what's actually there because we
[52:28] realize that Jesus Christ is the high
[52:31] priest of our
[52:34] confession and it's the high priest that
[52:37] makes the sacrifice and it was called
[52:40] there in that same passage there in
[52:42] Leviticus 7 It's the Most Holy
[52:46] sacrifice who's the most
[52:48] holy Jesus Christ he's the most
[52:53] holy he's the sacrifice itself the lamb
[52:58] he's not just that but he's also the the
[53:03] dividing of the
[53:05] portion he's
[53:08] also the skin in which the high priest
[53:12] takes was when Christ had gone through
[53:16] this sacrifice so he's the high priest
[53:18] he's the lamb he's the dividing of the
[53:20] portion he said this is my body it's
[53:22] broken for you here eat so he's the
[53:25] broken portion of the body and he's
[53:29] also the high priest that goes out
[53:32] Beyond The Sanctuary he's also what's
[53:35] left of the sacrifice in those ashes
[53:38] that's why job went to the ash Heap it
[53:41] was all he had to
[53:43] show Satan took everything he had took
[53:46] his family took his ox and took his
[53:48] sheep took everything everything
[53:51] everything and so when and then smote
[53:54] his body and the only only thing he had
[53:55] left was where did he go he went to the
[53:58] ash Heap because that's the only thing
[54:00] he
[54:01] had that he could sit there and say I
[54:05] know I did what God commanded me to
[54:09] do and so he sat on the ash Heap because
[54:13] that was all he had left of his
[54:18] sacrifice and so when the high priest
[54:20] they go and they get when they pick up
[54:23] that skin what did they use the skin for
[54:25] do you ever think about
[54:27] it in the Old Testament before they had
[54:31] books like we have in these days and
[54:34] printed with
[54:36] lead they had little tools and the
[54:40] priests would take and they would have
[54:41] their portions of the words and they
[54:43] would literally chisel the word of God
[54:46] into those skins and then roll them into
[54:53] Scrolls so it was the the word of God
[54:56] inside the
[54:58] scroll written by the high
[55:03] priest do you understand amen it's Jesus
[55:08] Christ written inside the scroll rolled
[55:12] out before
[55:16] us and so so every scripture man I only
[55:20] got to the first
[55:23] word is spoken by
[55:28] inspiration I still I can read the
[55:31] little words pretty good but with the
[55:33] different light I'm still learning how
[55:35] to use these lenses
[55:38] okay so in Timothy
[55:42] there better put that in
[55:48] line where it says that every
[55:52] scripture is written by
[56:04] inspiration whoops I had the wrong
[56:12] time
[56:18] okay please forgive me tonight I'm a
[56:20] little slow I guess all scripture is
[56:23] given by inspiration of God in that word
[56:25] inspiration it means to be divinely
[56:28] breathed upon or to to divinely breathe
[56:31] it's just to take a breath to let air
[56:34] come out from in this case it's God it's
[56:39] uh it's by the inspiration of God and
[56:43] remember also that you know not so much
[56:45] in the Greek because I think it reads
[56:47] the same direction as English but as we
[56:50] get into some of these other scriptures
[56:51] we're talking about remember that the
[56:53] Hebrew read from right to left and it'll
[56:57] become important you'll see it a few
[56:59] minutes Lord willing and so it said by
[57:01] inspiration and other words it was
[57:03] divinely breathed from God it was set
[57:08] forth and it also means to blow on
[57:12] something it also means to just a breeze
[57:15] or a wind and it also
[57:17] means if you look at it there's a
[57:20] scripture that means to breathe hard or
[57:23] to forcefully breathe but it also when
[57:27] you think about it and how this relates
[57:29] to other scriptures when it says his fan
[57:32] is in his hand so we begin to see that
[57:36] this Breath of God has an expression
[57:39] because what's behind the breath what
[57:41] does the breath represent to
[57:43] us amen thank you for everybody who said
[57:47] that because you take the life out of
[57:49] the body it's
[57:51] dead so what he's telling us that every
[57:54] script scripture has the life or the
[57:57] inspiration or the Breath of God behind
[58:00] it it has the power to breathe life when
[58:05] somebody dies what's the you know on the
[58:07] ambulance shows up or whoever's on there
[58:09] I saw a picture here A guy got
[58:11] electrocuted and it showed the picture
[58:13] of his buddy there you know giving him
[58:15] CPR right there while he's still hanging
[58:17] from the power line because he had to
[58:20] get breath into him the guy
[58:22] lived the breath of God is in these
[58:27] scriptures every
[58:30] scripture has the Breath of God behind
[58:33] it and it's superimposed it has compound
[58:36] meaning has compound revelation we you
[58:38] know back to to Leviticus 7 he's in
[58:41] every piece of that and the life of God
[58:44] is in every
[58:46] piece of that whole section of scripture
[58:50] it's all Jesus
[58:52] Christ and I was there's a place I uh I
[58:56] want to say it's in this day this
[58:57] scripture for fulfilled but I might have
[59:00] wrote that down wrong but it's uh
[59:03] brother ROM said people aren't getting
[59:05] through to
[59:06] Christ he said because if they were
[59:08] getting through to Christ they wouldn't
[59:09] be doing the things they're
[59:12] doing well but we have carpet in our
[59:18] house we have furniture on the
[59:21] carpet we can sit on the furniture with
[59:24] the life is supposed to be in you the
[59:28] person that's sitting on the furniture
[59:32] not even so much this as the life or the
[59:35] soul scripture calls it the
[59:38] nature of God should be
[59:42] living out of this book into what we
[59:46] call the Bride of Jesus
[59:49] Christ it's
[59:51] superimposed within us is the life of
[59:55] Christ through the air we breathe
[59:58] through the air he breathed into us by
[1:00:01] way of the
[1:00:04] scripture and he so it it continues
[1:00:06] there and it says the first thing it
[1:00:08] mentions is Doctrine and I thought this
[1:00:11] was really interesting because when I
[1:00:12] look this up it means to learn to
[1:00:15] teach but what it actually brings into
[1:00:18] it is the next word that it used in the
[1:00:20] definition is the
[1:00:23] instructor so it's not just when we
[1:00:26] think of
[1:00:27] Doctrine it's not
[1:00:29] just like a story or uh uh of something
[1:00:34] that we believe well women shouldn't
[1:00:37] wear
[1:00:39] pants that's just we call it Rema or
[1:00:43] written
[1:00:44] word there should be a life behind the
[1:00:48] woman that doesn't choose to do that
[1:00:51] that chooses to wear the
[1:00:53] dress
[1:00:55] and it's not just your life who's the
[1:01:00] instructor well when you go to the
[1:01:02] instructor what do we find there's a
[1:01:03] whole list of verses there Matthew 311
[1:01:06] Luke 7 3:17 Matthew and so on where
[1:01:10] there's all these scriptures that Jesus
[1:01:12] said I'll send you an
[1:01:16] instructor it's called the Holy
[1:01:20] Ghost so it's the
[1:01:23] personality or the soul which is the
[1:01:27] nature brother brandom called the soul
[1:01:28] the nature it's the nature behind the
[1:01:33] god that's superimposed through through
[1:01:37] this book that should be coming across
[1:01:38] this Pulpit that should be living in our
[1:01:41] lives that should be expressing Jesus
[1:01:46] Christ because it's been super imposed
[1:01:49] within us by the Breath of God by the
[1:01:52] Breath of God from out of the ELO we
[1:01:55] sang Elohim out of that self-existent
[1:01:58] one he poured his
[1:02:02] breath into
[1:02:06] Isaiah we turned our backs on him we we
[1:02:10] he was be he was beaten he was uh you
[1:02:13] know all the things that he poured his
[1:02:17] breath into Ezekiel he poured his breath
[1:02:20] into Abraham so much that Abraham's life
[1:02:24] life you know Abraham through the
[1:02:26] scripture he didn't really say a whole
[1:02:29] lot when you compare him to the other
[1:02:32] prophets there's not a whole lot that it
[1:02:34] says that Abraham
[1:02:36] said but his life was the testimony of
[1:02:41] the Breath of
[1:02:42] God the soul of God so much so that God
[1:02:48] said we are Abraham's
[1:02:52] seed the seed of Abra raam's life and if
[1:02:56] you go to Romans 4:17 I believe it is it
[1:02:58] said he called those things which are
[1:03:00] not as though they are that's the soul
[1:03:04] that's the heart that's the lifebeat the
[1:03:08] Breath of God being expressed through
[1:03:11] that
[1:03:12] man superimposed and put into a
[1:03:17] document we call the
[1:03:20] Bible but there's a life and a SW in
[1:03:24] nature that lives through that so it's
[1:03:27] not just doctrines that we believe well
[1:03:30] we believe in water baptism what we
[1:03:33] believe in oh you got to have this you
[1:03:36] got to we don't believe the Trinity we
[1:03:37] all those things those are those are
[1:03:40] just
[1:03:42] outside the doctrine the foundation or
[1:03:46] the
[1:03:47] life behind it is why you get baptized
[1:03:50] or re-baptized or whatever it is it's
[1:03:54] the Breath of God speaking from his
[1:03:56] breath giving us
[1:03:59] CPR as it
[1:04:01] were because we are Bible says we're
[1:04:04] dead in
[1:04:06] Christ you are
[1:04:08] dead but our life is hid with Christ in
[1:04:12] God we are supposed to be
[1:04:15] dead not physically as we think of it
[1:04:18] because in Romans it says that you are a
[1:04:22] Living Sacrifice
[1:04:26] yeah a dead person a dead sacrifices are
[1:04:29] dead
[1:04:31] things but this dead thing is
[1:04:34] alive you are the dead thing that's
[1:04:36] alive isn't I what a paradox I love
[1:04:41] it because we're dead and our life is
[1:04:44] hid with Christ in God and it
[1:04:49] continues
[1:04:51] uh it says you know okay he it's the
[1:04:55] instructor himself a doctor a master a
[1:04:57] teacher and it's also then the What
[1:05:01] comes forth from the teacher Dr master
[1:05:04] and the next word it used there is is
[1:05:06] reproof which means it gives
[1:05:09] proof how many times do we hear in the
[1:05:13] prophet's message where he would talk
[1:05:16] about you know that and he would go into
[1:05:19] the vision and he would tell the person
[1:05:22] whatever their problem was whatever the
[1:05:24] need was and he would say that's the
[1:05:26] proof that Jesus Christ is here that's
[1:05:30] proof that he's the same yesterday today
[1:05:34] and
[1:05:35] forever and he said it's also the the
[1:05:37] conviction or the
[1:05:39] evidence it's
[1:05:41] evidence when we think about evidence
[1:05:45] well I don't know if we any of the Perry
[1:05:48] Mason fans when you were younger or
[1:05:50] older how whatever you know they always
[1:05:53] had to have even in the courts today
[1:05:55] they're supposed to have
[1:05:57] evidence that can either condone or you
[1:06:00] know or can get the person out or get
[1:06:03] the person in so it's a a sign a reproof
[1:06:07] when it talks about that's an Evidence
[1:06:09] so much so that you know that faith is
[1:06:11] the substance of things hoped for but
[1:06:15] faith is the
[1:06:17] evidence of what we can't
[1:06:20] see it's the
[1:06:22] evidence and I think you know we I was
[1:06:25] talking with a uh brother there brother
[1:06:28] in Ireland and and we were just kind of
[1:06:32] going through some things and how that I
[1:06:35] hope there's enough evidence in my life
[1:06:39] that if I was accused of being a
[1:06:40] Christian I could be
[1:06:42] convicted and not thrown
[1:06:45] out and how that we become the
[1:06:48] evidence by the life that's been
[1:06:51] breathed into
[1:06:52] US yes by the
[1:06:55] scripture and it goes on it means to
[1:06:57] confute in other words when somebody
[1:06:58] comes at you or whatever you can refute
[1:07:01] or confute say no that's not and when
[1:07:04] even when the enemy the devil whatever
[1:07:06] what you want to call you know because
[1:07:08] it can come through people it can come
[1:07:10] through Satan himself attacking the mind
[1:07:13] you have the power through this life
[1:07:16] through the
[1:07:17] scriptures to fight the devil to fight
[1:07:20] or refute whatever he's trying to lie to
[1:07:23] you out it's part of this that's part of
[1:07:26] reproof a convinc convict or
[1:07:31] convince rebuke rep reprove so forth the
[1:07:36] next word he used there was
[1:07:38] correction I loved this because it takes
[1:07:41] us into a really nice deep spot in this
[1:07:48] superimposition cuz
[1:07:49] correction in itself is a compound word
[1:07:53] says it's a compound and it means to
[1:07:56] rectify or make things right or to
[1:07:59] straighten
[1:08:01] up I don't know if I brought it with me
[1:08:05] tonight I usually I
[1:08:07] did this was a a a photograph and I I
[1:08:10] know we've done this before and it
[1:08:12] appeared in Life Magazine like
[1:08:15] this and to rectify what this photo was
[1:08:18] it takes a
[1:08:19] prophet's the it took the word of a
[1:08:22] prophet to rectify it
[1:08:24] or to turn it straight
[1:08:29] up and when we turn it straight up we
[1:08:32] know what it is it's the Supreme
[1:08:35] judge it's Jesus with the the beard he
[1:08:39] said see the beard see the eyes I know
[1:08:41] it's small for you but I know yall have
[1:08:43] seen that
[1:08:45] before
[1:08:46] but it
[1:08:49] was correction he
[1:08:52] corrected the position
[1:08:55] by telling you turn it to the right how
[1:08:58] you know or turn it he said this way on
[1:09:00] the tape but to do it you have to turn
[1:09:02] it to the
[1:09:04] right and this is where it really comes
[1:09:07] in with the word superimposition of time
[1:09:10] place order
[1:09:13] distribution means to straighten up to
[1:09:16] lift up to set up or to make
[1:09:20] straight wow all of a sudden this word
[1:09:23] correction takes on a whole new
[1:09:26] superimposition because to make
[1:09:28] straight when John the Baptist was on
[1:09:31] the scene what was he doing it said to
[1:09:33] make your ways straight what was he
[1:09:37] doing he was rectifying because it also
[1:09:40] means and because it said it's a
[1:09:42] compound word there it also means
[1:09:45] to straighten up lift up set up I said
[1:09:48] that okay the reputation or repetition
[1:09:51] that's in it intensity is in it or
[1:09:56] reversal what's he talking about
[1:09:58] reversal well if we're going a certain
[1:10:00] way there's a I love it there's a song
[1:10:03] they sing in Madagascar when my daughter
[1:10:05] was with me there and they talk about
[1:10:07] going down the Garden Path and
[1:10:09] everybody's going this way and the whole
[1:10:11] church gets up and they're kind of
[1:10:12] singing and dancing this way and then
[1:10:14] they said and then God cames and we
[1:10:17] reverse well my daughter of course she
[1:10:19] doesn't understand malagasy so she's
[1:10:21] still going this way and everybody's
[1:10:23] going the other way and they spin her
[1:10:25] around but it's a reversal
[1:10:28] from what happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:10:32] that's correction God is correcting Us
[1:10:36] by
[1:10:38] repetition as we begin to put this
[1:10:40] together he's correcting by repetition
[1:10:43] because Isaiah we're seeking that rest
[1:10:46] of God yes I want to go in I'm I'm part
[1:10:49] of that perfect rest and how do we get
[1:10:52] there Isaiah said it's it's line upon
[1:10:54] line line upon line it's precept upon
[1:10:58] precept and precept upon precept here a
[1:11:01] little there a little it's a
[1:11:05] repetition of breathing that keeps you
[1:11:08] alive amen the Breath of God doesn't
[1:11:11] just come once and it's over friends
[1:11:13] it's in every day every hour every
[1:11:17] moment experience that we have with
[1:11:20] Jesus
[1:11:21] Christ it's also as
[1:11:24] a mountain lifted up above the
[1:11:27] Plains and the mountains shall be
[1:11:30] brought down and the plains shall be
[1:11:31] brought up and so it's speaking also
[1:11:35] written in that one word is the
[1:11:37] ministries of Elijah the five ministries
[1:11:41] of Elijah in one
[1:11:45] word what a God what a what a amazing
[1:11:50] the inspiration of God could breathe
[1:11:53] these things into these Scriptures it
[1:11:55] also means to tutor train discipline to
[1:11:57] be the child of a
[1:11:59] king how do we get there by
[1:12:03] repetition and by
[1:12:06] intensity
[1:12:08] wow and the next word it used there was
[1:12:11] righteousness I believe is that how it
[1:12:13] said there uh
[1:12:16] 16 for correction for instruction in
[1:12:21] righteousness instruction in in
[1:12:24] righteousness and when it gets to that
[1:12:28] word it comes from the word
[1:12:31] equal or to make equal and again all of
[1:12:34] a sudden we find this compound meaning
[1:12:37] this
[1:12:38] superimposition of line upon line line
[1:12:42] upon line and so forth because to be
[1:12:45] equal it means Equity of
[1:12:50] character equal character
[1:12:54] Equity of character Justified innocent
[1:12:59] holy just
[1:13:02] judgment to show Justice or even
[1:13:06] punishment it's all in that
[1:13:09] word he has given
[1:13:12] us that we can be to have the same
[1:13:18] character as Jesus Christ equal
[1:13:22] character
[1:13:24] because the same holy ghost that raised
[1:13:26] up or brought Jesus Christ on the scene
[1:13:28] the birth of Jesus was on this
[1:13:31] wise and the Holy Ghost had overshadowed
[1:13:34] Mary when she said how can this happen
[1:13:36] I've never known a man he said the Holy
[1:13:38] Ghost will overshadow you and you'll
[1:13:41] bring forth a
[1:13:42] son that Holy Ghost that brought forth
[1:13:45] that son the male
[1:13:48] portion of
[1:13:51] God is now his his
[1:13:54] seed the seed of Jesus Christ is now
[1:13:59] being poured out through his word
[1:14:01] through his breath through his soul
[1:14:04] through his
[1:14:06] life that he can produce other Sons and
[1:14:10] Daughters of God as it's written he's
[1:14:13] the firstborn among
[1:14:16] many
[1:14:18] Brethren it's the Holy Ghost he's
[1:14:21] producing that in you in a way of
[1:14:25] righteousness and it also means upright
[1:14:27] and hurry right back to this photo again
[1:14:29] turn the P the picture upright who's in
[1:14:34] there
[1:14:36] wow and there's people that yeah I
[1:14:39] better not go that
[1:14:41] route thank you sister
[1:14:48] for in going beyond the camp 1964 he
[1:14:52] said that
[1:14:54] he kind of gave four stages uh he said
[1:14:58] God revealed who he
[1:15:00] was he revealed by the
[1:15:03] seals how he redeemed the
[1:15:06] Earth he
[1:15:08] Redeemed by the name of Jesus
[1:15:12] Christ and the last thing he mentioned
[1:15:14] was to take the fear away from
[1:15:21] people that's how how he brings
[1:15:26] Redemption he tells us who he
[1:15:31] is reveals what his Plan of Redemption
[1:15:34] was through the seals of the
[1:15:37] church it's all by the name of Jesus
[1:15:39] Christ which the name and the word
[1:15:42] you've heard that before I'm sure on
[1:15:44] tape are the same
[1:15:46] thing so he does it by his
[1:15:48] word to take the fear out of us so we
[1:15:52] can step into the position that he has
[1:15:55] created us or is creating us to
[1:15:59] become praise the
[1:16:02] lord well we read
[1:16:06] also
[1:16:07] from so let's just take a look at maybe
[1:16:11] Psalms 51
[1:16:12] again and see how this works with
[1:16:16] everyday scriptures that we read we sing
[1:16:19] we think about I think about all the
[1:16:22] time maybe I don't know I speak for
[1:16:25] myself I guess I I'd like to believe
[1:16:27] that other people do
[1:16:32] this where he says
[1:16:35] create you he says blot out all mine
[1:16:38] iniquities well we could go instantly
[1:16:40] then to acts 3:19 where it says until
[1:16:43] the days are refreshing and your sins be
[1:16:45] blotted out but we'll skip over that
[1:16:48] because it's a whole another Direction
[1:16:51] but in verse 11 he says cast me not away
[1:16:54] from thy presence take uh or I'm sorry
[1:16:57] verse 10 create in me a clean heart oh
[1:16:59] God and renew a right Spirit within me
[1:17:01] now remember this is in
[1:17:05] Hebrew and this is written by the I
[1:17:08] believe the king of Israel they say this
[1:17:10] was the psalm that came to David after
[1:17:12] he' made the mistake with ba
[1:17:15] Sheba he says create in me a clean heart
[1:17:18] oh God and renew a right Spirit within
[1:17:21] me but if we're going to read this
[1:17:25] backwards the way the Hebrew writes it
[1:17:29] within
[1:17:30] me renew a right
[1:17:33] Spirit oh God or we could say oh God
[1:17:37] within
[1:17:38] me renew a right spirit is that yeah
[1:17:43] within
[1:17:44] me a right Spirit oh
[1:17:47] God or with the little you know the dots
[1:17:51] there oh God within me
[1:17:53] renew our right
[1:17:55] Spirit where does this come
[1:17:58] from it's not just floating around out
[1:18:01] in the
[1:18:02] universe he says within
[1:18:04] me within us is the
[1:18:08] power for God to renew a spirit right
[1:18:14] yes
[1:18:14] amen and then again oh God a clean heart
[1:18:20] create in me or in me create
[1:18:24] create a clean heart oh God created in
[1:18:28] me again in me create he's asking for
[1:18:32] the creative power of
[1:18:35] God that's within
[1:18:38] him to renew his spirit because his
[1:18:41] Spirit got kind of
[1:18:43] wacky he shouldn't have took her as far
[1:18:46] as the law was concerned and he surely
[1:18:48] shouldn't have killed her husband really
[1:18:51] Let's Get Serious
[1:18:53] no Thou shalt not kill you know the laws
[1:18:56] and things brother brandham said that
[1:18:58] when the the prophet came to him and and
[1:19:03] gave him the story of the sheep why did
[1:19:04] he give him the story of the
[1:19:06] sheep because David
[1:19:08] knew
[1:19:10] sheep he'd been a Shepherd boy and he
[1:19:13] knew how important that one sheep was
[1:19:17] because he fought a
[1:19:18] lion to go get one sheep took the Sheep
[1:19:21] I think it's out of his mouth
[1:19:24] that's a pretty important
[1:19:27] sheep fought a bear he did these things
[1:19:30] and so the prophet came to him because
[1:19:32] he knew that you know God knew that
[1:19:34] David knew sheep and he knew the value
[1:19:37] of one sheep you think you don't have
[1:19:42] value tonight the
[1:19:44] Lord if he did if David did that for one
[1:19:51] sheep and now he's saying where did it
[1:19:54] come from within me it's within me amen
[1:19:59] within me God make my spirit right
[1:20:03] again oh God
[1:20:06] create thou power of creation thou
[1:20:10] creator of heavens and
[1:20:13] earth will you not in
[1:20:16] me create a clean
[1:20:19] heart oh
[1:20:21] my do you see the implications but
[1:20:24] there's even more because we we
[1:20:28] understand this was David he got himself
[1:20:29] in trouble and all that but it's also
[1:20:32] something else if you go back to 1
[1:20:35] Samuel believe it's 16th
[1:20:40] chapter do you love him is
[1:20:44] this I'm just kind of grabbing it not
[1:20:48] that's not the right way to say it I'm
[1:20:50] just wanting to share some things with
[1:20:52] you that the Lord Lord has just been
[1:20:54] quickening to me that means so much to
[1:20:59] me at the very start when it talks about
[1:21:03] well if we could you could even go back
[1:21:04] to I believe it's Leviticus 17 something
[1:21:07] when it God tells them when you go into
[1:21:10] the land you're going to want a king but
[1:21:12] he said it'll be the king of my choosing
[1:21:15] where did they goof up well they chose
[1:21:17] their own King in Saul oh man look at
[1:21:20] him he looks pretty neat man he's bigger
[1:21:23] than everybody and no but God had told
[1:21:26] them in the law in
[1:21:28] Leviticus it'll be my choosing so God
[1:21:31] wants to choose a king
[1:21:34] here and in 16 verse1 the Lord said unto
[1:21:37] Samuel how long will you mourn after
[1:21:38] Saul seeing I have rejected
[1:21:41] him I have rejected him from reigning
[1:21:44] over
[1:21:45] Israel fill thine horn with oil and go
[1:21:48] and I will send thee to Jesse the
[1:21:49] bethleem might for I have provided me
[1:21:53] a king among his
[1:21:57] sons so who's the
[1:22:01] king who is the king that's going to
[1:22:04] live in
[1:22:10] David so then we go back to Psalms 51
[1:22:13] and what do we
[1:22:16] see well oh it's so full of types and
[1:22:20] shadows here I mean you go drop back up
[1:22:22] and it says Purge me with hup do you
[1:22:24] know what hup is you all been to
[1:22:26] Israel hup is a it's a common weed you
[1:22:31] can find it pretty much
[1:22:33] anywhere but they were told to strike
[1:22:36] the post of the door with it did you
[1:22:38] know that it's a natural antiseptic one
[1:22:41] of the strongest uh antiseptics that you
[1:22:44] can
[1:22:45] find so when he says Purge me with
[1:22:49] hisp well and then you have Jesus Christ
[1:22:51] I mean see all all these
[1:22:52] superimpositions in the
[1:22:54] scripture he's saying Purge me with it's
[1:22:57] talking about Christ because Christ is
[1:22:59] the king that's reigning in
[1:23:03] David and so here he says created me a
[1:23:07] clean heart re you know renew it right
[1:23:09] Spirit the one that's within me bring it
[1:23:12] out now by the power of
[1:23:15] creation and all of these things are are
[1:23:18] coming
[1:23:20] down and
[1:23:23] cast me not away from thy presence take
[1:23:25] not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto
[1:23:28] me and so on it's all pointing us to
[1:23:31] Jesus
[1:23:33] Christ it's all pointing us to Jesus
[1:23:38] Christ and how that he is the
[1:23:41] one that gives us the right Spirit he
[1:23:44] the God within us brother Ram said in
[1:23:47] one place pray to the god that's within
[1:23:50] you we're not to try to call him down
[1:23:53] from heaven or bring him up from the
[1:23:55] grave it says in another
[1:23:57] Psalm Because He Lives within
[1:24:00] you and so we look at that and there's
[1:24:05] another place where
[1:24:06] it talks about David and maybe we
[1:24:09] covered this before in in chapter 21 of
[1:24:13] 1
[1:24:14] Samuel remember it's God living in David
[1:24:18] that brings that and yet we look at
[1:24:21] David and we think wow now wait a minute
[1:24:23] this is their next king and he's hiding
[1:24:25] in the back of a
[1:24:28] cave from the whole Army of
[1:24:31] Israel and afraid to go out of the cave
[1:24:34] at
[1:24:36] first what is it it's a type and a
[1:24:39] shadow of Christ hiding in the
[1:24:43] grave from
[1:24:48] Israel hiding from
[1:24:50] Israel until they're time
[1:24:54] comes hiding in the
[1:24:57] Tomb God hiding in the Tomb from the
[1:25:00] armies of
[1:25:02] Israel oh my what's going on over there
[1:25:05] right
[1:25:06] now I just my warped sense of humor I
[1:25:11] just wondering when the Arabs are going
[1:25:13] to shoot a rocket and knock down that
[1:25:15] Mosque of Omar by mistake that's just my
[1:25:19] idea you know you can delete that from
[1:25:21] your
[1:25:24] but the prophet did say he thought
[1:25:26] Israel would rebuild their Temple and
[1:25:28] that thing's still in the
[1:25:31] way Israel won't knock it down but if
[1:25:33] they did hey it's out of the way now
[1:25:37] just a
[1:25:39] thought maybe it's a wish I don't
[1:25:41] [Laughter]
[1:25:42] know but so in so in 1st Samuel 21 we're
[1:25:49] familiar with this David go goes to the
[1:25:53] high priest for food who's the high
[1:25:55] priest we know it's Jesus Christ and so
[1:25:59] he goes to the high
[1:26:03] priest and the high priest says you know
[1:26:06] hey he's kind of worried at this point
[1:26:08] how come you're alone and it looks like
[1:26:11] David
[1:26:12] lies because said the king's business
[1:26:15] required haste and he well he's not
[1:26:19] talking about Saul or Saul's
[1:26:23] business the king's
[1:26:26] business required
[1:26:30] haste and so he and you know how he
[1:26:33] asked for food and they said the only
[1:26:36] food I have is that of the shoe bread
[1:26:39] and he gives it to David
[1:26:42] and that's in verse
[1:26:45] six and then when he comes
[1:26:49] down David in verse eight asks the himc
[1:26:53] that's the high priest is there not a
[1:26:55] here under thine hand a sword or a spear
[1:26:59] for I have neither brought my sword nor
[1:27:01] my weapons with me because the B he
[1:27:04] repeats it here the king's business
[1:27:06] required
[1:27:09] haste so here he is asking the high
[1:27:12] priest do you have a spear do you have a
[1:27:14] sword is there anything here that you
[1:27:18] have and the priest says the sword of
[1:27:21] Goliath the philistine
[1:27:22] whom you slew in the valley of elaw
[1:27:24] behold it is here wrapped in a cloth
[1:27:27] behind the ephod that's 1st Samuel 21:9
[1:27:29] if you want to put it up for the folks
[1:27:34] there in the valley of elaw behold it is
[1:27:37] here wrapped in a cloth behind the
[1:27:41] ephod now as we think about this and I
[1:27:44] think we might have touched on this once
[1:27:46] before again we have a superimposition
[1:27:48] because they would hang the ephod on the
[1:27:50] Altar and and behind the ephod was the
[1:27:54] Altar and but he says he he makes the
[1:27:57] statement here uh you'll find it in a
[1:28:01] cloth behind the ephod which is on the
[1:28:04] altar or and it's actually it's inside
[1:28:07] the
[1:28:08] alter he said and and it's
[1:28:12] wrapped in a cloth behind the
[1:28:16] ephod so in behind that ephod inside of
[1:28:21] that altar
[1:28:22] you have this uh sword as it
[1:28:27] were and
[1:28:34] it's it's
[1:28:37] wrapped and I'm thinking you know it was
[1:28:40] pretty sharp it was goliaths Who David
[1:28:42] took which that's another whole message
[1:28:44] going that way about Goliath and why the
[1:28:47] sword he had the sword but so he takes
[1:28:50] this sword
[1:28:52] and he has to unwrap it and we we don't
[1:28:56] know how wrapped it was but it was
[1:28:58] wrapped and when he takes that wrapped
[1:29:01] sword I'll put it back
[1:29:06] sorry it said
[1:29:08] that it's behind the epod if you will
[1:29:12] take
[1:29:13] it take it take that one there's not
[1:29:16] another one that's the only one that's
[1:29:19] here and there's none like it
[1:29:22] it and David says give it to
[1:29:28] me who's living in
[1:29:30] David God said I'll become a
[1:29:34] king you know it says in the Book of
[1:29:36] Romans the seed of David were brought
[1:29:39] forth after the seed Christ was brought
[1:29:41] forth after the seed of
[1:29:43] David so David's
[1:29:47] life is a seed of God becoming
[1:29:52] King and we find it
[1:29:55] wrapped in a swaddling cloth behind the
[1:29:59] altar we know that David was from
[1:30:01] Bethlehem and we go to Luke the 2
[1:30:04] chapter and
[1:30:08] watch the heart because the sword is
[1:30:11] also represents the heart it was in it
[1:30:14] was behind what the ephod what did the
[1:30:16] ephod represent it was the Judgment
[1:30:19] seat because when a prophet he came
[1:30:22] forth on that ephod were those
[1:30:25] stones the uran Thum were there and when
[1:30:28] they would speak their prophecy if the
[1:30:30] lights didn't line up they killed that
[1:30:34] guy and behind that judgment seat was a
[1:30:40] sword and that sword was wrapped and in
[1:30:43] Luke the 2
[1:30:46] chapter we
[1:30:48] find a wrapped
[1:30:50] sword again
[1:30:54] For unto you is born this
[1:30:57] day well I'll I better jump up one be
[1:31:00] and the angel said unto them fear not
[1:31:03] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[1:31:04] great joy which shall be to all people
[1:31:07] for unto you is Born This Day in the
[1:31:09] city of David a savior which is Christ
[1:31:12] the lord if you go back to two and verse
[1:31:15] 4 it tells us that that uh city of David
[1:31:18] is
[1:31:19] Bethlehem so we find in he said and this
[1:31:22] shall be a sign under you you shall find
[1:31:24] a babe wrapped in swaddling
[1:31:27] cloths lying in a
[1:31:30] Manger where is it
[1:31:33] found it's found in the house of God's
[1:31:37] bread God's in the house of God's bread
[1:31:42] you're going to find a
[1:31:44] sign of a
[1:31:46] babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and
[1:31:49] the word of God is called the the
[1:31:52] sword the word of God Hebrews 4 I think
[1:31:56] it's 12 if I remember
[1:31:59] right for the word of God is sharper
[1:32:03] than a two-edged sword and it cuts from
[1:32:05] the the marrow from the joints first
[1:32:09] level not just natural Doctrine but it
[1:32:13] goes then it goes into the realm of the
[1:32:15] spirit and then it goes into the realm
[1:32:17] of the S of the Soul and behind the soil
[1:32:23] is a
[1:32:24] life that's
[1:32:26] manifested by the Breath of God because
[1:32:30] every scripture is given to us under
[1:32:34] inspiration of
[1:32:38] God and you shall find and what David
[1:32:41] got and David says give it to
[1:32:46] me it's God in
[1:32:49] David showing himself how he gets to be
[1:32:52] the
[1:32:52] king he comes wrapped in a cloth the
[1:32:57] word has been bound in a
[1:33:00] cloth and now it's released and there's
[1:33:04] your sign
[1:33:09] Shepherds I hope you
[1:33:12] understand Jesus Christ is in every
[1:33:15] scripture
[1:33:17] somehow some way and brother brand said
[1:33:20] after the seals of you don't see it go
[1:33:23] back and read
[1:33:25] it I liked what brother Stan said it's
[1:33:27] like the old Indian you know Indian walk
[1:33:30] them once look them nine
[1:33:33] times well that's how it is with God so
[1:33:36] we understand that it it's a prophecy of
[1:33:39] God be taking his position as the word
[1:33:43] of God but in the beginning was the word
[1:33:46] word was with God I know you're familiar
[1:33:49] with that and the word became flesh
[1:33:52] the life behind the sword the word was
[1:33:56] made flesh and found wrapped in a
[1:33:59] swaddling
[1:34:00] cloth let's close Job chapter
[1:34:04] 19 this thrilled my soul when I saw this
[1:34:09] I praise the Lord because I've read this
[1:34:13] probably a few hund maybe a hundred
[1:34:15] times maybe more probably more over all
[1:34:17] the
[1:34:20] years
[1:34:22] Job chapter
[1:34:24] 19 and we know that job automatically is
[1:34:28] becomes a type in a shadow of Christ
[1:34:30] because of the things he went through
[1:34:33] and such and
[1:34:37] uh how that at some point there he comes
[1:34:40] down to verse 22 and he's asking his
[1:34:42] friends why do you persecute me as God
[1:34:45] are you not satisfied with my flesh can
[1:34:48] you imagine Jesus hanging on Calvary
[1:34:53] and here they are continuing to
[1:34:56] persecute
[1:34:59] him they're smiting that rock that Moses
[1:35:04] smote with their spear with their and so
[1:35:06] on and so he said you know aren't you
[1:35:09] satisfied with what I look
[1:35:11] like because they couldn't even remember
[1:35:13] the guys when the when his friends first
[1:35:15] came they couldn't even recognize him
[1:35:17] and they stood a far off and they're
[1:35:18] going man is that
[1:35:20] job I I I can't even imagine what the
[1:35:23] guy must have looked like so he starts
[1:35:26] that then he but then he says oh that my
[1:35:28] words were were written oh that they
[1:35:29] were printed in a book well we know that
[1:35:32] when you believe a prophet you get a
[1:35:34] prophet's reward and we've talked I know
[1:35:36] we talked about this once before tonight
[1:35:38] you are the recipients of a prophet's
[1:35:42] reward because job is saying I want my
[1:35:46] words written I want them printed in a
[1:35:47] book they didn't use books back then
[1:35:49] they used them they used the Scrolls and
[1:35:53] stuff and so tonight we are the
[1:35:56] recipients we are receiving the reward
[1:35:59] of the words of a prophet
[1:36:03] yeah I heard one and I'm not worried if
[1:36:06] you don't say amen I I was telling
[1:36:09] brother Paul know maybe it was brother
[1:36:11] J.R we were talking and he said brother
[1:36:13] Sergeant told me a long time ago don't
[1:36:15] worry brother if they don't say Amen cuz
[1:36:17] he raised sheep when he was a kid sheep
[1:36:20] Never Bleed when they're feeding so
[1:36:23] don't worry about it
[1:36:26] brother so it's okay he said oh that
[1:36:29] they were printed a book but now and
[1:36:32] we've covered that before but then he
[1:36:34] with this one that they were Graven with
[1:36:37] an iron pan and lead in the rock
[1:36:40] forever remember we started back there
[1:36:42] with what was
[1:36:45] the where it talked about under
[1:36:49] inspiration and Doctrine and and how
[1:36:52] that it was an
[1:36:54] engraving an engraving and he's saying
[1:36:57] that my words were Graven with an iron
[1:37:00] pen Lord Jesus help me now well we
[1:37:05] understand what the word what iron
[1:37:08] represents because if you've ever heard
[1:37:10] uh you know Daniel 70 weeks and how that
[1:37:15] the you know there was the Beast and
[1:37:17] there was the head of gold Babylon and
[1:37:19] then there was Assyria and Egypt and
[1:37:20] going down
[1:37:21] and the legs were iron and it
[1:37:25] represented you know I think it's pag
[1:37:28] Pagan in Papa Rome so it had two
[1:37:30] manifestations and it goes down into the
[1:37:32] feet this is this part's already
[1:37:35] fulfilled I saw the pictures when I was
[1:37:38] a little kid we had one of those little
[1:37:40] little tiny televisions when a Cru jef
[1:37:43] which means uh clay beat his feet on the
[1:37:47] or his shoe on the desk at the United
[1:37:50] Nations
[1:37:51] s and Eisenhower means iron and he said
[1:37:55] we'll bury
[1:37:58] you and that was those two feet iron or
[1:38:01] the toes in such the iron and Clay it's
[1:38:05] already been fulfilled
[1:38:07] people and it's after that that the
[1:38:10] stone he without hands comes on the
[1:38:12] scene and smashes the whole thing what
[1:38:14] do you think is happening right
[1:38:16] now every word that you reive tonight do
[1:38:19] you know is destroying the rest of this
[1:38:23] world because you're Sons and Daughters
[1:38:25] of God and we have received the
[1:38:28] stone not made with hands but made by
[1:38:32] the Breath of
[1:38:35] God oh that they were Graven with an
[1:38:37] iron
[1:38:38] pen well we know Graven and what it
[1:38:41] means and it means you know like to to
[1:38:43] Chisel out it can also mean to be
[1:38:45] printed there there's different kind of
[1:38:48] things that went with it but when it
[1:38:50] comes to this word
[1:38:52] iron we know it represents
[1:38:57] Rome and we
[1:38:59] know that it was Rome that
[1:39:03] put the uh the spikes in the hands of
[1:39:07] Jesus and the feet of Jesus we know it
[1:39:10] was Rome who stuck the spear in his
[1:39:15] side and where it says iron pen the word
[1:39:17] I'll go to pen first then we'll come
[1:39:19] back it's a it's a an iron stylus with a
[1:39:23] diamond
[1:39:25] tip to write on Stone or
[1:39:28] metal to write on
[1:39:33] Stone who were they sticking those iron
[1:39:36] pegs
[1:39:37] into the Rock of Ages friends they were
[1:39:41] riding on the
[1:39:43] stone but there's another
[1:39:46] superimposition that's hidden in here do
[1:39:49] you love him tonight I I love him I
[1:39:52] just I get amazed
[1:39:56] actually yeah
[1:39:58] amazed and so it's an iron stylus with a
[1:40:02] diamond tip and we've heard brother
[1:40:04] banam talk about the diamond that's on
[1:40:06] the record
[1:40:08] player and how the diamond is such a
[1:40:11] perfect uh thing to resonate the sound
[1:40:15] or the little grooves that are on that
[1:40:19] record so that's with an iron pen which
[1:40:24] is it's a writing instrument and it also
[1:40:27] said it's a
[1:40:29] read
[1:40:31] pen that's they Ed to write on
[1:40:34] Scrolls and when they came to Jesus and
[1:40:37] ask him about John the Baptist he goes
[1:40:39] what you what' you guys go out to see a
[1:40:42] reed shaken in the
[1:40:44] wind yeah that's more we won't go there
[1:40:47] but you understand and so with an iron
[1:40:52] pen and then another it's in Hebrew as I
[1:40:57] understand it every letter has a meaning
[1:40:59] I know that every letter has a number
[1:41:02] because their alphabet is their is the
[1:41:04] same as their numeric system and we
[1:41:07] understand that because we've been told
[1:41:08] 50 represents Jubilee 13 represents the
[1:41:12] US 13th chapter Revelation so forth five
[1:41:15] represents Grace Three represents
[1:41:17] Perfection all those things will for
[1:41:20] them when you read the word there's
[1:41:23] more there's that's why so many are in
[1:41:27] compound
[1:41:29] and it comes
[1:41:33] here there's another meaning part of
[1:41:36] that word that means to scream or to sh
[1:41:38] shriek to cry out what's the last thing
[1:41:42] that our Rock Christ Jesus did before he
[1:41:47] died because he was being Graven
[1:41:51] with an iron
[1:41:53] pen but there's yet one more little
[1:41:57] thing in that word
[1:41:59] iron the actual definition is or the way
[1:42:02] I believe the way they say it is
[1:42:06] Barelle and it actually
[1:42:11] means like the house of
[1:42:15] iron and
[1:42:18] so and it also comes down and it It's
[1:42:21] Made It iron it comes from Iron Ore they
[1:42:24] made furniture with it we still make
[1:42:26] furniture they made insulant they made
[1:42:29] utensils tools of iron but also the life
[1:42:33] behind the iron is
[1:42:36] harshness strength and
[1:42:39] oppression
[1:42:42] H and that comes from another word
[1:42:44] called beer I'm probably saying this
[1:42:46] wrong they'd laugh at me
[1:42:49] beerav and it means means the
[1:42:52] leanness of the choice
[1:42:54] Olive what's the leanness mean with the
[1:42:59] olive
[1:43:00] plant it's the first fruit because it
[1:43:03] hasn't had time to get
[1:43:07] fat and the iron is an
[1:43:13] instrument that's used to pierce
[1:43:18] holes to strike the
[1:43:22] Olive and knock the seed
[1:43:25] out one word
[1:43:28] iron means it's a tool to strike the
[1:43:32] lean Olive and knock the seed out why is
[1:43:34] that important Jesus said My Flesh
[1:43:37] profits
[1:43:39] nothing and except I Lay My Life down
[1:43:43] you could not have the
[1:43:45] seed of the word in the form of the Holy
[1:43:49] Ghost because the next thing they do
[1:43:50] with that Olive is they squeeze out the
[1:43:56] oil
[1:43:59] superimposed from the
[1:44:01] iron he said I Lay My Life down so that
[1:44:05] we can have life so that the seed can be
[1:44:09] planted and bring forth
[1:44:12] again you love him I love him every word
[1:44:19] compound meaning compound
[1:44:22] Revelation Doctrine reproof
[1:44:25] correction instruction in righteousness
[1:44:29] let's
[1:44:35] stand praise the
[1:44:38] lord lord
[1:44:40] Jesus I do indeed thank you
[1:44:46] tonight I thank you because no one knows
[1:44:51] what the next breath will
[1:44:53] be the world is working hard towards
[1:44:56] blowing itself to
[1:44:58] bits the LGB whatever people are working
[1:45:02] hard to find to see this nation burned
[1:45:04] because the seventh Vision was and is
[1:45:07] coming to pass as it was in the days of
[1:45:10] Sodom which was
[1:45:13] burned we understand these things I I to
[1:45:17] a certain amount I understand them I
[1:45:19] don't understand why
[1:45:21] people would want to do
[1:45:23] that because you were so gracious to
[1:45:26] give me the
[1:45:27] seed of the word of
[1:45:30] God and tonight I believe you've given
[1:45:33] that seed to these that are gathered
[1:45:35] before us and perhaps many online I I
[1:45:37] don't I don't know but you
[1:45:41] know so we come before you tonight and
[1:45:44] and Lord anything that might have set a
[1:45:47] skew or out of out of the way I know if
[1:45:50] you can
[1:45:51] create a bleach so
[1:45:55] powerful that it the things of sin or
[1:45:58] the mistakes we make are not even never
[1:46:03] existed anything Lord tonight that's not
[1:46:06] of you that never existed then just blot
[1:46:08] it out of their minds father blot it out
[1:46:11] of this message in such a way that it's
[1:46:13] just
[1:46:14] forgotten but those things that are
[1:46:17] right of righteousness and Truth
[1:46:22] inscribe it into their softened hearts
[1:46:25] Lord their hearts are soft tonight Lord
[1:46:28] I I can feel it from
[1:46:30] here
[1:46:31] Jesus and by your power of creation

[1:50:20] about and how that here he is

[1:54:26] will be going to New Finland in uh the
[1:54:30] 1st of November I believe it is for some
[1:54:33] meetings there and as soon as I get back
[1:54:35] I promised a little lady that she's from
[1:54:39] Guana north of South America there
[1:54:42] originally but they lived in Panama when
[1:54:44] I met him and now she's getting married

[1:54:49] quick story because we we going to do
[1:54:52] her
[1:54:54] wedding she's in her 20s I suppose and
[1:54:57] she and her dad you know she's still at
[1:54:59] home and so there's some conflict and so
[1:55:04] there was you know I didn't know what
[1:55:05] was going on exactly because it's half
[1:55:07] in Spanish and her dad just turned her
[1:55:10] name is anelsa he goes anelsa you're so
[1:55:16] stubborn and she kind of walked up when
[1:55:18] before we left she pulled me aside and
[1:55:20] she said Brother David do you think I'm
[1:55:22] stubborn I looked at her and I said no
[1:55:25] sister I don't think it's stubborn I
[1:55:28] said I think it's
[1:55:30] tenacious she goes
[1:55:33] tenacious she looked at me and I said
[1:55:35] like Hannah in the temple she wasn't
[1:55:36] being stubborn to the high priest she
[1:55:39] was being tenacious because she had a
[1:55:41] desire she wanted
[1:55:43] met the prophet is she had a desire that
[1:55:47] she wanted met and so
[1:55:50] I just you know the next time I saw her
[1:55:52] I said oh it's sister
[1:55:54] tenacious and uh she likes it because
[1:55:57] she always sends me a little smiley face
[1:55:59] every time and so out of the blue here I
[1:56:02] hadn't heard from her for a while she
[1:56:03] said will you come to
