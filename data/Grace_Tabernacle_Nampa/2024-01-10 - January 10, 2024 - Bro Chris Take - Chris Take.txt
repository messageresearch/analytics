and um I don't know but I just I always feel like coming home every time I come here we have uh we've been blessed I have uh uh the opportunity to visit brother John Anders and his group up in Bellingham and we just it happens like same here with brother Paul and just click and feel like welcome to the uh group of Fellowship group of the bride of Christ and and they're very loving people and uh I mean I think that's what is being a Christian is Christlike yeah it's to show the fruits of the spirit which is Lord Jesus and uh I uh got a we had two Services there and at the end of the day brother John Andis uh um warn me to say well next time you're here you just be prepared because you want to speak for us here so um it's is a it's a privilege to to to find people that they can see things in you that you sometimes you're not able to see and in yourself you know it's as God's grace and uh we're here to do um God's will we play your part and and and uh I trust the Lord you can take what you came looking for this morning amen greetings from the group of uh Tri Cities um they brother we Cur our pths yesterday with brother Nash was driving back home and tricer and was coming this way so um we we have a a little group there that you don't know them uh and some of them don't know you but uh we part of the same team amen um I I see a new pianist here congratulations and uh uh you know it's is it's very gratifying when you see young people doing something for the Lord because they're the future I I tell my boys and say it's just uh we as old people we we try to do our part now and in the future the that your Generations are going to have to carry on so when you see young people working and doing something for the Lord is is it means a lot to to us because uh we're showing the the path that we have follow and talking about path that's as that's my thought this morning the two paths and if you so kind can you go with me to the book of uh let's start with Jeremiah 218 would you excuse me I forgot my Bible there although I might not need it cuz you're going to put a words here on the screen so but uh I still kind of feel complete by having it here here with me go to Jeremiah 21 and it reads like this unto these people thus shalt say thus said the Lord behold I said before you the way of life and the way of death he that abided in the city shall die by The Sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and and followed unto the calans that besch you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for pray for I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good said the Lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall burn it with fire now if you go go to book of Deuteronomy 8 and the lord gave me this scripture this morning the Deuteronomy 8th 88th amen but Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God for it is he that giveth the power to get wealth and he may establish his Covenant which he swore unto thy Fathers as it is this day and it shall be if thou add if do if thou do add all forget the Lord thy God and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them them I testify against you against you this day that you shall surely perish let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you this morning Lord we we can just read these lines father but you're the one who can give us the Revelation father so I ask you this morning with my humble heart father we ask you to come and speak to these people this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen um I I have uh this this thought for a little while that the Bible says the Lord presented to before us two paths or two ways and he did it to the children of Israel and and and he's doing it for us this this day so um here in this book of uh the Jeremiah it says I I I said before you the way of life and the way of death and you go to the to to the New Testament and and and the Lord Jesus says I am the truth the way and the life so here in in in in Deuteronomy it says remember the Lord your God he is the one who gives you power to be successful so uh it's plain that if you go against God you're going to find Death so but if you walk along the the will of God you're going to find life he's he's going to give you success in life and and and and I'm not talking about uh MoneyWise successful MoneyWise or or possessions here in this Earth because at the end remember we're just pilgrims here we we're we're not setting places here or palaces or Mansions nothing nothing like that we're just here because this is our time to go through this journey and we're here just to show what is inside of you which is the Lord Jesus Christ that's that's the purpose of life and and uh just looking into the into the scriptures and and in Samuel also um he if you if you don't mind let's just let's just go to Samuel a little bit there 8 1 Samuel 8 we just because for the sake of time I'm I'm I'm going to just skip some scriptures but um you can read the from chap uh chapter 8 verse first um at home but uh I'm going to focus on on on this um verse five and and said unto him behold Thou Art are old and thy Sons walk not in the ways now make us a king to judge to judge us like all the nations and you can write down this scriptures Deuteronomy 17:14 you can write it down for so you can read it at home but uh before God having these people out of Egypt eypt and and he talked to Moses and uh actually my wife showed me this scripture not long ago uh God told Moses and that's talking in Deuteronomy 17:14 that at some point ahead of time when I settled my people and the land that I promised to to give it to them they were they was going to require for a king what an awesome God we serve he knows what the people are going to ask him in the future so every time that I I I have a need every time I have a I'm going through some trial or something I know that God already has the answer for it what what what do we need to do is just drop it on his lab and leave it alone amen we we we we we we're not here to to help God to resolve your own problem because if you're going to God for help is because you can do nothing about it amen because we're not helping him in helping you but he knows what we need amen and he knows when we need it answer we've been we've been we've been praying for a for a brother in in North Carolina as one of the sisters son-in-law TR cities sister Connie for those who know her he it's been battling cancer for a little while we've been praying for him at least for two years now and last week we got a text he's cancer free amen praise the Lord praise the Lord prise the Lord see that's that's the kind of God we serve amen I mean we've been praying all this years years and now he's cancer free lordu I mean if if you don't if you don't have the answer right now that doesn't mean God is not listening to you that's right that means he's working on it you just have to let it go and and and when you if you if you have a pro a legal problem you you go hire an attorney right yeah and and and when you hire the attorney you drop your problem in that attorney's office and you walk away that's right trth you you're not next you're not there next day try hey what can do I do for you no because he's taking care of your amen problem it's the same thing with God Amen God is taking care of our problems he's taking care of our needs we just have to let go Amen Let God deal the way he does because the way he does when and his time is the best time always always work that way amen uh so the the sons of Samuel did not walk in the ways of God I mean you go back to the scripture and how many times you see the same pattern yeah what was the reason Samuel came to the scene because Eli's Sons wasn't doing wasn't they were not walking the ways of God Eli was the priest the lineage of Aaron the Levites but here the two these two Rascals these two sons that don't have no fear for God they were just eating getting fed because of the offerings people bringing the the Lambs and and all the the the sacrifices and and and you can go back and read the whole story but I'm just paraphrasing here that he he you know they have to bring the best of the best to sacrifice but what they did is taking even sometimes they take him before to go to the to the to to the sacrifice and take him outside to go to different place kill him and eat him so the people got really really frustrated because they were bringing things to the Lord but but the the Servants of God yeah right there was careless people didn't fear God you know that's that's the beauty here when you build a relationship with your God not with the pastor because every every every single one of men is going to fail you amen but God never fails you amen we are here just to do our part amen and that part is to play a role that share with you the word of God but that doesn't mean you don't have the same access I have to God that's right so the beauty of this is that you have the same access to God and you can come to him and ask and talk to him the same way I have the opportunity amen but here these people are are are bringing obviously this when the law was and and so what caused these people to draw away from God the actions of the priest amen because they say well this if if I'm bringing this with all my heart and I want to share this sacrifice with the Lord and then these people are doing the whatever they want so what is purpose of bringing my My Sacrifice that's it so they start following other gods right and again there is before you there's two ways two paths which one you going to choose this morning and and and there's not there's no difference today we still have the same opportunity we we still have the two pths before us we still have the the the the same the same God that uh told the children of Israel that that they need to follow close the Commandments of the Lord and I remember every time that I I I look at this history and then I bring it up to the this day and I remember brother says the spirits won't die they just jump from place to place so the enemy is upgrading his Arsenal to attack the children of God so he takes advantage of every single Gadget is possible for him to use to drive us away from the from God you know I had the I had the opportunity uh on on December 31st uh family member she's a um a niece and she say why you don't come with us to to to celebrate the the end of the year we have some you know every time you gather together got to be food right so she had some she did some cooking and we we spent some time there and they she's Catholic the the husband is not really into it it's just kind of I don't know it's you know because you see wrong things here you see wrong things there so the husband asked me say why why your brother is Catholic Catholic and you're not so what's the difference between you two I say well number one nothing against the Catholic people but the Catholic religion they tried to push their agenda more about the books that the pope write and and the teachings of the Pope than the Bible so that's number one he said but but your brother reads the Bible right I said yes he reads the Bible but and not only him is many even the priests read the Bible but they they more focus on the teachings from Rome so they have the Bible here and they have this other book from the the from Rome and they get they more focused and and they obey more what the book book from Rome says than the Bible so we start talking and I ended up speaking probably close to three hours there so she he was asking questions then she jumped in trying to make a PO her point and say I say the only reason I am a Christian is because I see the hand of God manifest what the Bible says that's right and he's bringing it to pass and is the same God in the people of Israel and he's the same God today so I saw the hand of God in my my son's life he healed him from from leukemia uh uh he healed me he he's been through all the way I mean the the things that I'm able to do now is because God's grace I trust in God I didn't trust in a minister a pastor or nothing I said because the first Pastor that I have in Mexico he was a mess he got kicked out and then we move on to another pastor and he was a thief so I didn't build my relationship based on what the pastors my relationship my my my commitment is with God I mean and then then the the the last Pastor that I had it was I mean it's another mess I don't trust the pastor are just because he's speaking really nice I have to go back I say I say Jesus Christ says you have to read the scriptures study the scriptures because in that's where you're going to find eternal life amen and when he says I'm I am the truth life and the way what is he telling you so everything else besides the word of God it's garbage so I don't get where he comes from even Paul said if even if an angel comes from Heaven speaking another message let it be cursed so the main thing here for us is is that your Rel relationship is built upon the word of God Amen and your commitment is with God Amen that's right because the word of God will never fail even though sometimes we feel like oh God is how forgot about me no he never amen he never will forget about his children amen that's right imagine and this was against his will but he was prepared when he told Moses they're going to ask for a king down the road why because we as people as human beings we want to look like the other ones that's the human part of us but when when when when when you born again you don't want to look like rock stars you don't want to look like the movie stars you want to look like Christ because that's the seed is planted in you and the the fruits is going to show it's going to prove the res the people what kind of person you are what kind of spirit is living inside of you I think it's in Ezekiel says I'm going to give you a new spirit brother BR says many people mistaken that that with that new spirit is the Holy Ghost but it's not that's right amen that's right the Holy Ghost comes to meet the new spirit and I told I told that man my my my family member man and and New Year's Eve I say Lord Jesus says You must be born again that's right amen if you're not born again you can even see the kingdom of God that's right amen that's right so I hope I can answer your question I say but the only way to make it to Heaven Is by being born again that's correct give your heart to the Lord that's right and let it be your lord and savior and then she says oh we we we brought up the subject of purgatory and and she said so you don't believe in patory I said no said why I said what in the Bible says about purgatory well what about the people that that that died and and and and and they're committed crimes like like my brother got killed this guy who kill the brother my brother he needs to pay I say yes but what is worse killing someone or stealing candy from a kid yeah she said well killing I said according to the Ten Commandments robbing and killing is the same sin before God that's right so you're responsible for now and I say but when you repent for all your sins everything is blotted out and that's because the sacrifice that Jesus did on the cross said no but you I said look at this the thief on the cross it was on the cross not because he was a Mr Nice Guy he did a terrible crimes the Bible doesn't specify what kind of crimes but even him said to the other guy said don't you have a little bit of respect we deserve to be here but this man is innocent so he knew that he was a sinner that's the first thing we have to do we have to recognize we need God in our hearts because as long as you don't recognize you're a sinner you always feel feel like you're a holy man a holy woman you don't need God because you're holy what where where the Holiness is coming from is not from God Amen that's right so he did the right thing he repented that's right he said Lord remember me and what did he say today so I told her I told her I say he never say you no you need to go to the Purgatory and then we talk about it then then then after that we going to have this discussion no there's not such a thing thing you reject the Lord Jesus today yeah you don't have a chance right but that's why God is telling you today that you have two ways before you amen you choose the life or you choose the death that's right amen there there is there is no in between amen amen that's God's word is not mine amen amen so you you have to understand that God is talking to you that that we have to give everything that we is impeding to have that great relationship between you and God because every anything that is between you and God is your idol it's your God that's right amen amen simple as that that's right right that's I want to share with you some quotes from brother brandham I don't know what you guys have but always made me sentimental I'm sorry about that just brother Brown says men are you can't guide yourself that's right there is two ways that's your way and God's way and when you're in your way you're out of God's way and you are forget your own way to find God's way a man cannot lead himself we always need a guide amen amen amen in Matthew 713 enter ye into the Straight Gate for white is the gate and abroad is the way that leadth to D to destruction and many there be which g go in in their at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which lead into life and few there be that find it another version says there are two paths before you you may take only one path one doorway is narrow and one door is wide go through the narrow door for the wide door leads to the Wi path and wide path is Broad the wide Brad pad is easy and the why BR easy pad has many many people on it but the white BR easy crowded PS led to death now then that narrow door leads to a narrow road that it turn that in turn leads to a life it is hard to find a road not many people can manage find I have this I have a problem brother BR say that uh the problem is that biggest enemy you can put your name on it that's it that's the truth is Jose Hernandez he's the one who gets in God's way that's right right he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shows God a way out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy that's it that guy that's it when I can get the place that he's out of the way amen then God can come over and do things that Jose Hernandez can do that's right that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of God's way but as long as we go ourselves in the way that's it amen God can do anything that's right that's right EXA imagine the children of Israel all excited because they living bondage from Egypt oh well we could imagine that all of them were excited but let me let me give you some news that all not all of them were excited about it because they were happy where they had over there but only a few people they were consecrated to God only a few people were the ones never forget the promise God told Abraham right so these people start crying out for a savior and then and and all these people become to reduce into one family and you go back and read the Bible says they were crying out for a liberator or a savior and God came on the time not at the time that people were expecting God but they were just praying about savior when they didn't know but some of them because God didn't answer the prayer at the time they were thinking they just forgot about it well maybe God forgot about us if he did he if he gave you a promise make sure that God is going to make it happen amen not on your time but it's in his time always amen that's right always that's right so here we have Hannah having problems that she couldn't have kids and she was so concerned about it but for for some other people I I I I don't believe that she was the only baren woman at that time we we see in cases nowadays a lot of women can't have babies so at that time to me is not there's no difference I can assure you that there were more than one Hannah with that problem but only one was surrendered to God that's it right see because she had a choice amen okay I can't have babies that's okay I have a loving husband I'll be happy I'm okay with it but she was not so my question is what moves Hannah to go into the broken Spirit to pour out his soul her soul out of and and give everything to God to the point where the priest the holy man supposed to know the his people he thought was she that she was drunk you know what the actions of this man caused death to many people because they were following other God gods and the father it was easier for him just to oh I don't see oh I have a perfect voice I can see I can say the same thing about my boys even though they're not perfect but we have to understand that what before God my perfection is nothing we got to meet God's standards that's it that's right and that's that's what those people should done it they had to meet God's standards to be what they to be doing the the job they were called to do so there is Hannah praying and she she she she broke her heart her soul her soul came out and in a prayer when you do that before God I challenge you if you do that to God he's going to come to you he's going to come to you I I experienced that you know I I I I I I um I got married and I came to Mexico to to get the to require my wife's visa to come into Mexico from Peru and it was taking too long so one time in a in a church in Mexico City I just pour out my spirit to God and say Lord please speed up this process it wasn't a Sunday and in a Monday she called me and says I got a call from the Mexican consulate that's God that's right so you never forget that you Ser serving a living God Amen that's right that's right we're we're we don't we don't want to be part of this other group of people that they they got a chance to know God and and and because we always living in in a fast living everything is just speed speed speed but God God is not that way that's exactly right we have to understand that we have to adjust ourselves to God's plan but we want to make to AA to a routine oh I don't have time for you today maybe I'll see you tomorrow maybe I pray tomorrow because I'm too busy always is is ourselves who have to adjust to God's plan amen amen brother Brandon says God is God has two ways of all things that's that's right and it has has two ways I'm sorry that's a right way and a wrong way and your way my way is the wrong way God's way is always the right way no matter how incorrect it seems to us that's it God's way God's ways are truth and right amen their past understanding but God works in mysterious way his wonders perform choose God choose Watch God's provided way God always makes a provided way and his we must follow it now God's made a provided way to human race to escape the uncoming Judgment in the days of Noah he made a provided way but when God makes a way man refuses to walk in it if there is a Miss then if they miss it it's not God's fault no more than it is City's fault when you run stop the light he has made a way amen has made a way today yes sir that's right some people can see it some people don't what can you do about it there's nothing we we I mean arguing with people that don't agree with your beliefs you're not going to make any changes that's right you're not you're not going to improve anything we're doing more damage than helping that's right because the moment you start arguing yeah it's it's like you're building a wall that's right between you and that person and you when you build a wall you won't able to see what's that's behind that wall that's right that's right so brother Brandon says So you you're drawing a circle getting leaving me out of the circle I'm going to make a bigger Circle cuz I want to be in that circle with you even though you don't agree with me as long as you love Jesus Christ I love Jesus Christ we just be friends and brothers because I'm not here to judge you I mean even the Lord Jesus say here say in the scriptures that I didn't come to the world to judge that's right I came to save the world that's right but but the word is the one who's going to judge we have the word of God Amen uh uh Moses had the the the law to be to judge the people but when Jesus came he gave us Grace so to be honest that was my my best end of the year that I ever had in so many years talking with these people yeah because when people ask you have to be ready to answer that's right and you know what sometimes I I I I I've experienced many times that I go to the Bible and I feel like it's coming to here or here and just going out and I don't know how many of you have S same experience but but but sometimes God's ways like we were just read God's ways are strange ways but but sometimes even though you feel like that something is getting stuck in there amen and you don't know until you're using it that's it and and and and when you're when you're in the in the spot that people ask you and then something comes out and then another thing comes out and another scripture and another quote and then you realize well it's it's not in vain that's it amen I mean because the fountain the water fountain has to have water to push to have this continuation right so the the the more you eat the word of God there is more to come out am and the more you eat it's more coming out and the word of God is endless amen so you not be able to run out until you stop eating you know last last night we had a good dinner brother Isaac thank you I uh we had a good dinner and and there is there is always something that when you're eating if it's such a good food and and you don't want it to finish because you want to enjoy the the more you can but you know that's the stomach has limitation right it's the point with no more and your mouth wants more but the stomach says no more please no more but you know what that praise God that doesn't happen with the word word of God the word of God is you can eat eat eat day and night day and night and that's Never Gonna feel like oh I can't I can't move because I got too many words of God no that's Jesus told the Devil the man shall not live bread alone amen by the word of God so even though this this flesh can hold more chicken or more steak the soul can still eat eat eat eat because God doesn't care about your flesh he cares about your spirit even though the flesh has to show what the SP what kind of spirit you have because I I heard some people saying denomination say oh God doesn't care about how you dress because I mean he cares yes but when you go to buy bananas you're not going to buy the ones that had the dots black dots on it you want the nicer ones right why why do you care about this the peel banana if what you're going to eat is the banana ins you're going to throw away the the the peeling no you have to make sure that the exterior is showing that the the the whatever is inside of you it's not rotten that's right simple as that that's right that's the we we yes sir we can be so religious and say well I don't care I mean yeah you can do whatever you want but God's ways is only one way that's right and you have to go back to God's ways let's go to First Peter 1 Peter 1 23 yes sir let's start 10 second seeing ye have purify your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit into one faint love in the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart yeah fently see you can you can call your brother say hey I love you brother it's easy to say that but do you really mean it that's it that's the difference a pure heart doesn't say from here that's right amen a pure heart feel it from here that's right 23 being born again not a not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God Amen which liveth and abideth forever amen amen St John 12 and I'm closing 44 Jesus cried and said he that believe on me believe not on me but on him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me I am come a light into the world that whosoever believe on me should not abide in darkness and if any man hear my words and believe not I judge judge him not for I come not to judge the world but to save the world he that rejected me and receive not my words had one that that judg him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day for I have not to spoken of myself but the Father which sent me he gave me Commandment that I should say and what I should speak and I know that this commandment is life Everlasting whatsoever I speak before even as the father said unto me so I speak so we are seeing here the end of our decisions you choose to believe in Christ you have life amen amen but if you reject Christ and his word we're condemned that's it plain that's right and simple that's right right Amen in Psalm 174 says I have kept kept me from the paths of the Destroyer hold me up in thy pths so my footsteps sleep not David is praying out that he wants to stay in God's paths you go back to read the scriptures and you're going to find in in in the Book of Judges many many times in chapter four 5 six is and the children of Israel fall away from God and God delivered him into the Canaanites into the amorites into the this and this and this group of peoples that he left to bring his children in order you don't want to listen my my my I mean how many times they they they they saw the hand of God fighting the wars for them but then generation after generation because they didn't have these experiences they start getting relaxed they they they live in peace for a little while and they get get into relaxed State uh State and they forgot about God's Miracles God's wonders and and what they did for the for fathers and and and and they start forgetting about being faithful to God they choosing their own path yeah and they've been so sinful so the then then God raised this Philistines or or Babylonian Kingdom and oppress the children of Israel and then they oh god you forgot about us no you forgot about God first and I and I believe in judges says and there was a generation that did not know God and the question is why that generation didn't know God because the parents didn't take the time to teach them remember what the words of God said to Joshua never depart This Book of Life from you you have to meditate day and night in it and what are we doing so the spirit is on dying what kind of spirit are you letting move into you that's exactly right before you I present it to you the way of life and the way of death amen I'm closing brother R says look even King Hezekiah when he he sent a prophet up to him God God did and said put your house in order you're going to die Hezekiah threw his face to the wall and wept barely say Lord I ask you to to consider me I walk before before you with perfect heart I want you to let me live 15 years all right God spoke to the prophet said go back and tell him I heard him and what did he do he brought thisg grace even he son mother Isaiah according to the storian says that his son was the who cut in pieces Isaiah the prophet If he if God didn't granted him 15 years that guy will never were born God's ways are strange ways if the grain of wheed doesn't die and going into Earth it doesn't bring fruit but has to die amen so we are we have to die to ourselves that's exactly right to our Free Will Amen to our own way that's right that's it and let God have his way amen amen I'm going to close with this scripture here Psalms 119 one blessed are they on the file in the way who walk in the law of the Lord blessed are the that keep his testimonies and that seeks him with the whole heart they also do not inquire iniquity do know iniquity they walk in the ways in his ways thou H has commanded us to K keep thy precepts diligently all that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect unto all thy Commandments I will praise thee with uprightness of heart when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments can you please please stand I trust the Lord that he can reveal to you the the rest of the word we can only do so much but he's always willing to to hear your voice when you come come to him and say Lord here I am I surrender to you I surrender to you and and and be done your will that was the example that Jesus placs before us that we must do God's will we must walk God's path amen because our path it doesn't have an happy ending God's ways even though sometimes looks hard sometimes is looks is very difficult to walk but it's it's part of the the that is going to make you stronger because hard times makes people stronger and easy times makes weak people yes sir those are not my words I heard from somewhere but they sound like a have a lot of Truth in it and and you can see it I mean people like us that comes from another countries that come to America to have a better life I heard many of them saying Oh I don't want my kid doesn't lack anything that I la of so I'm going to give everything they want and what they turn into a useless people you you even the parents call them and ask them for a favor they don't have time for for the parents they disrespectful children so obviously we want to our kids to have better life in us but the better life you can offer to them is to live for Christ ex like I tell the people in Tri Cities this is not living this is surviving here when we get to live is when we cross that River that's leing I remember last time I saw a sister Sergeant walking out the door brother Nash was there sister God bless you see you in two weeks and she turned she was 80 something years old she turns and say Yes Lord willing and if not I'm ready to go home a week later she was going [Music] home that's leaving amen a night before she she died she told her daughter says I had a dream that I was walking with my [Music] husband praise the [Music] Lord we're surviving here because we have to battle this flesh and we have to battle against politicians bringing up new laws that had nothing to do with the law of God that's right kicking out Jesus out of schools that's [Music] it and before they did that they kick out of their homes they kick Jesus out of the homes first before they kick him out of the school that's exactly right you know I was just thinking the other day when you send your kids to school and you go to work it's like 6 to 8 hours of school and you would work at least 8 hours plus two driving back home unless you're like this guy here that he can work from home but you don't have much time spending with your kids so you drop off your kids at school they don't belong to you anymore they belong to the [Music] state isn't that something so I am blessed and I say thank you Lord that I'm able to have my kids home school I had a couple customer that they teacher teachers in the public schools we talk about it and they say that's the best thing you can do for your [Music] kids you know many of them don't agree but this that's their their income they don't agree with the rules but is their income and they're there I'm not going to BL I mean who I am to judge him but but the same again Spirits won't die right but the same thing when when when this Nicodemus came to Jesus says we know that you come from God so it wasn't him only but it only was him the one who stood up and I'm going to go to see this man I'm going to talk to him I'm sorry I say I was I'm closing but I'm I'm still closing and not long ago there is a preacher from Spain that goes to Israel many times and he said he was he stood up on a on the how do you call it the cry wall the whing wall so he was there and there's so many rabbis there and one of them came to him and says can I talk to you he said yes he said they didn't know each other he says do you know that Israel is going to fall [Music] that war nation's going to raise against raise up against Israel he said yes he says oh we know what's coming he said you're a Christian right he said yes I am well tell your people get ready [Music] after they're coming for us we're going to go after you we know he said we know that Jesus was the Messiah a RBI so it's later than we thinking so a rabbi recognizing that Jesus was the Messiah these days he said many of us believe that way but we must keep our mouth shut about it some dear Church build a huge Temple over there and they're not allowed to share their [Music] gospel brother and sisters L with that's right let's let's get into the word of God that's it it's more more that's it so when the voice comes and shouts out brother bran says when a deep is calling there is must be another deep answering that's right but if we don't have the same connection we must have to be in the same channel that's it like the two-way radio if you if you didn't put the same channel you won't be able to talk to your partner back then that's right so we have to be in the same [Music] channel this is the channel that's right amen that's right the more you eat of this the more connected you are to God so you don't care where you are there is not not dead spots like T-Mobile or Verizon no the Bible says even if you're in the dips of the waters how can I find you there that's your God he's willing to go that profound for [Music] you I have many errors in my life I wish I could be better but like that sister says I'm happy that I'm I'm not the man that I used to [Music] be you know what I'm just pressing on pressing on that's all I can say today
