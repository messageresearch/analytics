[Music] you are the king of glory forever pure and holy lord [Music] hallelujah so good to be in the house of the lord today amen amen can we just say it together he is risen he is hallelujah let our confession amen declare who we are in jesus christ amen the devil would like to put any other confession he could in your mouth because if he can convince you that you're not capable that you weren't called but i'm here to tell you my brother and sister we can look back in history and say well our lord is resurrected that's beautiful that's wonderful but we have to have him resurrected and you and i he needs to be living in our heart today it's just not a form of religion my brother and sister we don't have a tradition that god sent a prophet we have a living through the years uh saints i have you know oftentimes to kind of joke about unspoken prayer requests but you know sometimes pardon me sometimes there's things that are just so delicate things that are so personal to individuals that that we we don't want to speak them out but we covet your prayers concerning these things and uh many of these prayer requests of as they have been conveyed uh or are you might say kind of serious situations things that influence lives and change directions of lives and so just ask you to lift those up in prayer amen i want to speak to you this morning on the words as a title in whom i am well pleased as we'll take this from the book of matthew and uh it is their brother and sister that how beautiful these words were when they were spoken and i say thank you to the musicians the song service i especially was blessed by the specials amen how beautiful amen and we look at this my brother and sister and what's as i said most important is the resurrection is alive and you and i and this morning i'm not going to preach as it were on the resurrection our lord jesus amen he did exactly according to the word of god but there was a reason he did that it wasn't just that he would go and die and be resurrected but my brother and sister there was a people as we will uh with the lord helping us we'll touch on this morning just a reminder to stir up our pure minds to recognize who we are and where we fit in the body of christ amen the world you know i find it interesting and i say this a little bit joking you know you'll see a young man you know and he's wearing a jersey that's just way too big and it's got somebody else's name on the back it's got the number of a famous player and it's got you know somebody else's name on the back and and they paid a lot of money sometimes you know in the hundreds of dollars for these jerseys and and they're never going to be that individual they're never going to possess the ability of that individual it really is an identity crisis their identity is not in themselves it's in another individual but the word come in our hour my brother and sister not for us to walk around with someone else's name but to walk identified in jesus christ and when we walk identified in jesus christ we get to express as it were the personality that god placed in us in other words we don't have to conform and and if you know some of you are serious some of you are looking at me very serious so i'm assuming that at least 75 percent of you are very serious people but you're not some of you are very happy some are very funny very articulate and we get to serve god with all our heart mind body and soul and be that individual that god made you amen not conforming to this world but just conforming as it were to the gospel of jesus christ and i i'm happy because you see i don't want to be you and i can assure you you don't want to be men because i am old overweight and going bald you don't want to be me but in that other context if you catch what i'm saying you want to be me and i want to be you because we are the family the body of jesus christ manifest on the earth today isn't that beautiful hallelujah i get to be a part of something a part of the team but i still get to be me amen hallelujah let's turn matthew the third chapter verse 13 through 17. amen ask the lord's blessings on the service today then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him but john forbade him now we see this same attribute showed up in peter right jesus said you you need to wash my feet and i'll wash your feet and peter's like no no no we can't go there because you see they were looking in the human element and here is john now looking because he's been given identification by the holy spirit of what to look for and he's now saw the sign and he's saying oh my this is him and no i i can't i need baptized of you john forbade him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and cometh thou to me and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now now this word suffer in this context would tolerate it or allow this to happen for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were parted or opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased amen heavenly father we thank you for the opportunity to come together lord just open your word to our hearts today i pray in your name amen you may be seated saints i would like to now just go a few verses further in matthew to the 12th chapter and starting with the 17th verse another you might say scriptural indicator of the season and that it was the correct time and the correct ones that were fulfilling the word of god matthew 12 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah's the prophet so this is prophecy coming to pass behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall show judgment to the gentiles he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets a bruised reed shall he not break a smoking flock shall he not quench till he send forth judgment into victory and in his name shall the gentiles trust you see the first portion of these verses could be identified as it were with john but my brother and sister it was not in john's name that we trust it was in the name of the lord jesus christ and so we look at this scripture and we see that it's going to come a time my brother and sister that he's going to bring forth judgment into victory and you'd say well we're looking for that day i'm here to tell you my brother and sister that day has already been fulfilled in your life when you yourself were able to look into the mirror of god's word and judge yourself and say i need something more than i've got in my life and it come and a life-changing event amen the baptism of the holy ghost coming upon you brought you into victory now my brother and sister i i don't want to speak how to turn to anyone or offend anyone today but let's not be mistaken that just believing god sent a prophet is the victory that this scripture is speaking about this is a personal manifestation of jesus christ in your life this is you having victory in the world that we live in today and you we often times that say well we need to pray for our young people my brother and sister we need to pray for our young people there's a lot of spirits out there but we need to be praying for everyone because those spirits don't have an age where they cut off their influence there's people that are young and old that are being influenced by the spirit of this day that we live in and so it's there i pray each one of us would be brave enough to look into the mirror of the word and say you know what lord i want to be judged i want to judge myself because i want to move from judgment into victory but too many people my brother and sister as the scripture said if your heart condemns you not then you have confidence in god too many people come to church too often living their life under a cloud of condemnation i'm not worthy lord i did this and i thought that and this and have my brother and sister it's time do the judgment and come into the victory where you can then with confidence come before the throne of almighty god and claim that promise amen to be able as it were just to come there without saying oh i'm not worthy i'm not worthy but to come and say you know what this is what the word foreordained before the foundation of the world a position that literally has my name on it now imagine some people think this is far-fetched but i'm sorry some of us need just an encouragement and and uh you know for years i have just taken it this position i believe there's a spot before the throne on the sea of crystal that literally has my name on it this is not figurative i have taken this you might say brother paul really where's the foundation of that well i'll tell you i'm going to be there my name is in his book and you say amen to that and so if he ordained you before the foundation of the world to receive the word and be filled with the holy ghost then i personally take it a step further that he ordained a place on the sea of crystal before the throne for you this is not going to be a um what what is that a red light or whatever it is that walmart kmart used to do you know where where you'd be in this store blue light okay amen you know i've been one time there i actually witnessed this and you're walking through the store i was going to the sporting goods department just so you'll know and um over here is a you know light starts flashing this was in the old k mark and the light starts flashing and my it looked like a riot people are just and they're over fighting over stuff and finally one lady and another and both had a look at it and the other one's like i don't even know why i'm fighting you for this there's an anointing oh let that anointing my brother and sister magnified by the word by the holy spirit come down on you and i that we would look at the word and say that is mine that is mine i won't stop until i have possessed this amen and as we move forward amen we'll look at these and see how god is so great now as we come here this might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the prophet saying behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved so this is god making identity in jesus christ now we know by the word my brother and sister that this is god in flesh but what god is saying when he makes this declaration that i have confidence and have placed a perfect witness before the people this is not a substitute this is perfection amen my son whom i'm well pleased yes he in the flesh is a perfect representation of me can we grasp that people can get confused in the godhead pretty easy my brother and sister but it was god in flesh wasn't a second part not a third part not another party it was god himself and so he says as my beloved whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him now look my brother and sister i want you to understand that in this by putting his spirit upon him you see now that this is the perfect attribute of the nature of god amen perfect you see my brother and sister in the world we live in you can even buy a first uh production of something but nothing ever is a perfect representation right in the world of mass production you've got a machine that's making this but yet not one will be a perfect replica of the original but god was giving the endorsement that this is a perfect replica of my spirit this is me in the flesh this is not just a representation of me in the flesh this is me in the flesh amen so he's there he's he's going to show judgment to the gentiles but look how this is i just want you to catch this for a second he's not going to strive he's not going to beg he's not going to try and convince her corner because he had a perfect understanding of the seed oh i have called amen shall come young people old people you might be staggering i was visiting with the brothers last night about all in all out right the scripture says i would that you would be hot or cold because if you're lukewarm i'll spew you out of my mouth let's forget about this i'm going to try and let's be all in her all out and if i could strive with you this morning i say be all in because you see being all out doesn't lead to the result we really desire but we're all in it is a difficult fight but you know when we make our mind up that we're going to finish reminds me of one of the marathons back east there was a man there from one of the african countries and and uh something had happened he sprained his ankle or something and he's within sight of the finish line and uh he basically the pain is so great and he says i can't finish he told himself there's no way i can finish i can see i can see the finish line but there's no way i can finish and so the man is there stopped and there's pictures of him i believe you can still find them and it shows him there all hunched over leaned over and he's there and something must have sparked in his soul and he gets down on his hands and knees and starts crawling towards the finish line and someone come from the sideline and raised him back up and helped him cover that distance and then because people are so petty my brother and sister people say we want to all go to heaven but i want you to go my way and they tried to disqualify him there were those that were saying he broke the rules he had outside help he's disqualified but when it come down to the end of the day he was not the winner he was not going by this to be on the podium he was a man who had a heart to finish the race and it was there that ultimately they said for humanitarian reasons we need to honor this man's heart and he received that medal that they get for finishing the marathon and so it is my brother and sister that satan in this day will do everything within his ability to get you sidelined that you don't look at the finish line and you don't see the value of the finish line but i pray that it be so determined in your heart that if you have to get down and crawl that you will not stop until you finish this race and give your heart as it were completely to the lord jesus christ amen so it's there he's not going to strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the street a bruised reed shall he not break a smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment my brother and sister i believe this morning we look at this we have the answer for judgment we should not be sitting here this morning with a heart that is condemned we have the answer for judgment amen we are not sitting here hoping that god will find us worthy and i i hope i can make this point to you today because along this line is where we're thinking it is not for us to say well lord if i can finish this race lord if i can be pleasing i've heard people my brother and sister so concerned and i'm not speaking ill of them but so concerned that i would be deceived but the word of god says that this work was finished before the foundation of the world we are not here to worry about some wolf coming from the wilderness to deceive us it is actually revelation within our heart and soul it tells us i have already received of the lord i have already received there is nothing going to change my destiny people like what but we can be lost we can turn back that's right we'll touch on judas in a minute my brother and sister you can walk you can do all of these things but i'm telling you if you could ask judas today judas would have told you the problem i had didn't start on that day it started many years previous to that it started with other circumstances it started because of the lack of revelation but you see judas never sought catch this judas never sought all truth judas sought judas's revelation of who jesus christ was he never stopped and said lord reveal to me the whole purpose of the plan of god judas was there because he thought jesus christ as the messiah would deliver israel from rome that was his whole motivation plus he had a money issue amazing isn't it prophet of god said men go spirits don't go and the world of religion we live in now a money issue amen they're believing that deliverance is to be delivered from poverty and delivered from this and delivered from that totally misconstruing the word of god amen but it's here i want to just catch this real quick before we go on and he in his name shall the gentiles trust so we're seeing this prophecy of the word coming forth speaking that there will come a day that the gentiles you and i are going to so absolutely trust in jesus christ we'll actually forsake our own thinking amen we'll forsake our own reasoning now i'm going to ask you just if you would if you want to participate have you ever had to fight your own reasoning between the word and your thoughts amen it's absolutely i don't believe there'll be a one of us that will apart from this life that haven't went through the battle of fighting between what the word said and what our thoughts are and you can see my brother and sister because we've all done it you can see what happens in our life when we fall to the reasoning of our own thoughts when we we move away from the word and say but but that didn't really cover my circumstance because i had this and this no i'm sorry the word is all-encompassing when the word says to forsake your own thoughts it means forsake your own thoughts it doesn't mean forsake them except for and then you have subpart 235 g which was the world's been cruel to me and so therefore i have a substitute no no the word is the word and the word says here then in his name shall the gentiles trust so my brother and sister you realize this and i hope i don't come too strong this morning but you realize that god's going to let you fall on your face until you learn to trust him oh we're not talking i'm not talking to unbelievers this morning i'm not talking to people that are like well i don't know if i can go any further let me tell you the pow how strong the power of god is there was some of you i'm kind of plagiarizing this from another brother but it struck my heart some of you were ready to quit two or three years ago when this whole pandemic thing started oh i just can't serve the lord if this life is so hard and i'm so beaten down defeated and we've went through a whole pandemic and all kinds of craziness and sickness and you're still here don't tell me god doesn't come on the scene and deal with you amen he's not here to see you defeated he's here to see you victorious amen so as the word is there he says just trust me just trust me amen i i'm not going to go into the details brother sergey has shared this and such a beautiful thing but you know here's these young men well maybe some of them aren't necessarily young young in your sense but you know they're in drafting age there in the donbass or the nest region and you know they don't even dare leave their house because the russian army is going to grab them and turn them into a soldier and god gives a word to the pastor and the pastor doesn't he doesn't just instantly have an answer but then one day god comes and manifests this and my brother my sister delivers through a way that we would think that that doesn't seem right but delivers these brothers out of the hand of the devourer and gives them liberty and you see it's absolutely prophetic you see it's absolutely the word of the lord and i'm telling you just as supernatural as that is it loses a little bit of his emphasis because i'm not giving you the whole story but my brother and sister are just as sure as god delivered those men out of the hands of the russian army and deliver them into freedom is the spirit of god the spirit of christ here this morning to deliver you out of the hands of the enemy and deliver you into liberty you say but brother paul you don't understand my circumstance you're right i don't but my god does you shouldn't be looking to the pastor or something the minister for the answer anyway you should be looking to the lord but have confidence have faith in god god can fill you up with the holy ghost god can make you powerful he can make you invisi hallelujah and i didn't mean to exclude brother vasily the father meant a lot to me many years when i first started pastoring and stuff it was a great encouragement to me amen a man i miss very much amen so look this prophetic insight to the revealing see this is a revealing but it's also an establishment of the word in our day amen prophet brother brown didn't come just to put the word in order and reveal these hidden mysteries are you with me because he could have just went through the bible and said here this means this this means this that meant this and just disappear what he did is he come to establish it he come to give it roots in our lives roots in our churches and our families to give it roots to establish that in us and so it was not just hey we have a message and and we don't know much about it and we're waiting to see if it really is going to come to pass no my brother and sister as we spoke many times and recently you are the vindication of a prophetic message of this hour if it had not proved it had not uh uh uh become what he said it would and not manifested itself we'd say well well that's that's it's it's means nothing but wait we can look at his life he discerned the thoughts and the intents the healing all of these things there's the vindication i'm here to tell you you're the vindication you are the word in this hour coming to pass that is declaring the word that he spoke back there was true and it was powerful and the power of the word has been unleashed and is producing the very bride that he spoke and prophesied of is being produced today my brother and sister it is the truth amen people struggle on that well no we're not that important oh yes you are oh yes you are the prophet come to claim a bride he didn't come just to preach about a bride he come to claim a bride and his word that he pro the ministry of the hour has produced this it's not him not brother branham but it is christ through the word has produced this bride and i am so glad that it has amen because i consider myself to be part of that many membered body of believers now the word of god my brother and sister has to come the plan of god was to bring us to trust and rest in him now go look it up if you would study it not right now put your phone down go look what the prophet of god said about rest go in your bible you can study that several places hebrews is where we're going to go in just a minute hebrews 4 and 1. you see without entering to the rest my brother and sister we've accomplished nothing that's exactly right now some people they struggle with that idea but seriously we can sit here and without entering into that rest we have not accomplished anything we have become faithful churchgoers so there's something more than just saying well we here heard this we believe this you have to come into the rest we'll go into hebrews 4 and talk about it let us therefore fear in other words have a reverence last a promise being left left us of entering into his rest yes that's right i shared this kind of jokingly the other day visiting with a man and conversation took a turn and i started sharing a little bit with him and he says wow you're excited about that and it sounds like you go to church all the time you must be a catholic no i'm not i'm just a bible believing christian me too i haven't been to church in a while but we're going on easter okay i like your intensity i i love the fervents that you have in approaching this no my brother and sister he said not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together that's almost as much i would put it in context as anything else in scripture it's not like option b or option c now let us therefore fear lest a promise being left that's kind of like an inheritance here's this promise i've left you now it's going to be up to you what you do with this promise you can put value on this promise you can set it on the shelf of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it now i i think you're a little subdued this morning and i'm a little excited so i don't want to be over exuberant but you know sometimes i think saints that we just come to church and we do it because we do it and it's not because we were on fire sunday morning we weren't just wound up to go to the house of god to preach and pray and yeah you preach too you know that you're preaching to me right now yeah for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith so did you i i don't want anybody on the spot but i'm just going to preach what the lord laid my heart amen didn't any of you bring your faith this morning amen did you put the effort to mixing it now amen it can't just leave it setting you need to mix it right but the word did not profit them not being mixed with faith so you got to take the word and you got to mix faith and mix them together and then come into the house of god amen with them that heard it for we which have believed any believers here this morning even if you don't feel like it i encourage you to lift your hand up for the future hallelujah amen for we which believe do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they should enter into my rest although the works oh my oh my did you catch that i've been trying so hard to serve god i've been i've been just struggling come on can we be of courage today and somebody say amen i've been struggling and i've been just trying to i've been trying to believe and i've been trying to serve god it was finished before the foundation of the world amen what the real question today is or the real issue is trust the work is done that's all finished it's time saints for us to get a revelation of what it is to actually trust god young people old people every kind of people it's a revelation to trust god you got to come to a place that you say you know even if the wheels are falling off the wagon god's got a better wagon for me or a better horse for me or something better for me because he said i'll not leave you nor forsake you so you have to worry about god abandoning you and i'll put it this way if we can't trust one word of god then let's not bother trusting any of it but most of us have an inherent faith that we trust god as god but not enough to trust god completely [Music] so the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest on the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore remaineth that some must enter therein oh my brother and sister i'm some of the sum i'm part of that psalm that's going to believe this and trust it and enter in with it come on it's time to get it out of your mouth you know it's time to start confessing i'm going to be one of them amen but i have this problem you know i used to go to used to go to church with my wife on sundays right after i'd stayed out until about one in the morning shooting pool with my friends sounds like a good combination for a believer doesn't it it's a funny story actually i come home about one o'clock in the morning one night my wife had a friend a visitor that was staying with us and you know you know the all the tricks of the trade you know you idle the car way down shut the headlights off before you get in the driveway so don't flash in any windows turn the key in the lock real slow tiptoe in and here's this little five foot nothing girl with her finger in my face saying you are son of god what are you doing out of this time of night you should be home praying and i was like get out of my face did you know what the problem was i couldn't get her face out of my face and day after day and i would find myself down in the wee hours of the night shooting pool i didn't drink i didn't smoke i wasn't chasing anybody it was just a bad habit i had and i'd be shooting pool and that little five foot nothing girl's face was in my face do you think god ordained that or not she preached the sermon that the preachers couldn't get through to me but she did you see god will do whatever it takes saints because you see i thought i was relaxing i thought i was enjoying life why because i didn't know what rest was amen i didn't know that the only rest that there would be for my soul would be in jesus christ entirely not in church not a saying i believe this message none of that it had to be my rest had to be in jesus christ for this man right here to ever find rest that story is much deeper than it is but this probably not the time nor the place god another place said if they shall enter into my resting therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief you see it don't matter about who heard it first my brother and sister it's who acts on it amen there's no seniority in this gospel you believe it today amen it don't matter if it's your first day or it doesn't matter if you believed it for 80 90 100 years whatever it might have been amen now look here he says and again he limited a certain day saying in david today after so long a time as it said today if you will hear his voice and harden not your hearts for if jesus had given them rest they then would he not afterward have spoken of another day so the people themselves my brother and sister oh my am i am i preaching too personal this morning good i can step another step closer to you can't i do you realize according to the scripture that every time you sit in the house of god hear the word of god lay it down and walk out without acting on it there's a hardening taking place in the heart that the next time you hear it has less effect than it did the last time that's why the prophet of god told us to repent every single day because that repenting is a softening of the heart of the spirit so that our heart does not become look israel they heard the word preached and they had a word that had promised to liver them into the promised land and they come down to kadesh barnea and they just couldn't even say amen to the word of god they'd been given a promise you know what happened they'd heard it so much but actually didn't believe it could take place oh my oh my saints don't sit here this morning i pray with something in your heart say me be victorious in jesus christ me being an overcomer me being shouting in victory the devil being afraid of me i just don't see how that can take place don't do that don't do don't let satan harden your heart to faith in the word because the word will deliver you but if you've hardened your heart to that the supernatural will take place and you'll miss it come on look i'm not preaching anybody i'm just preaching easter i'm preaching a resurrection my brother and sister because i'm speaking oh if i could just lay this out to you i preached it way better in the middle of the night amen but look what it is my brother and sister the resurrection life is already in you i can't place it in you this message doesn't place it in you if christ placed it in you before the foundation of the world and this word that we're hearing now is bringing this word up before you to bring resurrection life into your life that you would understand god intended for you young sisters old sisters young men old men intended for you to be able to take the word and to apply the word to your life and those around you without condemnation without weakness without fear amen this is a resurrected word this is what the apostle paul was preaching he didn't preach some water down just believe that jesus christ come he was there my brother and sister with force i've often said i think we would all probably just get a little scared if the apostle paul actually god brought him right here and put him in our pulpit he'd tear the height off of us and we're like oh i thought the preacher preached too hard well i just skinned your elbows he'd tear it off of you but he'd tell you the truth and the seed in you couldn't say no to the truth because the seed has already been anointed by the word in other words that germ of life had to be in the seed in the beginning people get the idea that we've come down in laodicea and god's going around putting a seed here and a seed there no no i'm sorry that seed's always been in you that seed that life has already been in you hallelujah amen so we want to labor therefore to enter lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief see nothing's changed for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and the marrow and is a discerner in the thoughts and intents of the heart have you ever had this happen to you where you literally were sitting in church and a thought come to your mind and then the preacher spoke it right wow that's really strange that's just spooky that makes me nervous no sir that's the holy ghost passing right through your presence coming right here to whoever was ministering and he's saying oh i just had a good thought and then he speaks it and you're like i had it before you why it's because the same holy spirit that discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart is also anointing that same heart with the word that you're already prepared to receive what has been spoken to you don't you love that amen you know saints out there the weather isn't funny farmers are never happy just a week ago i was complaining and asking you to pray we have no water no rain dry dirt we can't plant our crops in dry dirt what are we going to do now it's too wet but it doesn't matter because as the spirit falls you say well praise the lord the brother paul preached on this and this and it really wasn't relevant to me it will just give it time the soil we've got it already all prepared when the day comes here in a few days right here just a couple more days we'll be out there planting away like crazy men but the seed is the bed is already prepared and the preaching of words sometimes god will preach to you what your circumstance will be next week or next month that's why the song i love that cast all your cares i don't know what i'm going to do this thing and this thing is in my family in our household we have trouble what am i going to do what am i going to do sit down and hear the word and the word will give you the answer to the problem even if the problem isn't manifested yet because that's how god works he's going to make it so real to you amen now as he brings us to this place that we can trust him it it works my brother and sister in such a fashion that we now no matter what happens are able to just say the lord's in control the lord's in control i i just believe the lord's in control amen i have to skip over a couple thoughts here amen maybe a little too personal this morning brother bryan says here what was the holy ghost given for and i recommend that you go read this or listen to this it's very good last night we were speaking what it was what was the holy spirit and we found it to be just about everything that god promised to us amen all these promises that are down through the bible my brother and sister it's all right there in the holy spirit you say but i read this and i don't know that i understand it or whether i qualify for that or whether that applies to me don't worry about that get the holy ghost just get closer to god just get to that personal element and god will reveal to you and open to you every promise he's given to you there's a young man that i used to really really really like i haven't talked to him in years he's left the message some of the last conversation i had with him was these things that brother branham spoke about they haven't come to pass says who and if you can discern it like that tell me what just happened in africa tell me what happened to the believers in the mountains of central america and south america tell me what's happening in europe tell me my brother and sister brother sergey and sister yulia uh you know different conversations but it's interesting because they were very parallel and and sister yulia i don't mean to embarrass her but she put it to me like this brother paul you don't know what it feels like and we don't sense but i have felt the bite of the devil i know what that feels like hey man i don't know what it's like to live in a country that that things are in turmoil all the time but i know it's like to live in this tabernacle right here that is in turmoil all the time i know what it's like to live in a life that my spiritual realm is topsy-turvy always being turned why because i was not in rest i had not found my proper place in christ amen what was that we found it to be just everything that god promised to us aha in it we found just what god's church would need amen we just found it to be a seal hallelujah i'm glad that seventh seal is the prophet of god brought such simple clarity it is the plan of redemption coming to pass thank you lord the plan of redemption is coming to pass can someone lift a hand and say thank you lord amen we're not hoping that it will come to pass and we're not looking to a far future it is right here the supernatural right in our midst this morning saints it's alive and well he has risen hallelujah amen we found it to be a seal a comforter a the rest and the joy and the peace and the resurrection you know that's why i'm preaching what i'm preaching this morning i'm going to blame it on this quote of the prophet because you see this right here is the resurrection we're looking for a resurrection and we're looking back to jesus resurrection i want to know where's your resurrection where is the time when christ rose up in you and had preeminence and you had such confidence in him that you said satan get behind me and you believed it and you acted on it and he responded to that oh hallelujah my brother and sister and all that god promised to his church lays within the holy spirit now i don't mean to be caustic or abrasive this morning but people are over here oh no no the answers lies in my doctrine the answer lies in our church the answer lies in this ministry over here are we message believers amen do we believe god sent a prophet in our day and that word was a word sufficient for our day and he says right here that our answer my brother and sister is in the holy ghost it is not in theology it's not in our intellectual approach it is in the holy ghost we want to have the promise of this word get the holy ghost amen give god preeminence in our lives trust him trust him saints hallelujah sorry i'm excited hallelujah hallelujah now look i wanted to just jump here amen now you know you know if i keep you all late i'm going to blame it on you because y'all sang songs and did all this stuff right john 14 12. verily verily i say to you he that believeth on me the works that i do he shall talk about did i misread that okay let me go back and read it again verily verily i send you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go into my father and whatsoever the pastor asked oh sorry i just keep deviating off of this whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son and if she's asked anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandments this right here my brother and sister is a key and we won't have time this morning to totally flesh out this key but you see we can't live an ungodly life and expect god to unlock the promise it don't work god does have a little bit of a works that we need to do and i will pray that i hope that thing does not bust as our plane bounced up and uh the beverage cart went flying here and flying there and banging off everything and the plane jerking this way and jerking that way and she's over there and i thought you know my heart i'm not making light of this my heart actually aged for this lady because as she's repeating the rosary she is talking to an entity outside of god man-made tradition imagine having the revelation to say lord i mean when this happens happens fast you know you guys know what i'm talking about i mean it's just this is scary it's scary when you're looking at the earth out your window and then you're looking back up at the sky out your window and then it's pointed down and it's pointed up it's like lord i just commit my life in your hands you see there's no more that you need to do well i hope there's not i hope that we have dealt with all of our baggage that you're not the one on the plane going lord forgive me of this and forgive me of this and forgive me this and see that's god wants you to have that kind of trust in him in an amazing have you ever well it might have happened have you ever seen a child takes a cookie out of a cookie jar and then walks in in front of mom mama took a cookie it's against the nature the child takes the cookie suddenly he's got to find a place to hide why did adam not run through the garden saying lord i've sinned lord where are you where are you i've sinned where are you lord because the nature is to hide it and nature is to believe that god can't see it and therefore we're all right but you see if we love him we'll keep his commandments he didn't say you'll never sin didn't say you'll never fall down make a mistake he said you'd keep your commandments and included in the commandments is how we deal with our shortcomings amazing a god who loved us so much he made a path away for us even in our shortcomings i'll pray the father he shall give you another comforter might abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knows him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you now i'm not going to go off into this but do you know that judas asked jesus how will you reveal yourself to us and the world not see you it's right there amen not jesus on the outside come on saints we can do our hair and our clothes and our whatevers and everything it's christ on the inside and you see oh this could get long and technical the prophet of god's vision of the tent the little room now many people are waiting for that to be manifested but i'm here to tell you my brother and sister it's already been manifested god already dealing oh i don't mean to embarrass anybody but my sister here i don't know her heart i don't know her thoughts but she's already been there she knows that god knows her amen you brother god knows you you know god knows you and when we have entered into that place not public not in that proclamation i am now a christian i've got the holy ghost but that secret place and god deals with you and the things that you have and the the troubles you might call it of life people will be like i i just struggle to serve the lord i've dealt with these things saints i've got a complex and it hinders me hold that complex in that room leave it there walk out delivered people said brother branham himself said i don't know if that's a real thing that's going to take place or that was in the spiritual i i i don't have this question but you see my brother and sister it never came to pass in the natural and we can see the type perfectly in the spiritual what is it you're going to walk in that room which is your spiritual position with christ and you're going to trust him so much the supernatural is going to come in your life prophet of god told us that if the supernatural is not happening there's a reason hmm that's right i'm going to blame the church and blame the message i'm going to blame the preacher blame yourself blame yourself amen because this is the promise of the word he said because it seeth not neither knoweth him but ye know him come on personal personal personal relationship amen hallelujah you know judas never got that answer saints he never got that answer he thought do you know that judas actually thought by his behavior that he was not going to kill the messiah he actually thought by his behavior he was going to force jesus to step out but you see what he did is he missed that the word for the hour had already been preached and he missed it oh lord help us come on saints amen now look are we all right amen i think that's most the food's in crock pots i don't smell any smoke so we're going to be fine hallelujah let's move us forward brothers to the law of grace amen i want to just keep going here i've got so many things to do amen now notice i just feel good is it okay to feel good as a preacher okay good good he was a rose of sharon he was offered to god as a sweet-smelling savor and this and then when we become unbearable before god i don't i don't want to preach at you but people like you kinda so i'll just take it on myself do you know there was a time that i was unbearable to god okay i'm i'm sorry i just can't sugarcoat this if if you haven't dealt with your carnal life you are unbearable to god yeah the scripture says it's actually a stink that comes up before him i i didn't really want to say that because that just seems so hard especially those of you that you know put your deodorant all this stuff staying no i smell good well see sometimes in the spirit we think we smell good that's right but we don't we can't smell our own stench hopefully that's not too strong is it amen he was offered a sweet smelling savor and when we become unbearable before god and so excuse the expression so stinky you see that our sins and things are so bad and so foul that we become to calvary and where a lily or any flower before perfume can be made you take a flower it's beautiful a big morning lily or a rose the rose of sharon is a beautiful flower while it's living it's beautiful but get the odor out of that to get a perfume it has to be crushed and they crush it and squeeze the perfume out of it you see christ when he was here on earth amen brother mason move that forward please you see christ when he was here on earth he was beautiful he healed the sick he raised the dead his life was never compared he was beautiful but to make you like he was see god was in the process of making you can you grasp this saint this is not just a bunch of little people here trying to serve god god made you excuse me if i get excited but to make you like he was when god looked down he said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased your sacrifices become stink under my nose but this is who i am well pleased he was putting the difference between a life here and a life here because you see he had to give us something we could look to yeah well i'll get sidetracked but excuse me do you know that less than one percent of children will ever make a living playing sports but a hundred percent of us will stand before god you see we have to get things in the right context i've got to make a living i've got to this i've got a that i've got this great thing i'm going to accomplish just rest assured you will stand before god amen whether you are rich or poor the flesh likes the word rich though doesn't it your sacrifices lord don't let me be harsh we think so much of our sacrifice i did this now i don't want anybody to be offended i'm just going to name off all of these things and please don't no one be offended i cleaned the church when nobody would do it i played the piano when no one would do it i did this when no one would do it i have done this i preached when nobody even cared to come to church whoa is me that's not the sacrifice god's looking for god's looking for this right here to get on the altar and die right there and you know that life on the altar that has died will never stink it will never take on corruption become a stink of my nose but this is who i'm well pleased now he was well pleased and to make us well pleased to god you guys catch that that's it you guys catch that i am already well pleased to god no brother paul i know your faults i i know your your your issues in your life it doesn't matter my brother and sister my god has already made me well pleased to my god he's already made you well pleased now it's just time for us to submit to the word and let it be fulfilled and else because it is already a finished work from the foundation of the world amen it's no longer for us to labor and struggle and say i'll try but i don't know if i can serve him just give up let him do it hallelujah amen this is what we got to do give up let him do it and to make us well pleased to god he had to become crushed on calvary and the sin of this world had to squeeze out the life out of him and he died bearing the sins of the world that we might be anointed with the rose of sharon he was the lily of the valley he was wounded for our transgression a sweet smelling savor by his stripes your heel the lily of the valley that give us the opium to ease our sickness and pain what a marvelous marvelous picture oh my brother and sister how beautiful this picture is what i could not do he did amen you say brother paul this is easter that's right my brother and sister this is easter resurrection life is not a day of the year resurrection life is a position in jesus christ it is not a sunday event it is not a wednesday event it is an everyday event of our life hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah too many people have turned it into a church thing i went to special meetings i went to a convention i was here i got all excited but you know by monday of the following week we're right back in our same old rock amen i'm looking for a delivering supernatural power that breaks every bondage breaks every yoke of bondage that would hold the son or daughter of god young people don't look to the world out here it's just an ever increasing yoke of bondage look to christ and let him break that bondage and finally know what life and freedom and liberty is hallelujah hallelujah you know us old people have a hard time preaching to young people because you see i want to go out there and sit down with you just like i'm you but you look at me just like i am and you say i have no connection but i want to tell you that sin is sin and it might not be what it was in my day is what it is in this day but it was still the sin of my day and i still had to fight with that and i found a little late i shared last night with the brothers a little bit i found it a little late in life and i regret that i would love to reclaim those 21 years of my life that i threw away but i can't but i could plead with you i could as it were beg you give god a chance first don't give the world a chance first and have to come back give god a chance first we serve a supernatural god he'll bind the wounds amen he'll wipe away the teeth marks of the wolf but why when we can go to him first amen when we can go because you see the seed that was planted before the foundation of the world is in you period and i'm here to tell you whether you come hard or whether you come easy you'll come amen and it's not a threat that's a promise and it's a glorious promise it's a beautiful promise how can you say that brother paul because the resurrection took place and he promised it would take place in you and it would take place in me and i'm here to witness it has it has oh thank you thank you lord now i hope this is not too direct i don't mean it that way i love you amen amen god's purpose and send the holy spirit now and mark that down john 14 the beginning of the 14th verse and reading through the chapter for the basis god's purpose that we find here and sending the holy spirit was one purpose that god himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church now who's the church we are it's not this brick out here it's not these shingles not that sign out there you are the church might dwell in his church and continue his plans through oh come on come on he wants to continue his plans through you through you through you through you he don't want it to be some great preacher that he uses them men but he wants it to be you he wants his plan to come to life and be fulfilled and walk on the earth today just as jesus walked in that day he wants you to do that he wants it to be alive in you continuous plans through the church that god was in christ i hope you catch all this that god was in christ continuing his plans through christ out of christ into the church continues work through the church now we know what the holy spirit is we found out last night that it's god amen now when we think of god the father as jesus spoke of here his father god the son as jesus god the holy spirit as what we call it today now that does not mean that there is three individual distinct gods it means that there is one god in three offices amen now look at this may we say it like this all that god was that's right he poured into christ now there's some people who'd be like that's right we put our three glasses out here and we take this and we pour it from here to here to here no that's not right all that was in god he poured in to christ all that was in christ he poured in to the church amen amen well praise god that can't be right because we do not have the same power as god amen i'll tell you how it is amen you've got every ingredient amen that god placed in his word has been poured into you every ingredient you need faith lift a hand in a heart and say lord i need more faith you need some peace lift a hand in the heart and say lord i need peace lord i need deliverance i need provision my brother and sister it's all right there that was in god god himself has been poured into you and if we are here oh oh help me help me lord and we are here my brother and sister and we say but i don't see god working in my life get the distractions out get the things out my brother and sister do you realize we call it so cool that we want the next model oh look at this phone it'll just do everything yeah it can but it started by stealing your time it's a thief and if you start looking at your phone like it's a thief you'll look at it differently i'm so blessed the lord allowed me to get an iphone 94a i mean i only had to mortgage the house but it is so special to me it does everything it does quantum physics although i don't even know how to open the app but i've got facebook and foot book and back book and i've got every kind of book and i spend hours oh oh look at their clothes look at their shoes oh look at their house oh look at their vacation oh look at there this and oh look at there that huh dave ramsey's daughter wrote a book you can find it online love your life not theirs i think that ought to be a spiritual book instead of a financial book how about we come to a place that we're so in love with god we look at this and say thank you lord for the life thank you lord for what you've gave me lord you resurrected yourself in me and you're alive and i see you every day i love this life you give me lord but instead the devil's got us so distracted we want better shoes better clothes better cars better house better job more money but that won't satisfy the soul say it won't do one thing to put you in a position where one day you would face christ you know i want to face christ on his side hallelujah you know i've always had kind of a judgmental spirit because you see god's raising this bride up to judge the world amen amen and you know where judgmental spirit first comes into your life at you judging yourself amen and by the maturity of the word it brings you to a place the scripture says that you would judge all things usually when you use the word judgmental spirit people are like the pastor i knew he was judging me maybe that was your own conscience i know that's how it works with me yeah no i'm serious i said in church it's terrible you know brother jason shared that the other day and i was i was it did my heart good amen i'll tell you i was sitting in church just the other day and brother chris was judging me amen i mean it was terrible i was just like i should get up and walk out of here and it wasn't but just a little bit before that brother david in church was judging me and i thought i just i don't have to put up with this except for i had to admit before i got up out of the chair that what they were saying was true and then my next step is lord forgive me come on forgive me for my foolish way of presenting it but all that christ was important to the church not into one individual but into the entire body there where we come together in unity we have power all that god was was in christ and all that christ was is in look how brother branham changes this now it's no longer the context of the church but he brought it down and personalized it and said all that it is is in you can i point my finger at you is that okay nobody will be offended if i point my finger at you today all that was in christ has been poured into you don't sit here and say well i just i just feel attracted to the world turn around look at christ look at christ the world's beautiful my brother and sister it is it is come on i know some people probably wouldn't think i should say things like this but look i'm driving down the road a house out in our neighborhood first off it's like how can they sell a house like that for a million dollars who can afford that the house sells we drive by there's a twin engine 26-foot bench in the driveway most of you won't know what that even means it is the most gorgeous jet boat you have ever seen in your life brother david wants an airplane oh no the debate has started oh my sister some of you might be saying i want a shoe collection amelda marcos is my hero most of you won't even know what that is but you see that's not where we placed our value we placed our value in this word and this word come alive in us and you know what i'm not afraid to stand before you and boast that god has given us power i have power now is it the power i have in me no it's the power i have in christ when i am in my correct position in christ i can speak to the devil and i can bind him i don't have to beat oh my brother and sister you see this and some of you most of you young people won't even come from this but my mama at times drugged me to every kind of church meeting there was and they would be the preachers and you wouldn't want that preacher to pray over you because you would have been standing there in front of the church and they'd have been hitting you on the back as hard as they can oh devil come out of this woman come out of this woman deliver her deliver heart and they walk back to their pew and the preacher's like yeah see the devil's left no she's just been beat up she's been mugged in church but i've got power saints i won't go there i'm not going to do but i'm telling you and you can say him into this because you should have this and do have this in your life that satan will come down and he will come and start to assault you and you we've got a choice we can close the gates to the city or we can let the enemy pour in and hope we can deal with him no sir we can bind that in the name of jesus christ now is that you binding it no it's jesus christ binding it but you've got to have confidence in who you are to step into that position and say satan i bind you because if you waver if you waver the devil i was talking i hope you don't mind i was talking to ezra an eagle last night it would apply to all you young people our visitors which aren't really visitors we're going to claim you as family so sorry your family is dysfunctional but it's your family don't look brother moses your kids were nodding their heads but you see when we step into that right position amen it's not us it's not us it has nothing to do with us young people if you can just catch a glimpse of what god desires to do in your life you will look out at the devil and the spirits of this age and you'll say you know i don't know how it is in your world around the farm would be like oh no another piece of junk made in china how about we get to the place young people i encourage you trust me if you would start exercising the authority god has given you start looking at that and go huh it's just another piece of junk from the devil not even worth what it's going to cost me not even worth what i'd have to pay for that oh hallelujah because you see all that god was was in christ and all that christ was is in you okay i've kept you all long enough now look at this oh man i've got so much good stuff here oh let me just jump forward realize now as i touched on a few minutes ago you see all that christ poured into us is in measure is in major my brother and sister we have the authority to take the word of god now see what happened the seven sons of siva had an understanding of how the process worked but they lacked the spirit of god so they saw we can go in there and tell these demons to depart but let me tell you those demons i was talking let me go back to where i was talking these young men young people you've got a sincerity meter if we say serve god and then we go out and act like the devil you're not going to be deceived but i want to put this in on behalf of all parents don't take the troubles and tribulations that you see in mom and dad is a sign that god's not present the devil would like nothing more than to destroy a family because when he destroys the family he's destroyed the children with it and the devil will come but be honest and take this sincerity meter and apply it to life and you'll recognize literally there's nothing out there because you see the devil imitated it right and all that was in god was poured into christ and all that was in christ was poured into the church and then brother branham rewords that all that was in christ is in you what's the opposite of that can somebody tell me all that was in satan he poured into van halen and he poured into journey and he poured into zz top and he poured into this and he poured into that and he poured into lampoon and i'm out of touch you know some of you say i don't know what you're talking about well those were the demons that were present in my day and they're gone but their spirit never left and so all that is out there is what satan poured himself into and he's just waiting for his opportunity to pour that into you amen oh my goodness my goodness and i didn't even intend to preach to you young people today oh wait i was preaching to myself excuse me the very spirit of nature see the same ingredient the very spirit of nature of christ in you now look at this i want to make a point to you and we'll be quick here you realize all that christ poured into the church into you has left you now with this very nature of god the very life of christ is now rising up amen i hope some young people would grasp this just not us old-timers it's rising up in you and it's coming forth so this very nature of god is rising up and it's rising up in you and because god made this before the foundation of the world do we got that point over good didn't we amen before the foundation of the world god laid this in here and so now it's coming down and it's been revealed in jesus christ and jesus christ poured it into the church and it's now being revealed in you and it's going to be the thing the world we live in today so many have so much fear they're like well i just want to i just want to be found worthy of god i just want to be found that he would say well done my good and faithful servant i i i'm afraid of this i've had a voice to me saints this is not just a preacher's thoughts these are life thoughts and people are like what is it but i want to tell you my brother and sister rejoice let's lift a hand and rejoice because all that was in god was in christ and god looked down at christ and said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased do you realize that life is in you that life is in you it's no longer for you to be afraid of whether god's going to be pleased with you you have that very word in you and he's looking down on that very word and his words to you is well done my good and faithful servant enter ye into the joy of the lord amen we're living in a day it's no longer a time to be afraid of what's going to happen in our life i don't want to become a holy roller don't then just become a child of god just come to handle the word of god trust god believe god and when you see that you'll see that he will just as it was with abraham i'll count it to you for righteousness he'll pour it out to you and say here it is here's my life but do you see my brother and sister no longer to be afraid am i going to make it no longer to be afraid am i going to be good enough to be a son of god a daughter of god am i going to make the rapture can i live that kind of life it's already done it's already done trust him the whole key now is just trust him let what he's already poured into you come to life let it be manifest and as it grows in you amen i'll tell you what as a young man as a young man you wouldn't have caught me saying amen to the word of god for love nor money because cool hip kids like me just don't do that i'm not referencing you guys but there come a day that something was so real to me it just came out that's the truth that's the truth amen that's the truth i believe that and it become real by experience i don't want to give you text book religion i don't want to give you just some loose example god help us that our lives each and every one would be evidence of the resurrection he's living saints he's living sister emmy if you'd come he is living we'll get the other half of this on another day hallelujah it's good saints there's so much there's so much i i would have had to push my notes out here in a wheelbarrow if i had drug everything that i looked over to it and i have basically it was a smaller wheelbarrow a backpack or something but you see the grace of god wants you to see that you already occupied this position in him before the foundation of the world this is not we got saved and we come here yes we are the earthly manifestation of the word calvary calvary saints was the earthly manifestation of what took place before the foundation of the world and god wanted to make it so real to you human that you can say i see it and i see who i am resurrected god yeah that's what it was jesus christ resurrected god you say no no that was jesus the flesh body yeah my brother and sister he took that very same body it wasn't an exchange he didn't put a body in the grave and raise up another one he took that same body and god in you took us born and sinned shaped iniquity come the world speaking lies took that same body glorified it and said this is my church this is my body and who i am well pleased oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my yeah let's just send sing a song or two amen [Music] hallelujah you know it's funny because uh brother jason trashed my after service song service here but hey i'm glad because it just shows me the same god amen same god it's not man's thoughts man of course i don't know i wasn't in the room for a moment he might have might have looked at my notes but i don't think so he's got it all in control aren't you glad saints now look you got some struggles you got some things in your life you got some turmoil in your life you've got some things you don't know the answer to i want to encourage you one or two things you can do you can sit in your chair and ring your tail is that an acceptable phrase kind of a down south phrase you can sit there and ring your tail or you can let go and let go that's it that's exactly right and you can say you know what i think i'm just going to trust the lord because he's got it all in control hallelujah amen [Music] is [Music] i put that reassurance way down in my soul he's got it all in control let this be a prayer i put my life in his hands [Music] my father knows what i need my father knows what i [Music] in need i go through he knows what's best for me my father knows what i need can we say amen to that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen casting all my tears hallelujah you know that's hard saints [Music] it's really hard but you know they say it takes 30 seconds or to create a habit is that right research i guess you'd say psychology gain a habit 30 days lose a habit in 30 days could i challenge you this morning those of you that are technical this afternoon that you spend the next 30 days not by accident not just off the cuff but spend the next 30 days lifting up the burdens of your heart and soul and hand them every single day to the lord that means not in your mind not a little thought buzzing upon your neurons but an actual vocal lord i have this burden and lord i am giving it to you i know i can't change it but i know you can change it and i want you to change it lord because i need you to change it would you accept a challenge to take that effort and say lord i don't need to carry this burden i'm worried about children you can't save your children i'm worried about a husband you can't save a husband i'm worried about a wife you can't save a wife i'm worried about my job you can't influence your job the list could go on and on and on until i have bored you to tears but i'm telling you i have seen god's supernatural come in every aspect from the deepest of personal relationships to the simplest of the carnal things of cars that are dying and their god coming on the scene tires that don't wear out gas tanks that don't get empty cancers that disappear amen mental problems that vaporize with no reason why because somebody had courage enough to say he has risen and he came to give me victory over my circumstance and i'm believing and i'm going to apply that amen paul now practice what you preach hallelujah i will cast all my cares upon you i lay all of my burdens down at your feet anytime i don't know [Music] upon i will cast for all my cares upon [Music] all of my burdens down at your feet at any time i don't know just what to do i will cast all my cares upon you hey man i'd like to sing one more song but i want to ask you a question first doesn't it just make your heart happy [Music] to know that the very spirit that was in our lord jesus christ is not we hope for but is in you that's the confidence you need to have in god that's the confidence you need to have in his word it's in me satan you said i'm not but the word says i am i'll
