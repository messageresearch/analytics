TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and say Lord pour that into me but Lord don't let me set it aside let me understand what it is you're giving or moving in my life amen just explaining the baptism which ties right into godhead to a young man recently my brother and sister you see when we get just a couple things out of order actually it turned out to be a very I guess you would say reasonably simple process for for me to to do that because sometimes all you got to do is just get a couple things set back in order and and then it all explains itself we don't have to act like we're a theologian to to make this work and as we do that then God takes us back into the word he takes us right back to that word and he just starts adding more into us what's he adding not more theology not more of the church world as it were he's adding the word he just keeps adding the word amen that's why we have to stay in the word and when the word actually comes to you you can't walk away from it amen you stop and let God keep pouring it into you because what he's doing my brother and sister the brother brandom says it this way he's they're adding more power so what God's doing let's simplify this not call it doctrines and whatever and God comes and yesterday he poured some power into you and today wants to pour a little more power into you and tomorrow he'll pour more power into you and soon you'll look back and you'll say my we didn't know anything we didn't understand anything back here but we can't stop and then start building around that because he's got more power for us amen and when we will receive that power receive that word well it becomes to us so powerfully that sometimes we doubt Revelation can be so strong that we can't comprehend Hind and we pull back but that's not what God wants us to do he wants us to walk and receive that he wants us to add to what's already been revealed to us can you say amen amen the Lord's still adding he's still adding my brother and sister there is no way I'm going to make this as an emphatic statement because I believe it with all of my might we talk about we won't understand Jesus Christ uh our Lord through through time and Eternity but I'll tell you we'll still be digging things out of this message right to the day of the Rapture God will still use this word to speak Revelation right to the day of the Rapture because this is his word and it cannot come to an end it has to continue to expand itself amen the Lord is still adding to us amen i' like to just read a little bit out of the sermon countdown when I say a little bit it's actually I don't know five six paragraphs here but they're short ones now notice all these things go back and catch this brother brandom's talking and you should be able to follow this here he's talking about the airplane and all these other things in science progressing moving forward Etc now notice all these things are achievement that man has achieved only are types and shadows of what God is doing yeah now taking what brother bram's talking about right here if you'll just give me a little moment of Grace you know lately I've mentioned to you about what woke is right the whole woke thing going on in the world oh woke woke yeah got to this and that Satan's imitating the bride of Christ waking up that's true amen and every one of these things he he's perverted the rainbow he's doing every one of these I don't want to keep going on through this the list can be quite extensive but look at what Satan's doing he is following because he's seeing after the fact what God's doing and he jumps right in to imitate it amen my brother and sister that's the world of clothes I sorry I'm I don't want to be too derogatory but that's what Walmart is amen a whole Marketplace of things that somebody else thought of and they produce it cheaper they give it out that's what Satan's doing what's it cost you if you follow me here what's it cost you to be woke you got to pray you got to read your Bible you got to be surrendered to the Lord and God is awakening us as a bride of Christ waking us up to be woke in the world you can be anything you want to be you don't even hardly really have to pay a price other than just dressing Goofy and whatever but you see Satan he's offering the cheap version and our culture says I can get something for nothing that's what I want that's why real Christians are becoming rare is because their sacrifice involved with being awakened to the gospel if you want a ref reference scripturally to that just go to the Saints on the road to emus and you'll see them becoming woke hope you don't mind me putting it that way you will see them becoming woke as they walked Christ is pouring into them pouring into them and at the breaking of the bread they come completely awake of who they were and whose presence they were in and Satan says man great plan I got to try that and it works for him but it won't work on you amen so all these achievements that man has achieved only are types and shadows of what God is doing he always does it that way he has told us the signs that would be in the skies the things that would be happening just before the coming of Christ we see that now it's only a pointing post and we see science how they have achieved and how God has achieved by his church so the whole world's all focused on what science has done in the meantime the church that's you is achieving Milestone after Milestone after Milestone as revelation after revelation after Revelation is coming to you amen that's why the prophet could Clearly say you won't be the same person you was yesterday because God is allowing us to achieve and step into the word and then ultimately we become the word and when we have become the word my brother and sister the intrinsic connection between you and Christ cannot be severed it's a beautiful thing does man ride in an airplane he don't want no horse and buggy no more unless he's just wanting a little fun but the horse and buggy remember what is the power in the airplane just more horses added that's all so when John Wesley found sanctification they set aside work from justification he never condemned justification he only added more power to it amen now let's think about this in a very very broad cross-section here and when the Pentecostals and now he's talking about the real Pentecostals when the Pentecostals found the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the gifts they never denied sanctify ification or justification they just got more power and raised up and went up because he found more power now I believe I don't believe I'm out of line here to sa if we can insert subpart to paragraph 48 and when the bride realized who she was amen she didn't say that Pentecostal movement is just nonsense she didn't say that this sanctification nonsense justification nonsense amen the word of God come to you and I and can we admit it tonight maybe even lift a hand or not ahead and say has God not poured his power into this bride of Christ amen we're not sitting here just theologically fumbling through pages and quotes and scriptures and saying this has become a real Living Word in you and I amen it's there more power amen as you step beyond that the prophet talks about the eighth day and we can not necessarily go into that and we can talk about how that that's stepping over another boundary as it is into the beginning once again what was in the beginning my brother and sister the power of the spoken word as God created and it's come now into our day and we are here in the prophet of God said it's time for you and I to speak amen it's time for us to declare who we are and what God has given us not sit back and say well I I need a quote for this now don't get me wrong I try to base everything I do and preach out of the quotes to make sure that I don't get out of line but there comes a time in our life that God moving in our lives my brother and sister we don't need a quote we need to release ourself to the power of the Holy Ghost which is God in you Christ in you wanting you to speak over that baby to speak over that sister speak over that friend or family in Nevada speak over these things because God has given you and I the power of the spoken word we have come back into that day where God would like to hear his bride speak amen I hope I'm not too carried away tonight amen now look at these he goes on to say here all those things foreshadowing as they come up if we had time we could really stay on that but we haven't but he raised up as science achieves something Looking Backward God achieves going this way going forward to the kingdom I tell you I thank the Lord for that going forward to the kingdom amen now we find you see you understand what he's really saying there it's not just being a Christian and going to church no sir we're on a kingdom Journey we're not a journey to church we're on a kingdom Journey amen stepping out as Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah you know brother Donnie Reagan preached it this way many years ago I've never forgot the analogy he said the problem is instead of us getting in the center of the road of the word we plow this ditch for a while then we run over and we plow this ditch for a while God wants us centered amen he wants us to have a revelation and understanding of the word and go right down that Center amen not plowing ditches Hallelujah sorry I've been a little excited I can tell you right now just had kind of a messed up whatever afternoon and the devil just trying to just put the brakes on everything amen I don't know where the wagon's going but the brakes are off amen now we go right down here now we find from isua Street the planes took off in great revivals and swept the world to the unknown and the Heavenly places speaking unknown tongues with unknown gifts to the world why they thought they were Fanatics aren't you glad to be called a fanatic it's offensive in the flesh but when we look back in the word and says and they will worship in a way that is called heresy I wish I could remember the words I can't remember which one of those colored Brothers back e spoke that but he had a nice little sing song There Worship in the way they say say the way they do he do he everything they this and this and this and we'll settle for just simple heresy my everybody wants to be accepted by everybody yeah I wouldn't even name names so you don't bother to even try and search and find it but just recently there's a man of somewhat significant importance in the world of religion is waiting for the day of full Unity they're anointed they're looking for it they know it's coming and they want it see quite a difference of it being forced on them get this they want it now what type in Shadow are they of there's a bride many membered body on the Earth today a bride who wants this Unity it's not going to be forced they seek it desire amen pray for it it's not going to be a government it's not going to be a hierarchy it is the one we have always longed for a Unity with our Lord Jesus Christ amen they comment these branhamites have a strange Unity amongst them even though they fight well I tell you the day will come that the spirit of contesting over the message will either turn to denomination or bring that Deliverance the word talked about amen some will go to that route you got to be unified with us some are going to be looking way above the head of man saying there's my Unity his name is Jesus Christ amen there's my unity and I want it to come and I want my brothers and sisters to have that same kind of unity amen I just love how brother Brown says now we find from isua Street the planes took took off great Revival swept the world to the unknown into Heavenly places speaking unknown tongues unknown gifts to the world why they thought they were fanatics but they had been able God got a group of people in his hands Hallelujah do you realize tonight you'd say well I I I don't know am I in God's hands you know I believe what the prophet said I don't believe those accidental words God's got his hand if we could have our spiritual eyes open tonight God's Got his hand around us tonight and he's leading us and guiding us as a promise of the word and he said I'm going to take you where to all truth amen and the whole sum of all truth is you in the throne on the sea of Crystal with him that's the summation of all truth it doesn't end up short of that it doesn't end up just outside the gates it doesn't end up on the road or the journey my brother and sister the sum of the all truth is you and I in his presence for eternity that's the summation of truth hallelujah and he got a little boy we'd almost be thrown in jail to say this today got a little cross-eyed negro man down there in isua street that had no more sense than to believe what God Said oh I want to be like that man Lord just just let us be like that man crosseyed and all if necessary to have no more sense than to believe all that God said amen oh Hallelujah all what God Said was truth that's right amen hallelujah that's what we want to come to the Way Up Is Down amen not to come with our finery and come with our deal everything pronounced correctly I'd flunk that anyhow but anyway you know my brother and sister just come to that place to real that God didn't care about phds and llds and and doctors of divinities and all of this God didn't care he come down to a little cross-eyed negro right little man forget forget about those words in a sense he come down to our brother and anointed him to just simply believe is that man worth more to God than you then God will come down to you and I that's right he'll come right down when we come to the place that we have no more sense than to just believe the word amen when we don't find a reason not to when we find a reason just to surrender right and say Lord I have no more sense amen right may I be as a dumb animal and just follow yes what I have follow the instinct how many stories has there been through the ages of someone lost in the desert and finally they turned their little burrow loose and they just followed it and it took them to water oh my brother and sister could we just turn loose and let the Holy Ghost it just let the presence of God just lead us into the word lead us into a life like we've never had before Amen to an understanding of what the message is I don't want to sound like I'm some guy flying off the edge please don't think of that but I'm wondering my brothers and sisters I've spoke here at the church I'm wondering if we even understand what the message is about we we've brought so many ideas from so many ways and and this must mean this and must mean that how about we just let go and follow amen instead of trying to lead let us follow and let God work in our life cuz he promised I'll lead you and guide you to all truth truth and we shouldn't doubt that at all we shouldn't question that at all we were up in Canada I told the man up there I says you just let go this is God's promis amen this is God's promise let go and let God lead you to all truth right exactly amen because they're concerned a little bit just a very short information on that you know they've just uh realizing where they been for years there's some things wrong there some things undercurrent stuff and you know then you look up and there's there's people everywhere Believers come here Believers come here come here come here and the brother said I I I just Lord I I I need you I don't know just let go brother amen just stop he made a promise to you he is going to lead you to all truth hallelujah thank you Lord amen I didn't find truth I didn't create truth can't interpret truth but I can follow truth amen hallelujah amen oh hallelujah what do we say in this day the very same thing has been I believe presented to us who do you say that's right I am that's and I believe it comes and I'm sorry to say it this way forgive me but some don't have the right answer no you see I believe we being filled with the Holy Ghost have been Anointed The Very expression of the word who do you say I am I think we can say with confidence you are Christ amen in me that's right that's how I can identify you Christ in me and that is my Hope Of Glory Hallelujah I don't want to Loosely interpret that but my brother and sister it's got to come down we see him so personal that our problems are not our problems and our glory is not our Glory it's all in him amen amen Christ moving amen going back to those of you just a very quick little lesson Matthew 16 to those of you that maybe haven't seen cesaria Philippi and maybe with the craziness of the world won't get an opportunity but what you have is a stream that flows from the rock everpresent water flowing from The Rock and they had a temple to this God and a temple to this God and a temple to this God and this God and this God yeah and Jesus is there with the disciples standing there if you don't mind me just doing this and he standing before that and they're looking at all of these temples of all of these gods and Jesus says to the apostles who do you say I am yeah got all the favorite religions of the day yeah he didn't have a temple they could see he was the temple that's right amen and those Apostles my brother and sister I've heard people preach like them guys a bunch of dummies them guys was us a bunch of dummies and we start to get the answer wrong and our lord Jesus says stop I'm not even going to let you give the wrong answer amen what is the answer to eternal life it's not a dialogue in Christian history it's Revelation pardon me saying it this way it's just my farm roads it's re Revelation right there on the hoof that's it right there standing before Jesus and that anointing was not Peter's anointing that was God putting those words in Peter's mouth and when he spoke those words oh bear with me I hope I don't sound like a heretic when he spoke those words a lightning streak went down through his history and struck you amen come all the way down through history struck our heart amen the scripture says without the Holy Ghost we can't even say that Jesus is the Christ and here we sit today my brother and sister not only saying he's the Christ but we can say he's in me and that word is me amen it is not just religion it's not a follower that word is me and I'm standing here today to manifest my Lord Jesus and just as he sent them forth with a message in that day we stand here today with a life that is living in this Dark World hallelujah amen you look at that and can only imagine remember the artist's drawings that they had of what those temples looked like back in history pretty Grand pretty incredible yeah look like a lot of the churches today but he wasn't there he was standing in humanity right in front of it and you are that Humanity you are the one he is in today Hallelujah not the columns not the high roofs not the Magnificent whatevers but you amen amen it's Christ in you that makes you what you are exactly isn't that nice takes the pressure off of us amen not an excuse but just takes the pressure off of it God knows what I need he's going to give it to me amen when when I'm hungry as it is he he satisfies just today I'm sorry trying to break the habit of throwing sister Jerry under the bus but it's a hard habit to break amen but just today sister Jerry's like look at this quote man incredible quote I read it to you tonight I'm not ashamed to say it it struck right down the vein I was thinking almost as though I said hey research assistant find me a quote that fulfills this and this and this and this instead God just makes her excited about a quote and when I read the quote I'm like that's exactly right amen hallelujah because God wants to speak now some people get upset about the idea that my wife shared a quote with me and then I used it I want to put a disclaimer right here she did not force me it was my choice okay so don't look bad on Jerry but you see any one of you could share the quote and it would have been just as exciting to me because God knows that we're human had a little disaster this afternoon I'll just throw it out to you real quick you know I was like like praise God I'll be off work early today and then my phone rings and there's a problem and by the time that problem's over it takes two hours of my time and now I feel frantic in fact I still feel frantic in case you're wondering why I look like I do but you see my brother and sister then God comes along and says I'll just share this with you hope that doesn't offend you no see it's Christ in you amen if we could catch a revelation of that scripture how our lives would be changed amen amen we would literally have the confidence to rebuke Satan any time anywhere any circumstance amen binding him yeah not in our name in his name amen hallelujah sister VI if you would come Lord help us to be bold amen I think it's time for us to be bold amen bold enough to claim every word amen I'm going to go back and just read this line again this little crosseyed negro man down there theza Street that had no more sense than to believe what God Said was the truth amen that's right we lift a hand and say Lord I want to be what the word says I am hallelujah
