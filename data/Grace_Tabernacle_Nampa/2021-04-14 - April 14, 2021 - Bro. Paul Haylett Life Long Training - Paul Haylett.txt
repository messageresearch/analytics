amen hallelujah good to be here tonight good to see each one of you amen praise the lord i want to speak to you tonight once again from the book of proverbs the 22nd chapter and i want to title this tonight lifelong training we will certainly take this scripture as you'll see here in a minute and it will be one that we fundamentally have known uh and uh but we're going to apply it in a a bigger uh um in a bigger way as we'll see just touching just a moment on the things that the prophet of god brings from these scriptures and lays out uh for us so let's just stand and go proverbs the 22nd chapter we'll read verses one through seven and then we'll move on in our thought tonight once again i say god bless you and happy to see each one of you those of you who might be online that couldn't make it tonight we just pray god would deal kindly with your hearts and meet you or whatever your need might be you know that's my brother and sister just to sidetrack for just a moment over and over and over the prophet of god reminds us speaks to us that god will meet our need so whatever our need is we need to have confidence that god will meet that need not not have a doubt not be in fear not questioning but just know with the confidence that god will meet our need and you know he says that you uh have not because you ask not and when you finally this is kind of my way i read that scripture when we finally get around to asking we don't even ask correctly by then we have like a selfish outlook we have a selfish motive where we're uh coming as beggars you might say instead of sons and daughters of god whatever it might be so tonight just remember that god has promised and as we'll close the service out today i trust the quote we'll read to you will be encouraging to your souls amen a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold the rich and poor meet together the lord is the maker of them all a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished by humility and the fear of the lord are riches honor and life thorns and snares are in the way of the froward he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender heavenly father we just ask you this evening lord as we just speak these simple words and thoughts father lord just ask you to bless them take them to the hearts of your children father we ask this in the name of jesus christ amen amen you may be seated we want to just go down through these actually six verses tonight uh the seventh um a little ahead of myself in my notes but the seventh i i trust lord willing uh to uh uh maybe have this next week to speak on that because certainly we know that the rich rule over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender and so that will be maybe a topic lord willing have you ever noticed that the older you get the more the lord willing becomes a part of your words when we're young not arrogant not meaning to be outside of the prophet's words but when we're young we're just we're going to do this but as you get older maybe you pick up a newspaper or you get a text an email a phone call and people your age have went beyond the curtain and you start to realize you know what god's in in control god said but we start to realize the element of our mortality and you know it it's then that it's much simpler it seems to put that into our conversation as the word says as the lord wills you know if we're going to be here next wednesday lord willing we'll preach on the borrower and the lender amen now we look at this my brother and sister and i just want to go through these verses here for a few minutes a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold and you know it's just really hard to place a value on a good name you look at this world that we live in today and as we were speaking to the young people they're going to go to camp we just ask them to to you know remember that they will put that reputation or identity to their name by their behaviors and and uh you know i say that just because i feel like it's my job to say that to our young people we have a good group of young people i have confidence in them but you know we have to recognize that a a bad reputation is hard to live down one's life can change one's circumstance can change but certain things would then follow that person and so it's just really you know as the scripture says a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and you know it'd be really hard to place a value on a good name but we know right here according to the scripture that great riches is lower than a good name and so lord help us not to worry about the riches but to have a good name and as we were looking this last sunday sharing in the scripture you know our whole goal our desire is to please the lord and we come short but god has provided a way for us and so we recognize my brother and sister that loving favor now you know i have in my own natural life can look back and you know often times you hear people say well you know the prophet of god kind of showed us scripture declares that you know someone who does something good to you a a glass of cold water uh you know that that that could grant them eternal life and i have heard that and seen that used in in just uh many many examples that i i'll be honest with you'll be truthful i felt like they had taken it out of context you know uh and i know folks and i'm not judging them but i just want to make example to you that have that down to almost if someone holds the door for you hey they're going to have eternal life they did something good for me now my brother and sister will understand that there's going to be circumstances that we cannot judge it's beyond our comprehension of what god means when he's talking about those that have been good to the bride of christ we we can't go out and start judging that by by these little things in our life i have a good friend and i say good friend because i base that on relationship in the past we don't rub shoulders too much anymore but there was a time in my life he did tremendous favors for me and we're talking about in the financial realm uh he gave me opportunities to get into the trucking business and and there was a season in our life that that made a tremendous financial difference and he never charged me i i run if you understand that business i ran under his authority for several years before he helped me or encouraged me to to uh file for our own and and it made a great difference uh this man my brother and sister i don't know how god will judge him but this man is a man who loves to drink and he loves to party and he loves his jokes and he loves his movies and whatever it is and and i will not judge him i i actually am very fond of this man but you know it'd be easy to say well because of what he did made such a difference in my financial life our world at that time that god is going to grant eternal life to him i don't know but let's not forget the very fundamental foundation of it all is that we have to change amen we have to go from the sinner nature into the nature of a son or daughter of god and as brother david and i was talking this sunday the only way you're going to do that is be born again you know there's no shortcut there's no golden whatever there's no lottery to win my brother and sister so we don't know what god's favor will be to these people who are good to the bride of jesus christ so let's not go where we don't know the answer let's not go out and create our own narrative of what it will mean but my brother and sister there will be those that will do things that grant them favor in god's eyes and he gives to them eternal life but you see we were something placed in our hearts in our soul uh that uh you might say even in our mind right because our thinking has to encompass this also my brother and sister we want a more sure word we're not here thinking if we can do a good deed as it were i do a good deed i do a good deed then i could make it in but you see god has placed something in you and i that has opened the door as we were talking about the key on sunday open the door to you and i to the word that we can step into that door which is beyond the veil amen and step into the presence of almighty god and understand the word and the revelation of that word brings life that is already in you brings it out and manifests itself as a rose would grow in the spring that rose my brother and sister is you still got four thorns on it got a lot of thorns in fact you got more thorns than you can imagine but what caps or crowns the thorns the rose hallelujah so we can choose to look at all the thorns in our lives or we can look at the beautiful rose as it were that god has brought forth out of us hallelujah my my brother and sister you never never never never saw a wife or girlfriend as far as that would go that would say oh my goodness you brought me one of those thorny plants no sir they look at roses and say that's beautiful thank you a sign of love a sign of appreciation you see the thorns are removed before they're presented i want you to think about that god's grace and mercy in our life the thorns are removed before we are presented oh thank you lord hallelujah now you know i hate to admit this uh sister jerry used to tell me i was a thief but um i i worked with a man and he lived in the uh town of caldwell and and i would pick him up we were doing construction work i would take him to boise every day and then on my way home i chose a different route because of the time of day to to drop him off at his house and then i would duck down some side streets and i would come down and there's a strange intersection in caldwell that actually has almost like three streets coming and one of them is at a tight angle and i would come up there and stop at the curb and i was doing construction work i had all kinds of sharp tools and in my mind i had it justified right that that i wasn't i wasn't doing anything wrong but these people have this big huge rose bush that span down their fence line right there on the street and the street i come up to the intersection on had very little traffic i would just stop get out of the pickup walk around there snip snip snip snip and then i would take this bouquet home to jerry well it didn't take my lovely life wife very long to figure out these didn't come from a flower shop because he still had thorns attached but you see my brother and sister it was the thought of the heart you know that i want to present that to her unfortunately i was too much of a cheapskate but anyway you look at this and my brother and sister you see how that in this favor that we find in the presence of god now this is something that we would look and i was just sharing you a brief example of man's favor i have been blessed and don't mean to focus it to me tonight but i have been blessed many times in my life of man's favor of people saying this is what we would like to do for you the property where sister jerry and i live now was the you might say the favor of of a lady a landlord that uh you know we have done just simple things through the years been good stewards of her land good stewards of taking care of her making sure you know if her furnace ran out of oil that we would fill it up for her without any cost or these kind of things and she come along and says i want to sell this to you and she sold it to us in a fashion my brother and sister that would be undeniably a favor of man undeniably something that she did that was out of the ordinary and those are wonderful and i i'm thankful she has passed on now and so i'm i'm very thankful for what she's done and we can probably all look in our life and make a you know example to ourself of favor that man has done for us and we'll look at that and say thank you and you know don't know what kind of reward as i was saying that god might grant to them and all of that is well and good but there's nothing like living in god's favor there's nothing like living in the presence of almighty god knowing that the blessings are pouring from heaven and as that song says i i'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed there's nothing like that and you might say well we're going through hard times or have gone through hard times uh we're struggling with certain things my brother and sister if you will stop you will recognize in a world where satan hates you more than anything he wants to destroy you more than anything that you are as an overcomer living under god's favor it is there that god is constantly pouring blessings out protecting you i don't know if god will choose to but if so one day we will be there in heaven and as it were maybe that great film of our life would roll and you would look and say i never knew i never knew remember we were preaching the other day that it wasn't whether the angels was there or not is whether they could see them and so it's there that we know my brother and sister that god has got a whole protective hedge around us his favor his angels are here with us and we look at that and realize that we are living in god's tender favor and the tender hand of jehovah now you know when i was younger i struggled with this to understand how as brother branham talked about the holocaust what happened to the jews was the tender hand of jehovah and we would say well how could that be the tender hand of jehovah but god knew what it would take to fulfill his word and to cause them to pull their roots up from wherever they were at and go back to the promised land and so to god that was tinder that he brought them as a people back to their land now my brother and sister we as sons and daughters of god have a promise it is not as it were a land but it is a position in christ and we have been given that and god by his tender mercies the tender hand of jehovah will bring you and i to that position that we belong in amen you say well we're having hard times don't worry god is just moving you coaching schooling you to get you ready for the position he called you for oh hallelujah that's hard sometimes when times are struggled you know it's uh you know i was at work today and you know somebody asked me says well how's your day going and i said which part the bad part or the worst you see some days feel like that my brother and sister maybe it's just the devil wanting to get us a place that we won't step up and claim victory when we come to the house of god maybe he wants to show up on wednesday night and let you walk into the house of god or you might say force you to walk in the house of god and then instead of just being able to move in a position of worship you've got to fight off spirits and you've got to fight off an attitude and and whatever it is so that you can break through into the presence of the word you see my brother and sister oftentimes will view that and say well i'm just not seeming to be very spiritual if god would open your eyes and you would see the host of hell trying to destroy you and open our eyes to see the host of heaven who is guarding and lifting you up oh my it's a warfare my brother and sister this is not a game of go to church or not go to church this is a game my brother if you would put it that way that this is the fight the game the final warfare of the final age my brother and sister and satan says i've only got one last chance to tear up this bride of christ i can only get to her one last time and he's pouring all he's got into it now pardon me for using this as an example but i just happened to be in a store the other day and and there was a a a tv playing there or maybe it was a restaurant i don't remember maybe it was a restaurant oh i know what it was texas roadhouse anyway right there there was a screen and there's a horse race and the horses are running around the track and all of you at some point in time would have seen or understand that and they're just running running running and here's this horse that they were like well he was all favored to win you know he was favored to be this and that and but look at him he's three links back and he's the sister kerry would understand this you know he's so many furlongs you know he's behind and look at the leader look at the stride that he's got and and a stride like we've never seen in this horse before and and look at them coming the rounding the last turn oh wait oh wait look at him look at him he's straightened suddenly lengthen his stride he's suddenly putting oh my look at the effort the jockey is not even in control that horse is running it looks like he's running from his heart he's gaining he's gained a link he's gained two links he's coming oh they got so excited and my brother and sister when the other horse was giving out that horse was still accelerating and i thought there it is hallelujah when the religious are petering out there they're fading the bride of christ who must not look might not have looked spectacular to the world she's gaining more strength as she comes to the end of this race because this is the word coming to life in her hallelujah she doesn't say well i guess it was all this this and i guess it really wasn't nothing at all no there's something in her that identifies oh pardon me for saying it this way but let it just be strong it's no longer this is brother branham's message my brother and sister this was the message of jesus christ to the bride of christ amen it has went beyond a man it has moved into the spiritual element of god speaking to his bride hallelujah when she hears that voice no doubt that jockey which was some famous jockey with many wins they said oh it's his habit to talk to the horse in the final run there and i can just hear him purring in that horse's ear you can do it you can do it come on come on you can do it the mother jockeys i like this i'm not really a horse person those of you that know me but i like this these other jockeys are whipping their horses come on are you with me but he didn't have to whip his horse he was whispering he was speaking to his horse they said he has words that he speaks to his horses encouraging words you can do it you're a winner run run run for your life run my brother and sister i think we're not coming in the season of whipping of the bride of christ but the words of encouragement we're coming down in a final stage a race you can do it doesn't mean that every day seems like a good day but we can live in god's favor now look what brother branham says here in birth pains now this church is supposed to get a sign its last sign we find out here in the scriptures see now the great birth pains that's being in this layout to see an age it's boring i'm not sure exactly i'm not grasping that quite but their church is being born again not not they'll never be another organization anyone knows that every time a message went forth asked this historian after a message went forth an organization come up out of it that's right now we're not going to go into that but i just want you to be aware that spirit has showed up in the message it wants us to organize but my brother and sister i believe what the prophet of god said here it will not be the bride of christ that organizes it will be people around the world just as it was with luther that it wasn't about luther but it was about the fanaticism that come around it right you go back and find that what the prophet of god says about it see we we want to be fanatical about what we believe without being fanatics you understand what i mean amen we want to be sold out to what we believe without turning it into some kind of ism come up out of it oh alexander camel everything campbell everything else martin luther and everything they made an organization out of it and usually a message only goes for about three years of revival this has been going for 15 years and there's been no organization come from it why the shock was the last we're at the end now i'm going to say kind of strong words here those who want to pull the message into organization my brother and sister are actually shocked the seed wants to be exposed to the sun the seed is not afraid of the presence of the sun because the seed knows the sun is what ripens her to bring her to full maturity [Music] hallelujah so as we look at this my brother and sister i i see it's just such a beautiful time for our day see the birth pain see what's the matter just a remnant will be brought out just a remnant will be brought out and that's why i'm crying and straining and pushing and laying aside every favor of man on earth to find favor with god and just moving on in his word amen now does this mean we go out and insult and do no no it does not no but if we have to choose between satisfying what man thinks the message ought to be and what god sent the message my brother and sister we'll choose god's version hallelujah so we will lay aside every favor of man on earth to find favor with god and i believe this bride of christ is in that position because she has a revelation a key has been given to her and her life is now opened to the word and the word is open to her life right because the word that is calling her is the word that is in her it's not a different word my brother and sister the word that's calling her is the word that is in her amen right the prophet of god preaches this i'm not preaching something new amen the seed must be in us brother branham says it this way he says that if you are in god now you were always in him hallelujah thank you lord now you know i uh i like verse two the rich and poor meet together the lord is the maker of them all now my brother and sister talking about finding favor a person might find favor in his life and uh make some decisions what he thought were his own decisions and turn out they are god blessing or giving favor to them and maybe they are well off maybe they have you know a certain number excuse me a certain number of dollars in the bank and that might be multiples more than someone else but you see who we really are is defined by our spiritual position not our natural amen because if we go to hell with millions of dollars like the rich young ruler did it still is hell it's not hell with better accommodations it is not hell with a butler it's hell my so you see what happens is we want to be defined by our spiritual position of who we really are because the rich and poor meet together and the lord is the maker of them all now i want to i'll tie this together in just a minute on verse 4 as we'll get to it a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished you know this reminds me of a little bit of history i read here a while back about a family uh they were of mixed descent part jewish you know that wasn't even accepted in their day but you know they had a jewish mother gentile father the family had more or less accepted them but there was still a little friction and when the friction started to warm up in europe the dad he decided you know what we're going to do everything we can do to make it to america and while his wife was not too happy to leave her family all the circumstances worked out such that they were able to go i believe it was into austria from austria they were able to go to the united states and so now they're living in the united states in 1939 and things start to escalate in europe and before it's all over this man his wife and his children are all healthy here in america but grandparents aunts and uncles nieces nephews etc are purged from the face of the earth in germany and people would say you are lucky but the man would say no i'm not lucky i'm blessed because there was just as many voices saying don't go as there was saying go there was something inside of him saying we need to leave we need to go to america now we know america is not the answer for everything but at least to this point in time we can say it is one of the greatest places on earth to live and so it was there in a simple decision of go or not go that families are decimated or families are intact and so you see how in this times that we see that a prudent man foreseeth the evil my brother and sister the word says he hideth himself look at the day we're living look what's happening around us we have a hiding place hallelujah and so we can look by god's grace not just the whole world whole religious world is talking about oh america is doomed america's doomed and i was listening to a man the other day and i thought my goodness those are exactly the prophet's words this man is speaking out with no acknowledgement of the prophet but you know so be it he's there declaring what's happening judgment's fallen upon america they had an opportunity they've turned god down and now it's going to what it's going and it's there my brother and sister that you see that warnings going out but hardly anyone heeded noah go right on down through the scriptures you'll find in in all through the scriptures that god brother branham preaches it this way god always gives warning before judgment and so the warnings went out but all through the generations very few heeded the warning and god is showing us right here in the proverbs i believe it applies to our day i believe we can say that we are prudent men and women we see the evil and we hide ourself where do we hide ourself not in some place in the mountains not in some country somewhere my brother and sister we hide ourself in the rock christ jesus amen the simple pass on and are punished my breaks your heart i listened to a man the other day make a comment they're rioting in milwaukee it's hard to understand all that circumstance of that lady policeman we take the prophet's words this might sound harsh she should have never been a policeman she wouldn't be in her predicament today if she was a housewife at least i hope your sisters aren't tasing your children but you see it's there that we look at this and this man made a comment the rioting in milwaukee again he says why would anyone in their right mind lived there i couldn't question his judgment why would anyone in his right mind i say if they have any sense they'll move just not here forgive me for that little humor but my brother and sister you live there and they burn they burn the store across the street down last time and they rebuild it and they burn it down this time they're going to burn it down next time and they're going to burn it down the time after that they're going to burn it down and burn it down and burn it down because they've got a vice president that's saying they ought to do that they have a right to do that they should do that and we won't stop them yes my brother and sister aren't you glad our refuge is not here oh hallelujah amen oh hallelujah now verse four i really want to focus on verse four right here real quick you look at this now you see my brother and sister by humility and the fear of the lord are riches and honor and life now we take this back up into these verses the rich and poor meet together the lord is the maker of them all so what is real riches in the eyes of god it is not what you have in the bank it's not what i have in the bank or what we might acquire in a lifetime but riches in the eyes of god is by humility and fear of the lord are riches and honor and life and i tell you my brother and sister i'd rather be rich in god's eyes than to be rich in the eyes of the world amen you find that it's such a a different world that they live in they're constantly struggling and they have strife they have drama everyone thinks if i was rich i wouldn't have these problems no you would have them multiplied amen you see god's got a different matrix that he measures things by amen and we can only measure by the human matrix so we look at it from our eyes and let's be honest with one another tonight most of us would say we would be a little bit better off if we had a hundred or two or three or four or five hundred thousand more dollars that would solve some problems but the real problem we have the prophet of god i won't go into it tonight the real problem that we have the prophet said is us dying to ourselves i don't think a few hundred thousand dollars is going to help us die to ourself in fact i think it will revive life into this carnal man and carnal behaviors and carnal accomplishment so you see the greatest challenge we have is not really our finances of this life but is our humility and fear of the lord so it says by humility and the fear of of the lord are riches and honor in life now brother branham says here in uh uh influence don't you love influence it's a it's pretty awesome you know he preaches it several times but the crux of it all the overview of it all is just incredible to think how much influence now i read this article here recently it's talking about it and because we're not caught up in that world i sure hope we're not caught up in that world the movie theaters etc the research has showed that you know they'll play a movie in the theater and they will send these subliminal messages and suddenly everybody wants a coke and popcorn now they think it's just well this is what we do in the movie but that subliminal message that is sent is is speaking to them and more than faster than our comprehension can grasp it is the flicker or the presentation and that's exactly what satan does he he just brings it in in such a subtle fashion that people don't understand why they're influenced why they are and the prophet of god says you know that uh sons and daughters of god are not now help me with this my mind just is wanting to turn these words around amen brother brown talks about the glow versus the glare i think it is or is that right is that the right words help me brother david um see you know there's a glare in the world my brother and sister they they got their own to catch the attention but you see god's satisfied just to let the gospel glow in you and i we don't have to present ourselves as a you know this super spiritual that oh praise god you know i i ate a hamburger today and and praise the lord is the best hamburger ever praise the lord praise the lord we can just bless the food and eat the hamburger and say thank you lord for the food but yet you'll find there is this culture that everything is hyper spiritual but not lining up with the word right we want to line up with the word even if we don't look spectacular to everyone around us amen so we'll recognize that influence has has got a tremendous tremendous influence influence has a tremendous influence are you with me influence has a tremendous influence brother branham talks about jackie kennedy and her water head haircut talks about all this stuff we we just see the evidence of what he's talking about this one does it everyone does it i like that quote where brother brown talks about how you know the pastor's wife sister jerry please stand up this is like not in your life buddy but you see saints i'm glad that we're in a church that's not looking to copy or impersonate right yeah sister jerry can be sister jerry and every one of you sisters will be yourself i i'm assuming something here don't want to be presumptuous uh sister jerry's lovable she's kind she's caring she's considerate but she's not your god i want to look at her life and say you know what good sister just what paul needed sassy and everything anyway but look at this look at this what influence does the church where is she getting her influence it should be the holy spirit coming down in her midst now the prophet of god showed us that the holy spirit was timid amen so it's not boisterous it's not boastful it's not due then now look what brother braham says right here in influence we haven't got now go back and read the whole thing about this okay i'm not i i'm pulling this little piece out because obviously we can't quote the whole thing and this whole sermon ties together we haven't got to humility we don't want to and people don't you go sometime to a real well-dressed people in the church they'll come in and if you're not dressed just right you wonder why i use that example they'll look at you and talk you know and and it makes it they they shouldn't do that professing christianity i think it's just profession and not a possession because i believe that a real old-time experience with god will make a tuxedo coat put his arms around a pair of overalls oh i want that to be the spirit of grace tabernacle if you get a few extra dollars in your bank account and you buy something and you like that let not that be something that causes some kind of rift and riffle and ruffle and whatever else old time experience god will make a tuxedo coat put his arms around a pair of overalls and say brother i really believe it it's true a calico dress with a silk one we'll call sister yes sir because it isn't the clothes it isn't the person it's christ what's on the inside and we should humble ourselves you see we're laying a little foundation to get to our thought here in just a minute now my brother and sister see we should humble ourselves so we don't become lifted up now what happens is god is schooling us there are so many quotes tonight i could i could preach you guys till one in the morning here there's so many things associated with this but the prophet of god is laying a foundation that is talking about schooling it's talking about causing us to learn it's about god correcting us and here it is my brother and sister that we'll see in these thoughts brother branham uses the word child training which we will use in a quote here in just a minute so we think oh my goodness and i've preached here a little bit and i want to just focus on this for a minute as parents with children we must realize that what we are doing sometimes seems so so like well i i just want to let little bobby go ahead and and just eat that candy or i want him to just go ahead and be sassy it's kind of cute but what we don't realize is we're holding a child's future in our hands and we're going to create a child that can be selfish can be all kinds of of uh characteristic characterizations you know what i mean you know they can be impatient and greedy and ungodly because we thought it was so cute or we just didn't want to do that we don't believe in spank the child we don't believe in and spare the rod we will believe that we can talk to it i always many years ago listening to brother donnie preached it just tickled me you know we already were applying something besides this grounding and brother donnie preaching one time says thou you parents that think about this grounding you put little bobby in the corner or whatever he says you ground electricity you use a rod on your children there weren't a lot of amens because we want to ground our children now you just go sit there for five minutes now look i'm not preaching to no family or nothing i'm actually my point is not even in the children so much here tonight but my brother and sister we must realize we actually hold their future look at the time that a child is a child if you want to take it all the way to the legal age of 18 you're talking only at best a quarter of their life is a child and so what we do in that quarter of their life will have this tremendous influence on the rest of their life we can pamper our children because we didn't have it good we're going to make it so good for them we don't want our children to mow the lawn we don't want them to do dishes they don't have to vacuum i had to do that they don't have to do that what you're doing is passing your own uh conflict and your uh what is the word i'm trying to think of complex into the child and you're thinking you're doing them a favor but the favor is teach them how to work teach them how to be respectful teach them how to be obedient teach them how to be stewards teach them these things because if god was to spare their life you are only touching their life for that brief season and then we wonder why we have 45 year olds can't hold a job can't do anything right and mama feels so bad for him she lets him live in the basement come on come on saints so i just want to speak to you church and those that might hear this as hard as it is for you to take little bobby and make a little bobby do what he's supposed to do and do it in a respectful fashion and you say i just it's so hard to do that if you don't want to spoil that child you will buckle down your own self and you will pray through and ask god's wisdom on how to deal with that child because you're not actually raising a good child you're raising a good adult unless of course you want them to remain a child in your basement see that's the point that we have right when we failed it all else we feel guilty come on we feel guilty and therefore we make excuses the rest of their life or the rest of our life ouch now you know as we'll do this i understand you know train up a child the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it this wasn't just locked into spiritual things come on do you believe in allowances one of the greatest things you can do for your child is give them an allowance kill kids amen make them work for it make them budget their allowance i'm paying tithe i'm setting aside savings i have something i'd like to buy i set up a portion there and well my children shouldn't have fine you're going to teach them their whole life i shouldn't have to work for it it should just show up now let's take this over in a spiritual realm for just a moment we're going to teach our kids that somehow or another god's obligated now i believe god promised to provide for us amen he will provide for us but we can teach our children the difference of that stewardship of the word that god will provide for us but when it comes to these things if you need healing pray for healing don't think it's just gonna show up for church amen you need a deliverance you pray for deliverance don't think it's just going to show up at church you see there's a portion that we have to give back and the training will determine how when that child becomes an adult he looks at the plan of god my brother and sister i have prayed for people in different parts of the country not here in this church and they are like i don't know why god hasn't healed me and you're right there thinking this person has an attitude towards god come on my brother and sister when we finally asked the scripture says we ask amiss so it's now of demand that god heal me no sir what we need to do is stand as confident christians mom dad i took the trash out i mowed the yard i vacuumed the floors i did dishes everything that is the agreement of my allowance there's nothing wrong then for the child to walk to the parent and say i'd like my allowance i have fulfilled everything that was asked of me now you can come as i hope you understand my mixing of spiritual and natural you can come boldly to the throne and say mom and dad that whatever it is i don't want to see my number in case it's twice as much as you pay your kids but you can stick your hand out children when you have satisfied what your agreement for your allowance is you can put your hand out and say mom and dad i would like my allowance it is friday afternoon i've done everything that i was supposed to do this week with confidence now do you follow me tonight we can approach god in that same fashion lord i have come and according to your word amen i've repented i've been baptized i've got the holy ghost i've come in the right attitude i've come in the right spirit i've come in the right motive and i'm standing on the promise of god because i believe it now lord i need a deliverance i need a healing i got a child that needs healing i got a child that needs deliverance i'm standing on your word lord amen and god will not deny you hallelujah amen oh hallelujah hallelujah but you see my brother and sister the only way we're going to come to that is by training that's right you're not going to just have a bunch of converts come to the message sit down in the church and just got faith to stand up and take the word of god if they come out of i was talking with a nephew of mine i don't know if he'd ever listen to a service if he is god bless him but we are talking and i told him i said one of the biggest uh you know misleading things the denominational churches are doing is they're teaching everybody they're they're preaching about the promises of god are here the blessings of god are here all of this has been provided for us but we're broken we're broken we're broken when we fail god understands because we're broken well i'm sorry the blood of jesus christ come wash my sin away and i am not broken any longer amen because the blood of jesus christ has fixed me now you say but brother paul i still struggle with certain things that's right but if you'll look at that in that fashion amen i am already delivered i am already healed i'm already a conqueror you have to speak to your confession to what you believe what you want amen hallelujah so when we can do that we can we can take a hold of that but how does that happen only if we have been trained amen now my brother and sister i can find this quote if i moved it up or down right here here we go so once again let me just backtrack just a little bit here it might seem as though we're being hard on our own child but the term that they use is the formative years why would they use that term because it's the time of molding it's the time of preparation for the real world once again let me reiterate this we actually hold the quality of their future amen in our hands amen now this doesn't mean that you can't pour your heart out and do the best you can do and a child make terrible decisions and go off and have to take a rough road and whatever and it also i i happened to have friends that grew up parents were alcoholics smoked like chimneys and did whatever they don't drink they don't smoke they go to church their families mock them i made a reference about them the other day you know as one out of the whole group you're the reject and there that's fine i've rejected everything satan has offered me that's how they look at it my brother and sister we're not trying to make some very fixed hard thing here but you'll understand the influences that we have on our children and it's there once again let me just go down through this selfish impatient greedy ungodly there's influences in the life that causes them to be attracted or go that direction now my brother and sister i'll just throw this in as a balancing factor i know this uh situation i wouldn't say i really know these people but i know them well enough to identify them if i wanted to uh and uh the parents uh message believers uh still message believers to this day but they were so hard on their children it was unreal now gabriella's gonna just become my example a little bit you look so worldly with that strand of hair hanging over your eyebrow don't ever want to see that like that ever again you got a spirit on you now imagine a child right just i don't know why do you have that strand of hair did it fall down or did you put it there girl oh i don't mean to embarrass you it's cute but you see my brother and sister you are you following me when you hammer down on that child that every little thing they do you've somehow got secret sin you've got secret this you've got and just hammer down hammer down pretty soon that child is going to become what those parents were telling that child they were amen now let's just say for the sake of example that gabriella had a few things in her life that maybe weren't lining up so good we tell her she's a wrong no good child or we can raise up a standard and say these things you're doing sweetheart we're not gonna do any good for you in your life that's right pray about it think about it we love you just want the best for you but we have to tell them the truth amen right we can't sugarcoat it till all they know is the sugar amen and you know what's wild is they're a whole lot smarter than we think they are and they know whether we're sincere or not that's it so you see when a child is beaten on after a while they tend to pull back from that what we really want to do is pull them to it amen and you do that by one pastor church you live an example that our young people or anyone else would say you know what i want to be like i can see me living that kind of life sister jerry can i tell on you sunday morning we're there she'd curled her hair now please don't judge her on this this i'm i'm getting off in the personal stuff here she'll probably not forgive me for a few days i come walking in there and she's standing in front of the mirror and her hair is all curled up and she turns around and goes do i look too worldly now take it with humor because i haven't done my hair like this like since i was a young girl and i was thinking mommy she's cute but my brother and sister you see if we want what'd the prophet god tell us we do for change we pray we don't ridicule we don't cast down we pray amen there's where the realm of our influence comes into play that's where we make a difference in people's lives now look like i said let me reiterate this to you you can't sugarcoat it you can't keep sugar coating it oh sweetie you know oh son you know we've placed the token on you just do whatever you want because the token's on you you'll be all right god will bring you back nonsense nonsense we have an obligation to train them up even if they make decisions we don't like remember they're going to come back because of the training if it was true on his sincere training now in the message the job here 1955 brother brown says child training that's what it is you believe in the scriptural trial child trial child training the bible speaks of training a child with tutors and so forth bringing him up straightening him up straighten up giving him what he belongs that's what's the matter tonight preacher says let the congregation get by with anything they need a little child training now i ask you honestly just speak out i i'm just is he talking about the congregation they need a little child training or is he talking about the preacher i think both because one the preacher is part of the congregation so now we've got the preacher letting the congregation get why by with things right the sugar coating praise the lord you're the biggest tithe pair in the church you can kind of get by with that well i tell you what we'd be better off by god's grace to be back in a living room preaching the truth than to be in a great big church and letting the biggest tithe payer do whatever they want because we're afraid to leave [Music] i'll tell you i'll just give you a brief little story about this i'll be vague enough you hopefully can't figure it out but there was a brother in the message got caught up in that spirit by god's grace he got delivered from that so they started preaching in such a fashion and they traded a church and they moved and they built this big beautiful lovely church 10 000 a month mortgage and he found himself under this anointing softening up the message just a little bit because they needed every ounce of money they could collect to pay for their church but there was a brother in that church that owned a very large business a business that was did business in the millions and him and his family sat down and said my our pastors compromised on the message there's no way we can stay here a man who paid almost ten thousand dollars a month into the church and he says we've got to go to a church where they preach the word amen see how that boomeranged on that brother he compromised because he's worried about making his church payment but when he did there was real believers that says we don't want to go to a church that's compromised and the brother found himself in a worse position by god's grace god dealt with him amen we have a lovely church he's well respected pastor amen sometimes we have to go to child training because we're his children we're sons and daughters of god god's not going to just say well you made that decision i'm going to let you go god calls to all work out giant bigger pentecostal church in their in their area was looking for a bigger church and somehow a real estate agent said how about you talk to you and somehow or another i have no idea what the details say they have now this big church and they have a church over here and all is well the lesson was learned because god loves us he child trains us amen so i think tonight that we're going to take this position that the pastor is not going to let the congregation get by with anything how about we just settle on that one amen they need a little child training that's right that's what's the matter with the world today the reason they got so much in the natural juvenile delinquency we need some child training i think it's a lot of parent delinquency now i want to look at this we're coming down this one quote this reason i cherry pick this and i'll be honest about that i cherry picked it is because we have preacher delinquency we have parent delinquency and we've got child delinquency now which one of those is going to be where the guilt rests on the child but in reality it rests here or should i say here you see how it is though but when a child goes in a position everybody will say is just a bad child but how was he trained a delinquent preacher preached to delinquent parents and produced a delinquent child and then the child gets blamed for it and ends up wherever down in juvie hall hmm my oh my look at this i hear my son-in-law isaac talk about blockchain blockchain this blockchain that amen you brothers that are talking about all these cryptocurrencies and all these kind of things you know i forget the name of that that one everybody knows about what's that one everybody bitcoin yeah amen i'll tell you what my brother and sister you talk about a ponzi scheme people have shoveled out money like you can't believe to buy something they can't see taste smell or hear and when that thing one day goes poof they're gonna go how could this happen my fifty dollars turned into a million and now it's gone how could this happen was it ever there was it ever there hmm excuse me but look at this a block chain of events reiterating preacher delinquency church delinquency parent delinquency child delinquency comes down saints let me throw this out i'm running out of time fast here but let me throw this out do you know whenever you see a a uh dominating spirit nicolaitan spirit comes and it starts and it works its way into the church now i'm going to take this from a reverse thinking than most of you whose fault is that well it's got to be the preacher he's the one that's trying to dominate it no no it's your fault it's your fault your fault your fault your fault because when that moves away from the word you've got to stand up and say stop this is not right oh but we got to honor the pastor you are you are when they're drifting off the word and you come in the right spirit and the right attitude and the right way and say you know what brother we we that is not right it doesn't line up with the word you are actually coming but come respectful right but you see we want to blame the preachers well he was a nicolaitan preacher he calls that to happen the people had to receive the people had to receive it so if it's not on the word don't receive it amen and you know what we can start by pushing back in prayer that's right we don't always have to have a revolt and a written deal and take sides and draw a line down the middle of the church and cause a big deal split families and do all kinds of no start in prayer get serious before god god correct that man draw him right back to the center of the word the preachers let the congregation get by with anything we don't want to be that kind of church let's all submit ourselves to child training amen so that we can going back to the blockchain again we can not have preacher delinquency we will not have church delinquency we will not have parent delinquency and we will not have child delinquency if we just follow the word amen let's not forget my brother and sister the plan of god works that's the truth of it right amen now let's look at this one last quote we'll go through real quick here our foundation stands sure now remember what i've been preaching tonight some people might take that and say well brother paul kind of preached a negative deal now actually i'm telling you since i'm coming from my heart very positive i'm telling you it positively works if we follow the word of god it positively will produce families that will be glued together by the word of god and there will be this mutual respect because remember our children grow up to be adults and someday we'll have to face them good or bad as an adult now my children will always be my children my daughter is sitting here tonight i look at her i wait i don't look at her as an adult did i i said my daughter which speaks of oh how is that word a subjugated form of dominion i don't care she will always be my daughter now i can say that she will always be my daughter amen or she will always be my daughter but regardless i will face her i do face her as an adult my daughter if she was to tell you tonight she could recount to you many of her father's failures and shortcomings but i believe i can speak from my heart on this that we have resolved those things she's my daughter and i'm proud of her i love her i think she loves me and is proud of me i know she loves me i think she's proud of me do you follow me tonight you see we'll face our children not always as children but we'll face them as adults and as an adult they will judge you from adult to adult you did this you did that i did yes you did okay now look where we stand with god our foundation stands sure the foundation of god god laid in zion the cornerstone there we are can't slip can't slide can't move then we come into the door through christ put in here oh we may have our ups and downs along that's true enough sicknesses and troubles but remember there's a great company of angels all along the road bear thee up at any time so we're having troubles but we've got angels bearing us up taking you up when you fall oh yes he's there he promised it he had to make a way of it so the only way he could make was the cornerstone the precious stone the tried stone the elect and the name of the lord is a mighty tower the righteous run in at it and are saved that's right safe nothing can bother you any more now look my brother and sister i want to go back and reiterate this before we move on our ups and downs our sickness and our troubles but brother branham then moves right from the ups and the downs in sickness and troubles to the fact that we have a band of angels that god has placed around us to bear us up have you ever come to a place you're just like i can't go any further no life i just lowered my mind my i just i can't do it and in a little bit you just feel something and you just feel that what is that god coming down amen whether you want to take it in that literal form some people say well i'd be the holy ghost well that's fine take it that way take it as abandoned age take it any way you want it's god it's god bearing you up satan's saying i've got them they're going to crash and the angels come right in just start holding start comfort can i put it to you this way start making love to you oh some people get all weirded out about that i'm sorry you do because that's god they're just an extension of god himself and they start to make love to you they start to remind you god loves you you're part of the plan of god and they start bearing you up some people get nervous about that i don't know how they reconcile themselves to be the bride of christ maybe i should pass on that the name of the lord is the mighty tower the righteous run in at it and are safe that's right safe nothing can bother you anymore you're in the rock it's not whether you hold now it's whether the rock holds hallelujah aren't you glad tonight it's not about how strong i am how great a christian i am how this and how that it's how he has a holds of us oh thank you lord oh my oh my and the rocks done held so then you are safe nothing can harm you nothing can come to you unless god permits it and if along the road something is done testing and trying in you your trial child training as you go along remember his angels will bear you up hallelujah oh my goodness you know i love this when i see parents they correct a child instead of then giving a boot to them and sending them off they might spank that child and then they wrap their arms around that child i know a man that his idea is you know what you whip the kid and you stuff him in a corner and you let him know you're unhappy with him well that might work for him but i wonder if that might be that individual's view of god i don't want god whipping me and stuffing me in a corner i want when god corrects me i love hearing the word come along and remind me right after oh you know what you guys think that the preacher standing up here never gets a hide tour off of him oh my goodness my brother and sister let me don't feel sorry for me i'm gonna make a fact to you and that is is when you tear the height off of yourself it's not a good feeling because it's pretty hard saints to preach the word straighten it tear the height off of you then run out here and go that's just your opinion doesn't work that way come on amen these angels will bear you up angels to come for you angels to give you faith angels to move you along god's got a host of angels all up and down the ladder now he had to made a way for this and he made it through christ now when christ every time that god made a promise he had to make a way for this promise we've got a promise tonight sister amy would you come hallelujah saints amen i say don't spare the rod because if you start praying and demanding a little soft soap sugary preacher then you're going to become a spoiled church and then everything will offend you and you won't overcome nothing amen we don't want to be beaten right we don't want to come to church to be beaten but i tell you i want to hear the truth i want to hear the truth when other brothers preach oh i tell you what my brother and sister i'm sorry to promote somebody else's preaching but you know our brother andrew glover preached down at evening light fellowship or tabernacle or whatever brother tim pruitt's church here a few weeks ago and i'm telling you it's powerful he just laid it right on the line he didn't spare nobody he didn't spare himself he didn't spare nothing he just preached the truth their easter meetings brother ron spencer i i'm here again i'm not trying to promote anybody but i'm telling you there was some preaching there that was just straightforward it's time some of you quit denying the devil access it's time for some of us to stand up and say enough is enough it's time for some of us to say that's mine and i'm willing to fight for it it's time for some of us to stand up and say you know what i've got the word i've got the truth i've got the life and now it's time for me to display it amen there's a time there's a season amen the morning is coming my brother and sister and god is in control and it's time for us to not sit back and say well if god wants it to be he's already gave you the word he's already told you what what the promise is he's already told you what he has in store for you it's time for us now to stand up and say lo lord if i am not taking what is mine then correct me lord give me the unction he says right here in this quote right that he'll give you faith and he'll do all of these things for you my brother and sister it's right there in the word now it's time for us to accept the word of the lord the corrective word and come and say you know what lord you're right i'm not acting on what you have given me lord i'm not taking what you have provided lord i'm not gonna let the devil whisper in my ear anymore amen can someone say amen to that i'm certainly saying amen to that and we stand on that word and when we take a step we need a confidence right i remember one time a brother i'll just share this little example a brother come to me and he said brother paul i i was preaching different church he said brother paul i've been praying about this certain move in my life this certain step in my life and i can't get an answer and i want you to pray with me that god will give me an answer and i just asked him i said brother tell me about it he starts telling me about the situation and saints all i can say is an inspiration come over me and i asked the brother i said brother have you pushed on the door oh no brother i won i said [Music] her chance then under free moral agency god unlocked the door and then just waited to see what you would do you say well i believe god wants me to do this if you believe it your motive is right your objective is right it's not against the will or the word of god i said maybe brother god's waiting for you the brother let me know a few months later he said brother paul i went and i prayed about it i woke up in the middle of the night and it seemed like a voice told me push on the door he said i pushed on the door and it opened and god has blessed me and my family and everything i had a desire for saints the word says god would grant to you the desires of your heart you know why he said he could do that because he knew you wouldn't come along and say i need a 5 000 square foot house i need a lamborghini i need a ski boat and i need a this and i need a latin he knew that when you got the desire of your heart you would be lord i want more of you i want more of you lord i desire more of you i want to live a life lord that pleases you and my brother and sister i used that example of that brother i had nothing to do with it as an inspiration come amen an unction come to say those words but the brother shares he says i pushed on the door it opened and god has blessed my family and now i have a job that i can do this and have time for devotions and time to make it to wednesday night and sunday and to church things and all of this stuff he said god but i was standing there waiting for god to open the door you see my brother and sister sometimes god wants you to just take him at his word take him in his promise he said i'll provide for you hallelujah that provision doesn't have to be a midnight job but people like jewel forney another brother that i know got witness to on swing shift some crazy crazy religious man everybody said watch out for that guy they've assigned you to his station watch out for him he's religious and he's like okay he's religious i can stay away from him i gotta stay away from you i gotta get away from this guy and the more he tried to get away from that guy the more he got full back to him and right after he accepted jesus christ as his lord and savior and got baptized that preacher man who happened to pastor a little message church got promoted to day shift [Music] now tell me god doesn't know where to find us hallelujah all saints look he's got angels to give you faith angels well let me go back just read it to you angels that'll bear you up angels to comfort you angels to give you faith angels to move you along god's got a host of angels all up and down the ladder it isn't i've been a christian my whole life i don't need encouragement come on saints many of us been christians for a long long long time and the battle's still real but don't worry about it god's still real and he's right here to bear you up whatever you need hallelujah you love the lord my redeemer [Music] i don't know what what key is it brother jason's like now brother paul if you'll do your homework you'll know what key to start in but i just know you start everything in f amen hallelujah [Music] oh let's just stand standing just praise the lord
