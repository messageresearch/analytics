[35:32] life
[35:36] away amen isn't it beautiful the Lord
[35:39] gives us this
[35:41] opportunity to just be able to come and
[35:45] just literally give our life away but
[35:49] really what we're doing we're not just
[35:50] simply giving it away but we're giving
[35:52] it back amen we came from him and the
[35:55] word says we go to him and so in that we
[35:59] realize that we have just this lovely
[36:03] opportunity
[36:05] of
[36:07] um giving it back to him well pray for
[36:10] my iPad here I keep pushing on my sermon
[36:14] and it goes to a different sermon
[36:17] amen
[36:19] amen well praise the Lord good to be
[36:21] here tonight is it not amen just to be
[36:23] as Sons and Daughters of God gathered
[36:26] together with family and uh just a
[36:28] beautiful time let's just stand as we
[36:31] would go into this scripture tonight I
[36:33] want to say thank you brother Alex I
[36:35] really enjoyed that and uh musicians
[36:38] thank you so much for the beautiful
[36:40] music the gift that God has given you to
[36:43] share uh we sure appreciate that amen
[36:46] appreciate each one of you coming out
[36:48] tonight I know the little sickness bug
[36:50] has been you know moving around trying
[36:53] to afflict us and I just um uh uh you
[36:57] know myself just kind of sometimes you
[37:00] know you just as you're working or doing
[37:02] you just suddenly kind of just don't
[37:03] feel good and boy you just have to stop
[37:07] and it's pretty easy to say oh I'm going
[37:08] to be sick but it's a lot harder but
[37:12] more fruitful to say I rebuke this in
[37:14] the name of Jesus Christ and we thank
[37:16] the Lord for the opportunity and uh
[37:18] tonight I trust that I can express this
[37:21] in a in a correct fashion I hope it's
[37:24] encouraging amen I have been studying
[37:26] the sermon thirst and I would encourage
[37:29] you Brother David as I was sharing the
[37:32] other day I I said oh ien and brother
[37:34] David's like wow me too and and uh so I
[37:37] would encourage you to go it's very
[37:41] straightforward uh but the thing is the
[37:44] the very bride of Christ that's the
[37:46] beauty of the Bride is that even when
[37:49] she has to say outou she says thank you
[37:51] right on the heels she's never like I
[37:53] can't deal with this she's like thank
[37:55] you Lord I Need needed to hear that and
[37:58] I believe the sermon thirst is right
[38:00] along that line he he talks about uh a
[38:03] lot of things very directly and I
[38:05] believe that it really is is a a an
[38:08] outstanding sermon in the sense that
[38:11] let's forget about denomination let's
[38:13] forget about everybody else out there uh
[38:16] he's just reminding you and I that when
[38:19] we have a thirst amen it wasn't for Leo
[38:22] to seea to satisfy it wasn't for you
[38:24] know uh some other thing you know know
[38:27] sometimes uh you know I kind of jokingly
[38:30] put this sometimes you know uh we hear
[38:34] the word maybe in our household of
[38:37] retail therapy and um you know sometimes
[38:40] we do things that just kind of we do it
[38:43] because we kind of feel good about doing
[38:45] it right and um you know the thing is
[38:48] the bride of Christ she she just
[38:51] worships the Lord she comes to the house
[38:53] of God she reads her Bible she gives
[38:57] praise to him because it makes her feel
[38:59] good and we're not talking about
[39:01] emotional feel good but something down
[39:03] in the soul that says that's the truth
[39:06] thank you Lord I needed to hear that
[39:09] that is good and brother Brown talks in
[39:11] the sermon thirst about feeding our soul
[39:13] and if we don't feed our soul he uses
[39:15] that natural example if you don't eat
[39:17] you die if you don't drink you die and
[39:19] uh and then he's saying you know what we
[39:21] need to be eating on the word we need to
[39:23] be drinking the word cuz that's where
[39:25] our life is at so I've been influenced
[39:28] by that Sermon Just a Little Bit let's
[39:29] turn in our Bibles uh I just want to go
[39:32] to Hebrews 5 and8 through 14 which we uh
[39:37] the last time I preached on a Wednesday
[39:40] we use this very scripture and we just
[39:43] want to expand or move on in in this
[39:46] thought a little bit um uh the overall
[39:49] thought of stepping out but tonight I
[39:52] have a question mark for you where is
[39:54] the proof
[39:57] so you know the world wants to know
[39:59] where the proof of all this is they want
[40:01] everything to be proven and you know
[40:03] sometimes we somebody' say where's the
[40:05] proof and maybe our first thought would
[40:07] be to go to the Bible we turn to Malachi
[40:09] 4 then we turn to Revelations 10:7 now
[40:13] my brother and sister those are very
[40:14] relevant to us but there's another proof
[40:18] which I pray the Lord will help us
[40:20] tonight to touch on that is a very
[40:23] evidence of a message that is real it's
[40:25] true it's power powerful it's effective
[40:28] and it's ours amen Hebrews
[40:33] 58-14 though he were a son yet learned
[40:36] he obedience by the things which he
[40:38] suffered and being made perfect he
[40:40] became the author of Eternal salvation
[40:43] to all that obey him that's verse n is
[40:46] our verse amen called of God a highest
[40:49] priest after the order of
[40:51] MDC of whom we have many things to say
[40:55] and hard to be uttered seeing you are
[40:57] dull of
[40:58] hearing and when for the time you ought
[41:02] to be teachers you have need that one
[41:04] teach you again which be the first
[41:06] principles of the Oracles of God and are
[41:09] become such as have need of milk and not
[41:11] of strong meat for everyone that useth
[41:14] milk is unskillful in the word of
[41:16] righteousness for he is a babe but
[41:20] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[41:22] of full age and I say thank you Lord
[41:25] even those who by reason of use have
[41:28] their senses exercised to discern both
[41:31] good and evil amen Lord we ask blessings
[41:33] on your word in the name of Jesus Christ
[41:35] amen you may be
[41:37] seated and I made this comment the other
[41:40] day and I make it again my brother and
[41:42] sister that one of the very essence of
[41:45] this is the fact that it is of reason of
[41:49] use now if we just have the word of God
[41:52] and we just look at it and we say okay
[41:54] we have the message we have it on a
[41:56] shelf we have it a library we have it on
[41:57] CDs we have it on a thumb drive we we
[42:00] have it however uh it won't be any good
[42:03] unless we use it that's right amen and
[42:05] and you know you can have uh uh I I I I
[42:09] take this as an example just recently I
[42:12] get many uh many uh text email stuff
[42:16] about auctions and uh you know recently
[42:19] there's a gentleman and uh and uh Eagle
[42:22] that um had quite a extensive uh
[42:25] carpentry tools he had planers and
[42:28] joiners and all of these very nice very
[42:31] nice tools and and I noticed that in
[42:34] that flyer it said um these tools are in
[42:38] presstine condition only been used a
[42:40] couple times and so you know you look at
[42:43] that and you Ponder why would a man
[42:45] spend probably close to $150
[42:47] $200,000 on all kinds of woodworking
[42:50] tools and only use it twice and I you
[42:53] know believe it or not I could recognize
[42:54] that I thought that's a man just like me
[42:57] you know I I I want to own this tool and
[43:00] then it turns out that all the grand
[43:02] plans I had didn't come to pass but we
[43:06] see my brother and sister that it is
[43:08] given to us to use amen and so this word
[43:12] that has come in this hour is not for us
[43:14] to set and hope that it is effective
[43:16] hope it would get us in a Rapture hope
[43:18] it'll help us overcome but it's right
[43:20] there for us to use and to take them and
[43:22] pick it up and in the time of trouble
[43:25] you know I I know it's a simple thought
[43:27] but remember those stones that were
[43:30] there in the streamed for David were
[43:33] predestinated Stones he didn't just
[43:35] accidentally pick up a stone and we'll
[43:38] look at that in all the types that are
[43:40] there you know five it goes along ways
[43:42] and we don't want to expound upon that
[43:44] but my brother and sister one of those
[43:46] five is trust amen and so it was there
[43:50] that not only did he have faith in what
[43:52] God had given him amen and it was our
[43:55] Lord Lord Jesus Christ that anointed him
[43:58] but he had to trust that what God was
[44:00] leading him to do was the correct thing
[44:03] and that's where we're at today we
[44:05] simply have to trust the Lord because
[44:07] sometimes our thinking will not be able
[44:10] to comprehend the path that God is
[44:12] taking us down but it's God's path not
[44:15] your path and we just need to trust him
[44:17] and so I was speaking on maturity a
[44:19] little bit on the last Wednesday I spoke
[44:22] and we'll look at this my brother and
[44:24] sister to recognize what maturity does
[44:26] for us and how that immaturity uh it
[44:30] causes a change in our life it it it uh
[44:33] it it brings responsibilities that
[44:36] sometimes can be quite weighty quite
[44:37] heavy but if we look in 1 Corinthians 13
[44:41] and9 uh through 13 uh 1 Corinthians 13
[44:46] 9-13 for we know in part and we prophesy
[44:50] in part but when that which is perfect
[44:53] is come then that which is in part shall
[44:56] be done away so in other words a full
[44:58] Revelation comes to the bride of Christ
[45:00] will no longer live in a partial
[45:02] Revelation we'll no longer live under
[45:04] just what little bit and if I can be
[45:06] just blunt and bold my brother and
[45:08] sister and that is what took you and I
[45:10] of this glorious message and the respect
[45:13] that we have for a prophet of God but
[45:15] that's what took us Beyond looking just
[45:17] at the prophet and took us into the
[45:20] fullness of the message amen the
[45:22] revelation of Jesus Christ brother
[45:24] brandham said the fullness of it amen
[45:27] was all so we are here today can I
[45:31] explain all of Jesus Christ no but we as
[45:34] a group collectively and as individuals
[45:36] are moving in that revelation we are not
[45:39] just stopped and saying well God sent a
[45:42] prophet but we're moving we're coming
[45:44] into more maturity every day every step
[45:47] every challenge whether we feel like we
[45:49] failed or whether we felt Victorious
[45:52] amen whether we felt weak or whether we
[45:54] felt courageous we are moving further
[45:58] into the maturity of the revelation of
[46:00] Jesus Christ it is not just as you wake
[46:03] up and got a revelation this Revelation
[46:06] is coming by
[46:09] a how do I word
[46:12] that same way Jesus got
[46:15] it by the things you
[46:19] suffer I wished it was otherwise I
[46:22] wished I could go to bed tonight pray a
[46:25] prayer as before I lay my head on the
[46:26] pillow and wake up tomorrow morning with
[46:29] greater
[46:31] Revelation but you know
[46:35] sometimes sometimes things
[46:37] happen and it brings a little something
[46:40] out of you that you thought had
[46:43] died years ago I had one of those events
[46:45] today brother
[46:47] Sergey and I won't explain it I'll just
[46:50] have to tell you that I went from being
[46:52] upset to apologizing in what seemed like
[46:55] 30
[46:56] seconds because the minute I got upset I
[47:01] realized I was wrong and the Holy Spirit
[47:04] dealt with my heart and I had to
[47:06] apologize and it's a big story it's a
[47:09] complicated story and I won't go into it
[47:11] but I'll just tell you that God doesn't
[47:13] have to take days weeks months and years
[47:16] to bring our heart back to the place
[47:17] it's supposed to be sometimes it's just
[47:20] a matter of a moment that he speaks with
[47:22] us deals with us and we realize I'm
[47:25] wrong and I need to reverse course and
[47:27] you know what's funny is because we as
[47:29] humans we talk about well that person's
[47:32] really proud but usually the guy who's
[47:34] saying or the person who's saying
[47:35] they're really proud is quite proud
[47:37] himself amen because he's able to
[47:40] express his pride about their pride amen
[47:44] and so God knows how to bring us into a
[47:46] position that causes us to change course
[47:50] and my brother and sister the difference
[47:52] I I I want to simplify it the difference
[47:54] of that kind of behavior avior Is
[47:56] Anchored In maturity that's
[48:01] right amen I remember a few years ago we
[48:03] were preaching at a church and there was
[48:06] an individual at that church that cometh
[48:08] after the service and said um I have
[48:12] carried this particular burden and they
[48:15] named the time it was quite a span a
[48:17] decade uh and uh this is what it's done
[48:20] to me it's killed my prayer life I can't
[48:22] hardly read the Bible but I'm condemned
[48:24] not convicted condemned so we know this
[48:26] is the devil amen and all of these
[48:30] things and and my simple question that I
[48:32] could that just come to me I said why
[48:36] sister would you even bother to carry
[48:38] this
[48:40] burden and she said I honestly I don't
[48:44] know but you
[48:46] see when she said I'm finished with this
[48:50] burden I'm finished with this you could
[48:52] sense a presence around her immediately
[48:55] Saints not in a week two month we we
[48:58] only visit this place uh ever so rare
[49:01] and it wasn't it was right there she had
[49:04] a
[49:05] release and she got deliverance from
[49:07] that amen and you know this sister
[49:10] brother Lonnie Jenkins had emphasized
[49:13] this years ago a little research he had
[49:15] done uh shared it with me uh and you
[49:18] know that bitterness and disease are
[49:20] Partners they are friends and when you
[49:23] have bitterness in your life you have
[49:26] unfulfilled amen is really what a
[49:28] bitterness is it's an
[49:30] unfulfilled uh issue that is there you
[49:33] you you are upset for a variety of
[49:35] reasons it's never settled it's
[49:37] unfulfilled and that eats away at the
[49:40] Spirit of humanity and disease follows
[49:43] that and brother Lonnie had quite a case
[49:46] study that he had done and this was not
[49:48] out here at some hospital or whatever he
[49:51] said it was in the message he did his
[49:52] research and that's pretty blunt isn't
[49:55] it to just just say I followed the lives
[49:56] of people and people that went through
[49:59] very harsh things and they would come
[50:01] and say Lord forgive me he didn't blame
[50:04] it on the other person he said forgive
[50:06] me Lord he said they went on in Victory
[50:08] and joy and happiness but others were
[50:11] caught in this realm of everything
[50:13] that's happened in my life is their
[50:15] fault and that was there that would eat
[50:17] them up and I say God help each and
[50:19] every one of us just to be able to let
[50:21] these things go you might be 100% right
[50:25] you might be the one absolutely standing
[50:27] in the word but is killing you not them
[50:31] and we're not called to be bound even
[50:33] though we're right we find Liberty and
[50:35] say Lord I let it go I just give this
[50:38] away I let it go from me tonight that I
[50:41] can find Liberty in my life amen and we
[50:44] see this Liberty that God desires and so
[50:48] when the perfect is come that which is
[50:50] in part shall be done away when I was a
[50:52] child I spake as a child I understood as
[50:55] as a child I thought as a child but when
[50:58] I became a man I put away childish
[51:01] things amen so let us take that
[51:03] scripture and take that as our uh uh uh
[51:07] motivation to step into a new realm to
[51:10] step into a new position to say you know
[51:13] what I'm going to just step into my
[51:15] rightful position of maturity in the
[51:18] word of God now my brother and sister
[51:20] maturity is what gives us the ability
[51:23] Amen to really take a hold of the word
[51:26] and put it to work amen amen now not to
[51:29] take away I know many a young man that
[51:31] worked hard from his youth amen so we're
[51:34] not talking that but sometimes it is
[51:36] even the ability to do is needs to be
[51:39] tempered with the maturity of what needs
[51:42] to be done so we can have ability as it
[51:45] were to say I know what to do here but
[51:48] wisdom is a greater portion amen and so
[51:52] we must know what it is to to do and so
[51:55] we put away childish things for now we
[51:58] see through a glass Darkly but then face
[52:01] to face now I know imp part but then
[52:04] shall I know even also I am
[52:07] known this word known in this context
[52:10] means to be recognized right you know
[52:13] what I want to be recognized as a
[52:16] Christian I don't even particularly like
[52:18] being recognized as Pastor I'm just a
[52:21] brother I'm just a sinner saved by grace
[52:24] I'm just a man but I do want to be
[52:27] identified as a real Christian amen cuz
[52:30] the office of Pastor could be temporal
[52:33] but I don't want my position as a
[52:35] Christian to be temporal I want it to be
[52:37] permanent like Eternal amen taking me
[52:41] right into the presence of God and so
[52:43] it's there that we know H as also I am
[52:47] known so what we want is to be able to
[52:49] project this but this even goes a little
[52:51] bit deeper in the identity of being
[52:54] known as a son or daughter of God
[52:56] because the word Christian is a very
[52:59] convoluted definition in the day we live
[53:01] in it is a definition is used uh very
[53:04] broadly but when you come down to be
[53:07] clearly identified as Sons and Daughters
[53:09] of God it is a very specific thing right
[53:13] amen nobody's going to mistake uh uh you
[53:15] know your children to be my
[53:19] children I joke with my daughter jool ly
[53:22] she's not here to defend herself she
[53:24] might be Liv listening but I joke with
[53:27] her sometimes I I I don't know when you
[53:29] were born I'm not sure you were you were
[53:32] you were my
[53:34] daughter and she just looks at me and
[53:36] does this right
[53:40] here okay there's
[53:44] evidence but you see my brother and
[53:46] sister take that through the word the
[53:48] devil's going to tell you you're not a
[53:50] son you're not a daughter but there's
[53:53] identification there's evidence evence
[53:56] of where we belong and where we came
[53:58] from and where we're going back to
[54:00] there's evidence my brother and sister
[54:02] so we would look at this and we would
[54:04] wonder where is the proof the proof is
[54:07] here the proof is actually here tonight
[54:10] in our presence who we are and how we've
[54:14] been identified it wasn't some random
[54:16] guess it wasn't accident that we were
[54:18] there but clearly identifyed because we
[54:21] have the very nature and attributes of
[54:23] our father it's not an accident of who
[54:26] we are amen hallelujah and so as we look
[54:30] at this now we look at this uh we see
[54:35] our young people slightly at
[54:36] disadvantage I guess because they just
[54:40] all they've known is the
[54:43] message but my brother and sister those
[54:46] of us are a little older and hopefully
[54:47] our young people can really just view
[54:50] this and look through all the fog of
[54:52] time to realize this is not just how
[54:55] happen stances is not just hey this is
[54:57] where I'm at but to realize that just as
[55:00] it was for those of us who are a little
[55:01] older and the recognition that's there
[55:04] that they themselves can see my path has
[55:06] been already directed I have already
[55:09] been called to walk this path and there
[55:12] is as it were footsteps already there
[55:14] for me to follow I don't need to wonder
[55:17] where should I go all I need to do is
[55:20] surrender and follow amen you know they
[55:23] say that's what makes a good soldier
[55:25] amen you can be the best the strongest
[55:28] the whatever of it is but you won't be a
[55:30] good soldier until you learn to follow
[55:33] amen amen you have to be able to walk in
[55:35] the right steps and so there's a time of
[55:38] change sir I think those of you who are
[55:41] slightly older you'll recognize what I'm
[55:43] talking about we have been in the
[55:44] message for many years we have seen many
[55:47] things but we are
[55:49] sensing is that okay to use that word we
[55:52] are sensing a change absolutely there is
[55:55] no longer just hey we're going to go to
[55:57] church we're going to read the message
[55:59] we're going to hear the message we're
[56:00] going to read our Bible my brother and
[56:02] sister there's a lot of people do that
[56:04] but there is something in the bride of
[56:06] Christ she's sensing a changing of the
[56:09] current a changing of the atmosphere
[56:12] something's moving her something's
[56:14] stirring her she's not just about going
[56:16] to church it's part of the word of God I
[56:19] tell you I'm going to speak a little
[56:21] blunt on this we got people that got
[56:22] ideas amen we we you know we we don't
[56:26] need to go to church we'll just sit and
[56:27] listen to a tape good people people I
[56:30] would just love I love them but my
[56:33] brother and sister it's not the word
[56:35] that's the word doesn't say stay home
[56:36] the word says don't forsake the
[56:39] assembling of yourself together amen now
[56:42] like I said I'm going to speak a little
[56:44] direct huge emphasis coming Reviving
[56:47] again on the return Ministry brother
[56:50] brandom coming back my brother and
[56:51] sister so the return Ministry it's
[56:53] making another roote another push but
[56:56] I'm here to tell you tonight it never
[56:58] left it don't need to return back cuz it
[57:01] never left this ministry has never left
[57:05] the prophet of God his own word said
[57:07] it's the Holy Ghost and it's the Holy
[57:09] Ghost that's in me that is in you those
[57:11] are his words amen that Ministry has
[57:14] never left it don't need to come back
[57:17] amen some people they're looking for a
[57:20] deal and my brother and sister we all
[57:22] know that shortcuts don't work there's
[57:25] no such thing as a shortcut but we are
[57:28] no longer a helpless people can we say
[57:30] Amen tonight we're no longer a helpless
[57:33] people true spiritual maturity brings a
[57:37] trust in US amen now my brother and
[57:40] sister where we couldn't trust before we
[57:43] needed something really
[57:46] concrete maturity is bringing a trust in
[57:49] US
[57:51] Absolutely I'll speak of my last
[57:53] conversation with brother
[57:56] Bob he's sitting there apologizing to me
[57:59] brother Paul my mind is wandering I'm
[58:03] sorry there's a
[58:06] pause but one thing I know brother Paul
[58:10] he reached up gripped my hand one thing
[58:12] I know I am
[58:15] his I'll tell you if that was the only
[58:17] revelation we could muster tonight that
[58:20] would be one worthy to hold on to I
[58:23] don't know anything else but I know I'm
[58:26] his Hallelujah I just about started
[58:30] crying sitting there because I thought
[58:32] you know what when I get to be older and
[58:34] I'm getting ready of time terries I'm
[58:36] getting ready to cross over that is a
[58:39] words I want to be able to speak I know
[58:43] I'm his right that takes spiritual
[58:46] maturity none of this I I hope maybe no
[58:50] forget it I know amen but we as a bride
[58:53] are no longer a helpless people I
[58:55] remember the time now let me just throw
[58:57] this out sorry I don't mean to sound
[58:59] aggressive
[59:00] tonight but I remember a time you know
[59:03] that in the church I grew up in being
[59:07] Pastor sometimes I feel actually bad
[59:09] being your
[59:11] pastor CU sometimes I go whole weeks my
[59:15] phone never
[59:16] rings nobody's calling up saying what
[59:19] color of car should I
[59:21] buy nobody's you know what what we do
[59:25] what do we do you see there's a change
[59:27] has come in the bride she's no longer
[59:30] the one at Communion time that they're
[59:32] running all over the church apologizing
[59:33] for everything under the Sun but there's
[59:35] a maturity that's come that they deal
[59:37] with what when the Holy Spirit deals
[59:39] with them and they realiz I maybe
[59:41] stepped over the line they they're not
[59:43] ashamed amen what is that that's the
[59:45] killing of our flesh that's a killing of
[59:48] who we are and submitting it to the word
[59:51] of God that we could stop and say I'm
[59:53] sorry amen it's not that big a word but
[59:56] it's sure hard for people to do and so
[59:58] my brother and sister it is there that
[1:00:01] as a helpless people we used to need
[1:00:03] answers imagine if the prophet was on
[1:00:05] the
[1:00:09] scene forget about what his age would be
[1:00:12] you decide I need to go see the
[1:00:14] prophet they would have one of those
[1:00:16] little things like they have in the
[1:00:18] store take a number and you would pull
[1:00:20] that off of there and it would be
[1:00:22] something like 49
[1:00:25] 1,862 come back in 12
[1:00:31] months because people would constantly
[1:00:34] say there's the answer he's the prophet
[1:00:37] I want it direct from him but we have it
[1:00:39] direct you bet we do we have it direct
[1:00:42] all we got to do is wait on the Lord
[1:00:44] amen we don't have to sit down at a desk
[1:00:47] across the desk amen the word has been
[1:00:50] given out let me use the word dispensed
[1:00:52] it's been put out here we're not waiting
[1:00:54] waiting and the people have come to a
[1:00:56] place that maturity they're not in need
[1:01:00] to always have an answer they realized I
[1:01:02] have a voice that goes to the throne
[1:01:04] aren't you glad you have a voice to the
[1:01:06] throne tonight amen that we don't have
[1:01:08] to run to pastors and evangelist and
[1:01:10] this and that to get an answer when we
[1:01:13] can go right to the Lord and get an
[1:01:14] answer amen straight from the Throne of
[1:01:17] God and I don't say any of these things
[1:01:19] my brothers and sister to slight anyone
[1:01:21] else please don't think of it that way
[1:01:24] but it's time that we need to come to
[1:01:26] the maturity to be able to speak of the
[1:01:29] things that need spoken to face the
[1:01:31] things that we need to face instead of
[1:01:34] skirting them amen instead of always
[1:01:36] just kicking the can down the way we
[1:01:38] need to face that because what's
[1:01:41] happening is God is bringing you and I
[1:01:43] my brother and sister to the day that
[1:01:45] we're no longer looking out there to
[1:01:48] find the proof of this message amen
[1:01:50] we're looking in here finding the proof
[1:01:53] of this message we're looking in our
[1:01:54] families we're looking in our own life
[1:01:57] we can look right in our own assembly we
[1:01:59] can see the proof that the word of God
[1:02:01] is true and the day of having the
[1:02:03] evidence that that God did send a
[1:02:06] messenger my brother and sister as the
[1:02:08] prophet himself says if if they don't
[1:02:10] believe then it's not for
[1:02:12] them but it is for us amen and we've
[1:02:16] seen the
[1:02:17] supernatural amen so what happens we see
[1:02:20] true spiritual maturity amen being
[1:02:23] reflected in the body of Christ we're
[1:02:26] seeing that evidence coming right down
[1:02:29] as as what it is and my brother and
[1:02:32] sister there's nothing like we're coming
[1:02:33] in the springtime and and uh there's
[1:02:36] nothing like seeing the seed come forth
[1:02:38] amen amen but the seed can't say in the
[1:02:42] springtime all the time that's right it
[1:02:44] has to face the
[1:02:47] challenges it has to be
[1:02:50] fertilized watered
[1:02:53] weeded
[1:02:58] face the
[1:03:00] heat be challenged and still
[1:03:08] produce I got so many analogies at real
[1:03:11] true things I I I need to just hold back
[1:03:14] so I don't turn this into a you know a
[1:03:16] gromy class or something but you see my
[1:03:19] brother and sister just because it's
[1:03:21] this tall and it's golden and it has a
[1:03:24] head on it doesn't mean there's anything
[1:03:28] inside there that's exactly it doesn't
[1:03:31] mean that what is in there might well be
[1:03:34] shriveled from the heat of
[1:03:36] leysa it will still grow but will never
[1:03:39] produce the same and the beauty of this
[1:03:43] is is as we come down into this time
[1:03:46] we're seeing how that God is pouring a
[1:03:48] strength into the body of Believers he's
[1:03:50] pouring strength into you and I that the
[1:03:52] test that we are facing today we could
[1:03:55] not have passed 10 years ago but today
[1:03:58] we're standing here because the maturity
[1:04:01] is coming and the season for the seed to
[1:04:04] be brought forth or manifested is upon
[1:04:06] us and so it's there that seed is
[1:04:09] reflecting it is the reflection of the
[1:04:12] atmosphere that is in the body amen and
[1:04:15] so we see this the seed coming forth now
[1:04:18] there has to be a
[1:04:19] likeness I I love this just as I'm
[1:04:22] studying I hope I'm making sense tonight
[1:04:24] but you see there has to be a likeness
[1:04:26] if we have a corn field it's not going
[1:04:28] to look like wheat if we have a wheat
[1:04:29] field it's not going to look like kosha
[1:04:32] you know a Koshi is the big bushy plant
[1:04:34] you know that takes over everything if
[1:04:36] you give it time they're you know five
[1:04:38] or six feet tall and just grow like a
[1:04:40] tree you know if they was if kosher was
[1:04:43] a real crop I'd be
[1:04:47] rich but we spend all this time getting
[1:04:50] those things do you know what the Kosh
[1:04:52] is in your life I want you to stop and
[1:04:55] ponder it tonight for just a moment what
[1:04:58] is the thing that's constantly trying to
[1:05:01] outgrow everything in your life did you
[1:05:05] know in the message thirst brother
[1:05:07] brandham uh speaks very direct but I
[1:05:09] just want to tell you this kosha will
[1:05:12] live on less water than wheat kosha will
[1:05:16] live in poorer ground than wheat kosha
[1:05:20] will live under every circumstance that
[1:05:23] wheat
[1:05:26] won't if I could be straightforward
[1:05:29] tonight we need to stop and examine what
[1:05:31] is the kosher in our
[1:05:34] life and we need to deal with
[1:05:37] that because it will outgrow everything
[1:05:42] in our life it will take over and that's
[1:05:46] not what we're here for we're not here
[1:05:48] to to be you know as it is uh uh U Ultra
[1:05:53] this or Ultra that but we are to be the
[1:05:56] seed coming forth and there has to be a
[1:05:59] likeness appearing and and I love this
[1:06:01] my brother and sister because when you
[1:06:02] look at the word of God and you realize
[1:06:05] what a likeness looks like what what the
[1:06:07] significance All Through the Bible of
[1:06:10] the likeness amen talking about image
[1:06:13] and talking about likeness and talking
[1:06:15] about all of this through the scripture
[1:06:17] you realize that the church itself the
[1:06:19] body of Believers cannot look like
[1:06:22] something else she has to look like
[1:06:24] Christ she has to look like the word she
[1:06:27] can't look like denomination she can't
[1:06:29] look like a a self denomination you know
[1:06:32] the sad thing about it is there's so
[1:06:34] many denominations in the message
[1:06:35] actually there's thousands of
[1:06:37] denominations in the message but they're
[1:06:39] just individual or maybe even a family
[1:06:41] cuz this is how we see it and I don't
[1:06:44] want to sound crass or uncaring tonight
[1:06:46] but I don't care how you see it what
[1:06:48] does the word say Amen cuz we can get an
[1:06:51] image uh the prophet of God said you
[1:06:53] know what you you don't use any man for
[1:06:55] an example only the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:06:58] our example amen and we look at that
[1:07:02] around us and there's great men and we
[1:07:04] look to those and I've been guilty in my
[1:07:06] own self through the years when I first
[1:07:08] started preaching I I can remember you
[1:07:10] know here and let me just throw it out
[1:07:12] here brother Donnie forgive me but
[1:07:14] imagine my brother and sister how many
[1:07:16] Donnie Reagans there are in the world
[1:07:18] Amen they want to walk they want to talk
[1:07:20] they want to preach they want to have
[1:07:22] that kind of Bulldog confidence to go
[1:07:24] out and say devil but my brother and
[1:07:26] sister there's only one brother
[1:07:30] Donnie and maybe people don't know it
[1:07:32] but I hear it from good report that this
[1:07:34] is a man that even out in the woods
[1:07:36] hunting spends more time in prayer than
[1:07:38] he does hunting you see we maybe don't
[1:07:43] want to actually be just like someone
[1:07:45] else because maybe their standard might
[1:07:47] be higher than we can live but if we'll
[1:07:49] set a standard and our likeness would be
[1:07:52] the Lord Jesus Christ he he will take us
[1:07:55] through every challenge every battle and
[1:07:58] we won't get weary we won't quit we
[1:08:00] won't get discouraged we'll just keep
[1:08:02] pressing on because that's who we were
[1:08:06] created in the image of amen amen so we
[1:08:10] see this I hope I'm making sense tonight
[1:08:14] amen see the word has to take on a
[1:08:17] living
[1:08:19] form and this is actually way deeper
[1:08:21] than this I'm sorry I'm condensing it
[1:08:22] down so so small tonight but the word
[1:08:26] see has to take on a living form you see
[1:08:29] the word says it's Resurrection Life so
[1:08:33] it has to take on the form of life it's
[1:08:35] not just about something being raised up
[1:08:37] as an image amen you go we were there in
[1:08:40] Belgium I I believe the girls went and
[1:08:43] and toured some of those places you can
[1:08:45] go into some of those churches and just
[1:08:47] like brother brandom said they've rubbed
[1:08:48] the feet and the hands right off of
[1:08:50] those statues it didn't change one thing
[1:08:53] in their life but when we can come into
[1:08:55] the image of a living God Amen when the
[1:08:58] image that we're molded to is a living
[1:09:01] God then there is life there you don't
[1:09:04] have to rub the hand off amen you can
[1:09:06] receive the blessing of the word because
[1:09:08] he was the word amen and so it has to
[1:09:11] have a living form now we can talk right
[1:09:14] the scripture talks about a dead letter
[1:09:16] now we can talk about a dead letter all
[1:09:18] we want to talk about a dead letter but
[1:09:20] that dead letter will not help you and I
[1:09:23] my brother sister and I want to
[1:09:25] challenge you tonight to not let the
[1:09:27] message of the hour become dead letter
[1:09:30] to us when we read it it shouldn't be by
[1:09:33] root that I I need to at least consume a
[1:09:35] tape or two a week I need to do this or
[1:09:38] that it needs to be lived if H this is
[1:09:41] opinion okay I want to just clarify this
[1:09:43] this is opinion if it takes you a month
[1:09:45] to get through a message then glean
[1:09:47] every nugget there is out of that
[1:09:50] message not be able to say I read 25 30
[1:09:53] sermons last year why don't you just
[1:09:55] have confidence to say I made it through
[1:09:58] one sermon in months but I tell you what
[1:10:01] I got to glean every nugget right out of
[1:10:03] that amen
[1:10:06] hallelujah my brother and sister it's
[1:10:08] it's real amen it has to have a living
[1:10:11] form you know that Revelation is a
[1:10:13] living form amen if you have a dead
[1:10:16] Revelation that means somebody taught it
[1:10:18] to you right but when Revelation is
[1:10:20] alive it starts to produce and you can
[1:10:23] see the very life of Revelation in
[1:10:26] somebody I don't want to sound super
[1:10:27] spiritual tonight but I tell you my
[1:10:29] brother and sister you can tell when
[1:10:30] people are in the word you can tell when
[1:10:32] they've been digging and eating and
[1:10:34] drinking and it's become their life you
[1:10:36] can see that in
[1:10:39] themen I don't want to have a form of
[1:10:41] godliness no sir I want godliness amen
[1:10:44] and real godliness is Christ Jesus amen
[1:10:47] so healing is a living form right if
[1:10:50] someone has you know something uh our
[1:10:54] sister Elena Bots and the brother
[1:10:56] Matthew Watkins testimony if you're
[1:10:58] familiar with that were they witness to
[1:11:00] that black Minister about that and and
[1:11:03] then there it is a few months down the
[1:11:05] road he's perfectly healthy my brother
[1:11:07] and sister healing has a life amen amen
[1:11:11] it's death even death even cancer has a
[1:11:15] certain life but you can starve the life
[1:11:18] out of
[1:11:19] cancer you realize that science realizes
[1:11:22] that they can do certain things that
[1:11:23] will starve that's why
[1:11:26] sugar not my bandwagon I love sugar
[1:11:30] sugar has been my friend since I was
[1:11:31] about this
[1:11:33] big sometimes I still think it's my
[1:11:36] friend but you see cancer feeds on sugar
[1:11:40] yes
[1:11:41] sir so the things we struggle with what
[1:11:43] are they feeding on Lord help us amen
[1:11:47] Lord help us the devil cannot live in
[1:11:50] the presence of the Holy Ghost there's
[1:11:53] nothing there for the devil to feed on
[1:11:56] because it's not his diet it's the word
[1:12:00] that takes and cast him out that's right
[1:12:03] amen so he can't feed on that amen faith
[1:12:06] has to have a living form amen when we
[1:12:09] have a dead Faith which people you say
[1:12:12] how do you have a dead Faith well a dead
[1:12:14] faith is a faith we talk about but it
[1:12:16] doesn't have a life to move anything so
[1:12:19] if you have a dead Faith where you oh
[1:12:20] God's A Healer God's a savior God's a
[1:12:23] deliver God's this God's that but
[1:12:25] there's no life in there to bring it to
[1:12:27] pass then you literally have a dead
[1:12:29] faith and you can apply the name to
[1:12:31] anything my brother and sister but it
[1:12:34] has evidence that it's alive can you say
[1:12:37] Amen the time that you have been prayed
[1:12:39] up you're on fire for God things that
[1:12:42] just you will just say nope out of my
[1:12:44] way Satan but when you're down and
[1:12:47] you're feeling alone you feel you know
[1:12:49] maybe depressed or feel whatever it is
[1:12:51] there that same thing becomes a mountain
[1:12:54] in our life but Faith real Faith amen
[1:12:58] and now I want you to remember what the
[1:12:59] prophet of God said he said that Faith's
[1:13:01] already in you that's right amen so you
[1:13:03] don't have to go find Faith amen you
[1:13:05] just got to let the word release it in
[1:13:07] you amen so you know what it's not a
[1:13:11] theory it's real living amen a form that
[1:13:16] is there when I say a form I just mean
[1:13:19] as Faith would would if I could say it's
[1:13:22] embodied
[1:13:23] it's substance that's good word thank
[1:13:25] you brother David substance and and
[1:13:28] we're we're there it's a body my brother
[1:13:29] and sister and have you ever I don't
[1:13:31] know if you ever have I prayed for
[1:13:33] people in prayer lines in South America
[1:13:36] that when certain people would come they
[1:13:38] weren't there for themselves they were
[1:13:40] for someone else they were for sometimes
[1:13:42] I I prayed for uh I prayed with it turns
[1:13:45] out a sister one time that it was her
[1:13:47] natural sister just went in the prayer
[1:13:49] line before me and that sister had a
[1:13:52] disease and it's there and then Here
[1:13:54] Comes her natural sister but her sister
[1:13:56] also in Christ saying I'm not here for
[1:13:59] myself I'm for my sister and I want to
[1:14:02] pray that I can have more faith that I
[1:14:05] can share that Faith with her as an
[1:14:07] influence in her life and my brother and
[1:14:10] sister we had a real Jubilee we had a
[1:14:12] time my wife will remember it is a time
[1:14:14] that she wondered what was going on cuz
[1:14:16] people came to the prayer line two or
[1:14:17] three times sister Jerry's like what are
[1:14:19] they doing my husband's thrashed out
[1:14:21] ready to claps on the floor but I tell
[1:14:23] you every one of those God was working
[1:14:25] and God did work amen there was a time
[1:14:28] there that there was Supernatural power
[1:14:30] taking place because Faith was living
[1:14:33] faith was in that church amen Faith was
[1:14:36] in those Believers and it was being
[1:14:39] manifested and when the chains were
[1:14:41] broke off you realize my brother and
[1:14:44] sister brother Brown talks about Johnny
[1:14:46] Crow time up leaving there long enough
[1:14:51] untime and he's been trained to only go
[1:14:53] so far God help us my brother and sister
[1:14:56] may the Holy Spirit move through Grace
[1:14:58] Tabernacle and help us to realize we've
[1:15:01] been set free and we can go further than
[1:15:04] we ever thought we could go we can go
[1:15:06] all the way in the word of God not just
[1:15:08] as far as we been trained to or
[1:15:11] experienced before but we can move out
[1:15:14] amen and if old Johnny Crow ever figured
[1:15:16] out that he actually could fly again he
[1:15:18] would have been gone but he was so
[1:15:20] conditioned to stay there right where he
[1:15:24] was at and the devil's trying to do that
[1:15:25] to you and I tonight condition us to
[1:15:28] only go so far amen you see this is not
[1:15:31] a
[1:15:33] theory no sir it is we we deal in quite
[1:15:36] a few things that are theories
[1:15:40] right come
[1:15:42] on theoretically every seed that you
[1:15:45] plant will
[1:15:47] grow reality is you'll be lucky if 90 92
[1:15:52] or 3% % of it
[1:15:54] grows I want you to know that you're in
[1:15:56] the 90 2 or
[1:15:58] 3% you're you're not the seed that was
[1:16:01] planted to Wither on the roadside
[1:16:03] amongst the rocks and amongst the thorns
[1:16:05] and whatever else but you was anointed
[1:16:07] called of God by the word to be one that
[1:16:10] grows amen now let's turn to 2
[1:16:14] Corinthians 3:17 and 18 I need to hurry
[1:16:17] along
[1:16:18] here amen now the Lord is that
[1:16:22] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[1:16:25] is there is
[1:16:26] Liberty now I want you to understand
[1:16:29] when I I'm preaching with some enthusias
[1:16:31] I'm I'm excited I've been thinking about
[1:16:33] this for a
[1:16:34] bit how you worship is up to you I just
[1:16:37] hope that you're worshiping in Liberty
[1:16:39] that's it Liberty doesn't mean that you
[1:16:42] got to jump up and run all around the
[1:16:43] church jump on top the pews scream do
[1:16:46] any of that if you want to you're
[1:16:48] welcome but it doesn't mean you have to
[1:16:51] to have Liberty in Christ amen am and so
[1:16:54] it's there often times we'll come to
[1:16:56] church and and maybe you can say Amen if
[1:16:58] this is true for you we can come to
[1:16:59] church with a
[1:17:01] burden and you know in the service when
[1:17:05] that burden lifted amen we don't need
[1:17:08] somebody to come out and by almost like
[1:17:10] discernment you know brother or sister I
[1:17:12] I believe that that burden Has Lifted
[1:17:15] from me you can say I know that I felt
[1:17:17] it
[1:17:18] leave see we we don't need somebody as
[1:17:21] it were almost like prophesying over us
[1:17:23] to to do that we're going to come to
[1:17:25] church and burdens are going to be
[1:17:26] lifted the word promises it let's just
[1:17:29] believe the word trust the Lord let that
[1:17:31] word come alive in us amen now where the
[1:17:35] spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[1:17:37] but we all with open face beholding as
[1:17:40] glass the glory of the Lord and changed
[1:17:43] into the same
[1:17:46] image come on my brother and sister
[1:17:48] we're not changed in the image of the
[1:17:50] message as it were or the image of
[1:17:52] Pastor or the image of this or the image
[1:17:55] that everybody thinks we should be but
[1:17:57] we're changed into the image of the Lord
[1:18:01] amen Allelujah the same image from glory
[1:18:03] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[1:18:06] Lord that's what the Holy Ghost wants to
[1:18:08] do we don't need to have the Holy Ghost
[1:18:10] just so we can tell everybody we have
[1:18:12] the Holy Ghost we want to have the Holy
[1:18:14] Ghost that it will come and move us amen
[1:18:17] put life in these bones that we can go
[1:18:20] out and it doesn't sound super spiritual
[1:18:22] I'm sorry but we can go out and live the
[1:18:25] life of Jesus Christ out there it's easy
[1:18:28] to do it in here that's it well maybe it
[1:18:31] isn't always easy to do it in here but
[1:18:34] you know what I'm
[1:18:35] saying but I want to have that that I
[1:18:39] can live it out there amen I want the
[1:18:41] Holy Ghost not to leave me just as a
[1:18:43] vocabulary but I want to know it in
[1:18:45] power and Liberty to be able to live an
[1:18:47] overcoming life in the day that we live
[1:18:49] in amen see I I want my brother and
[1:18:53] sister let me just put it this way you
[1:18:55] want to see the Lord's desire expressed
[1:18:58] you don't need to look any
[1:18:59] further you want to see the Holy Ghost
[1:19:02] In Action you don't need to look any
[1:19:04] further are you with me you want to see
[1:19:07] overcoming power you don't need to look
[1:19:09] any
[1:19:10] further amen you want to see the
[1:19:12] supernatural you don't need to look any
[1:19:14] further you want to have faith you don't
[1:19:17] need to look any further every bit of
[1:19:19] it's in the word and the word of God
[1:19:21] says it's already in you you because he
[1:19:24] has come and poured himself into you and
[1:19:28] he didn't strain it out he didn't strain
[1:19:31] Faith out he didn't strain Supernatural
[1:19:34] out he didn't strain this out and that
[1:19:36] out and then give you a portion it's
[1:19:38] already in you and it's already in
[1:19:41] expression in our lives but it's our
[1:19:44] reflection my brother and sister that
[1:19:47] he's trying to bring that we would look
[1:19:49] like him amen not look like a religious
[1:19:52] person not look like a sadducee or
[1:19:54] Pharisee not to look like whatever but
[1:19:57] my brother and sister that we look like
[1:19:59] him because he's pouring himself into us
[1:20:01] and the more that you pour into
[1:20:05] it you know my brother and sister I've
[1:20:08] got so many analogies tonight I I just
[1:20:10] will restrain myself amen why why do you
[1:20:14] say that brother Paul because your
[1:20:17] desire to serve the Lord your desire of
[1:20:20] the Holy Ghost your desire of overcoming
[1:20:22] power power your desire of the
[1:20:23] supernatural your desire to see Faith
[1:20:27] expressed is all part of the image of
[1:20:32] Christ now the word said we'd be made in
[1:20:36] His
[1:20:37] image don't be shocked when these things
[1:20:40] start showing up in your life and don't
[1:20:42] be shocked when the devil does his very
[1:20:44] best to throw a old wet towel over it to
[1:20:47] try and stop you because see you were
[1:20:50] called to be that expression if God
[1:20:53] wanted a different expression in this
[1:20:54] day my brother and sister we would be
[1:20:56] able to look out now I'm going to just
[1:20:58] be blunt do you think that we need to
[1:21:00] run around the the church we need to
[1:21:02] have those things to have the Holy
[1:21:06] Ghost do we have to speak in tongues to
[1:21:08] have the Holy
[1:21:09] Ghost do we have to oh come on we could
[1:21:12] just go on and on down the list I'll let
[1:21:14] you fill it in do you have to no the
[1:21:16] prophet of God himself said that he
[1:21:19] viewed it as the evidence of the Holy
[1:21:21] Ghost was receiving all of the word for
[1:21:24] your hour your day and acting on it my
[1:21:29] my brother and sister we get up in the
[1:21:31] morning and we start we start our day
[1:21:33] acting on it can we can you say amen and
[1:21:36] we go through the midday acting on it we
[1:21:38] go through the end of the day acting on
[1:21:40] it we go to bed acting on it we go to
[1:21:42] church acting on it we go to the store
[1:21:45] acting on it my brother and sister we
[1:21:47] don't need any more proof the proof is
[1:21:49] sitting right here tonight that the word
[1:21:52] has come alive and is living in a body
[1:21:54] of Believers that are taking the word as
[1:21:56] their absolute and standing in that
[1:21:58] position we don't need another proof we
[1:22:01] don't need to find something out of a
[1:22:02] newspaper article from 65 or 70 years
[1:22:06] ago we don't need to find some kind of
[1:22:08] news reel or some kind of film reel or
[1:22:12] this or that my brother and sister I'll
[1:22:14] tell you what as much as I appreciate
[1:22:17] and I have such respect for sister
[1:22:18] Sarah's parents that we've had lovely
[1:22:20] conversation my brother and sister
[1:22:22] they've sat there with in the services
[1:22:25] of the prophet eyewitnesses of it but I
[1:22:27] hope this comes out right but I don't
[1:22:29] need their testimony for proof I Rejoice
[1:22:33] that they had that experience that God
[1:22:36] dealt and answered things directly for
[1:22:38] them but I don't need that proof I have
[1:22:40] a proof of my own and that was a calling
[1:22:43] of the word of God in my life and God
[1:22:45] vindicating to me that he called me as a
[1:22:48] son that he's made my way before me and
[1:22:51] he's given me victory and I can stand
[1:22:54] and when I can't stand he said don't
[1:22:56] worry I'll carry
[1:22:58] you oh excuse me I'm getting excited
[1:23:01] tonight
[1:23:02] hallelujah amen you know all of this is
[1:23:07] part of the
[1:23:08] image
[1:23:10] imagine we could all be
[1:23:18] Peter what part of Peter do you
[1:23:21] remember
[1:23:24] we're in Israel we come right down here
[1:23:26] here's a
[1:23:27] statue of Peter and the
[1:23:33] rooster and I looked at that and I
[1:23:37] thought you know that's
[1:23:38] interesting because someone took the
[1:23:41] time to carve in marble or whatever that
[1:23:45] was Peter and the
[1:23:47] rooster to them that's who Peter was but
[1:23:53] to the bride of Christ Peter was the
[1:23:56] rock of Revelation not in Peter he was
[1:24:00] given Keys a place that the bride of
[1:24:03] Christ could anchor down and given keys
[1:24:06] to that Kingdom he would be able to open
[1:24:09] these things up and see the word of God
[1:24:12] that's how I want to choose to remember
[1:24:14] Peter as a man filled and given Keys
[1:24:17] amen not a not a coward not a man who
[1:24:19] denied Christ not a man that's
[1:24:21] commemorated in a statue with a
[1:24:24] chicken no sir we went to that what did
[1:24:28] they call that there on on the shore
[1:24:30] Galilee with the stone that church where
[1:24:32] the girl sang I can't remember the name
[1:24:35] of that church but I tell you my brother
[1:24:37] and sisters see you get there and it's a
[1:24:40] shrine to the Catholic church and Etc
[1:24:42] but it's very moving because you're
[1:24:44] right there realize okay there's another
[1:24:47] Peter besides the one with the rooster
[1:24:49] in the story another Peter that God had
[1:24:51] my brother and sister there's another
[1:24:53] story about our life it's not the one
[1:24:56] the devil wants to do it's not the one
[1:24:58] that the critic wants it's the one that
[1:25:00] God said I'll give you proof that this
[1:25:02] word will deliver in this day amen this
[1:25:07] is keeping power on display amen now do
[1:25:11] we need to go find the great spiritual
[1:25:13] men in the message to say there's
[1:25:14] keeping power on display and I'm telling
[1:25:17] you my brother and sister a lot of non
[1:25:19] names amen are being kept just as long
[1:25:22] as those whose names are recognized
[1:25:24] around the world there's a lot of you
[1:25:26] might call them nobodies that are living
[1:25:28] overcoming life got faith God's hearing
[1:25:30] their prayers they're seeing healings
[1:25:32] take place deliverances take place and
[1:25:35] nobody on Earth knows them but they're
[1:25:37] just as much the word on display and
[1:25:39] manifest as anyone else on the Earth
[1:25:42] today there is the proof the proof is
[1:25:44] here tonight
[1:25:46] hallelujah hallelujah now look in John
[1:25:49] 14 amen I'll just jump right there to
[1:25:53] verse 20 I did have a few more verses
[1:25:55] there but verse 20 that day ye shall
[1:25:58] know that I am in my father and ye in me
[1:26:03] and I in you now my brother and sister
[1:26:07] we either either have to believe this
[1:26:09] word or we just have to rip that page
[1:26:11] out of our
[1:26:14] Bible you're in
[1:26:17] him but what's even more incredible to
[1:26:21] me
[1:26:22] he's in
[1:26:24] us we're standing here today we're able
[1:26:26] to
[1:26:27] say the spirit of the Living
[1:26:30] God but brother Paul I had a bad day I
[1:26:34] don't care what kind of day you had he
[1:26:35] didn't say let's see let's reread this
[1:26:38] amen uh and at that bad
[1:26:42] day no I I think I I got that mixed up
[1:26:46] didn't day he never described what kind
[1:26:49] of day it would
[1:26:51] be we know that actually it's meaning of
[1:26:54] an end time
[1:26:56] day but I tell you my brother and sister
[1:26:58] there's a lot of days that make up the
[1:27:00] end time day and not every one of them
[1:27:03] is the most wonderful day for us as
[1:27:06] humans I thought I'd get an amen out of
[1:27:08] that one amen so you know but you it
[1:27:12] don't
[1:27:13] matter this blows up that quits working
[1:27:16] this
[1:27:17] happens that
[1:27:20] fails no matter
[1:27:23] right you're in him that's it he's in
[1:27:26] you that's what we got to look at my
[1:27:29] brother and sister it and you know I use
[1:27:31] the phrase the wheels fall off the wagon
[1:27:33] well what if the wheels fell off Your
[1:27:34] Wagon every single day after a while you
[1:27:37] would get discouraged because you would
[1:27:38] run out of Wheels to put on the wagon
[1:27:40] but he would still be in you so we could
[1:27:42] stop in that day and rejoice and say
[1:27:45] thank you Lord for saving my soul thank
[1:27:47] you for the word of the hour thank you
[1:27:49] for
[1:27:50] life cuz he didn't put put a number on
[1:27:52] there that's right of how many bad days
[1:27:55] you could have or how many good days you
[1:27:57] could have and I I'll just put this
[1:27:59] phrase out here my brother and sister
[1:28:00] it's been just hang hanging with me my
[1:28:04] brother and sister the the Hedge around
[1:28:06] job you know the devil wanted inside
[1:28:09] that hedge but he couldn't get to to job
[1:28:12] and God just comes and says oh no
[1:28:14] problem I open the Hedge but I want to
[1:28:16] tell you this I want to put it out as a
[1:28:17] statement we should be able to live the
[1:28:20] same life outside of the Hedge as we
[1:28:22] lived inside of the Hedge amen we
[1:28:25] shouldn't have to have God put a hedge
[1:28:27] around us everywhere we go and
[1:28:29] everything that we do because the
[1:28:31] prophet said we have become the word
[1:28:34] amen and the word is more powerful than
[1:28:37] anything Satan can say he cannot even
[1:28:40] move past the word
[1:28:48] amen let me just second Corin iians 3:2
[1:28:52] is ye are our epistle written in our
[1:28:54] hearts known and read of all men you see
[1:28:57] my brother and sister the very key words
[1:29:01] right there is written that's right amen
[1:29:04] and if it's written you realize
[1:29:07] even on the sheep skin Brother David
[1:29:10] brought that up on Sunday even on the
[1:29:12] sheep skin it wasn't just something
[1:29:15] surface you realize they cut the word
[1:29:18] into the sheep
[1:29:20] skin
[1:29:23] how thick is your
[1:29:25] skin it's permanently etched in
[1:29:30] you I could tell you about some people
[1:29:33] who have walked away from the
[1:29:35] message have shared with their
[1:29:39] children that they think about it every
[1:29:43] single
[1:29:47] day why it's been etched into them
[1:29:52] amen they can't wash it off they can't
[1:29:56] take it off it's not a robe that you can
[1:30:00] discard it's been etched into
[1:30:03] them and I think if it's etched into
[1:30:06] them I think God will bring them back
[1:30:08] myself I believe that God would not have
[1:30:12] put that so deep in their heart that
[1:30:14] they could just walk away I don't know
[1:30:18] let's read out of the seventh Church
[1:30:20] ages for just a moment we'll be
[1:30:24] dismissed you all know this quote here
[1:30:28] or you should let me put it that way a
[1:30:30] momentary consideration of church
[1:30:32] history will prove how accurate this
[1:30:34] thought is in the Dark Ages the word was
[1:30:36] almost entirely lost to the people but
[1:30:39] God sent Luther with the word the
[1:30:41] Lutheran spoke for God at that time but
[1:30:43] they organized and again the pure word
[1:30:45] was lost for organization tends towards
[1:30:48] dogma and Creeds and let me tell you in
[1:30:50] the message thirst brother Braham says
[1:30:52] you cannot get Creed through the filter
[1:30:55] of the word that's right so the minute
[1:30:59] that you have Creed you've just now cut
[1:31:02] that right out it's
[1:31:04] done and um anyway so and Creeds and not
[1:31:08] simple word they could no longer speak
[1:31:10] for God then God sent Wesley and he was
[1:31:12] a voice with the word in his day the
[1:31:15] people who took his Revelation from God
[1:31:17] became the living Epistles read and
[1:31:19] known of all men so this was the word
[1:31:22] their hour that they took my brother and
[1:31:24] sister we don't need to go back and
[1:31:25] study everything that Luther preached
[1:31:28] everything that Wesley preached because
[1:31:29] you see it was the word and we have the
[1:31:33] fullness of the word in this hour so you
[1:31:36] don't have to go back as one man said
[1:31:38] you know just I'm going to go back and
[1:31:40] I'm going to learn
[1:31:42] aramic so that I can get right down to
[1:31:45] the truth of the
[1:31:46] word and all the years he will spend
[1:31:49] learning aramic to find out that there's
[1:31:51] like 10 12
[1:31:56] variations well what's he going to do
[1:31:59] spend another
[1:32:00] decade he'll be an old man before he
[1:32:02] ever finds any kind of thing out of it
[1:32:04] and by then his head will be so full of
[1:32:07] creed that he won't be able to get the
[1:32:09] filter of the
[1:32:10] word what we need to do is just pray for
[1:32:13] simple Revelation that's it that's it
[1:32:16] the people took his Revelation from God
[1:32:17] become living Epistles read and known of
[1:32:19] all men for their generation I don't
[1:32:22] believe these words are by accident sir
[1:32:24] amen and when the Methodist failed God
[1:32:27] raised up others and so it has gone on
[1:32:29] through the years until the last day
[1:32:30] there is again another people in the
[1:32:33] land God bless you I'm glad to know
[1:32:35] those other people amen who under their
[1:32:39] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:32:43] final age amen now I want to tell you my
[1:32:46] brother and sister when you look at that
[1:32:47] and just realize how precious that is
[1:32:51] amen that it is uh such a um how how are
[1:32:55] we going to say this my my I've got so
[1:32:57] many things going through my mind I only
[1:33:00] thing I can think of is to say this is a
[1:33:02] privilege to be part of the final voice
[1:33:05] to the final age this is not laborious
[1:33:08] this is not you know something that we
[1:33:10] stagger under but it is a privilege to
[1:33:13] be the voice amen along with our
[1:33:16] Messenger to stand there amen but you
[1:33:19] know it can get convolute convoluted
[1:33:23] because I can take you where brother
[1:33:25] brandham said Jesus Christ is the
[1:33:28] messenger to this age that's
[1:33:30] right so we with our
[1:33:34] messenger now some people say you're
[1:33:36] putting brother Brown out the picture no
[1:33:38] I'm not but I want you to see a complete
[1:33:40] picture amen what God chooses to place a
[1:33:44] man you
[1:33:48] know what is the Thunders
[1:33:58] what are the
[1:34:00] Thunders I mean we won't speak up my
[1:34:02] brother and sister because it can get a
[1:34:04] little
[1:34:05] complicated but let's just go for the
[1:34:07] short
[1:34:08] version God's
[1:34:11] voice plain and simple whether he uses
[1:34:13] you or me or brother brandom or some
[1:34:16] other man or some other woman it's God's
[1:34:19] voice and God uses who he wants you know
[1:34:22] so we struggle over these things
[1:34:24] sometimes you know but God had propit us
[1:34:27] you know he he chose at that time to use
[1:34:31] those as his voice my brother and sister
[1:34:34] and we're here to tell him he can't or
[1:34:36] shouldn't have or no but did God majure
[1:34:41] on that no he didn't he used them very
[1:34:44] specifically and so God's got a voice in
[1:34:47] you and I are we going to go even my S
[1:34:51] as a minister are we going to go and
[1:34:53] then declare this message to the whole
[1:34:55] world no my brother and sister God
[1:34:57] sometimes uses us very specific it might
[1:35:00] be sisters that your voice is spoken in
[1:35:06] Prophecy and your own house in your own
[1:35:09] family in your own lives and it's still
[1:35:14] God's
[1:35:16] voice we don't go running up and down
[1:35:18] the street praise God praise God I'm
[1:35:20] this I'm no sir we recognize when God
[1:35:23] wants to use you and I he will use you
[1:35:26] and I let us be willing ready and able
[1:35:30] to be used whether it's in the dining
[1:35:32] room whether it's in the backyard
[1:35:34] whether it's in whatever it is it might
[1:35:36] be you know we want it by the word but
[1:35:38] my brother and sister let's not limit
[1:35:39] ourselves and let's not limit God
[1:35:43] hallelujah okay now where am
[1:35:45] I uh yes sir the church is no longer the
[1:35:49] mouthpiece of God it its own mouthpiece
[1:35:51] so God is turning on her he will
[1:35:53] confound her through the prophet and the
[1:35:55] bride for the voice of God will be in
[1:35:58] her amen I I I you know I've read this
[1:36:02] so many times through the years but it's
[1:36:03] becoming more and more real to me that
[1:36:05] this Bri this bride has a voice my
[1:36:09] brother and sister she's not just to sit
[1:36:11] there and and do nothing but she's got a
[1:36:13] voice that God has given and you want to
[1:36:16] know where the proof is at it's going to
[1:36:18] be in the bride CU she's got have a
[1:36:21] voice and if you got a bride that's got
[1:36:23] no voice then she's not the bride amen
[1:36:26] did that make sense I could really
[1:36:29] expound on that but we don't have time
[1:36:31] amen he'll confound her through the
[1:36:33] prophet and the bride for the voice of
[1:36:35] God will be in her yes it is for it says
[1:36:37] in the last chapter of Revelation 17 the
[1:36:39] spirit and the bride say come once more
[1:36:42] the world will hear direct from God as
[1:36:44] that Pentecost but of course the word
[1:36:47] bride will be repudiated as in the first
[1:36:50] age in other words even within the realm
[1:36:52] of this message they want to quiet the
[1:36:54] voice of the Bride absolutely there's
[1:36:56] only one voice to hear that's right they
[1:36:57] want to quiet the bride's voice but my
[1:36:59] brother and sister a prophet even said
[1:37:02] this bride would have a voice where is
[1:37:03] going to be the proof it's going to be
[1:37:06] right here in the bride and you say wait
[1:37:08] wait won't it be in the word no my
[1:37:10] brother and sister it won't be in the
[1:37:12] word because the word now follow me
[1:37:14] through the word has to have an
[1:37:17] expression if the word was still in
[1:37:19] God's mind and never was
[1:37:23] spoken there has to be expression amen
[1:37:26] God chose you and I to be that
[1:37:30] expression amen sister vaa if you would
[1:37:33] come musicians I should say
[1:37:38] hallelujah I hope I made at least a
[1:37:40] little bit of sense
[1:37:42] tonight I just a lot of thoughts a lot
[1:37:47] of thoughts and sometimes I I believe
[1:37:50] the ministers here here in the church
[1:37:51] would agree sometimes it's almost
[1:37:53] dangerous to bottle up that many
[1:37:55] thoughts because when you go to let them
[1:37:57] out you want to let them all out at the
[1:37:59] same
[1:38:01] time Hallelujah wonderful wonderful
[1:38:05] Jesus is to
[1:38:06] me
[1:38:12] hallelujah amen let's just stand and
[1:38:15] sing a couple songs before we go if that
[1:38:18] would be all
[1:38:20] right
[1:38:22] wonderful
