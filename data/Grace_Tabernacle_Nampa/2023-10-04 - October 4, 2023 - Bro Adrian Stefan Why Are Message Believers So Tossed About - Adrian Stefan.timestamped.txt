[28:41] [Music]
[28:52] worldship God bless you
[28:55] tonight it's good to be in the the house
[28:57] of the
[28:59] Lord I always say it and I repeat myself
[29:02] and I don't feel sorry but it's a true
[29:06] blessing to still be able to gather in
[29:08] the house of the
[29:10] Lord you know sometimes we as Christians
[29:13] we take things from
[29:15] granted and the only way we can
[29:17] appreciate them is when they're taken
[29:19] away from
[29:20] us and in many parts of the
[29:24] world Christians they fear when they
[29:26] meet
[29:28] at any time they expect somebody to come
[29:30] in and and arrest them or they even risk
[29:32] their life but today we are happy to be
[29:36] in the house of the Lord It's a true
[29:38] blessing that we are still free to
[29:41] Worship the Lord as we can see things
[29:43] are going so wrong in this world for how
[29:45] long we don't know let's hope we're
[29:48] going to be in Glory by that time but as
[29:50] we can say today blessed be the name of
[29:52] the Lord that we can still come in the
[29:54] house of the Lord God bless you tonight
[29:58] tonight as we open our Bibles for the
[30:00] readings I would like to read from
[30:02] Hebrews thank you
[30:05] musicians Hebrews chapter
[30:08] 4 starting with verse 9 to verse
[30:12] 12
[30:14] Hebrews chapter
[30:18] 4 9 10 11 and
[30:26] 12
[30:29] there remain there a rest to the people
[30:32] of
[30:33] God for he that has entered into his
[30:37] rest he also has ceased from his own
[30:42] works as God did for his let us labor
[30:47] therefore to enter into that rest amen
[30:51] right lest any man fall after the same
[30:55] example of unbelief amen that's right
[30:58] for the word of God is
[31:01] quick powerful and sharper than any
[31:05] two-edged
[31:06] sword piercing even to the dividing
[31:09] aunder of the soul and the spirit amen
[31:14] and the joints the joints and Marrow and
[31:17] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[31:20] intents of the heart let's bow our
[31:24] heads dear heavenly father as we read
[31:27] your word this evening
[31:29] Lord Lord we ask you to bless us this
[31:31] evening with your word Lord and speak to
[31:33] the people tonight Lord as they came to
[31:36] hear your word Lord Lord take myself out
[31:39] of the way Lord I don't want anything to
[31:41] do with myself Lord and I ask you to
[31:43] bless me and use my mouth Lord As You
[31:45] Wish Lord amen we ask you all these
[31:48] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:49] Christ amen amen you may have your
[31:56] seats
[31:58] the Lord put on my heart a message and
[32:01] if you were to ask
[32:03] me if you ever want to preach one
[32:06] message and be done it'll probably be
[32:08] this message as we're about to see
[32:10] brother brandham and his ministry came
[32:14] especially one of the reasons was for
[32:16] this message that I'm about to
[32:18] preach
[32:21] and brother Brenan preached a message in
[32:24] 1956 which is
[32:25] called War are people so tossed about
[32:28] exactly right and that message changed
[32:30] my
[32:31] life that was one of the message it was
[32:34] 1956 I believe if I'm not mistaken 1956
[32:38] January that's correct that message
[32:40] changed my life
[32:42] completely until then I was just a
[32:44] message believer but that's not enough
[32:47] that is not enough and that's why my
[32:50] message tonight and and one other very
[32:53] important point that I want to point out
[32:56] as message belie Believers and and of
[32:58] course I'm coming from a Pentecostal
[33:00] background but it's very easy for us to
[33:02] point fingers exactly but the only
[33:06] finger that should be pointed is towards
[33:08] us amen it's very easy to look in
[33:11] somebody else's yard and say well look
[33:12] at their
[33:14] weeds well when was the last time we
[33:15] looked in our yard we get so busy
[33:18] looking into somebody else's yard that
[33:20] we miss what's in our own life may the
[33:23] Lord help us with that that's exactly so
[33:25] my message tonight is entitled
[33:27] why are message Believers so tossed
[33:30] about that's right and you may say
[33:33] brother Adrian that's kind of message
[33:35] Believers toss about bet well if you
[33:39] don't have rest you're toss about that's
[33:41] right the only way you're not going to
[33:43] be tossed about as we're going to see in
[33:45] this message is when you receive full
[33:47] rest amen and as we read in the Bible
[33:49] who's going to give you that rest the
[33:51] Lord Jesus Christ
[33:52] that's amen
[33:55] amen I I want to talk a little bit about
[33:58] how the Lord spoke to me in this
[34:01] message because I really believe that's
[34:03] very important um coming from a
[34:06] Pentecostal
[34:08] background I'm not going to go into a
[34:10] details you probably know very well what
[34:13] they believe in and and and everything
[34:15] but my I was fellowshipping with some
[34:18] brothers and and I know the Lord Was
[34:21] preparing me and I was there for a
[34:23] season and it helped me to see how they
[34:25] believe
[34:27] now I told the brothers I never believed
[34:28] in the
[34:29] Trinity every time somebody would
[34:31] mention the Trinity some something was
[34:33] was bothering me I I wanted to get out
[34:36] of the church when they mentioned that
[34:38] it just it just didn't suit me it didn't
[34:40] make any sense and and and when you see
[34:44] how indoctrinated they are in that
[34:46] belief that's right and I've heard many
[34:49] many brothers say this I I haven't heard
[34:51] it myself personally but many people
[34:53] pray to Jesus and then they forget to
[34:55] pray to God so they come back and say
[34:56] well and and then they try to divide the
[34:58] time equally so they're not offending
[35:00] the other it's a mess right that's right
[35:04] it's a mess is but the bride knows yes
[35:07] why because in the last day that's
[35:11] right sir the son of man will be
[35:15] revealed we're not any better than
[35:18] them we can't I can't say I'm better
[35:20] than them it's the mercy of God that
[35:24] chose us from the beginning and and I
[35:26] love the example that brother Bram gives
[35:29] with the piece of
[35:30] material well you have to start
[35:33] somewhere so he starts cutting starts
[35:36] cutting starts cutting and here you are
[35:40] here I am amen does that mean the other
[35:42] piece of material is bad no but he has
[35:45] to start somewh right and he chose us
[35:48] isn't that wonderful glory to God praise
[35:51] be God and you know me and my wife we
[35:55] got married and that's when I really
[35:57] began to be interested in the message
[35:58] because for us church was just a place
[36:02] of where you went uh it was nice it was
[36:05] good we sang songs um we hang out at the
[36:09] church we didn't do anything bad um but
[36:12] I just felt like we were just playing
[36:14] church and I got desperate and I said
[36:18] Lord there's two options I'm either
[36:21] going to pretend to be somebody that I'm
[36:23] not I'm going to pretend that I'm
[36:24] worshiping you and doing all these
[36:26] things or I'm going to truly worship you
[36:32] yes and that's when I got really serious
[36:34] about the message I have heard about the
[36:36] message for a very long
[36:39] time um have we've never had a
[36:42] connection with the with the message CH
[36:44] so it it was very hard for us to we had
[36:46] so many
[36:48] questions we knew it was a good message
[36:50] we knew about brother bam but we just
[36:52] had so many questions and so what I did
[36:55] personally I started asking asking the
[36:57] Lord Lord is if this is the true message
[36:59] show me reveal to me I don't want what
[37:03] brother X and brother Y is saying I want
[37:05] a personal revelation is this truly you
[37:08] and so I started researching the message
[37:12] and in the back of my mind I was
[37:14] thinking let's see where this message
[37:16] goes because pretty much all other
[37:18] messages they go to a good point and
[37:20] then fall off and you're like well it
[37:21] was good until now but that that's not
[37:24] in the Bible so I was reading the
[37:27] message with the idea of there's going
[37:30] to be probably an edge somewhere where
[37:32] the message is going to fall off well I
[37:35] haven't found
[37:38] it so the Lord was merciful to me and
[37:41] and and to my family and so we believed
[37:45] the message we renounced everything that
[37:47] we had and we started going to Brother
[37:51] David mcgeer's church with many of of
[37:53] you know him and it was a
[37:55] blessing and a true testimony my wife
[37:58] was raised Pentecostal as well I knew
[38:00] about the message since I was a little
[38:02] kid uh as my grandpa uh first heard
[38:04] about the message but back in the day
[38:06] there was no me messages on iPads and so
[38:10] you you know you you you just had to you
[38:12] what it was available and they had to
[38:14] translate in Romania I'm originally from
[38:16] Romania and so whatever was translated
[38:18] in Romanian is what you heard but even
[38:22] to to this day not all the messages are
[38:24] translated so it's very hard when
[38:28] somebody translates something it also
[38:30] gets lost in the translation that's
[38:32] that's just the truth I know the
[38:33] brothers are doing the best they can to
[38:35] translate everything but it just gets so
[38:37] much lost I can see how my grandfather
[38:39] is reading some messages and it could be
[38:41] totally misunderstood because of the
[38:43] translation difficulties EXA and so we
[38:47] um started going to the church and
[38:49] basically the main reason why we we
[38:51] wanted to leave everything behind we
[38:52] started having kids so me and my wife we
[38:54] got married and we had children and when
[38:56] we would go to their Church to the
[38:58] Pentecostal Church many kids had iPads
[39:01] in their hands and they were watching
[39:02] cartoons while the church was going on
[39:05] so we I looked at my wife and I said if
[39:07] this is church I don't want to be part
[39:09] of this because pretty soon my kids are
[39:11] going to ask what why can I have an iPad
[39:14] why can I watch you know whatever they
[39:15] were watching and so we got really
[39:18] serious about it and so we said we're
[39:19] going to leave everything we're going to
[39:21] start going to the other church and
[39:22] we're going to see how it is so we
[39:24] started going to that church and Saints
[39:27] as soon as we walked into that door we
[39:28] never looked back not even one day we
[39:31] said this is what we want whatever
[39:33] they're serving is we basically saw the
[39:36] love of God on their face Lord when the
[39:38] service was done we just didn't want to
[39:40] leave we stayed as long as the piano was
[39:43] playing we stayed there when the piano
[39:44] turned off we even stayed there we
[39:46] didn't want to leave why because the
[39:48] presence of God was
[39:49] there the presence of God was there but
[39:53] Saints as we're about to see that's not
[39:56] enough
[39:57] enough there's another step that's right
[40:01] am why are message Believers so to about
[40:05] that's right message Believers tossed
[40:08] about
[40:09] well it's been a few years we got deeper
[40:13] into the message we got deeper into the
[40:15] message we thought everything was good
[40:17] but every once in a while I would say a
[40:19] lie felt bad about it but I kept
[40:22] going I said
[40:24] Lord felt y doing some things that I
[40:28] wasn't supposed to I knew it wasn't
[40:31] right I knew I had to repent for them
[40:33] but I never had the strength to go to
[40:36] the next
[40:37] step and I want to read a little
[40:40] bit from uh why are people so tossed
[40:43] about paragraph 62 because this is why
[40:47] it's very important to have rest in God
[40:50] Amen in Matthew 11:28 it says this come
[40:55] onto me all ye that labor and are heavy
[40:59] laden and I will give you
[41:03] rest my heart was Desiring that rest y
[41:07] amen I was tossed about sure I was going
[41:10] to a message
[41:12] Church sure we were not doing nothing
[41:14] out of the
[41:15] ordinary but Saints let me tell you
[41:17] something you can deceive the
[41:21] pastor you can even deceive your wife
[41:23] that's right yes
[41:27] but what good does that
[41:29] do where can you hide from the face of
[41:31] God is there a place you can hide no way
[41:36] no you cannot hide from the face of God
[41:40] so I want to read paragraph 62 I'm not
[41:42] sure if the brothers can put it up on
[41:44] the board but it's uh uh why are people
[41:46] so talked about paragraph
[41:47] 62 and uh brother bream starts uh
[41:50] describing this uh condition and as I
[41:53] started listening the conviction came
[41:58] and I feel like brother Brown was
[41:59] talking directly to
[42:02] me church when the word of God Goes
[42:05] Forth there's no way he will return
[42:08] void God has a perfect time of maturity
[42:11] for each and every one of us
[42:14] amen paragraph 62 I said the Christian
[42:19] faith is based solidly upon restl that's
[42:24] right amen a Christian is not tossed
[42:26] about a Christian doesn't run for place
[42:29] to place a Christian doesn't fuss and
[42:32] fume and worry about
[42:35] things a Christian rests it's all over
[42:41] it's all finished for the believer at
[42:44] Calvary that's right all sickness may
[42:47] come and
[42:49] disappointments but the Christian is at
[42:53] rest knowing this that God is is able to
[42:57] keep that which he has performed amen
[43:00] knowing that no matter what the things
[43:04] is and how it looks there's neither
[43:07] sickness sorrow death there is neither
[43:11] starvation or anything that can separate
[43:14] us from the love of God that's in Jesus
[43:18] Christ amen amen I love the example
[43:23] because some uh brothers and sisters
[43:25] they believe that if they have a
[43:27] sickness that maybe they're
[43:30] cursed I love the example that brother
[43:32] Brenham gives and I don't remember
[43:34] exactly which
[43:36] sermon but he's saying that a Shepherd
[43:41] hit one of the
[43:42] sheeps on the leg and she was
[43:46] limping and somebody asked her why did
[43:48] you hit the ship perfectly perfect why'd
[43:51] you break her
[43:53] leg and then he starts to explain see
[43:57] the reason why I did it is because I
[43:58] love her amen and everybody was confused
[44:01] what do you mean you love her you just
[44:02] hit her you broke her leg see you don't
[44:06] understand amen but she loves to wander
[44:09] she loves to go places where I don't
[44:11] want her to be because it's not safe for
[44:14] her so have you ever thought about that
[44:17] if God allows something upon you maybe
[44:20] it's because he loves
[44:21] you he says the ones that I love what do
[44:24] I do I Chas
[44:26] amen blessed be the Lord see just
[44:29] because sickness or Sorrows comes we
[44:32] should be ATR rest that's a that's a
[44:34] place where God wants us to be just let
[44:37] The Old Ship toss any way she wants to
[44:40] that's right the anchor is doing the
[44:43] holding amen who's doing the
[44:46] holding not your sickness not you not
[44:50] your wife it's Christ he's the anchor
[44:53] that holds amen
[44:57] my faith
[45:00] 66 paragraph 66 my faith doesn't anchor
[45:04] in what the coming meetings will
[45:07] be that's very
[45:09] important my faith doesn't rest in only
[45:13] any ability that I have that I would
[45:15] have or upon a church I should join or
[45:19] what people I should associate
[45:22] with my faith anchors and rest entirely
[45:25] upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus
[45:28] Christ already been received that's it
[45:30] amen
[45:32] hallelujah it doesn't matter what the
[45:34] pastor is doing your rest is not based
[45:37] on what the pastor's doing that's
[45:39] exactly right it's not based on what
[45:40] your wife is doing or your husband is
[45:43] doing it doesn't matter don't worry
[45:46] about somebody leaving the message no
[45:48] that's right that's not what your faith
[45:49] should be on that's right you have your
[45:52] own rest you have your own personal
[45:54] revelation amen with the Lord
[45:57] amen
[45:59] right I want to go to paragraph 70
[46:01] because this is where brother Branham
[46:03] starts to explain the condition of the
[46:05] people and this is where the Lord
[46:06] convicted me amen and I found myself
[46:08] right
[46:11] here paragraph 70 you find them people
[46:15] who seem to be very
[46:18] religious seem to have such a deep
[46:20] desire and daily they search and hunt
[46:23] and seek God and never come to any
[46:26] settlement of any
[46:28] kind to where they could ever be settled
[46:31] or Anchored In Christ that's right and
[46:35] this I have learned to be in experience
[46:37] that is what people with people with of
[46:41] intellectual amen and I love how brother
[46:43] Benham says it's not here no no sir it's
[46:47] right
[46:48] here that's the difference that's you
[46:51] will never be able to understand this
[46:53] message intellectually that's right if
[46:55] you're going to try to do it you'll be
[46:57] all confused that's right why because
[47:00] God revealed it to who to
[47:04] babes he didn't make it
[47:07] complicated he revealed himself to the
[47:09] simple people why because he's a simple
[47:11] God and he loves to reveal himself the
[47:14] same way praise be to
[47:17] God and one of them is an intellectual
[47:20] paragraph
[47:22] 72 or a or a mental conception of go of
[47:26] what God Said in his word and Jesus
[47:29] Christ by the way of
[47:32] knowledge and the other is an
[47:35] experimental experience that God has
[47:38] given the man in his heart amen the one
[47:43] intellectual is
[47:46] hungering he is feasting on
[47:49] God but his Feast doesn't hold out
[47:52] that's right
[47:54] amen
[47:57] the other one seems to have Victory all
[47:59] the time there's nothing Brothers
[48:02] there's nothing Brothers them nothing
[48:04] bothers them they're just as solid un
[48:08] anchored as they can be no trials no
[48:12] storms bothers them at all but they seem
[48:16] to have something about them that people
[48:19] who are Christians are trying to live
[48:22] for God admire that type of Christian
[48:25] amen
[48:26] amen many people go to services and
[48:28] rejoice and shout and praise the Lord
[48:31] while the spirit of God is falling all
[48:34] condemnation has left a heart as soon as
[48:38] a day or two after Revival they find
[48:41] themselves back in the old grind
[48:43] again amen so this is where the Lord
[48:46] starts convicting me because in church
[48:48] it feels great you come to church you
[48:51] feel like you can conquer anything but
[48:53] as soon as you leave yeah that's exactly
[48:55] that stays right there you know why
[48:57] because your Fire gets lit from other
[48:59] brothers and sisters in church that's
[49:01] right but when you go home you're empty
[49:04] that's it it doesn't hold out the food
[49:06] that you just ate it's gone that's it
[49:10] that's exactly right and I love to make
[49:11] an
[49:13] association how many people has used
[49:17] perfume I
[49:20] have well when you pass by somebody at
[49:22] Walmart you feel that smell right oh he
[49:25] smells good good but as soon as he's
[49:27] gone it's gone with the
[49:32] perfume
[49:36] right so it's
[49:40] gone but if you're the one that has the
[49:42] perfume you smell all the time it
[49:44] doesn't matter who's passing by you
[49:47] that's exactly how it is when you have
[49:49] the fire of God in you you're always
[49:51] lighting it doesn't matter what trial
[49:53] comes you're always happy you're always
[49:55] blessing somebody you're always praying
[49:56] for somebody you're always you're always
[49:58] concerned about uh Salvation you go to
[50:02] Walmart you think God doesn't want to
[50:04] use you
[50:06] there I call it Walmart
[50:09] preaching I 50 that's
[50:15] right I we always have to have an open
[50:18] mind Lord I'm not just here to buy milk
[50:20] that's right who do I need to encourage
[50:23] that's right maybe you don't even have
[50:24] to speak to somebody maybe just a smile
[50:26] that's right that can make somebody's
[50:29] day amen may the Lord help us to be
[50:31] sensible to
[50:33] that you're not just at Walmart on a
[50:35] random that's shopping spree no that's
[50:37] right pay attention maybe God wants to
[50:39] show you something maybe God wants to
[50:41] show me something absolutely
[50:45] amen yes
[50:47] sir paragraph 89 many people come to
[50:51] Christ which had which was never been
[50:54] able in the pentec world to make the
[50:56] Pentecostal people see the fundamental
[50:59] truth it's so hard because each church
[51:02] has its Doctrine and they hear their
[51:05] Pastor daily their evangelist speak
[51:07] something they say oh well I got
[51:11] it that what difference does it
[51:14] make well coming from a Pentecostal
[51:18] background all you got to do is just
[51:20] speak in
[51:21] tongues that's all you got to do but you
[51:24] know what the problem problem with that
[51:25] is true the devil can interpret
[51:30] that he's the best speaker in tongues of
[51:33] all he can he can produce
[51:36] that that's the problem that's not a
[51:39] sign you have the Holy Spirit no it is
[51:41] not then why didn't the Bible say you
[51:43] will know them by the way they speak in
[51:47] tongues is that what the Bible
[51:50] says that's not what it says you will
[51:53] know them
[51:54] by by their fruits why because he will
[51:58] never be able to impersonate
[52:01] that he will never be able to love he
[52:04] will never be able to have
[52:06] longsuffering that's not him he can't do
[52:09] it praise
[52:13] God paragraph 101 I've met people who
[52:16] would stand in church and
[52:18] rejoice and see them go outside of the
[52:21] church and maybe Monday or Tuesday one
[52:23] just living
[52:42] unbehaved people accept Divine Healing
[52:45] oh this is a big one say oh yes I see it
[52:49] it's in the word oh thank you Lord I
[52:51] believe it now how many people and
[52:54] brother brenham's meetings got
[52:59] healed thousands that's
[53:01] right and very many of them were back
[53:04] maybe in a year or two if not with the
[53:07] same problem with a different problem it
[53:10] was a repeat why because they never
[53:12] found the
[53:18] rest
[53:22] amen
[53:23] now what we just showed you was the
[53:27] condition of the people now I want to go
[53:29] to the True
[53:30] Believer
[53:34] because brother Bram says there's
[53:36] there's uh different uh Believers in
[53:38] church the
[53:41] unbeliever the make
[53:44] believer the make believer wow that's
[53:46] that's a big one that's a faker he fakes
[53:50] it and it's worse than the unbeliever in
[53:53] my opinion
[53:57] now the True Believer paragraph 104 did
[54:02] you ever meet a person that's been in
[54:03] there and has tasted and living of this
[54:06] Mana you can meet him on Monday Tuesday
[54:11] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday or
[54:14] Sunday cloudy day Bright Day gloomy day
[54:17] things going right they go wrong he's
[54:20] always
[54:22] sweet always full of love never to talk
[54:26] or do anything wrong he's living under
[54:28] the glory of God he never gets hungry he
[54:32] never has to go to church to get built
[54:34] up he is just always full of God this is
[54:40] where I said Lord that's what I want to
[54:42] be amen yes sir this is where I want to
[54:46] be I don't want to just do it for myself
[54:49] but I want to do it for
[54:50] others I want to bring others to you and
[54:54] and in this time of my life life the
[54:55] Lord was really dealing with me about
[54:57] the ministry and to be honest with you
[55:00] while we were at the Pentecostal church
[55:01] I really had a bad taste in my mouth for
[55:03] for the ministering
[55:06] because the way I grew up and as you
[55:09] probably know it's it's very it's a very
[55:13] they love to like fight and you know who
[55:16] wants to be the pastor who wants to be
[55:17] the Deacon who you know and then
[55:19] nobody's happy when one person shows up
[55:21] because you know they're not related
[55:24] it's just a huge mess and I looked at
[55:26] all that and I said I never want to do
[55:28] anything like that that's not love you
[55:31] preach about love but you go outside and
[55:33] you fight with somebody how how how does
[55:36] that make any that that just makes you a
[55:38] hypocrite that's what it is and so I had
[55:40] a very bad taste in my mouth and you
[55:42] know the Lord was was dealing with me
[55:44] and and was you know placing uh Stranges
[55:48] on my heart to go testify to them and I
[55:51] said Lord I don't why why is why is why
[55:55] is this happening to me but the Lord
[55:57] wanted to take me through a step and get
[56:00] me prepared for what he wants me to do
[56:03] and we'll see that in just a
[56:04] second but basically I told the Lord and
[56:07] I said
[56:08] Lord if you really want me to work for
[56:11] you and if you want me to do something
[56:13] for you please speak to me
[56:15] personally I don't want to just do it
[56:17] because somebody else is doing it you
[56:19] know I I I already have a bad taste in
[56:21] my mouth from the past if you're sending
[56:23] me Lord I want to do what you want me to
[56:25] do but I want you to confirm to me 100%
[56:28] sure that that's what you want me to do
[56:30] and Saints I'm not going to go into
[56:34] details but the Lord revealed to me
[56:36] right that night how he wants to use me
[56:40] and it's it's just so amazing when you
[56:41] get on your knees and and you pray
[56:43] sincerely and the Lord shows up and he
[56:45] answers that was probably for me the
[56:48] closest relationship that I had with the
[56:49] Lord until then and and it's and it's
[56:52] you cannot trade that for nothing else
[56:54] when you you ask the Lord for something
[56:55] and he shows up right then and there
[56:57] it's it's it's a it's a great feeling
[57:00] and and it fills you with joy the joy of
[57:02] the holy
[57:03] spirit
[57:05] amen paragraph
[57:08] 112 the heart is in the Abode of God and
[57:12] in the Old Testament God dwelt In His
[57:14] glory over the
[57:16] ark and the heart is the ark God dwells
[57:20] not in the head in the heart God is not
[57:25] known by theology God is known God is
[57:29] not known by a mental conception God is
[57:32] known by an
[57:33] oldfashioned Sanctified Born Again
[57:36] experience that's in the human heart
[57:40] amen yet men and women live a good life
[57:43] and love God by mental conception right
[57:47] but the real hiding place is in the
[57:49] heart hid with Christ amen amen
[57:57] paragraph
[57:58] 114 Paul said to me to live is Christ
[58:03] and to die is
[58:05] gain not me that live it anymore but
[58:08] Christ that lives in me amen I want to
[58:11] make a pause
[58:13] here I pointed
[58:15] out to a couple of my family M members
[58:19] which are still
[58:20] Pentecostal and I said did you see what
[58:23] Apostle Paul said here
[58:26] and they had a reason for it and they
[58:28] said well he didn't really mean it that
[58:30] way because if you really go by what he
[58:32] says nobody would be
[58:34] saved and I'm just so we're just going
[58:37] to start cutting the Bible and just take
[58:41] what or are you just looking for a way
[58:43] to commit sin it's basically the way I'm
[58:46] looking at it because if Christ lives in
[58:49] you then how can you say a lie can
[58:52] Christ say a lie no no
[58:56] if Christ lives in you can you do some
[58:58] shady things under the
[59:00] table he wouldn't do
[59:02] it if he truly lives in you would you be
[59:06] unfaithful to your wife sir not for a
[59:09] million
[59:11] dollars you see that's the
[59:15] difference and I love how brother bam
[59:18] explains I believe it's in the message
[59:20] uh from then
[59:22] on from that time that's the message
[59:25] from that time and he says how can a
[59:27] woman give birth to a child and not
[59:29] realize that she just gave birth it's
[59:31] not a pretty
[59:33] side but she knows it from that
[59:38] time we all have to have something in
[59:40] our life to point out to and say from
[59:42] that
[59:44] time I did this and I did that but from
[59:47] that time the Lord came and touched me
[59:50] from that time I was a different
[59:53] person Church another thing that I want
[59:55] to
[59:56] mention if your friends don't realize
[59:58] that you've
[59:59] changed it's a big
[1:00:02] problem if your wife doesn't realize
[1:00:05] that you changed that's a big
[1:00:10] problem strangers will come to you and
[1:00:12] say who are
[1:00:13] you people that you know will come to
[1:00:15] you and say what's going on what
[1:00:18] happened to
[1:00:19] you that's what happens when you have a
[1:00:22] new birth that's right it's imp possible
[1:00:25] to meet with a train and be unchanged
[1:00:28] that's
[1:00:29] right it's impossible there's has to be
[1:00:32] a transformation amen it's impossible
[1:00:35] for you to come together with the word
[1:00:37] of God and remain
[1:00:40] unchanged right when the word of God
[1:00:43] comes inside you're a totally different
[1:00:47] person as far as I know even your face
[1:00:50] changes you look different you smell
[1:00:53] different you act different
[1:00:55] why because Christ took
[1:00:58] control now you're at
[1:01:00] rest but until
[1:01:03] then big question
[1:01:05] mark You're toss
[1:01:10] about amen now brother bam also in this
[1:01:13] message why are people so talk about he
[1:01:15] talks about the both Believers being in
[1:01:17] church paragraph
[1:01:19] 106
[1:01:20] right they're truly eating the same kind
[1:01:23] of Mana that's right
[1:01:25] they've been brought into the camp and
[1:01:28] there is where in the camp of the field
[1:01:32] is where the people got the Mana and
[1:01:34] they're in there and that Mana that they
[1:01:38] eat is the same Mana that this men eat
[1:01:41] eats here they both have the same
[1:01:44] Pastor oh my that's right they both read
[1:01:48] the same
[1:01:49] Bible but one constantly say stays true
[1:01:53] and humble and the other one has got his
[1:01:56] ups and downs going like this in and out
[1:02:00] both of them eating the same Mana but
[1:02:03] one has entered in and the other one is
[1:02:06] still where
[1:02:09] out both of them are believers unto
[1:02:12] eternal life but one is baptized with
[1:02:16] the Holy Spirit into the kingdom of God
[1:02:19] and the other one is outside eating the
[1:02:21] same
[1:02:22] Mana amen
[1:02:25] amen and uh brother bam goes into this
[1:02:28] message and
[1:02:29] he talks about the Tabernacle that Moses
[1:02:33] built and I love his
[1:02:36] comparison he talks about the utter cour
[1:02:40] the holy place and then he talks about
[1:02:42] the holies of
[1:02:45] holies now I want to focus a little bit
[1:02:48] on the outter Court which is also called
[1:02:50] the
[1:02:51] justification that's where everybody
[1:02:53] gets Justified
[1:02:55] paragraph
[1:02:57] 125 now what was the first thing the
[1:03:00] courts represented
[1:03:03] justification then they came to the
[1:03:05] first Altar and the first altar is where
[1:03:08] they burn the
[1:03:11] sacrifice and where the Lord met them in
[1:03:13] there in forgiveness of sins and
[1:03:15] cleansed them from all their
[1:03:19] unrighteousness and the burning altar
[1:03:22] the Brazen altar burn the Beast and the
[1:03:24] blood from the beast in the course they
[1:03:27] must absolutely justify people
[1:03:29] regenerated men and
[1:03:32] women who has accepted God and got
[1:03:35] eternal life dwelling in them they must
[1:03:38] be in the
[1:03:41] courts paragraph 123 here is the way
[1:03:45] they come in in the pattern oh I'm a
[1:03:47] Christian brother bam I've been saved
[1:03:50] I've been baptized I've enjoyed the
[1:03:52] blessings of God you're in the outer
[1:03:55] court but say they I I have my ups and
[1:04:00] downs my worries my toss my tumbles I
[1:04:04] wish that I could live a victory life a
[1:04:07] Victorious Life well we've got to get
[1:04:10] out of the Court you've got to come in
[1:04:13] that's right so the outer court is a
[1:04:16] great start see one thing that I've
[1:04:19] realized is you can't jump from the
[1:04:22] outer Court straight into the holy place
[1:04:24] can't do
[1:04:25] it there are
[1:04:29] steps you have to be
[1:04:31] justified but once you're
[1:04:34] Justified you can't be happy with that
[1:04:36] that doesn't
[1:04:40] last that Mana goes
[1:04:43] bad it's only good for a little bit and
[1:04:46] then it gets
[1:04:47] tail so it's saying you have to enter
[1:04:52] in now the holy place
[1:04:55] I want to talk a little bit about that
[1:04:56] paragraph
[1:04:57] 155 now what's in there there is seven
[1:05:02] gold gold golden candlesticks by the
[1:05:06] holy place and it's giving light the
[1:05:09] candlesticks are giving
[1:05:12] light that's the man who quits drinking
[1:05:16] he quits smoking he quits lying he quits
[1:05:20] stealing treats his neighbor right good
[1:05:24] to his wife or her good to her husband
[1:05:28] the same way men or
[1:05:31] women the
[1:05:33] believer has come into a place where he
[1:05:36] he has quit all his manners
[1:05:40] meanness which is through the blood with
[1:05:44] sanctification he is called to a new
[1:05:46] life and he walks in
[1:05:49] there he don't have to walk by the light
[1:05:52] out there he's got a B light he's
[1:05:55] walking by the Light of the seven golden
[1:05:58] candlesticks which is burning olive oil
[1:06:01] and I'm just going to paraphrase the
[1:06:02] rest what brother benam is talking about
[1:06:04] he said this is the second part that's
[1:06:06] right it's a
[1:06:08] must you have to be Sanctified that's
[1:06:10] right can you imagine if the priest
[1:06:13] would have got in the holies of holies
[1:06:15] without getting into the holies
[1:06:19] first they would have pulled him out he
[1:06:22] would have been dead you can't can't do
[1:06:25] that and I love how brother Benham says
[1:06:28] it's a better place now you're inside
[1:06:30] you're not subject to
[1:06:33] rain
[1:06:35] wind
[1:06:38] Sun you quit smoking you could quit
[1:06:40] drinking that's right but see the first
[1:06:45] part is you doing it the second part is
[1:06:48] you doing it let's see what the third
[1:06:51] part is all about right the holies of
[1:06:53] holies
[1:06:54] which is called the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:57] Spirit that's right now paragraph 116
[1:07:00] let's see what brother Brenham talks
[1:07:01] about here we're getting almost towards
[1:07:04] the end we're not going to be very long
[1:07:06] this
[1:07:07] evening into the holy Place Aaron went
[1:07:10] once a year that's right the
[1:07:12] congregation watched him he was dressed
[1:07:15] right that's right he had to be anointed
[1:07:18] right he had to walk right blessed be
[1:07:22] blessed by the Lord dressed
[1:07:26] right walked right anointed right he had
[1:07:29] Bell and a pomegranate on His
[1:07:33] Garment and he walked they played holy
[1:07:37] holy holy unto the Lord paragraph
[1:07:41] 117 he taken before him a charger of
[1:07:44] blood the blood of the Lamb the blood of
[1:07:47] the atonement and he was anointed with
[1:07:50] the rose of
[1:07:51] Sharon and anointing run off his
[1:07:55] beard Plumb to the hems of his skirt and
[1:07:59] he was walking into the inter courts in
[1:08:03] the presence of God when he and when he
[1:08:06] went behind there the veil fell behind
[1:08:10] him and he was shut out he was hid from
[1:08:14] the outer World praise be to God
[1:08:20] Amen it's not going to be a public show
[1:08:23] no sir as soon as he gets in there
[1:08:25] everybody's behind you the world is
[1:08:27] behind you the pastor's behind you
[1:08:30] everybody's behind you that's what this
[1:08:32] message is about a personal
[1:08:38] revelation I can tell you my Revelation
[1:08:41] you may understand it you may not
[1:08:43] understand it but it's my
[1:08:47] Revelation you have to get your own
[1:08:50] Revelation amen amen
[1:08:55] there is a holding Place Abiding Place
[1:08:58] that we can walk in the presence of God
[1:09:01] and head from the things of the world
[1:09:03] you don't hear them no more it's
[1:09:05] soundproof hallelujah it's soundproof
[1:09:09] the word is on the the world is on the
[1:09:12] outside gasping and looking but you're
[1:09:14] on the inside in the presence of the
[1:09:17] Eternal everlasting God Amen and men
[1:09:22] that once walk into to God and the veil
[1:09:25] drops behind him shutting off the things
[1:09:28] of the world he is in the presence of
[1:09:30] God eating the Mana that's right amen
[1:09:34] now what was in the Holy place the Ark
[1:09:37] of the Covenant that's right what was in
[1:09:38] the Ark of the Covenant there were three
[1:09:42] things the Mana which never went
[1:09:46] stale the
[1:09:48] commandment and Aaron's staff Aaron's
[1:09:52] rod so brother Bram goes in and says
[1:09:56] does that Mana in the Ark of the
[1:09:57] Covenant ever goes bad it's always
[1:10:02] fresh Saints that's what it means to be
[1:10:06] in the presence of the Lord he feeds you
[1:10:09] daily with the bread the Mana that never
[1:10:12] goes
[1:10:14] bad you see what the rest is all about
[1:10:18] when you eat the Mana every single day
[1:10:21] and it's fresh you can't live on the
[1:10:24] Mana that was way back in the day when
[1:10:26] they picked it from the desert you can't
[1:10:29] do you can't live on that you need fresh
[1:10:31] Mana every single day I love how brother
[1:10:35] bham explains that and then he
[1:10:41] says did you ever think of that
[1:10:44] paragraph
[1:10:46] 127 they took Aaron's rod and laid
[1:10:49] Aaron's rod in the presence of the Holy
[1:10:51] place and when they did in one night's
[1:10:56] time it budded blossomed and yielded
[1:11:00] almonds in one night's time think of it
[1:11:05] in the presence of
[1:11:08] God church right that's exactly how we
[1:11:12] were Aaron's Rod was ripped off from an
[1:11:15] almond tree it
[1:11:19] died it became
[1:11:21] dry nothing about him it was just a
[1:11:24] stick that he used but God turned
[1:11:27] around took that and
[1:11:31] overnight in the presence of the God
[1:11:33] Amen what did he do he brought forth
[1:11:37] fruit that's exactly how you and I were
[1:11:40] in the beginning you were in Christ but
[1:11:43] you got cut off you went about in this
[1:11:45] world you got dried but what see what he
[1:11:49] what God did in here is He restored you
[1:11:52] back to the original
[1:11:54] that's what you were in the
[1:11:57] beginning and what did he do a dead
[1:12:01] stick he picked it up amen and he
[1:12:04] brought fruit in the presence of the
[1:12:06] Lord praise be to
[1:12:09] God paragraph 12 139 when Jesus died at
[1:12:13] Calvary he ripped the veil from top to
[1:12:16] bottom to give not only the high priest
[1:12:20] but to everyone that comes approaching
[1:12:23] God has a right into the holies of
[1:12:26] holies I want to read that again because
[1:12:29] that's very important when Jesus died at
[1:12:32] Calvary he ripped the veil from top to
[1:12:36] bottom to give not only the high priest
[1:12:40] but to
[1:12:41] everyone that comes approaching God has
[1:12:45] a right to the holiest of holies amen
[1:12:52] amen
[1:12:56] Saints as I come to a
[1:12:59] close I want to show you how important
[1:13:02] this message that brother bham preached
[1:13:04] and and as I told you this message
[1:13:05] changed my
[1:13:07] life because for a very long time I
[1:13:10] thought I had the Holy
[1:13:11] Spirit but yet I still had Little
[1:13:15] Falls still had a desire to tell a
[1:13:19] lie I still had a desire to do things
[1:13:22] that were not accepted in the the Lord
[1:13:26] one example that I want to give
[1:13:29] you and I really don't like to point my
[1:13:32] own self out but I I don't know of any
[1:13:35] other
[1:13:36] example just went to a car
[1:13:39] wash and
[1:13:41] um it's it's a little bit complicated
[1:13:44] you got to put your card in and then
[1:13:46] there's two when you're done with the
[1:13:48] washing your car it's a self
[1:13:50] self-washing car you have to press two
[1:13:52] buttons well one one of them you have to
[1:13:54] shut off the pump and then there's
[1:13:55] another button where you got to press to
[1:13:56] stop well somebody had forgotten to
[1:13:58] press the stop so the it was basically
[1:14:00] stop but it was still running so all you
[1:14:02] had to do is just turn the knob and you
[1:14:03] can wash the car for free now here's
[1:14:06] what one voice said it's only $4 it's
[1:14:09] not a big deal wash your car real quick
[1:14:11] and it's all done but the other voice
[1:14:14] said that's called stealing and as soon
[1:14:16] as that voice said that it's like
[1:14:19] something took a hold of my finger and
[1:14:21] pressed
[1:14:22] up
[1:14:24] now if that's not the Holy Spirit then
[1:14:25] you tell me what it
[1:14:26] is you see you the holy spirit is what
[1:14:30] takes a hold of you he changes
[1:14:34] you he speaks to you sure there's the
[1:14:37] other voice because remember what
[1:14:39] brother bam said it's a black dog and a
[1:14:42] white dog that are fighting but here's
[1:14:44] the here's the here's the main thing
[1:14:46] which one are you feeding that's
[1:14:49] right I love how Brother David said what
[1:14:52] are you watching on your phone that
[1:14:55] could feed the black dog is that really
[1:14:57] what you want before you know it that
[1:15:00] dog's going to take over that's not what
[1:15:02] we
[1:15:04] want
[1:15:08] Amen in 1963 brother Brenham preached a
[1:15:11] message
[1:15:15] token brother
[1:15:17] Brenham he said he he and he was trying
[1:15:20] to make everyone understand how
[1:15:22] important this token is absolutely and
[1:15:26] that without it there's no Heaven that's
[1:15:28] exactly
[1:15:29] right without that token that's it
[1:15:33] Church the Seven Seals are very
[1:15:38] important whether we understand them all
[1:15:40] or we don't understand them all God will
[1:15:42] reveal it to you yes but here's what
[1:15:45] brother bam said about the
[1:15:47] token he said there's no heaven without
[1:15:49] it that's right that's absolutely right
[1:15:52] now right after the message token in the
[1:15:54] evening he preached a a sermon called
[1:15:56] desperations yes sir and here's what he
[1:15:58] said about this message that he preached
[1:16:00] in the morning he said this
[1:16:03] morning this
[1:16:06] message to me is the Highlight message
[1:16:10] of my entire Ministry absolutely right
[1:16:13] amen that's the truth amen that got me
[1:16:17] right there in other words this is what
[1:16:20] I came for that's exactly right if the
[1:16:23] bride doesn't have the Holy Spirit she
[1:16:24] won't be raptured no that's right she
[1:16:27] will not be raptured exactly right now
[1:16:29] you remember all the virgins were
[1:16:32] sleeping is that right they were all
[1:16:36] sleeping but God sent a voice that's
[1:16:39] right at midnight there was a
[1:16:42] cry wake
[1:16:44] up and they all woke up right but they
[1:16:47] were all
[1:16:48] ready not all of them were
[1:16:51] ready May may the Lord help us to be
[1:16:54] ready amen he said this morning and I'm
[1:16:56] going to end with this if the musicians
[1:16:58] can
[1:16:59] come this morning the message this
[1:17:02] morning to me was the highlight message
[1:17:05] of my entire Ministry you see a
[1:17:09] highlight message of my entire
[1:17:11] Ministry someday I'll tell you how it
[1:17:14] came about now I always wondered if you
[1:17:17] if you ever told it I haven't found it
[1:17:19] if anybody found it I would love to know
[1:17:20] about it and I know know that everything
[1:17:23] has worked for months and months and
[1:17:27] months up to that one message moving up
[1:17:31] to come to that place that was the
[1:17:35] capping off time of it you see the only
[1:17:40] place where you are complete message
[1:17:43] believer is when you are shut in with
[1:17:47] Christ there you will produce the life
[1:17:51] of a True Believer
[1:17:54] that the Lord will reveal to
[1:17:56] you the ministry the mysteries of his
[1:18:00] word that's right Aaron's rod bued and
[1:18:04] brought for almonds
[1:18:06] overnight a dead stick brought fruit
[1:18:09] forth fruit he brought forth almonds
[1:18:13] because that's where he was in the
[1:18:17] beginning so are we dead in our works
[1:18:22] but once we get shot in with God we
[1:18:25] bring forth fruits of the spirit because
[1:18:30] it's not us doing it that's it that's
[1:18:33] it's the holy
[1:18:35] spirit amen may the Lord help us as we
[1:18:39] stand and and I pray that the Lord spoke
[1:18:42] to you this
[1:18:45] evening and I am definitely glad that
[1:18:48] the Lord spoke to
[1:18:49] Meen
[1:18:51] because
[1:18:54] it's one to thing to believe you have
[1:18:56] the Holy Spirit but it's one thing to
[1:19:00] have it it's a totally different thing I
[1:19:03] was deceived I thought I had it
[1:19:06] Saints I thought I had
[1:19:09] it but I deceived myself and you know
[1:19:12] what
[1:19:15] happened God doesn't push anything upon
[1:19:17] us
[1:19:19] no till I got on my knees and I said
[1:19:21] Lord I've been deceived
[1:19:24] oh don't let one night go by anymore
[1:19:28] until I receive the Holy Spirit I got
[1:19:30] desperate Saint amen this is not the
[1:19:32] time to play anymore that's right you're
[1:19:35] only deceiving yourself
[1:19:37] amen you're only deceiving yourself as a
[1:19:40] matter of fact the pastor came to me and
[1:19:41] he said I thought you had it
[1:19:44] too I deceived him I thought I had it he
[1:19:48] thought I had it but in reality I didn't
[1:19:50] have
[1:19:51] it it's time to get serious it
[1:19:56] is Saints which dog are you
[1:20:03] feeding God Wants You for his kingdom
[1:20:06] but he will not force himself he's a
[1:20:10] gentle kind and loving father amen he
[1:20:14] will not push the door
[1:20:16] in he
[1:20:20] knocks and the Bible says if if you
[1:20:27] here and I always
[1:20:29] wondered why wouldn't we
[1:20:33] hear why wouldn't we hear him knock at
[1:20:35] the
[1:20:36] door and the best example that I can
[1:20:39] give you is
[1:20:40] this if you vacuum in your home and
[1:20:43] somebody comes and knocks on the door
[1:20:44] will you hear it probably
[1:20:47] not so the only reason why we maybe
[1:20:49] we're not hearing him is because we're
[1:20:51] too busy with other things
[1:20:53] and we're not paying
[1:20:54] attention he's there
[1:20:57] knocking and you know what he wants to
[1:20:59] do he wants to come
[1:21:02] in and not only that he wants to come in
[1:21:05] he wants to have
[1:21:07] Fellowship see that's all this is all
[1:21:10] about he wants to have a personal
[1:21:13] relationship with you and
[1:21:15] I he wants to ask you what is it that
[1:21:18] you need what is your
[1:21:20] need what can I do for you it's a
[1:21:24] one-on-one conversation you know another
[1:21:28] thing that I personally didn't like at
[1:21:29] the Pentecost
[1:21:31] Souls they believe you're here and God
[1:21:33] is there and that's
[1:21:36] it but CH
[1:21:38] Saints God is with
[1:21:40] you it doesn't matter what you're in
[1:21:43] your car God is there talk to him ask
[1:21:47] Him worship Him have fellowship with
[1:21:51] him that's what he wants to
[1:21:55] do he wants to have
[1:21:58] fellowship may the Lord bless you
[1:22:04] tonight and I pray
[1:22:07] that the Lord spoke to your
[1:22:13] heart and maybe with another
[1:22:16] occasion I will give you a little bit
[1:22:18] more of my
[1:22:20] testimony but praise be to God in all
[1:22:23] things I pray that the Lord will be with
[1:22:25] you I would like to sing song
