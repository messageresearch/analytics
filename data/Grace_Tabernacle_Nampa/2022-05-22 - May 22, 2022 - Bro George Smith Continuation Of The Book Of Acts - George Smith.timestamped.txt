[31:02] this is kind of like what the that'll be
[31:04] all the music
[31:05] yeah your husband does a good job
[31:08] it's kind of like
[31:09] what heaven's going to be like
[31:11] so from here there's something you
[31:13] didn't expect you know see
[31:15] what are you doing here
[31:18] how'd you get here's the question
[31:21] but it's good to see all of you and
[31:23] um
[31:24] to know that god is calling his people
[31:27] from everywhere
[31:29] we don't have the option god knows what
[31:31] he's doing so he's in charge of the
[31:33] whole program
[31:35] you can see from before eden
[31:37] to way out the other way and we're just
[31:39] a little peace
[31:40] now we can't change what happened
[31:42] yesterday it's gone
[31:44] if you did wrong lord forgive me
[31:47] come on in sisters we've got plenty of
[31:48] seats right up front here
[31:50] and um
[31:52] you can affect tomorrow
[31:55] by what you decide today
[31:57] so we have this slice of time to deal
[32:00] with
[32:01] don't worry about the rest right now
[32:04] so let's turn into second corinthians
[32:07] chapter
[32:08] four
[32:11] let's see here
[32:13] this is brother paul speaking
[32:15] and today we're going to continue in the
[32:18] study of the book of acts
[32:20] the book of acts is our
[32:22] road map this is how it all started
[32:25] paul was the first messenger he's
[32:26] setting things in order
[32:28] and uh there's a lot of similarities
[32:30] between between the first messenger and
[32:32] the seventh messenger
[32:34] and so
[32:36] all we're called to do is recognize our
[32:39] position in the scripture
[32:41] and over 200 times brother m says back
[32:43] to the word and if you'll remember the
[32:46] promise in malachi
[32:48] he's going to return
[32:50] elijah's ministry was always to bring
[32:52] back to original amen
[32:54] so ii corinthians chapter 4
[32:58] verses 5 and 6
[33:01] for we preach not ourselves but christ
[33:03] jesus the lord
[33:05] and ourselves your servants for jesus
[33:07] sake
[33:09] so we're only public servants
[33:12] there's no man in charge nobody's
[33:13] managing the bride
[33:15] no
[33:16] we're just his servants for god who
[33:18] commanded the light to shine out of
[33:20] darkness hath shined in our hearts
[33:23] to give
[33:24] the light
[33:25] of the knowledge of the glory of god in
[33:28] the face of jesus christ not in paul not
[33:30] in george not in william branham in
[33:32] jesus christ
[33:35] let us pray father we thank you for your
[33:36] grace we thank you for bringing us all
[33:39] together here this morning
[33:40] we pray lord that you would minister to
[33:42] each one
[33:43] minister to me lord give me my portion
[33:46] and as we go from here later that we
[33:49] could all take a portion and shine the
[33:51] light wherever we go
[33:52] help us now in jesus name amen
[33:55] you may be seated
[34:00] so we thank god for the beautiful
[34:02] weather
[34:04] you know i look on the phone i see where
[34:05] they're having a tremendous heat wave
[34:07] across america
[34:09] well it's not here
[34:12] we're still running on the heater
[34:15] but god has
[34:16] been good to us
[34:18] and um we thank him for his grace now
[34:20] open your bibles to the book of acts
[34:23] last night we finished chapter 20
[34:26] and we will rehearse just a little bit
[34:27] for all of you that
[34:29] had other things to do last night
[34:32] but
[34:32] um at the end of chapter 20
[34:36] we have paul um
[34:38] uh saying goodbye to some people
[34:41] because he was
[34:42] he was determined to go to jerusalem for
[34:45] the feast
[34:47] and he knew what he had to do he knew
[34:48] that god was speaking to him now he had
[34:51] people along the way that he was seeing
[34:53] oh don't go you're god's servant they're
[34:54] going to kill you they're going to
[34:56] thank you i've got to go anyway
[34:59] so in chapter 20
[35:01] of acts
[35:03] in verses 18 through 35 we have the
[35:05] farewell speech
[35:06] to the believers the church leaders
[35:09] and he um
[35:11] he knew that he had to go he wasn't
[35:13] fearing for his safety but if you look
[35:15] at verse let's see chapter 20 look at
[35:18] verse 25
[35:20] and now behold i know that ye all among
[35:23] whom i have gone preaching the kingdom
[35:25] of god
[35:26] shall see my face no more
[35:28] he's dismissing himself from them this
[35:30] this you're not going to see me no more
[35:33] now he was the one that brought the
[35:34] gospel to them
[35:35] by order of the lord and now
[35:38] um
[35:39] he's got to be honest
[35:41] put the happy face on and move on you
[35:43] know verse 27
[35:46] for i have not shunned to declare unto
[35:48] you all the counsel of god i've told you
[35:50] everything i know
[35:51] and look at verse 28 take heed there for
[35:54] you unto yourselves and to all the flock
[35:57] you know he's speaking to the church
[35:58] leaders the pastors and sunday school
[36:00] teachers and such
[36:01] over which the holy ghost hath made you
[36:03] overseers to feed the church of god
[36:07] not to waste time not to be pulpit
[36:09] clowns like brother random said but to
[36:11] feed the flock
[36:13] and you all are very fortunate that you
[36:15] have a pastor that feeds the flock
[36:17] he's not out wasting time he's not you
[36:19] know spending your money going to disney
[36:21] world he's feeding the flock
[36:25] which he had purchased with his own
[36:26] blood
[36:27] for i know this that after i leave
[36:29] grievous wolves
[36:31] they're going to come in and cause
[36:33] trouble and divide things and even among
[36:36] your own selves there'll be men speaking
[36:38] perverse things
[36:39] drawing disciples after themselves we're
[36:41] not looking for a following i don't want
[36:43] anybody to follow me brother brown
[36:45] wasn't looking for a following
[36:47] paul sures are looking for a following
[36:49] just follow the word you know but there
[36:52] will be those that come along yeah i've
[36:54] got the answer i'm going to control you
[36:56] it's happening
[36:58] therefore watch remember that by this
[37:00] space with three years
[37:02] every day and night with tears i
[37:04] ministered to you
[37:06] now brethren i command you to god and to
[37:09] the word of his grace which is able to
[37:11] build you up
[37:12] and give you an inheritance among all
[37:14] them which are sanctified
[37:16] and he goes on
[37:18] to dismiss himself from them in verse 36
[37:22] and when he had thus spoken
[37:24] we kneeled down now remember he's on
[37:26] he's in a boat he's coming down the
[37:28] coast of the mediterranean stopping a
[37:30] couple different places
[37:32] to
[37:32] see the saints
[37:34] well it's not like today they had a they
[37:36] had maybe a little dock of some kind the
[37:38] boat stops and they go into up on the
[37:41] beach a little bit they sent people up
[37:43] there hey go bring the brother we're
[37:44] down here so they're having a little
[37:46] meeting on the shore
[37:47] just in the sand there he said we
[37:50] kneeled down prayed to them all
[37:53] and they all wept sore and fell on
[37:55] paul's neck and kissed him
[37:56] sorrowing most
[37:58] of all
[37:59] for the words which he spake that they
[38:01] should see his face no more
[38:03] and they accompanied him onto the ship
[38:06] goodbye
[38:08] this is their father in the gospel
[38:10] messenger of god
[38:11] and they actually never saw him again
[38:14] later they received a letter that he
[38:16] wrote from prison in rome which we know
[38:18] is the epistle to the ephesians
[38:21] so in chapter 21 the sea journey
[38:23] continues
[38:24] you know
[38:25] and it began in troas that's chapter 20
[38:27] verse 13
[38:29] they were going towards jerusalem
[38:31] now obviously anybody knows anything
[38:32] about the map jerusalem isn't a port
[38:35] city okay so that's where he's headed
[38:38] but um
[38:41] they land at a place called tyre
[38:43] currently in lebanon
[38:45] and ministered to the saints there for a
[38:47] week
[38:48] 21 verse 4
[38:49] and finding disciples we carried there
[38:51] seven days
[38:53] who said to paul through the spirit that
[38:55] he should not go to jerusalem now these
[38:57] people are serious these are prayer
[38:59] warriors and they know that things are
[39:01] going to you know get ugly
[39:03] don't go it's going to be bad for you
[39:05] you know
[39:06] and so verse 5 and when we had
[39:10] accompanied those when we accomplished
[39:11] those days we departed and went our way
[39:15] and they all
[39:16] brought us on our way with wives and
[39:18] children till we were out of the city
[39:21] and kneeled down on the shore and prayed
[39:27] now it's it's pretty tear-jerking when
[39:29] you realize that they're not going to
[39:30] see these these people anymore not going
[39:32] to see paul and we can just see i'm just
[39:35] so glad we have a scripture full of
[39:36] details somebody took the time to write
[39:39] all this down
[39:40] you know
[39:41] for
[39:42] us to learn from
[39:44] you know
[39:45] and so uh they went on their way
[39:48] and um
[39:49] they um
[39:51] came down to a place
[39:54] in the scripture in verse 8 to caesarea
[39:56] caesarea is still here today
[39:58] those who have been over there with me
[39:59] we go to caesarea this is where this
[40:01] port was and you know from there up to
[40:03] jerusalem
[40:05] so
[40:06] in caesarea there was believers that was
[40:08] the home of philip the evangelist we saw
[40:10] him back in chapter six
[40:12] and in verse nine it says and the same
[40:14] man had four daughters virgins which did
[40:17] prophesy
[40:19] so here's the fulfillment one of the
[40:21] fulfillments of joel
[40:23] 2 28 your daughters shall prophesy and
[40:26] was manifested in this in this family
[40:29] verse 10 21 it says and as we tarried
[40:32] their many days there came down from
[40:34] judea a certain prophet named agabus now
[40:37] this is important to notice because i
[40:39] just heard a preaching the other day of
[40:42] a good friend of mine good brother and
[40:44] he's
[40:45] saying that from paul
[40:48] uh
[40:49] until william branham there was no
[40:50] prophets
[40:51] well i'm sorry the bible says there was
[40:53] so we'll just believe the scripture you
[40:55] know
[40:56] and so um
[40:58] this prophet came down named us and when
[41:00] he was come unto us when he came amongst
[41:02] us he took paul's girl and that was a it
[41:04] was a clothing that they had back then
[41:06] and he bound his hands with it and his
[41:08] feet and he said thus saith the holy
[41:10] ghost so shall the jews of jerusalem
[41:12] bind the man that owns this girl and
[41:14] shall deliver him into the hands of the
[41:16] gentiles
[41:17] it's not sounding good is it and when we
[41:20] heard these things both we and they that
[41:22] of that place
[41:23] besought him not to go don't go paul
[41:25] they're going to hurt you then paul said
[41:28] what may need to weep and to break my
[41:30] heart for i am ready not to be bound
[41:33] only but also to die at jerusalem for
[41:36] the name of the lord jesus
[41:39] now that might come to our doorstep one
[41:41] day
[41:42] are we serious enough about this are we
[41:44] just
[41:45] just happy enough yeah god sent a
[41:47] prophet please god i've got i've got a
[41:49] seal book
[41:50] there's a little more to it than that
[41:51] people
[41:52] this is real
[41:54] and the good times are behind us and
[41:56] just because gas is over four dollars a
[41:58] gallon that's only
[41:59] one little sign
[42:00] things are going to get really really
[42:02] bad
[42:03] you better know where you stand and be
[42:06] able to say with paul
[42:08] hey so they take everything away i'm
[42:10] ready to die for him you know
[42:13] we've got to take this really serious so
[42:15] we're preaching from brother random's
[42:17] absolute okay the holy scripture
[42:19] most of you have a black bible i have to
[42:21] have a read one today you know
[42:23] um
[42:25] and so
[42:26] uh the gospel is not complicated
[42:29] you see now every one of us have at
[42:31] least one dollar in our pocket right
[42:34] some of us have some coins
[42:36] some have a five a ten
[42:38] some might have a hundred dollar bill
[42:40] but you have to know when to get which
[42:42] out and when to use it
[42:44] if you're going over to 7-11 and you're
[42:46] going to buy some bubble gum
[42:48] you're not going to get the hundred
[42:49] dollar bill out
[42:50] normally
[42:52] you get out the one dollar or whatever
[42:54] so when we administer the gospel we've
[42:56] got to give it as needed you see
[42:59] first corinthians chapter
[43:02] 2. look at that real quickly
[43:04] because i'm not making a lot of these
[43:06] things up you know
[43:07] first corinthians chapter 2
[43:09] is a very vital scripture for us
[43:13] um
[43:14] we were in second corinthians earlier
[43:16] but first corinthians chapter 2 verse 1
[43:19] and brethren when i came to you
[43:22] came not with excellency of speech or
[43:24] wisdom which he could have he was a very
[43:26] intelligent person
[43:28] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[43:30] for i determined not to know anything
[43:32] among you
[43:33] only jesus christ and him crucified
[43:36] so the gospel is not complicated it's
[43:38] very simple but the bible is full of all
[43:41] kinds of things to feed every person
[43:44] brother branham says we have believers
[43:45] that are we have christians that are
[43:47] a nickel some are a dime some are
[43:49] quarter 50 cents five dollars ten
[43:51] dollars so we have different degrees and
[43:53] when we're preaching to a mixed crowd
[43:55] like this there's all kinds of people
[43:58] and some people stayed up last night who
[44:00] knows what they were doing others you
[44:02] know slept uh we we have people that
[44:04] came ready to hear the gospel
[44:06] so
[44:08] after many warnings from good friends
[44:10] and you know very spiritual people even
[44:13] a vindicated prophet there agabus
[44:15] um
[44:16] paul and associates they arrived in
[44:18] jerusalem verse 17 they were welcomed
[44:20] warmly when we were come to jerusalem
[44:23] the brethren received us gladly
[44:25] acts 21 17 okay
[44:28] so from there
[44:30] um
[44:31] verse 18
[44:33] and the day following paul went in with
[44:35] us unto james and all the elders were
[44:39] present
[44:40] so here's the apostles
[44:42] and
[44:44] this is james from matthew 4 21.
[44:46] now james was a
[44:48] popular name back then
[44:50] because we have james the apostle
[44:52] brother to john the two sims of zebedee
[44:55] that's matthew 10.
[44:56] then we have james the apostle
[44:59] uh son of alphaeus
[45:01] matthew 10 3 also known as james the
[45:04] less
[45:05] you wonder why because he was shorter
[45:07] than his brother
[45:10] you know like david the less you know
[45:14] known as david taller you know so that's
[45:16] why it says that there is james the
[45:19] lord's carnal brother of matthew 13
[45:22] and james the father of judas the
[45:24] apostle luke 60 6 16.
[45:28] so in recent times some scholars have
[45:30] brought it down to two but there are
[45:32] actually five so in jerusalem paul meets
[45:35] with the apostles and church leaders
[45:37] and he tells of the many mighty things
[45:39] that were accomplished in the missionary
[45:41] trips so they were pleased they
[45:43] glorified god
[45:44] and this could have been as late as 56
[45:47] a.d
[45:48] or 20 years after the day of pentecost
[45:50] okay just being put in order
[45:52] and they they said to him now look
[45:54] brother
[45:55] um we have a situation here in jerusalem
[45:58] this is verse 20 through 25
[46:01] and
[46:03] you're aware you know that thousands of
[46:06] jews have believed
[46:08] and they're all you know very zealous of
[46:10] the law
[46:11] but they have been informed about you
[46:13] they know who you are and they're
[46:14] they're watching out for you and they
[46:16] they have been told
[46:18] that you tell the jews out there among
[46:20] the gentiles to forsake prophet moses
[46:23] well he never said that
[46:24] if anything he said this is the
[46:26] fulfillment of what moses said
[46:29] and he says and you've been telling them
[46:30] not to circumcise the little boys he
[46:32] never said that
[46:34] and uh to forsake the customs of the law
[46:36] no just put it in order
[46:39] and so they go on you know and they say
[46:41] you know
[46:42] there's no secrets they know who you are
[46:43] they've heard these rumors so he says we
[46:46] have a plan
[46:47] all this is in here
[46:49] let's kind of condense it for you
[46:51] and
[46:52] it says we have four men that are
[46:53] willing to take a vow now that's a real
[46:56] honest
[46:57] uh promise
[46:58] take them with you purify yourselves pay
[47:01] for their haircut it was important back
[47:03] then
[47:04] and
[47:05] and then all the people will know that
[47:07] these things are false if you do these
[47:09] things you see
[47:10] and showing yourself to fulfill the law
[47:12] and that you obey it
[47:14] so in verse 25 answering some of the
[47:16] questions and providing guidelines for
[47:18] the believing gentiles but in 26 he says
[47:22] here
[47:23] then paul took the man
[47:25] and the next day purifying himself with
[47:27] them entered into the temple to signify
[47:29] the accomplishment of the days of
[47:30] purification until that
[47:32] an offering should be offered for every
[47:34] one of them okay obeying the law of
[47:36] moses following the advice of you know
[47:40] the lord's disciples
[47:43] but once again guess who showed up the
[47:45] twin
[47:48] and brother brandon put it in other
[47:49] words he said in every congregation we
[47:51] have three kinds of believers
[47:54] now it's really easy for us to look you
[47:56] know uh oh you know who that we know
[47:58] which one to use the question
[48:00] don't worry about those other people
[48:02] which one are you
[48:04] maybe when we get to lunch after a while
[48:06] if the lord tarries and y'all behave
[48:10] and we'll see who's commenting on you
[48:12] know the bald preacher or whatever
[48:14] we'll know which one you are
[48:17] so
[48:20] um
[48:22] so the twin appeared because they're
[48:23] always going to be there you see you can
[48:26] always count on until the day of the
[48:27] rapture they'll be nearby
[48:30] look over to first corinthians chapter
[48:32] 10.
[48:34] and don't ever come to church without
[48:35] your bible
[48:37] first corinthians 10 13 says
[48:42] there has no temptation taken you but
[48:44] such as is common to man in other words
[48:46] you're not the first one that suffered
[48:47] this whatever you're going through
[48:49] everybody a lot of people before you
[48:50] suffered
[48:51] but god is faithful who will not
[48:54] allow you to be tempted above that which
[48:56] you are able to bear
[48:58] but will with the temptation also make a
[49:00] way to escape that you may be able to
[49:03] bear it wherefore my beloved brethren
[49:05] flee from idolatry now what's idolatry
[49:07] got to do with this other verse because
[49:09] idolatry is everywhere
[49:12] i know people carrying this king james
[49:14] bible and their little you know fancy
[49:16] tablet and books
[49:18] they're idolaters
[49:20] they're not true believers they're
[49:22] idolaters the only difference between us
[49:24] and the catholics catholics have a
[49:25] candle we've got a little electric light
[49:27] on the on the wall it's the same spirit
[49:30] sorry
[49:31] so
[49:33] uh beware of idolatry
[49:37] back to church chapter 21
[49:39] of acts verse 27
[49:43] and when the seven days were almost
[49:45] ended the jews which were in asia when
[49:47] they saw him in the temple stirred up
[49:50] all the people and laid hands on them
[49:53] that wasn't in blessing that means they
[49:55] grabbed their hide and they're gonna
[49:56] take you to the law that's what that
[49:57] means
[49:59] crying out men of israel help
[50:02] this is the man that teaches all men
[50:05] everywhere against the people and the
[50:08] law in this place
[50:10] not true
[50:11] and furthermore brought the greeks also
[50:13] into the temple which was you know not
[50:14] proper
[50:16] and has polluted this holy place
[50:20] for they had seen before with him in
[50:22] this city um tromphimas and ephesian who
[50:26] they supposed aha they were guessing
[50:29] they didn't know
[50:30] that paul had brought him into the
[50:31] temple so
[50:33] here's another riot in jerusalem we just
[50:35] had a few you know in the past chapters
[50:37] here's another riot in jerusalem there's
[50:39] great confusion just like the riots that
[50:41] we've had in our
[50:42] country confusion there's no order no
[50:45] respect no nothing they grabbed paul and
[50:48] the plan was to kill him right there
[50:50] because we killed this man we can solve
[50:52] all this you know this problem
[50:54] that was their plan and they were going
[50:56] to beat him to death
[50:58] verse 31
[50:59] and as they went about to kill him
[51:02] news came unto the chief captain of the
[51:04] band in other words chief of police
[51:06] that all jerusalem was in an uproar
[51:09] so
[51:10] mainly because of a rumor a supposition
[51:13] that's why the this uproar you know
[51:16] meanwhile someone went and reported the
[51:17] activities to the captain the chief
[51:19] police
[51:20] and he took a bunch of soldiers
[51:22] and went to check it out what's going on
[51:24] here we're trying we're trying to keep
[51:24] order here in jerusalem you know
[51:27] and when these people saw him coming
[51:29] they quit beating paul
[51:32] so the soldiers restrained him
[51:34] paul they put him in chains
[51:36] why is that
[51:37] well they asked who he was what this is
[51:40] all about
[51:41] and the crowd began
[51:42] shouting all kinds of accusations some
[51:44] contradicting each other nothing was
[51:47] understood so the captain ordered okay
[51:49] take him back to headquarters for his
[51:51] protection you know
[51:52] so due to the violence of the people
[51:55] uh and these aren't communists these
[51:57] aren't you know
[51:58] no these are religious people
[52:01] these are people that study their
[52:02] prophets words perfectly
[52:05] but this guy we don't like him because
[52:07] he's he's not like us he's he he used to
[52:10] be with us he used to persecute the
[52:12] christians but now he's on their side
[52:15] we've got to kill him
[52:18] they put him in they took him to
[52:19] headquarters and um
[52:21] and uh when they were going up the
[52:23] stairs into the building
[52:25] the people shouting
[52:27] and that he should die
[52:29] no evidence only supposition confusion
[52:33] okay take a break here look at first
[52:34] corinthians chapter four
[52:37] yeah we're going to go back and forth
[52:38] fourteen first corinthians 14 33 what do
[52:41] we have here
[52:43] um
[52:48] 33 for god is not the author of
[52:50] confusion but of peace
[52:52] as in all churches of the saints
[52:55] so if you're in town or if you're in a
[52:58] so-called message church and there's
[52:59] confusion
[53:01] you might want to just take your bible
[53:02] and go back to the car because that is
[53:04] not of god
[53:06] and some of us have been in those kind
[53:07] of meetings
[53:08] rebecca and i walked out of more than
[53:10] one service while it was going on
[53:12] because it's confusion all in the name
[53:14] of the message
[53:15] amen
[53:17] okay back to our story acts 21
[53:20] so they were so blindly loyal to their
[53:23] religion
[53:24] what they thought to be truth quoting
[53:27] their prophet
[53:28] ready to kill anyone who did not exceed
[53:31] exactly things their way
[53:33] they were blind fanatics
[53:36] we still got them
[53:37] sad to say
[53:39] so they were ready to die and ready to
[53:41] kill for their view of the god of
[53:43] yesterday
[53:45] we got the same thing going on today
[53:48] right now sunday
[53:50] totally ignoring what god was doing
[53:52] present tense
[53:54] not interested in what the future might
[53:55] be
[53:56] they were content with forms
[53:59] rituals
[54:00] quoting verbatim
[54:02] but no life
[54:04] quoting verbatim doesn't bring life
[54:07] willing to kill anybody with a different
[54:09] view now that isn't just the muslims
[54:11] okay
[54:13] that's branamite sometimes
[54:15] i've been around the world i've seen
[54:16] some of them
[54:18] so
[54:20] the revealed word was a foreign concept
[54:22] to them you see
[54:23] all they cared about what did prophet
[54:25] moses say
[54:26] you'd be surprised the prophet the calls
[54:28] that me or paul gets when you know
[54:30] families go along they're not paying
[54:32] attention they're not pen ties they're
[54:33] just kind of drifting you know and then
[54:35] they get in trouble
[54:37] their children get in trouble of
[54:40] whatever kind
[54:41] first thing i want to say what'd brother
[54:43] rhyme say
[54:44] well honey you're a little late for that
[54:46] you know this isn't the time for for
[54:47] band-aids this is time for major surgery
[54:51] so
[54:52] but very selectively they ignore parts
[54:55] that were not convenient to their views
[54:57] and of course
[54:58] back then no actual recording you know
[55:02] so
[55:03] where are we at here you see god's word
[55:05] is never stagnant it's moving it's
[55:07] moving
[55:08] just like that canal out there that
[55:09] water's moving all the time
[55:12] all these plants that are growing
[55:13] they're growing every day you see that's
[55:15] god's word it's always moving
[55:17] it's the truth only truth that you can
[55:19] depend on
[55:21] because the scripture says heaven and
[55:22] earth all this is pretty all it's nice
[55:25] it's all going to burn people
[55:27] all the bibles are going to burn amen
[55:29] but my word is established in heaven and
[55:31] it shall remain forever
[55:34] so the word of god is living it's moving
[55:38] and god will find someone
[55:40] through whom he can make it come alive
[55:42] he all he needs is yielded vessels yes
[55:45] lord thy will be done
[55:46] not what i think no
[55:48] no
[55:49] so he has no hands but your hands these
[55:52] are you know god can operate through
[55:53] your hands through your eyes your mouth
[55:55] your feet
[55:56] but we got
[55:58] we must be totally yielded for him to
[56:00] use us to be able to use this you see
[56:03] and um
[56:05] brother branham was a born seer a
[56:07] prophet that came down through go listen
[56:09] to that first tape uh faith is the
[56:11] substance april 1947.
[56:14] he starts off yeah god moved orbits
[56:17] somehow to bring this gift to the earth
[56:20] in 47 he's not he's telling you that
[56:22] that happened years before
[56:24] and he's basically telling and y'all not
[56:26] paying attention that's it you know and
[56:28] here we are today so he was born a seer
[56:32] but god could only use him properly when
[56:35] he was yielded completely
[56:38] and it was obvious something different
[56:39] about this boy but when he came to the
[56:41] foot of the cross then god could use him
[56:44] so you want to quote what he says
[56:46] i'm just a sinner saved by grace
[56:49] that won't be quoted today in a lot of
[56:50] places
[56:53] and god can withdraw his mercy from me
[56:55] at any time he desires
[56:57] so let's quote it off we're going to
[56:59] start quoting
[57:00] so what about us do we think we're
[57:02] somebody special because we've come to a
[57:04] certain level of life
[57:07] because we've got a good pastor because
[57:08] we've got our little tablet we've got
[57:09] our stuff
[57:10] does that make us special no
[57:12] only thing that makes us special is that
[57:15] god has trusted you
[57:17] to live out your portion
[57:19] of the drama here in laodicea
[57:21] the darkest age of all
[57:24] see
[57:25] all the saints of all the ages are
[57:27] depending on you and me to live out our
[57:29] part of the drama
[57:31] and not give up you see
[57:33] because they without us laid asia are
[57:36] not made perfect
[57:38] so may god have mercy on us
[57:40] okay back to our story acts 21 37 where
[57:43] are we at
[57:45] let's see here
[57:47] um
[57:48] and as paul was led into the castle so
[57:51] he's on the stairway
[57:53] all these people are screaming and
[57:54] shouting
[57:55] and he's in chains he's taken in for his
[57:58] own safety
[57:59] as he's going up the stairs he said to
[58:01] the chief captain
[58:03] may i speak to you
[58:05] and uh and the captain says oh you can
[58:08] speak greek they don't know who he is
[58:11] see even not
[58:12] he didn't look like anybody special
[58:15] and um art aren't you that the egyptian
[58:18] came a few days and made an uproar and
[58:21] led people out to the wilderness four
[58:22] thousand men
[58:23] and that must there were murderers
[58:26] aren't you that guy
[58:27] paul said i am a man
[58:30] which i'm a jew of tarsus
[58:33] a city in cilicia
[58:35] a citizen of no mean city and i beseech
[58:38] she suffered me to speak to the people
[58:41] now here's at least 5 000 people out
[58:43] here
[58:43] screaming and hollering they're mad
[58:45] they're ready to
[58:46] you know stab somebody
[58:49] can i speak to him
[58:50] and when he had given him license
[58:53] paul stood on the stairs
[58:55] lifted up his hand to the people
[58:58] and there was great silence
[59:00] he's speaking to them in the hebrew
[59:01] tongue
[59:02] so he's at least two or three languages
[59:04] the man is intelligent
[59:07] so
[59:08] quite a story
[59:09] we can make a movie out of those last
[59:11] few verses
[59:14] so what did paul look like at this point
[59:16] he didn't look like a preacher
[59:19] he was bloody he's tattered
[59:21] very scroungy
[59:23] he quieted the crowd it's a religious
[59:25] crowd
[59:26] without a microphone
[59:28] he began
[59:29] to tell his
[59:30] story
[59:32] chapter 22
[59:35] men and brethren and fathers hear ye my
[59:37] defense which i make unto you
[59:42] and when they heard that he spoke the
[59:43] hebrew tongue to them
[59:45] they kept them more silence
[59:48] now silencing a
[59:50] angry mob is not easy
[59:53] all they want to do is kill him they're
[59:54] screaming
[59:56] so he's got him quiet now they're real
[59:57] quiet because he's speaking their
[59:58] language
[59:59] i am verily a man which am a jew born in
[1:00:02] tarsus the city of cilicia yet brought
[1:00:05] up in this city at the feet of gamaliel
[1:00:07] okay and taught according to the perfect
[1:00:10] manner of the law of the fathers and was
[1:00:11] zealous towards god as ye all are this
[1:00:15] day in other words i'm just as
[1:00:17] zealous for the truth as you all are
[1:00:19] pay attention
[1:00:21] and i persecuted this way
[1:00:23] unto the death i had helped kill many
[1:00:25] many christians
[1:00:27] binding and delivering into the prisons
[1:00:29] both men and women
[1:00:32] so he tells the story on through the
[1:00:33] chapter let's pick it up in verse 17.
[1:00:37] and it came to pass that when i was come
[1:00:39] again to jerusalem even while i prayed
[1:00:42] in the temple i was in a trance in other
[1:00:44] words like in a vision you know
[1:00:47] and i saw him saying unto me make haste
[1:00:51] and get thee quickly out of jerusalem
[1:00:53] for they will not receive thy testimony
[1:00:55] concerning me it's jesus talking to paul
[1:00:58] and i said
[1:01:01] and i said lord
[1:01:03] they know that i imprisoned and beat in
[1:01:05] every synagogue them and believed on
[1:01:07] thee
[1:01:08] he's talking about our family
[1:01:11] yeah those were our relatives back there
[1:01:13] that he helped kill
[1:01:15] and he's aware of that
[1:01:17] 20
[1:01:18] and when the blood of thy martyr stephen
[1:01:20] was shed
[1:01:22] i also was standing there
[1:01:24] and consenting unto his death
[1:01:26] and kept arraignment of them that slew
[1:01:28] him so remember back in the early
[1:01:29] chapter i told you he was a young man
[1:01:32] and all he did was was keep the stuff
[1:01:34] and they're throwing the rocks
[1:01:36] but he was part of it and that stayed in
[1:01:38] his mind till his last day
[1:01:42] and he said unto me depart
[1:01:44] i will be with thee hence
[1:01:46] uh unto the gentiles in other words it's
[1:01:49] time to turn the corner
[1:01:51] and they gave him audience unto his word
[1:01:53] and then lifted up their voices and said
[1:01:56] away with such a fellow from the earth
[1:01:58] for it's not fit that he should live
[1:02:00] in other words he's taking up too much
[1:02:02] oxygen
[1:02:03] get rid of him now he's just told him
[1:02:05] the truth give him a bare bones
[1:02:06] testimony they still want to kill him
[1:02:09] and as they cried out and cast off their
[1:02:11] clothes and threw dust in the air can
[1:02:14] you imagine they are violent
[1:02:17] the chief
[1:02:18] captain commanded him to be brought into
[1:02:20] the castle in other words into the
[1:02:22] headquarters
[1:02:23] and um that he should be examined by
[1:02:26] scourging that he might know where
[1:02:29] they cried so much against him
[1:02:31] now scourge means to harass to whip
[1:02:34] severely with no mercy
[1:02:36] in other words we're going to beat the
[1:02:37] truth out of you one way or another
[1:02:39] because what you said right now didn't
[1:02:41] seem to solve the problem look at it
[1:02:42] they're still they're still mad
[1:02:45] so from chapter 21
[1:02:47] paul is in jail
[1:02:49] for his protection from religious
[1:02:50] fanatics
[1:02:52] and since the jews were so upset with
[1:02:54] him he must be guilty of something
[1:02:56] i mean this this roman uh police he
[1:02:59] doesn't know nothing you know he's got
[1:03:00] to keep order so what do we have here
[1:03:03] 25
[1:03:04] and as they bound him with thongs that
[1:03:07] don't get too excited thongs words have
[1:03:10] changed meanings here that it was a long
[1:03:12] leather strap
[1:03:14] that they used to bind him like a
[1:03:15] straitjacket keep him in custody okay
[1:03:18] and the chief doesn't know who this is
[1:03:21] or why the people are ready to kill him
[1:03:24] and so this roman officer just a public
[1:03:26] servant has no revelation no interest in
[1:03:29] the fanatical religion of the jews
[1:03:31] that's their problem but he's
[1:03:33] responsible for the peace of jerusalem
[1:03:36] so he has to get to the bottom of the
[1:03:37] problem
[1:03:39] paul said unto the centurion that stood
[1:03:41] by
[1:03:42] uh is it lawful for
[1:03:45] a roman
[1:03:48] uh is it where is it out here is it
[1:03:50] lawful for you to scourge in other words
[1:03:52] whip unmercifully a man that is a roman
[1:03:55] and uncondemned
[1:03:57] we got a problem
[1:03:59] when the centurion heard that he went
[1:04:01] and told the chief captain uh you better
[1:04:03] be careful this man is a roman
[1:04:06] then the chief captain came and said
[1:04:08] unto him
[1:04:10] um tell me sir you're a roman yes
[1:04:14] and the chief captain answered with a
[1:04:15] great
[1:04:16] uh he said with a great sum of money i
[1:04:18] obtained my freedom
[1:04:20] and paul
[1:04:22] paul said
[1:04:24] i was born free
[1:04:26] i'm a roman i'm born free
[1:04:30] then straight away they departed from
[1:04:31] him which should have examined him in
[1:04:33] other words all these guys with their
[1:04:35] whips and things
[1:04:36] the chief captain also was afraid
[1:04:38] after he knew that he was roman
[1:04:40] and
[1:04:41] because he had bound him in other words
[1:04:43] it might come down on my head
[1:04:45] got to be careful
[1:04:47] so
[1:04:49] in 2230 he can't figure this out by
[1:04:51] himself and he wants to find the truth
[1:04:54] so he called together the high priest
[1:04:56] and his counsel let's go over here and
[1:04:58] see let these guys examine him now this
[1:05:00] is what we call the sanhedrin okay
[1:05:03] it's the high court of the land
[1:05:05] it's a group of 71 members divided into
[1:05:08] three groups this is very complicated
[1:05:10] but it's the truth
[1:05:11] there's the chief priests the elders and
[1:05:13] the scribes
[1:05:15] they were the religious rulers
[1:05:17] and they interpreted moses law
[1:05:20] and made the decisions
[1:05:22] but they could not issue the death
[1:05:23] penalty
[1:05:25] and they're still there today the high
[1:05:26] court of israel
[1:05:28] interprets
[1:05:29] they won't there's no death penalty but
[1:05:31] they'd make all the decisions even to
[1:05:32] divorce and so forth
[1:05:34] so the high priest presided over this
[1:05:36] nation's highest administrative judicial
[1:05:38] body
[1:05:39] right below the high priest in rank was
[1:05:41] an exclusive group of 200 pure-blooded
[1:05:44] jews
[1:05:45] and below those were 200
[1:05:47] was another 7 000 or more just ordinary
[1:05:50] priests
[1:05:52] and all these men could trace their
[1:05:53] roots right back to aaron
[1:05:55] they had it done perfectly
[1:05:57] and um
[1:05:59] the first high priest you know brother
[1:06:00] moses and they were divided into 24
[1:06:03] priestly clans in each group served a
[1:06:06] week at a time
[1:06:08] in the temple
[1:06:09] so you can get the picture these people
[1:06:11] were in charge but under the watchful
[1:06:14] eye of the romans okay
[1:06:16] and only the romans could administer the
[1:06:18] death penalty so they had to work
[1:06:19] together
[1:06:21] okay
[1:06:22] it just so happens that this is the
[1:06:24] fifth
[1:06:25] occasion
[1:06:26] when these men with all the power
[1:06:29] are called upon to render
[1:06:31] an official decision regarding the
[1:06:33] claims of christ and his followers
[1:06:36] concerning his very person
[1:06:38] they wished it would all just go away
[1:06:40] you see but it's not still here today
[1:06:43] yeah they wish to all go away and
[1:06:49] why because jesus christ was and is the
[1:06:51] fulfillment of the words of all the
[1:06:53] prophets you see that these people claim
[1:06:56] to follow that they had memorized they
[1:06:58] memorized all this stuff and here's the
[1:06:59] man fulfilling it all
[1:07:01] done that up we don't believe that can't
[1:07:03] be got to kill them
[1:07:05] and so they were falling into the letter
[1:07:06] of the law but they failed to see the
[1:07:08] manifestation
[1:07:10] that's why the catholic church looks at
[1:07:11] romans it looks at matthew 19 28 19 in
[1:07:15] the name
[1:07:16] and right today
[1:07:18] the pope has an audience got you know
[1:07:19] twenty thousand people
[1:07:25] what jesus said yeah but where's the
[1:07:27] manifestation of it what life is that
[1:07:29] produced nothing
[1:07:31] so
[1:07:33] they were just on the wrong side you see
[1:07:35] on the blind side of the issue
[1:07:37] very good at repeating what their
[1:07:39] prophet said but zero revelation and
[1:07:42] ready to punish anyone with a different
[1:07:45] viewpoint
[1:07:46] especially if there would be some
[1:07:48] manifestation of the words of one of
[1:07:50] those prophets
[1:07:52] they want it in cold stone they don't
[1:07:54] want to see life that's it
[1:07:57] so they had so where's i told you it was
[1:07:59] five minutes there was the fifth
[1:08:00] occasion first they had jesus himself on
[1:08:03] the stand luke 22
[1:08:05] and when he was on his way to calvary to
[1:08:07] die for you and me that's when they it
[1:08:09] was the first
[1:08:10] time that this uh
[1:08:12] this group of men made a decision
[1:08:15] after the healing of the lame man
[1:08:17] at the gate called beautiful
[1:08:19] peter and john were questioned
[1:08:21] by the same tribunal
[1:08:23] but what power and what name have you
[1:08:25] done all this
[1:08:26] in acts chapter 4
[1:08:28] and then the apostles you know they had
[1:08:30] a marvelous meeting
[1:08:32] manifestations of the power of god acts
[1:08:34] chapter five
[1:08:36] number four was the trial of the death
[1:08:37] of
[1:08:38] stephen yeah chapter six
[1:08:41] and now 20 years after the crucifixion
[1:08:44] paul is facing this same court
[1:08:46] different individuals
[1:08:48] but the exact same spirit only more
[1:08:50] corrupt and more arrogant
[1:08:55] chapter 22 verse 30
[1:08:58] says
[1:08:59] and on the moral in other words the next
[1:09:01] day because he would have known of
[1:09:03] certainty whereof he was accused of the
[1:09:05] jews
[1:09:07] this is talking about this
[1:09:09] this uh chief of police guy here
[1:09:11] he loosed him of his bands
[1:09:14] and uh commanded the chief priest
[1:09:16] uh and all their counsel to appear and
[1:09:18] brought paul down and set him before
[1:09:20] them so here's paul
[1:09:23] hands free here's the court
[1:09:25] you know the high court
[1:09:28] and
[1:09:29] puts them before him
[1:09:31] and
[1:09:32] he's on trial and we're going to move
[1:09:34] ahead because we've got plenty of time
[1:09:37] nobody has to go anywhere for lunch it's
[1:09:39] downstairs
[1:09:41] and a little fasting would do you some
[1:09:43] good
[1:09:45] so the scene is paul standing before the
[1:09:47] high council
[1:09:50] 23 verse 1. and paul earnestly be
[1:09:52] holding the council so he's looking at
[1:09:53] the council eyeballing all these people
[1:09:56] men and brethren
[1:09:58] i have lived in all good conscience
[1:10:00] before god until this day
[1:10:03] with his opening statement he
[1:10:05] establishes the foundation i've been
[1:10:08] honest
[1:10:09] you know
[1:10:10] see god knows that none of us are
[1:10:12] sinless we all got problems see
[1:10:15] but he calls for us to be honest
[1:10:18] if we say that we have no sin we deceive
[1:10:20] ourselves and the truth is not in us
[1:10:22] first john chapter one
[1:10:24] as paul stood before this hostile
[1:10:27] council
[1:10:28] he could honestly declare that he had a
[1:10:31] clear conscience
[1:10:32] yes he had killed a lot of people but he
[1:10:34] came to repentance
[1:10:36] if you if you study the life of david
[1:10:38] you wouldn't want him anywhere near your
[1:10:40] family
[1:10:41] but david knew how to repent
[1:10:43] you see
[1:10:44] he had a clear conscience so honesty and
[1:10:47] clear conscience are not the same as
[1:10:49] perfection okay
[1:10:50] another thing to consider
[1:10:52] paul was by no means perfect
[1:10:55] he was totally forgiven and was honest
[1:10:57] about his failures as we'll see later
[1:11:00] so in a total fit of anger okay you got
[1:11:02] the scene he here's paul and here's his
[1:11:05] counsel and he's i'm clean
[1:11:07] so in a total fit of anger
[1:11:09] um
[1:11:11] he says here what happened in verse two
[1:11:13] the high priest ananias commanded those
[1:11:16] that stood by him you know the guards
[1:11:18] smacked that guy in the mouth knock his
[1:11:20] teeth out you know
[1:11:23] yeah
[1:11:24] and um then paul remember how brother
[1:11:27] branham described him he wasn't no saint
[1:11:32] it's like the the jews they you know
[1:11:33] they study uh elijah when from babies on
[1:11:37] and they say now now elijah was a nice
[1:11:39] guy but you didn't want to push him too
[1:11:41] far
[1:11:42] so here's paul
[1:11:45] where brother madam says he was
[1:11:47] he hooked nose
[1:11:49] high-tempered sarcastic jew
[1:11:52] so when he gets smacked in the head
[1:11:54] totally surprised he loses his cool from
[1:11:57] in it then paul said unto him god smite
[1:12:00] thee
[1:12:01] thou whited wall
[1:12:03] you sit up there to judge
[1:12:06] and smites me contrary to the law
[1:12:09] ooh we've got a problem here
[1:12:11] so then the court flunked in chapter in
[1:12:12] verse 4 then they stood by said are you
[1:12:15] reviling god's high priest are you
[1:12:17] speaking against the man
[1:12:19] and paul apologized okay i'm sorry
[1:12:22] he said uh verse 5 i didn't know
[1:12:24] brethren that he was the high priest for
[1:12:27] it's written
[1:12:28] quote in scripture thou shalt not speak
[1:12:30] evil of the ruler of thy people
[1:12:33] but when paul perceived that the one
[1:12:36] part of the sadducees and the other
[1:12:38] pharisees so he discerned there was a
[1:12:40] division there he cried out to the
[1:12:42] council men and brethren i'm a pharisee
[1:12:45] the son of a pharisee
[1:12:47] of the
[1:12:48] of the hope of the resurrection of the
[1:12:50] dead i'm called in question
[1:12:53] and when
[1:12:54] and when he said uh had said that
[1:12:57] there arose a dissension between the
[1:12:59] pharisees and the sadducees over here
[1:13:01] and the multitude was divided so we've
[1:13:03] got more confusion
[1:13:05] for the sadducees say there's no
[1:13:06] resurrection
[1:13:08] neither angel nor spirit nor nothing you
[1:13:10] know and the pharisees confess both
[1:13:13] and there arose great cry and the
[1:13:15] scribes that were of the pharisees part
[1:13:18] arose and strove saying
[1:13:21] we find no evil in this man
[1:13:23] that if the spirit or an angel has
[1:13:26] spoken to him let's not fight against
[1:13:28] god i mean they release no common sense
[1:13:31] and when there arose a great dissension
[1:13:34] the chief captain fearing les paul
[1:13:36] should have been pulled in pieces
[1:13:38] commanded the soldiers
[1:13:40] but had been changed taken back to
[1:13:41] prison
[1:13:42] he said no this is crazy
[1:13:44] people don't even know what you believe
[1:13:47] and the night following the lord stood
[1:13:48] by paul
[1:13:50] and said
[1:13:51] be of good cheer paul no problem
[1:13:54] for as thou has testified of me in
[1:13:56] jerusalem
[1:13:58] so must you bear witness also
[1:14:00] at rome
[1:14:03] now he paul can't see the future but god
[1:14:06] was faithful
[1:14:07] okay we have this problem here you're
[1:14:09] gonna testify also in rome
[1:14:13] see god was confirming his eternal word
[1:14:16] matthew 28 20 i am with you
[1:14:19] always even to the end of the world amen
[1:14:22] we're not there yet
[1:14:24] it's still out ahead there so when you
[1:14:26] think you just
[1:14:27] got on your last string
[1:14:29] i'm with you always
[1:14:32] okay
[1:14:34] so verse 12
[1:14:36] and when it was day certain of the jews
[1:14:38] banded together okay so now they had
[1:14:40] this uproar and all this confusion
[1:14:42] so the next day
[1:14:43] some of the jews got themselves together
[1:14:46] and
[1:14:47] under a curse not under a blessing
[1:14:50] saying that they would neither eat nor
[1:14:52] drink
[1:14:53] till they hit kill paul that's pretty
[1:14:56] serious
[1:14:57] we all know we've got to have some water
[1:14:59] got to have some food you know you get
[1:15:01] angry and you get you lose your mind you
[1:15:02] know and that's about where they were
[1:15:05] and there was about 40 of them
[1:15:07] it says here
[1:15:09] that made this conspiracy
[1:15:12] and they came to the chief priests and
[1:15:14] elders and said uh we have bound
[1:15:16] ourselves under a great curse
[1:15:18] that we will eat nothing
[1:15:20] until we have slain paul
[1:15:23] now
[1:15:24] god's elect have been under assault
[1:15:27] since the garden of eden yes sir
[1:15:30] that's right it's bible
[1:15:32] and
[1:15:34] cain he was so mad i see just look at
[1:15:38] that for a minute here's cain and abel
[1:15:40] the only you know children at that point
[1:15:42] as far as we know there was obviously
[1:15:44] some others but anyway there's these two
[1:15:46] boys they were religious they knew to
[1:15:49] worship god they built a nice altar you
[1:15:51] know
[1:15:52] this one's got
[1:15:54] flowers and pomegranates and watermelons
[1:15:57] all kinds of beautiful fruit and flowers
[1:16:00] and over there is just some rocks
[1:16:02] and they're worshiping
[1:16:04] now the first thing you want to remember
[1:16:06] those parents never told the children
[1:16:09] the whole story of what happened in the
[1:16:11] garden
[1:16:13] if they told them all that would be no
[1:16:15] revelation to it
[1:16:16] so they didn't tell them the whole story
[1:16:19] so here they are worshiping god and god
[1:16:21] comes down and blesses
[1:16:23] abel with his slain lamb and all his
[1:16:25] blood and all this you know nothing
[1:16:27] pretty here
[1:16:29] and the other guy is all upset because
[1:16:30] and i went to all this effort and grew
[1:16:32] all these vegetables and all this stuff
[1:16:34] and you're blessing him
[1:16:36] and and so god says
[1:16:38] that's true
[1:16:39] and if you'll do the same i'll bless you
[1:16:42] he gave him an open door
[1:16:44] and he said i don't care i'll do it my
[1:16:46] way so
[1:16:48] remember this
[1:16:50] see he wasn't balanced
[1:16:51] he was off
[1:16:53] way off someplace
[1:16:55] and so he refused got so mad he killed
[1:16:57] his brother
[1:16:59] and so they just simply had a different
[1:17:00] revelation they believed differently
[1:17:03] to get here today you had to come by a
[1:17:05] lot of churches
[1:17:07] they're much prettier
[1:17:08] much taller
[1:17:10] got better seats probably
[1:17:13] but they have a different revelation
[1:17:15] they're going the wrong direction
[1:17:17] you know
[1:17:18] and the spirit of arrogance cannot stand
[1:17:20] it when there's at least bit of
[1:17:21] opposition to their way of thinking
[1:17:23] you run into people like that they just
[1:17:25] can't stand it you know
[1:17:28] the christians can mostly get along in
[1:17:30] this world they live and let live
[1:17:32] but the muslims want total domination
[1:17:35] and i'm sorry if some of you got
[1:17:37] relatives that are muslim but you know
[1:17:38] that's the truth
[1:17:40] i got friends in south africa and this
[1:17:42] one lady says yeah my sister she's got
[1:17:45] the little romantic dot you know and and
[1:17:47] and she bows five times a day and oh so
[1:17:49] holy
[1:17:51] what comes out of her mouth ooh
[1:17:56] so it's very dangerous you see
[1:17:58] the jews
[1:18:00] just to take their side for a minute
[1:18:02] they are one part muslims are 999 parts
[1:18:06] but they can't stand that one part they
[1:18:07] want to wipe that off also
[1:18:10] so the bride is not looking to just get
[1:18:12] along but to live out our part of the
[1:18:14] drama and live on us before god
[1:18:17] and he will take us home according to
[1:18:19] his promise okay
[1:18:21] god will unfold his word right on
[1:18:23] schedule
[1:18:25] because none of us
[1:18:27] was looking for elijah
[1:18:29] we were busy in our denomination or our
[1:18:31] drinking whatever we were doing
[1:18:33] that was far away
[1:18:34] god had mercy shined the light across us
[1:18:36] because we were born before the
[1:18:38] foundation of the world was something in
[1:18:39] us
[1:18:40] it came to light you see
[1:18:42] but um
[1:18:44] according to his promise he fulfilled it
[1:18:46] so he unfolds his word right on schedule
[1:18:49] and now you're you're on the path you
[1:18:51] see
[1:18:51] so don't try to figure it out just be
[1:18:55] faithful and obedient
[1:18:58] on a sunday morning brother branham
[1:18:59] stood in the pulp and he said and you
[1:19:01] people with these saw blade tempers
[1:19:07] it's always spouting off the mouth at
[1:19:09] somebody
[1:19:10] can't put up things like that
[1:19:13] be careful you're guilty if you speak a
[1:19:15] word against your brother a word
[1:19:18] that's not right
[1:19:19] not just go around and tear down
[1:19:22] you don't have to stick a knife in a
[1:19:24] man's back to kill him
[1:19:26] you can break his character and kill his
[1:19:29] influence
[1:19:32] okay so that's spoken in 57 what about
[1:19:34] 2022
[1:19:37] how does that happen by running your
[1:19:38] mouth without a filter
[1:19:46] in john 12
[1:19:48] let's look at that real quick we're just
[1:19:50] having sunday school nobody's in a hurry
[1:19:53] john chapter 12 and verse 9. what do we
[1:19:55] have here
[1:19:57] 12 and 9
[1:20:00] much people of the jews therefore knew
[1:20:02] that he was there
[1:20:04] he said this is over
[1:20:07] mary and martha's house
[1:20:08] and they came not for jesus sake only
[1:20:10] but they might see lazarus whom he had
[1:20:12] raised from the dead
[1:20:14] okay
[1:20:15] verse 10
[1:20:16] but the chief priests consulted
[1:20:19] that they might put lazarus also to
[1:20:22] death
[1:20:23] well wait a minute aren't you guys happy
[1:20:25] that
[1:20:25] this is never y'all never saw that in
[1:20:27] your church
[1:20:28] here's a guy raised from dead you want
[1:20:29] to kill him again get rid of this it's
[1:20:31] crazy
[1:20:33] because but that by reason of him many
[1:20:35] of the jews went away and believed on
[1:20:37] jesus well thank you lord
[1:20:40] same things happening today
[1:20:43] so
[1:20:44] now here in the book of acts in early
[1:20:47] church they continue under the same evil
[1:20:49] anointing kill and destroy so back over
[1:20:52] here in 23 that we're at these these 40
[1:20:56] people
[1:20:57] in verse 12 they're very serious okay
[1:21:01] a total fast we're not going to take one
[1:21:03] bite until paul's not breathing
[1:21:05] let's see how that unfolds
[1:21:07] chapter 23 verse 14.
[1:21:10] okay they came to chief phrase we're
[1:21:12] going to want to kill him so forth 15.
[1:21:15] now therefore
[1:21:16] ye with the council signify to the chief
[1:21:18] captain
[1:21:20] in other words you know you talk to
[1:21:21] those other guys bring him down tomorrow
[1:21:23] as though you were to inquire something
[1:21:25] more perfectly firm in we want to
[1:21:27] retrial here
[1:21:28] and we
[1:21:29] or ever
[1:21:30] um
[1:21:32] he comes near another door when he when
[1:21:33] you bring him out of the castle we'll
[1:21:34] take care of business we're going to
[1:21:36] kill him when he comes down
[1:21:38] and
[1:21:40] and when paul's sister's son oh so he's
[1:21:43] got family so here's his his nephew
[1:21:46] heard them saying this that they're
[1:21:47] laying in weight these 40 guys he went
[1:21:50] into the castle and told paul hey uncle
[1:21:52] guess what
[1:21:53] and paul called one of the centurions
[1:21:55] and he said bring this young man into
[1:21:57] the chief captain
[1:21:58] he's got something to tell him
[1:22:01] so he took him
[1:22:02] brought him in
[1:22:04] and
[1:22:06] he told him the story
[1:22:08] and he told him don't tell anybody else
[1:22:10] 19. the chief captain took him by the
[1:22:12] hand
[1:22:13] when i went aside privately
[1:22:16] uh
[1:22:16] what is this you got to tell me and he
[1:22:18] said the jews have agreed to desire the
[1:22:22] that that would bring paul down tomorrow
[1:22:24] to the council as though they would you
[1:22:26] know have further inquiry
[1:22:29] but do not yield unto them for their
[1:22:31] they are lying in weight
[1:22:33] forty men
[1:22:34] and uh one twenty two so the chief
[1:22:37] captain then let the young man depart
[1:22:39] and he said see that you tell no man
[1:22:42] uh
[1:22:43] or show them these things
[1:22:45] so in verse 23
[1:22:48] um we have another you know they got to
[1:22:50] do something because they're after paul
[1:22:52] so verse 23 they prepare 200 foot
[1:22:55] soldiers okay
[1:22:57] 70 soldiers on horse and 200 armed with
[1:23:01] spears on foot
[1:23:02] it's 470
[1:23:04] tough guys in uniform with their stuff
[1:23:08] to protect one prophet
[1:23:10] it's right there verse 23.
[1:23:12] they put paul on a horse also
[1:23:15] and they're going to take him to
[1:23:16] governor felix down in caesarea now
[1:23:20] paul got off the boat in caesarea and
[1:23:22] went up to jerusalem now there's trouble
[1:23:24] they're going to send him back
[1:23:25] now today you can do that in about less
[1:23:28] than an hour because he's got a
[1:23:29] four-lane highway
[1:23:30] and even have a train
[1:23:31] but back then it took a while over the
[1:23:34] mountains and so forth
[1:23:36] and so they took off in the dark
[1:23:39] you can read it carefully
[1:23:40] all 470 slowly
[1:23:43] to a place about 40 miles from jerusalem
[1:23:45] to rest
[1:23:46] the next day
[1:23:49] 400 returned to headquarters
[1:23:51] and the 70 on horseback continued with
[1:23:53] paul over to caesarea
[1:23:56] and so now they got him down there not
[1:23:58] exactly in jail but in confinement with
[1:24:00] pleasant surroundings okay
[1:24:03] and uh you know paul didn't put no clock
[1:24:06] up here so who knows what time it is
[1:24:08] uh 11 52.
[1:24:10] okay uh you're not sorry
[1:24:14] yeah we're going to go in one more
[1:24:15] chapter
[1:24:17] food's not done yet
[1:24:18] so 24 verse 1
[1:24:20] and after five days ananias the high
[1:24:22] priest descended with the elders and
[1:24:25] with
[1:24:26] certain
[1:24:27] orca that means a lawyer
[1:24:28] named tertullus
[1:24:30] who informed the governor against paul
[1:24:33] so five days after he arrived here comes
[1:24:35] the high priest his entourage all these
[1:24:37] guys and their lawyer tortulas
[1:24:40] and in verse two
[1:24:42] he flatters the governor with great
[1:24:43] words we have enjoyed great peace and
[1:24:45] prosperity due to your wonderful
[1:24:47] planning we're so thankful
[1:24:49] but we have a little situation sir
[1:24:52] this man
[1:24:54] and so they invented some accusations
[1:24:56] that amounted to name calling he
[1:24:58] profaned our temple the governor could
[1:25:01] care less about the religious problems
[1:25:04] and so we grabbed him
[1:25:05] and uh we were going to judge him
[1:25:07] according to our law
[1:25:09] yeah beat him to death
[1:25:11] but your man the commander took him from
[1:25:13] us under great violence simply rescued
[1:25:15] him the ordinal violence involved
[1:25:18] and so um
[1:25:19] so he thought it best that you yourself
[1:25:21] should judge the case
[1:25:23] and all the jews said yeah amen yeah
[1:25:25] right mr chartreulis we all agree
[1:25:27] so here we have paul on trial for his
[1:25:30] faith
[1:25:31] standing before an angry arrogant
[1:25:33] religious high council
[1:25:35] the roman governor in caesarea
[1:25:37] in the years about 57 a.d so governor
[1:25:40] felix gives paul the nod
[1:25:43] to say his peace
[1:25:44] 24
[1:25:46] 10.
[1:25:47] then paul after the governor had
[1:25:49] beckoned him to speak
[1:25:51] answered for as much as i know that thou
[1:25:54] hast been of many years a judge unto
[1:25:57] this nation
[1:25:59] i do the more cheerfully answer for
[1:26:00] myself in other words you understand the
[1:26:02] whole thing about the jews so i'll speak
[1:26:04] for myself okay verse 11
[1:26:07] because that
[1:26:08] thou mayest understand that there are
[1:26:11] yet but 12 days since i went up to
[1:26:13] jerusalem to worship
[1:26:15] and they neither found me in the temple
[1:26:16] disputing with any man neither raising
[1:26:19] up the people neither in the synagogue
[1:26:21] nor in the city
[1:26:22] neither can they prove the things that
[1:26:24] they now accuse me of
[1:26:27] but this i confess unto thee he's
[1:26:29] talking to the main man
[1:26:31] after the way which they call heresy
[1:26:34] i worship the god of my fathers
[1:26:37] believing all things not just the gods
[1:26:39] and elijah not just not believing all
[1:26:42] things
[1:26:43] that are written in the law and the
[1:26:45] prophets in other words we believe all
[1:26:47] the words amen
[1:26:49] okay and um have hope towards god
[1:26:53] which
[1:26:54] they themselves also allow that there
[1:26:56] shall be a resurrection of the dead both
[1:26:58] of the just and unjust
[1:27:00] and herein do i exercise myself to have
[1:27:04] always a conscience void of offense
[1:27:06] towards god and towards men
[1:27:08] now after many years i came to bring
[1:27:10] alms to my nation and offerings you know
[1:27:13] i came in peace
[1:27:14] whereupon certain jews from asia found
[1:27:17] me purified in the temple neither with
[1:27:19] multitude nor was tumult no no problem
[1:27:22] who ought to have been here themselves
[1:27:25] before thee to object if they had ought
[1:27:28] against me
[1:27:31] or else
[1:27:32] let these same here say if they have
[1:27:35] found any evil doing in me while i stood
[1:27:37] before the council
[1:27:40] except it be that of this except it be
[1:27:43] for this one voice that i cried standing
[1:27:46] among them
[1:27:47] touch touching the resurrection of the
[1:27:49] dead i am called in question by you this
[1:27:52] day if that's the problem
[1:27:54] yeah but all this other stuff it's crazy
[1:27:56] so the governor wasn't so interested in
[1:27:58] the fine points of the religious laws of
[1:28:00] the jews he was simply protecting god's
[1:28:03] man of the hour from death at the hands
[1:28:06] of the most religious people on the
[1:28:07] planet
[1:28:09] the sadducees and the pharisees
[1:28:12] they knew it all they had the pedigree
[1:28:14] and they had the attitude to prove it
[1:28:18] you know john the baptist
[1:28:21] said generation of snakes generation
[1:28:24] snakes in the grass
[1:28:25] dangerously moving amongst the crowd
[1:28:27] jesus said blind leaders of the blind
[1:28:29] and many other things matthew 23 now
[1:28:32] paul on trial for his beliefs
[1:28:34] in 24 14
[1:28:37] uh we just read all that yeah
[1:28:40] so
[1:28:40] um
[1:28:42] here's governor felix having you know
[1:28:45] somewhat understanding of the way of
[1:28:46] christ more than a lot of people
[1:28:48] he granted an injunction
[1:28:51] he said when the chief priest chief of
[1:28:52] police comes down we'll review the case
[1:28:55] have a nice day everybody go home
[1:28:58] yeah verse 23 he commanded the centurion
[1:29:00] to keep paul and let him have liberty
[1:29:02] and that he should forbid none of his
[1:29:04] acquaintances to minister or come to him
[1:29:07] so
[1:29:08] he's kind of in minimum security you
[1:29:10] know
[1:29:12] and a few days later governor felix and
[1:29:14] his wife drusilla invited paul over for
[1:29:16] lunch
[1:29:17] he's over there in somewhat of a prison
[1:29:19] like invite him over for lunch
[1:29:21] asked him more about the christian faith
[1:29:24] and paul didn't hold back you asked
[1:29:27] he expound to them regarding
[1:29:29] righteousness
[1:29:30] holiness judgment that is coming and
[1:29:32] there was such an anointing present that
[1:29:35] the governor was fearful and trembled
[1:29:37] and he was moved by the power of god
[1:29:39] through the words of a gospel preacher
[1:29:44] but he put it off
[1:29:46] just like a lot of people today sitting
[1:29:47] right here probably
[1:29:50] you can go now
[1:29:51] i'll call for you when it's more
[1:29:53] convenient
[1:29:54] i've got a lot to do today
[1:29:56] in other words i have priorities
[1:29:59] i run into that every day with people
[1:30:01] well yeah but i've got to do this good
[1:30:03] well what about the gospel what about
[1:30:06] feeding the hungry what about some of
[1:30:07] these things that are you know people
[1:30:08] falling off the earth we can help well
[1:30:10] when it's more convenient
[1:30:13] friends there's no more convenient time
[1:30:15] than right now
[1:30:17] you're sitting under the power of the
[1:30:18] gospel you get with the program
[1:30:21] you have no guarantee of making it out
[1:30:23] to your nice car
[1:30:25] now you see this level's got more than
[1:30:27] one purpose it's here to remind me to
[1:30:29] stay level
[1:30:30] and to remind you
[1:30:32] when i see anybody drifting off
[1:30:36] see it sometimes works
[1:30:38] some people stayed up too late last
[1:30:40] night so
[1:30:43] so when god is calling and pressing you
[1:30:45] for
[1:30:46] an answer
[1:30:48] now is the proper time
[1:30:51] now a long time ago the year 1955
[1:30:55] the uh people of hollywood produced the
[1:30:57] ten commandments
[1:30:59] i'm sure
[1:31:00] most of you have seen him so some people
[1:31:03] at the tabernacle in jervis will snuck
[1:31:04] off to new albany and saw the ten
[1:31:06] commandments
[1:31:07] now the theater was about the size of
[1:31:09] this church they didn't have big things
[1:31:11] like we have today small screen anyway
[1:31:14] so
[1:31:15] they come back and oh brother graham
[1:31:16] you've got to see that man ten
[1:31:17] commandments is great so he takes
[1:31:19] uh himself his wife and rebecca and they
[1:31:22] go to see the ten commandments that's
[1:31:24] rebecca's nine years old at the time
[1:31:26] and so boy they're sitting there you
[1:31:28] know and they're watching ten
[1:31:29] commandments and so they they were under
[1:31:32] such a um a powerful anointing when they
[1:31:34] made that film
[1:31:36] that when they they designed the pill or
[1:31:37] fire brother brandon thought it was the
[1:31:38] real thing coming on the screen well he
[1:31:40] jumps up and takes his hat off oh it's
[1:31:42] just a film okay so he sits down
[1:31:44] but then on the way home after the
[1:31:46] four-hour film
[1:31:47] uh nine-year-old rebecca being very
[1:31:49] sensitive
[1:31:50] was the crying
[1:31:51] well honey what's the matter you know
[1:31:52] did you see this film yeah but dad of
[1:31:55] course to her was more like a newsreel
[1:31:57] you know
[1:31:58] and she um
[1:32:00] she said now over there when when moses
[1:32:02] was was
[1:32:03] uh
[1:32:04] telling people all that's on the lord's
[1:32:06] side come with me well with those words
[1:32:07] we're watching the ones come with him
[1:32:09] but she was a little bit ahead of the
[1:32:11] program she's watching those that
[1:32:12] stayed behind
[1:32:15] and she said god wasn't just hey those
[1:32:17] people were thinking about it they were
[1:32:18] trying so he stops the car
[1:32:21] well i guess we'll make this a teaching
[1:32:22] moment now when god shows you to do
[1:32:24] something you do it now
[1:32:27] now when you feel right now one grandma
[1:32:29] says it's okay and all that no you move
[1:32:31] now you see
[1:32:33] you might not get a second chance
[1:32:36] so in our story here the governor sent
[1:32:37] from paul on a regular basis they had
[1:32:39] lunch you know twice a week probably
[1:32:41] and they had a limited fellowship
[1:32:43] but we never read about the governor
[1:32:45] actually accepting christ or being
[1:32:47] baptized he just liked to talk about it
[1:32:50] we got people like that today i like to
[1:32:52] talk about it and debate those details
[1:32:55] each meeting he was really hoping for
[1:32:57] what to get closer to god to learn more
[1:33:00] no he wanted some cash
[1:33:03] just like today
[1:33:05] just follow the money trail you see
[1:33:07] it's right there verse 26
[1:33:10] he hoped also that money should have
[1:33:11] been given to him of paul that he might
[1:33:14] loose him wherefore he sent for him the
[1:33:16] more often
[1:33:18] and communed with him hoping that paul
[1:33:20] would you know catch the vision hand
[1:33:22] over a hundred dollars
[1:33:26] so this went on for two years from 57
[1:33:29] to 59 a.d
[1:33:32] so then the governor's term ended and
[1:33:34] another one took his place but felix
[1:33:37] being a politician left paul
[1:33:39] in prison
[1:33:41] in order to please the jews and make
[1:33:42] himself look good
[1:33:45] and uh with some people it's all about
[1:33:46] appearance yeah oh yeah we to look good
[1:33:49] to the public you know
[1:33:51] very little substance but god demands a
[1:33:54] correct order of priorities
[1:33:57] and with the believers jesus christ is
[1:33:59] always first place
[1:34:01] anything that comes between you
[1:34:03] and god is an idol
[1:34:06] you see
[1:34:07] so we have an entire study on idols and
[1:34:09] idolatry so forth
[1:34:11] but that is going to finish our study
[1:34:13] for today
[1:34:14] and we're going to give you a break
[1:34:16] because we've got a few chapters left
[1:34:18] and maybe i'll come back sometime soon
[1:34:20] and finish it up but in the meantime
[1:34:23] read your bible
[1:34:25] go see if all these things be true let's
[1:34:27] stand together
