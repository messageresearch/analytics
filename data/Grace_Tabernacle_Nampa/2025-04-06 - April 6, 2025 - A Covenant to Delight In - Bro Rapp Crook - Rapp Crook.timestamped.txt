[16:58] Amen. Amen. I have actually had a quote
[17:02] I wanted to read this morning that I
[17:05] read yesterday morning before we sing
[17:08] this next
[17:09] [Music]
[17:13] song. Amen. the brand's talking
[17:16] about or uh sorry in the patmas vision
[17:19] here he says amen cut every obstacle
[17:20] from human beings that they might be
[17:23] connected like in the garden of Eden now
[17:25] man I was going to choke it but I'm
[17:27] going to say it man is omnipotent you
[17:30] don't believe that but he is a man fully
[17:32] surrendered to God is
[17:36] omnipotent did he not say in Mark 11:22
[17:39] whatsoever things you say and don't
[17:41] doubt in your heart it'll come to pass
[17:43] you can have what you've said. Amen.
[17:47] Goes on to say, "What happens when two
[17:49] omnipotents meet? When God and man comes
[17:52] together, two omnipotents, something's
[17:55] got to shake." Amen. Something's got to
[17:58] shake. Praise God. Amen. Some whatsoever
[18:02] you'd say with that creative power of
[18:04] omnipotence of God, knowing that he's
[18:06] promised it, and he said it in his word,
[18:08] it creates a power that goes out yonder
[18:10] and brings things to pass. things that
[18:13] is not. It makes them as though they are
[18:15] because two omnipotents have met. There
[18:18] he stands. Oh, isn't he wonderful? Amen.
[18:22] Amen. I was just reading that and I
[18:24] thought, praise the Lord. That's you and
[18:27] I. When we are fully surrendered to him,
[18:30] something's got to shake. Praise the
[18:32] Lord. Amen. I'd like to stand and sing
[18:34] that is so sweet to trust in Jesus. We
[18:37] just got to stand on his word. Amen.

[42:33] Shai we will praise and lift you
[42:37] high. El should
[42:42] die. El should
[42:44] die. El
[42:47] Shai.
[42:49] L I don't I Huh.
[42:54] You're still the same by the power of
[43:00] the
[43:01] name El
[43:03] Shai
[43:06] El
[43:07] and I
[43:11] don't we will praise you till we die.
[43:21] I will praise until I
[43:25] die.
[43:28] [Music]
[43:30] [Applause]
[43:35] Elai job if you want to come.
[44:06] [Music]
[44:09] They whisper and they look as I run near
[44:16] them. I walk slowly so that they have
[44:21] time to leave.
[44:24] I come daily to this well to draw its
[44:31] water. Each day my bucket
[44:35] heavier it
[44:39] seems. Today a man is sitting by the
[44:45] well side.
[44:47] Can't believe it when he asks me for a
[44:54] drink. And as I draw for him a cool sip
[44:59] of
[45:01] water, I see something in his eyes I've
[45:06] never
[45:08] seen. When he speaks to me, his voice is
[45:14] so gentle.
[45:16] When he smiles, my Lord feels lighter
[45:20] than
[45:23] before. When he tells me of my sins, his
[45:27] eyes see through
[45:30] me. I go
[45:32] running telling all I' met the Lord.
[45:38] There's a
[45:40] deep calling to my
[45:44] thirsting soul. And his waters quench
[45:48] this longing deep
[45:50] [Music]
[45:52] within. Why was so lonely when he called
[45:58] me
[45:59] out, drawing me up from a life of sin?
[46:07] I was lonely when he called me
[46:13] out, drawing me up from a life of sin.
[46:22] [Music]
[46:27] [Applause]
[46:41] appreciated those. Amen.
[46:45] Wonderful. Amen. Let's just uh let's
[46:47] change our position. Let's stand. I'd
[46:48] like to sing that song. Um Lord, I lift
[46:51] your name. Number 890.
[47:00] Amen. No matter how far we get from him,
[47:03] his love for us does not change.
[47:06] Hallelujah. Thankful for
[47:08] that. Lord, my heart can
[47:14] grow, so far away and
[47:20] cold. And yet for me your love is still
[47:26] the
[47:31] same. Oh Lord, I bend my
[47:37] knee in awe and fear of
[47:43] thee. My head bowed down in reverence to
[47:49] your name.
[47:54] Lord, I
[47:56] lift your
[48:00] name. Your
[48:03] holy
[48:06] name.
[48:10] Jehovah
[48:11] God. Elohim.
[48:18] You're the
[48:20] great I
[48:24] am the
[48:27] risen
[48:30] lamb. I
[48:35] come and king.
[48:44] Lord, my heart's
[48:48] desire to be filled with the spirit's
[48:54] fire. My purpose is to worship you
[49:01] alone.
[49:07] Open up my
[49:11] soul to worship and
[49:17] adore. Be a
[49:20] fragrance offered to your
[49:28] throne. Lord, I
[49:30] lift your
[49:34] name. Your
[49:37] holy
[49:40] name.
[49:43] Jehovah
[49:45] God.
[49:51] Elohim. You're the
[49:54] great I am.
[49:59] The
[49:59] [Music]
[50:01] risen
[50:04] lamb, my
[50:09] comforter and king. Sing it again.
[50:14] Hallelujah. Lord, I
[50:17] lift your name.
[50:22] your
[50:25] holy
[50:27] name.
[50:30] Jehovah
[50:32] God.
[50:38] Elohim. You're the
[50:41] great. I
[50:44] am the
[50:46] [Music]
[50:48] risen lamb.
[50:51] My
[50:55] comforter and
[51:00] king. Lord, I
[51:03] lift
[51:04] your
[51:07] name. Your
[51:10] holy
[51:13] name.
[51:16] Jehovah God.
[51:18] [Music]
[51:24] Elohim. You're the
[51:27] great I
[51:30] am the
[51:34] reason
[51:36] lamb. My
[51:42] comfort and
[51:44] king. One more time.
[51:48] Lord, I
[51:50] lift your
[51:54] name. Oh
[52:12] holy
[52:14] great I am.
[52:18] My
[52:21] risen
[52:23] lamb, my
[52:26] [Music]
[52:29] cover
[52:30] and
[52:34] king. Amen. Lord bless you all this
[52:37] morning. It's a real uh real honor for
[52:39] me to be here amongst you. Just be
[52:42] seated please for a few minutes. I
[52:44] remember the first time I ever was asked
[52:46] to preach. I was uh I was in Malawi in
[52:49] Africa and I was so nervous when I got
[52:51] asked to preach. I got up and everybody
[52:53] was standing and I was reading my text
[52:55] and I finished my text and 30 minutes
[52:57] later they were still standing because I
[53:00] forgot to tell everybody to sit down. So
[53:02] I just uh I really enjoyed uh our time
[53:06] yesterday at the at the banquet and the
[53:08] fellowship with uh with brother Paul and
[53:11] his wife. Lord, what a what a royal
[53:13] royal family they are.
[53:15] I uh was uh real happy to see brother
[53:19] brother Sergey Gdasa before service
[53:21] there. I just uh we go back a long way.
[53:25] I remember it would have been I think in
[53:28] 2008 I was invited to go in to preach
[53:31] for Detsk in Detsk Ukraine where uh
[53:34] where he was. Um, and I had this idea as
[53:38] this a cheapkate uh a single American to
[53:42] uh let's just fly into Kev and somebody
[53:46] I can just take a train or take a bus
[53:48] wherever and we'll just go the cheap way
[53:50] and get to Detsk and uh not realizing uh
[53:53] what that all entailed. The brothers in
[53:55] Denetsk did not leave me um alone in Kev
[53:59] thankfully, but they sent brother Sergey
[54:02] and it must have been at least eight or
[54:03] nine hour bus ride. But he picked me up
[54:06] at the airport and we went through the
[54:08] Kev subway system and got on the bus and
[54:10] a allnight bus ride to Netsk probably to
[54:14] save a couple
[54:16] hundred. And uh I told this testimony at
[54:19] home and one of the brothers told me my
[54:20] you got to get that out of you. And my
[54:22] dad would always warn me, rap, if you
[54:24] don't learn how to spend money better,
[54:27] God will give you a wife who
[54:29] does. And I can testify that God has
[54:33] done
[54:34] that. He really has. She's a uh she's a
[54:38] she's a treasure because it's good
[54:41] because the treasure is not in the bank
[54:42] anymore. It's in it's in her. No, she's
[54:44] a she's a she's a special girl. I
[54:47] shouldn't say that cuz she's not here,
[54:48] but uh she can't be here to defend
[54:50] herself. But no, my well
[54:54] um perhaps we can just uh just stand in
[54:57] the opening the book of Deuteronomy
[54:59] chapter 1. I also wanted to uh thank all
[55:03] of you who have prayed for uh uh my
[55:05] family in recent weeks and and days. And
[55:09] u my wife's been going through different
[55:10] nervous issues in the last year. I
[55:12] wasn't sure if I'd be able to come or
[55:13] not, but y'all just stepped in and and
[55:16] prayed. Brother Paul called and I think
[55:18] early January. Well, let's just see how
[55:19] things go. Let's contact each other
[55:21] again at the end of the month. And uh
[55:23] and that worked out fine. But then uh my
[55:25] goodness, on Thursday, I woke up and uh
[55:29] discovered around noon that my basement
[55:31] had flooded and we had like five or six
[55:33] five inches of water in the basement and
[55:35] I sat I said, "How am I going to leave
[55:37] tomorrow?" But God was good. We got
[55:39] everything pumped out and cleaned up. So
[55:41] thank you for your prayer support in
[55:42] this. So Deuteronomy chapter 1 and verse
[55:46] one. These be the words which Moses
[55:49] spake unto all Israel on this side
[55:53] Jordan in the wilderness in the plain
[55:56] over against the Red Sea between Pan and
[55:59] Tophel and Leed and Hazeroth and Dishab
[56:03] etc etc etc. These be the words which
[56:07] Moses spake. And this morning I just
[56:09] want to talk especially a little while
[56:10] about just who is Moses speaking to. I
[56:15] want to spend a little bit of time on
[56:16] that this morning. Let's
[56:18] pray. Heavenly Father, I thank you very
[56:20] much for the opportunity uh to come here
[56:23] to this wonderful little church here in
[56:26] Nampa, Idaho, Lord, and and meet the
[56:28] saints here in the here in the West.
[56:31] Father, I I've never been out here
[56:33] ministering before and it's just a just
[56:35] such a such a kinship I have, Lord. And
[56:38] I just pray, Father, that you would meet
[56:39] each one of us in a special way. However
[56:41] our journey has
[56:43] been up till today, Lord, I pray that
[56:45] you would meet us in a special way today
[56:48] that we might be inspired, Lord, and
[56:50] strengthened for the next steps in our
[56:52] journey with you, oh Lord. In Jesus name
[56:54] we pray. Amen. You may be seated.
[57:01] just who is Moses speaking to? Um, this
[57:06] book of Deuteronomy is uh is written
[57:09] after the Israelites make their 40-year
[57:12] journey through the wilderness. This is
[57:15] the this is the second time now that
[57:17] they've stood on the threshold of the
[57:20] promised land. The first time around um
[57:23] they were uh right here at Kadesh
[57:26] Barnea. They went right up here to Kesh
[57:28] Bernia and they sent 12 spies to spy out
[57:33] the land and 10 spies came back with a
[57:35] negative report which was unfortunately
[57:37] believed by the whole congregation and
[57:41] they were sent back into the wilderness
[57:43] and went round about this circle for 40
[57:46] long long years. And God was
[57:51] um God gave the people what they asked
[57:54] for because there in Numbers chapter 13,
[57:57] we'll read a little bit of that uh uh
[57:59] this morning. Um the people said, "We
[58:01] don't believe that God is going to take
[58:04] us into the promised land. We wish that
[58:06] God had actually killed us in the
[58:08] wilderness. We wish that he had let us
[58:10] die in Egypt. That's what we wish for."
[58:13] And God finally gave them their request,
[58:17] which I kind of take from that. If God
[58:19] says no when I ask him for something, I
[58:21] should just take the no because he
[58:23] finally gave them their request. And he
[58:25] said, "Everybody who is 20 years old and
[58:27] older is going to die in the
[58:30] wilderness." My
[58:32] So just who is Moses speaking
[58:35] to? 40 years ago, 40 years earlier, the
[58:39] 12 spies had given their report. 10
[58:42] spies gave a negative report. Only two,
[58:44] Caleb and Joshua believed the promises
[58:47] of God and said we can go
[58:50] forward. That
[58:52] means that when Deuteronomy is written,
[58:55] when Moses is speaking here, there would
[58:57] have been just two people there besides
[58:59] Moses who were above 60 years
[59:02] old because 60 minus the 40 years in the
[59:06] wilderness, you wouldn't they wouldn't
[59:09] have survived it. They would have been
[59:10] cut off. Just two people would have been
[59:13] in their 60s. That would have been Caleb
[59:16] and Joshua. So who is Moses speaking to?
[59:21] There would have been a number of people
[59:22] in their 50s that would have been older
[59:25] teenagers when Israel is at Kadesh
[59:28] Barnea. Might have been 15, 16, 17 when
[59:31] they're here. So add 40 to that. They
[59:34] would have been in their mid to late
[59:35] 50s. There would have been some people
[59:37] like that. So these folks, if they're in
[59:40] their 50s, they might have left Egypt,
[59:41] say at age 10, 11, 12, if you leave
[59:46] Egypt at age 10, you would remember the
[59:48] 10 plagues, right? You'd remember the
[59:51] Red Sea crossing. You'd remember Mount
[59:54] Si. You would have seen the cloud of God
[59:57] come down upon the mountain. You would
[59:59] have seen the the lightning. You would
[1:00:01] have heard the thunder. You would have
[1:00:02] heard the voice of
[1:00:04] God. Think back though, you adults. How
[1:00:07] how are our memories of when we were
[1:00:11] 10? They exist, but they're kind of
[1:00:14] fuzzy, right? So, these 50-year-olds,
[1:00:17] they could they would have probably
[1:00:19] remembered that night with their moms
[1:00:22] and dads when they as a family would
[1:00:24] have killed the the Passover lamb and
[1:00:26] they would have taken the blood and put
[1:00:28] it on the doorpost. They would have
[1:00:30] remembered that. They would have
[1:00:32] remembered the dread throughout Egypt as
[1:00:36] the death angel passed. They might have
[1:00:39] remembered a shriek in the night or a
[1:00:41] dog barking its last bark because that
[1:00:44] was an oldest dog in the house and the
[1:00:46] house didn't have the blood on the
[1:00:48] doorpost. They would have remembered
[1:00:49] those
[1:00:50] things. But you know what? Most of their
[1:00:53] memories would have been formed by the
[1:00:56] wilderness experience.
[1:00:59] Most of their connection with God would
[1:01:02] have been formed by the wilderness
[1:01:05] experience which was not a good
[1:01:08] experience. If people were in their 20s,
[1:01:11] 30s and 40s, these folks would have been
[1:01:13] born in the
[1:01:15] wilderness. And think about that. If you
[1:01:18] were born in the wilderness, that means
[1:01:20] that nobody there, 20 years old, 30
[1:01:23] years old, 40 years old, none of them
[1:01:25] had a personal memory of leaving Egypt.
[1:01:29] My mind, none of them remember the 10
[1:01:32] plagues. It would have been a story.
[1:01:34] None of them remember what it was like
[1:01:37] when the Red Sea opened up before them
[1:01:40] and they walked right over. The chariots
[1:01:43] behind them getting stuck as they look
[1:01:46] back and the waters come crashing back
[1:01:48] and then Miriam grabs her tambourine and
[1:01:50] talks about the horse and the rider are
[1:01:52] thrown into the sea. They didn't
[1:01:53] remember that.
[1:01:56] They didn't have any Mount Si experience
[1:01:59] where God comes down and makes his
[1:02:01] covenant with them. They would not have
[1:02:03] remembered
[1:02:04] that. Any knowledge they would have had
[1:02:07] about
[1:02:08] that would have
[1:02:10] been from their parents and grandparents
[1:02:14] who more than likely died in the
[1:02:17] wilderness. Their knowledge of God, most
[1:02:20] of the people there that Moses is
[1:02:22] talking to in Deuteronomy 1 would have
[1:02:24] been in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. any
[1:02:27] knowledge of Jehovah they had would have
[1:02:29] been very colored by their
[1:02:33] backsliden parents and grandparents.
[1:02:39] Anything that they know would have been
[1:02:42] told by these folks who didn't value God
[1:02:45] anymore, didn't value his promises
[1:02:48] anymore, they would have told been
[1:02:50] passed on by those people. And you
[1:02:53] think, how would this youngest group,
[1:02:55] these folks in their 20s, 30s, and 40s,
[1:02:57] how would they ever make it into the
[1:03:00] promised land? Because the enemy seems
[1:03:02] to hold all the cards. Talk about people
[1:03:05] who are on the threshold of going in to
[1:03:08] the promised land. And all they've got,
[1:03:10] it seems like, are spiritual traumas.
[1:03:14] They remember when one man disagreed
[1:03:17] with Moses, chor. They remember when the
[1:03:20] earth swallowed them up. They remember
[1:03:22] when their friends left him because they
[1:03:25] didn't believe it anymore. They
[1:03:26] remembered this, that, they remembered
[1:03:28] all those things. They remembered that.
[1:03:30] They had personal memories of that, but
[1:03:32] they had no personal memories of Mount
[1:03:35] Si, the 10 plagues, and the Exodus. So,
[1:03:39] you would think, considering all these
[1:03:41] people that Moses is speaking to with
[1:03:43] all of their
[1:03:45] baggage, how will they ever make it into
[1:03:48] the promised land? the deck really does
[1:03:50] seem stacked against them. Their
[1:03:52] potential seems really, really bad.
[1:03:54] They've got battle scars that can what
[1:03:56] you would think completely justify them
[1:03:59] thinking, how could we ever do
[1:04:01] this? And I just kind of was thinking
[1:04:04] about this and I thought, my what
[1:04:08] about our Gen X believers, our Gen Y
[1:04:12] believers, our Gen Z believers? Yeah,
[1:04:16] there it is. each one of us. I mean, our
[1:04:18] Gen Xers, I'm sure brother Paul and his
[1:04:21] generation, you can probably think back.
[1:04:25] There's probably enough bad memories
[1:04:27] associated with church to justify being
[1:04:30] soured on the whole thing. That's the
[1:04:32] truth. There probably are.
[1:04:35] Gen X, this is my generation, just
[1:04:37] barely. I'm born in 1981, but my wife
[1:04:40] says, "Nah, you're really more of a you
[1:04:43] kind of act like the older one
[1:04:44] sometimes." No, but this this Gen Y
[1:04:47] generation, are there plenty of bad
[1:04:50] spiritual experiences that we've had?
[1:04:53] Just like people in the wilderness, we
[1:04:55] Genwireers probably remember divisions
[1:04:58] in church, splits in church,
[1:05:01] disagreements, and church shutting down
[1:05:04] or rumors going about this or that.
[1:05:06] There's plenty of that that might just
[1:05:08] kind of be in our baggage that kind of
[1:05:09] just could sour us and maybe has soured
[1:05:13] some of our friends on the whole
[1:05:14] experience. And yet, for some reason,
[1:05:15] we're still here. And we might not
[1:05:17] actually actually understand why we're
[1:05:19] still here, but there's something that's
[1:05:20] still that we're still here for some
[1:05:21] reason. Yes. How much longer? We don't
[1:05:23] know. But we think, how will I get
[1:05:26] further, Lord? And even Jenzers, these
[1:05:29] are
[1:05:30] folks, my my children. I've got a son
[1:05:33] who was born in 2011. He's a Gen Zer.
[1:05:36] There's plenty for our Jenzers to think
[1:05:38] about, my bad stuff's happened in uh in
[1:05:42] church. Bad stuff's happened in the
[1:05:44] message. Why do I even want to go
[1:05:46] forward in
[1:05:47] this? Just like we have this in our own
[1:05:50] memories. I think about it. Um you know,
[1:05:54] when I was growing up, I remember seeing
[1:05:55] a a book in our church library, 20th
[1:05:59] Century Prophet, and the title makes it
[1:06:02] sound really up to-date. But you know
[1:06:04] what? for my son who's a Gen Z or 20th
[1:06:07] century prophet. Sounds like a long time
[1:06:09] ago. This is the 21st century now. Dad,
[1:06:12] he asked me sometimes. I'm a teacher.
[1:06:14] He's in my class now at school. I might
[1:06:16] show a video in classroom time. Dad, can
[1:06:18] we please not watch something in black
[1:06:19] and white
[1:06:21] again? He wants something up to-date.
[1:06:23] And you know what? It does seem like
[1:06:26] 20th century prophet seems such a long
[1:06:28] time ago. And and our connection with
[1:06:29] that might seem more and more distant as
[1:06:31] time goes on. and my with all of our
[1:06:34] baggage, with all of our distance, our
[1:06:35] lack of connection, how will we make it
[1:06:38] into the promised land? The question is
[1:06:43] for us the same as it was for them. The
[1:06:46] difficulties that we might have, the
[1:06:48] complexes that we might carry because of
[1:06:50] our wilderness journey are the same
[1:06:53] kinds of complexes that they certainly
[1:06:55] would have carried in their wilderness
[1:06:58] journey. It seems almost a setup for
[1:07:01] failure.
[1:07:02] But you know what? God wants them to
[1:07:05] enter into their promising. He wants
[1:07:07] them to enter into their rest. And
[1:07:09] that's why he brings this book of
[1:07:11] Deuteronomy for all these fe folks in
[1:07:14] their 20s, 30s, and 40s who were not
[1:07:16] there for a personal mount si
[1:07:19] experience. This book of book of
[1:07:21] Deuteronomy is a second giving of the
[1:07:23] law. And God is saying with this, you
[1:07:26] who never had it, you didn't experience
[1:07:29] it, I will restore. Amen. That is why
[1:07:34] this book of Deuteronomy is here because
[1:07:35] it is written for all those people who
[1:07:38] in the wilderness experience never
[1:07:40] experienced personally what God had done
[1:07:43] for them. It had been colored time and
[1:07:45] again by grandpa who was bitter against
[1:07:47] his brother or my dad who was just so
[1:07:50] bitter against Moses for this or that or
[1:07:52] my uncle who did this or that. They're
[1:07:54] telling me, but I see what the how they
[1:07:56] live and I don't want what they have
[1:07:58] produces that in their life. I don't
[1:07:59] want that. For those folks who've had
[1:08:02] this kind of baggage, God says, I want
[1:08:05] you to have a personal experience with
[1:08:07] this. I'm going to restore. Amen. Turn
[1:08:10] over to chapter 5 in Deuteronomy.
[1:08:21] Moses calls all Israel and says unto
[1:08:24] them, "Here, O Israel." And again, who
[1:08:26] is he speaking to? It's those folks in
[1:08:28] their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, who made it
[1:08:31] through the wilderness, who who did not
[1:08:33] die there in the wilderness. Hear, O
[1:08:36] Israel, the statutes and judgments which
[1:08:39] I speak in your ear this day, that ye
[1:08:42] may learn them and keep and do them.
[1:08:47] The Lord our God made a covenant with us
[1:08:52] in
[1:08:53] Horeb. Now, if I were there listening to
[1:08:55] Moses and I hear him say, "The Lord our
[1:08:58] God made a covenant with us and Horeb."
[1:09:00] I'd be scratching my head because Moses,
[1:09:03] I was born after Horeb. Horeb was Mount
[1:09:06] Si. I was born after that. How could God
[1:09:08] have made a covenant with me there?
[1:09:10] Because I wasn't there,
[1:09:12] Moses. And Moses keeps on going. The
[1:09:14] Lord our God did not make this covenant
[1:09:17] with our fathers who died in the
[1:09:19] wilderness, but with us, right? Even us.
[1:09:24] Yes. Who are all of us here alive this
[1:09:27] day. Moses wants to drive this nail
[1:09:30] until it clenches. God made the covenant
[1:09:32] with you. You might not have been in any
[1:09:35] of the meetings. You might not have had
[1:09:37] any personal experience with brother
[1:09:39] Brandham or anything like that, but it
[1:09:40] doesn't matter because God is making a
[1:09:42] covenant with you. This message is sent
[1:09:44] for you, not just everybody who was
[1:09:47] there who saw the signs and the wonders.
[1:09:50] He's making the covenant with you. Moses
[1:09:53] is driving this. The Lord talked with
[1:09:55] you face to face in the mount out of the
[1:09:58] midst of fire. This is puzzling because
[1:10:00] I'm thinking, I wasn't there. But God's
[1:10:03] words are still echoing. They've been
[1:10:05] preserved here on paper. They've been
[1:10:07] preserved on tape. There are words for
[1:10:10] us because he is when he was speaking
[1:10:12] there, he was speaking for those folks
[1:10:14] who had not even been born yet who were
[1:10:17] going to enter into the promised land.
[1:10:19] And Moses just keeps going. I stood
[1:10:22] between the Lord and
[1:10:25] you weren't born yet, but I stood
[1:10:27] between the Lord and you at that time to
[1:10:30] show to you the word of the Lord. For
[1:10:34] you were afraid by reason of the fire
[1:10:36] did not go up into the mount,
[1:10:38] saying, I am the Lord thy God, which
[1:10:41] brought you out of the land of Egypt
[1:10:44] from the house of bondage. This book of
[1:10:46] Deuteronomy is here to tell everybody
[1:10:49] there who's in their 20s, 30s, 40s, even
[1:10:51] younger, who has no personal experience
[1:10:54] of Egypt, of the Red Sea, of Mount Si,
[1:10:59] that it's for them, too.
[1:11:01] God's word is for us today. And as he's
[1:11:06] going through this book of Deuteronomy,
[1:11:08] he wants to make sure the people
[1:11:09] understand the main point, right?
[1:11:13] Because in the wilderness experience, a
[1:11:15] lot of stuff kind of got fuzzy, got out
[1:11:19] of focus, got lost. It all became about
[1:11:23] this person's rules, this person's laws.
[1:11:26] You got to do this, you got to do that.
[1:11:28] And God says, "All that came out in the
[1:11:30] wilderness experience. You made it
[1:11:32] through the wilderness. That's great.
[1:11:33] But I wanted you to get to the heart of
[1:11:35] the matter." And you start speaking
[1:11:36] about this in Deuteronomy chapter 10.
[1:11:40] And let's take a look at Deuteronomy 10
[1:11:42] and verse 12.
[1:11:49] And he's speaking to people who have
[1:11:52] probably heard, they might have heard
[1:11:54] the law from their moms and dads,
[1:11:56] grandparents and grandparents who had
[1:11:59] their own baggage, their own problems
[1:12:01] with Moses. So it would have been
[1:12:02] colored, it would have been twisted in
[1:12:04] certain ways. And God wants to bring it
[1:12:05] back to the real true honest
[1:12:08] interpretation of what it really means.
[1:12:11] And that's important today. And now
[1:12:13] Israel, what do the Lord require of
[1:12:16] thee? but to fear the Lord thy God, to
[1:12:20] walk in his ways, to love him, to serve
[1:12:23] the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
[1:12:25] with all thy soul, to keep the
[1:12:28] commandments of the Lord and his
[1:12:30] statutes which I command thee this day
[1:12:33] for thy
[1:12:35] good. God wants to bring him to the main
[1:12:38] point. And what is the first thing he
[1:12:40] names? The main point, the law is here.
[1:12:44] The covenant I made with you on Mount
[1:12:46] Si. The first thing I want you to get
[1:12:48] out of this is here so you can fear the
[1:12:52] Lord. This isn't like an scared kind of
[1:12:55] fear. This is you have a relationship.
[1:12:58] You have this reverence for the person.
[1:13:00] You know them. That is why God came down
[1:13:05] at Mount Si to reveal himself to his
[1:13:09] people. And that is what has probably
[1:13:11] gotten lost in the wilderness. It wasn't
[1:13:13] about knowing God. It was about some
[1:13:15] other
[1:13:17] stuff. You fear God, walk in his ways,
[1:13:21] you walk with him, you know him, you
[1:13:23] have a relationship with him, you love
[1:13:25] him, you serve him with all your heart
[1:13:28] and with all thy
[1:13:30] soul. The last thing that's
[1:13:33] mentioned is keeping the commandments of
[1:13:36] the Lord.
[1:13:38] And in the wilderness journey, this has
[1:13:41] probably gotten
[1:13:42] reversed. It's all about keeping the
[1:13:45] commandment. Just do what he says. Just
[1:13:46] do what I say, kid. Just do what I say
[1:13:48] because I'm the dad. Just do it. And
[1:13:50] what had been missed was knowing God
[1:13:53] well enough to actually fear him. To
[1:13:56] walk not just according to the letter of
[1:13:58] the law, but to walk in his ways. To
[1:14:02] handle something as God would handle it.
[1:14:04] That had been missed. to actually love
[1:14:07] God, to serve him, not out of fear, but
[1:14:10] with all your heart with all thy soul.
[1:14:12] The wilderness journey had gotten all
[1:14:15] that mixed up and it might be mixed up
[1:14:17] in our minds some today. And that's why
[1:14:20] God is ministering the book of
[1:14:22] Deuteronomy. So there can be a second
[1:14:24] giving of the law bringing back to the
[1:14:27] main point which is that this is a
[1:14:30] covenant to delight in. Behold, the
[1:14:32] heaven of heavens is the Lord's, and the
[1:14:34] earth also, all that therein is. Only
[1:14:36] the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to
[1:14:40] love them. And he chose their seed after
[1:14:44] them, even you above all people as it is
[1:14:47] this day. The main point is this is a
[1:14:50] covenant founded upon God's delight in
[1:14:54] you. Yes. This is a covenant that we can
[1:14:57] rejoice in, that we can delight in. And
[1:15:01] through the wilderness journey that each
[1:15:03] one of us goes through, there's no way
[1:15:04] to get to God without going through a
[1:15:06] wilderness. Right? We all want to avoid
[1:15:09] it. We can't. Yes, we all have a
[1:15:11] wilderness journey to go through. And in
[1:15:13] that wilderness journey, things will get
[1:15:15] twisted. The devil's going to try to
[1:15:17] spoil things for us. But God wants to
[1:15:20] bring us back to the main point. This
[1:15:22] all started because God delights in you
[1:15:25] before you ever did anything good or
[1:15:28] bad. God chose you. God loved you. And
[1:15:32] if God loved you before you could do
[1:15:34] anything good to deserve his love, can
[1:15:36] you do anything
[1:15:37] now to make him stop loving you? You
[1:15:40] can't. It's not established upon what we
[1:15:44] did. In verse 15, there's nothing the
[1:15:47] children of Israel have done. The Lord
[1:15:51] had delight in your fathers. He loved
[1:15:53] them first. He chose them first. And
[1:15:56] you're included in that. This is a
[1:15:58] covenant to delight in. And the purpose
[1:16:00] of the book of Deuteronomy is that God
[1:16:03] wants this generation entering the
[1:16:06] promised land to delight in him even as
[1:16:09] he delights in them. Yes. Right.
[1:16:13] Beautiful. Now, I compare this idea of
[1:16:16] delight a little bit like the air in
[1:16:20] your bicycle
[1:16:22] tires. Uh my wife is Dutch and we lived
[1:16:26] in the Netherlands for seven years and
[1:16:28] everybody in the Netherlands bikes
[1:16:30] everywhere. We were a onecar family and
[1:16:33] that was a beautiful thing. I was able
[1:16:35] to bike back and forth to work every
[1:16:38] single day. We still bike every now and
[1:16:40] then uh around uh around our
[1:16:42] neighborhood. And my wife is a big
[1:16:44] stickler that her her tires have to be
[1:16:46] pumped up all the way because she tells
[1:16:48] me if the tires aren't pumped up all the
[1:16:49] way, it makes me pedal harder. And
[1:16:52] that's right because when the tires
[1:16:53] aren't fully pumped, there's more
[1:16:55] friction and it takes a lot more work.
[1:16:58] Well, I can remember when I was uh
[1:17:00] living in the Netherlands, I had about a
[1:17:02] half hour bike ride uh to work each day
[1:17:04] and uh we'd bike over the per. There'd
[1:17:07] be canals criss-crossing to the boulder.
[1:17:09] There'd be um cows mooing on the one
[1:17:12] side, goats bleeding on the next side.
[1:17:14] It was just a beautiful, beautiful
[1:17:16] morning. The spring morning, I was
[1:17:18] biking. It was just sunrise. It was just
[1:17:21] so so peaceful. I'm just biking away,
[1:17:23] biking. About halfway along the way, my
[1:17:26] bike just slows down. I'd run over a
[1:17:29] little shard of glass along the way and
[1:17:32] all of a sudden the moo the cows were
[1:17:35] still mooing, the goats were still
[1:17:36] bleeding, the sun was still shining, but
[1:17:38] I was not nearly as happy as I had just
[1:17:41] been because I would have to walk the
[1:17:44] rest of the way to work. I had just been
[1:17:48] delighting in my journey to work. But
[1:17:51] when the delight is
[1:17:54] gone, frustration and weariness grows
[1:17:58] and grows and grows. And I I did I felt
[1:18:01] like taking my bicycle and just throwing
[1:18:03] it into the canal and being so
[1:18:04] frustrated with it. But no, you just
[1:18:06] have to you walk your way to work and
[1:18:08] then you figure out a way to patch your
[1:18:10] bike tire and then you head back home at
[1:18:11] the end of the day. But when we don't
[1:18:14] delight in the Lord, it's like trying to
[1:18:16] go on your journey with a flat tire.
[1:18:19] Yeah, it's no fun at all. And if we are
[1:18:23] trying to have a walk with the Lord and
[1:18:25] it's all just rules and it's all just
[1:18:28] meeting other people's expectations. We
[1:18:30] see God as somebody who's all these
[1:18:33] expectations for us and he's going to be
[1:18:35] checking off all the things on the list
[1:18:36] that aren't quite right with us. we're
[1:18:38] not going to have a delight in him and
[1:18:40] it's going to be really really hard to
[1:18:42] pedal all the rest of the way because
[1:18:44] we're just going to feel like giving up
[1:18:45] and eventually we just we just
[1:18:48] might. It's important to delight in the
[1:18:51] Lord. And this is the experience the
[1:18:52] children of Israel had in the
[1:18:53] wilderness. It was like trying to bike a
[1:18:55] long way with empty bike tires. And God
[1:18:58] wants to show them as they're getting
[1:18:59] ready to enter the promised land, we
[1:19:02] need to delight in one another. And
[1:19:05] that's his purpose here. So, what I'd
[1:19:07] like to do this morning is spend some
[1:19:09] time um looking at the cycle that Israel
[1:19:13] has on this wilderness journey because
[1:19:15] the wilderness journey is something that
[1:19:17] we all might be in one or another fa
[1:19:19] we're all on a journey of some kind and
[1:19:21] it's important to see what are the the
[1:19:23] cycle that Israel went through on the
[1:19:25] wilderness journey because if we can
[1:19:26] identify that cycle and see some of it
[1:19:29] in our own lives or in our own thought
[1:19:30] patterns in our own families if we can
[1:19:32] identify it then with God's help maybe
[1:19:34] we can break the cycle.
[1:19:36] and get off of it because uh that's a
[1:19:39] real important thing because we don't
[1:19:40] want to do the same thing that we've
[1:19:42] been doing that hasn't been working. We
[1:19:44] want to do something
[1:19:45] different. So, we're going to try to
[1:19:48] identify this uh this cycle with the
[1:19:51] hope of breaking
[1:19:53] it. So, when I want to take a look at uh
[1:19:56] maybe we can turn over to the book of
[1:19:57] Numbers chapter 13 or actually we'll
[1:20:00] start at Numbers chapter 11.
[1:20:15] Numbers 13 is when the children of
[1:20:18] Israel are at Kadesh Barnea getting
[1:20:20] ready to enter the promised land perhaps
[1:20:23] for the first
[1:20:25] time. But um the setting for this really
[1:20:29] starts all the way back in Numbers 11,
[1:20:31] maybe even further. But we'll start
[1:20:33] here. Want to take a look what happens
[1:20:35] in our lives and in the children of
[1:20:37] Israel's lives when the Lord is not our
[1:20:41] delight. What we'll find out first here
[1:20:43] in Numbers 11 is that there is always
[1:20:46] more to complain about than to rejoice
[1:20:50] about. When the Lord's not our delight,
[1:20:53] there's always more to complain about
[1:20:54] than to rejoice about. And think about
[1:20:57] it. uh in numbers 11 they've God has
[1:21:00] brought Israel through the Red Sea. He's
[1:21:04] brought them through Mount Si. He's done
[1:21:08] so many things for them. Just months
[1:21:10] before they were under the under the uh
[1:21:13] under the bondage of Egypt and they
[1:21:16] forget that, right? How quickly we
[1:21:18] forget the victories of God. Just a few
[1:21:22] months before they were with Miriam with
[1:21:24] her tambourine dancing in the wilderness
[1:21:26] on the other side of the Red Sea saying,
[1:21:28] "The Lord has cast the horse and the
[1:21:29] rider in the sea. We're free. We're
[1:21:31] we're wonderful. God is our victor. He's
[1:21:33] our deliverer." And how quickly we
[1:21:35] forget.
[1:21:36] But when the Lord's not our delight,
[1:21:38] there's always more to complain about
[1:21:40] than to rejoice about. In Numbers
[1:21:43] 11 verse one, the people complained and
[1:21:46] it displeased the Lord and the Lord
[1:21:48] heard it. His anger was kindled and the
[1:21:51] fire of the Lord burnt among them and
[1:21:52] consumed them that were in the uttermost
[1:21:55] parts of the camp. I wonder if the
[1:21:57] people who were complaining did their
[1:21:58] complaining at the uttermost parts of
[1:22:00] the camp. They knew where they would
[1:22:02] gather. So only the people who wanted to
[1:22:03] complain together could be together in
[1:22:05] the uttermost parts of the camp. And the
[1:22:07] people cried to Moses and Moses prayed
[1:22:09] to the Lord and the fire was quenched
[1:22:11] and the place was called Dear. In verse
[1:22:13] four, the mixed multitude that was among
[1:22:15] them fell a little lusting and all the
[1:22:18] children of Israel wept against who will
[1:22:19] give us flesh to eat and God provided
[1:22:22] mana for them. But you know what numbers
[1:22:25] 11 what they're complaining about there
[1:22:28] that is setting the stage for how
[1:22:31] they're going to handle challenges that
[1:22:32] come in the future because attitude is
[1:22:35] contagious and habit forming. Help us,
[1:22:38] Lord. They might have been looking into
[1:22:40] the future. When God brings us to the
[1:22:42] promised land, then we'll be victors. We
[1:22:45] can't live in the future. We can't say,
[1:22:47] "Ah, when the rapture comes, I want to
[1:22:49] be serving God that day." Our only
[1:22:50] connection to the rapture is the present
[1:22:52] day. Our only way to serve God is in the
[1:22:55] now. Not put it off to someday in the
[1:22:57] future. Think how good it was some point
[1:22:59] in the past. God is in the now. And it's
[1:23:02] in the now that he wants to contact us.
[1:23:04] Attitude is contagious and habit
[1:23:06] forming. They might have been living in
[1:23:08] the future thinking things will be fine
[1:23:09] when we get to the promised end, but
[1:23:11] they weren't serving God in the now. And
[1:23:13] in the now is when they built habits
[1:23:16] that would affect how they responded to
[1:23:19] difficulties there in the
[1:23:22] future. And we also see that um when the
[1:23:26] Lord is not our delight, we are
[1:23:29] gradually preparing ourselves and others
[1:23:33] for spiritual defeat. Right? Because how
[1:23:36] the children of Israel responded to
[1:23:38] difficulties in Numbers 11 and in
[1:23:40] Numbers 12, it starts establishing a
[1:23:43] pattern for when they come up with
[1:23:44] difficulties in Numbers
[1:23:47] 13. Now in number, let's turn over to
[1:23:50] Numbers
[1:23:53] 13:1. The Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[1:23:57] "Send thou men that they may search the
[1:23:59] land of Canaan, which I give unto the
[1:24:01] children of Israel, of every tribe of
[1:24:03] their father. to show you sin to man,
[1:24:05] everyone a ruler among
[1:24:09] them. Numbers 13, they're right at the
[1:24:11] threshold of the prom. The prom is just
[1:24:14] over the next hill. Not the way that dad
[1:24:17] says on family vacation. Are we there
[1:24:18] yet? Yeah, just over the next hill. No,
[1:24:19] this is really it's really over the next
[1:24:21] hill. They're they're almost
[1:24:23] there. And how did they get
[1:24:27] there? What led the children of Israel
[1:24:30] from Egypt up to this point? How did
[1:24:33] they know how to get there? Every
[1:24:36] morning they'd get up and the pillar of
[1:24:39] cloud would move and that would be their
[1:24:42] cue. Let's move and let's go forward.
[1:24:44] And when the pillar of cloud stopped
[1:24:47] moving, they stopped moving. And perhaps
[1:24:49] at night they could look up and my kids
[1:24:53] still, my younger kids still get scared
[1:24:55] sometimes at night and they like to have
[1:24:56] a nightlight and maybe sometimes they're
[1:24:58] in the wilderness. It could be a little
[1:24:59] scary there, but kids could just open up
[1:25:02] the tent and look and see the pillar of
[1:25:04] fire there. This pulsing reminder that
[1:25:07] God was among them. And that was that's
[1:25:09] the best nightlight you could have. They
[1:25:11] had that. The next morning, the pillar
[1:25:12] of cloud moved again and they knew
[1:25:15] forward. So why is it they're right on
[1:25:19] the threshold of the promised land that
[1:25:21] they have this idea the pillar of fire
[1:25:25] has led us all the way, but you know
[1:25:26] what? Let's send 10 spy. Let's send 12
[1:25:28] spies to spy out the
[1:25:31] land. It's
[1:25:33] different. Where'd that idea come from?
[1:25:37] The way it's read here in Numbers, it
[1:25:39] sounds one way, but why was this even
[1:25:43] necessary? Keep your finger in Numbers
[1:25:45] 13 and go over to Deuteronomy chapter 1.
[1:25:51] And when Moses is telling the children
[1:25:53] of Israel here in the second giving of
[1:25:55] the law, he tells the same
[1:26:04] story and he's telling us how in verse
[1:26:07] 19 he's telling how we went through all
[1:26:09] the great wilderness after we left Horeb
[1:26:12] and we came to Kadesh Barnea. That's the
[1:26:14] end of verse 19. In verse 20, Moses
[1:26:17] says, "I said unto you, you are come
[1:26:19] unto the mount of the Amorite, which the
[1:26:21] Lord our God doth give unto us." Behold,
[1:26:25] the Lord thy God hath set the land
[1:26:28] before thee. Go up, possess it, as the
[1:26:31] Lord thy God of thy fathers hath said
[1:26:33] unto thee, fear not, neither be
[1:26:35] discouraged. That's what Moses says,
[1:26:36] right? Verse 22 gives a really important
[1:26:40] information. He says, "But you came near
[1:26:43] unto me, every one of you, and said, No,
[1:26:48] we'll send men out before us, and they
[1:26:52] will
[1:26:53] search out the land, and bring us word
[1:26:56] again by what way we must go up, and
[1:26:59] into what cities we shall come."
[1:27:02] Whose idea was this? Right? This is not
[1:27:05] the way God had worked with them for the
[1:27:07] entire wilderness journey.
[1:27:11] They had just been led by the pillar of
[1:27:13] fire, the pillar of cloud, and that was
[1:27:15] enough. That was more than enough. Why
[1:27:18] are they asking the question now? How do
[1:27:20] we go? How do we go? This is not this is
[1:27:22] they had never asked that question for
[1:27:23] the last months as they're going from
[1:27:25] Egypt to this point. Never came into
[1:27:27] their minds. They just followed the
[1:27:28] pillar of fire. And now they wake up and
[1:27:30] says, "Hey, we need to get a second
[1:27:33] opinion on this." Because when the Lord
[1:27:35] is not our delight, man's opinions
[1:27:38] outweigh God's promises. Right? God
[1:27:41] isn't their delight. And they before
[1:27:43] they take a step into this next uh in
[1:27:45] the next phase of the journey into the
[1:27:47] promises, ah let's send our princes out,
[1:27:50] prince from every tribe and let them do
[1:27:53] it. And
[1:27:55] Deuteronomy 123 says or two yeah 123
[1:27:59] says and the saying pleased me well.
[1:28:02] Moses said and he followed it. And I
[1:28:05] just wonder was Moses really happy about
[1:28:08] this. Or is this the kind of way you
[1:28:11] know moms and dads can probably identify
[1:28:13] with this if your son or daughter asks
[1:28:17] for something. Dad, may I please buy
[1:28:19] this game? May I please play this game?
[1:28:21] or may I please have some may I please
[1:28:23] go to so and so's house no I'd rather we
[1:28:26] not do that and they ask again and again
[1:28:29] and again and again you find yes yes you
[1:28:32] can have what you want just go and be
[1:28:34] quietly me you can do
[1:28:35] it I wonder if in that sense Moses says
[1:28:39] and your saying pleased me
[1:28:41] well because that's the experience Moses
[1:28:45] has had in numbers 11 and 12 he says
[1:28:48] complain complain complain and finally
[1:28:50] Moses says okay do what you want. Let's
[1:28:53] see how it works out. I wonder if it's
[1:28:55] in that sense Moses says the saying
[1:28:57] pleased me well because this is not
[1:28:59] according to how God had been working
[1:29:00] with them through the wilderness
[1:29:02] journey. But when the Lord's not our
[1:29:04] delight, God's word isn't good enough.
[1:29:07] Oh, man's opinions outweigh God's
[1:29:14] promises. So, they get the 12 spies.
[1:29:17] They send him out. and the 12 spies. We
[1:29:19] can flip back to Numbers chapter
[1:29:23] 13 and verse
[1:29:27] 17. Moses gets the uh the princes of
[1:29:30] each tribe and he sends them into spy on
[1:29:32] the land of Canaan. Says go this way
[1:29:34] southward this up to the mountain, see
[1:29:36] the land, etc., etc. And verse 20 gives
[1:29:39] an interesting uh
[1:29:41] detail. Says, "And be of good courage
[1:29:44] and bringeth the fruit of the land." And
[1:29:46] what time of year were they going out?
[1:29:47] says it was the time of the first stripe
[1:29:50] grapes. It's like God is setting them up
[1:29:53] at Kespernia to have the best possible
[1:29:56] impression of the land. They're not
[1:29:58] going in winter time when everything is
[1:30:01] barren. They're going when the grapes
[1:30:04] are on the vine. This is the time of
[1:30:07] year you get the best possible
[1:30:08] impression. So the spies, they go
[1:30:10] throughout the land and they tell the
[1:30:12] story and they go to this particular
[1:30:13] place. There these these these these
[1:30:16] grapes that are just huge at this place
[1:30:18] called Eshko. It takes two men to they
[1:30:20] chop off branch of these grapes and
[1:30:22] they're just carrying them back and
[1:30:24] these these grapes are huge. The
[1:30:26] impression you get is reading it.
[1:30:27] There's like these grapes in Canaan are
[1:30:28] like watermelons. They're just they're
[1:30:30] just amazing. But they're bringing back
[1:30:33] evidence of the land. And they and they
[1:30:35] come back carrying the melons, the
[1:30:38] grapes, whatever it is. They come back
[1:30:39] to Moses and everybody's waiting. What
[1:30:42] are the 12 spies going to tell us? What
[1:30:43] are they going to tell us? And they come
[1:30:45] and they lay these these grapes from
[1:30:48] Eshko. I mean, you can they're in the
[1:30:49] sun. They're this this reflecting the
[1:30:52] sun's light. People are gathering and
[1:30:54] say, "Wow, this is the this is from the
[1:30:56] promised land. This is the fruit of the
[1:30:59] land. People can come up. They can smell
[1:31:01] the grapes. They they can touch them.
[1:31:03] It's like the promised land is like it's
[1:31:05] right here in front of us. We can see
[1:31:07] what it's like. It's just an amazing
[1:31:09] thing. It's it's right there." And
[1:31:11] they've brought back evidence of how
[1:31:14] good the land was. And it wasn't just
[1:31:16] grapes. Verse 23 says they also back
[1:31:19] brought back pomegranates and and figs.
[1:31:22] They just lay it out before the people.
[1:31:24] This is a good
[1:31:26] land. Verse 25. And they returned from
[1:31:30] searching of the land after 40 days. And
[1:31:32] they show all the congregation there in
[1:31:34] verse 26 the fruit of the land. And in
[1:31:37] verse 27, they make their testimony. We
[1:31:40] came unto the land where you sent us,
[1:31:42] Moses, and surely it does flow with milk
[1:31:45] and honey, and this is the fruit of it.
[1:31:48] It's like, yes, hallelujah. Praise.
[1:31:50] Everybody's thrilled with it. And if
[1:31:52] they had stopped there, it would have
[1:31:54] been a completely different story.
[1:31:56] Right? But they go on and say,
[1:31:58] "Nevertheless,
[1:32:01] the people be strong that dwell in the
[1:32:05] land." Yes. And I just want to ask you,
[1:32:08] where were those people that dwell on
[1:32:10] the land? Those sons of Anoch, the
[1:32:12] giants, the grapes were right in the
[1:32:15] middle of the congregation. They were
[1:32:16] right here. The giants, they're way over
[1:32:19] there, way over there. But the more they
[1:32:22] start talking about the giants, the
[1:32:25] shadow of the giants falls upon the
[1:32:28] land. The grapes are still there. But
[1:32:30] the more they talk about the giants, how
[1:32:32] powerful they are, how strong they are.
[1:32:33] It's like the giants come right into the
[1:32:36] camp and they're standing and nobody
[1:32:38] sees the grapes that are right there.
[1:32:40] They see the giants that really aren't
[1:32:43] there. But in their imagination, their
[1:32:46] imagination is clouded out. The their
[1:32:49] imagination clouds out all the positive
[1:32:51] that is right there that's real. They
[1:32:52] could go up and grab a bite of that
[1:32:54] grape. The giants aren't there. They
[1:32:56] couldn't draw a sword and kill that
[1:32:58] because he's not there. But in their
[1:32:59] imagination, they're so freaked out by
[1:33:02] the giants that aren't
[1:33:04] there. Well, when the Lord's not our
[1:33:07] delight, we lose all sense of proportion
[1:33:10] as we view our
[1:33:13] trials. The giants weren't
[1:33:17] there. But when the Lord's not our
[1:33:20] delight, potential problems, and that
[1:33:22] word potential means it hasn't happened
[1:33:24] yet. Yeah.
[1:33:25] The things that haven't happened
[1:33:28] overshadow the things that are right in
[1:33:30] front of us. The grapes that are from
[1:33:31] the real promised land. Potential
[1:33:33] problems overshadow even the real
[1:33:36] fulfillment of God's promises. And they
[1:33:41] just keep talking about the Amalachites
[1:33:43] and these sons of Anoch. And in verse 32
[1:33:47] uh verse 31, the men say, "We are not
[1:33:50] able to go up against the people. They
[1:33:52] are stronger than we are." And they
[1:33:55] brought up an evil report of the land
[1:33:58] which which they had
[1:33:59] searched, saying, "The land through
[1:34:01] which we have gone to search it is a
[1:34:04] land that eateth up the inhabitants
[1:34:07] thereof." Their testimony almost gets
[1:34:10] absurdly negative. The land eats up the
[1:34:14] inhabitants. It's it's literary
[1:34:16] hyperbole. It's like you're going in
[1:34:17] there and the trees are going to start
[1:34:19] fighting against you. The land is going
[1:34:21] to eat us up.
[1:34:24] potential problems
[1:34:27] overweigh the fulfillment that is
[1:34:31] real. When the Lord's not our delight,
[1:34:34] our perception of the negative is in
[1:34:37] such exaggerated proportion that we can
[1:34:40] see nothing else except the negative.
[1:34:44] The risk is that our discernment becomes
[1:34:47] so faulty that we put aside the truth
[1:34:50] because we don't see it anymore and
[1:34:52] believe a lie. And that's the reason why
[1:34:55] when we're going through trials and hard
[1:34:57] times, that's not the time, that's not
[1:34:59] the ideal time to make big decisions in
[1:35:01] life because our discernment won't be
[1:35:04] real great. Think about the disciples
[1:35:06] when there's a storm on the Sea of
[1:35:08] Galilee. Did the disciples know what
[1:35:10] Jesus looked like? They certainly did.
[1:35:12] They could identify Jesus in the lineup
[1:35:14] really easily. But in the middle of the
[1:35:16] storm when Jesus is walking on the wall
[1:35:18] water toward them, they say it's a
[1:35:21] ghost. They knew Jesus well. But in the
[1:35:24] storms of life, our discernment become
[1:35:27] clouded and we don't see clearly. Right?
[1:35:29] That's good. We lose all sense of
[1:35:31] proportion in our trials.
[1:35:37] Furthermore, when we don't delight in
[1:35:38] the Lord, rumors take on the weight of
[1:35:42] truth.
[1:35:43] Look at verse 33.
[1:35:47] And the 10 spies are speaking again.
[1:35:49] There we saw the giants, da da da da,
[1:35:53] the sons of Anoch, which come of the
[1:35:55] giants, and we were in our own sight as
[1:35:59] grasshoppers, and so we were in their
[1:36:01] sight.
[1:36:03] They make two statements there at the
[1:36:04] end. Only one of them is true, right? We
[1:36:08] were in our own sight as grasshoppers.
[1:36:10] It sounds like that's probably true.
[1:36:12] They saw themselves as grasshoppers. But
[1:36:14] the next statement, they have no way of
[1:36:16] knowing. How did they know that the
[1:36:19] giants saw them as grasshoppers? Yeah,
[1:36:21] they say it. It's like we can read their
[1:36:23] minds. That's not true. How did the
[1:36:26] Canaanites actually view the children of
[1:36:28] Israel? Right. In the book of Joshua, we
[1:36:31] know how the Canaanites saw them. Rahab
[1:36:33] tells them, "We've heard of what your
[1:36:35] God has done. We heard how he parted the
[1:36:37] Red Sea. We heard all these things and
[1:36:39] we're shaking in fear." Right? That's
[1:36:43] the way it really was. But when the Lord
[1:36:45] is not our delight, we try to read other
[1:36:47] people's minds, right? And what we think
[1:36:50] they think is what we think is our
[1:36:52] reality. And we're operating in a
[1:36:54] completely false reality. Amen. How many
[1:36:58] of you have ever had an argument with
[1:36:59] somebody in your mind that causes your
[1:37:02] blood pressure just to rise rise rise?
[1:37:04] I've done that. When I was when I was in
[1:37:07] working at the particular office
[1:37:08] somewhere, I had a manager who is really
[1:37:11] difficult to work for and I'd be biking
[1:37:13] on my way to work. Stress just building
[1:37:16] in my mind thinking, okay, he's going to
[1:37:18] say this to me and I'm going to say this
[1:37:20] back to him and he's going to say this
[1:37:21] to me and I'm going to say this and I'm
[1:37:22] we're having this argument in my mind.
[1:37:24] I'm just building myself building myself
[1:37:25] up so much. I'm finally logged in at my
[1:37:28] desk and he walks in the door. I'm ready
[1:37:29] to launch into him. He just says, "Good
[1:37:31] morning." I say, "Good morning." I lost
[1:37:35] so much of my
[1:37:36] morning. Built up in stress about
[1:37:40] something. I was having an argument. My
[1:37:41] mind responding in anger to things had
[1:37:43] never even been said yet. And that's so
[1:37:46] easy to have
[1:37:48] happen. The Lord's not our delight. We
[1:37:51] rush to believe the negative instead of
[1:37:53] just resting that God will take care of
[1:37:55] us. Our discernment goes off the rails
[1:37:59] when the Lord is not our delight. Turn
[1:38:02] over to Numbers chapter 14.
[1:38:12] That
[1:38:14] night after the 10 spy after the 12
[1:38:17] spies had showed the the fruit of the
[1:38:19] land and they talked about all the
[1:38:21] giants. It was a rough night. Really
[1:38:23] rough night. Numbers 14
[1:38:26] says there were there was crying in
[1:38:29] every tent. Everybody was just really
[1:38:30] upset and babies weren't sleeping well
[1:38:32] because they felt the stress between
[1:38:34] moms and dads. And if babies don't sleep
[1:38:36] well, moms and dads don't sleep well. It
[1:38:38] gets worse. It's just this negative
[1:38:39] cycle. It just keeps getting worse and
[1:38:42] worse and
[1:38:44] worse. The next
[1:38:46] morning and their minds, they've worked
[1:38:48] themselves up. Things are getting worse
[1:38:50] and worse. They get up the next morning.
[1:38:51] Verse two, all the children of Israel
[1:38:54] murmured against Moses and against
[1:38:55] Aaron. And the whole congregation said
[1:38:57] unto them, "We wish we had just died in
[1:39:00] the land of Egypt, or that God would let
[1:39:03] us die in the
[1:39:04] wilderness. Why? Why hath the Lord
[1:39:07] brought us into this land to fall by the
[1:39:09] sword that our wives and children should
[1:39:12] be a prey? Were it not better for us to
[1:39:15] return to the land of
[1:39:19] Egypt? Israel perceives their deliverers
[1:39:22] to be their persecutor. God had
[1:39:24] delivered them from Egypt. And now
[1:39:27] Israel, they're not lighting. And God,
[1:39:29] they're turning the table say, "God, you
[1:39:31] have caused so much pain and suffering
[1:39:33] in our lives. God, why did you do this?
[1:39:35] I wish we would be back there in Egypt.
[1:39:37] I wish we'd never even called out for a
[1:39:39] deliverer. The devil is making them
[1:39:43] nostalgic for the past. And when we're
[1:39:45] going through tough times, my it was so
[1:39:48] good back there. So, I wish we could
[1:39:50] just go back to the 1950s. It was all so
[1:39:52] much better back then. We can be
[1:39:54] nostalgic for how it used to be. But
[1:39:57] nostalgia has very bad uh memory. Also,
[1:40:00] nostalgia is not accurate because you
[1:40:02] know what? The devil is making them
[1:40:03] nostalgic for a past that didn't exist.
[1:40:06] Right? They could desire to go back to
[1:40:08] Egypt. Egypt had been destroyed.
[1:40:11] They forget that what didn't exist
[1:40:14] anymore. And in the in the wilderness
[1:40:16] journey, what they remember about Egypt,
[1:40:18] you can read it in Numbers 11. They
[1:40:20] remember the leaks, the garlics. They
[1:40:22] said they had the the melons and the
[1:40:24] pomegranates. They don't
[1:40:26] remember the whip going across their
[1:40:28] back. how they had to save their sons
[1:40:31] because uh Pharaoh was trying to kill
[1:40:33] each of them. They don't remember any of
[1:40:34] those things. When we're going through a
[1:40:36] trial, we're nostalgic for the past. The
[1:40:38] past the devil makes us nostalgic for
[1:40:40] didn't exist the way it's presented. It
[1:40:43] doesn't exist now. Nostalgia is a dead
[1:40:46] end. God doesn't want us to go back to
[1:40:48] the past. He brought us to the present
[1:40:50] to serve him in the present, not in the
[1:40:53] past. It's the present. It's the only
[1:40:54] place in our lives that God is now. So
[1:40:57] don't think ah I wish I could serve him
[1:40:59] better back then. I wish I would serve
[1:41:00] him better in the future. No, now now is
[1:41:03] the only connection we have with God. We
[1:41:05] have no guar. We can't go back. We have
[1:41:07] no guarantee for tomorrow. God is in the
[1:41:10] now.
[1:41:15] But when the Lord is not our delight,
[1:41:17] you know what? In Numbers chapter 14,
[1:41:19] this is part we uh we told
[1:41:21] already. Um they they go back and forth.
[1:41:24] This is when God says, "Okay, I've had
[1:41:26] enough of it. You want to go? You want
[1:41:28] to uh you want to go back in the
[1:41:30] wilderness? Fine. You'll go back in the
[1:41:31] wilderness. You say that I can't bring
[1:41:33] anybody into the promised land. I will
[1:41:35] prove you wrong, but you will not see it
[1:41:37] with your eyes. Everyone 20 years old
[1:41:38] and under is going to die in the
[1:41:40] wilderness, and I will fulfill my
[1:41:43] promise faithfully to your children."
[1:41:46] That's what he says in Numbers chapter
[1:41:50] 14. And that day, the 10 spies die of a
[1:41:55] plague. They're gone. In verse
[1:41:59] 37, that's a very sobering moment.
[1:42:02] Everybody goes to bed and it's kind of
[1:42:04] like pins and needles. You could
[1:42:06] probably They probably don't sleep real
[1:42:08] well that night. And they wake up the
[1:42:10] next morning thinking, man, maybe we
[1:42:12] made a mistake
[1:42:14] yesterday. Maybe maybe we should go
[1:42:16] ahead and go into the promise. maybe we
[1:42:20] should. And then verse 40 talks about
[1:42:23] how the congregation has second thoughts
[1:42:27] and they decide to go up and try to
[1:42:29] possess the promised land in their own
[1:42:32] strength. But no, when the Lord's not
[1:42:33] our delight, we may talk like we're
[1:42:35] doing God's
[1:42:37] will, but we'll be doing it with our own
[1:42:39] agenda, and defeat is certain. Because
[1:42:42] they do try to go up and take the land
[1:42:44] the next day. Moses warns them, "Don't
[1:42:46] do it. That is not what God's calling us
[1:42:48] to do. But they're doing it in their own
[1:42:50] strength. This text says we they presume
[1:42:52] to go up. It's like they're saying,
[1:42:54] "Moses, you can say what you want, but
[1:42:56] we're still able to do it." They're not
[1:42:59] submitting themselves to the word of God
[1:43:01] or to the will of God. So, they're
[1:43:03] talking, "We're going to go possess the
[1:43:04] promised land." But they're doing says,
[1:43:06] "Moses, we can do it our way. We're
[1:43:08] going to do God's will our way." But
[1:43:10] when we do God's will our way, we're
[1:43:13] really just putting a holy whitewash
[1:43:16] onto our own will and defeat is certain.
[1:43:20] There are multiple times we see this.
[1:43:22] It's in the attack on Amcch that very
[1:43:24] day they go attack and they get
[1:43:27] routed, but they talked as though they
[1:43:30] were doing a holy thing. All they were
[1:43:32] trying to do was prove Moses wrong.
[1:43:34] Yeah. They were doing their will but
[1:43:37] whitewashing it with spiritual language.
[1:43:40] And that's kind of a pattern that you
[1:43:42] see in the wilderness journey. Um,
[1:43:47] couple chapters later, you have the
[1:43:48] rebellion of Kora, Dayan, and Abram. And
[1:43:51] Kora, Dayan, and Nyum, they want to say,
[1:43:54] they say, "Moses, why are you elevating
[1:43:57] yourself above everybody else?" So,
[1:43:59] first off, Moses didn't even want the
[1:44:01] job. God had to send him. God had to
[1:44:04] say, Moses, if you don't go, you're in
[1:44:05] trouble. Moses didn't elevate himself.
[1:44:08] God put him there. And then they say,
[1:44:10] "But Moses, God has made the entire
[1:44:12] congregation holy." And they're putting
[1:44:15] their own, this is their own political
[1:44:17] campaign, but they're putting it in
[1:44:18] language of holiness. The entire
[1:44:20] congregation is holy. Why are you
[1:44:21] elevating yourself of everybody else? We
[1:44:23] should be part of it, too. And we know
[1:44:25] how they ended up. They got um swallowed
[1:44:29] up there in the wilderness. The earth
[1:44:32] opened up and swallowed them up. But you
[1:44:34] know what? Take a look over in Numbers
[1:44:36] 26.
[1:44:37] This is just a really encouraging
[1:44:40] thing. Years ago in the in the school
[1:44:44] where I taught, um there was a couple
[1:44:47] situations going on in a couple of the
[1:44:49] families and it was it just broke my
[1:44:51] heart. Had a couple of couple of
[1:44:53] students just the sweetest students and
[1:44:56] the home situation was just
[1:44:58] horrendous. Like my goodness and these
[1:45:01] kids are trying to serve God the best
[1:45:03] they can. And it seems like with mom and
[1:45:05] dad doing whatever they want and still
[1:45:06] coming to church and raising their hands
[1:45:08] like the worst, as though they're
[1:45:09] serving God when they're not through the
[1:45:10] whole rest of the week. How do these
[1:45:12] kids stand a chance? And Numbers 26, I
[1:45:16] read it then and we think we all know
[1:45:19] the story of Kora Dayan in the Broom. I
[1:45:21] thought I did until I read it here in
[1:45:23] Numbers 26. Because we know that um um
[1:45:27] verse 10, the earth opened her mouth and
[1:45:30] swallowed them up together with Kora
[1:45:33] when that company died. When that what
[1:45:36] time the fire devoured 250 men, they
[1:45:38] became a sign. Kora was devoured. Dayton
[1:45:41] was devoured. Byron was devoured. But
[1:45:43] there was one group that was not
[1:45:44] devoured. Verse 11, notwithstanding, the
[1:45:48] children of Kora died not. I had always
[1:45:52] thought Kora Day by their whole families
[1:45:55] just got swallowed up. The children of
[1:45:57] Kora didn't, right? They made a choice
[1:46:01] that was different than the choice that
[1:46:02] their dad made. So dad was going one
[1:46:05] way, but they did not align themselves
[1:46:07] with dad. They aligned themselves with
[1:46:09] God. And God had honor for that. They
[1:46:12] were able to break the cycle. And for
[1:46:15] generations they would be known as the
[1:46:17] sons of Kora. That church spplitter, the
[1:46:20] sons of Kora, that man who just tried to
[1:46:23] lead Israel off the wrong way. They had
[1:46:25] that reproach attached to their name.
[1:46:27] They were the sons of Kora. But you know
[1:46:30] what? They kept serving God. And they
[1:46:32] served God despite the baggage of their
[1:46:36] family. And look at the Psalms that were
[1:46:38] written by them. The sons of Kora were
[1:46:40] some of David's best songwriters. This
[1:46:43] was the very same family who had risen
[1:46:47] up in protest against Moses. But the
[1:46:49] sons of Kora said, "No, we are not sons
[1:46:50] of Kora first. We are sons of God first.
[1:46:53] We are sons of Abraham first, and we're
[1:46:56] going to follow that leadership." And
[1:46:58] they did. And their testimony proved in
[1:47:01] the end greater than the reproach of
[1:47:03] their dad's name. They still wore their
[1:47:05] dad's name. We are sons of Kora, but we
[1:47:07] are serving the God of Abraham. They had
[1:47:09] a personal relationship with God that
[1:47:12] was much greater than the failings of
[1:47:14] their mom, failings of their dad.
[1:47:16] There's hope to break a cycle, be a son
[1:47:20] or daughter of
[1:47:23] Kora. So Kora talked like he was doing
[1:47:26] God's will, but he had his own
[1:47:29] agenda. What else happens in the
[1:47:31] wilderness journey? It's a disappointing
[1:47:33] time. There are failures of leadership
[1:47:36] at the highest level along the journey.
[1:47:39] Even Moses messed up in his anger.
[1:47:43] People kept complaining, complaining,
[1:47:45] complaining. And God told Moses, "Go
[1:47:46] speak to the rock." Well, Moses, he's
[1:47:49] not a good speaker. Speaking is not his
[1:47:52] strength. His strength is smiting. And
[1:47:55] he went out there and he didn't. He
[1:47:57] spoke to the people. He gave them a
[1:47:58] piece of his mind. He says, "You guys,
[1:48:00] you are a bunch of idiots. You are a
[1:48:02] pain to me." He just made him feel it.
[1:48:04] And then finally he just riled up at the
[1:48:06] pinnacle of his speech just says and God
[1:48:11] honored his prophet but his prophet sure
[1:48:14] messed up. Yeah, he
[1:48:17] did. Moses disobeyed God but made it
[1:48:20] sound spiritual the whole
[1:48:23] time. There was a leadership failure
[1:48:25] there in the wilderness. People uh had
[1:48:29] disappointed expectations along the way.
[1:48:32] Even as they get closer and closer to
[1:48:34] the promised land, God delivers them
[1:48:37] from the um from the king of Sihon and
[1:48:40] the king of Og. God delivers them. Yet
[1:48:44] even after victories in the promised
[1:48:46] land, the people still
[1:48:47] complain. Not even victories are good
[1:48:50] enough in the wilderness
[1:48:54] journey. It's like the victories aren't
[1:48:57] good enough. What they need? They need a
[1:48:59] vision in the wilderness journey. They
[1:49:00] need to be captivated by something more
[1:49:02] than just the daily grind. They need a a
[1:49:05] love for the truth. They need delight in
[1:49:07] the Lord because when victories, God is
[1:49:09] taking care of them along the way. Why
[1:49:11] do they keep messing up? And in this
[1:49:13] case, it almost seems like it's an
[1:49:15] example of the mystery of iniquity. Why
[1:49:18] do they keep failing in the same areas?
[1:49:21] It's because they don't have a love for
[1:49:24] the truth.
[1:49:26] If you get a love for the truth, that
[1:49:28] allows you to break that cycle. But as
[1:49:31] long as they're just going through the
[1:49:32] grind, even good things that happen
[1:49:34] along the way, they forget about it so
[1:49:36] easily and they complain the next day.
[1:49:38] You have to break the cycle with a love
[1:49:41] for the truth. Amen. And a delight in
[1:49:44] the Lord. Amen. And that's what I want
[1:49:47] to take a look at now in this next uh
[1:49:50] next section. We've taken a look at what
[1:49:51] happens. The Lord's not our delight.
[1:49:53] It's not a pretty picture. And all of us
[1:49:56] can take a look probably in our own
[1:49:57] lives, in the lives of our families and
[1:49:59] along our spiritual journey where the
[1:50:01] God hasn't been our delight. And it's
[1:50:03] been a real difficult road. We know what
[1:50:06] that's like. We've seen it in Numbers.
[1:50:07] We've seen it in our own journey. Let's
[1:50:09] take a look though at Psalm 37 to see
[1:50:13] what happens when the Lord is our
[1:50:16] delight.
[1:50:19] because we don't want to we we we don't
[1:50:21] want to go through the same scenario
[1:50:23] again and again and
[1:50:25] again. I want to break that cycle and
[1:50:28] key to doing
[1:50:29] that is delighting in the Lord. I just
[1:50:33] want to read the first seven verses of
[1:50:37] Psalm 37. As we read, I want you to pay
[1:50:39] special
[1:50:41] attention to the important verbs.
[1:50:53] Fret not thyself because of
[1:50:56] evildoers, neither be thou envious
[1:50:59] against the workers of iniquity. For
[1:51:00] they shall soon be cut down like the
[1:51:02] grass, and witherst the green
[1:51:04] herb. But trust in the Lord, and do
[1:51:07] good. So shalt thou dwell in the land,
[1:51:11] and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight
[1:51:14] thyself also in the Lord, and he shall
[1:51:17] give thee the desires of thine
[1:51:20] heart. Commit your way unto the Lord.
[1:51:23] The Hebrews, roll your way upon the
[1:51:25] Lord. Commit it to him. Trust also in
[1:51:28] him, and he shall bring it to pass, and
[1:51:30] he shall bring forth thy righteousness,
[1:51:33] as the light and thy judgment as the
[1:51:36] noon
[1:51:37] day. Rest in the Lord. Wait patiently
[1:51:41] for him. Fret not thyself because of him
[1:51:43] who prospers in his way because of the
[1:51:46] man who bringeth wicked devices to
[1:51:50] pass. These are important important
[1:51:53] verbs. The first one is going to be fret
[1:51:55] not. This is in verse one. Fret
[1:51:59] not. In verses one and two basically
[1:52:02] tell us to take our eyes off of people
[1:52:04] who are going the wrong way.
[1:52:07] Because I don't know if you've
[1:52:09] experienced before. I have. Sometimes
[1:52:10] you take a look at people who aren't
[1:52:12] doing anything to follow the Lord at
[1:52:14] all. And yet seems like they're the ones
[1:52:16] sure who win the lottery.
[1:52:19] They're the ones who got the promotion.
[1:52:21] They're the ones driving in a really
[1:52:23] nice car and I've got this old clunker
[1:52:26] that Yeah, it's fine. But I'm serving
[1:52:28] you, God. Why don't you give me the kind
[1:52:30] of stuff that they're getting? Well,
[1:52:32] serving God is about much more than
[1:52:33] getting good stuff from God. But take
[1:52:37] your eyes off of people who are going
[1:52:38] the wrong way. Fret not means don't heat
[1:52:41] yourself into
[1:52:42] vexation or become angry because it'll
[1:52:45] bring you to do what you'll regret. So
[1:52:48] don't
[1:52:50] fret. And we notice that worry can't
[1:52:54] grow in a heart that delights in the
[1:52:56] Lord. But fret not an important verb
[1:52:58] there. And then come across to trust.
[1:53:01] Trust in the Lord. Do good. The next
[1:53:05] verse, verse four, delight thyself also
[1:53:08] in the Lord. And then the next verse,
[1:53:10] commit thy way unto the Lord. And then
[1:53:13] again, you where you started trusting
[1:53:14] him, keep on trusting him. This is not
[1:53:16] just a one-time trust. It is a life of
[1:53:18] trust. And finally, when we've done all
[1:53:20] these things, we can just
[1:53:23] rest. And I taught this one time and
[1:53:26] somebody came and says, "Man, you missed
[1:53:27] one really important verb, brother Rap."
[1:53:29] So, I want to add this one. And that's
[1:53:33] do trust in the Lord. Verse three says,
[1:53:36] "And do good." It's easy to say, "I'm
[1:53:39] just going to trust in the Lord." Just
[1:53:41] going to trust in the Lord, and once I
[1:53:43] see that he's made a way, then I'll get
[1:53:45] up and do something.
[1:53:47] But you know what? God doesn't always
[1:53:49] make a way for us, make everything clear
[1:53:51] to us first. We can trust in him. And
[1:53:55] sometimes we then have to take a step.
[1:53:57] Yes. To take another step. Then we take
[1:54:00] another step. We want to have everything
[1:54:02] planned out ahead of time. But um
[1:54:05] Proverbs says, "The steps of the
[1:54:08] righteous are ordered of the Lord." It's
[1:54:10] really hard to to guide somebody who's
[1:54:12] unwilling to make a step. Yes, I'm going
[1:54:15] to stand still until I know exactly
[1:54:16] where God wants me to go. I'm just going
[1:54:17] to stand still. You can't You're just
[1:54:20] going to be pushing them down. But once
[1:54:21] you take a step, it's easy to guide
[1:54:23] someone. But you hear like fishing or
[1:54:24] boating. You got a a rudder on a boat,
[1:54:27] right? Yeah. And you just turn that
[1:54:29] rudder back and forth. If the boat's not
[1:54:30] moving, moving the rudder does
[1:54:32] absolutely no good. Right? Only after
[1:54:35] you're moving does moving the rudder do
[1:54:37] any good. You can't steer a ship that's
[1:54:39] stationary. So, as we're trusting God,
[1:54:42] we show our trust in him by doing the
[1:54:44] little things that he tells us to do.
[1:54:46] And then as we're trusting him, he
[1:54:48] guides us further. So, we can't be
[1:54:49] afraid to do or be unwilling to start
[1:54:51] doing until God shows us everything
[1:54:53] because that's not how God works.
[1:54:57] And sometimes we think, man, I'll serve
[1:54:59] God once I feel inspired to do it. Well,
[1:55:03] if we wait on inspiration, there
[1:55:05] wouldn't be very many meals cooked.
[1:55:07] Would there be housewives? Some things
[1:55:09] we just do. If I wait on inspiration,
[1:55:12] there will be very little projects done
[1:55:13] in my house. I hate doing projects. My
[1:55:16] wife makes the list. I put it off, put
[1:55:18] it off, put it off. And I hate doing
[1:55:20] them because I'm bad at them. But you
[1:55:21] know what? It's happened before where
[1:55:23] once I actually get started, it's not as
[1:55:25] bad as I thought and I don't admit it to
[1:55:27] my wife. It it really wasn't too bad.
[1:55:29] Looks kind of good now. Once we start
[1:55:32] doing something, often that is the point
[1:55:34] where God starts changing our desires
[1:55:37] and God this isn't too bad. But if we
[1:55:39] wait, I will do it once I have a a will
[1:55:41] to do it. Not much gets done. We trust
[1:55:44] God, we do, and then he starts anointing
[1:55:47] and working upon us. So doing is the
[1:55:50] greatest way to show trust and then
[1:55:52] enjoy the
[1:55:53] delight. So fret not. Worry cannot grow
[1:55:57] in a heart that delights in God. The
[1:56:00] worrisome anxious thoughts will come up.
[1:56:02] But because we delight in God, we weed
[1:56:04] those thoughts out daily. They'll come
[1:56:05] up every day. They'll always be things
[1:56:07] to worry us, to get us fright, to get us
[1:56:09] upset. But we delight in God. We weed
[1:56:11] those out. They don't stick around.
[1:56:15] Delight in God fosters, builds,
[1:56:18] strengthens trust and obedience in our
[1:56:21] journey as we're in this journey to our
[1:56:23] position in the body of Christ. And
[1:56:26] along the way, our heart, we're walking
[1:56:30] with God. And as we walk with God, we
[1:56:32] get to know him better. And our heart
[1:56:34] starts to beat with God's heart and its
[1:56:37] desires gradually become reality in our
[1:56:39] lives. This kind of goes back to that
[1:56:42] scripture in Deuteronomy 10. What was
[1:56:44] the main point? That we fear the Lord.
[1:56:47] That we walk in his ways. Because as we
[1:56:50] walk in his ways, our knowledge of God
[1:56:53] grows and grows and our heart gets
[1:56:56] changed more and more. And it's in
[1:56:58] delight that we really have rest as we
[1:57:02] wait on the Lord. It can be really hard
[1:57:05] to wait for things in life. But if I
[1:57:09] delight in the Lord, if I have a love
[1:57:10] for him, if I enjoy my time with him,
[1:57:13] I'm willing to enjoy my time with him
[1:57:15] while I'm waiting for him to do the
[1:57:17] thing that I've asked him to do. Delight
[1:57:19] helps us to wait on the Lord. So, I look
[1:57:24] at Psalm 37 as kind of um the theory of
[1:57:28] delight. This is how it theoretically
[1:57:30] can work. But you know what? It says in
[1:57:33] theory, there's no difference between
[1:57:34] theory and practice. But um in practice
[1:57:37] there is in theory you just go from A to
[1:57:40] B delight in God everything is fine and
[1:57:43] peachy but in practice it's a little
[1:57:45] more involved. So we look we've taken a
[1:57:48] look at the theory of delight but I want
[1:57:50] to go back to numbers 13. We've taken a
[1:57:53] look at the 10 spies. I want to take a
[1:57:55] look now at Caleb specifically to see
[1:57:57] somebody who's delighting in the Lord
[1:57:59] and what that looks like in real life.
[1:58:03] So, let's turn back to Numbers 13 just a
[1:58:22] moment. We want to remember that Caleb
[1:58:24] is one of those spies, too. He saw the
[1:58:28] same things the other 10 spies saw. Y
[1:58:32] yet something enabled him to draw very
[1:58:35] opposite conclusions.
[1:58:37] And that's what's important. Why could
[1:58:39] he see the same things but draw opposite
[1:58:42] conclusions? Well, we saw that when you
[1:58:44] don't delight in the Lord, you find more
[1:58:46] to complain about than to rejoice about.
[1:58:49] But when you do delight in the Lord, you
[1:58:51] dwell on the good things of the past.
[1:58:55] Caleb could go back and remember you're
[1:58:58] in Numbers 13, but I'm
[1:59:00] not. Caleb could go back and remember
[1:59:04] what God had done for them. Actually, go
[1:59:06] to Numbers
[1:59:10] 14 and verse
[1:59:14] 8, Caleb was able to go back. Caleb
[1:59:18] still had the main point. The main point
[1:59:20] was God delights in us. He chose us.
[1:59:22] Caleb remembers that verse 8 says, "If
[1:59:24] the Lord delight in us, he will bring us
[1:59:28] into this land and give it to us, a land
[1:59:30] which does flow with milk and honey."
[1:59:32] Look, we see the grapes right here. He's
[1:59:34] trying to bring their attention right
[1:59:35] back to that. Caleb, he hadn't lost the
[1:59:39] main point. Caleb could dwell on the
[1:59:41] good things of the past. And Caleb, he
[1:59:44] saw the same
[1:59:45] giants that they saw. But Caleb never
[1:59:49] saw a giant that was bigger than his
[1:59:51] God. Right? Caleb could put the word of
[1:59:55] God next to giants. He saw and all of a
[1:59:58] sudden the giants weren't nearly as big
[2:00:00] as God
[2:00:02] was. Caleb remembered what God had done
[2:00:04] in the past. He still knew the main
[2:00:06] point. The testimonies of what God has
[2:00:09] done remind us of what God still can do.
[2:00:13] That's an important thing. Delight in
[2:00:16] the Lord is not denial. Right? Caleb
[2:00:19] doesn't go out and say, "Ah, there are
[2:00:21] no there are no giants there in the
[2:00:23] land." That's not it. Faith isn't
[2:00:25] denial. I can say, "I've got a really
[2:00:28] bad headache today." And even if I've
[2:00:30] been prayed for, my I can still say my
[2:00:32] head my head's still hurting. I'm not
[2:00:35] denying that I'm I'm having a particular
[2:00:37] symptom, but you know what? I'm trusting
[2:00:39] in my God that's going to be greater
[2:00:41] than this. So, it's not like I've got to
[2:00:42] go through I think I'm I'm everything's
[2:00:44] going to be healthy and fine. No,
[2:00:45] delight is not denial. Delight does
[2:00:48] acknowledge that difficulties exist.
[2:00:50] Delight, well, I I can have aches and
[2:00:52] pains, but I can still have delight in
[2:00:54] God. Caleb was delighting in God. He
[2:00:57] wasn't denying that giants were there,
[2:00:59] but it kept delight keeps the giants in
[2:01:02] our lives in proper proportion by
[2:01:05] placing the giant next to the person of
[2:01:07] God and the promises of God. Right? So
[2:01:10] because of his delight in the Lord,
[2:01:12] Caleb could have realistic expectations
[2:01:15] of the promised land. He saw the giants,
[2:01:18] but he also saw a land flowing with milk
[2:01:20] and
[2:01:22] honey. Caleb saw no giants bigger than
[2:01:25] his God. Caleb believed what God said
[2:01:28] about him instead of what the people
[2:01:30] thought that the giants thought about
[2:01:33] them.
[2:01:34] Caleb's testimony is actually much more
[2:01:37] realistic than the 10 spies. The 10
[2:01:40] spies come out and say, "The land's
[2:01:41] going to devour us
[2:01:43] up." It's absurd. Caleb gives a positive
[2:01:47] testament is actually much more
[2:01:48] realistic than the negative testimony
[2:01:51] because it's founded upon reality. And
[2:01:54] the reality was God delights in us. When
[2:01:58] the Lord's our delight, we have power to
[2:02:00] be a lone voice of testimony even when
[2:02:03] everybody else sees the negative because
[2:02:05] we know that God is with
[2:02:07] us. And Caleb had that
[2:02:13] power. Now, this next one is uh is
[2:02:16] interesting. Turn over to Joshua chapter
[2:02:18] 5. When the Lord is our
[2:02:22] delight, we get past the politics of
[2:02:25] choosing sides. That's right. Politics
[2:02:29] got in the children of Israel's way
[2:02:31] repeatedly in the wilderness journey.
[2:02:33] Who's right? This person or that person,
[2:02:35] Moses or this brother? Who's right?
[2:02:37] Who's right? And in most of our
[2:02:39] wilderness journeys, there have been
[2:02:41] times along the way where competitions
[2:02:44] for power within the church, within the
[2:02:46] family, whatever, and there's politics
[2:02:50] tearing away. And that does great
[2:02:51] damage. When the Lord's our delight, we
[2:02:53] can get past the politics of choosing
[2:02:56] sides. Take a look at Joshua
[2:02:59] 5:es 13,4 and 15. And here Joshua is
[2:03:02] getting ready to lead the children of
[2:03:04] Israel across the land. He's gotten up
[2:03:06] early that morning. He goes, he verse
[2:03:08] 13. It came to pass when Joshua Joshua
[2:03:11] was by Jericho that he lifted up his
[2:03:14] eyes and looked and behold there stood a
[2:03:17] man over against him with his sword
[2:03:20] drawn in his hand. Right? And Joshua
[2:03:25] approaches this
[2:03:26] man. He's ready to draw his sword. And
[2:03:29] he asks,
[2:03:31] "Are you for us?" Yes. Or against us?
[2:03:34] Are you for us or for our adversaries?
[2:03:37] And this question is a very natural
[2:03:39] question because most of us think about,
[2:03:42] hey, you're either for me or against me.
[2:03:44] There's just two sides to take here. Jo,
[2:03:46] this is this is a a a pattern of thought
[2:03:48] that's part of the wilderness journey.
[2:03:49] It's part of our humanity. But Joshua is
[2:03:52] falling into a trap
[2:03:53] here. Because look how God answers the
[2:03:57] question. This is the angel of the Lord.
[2:04:00] Are you for us or for our adversaries?
[2:04:03] And the angel of the Lord says,
[2:04:06] "No, but as captain of the host of the
[2:04:09] Lord, am I now come?" The error in
[2:04:13] Joshua's question is revealed by the
[2:04:16] Lord's response. As captain of the host
[2:04:19] of the Lord, am I now come? God doesn't
[2:04:22] come to take sides. Right? He comes and
[2:04:26] the question is on us. Are you on God's
[2:04:29] side? God is the side. We try to
[2:04:32] trivialize and say, "I want to go I'm
[2:04:34] going to take this quote or this Bible
[2:04:35] verse. This shows that God's on my
[2:04:37] side." And somebody else says, "No,
[2:04:38] God's on my side. I've got this quote or
[2:04:39] this Bible verse." No, we just want God
[2:04:42] to come so we can line up behind him.
[2:04:44] Joshua had been through the wilderness
[2:04:46] journey and he'd been useless. Are you
[2:04:47] for us or against us? But God comes and
[2:04:49] Josh says, "Yes, sir. I am with you, the
[2:04:51] Lord." That's amen. When the Lord's our
[2:04:54] delight, we get past that politics of
[2:04:56] choosing sides. Amen. When the Lord is
[2:04:59] our delight, God sustains our strength
[2:05:01] and vision during the long period when
[2:05:03] we await the fulfillment of God's
[2:05:08] promise. Look at Joshua
[2:05:11] 14 and think about Caleb and Joshua for
[2:05:14] just a
[2:05:16] minute. Caleb and Joshua were two
[2:05:19] faithful servants of God. They went and
[2:05:21] spied out the land. They brought back a
[2:05:24] true report. They believed what God
[2:05:26] said. They did this probably at great
[2:05:28] personal cost to themselves. The other
[2:05:30] 10 spies looked at them as traitors
[2:05:32] being thrown under the bus. They didn't
[2:05:34] appreciate Caleb or Joshua at all. Caleb
[2:05:38] and Joshua did nothing wrong in Numbers
[2:05:40] 13. They did exactly what they should do
[2:05:43] as godly men or women. They do exactly
[2:05:46] what's right. And yet, they don't go
[2:05:49] into the promised land.
[2:05:51] They have to go back into the wilderness
[2:05:53] for 40 years like everybody else even
[2:05:57] though they did nothing wrong.
[2:06:01] There can be some trials that we go
[2:06:03] through that are not our fault,
[2:06:08] but there's no way to get out of it. And
[2:06:11] I think about this one. This is one
[2:06:13] that's that's near and dear to my heart
[2:06:16] just because I I work with kids at
[2:06:18] school. There can be family situations.
[2:06:21] Moms or dads could have arguments. They
[2:06:23] could split up. They could divorce. The
[2:06:26] child has done absolutely nothing
[2:06:30] wrong. But that child goes through a
[2:06:33] great trial for much of their life
[2:06:36] because of a decision that they had no
[2:06:38] power to
[2:06:39] influence. They have to go through a
[2:06:41] long wilderness journey. It's not their
[2:06:44] fault. But God was with Caleb, right?
[2:06:47] And Joshua in that wilderness journey.
[2:06:49] It would been really hard for me if I
[2:06:50] were Caleb not to be bitter against all
[2:06:53] these other people who I'm just waiting.
[2:06:55] Oh, finally that person died off. I'm
[2:06:58] glad they finally died off. This is my
[2:07:00] enemies list. I can't go until they're
[2:07:01] all dead. I'm celebrating their death.
[2:07:03] That'd be in my flesh. It'd be hard not
[2:07:05] to do that because I am having pain in
[2:07:07] my feet and my back every day for 40
[2:07:10] years because of them. If people had
[2:07:13] just been listening to me the whole
[2:07:14] time, we wouldn't be in this boat. But
[2:07:17] you know what? God works in Caleb and
[2:07:19] Joshua, I bet, in those 40 years, too.
[2:07:21] Just kind of rubbing things out of them
[2:07:23] the whole time. So even if we're in a
[2:07:25] trial that's not of our own
[2:07:29] doing, decisions were made, fights were
[2:07:33] had in families, in churches, whatever.
[2:07:35] And we've been bearing the baggage of
[2:07:37] it. Joshua and Caleb could write the
[2:07:39] book on that. and they were still
[2:07:42] faithful. Amen. The sons of Kora could
[2:07:45] write the book on that. Been there, done
[2:07:47] that, got the
[2:07:48] t-shirt, and they turned it into a
[2:07:50] testimony. Right? So, whatever
[2:07:53] wilderness journey we might still be in,
[2:07:56] walk with God each step of the way. Keep
[2:07:59] walking with him. Fret not yourself
[2:08:02] because all these other people in the
[2:08:03] camp who didn't do right and are causing
[2:08:04] you have a lot of pain. Don't don't fret
[2:08:06] because of
[2:08:07] that. Trust in the Lord. Do good.
[2:08:12] Delight yourself in the Lord. Commit
[2:08:14] your way unto the Lord. Trust in him
[2:08:16] again. Rest. And tomorrow you might have
[2:08:18] to go through the whole cycle again,
[2:08:20] right? And again and again. But that's
[2:08:22] the only way to make through the
[2:08:25] wilderness journey without building up
[2:08:27] bitterness and hatred and everything
[2:08:29] else. It's the only way to make it
[2:08:30] through and come through ready to be a
[2:08:32] victor. Because delight sustains our
[2:08:34] strength and our vision in that long
[2:08:37] period when we await the fulfillment of
[2:08:40] God's promise. Great trials that are not
[2:08:42] our fault. Perhaps it's easier to
[2:08:44] understand a trial when I wish I hadn't
[2:08:47] done that. When it's our fault, we kind
[2:08:49] of feel like, ah, at least I'm being
[2:08:51] punished by going through the trial. No,
[2:08:52] but if it's we never did, it's hard to
[2:08:54] understand. And Caleb lived through the
[2:08:57] 40 years. And in Joshua chapter
[2:09:00] 14, we see verse
[2:09:03] seven, Caleb because he delighted in the
[2:09:06] Lord, he rejoiced to see the day of
[2:09:09] personal victory. In verse 7, Caleb
[2:09:12] says, 40 years old was I when Moses, the
[2:09:16] servant of the Lord, sent me from Kadesh
[2:09:18] Bernie. He's 80 making it through the
[2:09:20] wilderness. He sent me to spy on the
[2:09:23] land and I brought him word again as it
[2:09:24] was in my heart. Not the way my eyes
[2:09:26] saw, but as my heart saw. That's my
[2:09:28] testimony because Caleb delighted in
[2:09:30] God. Nevertheless, my brethren that went
[2:09:32] up with me made the heart of the whole
[2:09:34] people to melt. But I wholly followed
[2:09:36] the Lord my God. And Moses swore on that
[2:09:39] day, saying, Surely the land were on thy
[2:09:42] feet have trodden shall be your
[2:09:43] inheritance, and thy childrens forever
[2:09:45] because you have wholly followed the
[2:09:47] Lord my God. And now, behold, the Lord
[2:09:49] hath kept me alive, as he said, these 40
[2:09:52] and five years, even since the Lord
[2:09:55] spake this word unto Moses with the
[2:09:57] children of Israel. For I am this day
[2:10:00] four score and five years old as yet I
[2:10:02] am as strong this day as in the day that
[2:10:04] Moses sent me. Why? Because he delighted
[2:10:08] in the Lord. He rejoiced to see the day
[2:10:12] of personal victory.
[2:10:16] We've seen what what it's like when the
[2:10:17] Lord's not our delight. What it's like
[2:10:19] when the Lord is our delight. And my
[2:10:20] question now is how are we going to go
[2:10:22] in to tomorrow? How can we delight in
[2:10:25] God when it's not easy? When it's Monday
[2:10:26] morning when we're tired after a weekend
[2:10:30] banquet and things like we didn't good
[2:10:32] didn't get a good night's sleep. Well,
[2:10:33] first off, I'll say post camp blues are
[2:10:36] a real thing. Just because you're sick
[2:10:38] and tired after camp doesn't mean the
[2:10:40] blessings left. Just means your body is
[2:10:41] protested. You need rest. Don't
[2:10:43] overspiritualize that. Delighting in God
[2:10:46] on Monday. Focus on the main point.
[2:10:48] You're in the covenant. It's for you.
[2:10:50] It's a covenant to delight in. You're in
[2:10:53] the picture. The Lord has made the
[2:10:56] covenant with you. Even with you who are
[2:10:58] alive this day, who made it through the
[2:11:00] wilderness journey, who made it through
[2:11:01] whatever spiritual traumas you've been
[2:11:03] in, the Lord talked with you. You're in
[2:11:06] it as well. Focus on the main point.
[2:11:10] You're in the covenant. It's a covenant
[2:11:13] to delight in. And take the time to
[2:11:16] remind each other how God sustained you
[2:11:18] in the past in conversation and song.
[2:11:21] Take the time. A good friend reminds you
[2:11:24] of good things that God's done to you.
[2:11:27] It's easy when a friend comes with a
[2:11:29] problem to kind of nod and and talk
[2:11:31] along with them. But sometimes a good
[2:11:32] friend is good put the brakes on. Say,
[2:11:34] "Hey, hold up. You're not thinking
[2:11:35] completely clearly because God has done
[2:11:36] some good things for you, too." When
[2:11:38] we're in the pit, when we're in the dark
[2:11:40] time, we don't remember those things.
[2:11:43] Read the Bible. Memorize special verses.
[2:11:46] This might sound really trit, hackneed,
[2:11:48] overused, but it's true. As we read the
[2:11:51] Bible, God does things for us. Make
[2:11:54] little If God speaks to you as you're
[2:11:55] reading through the Bible, make marks in
[2:11:57] there. Put little dates in there,
[2:11:59] milestones. I've got a a little prayer
[2:12:02] request. I have I still have it here. I
[2:12:04] wrote it down on the 11th July of 2001.
[2:12:07] This has been in my Bible for 24 years
[2:12:11] and I keep it here as a reminder. And my
[2:12:15] prayer request, I want victory in this
[2:12:16] area of my life. I said, I want to be
[2:12:19] encouraged and not discouraged by
[2:12:22] stronger Christians. That seemed like a
[2:12:24] strange
[2:12:25] request. I would find myself that time.
[2:12:28] I'd look at other brothers in the youth
[2:12:30] group, things like that. Man, they're
[2:12:31] such strong Christians. I could never be
[2:12:34] like that. So I'd look at the strong
[2:12:37] testimonies in the youth. Man, I can
[2:12:38] never and I'd be discouraged by that.
[2:12:41] And I wrote it down. This is what I want
[2:12:43] God to do for I you help me here, God.
[2:12:45] And you know what? On the back of it, I
[2:12:48] still have it. I have a testimony that
[2:12:50] God helped me abundantly in this area of
[2:12:53] my life. He's met the request. When God
[2:12:56] does something for you, mark it down.
[2:12:59] Yeah, I've got portions in my Bible that
[2:13:01] I have this this particular date, this
[2:13:03] particular date, this particular date.
[2:13:05] In the Old Testament, they did the same
[2:13:07] thing, but they didn't have Bibles. And
[2:13:08] what they did, they're going on their
[2:13:10] wilderness journey. God meets them
[2:13:11] somewhere. The next morning, they get up
[2:13:12] and make a pile of stones. They build an
[2:13:15] altar. Just build this pile. Why?
[2:13:18] Because in the wilderness journey, you
[2:13:20] go back the same places. Sometimes as
[2:13:22] you're going back same, the kids ask,
[2:13:24] "Hey, Dad, what's that pile of stones?"
[2:13:25] Like, "Oh, man. I'd forgotten, guys." 10
[2:13:28] years ago when I went through this time,
[2:13:30] this is what God did for me. He met me
[2:13:32] here. Those piles of stones were
[2:13:34] reminders to them of God's goodness
[2:13:37] to them. Make those things for yourself
[2:13:40] because we are so quick to forget what
[2:13:44] God has
[2:13:52] done. Listen to brother Brandham's
[2:13:55] sermons. God sent him for a reason.
[2:13:58] take some time. If God really sent a
[2:14:01] prophet, if he really did it, might it
[2:14:05] be good to spend some time listening to
[2:14:07] it?
[2:14:09] Amen.
[2:14:11] It was probably about 11 years ago that
[2:14:15] the pastor that I grew up under, he left
[2:14:17] the message and was gone. And that was a
[2:14:21] really, really tough time in my life. I
[2:14:25] read everything out there that could be
[2:14:28] read against the message at that time. I
[2:14:30] read it all. It was really, really hard.
[2:14:33] But I I went through probably a year or
[2:14:36] two process doing all those things. And
[2:14:37] I finally realized, you know
[2:14:39] what? What am I really looking for?
[2:14:41] Could God do any kind of one or two
[2:14:43] things? And I kind of realized after a
[2:14:44] while, it was almost a game of
[2:14:45] whack-a-ole that you this question comes
[2:14:48] up and you start answering that and
[2:14:49] something else comes up and something
[2:14:50] else comes. Hold up.
[2:14:53] My life is not founded upon a life story
[2:14:57] of one man. If I go back and look and
[2:15:00] say my is the truth of the godhead that
[2:15:03] God is one not three. Is that from the
[2:15:05] Bible? Yes, it is. If you take a
[2:15:08] look was it more than an apple in the
[2:15:11] garden of Eden? You look through the
[2:15:12] Bible. Yes, it was. It was more than
[2:15:15] that. Is baptism in the name of the Lord
[2:15:18] Jesus Christ? Is it in father? Yes, it
[2:15:20] it this this is true. I go back and God
[2:15:23] was moving me in that time from a false
[2:15:25] foundation to a true strong foundation.
[2:15:28] And after a while, I got to I was in my
[2:15:32] room by myself one evening and I got to
[2:15:35] um I had done a a study on complexes
[2:15:38] years back and I just picked it up and I
[2:15:41] read this quote, Brother Brandham's
[2:15:43] reading in in Phoenix in 1962 and he
[2:15:47] said, he says, "I remember when I first
[2:15:49] came here in Phoenix in my good 1940s.
[2:15:52] What a wonderful time we had in there."
[2:15:56] He's kind of reminiscing nostalgia take
[2:15:59] you back to the past. He says, "The
[2:16:00] ministry's come up higher. Gifts have
[2:16:02] been multiplied, but somehow or another,
[2:16:05] I wish I was just back like I was at the
[2:16:09] first place." He's been through a lot.
[2:16:12] You could kind of hear
[2:16:14] that if we just forget some of the
[2:16:16] things they ever learned, I think we'd
[2:16:18] be a lot better off. Some of the battles
[2:16:19] we go through, the memories aren't
[2:16:21] always so good. I wish we could forget
[2:16:23] that. And he says,
[2:16:26] "Well, I think the road to God is
[2:16:28] through the path of humility and
[2:16:30] service." You know what? I think there's
[2:16:32] nothing better in the world to lift us
[2:16:34] up to Christ than that. Humility and
[2:16:37] service. Because when we're serving,
[2:16:38] we're getting our eyes off ourselves
[2:16:40] onto somebody else. And that's the best
[2:16:42] way out. You know, this is what really
[2:16:44] touched me. You get to see in the
[2:16:46] wilderness journey, you get to see
[2:16:48] carnal
[2:16:49] impersonations and so forth and it kind
[2:16:52] of dulls you and it puts something in
[2:16:55] you. I wish it didn't do that. He says,
[2:16:58] I think it gets you in the state of a
[2:17:01] complex when you shouldn't be
[2:17:03] there. You should just keep all things
[2:17:05] away and move on. And he didn't name the
[2:17:08] kind of complex it is, but I think it
[2:17:10] was a complex of skepticism because when
[2:17:13] you've been through seen so many things
[2:17:15] that said they were great, but they
[2:17:16] weren't. After all, I say I will keep
[2:17:18] everything at arms length. Everything at
[2:17:21] arms length. I feel more comfortable. I
[2:17:22] keep things at arms length. And I was
[2:17:24] doing that myself with the message for a
[2:17:27] long time. Keeping it at arms length. At
[2:17:29] arms length. It's really hard to get to
[2:17:31] know somebody when you keep them at arms
[2:17:34] length. And what I did, I thought I want
[2:17:37] to get to know brother Brad and this
[2:17:39] message from ground zero. So what I did,
[2:17:43] I went back listen started
[2:17:45] 1947. There's not very many t I started
[2:17:48] listening and listening and listening to
[2:17:50] those and get to know not what people
[2:17:52] said he was but how he actually presents
[2:17:55] himself and it rings true. It rings
[2:17:58] genuine. This is not a man who's trying
[2:18:00] to deceive. This is a man who who cares
[2:18:03] and loves people who chose the wrong
[2:18:04] way. Spend some time if God really sent
[2:18:08] a messenger. It might be worth just a
[2:18:11] little of our time to get to know him
[2:18:14] personally. That's right. If God speaks
[2:18:16] to your heart, do it. Don't delay. Don't
[2:18:19] participate in rumors. Try to bless
[2:18:21] someone else.
[2:18:23] And just in closing, I want to share a
[2:18:25] quote with you that uh is a blessing to
[2:18:28] me because you might think, I mean, I
[2:18:30] want to be a believer, but I've seen so
[2:18:33] many believers that were just
[2:18:34] impersonations. I don't want to be like
[2:18:36] brother X or I don't want to be like
[2:18:37] sister Y. I don't I want to be like
[2:18:38] that. I want to be something different.
[2:18:41] Well, I've got good news. We might think
[2:18:44] that being a believer, the better a
[2:18:46] believer you are, the more fanatical
[2:18:47] things you'll say or do. That's not the
[2:18:49] way it is. Believing is not
[2:18:52] fanaticism. This is Blet message.
[2:18:54] Believe from the heart. God does things
[2:18:56] so
[2:18:58] simple. Yet we're so frustrated till we
[2:19:02] look for great big things. We want God
[2:19:04] to come and do a great big thing for us.
[2:19:06] Bam, our trial is completely gone. He
[2:19:09] doesn't always do that. He says, "Be
[2:19:11] satisfied with little things.
[2:19:14] Watch him when he does his glorious
[2:19:16] works. How he protects you." Yes. how he
[2:19:20] protects you. How often do we overlook
[2:19:21] something like that? But he, brother
[2:19:22] Ben, calls it a glorious work. Don't be
[2:19:25] looking way over the top of something,
[2:19:27] seeing what God hasn't done for you yet,
[2:19:29] and being bitter at God for not doing
[2:19:31] the big thing you've asked for when God
[2:19:33] is taking care of you in the little
[2:19:35] things today. That's good. Notice, I've
[2:19:40] begun to think it's possible that you
[2:19:42] can live close to God and God through
[2:19:45] his grace operates through you. that the
[2:19:49] more God you get, the more godly you
[2:19:50] become, the more eternal life come in,
[2:19:52] the more of the intellectual it pushes
[2:19:54] out. This is these two these two slides
[2:19:57] are describing a life that delights in
[2:19:59] the Lord. And he says, "Now, I don't
[2:20:01] mean to be a
[2:20:03] fanatic. I mean to be a real, sane,
[2:20:08] sound believer." Amen. Not a bunch of
[2:20:11] isms, but a real solid, true, sensible,
[2:20:16] intelligent believer.
[2:20:18] Sometimes our association with the real
[2:20:21] believers, we think, "Ah, they say the
[2:20:24] fanatical things and the more fanatical
[2:20:26] it sounds. Say, "Wow, praise God. What a
[2:20:28] what a great." No. And then they just
[2:20:29] burn out and go off in the end. But look
[2:20:31] at the words used to describe a believer
[2:20:34] here. Seven adjectives. Real. Yeah.
[2:20:39] Sane. A believer have to be crazy. They
[2:20:41] can be a sane person, a real sane, sound
[2:20:45] believer. established on the scriptures,
[2:20:47] a sound believer, not a bunch of ism,
[2:20:50] but
[2:20:51] solid, not hollow, but solid, true,
[2:20:55] sensible, intelligent. Yes. Beautiful.
[2:20:59] God is looking for believers like this,
[2:21:02] right? Real, sane, sound, solid, true,
[2:21:08] sensible, intelligent
[2:21:11] believers. That's what we're called to
[2:21:13] be.
[2:21:15] Review these verbs. Fret not. Trust the
[2:21:18] Lord. Delight. Commit. Trust. Rest. And
[2:21:23] while we're doing that,
[2:21:25] do as musicians
[2:21:28] come. Just want
[2:21:30] to close maybe we can just close our
[2:21:33] eyes for a moment and and think over the
[2:21:36] thoughts that that we've heard.
[2:21:42] I don't know what your wilderness
[2:21:43] journeys look like, but everybody goes
[2:21:45] through a wilderness
[2:21:47] journey. And I can imagine those 20 year
[2:21:50] olds, 30 year olds, 40 year olds who are
[2:21:52] there at the
[2:21:54] Jordan. They've got plenty of
[2:21:57] baggage, plenty of
[2:21:59] complexes. They've seen their friends
[2:22:02] leave. They've seen hard feelings
[2:22:03] develop. They've seen all kinds of
[2:22:05] splits.
[2:22:07] But for some reason, they're still
[2:22:09] there. They're
[2:22:12] still they've still made it to the
[2:22:14] Jordan River, and they're getting ready
[2:22:16] to go off over with over the Jordan with
[2:22:20] with with Joshua. And why? They might
[2:22:22] wonder some, why am I still here? I've
[2:22:25] seen so much bad stuff. Why am I still
[2:22:27] here? They might not be able to answer
[2:22:28] the question
[2:22:29] themselves. And maybe you wonder, man, I
[2:22:31] don't know how I'm still here, but I am
[2:22:33] still here. And I've got all kinds of
[2:22:36] bad memories of the past that I wish I
[2:22:39] could just get over. I want to be that
[2:22:41] kind of believer that that we just
[2:22:44] described. I don't want to be that
[2:22:46] fanatical person that and the fear of
[2:22:48] being that fanatic crazy believer just
[2:22:49] goes about hurting people that keeps me
[2:22:52] from actually taking a step toward God.
[2:22:53] I just want to let you know that's not
[2:22:55] the real deal.
[2:22:57] Will you be willing to stop keeping the
[2:23:00] Lord at arms length and accept him for
[2:23:03] who he truly is? That's the purpose of
[2:23:08] the book of Deuteronomy. And really,
[2:23:10] that's the
[2:23:11] purpose of what the message truly
[2:23:15] is, to be able to put the
[2:23:17] interpretations that people have put on
[2:23:18] it to the side and get to know God for
[2:23:21] who he really is.
[2:23:26] And if you say, ' Man, I've got some
[2:23:28] wilderness journey trauma, some battle
[2:23:30] trauma, some some from spiritual
[2:23:31] battles. I just want to put that
[2:23:35] aside. And you say, I want to testify
[2:23:37] that I want to go on with
[2:23:40] God. I'd love to pray with you. Would
[2:23:42] you just say, "Yes, God has spoken to my
[2:23:44] heart today, and I've got all those
[2:23:46] complexes. I've got enough baggage, more
[2:23:48] than you could believe, Brother Rap, but
[2:23:50] I want to go on. Would you pray for me?"
[2:23:52] God bless you.
[2:23:54] God bless you. God bless you. God bless
[2:23:58] you. God bless you. Yes, each one. God
[2:24:01] bless you. As we all go through these
[2:24:05] things, but Jesus speaks to us in the
[2:24:08] book of Matthew. Come unto me all you
[2:24:11] who labor and are heavy laden. You've
[2:24:15] carried the burdens long enough. Jesus
[2:24:17] is the one to give
[2:24:20] rest. Come to him. Amen. Lord Jesus, I
[2:24:24] just commit each and every family here,
[2:24:26] each and every person, old and young.
[2:24:28] Lord, Lord, we all have these scars
[2:24:31] sometimes that that really do affect us,
[2:24:33] Lord. I pray, oh God, that you would
[2:24:37] help each person, old and young, Lord,
[2:24:39] to get to know you better truly, Lord,
[2:24:42] that we might be able to really walk
[2:24:44] with you and delight in you. Bring us
[2:24:47] back, Lord, to the main point. I pray in
[2:24:51] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[2:24:53] pray.
[2:24:55] Amen.
[2:24:57] Amen. You know the song through it
[2:25:00] [Music]
[2:25:05] all. Maybe we can just stand and sing
[2:25:08] this one. Yeah. We'll start with the uh
[2:25:12] start with the chorus and then I just
[2:25:14] invite the song leader to come or
[2:25:16] brother Paul wherever he takes it from
[2:25:17] here. Through it
[2:25:22] all, through it
[2:25:27] all, I've learned to trust in
[2:25:32] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[2:25:37] [Music]
[2:25:38] God. Through it
[2:25:43] all, through it
[2:25:48] all, I've learned to
[2:25:52] depend upon his
[2:25:57] word. Help me out. I've had beneath
[2:26:01] tears and
[2:26:03] sorrows. I've had questions for
[2:26:07] tomorrow.
[2:26:10] many
[2:26:11] times then to know right from
[2:26:15] [Music]
[2:26:19] wrong. But in every
[2:26:23] situation, God gave blessed
[2:26:28] consolation that my trials only come to
[2:26:33] make me strong.
[2:26:40] Through it
[2:26:44] all, through it
[2:26:49] all, I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[2:27:15] his
[2:27:18] word. I don't want to get up here and
[2:27:22] repreach brother Rap's sermon, but I
[2:27:25] just as he was preaching, it just really
[2:27:27] touched my heart. I got to thinking
[2:27:30] about in Joshua
[2:27:35] 15, Joshua's daughter, I never
[2:27:37] pronounced her name correctly, forgive
[2:27:39] me, but
[2:27:40] Asha, she comes one day and says, "You
[2:27:43] know, I got the promise. I've crossed
[2:27:46] over. I've got the
[2:27:48] land, but I need the springs."
[2:27:53] You
[2:27:54] see, through everything that Caleb
[2:27:59] experienced, young people, you're here.
[2:28:01] We're trusting that God would deal with
[2:28:03] your hearts and draw you closer to him
[2:28:06] and open up that revelation of who he
[2:28:09] is. That you would be able to realize
[2:28:11] you're not just here to spend your life
[2:28:13] and go away, but you're here for a
[2:28:16] purpose, and that's to fulfill God's
[2:28:18] word. And it just struck me, brother
[2:28:21] Rap, as you were preaching on that
[2:28:24] everything Caleb went
[2:28:25] through, he still left a testimony with
[2:28:30] his daughter that she didn't say, "This
[2:28:33] has been too tough. This has been she
[2:28:36] come and said, "This work has been
[2:28:38] started. A promise was made. I've got a
[2:28:41] portion of my promise. Now I want the
[2:28:43] Holy Ghost. I want the spring in the
[2:28:46] valley. I want the spring in the
[2:28:47] mountaintop. no matter where I'm living,
[2:28:49] I want that spring in my life. And she
[2:28:54] had enough courage at that stage right
[2:28:56] there, enough foundation laid that she
[2:28:59] come and said, "It's time. I want to
[2:29:01] receive this. I want the complete work
[2:29:05] finished in my life." And young people,
[2:29:08] I want to encourage you. Don't stop
[2:29:09] right here. I I trust you've had a good
[2:29:12] weekend. I I pray that you have. And
[2:29:15] don't stop right here, though. Don't
[2:29:17] stop until you have the spring in the
[2:29:18] valley of your life and you have the
[2:29:20] spring in the mountain of your life.
[2:29:23] That everywhere you go, the living water
[2:29:26] is flowing for you. It's not a time to
[2:29:29] say, "We had a good weekend." It's a
[2:29:31] time to say, "I've moved forward in my
[2:29:33] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:29:36] and I'm not going back." I I've heard,
[2:29:39] you know, she had to have heard some of
[2:29:40] those stories. She had to have heard
[2:29:42] about the the the the family dying in
[2:29:45] the wilderness. She hadn't heard about
[2:29:47] all of these conditions that had to
[2:29:49] come. But Caleb's ministry to his
[2:29:54] daughter was strong enough that none of
[2:29:57] those stories turned her away.
[2:30:01] You see, as parents, sometimes we speak
[2:30:03] too freely in front of our children of
[2:30:06] the
[2:30:07] negative. Lord, help us to speak freely
[2:30:11] of the positive
[2:30:13] before our children. Amen. We'll just
[2:30:16] have our brother Isaac. I'd like to just
[2:30:18] sing a song. I had a couple here I just
[2:30:20] wrote down as I thinking about it. But I
[2:30:23] would just like us to just sing that
[2:30:24] song. The name of the Lord. Amen. It's
[2:30:27] my strong tower. Amen. God bless you. I
[2:30:31] trust you are blessed today. And as we
[2:30:33] would close out the service, Brother
[2:30:35] Isaac will bless the food and we'll have
[2:30:38] a little fellowship time. Amen. If
[2:30:40] you've been blessed by Brother Rap's
[2:30:42] ministry this weekend, do not be bashful
[2:30:46] to let him know. Amen. It'll do good for
[2:30:49] you to say, "I was blessed." And it will
[2:30:52] do him good to know that what he has
[2:30:55] labored and come. You You heard the
[2:30:56] story. I mean, everything that's coming,
[2:30:58] all the issues, some family issues, a
[2:31:00] basement full of water, missed flights,
[2:31:03] uh or cancelled flight, all these
[2:31:05] things. It wasn't easy for brother Rap
[2:31:08] to get here, but he never gave up
[2:31:10] because he said, "I'm going to come. I
[2:31:12] want to speak. I want to see these young
[2:31:14] people blessed." So, God bless you as we
[2:31:17] sing this
[2:31:19] song. Name of the
[2:31:22] Lord
[2:31:24] in a
[2:31:29] strong righteous run into.
[2:31:34] They are
[2:31:36] [Music]
[2:31:38] saved. Name of the Lord
[2:31:43] is a strong
[2:31:47] tower. Righteous
[2:31:49] run
[2:31:51] to and they are
[2:31:57] saved. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:32:03] Blessed be the name of the
[2:32:07] Lord. Blessed be the name of the
[2:32:10] Lord most
[2:32:16] high. Blessed be the name of the
[2:32:20] Lord. Blessed be the name of the
[2:32:25] Lord. Blessed be the name of the
[2:32:29] Lord most high.
[2:32:34] The name of my
[2:32:35] Lord
[2:32:37] is a strong tower.
[2:32:43] The righteous run
[2:32:51] into the name of the
[2:32:53] Lord
[2:32:56] is a strong
[2:33:00] tower. The righteous run
[2:33:04] into and they are saved.
[2:33:11] Blessed be the name of my
[2:33:15] Lord. Blessed be the name of my
[2:33:19] Lord. Blessed be the name of my
[2:33:23] Lord most
[2:33:28] high. Blessed be the name of my
[2:33:33] Lord. Blessed be the name of my
[2:33:37] Lord. Blessed be the name of my
[2:33:41] lord most
[2:33:46] high. Amen.
[2:33:49] Hallelujah.
[2:33:52] Um I always debate you know listening to
[2:33:56] them the sermon different things go
[2:33:59] through your mind God lays something on
[2:34:01] your heart. Should I say something?
[2:34:02] Should I should I not? But uh just
[2:34:04] thinking about that wilderness
[2:34:06] experience. I've been reading in Psalms
[2:34:09] similar right around where you were
[2:34:10] reading there, brother. Um Psalms
[2:34:13] 42 says, "Oh my soul, why art thou that
[2:34:17] cast down? Why thou just quieted within
[2:34:20] me?" And it goes on to say, "Yet I went
[2:34:22] into the house of the Lord and praised
[2:34:24] him anyway."
[2:34:27] It's
[2:34:28] that trust committing it unto him,
[2:34:31] right? and then
[2:34:34] delighting in what he's done.
[2:34:38] Amen. I debated on what song to sing,
[2:34:41] but I'd like to sing that little that
[2:34:42] song, Nothing Without You. You
[2:34:46] know,
[2:34:49] God, it starts with something simple
[2:34:51] like you read at the end there, brother,
[2:34:53] with something simple, raising your
[2:34:55] hand, saying, "Lord Jesus, it's not us
[2:34:58] that does it. It's the life within us,
[2:35:00] the Christ within us.
[2:35:03] So, if we could just sing this this
[2:35:09] morning. Take these
[2:35:13] hands and lift them up.
[2:35:20] For I have not the strength to praise
[2:35:24] you near
[2:35:28] enough. I have
[2:35:33] nothing. Lord, I am
[2:35:36] [Music]
[2:35:38] nothing without you.
[2:35:45] Take my
[2:35:48] voice and pour it
[2:35:54] out. Let it sing the songs of mercy I
[2:36:00] have
[2:36:03] found. I am nothing.
[2:36:09] I am
[2:36:13] nothing without
[2:36:19] you. And all my
[2:36:24] soul
[2:36:26] needs is all your
[2:36:31] love to cover me.
[2:36:36] So all the
[2:36:39] world will
[2:36:43] see I have
[2:36:47] nothing without
[2:36:53] you. Take my
[2:36:57] body and build it up.
[2:37:04] May it be broken as an
[2:37:09] offering of
[2:37:13] love. I have
[2:37:18] nothing. I am
[2:37:21] [Music]
[2:37:23] nothing without
[2:37:29] you. Take my time.
[2:37:34] here on this
[2:37:39] earth and let it
[2:37:42] glorify you all. You are
[2:37:49] worth Lord. I am nothing.
[2:37:55] I am
[2:38:00] nothing without
[2:38:05] you. Take these
[2:38:10] hands and lift them up.
[2:38:15] [Music]
[2:38:17] For I have not the strength to praise
[2:38:22] you near
[2:38:26] enough. Lord, I am
[2:38:31] nothing. I have
[2:38:36] nothing without
[2:38:42] you.
[2:38:44] Amen. Amen. As we get ready to dismiss,
[2:38:47] let's just say a word of
[2:38:50] prayer over the food and the fellowship
[2:38:52] this afternoon. Amen. Let's bow our
[2:38:54] heads. Gracious heavenly

[2:39:18] heart lead us and guide us, Lord Jesus.
[2:39:21] May your footsteps, Lord, just be led by
[2:39:25] you. May each one go safely home as the
[2:39:27] different ones would have to travel,
[2:39:30] Lord Jesus. May you watch over every
[2:39:31] each and every one, Lord.
[2:39:35] And Lord, may you bless our fellowship
[2:39:36] this afternoon. May it May we speak of
[2:39:40] the things that you've done for us, Lord
[2:39:43] [Music]

[2:39:52] food, bless our time together, bless
[2:39:54] each one, we pray. We ask it in Jesus
[2:39:57] Christ's name.
