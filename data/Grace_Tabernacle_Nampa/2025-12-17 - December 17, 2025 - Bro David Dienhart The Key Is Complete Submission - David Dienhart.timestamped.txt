[14:44] hand to me.
[14:49] that leads in way
[14:55] I can not see
[15:00] while going through
[15:05] this world of woes
[15:10] whose hand still leads

[16:14] And while it leaves
[16:19] I have no fear,
[16:25] I know will lead
[16:30] me to that home
[16:35] where sin no song
[16:41] can Come.
[16:45] I'm trusting to
[16:50] the unseen hand
[16:55] that guides me through
[17:01] this weery land.
[17:06] And some sweet day
[17:11] I'll reach that strength.

[18:08] I'm trusting to

[18:28] And some sweet day
[18:33] I'll reach that strength.
[18:38] Still guided by
[18:43] the unseen

[18:50] Amen.
[18:53] Amen. And so we ask our brother David to
[18:55] come tonight.
[18:58] Just like to sing Give Me Jesus 700.
[19:09] In the morning when I rise.
[19:15] In the morning when I rise.
[19:21] In the morning when I arrive,
[19:26] give me Jesus.
[19:32] Give me Jesus.

[21:40] &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus.
[21:46] and have all this world.
[21:50] Give me Jesus.
[21:56] When I rise, give me Jesus.
[22:00] The Bible said, "Seek ye first the
[22:02] kingdom of God and his righteousness,
[22:04] and all these other things you're so
[22:07] disturbed about and upset about and
[22:08] wondering what you're going to do and
[22:10] not do will be added to you. Your job
[22:13] will work better. Your house will work
[22:16] better.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; You just have to give yourself first to
[22:19] him.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; And where is this kingdom of God? In
[22:23] you.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; So, who are we to seek first?
[22:28] Him.
[22:30] Put him first.
[22:32] I remember it been many, many years ago,
[22:35] but I heard a message. It smoked my
[22:37] heart. I made a promise to the Lord. He
[22:40] said, "Every time I want you to sit down
[22:41] and read the word, you've got Satan
[22:44] points something else for you to do."
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; But the Lord said, "But if you'll put me
[22:50] first."
[22:52] And I did.
[22:55] And I said, "Lord, by your grace, when
[22:58] you lay in my heart to feed and to pray,
[23:00] I'm not going to let something else that
[23:02] I think has to be done or something
[23:04] Satan wants me to look at or wants me to
[23:06] do, I'm going to put you first.
[23:10] You say, "Brother David, you know, you
[23:12] just I just can't I just can't do that
[23:14] first thing in the morning. Why not?
[23:18] Well, I need my beauty sleep."
[23:21] Brother, sister,
[23:23] you can make time. We ought to be
[23:26] redeeming the time
[23:28] &gt;&gt; and giving it to him. So, I just say
[23:31] that to encourage you. I know by
[23:33] experience what that means and I know it
[23:36] works. So, God bless you. Let's stand
[23:39] together.
[23:42] Glad to be here tonight.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; It don't matter if there's many here. It
[23:46] doesn't matter. God doesn't look at
[23:47] numbers. He looks at open hearts.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; And he's looking at not the number here,
[23:53] but where two or three are gathered
[23:55] together in my name, he's in the midst.
[23:58] And so, we want more of him. I
[24:00] appreciate the songs tonight. And God
[24:03] bless you. You can musicians can be
[24:06] seated if you'd like, but everything
[24:08] went just exactly even to the last one.
[24:11] Give me Jesus.
[24:14] And so we want that. And I and I just
[24:16] greet those online
[24:19] listening in. You just may God bless you
[24:22] and bless his word to our hearts
[24:23] tonight. May we have open hearts to
[24:26] receive from you.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; If it means correction, then it's the
[24:30] love of God to us. Amen.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; And may we take the right attitude and
[24:34] our attitude, you know, our attitude
[24:36] toward the word will determine life.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; Just the attitude toward your toward the
[24:41] word of God when it's brought. Amen. So
[24:44] it can determine eternal life. And so we
[24:47] just want to be very sensitive to how
[24:50] the Lord speaks to us and realize it's
[24:52] not the man you've come to hear, but
[24:54] it's the word of the Lord. Amen. Let's
[24:56] bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we know
[24:59] that you're our Lord. I'm so glad that
[25:03] individuals in this hour can say you are
[25:06] my Lord and you are our father and we
[25:11] are your seed, your elect, your gene of
[25:14] your own life. And Lord, we are here not
[25:17] to be a show. We are here to declare
[25:19] you. The testimony we hold, Lord, is the
[25:23] spirit of prophecy. And you said we
[25:26] would prophesy again. The word would be
[25:28] in the mouth of your bride. She would be
[25:30] the final voice to this final age. Not
[25:32] another voice, but your voice. What the
[25:36] spirit of God said through his prophet,
[25:38] the bride will say. And so, Father, we
[25:41] know that this is our time and you've
[25:44] come on the scene. And Lord, you're
[25:46] desiring a greater love affair with your
[25:49] people. Bless your word now. Father,
[25:52] strengthen your people through your word
[25:54] and bring faith as you promise. For it
[25:57] comes by hearing the word in Jesus
[26:00] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[26:05] If you turn me to Revelation with me, I
[26:07] mean to Revelations 19. Very familiar
[26:10] verse. We go to it a lot in this hour
[26:12] because it's our day. It's our time.
[26:14] It's what's taking place.
[26:17] And we understand that we're soon to be
[26:20] carried over here, brother, sister.
[26:21] We're very, very close. And we see
[26:24] Israel as our time piece. We see what's
[26:26] happening. We see the scriptures being
[26:28] fulfilled. They're in their homeland.
[26:31] And Jacob's having trouble.
[26:35] And so, but they're they have they're in
[26:37] their land. They were got wolves got
[26:41] after him. Brother Bam said, pushed them
[26:42] into their land. They're in their place
[26:45] just waiting for the bride. You know
[26:46] what they're waiting for? They're
[26:47] waiting for the bride to go.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; So they can receive two witnesses.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I know we're close, even the
[26:54] elements and everything. So we're close
[26:57] to our catching away.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God wants you to know what he
[27:03] thinks about it, thinks about you, and
[27:06] and to realize that he's calling every
[27:11] individual.
[27:12] He can't come for his bride until she's
[27:16] complete and until she's matured.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a maturity.
[27:23] And so there's we know that we've been
[27:25] given a message to mature the bride. In
[27:28] fact, we have a message that's a perfect
[27:30] interpretation of the word. And so we
[27:34] can't take that lightly. Amen. We have
[27:36] an open book. And so many things. What I
[27:40] want to say tonight, I just I've had to
[27:42] narrow way down to just one subject.
[27:44] It's been on my mind here for four,
[27:46] three, four, five weeks.
[27:49] And I've ministered on this or on these
[27:51] on these things that the prophet said
[27:53] many times. But I want to speak on the
[27:56] key is complete. The key the key is
[28:00] complete submission.
[28:02] The key is complete submission.
[28:06] In verse 7 and 8 of Revelation 19, let
[28:11] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[28:16] him for the marriage of the lamb is come
[28:20] and his wife hath made herself ready.
[28:24] And to her was granted to her was
[28:27] granted. You want to remember that in
[28:30] revel in Matthew
[28:32] 25:10. And they that were ready went in
[28:36] with him to the marriage. And then to
[28:38] her that's gone into the marriage was
[28:41] granted that she should be arrayed in
[28:44] fine linen, clean and white, for the
[28:47] fine linen is the righteousness of
[28:49] saints. Then it says in verse nine, "And
[28:51] he saith unto me, write, blessed are
[28:54] they which are called into the marriage
[28:57] supper of the Lamb, for he saith unto
[29:01] me, these are the true sayings of God."
[29:03] I want you to turn with me over to 1
[29:05] Corinthians 6.
[29:10] Now, we know the prophet said, "The
[29:12] marriage has come." He said, "We're
[29:13] going to the rapture." The rapture is
[29:15] the wedding supper. He said, "The
[29:18] ministry of our day when he took the
[29:20] book, same thing that that that
[29:24] Boaz did when he when he took Ruth Ruth,
[29:28] he took the book."
[29:31] Amen. So, we realize that there's a book
[29:34] opened and everything we need to get
[29:36] ready is provided in that open book.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; And so, he's because and I'll get to
[29:42] that in just I get ahead of myself here.
[29:44] So in 1 Corinthians 6
[29:48] I'll take one verse here verse 17. But
[29:52] he that is joined unto the Lord is one
[29:56] spirit.
[29:58] So may God add his blessings to the
[30:00] word. You can be seated.
[30:02] Amen.
[30:05] Brother Brandham on the message
[30:09] on the message in perfect faith
[30:13] he says this and this has been as I said
[30:15] I'm not going to give you anything new
[30:17] you haven't heard
[30:20] but God is and I had administered here a
[30:23] while back on a Wednesday in desperation
[30:25] there well actually it's it's in uh
[30:30] to become totally submitted to the Lord
[30:34] uh uh in not desperation is the word I
[30:36] want to use but but anyway I I believe
[30:39] you understand but now he says in
[30:41] perfect faith he says and now we become
[30:43] anointed with that same spirit anointed
[30:47] messiahs messiahs of the last day to
[30:51] shine forth the resurrection of Jesus
[30:53] Christ to show that he is not dead but
[30:56] in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in
[30:58] his people moving among his bride with a
[31:02] love affair to her pouring out into her
[31:06] himself.
[31:08] They are be sounds like sounds like it's
[31:10] a it's a union and we know that we've
[31:14] entered into a a spiritual invisible
[31:18] union.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; And we must come into that in order to
[31:22] take a rapture.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[31:25] &gt;&gt; And so this is the marriage we're
[31:27] talking about. It's an invisible union,
[31:29] a spiritual union. We know that we've
[31:31] got to come to a wedding supper and but
[31:34] only those that are in union with him
[31:36] will be there.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[31:38] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about in union now.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, and that and that comes from
[31:44] being born again.
[31:47] When you are born again, immediately
[31:49] you're raptured up and seated in
[31:52] heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[31:54] spiritually. Amen. Then you grow. You
[31:58] have to grow. And God's given us
[32:00] everything we need. In fact, the prophet
[32:02] said this. He said here, he said, "The
[32:04] bridegroom don't leave out nothing.
[32:07] He's got the ring.
[32:09] He's got the ring." And and the prophet
[32:12] even said, "It's already put on your
[32:14] finger." Unmmerited grace. He said he
[32:18] put the ring upon your fa your finger. A
[32:20] ring of unmmerited grace. And he said
[32:23] the bridegroom don't leave nothing out.
[32:25] He's got the ring.
[32:27] He's got the identification which is the
[32:30] marriage certificate. We know that the
[32:32] book being opened that book was a
[32:34] marriage certificate.
[32:37] the ident got the identification
[32:41] and he's got the robe. She's she's she's
[32:46] uh
[32:50] the robe she wears her clothing all all
[32:54] provided
[32:56] where it's already provided for
[32:59] &gt;&gt; the book's opened. Amen. Without the
[33:02] opening of the book, the blood sacrifice
[33:04] would be nothing.
[33:07] I want to minister on that here just
[33:10] whenever I can and maybe take three or
[33:12] four services. But the purpose of
[33:15] Calvary
[33:17] because you remember in the scripture I
[33:19] why I'm saying this I'm way ahead of
[33:20] myself but anyway the the purpose of
[33:22] Calvary if that book wasn't opened all
[33:25] creation's lost.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; And he's already paid the price of
[33:28] redemption but he paid the price of
[33:30] redemption for a purpose.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we want to and so he's he's
[33:37] provided everything we need even given
[33:39] us an open book and that she eats and
[33:41] becomes that book living. Amen. Because
[33:45] you you are what you eat.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; You become what you eat. So it depends
[33:52] on what you're feeding on.
[33:55] You're going to become that book. Amen.
[33:57] And that book has everything you need to
[33:59] make a rapture. Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Remember John was said, "Give me the
[34:05] book." Said, "Take it."
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just going to drop this side
[34:09] in. But but you remember, no man was
[34:12] worthy to even look at it.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; No man was even worthy to take it. No
[34:15] man could even open it. But the lamb
[34:18] stepped forth. Actually, the lion
[34:20] stepped forth in the form of a lamb, the
[34:23] one that did give his life for us and
[34:25] then opened this book.
[34:29] Now, that book that has been opened, I'm
[34:32] I'm ahead of myself and I'm going to let
[34:33] go and just let God have his way.
[34:39] What was once God's great secret, great
[34:42] mysterious secret in his mind is now put
[34:45] in the hearts of the believer.
[34:49] That is the body of Christ. What was
[34:51] once what was God's once great secret in
[34:55] his mind, that was a sealed secret.
[35:00] before the foundation of the world is
[35:02] now made manifested. He said, "Think of
[35:04] it."
[35:06] Amen. All right. So, there was a secret.
[35:09] He couldn't let out. John was forbidden
[35:11] to write it. And brother Bram said,
[35:12] "Notice those seven thunders. Those
[35:15] seven thunders,
[35:17] we don't know what they are, but we need
[35:18] to know." And he said, "He what we need
[35:20] to know." And he said, "It'll take a
[35:22] prophet to get the revelation."
[35:25] Now I don't be afraid of me saying seven
[35:27] thunders because there's a great there's
[35:29] a great message in this. In fact, it's
[35:32] the message of the seventh angel.
[35:35] So we don't want to belittle seven
[35:37] thunders.
[35:40] Amen. Because it's a message of the of
[35:42] the angel, the messenger. And that
[35:44] message that message in itself, there's
[35:47] been no there's been nothing to no
[35:49] revival for the bride yet. Brother Bram
[35:51] said that in the seals. I don't know why
[35:53] I'm saying this, but I but I'm saying it
[35:55] this way. I didn't claim to say this,
[35:58] but because I wanted to keep it later,
[36:01] but but but he said, but one year later,
[36:05] just about one year later, he said
[36:07] nothing to awake the bride. He said,
[36:09] "It'll take these seven thunders to wake
[36:11] her up."
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Okay. Then he said just almost a year
[36:15] later, just just 7:26 of 64, he preached
[36:19] a message recognizing your day in this
[36:21] message. And he said, "What they haven't
[36:23] recognized, they feel the pull of the
[36:25] hour, but what they haven't recognized
[36:27] is the awakening of the bride."
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[36:29] &gt;&gt; So, she's been awakened.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it took that book open to
[36:35] awaken her.
[36:37] And so, the mystery of that book is who
[36:39] you are.
[36:42] Amen. That's who I am. It was open to
[36:44] the bride because without that being
[36:46] open, there would be no rapture. There
[36:48] would be no catching away. Amen. But we
[36:51] are being caught away secretly to be
[36:53] caught away meet him in the air. But
[36:56] there has to be a there is a secret
[36:58] gather catching away. So anyway getting
[37:00] back to this perfect faith.
[37:03] So but in the form of the Holy Ghost
[37:05] he's in his people moving among his
[37:07] bride with a love affair to her pouring
[37:08] out into her himself. Watch they are
[37:13] becoming one for the wedding supper. So
[37:17] there's an invisible union taking place
[37:19] here. It's not a public show. That's
[37:22] right.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; In fact, only she knows it. And we'll
[37:26] we'll come into that. It's hard for me
[37:27] not to preach what's in my heart from
[37:29] later on. But anyway,
[37:34] so the head has been revealed and he's
[37:36] come back with eternal life and the body
[37:38] must follow that because it's husband
[37:39] and wife again. Amen.
[37:43] As long as you're pregnantated with that
[37:45] same word, which is his body, you took
[37:48] his body. Become in him. When you took
[37:50] the word, you become pregnantated in
[37:53] him. What are you bearing? You're
[37:54] bearing children.
[37:56] And what is that child? That's that body
[37:59] you're looking to meet. Amen. It's being
[38:03] bore. Amen. You're carrying his life.
[38:07] Amen. Why? Why? Why? Because we always
[38:10] were meant to carry life. Yeah,
[38:12] &gt;&gt; as a son of God, it would have to be the
[38:14] seed in me to be quickened. That gene of
[38:16] life was put in me to be quickened and
[38:18] therefore manifest in flesh, showing,
[38:21] identifying I was his son.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, it's not something
[38:26] you do. It's something he's already
[38:27] done.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; We just sang about that. He's already
[38:30] healed me. He's already We have a double
[38:32] cure. You remember the man that come and
[38:35] said, "I have faith, Lord, to see my son
[38:37] healed." You have faith? He said, "Lord,
[38:38] help my unbelief." Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; But what about the other? What about the
[38:42] double cure?
[38:44] There's not only zoo healing, but
[38:47] there's zoo salvation
[38:49] &gt;&gt; by the same faith. Amen. If thou can't
[38:52] believe. Amen. All right. So,
[38:57] so the great secret is always blinded
[38:59] the wisdom of the world. They can't get
[39:01] it. They just don't understand. Satan
[39:02] don't understand it. None of the rest of
[39:04] them understand it. But just those who
[39:06] are predestinated understand how God and
[39:09] Christ are one. See, God is Christ. You
[39:12] that's why the bride and Christ are one.
[39:14] They're no longer twain. All right. So,
[39:18] so coming back to this now.
[39:23] So, he's pouring himself into her. All
[39:26] right.
[39:28] Now, the first thing the prophet did
[39:30] when he opened the the seals, what was
[39:32] the first thing he did? He said, "My
[39:34] first," He said, "my first line of duty
[39:38] coming into a new assembly and was to
[39:40] marry a couple back in the back room." I
[39:42] wonder if it could be the inside of the
[39:44] inside room.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; In the back room.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; All right. He married a couple and the
[39:52] opening of the seals was uniting uniting
[39:55] the bride and the groom together.
[39:57] Brother Bram said, "I've seen great
[39:58] miracles done, mighty mighty things."
[40:01] But he said when he was on the seventh
[40:03] seal, he said, "This is beyond that."
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's something that nobody
[40:09] but the bride can see. It's releasing
[40:11] the bride. We believe in signs and
[40:13] wonders. The spirit can anoint the
[40:15] spirit can anoint the devil.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "No, no, no, brother David.
[40:21] Oh, yeah. The Holy Spirit can anoint."
[40:23] He did Judas,
[40:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; And he went out and worked signs and
[40:27] wonders. And we all believe in signs and
[40:28] wonders. That's why we've got to be
[40:30] careful about what we say to the
[40:32] anointing.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Even though they may not go out and live
[40:35] the word, and they can't live the word,
[40:37] but they can still be anointed,
[40:39] &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God,
[40:41] &gt;&gt; and do signs and wonders and shout and
[40:43] and even prophesy and be the truth.
[40:46] That's
[40:46] &gt;&gt; right.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; But that's not the that's not the
[40:48] evidence. Not even love is the evidence.
[40:50] Did you know that? The prophet said, "I
[40:52] used to believe it was." And you can do
[40:54] all those things, have knowledge, and
[40:56] all of that.
[40:58] and still not have charity.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Charity is God himself.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; You can have all that and still not You
[41:07] can be anointed with the genuine Holy
[41:09] Spirit in your spirit
[41:12] because the spirit controls the body.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; You can be anointed that, but that seed
[41:17] gene is not in the soul. And that's
[41:19] where the evidence is, is that it's the
[41:21] revealing of that that lives itself out.
[41:25] Amen. And that proves whether that
[41:28] genuine love's there or not,
[41:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Because you're able to hear and receive
[41:32] the word for the season.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; You're going to line up with the word
[41:36] because God's in you and that word and
[41:38] you are the word.
[41:41] How many believe that?
[41:42] &gt;&gt; The Jesus said, "Heavens and earth pass
[41:45] away, but my word shall never pass
[41:47] away."
[41:49] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And if you be that word,
[41:51] how you going to pass away? You can't
[41:53] pass away. The word of God will not
[41:56] return void.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; So when you're that word and you are the
[42:00] word, the bride is the word.
[42:03] She she without that open book, she
[42:05] would never realize her position. She's
[42:07] been positionally placed.
[42:10] And and because she becomes the mystery
[42:14] revealed, the full the full mystery, the
[42:16] final mystery and the full mystery of
[42:18] Jesus Christ is his body, the bride.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So it completes it and
[42:25] we move into a body. Without that,
[42:28] without that spiritual revelation,
[42:29] there'd be no rapture.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without that in you now,
[42:36] &gt;&gt; see, without recognizing the turning of
[42:39] the corner,
[42:40] &gt;&gt; without recognizing what God has done,
[42:43] he's turned a corner. We're into the
[42:44] bride age. And and what Pentecost made
[42:47] way for, we're in what made way for,
[42:50] we're fulfilling. And that made way for
[42:52] the Holy Ghost himself to come right
[42:54] down in perfection back to the word
[42:57] again. And that's what we are. That's
[42:59] where we are. Amen. So, so we see in
[43:03] first Corinthians, he that's joined unto
[43:05] the Lord is one spirit.
[43:09] And the prophet said, the real you is
[43:11] that spirit of God in you.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[43:14] &gt;&gt; So that's who you are.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can't pump that up. You
[43:18] can't work that up. It's not a pumping
[43:20] up and working up. And I'm coming to
[43:22] this because I said the key is complete
[43:24] submission
[43:26] &gt;&gt; to one head. And I have a message I want
[43:29] to preach and it'll have to be on
[43:31] something other than a Wednesday, but I
[43:33] want to call it one head. All right? So,
[43:36] so we can we can see that. Now,
[43:40] what is that word bride? Any wife is a
[43:43] part of her husband. Therefore, we must
[43:45] be that word bride. What is that word
[43:47] bride? the manifestation of this hour.
[43:52] She's a living attribute of God, a
[43:54] living oracle of God, living word of
[43:57] God.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; She is the word living.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] She is the word living. Op living. And
[44:05] she's operative living. Amen. She is the
[44:08] word. You can't get her off of that word
[44:10] because she is the word,
[44:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:14] Hallelujah.
[44:16] She is the very thought of God which was
[44:18] his eternal thought expressed in word.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So see everything Paul preached
[44:24] Paul preached things that they knew
[44:25] nothing about. He said you can't even
[44:27] receive it yet because you're still in
[44:28] milk. But we today
[44:32] &gt;&gt; that was hidden in that word has been
[44:33] open to us.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; And we see then our position we've been
[44:37] positionally placed is that word. All
[44:40] right. So so what is it? The revelation
[44:43] of Jesus Christ. Here we see the
[44:46] manifestation of this hour. That's the
[44:47] bride. A living orc, a living attribute
[44:49] of God displaying to the world the
[44:51] attributes of God in the formation of
[44:54] the bride that's to be expressed in this
[44:56] hour that we're now living.
[45:00] What is the promised word for the hour?
[45:02] He said he would have a bride. That was
[45:04] his heart purpose. The Bible said the
[45:07] mystery according to the he purposed in
[45:09] himself that mystery. That's his heart
[45:12] purpose. The very heart purpose of God
[45:14] was to have a bride according to his ch
[45:16] by his choosing.
[45:18] Amen.
[45:20] And so we see the word he always
[45:22] fulfills the scripture and that bride
[45:24] will be loyal to her husband and nothing
[45:27] nobody he said his word calls for a
[45:29] total separation from unbelief.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Nobody is going to stand in the way
[45:34] between the unity of the bride and the
[45:36] groom.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; And our marriage ought to represent
[45:39] that.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Our marriage ought to represent
[45:42] what he and his bride represent. And
[45:45] there ought to be nothing to separate
[45:47] you from your husband or you husband
[45:49] from your wife. Not even children.
[45:56] Because if you do, you're living
[45:58] contrary to the word.
[46:01] Amen. We'll get into this right here
[46:03] this morning, this evening. All right.
[46:05] So,
[46:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ in this
[46:10] hour,
[46:12] not what he was in another hour. We're
[46:14] talking about the revelation of Jesus
[46:16] Christ in this hour. Not what he was in
[46:19] another hour, but what he was now. The
[46:23] Bible expresses what he was is now. What
[46:27] he ever he was, the revelation of Jesus
[46:29] Christ. He can't change what he was.
[46:32] He's going to be expressed what he was,
[46:35] but he's in another garment.
[46:39] He's in another form. Not another
[46:41] person, another form.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; And that form is bride.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, we see here the
[46:50] Bible expresses and this revelation of
[46:53] Jesus Christ in this hour, he said it's
[46:55] growing in the bride to the full
[46:58] stature. What is the full stature?
[47:00] Christ.
[47:02] God and Christ are not divided. They're
[47:04] the same person.
[47:06] Me and my wife are two separate people,
[47:08] but not the bride and God.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; They're the same person.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; It's just himself in another form. Just
[47:16] what Eve was. She was the revelation of
[47:19] Adam. She was Mrs. Adam.
[47:22] Amen. She was the hidden mystery of
[47:24] Adam.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So there's got to be an
[47:29] open book. There's got He's got to take
[47:30] that book today and reveal these things.
[47:33] The full revelation of Jesus Christ
[47:35] comes out. Amen. And we're here to be
[47:38] we're being caught up by that. Caught
[47:41] away.
[47:43] This is not Everybody doesn't There's
[47:46] nobody else knows we're being caught
[47:47] away but the bride.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. I don't care. The cousins,
[47:52] you know, tried to say to that little
[47:54] girl after she met him personally, alone
[47:57] and personally.
[47:59] And when he revealed his purpose of
[48:01] being there, I'm looking for a wife.
[48:04] Would you marry me? And she said, "Yes,
[48:06] that was a vow."
[48:08] &gt;&gt; And the vow is what marries you.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; And she made that vow. And he said,
[48:12] "I'll be back for you."
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; But I've given you everything you need
[48:17] to get ready. But she went through
[48:19] struggles and trials and persecutions
[48:21] and and and and the further we go in
[48:24] this hour, it's going to wrap around the
[48:25] same way the prophet did. He said, "Just
[48:27] think. I have one open door in Phoenix."
[48:31] &gt;&gt; But God spoke back and said, "What is
[48:33] that to you?
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Follow me."
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And there's you be the bride the same
[48:38] way. He said, "Brother Brandham said,
[48:39] the things are happening and unveiling
[48:41] so fast, I can't keep up with it." I
[48:43] told my wife the other day, "These me
[48:45] these things are happening so quick, I
[48:47] can't get enough. It's opening so fast.
[48:50] I can write notes. I might as well quit
[48:51] writing notes because I can't write it
[48:53] down enough. It's opening so quickly."
[48:56] Well, it's coming right along with what
[48:57] he said. And remember, the first one had
[49:00] to come maturity. The word came to his
[49:02] prophet. There had to be a maturity
[49:04] showed forth and that was waved over the
[49:07] rest of them that they would come. Well,
[49:08] Jesus Christ doesn't change. He doesn't
[49:10] change his nature. doesn't change his
[49:12] way. You can expect to be be rebuked if
[49:15] you're living this word, preaching the
[49:17] truth of the hour. You're expected to be
[49:20] questioned.
[49:22] Not you're not going to be popular.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; You're not even going to. And I don't
[49:26] care about being popular, but I'm just
[49:28] telling you what's going to happen. But
[49:31] we better be sure and know that we know
[49:33] him
[49:35] &gt;&gt; because there's going to look things
[49:36] that can look real reasonable and real
[49:39] very very right and very reasonable that
[49:41] we should yield to because this one said
[49:43] it and they're close friends. They're
[49:45] good people.
[49:47] But we better be careful that we don't
[49:49] turn around and leave that word.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember those two spirits will be
[49:55] really close. They're both anointed, two
[49:58] spirits, but both anointed by the Holy
[50:01] Ghost.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. Because
[50:06] there's one spirit that's of the devil
[50:09] &gt;&gt; and the other spirits of God.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those two spirits, one's Satan and
[50:15] one isn't.
[50:17] Is that right? All right. They can be so
[50:20] close together because they're both
[50:21] anointed. The bride's anointed. We know
[50:23] that. We believe in the anointing. The
[50:26] anointing was sent for one thing though.
[50:28] That's to quicken the seed gene that he
[50:30] put in your soul.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; You know, it wasn't until after the
[50:35] seals opened that brother Brandham said
[50:37] anything about gene.
[50:40] A gene gene of God. That's right. But
[50:43] now he opened it up. See, now we're
[50:47] coming. Why? Because the book But the
[50:49] book's been opened. It was in a
[50:50] three-fold manner. First he come then he
[50:53] then he come into his son to give
[50:55] redemption. Then he come from his son
[50:57] into his people and now preparing the
[51:00] people for the for Eden. Amen. It's
[51:04] perfect.
[51:05] Amen. So here we are. Where are we
[51:08] standing? And we're 60 years beyond he
[51:11] in 1212. 1212 and 12 days later the
[51:14] prophet left. 1212 he preached
[51:16] communion.
[51:19] 65
[51:21] and here we are 60 years. We just passed
[51:23] 1212. 312s there. Amen. 12 days later he
[51:28] went in a car accident.
[51:33] Those things don't happen by chance. In
[51:34] fact, there's nothing for you as a as a
[51:37] bride, born again bride. There's nothing
[51:39] can happen by chance.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; God has ordered it. God has ordained it.
[51:45] Now, we're coming into this. I want to
[51:46] read something here because I know my
[51:49] time is very limited tonight. I want to
[51:52] read brother Brandham. He had two he
[51:54] made two wedding ceremonies and he and
[51:56] they recorded both of them. But I'm
[51:58] going to read a wedding ceremony here to
[52:00] you and I want you to look at it not
[52:02] only between you and your husband which
[52:04] is true because brother bre because
[52:08] remember Paul took the husband and the
[52:10] wife
[52:12] and used it
[52:14] representing the bride and the groom.
[52:16] Ephesians 5. All right. So he was typing
[52:20] it and and the marriage the marriage
[52:22] between a husband and wife ought to type
[52:25] that scripturally.
[52:27] Amen. Ought to be a a natural type.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; If your life isn't being lived that way,
[52:34] there's something wrong. So line up with
[52:36] the word.
[52:38] All right. Now, so we come back to here
[52:40] and I'm going to read this and keep in
[52:42] mind that this is not only between a
[52:44] husband and wife, but this between you
[52:45] and the Christ
[52:48] because this is what this is what it is.
[52:52] But duly believing you have considered
[52:54] this solemn obligation you are about to
[52:57] assume and that you have you have
[52:59] prepared to enter upon the same
[53:02] reverently, discreetly, soberly in the
[53:05] fear of God. I shall propose to you the
[53:08] marriage covenant.
[53:10] You will witness the same as you join
[53:13] your right hands together. Will you have
[53:16] this woman, speaking to the man, will
[53:18] you have this woman to be your lawful
[53:20] wedded wife to live together in this
[53:24] holy state of matrimony? Do you promise
[53:27] to love and honor? Love her, honor her,
[53:31] cherish her, and support her in sickness
[53:33] and health, riches or poverty, and will
[53:36] forsake all others as long as you both
[53:39] live? The groom answers, "I will."
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Our bridegroom has answered,
[53:46] &gt;&gt; "I will."
[53:50] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, will you have, speaking
[53:54] to the woman, speaking to the lady, will
[53:56] you have this man to be your lawful
[53:58] wedded husband
[54:00] to live together in this holy state of
[54:04] matrimony? Do you promise to love him,
[54:07] honor him, and cherish him and support
[54:10] him in sickness or health, riches or
[54:13] poverty, and cleave thee only unto him
[54:16] as long as you both live?
[54:19] The bride answers,
[54:21] I will.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Now, you've made a vow.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; What man, what God joins together, let
[54:32] no man put us under.
[54:37] Can you imagine something coming in
[54:39] between? Brother Brandon brought this
[54:41] many many times. You cannot mix your
[54:43] union with him. Mix it with other
[54:45] things.
[54:47] It's not a mix. You either submitted
[54:49] completely to him or you aren't
[54:51] submitted to him in everything. You must
[54:54] give him headship.
[54:58] He has the headship.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we look at the word submission.
[55:04] Let's look at this just a minute.
[55:07] Submission is the act or fact of
[55:09] accepting or yielding to a superior
[55:11] force or to the will or or authority of
[55:15] another person.
[55:18] Submit means to yield, resign, or
[55:22] surrender to the power, will or
[55:24] authority of another.
[55:27] And I'm going to stop right there
[55:28] because I'm going to read Ephesians just
[55:30] a minute here. But let's go back here
[55:32] just and we so we see here that you will
[55:37] cleave. He will cleave has no other. She
[55:40] will have no other. Nothing
[55:44] can come between you.
[55:48] Amen. If it does, if it tries to
[55:51] separate you or separate you and God,
[55:54] it's another spirit.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the same thing between a
[56:00] man and woman.
[56:02] She's commanded to submit herself to her
[56:05] husband, and the husband is commanded to
[56:08] keep himself only to her and to love her
[56:11] and cherish her.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Women say, "Well, what if he doesn't
[56:16] believe the way I do? What if this? What
[56:17] if that?" As long as he doesn't tell you
[56:20] to go contrary to that word, you are to
[56:22] surrender yourself to him and serve him,
[56:26] &gt;&gt; whether you like him or don't.
[56:29] Whether you like his actions or don't,
[56:31] that's what I'm talking about. Unless he
[56:33] tells you, he may be an outright
[56:35] unbeliever
[56:38] and something then tells you to separate
[56:40] from him. That is of the devil.
[56:44] Unless he calls you to make you to do
[56:46] things contrary to the word, won't let
[56:48] you read the word, hear the word, makes
[56:50] you dress something contrary to the
[56:51] word, then the Lord is your head over
[56:53] him. But until that time, you're not to
[56:56] keep yourself from him. You're to give
[56:58] yourself to him and let nothing come
[57:00] between you.
[57:04] I don't care what it is.
[57:07] If it's job, if it's family, if it's
[57:09] children, I don't care what it is.
[57:10] Nothing can come between you and your
[57:12] wife or your husband.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[57:16] And if it does, then Satan's using that
[57:19] to get you off of what he's told you to
[57:22] do in the word. Pretty
[57:27] strong, isn't it? But I wasn't sent to
[57:30] make it simple or easy. I mean, my I'm
[57:34] I'm speaking before our pastor.
[57:37] I have to do what I'm called to do. And
[57:40] I know you know that
[57:43] if it leaves the word, then I'm then I'm
[57:45] have then you have a right to rebuke me
[57:47] if it leaves this word.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. Then we must submit ourselves to
[57:54] the word. This word is your husband,
[57:57] bride. Isaiah 54:5 said, "God is your
[58:01] husband."
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:06] Okay. I'm good. I'm, you know, I'm kind
[58:09] of glad this is not a Wednesday night.
[58:14] All right. Now, oh, he said, "The
[58:17] sweetness of wedlock. A man and a woman
[58:19] has been joined together to face life
[58:21] journey." in its ups and downs.
[58:24] Therefore, they are no more twain, but
[58:26] one flesh, what therefore God had joined
[58:28] together. Let not man put us under.
[58:41] So, we read that wedding ceremony. Let's
[58:44] let's go over here and I want to I want
[58:46] to read another scripture just before I
[58:49] read here. What I want to get into
[58:52] in in Ephesians.
[59:04] Ephesians 5
[59:06] verse 22
[59:11] starting with verse 22. Wives, submit
[59:15] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[59:17] unto the Lord.
[59:20] As unto the Lord.
[59:24] Would you let something If you let
[59:26] something get you between you and the
[59:28] Lord, even if it's your own thinking,
[59:31] reasoning, feelings, come between you
[59:34] and God, you're flirting with the devil.
[59:38] Amen. You can't let anything come
[59:40] between you and the word. You say,
[59:43] "Well, aren't we able to?" Yeah, you'll
[59:45] have mistakes, but one thing about the
[59:46] Holy Ghost, he'll show you it's wrong
[59:49] &gt;&gt; and you'll make correction.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; All right. Then then we must come under
[59:59] the headship of the word in everything.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; That's why God calls for a total
[1:00:05] separation from unbelief.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Anything prophesy, go to the message. Go
[1:00:12] back in what he said. Anything or anyone
[1:00:14] or anything that comes between you and
[1:00:16] God,
[1:00:19] Amen. You're to separate from that
[1:00:21] unbelief.
[1:00:26] All right.
[1:00:29] He said now, so reading on, he said
[1:00:31] verse 23, for the husband is the head of
[1:00:33] the wife, even as Christ is the head of
[1:00:37] the church. That's the bride. That's the
[1:00:40] wife. He is the savior of the body.
[1:00:44] Therefore, as the church is submitted
[1:00:46] unto Christ, so let the wives be to
[1:00:48] their own husbands in everything.
[1:00:55] Husbands, love your wives even as Christ
[1:00:57] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:01:00] for it. Now, husbands, here's what you
[1:01:02] do.
[1:01:03] You die to yourself.
[1:01:06] Let go of self. Don't let your your
[1:01:10] Don't let anything come between you and
[1:01:11] your wife.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You must keep that union open,
[1:01:17] that communion open.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; And the wife listen remember I read I
[1:01:23] read something here just when I was
[1:01:25] while brother was gone and I read back.
[1:01:28] He said and we have it I have it here
[1:01:30] tonight. And the question is why can't I
[1:01:32] surrender to the Holy Spirit?
[1:01:35] And brother Bram said, he said, "Do I
[1:01:37] have a devil?" A woman was asking,
[1:01:39] asking, "Why can't I surrender to
[1:01:41] Christ?" I may read that again tonight,
[1:01:43] Lord willing, if I can before I leave
[1:01:45] here because he she he said it very
[1:01:49] clear.
[1:01:51] Amen. So, so
[1:01:57] the headship and the body.
[1:02:00] Okay, I won't I won't go there yet.
[1:02:02] Let's keep reading.
[1:02:04] Husbands, love your wives even as Christ
[1:02:06] loved the church and gave himself for
[1:02:08] it. What did he say to do? Honor your
[1:02:10] wife as a weaker vessel. Giving honor to
[1:02:13] your wife as a weaker vessel. You say,
[1:02:16] "What do you mean by that?" Because she
[1:02:17] was deceived in the beginning, the
[1:02:19] woman.
[1:02:21] And she's a weaker vessel. But you being
[1:02:24] a stronger vessel, you don't just run
[1:02:26] her down. She's more able to make
[1:02:27] mistakes and failures. But you need to
[1:02:30] give yourself for her, right?
[1:02:35] And you ought to be respected. If you're
[1:02:36] not a respect, I and I and I just come
[1:02:39] right back. I've been through this too
[1:02:41] many times. I've heard wives come up,
[1:02:42] well, I'm more spiritual than my husband
[1:02:44] or well, this or that, or well, he he he
[1:02:47] doesn't treat me right.
[1:02:52] In what way?
[1:02:54] If he tells you to do something that's
[1:02:55] not as off the word, see,
[1:02:59] then the Lord is your husband ahead of
[1:03:02] him. But if he doesn't, you may not like
[1:03:04] the way he does. You may not like his
[1:03:06] decisions, but you need to pray for your
[1:03:09] husband and obey him and serve him.
[1:03:15] These are hard words, aren't they?
[1:03:18] Hard to swallow,
[1:03:20] but it's the truth. Okay. Now that he
[1:03:25] that he now it's the same as Christ. He
[1:03:27] may remember Paul's bringing this down
[1:03:29] through husband and wife showing the
[1:03:30] love between the the the Christ and his
[1:03:33] bride. That he might sanctify and
[1:03:35] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[1:03:37] by the word that he might present it to
[1:03:40] himself a glorious church, not having
[1:03:43] spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but
[1:03:45] that it should be holy and without
[1:03:47] blemish.
[1:03:49] Listen.
[1:03:51] So ought men to love their wives as
[1:03:53] their own bodies. He that loveth his
[1:03:56] wife loveth himself.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Who are you in his eyes? Himself.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; You had your way. You had your your
[1:04:06] time. You had your house. You've had
[1:04:08] your property. You had your money and
[1:04:10] everything. But now you're married.
[1:04:13] Now you have a head
[1:04:17] and you submit yourself to that head.
[1:04:24] Amen. In everything,
[1:04:35] wives,
[1:04:38] what is submit? To yield, resign, or
[1:04:41] surrender to the power, will or
[1:04:43] authority of another. Wives, submit
[1:04:47] yourselves to your own husbands.
[1:04:48] Ephesians 5. To be subject, that means
[1:04:51] to be subject to to acquisense in the
[1:04:54] authority in in the authority of him
[1:05:01] to thy to acquiscent to the to thy
[1:05:03] husband's will to be submissive to yield
[1:05:06] without murmuring.
[1:05:11] Amen. That's submission.
[1:05:16] What good is it going to do when you
[1:05:17] know God has control of you and you
[1:05:19] surrender? And I'm coming to that right
[1:05:21] now. I want to finish with that. When
[1:05:23] you surrender to him, give him total
[1:05:27] control.
[1:05:30] Amen. See, you think, well, I can't give
[1:05:32] my husband total. Why can't you? The
[1:05:34] Bible said you should.
[1:05:36] Well, I can't. Then you haven't
[1:05:38] submitted yourself as the word said.
[1:05:40] You're not giving the word headship. Why
[1:05:42] don't you do that and watch what God
[1:05:43] does?
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. Watch what God does. He'll
[1:05:53] honor that. Amen. Exactly what he'll do.
[1:05:57] I've had him say, "I just can't." You
[1:05:59] know, he this I said, "Just serve him.
[1:06:02] You're to serve him. You're not to
[1:06:04] withhold yourself from him. You're to
[1:06:05] serve him."
[1:06:10] Amen. And if something comes between you
[1:06:13] and your husband and serving, it's not
[1:06:15] God doing it.
[1:06:19] And you need to you need to just lay it
[1:06:22] right down and say, "This is what I
[1:06:23] believe. Nothing going to come between
[1:06:25] me and my husband. We're living
[1:06:27] together. We're going to continue to
[1:06:28] live together."
[1:06:34] Now, listen, it's just us. We're family
[1:06:36] here tonight. We ought to speak to
[1:06:38] family just like that. And it shouldn't
[1:06:40] offend anybody
[1:06:43] because I'm bringing to you the word. If
[1:06:45] the word offends you, you've got a
[1:06:46] problem.
[1:06:49] We all have a problem. I have a problem.
[1:06:51] If the word offend me, and we're going
[1:06:53] to preach the truth, and I'm going to
[1:06:54] tell you right now, the truth will
[1:06:56] offend people.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; But I'm not out here to offend them
[1:07:02] purposely, but to bring the truth.
[1:07:05] Listen, this bride has the truth, and
[1:07:07] she will prophesy. She's not afraid to
[1:07:10] speak it.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Well, somebody might think this and
[1:07:16] might think that. Then you're putting
[1:07:17] what they think between you and God,
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Boy, that was good.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; That's good for all of us.
[1:07:28] You can't let anything come between.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; When God joined you two together, he
[1:07:33] didn't expect anything to come between.
[1:07:35] And if it come between you need to take
[1:07:37] authority over it and say you're not
[1:07:40] going to do it.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:07:49] Now let me see how I can quickly Okay.
[1:07:52] Let's finish this. 29.
[1:07:57] For no man ever yet hated his own flesh,
[1:08:00] but nourisheth it and cherisheth it even
[1:08:02] as the Lord the church. You remember how
[1:08:05] that old drunk come in? He said, "I know
[1:08:07] somebody that won't see I know somebody
[1:08:09] that love me. I remember he come like
[1:08:11] drink like he drank and threw the eggs
[1:08:13] on the floor and everything else." And
[1:08:15] she just kept saying, "Oh, must Jesus
[1:08:17] bear the cross alone?"
[1:08:20] She still served her husband. Even
[1:08:22] though he was a drunk, he still served
[1:08:24] her husband.
[1:08:27] Listen, I could tell you story after
[1:08:29] story and I know what I'm talking about
[1:08:31] by experience. If you'll just be you'll
[1:08:34] serve him.
[1:08:36] I don't care if he's the darkest sinner.
[1:08:38] He doesn't believe what you believe.
[1:08:41] Amen. You still serve him.
[1:08:45] That's right. You still serve him. He I
[1:08:47] don't agree with what he does. Who would
[1:08:49] you hear that from? What makes you
[1:08:50] disagree with what he's doing?
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Where are you getting your inspiration
[1:08:56] from?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; That would even come between
[1:09:04] you and your husband
[1:09:06] or husband and wife whichever it is
[1:09:09] anything.
[1:09:16] Okay.
[1:09:22] So
[1:09:24] there's a submission.
[1:09:28] I just gave you the definition of
[1:09:31] submission.
[1:09:38] So let no man put us under. Okay. Now
[1:09:43] in Isaiah 22:22,
[1:09:45] I want to go to the house key of the
[1:09:47] house of David. And this is Isaiah
[1:09:50] 22:22. And the key of the house of David
[1:09:53] will I lay upon his shoulder.
[1:09:56] So he shall open and none shall shut.
[1:09:59] and he shall shut and none shall open.
[1:10:04] And the Bible said, continue reading
[1:10:06] here in Ephesians,
[1:10:08] he said, "For every, for we are members
[1:10:11] of his body, of his flesh." Paul's
[1:10:13] speaking of the the bride. We are
[1:10:15] members of Christ's body, of his flesh,
[1:10:17] and of his bones. For this cause, you
[1:10:20] know what the bride is? The bride is the
[1:10:22] flesh and bones of Christ. Did you know
[1:10:24] that? That's the bride.
[1:10:29] Amen.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. She is the flesh and bones. We
[1:10:33] are He said like he said we are the
[1:10:35] flesh and bones of Christ. That is his
[1:10:38] bride. That's a quote. That is his
[1:10:41] bride.
[1:10:43] Okay.
[1:10:44] So Paul's saying, "For we are members of
[1:10:47] his body and of his flesh and of his
[1:10:49] bones. For this cause shall a man leave
[1:10:50] his father and mother and shall be
[1:10:52] joined unto his wife, and they too shall
[1:10:55] be one flesh." This is a great mystery
[1:10:58] but I speak concerning Christ and the
[1:11:00] church.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; So where's the reflection of this? What
[1:11:05] did Paul use? What about the body of
[1:11:07] Christ? What did he use to represent the
[1:11:10] body member members of the body?
[1:11:14] 1 Corinthians 12. He used the flesh
[1:11:16] physical body. Every part had their part
[1:11:19] to play. But they're all united to one
[1:11:21] head.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. See? So, so here we
[1:11:27] go. Now, let's go back here to this key
[1:11:30] of David.
[1:11:32] Let's read it out of out of I want to
[1:11:35] read it out of Revelations 3:7,
[1:11:38] too, because this is this is where
[1:11:40] Brother Bram speaks of it in the church
[1:11:42] age book.
[1:11:45] And this comes this is this is the
[1:11:47] scripture he's referring to.
[1:11:50] Revelations 3:7.
[1:11:55] And he said unto the angel of the church
[1:11:57] in Philadelphia, write these things
[1:12:00] saith he that is holy. He that is true.
[1:12:04] He that hath the key of David. He that
[1:12:08] openeth and no man shutth and shutth and
[1:12:11] no man openeth. Now there was an open
[1:12:14] door here at the end of that age. Amen.
[1:12:17] And that was that was and that was
[1:12:19] followed up. God opened the door of the
[1:12:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:12:23] restoration of the gifts.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? Yeah.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; But we realize and brother Brandham said
[1:12:30] on the message on on the on the on the
[1:12:33] on his things that are to be he said the
[1:12:37] real gift he said you can be baptized
[1:12:40] with the Holy Ghost and we all need to
[1:12:42] be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; because without the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:46] Ghost there's no birth
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; because but the Holy Ghost baptism was
[1:12:50] sent to quicken the seed and that was
[1:12:52] the open door here. There's an open door
[1:12:55] made for you.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; That was the beginning of the Leoian
[1:12:59] age. The message of the seventh angel,
[1:13:01] message of the opening of the seals came
[1:13:03] at the end of the seventh age.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; So there was there was though so he made
[1:13:09] a way and brother Brandham said we can't
[1:13:12] preach the we don't the the I won't well
[1:13:15] I won't go there because I want to I
[1:13:16] want to go into another message on that.
[1:13:18] So anyway,
[1:13:22] so we see then that it made way for the
[1:13:24] Holy Ghost himself. Remember Pentecost
[1:13:27] was still under reformation.
[1:13:31] The message of the seventh angel,
[1:13:32] opening of the seals, the third pull is
[1:13:35] the eagle.
[1:13:37] Amen. See, because this this secret had
[1:13:41] to be known. So I don't want to go any
[1:13:42] further than that because I want to
[1:13:44] teach the point here. But going back to
[1:13:46] the house of David, he said this is what
[1:13:49] the prophet said about this.
[1:13:53] So I he said the key is laid on his
[1:13:56] shoulder. So he shall open and none
[1:13:58] shall shut and he shall shut and none
[1:14:00] shall open. Other words, he has the
[1:14:03] headship.
[1:14:05] The spirit uses this Old Testament
[1:14:07] reference concerning the Lord Jesus
[1:14:09] Christ and his ministry in the church.
[1:14:15] What the key of David signified at that
[1:14:17] time is mere shadow which is now
[1:14:20] fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst
[1:14:23] of the lampstands. It has to do with the
[1:14:25] our Lord after his resurrection and not
[1:14:28] his earthly pilgrimage. But what does
[1:14:30] the key signify? The answer to that is
[1:14:34] in the position of the key.
[1:14:38] All right. It's not in his hand. It's
[1:14:41] not worn around his neck. is not placed
[1:14:44] in the hands of other men or the verse
[1:14:48] would could not be saying that he alone
[1:14:50] has the use of that key
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; for he alone opens and shuts
[1:14:56] and no man has that right but Jesus
[1:14:59] himself isn't that right but where is
[1:15:02] the key it is on his shoulder
[1:15:06] but what does shoulder have to do with
[1:15:08] it so we could go to read Isaiah 9:6 the
[1:15:11] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:15:13] shoulder.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is so see so the government I I
[1:15:18] you could read Isaiah 9:6. I won't take
[1:15:21] time with that tonight. But the
[1:15:22] government shall be upon the government.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Shall be upon his shoulder.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; But what does this mean? The answer, the
[1:15:32] phrase the government upon his shoulder
[1:15:35] comes from the wedding ceremony
[1:15:38] of the east.
[1:15:42] So now we see that the government upon
[1:15:44] the shoulder comes from a wedding
[1:15:46] ceremony
[1:15:48] and we've had a wedding ceremony.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; I could go back to par proving his word.
[1:15:58] You know the quote. He said the marriage
[1:16:00] is now and the rapture is going to the
[1:16:02] wedding supper.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; I could go to a lot more in that. But
[1:16:06] the but the ministry of the son of man
[1:16:08] himself unites the two together. God
[1:16:11] steps down in flesh and we saw him do
[1:16:13] it.
[1:16:15] Amen. And it caught our attention to
[1:16:18] what the voice that followed the second
[1:16:20] pull.
[1:16:24] All right. Now, so we know the third
[1:16:27] pull is the opening of that mystery in
[1:16:29] you. It's the opening of the book. It's
[1:16:31] the opening of the word.
[1:16:34] Okay. Now so not to save time here so
[1:16:38] the so it's from the comes in the
[1:16:41] wedding ceremony of the east when the
[1:16:43] bride has been committed to the groom
[1:16:45] that word committed is he is meaning
[1:16:48] that he she's given herself over
[1:16:51] completely in the face of witnesses and
[1:16:54] declaring I'm his wife
[1:16:59] that's being committed
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; okay so she has taken that vow she
[1:17:04] promised that he she would be faithful
[1:17:06] to him and him only.
[1:17:10] Okay. Then what's happening here? So she
[1:17:14] takes when the bride has been committed
[1:17:16] to the groom, she takes off.
[1:17:20] Now there was something here. Give me
[1:17:23] just a minute. Let me look here.
[1:17:26] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I was going to read.
[1:17:29] Oh yeah. Okay. Let me just Well, I won't
[1:17:31] interject that yet. If I have time, I
[1:17:33] will. Okay.
[1:17:35] Now,
[1:17:38] when she's committed to the groom, she
[1:17:40] takes off her veil.
[1:17:44] Now, this is a powerful thing here.
[1:17:46] Don't take it lightly
[1:17:49] because this is very important.
[1:17:54] When the bride has been committed to the
[1:17:56] groom, she takes off her veil and places
[1:17:59] it over the groom's shoulders.
[1:18:03] signifying that not only is she under
[1:18:07] his dominion,
[1:18:09] she has transferred her rights to him,
[1:18:12] that he is the head.
[1:18:19] Now, she come into that marriage with a
[1:18:21] lot of rights,
[1:18:23] but when she marries, she turns those
[1:18:25] rights to her husband.
[1:18:29] She comes under his authority.
[1:18:32] If you don't believe then then why did
[1:18:34] you marry him and why did you marry her
[1:18:37] if you won't keep your vow?
[1:18:43] Amen. That goes with every bit of us. I
[1:18:45] mean brother sister happening everywhere
[1:18:48] even among the message.
[1:18:52] Amen. In fact where the two come so
[1:18:55] close you can't it's unless you have the
[1:18:58] Holy Ghost you wouldn't be able to
[1:18:59] discern. They would deceive you, those
[1:19:01] two spirits, because why? They're both
[1:19:04] anointed, can be anointed with the same
[1:19:06] Holy Ghost. But one will bring the word
[1:19:09] for the season where the other can't see
[1:19:11] it.
[1:19:12] But both
[1:19:15] being anointed by the same Holy Ghost,
[1:19:19] what are you going to stay with?
[1:19:22] See how close those two can come.
[1:19:28] Amen. We are to stay with this word.
[1:19:33] I here again. It doesn't matter how nice
[1:19:36] how the person is. They've been friends
[1:19:38] for years. I don't know what it is, but
[1:19:41] you are to stay with that word. His
[1:19:43] perfect will is his word.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Many now there many that have the word,
[1:19:49] but they have no oil.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; But those that have the word have the
[1:19:53] oil. Right?
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; And the word becomes a living word. It
[1:19:57] becomes the thought underneath that word
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; manifested.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Everybody has the rema. Everybody claims
[1:20:05] to believe it. Foolish virgin claimed
[1:20:07] they had the lamp but they didn't have
[1:20:09] oil in their vessel.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; But the but the wise virgin had oil in
[1:20:14] their vessel
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; with their lamp or their lamp with oil
[1:20:18] in their vessel.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; There's the only difference. Right.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Both sanctified people.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; We're coming down very close here.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Where don't you turn? The enemy going to
[1:20:33] make it look very easy to make a turn
[1:20:36] here. But you but the Holy Ghost in you
[1:20:39] is the only one that's going to zone.
[1:20:41] Otherwise, you're going to yield back to
[1:20:43] what somebody else said. You're going to
[1:20:44] yield back to your own reasoning and
[1:20:46] your own thinking of it. And there's
[1:20:48] where you go off the line.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:52] Amen.
[1:20:55] All right. So, watch.
[1:20:58] Laying that over her veil. Watch. You've
[1:21:01] got to lay your veil on his shoulders.
[1:21:04] Brother, sister, bride, me, you. It
[1:21:06] ought to be a laying of her veil on his
[1:21:08] shoulders and leave it there.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:13] because you're signifying that not only
[1:21:15] is she under that she's under his domain
[1:21:18] dominion that she has transferred her
[1:21:20] rights to him that he is the head but
[1:21:22] also that he bears the responsibility.
[1:21:25] Okay, husbands, you bear the
[1:21:27] responsibility. You're going to answer
[1:21:29] for what you do to that wife.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's you're going to answer for
[1:21:35] that.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Yeah.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; She'll never answer for you, but you
[1:21:42] will answer. She'll answer for her own
[1:21:44] affairs.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't correct her and bring
[1:21:48] her back to the word and she refuses to
[1:21:50] listen to correction, she will answer
[1:21:52] for it
[1:21:54] because you are husband. Me, every man
[1:21:57] in here that's married is a husbandman
[1:22:00] to his home.
[1:22:07] And we ought to be very careful. But we
[1:22:09] ought to be watchmen.
[1:22:12] Amen. A husbandman is the care you. Our
[1:22:16] brother Paul here is a husbandman.
[1:22:19] He controls a farm. You plant. You you
[1:22:23] reap. You're the planter. You're the
[1:22:25] husbandman of that of that whole field
[1:22:29] or fields.
[1:22:31] Amen.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; So is a husband
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; of over his home, over his family.
[1:22:39] And when the wife tries to raise up and
[1:22:41] take authority over that, there's
[1:22:43] another spirit. And the Bible said it's
[1:22:45] a Catholic spirit.
[1:22:50] It's a dominating female spirit that
[1:22:53] wants to dominate. And brother Bram
[1:22:55] said, "Any real woman will want to be
[1:22:58] under the authority of the man."
[1:23:03] My go back to thyroid age and see what
[1:23:05] he said.
[1:23:08] I'm not saying anybody here has that
[1:23:10] spirit. I'm saying that's what's trying
[1:23:12] to anoint
[1:23:15] me, you, or anybody. And we face it
[1:23:17] every day. Don't worry. That devil tries
[1:23:19] to come in in any way he can to try to
[1:23:21] upset your complete your complete
[1:23:24] submission and your complete giving over
[1:23:26] to that word every day.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going to battle you. You're
[1:23:32] going to face struggles. You're going to
[1:23:34] face trials. You're going to face people
[1:23:35] that don't like you. They're going to
[1:23:37] face people that even message believers
[1:23:39] say, "And listen, those cousins, don't
[1:23:41] think for a minute that that little
[1:23:43] woman down there, that little washer
[1:23:45] woman that said yes to marry that boy."
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. If they didn't say, "Listen, now
[1:23:50] you know better. Those seals aren't
[1:23:52] open, that seven seals not open."
[1:23:56] What makes you think it's open?
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Because he's unveiled himself to me.
[1:24:00] That's how I know it's open. and his
[1:24:02] unveiling to me has brought me to my
[1:24:04] position.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right.
[1:24:12] That's where it lays right there.
[1:24:15] Are we going to come under the headship
[1:24:17] of the word? Are we going to come under
[1:24:19] the headship of oursel?
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Remember what I said. You lift up
[1:24:23] yourself. Quit. Don't try to lift up the
[1:24:25] idol of yourself. You lift up yourself,
[1:24:27] it's an idol.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:32] Lean not to your own understanding, but
[1:24:34] in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he
[1:24:36] shall direct thy path.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Put him first. He'll take care of the
[1:24:40] rest of it. Put the word first. Put
[1:24:43] prayer first. Give time for the word.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. I'm telling, you may
[1:24:50] not like the way I preach it, but I'm
[1:24:52] not responsible for whether you like it
[1:24:54] or not. I'm responsible for telling it.
[1:24:57] Amen.
[1:25:00] I may be an old German. I may be a
[1:25:02] German shepherd. I don't know. But I'm a
[1:25:04] German and I may have to be German. But
[1:25:06] God made me that way. And I'm going to
[1:25:08] lay out the word because I love you and
[1:25:10] I don't despise any of you. I'm not
[1:25:12] against any of you. I want you to see
[1:25:14] line up with the word.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; And I know that's my pastor's heart.
[1:25:23] That's our pastor's soul. Line up with
[1:25:25] the word. He'd been preaching it. He
[1:25:27] preached Sunday. Line up with the word.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Listen, there's going to be things come
[1:25:37] up be very reason going to twick your
[1:25:40] reasoning. Be careful.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; The devil's a slicker.
[1:25:45] But you better depend on that Holy Ghost
[1:25:47] in you. You better lay your veil on his
[1:25:49] shoulders.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; This is what the Holy Spirit's driving
[1:25:55] us to right here. lay the veil on his
[1:25:57] shoulders.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; The key is complete submission. That's
[1:26:01] the key to going in a rapture is you've
[1:26:03] got to lay your veil on that shoulders
[1:26:06] and give him the right that's due him.
[1:26:08] Give him the responsibility that he
[1:26:10] wants to take. Watch what he says now
[1:26:12] close. He said watch. He said he said he
[1:26:16] gives she gives she transfers has
[1:26:18] transferred her rights to him that he is
[1:26:21] the head also that he bears the
[1:26:23] responsibility and the care and that he
[1:26:25] and he alone no one else no other man no
[1:26:30] other power has any right and
[1:26:33] responsibility but him
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; and that beloved is the key of David
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; He answers it right there. There is your
[1:26:46] key.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; In the home, who gives the right to her
[1:26:51] husband? The wife.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; She can say yes or no. Is that right?
[1:26:57] I'm not talking just sexually. I'm
[1:26:59] talking about
[1:27:00] the right to her husband. If she doesn't
[1:27:02] give him that right, he can't force
[1:27:05] himself on her.
[1:27:08] Amen. And if a wife's not refu if the
[1:27:11] wife refuses to submit to her husband,
[1:27:14] then he might as well go live a private
[1:27:16] life.
[1:27:19] Amen. If the husband abuses the wife and
[1:27:22] she can't live and won't let her go to
[1:27:24] church, won't let him see. And and
[1:27:26] brother Brandham said, if she leaves or
[1:27:28] if he leaves, don't you go out and
[1:27:29] remarry. Don't you go out and do
[1:27:31] anything. You just go out and serve the
[1:27:33] Lord the best you can and let him take
[1:27:35] care of it.
[1:27:37] You've got to just yield yourself and
[1:27:41] come under the headship of the word. If
[1:27:42] you won't do that, there's another
[1:27:44] spirit in you. You're not discerning the
[1:27:47] the words of God here.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Okay? So he said,
[1:27:55] so he that beloved is the key of David.
[1:27:57] God being sovereign, he fornewed by
[1:27:59] divine decree exactly who would be his
[1:28:01] bride. He chose her. She did not choose
[1:28:03] him. He called her. She did not come on
[1:28:06] her own and he died for her. He washed
[1:28:08] her in his own blood. He paid the price
[1:28:10] for her. She belongs to him and to him
[1:28:13] alone.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; She is wholly committed. She has vowed
[1:28:19] that she would be faithful to him alone.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; All right. She is wholly committed to
[1:28:30] him and he accepts the obligation. And
[1:28:32] he accepts the obligation. Thanks be to
[1:28:35] God. I'm so glad that he's accepted the
[1:28:37] obligation.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; You can rest in that.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; You can yield, completely yield. You may
[1:28:44] not understand how he's leading. You may
[1:28:46] not understand how he's doing it, but
[1:28:48] your trust is in him. And he said he
[1:28:51] would keep those in perfect peace who
[1:28:54] who kept their mind centered on him
[1:28:57] because they trusted in him.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Love is trust.
[1:29:07] Amen. And he may he may do he may
[1:29:09] brother sister the husband may do things
[1:29:12] that you say I don't agree with that I
[1:29:14] do agree with that whether you agree
[1:29:15] with it or not
[1:29:17] as long as it's not leading it off the
[1:29:20] word then serve him.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; We don't understand I understand
[1:29:27] everything. We're not even meant to
[1:29:29] understand the way the shepherd leads us
[1:29:30] or way my our husband leads us. the word
[1:29:33] leads us. It's not my business to know
[1:29:35] that I trust him. I've given myself to
[1:29:37] him and I'm resting. No matter what
[1:29:40] state I'm in, where I'm at, I can
[1:29:41] therewith be content because he's
[1:29:44] leading me.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; I don't have to figure out how he's
[1:29:48] doing it, he's doing it.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; I've laid my veil on his shoulders.
[1:29:55] And for you to do that as a as a wife
[1:29:58] serves her husband, Brother Bam said she
[1:30:00] is serving God.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; That's pretty.
[1:30:07] You've got a husband, you serve him. God
[1:30:10] looks at it as his your service and you
[1:30:13] have a ministry. And what's keeping you
[1:30:15] out of your ministry then?
[1:30:18] You have a ministry that's just as great
[1:30:20] as a prophet or apostle or any other
[1:30:22] five-fold ministry. Your ministry is
[1:30:25] that important. Every day you serve your
[1:30:27] husband. You take care of him. You you
[1:30:29] take care of his clothes. You you take
[1:30:31] care of the house under the headship of
[1:30:33] your husband.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother David, you're just back in
[1:30:40] the old times. No, I'm not. This is
[1:30:42] beyond your natural way of thinking and
[1:30:44] being a ruler. This is coming down to
[1:30:47] different. This is a revelation, and I'm
[1:30:49] trying to bring you that revelation
[1:30:50] right here. And our marriages ought to
[1:30:52] reflect this.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Spiritually, not. It's not, "Well, bless
[1:30:58] God. I'll bear that stick and pound her
[1:31:01] over the head." No, no, no. That's not
[1:31:03] even scriptural. You husband try to do
[1:31:04] that. You're out of your place.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:31:15] Amen. Where's the harmony? And don't
[1:31:18] tell me you don't affect this church.
[1:31:21] When your family is out of cater, you
[1:31:23] are affecting the church.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Every every if it's a healthy family, it
[1:31:29] could be a healthy church depending on
[1:31:31] the health of the family.
[1:31:39] You want to see moving of God, then get
[1:31:41] your family in order. Get your children
[1:31:44] in order.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. put the you you you you
[1:31:51] say I don't well they I can't love is
[1:31:53] corrective then when they're doing
[1:31:56] things and you let them just go out
[1:31:57] there and want brother sister you ought
[1:31:59] to be have you ought to be giving
[1:32:00] yourself for your children training them
[1:32:03] training them training them
[1:32:08] not not to go off the train them to the
[1:32:11] word bring your homes under the word
[1:32:17] amen They're going to grow up. They're
[1:32:20] gonna grow up being what you that you've
[1:32:22] influenced them to be.
[1:32:30] Time's up.
[1:32:35] What is it? Full surrender to God.
[1:32:38] That's what it takes. A complete
[1:32:40] surrender. God wants a surrender. How
[1:32:42] can you show How can God show you
[1:32:44] realities before you surrender yourself
[1:32:46] to him? You've got to surrender.
[1:32:49] To make a complete surrender, we cannot
[1:32:52] use one ability, human ability. You say,
[1:32:54] "I got the ability to do it." God
[1:32:56] doesn't need it. He needs you to submit
[1:32:58] your ability and let go of it and let
[1:33:00] God do with it.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Not you coming up thinking, "I've got
[1:33:04] the ability. I've been trained to do
[1:33:05] this." Brother Brham said, "God doesn't
[1:33:07] need it."
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; We've got to master, if we ever master
[1:33:11] anything, we ought to master the very
[1:33:13] thought of human ability.
[1:33:17] Same goes with husband. Same goes with
[1:33:19] wife. Amen. Put it in God's hands. Rely
[1:33:22] on God and keep his word and do what the
[1:33:24] word said for you to do and break this
[1:33:28] influence that's causing you to run the
[1:33:30] other way.
[1:33:36] Maybe I won't get the chance to preach
[1:33:37] again here, but you're going to hear it
[1:33:39] anyway.
[1:33:42] Amen.
[1:33:46] You've got to surrender to him both
[1:33:48] soul, body, and spirit. Everything you
[1:33:50] are has to be surrendered to God in
[1:33:52] order that he can work his will in you.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; We're always trying to put our part in
[1:34:00] something we know. You know that you
[1:34:02] want to do it. It's not what he asked
[1:34:04] you to do. He said surrender.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; In him is perfect fulfillment.
[1:34:12] Remember, David was a king of Israel.
[1:34:14] David had a kingdom. And watch what he
[1:34:17] says. In him is perfect fulfillment. In
[1:34:19] him, though we once esteemed him not,
[1:34:22] now we love him with joy unspeakable and
[1:34:24] full of glory. In the midst of the
[1:34:25] church, he stands and we will sing his
[1:34:27] praise. For he is a mighty conqueror is
[1:34:30] head over. He the mighty conqueror is
[1:34:32] head over the church which is his bride.
[1:34:34] He bought her. He owns her. She is his
[1:34:37] and his alone. And he cares for her. He
[1:34:40] is our king and we are his kingdom, his
[1:34:45] eternal possession.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; That ought to settle it. God's ways are
[1:34:50] perfect.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; And when you've laid your veil on his
[1:34:53] shoulders, your way will be perfect.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how I feel or what I
[1:34:58] think about it.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; It's what he said.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:07] Amen. I could go on a lot more here. You
[1:35:11] can't surrender to Jesus.
[1:35:14] Why? What's the matter? Question.
[1:35:17] Brother Brand, I'm answering a question.
[1:35:19] If you are a woman, don't you have to
[1:35:20] surrender to your husband to be a wife?
[1:35:23] Surrender all you are. A little lady
[1:35:25] when you were married, virtuous, fought
[1:35:27] all your life to stay virtuous. But one
[1:35:30] day you found a man that you loved, you
[1:35:32] were his completely completely.
[1:35:35] The things that you fought against all
[1:35:37] your life and tried to live clean and
[1:35:39] clear and virtuous, now you surrender
[1:35:41] every bit of it to one man. Is that
[1:35:43] right? You put yourself completely in
[1:35:45] his hands. You are his. All that you
[1:35:48] have stood for in decency and moral and
[1:35:50] everything like that. Now you turn it
[1:35:52] over to a man because you surrender
[1:35:55] yourself to the man. Can you can't you
[1:35:58] do the same thing to Jesus Christ? Just
[1:36:01] surrender yourself that way. All that I
[1:36:03] am, all my mind, all my thoughts.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Certainly.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't think you're possessed
[1:36:14] of an evil spirit. I think the evil
[1:36:16] spirit anoints you with them kind of
[1:36:17] thoughts, trying to make you think that
[1:36:20] you cannot surrender yourself
[1:36:23] to that man or in this case to God."
[1:36:27] Amen.
[1:36:30] Let me show you something. Why would you
[1:36:33] want to surrender to him? Now, there's a
[1:36:35] question, isn't it? What's in your
[1:36:38] heart? Do you want to or don't you want
[1:36:41] to?
[1:36:45] But she in this case,
[1:36:48] the prophet seeing I want to, he said,
[1:36:51] why would you want to surrender him?
[1:36:53] Because there's something out there
[1:36:54] calling you to surrender.
[1:37:00] It's a very good sign that you ought to
[1:37:01] surrender yourself. Now all you do,
[1:37:04] brother, sister, might be a young
[1:37:06] person, old, whatever it is, you just
[1:37:07] can't find yourselves that completely
[1:37:09] surrender. Just give yourself over.
[1:37:16] If your husband says, "We need to do it
[1:37:19] this way,"
[1:37:21] then if you don't like what he made the
[1:37:23] decision, they'll go pray for him.
[1:37:28] Don't go talking about him and downing
[1:37:31] him in other people's eyes.
[1:37:34] And same way with the husband. Don't you
[1:37:36] go out there and try to down your wife
[1:37:38] and talk against her
[1:37:42] and quit your listening to other voices
[1:37:44] and get yourself united back together.
[1:37:49] Anything that'll separate that. The same
[1:37:52] thing I've taken spiritual and natural
[1:37:54] side here both. Anything that'll
[1:37:56] separate you from that is not of God.
[1:38:01] Amen. Amen.
[1:38:04] I'll be honest with you. I don't I don't
[1:38:06] I don't practice my sermons.
[1:38:11] I stand up here depending on God to tell
[1:38:13] it as it should be through me.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; And I absolutely have laid this veil,
[1:38:18] all I know, upon his shoulders. If you
[1:38:21] don't like what you heard tonight, pray
[1:38:23] for me because I'm certainly praying for
[1:38:25] all of you. Every bit of you. And don't
[1:38:28] think anybody's against you. I love you.
[1:38:30] We love you. We're not against anybody.
[1:38:33] We want the people. If you've got Christ
[1:38:35] in your heart, I don't care what it is.
[1:38:37] You want them saved. You want them
[1:38:38] delivered and line up with this word.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Because that's your escape. That's your
[1:38:43] deliverance right there is to lay your
[1:38:46] veil on his shoulders and give him the
[1:38:49] responsibility to do him and quit
[1:38:52] complaining how he made you
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; and give everything you are to him.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; And let him do what he wants to do and
[1:39:01] you do it. You serve him. You give
[1:39:03] yourself to him natural physic natural
[1:39:06] spiritually. You give yourself to him.
[1:39:08] Commit it to the Lord and let God do the
[1:39:10] work. Amen.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; If you can't believe that, then you
[1:39:14] can't believe you're not submitting
[1:39:16] yourself in the hands of God like you
[1:39:18] should be and giving him the right to do
[1:39:21] what he wants.
[1:39:24] My my my. Well, amen, brother David.
[1:39:30] I knocked this cross, didn't I? I don't
[1:39:33] know if that's straight. Looks like it.
[1:39:36] Anyway,
[1:39:38] Lord bless you. Let's stand.
[1:39:42] I'll stop.
[1:39:46] I wonder today when God leads us to a
[1:39:48] life of completely complete surrender
[1:39:51] and service to him. I wonder if our
[1:39:53] spirits sometimes don't rebel. Kind of
[1:39:55] showing that wonder if we are lambs.
[1:39:59] You know, the lambs are bleeding. The
[1:40:02] sheep are bleing.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Who's going to answer the bling? Who's
[1:40:05] going to answer it? I'll tell you who
[1:40:08] answers it. The answer comes through the
[1:40:10] word. And who has the word today
[1:40:14] where I tell you where does he work in
[1:40:17] and through?
[1:40:20] He works in and through his bride. And
[1:40:22] she knows that
[1:40:24] we have the word of faith in our lips
[1:40:26] already. It's in our heart. Then let's
[1:40:29] start exercising it and taking our
[1:40:31] authority and claim our rights on the
[1:40:33] basis of the word.
[1:40:37] Amen.
[1:40:39] Sorry, Sister Melody. You heard a rough
[1:40:41] sermon, but God send you give you
[1:40:45] traveling mercies.
[1:40:48] We're praying for you.
[1:40:50] We're praying for all of you. And I hope
[1:40:53] you're praying for me
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; because this isn't easy. As our pastor
[1:40:58] will know, it's not easy.
[1:41:03] But we have to get over this about what
[1:41:05] people think about us.
[1:41:08] and let go and lay our veil on his
[1:41:10] shoulders and let him do and work
[1:41:12] through us. Let me tell you what the
[1:41:13] prophet said. He said, "It's you ceasing
[1:41:16] and him doing."
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:10 said, "When you've entered
[1:41:20] into rest, you have ceased from your
[1:41:24] labors."
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; God is in control.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're sealed. You've entered into
[1:41:31] rest. You ceased from your ceased.
[1:41:34] Brother man said, "You've got to cease."
[1:41:36] Philippians 2:13 said, "It's God which
[1:41:38] workketh in you, both to will and to do
[1:41:41] of his good pleasure." Then let's let
[1:41:43] him do it. Let's give our veil on his
[1:41:45] shoulders and quit worrying about how we
[1:41:47] sound and just give yourself to him in
[1:41:50] love and let him by love preach it.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; If we're called to preach it
[1:41:57] or preach it in your home to your
[1:41:59] children,
[1:42:03] preach it, brother, sister. We all have
[1:42:05] a ministry in that body.
[1:42:09] Amen. To serve our head.
[1:42:13] We only have one head.
[1:42:16] Let's not get double-minded here. We
[1:42:18] only have one head.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Let's be lambs. Let's submit ourselves.
[1:42:31] Let's surrender our lives to Christ.
[1:42:34] You're his possession. Do you want him
[1:42:36] to lead or not lead?
[1:42:40] Are you willing to commit yourself to
[1:42:42] him?
[1:42:44] Cuz God and his and Christ the bride,
[1:42:47] Christ the bride and God are the same
[1:42:49] person. It's himself. And we're here for
[1:42:53] one purpose.
[1:42:55] That's to serve Christ.
[1:42:59] And our lives and our makeups ought to
[1:43:01] reflect that. We don't have to pump it
[1:43:04] up. We need a new birth. If we can't, if
[1:43:06] that's not happening through us, then we
[1:43:08] need to say, "Lord, there's something in
[1:43:10] the way here. Let's move it out of the
[1:43:12] way and let me not be a hearer only, but
[1:43:15] a doer of your word."
[1:43:22] Amen. God bless you. Richly bless you.
[1:43:26] The government shall be upon his
[1:43:29] shoulders.
[1:43:31] A body hast thou prepared me, Lord?
[1:43:35] Sacrifice and offering, I would not, but
[1:43:37] a body hast thou prepared me? Where's
[1:43:40] his body?
[1:43:43] Where's my body?
[1:43:46] Where's my wife's body?
[1:43:50] Do I show doom benevolence to her? She's
[1:43:53] not able to do anything. Has no
[1:43:54] authority except I give her that over
[1:43:57] her body. and I have no authority over
[1:43:58] mine unless she gives it to me.
[1:44:03] Amen. It's more than just natural
[1:44:06] marriage situations. It goes spiritual,
[1:44:10] too.
[1:44:12] Amen.
[1:44:16] All right, brother. Like I had to tell
[1:44:18] you, brother Paul, I just quit. That's
[1:44:20] all.
[1:44:22] Quit preaching. Let's bow our heads.
[1:44:24] Lord Jesus,
[1:44:26] thou the stream of all our comfort,
[1:44:30] more than life to me.
[1:44:33] Whom on earth beside thee, and whom in
[1:44:35] heaven but thee?
[1:44:39] We rejoice in every correction. We have
[1:44:42] a right now. We either can accept it or
[1:44:44] reject it. And I say, Lord, help us each
[1:44:46] one
[1:44:49] to give ourselves entirely to you. You
[1:44:51] are our shepherd. We shall not want.
[1:44:57] Our shepherd is not only our father.
[1:45:00] Our shepherd is our husband.
[1:45:03] And we submit ourselves to you, Lord,
[1:45:05] with all of our hearts. Lay our veil on
[1:45:07] your shoulders. You have the right. You
[1:45:09] have the right to do whatever you want.
[1:45:11] You will keep me. You'll hold me. You
[1:45:13] said you've accept the obligation. And I
[1:45:15] say, "Amen. That's all I need to know.
[1:45:18] You'll direct my path. You're guiding it
[1:45:21] perfectly. No, Lord. There's many times
[1:45:24] I don't understand, but it's me ceasing
[1:45:27] and you doing. I give myself over to
[1:45:30] your hands. I give my veil, place it on
[1:45:33] your shoulders. I do this for your glory
[1:45:36] and honor and for the honor and glory of
[1:45:38] yourself present with us because Lord,
[1:45:41] I'm soon to take a rapture. I've taken a
[1:45:43] change of my body and I'm feeding on
[1:45:45] that open book and I'm becoming what I
[1:45:49] feed on, Lord. and I'm praising you and
[1:45:51] I'm thanking you. But you took the book,
[1:45:53] you took your body. You took the book,
[1:45:55] you took your bride.
[1:46:00] And how glorious
[1:46:02] this union is, Lord. Everything has been
[1:46:05] provided. The the clothing, everything
[1:46:07] we need has already been opened in this
[1:46:09] word for us. And as we eat, you move. As
[1:46:13] we partake. And Lord, there isn't that
[1:46:15] we have to go out and and do this. We
[1:46:17] just submit ourselves to your word. we
[1:46:19] start partaking of your word and you'll
[1:46:21] take care of the rest of it.
[1:46:25] And what a blessed thing it is, Lord,
[1:46:27] that we can enter into that rest and for
[1:46:31] your glory and your honor in Jesus name.
[1:46:36] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:42] Hallelujah.
[1:46:49] Aren't you glad you have an ear to hear
[1:46:50] the word?
[1:46:52] The bride be in the final voice to the
[1:46:54] final age. The spirit and the bride say,
[1:46:57] "Come." And the Bible said, "In every
[1:47:00] age," he said, "He that hath an ear, let
[1:47:02] him hear what the spirit saith."
[1:47:07] The bride's ministry is the message of
[1:47:10] the hour.
[1:47:12] The bride's ministry is that open book.
[1:47:19] Aren't you glad?
[1:47:21] Baptism we needed, every one of us. But
[1:47:23] that's a temporal gift. The real gift is
[1:47:25] that soul down in there
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; that was predestinated by God to receive
[1:47:30] this word.
[1:47:32] I'm not ashamed of this word.
[1:47:37] Amen.
[1:47:39] I say, "Lord, let me preach it. As long
[1:47:42] as you open the door and open wherever I
[1:47:45] be, wherever I go, it doesn't matter." I
[1:47:47] say, "Lead me, Lord, I will follow." I
[1:47:51] wish I could sing. We can sing that
[1:47:54] that chorus. Lead me Lord,
[1:47:59] I
[1:48:01] will follow.
[1:48:05] Oh lead me Lord.
[1:48:09] I
[1:48:11] will go.
[1:48:15] You have called me.
[1:48:20] I will answer.
[1:48:25] Lead me Lord.
[1:48:28] I
[1:48:30] will go. I wish I knew the verses well
[1:48:32] enough.
[1:48:34] I don't. But so let's just sing the
[1:48:36] chorus once again. Lead me Lord,
[1:48:41] I
[1:48:43] will.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; I want to raise my hand. Say, God, this
[1:48:47] is to you.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; I'm testifying of that. Follow. I will
[1:48:53] go.
[1:48:57] You have called me.
[1:49:02] I will answer.
[1:49:06] Lead me Lord.
[1:49:10] I
[1:49:11] will go. One more time from your heart.
[1:49:16] Head me Lord.
[1:49:19] I
[1:49:21] will follow.
[1:49:25] Oh lead me Lord.
[1:49:29] I
[1:49:30] will go.
[1:49:34] You have called me
[1:49:38] and I have answered.
[1:49:43] Lead me Lord.
[1:49:46] I
[1:49:48] will go. Amen. Thank you Lord. Is that
[1:49:53] your desire? Is that your prayer?
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:49:58] Amen.
[1:50:02] God don't want mixers.
[1:50:04] He wants separators.
[1:50:09] We need a place of yielding to the
[1:50:11] spirit. A man never knows what it is to
[1:50:14] live a victorious life until he's
[1:50:16] completely overcome. Who? Himself.
[1:50:21] Amen. That's it.
[1:50:32] Let's sing Wings of Faith.
[1:50:39] There are two roads
[1:50:43] you may take.
[1:50:48] One by side
[1:50:52] and one by faith.
[1:50:58] Take the word of God
[1:51:02] or what you see.
[1:51:07] What you believe
[1:51:11] is what will be.
[1:51:15] So set your wings
[1:51:20] to the winds of faith.
[1:51:24] You can fly
[1:51:28] in a higher place.
[1:51:34] Do not struggle
[1:51:37] for it's by grace.
[1:51:42] Set your way
[1:51:46] to the winds of faith.
[1:51:51] So watch your need.
[1:51:56] Watch your cry. I need more of you,
[1:51:59] Lord. Watch your mountain
[1:52:04] much too high.
[1:52:09] Speak the word of God. Prophesy again
[1:52:13] and by and by
[1:52:18] it will move
[1:52:22] or you will fly.
[1:52:26] So set your wings
[1:52:30] in the wind. Faith takes its resting
[1:52:33] place in the word, brother, sister. Only
[1:52:35] in the word.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; You can fly in a higher place.
[1:52:43] So do not struggle.
[1:52:48] Oh, it's by grace
[1:52:53] at your wing.
[1:52:56] to the winds of faith.
[1:53:01] So watch the eagle
[1:53:06] in the sky. Just watch him set those
[1:53:09] wings. He dust struggle,
[1:53:15] does not strive.
[1:53:17] Two wings he was in action. The power
[1:53:22] that makes him right
[1:53:27] is already
[1:53:31] already in your heart. That's where it's
[1:53:34] at. So set your wings
[1:53:39] to the winds faith. Amen. Rest in the
[1:53:44] word. You can fly
[1:53:48] in. Don't you let the devil tell you you
[1:53:50] can't do that.
[1:53:53] Do not struggle.
[1:53:57] Well, it's by grace, sufficient grace.
[1:54:02] Set your wings,
[1:54:06] the winds of faith.
[1:54:11] You are my refuge. We'll close with that
[1:54:13] song.
[1:54:15] You are my hiding place.
[1:54:22] You are my refuge.
[1:54:27] You are my sanctuary.
[1:54:34] I feel afraid.
[1:54:37] You're my hiding place. You are my
[1:54:42] refuge.
[1:54:45] When the storm is raging
[1:54:51] underneath your wings
[1:54:55] I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge.
[1:55:03] You are my refuge.
[1:55:07] You are my sanctuary.
[1:55:13] When I feel afraid,
[1:55:17] you're my hiding place. You are my
[1:55:22] refuge.
[1:55:25] When the storm is raing
[1:55:31] underneath your wings,
[1:55:34] I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge.
[1:55:41] Thank the Lord. Brother Paul, do you
[1:55:43] have anything you want to Okay, God
[1:55:45] bless you. Come expecting Sunday. Come
[1:55:48] prayed up. Come in the spirit.
[1:55:51] Come in early.
[1:55:54] Get out from out there and come in and
[1:55:57] pray. Get ready to receive the word.
[1:56:02] I can tell you that. That's part of the
[1:56:04] ministry.
[1:56:10] I didn't say that to be funny. We've got
[1:56:13] too much of that. We need to get in here
[1:56:16] and get into the word and start praying
[1:56:17] and ask God to move.
[1:56:20] Amen. Might as well say it like it is.
[1:56:25] Amen. That's what we should do.
[1:56:28] Then we have homes to visit. We've come
[1:56:30] here to see him. We've come here to meet
[1:56:32] him. We've come here to hear the word.
[1:56:36] God bless you. Still love me. See you. I
[1:56:41] love you. God bless you.
