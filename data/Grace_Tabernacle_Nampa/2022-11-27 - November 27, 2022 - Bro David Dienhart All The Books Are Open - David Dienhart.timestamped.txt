[32:11] to write them down in the
[32:13] in the church age book brother I just
[32:16] call it this brother George's Edition

[32:25] numbers
[32:27] I'm going to try to bring something to

[32:31] the Lord leads in the time that I have

[32:53] probably going to make this only part 1A
[32:58] and then I'd like to continue on with
[33:00] this in the subject my subject here is
[33:03] who are these ones at the judgment
[33:08] and why are they there
[33:13] let's read out of Revelations 20.
[33:17] to start with
[33:20] your Bibles
[33:21] read out of Revelations 20.
[33:25] and verse 11.
[33:27] starting with I've said the scriptures
[33:30] other places I will be referring to this
[33:33] church age book quite a bit I want to
[33:35] I feel like I just anointed to be more
[33:38] of a teaching this morning and
[33:40] throughout this time
[33:42] you know teaching brother Branham said
[33:44] is is uh treacherous
[33:49] but it's a gifted there's a gift of
[33:51] teaching
[33:54] he said it's also uh
[33:58] cutting
[34:00] but he said teaching positionally places
[34:04] the people
[34:07] we're speaking would positionally
[34:10] placing this morning
[34:13] and
[34:15] and it it but it has to be brought under
[34:17] inspiration if it's not inspired by God
[34:19] it's just intellectual
[34:24] so we're depending upon God this morning
[34:28] to teach
[34:30] so you can just settle down relax
[34:34] I'm a preacher
[34:38] but I'm going to use that little office
[34:40] that
[34:41] of teaching so I just pray that God will
[34:44] help us to receive from the youngest to
[34:46] the oldest
[34:48] we're here in his presence I want that
[34:50] to be known by yours may your soul
[34:53] recognize that
[34:55] we are here in his presence
[34:59] amen Revelations 20 verse 11 and I saw a
[35:03] great white throne
[35:06] I'll just say this right now this is
[35:09] after the millennium
[35:13] all right so so we'll come into that
[35:15] more as we go along but and I saw this
[35:19] is John type of the Bride
[35:22] who is revealing these things to John
[35:25] a prophet
[35:27] an angel
[35:29] are you with me
[35:31] those that you know the scripture oh
[35:33] that's true
[35:35] amen and I saw a great white throne in
[35:39] him that's and him singular that sat on
[35:41] it from whose Faith the earth and the
[35:44] heaven fled away and there was no place
[35:46] found for them
[35:50] and I saw the dead small and great stand
[35:53] before God and the books plural were
[35:56] opened and another book singular was
[36:01] opened which is The Book of Life
[36:04] and the dead were judged out of those
[36:07] things which were written in the books
[36:10] they're both records now
[36:13] amen all right
[36:16] they were written in the books according
[36:18] to their works
[36:22] what were they being judged by The Book
[36:25] of Life
[36:27] okay
[36:29] and the Sea gave up the dead which were
[36:31] in it and death and Hell delivered up
[36:33] the dead which were in them and they
[36:35] were judged every man according to their
[36:37] works
[36:41] and death and hell were cast into the
[36:44] Lake of Fire
[36:46] this is the second death
[36:49] this is after the second Resurrection
[36:55] what we're looking for what the bride's
[36:58] looking for
[37:00] is the first
[37:03] amen are you with me
[37:05] we're not a part of the second
[37:10] but there are those that are part of the
[37:12] second
[37:13] whether you like it or not
[37:15] you may go in the grave anytime
[37:18] but you're going to rise again
[37:23] because all will be at this place
[37:26] all will be at this judgment
[37:32] amen
[37:34] I hope you become very aware of that as
[37:36] we go along and what takes place
[37:40] and whosoever was it verse 15 and
[37:43] whosoever was not found written in the
[37:46] books of excuse me not books and
[37:49] whosoever was not found written in the
[37:51] Book of Life
[37:53] was cast into the Lake of Fire
[37:59] this is the second death
[38:02] amen
[38:03] let's go to Daniel while you're standing
[38:05] Daniel 7.
[38:08] see what prophet said over in Daniel he
[38:10] loud Lord allowed him to see that time
[38:12] in Daniel 7.
[38:16] verse 10 starting with verse 9.
[38:29] now the book very often referred to I
[38:31] still hear a lot of attorney
[38:33] I'll just wait just a minute
[38:35] Daniel
[38:37] everybody got it say Amen Daniel 7 9 and
[38:41] I beheld till Thrones were cast down
[38:44] and the Ancient of Days did sit whose
[38:48] garment was white as snow
[38:50] and the hair of his head like pure wool
[38:53] I hope that reminds you of something
[38:54] bride
[38:56] the prophet called him the judge
[38:59] are you with me
[39:00] the hair of his head like pure wool
[39:04] see the bride sees this
[39:07] amen
[39:10] and the hair of his head like pure will
[39:12] that that person I'm saying his throne
[39:14] was like the fiery flame and his wheels
[39:17] as burning fire
[39:20] a fiery stream issued and came forth
[39:22] from him thousand thousands ministered
[39:25] unto him and Ten Thousand Times Ten
[39:29] Thousand stood before him
[39:32] the Judgment was set
[39:35] and the books
[39:37] were opened
[39:40] and of course we know another book was
[39:42] opened also
[39:44] you may be seated
[39:50] now I'm going to give you places here in
[39:52] the church age book I'm reading from
[39:54] paragraph numbers
[39:56] because this book these books are broken
[39:58] down into paragraph numbers for as other
[40:02] than the older book and
[40:04] and you say why do you refer to a book
[40:06] because this is the word of the Lord
[40:08] through a Vindicated prophet
[40:13] amen
[40:15] the Bible said the word of the Lord
[40:16] comes to His prophets he had no other
[40:18] way of bringing the interpretation of
[40:20] the word for the season outside of
[40:22] bringing it through a prophet
[40:24] did you know that I the Lord will do
[40:27] nothing but I reveal my secrets to my
[40:29] servants the prophets
[40:31] amen
[40:32] see now now we realize that that Prophet
[40:36] had the word of the Lord for the hour
[40:37] and somebody is going to stand here
[40:39] vindicating that prophecy
[40:43] and manifesting it
[40:45] and she is called the bride
[40:49] the message is still operating brother
[40:51] sister the message didn't leave when the
[40:53] prophet left
[40:54] the message is in the as that as on the
[40:57] scene
[40:59] it's in Bride form
[41:02] under her messenger she would be the
[41:04] final voice not another voice the same
[41:06] voice
[41:10] amen amen all right just wanted to
[41:13] clarify that
[41:15] on paragraph 174 of the church age book
[41:18] and this message I'm in the message well
[41:21] this paragraph I'm in the message you
[41:23] better know what the message is it's a
[41:25] sardesian church age
[41:28] okay so I'm on paragraph 174 I'd like to
[41:31] read this
[41:33] and it's under the heading
[41:35] it's under the heading where I'm reading
[41:37] from to the end of the message that
[41:40] message that Porsche is the promise to
[41:41] the overcomer so if you're interested on
[41:44] where I'm speaking this from this is
[41:46] where it is paragraph 175 then will come
[41:50] the day when all stand together as seen
[41:53] in Daniel 7 10.
[41:55] I just read it to you
[41:58] the king will be there with his bride
[42:02] of course that's his Queen
[42:05] with his bride
[42:07] the king will be there with his bride
[42:09] and in front of them
[42:12] I want you to know there was one set
[42:14] upon the throne
[42:16] but who was in the throne with him
[42:18] who was in The Authority with him
[42:21] who's one with him
[42:23] when you saw her you saw him when you
[42:25] saw him you saw her it was not two as
[42:28] one
[42:31] amen are you with me all right he said
[42:35] the king will be there with his bride
[42:37] and in front of them will be the
[42:39] multitude so far who are to be judged
[42:45] amen she's not in front of them him
[42:48] she's at she's in the throne with him
[42:51] okay
[42:53] yes all will be there that includes you
[42:56] it includes me it includes every one of
[42:58] us
[42:59] all will be there
[43:02] all the books
[43:04] are opened
[43:08] because remember he was there we saw the
[43:11] position of the bride and before him
[43:14] and the books were opened
[43:18] all right
[43:20] a final disposition of all is made
[43:24] a final disposition placing
[43:28] a final placement a final disclosure a
[43:31] final the final disposing the final the
[43:35] finality of all
[43:38] positioning placing
[43:40] is to be is made the Harvest is indeed
[43:44] over the books once opened
[43:47] are closed
[43:50] this is what we're coming to
[43:58] all right
[44:00] let's continue on here
[44:05] he said
[44:09] John the Baptist
[44:11] exactly what John the Baptist said
[44:16] he said in in the wheat would be
[44:19] garnered the chaff burned
[44:22] said bind the tares and then gather the
[44:24] wheat the economical move will bind the
[44:26] to the tear churches together for the
[44:29] tares must be bound first
[44:34] what binds them together their rejection
[44:36] of the word
[44:38] put them out of the church they are
[44:39] bound together under an ecumenical World
[44:41] Church move
[44:44] that's what's happening
[44:47] the denominations have rejected the word
[44:49] of Truth in this hour they've rejected
[44:52] it
[44:52] they turned it out we find in Revelation
[44:55] 14 they shut the door to it
[44:58] he the Lord was on the outside knocking
[45:01] on the church door
[45:03] they had put him out sad condition
[45:05] that's our day
[45:08] and what they've done is now
[45:09] Consolidated themselves against the word
[45:13] now they're turning to the World Council
[45:15] of churches which we know who's the head
[45:18] of that though they don't
[45:20] though don't Envision it we do how come
[45:23] we do because the word's been opened
[45:26] the message has come out we know who the
[45:29] Beast is and we know who the Beast
[45:31] system is
[45:34] the bride is not to be deceived she will
[45:36] not be deceived because Seven Seals have
[45:38] been opened
[45:41] there's already been a book open to the
[45:44] bride that's kind of a little ahead of
[45:46] myself but there's already been a book
[45:47] opened
[45:50] the bride has done judged herself
[45:53] she's heard the word of the judge
[45:56] to her that the case is dismissed
[45:59] there's no case against the bride
[46:03] she has no sin to be judged for
[46:06] amen hallelujah all right now so let's
[46:11] I'll just back off a little bit now the
[46:13] second move will be the binding
[46:16] this is what bundles them together all
[46:18] under one thing under one head and it's
[46:21] not God's head and it's not the word
[46:24] there's only two Powers she's bound
[46:26] under Satan's power
[46:30] a very religious move but bound under
[46:33] that
[46:34] all right now he said
[46:38] beyond the Baptist even said the chaff
[46:41] has got the chaff will be burned but the
[46:43] wheat will be gathered into the Garner
[46:46] it's up to him Christ to do that
[46:49] all right now he said for the tares must
[46:52] be bound first and their end is burning
[46:55] though they are not burned at their
[46:56] binding but they are reserved to a later
[46:58] date which is at the end of the Thousand
[47:00] Years or the second Resurrection
[47:04] but once the tears are bound the Rapture
[47:06] can take place
[47:08] now you see how where we're at
[47:10] once the tears are bound the Rapture can
[47:12] take place
[47:13] but what's the bride been doing these
[47:15] few years laying in the presence of the
[47:18] open sun ripening
[47:24] the tares have already rejected the word
[47:26] they're being bundled what's happening
[47:29] to the bride they're laying in the
[47:31] presence of the Sun
[47:36] all right
[47:39] what is the sun the revealed word
[47:41] himself revealed unveiled to her alone
[47:45] it isn't everybody else
[47:47] who do I know they are I don't know but
[47:49] I know I'm one of them
[47:52] how do you know that because I see the
[47:54] evidence of what he said I would know
[47:58] amen
[48:00] in me personally this this
[48:03] we're going to stand before him someday
[48:05] as individuals we're going to stand
[48:07] before the bride and the groom king and
[48:10] queen as individuals
[48:12] the message to the brightest individuals
[48:15] that make up the body of Christ
[48:19] it's not groups Affair it's individual
[48:22] affair
[48:24] so you this morning are standing before
[48:26] the king
[48:27] you're going to hear the message of
[48:29] Salvation you're going to hear what's
[48:30] going to take place you've got a choice
[48:33] to make
[48:37] and that choice will be based on his
[48:39] choice
[48:41] that sounds strange doesn't it but you
[48:43] could not make a choice to have him
[48:45] without him choosing you first
[48:49] you couldn't even have a desire for him
[48:51] until he put the desire in you first
[48:55] unless he desired for you to be what you
[48:58] are to be a part of him because you were
[49:00] in him you would have no desire to serve
[49:02] him
[49:04] amen amen amen that's right
[49:07] all right so he said but the tares the
[49:10] Rapture can take place and we'll do so
[49:12] be somewhere between the binding and the
[49:15] revelation of antichrist
[49:19] now we could go to Second Thessalonians
[49:21] 2 7. why don't we just turn there just a
[49:23] minute
[49:25] second Thessalonians 2 7.
[49:30] I wasn't going to read this but I just
[49:32] gonna just gonna second Thessalonians
[49:35] I think it's second uh
[49:39] yes
[49:41] yes two seven
[49:45] talking about the The Binding
[49:49] see verse 7 says for the mystery of
[49:51] iniquity
[49:53] doth already work let's just start let's
[49:56] just start with verse one there now
[49:58] beseech you Brethren by the coming of
[50:00] our Lord Jesus Christ
[50:04] who is he Supreme judge
[50:07] I'll just say it that way you'll know
[50:09] what we're talking about right beseech
[50:11] you Brethren by the coming of our Lord
[50:13] Jesus Christ and by our gathering
[50:15] together unto him what gathers us
[50:17] together
[50:19] sound of a trumpet
[50:23] all right that you be soon you suit you
[50:26] you be not soon shaken in mind or
[50:28] troubled neither by Spirit nor by word
[50:30] nor by letter as from us as that day of
[50:33] Christ is at hand
[50:35] let no man deceive you by any means for
[50:38] that day will not come except there
[50:40] coming of Falling Away first and that
[50:42] man of sin
[50:44] what we just read there see that man of
[50:47] sin
[50:48] between the binding and the revelation
[50:50] of antichrist who's the man of sin
[50:52] Antichrist
[50:54] and that man sin
[51:00] they the man of sin be revealed the son
[51:02] of perdition
[51:04] son of Satan who opposes and exalteth
[51:08] himself above all that is called God or
[51:10] that is worshiped so that he as God
[51:13] sitteth in the temple of God showing
[51:15] himself that he is God
[51:17] all right
[51:19] remember ye not that when I was with you
[51:21] I was yet was yet with you I told you
[51:23] these things and now you know what
[51:26] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[51:29] his time
[51:31] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[51:34] work only he who letteth will now let we
[51:38] know the prophet said he who letteth is
[51:40] God
[51:41] he that who let us will let Christ until
[51:45] he Christ the bride be taken out of the
[51:48] way
[51:51] amen so he who letteth will let until he
[51:54] Christ
[51:56] be taken out of the way the bride
[51:59] and then shall that Wicked be revealed
[52:03] whom the Lord
[52:04] shall consume with the spirit of his
[52:06] mouth and shall destroy with the
[52:09] brightness of his coming even him whose
[52:11] coming is after the working of Satan
[52:13] with all power and signs and lying
[52:15] wonders
[52:16] and all deceivableness of
[52:18] unrighteousness in them that perish
[52:20] because they received not the love of
[52:22] the truth that they might be saved
[52:25] and so for that cause God has sent them
[52:28] us
[52:28] sell send them strong delusion that they
[52:32] be that they should believe a lie why
[52:34] because they're turning away from truth
[52:38] they're given a strong delusion to
[52:40] believe a lie thinking they're all right
[52:43] and don't know that they're lost
[52:46] amen are you with me okay all right so
[52:49] that so that they all might be damned
[52:52] who believe not the truth but had
[52:54] pleasure in unrighteousness
[52:57] oh my
[52:59] what an indictment huh all right now
[53:02] look
[53:03] so we just read that day will come but
[53:06] we're looking for the
[53:08] rapture
[53:10] the next thing for the bride
[53:12] is the body change
[53:14] that is now
[53:17] in progress
[53:20] we're coming to that position
[53:22] amen all right
[53:27] who are these righteous ones now there's
[53:30] going to be righteous ones now this may
[53:32] sound strange
[53:33] but there's going to be righteous ones
[53:35] at the judgment
[53:37] you say well the bride's righteous but
[53:39] there's other righteous
[53:43] amen that miss being in the bride
[53:48] that will come up at the
[53:50] second Resurrection
[53:53] amen
[53:54] who are then these righteous
[53:57] that are standing before the bride
[54:00] that are being judged by their works
[54:03] that are being judged by The Book of
[54:05] Life
[54:08] why are they there
[54:11] all right
[54:12] this paragraph 131
[54:16] brother Branham says this he says there
[54:18] will be both a righteous and unrighteous
[54:21] in this judgment
[54:24] it says these righteous will not be in
[54:28] the bride will not be the bride
[54:31] for the bride sets with him in judgment
[54:34] so just to make you clear that this is
[54:37] not bride
[54:39] all right
[54:44] because the bride in in second First
[54:46] Corinthians 6 20 or 6 chapter 6 First
[54:50] Corinthians 2-3 do you not know that the
[54:53] Saints shall judge the world
[54:57] and if the world shall be judged by you
[54:59] are you unworthy to judge the smallest
[55:02] matters
[55:07] what is to be judged something discern
[55:09] it
[55:11] amen
[55:13] who's the discerner
[55:15] the Holy Spirit himself where is he
[55:18] today
[55:19] is in his place of worship
[55:22] he is in where he put his name and
[55:24] that's in his body
[55:29] all right know you not that we shall
[55:31] judge angels
[55:33] we who's we he's talking to
[55:36] Paul including himself know you not that
[55:39] we shall judge angels
[55:42] how much more things that pertain to
[55:44] this life
[55:47] then in Revelation 3 21 it says the
[55:50] layout of CN age to him that overcometh
[55:55] overcome what
[55:58] the age the power of that age the the
[56:01] the the the the
[56:02] Antichrist system
[56:05] amen
[56:07] to him that overcometh well I grant to
[56:09] sit with me in my throne
[56:13] even as I also we're going to overcome
[56:16] the same we way he overcome
[56:19] as I also overcame and sat down with my
[56:23] father in his throne
[56:26] amen
[56:28] him and his father won he said I shall
[56:31] be one in you I in you I and my father
[56:34] my father me I and you and you and me
[56:37] you know what we don't see anything but
[56:39] one God there
[56:44] amen for Jesus Christ was that God made
[56:47] flesh
[56:49] amen and now where is he made flesh the
[56:53] spirit that was in him is now in you and
[56:56] I the bride
[56:58] Same Spirit not another
[57:01] all right
[57:05] see the bride is with him paragraph 132
[57:08] see the bride is with him in the throne
[57:10] as she is to judge the world she has to
[57:13] be sitting in the Judgment with him that
[57:16] is exactly what Daniel saw
[57:19] those thousand thousands that ministered
[57:22] unto him is the bride
[57:25] amen
[57:30] see it's the same scene for the thousand
[57:33] thousand who are ministering are the
[57:34] bride for who ministers to the husband
[57:36] but the wife
[57:41] the question now arises who are these
[57:43] righteous ones in the judgment
[57:46] there is no other place that they can
[57:49] come up for there are only two
[57:50] resurrections
[57:52] I'm talking about who are these
[57:54] righteous ones in the Judgment before
[57:56] the bride
[57:58] being judged
[58:00] there's no other place they come up
[58:02] after the second Resurrection they miss
[58:04] they did not qualify for the first
[58:06] resurrection they came up in the second
[58:08] which is a resurrection unto judgment
[58:10] the ones who qualify for the first
[58:13] resurrection are the bride and not in
[58:16] the judgment
[58:19] all right now
[58:21] then he goes on to paragraph five
[58:24] in the paragraph or I mean excuse me
[58:27] John 5 24.
[58:29] verily verily I say unto you he that
[58:31] heareth my word
[58:33] what is the word hearing the Bible under
[58:35] in the church ages under every Church
[58:38] age the last thing was he that hath an
[58:40] ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit
[58:42] saith to the church
[58:45] now in every Church age there was true
[58:47] and false
[58:49] in that church
[58:50] are you with me God put them together
[58:52] but in the end time there's a separation
[58:55] made
[58:58] and in every age there's been the True
[59:01] Believer that followed the light for
[59:03] that hour and received the message of
[59:05] the messenger
[59:06] and were accounted as bride in that time
[59:10] they are there in the Judgment when
[59:13] we're talking about the bride the
[59:14] Judgment it's not just the Bride of this
[59:15] age it's the Bride of all ages since
[59:18] Jesus Christ the seven Church ages
[59:22] they'll sit there in judgment and they
[59:25] will judge them of their own age
[59:30] their time
[59:32] amen yes I did speak we'll brother Brown
[59:36] said I'm going to be there and I'm going
[59:37] to give an answer for what I said I'm
[59:39] going to have to answer for what I said
[59:40] here this morning I do too
[59:45] amen that's why I say we're not just
[59:47] here to have a happy holiday we're here
[59:50] to meet God this morning
[59:54] we didn't come here to frolic and talk
[59:55] about the thing I pray that God will
[59:57] wash your thoughts and bring you such
[59:59] subject to Christ this morning and wash
[1:00:01] your thoughts of what happened yesterday
[1:00:02] or what you think is going to happen
[1:00:04] tomorrow and the Affairs of what took
[1:00:07] place and wash your mind and pay
[1:00:09] attention to what's being said because
[1:00:11] you're going to be there
[1:00:19] all right
[1:00:23] now verily verily I say unto you
[1:00:25] speaking to you unto you who's you he
[1:00:28] said ah Jesus saying to to his followers
[1:00:30] I say unto you
[1:00:32] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:00:35] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:00:37] that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:00:41] that word Everlasting is eternal
[1:00:44] in this particular context it's eternal
[1:00:46] life
[1:00:47] and he that hath everlasting life and
[1:00:50] who is that that is the believer
[1:00:52] that believer is already the recipient
[1:00:55] of
[1:00:57] eternal life
[1:00:58] he that heareth my word hath
[1:01:01] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:01:03] already a recipient of eternal life
[1:01:06] already in his possession now
[1:01:10] there's only one people upon this Earth
[1:01:12] at a possession of eternal life and
[1:01:14] that's the bride alone
[1:01:17] there's only one people that's going to
[1:01:19] go in the first resurrection which we're
[1:01:20] looking for the Rapture and that's the
[1:01:22] bride only
[1:01:26] she has the ear to hear what the spirits
[1:01:30] saith unto this church age
[1:01:36] and the only one
[1:01:39] you say how can you say that right here
[1:01:41] is the scripture
[1:01:44] amen Father Brown said all that the
[1:01:46] father has given me will come to me the
[1:01:49] scripture said that
[1:01:50] and no man could come except my father
[1:01:53] reveals me to you
[1:01:57] he that has an ear to hear what the
[1:01:59] spirit saith
[1:02:01] amen all right so it takes revelation of
[1:02:05] the word
[1:02:06] let this be first thing in your heart
[1:02:08] it's got to have revelation
[1:02:12] without Revelation you'll never be in
[1:02:14] the rapture
[1:02:15] you can intellectualize this message all
[1:02:17] you want but without Revelation you
[1:02:19] won't be there
[1:02:23] amen
[1:02:25] an intellectual an intellectual
[1:02:27] conception of this message will not put
[1:02:30] you in the rapture
[1:02:32] it takes the Holy Ghost himself that
[1:02:34] wrote this word to be in you receiving
[1:02:36] the word
[1:02:39] amen
[1:02:42] and if you have the revelation of the
[1:02:44] word it'll go through the whole
[1:02:45] scriptures back and forth it will not
[1:02:47] deviate
[1:02:50] and you can't base that on nothing else
[1:02:53] you can't base it on a Works Affair you
[1:02:55] can't base it on feelings you can't base
[1:02:56] out of whether you shout or dance you
[1:02:58] cannot base it on the fact that you can
[1:03:00] cast out Devils by the spirit of God
[1:03:05] and I believe in casting out devils in
[1:03:07] fact I'm preaching right here is casting
[1:03:09] out devils
[1:03:11] amen because it's a word
[1:03:14] I believe that but you can't base your
[1:03:16] Eternal salvation on the fact that you
[1:03:18] can do that
[1:03:22] that's not the evidence you can shout
[1:03:24] You Can Dance speak in tongues that's
[1:03:26] not the evidence that will not put you
[1:03:28] in the rapture
[1:03:33] am I I just kind of shaking a little bit
[1:03:36] isn't it
[1:03:39] you can be anointed in your spirit with
[1:03:41] the genuine Holy Ghost and still be lost
[1:03:43] and go to hell
[1:03:45] chewing that a while
[1:03:46] because the seed of God is not in your
[1:03:49] soul to receive that baptism
[1:03:53] you can have all the works you want to
[1:03:54] have
[1:03:55] speak in tongues and I believe in
[1:03:57] casting out Devils I I can never come
[1:03:59] against that because God is the only one
[1:04:01] that can cast The Devil out
[1:04:03] but you can have all those gifts and God
[1:04:05] will pour it out upon you to show who
[1:04:07] he's present but you will not receive it
[1:04:10] unless you have an open heart to receive
[1:04:12] that word itself by revelation God has
[1:04:14] to reveal himself to you
[1:04:18] he has to reveal that word to you
[1:04:22] got kind of quiet
[1:04:24] it's all right that's the truth
[1:04:30] you can't base it upon those things at
[1:04:32] all
[1:04:34] the devil hates that
[1:04:37] what I just said he'll do everything he
[1:04:38] can to keep you from that truth
[1:04:41] but that was to be preached upon and
[1:04:43] talked about brother man said at the end
[1:04:44] time
[1:04:47] was that mystery
[1:04:50] amen I'm getting off my line here but
[1:04:52] just help me Lord to get back here now
[1:04:54] watch He's reading that scripture the
[1:04:56] believer is already the recipient of
[1:04:58] eternal life which he has in his
[1:05:00] possession now and shall not come into
[1:05:02] condemnation that's judgment
[1:05:05] I'm still quoting Saint John 5 24.
[1:05:09] shall not come into judgment is what it
[1:05:11] really says shall not come into
[1:05:12] condemnation brother Brown said shall
[1:05:14] not come into judgment is what it really
[1:05:16] says but is passed permanently from
[1:05:18] death
[1:05:19] permanently from Death To Life
[1:05:23] because when that Holy Ghost comes in
[1:05:25] and takes its Abiding Place in that soul
[1:05:27] that seals you to the day of your
[1:05:29] Redemption
[1:05:33] amen that's right and then we grow into
[1:05:36] Perfection of The Headstone then we come
[1:05:39] into complete full stature of Christ
[1:05:41] himself in this hour
[1:05:44] there's your adoption
[1:05:48] amen
[1:05:49] that's growing into that perfect one
[1:05:52] that's growing in you
[1:05:54] not the perfect man it's the perfect one
[1:05:57] that's in you the perfect one that's
[1:05:58] birthed in you
[1:06:02] when you receive the baptism of Holy
[1:06:04] Ghost you're sealed right there when
[1:06:06] that Holy Ghost comes in because you can
[1:06:08] only be born again I've said this before
[1:06:09] but let me say it again you can only be
[1:06:12] born again if the seed of God is placed
[1:06:14] in your soul
[1:06:16] and if it is you'll have a genuine
[1:06:18] revelation of the truth and promise word
[1:06:20] for this season
[1:06:25] for this hour
[1:06:28] that's having an ear to hear
[1:06:31] it's not these ears
[1:06:33] it's this year
[1:06:36] amen amen amen all right so now he goes
[1:06:41] on to say and I think I'll let you see
[1:06:44] now if I'm yeah
[1:06:45] but notice carefully we must but notice
[1:06:48] carefully he said
[1:06:50] after reading that scripture but notice
[1:06:52] carefully paragraph 135
[1:06:54] Jesus must have yet another group in
[1:06:58] mind
[1:06:58] he just identified the bride but yet he
[1:07:01] must have another group in mind
[1:07:03] who had a certain Resurrection second
[1:07:05] Resurrection will receive eternal life
[1:07:11] the righteous
[1:07:13] They will receive it at the judgment
[1:07:18] now I'm not going to get into who that
[1:07:20] is
[1:07:21] I'll get into that Wednesday night amen
[1:07:25] Lord willing because I've got I've got
[1:07:27] to go through this other right now
[1:07:35] he said they'll receive it
[1:07:37] They will receive it at the second after
[1:07:40] the OR at that second Resurrection
[1:07:44] not having previously received it as a
[1:07:49] member of the Bride
[1:07:52] amen all right now
[1:07:56] Revelations 20. I think I'll read you
[1:07:59] right now is going to put it ahead a
[1:08:00] little bit but I may come back to it
[1:08:02] anyway Revelations 20.
[1:08:06] verse 4.
[1:08:15] now this is concerning the bride
[1:08:19] amen of all ages that the bride is made
[1:08:22] up of all ages we're just a portion but
[1:08:25] without us they can't be being perfect
[1:08:27] why because what's unveiled to us is the
[1:08:30] headstone
[1:08:33] this is the revelation we step into amen
[1:08:36] is a stone of stumbling and offense to
[1:08:39] others but a glorious stone and a
[1:08:42] revelation to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:45] because it's her Capstone
[1:08:48] it's not a public show he comes and
[1:08:50] reveals himself only to his bride that's
[1:08:52] a mystery
[1:08:54] amen amen all right we'll get into that
[1:08:56] in just a moment
[1:08:58] all right Revelations 20 verse 4 and I
[1:09:00] saw Thrones
[1:09:02] and they that sat upon them and judgment
[1:09:04] was given unto them
[1:09:07] amen speaking of the Bride here and I
[1:09:09] saw the souls of them that were beheaded
[1:09:12] for the witness of Jesus and for the
[1:09:14] word of God and which had not worshiped
[1:09:17] the Beast neither his image neither had
[1:09:20] received his Mark upon their foreheads
[1:09:22] or in their hands and they lived and
[1:09:24] reigned with Christ A Thousand Years
[1:09:30] we know that's the bride
[1:09:33] bride alone the prophet said that's the
[1:09:35] bride that's absolutely the brighter
[1:09:37] self right there
[1:09:39] but the rest of the Dead live not again
[1:09:42] until the thousand years were finished
[1:09:44] this is now he's talking about the one
[1:09:47] that's pertaining to the bride this is
[1:09:49] the first resurrection
[1:09:51] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[1:09:55] the First Resurrection on which the
[1:09:56] second death hath no power but they
[1:09:59] shall be Priests of God in Christ and
[1:10:01] shall reign with him a thousand years
[1:10:06] amen that's
[1:10:09] what I'm heading for
[1:10:11] that's what I love him for
[1:10:14] is he'll bring me there he promised it
[1:10:17] why because I'm walking with him the
[1:10:20] token
[1:10:22] we'll come into that in just a minute
[1:10:24] all right
[1:10:25] now
[1:10:28] sermon
[1:10:29] I don't remember the name of them but
[1:10:31] 54.
[1:10:34] that's the year you'll hear me quote
[1:10:35] these 54 103 morning paragraph 102 not
[1:10:40] just those who are good people
[1:10:42] see this in other words in the judgment
[1:10:44] will be others there'll be it won't be
[1:10:47] just those who are good people they they
[1:10:49] the good people there will be good
[1:10:51] people that'll certainly miss the first
[1:10:53] resurrection the Bible said and the rest
[1:10:55] of the Dead live not until the thousand
[1:10:57] years were finished so it's more than
[1:10:59] just being good
[1:11:00] I believe in being good
[1:11:02] but good isn't going to put you in a
[1:11:04] Rapture it takes a new birth
[1:11:09] and that can't be happening without the
[1:11:11] power of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:12] to do so
[1:11:14] that's a spiritual birth in your soul
[1:11:18] that old Nature has to die you've got to
[1:11:21] die you've got to die in order to
[1:11:22] resurrect you've got to die to be born
[1:11:24] again
[1:11:26] amen you've got to die to that first
[1:11:29] nature that first husband
[1:11:32] not let him just put him on a shelf and
[1:11:34] continue just to pet him once in a while
[1:11:35] in your life
[1:11:37] he must die
[1:11:39] I know Nature's got to die
[1:11:43] to be born again
[1:11:46] because the new birth is a resurrection
[1:11:50] amen you've passed from Death unto life
[1:11:52] you've raised up in your heart your soul
[1:11:54] is raised
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:58] you're living in the newness of Life a
[1:12:00] new creature
[1:12:02] the old things are passed away that
[1:12:04] first husband has no more jurisdiction
[1:12:06] over you he's dead he's eternally dead
[1:12:08] you are eternally separated from him
[1:12:14] amen all right now
[1:12:17] foreign
[1:12:20] he said and the Bible said the rest of
[1:12:23] the Dead lived not till a thousand years
[1:12:25] were finished is that right
[1:12:26] the that's those who had their names
[1:12:29] written in the Lamb's Book of Life but
[1:12:31] refused the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:34] now I'm going to stop here just a minute
[1:12:35] and I'm going to jump forward just a
[1:12:37] little bit
[1:12:38] and bring to you another
[1:12:40] quote here
[1:12:41] and I just feel to bring it at this time
[1:12:52] laughs
[1:12:55] foreign
[1:12:59] he said some say
[1:13:03] that the book of life is not the Lamb's
[1:13:05] Book of Life
[1:13:08] but as usual when one regards a verse
[1:13:11] superficially he comes up with a
[1:13:13] superficial understanding
[1:13:21] at the very start of our study let it be
[1:13:23] known that there is not one scripture
[1:13:25] that teaches God is presently compiling
[1:13:27] a record of names
[1:13:32] this was all done before the foundation
[1:13:35] of the world
[1:13:38] all right
[1:13:40] you can't be something you're not
[1:13:43] you either have a true draw strong and
[1:13:45] desire for God or you don't down in that
[1:13:48] soul
[1:13:51] I said the soul
[1:13:54] not just your spirit your soul
[1:13:58] you've got to have God that's all there
[1:14:00] is to it
[1:14:01] and you can only hear one voice and
[1:14:03] that's the voice of Our Lord speak
[1:14:07] amen because he said my sheep know my
[1:14:10] voice and a stranger they will not
[1:14:12] follow
[1:14:15] all right now
[1:14:17] so there's nothing saying that there's
[1:14:19] presently a compiling of names
[1:14:25] and he said that he's because you think
[1:14:28] well I've got a new name written on the
[1:14:29] glory no that's untruth
[1:14:33] your name was written before the
[1:14:34] foundation of the world it's on the Book
[1:14:36] of Life a place there
[1:14:38] now I'm going to say this and I'm going
[1:14:40] to come to it not in this service but
[1:14:42] it'll be
[1:14:43] later on
[1:14:44] your name can be in that book of life
[1:14:49] and be removed
[1:14:57] that's the mystery
[1:14:59] that we're going to cover
[1:15:01] judas's name was removed but he was
[1:15:04] chosen of God and he had his name on The
[1:15:06] Book of Life
[1:15:08] foreign
[1:15:10] think of that
[1:15:14] amen and it was blotted out brother
[1:15:17] Branham uses the word blotted out
[1:15:20] the same blood that
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:25] the same blood the same water that saved
[1:15:27] Noah destroyed the unbeliever
[1:15:32] the same blood that saves you can blot
[1:15:35] out
[1:15:39] think of that
[1:15:42] amen I'll just leave that with you for a
[1:15:44] while because we're going to talk about
[1:15:45] that
[1:15:46] later on Lord willing
[1:15:49] I'm not covering it now okay in this
[1:15:52] section
[1:15:54] now so
[1:15:56] you know what that ought to do to all of
[1:15:58] us
[1:16:00] we ought to set up and take notice where
[1:16:01] am I standing today
[1:16:06] this bride may be yet today
[1:16:10] is going to come up missing
[1:16:12] and some are going to be left here
[1:16:18] that is an actual fact
[1:16:22] that there's a move on for the of God
[1:16:25] there's a move on
[1:16:26] and it's thus saith the Lord the move is
[1:16:29] on for the bride
[1:16:34] something's happening we're marching
[1:16:36] whether you want to march with us or not
[1:16:38] we're marching
[1:16:41] in step with the word for the season
[1:16:45] and not fooling around with a bunch of
[1:16:48] other things that want to stick their
[1:16:49] heads up and and put themselves between
[1:16:51] you and God
[1:16:53] I don't want to get started on that
[1:16:55] because I can get going on that but
[1:16:57] that's the very thing that moved their
[1:16:58] names away
[1:17:00] was idolatry
[1:17:05] amen all right let's let's go on what
[1:17:08] we've had here
[1:17:11] we will actually show by scriptures
[1:17:14] by by the scripture that multitudes were
[1:17:17] not even who were not even born again
[1:17:19] will go into
[1:17:22] eternal life at the judgment
[1:17:26] as strange as that may sound it is
[1:17:29] certainly true
[1:17:32] and this is what we'll cover later on I
[1:17:34] don't have time this morning who are
[1:17:36] they
[1:17:37] and how do they get and give an eternal
[1:17:39] they're given eternal life they do not
[1:17:41] have a possession now they never will
[1:17:43] but at the white Throne judgment
[1:17:46] their Works testify
[1:17:48] they they can be given eternal life
[1:17:56] but there's a secret to that oh you say
[1:17:57] well see there if I'm not here and not
[1:17:59] but my Works will sure no
[1:18:02] they didn't even know what they did
[1:18:07] see you can't produce it by works
[1:18:10] you're going to be what you are in your
[1:18:12] heart
[1:18:12] I'm going to tell you right now every
[1:18:14] one of us are going to be exactly what
[1:18:16] we are in our heart today
[1:18:18] right now and right on to the end you
[1:18:21] can't change that
[1:18:28] hmm
[1:18:29] that makes us think deeply
[1:18:34] deeply
[1:18:37] where are you identified
[1:18:40] where are you presently standing where
[1:18:42] are you identified
[1:18:50] we will show that there is a group I
[1:18:53] just after reading that certainly true
[1:18:54] we'll show that there's a Greek group of
[1:18:56] people whose names having been placed on
[1:18:59] that record
[1:19:03] on that record Lamb's Book of Life Book
[1:19:05] of Life on that record
[1:19:08] before the foundation of the world
[1:19:10] cannot under any circumstances have
[1:19:12] those names removed
[1:19:14] under any
[1:19:17] circumstances
[1:19:20] amen now you think well God wouldn't do
[1:19:23] a thing like that you've got to remember
[1:19:24] something and keep in mind God is
[1:19:26] Sovereign he does what he wants
[1:19:29] and what he does is perfect
[1:19:33] and he makes choices by foreknowledge
[1:19:36] to say well I'm going to choose this one
[1:19:38] leave this one no he does that because
[1:19:40] he knew you before the world began he
[1:19:43] knew you'd be seated right here in what
[1:19:44] was going through your mind and what's
[1:19:46] going through your mind will meet you
[1:19:48] again at judgment
[1:19:49] right now
[1:19:52] you can be sitting here waving your head
[1:19:54] up and down and be a hundred miles from
[1:19:55] this place traveling on your thought
[1:20:00] right
[1:20:02] amen well I'm just here everybody knows
[1:20:06] I can I can pretend no let's not be a
[1:20:09] deceiver let's be genuine from our soul
[1:20:14] you either wanted to you didn't want to
[1:20:16] be here
[1:20:18] that's exactly right
[1:20:21] amen pretty straight isn't it
[1:20:24] teaching's pretty cutting
[1:20:27] listen now all right just give me your
[1:20:30] undivided attention
[1:20:32] to begin with
[1:20:35] I mean you haven't begun yet paragraph
[1:20:37] 107 to begin with
[1:20:40] there is no basis for the claims that
[1:20:43] the book of life is not the same as
[1:20:45] excuse me let me read that again to
[1:20:47] begin with there is no basis for the
[1:20:49] claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is
[1:20:52] not the same as the Book of Life
[1:20:58] now there's a mystery or a secret for
[1:21:00] that we're going to cover that Lord
[1:21:01] willing this morning before we close
[1:21:04] The Book of Life might be called the
[1:21:06] Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's Book of
[1:21:10] Life or even the book or even thy book
[1:21:13] and also called The Book of the living
[1:21:18] it's referred that way through the Bible
[1:21:19] all right same book
[1:21:24] only names are written in it
[1:21:29] paragraph 91 if you want to look it up
[1:21:32] names means people
[1:21:36] names means people
[1:21:41] so when you see that only names are
[1:21:43] written only people individuals are
[1:21:45] written there
[1:21:48] amen they're judged by their works when
[1:21:51] the books was opened means the book of
[1:21:52] your life is absolutely uncovered we'll
[1:21:57] come to what the prophet just said about
[1:21:58] that just right quick
[1:22:02] you can see that though there are other
[1:22:04] books mentioned
[1:22:05] at the Judgment the books and then the
[1:22:09] book
[1:22:11] books were opened and then another book
[1:22:13] all right then you can see then that
[1:22:17] there is always a reference to one book
[1:22:21] containing names
[1:22:24] amen
[1:22:26] I'm laying this Foundation to you you
[1:22:28] can see then that there's only one book
[1:22:31] go back to scripture there's only one
[1:22:33] book containing names
[1:22:38] or people foreign
[1:22:42] containing the name in the individuals
[1:22:45] people
[1:22:47] he said in the Revelation it's called
[1:22:49] The blam's Book of Life or The Book of
[1:22:51] Life referred to both ways in the Book
[1:22:54] of Revelation
[1:23:00] all right
[1:23:02] let's continue on in that message we're
[1:23:04] reading
[1:23:07] so the rest of the Dead lived not until
[1:23:09] the thousand years were finished is that
[1:23:11] right that's those who had their names
[1:23:13] written in the Lamb's Book of Life but
[1:23:15] refused the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:20] all right they had the opportunity see
[1:23:23] but they couldn't come into it
[1:23:27] how many times have we said you can't
[1:23:29] stop at sanctification you said but I
[1:23:32] have been born I have been I have been
[1:23:34] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:36] Christ isn't that enough no
[1:23:40] you must go on and receive
[1:23:42] you either receive it or at your baptism
[1:23:44] or you're going to go on and receive it
[1:23:46] and don't stop there at sanctification
[1:23:48] the blood can sanctify you live a good
[1:23:50] clean holy life and still not have the
[1:23:53] Holy Ghost you'll still not be born
[1:23:54] again
[1:23:55] such are those in Matthew 25.
[1:23:58] foolish virgins
[1:24:02] amen
[1:24:03] they did not have the oil
[1:24:08] and yet they could they could do
[1:24:10] everything under sanctification yet they
[1:24:12] couldn't discern their hour and time
[1:24:14] they lived in
[1:24:16] amen that's right all right now
[1:24:19] let's go on
[1:24:21] he said
[1:24:23] just the elect goes in that time what's
[1:24:26] he talking about the Millennium just the
[1:24:27] elect takes the Millennium oh then
[1:24:30] brother what type of people should we be
[1:24:31] I want to live through the millennium
[1:24:34] let's lay aside every weight and the sin
[1:24:36] that does so easily beset us if the
[1:24:39] fellow says something wrong or does
[1:24:40] something this away pray for him and
[1:24:42] keep moving on
[1:24:46] let you your one alternative be set
[1:24:48] towards God
[1:24:50] if nobody helps make it you make it if
[1:24:54] nobody else makes it you make it that
[1:24:57] should be our determination
[1:25:00] it's not that I'm a part of a group and
[1:25:02] what they think about it I'm an
[1:25:03] individual before God Alone
[1:25:07] I must make my calling and my election
[1:25:09] sure and God's given you that that
[1:25:12] ability or that at that that
[1:25:16] the message to do that through
[1:25:20] amen he's not left you with any given
[1:25:23] you the tools to make your calling an
[1:25:25] election sure feed on the open word feed
[1:25:28] on the book
[1:25:31] let that be first place in your life let
[1:25:34] Christ the kingdom of God his
[1:25:36] righteousness be first place in all that
[1:25:38] you do let nothing come before you and
[1:25:41] him
[1:25:42] let that be your determination
[1:25:45] let it be a sole determination
[1:25:52] amen
[1:25:54] if nobody else make it you make it
[1:25:57] for there's going to be an elect who's
[1:25:58] going to live through Millennium and
[1:26:00] will go and will go in and out with
[1:26:03] Christ for a thousand years and then
[1:26:05] they shall go up into glory and with him
[1:26:07] and return When the resurrection of the
[1:26:10] wicked is brought forth the Millennium
[1:26:12] after the Millennium is over and before
[1:26:14] and and and aft and be and Christ will
[1:26:17] go into the Millennium with his bride
[1:26:20] and at the end of the thousand years he
[1:26:22] will return with the church
[1:26:25] return to what
[1:26:27] king and queen
[1:26:30] there is no
[1:26:33] bride will never be judged she's already
[1:26:37] judged
[1:26:42] all right we're coming into that and
[1:26:44] then the great king and queen comes down
[1:26:46] for judgment after the Millennium the
[1:26:48] white Throne judgment set the books
[1:26:51] plural were opened and there stands the

[1:29:30] that I am to be Jesus Christ in his
[1:29:33] mercy and his grace
[1:29:36] and that has and as freely as I've

[1:29:46] and filled and already translated in
[1:29:47] other words that we're now seated
[1:29:49] already now seated in Heavenly places in

[1:30:03] chosen he's already glorified
[1:30:06] amen
[1:30:09] it was a finished work at Calvary and
[1:30:12] when he that finished that one that
[1:30:13] finished that work came in and took the
[1:30:15] book to claim what he redeemed my name
[1:30:18] was in there
[1:30:23] uh where was that book Brother David
[1:30:27] oh
[1:30:28] that book
[1:30:30] Revelations 10 2 that book
[1:30:33] was in The Book of Life
[1:30:38] he said there's only one book there is
[1:30:41] but there's parts of that book
[1:30:46] oh now you really got us into turmoil no
[1:30:48] I don't listen
[1:30:52] all right see this I'm just glad I'm
[1:30:54] thankful for a prophet today
[1:30:57] that God sent that truth down to and
[1:31:00] unveiled these Mysteries to them that he
[1:31:02] purposed was in him
[1:31:05] to reveal that mystery too
[1:31:08] I'm glad to be in that mystery I'm glad
[1:31:10] to be that mystery unveiled
[1:31:15] I'll say it again I'm glad by the grace
[1:31:17] of God to be that mystery
[1:31:20] unveiled
[1:31:22] because the mystery that God would be
[1:31:24] finished at the message of the seventh
[1:31:26] angel
[1:31:28] amen
[1:31:30] why would I be
[1:31:34] so I don't believe that Brother David
[1:31:36] it's all right I do
[1:31:43] it's an individual fair right
[1:31:44] I do
[1:31:46] I know it
[1:31:48] I'm walking with him
[1:31:53] what could the Enoch say be in the
[1:31:55] seventh from Adam I wonder what he said
[1:31:57] how you doing brother Enoch I'm perfect
[1:32:01] well you're a man yes I am but I'm
[1:32:04] walking with God
[1:32:07] Jesus said I'll not only be with you
[1:32:10] now but I'll be in you
[1:32:18] that is the bride's identification
[1:32:23] that's not a hope so
[1:32:25] that is absolutely a divine revelation
[1:32:27] to her
[1:32:31] well I just don't quite see it Brother
[1:32:33] David keep eating the book
[1:32:35] keep feeding on the promised word
[1:32:38] open up your heart and ask God to reveal
[1:32:40] his word to you
[1:32:42] don't
[1:32:44] just hope I'm in
[1:32:46] he never asked you to hope you are he
[1:32:49] said I'll give you the substance that
[1:32:51] you are
[1:32:57] the faith
[1:32:59] amen there's a face seen today there's a
[1:33:02] face seed on the Earth today where's
[1:33:04] that face Seed where is that Christ that
[1:33:07] we believe is that Royal Seed where is
[1:33:09] she
[1:33:10] she's he's in bright form
[1:33:19] all right
[1:33:21] say it the most Sublime words in the
[1:33:24] whole message is this she is him
[1:33:31] or I can say he is her
[1:33:37] he is she
[1:33:39] I like seeing that song he is she let's
[1:33:42] make a song out of that one
[1:33:45] amen
[1:33:47] but you know where God's focus is today
[1:33:50] on her
[1:33:52] that's his message
[1:33:56] it had to proceed from the prophet to
[1:33:58] his prophecy so therefore we are in the
[1:34:01] days of Elisha
[1:34:07] there had to be coming forth of a from
[1:34:11] the prophet he said I've introduced you
[1:34:12] to him I must decrease
[1:34:14] but he must increase
[1:34:17] where was he increasing Elijah did four
[1:34:20] Miracles Elisha did what eight
[1:34:23] where did it increase
[1:34:28] in the form of his wife
[1:34:33] she had
[1:34:34] his mental
[1:34:39] there's a whole message on that don't
[1:34:40] you steal it really Chris
[1:34:43] you be careful now I got I've got a
[1:34:46] copyright on that
[1:34:50] this is the days of Elisha
[1:34:54] I've already got it written down as a
[1:34:55] heading now
[1:35:05] just have patience with me I'll get to
[1:35:07] it
[1:35:08] all right
[1:35:13] now
[1:35:15] let's go
[1:35:20] so where is this book this Lamb's Book
[1:35:23] This Book of Life located
[1:35:26] Jesus answers that it's located in
[1:35:28] heaven
[1:35:29] said not we're standing in this Rejoice
[1:35:32] the spirits are subject unto you but
[1:35:33] rather Rejoice because your names are
[1:35:35] written in heaven
[1:35:38] the branch said see they're written and
[1:35:40] their names were written in heaven your
[1:35:42] name's written in heaven Rejoice not the
[1:35:45] spirits the subject unto you but Rejoice
[1:35:46] that your names are written in heaven he
[1:35:49] was talking to the seventy which left
[1:35:51] him by the way
[1:35:53] is that right
[1:35:55] they turned their back on him
[1:35:58] they rejected the word a promise
[1:36:00] manifested in flesh in their day
[1:36:03] what's the people rejecting today the
[1:36:05] same word manifested in flesh today he's
[1:36:07] made flesh in the way they didn't view
[1:36:09] him to be
[1:36:10] that's the mystery
[1:36:13] it's Christ in Bride form
[1:36:17] it's called The Bride coming
[1:36:19] of Christ
[1:36:22] all right now and that's the mystery of
[1:36:26] the seventh seal
[1:36:29] which is the rebel is the message of
[1:36:31] Revelations the seventh angel of
[1:36:33] Revelation 10. that's his message
[1:36:37] I could I'm not going to spend a lot of
[1:36:39] time in that because I could leave
[1:36:40] everything else and just go preach the
[1:36:42] seventh seal now but this is beyond that
[1:36:47] brother bran said This is the End of
[1:36:49] Time of all things this prepares you for
[1:36:52] that
[1:36:53] the seventh seal prepares you for the
[1:36:55] judgment
[1:36:56] to judge
[1:36:58] I'm talking to the bride
[1:37:00] amen all right
[1:37:03] if we didn't have that opening
[1:37:06] there would be no Rapture for the bride
[1:37:11] amen if those Seven Seals were not
[1:37:13] opened there would be no rapture
[1:37:17] it hinged on that right there
[1:37:23] and they've done been opened
[1:37:25] it's too bad you haven't sought it odd
[1:37:28] enough to see what it is and it pertains
[1:37:30] to you
[1:37:31] you you you you you me
[1:37:35] time we ought to look into it don't you
[1:37:37] think
[1:37:39] feed on it
[1:37:42] this message been around a few years
[1:37:44] what if the door's closed
[1:37:49] and the only ones that are left in is
[1:37:50] the bride what if it is I'm not saying
[1:37:52] it is what if it is if you still got a
[1:37:55] pull for him you better yield to that
[1:37:57] pull and not to your games and your
[1:38:00] videos and your things that you think
[1:38:02] you need to do
[1:38:08] you don't realize the sincere the the
[1:38:10] desperation of this hour
[1:38:13] you're playing around you can't play
[1:38:15] with this message no longer I say that
[1:38:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus you can't
[1:38:20] play with this message no longer
[1:38:31] all right
[1:38:34] let's go on and keep reading
[1:38:39] the books are open that's the book of
[1:38:42] your life when the Bible said the books
[1:38:44] were opened at the Judgment it's the
[1:38:46] books of your life
[1:38:49] in other words it's the record of your
[1:38:52] life it is but it becomes naked
[1:38:58] from the time you were born that record
[1:39:00] starts until the time you die in this
[1:39:03] life it quits and it's put in God's
[1:39:05] Library
[1:39:06] and it will come again right before
[1:39:09] everyone
[1:39:10] and you're going to face
[1:39:12] those thoughts those those attitudes
[1:39:19] amen I'm talking about every one of us
[1:39:25] this is a sobering moment it ought to be
[1:39:27] very sobering
[1:39:30] because we're right on the threshold
[1:39:31] right now very close very very very
[1:39:34] close to see the bride gone
[1:39:38] amen because she recognizes her day of
[1:39:40] her coming
[1:39:43] his coming
[1:39:51] and she's caught up in that
[1:39:53] amen exactly
[1:39:55] all right
[1:40:00] every man was judged thus the book of
[1:40:03] your life was open and every man was
[1:40:05] judged thus how were they judged by the
[1:40:07] book
[1:40:10] your name had to be in that book if it
[1:40:12] wasn't in that book your Works were not
[1:40:15] found in that book your cast as a goat
[1:40:21] Amen in that day
[1:40:28] something to think about something we
[1:40:30] ought to consider very deeply
[1:40:33] amen and something we ought to put
[1:40:36] number one in our life are we pleasing
[1:40:39] you Lord
[1:40:40] am I pleasing you by the things I say
[1:40:42] and do am I pleasing you by the way I
[1:40:44] dress am I plea what is my motive and
[1:40:46] objective
[1:40:48] when I come to church I don't like that
[1:40:50] preacher I don't like him but I'll act
[1:40:52] like a real believer
[1:40:56] be careful
[1:40:58] because God knows your heart he's
[1:41:02] already identified he knows where you
[1:41:04] live he knows your name he knows what
[1:41:06] you thought about this morning he knows
[1:41:08] what you're thinking now and he knows
[1:41:10] everything about you
[1:41:12] and where you're going to be tomorrow
[1:41:14] and where you're going to be when you
[1:41:16] walk out of this building he knows
[1:41:18] everything we ought to realize
[1:41:21] he knows you you couldn't hide any you
[1:41:24] might hide yourself from man and you
[1:41:26] might be very religious and and because
[1:41:28] I go to church and I have message books
[1:41:30] and I have tapes and I can hear hear
[1:41:32] yeah but what is it doing where are you
[1:41:35] at
[1:41:37] we don't make this message this message
[1:41:40] is not a religion
[1:41:42] it is eternal life
[1:41:50] all right
[1:41:54] when you were born I know I'm running
[1:41:55] just a little bit off here just be bear
[1:41:58] with me when them had done and went home
[1:42:00] and received their glorified bodies them
[1:42:02] talking about the bride and lived
[1:42:04] through the Millennium and was here in
[1:42:06] the white Throne judgment judging those
[1:42:08] he said would separate the sheep from
[1:42:10] the goats
[1:42:12] now they're not literally goats let me
[1:42:14] just let's let me just refer something
[1:42:15] to you here
[1:42:18] further clarify the words of Matthew and
[1:42:20] he's referring to Matthew 25 it does not
[1:42:23] say that as a that that a Shepherd is
[1:42:25] literally separating sheep from goats
[1:42:27] but it is as a Shepherd dividing sheep
[1:42:30] from goats these are not sheep in this
[1:42:32] particular area of a Time white Throne
[1:42:34] judgment the Sheep are in the fold they
[1:42:36] heard his voice the word and followed
[1:42:39] him they are already they already have
[1:42:41] eternal life and that cannot come into
[1:42:43] the judgment
[1:42:45] the Sheep are his bride but in the
[1:42:48] Judgment he's separating
[1:42:50] as a Shepherd would sheep from goats
[1:42:54] how's he doing that by the word
[1:42:57] The Book of Life all right
[1:43:01] all right I want to clarify that
[1:43:04] now we know and I'm going to bypass some
[1:43:06] of this now
[1:43:08] there's a great record
[1:43:10] and of course science television
[1:43:12] declares that right through this room
[1:43:15] right now is traveling people cloth you
[1:43:18] know colors all kinds of things and
[1:43:20] because they manufactured something and
[1:43:21] picked that up called television what
[1:43:24] about at the Rapture what about I mean
[1:43:26] at the judgment
[1:43:31] all right now
[1:43:34] see I know
[1:43:36] there's a record
[1:43:44] do they rig oh God do they realize that
[1:43:47] every word we say
[1:43:49] it's on a record it starts when we start
[1:43:51] living in this earth and it ends when we
[1:43:53] die and it's put in God's album to be
[1:43:55] played back again at the Judgment or how
[1:43:57] are we going to escape it the damnation
[1:43:59] of God if the thing has been made so
[1:44:01] clear before us and yet we turn it down
[1:44:07] that's right just make it so clear
[1:44:09] before us you believe you're Believers I
[1:44:11] could come right now and preach a
[1:44:12] message on communion to you why don't
[1:44:14] you take communion
[1:44:16] you claim to be Believers it's a
[1:44:18] showdown time if you don't take it you
[1:44:21] have no part with him
[1:44:24] and if you take it unworthily not being
[1:44:26] born of the spirit you're giving false
[1:44:28] witness of what you say you believe
[1:44:32] it's a showdown
[1:44:36] amen go back and search and see if he
[1:44:38] didn't say that
[1:44:40] and you won't take it why don't you take
[1:44:42] it you claim to be a believer in the
[1:44:44] message you claim to believe the message
[1:44:45] why aren't you taking it
[1:44:49] you won't do this in remember himself
[1:44:51] it's probably because you've been taught
[1:44:53] something else that's contrary to the
[1:44:55] word this doing remembrance to me as
[1:44:58] long as you're
[1:45:00] here
[1:45:01] on this side
[1:45:04] I'm going to believe that
[1:45:07] but what is God he's interested in that
[1:45:09] you being right and obey his word if you
[1:45:11] don't obey him you don't love him
[1:45:18] I'm not saying well every time I got to
[1:45:19] be a communion but to refuse it
[1:45:22] every single time
[1:45:24] what's God think about it I just told
[1:45:26] you
[1:45:31] you say Brother David you don't have to
[1:45:32] be so hard I am not hard I love you with
[1:45:34] all my heart but I love you because I
[1:45:36] love you I'm going to tell you the truth
[1:45:41] you may hate me I don't care what you
[1:45:43] think about me I'm not concerned about
[1:45:45] that I'm not driven by that one thing
[1:45:47] I'm driven by is what God thinks about
[1:45:49] me
[1:45:52] and that's the way you ought to think
[1:45:56] doesn't matter what the rest of them
[1:45:57] think
[1:45:58] if I base myself on what people well
[1:46:01] they had they didn't like it or they did
[1:46:02] like it or
[1:46:05] what a mess I would be in
[1:46:09] we are I have no confidence even in this
[1:46:12] old boy none but I do have confidence in
[1:46:15] that token that's in me and I'm going to
[1:46:16] apply that token over this
[1:46:19] God help me to apply the token you've
[1:46:22] got to apply the token
[1:46:26] what is the token the literal life of
[1:46:28] Jesus Christ in you God himself in you
[1:46:31] love in you there is no perfect love
[1:46:33] outside of God dwelling in you you can
[1:46:36] have love but it's not perfect until God
[1:46:38] comes in you and lives his life
[1:46:42] amen
[1:46:43] then and then only is that life perfect
[1:46:45] that word that love perfect because God
[1:46:47] is in you
[1:46:48] and God is that perfect love
[1:46:52] you can love God from your spirit and
[1:46:54] still be lost
[1:46:57] did you know that you didn't know that
[1:47:00] oh yeah
[1:47:02] yep
[1:47:03] unless God's dwelling inside abiding
[1:47:06] living in your soul
[1:47:10] that's
[1:47:13] that is what casts out fear
[1:47:18] amen
[1:47:20] so apply the token what do you have to
[1:47:22] fear about if you are walking with God
[1:47:24] what do you fear
[1:47:26] you're walking with him
[1:47:28] Enoch was the seventh of Adam a type of
[1:47:30] our day right now
[1:47:33] Edom had a testimony he lived by
[1:47:35] raptured Faith by faith Enoch was
[1:47:37] translated that he was not found
[1:47:40] amen what did it Revelation faith
[1:47:44] amen
[1:47:48] I'm moving very quickly because I've got
[1:47:50] to get over here
[1:47:53] okay it starts
[1:47:55] your words never die you know every word
[1:47:57] you speak will never die
[1:47:59] and every vain word will be judged so
[1:48:02] see we need the blood every day to keep
[1:48:04] us clean
[1:48:05] how do we know the blood's applied
[1:48:07] because the Holy Ghost in that life of
[1:48:09] that blood is in you living that's the
[1:48:11] token
[1:48:14] amen then we can apply the token
[1:48:17] apply the blood
[1:48:19] well I just believe in the blood it's
[1:48:21] got to be more than just believing the
[1:48:22] blood you've got to have the life of the
[1:48:24] blood
[1:48:25] showing you went behind that veil of
[1:48:28] blood into the very inside of the inside
[1:48:30] the holiest of holies you meet God face
[1:48:32] to face you must have that face-to-face
[1:48:35] meeting with God
[1:48:40] amen
[1:48:42] you see where we come short
[1:48:45] there's only one group of people that
[1:48:47] are truly born again
[1:48:49] that's the bride
[1:48:51] and few there be that find it but are
[1:48:54] you one of the few
[1:48:59] well I want to be then pursue it
[1:49:03] what are you hanging back for what are
[1:49:05] you trusting in
[1:49:06] what are you relying upon
[1:49:12] there's only one that's perfect
[1:49:14] his word is perfect there's only one
[1:49:16] original word and that was God's word
[1:49:21] well I don't know brother branham's a
[1:49:23] false prophet then you show me the real
[1:49:25] one
[1:49:26] because a real one had to come first
[1:49:28] before you have a false one
[1:49:32] sin is a perversion of original of the
[1:49:34] truth
[1:49:35] unbelief is only a perversion of Truth
[1:49:38] there had to be an original first before
[1:49:40] he could have any copy
[1:49:42] you can say well that's a copy then show
[1:49:44] me the real one if you can't show me the
[1:49:46] real one then you then you are then then
[1:49:49] you think you're the real
[1:49:56] but you don't line up with the original
[1:49:58] word
[1:49:59] you have an original word brother sister
[1:50:02] remember these men that follow brother
[1:50:04] Branham they caught the vision of
[1:50:05] casting out devils and miracles and
[1:50:07] signs and wonders with like Janice and
[1:50:09] jambres that went behind him and then
[1:50:11] did everything he did you think he said
[1:50:13] hey here you can't do that no he just
[1:50:14] let him alone he was only commanded to
[1:50:17] do what God told him to do that was
[1:50:19] original
[1:50:23] look at the original look at what went
[1:50:25] first Moses went forth then Janice and
[1:50:27] jambres
[1:50:29] but until Moses had the original word of
[1:50:31] God Janice and jambres could do nothing
[1:50:33] Satan can do nothing he's powerless his
[1:50:36] only power is to pervert the original
[1:50:41] amen amen and when you catch that
[1:50:43] Revelation you're catching something
[1:50:47] amen all right
[1:50:54] everything you thought
[1:50:56] what was in their thinking will be known
[1:50:58] at the day of judgment
[1:51:00] every thought
[1:51:02] what the intents are
[1:51:06] he knows all about it I'm just going to
[1:51:08] say it doesn't matter the color clothes
[1:51:09] you wear and everything will be
[1:51:10] portrayed right before you
[1:51:12] why you did what you did why you put
[1:51:14] that tight skirt now why you did this
[1:51:16] why you did that when you were told and
[1:51:18] showed it's not right why'd you cut your
[1:51:20] hair why'd you Bob it why'd you cut it
[1:51:22] off
[1:51:23] because you were told of false things
[1:51:25] most likely by a false preacher
[1:51:28] to cut your hair you might as well shave
[1:51:30] it off
[1:51:31] to trim it I've got something I want to
[1:51:33] bring on that later on if you'll bear
[1:51:34] with me
[1:51:35] I mean not in this not today but later a
[1:51:38] true testimony
[1:51:40] of a woman that did that
[1:51:42] and was tempted to do it you just put a
[1:51:45] scissors to that here brother sister
[1:51:47] you've cut it
[1:51:49] it's no longer short
[1:51:51] I mean it's no longer long excuse me
[1:51:55] it's no longer long
[1:51:58] the Bible said you do that you might as
[1:51:59] well shave it off
[1:52:03] the same thing in God's sight
[1:52:05] to keep not one word you trespass in all
[1:52:08] of it
[1:52:10] when you know what to do the do the
[1:52:12] truth and turn away from it
[1:52:15] what then
[1:52:21] all that doesn't matter one little thing
[1:52:23] oh yes it does matter it was just one
[1:52:24] word that threw the whole thing into
[1:52:26] chaos in the beginning because one woman
[1:52:28] trusted the devil to throw her off by
[1:52:31] one word
[1:52:34] amen
[1:52:38] and you're going to get by with this not
[1:52:40] believing one word
[1:52:43] amen that's the truth
[1:52:45] all right
[1:52:46] all right
[1:52:49] nothing happens but what he knows it's
[1:52:51] recorded
[1:52:55] I'm going to get down to something here
[1:52:56] and I'm going to be done
[1:52:58] I'm going to take his law about as long
[1:53:00] as your pastor did last time
[1:53:04] I didn't hear an Amen on that
[1:53:09] no it's not about my brother's sister
[1:53:11] forgive me for even mentioning it I'm
[1:53:14] going to do what the Lord leads me to do
[1:53:18] amen if we can't set
[1:53:20] in a little bit of time and hear the
[1:53:22] word of God what's wrong with this
[1:53:27] maybe some laodicea is coming in
[1:53:31] amen amen all right I say me too God
[1:53:36] keep me from it
[1:53:38] let me die daily
[1:53:41] let me take up my cross
[1:53:43] and follow you
[1:53:46] deny myself
[1:53:55] now he knows all about it he knows
[1:53:57] whether you love him he knows whether
[1:53:58] your intentions are right to serve him
[1:54:00] he knows all about it and what will it
[1:54:02] be when you stand in that day and every
[1:54:04] sins naked before him and you stand
[1:54:06] there at the white Throne judgment
[1:54:08] how do we do that says now I'm going to
[1:54:11] go I'm going to take a little step on
[1:54:13] further here and just go on to something
[1:54:14] else
[1:54:16] not something else actually but just go
[1:54:18] on
[1:54:28] this is 1960 12 11 morning
[1:54:31] paragraph 35 how do we do that we come
[1:54:34] into Christ and are baptized into one
[1:54:36] body First Corinthians 12 one body we're
[1:54:39] baptized into the body of Jesus Christ
[1:54:41] and God has already judged that body how
[1:54:44] he could not he could not stand
[1:54:47] Us in judgment again because he's
[1:54:49] already judged that body and by the
[1:54:51] permission and Grace of Christ he brings
[1:54:54] us into himself First Corinthians 12 by
[1:54:56] one Spirit we're all baptized or birthed
[1:54:58] into that one body
[1:55:00] and free from all judgments
[1:55:03] because he stood because he's done stood
[1:55:06] the judgments oh aren't you so thankful
[1:55:09] for him he took the judgments for us
[1:55:12] she is the only one place provided that
[1:55:15] God put his name into worship that's in
[1:55:17] his body and how do you get into it by
[1:55:19] one Spirit are you baptized into that
[1:55:23] one body
[1:55:25] amen
[1:55:28] oh thankful for it he took the judgments
[1:55:31] for us no more judgment now remember
[1:55:33] we're going to deal on that sharply this
[1:55:35] morning
[1:55:36] you're either in that body or out of
[1:55:38] that body
[1:55:40] this morning
[1:55:42] no halfway between it there's no pretty
[1:55:45] good Christians

[1:55:49] Christian
[1:55:50] and I'm going to tell you Christian is
[1:55:52] loose this morning you want me to tell
[1:55:54] you what a Christian is christ-like
[1:55:56] and Christ is the word
[1:55:59] Christ to be a Christian means you are
[1:56:01] tabernacling himself deity
[1:56:04] in you
[1:56:08] okay he's opened up that word in you
[1:56:11] it's a revelation of himself in you
[1:56:13] and you see him performing that doing
[1:56:16] that because you can say oh I'm a i i i
[1:56:19] why I've done this I preached in your
[1:56:21] name I've cast out Devils your name I've
[1:56:23] done all these things but he said depart
[1:56:24] from me you work of iniquity I never
[1:56:26] knew you he said many will come saying
[1:56:28] Lord Lord
[1:56:30] he said
[1:56:31] but he he says who is he that's in me is
[1:56:35] he that doeth the will of my father
[1:56:38] do it
[1:56:39] the doer comes in to do it the doer
[1:56:42] comes in and keeps you in line with the
[1:56:44] word
[1:56:45] how can you be in line with the word
[1:56:47] when even won't even respect your
[1:56:49] husband how can you be in line with the
[1:56:51] word when you're out of the word trying
[1:56:52] to take authority over a home
[1:56:56] we're given that
[1:56:59] and sidestep your own husband's desires
[1:57:01] and go in the way thing he'll never know
[1:57:03] it anyway
[1:57:05] and you say you're in the word
[1:57:11] okay
[1:57:12] I'll just let the husbands choose that
[1:57:14] pray that God will open some eyes
[1:57:18] you let her lead you around
[1:57:20] who's leading anyway
[1:57:25] she wasn't meant to be your leader
[1:57:29] I'm not talking about just disc cut and
[1:57:31] dry just uh legalism I'm talking about
[1:57:34] spiritual actual reality here
[1:57:38] you don't know your position
[1:57:41] and if she does it you're letting her
[1:57:45] husband you're letting her and you'll
[1:57:47] answer for everything that's contrary to
[1:57:49] that word you'll answer for it
[1:57:52] you better take some authority over it
[1:57:56] things are entering your house and you
[1:57:58] wonder why this is happening why that's
[1:58:00] happening why this is coming in why
[1:58:01] that's coming in because you're flirting
[1:58:03] with the Devil
[1:58:07] amen you're flirting that's all there is
[1:58:09] to it
[1:58:10] you're flirting thinking what's wrong
[1:58:11] with the little little a little
[1:58:13] Fellowship anyway you're fellowshipping
[1:58:15] with the wrong things you're
[1:58:16] fellowshipping with the doctrine of
[1:58:18] Balaam that's what you're fellowshipping
[1:58:19] with
[1:58:22] we're all one
[1:58:23] we all ought to love one another that's
[1:58:26] exactly what he said and God never
[1:58:27] forgave it we aren't one we are
[1:58:30] separated people
[1:58:31] separated unto God himself
[1:58:34] amen
[1:58:38] don't you let that Spirit come over here
[1:58:42] we will allow that Spirit to work itself
[1:58:44] into this assembly
[1:58:47] amen
[1:58:50] don't you bring that thing over into
[1:58:52] this work here
[1:58:55] God's going to call it right out and you
[1:58:57] may not like it very well when he does
[1:59:00] so listen
[1:59:03] I know why I said all that but I said it
[1:59:06] God's will be done
[1:59:12] all right
[1:59:14] there's no such a thing as a black white
[1:59:16] bird no drunk sober men
[1:59:19] hear the Christian or you're not a
[1:59:21] Christian your life is going to prove it
[1:59:22] or not prove it
[1:59:24] you say you are but you won't obey his
[1:59:26] word because this word is not your
[1:59:28] absolute
[1:59:30] where's the absolute you say well well
[1:59:33] this is my this is my absolute right
[1:59:35] here right here right here this is my
[1:59:37] absolute but you can't know this without
[1:59:39] this
[1:59:42] amen
[1:59:46] so why aren't you believing this because
[1:59:49] you don't want to be you don't want to
[1:59:50] be pushed out in the open by the
[1:59:52] unveiling of the word you want to just
[1:59:54] say well I can take this you can take
[1:59:57] this this is what this was the prophet's
[1:59:59] quote book right here
[2:00:02] but without the message I'm raising this
[2:00:05] up because the messy they're together
[2:00:09] you can't know what this word promised
[2:00:11] for this hour what the scripture said in
[2:00:13] this hour without his interpretation of
[2:00:15] God through that prophet
[2:00:19] that's exactly the truth
[2:00:22] I know there's people raised up against
[2:00:24] that but you raise up all you want about
[2:00:26] it but it's the truth
[2:00:32] amen God has a channel we must come Gods
[2:00:35] provided way of coming
[2:00:38] you can't deviate that way
[2:00:41] all right okay
[2:00:43] now I know
[2:00:45] okay let's get this done
[2:00:49] you're a Christian or you're not a
[2:00:51] Christian
[2:00:52] you're either a Christian or not a
[2:00:54] Christian you're either in Christ or out
[2:00:56] of Christ this morning this is what he
[2:00:59] said may not make no mistake about it a
[2:01:01] person that's truly born of the spirit
[2:01:03] truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into
[2:01:05] the body of Christ receiving the
[2:01:08] fullness of the spirit will be in the
[2:01:10] word all the way
[2:01:15] that's the evidence of being baptized or
[2:01:19] born again with the Holy Ghost
[2:01:23] because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[2:01:26] the new birth
[2:01:29] if that seed's not in you can be
[2:01:31] baptized in your spirit have a real
[2:01:33] baptism
[2:01:34] but if that seed's not there
[2:01:37] and do the works of the Holy Spirit as
[2:01:39] far as Spiritual Works but to follow the
[2:01:41] word you're going to deviate off the
[2:01:43] word
[2:01:45] that's the fruit we know you by
[2:01:49] amen it's not the fruit of the Season go
[2:01:51] back to anointing when's the end time to
[2:01:53] see if that's not what he said
[2:01:55] how do we judge it we judge it by their
[2:01:57] Miracle signs and wonders no we judge it
[2:02:00] by the word for the season
[2:02:02] the fruit is not producing the word for
[2:02:05] the season it's a deviation off of that
[2:02:07] your life is deviating
[2:02:10] oh but I I love him no question I'm not
[2:02:12] questioning whether you love him or not
[2:02:14] but are you obeying is his Word Alive in
[2:02:16] you are you seeing the word for the
[2:02:18] season see all right okay now let's
[2:02:22] close this off are you willing give me
[2:02:24] about five minutes
[2:02:27] give or take all right
[2:02:34] so we look at the bride here
[2:02:37] Revelations 10 2 and he had a little
[2:02:39] book in his hand you know about that I'm
[2:02:42] just going to quote that I'm not going
[2:02:43] to have time to go take it and read it
[2:02:45] but you know what he said
[2:02:48] I saw another Mighty Angel descending
[2:02:50] from Heaven having the book in his hand
[2:02:51] an open book are you with me a little
[2:02:54] book The Bible said it was a little book
[2:02:58] now remember the Book of Life in the
[2:03:00] land Book of Life are the same book
[2:03:02] but here's a little book
[2:03:04] all right and brother Brandon referred
[2:03:07] to it as the bride's book
[2:03:10] amen all right so it's not something
[2:03:12] because seven seventh seals sealed that
[2:03:16] book
[2:03:18] and brother Brown said only these Seven
[2:03:19] Seals could be only open to the bride
[2:03:21] alone
[2:03:25] she's the only one that could see it
[2:03:28] okay so then there so that book contains
[2:03:31] names also
[2:03:33] and brother Bradham said it's not the
[2:03:35] name like David Dean Hart Orman Neville
[2:03:37] he said it's the mystery that's revealed
[2:03:39] there that calls your name because
[2:03:42] you're the mystery
[2:03:46] amen all right now
[2:03:49] you see yourself written
[2:03:52] used to recognize your position in the
[2:03:55] day
[2:03:56] you're not a grafted in Branch you're an
[2:03:59] original Branch from the root
[2:04:02] you're an original Orange
[2:04:05] or whatever the what it may be
[2:04:09] you're not grafted in you're not a
[2:04:11] tangelo you're not half orange and half
[2:04:13] tangerine
[2:04:14] see you're not half and half that's a
[2:04:18] grafted in living off the very life
[2:04:20] living off the same life The Same Spirit
[2:04:24] amen
[2:04:27] all right now
[2:04:29] he said
[2:04:31] let us go another step
[2:04:34] foreign
[2:04:41] just a minute now
[2:04:47] first Peter 4 7. let's go over there
[2:04:50] real quick first Peter 4 7.
[2:05:00] first Peter I'm in First Peter 4 7.
[2:05:03] for the time has come
[2:05:06] remember Revelation 10 2
[2:05:10] for the time has come
[2:05:18] that judgment must begin at the house of
[2:05:22] God
[2:05:27] whose house
[2:05:29] you are
[2:05:32] what's this house his body
[2:05:35] the Bride is a revelation of himself his
[2:05:37] body
[2:05:38] who must begin at the house of God and
[2:05:40] if it first begin at us
[2:05:44] what shall the end be of them that obey
[2:05:46] not the gospel of God
[2:05:48] where's the final voice
[2:05:52] today where's The Voice
[2:05:57] the bride
[2:06:05] and if the righteous scarcely
[2:06:10] now the remember the bride's already
[2:06:12] judged
[2:06:15] this is not speaking of bride here
[2:06:17] if the bride scarcely
[2:06:20] be saved where shall the ungodly and The
[2:06:23] Sinner appear
[2:06:26] all right
[2:06:28] all right now let us go another step
[2:06:30] brother Brown says he said in our case
[2:06:32] thus far first of all we know assuredly
[2:06:34] that the purpose of God stands in
[2:06:36] election
[2:06:37] I wish I had time to go through these
[2:06:39] things but we know we're chosen in him
[2:06:41] before the foundation of the world
[2:06:43] Ephesians 1 9. says let's go over here
[2:06:47] just so real quick
[2:06:49] Ephesians 1 9.
[2:06:52] says that you were you were chosen
[2:06:54] Ephesians 1 3 and 4 chosen in him before
[2:06:57] the world began
[2:06:59] we know those scriptures you were chosen
[2:07:01] at the elect
[2:07:02] you're the elected
[2:07:04] so you know these things why I'm going
[2:07:06] to go just a little quicker over this
[2:07:08] now
[2:07:10] Ephesians and 1 9 said having made known
[2:07:13] unto us the mystery of his will who's us
[2:07:16] here the Saints the bride having made
[2:07:19] known unto us the mystery of his will
[2:07:22] according to his good pleasure which he
[2:07:25] hath past tense purposed
[2:07:28] in himself
[2:07:30] he purposed it in himself
[2:07:33] amen all right that in the dispensation
[2:07:36] of the fullness of times where we're at
[2:07:37] he might gather together all things in
[2:07:40] Christ how's he going to gather them
[2:07:44] by opening the little book
[2:07:48] a trumpet sounded what trumpet the final
[2:07:52] the seventh
[2:07:53] amen it opened what's it doing Gathering
[2:07:57] his people Gathering his bride the
[2:08:00] voices come out what's the voice what's
[2:08:01] the voice the bride has the voice of the
[2:08:03] Resurrection
[2:08:04] what's the shout the message of the hour
[2:08:06] did not it carry all of those what's not
[2:08:10] even even uh
[2:08:13] Ella will go there takes too much time
[2:08:15] now see referring to Gideon having a
[2:08:17] lamp
[2:08:18] a shout
[2:08:22] amen a trumpet
[2:08:26] he does all three while he descends
[2:08:31] I'll just leave it like that all right
[2:08:33] now
[2:08:34] now so so he said now we know the heart
[2:08:37] purpose I don't have time to go into
[2:08:39] that go back to page 163 or 162 163 that
[2:08:44] the Eternal God had Eternal thoughts
[2:08:46] those thoughts are Eternal that he had
[2:08:48] of you
[2:08:50] amen they were in his thinking they were
[2:08:52] in his thought that thought was
[2:08:54] substance I've already been through that
[2:08:56] so I'm not going to preach that sermon
[2:08:58] again
[2:08:59] I preach you here on Wednesday if you
[2:09:00] want to go Hear It Go hear it
[2:09:02] but that was substance that was already
[2:09:03] in him that was the face seed he already
[2:09:06] had you in his thinking
[2:09:08] all he had to do was express it he
[2:09:11] expressed it and you come in your season
[2:09:12] because you're a spoken word creation
[2:09:17] that new birth is a spoken word creation
[2:09:21] amen so you are substance in his
[2:09:24] thinking his thoughts are Eternal God's
[2:09:26] thoughts are eternal his heart purpose
[2:09:29] would have the Bride of his own choosing
[2:09:31] which he had already choose and purposed
[2:09:33] in himself so I won't go back to those
[2:09:36] quotes that I had here go back to it in
[2:09:38] the church age book page 162 163.
[2:09:42] paragraph 162 163 64 65 165. amen but he
[2:09:49] purposed like to have a people liking
[2:09:50] them to self that would be a word bride
[2:09:52] she was chosen before the foundation of
[2:09:55] the world in him she was foreknown and
[2:09:57] beloved before those ever before there
[2:09:59] was ever brought forth during the ages
[2:10:01] upon the Earth
[2:10:02] before she was ever brought forth she
[2:10:05] was Redeemed by his blood she can never
[2:10:06] come into condemnation judgment she can
[2:10:09] never be in the Judgment because sin
[2:10:11] cannot be imputed unto her she stands
[2:10:14] absolutely sinless
[2:10:18] the bride is sinless totally brother
[2:10:20] Brown said she's perfectly totally
[2:10:22] sinless because she's in the sinless one
[2:10:25] you can't be in the sinless one and not
[2:10:27] be sinless
[2:10:30] be perfect as my Father in Heaven is
[2:10:32] perfect and he gave you the the way to
[2:10:35] be made perfect come through the blood
[2:10:37] amen amen you're perfect you stand
[2:10:40] perfectly complete and sinless before
[2:10:43] him right that is what God thinks of you
[2:10:47] that's why this message pronounced
[2:10:49] judgment to you and said the case is
[2:10:51] dismissed you're sinless you're perfect
[2:10:54] not one thing can be held against you
[2:10:58] right and I have the proof of that
[2:11:00] because I have the token the token is my
[2:11:03] Assurance that I'm identified in that
[2:11:05] word
[2:11:07] I'm his eternal possession
[2:11:10] I'm his kingdom and he has taken
[2:11:13] complete control of me and I've given
[2:11:15] him total responsibility and he receives
[2:11:17] the obligation
[2:11:19] all right all right now so we're walking
[2:11:22] with God having this testimony what our
[2:11:25] testimony raptured Faith the same
[2:11:27] testimony that in a cat
[2:11:31] that please God Amen all right now
[2:11:35] you're perfectly sinless no condemnation
[2:11:37] to them Romans 8 1 no condemnation to
[2:11:40] them that are in Christ Jesus
[2:11:45] amen Romans 8 1. he that is born of God
[2:11:48] does not commit sin you say well I was
[2:11:51] born in sin that's right but you've been
[2:11:52] born again and he that's born of God
[2:11:55] look where you're born from of God if
[2:11:57] you're born of God who are you a little
[2:11:59] God you are himself
[2:12:01] so you're born of God
[2:12:03] amen he that is born of God does not
[2:12:07] commit sin because the seed of God which
[2:12:10] is who you are remains in you and it
[2:12:13] cannot sin
[2:12:15] there's no sin in Christ your
[2:12:18] identification is in Christ you have
[2:12:21] Christ you're walking with Christ you
[2:12:23] apply Christ every day you deny yourself
[2:12:25] and apply Christ you cry by Christ to me
[2:12:29] I apply it to my being a husband I apply
[2:12:31] it to being a husband I applied to being
[2:12:33] a minister so therefore by applying it
[2:12:35] to him I become a supernatural Minister
[2:12:37] I become a supernatural husband I become
[2:12:40] a supernatural wife you're a wife a
[2:12:42] supernatural wife why because you're
[2:12:44] more than a man being Christ you're more
[2:12:46] than a man
[2:12:48] you ever think about that
[2:12:50] who are you on the inside it's more than
[2:12:53] a man I have no confidence in the man I
[2:12:56] have confidence in what's inside of me
[2:12:59] makes you and I his bride but he is
[2:13:03] Veil behind a body of Flesh that makes
[2:13:06] mistakes that airs every day but he's
[2:13:08] not judging me by those things he's
[2:13:10] judging me by his thought he's expressed
[2:13:12] into word and gave the blood forth and a
[2:13:15] token to say you're underneath that word
[2:13:17] and there's nothing can move you from it
[2:13:22] Hallelujah
[2:13:23] Hallelujah that's what God's heart
[2:13:26] purpose is that's what he said you would
[2:13:28] be there's no condemnation
[2:13:32] see why you've got to have your position
[2:13:33] in Christ
[2:13:35] without that you're not going into
[2:13:37] rupture
[2:13:39] why am I saying it that way perchance or
[2:13:41] somebody that'll catch a conviction and
[2:13:43] stay in their face until they know that
[2:13:45] they know that they know that Christ
[2:13:47] lives in them
[2:13:48] if there's even a pull for that yield to
[2:13:51] it
[2:13:52] all I can say yield to it you young
[2:13:54] people yield to it don't you take
[2:13:58] what the world's given you out here
[2:14:00] don't you take religion
[2:14:03] you must be born again
[2:14:09] must be born again by the word it's a
[2:14:11] word promise of this hour birthed
[2:14:15] you come through that birth of that word
[2:14:17] promise
[2:14:18] the blood the blood I'm preaching right
[2:14:21] here what's happening the blood
[2:14:23] is going out
[2:14:27] he that receives it walks in the light
[2:14:31] amen
[2:14:32] are you are you are you what John first
[2:14:35] John said
[2:14:38] amen if we walk in the light then the
[2:14:41] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses a small
[2:14:42] sin
[2:14:50] amen all right but we must walk in the
[2:14:54] light
[2:14:54] of a light past
[2:14:57] it's the light of the promise
[2:14:59] the light of the hour
[2:15:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for
[2:15:03] the Holy Ghost himself
[2:15:06] we're going back and and trying to
[2:15:07] preach a Pentecostal Doctrine
[2:15:10] we're preaching the rapture
[2:15:15] we're preaching Jesus Christ himself
[2:15:18] Among Us friends
[2:15:20] who do you say this is
[2:15:23] who do you say you are
[2:15:28] the real you are
[2:15:32] okay I'm gonna go through these very
[2:15:34] quickly now
[2:15:37] we're just like Enoch
[2:15:39] the Rapture were summonsed
[2:15:41] just a little bitty group but like Enoch
[2:15:43] will be taken up
[2:15:46] we're walking step by step in the light
[2:15:50] a little step higher a little step
[2:15:52] higher a little step higher
[2:15:54] okay
[2:15:56] maybe I'll pick these up sometime later
[2:16:05] almost 9 11 talks about the sovereignty
[2:16:08] of God we've got to understand the
[2:16:10] sovereignty of God he chooses whom he
[2:16:12] chooses
[2:16:14] Pharaoh wasn't didn't even have his name
[2:16:16] on the book and yet he was ordained to
[2:16:17] do what he did for the purpose that God
[2:16:20] would do him use him for
[2:16:23] you see sovereignty
[2:16:25] let God be God okay
[2:16:28] amen
[2:16:30] we could take a lot of time on that
[2:16:32] maybe we'll catch it another time
[2:16:35] now then
[2:16:38] he's made unknown unto us the mystery of
[2:16:40] his will thus if God sows thou design
[2:16:42] paragraph 159.
[2:16:44] thus if God is so designed that there's
[2:16:47] that there be those whose names are
[2:16:50] placed
[2:16:51] in a section
[2:16:55] of The Book of Life of the Lamb's Book
[2:16:57] of Life and cannot be erased for they
[2:17:00] are the names of his bride then we must
[2:17:03] accept that
[2:17:04] where are they in a section
[2:17:08] of the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:17:13] amen now listen he said now I'm going to
[2:17:16] take these very quickly here that's
[2:17:17] paragraph 159 paragraph 164.
[2:17:22] now he goes into the wheat plant and
[2:17:23] I'll probably finish this series Lord
[2:17:25] willing with that if God so be willing
[2:17:28] but
[2:17:30] he takes a wheat plant the wheat plant
[2:17:32] the whole wheat plant is The Book of
[2:17:33] Life
[2:17:34] some die some are names removed others
[2:17:37] remain
[2:17:40] because his very life that started out
[2:17:42] as a seed would be reproduced in bodies
[2:17:45] like his in the resurrection it is at
[2:17:49] the resurrection that the Royal seed
[2:17:50] will see many Royal seeds like unto
[2:17:52] himself and they will be been as he is
[2:17:57] you see okay now he said
[2:18:01] he said the record of the wheat plants
[2:18:03] The Book of Life I repeat the history or
[2:18:05] record of this wheat plant is The Book
[2:18:07] of Life which part of the book which a
[2:18:11] part excuse me of the book of life is
[2:18:13] the record of eternal life
[2:18:17] a section of the Book of Life
[2:18:25] Christ died he gave his life that life
[2:18:27] was to come back upon the bride and
[2:18:30] bring many sons like unto himself and to
[2:18:32] glory in the resurrection
[2:18:37] that was paragraph
[2:18:39] 165.
[2:18:43] 164 165 and now 166.
[2:18:50] and of course that wheat seed has to
[2:18:52] have a carrier and that's what Luther
[2:18:54] Wesley and any cost per carriers then it
[2:18:57] came out of the carrier Pentecost
[2:18:59] into the light of the sunlight of the
[2:19:01] truth word for the Rapture amen
[2:19:05] and then he said
[2:19:07] let's go over it again
[2:19:10] he said about the wheat plant and then
[2:19:11] he says just part of the wheat of that
[2:19:14] plant can go back to being seed because
[2:19:17] just part of that wheat plant is eternal
[2:19:20] life wheat
[2:19:23] all right are you with me all right
[2:19:27] then he said notice how
[2:19:29] Christ the seed died gave his life
[2:19:32] planted that and it came up
[2:19:35] he started growing
[2:19:37] that life kept coming through carriers
[2:19:39] through carriers to carriers through
[2:19:41] through the it was it was in The Book of
[2:19:44] Life
[2:19:45] okay but then when the book is opened in
[2:19:47] Revelation 10 what's he revealing
[2:19:52] your section
[2:19:55] he's opening the book of the eternal
[2:19:57] life record
[2:19:59] apart a section of that book
[2:20:02] he's revealing that
[2:20:04] what seriously revealing it to for you
[2:20:06] bride to see who you are
[2:20:11] Amen to see your position
[2:20:16] and to act on it
[2:20:19] to speak with it to go forth with it
[2:20:23] amen all right now he says
[2:20:27] just part of that plant is eternal life
[2:20:30] wheat we have the same thing today now
[2:20:33] listen to this and go back to
[2:20:34] Revelations 10 2 in your heart
[2:20:36] we have the same this is paragraph 168
[2:20:39] and I'm closing we have the same right
[2:20:42] today in the church names
[2:20:45] are going to be blotted out of the book
[2:20:47] of life now that's a whole section I
[2:20:50] want to talk on later
[2:20:53] but no names
[2:20:56] no names will be blotted out of the book
[2:20:59] of eternal life
[2:21:00] it sounds like he's saying talk about a
[2:21:02] separate book it is separate remember
[2:21:04] how brother Branham said that in the
[2:21:06] message invisible Union
[2:21:08] he said it's like two books but it's not
[2:21:12] it's one book
[2:21:14] all right but it sounds like two books
[2:21:16] because he takes a little book and he
[2:21:18] takes that it's absolutely geared to the
[2:21:21] bride see see every one of these that
[2:21:23] get eternal life have already been
[2:21:25] rigged
[2:21:28] brother Brandon used that word by the
[2:21:30] way I'm speaking what he said your
[2:21:33] life's already been rigged
[2:21:37] that's what he said go look it up
[2:21:39] there's only one place he said it rigged
[2:21:42] or other words hard
[2:21:45] hard
[2:21:50] huh
[2:21:53] hard
[2:21:54] yeah hardwired I guess that's what I
[2:21:56] wanted to say or it's been hardwired
[2:21:58] you're going to do what's in your heart
[2:22:01] you're going to be what's in your heart
[2:22:03] your soul let me clarify that
[2:22:06] because that Soul's out inside that
[2:22:08] heart you're going to do what's inside
[2:22:10] your soul

[2:22:16] but there's going to be a people today a
[2:22:17] people once again a people that's Royal
[2:22:19] seed brother Branham even said it on
[2:22:22] this day this scripture is fulfilled and
[2:22:23] we can say this day this scripture is
[2:22:25] fulfilled we see a bride
[2:22:29] that he said would be here promised to
[2:22:31] be here it would be the Royal seed to
[2:22:32] the Royal promised son and she was to
[2:22:35] come on the scene in this last day
[2:22:38] she's a promised word
[2:22:41] amen think of it you know your position
[2:22:44] as he knew his position
[2:22:46] it's a revelation to you if they think
[2:22:49] I've got it Brother David do you think
[2:22:50] you got it all no but I'm going to
[2:22:52] continue to feed and let him continue to
[2:22:55] open
[2:22:56] because his mercies are new every
[2:22:58] morning
[2:23:00] and I can't tell you enough how that
[2:23:02] sword has been opened and it seemed like
[2:23:04] it's opening faster and faster and
[2:23:06] faster even brother Brandon said I can't
[2:23:08] keep up with it anymore they're opening
[2:23:10] so fast out in those deserts and things
[2:23:13] you remember that
[2:23:15] why because he was coming to that place
[2:23:18] his message had to be complete
[2:23:21] and where we were coming to a completion
[2:23:24] we're coming to a body change we're
[2:23:26] walking with God you talk about the
[2:23:28] Simplicity of the body change you just
[2:23:31] go walking with God you'll become a was
[2:23:33] not
[2:23:36] that's how simple it is walk with God
[2:23:40] apply God
[2:23:42] apply the token
[2:23:45] walk with me
[2:23:47] oh my
[2:23:49] I thought Simplicity you'd be you'll
[2:23:51] just be one of these days walking
[2:23:52] somewhere and you're going to meet your
[2:23:54] loved ones and you watch you'll be
[2:23:56] changed if you're alive and remain
[2:23:57] you're gonna be changed in a moment
[2:23:59] and you know it's all it took when you
[2:24:00] were changed inside
[2:24:02] a moment
[2:24:04] you turn right around
[2:24:06] amen
[2:24:10] okay here am I he says watch no names
[2:24:13] will be blotted out of the book of
[2:24:14] eternal life for that is another record
[2:24:18] though contained in the Book of Life
[2:24:23] that is another record what's this
[2:24:26] little book that is another record
[2:24:30] though contained in the Book of Life
[2:24:34] it's called the bride's book
[2:24:37] you see brother sister
[2:24:39] our book's been opened
[2:24:43] amen
[2:24:44] we see who we are brother Brandon said
[2:24:47] our judgment is now
[2:24:49] amen
[2:24:50] we're being judged now
[2:24:53] and you know what the judges said
[2:24:55] you're perfect
[2:24:59] amen you're in me
[2:25:01] you're me
[2:25:04] and if that doesn't keep opening up then
[2:25:06] you've got the wrong message
[2:25:08] because you're me he said
[2:25:11] amen
[2:25:12] all right do you love me today
[2:25:15] and those who had that have that life
[2:25:17] were in him before the foundation of the
[2:25:19] world they were chosen in him before the
[2:25:21] foundation world that great Royal Sea
[2:25:23] Jesus Christ was planted that was what
[2:25:26] was that life that was in him came
[2:25:28] through the wheat plant reproduced
[2:25:30] itself in multiple wheat seeds having
[2:25:32] the same life in them
[2:25:34] see like the original like the original
[2:25:36] what because the Spirit by Spirit they
[2:25:39] are original
[2:25:41] Bible said Romans 8 11 if the spirit
[2:25:43] that dwelled in Jesus dwells in you
[2:25:46] Same Spirit watch what he said now we
[2:25:49] can see why the redeemed brought back to
[2:25:51] the original owner the bride was brought
[2:25:53] back the original owner she was in him
[2:25:55] like Eve was in Adam
[2:25:59] can never have she cannot ever have her
[2:26:02] member names taken off of the record she
[2:26:04] is a part of him she is in the throne
[2:26:07] she can never be judged everyone in the
[2:26:09] Bride is a member of him and he loses
[2:26:11] none
[2:26:14] Hallelujah
[2:26:16] praise the Lord
[2:26:18] praise the Lord
[2:26:22] back on paragraph 97 I'll read one more
[2:26:25] promise here or scripture
[2:26:28] and I'll read it to you Revelations 3 5
[2:26:30] he that overcometh the same will be
[2:26:33] clothed in white raiment and I will not
[2:26:35] blot out his name out of the book of
[2:26:37] life but I will confess his name before
[2:26:39] my father and his holy angels so you
[2:26:42] have those that are in the book that are
[2:26:45] called The Bride those that miss the
[2:26:47] Rapture are still in the book and remain
[2:26:50] in the book and are given life at the
[2:26:52] white Throne judgment now we're going to
[2:26:54] find out the next time who are they
[2:26:58] that are given life and why are they
[2:27:01] given life
[2:27:02] amen let's Stand Together
[2:27:12] I'm sure I'd probably missed something
[2:27:14] I'll probably go home and say oh
[2:27:16] I wish I'd have got that but you know
[2:27:18] what
[2:27:18] God knows exactly what's been said
[2:27:21] and I believe he has control over it all
[2:27:24] God bless everybody that's come and
[2:27:26] stood this time I know it's been long a
[2:27:28] lot of people may be new here said man
[2:27:30] I've never been in a service with a
[2:27:32] preacher ever preached that long but you
[2:27:34] know what we're not like the others
[2:27:39] we aren't
[2:27:40] we are his Royal seed
[2:27:43] and we can't get enough of this message
[2:27:45] this message is not a man's message it's
[2:27:49] the message that's been promised in the
[2:27:51] word for the hour now what are you
[2:27:53] individually going to do about it
[2:27:57] I said for you to repent
[2:27:59] [Music]
[2:28:00] and be baptized in the name not titles
[2:28:02] the name of Jesus Christ
[2:28:05] not father Son and Holy Ghost but in the
[2:28:08] name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[2:28:11] receive this gift of the Holy Ghost I'm
[2:28:13] talking about which is eternal life in
[2:28:16] you living
[2:28:19] that gift is a baptism of the Holy
[2:28:21] Spirit and you young people if you don't
[2:28:24] have that don't you stop don't you even
[2:28:27] accept nothing like a made-up religious
[2:28:30] activity about a message
[2:28:32] if you need to be born again
[2:28:35] and I challenge I say I don't challenge
[2:28:38] I say God is challenging you
[2:28:40] to meet the challenge of the hour
[2:28:43] I'm getting old
[2:28:45] my desires I continue to bring the word
[2:28:48] as God would have me to do it but I know
[2:28:50] I've got to leave the scene
[2:28:51] [Music]
[2:28:53] unless I'm alive and remained and that's
[2:28:55] very close to possibility but there's
[2:28:57] going to be men like our brother Sean
[2:29:00] Gabriella they're gonna be sisters and
[2:29:01] men that are going to take this message
[2:29:03] and run with it like my brother Chris
[2:29:06] I know him since he was four and a half
[2:29:08] I don't mean to say that negative
[2:29:10] brother Chris
[2:29:11] but I've seen what God's done for him I
[2:29:14] said God keep revealing your word to
[2:29:16] this brother
[2:29:17] [Music]
[2:29:19] don't end deviate
[2:29:21] don't let him move from right or left if
[2:29:24] there's things in my life or his life or
[2:29:26] anybody's life that's not exactly your
[2:29:27] perfect will show us
[2:29:29] [Music]

[2:29:32] try to do things to to find favor with
[2:29:35] people

[2:29:37] let me find favor with God let me obey
[2:29:39] God another Chris I know you'd say Amen
[2:29:42] to that I want to obey him doesn't
[2:29:44] matter what other people think I want to
[2:29:47] project his love and grace behind it
[2:29:53] I want to tell the truth
[2:29:55] God help me I've been through many hard
[2:29:58] battles I could spend the rest of the
[2:30:00] day and tomorrow and all next week

[2:30:03] nothing to me God has me go through all
[2:30:06] of them go to you going through all of
[2:30:07] them what is it bringing out his
[2:30:09] character
[2:30:11] many things have happened but in all of
[2:30:14] it I say praise the Lord because God's
[2:30:18] been gracious
[2:30:19] God said merciful never has he ever let
[2:30:23] me deviate if I started to deviate
[2:30:25] brought me right back in line with it
[2:30:28] [Music]
[2:30:31] the battles are nothing we have to go
[2:30:32] through them

[2:30:39] to go through him and you too

[2:30:55] yourself and you're going to have to
[2:30:57] depend completely upon him I say Lord
