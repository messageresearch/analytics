[51:15] Saints in South Africa uh there are so
[51:18] many things not just what's going on in

[51:24] come to the point that they basically
[51:26] have
[51:27] uh throwed out any form of Christianity
[51:30] they're they're uh ruling a nation uh
[51:33] based on their feelings their thoughts
[51:37] and you know it's interesting I just
[51:38] want to say this this morning it's
[51:40] interesting my brother and sister that

[52:18] actually has racism has come into the

[54:49] thank you so much God bless you and um I
[54:52] want to speak to you this morning on a
[54:54] title of bless
[54:57] Assurance um and U that is the place
[55:00] that God has wanted us to come to he's
[55:03] called us to a place of Blessed
[55:05] assurance that we can stand in the day
[55:07] that we live in and we don't have to get
[55:10] up in the morning you know um am I doing
[55:13] okay that's right you know we don't have
[55:15] to get up in the morning and say I'm
[55:17] afraid of of what is happening um you
[55:21] know we can get up in the morning and
[55:23] say praise God as a son or daughter of
[55:25] God I've got another day to live the
[55:28] word in this world Amen and that's what
[55:31] we desire amen so let's turn in our
[55:35] Bibles to um the book of Galatians and
[55:40] um I hope you don't mind I don't know
[55:42] what will happen today but if it's a
[55:44] little short I just ask you to pray for
[55:46] me we're just uh struggling with our
[55:49] voice a little bit uh Galatians 2
[55:52] chapter: 16-
[55:55] 21 and um we thank God for each and
[55:58] every one of you today God bless you our
[56:00] sister Maria good to see you and uh each
[56:03] and every one of us here as a part of
[56:05] the body of Believers the body of Christ
[56:09] we should lift one another up into
[56:11] Heavenly places every single day Amen
[56:15] brother Logan God bless you and uh
[56:18] Galatians
[56:19] 2:16 knowing that a man is not justified
[56:23] by The Works of the law but by the faith
[56:26] of Jesus Christ even we have believed in
[56:30] Jesus Christ that we might be justified
[56:32] by the Faith of Christ and not by The
[56:35] Works of the law for by The Works of the
[56:38] law shall no flesh be justified amen so
[56:42] want to just stop for a moment and look
[56:44] at that and ponder that to realize my
[56:46] brother and sister I I mentioned this
[56:49] here I don't know it seems like it must
[56:50] be at least a couple weeks ago um oh
[56:55] yeah pray for brother Paul's blood sugar
[56:57] my phone is telling me from the office
[56:59] that it's too high so anyway we look at
[57:02] this and realize that there's action
[57:06] required but it's not by our
[57:09] works amen that's right do we do we
[57:13] understand there's action required we
[57:15] can't just sit back and say okay praise
[57:17] God I'm Justified amen there's an action
[57:20] that's necessary but your
[57:22] works the works of the law shall no
[57:24] flesh be justified but if while we seek
[57:27] to be justified by Christ we ourselves
[57:30] also are found Sinners is therefore
[57:33] Christ the minister of sin God
[57:37] forbid so don't ever
[57:39] justify what's happening in your life oh
[57:43] I'm a Believer it's okay I've jumped the
[57:47] fence I'm here where I don't belong but
[57:50] praise God God's predestin predestinated
[57:54] me into the rapture
[57:57] no realize that God's never going to be
[57:59] a minister of sin we have to come back
[58:01] into alignment with the word that's
[58:05] that's the whole thing that we must do
[58:08] and if we're not willing to do that then
[58:10] we should be
[58:11] terrified we should be terrified of our
[58:13] own motive direction action Etc if we're
[58:17] not
[58:19] concerned for if I build again the
[58:21] things which I destroyed I make myself a
[58:24] transgressor
[58:26] for I through the law am dead to the law
[58:29] that I might live unto God I am
[58:32] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[58:35] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[58:39] can we say that together
[58:42] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[58:46] liveth in me and the life which I now
[58:50] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[58:53] the Son of God who loved me and gave him
[58:56] self for me I do not frustrate the grace
[58:59] of God for if righteousness come by the
[59:02] law then Christ is dead in vain that's
[59:04] right Heavenly Father we just ask you to
[59:06] be with us today Father just study our
[59:09] thoughts Lord and just help us we ask in
[59:11] your precious name amen you may be
[59:15] seated now I'm I'm not really didn't
[59:18] want to get Sidetrack as it is to go
[59:22] into part of this but I think it's good
[59:25] some time saints that we would stop and
[59:28] maybe this morning just stop and say you
[59:32] know Lord what is this this life which I
[59:35] now live what when we examine our own
[59:38] life what what are we actually looking
[59:41] to because you see now it won't be your
[59:44] final destination and don't be
[59:46] discouraged if if uh things have been
[59:49] going difficult for you but you know we
[59:52] need to stop and say you know what I'm a
[59:54] Son of God I'm a daughter of God God
[59:56] I've been called of God to live the the
[59:58] word in this hour and what has that
[1:00:01] produced in me now my brother and sister
[1:00:04] if you if you put uh things together
[1:00:07] that should produce something uh you
[1:00:10] know and it's not producing it you would
[1:00:12] go back and say you know uh I've added
[1:00:15] water to my plaster of Paris and and uh
[1:00:19] uh it never set up it's just mush there
[1:00:21] you would have to stop and say what was
[1:00:24] this and what was the ingredient of this
[1:00:26] to bring it to a place and the life
[1:00:28] which I now live I think we should stop
[1:00:30] and we should examine our life and say
[1:00:33] now what is producing now if this hurts
[1:00:35] a little bit we can rub some Sav on it
[1:00:38] but the life I'm living right now what
[1:00:41] produced that life now if it's a life
[1:00:45] right now of nervousness and anxieties
[1:00:48] and tensions and fears and and and uh
[1:00:50] you know lack or I should say
[1:00:52] frustrations lack of patience and
[1:00:55] whatever it might be you know we have to
[1:00:57] stop and say what produced that you know
[1:01:00] God's not a god of fear amen and uh he's
[1:01:04] not a god of anxiety although he will
[1:01:06] come and he will cause a sheep to be
[1:01:09] nervous sometimes because he wants us
[1:01:12] not to get comfortable when we're in
[1:01:14] places we should not be but it's there
[1:01:16] that we have to look at what is the life
[1:01:18] which I now live now my brother and
[1:01:20] sister I'm going to take it radically to
[1:01:22] one side right now if we find oursel
[1:01:25] outside of church cursing or lying or
[1:01:28] cheating or stealing and and you'd have
[1:01:30] to stop and say what is producing that
[1:01:32] in me my brother and sister if we're
[1:01:35] here we're taking this outside of the
[1:01:36] church if we're here outside of the
[1:01:39] church and your heart is not sighing and
[1:01:42] crying for those that are living in this
[1:01:44] world my brother sister that sounds well
[1:01:47] I'm doing right I'm spiritual I I'm not
[1:01:49] doing anything wrong I'm not lying
[1:01:51] cheating stealing anything like that but
[1:01:53] you have no care for the world here here
[1:01:56] the prophet of God says that you should
[1:01:58] be afraid because God is coming for
[1:02:01] those who are sighing and crying for the
[1:02:02] Abominations done in the city so you see
[1:02:06] we can detach ourselves uh from sin but
[1:02:09] we can also go so far that we detach
[1:02:11] ourselves from everyone around us and
[1:02:15] that isn't what God's calling we were
[1:02:16] called to live in this world just not of
[1:02:19] this world and so when we come and find
[1:02:21] ourselves too detached that we really
[1:02:23] just don't care we'd say well you know I
[1:02:26] I just don't care about this I don't
[1:02:28] care about that my brother and sister we
[1:02:30] are called to care about souls and so
[1:02:32] what is being produced in us if today
[1:02:35] God is working in our life and we're
[1:02:36] living uh balanced lives we're we're
[1:02:39] moving forward in the word of God we
[1:02:41] care about those around us it do us well
[1:02:44] to look around us and say how much do I
[1:02:46] care about those to my right and to my
[1:02:48] left and those in front of me and those
[1:02:50] behind me how much do I care and if you
[1:02:53] don't find yourself caring and in the
[1:02:56] fullest of measure please go home and
[1:02:58] pray today don't leave the church
[1:03:01] without praying today because you see
[1:03:03] God's going to only be the prophet says
[1:03:05] words we won't get into all of that but
[1:03:07] you know these words amen that love is a
[1:03:11] one of the greatest or right a pinnacle
[1:03:14] that we'd have now my brother and sister
[1:03:15] you see it's the
[1:03:18] unfeigned love of the Brethren it's not
[1:03:21] that the not the oh yeah I love them I
[1:03:24] love you God bless you no my brother and
[1:03:28] sister we got to get to where it's
[1:03:30] unfeigned in other words even if they
[1:03:32] cause you offense that's right yeah but
[1:03:35] the prophet balanced that didn't he he
[1:03:36] said a real believer can't be offended
[1:03:39] that's right and now that causes us
[1:03:41] another struggle we could detour over on
[1:03:43] that one and spend weeks couldn't we cuz
[1:03:45] I think all of us would say at some
[1:03:47] point that while we were uh you know had
[1:03:49] a prayer life reading our Bible going to
[1:03:51] church we become offended over people's
[1:03:54] behavior we shouldn't be offended over
[1:03:57] that no we should be uh uh moved
[1:04:01] prostrated over that but not offended
[1:04:04] now I want to just move right along here
[1:04:06] so as we examine and it would do us all
[1:04:09] well to examine the life which we are
[1:04:11] now living uh what is producing the life
[1:04:14] that we have if we have bitterness anger
[1:04:16] fear anxiety whatever stop and and ask
[1:04:20] the Lord to reveal what is bringing that
[1:04:22] into your life and then ask the Lord to
[1:04:25] give you rem it uh and as we look at
[1:04:28] this um I had the title of Blessed
[1:04:31] assurance and on my notes
[1:04:34] um uh for every question at home for
[1:04:37] every question there is a Biblical
[1:04:40] answer so there's our solution is back
[1:04:43] to the word it's not uh not in theology
[1:04:46] not in our thoughts or opinions you know
[1:04:50] uh the Lord just really and I won't go
[1:04:52] into detail but the Lord just really
[1:04:54] moved this weekend uh
[1:04:56] uh this last weekend certainly not to
[1:04:58] boast on man by any measure but the Lord
[1:05:01] just really come down and and pointed
[1:05:04] some things out and and uh this was a
[1:05:06] report of others you know and you look
[1:05:09] at that and it's not man that
[1:05:12] facilitates that but it's God bringing
[1:05:14] his children amen back to the word for
[1:05:17] the answer and so that's what the
[1:05:19] prophet was doing and in this time of
[1:05:22] reflection of who we really are uh you
[1:05:25] know useing as a thermometer of our
[1:05:28] present spiritual
[1:05:30] condition now my brother and
[1:05:33] sister just because you didn't jump out
[1:05:35] of bed this morning you know click your
[1:05:37] heels to together praise God um that's
[1:05:41] no sign of whether you have a a good
[1:05:44] solid spiritual
[1:05:46] temperature right we're looking in the
[1:05:48] world today seeing things that that uh
[1:05:51] men who were last week in the pulpit
[1:05:55] telling you God spoke to them are now
[1:06:00] this weekend in the midst of
[1:06:03] Scandal so one saying that God is
[1:06:06] dealing with him and God's speaking to
[1:06:08] them none of that matters you see it's
[1:06:11] actually the
[1:06:13] thermometer of the word in our life is
[1:06:15] what
[1:06:16] dictates and uh so we look at this some
[1:06:20] uh high points amen can you think of a
[1:06:23] high point in your life this last week
[1:06:25] or two or three you know something God
[1:06:27] answered a prayer spoke to you you saw
[1:06:29] something in the scripture that high
[1:06:31] point we can live in the Afterglow of
[1:06:34] that high point but when you have a low
[1:06:36] point in your life you can also live in
[1:06:38] the Afterglow of it but my brother and
[1:06:41] sister what God's looking for is this
[1:06:43] thermometer of your present spiritual
[1:06:46] condition so what last year was or what
[1:06:50] uh you know you felt about it is
[1:06:53] irrelevant of this morning
[1:06:56] God wants us to take our temperature
[1:06:58] this morning he wants us to look at this
[1:07:00] and say you know what where is my life
[1:07:04] today you could have been shouting
[1:07:06] Hallelujah yesterday but if you are
[1:07:08] defeated today yesterday's Hallelujah
[1:07:11] will not take away today's defeat God
[1:07:15] wants us to know what our temperature is
[1:07:17] and so you know if we are coming short
[1:07:20] of the word we're coming short of things
[1:07:24] you know never look at that as though
[1:07:25] it's a permanent position never look at
[1:07:28] it as though you know the Troubles of
[1:07:30] this last
[1:07:32] week is where I'm at
[1:07:35] spiritually don't don't look at it that
[1:07:37] way my brother and sister you cannot
[1:07:39] take the troubles you know we have I
[1:07:43] think everyone I'll just speak in a
[1:07:44] positive tense every one of us has
[1:07:47] experienced Satan coming in like a flood
[1:07:50] and when that flood takes place my
[1:07:52] brother and sister if you take it as the
[1:07:54] snapshot of your life you will move
[1:07:56] forward saying you know what I'm
[1:07:58] practically
[1:07:59] defeated but that was just a moment in
[1:08:01] your life and when Satan comes in like a
[1:08:04] flood we have to remember God said I'm
[1:08:07] going to raise up a standard amen amen
[1:08:10] so there's the point see God coming and
[1:08:12] moving and with every flood there's a
[1:08:15] standard now when the standard is raised
[1:08:18] we think that would protect us I've
[1:08:20] heard it interpreted that you know if if
[1:08:22] Satan comes in like a flood God raises
[1:08:24] up a standard that flood will never
[1:08:26] touch me that's not what the word says
[1:08:28] my brother and sister God is coming in
[1:08:31] and raising up after Satan's assault
[1:08:34] he's raising up a standard and that
[1:08:37] standard is himself amen it's not a burm
[1:08:40] out here to keep the waves out we're
[1:08:42] driving around uh my phone doesn't have
[1:08:44] it uh uh uh uh but uh you know we're
[1:08:46] driving down the road and sister Jerry
[1:08:49] goes oh we're 20 ft above sea level and
[1:08:53] next thing you know Sister Michelle's
[1:08:54] got her phone out out and brother
[1:08:56] Danny's got his phone out and and mine
[1:08:58] was the only F I had no
[1:09:02] Revelation but you see I got nervous
[1:09:05] when their phones said we were actually
[1:09:08] below sea
[1:09:09] level and we're driving along there
[1:09:12] we're not very far from the coast and it
[1:09:14] says we're actually below sea level and
[1:09:17] I thought my I I don't like this kind of
[1:09:19] an idea you know that we're living below
[1:09:22] sea level well my brother and sister I
[1:09:24] hope you follow me the prophet of God
[1:09:26] said too often we're living below our
[1:09:30] rightful position in Jesus Christ that
[1:09:34] means you're
[1:09:37] underwater this might seem strange to
[1:09:39] you but it doesn't mean you're
[1:09:42] drowning we're looking at a phone and it
[1:09:45] says that we're below sea level but we
[1:09:47] weren't wet we weren't
[1:09:49] drowning because every time Satan comes
[1:09:52] in like a flood God has revelation he's
[1:09:55] got his presence he's pouring into his
[1:09:58] people and yes you're going to go
[1:10:00] through trial but I say God bless you
[1:10:03] for going through the trial and standing
[1:10:05] and just trusting the Lord in that time
[1:10:07] because you see we're never in a
[1:10:10] permanent position the only permanent
[1:10:12] position that applies to the Bride of
[1:10:14] Jesus Christ is the fact that he said
[1:10:17] you are mine from before the foundation
[1:10:19] of the world there is a permanent fact
[1:10:23] and it don't matter what your ups and
[1:10:24] downs are this day what happens with
[1:10:27] your marriage with your family with your
[1:10:29] career with your automobile or whatever
[1:10:32] it might be my brother none of that is
[1:10:34] permanent only our position in Jesus
[1:10:37] Christ is permanent amen and that's what
[1:10:40] we need to remember so we can stand on
[1:10:43] that and the prophet of God said he has
[1:10:46] provided everything we need for this
[1:10:49] journey so why would we stop and say you
[1:10:52] know what everything's Fallen apart I'm
[1:10:54] depressed
[1:10:56] he's got what is necessary for this
[1:10:58] journey provided will we stand long
[1:11:01] enough to receive the provision often
[1:11:04] times people get so pardon me to say it
[1:11:07] this way people get
[1:11:09] flaky and they run before God can
[1:11:12] present them the solution to the problem
[1:11:16] God wants you to stand still amen amen
[1:11:19] as speaking to Israel at the Red Sea
[1:11:23] Moses being anointed of God said stand
[1:11:26] still because the enemy that you see
[1:11:28] today you will see no more
[1:11:31] forever amen what is this referring to
[1:11:34] into our day is a group of Believers the
[1:11:37] Bride of Jesus Christ that will face
[1:11:39] trials she'll face an enemy that's
[1:11:41] closing in on her quickly she will have
[1:11:43] a natural instinct to have fear and
[1:11:46] doubt and anxiety but God wants us to
[1:11:49] stand still because when God delivers
[1:11:52] you from the fear and from the anxiety
[1:11:54] and the depression
[1:11:55] amen you don't have to face it again you
[1:11:57] don't have to go back and claim that
[1:11:59] again you can stand solid on the word
[1:12:01] and say my God is more than able amen
[1:12:04] that should be our position that we take
[1:12:07] amen amen so if we have everything we
[1:12:10] need for this journey my brother and
[1:12:12] sister amen we're not found
[1:12:16] wanting we're found
[1:12:19] complete and it's time for us to stand
[1:12:21] up and be able to say you know what I
[1:12:24] don't care what yesterday they was I
[1:12:26] know what the word said about me and I'm
[1:12:28] taking this position in the word cuz the
[1:12:30] devil's a very profoundly efficient
[1:12:33] liar amen he can come in and he can he
[1:12:37] can come after a church service and he
[1:12:39] can come into the mind of the people and
[1:12:41] they can tell them that could have been
[1:12:45] better could have been more inspired
[1:12:47] could have been more Revelation could
[1:12:48] have quoted more could have quoted less
[1:12:50] should have had more out of the Bible
[1:12:52] should have had less out of the Bible
[1:12:54] you see Satan knows what to present to
[1:12:57] each individual that they would be
[1:12:59] profoundly affected by the devil's voice
[1:13:03] right but you see my brother and sister
[1:13:05] I'm not talking about just taking
[1:13:06] something if a man got up here and did a
[1:13:08] whole lot of 's and O's and E and didn't
[1:13:11] have anything to say but if he said one
[1:13:14] thing that changed your life you could
[1:13:17] stand there and say it was a good
[1:13:18] service
[1:13:19] today but you see God wants us to stand
[1:13:22] here and say you know what God knew what
[1:13:24] we needed the service is what it was God
[1:13:27] knew what I needed amen maybe if the
[1:13:31] service didn't meet your expectation God
[1:13:33] was working on your
[1:13:36] patience now I know he doesn't need to
[1:13:38] work on any of our
[1:13:41] patience because we are his
[1:13:48] patients come
[1:13:50] on it's like the man who walked in true
[1:13:53] story walked in into an
[1:13:56] ER several gunshot
[1:13:58] wounds walks into an ER none of them
[1:14:01] enough to kill him got blood running out
[1:14:04] dripping on the floor and the nurses try
[1:14:06] to get him on a gurnie and the man tells
[1:14:08] him I only need a couple
[1:14:12] aspirin and he walked out of the
[1:14:16] ER and a few minutes later 911 receives
[1:14:20] a call there's a dead man in the middle
[1:14:21] of the
[1:14:23] intersection my brother and sister he
[1:14:25] refused to
[1:14:27] accept God's
[1:14:29] offered
[1:14:31] answer God's chosen place of
[1:14:34] worship but you see he was in such a
[1:14:37] case in this case
[1:14:39] intoxicated he didn't even realized he
[1:14:41] was intoxicated on a spirit of alcohol
[1:14:45] but in this day people are intoxicated
[1:14:47] on the spirit of leoda and don't even
[1:14:49] realize how damaged they are but they
[1:14:52] want to come to church get an asp
[1:14:56] mother brother don't don't don't refuse
[1:14:59] God's provided way amen now brother
[1:15:03] Brown says
[1:15:06] here excuse
[1:15:10] me Church
[1:15:11] ages he says I Know Thy works and if a
[1:15:15] man fears that he might not please God
[1:15:19] then let him fulfill the
[1:15:20] word you see if we fear that we're not
[1:15:23] going to please God we don't run
[1:15:25] away we don't ask for an
[1:15:28] aspirin and go die in the
[1:15:31] street amen we go and we accept God's
[1:15:34] provided solution so if a man thinks he
[1:15:38] might not please God then let him
[1:15:39] fulfill the word if a man wonders if he
[1:15:42] will hear those words well done uh uh
[1:15:45] good and faithful servant let him
[1:15:48] fulfill the word of God in his life and
[1:15:51] assuredly he will hear those words of
[1:15:53] praise you see my brother and sister
[1:15:57] people get concerned
[1:16:00] enough they're concerned enough to tell
[1:16:03] themselves they need
[1:16:04] help but not concerned enough to do
[1:16:08] anything about it and there's a
[1:16:10] different you say but I live a good life
[1:16:13] I don't find anywhere that the scripture
[1:16:16] says a good life gets us into the
[1:16:19] kingdom of God Amen it's the man who's
[1:16:22] pleasing God Amen ass surely he will
[1:16:25] hear those words of praise the word of
[1:16:27] Truth was the Criterion then it is a
[1:16:30] Criterion now there isn't another
[1:16:33] standard there isn't another Plum line
[1:16:36] now my brother and sister this has no
[1:16:38] reference to our trip so don't don't you
[1:16:40] know formulate anything there but we are
[1:16:44] facing a crisis around the message amen
[1:16:48] we have so many new Plum
[1:16:51] lines so many new criterias
[1:16:55] that that are what it would take to make
[1:16:56] a
[1:16:57] Rapture uh uh Brother David preached on
[1:17:00] this and and uh touched on these things
[1:17:03] these last few services and my brother
[1:17:05] and sister you see what it comes down to
[1:17:08] we've got one point of
[1:17:10] reference do you realize for GPS or
[1:17:13] anything else to work correctly there
[1:17:15] has to be just one point of complete
[1:17:19] reference right that's right I'll tie
[1:17:22] that back in a natural sense to you
[1:17:26] I fire up a tractor tomorrow morning and
[1:17:28] I start working ground and the lines are
[1:17:31] perfect at the end of the day I shut it
[1:17:34] off I go home I get up Tuesday morning I
[1:17:38] fire it all up again will the tractor
[1:17:42] Drive the exact same line it did
[1:17:49] yesterday if its point of reference is
[1:17:52] correct it will
[1:17:56] but we're using in the world of
[1:17:59] GPS natural GPS we're using satellites
[1:18:03] for points of references satellites move
[1:18:06] that's right so in the morning you have
[1:18:08] to come and you have to
[1:18:11] change the
[1:18:13] line back to the
[1:18:16] original and when we change it back to
[1:18:18] the original it will go on and drive
[1:18:21] exactly the same line through the day
[1:18:24] are you following me amen and this is
[1:18:27] where the Prophet come in people are are
[1:18:29] like well what do we really need a
[1:18:31] prophet in this day people who say they
[1:18:33] believe the message we're beyond the
[1:18:35] prophet well my brother and sister let
[1:18:37] me put it to you this way we as the
[1:18:39] bride of Christ are beyond the prophet
[1:18:41] we have come to the place we've been
[1:18:43] introduced to our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:18:45] that introduction brother brandom
[1:18:47] himself says this amen I never come to
[1:18:50] call you to myself but to point you or
[1:18:53] introduce you toes Jesus Christ but my
[1:18:56] brother and sister for many of us to
[1:18:58] know where we should be standing in the
[1:19:00] word it took a prophet's message to put
[1:19:03] it back in line for us to find where we
[1:19:06] can go and know the prophet is not our
[1:19:09] absolute but the word he pointed to is
[1:19:12] our absolute and we can go back to that
[1:19:15] word every single time and it will set
[1:19:18] us in line set us in order and guide us
[1:19:21] correctly amen and you can experience
[1:19:24] people that to say I believe this
[1:19:25] message but I
[1:19:28] don't isn't that a paradox I believe
[1:19:32] this message but the prophet was
[1:19:35] wrong I believe the Bible and the Bible
[1:19:39] does Point towards the prophet but the
[1:19:41] prophet is outdated
[1:19:43] unnecessary they got their whole list of
[1:19:46] things that they would say but my
[1:19:47] brother and sister where is our point of
[1:19:49] reference you can say it's Jesus Christ
[1:19:52] but the prophet said I came here to
[1:19:54] introduce uce you to Jesus Christ and
[1:19:56] without an introduction we have no point
[1:19:59] of
[1:20:01] reference and we look at
[1:20:03] this amen there isn't another standard
[1:20:06] there isn't another Plum line as the
[1:20:09] world is going to be judged by one
[1:20:11] Christ Jesus we can say Amen to that
[1:20:13] even so it's going to be judged by the
[1:20:16] word amen amen and if a man wants to
[1:20:19] know how he's making out let him do as
[1:20:22] James suggested look into the mirror of
[1:20:24] God God's word amen there is our Plum
[1:20:28] line there is everything that we need to
[1:20:30] do come right back to this word okay
[1:20:33] well if we go back to the word then we
[1:20:35] don't need the prophet my brother and
[1:20:37] sister we don't even understand the word
[1:20:40] as God wants us to be able to see it but
[1:20:43] God said no problem I can introduce you
[1:20:46] to a Seer I can introduce you to a
[1:20:48] prophet I can introduce you to a man
[1:20:50] that can lay it out very clear for you
[1:20:53] and by Revelation you can then follow
[1:20:55] that amen but we and I don't mean to
[1:20:58] speak negative this
[1:20:59] morning but some parts of the world it
[1:21:02] seems like there's just plenty of people
[1:21:04] we probably have more of them around
[1:21:05] here than I recognize but there's people
[1:21:07] that are like well that was good for
[1:21:09] that day but we need something more
[1:21:12] spiritual we need something more
[1:21:14] revelated we need something more well
[1:21:16] you know my brother and sister the
[1:21:17] prophet of God said we should be praying
[1:21:19] for Revelation I wouldn't ask you to
[1:21:21] raise your hand but did we pray for
[1:21:22] Revelation this last week amen we should
[1:21:25] be praying for Revelation because we're
[1:21:28] asking God for his Divine Direction
[1:21:31] you're not saying Oh Brother Paul is
[1:21:33] treats us good as a pastor you know
[1:21:35] preaches from the word does all that
[1:21:37] stuff my brother and sister if you're
[1:21:39] following Paul you'll find my brother
[1:21:42] and sister even 1,000th of a degree off
[1:21:45] on the compass of the word would leave
[1:21:47] you destitute but when we come back and
[1:21:49] God by his Divine leadership puts the
[1:21:52] compass directly on the word that we
[1:21:55] know what is true north we know what is
[1:21:57] the true word of the hour we know what
[1:21:59] true Revelation is then we can line up
[1:22:02] on that and we can trust it with our
[1:22:04] life
[1:22:09] right for every
[1:22:11] problem any problems in the
[1:22:15] church you don't have to lift a hand
[1:22:18] I've already got the
[1:22:21] answer there is a scriptural
[1:22:25] solution Amen to that problem
[1:22:29] amen I don't mean to be too pointed but
[1:22:31] I just say this if we got children
[1:22:35] problems we have scriptural answers
[1:22:38] Absolut to those problems amen we've got
[1:22:41] financial problems we got scriptural
[1:22:44] answers to those problems and you can go
[1:22:47] right down the list and I don't want to
[1:22:49] offend anyone but my brother and sister
[1:22:51] I'm afraid even us here Grace Tabernacle
[1:22:53] you love people that I love with all of
[1:22:56] my heart I think if we're not careful
[1:22:58] we'll get off even that one 10,000th of
[1:23:01] a degree and we'll start thinking that
[1:23:03] we have answers we'll start thinking
[1:23:05] that we've got a solution here just
[1:23:07] recently I had a a brother mentioned to
[1:23:10] me uh about and and I I was kind of
[1:23:13] surprised where it came from a brother
[1:23:15] mentioned about well there's this this
[1:23:17] uh denominational Christian has this
[1:23:19] really really good counseling course and
[1:23:21] maybe I would want to consider
[1:23:23] subscribing and reading it I'm telling
[1:23:26] you my brother and sister I love that
[1:23:28] brother but I thought I'm already in a
[1:23:30] counseling
[1:23:31] course amen and it works just as
[1:23:35] efficient as I let it work right if I
[1:23:39] resist it just like the man that's a
[1:23:44] counselor if I resist his advice it's
[1:23:47] not going to work and it's not his fault
[1:23:51] and if we resist the advice right and it
[1:23:54] doesn't work it's not his fault amen but
[1:23:57] people will say oh I I thought God said
[1:24:01] he did say don't interpret it he's his
[1:24:05] own interpreter let God bring it to pass
[1:24:09] but we got to stand still long enough to
[1:24:11] say Lord here I
[1:24:13] am right here I am amen now let me put
[1:24:17] it this way just for a side note for a
[1:24:19] second it says that if we want to be
[1:24:22] glorified with him we have to suffer
[1:24:24] with him that's
[1:24:26] right that's right would we today go out
[1:24:30] here in the parking lot and somebody
[1:24:32] beat us with a
[1:24:34] whip somebody Scourge
[1:24:36] us oh no that wasn't what he's talking
[1:24:38] he's talking about mentally
[1:24:41] suffering is that what he said did he
[1:24:43] clarify
[1:24:46] that suffering as a complete statement
[1:24:49] would be whatever come your way whether
[1:24:51] it's demons whether it's physical
[1:24:55] whether it's your health whether it's
[1:24:57] emotion whatever it is if you're going
[1:24:59] to reign with him you are going to
[1:25:02] suffer with him and you know we as
[1:25:05] message Believers have got so pampered
[1:25:07] we love the blessings we don't like the
[1:25:09] suffering amen Lord help us amen would
[1:25:13] you agree with me amen amen we do not
[1:25:16] like the suffering but we want the
[1:25:18] blessing
[1:25:19] amen Lord help us I can only imagine
[1:25:22] what my week coming will be
[1:25:25] yeah yeah it's all
[1:25:29] right for every problem there's a
[1:25:32] scriptural solution and I want to put
[1:25:35] the emphasis every problem amen I don't
[1:25:40] care what the problem
[1:25:42] is you know some people born under
[1:25:44] certain birth
[1:25:45] signs they're the kind of people that
[1:25:47] say oh this is this I can fix
[1:25:51] it you know that's not a blessing that's
[1:25:53] actually a curse to think you're going
[1:25:56] to fix it when there's only one who can
[1:26:00] fix it but we are so strong in our own
[1:26:04] opinion of our own selves that we're
[1:26:06] just certain that God intended for us to
[1:26:09] fix
[1:26:10] it say Amen Paul
[1:26:14] amen now this might seem a hard right
[1:26:17] turn but in the Book of
[1:26:19] Esther and you can follow this if you're
[1:26:21] familiar with the the scripture there
[1:26:24] you could follow this through the
[1:26:25] chapters but we see how hmon used the
[1:26:29] law to place a means to destroy and I
[1:26:32] I'm changing this from the Jew and from
[1:26:36] Israel because God looks at them if you
[1:26:40] follow me here God looked at the jew as
[1:26:43] a
[1:26:44] Believer and he looks at you
[1:26:47] as a Believer amen so the story of
[1:26:52] Esther is not old Old Testament it's not
[1:26:55] for Jews it's not just for Israel it's
[1:26:59] for the believer amen and so as we look
[1:27:03] at this we'll see the Book of Esther
[1:27:05] hmon used the law to put in place the
[1:27:08] means to destroy the believer now my
[1:27:12] brother and sister when we come to the
[1:27:13] place that we think we can tow the mark
[1:27:16] and live the law you will find that that
[1:27:19] very idea will destroy you that's right
[1:27:22] and there's many a Believer many a
[1:27:24] Christian that today is sitting there
[1:27:26] still trying to live under some form of
[1:27:30] the law if I do this God will be pleased
[1:27:34] well I'll tell you what my brother and
[1:27:35] sister this might strike you a little
[1:27:37] different but just trust it I'm speaking
[1:27:39] the truth if you can sit there today and
[1:27:41] say if I do this I'm a message believer
[1:27:44] if I do this God will be pleased how
[1:27:46] about you coming to the place that you
[1:27:49] will say Lord I am nothing without you
[1:27:53] and you are in control of my life and I
[1:27:56] am a Son of God I'm a daughter of God
[1:27:59] from before the foundation of the world
[1:28:01] and it was your suffering before the
[1:28:04] foundation of the world that wrote my
[1:28:07] name in that Lamb's Book of Life and I'm
[1:28:09] confessing that that will please
[1:28:12] God because as you confess it God will
[1:28:16] bring it to pass in your life it won't
[1:28:18] be what I have done but it will be what
[1:28:21] he has done it's not what I can can
[1:28:24] become it's what I already am in Jesus
[1:28:28] Christ amen that is what will please God
[1:28:31] not us here in a physical form trying to
[1:28:34] attain to some kind of hierarchy of of I
[1:28:38] I've had more answered prayers in you or
[1:28:41] or God would hear my voice more than
[1:28:43] yours oh or whatever it might be my
[1:28:45] brother and sister but God is looking
[1:28:47] for his children his Believers to just
[1:28:50] simply stand up and say you said it I
[1:28:53] believe it
[1:28:54] righten and it will be
[1:28:57] so now hmon used the law to destroy the
[1:29:02] believer and unfortunately there's still
[1:29:04] many on the Earth today that are under
[1:29:06] the law right now if this law is left
[1:29:11] unchallenged it will isolate the
[1:29:13] believer and Destroy them you say what
[1:29:17] law is that that was
[1:29:19] hmon getting king of hazus to sign it
[1:29:22] put the ring to it and that the rule of
[1:29:26] mes and Persians and whatnot is that
[1:29:28] once it's been
[1:29:30] spoken can't be changed they did have
[1:29:33] some things
[1:29:34] right are you with me today amen they
[1:29:38] weren't that far off the word CU God
[1:29:41] said when I claimed you before the
[1:29:43] foundation of the world I am not going
[1:29:45] to lose you I've never lost a single one
[1:29:48] so we can stand on that when God claimed
[1:29:50] us he's not going to say that was a
[1:29:52] mistake I'm sorry I'm here to change
[1:29:54] this today no he put it to Time and
[1:29:58] Eternity you're my sons you're my
[1:30:01] daughters you are my bride you are the
[1:30:03] Church of the Living God Amen and he
[1:30:06] never turned from that but here it is
[1:30:09] that hmon uses this gets the king to
[1:30:11] agree they put a law in place that these
[1:30:14] pesky old Jews uh
[1:30:17] Believers I'm just going to take a brief
[1:30:20] note if you don't
[1:30:21] mind right here on the board about right
[1:30:25] there on that wall is a letter received
[1:30:27] here at the
[1:30:28] church inviting us the man who sent the
[1:30:32] letter is
[1:30:33] LDS the man supporting it is a
[1:30:37] Nazarene and they're sending an
[1:30:39] invitation out to over 130 churches in
[1:30:42] this city did you know there were that
[1:30:44] many churches
[1:30:48] here 130
[1:30:52] churches and you know if you right up
[1:30:54] Midland top the hill where it makes a
[1:30:56] hard left and there's Gravel Road and a
[1:30:58] big beautiful building down by the lake
[1:31:01] they were going to provide a free meal
[1:31:04] whether you are a rabbi a priest oh the
[1:31:09] whole list
[1:31:11] Pastor ah can't remember all the names
[1:31:13] they had
[1:31:15] there they're going to provide a free
[1:31:18] meal for us to all join
[1:31:22] together did the prophet it not give us
[1:31:24] warning of these kind of things abely
[1:31:27] but you're going to love part of their
[1:31:28] joining together you'll see how
[1:31:30] spiritual minded this is it's all the
[1:31:34] preachers all the preachers coming
[1:31:37] together and we're going to have a meal
[1:31:39] together and we're going to have
[1:31:41] Fellowship can we find that in our Bible
[1:31:44] we can amen I love that Brother David
[1:31:46] you bet we can amen we can find it my
[1:31:50] brothers and sisters and they're going
[1:31:51] to come together in this multitud 130
[1:31:55] churches which many of them could be the
[1:31:58] same denomination of a slightly
[1:32:00] different leadership or flavor and we're
[1:32:03] going to have Fellowship around the word
[1:32:06] but you're going to love this part of
[1:32:07] the reason that this thing is being
[1:32:09] called together is we're going to vote
[1:32:13] on what religious
[1:32:15] pictures get to be
[1:32:18] present at the city of Nas prayer
[1:32:20] breakfast
[1:32:25] I
[1:32:26] told my dear Aaliyah hurry up paint a
[1:32:29] picture want to take it down
[1:32:31] there might be the only one to vote for
[1:32:34] it but you'll have a
[1:32:37] vote you see where religion's going
[1:32:41] to a free
[1:32:45] meal balum I'm sure wrote a flyer very
[1:32:50] similar to this one come on down we're
[1:32:53] not going to we're not going to preach
[1:32:54] against you we're not going to you know
[1:32:57] do anything no insults no recriminations
[1:33:00] no nothing just come on down here and
[1:33:03] vote for our art have a free meal
[1:33:08] Fellowship because catch these words the
[1:33:11] prophet spoke all these years ago
[1:33:12] exactly right we're all the same that's
[1:33:18] it let's have a vote this morning first
[1:33:22] vote on the agenda is our are we all the
[1:33:27] same not according to the word not
[1:33:30] according to the word we are not all the
[1:33:32] same now I just bring that out these
[1:33:35] will be good people amen I don't want to
[1:33:37] sound like I'm cadic what I said earlier
[1:33:39] we should be sighing and crying for
[1:33:41] these These are good people if you knew
[1:33:43] them as a neighbor as a friend as a
[1:33:45] coworker whatever you would know them at
[1:33:47] you would say these are good people but
[1:33:49] my brother and sister good people isn't
[1:33:51] what's going to keep you on the word
[1:33:54] that's right the designation of good
[1:33:56] people unless I sound that do that I
[1:33:59] have so many friends that I would trust
[1:34:02] with everything I own the care of my
[1:34:06] family some of them don't even believe
[1:34:08] there's a
[1:34:09] God but they're good people see we've
[1:34:12] got to stay focused on this but the
[1:34:14] prophet said this day would come right
[1:34:16] here so we could say in the city of
[1:34:18] Nampa this day this scripture is
[1:34:22] fulfilled so amen so if these these
[1:34:26] things these challenges you might say
[1:34:29] that Hon's brought forth uh uh you know
[1:34:32] to to have to do this and everyone who
[1:34:35] is a Jew he said you know let us have a
[1:34:38] judgment that wherever they would be
[1:34:42] found that you could slay
[1:34:48] them but when the whole story comes
[1:34:51] out Esther comes
[1:34:54] she's looking for someone this is the
[1:34:56] bride of Christ that's right she's
[1:34:58] looking for a solution somewhere she
[1:35:00] doesn't know quite where to find it
[1:35:02] because she doesn't think that she can
[1:35:05] go to the
[1:35:07] king cuz the king hasn't called
[1:35:10] me but the word says go boldly Before
[1:35:13] the Throne that's right you must believe
[1:35:15] the word amen and so in this a new law
[1:35:20] as it is is passed and says wherever the
[1:35:23] Jews are
[1:35:25] join
[1:35:26] together defend
[1:35:28] yourself I don't want to offend anybody
[1:35:30] this morning I just want to put this out
[1:35:32] and mark the
[1:35:35] note if you are the bride of Christ
[1:35:39] trying to stand
[1:35:42] alone you'll find that you're
[1:35:44] defenseless they recognized and wrote it
[1:35:48] and put it into the
[1:35:51] law gather together and defend
[1:35:56] yourselves don't forsake the assembling
[1:35:59] of yourselves together that's right
[1:36:01] because it's in the assembling of
[1:36:02] yourself together that God gives us the
[1:36:05] ability to defend yourselves you say
[1:36:08] well I I live just as well no my brother
[1:36:10] and sister God knew what to anoint in
[1:36:13] that day and God knows what to anoint in
[1:36:15] this day let's just take the word let's
[1:36:18] stand together we we don't need to try
[1:36:21] and stand alone let us stand
[1:36:24] together amen now so we see that that uh
[1:36:29] Esther's got a little
[1:36:31] trouble and Mori who is her
[1:36:36] stepfather I hope you'll catch this
[1:36:38] little spiritual
[1:36:41] angle we had one
[1:36:48] closer but he said I'm not going to try
[1:36:51] and redeem him
[1:36:54] we don't even know what Esther's real
[1:36:56] father was but God gave her a man for a
[1:37:01] father would stand on the
[1:37:04] word stood on it even to his own
[1:37:07] daughter who he loved with all of his
[1:37:09] heart and he tells his own
[1:37:13] daughter for if thou altogether holdest
[1:37:15] thy peace at this time then shall their
[1:37:19] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[1:37:21] Jews from another place
[1:37:24] but thou and thy father's house shall be
[1:37:26] destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou
[1:37:29] Art come to the kingdom for such a time
[1:37:32] as
[1:37:33] this if God didn't think you couldn't
[1:37:36] live the word in this age he wouldn't
[1:37:38] have placed you in this age but God did
[1:37:41] place you in this age and the word of
[1:37:43] God that he has given you is powerful
[1:37:46] sharper than a two-edged sword let's not
[1:37:49] waver my brother and sister let's not
[1:37:51] even let it come from our mouths to say
[1:37:53] I'm not able I can't do this I'm not
[1:37:56] Victorious I have trouble no don't even
[1:37:59] say it rise up and say you know what I
[1:38:02] have come to the kingdom for a Time such
[1:38:04] as this this is the Year this is the
[1:38:07] time this is the season God called me
[1:38:10] and I'm here to perform what God has
[1:38:12] called me
[1:38:14] to amen you're placed in this particular
[1:38:17] time and place for a specific moment
[1:38:21] right exactly right
[1:38:24] right to fulfill a crucial purpose yes
[1:38:28] sir to take action to address a critical
[1:38:33] challenge this all part of
[1:38:36] definitions placed with
[1:38:40] this Leo is the moment you've been
[1:38:42] prepared
[1:38:44] for can we say amen amen but you realize
[1:38:48] just listening to the prophet here a few
[1:38:49] days
[1:38:50] ago we're not even in leod deia anymore
[1:38:54] we've already been called into the
[1:38:56] supernatural beyond the seventh day into
[1:38:59] the eighth A New
[1:39:01] Beginning amen new creatures and a new
[1:39:04] beginning so let's not use leod deia as
[1:39:07] an excuse why I'm in the condition I
[1:39:09] inan God's called you manifested you
[1:39:12] empowered you into a new day into the
[1:39:15] Eighth Day into a new beginning to rise
[1:39:18] up in Heavenly places this is what God's
[1:39:21] called us I'm tired my brother and
[1:39:23] sister of my own self using leoda as an
[1:39:27] excuse it's time for me to stand up and
[1:39:30] say God has placed me in his word which
[1:39:32] is the new beginning of the eighth day
[1:39:35] is the word my brother and sister Christ
[1:39:38] himself and it's time for us to put Leo
[1:39:40] deia aside as an excuse stand up and say
[1:39:44] you know what God said it I can do it
[1:39:46] I've been prepared for this time not for
[1:39:50] years ago or something that might be in
[1:39:52] the fure future but I'm worried about
[1:39:54] being deceived they'll be so close to be
[1:39:57] deceived you get full of the word they
[1:39:59] can't deceive you that's exactly amen
[1:40:01] get anointed by the Holy Ghost they
[1:40:03] can't deceive
[1:40:09] you the moment you've been prepared
[1:40:13] for do you know when you judge Leo
[1:40:16] deia in spiritual
[1:40:19] warfare it would be judged as extreme
[1:40:23] it's a season a time of extreme
[1:40:26] spiritual
[1:40:30] warfare and you know that in an extreme
[1:40:33] Warfare go study the history Romans some
[1:40:37] of the
[1:40:38] others there'll come a time they
[1:40:40] actually fought with
[1:40:42] honor they literally fought with honor
[1:40:45] if you was a man that was struck down
[1:40:47] and you lifted a
[1:40:49] hand you are now a
[1:40:52] prisoner but they passed by you because
[1:40:55] it was a battle of
[1:40:56] Honor but as the Roman Empire progressed
[1:41:00] naturally and
[1:41:01] spiritually they realized that sometimes
[1:41:04] these that they struck down come back
[1:41:07] later and was their adversary again and
[1:41:10] then they took this basically no
[1:41:14] prisoner left behind and you could be
[1:41:17] there and they would just finish you
[1:41:20] helpless as you were this
[1:41:24] is a season of Extreme Warfare y Satan
[1:41:29] doesn't want to just maim you might not
[1:41:32] take your
[1:41:33] life think about job might not take your
[1:41:36] life but he will destroy you every way
[1:41:41] he can destroy you and bring you to a
[1:41:44] place I won't go into the details but
[1:41:45] you'll see people that will acknowledge
[1:41:48] that that they need to come back to the
[1:41:50] roots of their childhood their early
[1:41:52] adulthood they need to come back to that
[1:41:54] but they bring it up oh I couldn't do
[1:41:57] that because my pastor yeah my brother
[1:42:01] and sister their Pastor according to
[1:42:04] those that were sharing this with me
[1:42:06] their pastor's been dead 20
[1:42:08] years but still this pastor is what is
[1:42:12] the reason I can't serve
[1:42:15] God oh my father did this and your
[1:42:20] father is no longer in the picture you
[1:42:23] see I hope I don't offend anybody but
[1:42:25] you see extreme Warfare and Satan
[1:42:29] doesn't just hurt
[1:42:31] people he mimes them
[1:42:34] spiritually tries to knock every bit of
[1:42:37] life out of
[1:42:41] them well it's
[1:42:43] justifiable I was treated
[1:42:46] Ill give you an example young woman in
[1:42:49] the message she's probably about 45
[1:42:51] years old now she doesn't serve God
[1:42:54] today because when she was a kid in the
[1:42:56] church at the fellowships the preachers
[1:42:59] and the
[1:43:00] dads ate all the chicken before any
[1:43:03] wives or
[1:43:10] kids well you must admit I mean surely
[1:43:13] that qualifies as a valid
[1:43:15] excuse white Throne judgment lord I
[1:43:17] can't serve you because they ate the
[1:43:21] chicken come on
[1:43:25] see how Satan's done in this extreme
[1:43:28] Warfare he's given them a delusion and
[1:43:32] by
[1:43:33] delusion not by bodily harm but by
[1:43:35] delusion has killed them to where
[1:43:38] they're hardened against the gospel
[1:43:42] because they ate the
[1:43:45] chicken just in case any of you would
[1:43:47] wonder after I come across that I
[1:43:50] decided I'd just go at the end of the
[1:43:51] line
[1:43:53] when we have fellowships I go at the end
[1:43:54] of the line I'm not going to be accused
[1:43:56] of eating the chicken but I'll stand
[1:43:57] here this morning and tell you there's
[1:43:59] many a time I got to the counter and you
[1:44:01] guys have already eaten the
[1:44:05] chicken should I quit serving
[1:44:08] God no because it's a phony excuse and
[1:44:12] only those that are looking for an
[1:44:14] excuse will find a phony excuse to
[1:44:17] follow if you ate the chicken then I say
[1:44:20] Lord I guess I wasn't supposed to have
[1:44:21] any chicken
[1:44:23] and don't quit eating chicken because I
[1:44:25] said that but I want you to understand
[1:44:28] how phony the excuse can be in
[1:44:34] leoda but anointed it becomes a great
[1:44:38] excuse so the age of extreme spiritual
[1:44:41] warfare see this is an age Satan's
[1:44:43] trying to separate
[1:44:45] us right here in this church we've seen
[1:44:48] the spirits of that trying to separate
[1:44:50] my brother and sister God has a separ
[1:44:53] separator but my brother and sister the
[1:44:55] separator is not Satan's separator
[1:44:59] they're not using the same
[1:45:06] separator as far as the bride who we're
[1:45:08] talking to it's not a time to be
[1:45:10] separated from one another but it's a
[1:45:12] time to be joined
[1:45:13] together and why because just like it
[1:45:16] was with the Jews there at the time of
[1:45:19] hmon there's where our protection is
[1:45:23] amen right you know what we need to be
[1:45:26] as church as
[1:45:31] Believers brother Titus will you stand
[1:45:33] up you can bring your
[1:45:37] sword brother Titus and I should be
[1:45:39] close enough that when the enemy comes
[1:45:43] you know it ain't going to be very long
[1:45:44] he's going to be looking down on
[1:45:47] me brother Titus and I should be close
[1:45:50] enough that when I turn to face my
[1:45:53] me I don't have to worry about my back
[1:45:58] that's right and as Titus turns to face
[1:46:01] his
[1:46:02] enemy he doesn't have to worry about his
[1:46:05] back that's what Satan's trying to
[1:46:11] destroy that's what he wants to take
[1:46:13] away where I don't know if I can depend
[1:46:16] on them they're
[1:46:18] human good don't depend on them as a
[1:46:20] human depend on them as a son or
[1:46:22] daughter of God
[1:46:24] see that Fellowship being destroyed
[1:46:27] tells people no one cares about
[1:46:30] me it tells us I have little or no value
[1:46:33] in the church let me remind you that
[1:46:36] Satan is a liar amen that's not the word
[1:46:39] of God you won't find it in the word so
[1:46:42] therefore that means it's Satan's
[1:46:44] lie so we we come for Mutual defense and
[1:46:48] our
[1:46:49] weapon amen what is our weapon the
[1:46:51] weapons of our Warfare my brother and
[1:46:53] sister the prophet of God showed us very
[1:46:55] clearly that our weapon in this day is
[1:46:58] prayer oh you need the word you need to
[1:47:01] be in the word you need to have a prayer
[1:47:03] life you need all of these things my
[1:47:05] brother and sister but he come down and
[1:47:07] he told us Prayer Changes
[1:47:10] Things amen we should believe
[1:47:14] that modern events I don't even know
[1:47:17] what time it is can I just preach off
[1:47:19] the time of my iPad
[1:47:23] um my iPad says that it's only

[1:49:19] there will not be one person who will
[1:49:20] sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus
[1:49:22] Christ unless he has been living that
[1:49:26] word that's right amen now I liked what
[1:49:29] brother Isaac shared he shared it in the
[1:49:31] office with me and I encouraged him to
[1:49:33] to share it you see there comes a time
[1:49:37] that we have to cite it we have to speak
[1:49:39] it but there's a
[1:49:43] time we have to live it that's right
[1:49:48] right yes sir your prayers your fastings
[1:49:53] your repentance no matter what you
[1:49:55] present to God none of that will gain

[1:50:03] only to the word bride that's right Lord

[1:50:35] Throne of the king is shared with the
[1:50:37] queen because she is United to him so
[1:50:40] only they who are of that word even as

[1:51:01] Assurance amen not blessed hope
[1:51:05] no not my brother and sister it's not
[1:51:08] going to be because you said God sent a
[1:51:10] prophet it's going to be because the

[1:51:14] overflowed from him and was spoken to us
[1:51:18] amen is in us and it will overflow in US
