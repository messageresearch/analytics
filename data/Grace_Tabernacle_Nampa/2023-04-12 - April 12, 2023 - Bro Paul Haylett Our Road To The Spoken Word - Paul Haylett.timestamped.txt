[26:21] Face things in the in the day
[26:24] little circumstances you realize maybe
[26:27] you didn't respond correct or
[26:30] circumstances
[26:33] seem to go sideways
[26:36] and you know Satan's right there
[26:38] to just tell us
[26:41] you've got a problem
[26:44] but I was just reading where the Prophet
[26:46] said and we'll touch on that tonight a
[26:48] little bit
[26:51] it's what voice
[26:54] we listen to
[26:56] there's the whole key to it all what
[27:00] voice amen amen do we listen to amen
[27:05] Hallelujah good to see our brother David
[27:08] Nash amen
[27:09] and I believe brother Isaac you guys are
[27:12] going up to Tri-Cities
[27:14] this coming weekend so brother Isaac's
[27:17] going to go up and uh
[27:20] and uh do a little
[27:22] technical work I believe for the little
[27:25] church there in Tri-Cities
[27:26] amen so you know uh at some point in
[27:30] time somebody broke in and robbed them
[27:32] and that's one of those times you think
[27:34] things went sideways you know how would
[27:37] that be
[27:38] how could someone be low enough to break
[27:40] into a church
[27:42] but the devil's been trying to break in
[27:44] forever amen so
[27:47] yeah exactly so so you know it just uh
[27:53] does so we'll look forward to and uh
[27:56] sister Jerry and I if you just pray for
[27:59] Jerry's stepmom uh Betsy uh we're gonna
[28:03] go up this weekend and uh see see them
[28:08] she has
[28:10] um
[28:11] just had a hard row uh to to go with the
[28:15] brain tumor and removal and it growing
[28:18] back and every time they take it out it
[28:20] comes back quicker and you know the
[28:23] Lord's given us opportunity before and I
[28:27] pray that this time the Lord also gives
[28:30] us opportunity amen I want to just speak
[28:33] to you once again on our journey thank
[28:36] you a beautiful song service actually
[28:38] several songs just spoke to my heart and
[28:41] also I wanted to mention we want to
[28:43] remember Daniel in prayer amen and that
[28:46] God would just continue to to work on
[28:49] him there's things working down inside
[28:51] of him and and we just want to see that
[28:55] come to fruition to serve the Lord and I
[28:58] know Sister April mentioned uh on Sunday
[29:01] that
[29:03] uh the consequence of going to help in
[29:05] Turkey is her work schedule so just
[29:08] remember her uh that they've got her on
[29:12] the grindstone for a while here till she
[29:15] gets back into a normal routine let's
[29:17] turn in our Bibles I want to speak to
[29:19] you on our journey and we've been
[29:22] talking about when our lord Jesus is on
[29:24] the road and tonight I want to just
[29:26] title this our road to this spoken word
[29:29] amen so you know uh it's so beautiful
[29:33] that we can look in scripture and see
[29:36] the parallels of of the word as it was
[29:39] recorded in that day and realize it's
[29:42] alive and well and representative of
[29:45] today amen so we don't have to look at
[29:48] historical scripture and say my that was
[29:51] interesting history it's here it's now
[29:54] it's part of who we are and God's giving
[29:56] us in this dark age is the prophet of
[29:59] God declared this would be the declining
[30:02] in in the Candlestick or the declining
[30:05] and darkness almost completely covering
[30:08] everything that we are here in that age
[30:11] and and this age I should say in this
[30:14] time and to have the insight into the
[30:17] word of God that has been given to us
[30:19] what a privilege God has given of this
[30:23] insight to see what the whole plan of
[30:25] Satan remember job he didn't understand
[30:28] what was going on but by God placing
[30:31] that in the word and revealing that to
[30:33] us we realize that God has opened the
[30:36] Hedge on our lives and Satan has that
[30:39] opportunity but by God's grace we also
[30:43] know through the word God's opinion of
[30:46] us amen that we can sit here and God
[30:49] says these are my servants I have full
[30:51] confidence in them and so we can stand
[30:54] today in the test and the trials the
[30:56] struggle and not be discouraged and
[30:58] wonder what is going wrong do I have a
[31:00] secret sin but to recognize that that
[31:03] Satan is truly roaring amen but he is
[31:07] not even a lion in the context of
[31:10] scripture because our lion is a lion of
[31:13] the tribe of Judah and he's a conqueror
[31:16] amen and that's the God we serve amen
[31:19] our road to the spoken word tonight will
[31:21] start in Matthew the 8th chapter we'll
[31:24] read verses 5 through 17 and I just
[31:29] trust there's so much more you know I
[31:31] was there and I wanted to draw more out
[31:33] of this the first four verses are you
[31:35] might say another story uh but I as when
[31:39] I got down to this I was like I need to
[31:41] condense this and you know it's
[31:43] interesting I trust that truly we do
[31:45] have a good service tonight it has
[31:47] started off very well today I spent my
[31:50] lunch hour uh finalizing my my thought
[31:54] and just as it was getting to the point
[31:57] I'm looking at the clock I've already
[31:58] taken an hour and 20 minutes for lunch
[32:00] and I need to go back to work and my
[32:03] iPad crashed
[32:05] and everything I had
[32:07] just disappeared
[32:10] and you know it's interesting because
[32:12] sister Jerry's like well maybe the Lord
[32:14] wanted you to speak something a little
[32:17] different because you've been studying
[32:19] by inspiration you look up little
[32:21] thoughts and you have little things and
[32:23] isn't it strange that you come back just
[32:25] a mere four hours later to try and get
[32:29] this all back together
[32:31] and you can't remember that one little
[32:33] quote that you had and there was another
[32:35] scripture what was that I never wrote it
[32:38] down it was by inspiration I looked it
[32:40] up and brought it and put it in there
[32:42] and
[32:43] we just pray God's will his way is
[32:45] perfect tonight amen
[32:48] amen Matthew the eighth chapter starting
[32:50] with the fifth verse and when Jesus was
[32:54] entered into Capernaum there came unto
[32:57] him a centurion beseeching him and
[33:00] saying Lord my servant lieth at home
[33:03] sick of the palsy grievously tormented
[33:07] and Jesus saith unto him I will come and
[33:11] heal him not I'll come and we'll see
[33:13] what happens just a matter of fact
[33:15] statement I will come
[33:18] and heal him
[33:19] the Centurion answered and said Lord I
[33:22] am not worthy that thou shouldest come
[33:24] under my roof but speak the word only
[33:28] and my servant shall be healed my I want
[33:34] to be that kind of Christian amen I want
[33:36] to be able to voice that kind of
[33:38] confidence amen as the prophet of God
[33:42] says we should be able to trust God that
[33:45] much
[33:47] thank you Lord
[33:48] for I'm a man under Authority having
[33:51] soldiers under me and I say to this man
[33:53] go and he goeth and to another come and
[33:56] he cometh and to my servant do this and
[33:58] he doeth it when Jesus heard it he
[34:01] marveled now this must really my brother
[34:04] and sister there was a much deeper
[34:06] impact right because our lord Jesus is
[34:09] marveling I want to do something in my
[34:12] life not not to show to the public not
[34:15] to show to anyone else but I want to
[34:17] have an expression in my life that my
[34:20] Lord Jesus would Marvel and say this is
[34:24] my daughter this is my son
[34:27] oh Hallelujah I'll tell you that just
[34:30] stirs my heart
[34:32] he heard it he marveled and said to them
[34:35] that followed verily I say unto you I
[34:37] have not found so great faith no not in
[34:41] Israel and I say unto you that many
[34:43] shall come from the East and West and
[34:46] shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac
[34:48] and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but
[34:51] the children of the Kingdom shall be
[34:53] cast out into outer Darkness there shall
[34:55] be weeping and gnashing of teeth Jesus
[34:58] said unto the Centurion go thy way
[35:02] and as thou Hast believed
[35:08] do you realize Saints this is a little
[35:11] farther but I just feel to put it right
[35:12] here
[35:14] he had already made a declaration of
[35:16] what he believed
[35:18] he didn't have to go away and say now
[35:19] what will it be what will happen because
[35:21] it's going to be what I believe
[35:24] and do you realize as the prophet
[35:26] several ways that he says what is the
[35:28] evidence of the Holy Ghost in our day
[35:30] we're not here to try and focus it to
[35:32] this one pinpoint but I want to bring
[35:34] this the prophet said evidence of the
[35:37] Holy Ghost in our day is recognizing and
[35:41] acting on every word of God
[35:45] for our day now that's a pretty
[35:47] encompassing statement right we just
[35:50] don't come down and say ah oh I believe
[35:53] and I go to a message Church
[35:55] no no this this is the life within the
[35:59] life
[36:00] this is the truth expressed and we are
[36:04] ministering amen every single day what
[36:08] we believe
[36:10] Lord help us Heavenly Father we ask for
[36:13] your guidance tonight Lord just lead us
[36:15] guide us father may come forth

[36:36] him a quick recovery and Lord be with

[36:41] sisters not here tonight the many needs
[36:43] that there are in this assembly we ask
[36:46] you to touch father each and every one
[36:49] in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may
[36:52] be seated
[36:57] thank you
[37:00] as my throat got all scratchy this
[37:03] afternoon Brother David I was even
[37:04] joking with sister Jerry that it might
[37:07] be a short notice to call you up and say
[37:09] Brother David you got about 20 minutes
[37:11] to be ready but you know a real minister
[37:14] of God has always got something burning
[37:17] amen the fire never goes out amen now as
[37:20] Jesus was on his journey my brother and
[37:22] sister are going through the land and it
[37:24] wasn't just that he decided he would
[37:26] walk to and fro and here and there but
[37:29] what he was doing was at the key time
[37:32] you might say a Divine appointment that
[37:34] he was making his presence making The
[37:37] Presence of Jehovah known in the land
[37:40] and it is that in the day that we live
[37:43] in God has repeated once again now there
[37:46] are millions of people who do not know
[37:49] the revealed word of the hour my brother
[37:51] and sister but there's still a voice in
[37:54] the land is that not correct there's
[37:56] still a Ministry still you might say if
[37:59] you would understand correctly a
[38:01] prophecy amen Prophet still going now my
[38:05] brother and sister when we are
[38:07] prophesying today it is not our ministry
[38:09] but it is the ministry of Jesus Christ
[38:13] manifested in us so we can't stand up
[38:16] and say I I have a Ministry you know and
[38:19] and raise our self up but today tonight
[38:22] we should be able each one to lift our
[38:24] hand and say I have a Ministry amen
[38:27] whether it's a mother to her children or
[38:30] that neighbor or however it might be we
[38:33] have a Ministry and as our lord Jesus
[38:36] was traveling through the country as we
[38:38] have just touched on different examples
[38:41] here he was there making the presence
[38:43] not not of this man and now we have a
[38:46] book at home that I have been reading
[38:48] I've been gleaning a few things from
[38:50] because even in a book written in this
[38:53] fashion it was a National Geographic and
[38:56] uh it is a a big thick book about Jesus
[38:59] and some of the things the man writes he
[39:03] writes things such as you know Jesus was
[39:06] perplexed whether his ministry was
[39:08] making a difference
[39:10] almighty God in flesh perplexed
[39:14] oh my brother and sister I'll tell you
[39:16] what's perplexed is their understanding
[39:18] of God is what's perplexed amen that
[39:20] they believe it because they're having a
[39:23] hard time even though they would say
[39:24] he's Divine they cannot put him in the
[39:27] realm of truly who he was and what he
[39:31] was here for and so our lord Jesus is
[39:34] traveling through the land and you know
[39:36] as he comes my brother and sister into
[39:38] Capernaum it is there that you know the
[39:41] crowd the throng is with them always and
[39:44] you know he had just come from the
[39:46] presence of a leper and I want to save
[39:48] the lepers for a another service well
[39:51] we'll uh lump some lepers together amen
[39:55] but you look at that and realize he just
[39:57] had a supernatural encounter with one
[40:01] who was considered unclean and this is
[40:03] just the point on that that I want to
[40:05] make my brother and sister it's one
[40:07] thing to recognize that a man is unclean
[40:10] on the external but God didn't come just
[40:13] to deal with the extra Eternal and he
[40:15] knew what Spirits there would be on the
[40:17] internal and he come to deal with the
[40:20] unclean period amen and I'm glad my
[40:23] brother and sister because I was born in
[40:25] sin and shaped in iniquity and God come
[40:27] amen and has changed our lives thank you
[40:31] Lord Jesus for that and so as he comes
[40:35] into the entrance or he's coming into
[40:37] Capernaum this Centurion now this man my
[40:40] brother and sister just by the very
[40:42] nature I can see him he's not some
[40:45] little Ruddy fellow but he is a man that
[40:48] no doubt the crowd separated for him as
[40:51] he would come a man no doubt of great uh
[40:54] uh courage and Valor and strength and
[40:57] presence to him and as he comes through
[40:59] the crowd he's not coming to show his
[41:02] natural abilities not coming to make
[41:05] some great declaration but there is
[41:07] something that has gripped him something
[41:10] that has come upon him and it is his a
[41:15] desire to his servant now we don't know
[41:18] what this relationship was how close
[41:20] this servant was to him and you know you
[41:23] might say as maybe a right-hand man just
[41:25] knew the nature of his master and just
[41:28] knew how to make life good for him and
[41:31] and that but this man comes and he has
[41:34] such a desire to his servant that he has
[41:37] made the effort we don't know just how
[41:39] far he traveled uh brother Branham says
[41:42] you know we don't know exactly where he
[41:44] come from he could have this or he could
[41:45] have that and it's irrelevant he put out
[41:48] an effort above and beyond he no doubt
[41:52] could have just said well if he dies
[41:53] I'll get another servant but he was a
[41:55] man no doubt that had a good heart a
[41:57] kind heart a Desiring heart might even
[42:00] have been touched by the gospel
[42:04] and he's coming
[42:06] and he's beseeching our lord Jesus now
[42:10] the word beseech is to keep the
[42:13] definition simple is fervent
[42:17] so this was not a hey if you find time
[42:20] are you headed this direction or that
[42:23] direction can I have a moment out of
[42:26] your busy schedule but he was fervently
[42:29] asking our lord Jesus oh my brother and
[42:32] sister this is going to pinch Paul I
[42:34] don't know if it'll pinch you but I
[42:36] wonder my brother and sister if the
[42:38] devil hasn't affected our prayer life
[42:40] enough that we have a hard time getting
[42:43] fervent
[42:45] are we approaching our lord Jesus
[42:47] fervently
[42:49] or do we just say well Lord you know
[42:52] this need and you know this need and you
[42:54] know this need Lord bless them help them
[42:56] guide them heal them touch them but to
[42:59] be that it struck me as I was studying
[43:01] this Lord let me get back to a place
[43:03] that my prayers are on fire they're
[43:06] fervent prayers not just prayer amen so
[43:11] he's asking fervently and my brother and
[43:13] sister we have spoke about it in the
[43:15] church here the prophet of God speaks
[43:17] about it we don't want to if we'll quit
[43:20] focusing on ourself and focus on those
[43:23] around us and then be able to with
[43:26] confidence know your brothers your
[43:28] sisters are praying for you as you pray
[43:30] for them and then we enter in fervently
[43:33] we'll have a lot less help me Lord
[43:36] prayers and then help my brother help my
[43:39] sister and as those prayers are you
[43:42] might say Crossing each other will come
[43:44] and find that God is going to move more
[43:47] than us praying Lord help me my
[43:49] situation I have this I have that and we
[43:52] would come and here's a centurion and
[43:55] he's fervently asking our lord Jesus not
[43:58] for himself but for I'm going to use the
[44:01] word a mere servant
[44:03] a servant that doesn't even in the
[44:05] context of scripture have a name
[44:08] he's just at his house
[44:12] James the fifth chapter verses 15 and
[44:14] 16.
[44:16] amen
[44:22] yes I moved ahead a little fast there
[44:24] sorry
[44:26] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[44:28] sick
[44:29] so we're looking at a context here I
[44:32] want to tie this in my brother and
[44:33] sister
[44:34] because this is how we tend to look at
[44:38] things
[44:39] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[44:42] and the Lord shall raise him up and if
[44:44] he have committed sins they shall be
[44:46] forgiven him this is what my brother and
[44:49] sister as verse 16 says this is what
[44:52] fervent effectual prayer does it causes
[44:55] healing to come and it also causes
[44:57] repentance to come and God is willing to
[45:01] tie the two together go listen to the
[45:03] prayer lines go read the prayer line
[45:05] many times the prophet of God is
[45:08] declaring and the world criticizes but
[45:11] he says if you will confess and repent
[45:15] from this God will heal you and they say
[45:17] well he's putting something a
[45:20] requirement to this my brother and
[45:22] sister the word puts a requirement it's
[45:25] not a man amen it's telling you that the
[45:28] prayer of faith shall save the sick and
[45:31] the Lord shall raise him up and if he
[45:33] has committed sins they shall be
[45:34] forgiven why this has to be a heart that
[45:37] is Desiring the things of God firing to
[45:40] be taught Desiring to receive amen now
[45:44] I'm going to step out into limbo land if
[45:46] you don't mind for a moment I just
[45:48] believe as I read this scripture there
[45:51] was a servant that was sick back home
[45:53] who was believing that when his master
[45:57] met Jesus that he would be healed
[46:00] I don't believe he was there as a
[46:02] skeptic as a Critic and the Masters
[46:05] trying to force or Force something upon
[46:07] him there was a servant maybe a
[46:09] conversation had taken place and he says
[46:12] you're dying and he might say I am dying
[46:14] we're going to find Jesus amen please
[46:17] find him I want to live I desire to live
[46:21] and I I need I know there's things that
[46:23] need to change but I'm willing to give
[46:25] them up if he will touch me and I
[46:28] believe my brother and sister that
[46:30] because and we'll touch on this in a
[46:32] moment we often times outcome and
[46:35] believe that our approach is in a
[46:37] certain fashion must be done in a
[46:39] certain way and God sometimes comes and
[46:42] he confounds the wise he confounds he
[46:44] educated in those that have researched
[46:47] and tried to pinpoint what God's going
[46:50] to do next what I want to do is not
[46:52] pinpoint what God's going to do next I
[46:55] want to just walk in his perfect will
[46:57] that whatever he does next I'm in the
[46:59] middle of it amen I'm not on the outside
[47:02] trying to figure out how to get back in
[47:04] but I want to live a life where I'm in
[47:07] the middle of God's Will and when he
[47:09] moves I move with him
[47:11] amen confess your faults one to another
[47:14] and pray one for another so here we're
[47:18] coming now my brother and sister I I tie
[47:21] this if you don't mind me going there I
[47:23] tie this that here is a centurion who
[47:27] cares enough about a servant you realize
[47:30] in this case in that time of history
[47:33] that servant was no doubt a Slave
[47:36] and he cared enough for that slave
[47:40] because he didn't have
[47:42] a as it were Master of the world
[47:45] approach
[47:51] he had love
[47:53] for a servant oh God help us
[47:57] help us the lowly in our midst
[48:01] as we just a few Services ago from the
[48:03] small to the Great
[48:05] amen confess your faults one to another
[48:08] pray for another that she may be healed
[48:12] the effectual fervent amen not casual
[48:16] not weak need not limped not a Beggar's
[48:19] prayer but the effectual fervent prayer
[48:22] of a righteous man of veileth much I'll
[48:25] tell you what my brother and sister I
[48:27] want my prayers to make a difference
[48:30] amen I want them to go and if Satan's
[48:34] trying to build a stronghold I want my
[48:36] prayers to come and I want them to
[48:38] batter down Satan's stronghold I don't
[48:41] want him to go and sign a treaty with
[48:43] him I don't want to sign some kind of
[48:45] agreement you don't bother me I won't
[48:47] bother you but I want my prayers to
[48:51] Avail much amen I want him to make a
[48:55] difference to the kingdom of almighty
[48:57] God
[48:57] amen and I'll tell you sometimes I don't
[49:00] say this is a boast or to lift up but
[49:03] I'll tell you sometimes when you voice
[49:04] things you just have to live it and
[49:07] lately it seems like I've been waking up
[49:09] about 2 30 3 o'clock in the morning I'm
[49:11] not happy about waking up at that time
[49:13] of the morning I want to be asleep
[49:16] but I find myself rolling over in bed
[49:18] and just starting to pray and I just do
[49:22] my very best to pray through the whole
[49:24] valley as it were to touch lives because
[49:26] it's like if the Lord wants me awake at
[49:29] 2 30 in the morning then there must be a
[49:32] reason for me to be up at 2 30 in the
[49:35] morning and so you go and this touches
[49:38] my heart because I want my prayers not
[49:40] to be just going out there and bouncing
[49:42] off the ground I don't want my prayers
[49:45] as an individual told me once brother
[49:46] Paul I feel like my prayers make it to
[49:49] the ceiling and no further
[49:52] I want my I want to have that confidence
[49:54] I want you to have that confidence that
[49:56] our prayers reach the Throne of almighty
[49:59] God and our prayers are coming as a
[50:01] sweet odor Before the Throne
[50:04] amen
[50:07] you can see by this man's approach to
[50:09] Centurion that he believed that Jesus
[50:12] was and Is A Healer
[50:15] he come in this approach making a
[50:18] declaration I need you
[50:23] I need you
[50:29] I can't change my servant's position
[50:32] the priest can't change it you see he
[50:35] might have had an entirely different
[50:37] priest
[50:39] we think you know Jewish priest but
[50:44] the preacher let me put it that way he
[50:46] won't make a difference he had enough
[50:48] Revelation my brother and sister to go
[50:51] straight to the source of life
[50:53] amen so it's there that he he recognized
[50:57] himself as not worthy now that was not
[50:59] demeaning him this man was a man as he
[51:02] makes in his own declaration a man of
[51:04] authority to be able to say come and
[51:07] they come and go and they go and do and
[51:09] they do he knew his position and I'm
[51:12] sure that when the time was sufficient
[51:14] and correct and inappropriate of the
[51:17] time he had no problem saying go come do
[51:21] this do that and yet he comes and says
[51:24] you know what I am not worthy to have
[51:27] you in my house brother Branham ads he
[51:31] says he would not even have been worthy
[51:34] to come into Jesus presence
[51:38] hmm
[51:39] my brother and sister but he did why
[51:43] because he was anointed
[51:45] amen there was a purpose that God had
[51:47] brought it and it wasn't even I don't
[51:49] believe just the healing of his servant
[51:52] I believe this man received a touch from
[51:55] God because you cannot my brother and
[51:57] sister come in the presence of the
[51:59] Supernatural and leave the same
[52:02] the prophet of God said we leave Better
[52:04] or Worse what are we going to choose my
[52:07] brother and sister I don't think it's
[52:08] even a decision to make I want to go
[52:11] away better amen come in the presence of
[52:14] almighty God and I want to be able to
[52:16] walk away a better man a better brother
[52:19] a better Christian
[52:20] amen able to express more of the faith
[52:24] that God has given to you and I amen so
[52:27] he comes with a declaration I'm not
[52:30] worthy
[52:31] amen
[52:33] now we look at this my brother and
[52:35] sister
[52:36] maybe he didn't know much more than that
[52:38] even brother Branham says we really
[52:40] don't know
[52:41] the word doesn't really show us we don't
[52:43] know
[52:44] what did he know what had he heard
[52:48] Rahab had heard of the power of the
[52:52] supernatural God of Israel while she's
[52:55] living in the middle of Jericho oh don't
[52:59] tell me that God can't send the message
[53:01] wherever God wants to send the message
[53:04] and have the message reach whoever he
[53:07] wants the message to reach
[53:10] oh my people act almost like afraid oh
[53:13] we're not going to get the message where
[53:15] it belongs my brother and sister God
[53:17] will get the message where it belongs
[53:20] it's his message he'll deliver it
[53:23] oh my
[53:25] God thank you Lord he delivered it to
[53:27] our house
[53:28] amen thank you Lord
[53:31] so so we don't know what he knew but he
[53:34] might not have known much more than that
[53:36] my brother and sister but look how much
[53:38] more that we should know in this hour in
[53:41] the day that we're living amen we should
[53:44] have a revelation we should have a grasp
[53:47] of what God is Desiring we have the word
[53:50] of the hour the revealed word of the
[53:53] hour we're not here as job was in limbo
[53:56] of what was happening in his life his
[53:58] friend says the secret sin he's
[54:00] examining saying I don't have a secret
[54:02] sin do I Lord no I don't believe I do
[54:04] and his friends are still insistent you
[54:07] had to do something wrong he was in
[54:09] limbo but we're here today recognizing
[54:12] the spirits of the age recognizing the
[54:15] demons that are opposed of us the things
[54:17] that would happen how that Satan would
[54:19] put the stumbling Stone in front of us
[54:22] and God says I'm not going to keep you
[54:24] from stumbling in other words you are
[54:26] still maybe years and years of not
[54:29] having a temper tantrum find yourself up
[54:31] upset over something and we oh Lord what
[54:34] happened but what God was doing was just
[54:37] giving us a reminder of his Amazing
[54:39] Grace it was not a sign that we have
[54:41] backslid and Fallen but a reminder you
[54:44] might say a memorial of God's Amazing
[54:47] Grace in our lives and what it does is
[54:49] it starts to come that where the prophet
[54:52] of God puts it this way when our
[54:54] experience starts to get stale God will
[54:57] make it fresh again
[55:00] oh it might be a little repenting time
[55:02] at an altar to get it fresh again but
[55:05] God's not going to let his bride their
[55:07] experience get stale oh thank you Lord
[55:11] amen and how much more we should know
[55:14] today my brother and sister the faith
[55:16] that God has given amen a prophet's
[55:19] words that says the faith all the faith
[55:22] everything you need these are just my
[55:24] way of putting it uh the faith in
[55:26] everything you'll need to make the
[55:27] Rapture is already my brother my sister
[55:30] already in you
[55:33] we don't got to run over here and search
[55:34] for it I've got to find some experience
[55:36] I gotta run over here I gotta go to this
[55:39] I gotta go to there I need to talk to a
[55:41] special person
[55:43] it's in you
[55:44] God's using that that stumbling Stone
[55:47] might actually be a releasing of
[55:50] something in your life that would cause
[55:53] you then to stand up and say I am
[55:55] resolved no longer to linger
[55:59] but I'm pressing forward
[56:02] Hallelujah
[56:04] amen now we look at this uh now I just
[56:08] love verse 7 Jesus says um
[56:10] yeah
[56:12] I'll come and heal him that's pretty
[56:15] matter matter of fact isn't it no deal
[56:17] like well tell me what the circumstance
[56:19] is is he a good guy a bad guy is he a
[56:22] faithful servant an Unfaithful servant
[56:23] is he fruitful
[56:25] Jesus said
[56:27] he's looking at this man
[56:29] and I'll tell you my brother and sister
[56:30] this is why the scripture tells us to be
[56:32] careful of the company we keep that's
[56:34] right
[56:36] if we could go into the mind of God we'd
[56:39] look at that but there's scriptures that
[56:40] deal with it so I believe we do have the
[56:42] mind of God
[56:43] amen
[56:45] he looks at Centurion and says my
[56:48] a servant to a man like this
[56:51] now this is just brother Paul saying
[56:52] this okay
[56:54] a servant to a man like this
[56:57] is going to be a good man
[57:01] but did Jesus really look at that
[57:04] because if he was looking for just good
[57:05] men
[57:07] I might have got left out
[57:12] Jesus
[57:15] many years ago
[57:18] I won't go into the whole gist of it
[57:21] I didn't know how to pray
[57:24] you have somebody that's
[57:27] been a good Christian for a lot of years
[57:29] maybe up in age a little bit and
[57:31] things catching up with them and you
[57:34] hear they're in the hospital and
[57:37] you think Lord
[57:40] would it be better you just took them
[57:42] home
[57:45] I didn't know how to pray
[57:49] then one day it's revealed to me
[57:54] Lord thy will be done
[57:58] and we always pray for life
[58:02] but we're giving
[58:04] that open door because really Saints
[58:08] what is life to a believer
[58:11] so when you're giving permission as it
[58:14] were
[58:14] because you realize we have to give God
[58:16] permission
[58:17] the prophet of God said that the holy
[58:19] spirit's a gentleman
[58:21] won't go
[58:22] won't come in where he's not invited
[58:25] amen so this context I've been told that
[58:28] I'm totally messed up on this but we
[58:30] have to give God permission
[58:33] and so by praying in that fashion Lord
[58:36] thy will be done but we're praying for
[58:39] life you are there open the door whether
[58:42] it's natural life or spiritual life amen
[58:45] you are and then surrendering your
[58:48] desire to God's desire and my brother
[58:51] and sister sometimes it's just that
[58:53] simple
[58:55] Lord we have to give them to you that
[58:58] thy will be done
[59:00] so it's there that Jesus says I'll come
[59:02] and heal him and now we're seeing
[59:05] something this very very incredible the
[59:08] Centurion answered and said Lord I am
[59:11] not worthy that thou should cometh under
[59:13] my roof but speak the word only and my
[59:17] servant shall be healed now you realize
[59:20] what was happening there my brother and
[59:22] sister this Centurion who is a gentile
[59:24] is speaking by Revelation something that
[59:28] uh maybe he understood in its context
[59:31] but maybe he did not anointed to speak
[59:34] of that because you see what he was
[59:35] doing he was actually opening a new
[59:38] dispensation to the Gentiles he was
[59:41] actually opening a new expression from
[59:44] the word amen because it's completely
[59:46] scripture where he was standing and it's
[59:49] there at this time that he is dealing
[59:51] Jesus is dealing with the Jews and now
[59:54] as he deals with this Centurion he
[59:56] speaks of something that is not often in
[1:00:00] or
[1:00:01] ever heard
[1:00:03] are you with me
[1:00:07] I put this taking this from a quote here
[1:00:10] uh as that he was speaking a new
[1:00:13] dispensation
[1:00:14] a new opening of the word and brother
[1:00:17] Branham says in Hebrews chapter 3 amen
[1:00:20] that uh it's there he says now Paul
[1:00:23] trying to get later on get down here the
[1:00:27] experience that he had see trying to
[1:00:30] relate The Experience he typed it to the
[1:00:33] Old Testament he said now we've entered
[1:00:35] into a new thing to this new
[1:00:38] dispensation by Jesus Christ old times
[1:00:42] the Lord appeared to them by the
[1:00:44] prophets but now he's by his son Jesus
[1:00:48] so in the presence of Jesus this Gentile
[1:00:52] Centurion has a revelation that is
[1:00:57] expressed from him maybe it was not a
[1:01:00] intellectual theological understanding
[1:01:03] but it was the heart speaking when he
[1:01:06] makes this declaration don't come to my
[1:01:09] house just speak the word oh my brother
[1:01:12] and sister I want to type this in in
[1:01:15] many ways tonight but it would take too
[1:01:17] long but you see it comes down why we
[1:01:20] don't have a Mecca we don't need to go
[1:01:22] to a certain place we don't need to go
[1:01:25] into a church and rub the foot of a
[1:01:27] statue or rub the hand you know brother
[1:01:29] Brown talks about that and I have been
[1:01:31] privileged to be in different places in
[1:01:34] Europe and to see that and they've
[1:01:36] replaced those hands you can see that
[1:01:38] and they're almost completely rubbed off
[1:01:40] again to see a young woman in complete
[1:01:43] uh despair coming in putting her coins
[1:01:46] in the Box lighting the candle going
[1:01:48] over and putting the candle and bowing
[1:01:51] before a statue and rubbing the feet
[1:01:53] while she's crying my brother and sister
[1:01:56] God has come and given us a new
[1:01:59] revelation are you with me amen this new
[1:02:03] dispensation by Jesus Christ old times
[1:02:06] the Lord appeared to them by the prophet
[1:02:08] now it's by his son Jesus and he began
[1:02:11] to type the experience and show them
[1:02:13] what was taking Place how the signs and
[1:02:16] wonders and everything what's wrote and
[1:02:18] you want to express or expand on that
[1:02:21] just go look that up and read before and
[1:02:23] after but it's looking there I took this
[1:02:25] thought as it struck me this new
[1:02:27] dispensation what was happening God was
[1:02:30] saying I'm going to deal with the
[1:02:32] Gentiles differently than I deal with
[1:02:34] the Jews and I'm going to open the word
[1:02:37] to them and actually give in one sense a
[1:02:40] greater portion than the Jews ever had
[1:02:43] because now and taking this going to
[1:02:45] bring them behind the veil into my
[1:02:49] presence amen and I'm going to reveal
[1:02:52] myself as a bridegroom amen you realize
[1:02:55] that God didn't come to Israel in that
[1:02:58] context he come in that way and Israel
[1:03:01] only knew that way and here is a
[1:03:04] centurion and and he is now speaking out
[1:03:08] something that must have confounded
[1:03:10] those around him
[1:03:11] and Jesus is astonished and says you
[1:03:14] know I haven't seen this great of faith
[1:03:16] not in all of Israel he's speaking of
[1:03:19] all these people who have not enough
[1:03:22] Faith to take out and simply State the
[1:03:25] word now we'll touch on this a little
[1:03:27] bit more in a minute I'm not confusing
[1:03:29] am I I find myself my thoughts are just
[1:03:31] racing so fast that I'm kind of
[1:03:33] struggling a little bit forgive me
[1:03:35] and so it's there that he says just
[1:03:38] speak the word only and so then he goes
[1:03:41] uh verses 9 and uh tan and he and he
[1:03:45] describes that I'm under Authority and I
[1:03:48] have soldiers and I say to this man and
[1:03:51] uh to another come and go and my servant
[1:03:53] do and he doeth and Jesus Marvels as we
[1:03:57] read all her earlier and he says verily
[1:04:00] I say unto you I've not found so great
[1:04:01] faith no not in Israel look at this my
[1:04:05] brother and sister he had a revelation
[1:04:08] people would have come and said where
[1:04:10] did you get that I can't find that in
[1:04:12] the message well I'll tell you what
[1:04:14] happened was as I heard a prophet make a
[1:04:17] declaration one day he said you know
[1:04:19] this love letter I'm over in Africa and
[1:04:21] the wife sends this letter and I'm
[1:04:24] reading the letter I'm reading the words
[1:04:26] on the line but I'm reading between the
[1:04:29] lines and people will say you're going
[1:04:31] to get messed up if you read between the
[1:04:33] lines but not when it's a love letter
[1:04:36] you won't get messed up if it's just a
[1:04:39] letter on the page right here you read
[1:04:41] between the lines you'll get confused
[1:04:43] but when this becomes a love letter to
[1:04:47] you you'll read between the lines and
[1:04:49] the prophet of God says the word will
[1:04:51] speak to you the word Jesus Christ will
[1:04:54] speak to you between the lines
[1:04:58] oh my brother and sister have been told
[1:05:00] people like you're gonna just take your
[1:05:02] track Church into a wreck reading
[1:05:05] between the lines well I'll tell you
[1:05:06] what my brother and sister if I'm
[1:05:08] reading your love letters I'm not going
[1:05:10] to be able to understand totally but
[1:05:13] when I'm reading my love letters amen
[1:05:16] there's something that speaks out that
[1:05:18] no one else understands and brother
[1:05:21] Branham says and she's there I'm doing
[1:05:23] the laundry what's that going to say to
[1:05:25] anyone else must have a lot of laundry
[1:05:29] what is spoke to the prophet of God and
[1:05:32] he declares this I miss you I love you
[1:05:35] I'm thinking of you
[1:05:37] oh Hallelujah aren't you glad you can
[1:05:40] read between the lines
[1:05:42] amen so it was there a revelation just
[1:05:47] speak the word now my brother and sister
[1:05:49] I'm going to condense some of this I
[1:05:50] have down here it just seems like time
[1:05:53] escapes but look at this now how many
[1:05:55] times the prophet of God he told us that
[1:06:00] you have to come to the place that the
[1:06:03] book becomes alive to you
[1:06:07] amen there's a reason he said it has to
[1:06:10] be alive he wasn't just filling the page
[1:06:12] with words it's at the point that it
[1:06:15] becomes alive that something stirs in
[1:06:18] the heart of the believer amen and
[1:06:21] that's why the prophet of God said pray
[1:06:22] for Revelation amen you come as a
[1:06:25] centurion you've got a sick servant and
[1:06:27] you come and you say hey there's rumors
[1:06:30] around Israel that you've been doing
[1:06:31] some strange phenomenal kind of things
[1:06:34] and I'm just wondering if you'll come
[1:06:35] down and you'll do that on this no my
[1:06:38] brother and sister this man come he was
[1:06:40] already convinced he was already sold
[1:06:41] out he was already a believer
[1:06:44] amen cause only a Believer can speak the
[1:06:47] word in that fashion people say we don't
[1:06:50] have any evidence that the man was a
[1:06:52] Christian but I'm telling you you have
[1:06:54] to have the Holy Ghost to declare that
[1:06:57] Jesus is the Christ and he come in that
[1:07:00] essence of declaring you the word just
[1:07:03] need to speak
[1:07:06] okay we can scramble those words can't
[1:07:08] we just speak the word or the word just
[1:07:12] needs to speak
[1:07:13] amen and when the word spoke my brother
[1:07:16] and sister there was something that
[1:07:19] stirred in this man's heart amen and
[1:07:22] Jesus says you know what hey I I I see
[1:07:25] this Revelation in him and he's trusting
[1:07:29] in the spoken word
[1:07:33] oh my brother and sister
[1:07:36] Jesus said it was manifestation
[1:07:39] of great faith
[1:07:43] I have not seen such great faith in all
[1:07:46] of Israel
[1:07:50] look how this is Faith is always coming
[1:07:52] up as a point isn't it
[1:07:55] almost every minister is always touching
[1:07:58] on faith
[1:08:01] faith
[1:08:02] faith
[1:08:05] and here comes a man brother Trevor I
[1:08:08] just my heart just jumped up and down
[1:08:11] amen here comes a man
[1:08:14] who says word
[1:08:17] bear with me a little bit Saints word
[1:08:21] just speak
[1:08:25] just speak
[1:08:28] I believe if you'll just
[1:08:33] word of God Speak
[1:08:36] fall down like rain
[1:08:39] oh Hallelujah
[1:08:41] amen and he caught that Revelation and
[1:08:44] Jesus says that was great faith and I
[1:08:46] want to just come to you my brother and
[1:08:48] sister and here we are today I believe
[1:08:51] we can lift our hands and say we are
[1:08:53] here and we have heard the word speak
[1:08:56] and we said amen to the word and we come
[1:08:59] before God whether at home or in church
[1:09:01] speak my Lord speak my Lord now look
[1:09:05] we'll say I I need more faith can can we
[1:09:08] honestly just admit that we sometimes
[1:09:10] say Lord I need more faith well I want
[1:09:13] to tell you when you are saying Speak to
[1:09:15] Me Lord speak the word speak truth to me
[1:09:18] Jesus Christ because he's the same
[1:09:20] yesterday today and forever is saying I
[1:09:23] see great faith
[1:09:26] oh my brother and sister are not Faith
[1:09:28] to go out and make this happen and make
[1:09:30] that happen but Faith to stand and say
[1:09:34] speak the word my Lord and my heart my
[1:09:37] soul will respond to it it will bring
[1:09:40] life
[1:09:42] oh Hallelujah
[1:09:44] look at this now in the message the
[1:09:46] countdown
[1:09:48] Hallelujah
[1:09:50] I believe that's right there
[1:09:54] now the first thing is these things that
[1:09:56] we're talking about are they so are they
[1:09:59] not we know the Bible promised it but is
[1:10:02] he here
[1:10:04] God is here to do what we what he
[1:10:08] promised that he would do God is here
[1:10:11] see can we say Amen to that God is here
[1:10:15] see we've gone beyond speaking with
[1:10:18] tongues now I want to I want to just
[1:10:20] throw a little Clarity sister and Jerry
[1:10:22] and I have a conversation my brother and
[1:10:24] sister when the prophet of God says
[1:10:26] we've gone beyond speaking in tongues he
[1:10:28] is not cutting it off he is not throwing
[1:10:30] it to the side he's telling us that it
[1:10:33] is not the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:10:35] Ghost that's been preached this Doctrine
[1:10:37] we understand that it's not proof
[1:10:40] as the world wants to make it proof
[1:10:44] amen
[1:10:46] he's saying we've be gone beyond
[1:10:48] speaking with tongues that's all right
[1:10:49] see we've be gone beyond these little
[1:10:52] things and some people will take that
[1:10:53] and say see now that's just nothing but
[1:10:56] look what brother Branham is really
[1:10:57] showing us is God has led his dear
[1:11:01] children along amen and when he leads us
[1:11:04] to your children along there's a time
[1:11:07] and a season that we pass through every
[1:11:09] bit we cross our Red Sea we have crossed
[1:11:12] our Wilderness of sin we have come into
[1:11:15] our time of Purim or the purging of the
[1:11:18] cleansing we've come through all of
[1:11:20] these we've got our feasts my brother
[1:11:22] and sister hasn't went away it's just
[1:11:24] come in another manifestation where God
[1:11:27] has raised us up in Revelation to look
[1:11:30] at what God was doing in the Old
[1:11:32] Testament and what he meant in the New
[1:11:34] Testament and find a perfectly mesh
[1:11:36] together he didn't throw one away the
[1:11:39] word says He didn't come to do away with
[1:11:41] the law but come to fulfill the law I
[1:11:44] say Lord fulfill the law in me fulfill
[1:11:47] it me Lord that whatever you desire Lord
[1:11:50] I don't have to dodge it I don't have to
[1:11:52] find an excuse why not I can come and
[1:11:55] say Lord just let the life
[1:11:57] manifest in me
[1:12:00] let me be who you want me to be now look
[1:12:03] at the reason brother Brown I'm saying
[1:12:05] this and see we're into a place now
[1:12:06] we've got to have astronaut Faith he
[1:12:10] doesn't say now if you're going to be
[1:12:12] spiritual you need astronaut Faith he
[1:12:14] says you've got to have we're living in
[1:12:17] a different age with a culmination of
[1:12:20] spirits with Satan attacking on every uh
[1:12:23] away every behalf no
[1:12:28] you got to have astronaut Faith amen
[1:12:31] amen because if we stay EarthBound
[1:12:34] all we're going to do is talk about
[1:12:36] living in Heavenly places
[1:12:38] we've got to get on the rocket of the
[1:12:41] revelation of God's word and get up out
[1:12:44] of the muck and the mire
[1:12:46] my oh my that's astronaut power see now
[1:12:50] look at this some of you may be already
[1:12:52] read ahead I don't know what to do about
[1:12:53] you guys
[1:12:54] that's astronaut power look at this now
[1:12:58] to realize that we're in Christ already
[1:13:03] and we're not like struggling to get in
[1:13:05] Christ amen what we got to struggle to
[1:13:08] realize is that we are already shaking
[1:13:10] off our Earthly bound uh bindings or
[1:13:14] chains uh whatever you want to call it
[1:13:17] we're shaking that off already and
[1:13:20] moving up into a relationship into
[1:13:22] Heavenly places that's how realize we're
[1:13:25] in Christ already just more of Christ
[1:13:27] see to list Lift us up in Heavenly
[1:13:30] places
[1:13:31] the old method now look at this
[1:13:34] the old method of praying laying hands
[1:13:37] on the sick that's good that was
[1:13:39] Luther's day's friend now you've got to
[1:13:42] understand in the countdown what brother
[1:13:44] Brown's talking about the progression of
[1:13:46] man
[1:13:46] amen so that we make sure we understand
[1:13:49] where he's going there that was Luther
[1:13:50] day's friends back in the automobile and
[1:13:53] so forth were beyond that now what are
[1:13:57] we doing we're moving up into Heavenly
[1:14:00] places we're not Earthbound we're moving
[1:14:03] into Heavenly places amen remember Jesus
[1:14:06] come to the Jews the old days Jairus
[1:14:09] said Jairus said come and lay your hands
[1:14:11] upon my daughter and she'll live but the
[1:14:13] Romans said I'm not worthy that you come
[1:14:16] just speak the word oh look where the
[1:14:19] Prophet was sending us or trying to get
[1:14:21] us to go my brother and sister to come
[1:14:24] that mothers sisters brothers you don't
[1:14:26] have to be preachers you don't have to
[1:14:28] be this or that you just going to come
[1:14:30] with a revelation that God put in you in
[1:14:33] this day speak the word
[1:14:36] I've got a sick child in the name of
[1:14:38] Jesus Christ I declare healing amen I
[1:14:42] need a situation Lord you know my motive

[1:14:52] in a way
[1:14:54] or commanding us in a way
[1:14:58] amen
[1:15:00] speak the word amen
[1:15:03] he recognized the power of Christ see
[1:15:05] this is how brother Branham this is how
[1:15:07] brother Branham describes this Roman
[1:15:10] Centurion
[1:15:12] he recognized the power of Christ
[1:15:16] that he was over all things what did he
[1:15:18] do he come submitted himself
[1:15:22] now get this he didn't debate himself
[1:15:27] he submitted himself
[1:15:30] do you know in the natural world of
[1:15:31] business when you're interacting with
[1:15:33] people they might be younger than you
[1:15:35] they might whatever it would be but
[1:15:37] you're talking a position of respect one
[1:15:39] way to come and deal with him is in the
[1:15:42] very Forefront of your business dealings
[1:15:46] sir
[1:15:49] regardless of their age
[1:15:51] you are doing and you'll find or at
[1:15:54] least I have found in my life they
[1:15:56] almost always reciprocate
[1:15:59] and instead of some casual you or that
[1:16:02] or Bob or Paul
[1:16:04] it is on a higher level
[1:16:08] and the Centurion had come
[1:16:12] saying I have authority and I know I
[1:16:14] have authority
[1:16:16] I speak
[1:16:17] it happens
[1:16:21] but I'm submitting to you
[1:16:23] oh isn't that beautiful
[1:16:26] that we can come with confidence let me
[1:16:28] express it this way we can come in
[1:16:30] confidence in this life as a confident
[1:16:32] believer a confident businessman or
[1:16:35] whatever it might be and submit to the
[1:16:38] Lord
[1:16:39] it doesn't make us less of a man or a
[1:16:41] woman amen it just puts us in a correct
[1:16:44] position
[1:16:45] that we can step into and it unlocks a
[1:16:48] channel
[1:16:49] amen now look at this he recognized the
[1:16:52] power of Christ that he was over all
[1:16:54] things now if Christ is over all things
[1:16:56] he's got to keep his word he is King he
[1:16:59] is God he must keep his word The Works
[1:17:02] that I do shall you also
[1:17:05] oh my I like that amen God's got to keep
[1:17:09] his word he obligated himself when he
[1:17:11] said the works that I'm going to do
[1:17:13] you're going to do also so what was it
[1:17:15] my brother and sister as Jesus spoke the
[1:17:18] word he has declared to you and I that
[1:17:21] you will speak the word and when you
[1:17:25] speak the word it will bring results
[1:17:28] oh what are the words that we're going
[1:17:30] to choose to speak that will be the real
[1:17:32] question amen amen now as far as healing
[1:17:37] somebody nobody can do it because it's
[1:17:39] already done it's already done
[1:17:41] it's just a recognition of it see the
[1:17:44] recognition that he is in our presence
[1:17:49] my goodness my brother and sister
[1:17:50] there's people in the message that still
[1:17:53] believe God's gone somewhere out in The
[1:17:55] Ether and we're here just calling out to
[1:17:58] him they struggle with the idea that God
[1:18:02] is in US
[1:18:05] come on here's the word
[1:18:07] and he's declared it the scripture
[1:18:10] declares it the prophets of all declare
[1:18:12] it the word of God to this day has come
[1:18:16] and declared that he is in US amen
[1:18:19] recognize he's in our presence do you
[1:18:22] believe that amen so you look at that
[1:18:24] and see that he has come and the
[1:18:28] Centurion recognized that he was
[1:18:31] standing in a presence
[1:18:33] that knew all
[1:18:35] was in control of all
[1:18:38] and he knew
[1:18:40] oh you're not going to find this on the
[1:18:42] page but I believe it in continuity of
[1:18:43] the word
[1:18:44] he knew that he had the faith
[1:18:47] to unlock that power
[1:18:53] amen wow
[1:18:54] you know what the difference is of that
[1:18:57] the difference between a confident
[1:18:58] Christian
[1:19:00] and one that's not sure where they stand
[1:19:03] day in and day out
[1:19:06] knowing
[1:19:07] that he's given us Authority amen not
[1:19:12] the power
[1:19:13] but you don't need the power if you've
[1:19:14] got the key to unlock
[1:19:16] my brother and sister the Centurion come
[1:19:19] with the right key
[1:19:21] now let me hurry along here I'm getting
[1:19:24] getting stretched out now I had several
[1:19:27] quotes and I don't know that I need to
[1:19:28] read them all so we'll hit some high
[1:19:30] points here amen God has promised to
[1:19:32] meet the need of the hour
[1:19:34] he always does that and we need the
[1:19:36] voice of God today to meet the need of
[1:19:38] the hour to meet the time that we're
[1:19:40] living in is that not true my brother
[1:19:42] and sister we need God's voice but now I
[1:19:45] I don't mean to say this controversial
[1:19:47] but my brother and sister the voice of
[1:19:49] God there is not anything else but our
[1:19:53] Lord Jesus Christ amen that's what the
[1:19:56] prophet of God is speaking amen he
[1:19:58] wasn't speaking the name of something of
[1:20:00] an entity he was speaking of our Lord
[1:20:03] Jesus Christ amen so it's there we need
[1:20:06] the voice of God today to meet the need
[1:20:08] of the hour to meet the time that we're
[1:20:10] living in and after he has promised it
[1:20:13] we can rest assured that he will keep
[1:20:15] his promise that's the confidence that
[1:20:17] the believer has in his maker that he
[1:20:21] promised to meet the need Can someone
[1:20:23] say thank you Lord amen and today one
[1:20:27] reason that the church is in the
[1:20:28] condition that it's in is because
[1:20:30] there's so many voices so many other
[1:20:34] voices to attract the church from the
[1:20:37] voice of god Till It's very doubtful
[1:20:39] that many would hear the voice of God
[1:20:42] though it spoke right in their midst oh
[1:20:45] God help us Grace Tabernacle help us
[1:20:48] Grace Tabernacle not to come there's so
[1:20:51] many voices that God would be here in
[1:20:54] our midst speaking and we couldn't hear
[1:20:56] him
[1:20:58] oh my the prophet of God said it's
[1:21:00] happening amen we don't want to come to
[1:21:03] that we need to stay right to that and
[1:21:06] stay tuned to The Voice
[1:21:09] amen
[1:21:11] they perhaps wouldn't even understand it
[1:21:13] because it would be a foreign thing to
[1:21:15] them they have got themselves so much
[1:21:17] centered on the voices of the day wow I
[1:21:22] tell you what that is to me very strong
[1:21:24] and if we notice in our scripture
[1:21:26] reading that the voice of God was
[1:21:27] foreign to them and it's become that way
[1:21:30] again today that the voice of God so
[1:21:33] many other voices and then if God
[1:21:34] promised he would give us that and if
[1:21:36] ever the voices are contrary to the
[1:21:39] voice of God then it must be the voice
[1:21:41] of our enemy
[1:21:42] oh I don't mean to take it there my
[1:21:45] brother and sister but I have in in
[1:21:48] position of Pastor Minister heard so
[1:21:51] many voices that had quotes to back up
[1:21:55] their voice
[1:21:56] I don't want quotes to back up my voice
[1:21:59] I want God's voice to back up my voice
[1:22:03] amen I want his word to declare and be
[1:22:07] able to stand and say I'm only saying
[1:22:10] what the master said amen so if it isn't
[1:22:14] if it's contrary to the voice of God it
[1:22:17] must be the voice of our envy and I'm
[1:22:19] not pointing this at no one please trust
[1:22:21] me on that to confuse us that we would
[1:22:24] not understand the voice of God when it
[1:22:26] spoke
[1:22:33] do we listen to the kind or priest
[1:22:36] or Jesus
[1:22:43] prophet of God says now who helped him
[1:22:45] when they were sick paid the doctor bill
[1:22:47] the kind whole priest
[1:22:49] who helped him and they were trouble
[1:22:50] over here kind old priest who helped him
[1:22:53] at this time who helped him that time
[1:22:55] the kind old priest but when it come to
[1:22:57] the word in their presence they listened
[1:23:00] to the kind old priest
[1:23:04] God help us amen God help us only hear
[1:23:07] that voice amen
[1:23:10] Hallelujah I want to hurry right along
[1:23:13] here amen Hebrews 10
[1:23:16] 22 23 says let us draw near with a true
[1:23:19] heart and full Assurance of Faith having
[1:23:22] our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:23:24] conscious and our bodies washed in pure
[1:23:26] water let us hold fast the profession of
[1:23:30] our faith without wavering
[1:23:33] my brother and sister I'll tell you what
[1:23:35] the Centurion he didn't come there
[1:23:38] saying if maybe you can or whatever he
[1:23:41] come there all you have to do is speak
[1:23:44] the word he didn't wait and if Jesus
[1:23:46] paused for a moment say well uh no he
[1:23:50] knew by Revelation all it took was a
[1:23:53] spoken word and the world would change
[1:23:56] for him and his servant
[1:23:59] and I don't think you could have shook
[1:24:00] him from that I think if Jesus had put
[1:24:03] him to the word test I believe he would
[1:24:05] have just stood right there and said
[1:24:07] nope you don't even need to come to my
[1:24:09] house nope you don't need to come to my
[1:24:10] house you want to come to my house
[1:24:12] that's fine come to my house you don't
[1:24:13] need to come to my house what I need is
[1:24:16] not to go to this place sorry to make
[1:24:18] this reference Mecca I don't need to go
[1:24:21] over here to this or over to that what I
[1:24:23] need to hear is a spoken word of God I
[1:24:25] need to hear the voice of God
[1:24:29] oh my because when you hear that voice
[1:24:34] prophet of God says once I heard that
[1:24:36] voice
[1:24:37] I recognize that voice
[1:24:42] he also said that when you come into the
[1:24:44] presence of that he never lost you might
[1:24:46] say that physical almost fear that was
[1:24:50] there
[1:24:51] but he realized
[1:24:53] it was the presence of God
[1:24:55] and the presence of God came
[1:24:58] to bless him
[1:25:00] it blessed him with Revelation it
[1:25:03] blessed him with you might say the
[1:25:05] guideline of the word of the hour
[1:25:07] restoration
[1:25:09] it also blessed him with correction
[1:25:13] thank you Lord for correcting me
[1:25:16] thank you Lord for a heart that could
[1:25:18] receive correction
[1:25:21] um
[1:25:23] now
[1:25:26] jumping to Romans 10 real quick
[1:25:30] verses 8 through 10 but let's say it
[1:25:32] that the word is neither
[1:25:35] even in thy mouth and in thy heart that
[1:25:38] is the word of faith which we preach now
[1:25:42] Paul's speaking to the Romans but my
[1:25:43] brother and sister the Centurion had
[1:25:45] this Revelation right here and he come
[1:25:49] amen and the word of faith was in his
[1:25:53] mouth and Jesus recognized that and was
[1:25:57] there and was astonished here this man
[1:25:59] has the Revelation that the word of
[1:26:02] faith is coming from his lips and if God
[1:26:05] would honor a centurion amen he'll honor
[1:26:08] you and I oh God help us that our
[1:26:10] language would be lifting up and let the
[1:26:12] word of faith
[1:26:14] come from our lips that we would speak
[1:26:16] this out amen and if Thou shalt confess
[1:26:19] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Shall
[1:26:21] Believe in thine heart that God hath
[1:26:22] raised him from the dead Thou shalt be
[1:26:25] saved for with the heart man believeth
[1:26:27] unto righteousness and with the mouth
[1:26:29] confession is made unto salvation hear
[1:26:33] this Roman Centurion would not have been
[1:26:35] able to take the word I don't believe
[1:26:36] and explain that to you and I but it
[1:26:39] came to him by Revelation and he spoke
[1:26:42] it forth and it brought forth healing of
[1:26:45] his servant and I believe his life was
[1:26:48] changed oh my oh my oh my amen now look
[1:26:53] look let's jump back to Matthew 8 and 13
[1:26:56] real quick here
[1:26:57] amen
[1:26:59] amen sister vika if you would come
[1:27:02] Matthew 8 and 13.
[1:27:04] let's look at this now
[1:27:07] and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy
[1:27:11] way
[1:27:12] and ask thou Hast believed
[1:27:16] so be it done unto thee
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:25] prophet of God preached blessings
[1:27:28] and cursings
[1:27:31] can they come from the same water
[1:27:35] can it come from the same mouth
[1:27:38] and I want to take it a little further
[1:27:40] can it come from the same heart
[1:27:44] let's not let Satan confuse us
[1:27:48] because that's what he's trying to do
[1:27:52] let him not confuse us
[1:27:54] you just speak the word Lord I'm here to
[1:27:58] receive it I believe it I will act upon
[1:28:02] it
[1:28:03] because that's the seed that's been
[1:28:06] planted in this good soil don't you love
[1:28:10] it amen I just love it because it lays
[1:28:13] out to me such a beautiful picture right
[1:28:16] here my brother and sister why the
[1:28:19] prophet of God express to you and I over
[1:28:23] and over and over
[1:28:25] to speak the word
[1:28:27] speak the word why because it's Christ
[1:28:31] in US and as he spoke and the Centurion
[1:28:36] servant received the blessing of it
[1:28:38] Christ in you and I I want to say this
[1:28:41] tonight not drama not profound but from
[1:28:45] my heart God bless you
[1:28:48] amen that's my heart God bless you that
[1:28:53] there's power my brother and sister in
[1:28:55] those words amen there's something that
[1:28:59] shakes the foundation of hell when Sons
[1:29:01] and Daughters of God start speaking
[1:29:04] blessing on Sons and Daughters of God
[1:29:06] and we don't do that as backslapping
[1:29:09] good old boys we do that as Sons and
[1:29:12] Daughters of God knowing my brother and
[1:29:14] sister that our profession of faith
[1:29:18] amen God Honors that hallelujah amen go
[1:29:23] thy way as thou Hast believed so be it
[1:29:26] done unto thee
[1:29:28] and his servant was healed in the self
[1:29:31] same hour
[1:29:32] oh my oh my I tell you my brother and
[1:29:36] sister I want more of Jesus Christ in
[1:29:38] this church I want more of Jesus Christ

[1:29:54] issue or is the issue going to speak to

[1:29:59] speak to the issue amen Lord take us
[1:30:03] above these little things take us above
