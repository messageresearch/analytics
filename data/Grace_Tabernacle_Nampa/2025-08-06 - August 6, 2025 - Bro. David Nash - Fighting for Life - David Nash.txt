I want you to please remember Sister Dorothy Giron. That was my mother's sister. I know many of you, I think, know her or have met her. And she is expected not to live past the weekend. So she is u she's not responsive now and and so we just ask you to pray for the family for the peace that she'll go just in peace and she I know she's ready. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She loves the Lord and I &gt;&gt; that's the main thing. Amen. Also, brother David like us to remember sister Debbie's wife needs a touch from the Lord tonight. Amen. And then also, brother David requested prayer. Just pray for him. He's had requests to come overseas and he just doesn't know exactly what to do or what to take. And these are trying times. We just wait on the Lord. Isn't it beautiful to wait on the Lord? &gt;&gt; He's always perfect. He's on time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To draw nigh to him. He said, "I'll draw nigh to you." Just wait on him. Ask him to reveal himself. Amen. That's what we're expecting tonight. We're expecting God to speak. Also, I would like to say that you know there's a praise report from a little brother here, brother Sammy. He said, "I love Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many would say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love Jesus, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, in the mouth of babes, the scripture said, "God has perfected praise." &gt;&gt; It's simplicity. God hides in simplicity. I want you to know I love Jesus. Just that statement moves my soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's not in vain. We smile at that. I believe that come from his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Sammy. Amen. Amen. Let's remember these. Let's bow our heads. Our heavenly father, our precious Lord, our redeemer, our salvation, who's now stepped forth and taken the book. And Lord, without you taking the book, we'd all be lost. You purchased the book, but now you've come to claim your rights in that book. We're thankful that it's an open book, and we can feed on it, Lord. We can eat it. We can take it, Lord, and grow in your stature. That's what we're growing, Lord. We're we're we're growing under the washing of the water by the word. Growing into the stature of Christ. Oh, God. What a blessed What a beautiful message. What a walk with God. What a way for us to to come here, Lord, to meet you. You know our need. We don't we can't hide anything. You know, we need more of you. And we're expecting you to inspire our brother David and speak through him have need of individually and personally and to walk out of here raised to a higher plane. Now Lord, you hear the request that has been made. I pray that you would be with our sister Dorothy's family, her children, as they make decisions as they are seeing and and and and our sister Sue. Lord, also Dorothy's sister, Lord, I pray we pray for them. We pray for comfort. We pray for strength. We pray for understanding. Let them bond together, Lord, and make decisions that would please and honor you for her, Lord, and for her body and different things, Lord. We we say, "Well, can you expect her to go?" Yes, Lord, because she wants to go, her desires to go. And how can we go against her will, Lord? We just pray that you would take her. We know it'll be right on time, right on the moment. And we expect that. I pray for Sister Debbie now, our brother David's wife. We send your spirit of healing. You said we'd spend it, send it through a word. We now send it forth. In the name of Jesus Christ, may that power of the enemy has come to attack her, leave her body just now. We as your bride speak these things in your name, having the promise that what we say in your name and ask in your name, we believe we receive it now. Lord, we expect to hear her delivered. And Lord, may David go and find her much comforted and much well. We expect her to hear him say, hear her say, "I feel so much better." Lord, may you grant it. We just believe that now meet brother David's Lord request for prayer. We ask you to direct him. He knows that. He believes you are directing him. But Lord, this let him be and go where you have called him to go and fulfill the position you've called him to fulfill in the body. Grant, Lord, you have a time and a season, and you're never late. And you've made our way perfect. Now, Lord, we we commit these requests to you. Every unspoken request to you, and every every need, Lord, that even beneath the the hand or beneath the heart of these here, you know everything. Lord, we just expect you now to minister to us. Open our hearts to receive it. In thy name, bless your word. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. 642, Brother Ivan. Now, this is they come from the east and west. And I I don't want to necessarily sing the whole song, but we'll sing the first verse and the chorus and then the last verse, but you don't have the last verse on this on this cuz the last verse you have is the the gates of that holy place. Is that correct? I think that's the last verse. Yeah. Yeah. The but we the last verse I I'm sure you know it and I'll try to if you don't you'll learn it tonight. So let's sing the first. They come from the east and west. They come from the lands of farms to feast with the king to dine as his guests. How blessed these pilgrims are. Beholding his hallowed face, a glow with light divine. Blessed parters of his grace as gems in his crown to shine. Since Jesus has set me free, I'm as happy a heart can be. No longer I bear the burden of care. His yoke is so sweet to me. You're as prisoner. My soul was as black as night. Our darkness has taken flight. Now I shout the victory for Jesus has set me free. Now let's pause just a minute. The last verse is, "Oh Jesus is coming soon. Our trials will then be or what if our Lord this moment should come for those who are free from sin. Then would it bring you joy or sorrow and deep despair when our Lord in glory comes will meet him up in the air. How many's expecting that? &gt;&gt; That can be any moment. Isn't that wonderful to know that? to see the things happening, the signs to know we're right here. &gt;&gt; A bride maturing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ready to meet him. We're expecting to see our loved ones raised. Expecting to come together and meet him together. Amen. What a time. Is that your expectation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm glad we got a message to take us there. Amen. Amen. That's becoming alive in us, his temple. Amen. Oh, Jesus is coming soon. Our trials will then be. What if our Lord this moment should come for those who are free from sin? Then would it bring you joy or sorrow and deep despair? When our Lord in glory comes, we'll meet him up in the air. Those sent Jesus has set me free. I'm happy as heart can be. No longer I bear. Isn't that wonderful that you cast your care upon him? His yoke is so sweet to me. My soul was as black as night, but darkness had taken flight. Now I shout the victory for Jesus has said. I want to sing the last verse again. Oh Jesus is coming soon. Are you ready? Our trials will then be or what if our Lord this moment should come for those who are free from sin. Then would it bring you joy or sorrow and deep despair? When our Lord in glory comes, we'll meet him up in the air. Since Jesus has set me free. Hallelujah. I'm as happy as heart can be. Longer I bear in of care. Yoke is so sweet to me. This is black as night. But darkness had taken flight. Now I shout the Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For Jesus has set me free. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. One more before our brother comes. 6:14. Brother Ivan, are you a Christian soldier? Got the armor on? Put the armor on you for fight a battle. We've crossed over into our promised land and it's a fight. Every inch of it a fight. Amen. We didn't go over there to rest. We rest in the millennium. We go over to fight. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen. So, let's get our walking shoes on. When that prophet saw those saints marching, they were marching to this tune right here. Four four time. Amen. Amen. So onward Christian solders marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before Christ the royal master leads against the foe. We are victorious. Forward into battle. See his banners go. Onward Christian soldier marching as to war with the cross of Jesus. Going on before like a mighty army moves the church of God. Brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod. We are not divided. All one body we one in hope and doctrine. One in charity. Onward Christian soldier marching as do war with the cross of Jesus going on before crowns and thrones may perish. Kingdoms rise and wade. But the church of Jesus constant will remain.

Glory Lord and honor unto Christ the King. is through countless ages. Men and angels sing onward Christian solder marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before. as I have brother David come if he'll come now. Let's sing it again. Uh let's sing the last verse. Onward ye people join our happy throng. Blend with our voices in the triumph song. Glory and honor unto Christ the King. This through countless anges. Then an angel sing with Christian solders marching. You're going on before. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be here tonight? &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be here. But I have to confess, I was talking with brother David there before service and I enjoyed the song service and I love that song, Onward Christian Soldiers. I'm surprised how many places I've gone and I want to close with that song and they don't even know it. And yet I'm going, but that's the one that when the bride is walking off the earth, that's supposed to what I'm supposed to be singing. So, God bless you, brother. Thank you. I don't Whoa. But uh yeah, I have to confess I was sitting back there going thinking about two or three different uh messages here and right before he said it, I thought I was looking through some different things and I thought, you know, I need to we need to hear this one about fighting for life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he says, let's sing this song. It's a battle. So, praise the Lord. It's uh nice to be in one heart and one accord. So, let's just stand. Thank Yes. &gt;&gt; You're hiding. Okay. &gt;&gt; You can't hide your mic. &gt;&gt; Where's it got to be? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I think I know. &gt;&gt; Is that better? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Does that work? Sounds like it. Thank you. Sure. Go ahead and stand. Thank you, sister. That was I really enjoyed the song service tonight. &gt;&gt; As we uh approach this, I just want to thank the Lord for all the things that he does for us. There are so so much so abundant sometimes. I don't know where to start or end with uh to say say to thank him and to praise him enough for all the problems and things you know this seems to arrive in this world and do you ever get that you know we call it the deer in the headlights look or like what just happened here and uh yet time after time the Lord just brings us through it and so here we are again tonight and thank brother Paul for uh inviting us to speak again this evening. Let's turn to Hebrews the 5th chapter and You know, it seems like some messages that a guy preaches, especially when you're traveling country to country or village to village, you'll wind up uh preaching like on a theme and maybe not the same message time after time. But I remember one trip to Madagascar that we took, every single service was different. &gt;&gt; Every single service. And when I got home, I just thought, "Lord, what was that all about?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just didn't even uh I just was preaching what the Lord had us to preach. And uh it wasn't until a short time after that, we were riding in the car and uh put the token tape on. And as we were listening to that tape, it was like each message I didn't realize I had preached the token in its entirety over about 15 messages. And I thought, Lord, &gt;&gt; only God could do that. But he had for those particular people who were new as far as uh thinking about the fullness of the word, for them it would have been perfect because they got it in pieces. So it was broken down. And sometimes I think about people in this day and age and when we uh talk to people or when I talk to people, we're not in an age where you can just dump everything on them. When you think about Ashwitz or Trebinka or those different concentration camps, they were so starved that when the soldiers found them and tried to feed him, they actually killed him. And so they had to close the place back down and bring him back just a little bit at a time. So sometimes when I'm dealing with people, if you can just say, "Praise the Lord." They'll go, "What?" Because nobody said that. I said, you know, in Texas they they all say, "Y'all have a blessed day." Well, I said that to somebody here and their mouth dropped open. They said, "I never heard that in Idaho before." So, be aware of that. And when you meet people on the street, Bible says we're in a famine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For hearing the word of God. And there's people out there sometimes just drop in. Well, I'll be praying for you. Or sometimes I mentioned before in a grocery store, I'll say, "Lady, man, that hair, your hair is beautiful. The Bible calls it your glory." &gt;&gt; And I that just that I've seen women go, "Wow, really?" Because that's the gospel being preached. That's the life. And it just it just comes out of me. I can't even help it. Sometimes I'm like, "Why did I say that?" And then I walk away and then you hear like well it's in every Christian that you don't want anybody to go down. So let me read this and then I'll one other thing that's five and we'll start at verse six in Hebrews. as he saith also in another place, thou art a priest forever after the order of Melzdc, who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears unto him, that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared. Though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things he which he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him, called of God and high priest after the order of Melzdc. Lord Jesus, um here Lord, as it we would say in yourstead, take this man, take this heart. May everything Lord of the day, of the weeks, whatever, Father, may everything be clean in every heart here tonight as we ask you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Please be seated. I this morning we were the these crazy cell phone things that we seem to own. They put some new app or &gt;&gt; update on there. Well, now I get these things I never did before. News flash. News flash. News flash. Well, must be important, right? Right. Well, so this morning, I didn't realize it and I'd spent two hours just reading like, you know, used to be the big newspaper. And I thought it was so strange because even science has now began to say, and they had a map drawn of actually how much of the West Coast they think is going to drop off. And it looked, you know, depending on how you measure, 15,800 square miles roughly. And they've all the science has already drawn the map. &gt;&gt; And you're going, "Huh, isn't that amazing that a prophet told us that in 1962, 63, what whatever year it was when he &gt;&gt; first mentioned that?" 65. I mean, he mentioned it more than once. And so you're going, "Okay." And then I got to thinking back about as with that last earthquake there and just some other scientific facts that kind of amaze me that are gospel related how that that you know they just had the 8.8 8 earthquake in Kamchitka, I believe is how you say it, Russia there or off the coast. And uh I got to thinking back again, the last three big ones they had, one was Japan, one was Chile, and I think one was Alaska, they said actually changed the Earth's axis three degrees. &gt;&gt; And they wonder why there's weather change. &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me? Exactly right. &gt;&gt; The atmosphere didn't move anywhere. The Earth did. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; And so, of course, there's going to be weather change because when you talk 3 degrees on a planet this size, you're talking about a thousand mile movement underneath that air. And so, I'm going, okay, what about this one? How far did it? And we go back again to a message of the hour. He said, for the millennium, that access has to go straight &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; up. Amen. &gt;&gt; H Well, did we move another point or two? He never said it was going to happen all at once, just that it had to become straight. &gt;&gt; And I thought then again, as I was reading, because they're talking about, you know, these eruptions and they're worried that Yellowstone's going to blow up. And uh I just kind of off the main subject here. I asked our Jewish guide one time, what would happen if the United States ever turned its back on Israel? And he said, "Oh, we thought already thought of this years ago. We'll just bomb Yellowstone and you'll be covered in ash." I thought, "Oh, okay." But uh with all these other eruptions and this stuff going on, I got to thinking it goes back to, you know, it says in the Bible, as it was in the days of Noah, &gt;&gt; so will it be in the days of the coming of the son of man. We are in the days of the coming of the son of man. In fact, you are part of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Son of man is not just a man speaking about the son of man. You know, it's a son of man speaking about the the son of man, but it's also those that receive that word. We are part of that ministry. We are part of the son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; Absolutely right. &gt;&gt; They call it the bride of Jesus Christ. We are. And and again, the brother said, I believe it was last or Yeah. about that. It's we're the final voice of the final age. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's part of the son of man ministry. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he said, "As it was in the days of Noah, so would it be in this day that we're living in." &gt;&gt; And we know that it's winding down. We're coming to what we would, I suppose, say the end of the end. But when you think about it and you think about the days of Noah. And so many people I've I've heard them say, "Well, they don't even believe there was a flood." And I took a pilot one time. We were going called on a fire. We were in Arizona and we were talking about it and he said, "Well, I I believe there was a flood and we were kind of talking and I said, "Prove to me there's not." And I I said, "When we start flying from here in Arizona all the way to Washington, the the way that the flood zone or where the it's all the same. It's all the same line all the way. It's absolutely under what we think of as weather conditions impossible unless there was a flood all at the same time. And as we flew and flew because it's about a 4-hour flight in a little airplane, he's going, "You're right. It's the same &gt;&gt; everywhere." &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. And so just to kind of finish this off before we get into the actual message, it says that in the days of Noah, it says the fountains of the deep were opened up. And a lot of people, you know, even brother Brandham said, well, there's there was no rain up there, so they didn't understand it. But what happened was the earth is like we are. We're a three-part person. We have a soul and a spirit in a body. And the spirit is what makes it move. Well, the earth has a core &gt;&gt; and then it had, you know, and then it had as it were the water because the do there was no rain. The earth was watered by the dew of the field because the whole earth's crust sat on a a water core or would have been and what's water represent the spirit. The earth is made the same way that we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened? Whatever they did, God never destroyed them. They did something that broke that crust and the waters of the deep came went up and came down. And what's happening right here on earth as it was in the days of Noah. They're talking about this crack can open up and that crack can crack can open up and that volcano and this volcano. It's cr that crust is beginning to crumble. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they you and I we've always heard it, you know, said it it'll not be water again cuz God promised that. He said it'll be fire next time. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's what's in the core. &gt;&gt; And it represents what? Well, water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and then receiving the Holy Ghost. And this holy this world has to receive its fiery baptism just like we have to receive the fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the Holy Ghost. I thought, &gt;&gt; wow. All this on a little handheld device. &gt;&gt; But you see that scripture over and over and over is coming forth. And if we're attentive to it, you don't have to fear. &gt;&gt; No. because &gt;&gt; we're part of him. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And he gave us promises. You shall not all die. You shall be changed. You know, and you will, you are transformed from this. And you can go on and on. And I love some of the things Brother David said before and brother Paul about, you know, this is Christ in us is the hope of glory. And so, as I approached this subject tonight, I I just named it fighting for life. Because a lot of times we think of, you know, Jesus our our blessed redeemer and uh all the things that he did at at Calvary, but I think for me a lot of times I never really thought about how hard he had to fight for that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How many people here like pain? I know Paul just went with the teeth and I'm getting ready to do one. I don't like pain. It's just not something I was, you know, just not really born to like it, I guess. And and most people don't. But you think about what he went through on that road to Calvary, and not just Calvary, if you've read that book, uh, Prince of the House of David, and it talks about, uh, Jesus sitting on a rock and groaning of a headache. &gt;&gt; And, you know, they said that was an inspired work, an inspired book. And, and I've read it. It's it is it's an inspired book and you think about all the things he went through and so but what was he doing and what was he accomplishing and we just read there that said though he were son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered &gt;&gt; friends if you're suffering what are you going through &gt;&gt; in in Colossians I'll read that real quick just since it's just a few pages back as a reminder to people in the second chapter in the first verse. For I would that ye knew what a great conflict I have for you. Now he's sp speaking to Colasso and for them at Leodysia, Lady Osia, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh. &gt;&gt; So where's he telling you the conflict is? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're sitting right in the middle of it, friends. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't fall under the category of being in Leodysia, you sure fall under the category of I never saw the face of Paul. &gt;&gt; And so we are in a conflict and our conflict are it was paid for at Calvary with Jesus Christ because when he said it, it is finished. And you look at the life of Christ and even in the crucifixion, the things that happened to him, he had to fight for those things because it said here that he prayed, you know, that who in the days of his flesh, he offered up prayers and so with strong crying tears to them that was able to save him from death. He knows he is the son of God as we would say. He says it I think in one place in the scripture and but usually he calls himself the son of man. But he knows that God I and the father are one. All the things that he said about that and he knows that God is his father. And if he was of he was the scriptures and very familiar with the scriptures because he used them time after time. He would use the scriptures and he he would make bold statements that some people would just uh kind of throw up their arms and say, "I don't know." When he when he said, you know, except you drink my blood and eat my flesh, and they're going, "Oh, the guy's a cannibal." And all these things that he talked about and what was he doing? He was he was the son of prophecy. Son of man is is a prophet. And so as a prophet, he was prophesying of the battle that he was going through as God in a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because he was half man and half God. &gt;&gt; That's why when when he went to Calvary and when they lifted him up, he died as a man because it said that the spirit of God had left him. And as a man he had to of he was suffering and that suffering what was he depending on? He was depending on the word of God that he had prophesied. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tear this temple down. In three days I'll raise it up. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; Where do Well, there's nowhere that I've found in the Old Testament where it says that exactly like that. But what was he doing? He was prophesying of what the scripture said about him before it came to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before it comes to pass, we as church of the living God, bride of Christ, find ourselves doing the same thing. We are to speak our own salvation in a way. He He is the author of eternal, we just read it there, eternal salvation to them that obey him. Well, obedience is not always, you know, we've been working on Isaac's porch there, and he's told the little ones, you know, don't bother Grandpa David because, you know, he doesn't want paint all over their clothes. And they're not always, you know, obedience isn't okay. It's no, it's when they actually, okay, scamper now because I don't want you cover. and but it's actually doing the will of the father. But there's a place where they ask Jesus about the will of God or the will of the father and he said it's believing on him whom God has sent believing on him and when we believe on him then we start have to go back and look again at scriptures and he said ask what you will and you can have it. He didn't say ask, you know, in one place he does say ask anything according to my word and you can have it. &gt;&gt; But the asking is on us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to make it out of this place by the skin of our teeth. You know, I've seen people and they'll, you know, they're at the altar and they're like beating the ground and stuff and I'm going, "Dude, it's already paid for. Just receive it." &gt;&gt; That's right. There was a a girl and I mean we were in a it was in Romania a few years ago and she was just all tore up godly looking sister and and just somehow somebody had put it in her head that she didn't have the Holy Ghost. And I said sister I said if this if I if you were thirsty I said would you ask for this? And she goes yeah and I said well here. And I handed her the she said I said ask. And she said, "Can I have the water?" It was a fresh bottle. And she and she goes, "Oh, wow." And I said, "So what would you what would you say now?" And she goes, "Thank you." Huh? &gt;&gt; How simple is this, friends? If you ask, then what's the next thing you do? &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's right. And when you start thanking him, he gets happy because in Jonah, it says that the thanksgiving was a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Jonah's sacrifice to God was in thanksgiving. And when he started thank, he was still in terrible condition. Weeds around his head in the dark. Probably smelled really good right there in whale vomit. And it's just being honest. But when he started thanking God, even in that condition, even the whale couldn't even deal with it. Get out of here. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. I'm not making it up. You can go read it. But you see, and so with the voice of thanksgiving and in other places it says, "Give thanks to God in all things." And that's part of our battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's part of having the right attitude towards God. When we begin to realize and we can accept the fact I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; I might be that that one where Jesus says what you did to the least. That might be me but I know I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; Amen. And with that in mind, then I have a responsibility. Jesus ministered to people. I'm not talking about just being up here behind the pulpit. He ministered, as we would say, 24/7. It didn't matter where he was or when it was or what he was. He was always pouring his life out for someone else. And in so doing, what was he doing? He was fighting to see the life of God come forth on earth again. We spoke not too long back a couple times on uh might have even done it here on where have you laid him and talking about Lazarus and how Lazarus means the you know the mighty one the the the mighty God of Israel and has these other things attached to his name. And so what was Jesus doing when he called Lazarus forth? Was it just the man? Well, the man was there. It was his friend. Isn't it interesting? He was friends with the mighty power of God. &gt;&gt; But when he calls him forth, what was he doing? Well, you say, "Well, there was a resurrection." Of course, there was a resurrection. But what was it? He was fighting to see the mighty God of Israel brought forth again upon that planet and to the on this planet and to those people. He was fighting to see the life of God manifest to those people and to those that were ordained to see it. It was a tremendous miracle. But it was right after that the scribes and Pharisees said, "We got to get rid of this guy." &gt;&gt; Because they didn't have that ability to receive. That's right. &gt;&gt; They were filling their part of the scripture that says your eyes have eyes to see, you don't see. &gt;&gt; Ears to hear, you don't hear. They were fulfilling their part because they had to fulfill the part that when he gets ready ready to go to Calvary. And here it is. It says that he prayed to be delivered from death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And yet when he gets to the end of that prayer, he says, "Father, thy will be done." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Thy will be done. But you go back to John, I think it's the 17th chapter. Let's read that really quick cuz it's got such power to it. Praise the Lord. In 17 and verse 24, well, I'll start at 23. In I in them, thou in me, that they may be perfect in one. &gt;&gt; A lot of people say, "Well, I'm not perfect." Well, sorry. &gt;&gt; Sorry that you're not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because God just said I am. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's this whole purp. But his whole purpose is so that we can receive perfection, which is completion. And and he said, "And that the world may know." So it's a two-part thing that you sent me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So the world is going to know that God sent him by our receiving perfection. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that what it says? &gt;&gt; That they may be made perfect in one which is oneship with him or with Christ. And the world may know that thou has sent me and hast loved them. They will understand as we come into perfection that God was sent into the world because he loved us. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; And thou loved me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son. You've heard that is even at the football games that whosoever believeth him should have eternal life. And so here it is that as we receive the word of God, as we fight our fights and our battles, as he fought his fights and his battles, because he's getting ready to go through the biggest battle of his life just right after this &gt;&gt; because the next chapter, if you if you read to the end of this chapter, which is only a few more verses, it says betrayal in the garden. &gt;&gt; Right? So this is right before the crucifixion. &gt;&gt; And he's saying when they receive their perfection, the world is going to know that you sent the knew. God sent me &gt;&gt; because you loved them. &gt;&gt; He was sent because he loved you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was his love that constrained him to go through those next couple of chapters as we would think of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was because God loved me, he says, or him as we would think of it. Well, of course, God loved him. It was his son. But let's read the next verse. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Father, I will I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am. And there's those two dots time frame. He said, "I will that they that's us be with him that where he is thou but be with where I am that we'll be with him." That is the will of God. That was love divine sent from God because we had no way back. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is about to give his life for our lives. And he said, "I will." And there's a whole list of in that word will &gt;&gt; of definitions that it's the extreme desire, passion, love. I mean there's all these things are combined into that word. And when he said I will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a man speaking &gt;&gt; half man and half God. Because this part is the man speaking to as he says the father &gt;&gt; and he's saying I will. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He is willing. It's his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. Perhaps you remember, I think it's in Galatians 3 where it talks about the a covenant and he said, "Though it be a man's covenant." He said, "Who?" You can't disallow it because God gave mankind the same ability that he had. &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's big words. But we have received through speech, we would call it the third pole, the ability to create. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we might as he did. All right, I better get going. So what was he fighting about? He told him three days, you know, lay this body down. Three days, I'll raise it up. Well, then you think that was going through his mind when when they're hitting him with a whip and and he goes before Pilate and Pilot said, "I have the power to let you go." And he says, "You got no power at all." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he had he had the power of God in him. And we sing that song, you know, he could have called 10,000 angels. Well, not really &gt;&gt; because he was constrained by will because it was his will &gt;&gt; that we &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; be redeemed &gt;&gt; that we could show his life and his coming &gt;&gt; by our perfection. And how do we gain perfection is by the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I will. And the reason was he wants us to be with him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I run into people, do you think I can make the rapture or you know, they're all shook up about it. Friends, why did he do this? And he said, because I love &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God loved me. I love you, &gt;&gt; and I'm coming after you. So that where I am, talk about a &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; A bride situation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's I want her that church of the living God. I want her with me. &gt;&gt; Wherever I am, I want her there. &gt;&gt; My help me, my everything. And so he goes through these things. And just a couple of the things he he had to fight for. He knows they're killing him. He when they they put him on Calvary, they condemn him to death. All those things. and how he had to fight for when he was on Calvary. He had to fight for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell nor suffer my holy one to see corruption. He was in terrible shape. &gt;&gt; But he had to take a hold of that scripture because he knew he was dying. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he was taking hold of a promise before the promise was manifest. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; That's the one that we &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; obey. That's we obey as he did. He was also fighting for these first three are out of Psalms 16:10 49:15. Redeem thou shalt redeem me from the power of the grave. what he was fighting for that he was a man and he was going through those things beating and the crown of thorns and the you know the nails and all the things that he was going through and here he is standing there believing he'd even prophesied it three days I'm coming up and he so he prophesied it because he believed, "Thou wilt redeem me from the power of the grave." Yet, he's going into the grave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Think about that. &gt;&gt; So, what was he looking towards? Well, I will be delivered from the lowest hell. Psalms 86:13. He's not only going into the grave, he is going to go to hell and be delivered from hell. And what's the only thing he's hanging on to &gt;&gt; was these are the prophecies that concerned him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; This is he is the word and he is fulfilling his part of the raw the &gt;&gt; amen the word. It repeats in the book of Acts, I will not leave my soul in hell. And uh we could go on and on. In second Peter, it says, let me read that one. U Okay, I think I know what it is. Second Peter 1 and 19. We all we have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts. It's a word of prophecy. This thing we call salvation is a prophecy according to the will of God. &gt;&gt; And we have to fight for it when the enemy comes and he dumps things on us. And there's another one there in Peter 2 Peter 1:10 to drop back up. We say, "Oh, how can I get in? How do I know I'm going to make the rapture? Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure. If you do these things, you That's the wrong scripture because the one I'm thinking about, it says there was an entrance. Oh, it's the next one. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. How do you get there? How do what's our entrance point? It comes through a ministering to us. a ministry. Our entrance is through his ministered to us &gt;&gt; into the everlasting kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why are you preaching tonight, David? This is kind of different." Yeah, it's different. All right. And some people, we have expectations. And if it's certain a sermon or whatever, a brother doesn't preach a certain way, then we think, well, what what went wrong? You know, what happened here and why didn't I? And you know, we go through those things. But you have to remember if he's anointed of the Holy Ghost, the same power of creation is in the same word if I say praise the Lord as it in is if I said I'm going to preach the hide off your back. It all has the power of creation in it. And as Jesus Christ prophesied those things, I'll not leave my soul in hell in the different, you know, three days I'll raise up and all those things that he prophesied of. He was creating the atmosphere to become it. He took on death so that he could take on the atmosphere of being redeemed from the power of the grave. He went to hell and preached to the souls in prison so that he could prove that he was delivered from the lowest hell. He had to fight for these things. As he was dying, he had to believe he was coming up in three days cuz you'll not leave my soul in hell nor suffer my holy one to see corruption. He was fighting for life and he was creating as he would speak certain things and as he would do certain things, he's creating the atmosphere. Now, where are we supposed to meet our Lord? No takers. Bible says in the air. &gt;&gt; Did not we hear a message of the hour that said throw the television away, throw this away, the dirty books, all that kind of stuff &gt;&gt; because you will create an atmosphere &gt;&gt; to live in. &gt;&gt; Yep. Didn't he say pray without ceasing? Bible tells us that. Didn't he say testify? And all the things that he spoke concerning us because we have a ministry. We have a per perfect ministry to show people he did come. He not only came, he came because he loved me. We sing that song. I love him because he first loved me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we do these things, we begin to create the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The air. I I've challenged people. I even, you know, a few years years back, I remember Shayer, show me some air, man. Can you show me some? This is where you're going to meet him. Think about what the scripture said. What good is a planet? You know, we we've heard the quote a Holy Ghost Christian could has enough power in to go speak a world into existence and go live there. How you going to live there without an atmosphere? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And as we speak and as we relay back to him, we are speaking I would say I just have this written down a parallel life. This is an earthly life that we're living in an earthly kingdom. And as it was in the days of Noah, and this thing is about to blow up and crack apart, and what was underneath is going to come up and back down &gt;&gt; so that it bathes this world in fire &gt;&gt; and renovates it. &gt;&gt; Y exactly. We are creating the atmosphere in which God says I like sir &gt;&gt; we are creating the atmosphere of Jesus Christ living and speaking through his bride &gt;&gt; that's our battle friends getting ready to close I think about and I know you've probably most of all of you here have heard of it about sister Hattie Wright and how that I had a brother call recently and he was all concerned about it because uh when brother Brandham told her the story about the spoken word with the squirrels and the different things and the woman uh brother Kenny Caps I don't suppose too many of you know him but he knows the woman personally and knows where she lives he's been to her house and all that and uh he said it's a humble house. I mean, it's just just a little old house. And here was a prophet of God speaking to her. And all she said was, "That's exactly right." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when she said that, the Holy Spirit said, "Tell her whatever she asks for, she can have it." He didn't say you speak it, prophet. &gt;&gt; He said, "Tell her what she says." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And she when he tells her this, she goes, "What should I ask for?" And he said, "Well, your sister's sick. Prayed for her a lot of times. You could have a million dollars." But she spoke from her heart and we read that in Hebrews that he becomes the author of eternal salvation. And she turns and said, "I want the salvation of my boys." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he had just told her, "Whatever you ask for, it can fall in your lap." And they fell in her lap and surrendered their lives to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But who asked? &gt;&gt; She did. Amen. &gt;&gt; So as we think of other things from what we call the message of the hour, how that the representation there was the Holy Ghost speaking through a man and the woman always represents what? The church, &gt;&gt; right? In the Bible, most places where you find it talking about woman, if you dig, you'll find out it's speaking about a church, whether it's the bad church in in the book of Revelation some places or the good church, the the the church world, or it can be the bride of Jesus Christ. So, what happened when God said, "Tell her to say it." The anointing moved from a son of man revealing the son of man into a son of man revealing who she was &gt;&gt; because she spoke under the power of creation and received what she asked for. &gt;&gt; Fighting for life. Friends, we are fighting for life. We are fighting this battle to no matter how much the enemy or a enemy I don't even like to talk about him. He's not worth talking about. But no matter what trials or what struggles come, it doesn't matter. God said, "Let us make man in our image." And you look at it, it was male and female created he them. So what's the image of God? That's it. &gt;&gt; It's God &gt;&gt; and you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's God's image. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We are the fulfillment or the perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In mankind. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; The completion. &gt;&gt; That's right. How many people have you talked to and you know they said, "Wow, I was never complete until I got my wife." I've talked to brothers, they said, "I feel so complete." &gt;&gt; What about Christ? &gt;&gt; That's it. That's right. &gt;&gt; That is what we are becoming. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Is the perfection &gt;&gt; and the completion of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in bride form. &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right. &gt;&gt; And how do we do that? by creating an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like that. &gt;&gt; By creating an atmosphere in which he's comfortable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not comfortable with all the rock and roll and all the stuff and all the crazies and the nakedness and we could go, you know, into that that direction, but that he's not comfortable there. He goes there seeking the lost. He said, "Reach into the fire and yank them out." But that's not where he's comfortable. A man is comfortable when he's in his own house. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they And when the atmosphere is such that he can relax and go, "H, wow." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where are we supposed to meet him? Everybody's looking for a rapture. I I believe Jonathan, my son, called about a year ago and we were talking about it. He said, "Actually, that word we know it's not in the Bible, but the definition of it means extreme joy." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You mean if we could create an atmosphere of extreme joy, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; we might could just leave this place? kind of looks like it to me. So, what are we trying to do? This battle that we are fighting is for life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who's life? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I am the way, the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the life. &gt;&gt; I'm the light of men. And we could go on and on. You know, all those identifications. And as we become, she is him. &gt;&gt; That's him. Always get your ABCs. Always believe Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we take whatever comes our way and we deal with it like he did through prophecy. I don't care what it looks like. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; It's not looking too good today. You know that this broke down or that happened or whatever it might be. It doesn't look good. But you know what? Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somehow some way this is going to make me a better person. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. &gt;&gt; Or the other thing you you know we were coming home uh we were going back to Louisiana there and I'd been in Central America I believe it was and you know it was a long flight coming out of Panama into I believe it was Denver and then Denver to shriveep and whatever. Well somewhere along the way there's a storm. I think we were stuck in Dallas. I believe it was. I just wanted to get home. I just said, "Come on, man. What do you mean there's going to be an hour delay?" And then it was a 2hour delay and then it was a three-hour delay and but I'm sitting there and all these people are grumbling and complaining about how terrible it is and they're going to miss their appointments. Finally, somebody said something. He says, you know, I don't I don't mean to uh break your bubble, but do you think that pilot wanted to make 125 people unhappy? &gt;&gt; He is doing that for our safety. &gt;&gt; And then as I was telling them, actually rebuking them because there's kind of a crowd of people. I said, "People, he did that because he cares about your lives." &gt;&gt; And they were like, "Whoa, never thought of that. You want to take you want to take off in a broken airplane? I don't. Just me. And but then while we were sitting there, this one girl came in and sat down next to me. You know how they are in the airports. And I said, "Hi, how are you doing?" And you know, we start talking. Wound up testifying to her for almost an hour. She was a backsliden Christian and the tears are coming down her cheeks and by the time they they're they're getting ready to call us to go on board and she's saying, "I needed this." She goes, "I am so glad." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you're here tonight. &gt;&gt; And she goes, "I know what this delay was all about." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, then I go over and so we start to get on the airplane. They said, "No, it's not ready." So then you had to go back out and this time a girl from Korea sat down a Christian girl and she started ask oh she said you know I don't remember how the conversation started I started telling her about Christ and and in her particular case I she asked a question I said well it's like King David I said he was God showing through David himself as king and she goes what I never heard anything like that &gt;&gt; where did I get that out of the book? Out of the message. And so for 30 minutes or better &gt;&gt; and she goes, "Wow, now I know why this had to happen." &gt;&gt; That's right. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; So whatever your trial or your struggle is, &gt;&gt; you know, by with the time it was done, the three of us were thanking God. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. We had a little sermon here in the in the airport. Y'all, anybody else want you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But because it's for our benefit &gt;&gt; or if it's not for our benefit, it's for the benefit of the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the same power of creation that came through Jesus Christ has been now laid upon us. And you can pray for somebody and they could receive eternal life &gt;&gt; because he's the author. We're the ones reading the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. and relating what's in the book back to the audience. Let's stand. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We'll have to try part two a different time. Praise the Lord. What a friend we have in Jesus. Do you know that? I'm sure you do, right? You don't know that one. Oh, let me think. What a friend we have in Jesus. All our sins and griefs to bear. What a privilege to carry. everything to God in prayer. Oh, what peace we often forfeit. Oh, what needless pain we bear. All because we do not carrying everything to God in prayer. Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged. Take it to the Lord in prayer. What is this about, Lord? Hallelujah. Can we find a friend so faithful? Who will all our sorrows share? Jesus knows our every weakness. Take it to the Lord in prayer. Are we weak and heavy ladened? Come with a load of care. Preious Savior still our reuge. Take it to the Lord in prayer. To thy friends despise, forsake thee. Take it to the Lord in prayer. In his arms he'll take and shield thee. Thou wil find a soulless there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you. Thank you for coming out tonight. As our brother said, wherever two or three are gathered, &gt;&gt; he's here. &gt;&gt; That's right. You &gt;&gt; say, "Well, I don't really feel anything." You don't have to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the creative power of God is here. And &gt;&gt; uh there's one other scripture uh I think it's in this that I've been looking at a lot. It says a divine sentence is in the lips of a king out of Proverbs. A divine sentence. When we think about a sentence, you know, usually think about somebody going to prison or paying a ticket. But you know, there's also the sentence that says, "You never did it in the first place." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you're free to leave the courtroom. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Free to leave the courtroom. Get out of there. Don't stick around because I did once and it cost me $200. So, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Create that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's where we live and that's where we meet him. And the rapture as we call it rapture is a revelation. And he said it's the same as divine healing. What about divine healing? You say, "Well, I'm sick." Get prayed for. &gt;&gt; Believers lay hands on the sick. And then what are you supposed to do? &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; And walk out of there thanking God, saying, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter. He said, "If you're still sick, doesn't matter. Because the creative power, if it took however many thousands, millions, whatever you want to believe as far as the creation to bring this earth forth, don't you think God takes a couple weeks, it's going to be a big deal? Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's sing that first verse once more. And brother Paul or brother David, whoever's coming up, what a friend we have. Thank you. God bless you, Jesus. All our sins and griefs to bear. To carry everything to God in prayer. Oh, what peace we often for. Oh, what needless pain we bear. All because we do not care everything to God in prayer. What did he say to do? He said to take it to him in prayer. He said C and said with thanksgiving. Is &gt;&gt; that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank him for what? His promise. You know, we create an atmosphere by the things we say, the things we do, and the things we think. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we ought to be, you know, we have that. We have that power to create. &gt;&gt; We ought to we can create it every day. No matter where you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep your thoughts. Keep your mind. Lord, he said, he said, I'm thinking of this, but the words I say and the the meditate. Oh, let it please you. The words I speak and the meditation of my heart, let it please you. &gt;&gt; Great an atmosphere. Amen. Amen. I I I'm not going to preach. Anyway, I'd like to sing this song. I believe God knew just what we needed tonight. Do you? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart. It's a life behind the name. Talk about an atmosphere. It's the life behind the name. Do you know that one? All right. It's a life behind the name that makes the demon. It's a fight for life. It's a life behind the name that makes the proud heart humble. It was God who devised the plan that in all things like a man he would live so he could give to us the life behind the name. Well, it's the eternal life that makes the demons tremble. It's alive. What an atmosphere that makes a proud heart humble. It was God who devised the plan that in all like a man he would live so he could give us high the name. Amen. Is that it? Who's the greatest enemy you've got? That's it. &gt;&gt; You. You meet him every day. That's the enemy &gt;&gt; trying to talk. But who are you anyway? You are who you are in the soul. Amen. You're the word living. Amen. So why not create an atmosphere? Bring it forward. The just shall live by faith. Whose his? You have it. The just shall live by faith. Where does his faith take his an anchoring place? It takes it in the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So fight the good fight of faith. &gt;&gt; Not a bad fight. It's the good fight &gt;&gt; because you have the word to stand on. The word is eternal. God's word is eternal. It can't it had no beginning and no end and it cannot fail. So what does he ask us to do? Just simply believe what he said. Take it. Accept it. Act upon it. What kind of atmosphere would you create? Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer. Our heavenly father, we thank you for this time we've had to be able to receive your word. Lord, these times are precious. We know, Lord, that one day these doors could be closed right here. But does that take away you from us? No. He said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Oh God, let us continue in fellowship. Lord, continue on fellowshipping. You desired fellowship. You wanted fellowship. You long for fellowship. With whom? Yourself, your seed, your bride. Lord, we just commit this service thanking you for your precious word. We haven't been here in vain. We're taking what we've heard and acting Lord upon it because we believe it in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you. See you Sunday. Amen.
