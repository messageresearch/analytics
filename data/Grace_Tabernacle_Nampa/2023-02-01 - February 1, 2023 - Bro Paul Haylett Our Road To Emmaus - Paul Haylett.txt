God let's just go back to that if you would brother Gideon you know I don't think that we can we can put a measure to the God we serve we can't really honestly put a measure to the worship that God has already deposited in US I believe just as it is in living the Christian Life our worship is oftentimes measured by what we're willing to let go and give amen I would like to sing verse six and then I would like to go into the chorus then sings my soul and uh I just want to say you know sometimes you know I get to preach things that I hear the Saints say well praise God we were talking about that in the car but sometimes it works in reverse and God allows the minister to know that he is not moving just in our house but he's moving in the body of Believers amen How Great Is Our God oh sing

Lord we know that you have our interest father you have our hearts and our souls we are your purchase possession father we thank you for that tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah God bless you tonight Saints is it good to be in the house of the Lord amen going to this is kind of connected back to Israel and uh just uh I don't even know how to preach this tonight I'll be honest with you I I preached it to myself about 10 different ways and every one of my was like oh Paul that's just doesn't you you miss this you missed that so if you just bear with me tonight I'm going to tell you a story amen I think that's what I'll just have to do is just tell you a story amen the journey amen the journey our road through Emmaus my you realize if you look very critically or analytically at this there's a little period in there that we'll get to if the Lord Wills tonight that doesn't really look so good for some of those that were there with Jesus but it's not the middle of the journey that God's looking at he's looking at the Finish or the end of the journey and it just makes my heart so happy when I think about this and let's turn in our Bibles The Book of Luke God bless you thank you Brothers amen now see I'm so confused on this I gave brother Alex uh starting at verse six and then I come along and I'm like I should have just started at verse one but you know what the first five verses are although I want to draw out just a little bit there in verse 5 so that we have quite a lengthy reading so as we read Luke 24 I'm going to say 1 through 33 because we'll touch upon this verse 5 says why seek ye the living among the Dead now as I've been just studying forward for like this service and other things that we're studying I hear the prophet of God talking about how that the spirit of the Lord the Holy Ghost used to dwell in the denominations and we see through all the church ages how that they come into a spirit of organization now it isn't always my brother and sister that the people actually joined an organization but they caught the spirit of it and the prophet says that that then bound the spirit the spirit moved on they stayed in their tradition and so we see now as these angels are speaking to these sisters and is telling them why seek ye the living among the Dead now we'll go into verse six he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men now get this these sinful men he's talking about were religious but sinful Lord help us and be crucified on the third day rise again and they remembered his word so they had a little Revival right there at the tomb because he stirred up their pure Minds in remembrance in their life that's right and return from the Sepulcher and told all these things into the eleven and all the to all the rest and it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and other women that were with them which told these things in to the apostles but it was just a bunch of sisters and so we believe them not isn't it amazing sometimes where the testimony must come from some of you are pretty quiet on that but you look at this right here they told we met an angel this is what happened and here's the 11 caught up not caught up in a Clarity my brother and sister they're actually caught up in a mental chaos because to them they're like how could this happen why did this happen not catching the revelation of the words that have been told to them so what was missing there not the words revelation so we can have all of the words not have Revelation and be in a chaos in our mind amen so as it looks this then arose Peter and ran into the Sepulcher and stooping down he beheld the linen cloths laid by themselves and departed wandering in himself at which uh himself at that which was come to pass so even Peter caught in this this vortex caught in this like what how but Jesus been telling them he's been opening the word to them telling them this is what's going to happen and yet in that but we realize that God's got his hand it's all in control all in control and behold two of them that went Same Day to a village called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs now there is just a tad bit of difference you might say in one part they say that Emmaus is eight miles from Jerusalem in some places they say it's seven miles but regardless just a nice walk um not you know like they went out to the mailbox they were committed this is the point I want to make they were committed in this walk Isn't it nice to be committed in your walk and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reason Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye Believers are having with one another let's go back further Gideon what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as you walk greatest gift given to mankind and we're still sad we have the words we need the revelation that's right okay brother get in and one of them his name was Globe cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and Hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things oh don't tell me that our Lord Jesus Christ doesn't know how to frame a conversation he was like I want to hear your version what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and word before God and all the people now listen these people who are walking along very sad have revelation but not all the Revelation necessary so they are there declaring that he was a prophet Mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the Sepulcher and when they had found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive this is so good okay and certain of them which were with us went to the Sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them oh my goodness don't tell me people are like well if the Lord I'm telling you I'm going to make two statements right here I hope I'm not misunderstood if the Prophet come back like some say he must he would tear the hide off of us and they would then say this is not our Prophet because our Prophet is kind and loving if our lord Jesus come and Walked In the Flesh in our midst he would tear the hide off of us and the bride would say amen because she can't say any different because she is the word and the word is calling to the word and regardless my brother and sister of what crazy theologians are around today this book cannot counterdict itself and neither can the bride counterdict the one who wrote the word in her um makes me want to jump and Shout and he said unto them oh fools that must have stung slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ who have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh into the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but I will touch on this I'm getting too carried away here but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them amen and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and their eyes Hallelujah at the breaking of the bread their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said to one another Trevor about jumped out of my seat did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures and they rose up the same hour now it's night same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them we'll stop right there amen I hope you don't mind that I just tell you a story this evening Lord we ask for your blessings upon the word amen you may be seated Saints I just want to foreign on this I really struggled honestly I I really struggled on how to present this and the only way that I felt like I could really do justice to this was just come back and preach it speak it tell it amen as we see this we see the sisters they go their anointed to rise early go to the tomb and as they are there they meet these angels and my brother and sister the Angels had a message for them said right here to them as we already made a little emphasis he's not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee and you'll find a common theme my brother and sister that goes back all through the Bible and it is God's servants God's Messengers telling the people go back to the message you don't create a new message we don't create a new dialogue but always we're being pointed back to the word and so it's there that these angels being faithful men they are there and they are pointing them back to the word uh he's spoken to you when you was yet in Galilee and it stirred something in USA to remind us that uh yes we have heard the message and truly the scripture is such that we need our Pure Minds stirred up every once in a while just reminders people say don't you get tired of hearing that over and over again but my brother and sister it's not being tired of hearing it God is stirring it up I learned many years ago you know you might be at somebody's house and and you know they've got clam chowder and you know it's been simmering on the stove you know the first thing you do if you are a clam chowder connoisseur is you Stir It Up because the good stuff's in the bottom amen and God is constantly taking the word and stirring us up because it brings all of the word not just what might be on the surface but all of the word and brings it such that we can be partakers of all of the word and so as the Angels speaking to these sisters they go back and you know kind of make a little bit light but I don't really mean to you know they didn't believe them because it was so extraordinary but yet these were people that had seen the power of Jesus Christ The Gospel manifested before them they had saw it and yet they were still stunned they were still you know constantly being their senses being overwhelmed by what they saw and the Miracles that took place and you know my brother and sister reminds me of a Time the prophet I believe was in Georgia preaching and you know he was there and he calls out a sister calls her name calls her address and there was a person who knew that sister in the congregation and when brother Branham calls out and says now your sister so and so and you live at such and such at this city and the person that knew them said well he missed it there but little did they know until later that she had just moved and the Holy Spirit didn't have to go on the computer as it would be and look up you know Mary Jones and see where she lived God knew where she lived God knew what was necessary God knew to call her out it was God himself speaking through the prophet doing the Pauling doing the the beckoning as it were and revealing as it were secrets of the heart knowledge that would only be contained the critic won't know it amen the unbeliever won't know it but the believer knows it's God speaking for them and so it's here that we see now that Mary and the sisters are there and and they are there to tell this incredible story and yet it's so incredible they can't believe it but my brother and sister it's the third day if they had just remembered what they had been taught what Jesus had said but you know sometimes we can go on sensory overload it's just too overwhelming sister Jerry and I once again going through pictures and going through things and sharing things of being in Israel and and we're only now here all this time removed now looking at pictures starting to absorb some of the things that have been captured and we look at that and say wow this is so tremendous now imagine that you are there you've walked with Jesus you've seen the supernatural you've seen all these things take place you've seen him being judged you've seen the crucifixion and now someone says I have been to the tomb and it's empty and they would be going I saw him die because in spite of the words that had been spoken of a resurrection we're in a carnal world with a carnal mind with a carnal emotion and we can believe often times my brother and sister as brother Chris brought out we see things they're just a flicker but we can and we have a recall of that and we can say I saw and they have a hard time believing that the tomb is empty because the rock was large and they knew what it was and they didn't believe but I'm telling my brother and sister I'm glad tonight God does not judge us for our momentary unbeliefs he doesn't judge us for the lapse you might say of judgment but he comes and he forgives us for that and makes a way through that and as they go and they look at this Sepulcher they look in and the linen claws are laid there and even Peter wondered to himself what has come to pass what what happened now my brother and sister this is a man that our lord Jesus gave the keys to the kingdom the Kingdom's not looking too secure at the moment try because the man who has the keys doesn't have a clue what has happened now in the flesh would you trust the man that says I have the keys to everything and I don't know what's going on no in our flesh we would say oh okay but you see God knew and God had a plan and if we could see what God could see we could see our Footprints going right to the throne my brother and sister but God even as Believers with the veil taken down that we can see through the veil past the veil God still has not allowed us to see certain things because we are called to walk by faith amen if we walk by sight my brother and sister you know the devil would have took measure of the footprint and created his own that we would follow by sight but God says I want you to walk by faith and that faith is I already told you I already told you what will happen now I'm going to let you go through your ups and your Downs till you catch the revelation of what I've already told you mankind is still trying I don't blame them I study the message I sometimes just read over and over again I'm really proud of myself I I this is just a t TMI but I'm really proud of myself I just finally finished after about two months what will you do with this Jesus called Christ I finally finished it because I've read it over and over and over and over again because I know there's things in that message I'm not catching I want to know it I don't want a superficial View and move on just like I tell you how I feel about reading the Bible many people are like oh I've read the Bible every year for years my brother and sister I have made it through a few chapters this last year but I do believe God has laid on my heart the essence of what is in that chapter amen what the essence of what is there and I would rather have little and understand all of it than have a lot and understand little and so as we look at this we realize that even Peter the man who has the keys doesn't really know what has come to pass and then we got these two brothers over here that they decided you know what we're probably just going to go back where we came from we're going to go back you know uh there's this so much about this message that was there we had a messenger come we thought that he was going to be the Redemption of Israel and that fell apart we we know that he was a mighty man but you notice they didn't recognize him as Messiah they recognized him as Prophet they recognized him because they had heard the words that he prophesied and those words came to pass but they completely missed the words where he's laying the foundation I am your lamb I am your lamb they call they completely miss that Revelation but yet they said he was a Mighty Man a mighty prophet in word and indeed so they knew the words that he had spoken they saw the Deeds that he had performed and missed the revelation but God is faithful God is faithful he doesn't give us a a a a test and when we fail that test just say well I guess I was wrong when I wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life but God is faithful wooing us aren't you glad tonight can we lift a hand and say thank you Lord for wooing us amen I thank you Lord for your continual wooing of Paul amen hallelujah it's not just a one opportunity time and so as they are walking together now this my brother and sister is very much in the human element I I look at this and I I just can see this taking place so we got two brothers and they're just like you know what hey let's just go back it doesn't really say it's home so forgive me when I kind of use that phrase but let's just go back home now you have to understand that the road to Emmaus in our mind this is one of the interesting things about going to Israel and doing this research the road to Emmaus was more like a trail to Emmaus so you know we we get along and and you just think okay you know a road no here's the trail as it were I'm not contradicting scripture but I want to make the point to you the trail going back so they are walking along the trail and let's just face it there are certain things in life that bring little disappointments to us and they literally thought that they as they stood there and stood with Christ believed the words that he had spoken they thought that they were seeing a supernatural event take place and they were but it wasn't the event they had programmed in it wasn't the event they thought it was but the truth of it was he was the one that was going to redeem Israel he was the one that was going to perform that work but they missed the timepiece so as we walk along they walk along they were communing together and sometimes it's just lovely to have Fellowship I had some lovely Fellowship last night and as you as you walk along in life it's good you just have Fellowship that your heart is at peace and you you're just doing and they commune together and they reasoned and what they miss my brother and sister in their circumstances they had heard the word they had been in the presence of the word revealed but now they have kind of moved out from what the word revealed had give direction to and they've kind of Fallen back into more of a carnal position in their life I think somebody here could probably say amen I understand what that is fall back into that carnal position and so they're walking and they're talking uh no doubt I don't want to judge them or represent this incorrectly no I believe they were probably talking and reminding each other of Supernatural things that they had witnessed but there was also this element that was there that they were like well you know he had said this and I thought he would do this and that brings us to the ever present uh thought in this day and that is my brother and sister we need to confirm what someone says not what we thought they said right so I this is what I heard you say but what did you say and so they were there and they thought they heard Jesus say certain things and so they had acted and built you might say a experience around those things but they didn't realize that while the word is eternal that they were not at that time as it were in the flesh and so they're walking believing that Christ is going to be the the prophet that was going to come be the deliverer of Israel the only way you can really take that position is to recognize him as Messiah and they were looking at this great promise of what would take place and then it seemingly is done and they're walking along as it were you know remember that time we were there and remember the fishes and remember we were over here and remember that this took place and remember how that he discerned the hearts of this and remember the time that he told us if we'll go up into the village right there will be that cult that white Colton you just tell the owners it's for the master for the Lord and then no argument remember all these things that we saw it's a shame that has come to this here it's a shame I thought this is what was going to be and they're walking along conversing and I believe the ebb and the flow of the conversation was not all negative I believe that it was there because my brother and sister the reason I'm going to make this statement is I believe that God was there and God was pleased amen with what he was hearing so it wasn't all a bunch of negative conversation it takes us into the scripture when he says when we speak of him he draws an eye unto us and so you can be speaking negative and expect God to draw nigh unto you my brother and sister so there walking and speaking of the promise that they believed was to take place and they are baffled because they don't know why they have saws too much Supernatural Can someone say Amen so much Supernatural to deny it but yet sometimes feeling baffled about why things don't work out like they do and so it's there as they are walking along they don't even realize so consumed as it is in the conversation there's another person on the trail on the road with them oh my goodness my brother and sister he said I'll be with you even in you to the ends of the Earth he was walking all the time with them and in their conversation something brought it to a place that he said now is my time to appear to them they were conditioned my brother and sister maybe they'd had a moment in their own life and they start to recount that as we should amen not to be boastful but we should be recounting God delivered me of this all brothers and sisters God is a deliverer God has him God brother and sister God Is A Healer God is a provider I had a need and God's my provider and they start to confess this to one another in our lord Jesus just coming along the trail did he come from the side did he come from behind we don't know but what we do know is there come a point right there that they come into the presence of our Lord Jesus and he starts to walk with them now I don't know about you but maybe they enjoyed that extra company I know a lot of humans if you're having a conversation you don't really want a third spoke it would be like can't you see we're having a conversation oh I've done it to you guys so many times how don't feel bad but I walk up while you guys are laughing and you're talking and I walk up and it goes I don't think it's because it's me I think it's because it's just the third spoke of the conversation it's not me is it I hope not but he joins in and if you imagine you're walking down the trail and and you're there and you're talking in the you know step around a rock here and go and pretty soon you're back close again and then you're whatever and then here's another one he's walking he's right there in the presence and there's a there's a connection that is made and they commune together and they reasoned and Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him isn't this amazing my brother and sister that how literally in the flesh you could be walking with someone and not even recognize them now in my flesh I'm I'm maybe a little different I might have you know met you and six months later I can't remember your name but I can look across through a crowd and say I know that person but it's an element that God used is using on Israel right now God used it on these brothers so that they would not move into a position of awe we're on the road to Emmaus it's Jesus oh my that God wanted them through the Veil to hear the word didn't want the emphasis to be it's Jesus standing here oh my sorry I gotta go I got to tell everybody I seen Jesus he wanted them to hear the word and so he takes them back through all the prophets back through the ages he takes them back through the word what's he doing he's stirring up pure Minds in remembrance and they are getting excited because what he's telling them is the truth and I can assure you they have never heard anyone besides Jesus ever bring the word with such clarity which is one of the things that brings us into the day that we live and I do not say this judgmentally but my brother and sister you'll hear conversations maybe even be somewhat a participant of a conversation and people have it oh God's here Jesus is here give me a new car give me a new house bless me here bless me there bless me there but where is the word that ever comes out and says you know what God's correcting me amen the TV people or God collected me that corrected me I ask you for a hundred million he corrected me now I want 500 million and they call that correction that you see God wanted them to be focused on the words being spoken so this man walking with him on the trail they must have been thinking this this guy knows the word he knows the Scrolls he knows the prophets he he knows this and they were blinded my brother and sister to to the fact of who it was it was speaking and I'm going to speak this maybe I should have him shut the recording off but I'm going to tell you I pray God blinds you and I to any man and keeps us focused to the word amen let us not see the man let us see the word and not just see the word but hear it and take it deep in our soul because we're human and we say well I'm not really a respecter of persons until we meet somebody we respect and then because we respect them so much we take everything they say as though it is the gospel and it might be but it's God that does the speaking it's God that is the word amen not the man and so they wouldn't know him and and he asked them you know imagine I wished I could preach had the confidence to preach to you guys like this oh maybe I am what manner of communications are thee that you have one to another as you walk actually what it is is verse 17 smote me in the heart as I'm studying this because I I can be a pretty Melancholy guy sometimes you know they call that well they have medical terms for that I don't believe I have that medical condition but I recognize in my life that when I am on an up I can be pretty happy when I'm on the down and I'd be walking Jesus be like what's wrong with you the whole time my brother and sister I have the word I have the life I have the nature what do I have to be sad about I'll just be blunt with you it happens when we look at the flesh and so Paul is making a confession before Grace Tabernacle tonight that I must be according to the word I must be looking in the flesh more than God wants me to look in the flesh because if Jesus Christ had come with me as it were on yesterday he would have said why are you talking like you are talking Can someone say Amen with me but the thing that go on houses got it all in control amen he said oh that's all right compared to where they were 20 years ago I have changed them I've been changed I've been Reborn all my life has been rearranged but what we do we look right now and we want it to be a certain way and we want this turn out like this and we do this and then we go well well you know and it's called the pastor Monday kind of thing you know it's like well I just thought more people should have said amen when I said this and I read this quote and I they should all just jumped out of their seat and screamed amen and and the devil's like keep talking keep talking you're doing a great job you're doing a great job and the prophet said don't even how does that quote go don't speak don't even speak the devil's language oh my that hurts I mean I can walk around right after I've said I can fix this and I broke it worse and I could walk around and actually find myself as a Son of God talking the devils language and I Think Jesus was really in a sense kind of poking these Brothers because why are you why are you talking of all this and why are you sad and cleopas says you know well look I'm you being a stranger must not absolutely must not understand what's happening to the message churches in laodicea you don't know what happened over here and you don't know what happened over here and uh you know there was this man you know called Jesus and uh it was there and we understand you being a stranger wouldn't have a clue of what is going on but I you know uh these things that have took place in these last few days you know uh Jesus well you know he was a prophet Mighty indeed in word before God and the people and uh how the chief priests overpowered him the chief priests laid a trap the chief the church the religious people they did this and and you know it's just terrible because we were sure that Jesus was going to be the one who set everything right set us free they had the right word wrong time wrong revelation God help us amen not to go jumping off the cliff because we've decided my goodness my brother and sister forgive me to bring this up but you know uh we have we have people who believe it's already we're already in the millennium and I'm telling you you know you run into town to pick up some parts or go to the bank or whatever and and you're there and I don't understand my brother and sister what anoints people but in this day and age there would be young people that would be out on the street with the clothes that they should be wearing or what shouldn't even be wearing ever but uh you know summer time and you're like what is wrong here there's something there's an insanity taking place and and we can't fathom it almost causes the neurons in our brain to start popping because it's like this is insanity and they stand there and the Goosebumps and they shiver and it's like you know what when I was a little kid I was at least smart enough to know you wear clothes in the wintertime but take that into a spiritual Realm naked and don't even know it so what's going on in the inside my brother and sister is being manifested on the outside and the people that say oh no we're already in the Millennium I'm sorry they are deceived not simple because God in the Millennium if we would be in the Millennium and have to deal with this world right here then what would be the Cry of our soul to come in the presence of God a cry of Holiness and righteousness to live out before God why would that cry be there if all we got was more of the same and they're walking along there and Jesus starts to lay this word out to him and and they're they're saying this is why we're sad this is why it is and the chief priests and the rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but my brother and sister let me remind you this message right here had already told them exactly what was going to take place but their eyes were veiled for the season and think about you and I how that there's things that God still is dealing with us God is still bringing things to light in our life and and it's that continual Revelation amen inexhaustible supply of the revelation of Jesus Christ amen I believe we'll be with him for eternity and still won't know everything and there were certain women oh let me back up the third day plays into this how many times did he tell them the third day I'll rise again I'm telling you my brother and sister except for God did not want it that way in our mind today because we get to look back at that you would have almost thought every one of them at the rising of the sun would have been standing at the tomb said he said but you see the Revelation was still working its way down to the soul and it touched on the mind and they knew he was a Mighty Man they saw the words I heard the word saw the Deeds but hadn't reached the betting ground and so in that place right there they're still in a chaos of their thoughts and so then they declare that these women they made us astonished which were early at the Sepulcher and they found not his body they came and they told us hey we've seen this vision of angels that said he was alive and some of us went down there to the Sepulcher and we founded just like it said there's the grave close the stone is rolled away and that brings Jesus right to this little Apex you fools my I wouldn't really want to be preached to that way you know to sit there and be called the fool fact the scripture says call no man fool but God's dealing with them in a certain fashion and he tells them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken ought not Christ have suffered these things and to enter into his glory now remember my brother and sister they're still hearing the words of what they think is a very wise man speaking to them they have no clue they have no clue and so it breaks it all down beginning Moses the prophets expounds to them the scripture the things concerning himself and as they drew nigh to the into the village whether they went which was Emmaus and he made as though he would have gone further what he was doing my brother and sister is setting a stage for them and the words that they had heard him speak along the way and they went and registered deep enough that they would say I want to hear more word you realize how special we are saints that God has anointed us that we day after day week after week month after month year after year have something inside of us that is staying no don't depart from us we want to hear more word we need more word don't leave don't leave say I need more word and that anointing that was there Jesus sets the stage as though he's going on and what it does is brings them into a moment of decision and their decision is I gotta hear more of this you got to stay with us don't leave us and I'm glad tonight I can say that our hearts cry is Lord don't take your word from us Lord don't let it ever leave us don't let it leave our thoughts don't let it leave our presence don't let it ever leave our souls Lord I need more word and I believe that will be the Cry of the Bride right on through eternity we will want to be in his presence we won't be frolicking people have the idea we're just going to go Frolic all over heaven like it's a giant picnic my brother and sister the desire God is placed in the heart of the Bride she's going to say I want to be close to my bridegroom I want to be close to that I Marvel sometimes now don't take this serious I'm using it for an example but I Marvel sometimes in my annoyance that sister Jerry still I want to be in your presence you understand where I'm coming from it's a love bridegroom bride the desire is there I need more I want more I want the presence now as we look at this my brother and sister a very great event is fixing to take place because as they come and they come to this point it's towards the evening time the day is done amen they have traveled from the East to the West Emmaus is Northwest of Jerusalem they have traveled from the East to the West and at the setting of the Sun there comes a voice a voice and a bride is crying out for not a voice to say I heard the voice everything's well I'm going to go on my way but a voice that she says don't depart from me Lord don't forsake me don't walk away from me you've got to stay my soul is hungry now they would be hungry in the flesh but much more they showed they were hungry in their spirit and their souls don't depart please keep telling us speak to us now I think my brother and sister that this is as I'm preaching this I hope this makes sense I am making sense but they look at this and they're declaring this abide with us and they offer it's toward evening and the day is far spent my brother and sister God has opened our eyes in this day right now to realize how close or how far into the evening time that we are amen and the day is for spent the years of our nation being a great nation we can look through the history and I'm happy to have been born here in this Valley I've been happy to have been raised in in the world that we live in my brother and sister but it's far spent amen all the life the energy all of that anointing that God placed in this nation in the beginning is far spent and we're coming down as a Twilight season coming down to these things and recognizing my brother and sister I'll say this I don't know if this will make the young people feel better or worse but as a young kid sitting in church I never thought I'd get married I never thought I'd finish school and that when I got right but I never thought I'd get married because the Lord's coming now this didn't do me so well in the sense of being kind of teetering on the fence and whatever but you know it's like well I'll never get married I got married or we'll never have children the Lord's coming we had children well probably never see our children grow up our children grew up and all of these little factors that took place that kept moving forward now in the position I was at that stage of my life I say it was detrimental but God's in control amen but I look at that always pushing the ball I was kicking the ball out in front of me always kicking the ball out in front of me but my brother and sister what God was doing that whole time he was leading me and leading you down the road to Emmaus because our appointment was not in Jerusalem our appointment was not along the trail somewhere our appointment was at Emmaus amen it was there at that particular time and that particular place and I want you to understand they didn't go by Safeway or Costco and pick up a little bread the bread was waiting for them now bread was already present it just needed to be broken and it wasn't just to break the bread but the bread had to be eaten amen and God has saw that we have been traveling this road and we're coming to a stage to a place to a time to a circumstance and the word amen the bread of life is waiting for us and we can take that bread and when it is broken for us now catch this I don't want to I don't want to misspeak this I don't want to misspeak this and it came to pass he said it meet with him and he took bread and blessed it and break got the bread but it didn't open their eyes until he gave it to him all people I have Revelation I have Revelation no my brother and sister we have Revelation when God gives us Revelation and the prophet of God says you pray for Revelation and God will give you Revelation so we don't have to sit back and say I'm waiting to get the bread we got to enter in amen and the bread is there we've got to reach out and take that bread and we have to take it and start feeding amen start feeding on the body word amen we've got to start feeding on that amen and when we feed on that our eyes amen their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished but did he leave them no he made the promise I'll never leave you and never forsake you so while they couldn't see him with their eyes and they're sitting now in that little house in Emmaus and they're sitting there their eyes have been opened Revelation has come to them they realize he's risen that's right what did the Angels say in the beginning oh if we could just cut this down to the Bare Bones and just have been able to take a halt of that and say the angels from the Lord said he is risen and we believe it but God had to lead him down a road and they had to come back as a witness to other brothers and sisters that have been buffeted by laodicea been buffeted by laodicea and they're not sure today whether he's risen or not and they certainly don't feel he's been risen in them but I tell you there's got to be a witness amen I wish I'd brought my phone out share that little quote today it struck me so powerful amen we don't want to leave our loved ones amen we are not going to leave them and walk away from that my brother and sister we're gonna dig in because of revelation God gave us on the road to Emmaus what happened after they were there in Emmaus they sat down they ate the bread what did they do it's late amen they're turning in they're sitting down because they're tired they're hungry they're doing this but Revelation put them back on the road to go back to their brothers and sisters and say he's risen oh brothers and sisters he's risen amen the sisters were right saw it for myself he's risen oh Hallelujah I'm telling you I'm glad we didn't stop any mayus and decide to make a Doctrine praise the Lord we're the last ones we're the ones that got the revelation he broke the bread to us not you what nonsense in the world we live in today what nonsense have brothers ask you crazy questions like when was your church founded I really don't know I mean it was its name was here and it got changed and then we changed it back I don't know where to put the little pin at well praise God our church has been following the message for 60 years well that used to just blow me away I would just be like oh wow what do I say now I want to ask him you've been following the message how long right how long have you had the message in you that's the only thing that matters amen we can acknowledge God's Center Prophet from the day that the prophet came on this scene could have somebody there to acknowledge that it don't matter if it's not in US now I'm going to take this as a little step out if you don't mind amen they didn't have any real revelation of whose presence they were in the influence it was having the anointing and where it came from until figurative just let me take this until they took that bite of the word and when they started eating the book oh my they must go on the way back to Emmaus thought oh mercy he told us here he told us there he explained to us what was going to happen here here and here and we didn't get it but give me another bite of the book life changing when we have the bread now I'm going to just call this good I have no idea well praise God we're not too far over amen I'm just going to call it there I believe that you have understanding what has been laying on my heart amen I tell you my brother and sister I just love there's there's a couple things I just love about this how that our lord Jesus is walking along and they're talking about oh life is terrible what things can I ask you tonight what things Paul are you listening yes I am by God's grace what things possibly can enter our life to cause us to frown in the presence of the king now this is going to be one of those things Paul's going to have to live out I say that with a little humor come tomorrow come tonight I don't know when but I'll be faced with this very words but I'm telling you I know my own heart and I know my own desire now amen because God has given me a desire to serve him giving me a desire for his word given me a desire to live amen and dwell and my brother and sister be able to say Amen to the word of God and with that gift what is laodicea have to take that away from us only what we give him Lord help me help me be like the little kid with the marbles I want more you know do you ever play marbles you know and they had that I don't remember even what they called it or whatever but the time you know you could kind of claim them man the big kids would just jump on top the pile of marbles and you know I can't get no marbles but when you got desperate enough and you had that one that they called the Blue Steely my you fought scratched bit kicked because you wanted it so bad what has Satan got to keep the word from us with this kind of Desire for the word Amen brother Gideon will you put that quote you have right here on the screen put it up anointed ones at the end time do you guys know anybody thank you Lord I know some anointed ones amen it's the end time all we got to do is look around see is there any anointed ones and I I look out and I see anointed once amen I look at those I have a heart that's burning for the Lord I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river this brother Brian I'm speaking now I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared amen my to all those people that think we made him God my I guess it's easy to cherry pick I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfectly they are I'm only one that's near when he doesn't I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man and you'll find my brother and sister there's people around the message that don't have an actual revelation of that don't want to confuse anybody but my brother and sister it wasn't the man we know as William Branham it was almighty God come down and said I'm going to use these vocal cords I'm going to use these lungs I'm going to use this voice amen I'm going to use him and the prophet himself says God could have used anyone I just surrendered myself that he spoke through it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded Amen now look at this you know the Apostle Paul is speaking and he declares to us such a lovely scripture amen that the mystery can somebody tell me what the mystery is you're all correct but the real fulfillment of the mystery is Christ in you not just that he's present he's always got to have a vessel that he uses that's what he doesn't have to let me rephrase that he chooses he chooses to use a vessel so we look at this now what was it the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was a mystery that God unfold it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man oh my brother and sister maybe I'm taking a stretch of this but I'm telling you I would love oh I believe it has happened that the word has been broken and it has been offered to you and I amen and in that offering to you and I God give us Revelation to realize and recognize who Jesus Christ is amen we're not over here to glorify a prophet we're not over here to take all glory from a prophet we're here to find the center of the road and know that by God's grace he chose a man that his words and his presentation we could understand but it was God's speaking to us and at the breaking of the bread we saw him oh at the breaking of the bread he was revealed to you and I that we can stand to say and say I know not man but I know Christ amen to stand upon that revealed word and have confidence amen because I'm telling you I just struggle with men complex maybe for my childhood I struggle with men and it's that realm right there my brother and sister if we was to follow a man I would be so critical of that man because I could not be able to Bear him making mistakes and yet you think about this I preached to you service after service and I make mistakes why do you bear with me I want you to catch this why do you bear with me maybe I'm being too bold but I don't believe so you bear with me because you don't see me and I'm not talking about how spiritual I am you know that I am breaking the bread I didn't make the bread I didn't do anything the bread God just called me called ministers in this church to take the bread and break it down and give it and it never was my brother and sister about that it was about the revelation of receiving that broken word that body word of the son of man and we receive that oh Hallelujah and our life has changed amen we see Christ with Clarity and people are saying well we follow this and we do this and what about that and you're there saying sorry that doesn't mean anything to me we're not disrespecting that I believe you understand that but it's not the significance this broken to us amen is what brings Joy Amen to our souls Hallelujah brother Alex a manner whoever I don't know Alex in the back amen let's look at this my brother and sister amen the one that had been trusted to redeem Israel there's great movements taking place in Israel right now but where God starts to move the counterfeit always Rises up and there's a counterfeit movement now in Israel very public very open very vocal very well funded and people are saying we recognize now that Jesus is our Messiah but they're taking them to the trinity [Music] they're not breaking bread to them saints [Music] they're not breaking the word to them amen now look at the closing lines here that the prophet speaks he said if you haven't fed fully on every word to give your strength to give yourself strength to Fly Above All these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it brother Branham doesn't chastise them [Music] for whatever Spirits have been he just tells them you know what if you haven't been fully feeding and Grace [Music] I believe tonight we ought to stop and examine ourselves [Music] Lord help me to fully feed on the word help me let it be we're humans we we maybe have a magazine maybe you like to make floral arrangements or you like to do a little something or whatever you know we don't want to be so legalist to say you can't take a moment to understand how to make a beautiful bouquet but the core of our life should be focused on him now I want to just throw I kind of skipped over this earlier I want to just throw this to you the modern Church the one that the prophet said was going along to the spirit of rock and roll on the way to Emmaus hey guys so if you follow Sports I'm not criticizing you but they would have been on the road to Emmaus man I'll tell you what the Packers sure slaughtered the whatevers New England I'm so glad they got pounded on did you see that past that would have been their conversation on the road to Emmaus [Music] would it be a bad time to ask if we want to have a World Series party at the church [Music] basement [Music] for the Kentucky Derby [Music] see there's another voice that's also walking down the road to Emmaus but you don't find in scripture with that voice calls Christ draws him to them there's only one conversation there's only one expression [Music] Saints we're human but as we're walking down that road to Emmaus let's just make sure a conversation withdraw the Lord Jesus to us let our conversation let our things of life let the disappointments be shed and remember I am redeemed amen I am redeemed I'm walking down this rough Rocky Road to Emmaus one thing I can remember I'm redeemed I'm redeemed been washed by the blood amen I've been forgiven and I can go and tell about it it's worth a walk my
