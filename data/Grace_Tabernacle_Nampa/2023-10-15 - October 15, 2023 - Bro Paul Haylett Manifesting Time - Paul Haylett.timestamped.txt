[39:05] I forgot it already but what's it been
[39:08] seven years we've been
[39:10] here yeah roughly seven years we've been
[39:12] here do you remember brother Trevor that
[39:15] day when we walked in here with the
[39:17] realtor we were shocked back in time we
[39:22] were shocked back into the 70s or 60s or
[39:27] something and and uh while we haven't
[39:30] ultr modernized the church you know it's
[39:32] just been this continual effort
[39:35] continual Labor uh that the brothers ha
[39:38] have done and uh you know I had I won't
[39:41] mention who it was was a visitor they

[40:30] of drama and then you might say there's
[40:33] not enough but we don't have drama and
[40:36] for me that is just a real blessing that
[40:39] we as Christians just reading studying
[40:42] and and what it is is God's put a
[40:44] heart's desire in us to just simply want
[40:47] to do his will and live the word and
[40:50] that is really what defines a Christian
[40:54] just want to love him serve him him amen

[41:38] gain it's more like what they give up
[41:41] father it's not about an office with
[41:44] Prestige or position for father there is
[41:47] very little praise but father I ask for
[41:51] your blessings father upon these men

[42:30] now just to bless them bless their
[42:32] families bless this assembly in the name
[42:34] of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless
[42:38] you Brothers
[42:40] [Music]
[42:43] hallelujah amen let's just turn in our
[42:46] Bibles this morning I want to speak to
[42:48] you uh for a little while today it might
[42:51] seem that I'm speaking on current events
[42:53] but it's actually the end of the service
[42:55] is where my real focus is but there is
[42:58] sometimes a parallel or a context we
[43:02] need to measure now you know one time I
[43:05] was working with a young man doing
[43:07] construction work and he was just uh as
[43:09] they called them he was a newbie or a uh
[43:12] Beaver is what they call them sometimes
[43:15] because to get the boards right they cut
[43:17] up a lot of wood and uh so it was there
[43:20] that that um you know you you just
[43:23] sometimes people ask questions and
[43:26] you're a little dumbfounded you don't
[43:27] have an answer and this young man's
[43:30] question
[43:31] was who invented the tape
[43:34] measure and then I said well no doubt
[43:36] some he goes no no what I meant was
[43:38] where' an inch become an inch from and
[43:41] you stop and it's like well where did it
[43:43] come from you know a little hard to to
[43:46] do that but we in contrast have to as
[43:50] humans have something to measure against
[43:54] now when the word talks about holy
[43:56] Hess well what are we measuring that
[43:59] against righteousness what are we
[44:02] measuring that against or worldliness
[44:06] what are we measuring that against and
[44:09] so it is here that in the word of God
[44:12] God has given us clear instruction as it
[44:15] were the measurement for you and I to
[44:17] come and be able to say this is where I
[44:20] stand now in the mirror of God's word
[44:23] every one of us is given a position to
[44:26] stand in the mirror of the word and
[44:28] while you would say there's no image in
[44:31] that mirror unless I'm standing there
[44:34] but you know there's those people who
[44:35] are very contrary in their thinking and
[44:38] they will tell you that your image was
[44:40] already in the mirror and it's now
[44:42] looking out at you and that kind of
[44:44] logic is hard to argue against because
[44:46] you can't argue against people with that
[44:49] kind of logic and so it's there but my
[44:52] brother and sister the image of The
[44:55] Godly the image image of the Christian
[44:57] of the believer is already in the
[45:01] word the image of who you are in Jesus
[45:04] Christ is already in the word man did
[45:08] not put it in there amen God put that in
[45:11] there and so today I want to talk to you
[45:14] on the overall title of uniting time and
[45:18] uh as a subject it would be manifesting
[45:20] time and let's just turn for a quick
[45:23] look in our Bibles in Genesis the 16th
[45:26] chapter and uh verses 7- 12 and you'll
[45:31] say well brother Paul you are you're
[45:33] just looking into current events but you
[45:35] see my brother and sister these current
[45:37] events have been very current for a long
[45:40] time it's not just something that
[45:42] appeared a few days ago while it burst
[45:45] into the open as it were to the world uh
[45:49] view uh but my brother and sister it's
[45:52] an ongoing struggle that goes all the
[45:54] way back to the book of gen Genesis the
[45:56] 16th chapter verses
[46:00] 7-2 and this is a story of hegar and we
[46:04] find out my brother and sister well I'll
[46:06] expound on that in just a moment and the
[46:09] angel of the Lord found her by a
[46:11] fountain of water in the wilderness by
[46:13] the fountain in the way to Shure and he
[46:16] said Hagar sar's maid when comest thou
[46:21] and with wilt thou go and she said I
[46:23] flee from the face of my mistress
[46:26] Seri and the angel of the Lord said unto
[46:29] her return to thy mistress and submit
[46:33] thyself under her hands we have all been
[46:37] in a situation where we felt like we
[46:39] were unjustly treated and we desire to
[46:43] to get away to escape from that but God
[46:47] says to her I want you to go back to the
[46:51] very countenance now we can't justify
[46:54] saria's Behavior
[46:57] after all where she could not conceive a
[46:59] child it was
[47:03] her you might say presented idea just
[47:06] take my
[47:08] maid now obviously she become quite
[47:12] jealous we won't get into the whole
[47:14] dynamic of it but when this maid goes to
[47:17] her husband and is found with
[47:20] child it would be upsetting let's face
[47:24] that and she didn't really act
[47:29] like a proper
[47:33] Christian because the human element is
[47:36] always present with
[47:38] us and God says go back and submit
[47:44] yourself and the angel of the Lord said
[47:46] unto her I will multiply thy seed
[47:48] exceedingly that it shall not be
[47:50] numbered for multitude and the angel of
[47:53] the Lord said unto her behold thou art
[47:55] with child and shall bear a son and
[47:58] shall call his name Ishmael because the
[48:02] Lord hath heard thy Affliction and he
[48:05] will be a wild
[48:09] man and that's something people who
[48:11] never had children are like I wish they
[48:13] would correct their children and then
[48:16] they have children and their children
[48:18] are just as
[48:20] bad imagine though Angel of the lord
[48:24] your child's going to be wild
[48:26] man that must have been so
[48:31] encouraging his hand will be against
[48:33] every man and every man's hand against
[48:36] him and he shall dwell in the presence
[48:39] of all his Brethren Heavenly Father we
[48:41] just ask you to bless this time lord as
[48:44] we look father lord it's not about wars
[48:47] between uh these people father and what
[48:50] is happening father but it is of the
[48:52] fulfilling of your word and father I ask
[48:55] ask today Lord you would come touch each
[48:57] and every one of us let your word be
[48:59] fulfilled in our lives father that we
[49:02] can stand with confidence and look to
[49:05] the day of your coming Lord and not be
[49:07] afraid but with that confidence be able
[49:09] to stand in the day that we live in in
[49:12] the test of time and be able to rejoice
[49:15] as Sons and Daughters of God bless this
[49:17] service today I pray in the name of
[49:19] Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now
[49:25] I think it's safe to say that we can
[49:27] look through the track record of the
[49:29] word of God and find that every time
[49:31] that man tries to bring something to
[49:34] pass I don't know if you would agree
[49:36] with me or not but I know that every
[49:38] time I've tried to make things happen
[49:41] tried to facilitate things to be in a
[49:43] certain fashion they very rarely turn
[49:46] out like we as humans anticipate it and
[49:49] so here it is that in Siri's idea that
[49:54] um this maid is is going to bring forth
[49:56] a child and I'm going to take this child
[50:00] and I'm going to rear it as my own but
[50:03] you see there was no uh word in the
[50:06] promise concerning this uh promised Seed
[50:08] of Abraham that said that that child
[50:11] would come now my brother and sister
[50:13] it's a little uh Stark to put it this
[50:16] way but um uh you know Hagar being an
[50:19] Egyptian actually what happened was uh
[50:22] with Abraham uh coming and taking her
[50:26] and bringing forth a child he has now
[50:29] produced as you might say a hybrid it's
[50:32] not it's not of his bloodline not of his
[50:35] lineage not of his faith and so he's
[50:37] produced something that was outside of
[50:40] the spoken word of God and so it's there
[50:43] that whenever uh man's uh efforts to
[50:46] bring things to pass uh come God takes
[50:50] our misguided efforts and uh it's there
[50:53] that I can say just thinking without
[50:55] going into it today many times that I
[50:58] have have put the effort out to try to
[51:01] bring about a certain uh result and only
[51:04] toine that uh to be a misguided effort
[51:09] but yet God's will will be done amen
[51:12] amen in spite of our left turns right
[51:15] turns our stumbling whatever it is God's
[51:18] will will be done whatever he has
[51:21] promised to Sons and Daughters of God
[51:23] will come to pass whatever is promised
[51:25] to those who blaspheme his name will
[51:28] come to pass amen and so it is my
[51:31] brother and sister that we have to be
[51:34] careful that uh as Christians that
[51:37] someone doesn't try to uh marry us to
[51:40] some kind of a system to bring things to
[51:43] pass that that hey you want your church
[51:46] to grow I've often joked about that uh
[51:48] correspondence that we received you know
[51:50] for just these monthly payments we will
[51:53] give you this secret on how to make your
[51:55] your church grow well we as a body of
[51:58] Believers want this church to grow
[52:00] organically we want it to grow because
[52:02] the word of God has led someone to be a
[52:05] part of Assembly not because we have now
[52:08] created a program it's not because we're
[52:10] attracting them because we have
[52:12] presented Something Beautiful the beauty
[52:15] in worship goes back to Cain amen the
[52:18] real beauty of worship is when we living
[52:21] the word of God and our life reflecting
[52:24] that and God is pleased and there's
[52:26] where he pours out his Blessing not our
[52:29] effort amen so even in our misguided
[52:32] efforts God's will will be done and so
[52:35] it's promise that we have today that if
[52:38] we stay true to the word of God and
[52:40] stand upon on the promise of God God
[52:42] said I will bring it to pass and I say
[52:45] Amen to that amen so we see that God's
[52:49] words to Hagar uh show us that this was
[52:52] uh uh all fitting in the plan of God
[52:55] when when you look at what the angel of
[52:57] the Lord speaks to her he is not telling
[53:00] her because of this act that you
[53:02] participated in uh because of this being
[53:05] outside of my original promise that you
[53:08] know there's a curse upon you but he
[53:10] actually makes the Declaration to Hagar
[53:14] that uh this is going to fit perfectly
[53:17] in my plan that I'm going to make your
[53:20] son a great nation now my brother and
[53:23] sister without going into all the time
[53:24] and the history I debated on it but it's
[53:27] there we'll look at this and realize
[53:30] that he was blessed with many sons and
[53:32] daughters had princes they had their
[53:34] kingdoms they had great things he wasn't
[53:37] some popper cast to the backside of the
[53:40] desert because God's promise to Hagar
[53:43] the word spoken must come to pass amen
[53:47] now as we look at this we realize just
[53:49] touching back on the scripture we'll see
[53:52] my brother and sister that this promise
[53:54] that was spoken in that day is that he
[53:57] is going to be a wild man he is going to
[54:00] be H very indecisive and uh very
[54:04] unreliable going to be prone to fits and
[54:08] you know I I just the other day as I was
[54:11] studying sitting there in the Harvester
[54:14] and just thinking about this and it just
[54:16] come out and it's like ishmail your sons
[54:18] are misbehaving again but you see it was
[54:22] prophesied that they would and so this
[54:25] must be brought about and you know my
[54:27] brother and sister that sometimes God
[54:29] uses things that confound you and I to
[54:33] cause us to shift our position so we
[54:36] don't like what happened this happens
[54:38] and why did this happen what God is
[54:41] using is a very in many cases subtle
[54:44] Direction in our life to get us to just
[54:47] change just a little bit and that little
[54:50] bit of change will chart a course into
[54:52] your future and so it is is that God was
[54:56] doing this my brother and sister to
[54:58] bring about a time a season is to bring
[55:02] about without going off into a lot of
[55:04] other uh uh things we look at this and
[55:07] realize that Israel's own behavior set a
[55:11] stage for these things Israel's own
[55:14] Behavior Uh would cause that an on again
[55:17] off again relationship with God and
[55:20] unable to take the promise and simply
[55:22] stand on the promise until they saw it
[55:24] come to pass now if we sit here and you
[55:27] know I've heard people make comments
[55:29] like well I've been praying about this
[55:31] for so long it's celebrating birthdays
[55:34] well you know birthdays mean nothing to
[55:37] God we can say it's been years been
[55:39] praying for healing or praying for a
[55:41] lost loved one uh it's it's been years
[55:44] my brother and sister time means nothing
[55:47] to God and in reality if we are fully
[55:49] submitted to God time would mean nothing
[55:52] for us because he has given us the
[55:54] promise of the word amen and when he
[55:56] gives the promise it can take e on of
[55:59] time but it will come to pass and if you
[56:02] say I I don't know about that well then
[56:04] what can you trust that's right you know
[56:06] if we come to the place that the devil
[56:08] robs us from the very Simplicity of
[56:11] trust then we have no firm foundation to
[56:14] stand on Amen so as it is my brother and
[56:17] sister we'll look at this and he he's
[56:20] showing Hagar you know what I'm going to
[56:22] bless him and he's going to be a father
[56:25] of great nation and this is all going to
[56:28] come and and you see this as you look at
[56:31] this you recognize that that God is
[56:34] giving in essence a stamp that this fits
[56:37] into the plan now look my brother and
[56:39] sister um this uh Ishmael and the
[56:42] ishmaelites there is a time that they
[56:45] are in direct conflict it's not just
[56:49] about fighting over Palestine it's not
[56:51] fighting over the it goes all the way
[56:54] back my brother and sister you can find
[56:56] if you want to study it reference in
[56:58] scripture about how that uh uh uh Israel
[57:02] amen Judah killing the Israelites that's
[57:05] right amen so this has been an ongoing
[57:07] thing it wasn't just a little HOA
[57:10] disruption in the neighborhood uh it it
[57:12] has been taking place forever and so it
[57:16] is they are no friends to Isaac seed and
[57:19] Isaac seed has maybe looked with a
[57:22] little disdain upon them now when we
[57:25] went to Israel this last uh late fall
[57:28] about a year ago really it's getting
[57:29] close a amen my brother and sister you
[57:32] can you can
[57:35] sense a little bit of disdain many many
[57:37] Jews friendly we met very very many
[57:41] friendly but but we're sitting in a
[57:43] restaurant there on on the Dead Sea a
[57:46] and uh there was a family come in and I
[57:48] don't want to sound judgmental but I
[57:50] want to make a point there's family come
[57:51] in and sat right down by our table and
[57:54] uh and and it's there that they're doing
[57:56] and I can just remember the look as the
[57:59] man is seating his family and he just
[58:01] looked over and I think I know what a
[58:03] look of disdain is he just looked at me
[58:05] like
[58:06] H and I was like well praise God you
[58:11] know you you look at me like I I'm
[58:14] nothing but I'm going to look at you as
[58:17] being in the scripture and therefore I
[58:19] cannot look against you but I don't
[58:22] necessarily have to stand for you
[58:24] because not all that's Israel is
[58:26] Israel and so just because you're a Jew
[58:29] and you are standing with your little
[58:31] book and you're reading to your family
[58:34] and and you're doing all of this
[58:36] ceremonial thing my brother and sister
[58:39] you realize it is tradition that's right
[58:43] it is not from their heart they're going
[58:45] through the motion I don't want to go
[58:48] through the motion I want to serve God
[58:49] from my heart I want to just be totally
[58:52] sold out to him that people would would
[58:54] say there's a passion in that person
[58:57] there's a passion in that church there's
[58:59] a passion in them not not simply yeah
[59:03] they go through it because by roach my
[59:05] brother and sister we can repeat
[59:11] anything so look at
[59:14] this both of these had a promise to be
[59:16] great
[59:19] Nations so now you got two Nations
[59:22] rising
[59:23] up
[59:25] go study it it's good homework it's
[59:28] interesting reading go study it you see
[59:30] no wonder ishmail really felt like he
[59:33] had something that Isaac didn't because
[59:35] you see ishmail is growing up now as a
[59:38] Young Man already in the favor of his
[59:42] father before Isaac ever shows
[59:46] up great conflict the Palestinians
[59:49] saying we've been on this land forever
[59:51] but who did God declare the land belong
[59:53] to so it doesn't matter when they show
[59:56] up my brother and sister it's what God
[59:59] promised it to be and ishmail saying we
[1:00:01] were here first and he had a he had a
[1:00:04] strong argument there I was here first I
[1:00:07] was even raised up and had been
[1:00:10] circumcised before Isaac even come you
[1:00:13] might say in significance upon the scene
[1:00:16] and so there I was already committed
[1:00:18] already uh uh uh dedicated and it's all
[1:00:22] there to fulfilling the word of God but
[1:00:24] my brother and sister that promise had
[1:00:26] been given to Abraham a long time before
[1:00:30] it was man who brought that about and so
[1:00:34] both claiming to have the word amen
[1:00:37] that's right you know I did a little
[1:00:39] reading not that I'm overall interested
[1:00:41] in the whole thing but I did a little
[1:00:43] reading and my brother and sister you
[1:00:45] know they they both claim to have the
[1:00:48] word this is the word that come and God
[1:00:50] spoke these words over our father
[1:00:53] ishmail and it's there that that this is
[1:00:56] our promise and yet my brother and
[1:00:58] sister having those claim to the word
[1:01:02] does not mean you have the word that's
[1:01:04] right amen a lot of people claim that
[1:01:06] today amen but both have their own
[1:01:09] profits and their own
[1:01:11] message and their own
[1:01:13] vindications you know it's interesting
[1:01:15] as you study Islam my brother and sister
[1:01:18] they are not a religion without results
[1:01:23] right
[1:01:25] now you might be thinking I'm promoting
[1:01:27] that I'm not but the scripture says it'd
[1:01:30] be so close to deceive the very elect
[1:01:33] and many people believe everything else
[1:01:35] is
[1:01:36] nothing we've got
[1:01:40] it brother Chris preached Wednesday
[1:01:43] night you see it's much closer than that
[1:01:46] it's not even the four walls of this
[1:01:48] church not four walls of our
[1:01:52] faith it's right down at the soul level
[1:01:54] that's right it's right down at the very
[1:01:57] committing my brother and sister Judas
[1:02:00] was empowered to cast out demons Amen to
[1:02:03] give blessings upon the people but come
[1:02:06] to the place that God asked for one more
[1:02:10] sacrifice Judas and Judas says I've give
[1:02:13] all I'm going to give I'm looking for
[1:02:16] some other result I'm looking for more
[1:02:18] with for less but my brother and sister
[1:02:21] God wants us you and I to be complete
[1:02:25] sold out can we say today Lord I want to
[1:02:29] be completely sold out I'm not just
[1:02:32] looking to put my name on a book but I'm
[1:02:35] looking for that kind of
[1:02:37] relationship with Jesus Christ amen so
[1:02:41] they got their prophets and they've got
[1:02:42] their message they've got their
[1:02:44] Vindication amen my brother and sister
[1:02:48] these things happen in the natural world
[1:02:50] where people are just committed
[1:02:52] committed completely so sold
[1:02:55] out you know it happens in the spiritual
[1:02:58] world people completely sold out and you
[1:03:00] say well if someone's completely sold
[1:03:02] out then they must have it my brother
[1:03:04] and sister I was just reading about a
[1:03:06] man that the the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:03:09] met him in Nepal he was in a monastery
[1:03:12] and he was there completely committed in
[1:03:14] this life actually come from a family
[1:03:16] that was somewhat affluent and had been
[1:03:18] raised in in a a Pampered life and and
[1:03:22] uh could not find any satisfaction ction
[1:03:24] because at that day as ad doed child he
[1:03:27] just asked for it his parents gave it to
[1:03:28] him don't do that you'll build a
[1:03:31] character all right but it'll be a bad
[1:03:33] one that's right and so it's there that
[1:03:35] he decided I need to go find what truth
[1:03:38] is oh my the path that God will send us
[1:03:41] on to find truth the path that God would
[1:03:44] lead us down we say well why didn't you
[1:03:46] just take me from where I was at right
[1:03:48] to truth but sometimes God's got to
[1:03:50] condition you and I to bring us to a
[1:03:52] place that we can recognize what he does
[1:03:54] does is doing in our life and here's
[1:03:56] this man he says I'm going to go become
[1:04:01] a Buddhist
[1:04:03] monk and here he is I want you to
[1:04:07] understand this this particular
[1:04:10] sect had an open window he lived in
[1:04:13] basically a castle an open window all
[1:04:17] four
[1:04:18] seasons sometimes the snow would reach
[1:04:20] the level of the bottom of his
[1:04:23] window
[1:04:25] but you're being
[1:04:27] selfish there was some words in there I
[1:04:29] can't remember big
[1:04:31] words but how that you are thinking of
[1:04:35] yourself if you was to try to block the
[1:04:38] cold and he slept on a stone bed a thin
[1:04:42] blanket no
[1:04:44] pillow and they interpreted that as a
[1:04:46] reasonable service to
[1:04:53] God
[1:04:57] I wouldn't make a Buddhist
[1:05:01] monk I would have invented
[1:05:04] Windows I would have invented a
[1:05:08] fireplace
[1:05:12] something but the whole time he never
[1:05:14] stopped crying out Lord I want
[1:05:18] truth and one day he's walking down the
[1:05:20] street in this little I don't they call
[1:05:23] it there little village and he sees a
[1:05:26] scrap of paper
[1:05:28] blowing and he's picking it up because
[1:05:31] it's litter and that's kind of a duty
[1:05:33] and but he broke the rules and he looked
[1:05:36] at it and it was talking about how Jesus
[1:05:39] Christ died for your
[1:05:44] sins and it referenced the Apostle Paul
[1:05:47] saying I died
[1:05:49] daily something in his heart that's
[1:05:53] it and he says so it's not about how
[1:05:55] much physical suffering I can
[1:05:59] endure but it's about what Christ has
[1:06:02] done for
[1:06:04] me an incredible story my brother and
[1:06:07] sister because you don't just walk in
[1:06:10] and tell them H here's my resignation
[1:06:12] I'm leaving because you took a vow that
[1:06:15] they own you you're their possession
[1:06:18] that's right and the tentacles of
[1:06:22] sin are very very grippy like an
[1:06:29] octopus so you see what happens my
[1:06:31] brother and
[1:06:33] sister these happenings that's taking
[1:06:36] place we'll look at the deal I look on
[1:06:39] the internet there at the news and and
[1:06:41] you read this of what is happening and I
[1:06:43] I found it very interesting I'm not
[1:06:45] being judgmental but I want to lay a
[1:06:46] platform for you so there is a man
[1:06:49] interviewing this Palestinian uh doctor
[1:06:52] he's a surgeon and uh it's from his home
[1:06:55] that he is uh Skyping or whatever you
[1:06:58] call that this day and age and and uh
[1:07:00] you can tell he lives in a very very
[1:07:03] beautiful house mahogany and fine
[1:07:06] tapestries and and uh this man asked him
[1:07:09] very directly so there's evidence hard
[1:07:12] evidence of of these uh people taking
[1:07:15] the life of mother and small child uh
[1:07:18] multiple times being shot and and would
[1:07:21] you condemn that and the man very
[1:07:24] articulate works his way around that and
[1:07:26] his final defense is they've did
[1:07:32] it but you see that defense is no
[1:07:36] defense others have
[1:07:41] sinned that's my justification others
[1:07:44] have done this and done that but my
[1:07:47] brother and sister that's not what God's
[1:07:48] looking at God is looking at the
[1:07:50] personal accountability of men and women
[1:07:54] and you look at this and realize in this
[1:07:56] whole interview taking place the man was
[1:07:59] very articulate he lays this out and you
[1:08:02] realize what is happening my brother and
[1:08:04] sister is there's a side being taken and
[1:08:07] it's because of ancestry and family ties
[1:08:10] and religion and all of these things is
[1:08:13] pulling even men who you can sense don't
[1:08:16] agree but they're stepping over to that
[1:08:19] side because there's something anointing
[1:08:21] them to be pulled into this to be unit
[1:08:25] Ed because what would a man living in
[1:08:28] those circumstances that would come on a
[1:08:30] on a a national news thing and and say
[1:08:33] no they were horrible they were beasts
[1:08:35] they were this they were that his life
[1:08:37] would be finished everything would come
[1:08:39] to a halt immediately and they recognize
[1:08:41] that so whether they like it or not
[1:08:43] they're being drawn to a certain side
[1:08:46] and this is happening in our natural
[1:08:48] world but let's not get caught on just
[1:08:50] the natural world it's happening in the
[1:08:52] spiritual
[1:08:54] it's happening in the spiritual when
[1:08:56] people are like our fam's always been
[1:08:58] this they've always went to church here
[1:09:01] this is what we've always believe but
[1:09:02] what does God draw you to now amen it's
[1:09:07] not about grandfather it's not about
[1:09:09] great grandfather my brother and sister
[1:09:12] it's about what God's personal dealing
[1:09:14] with you and I amen and so it's there
[1:09:17] this uniting that's taking place there
[1:09:19] is a manifesting taking place in the day
[1:09:22] that we live in amen we know my brother
[1:09:25] and sister as the word of God clearly
[1:09:27] shows us that every seed brings forth of
[1:09:30] its own kind and so what we're seeing
[1:09:33] now is this manifestation that is coming
[1:09:36] forth and as the seeds are being come
[1:09:38] now the seed that was spoken there of
[1:09:41] the Angel of the Lord to Hagar says that
[1:09:44] your son is going to be a wild man now
[1:09:47] if you're father is a wild man what is
[1:09:50] he passing down to you amen he has a
[1:09:53] great nation my look at this it's
[1:09:56] everywhere but my brother and sister
[1:09:58] it's based on the relationship of the
[1:10:02] father every seed my brother and sister
[1:10:05] that brings forth is based on the
[1:10:07] relationship of the father and so it's
[1:10:10] there that there is a a deeply rooted
[1:10:14] Spirit there that's this wild man amen
[1:10:17] and as I said what do you expect the
[1:10:19] sons to be you raise your kids as wild
[1:10:21] men there's a family they visited us a
[1:10:23] little bit years ago in the other church
[1:10:26] amen they live in the woods of Montana
[1:10:29] and they live a very unique I would say
[1:10:32] lifestyle amen and um you know uh the
[1:10:37] the the young man he come it was it was
[1:10:39] summer time and he showed up at the
[1:10:41] church in in in snow boots and he showed
[1:10:45] up in insulated
[1:10:46] pants and and all this stuff and he's
[1:10:49] sitting in church and he's sweating and
[1:10:51] I'm thinking what is what's going on
[1:10:53] here we got to visit with him ultimately
[1:10:56] he came to the church cuz he wanted
[1:10:58] baptized some of you might remember we
[1:11:00] took him out to the lake and we baptized
[1:11:02] him there in the park but my brother and
[1:11:04] sister it was there he goes well he says
[1:11:06] you you got to understand the the
[1:11:08] lifestyle we live I might go
[1:11:11] hiking and then just decide to sleep
[1:11:14] under a tree for the
[1:11:16] night I'm like that's interesting how
[1:11:19] long you been doing that I was raised
[1:11:21] that
[1:11:22] way see he doesn't know any different
[1:11:26] see what's happening when the word of
[1:11:27] God said train up a child in the way he
[1:11:30] should go and when he is older he will
[1:11:32] not depart from it that's a two-edged
[1:11:34] sword my brother and sister that they
[1:11:36] will not depart from it until the wooing
[1:11:39] of the Holy Spirit deals with them amen
[1:11:43] and so there
[1:11:46] is this wild
[1:11:49] nature but when you feed on a message
[1:11:51] that is division and chaos and anger
[1:11:56] once again referring back when we was
[1:11:58] there I I don't remember have to ask
[1:12:00] sister Jerry but these young men I
[1:12:03] thought it was so ironic I just laughed
[1:12:05] at them and said sure sure but we were
[1:12:08] we were there
[1:12:10] Bethlehem and and these young Arab
[1:12:13] children Palestinian children run up to
[1:12:15] me yell in my face
[1:12:19] allahar and I was just like yep right
[1:12:22] sure
[1:12:24] they're wearing Nikes Adidas shirt
[1:12:27] everything they profess to
[1:12:31] hate so the hate they're
[1:12:33] expressing isn't really real to them do
[1:12:37] you follow me cuz if it was real they
[1:12:40] would not dress in anything from the
[1:12:42] Western world but it's not real to them
[1:12:46] it's taught to them it's superficial
[1:12:48] it's on the surface and if taken in a
[1:12:50] different world and raised in a
[1:12:52] different deal that child could have
[1:12:53] very well turned up to believe in Jesus
[1:12:56] Christ but train that way now look
[1:13:00] what's happening my brother and sister
[1:13:01] we train our children do this and do
[1:13:04] that and you're saved then what will
[1:13:07] they expect when they grow up if I do
[1:13:09] this and I do that I'm saved but the
[1:13:12] word says it's a personal relationship
[1:13:14] with Jesus Christ amen there's nothing
[1:13:17] else that will get us there and so what
[1:13:21] what happens the difference is is when
[1:13:24] we go with God's word or we go with
[1:13:27] man's
[1:13:28] plan see that can be implemented right
[1:13:30] here in this church we could decide to
[1:13:33] go with our own plan or we could take it
[1:13:35] right back to the word of God and decide
[1:13:37] that we are going to hold this word in
[1:13:39] such value that we will not be pulled
[1:13:42] away from it we will not be wooed away
[1:13:44] from it my brother and sister reminds me
[1:13:47] of a story I was reading in the Cold War
[1:13:49] of a man who originally started out to
[1:13:51] be absolutely faithful to his his
[1:13:53] country and yet he was being offered
[1:13:55] more and more money until finally they
[1:13:58] reached a number that he couldn't resist
[1:14:01] and I just remember reading one time
[1:14:03] about a man who was a Christian amen and
[1:14:05] he was talking about the things of the
[1:14:07] world and how Satan would woo and he
[1:14:09] makes a statement that is stuck with me
[1:14:12] and he says Every Man Has a
[1:14:14] price I pray that my price is too high
[1:14:18] for Satan to
[1:14:19] pay oh my brother and sister let that s
[1:14:23] into us that we have a price but it's
[1:14:26] already been paid for us amen I'll tell
[1:14:30] you what see so what happens is is you
[1:14:32] follow this natural plan and you look at
[1:14:36] this and and you see that God said this
[1:14:38] would happen a wild man possessing the
[1:14:40] land would be there constantly a butting
[1:14:44] of heads a constant friction and we get
[1:14:46] to see it daily in the news but let's
[1:14:49] turn this another way the word of God
[1:14:51] said that Satan would come and he would
[1:14:54] afflict you with his fiery darts we're
[1:14:58] here today now those fiery darts can
[1:15:00] become personal of fronts to you or you
[1:15:03] as a son or daughter of God can stand
[1:15:05] and say I've been warned that the
[1:15:07] devil's got this opportunity I've been
[1:15:08] warned that the devil's going to have
[1:15:10] his punch I'm going to stand on the word
[1:15:12] of God and no matter what happens in my
[1:15:14] life I'm going to stand with the word
[1:15:18] amen you know the word gets compromised
[1:15:20] so easily we we won't even go into those
[1:15:23] subjects but we know that we see what's
[1:15:25] happening how the word becomes
[1:15:27] compromised so easily it starts with
[1:15:31] just a little word well the scripture
[1:15:34] says
[1:15:35] one can start with just one and so it's
[1:15:39] there that we find amen that it's there
[1:15:43] and we're following often times I got a
[1:15:46] good
[1:15:48] friend when you talk to
[1:15:51] him he'll in conversation tell you I
[1:15:55] think he's the seventh generation of
[1:15:57] Baptists in his
[1:16:00] family pretty impressive really nothing
[1:16:04] gets Baptist he's a good man him and his
[1:16:06] wife wonderful
[1:16:08] people but is that what we base our
[1:16:10] Salvation on is how many generations
[1:16:12] that we have been of a certain
[1:16:15] religion so you see in that we realize
[1:16:20] God is gracious to break the bond
[1:16:23] of the
[1:16:25] natural to be able today to say Thank
[1:16:28] You Lord that I am as my father is and
[1:16:33] my father is not a wild man my father is
[1:16:35] a savior he's a Healer he's a provider
[1:16:39] he's willing to give his life for me
[1:16:43] that's the kind of father I serve and I
[1:16:45] say thank you Lord that uh you broke the
[1:16:47] natural bonds amen cuz I can look and
[1:16:50] that no doubt my own children
[1:16:52] grandchildren would say say well we see
[1:16:53] these things in you grandpa but and and
[1:16:56] Dad and whatever but my brother and
[1:16:58] sister we recognize how strong the
[1:17:02] element of our natural is in our life
[1:17:06] and you know it's kind of scary because
[1:17:08] I used to laugh when I would hear people
[1:17:10] say it and they'd be like Oh I'm 50
[1:17:12] years old and I'm starting to act like
[1:17:13] my dad and I used to think that was so
[1:17:16] funny until I turned
[1:17:19] 50 and realized I don't want to be my
[1:17:22] dad
[1:17:27] and then every year that goes by another
[1:17:29] dad
[1:17:30] trait pops
[1:17:32] up and you just finally resign
[1:17:40] yourself but I tell you what God brought
[1:17:43] a change amen he broke the bond of the
[1:17:46] natural and poured in the spiritual and
[1:17:49] as every day goes by I find myself
[1:17:53] acting more and more like my father Amen
[1:17:57] to realize oh those heavenly traits that
[1:18:02] Heavenly genetics coming down into Sons
[1:18:04] and Daughters of God that we're not of
[1:18:07] this world we're not of the cares of
[1:18:09] this world we're not of the desires of
[1:18:11] this world but it is the nature of
[1:18:14] Christ and he said I poured myself into
[1:18:17] you and I say thank you Lord fill me to
[1:18:20] the top Fill Me To The Top up hallelujah
[1:18:24] amen now in the sermon God keeps his
[1:18:27] word it says right here 1957 it said and
[1:18:30] here the gospel come and give a mercy
[1:18:33] call throughout the Nations for years
[1:18:36] we've turned it down and now working the
[1:18:39] devil taking his seat is turning the
[1:18:42] hearts of these political men against
[1:18:44] Israel they're hooking up Over Yonder
[1:18:47] with the Arabs brother we're as good as
[1:18:49] gone that's right we'll sink as sure as
[1:18:52] the world now my brother and sister you
[1:18:55] can't tell me that God hasn't kept his
[1:18:57] word there's two great
[1:18:59] Nations the nation of Israel is not as
[1:19:03] many
[1:19:04] people but I'm telling you my brother
[1:19:06] and sister there is a certain I I for
[1:19:10] lack of a better word I'm sorry but
[1:19:11] there's a certain Vibe when you go there
[1:19:14] amen we had a tour guide the man had
[1:19:17] been which war was that do you remember
[1:19:19] Six Day War amen been shot been wounded
[1:19:22] wed had scars to prove this and he is
[1:19:26] there is an old man saying if war broke
[1:19:28] out tomorrow I would fight for my
[1:19:32] nation and you realize there's a fire
[1:19:35] burning inside
[1:19:37] there but he said we're not here to
[1:19:40] destroy anybody we've tried to open the
[1:19:43] borders with them right not an
[1:19:47] ecumenical
[1:19:49] movement not that kind of open borders
[1:19:53] but just to live as one country next to
[1:19:56] another which brings about a very
[1:19:59] interesting time when we were right
[1:20:01] there amen and uh at the Crossing of the
[1:20:08] Jordan is that
[1:20:10] Syrian Syrian guard on the other side do
[1:20:12] you guys remember Jordan Jordan do you
[1:20:15] guys remember that when he saw all of us
[1:20:18] over there looking across it's not very
[1:20:20] wide right there all of a sudden he's
[1:20:21] got his gun
[1:20:27] it was
[1:20:28] interesting you know and then basically
[1:20:31] when somebody come to relieve his duty
[1:20:32] he's halfway up the steps and he turns
[1:20:35] and he's
[1:20:36] like and walks
[1:20:38] off how many tourists has he looked at
[1:20:41] he's probably like oh those are
[1:20:42] Americans I'll show
[1:20:43] them but my brother and sister you see
[1:20:46] the conflict that's there they could
[1:20:48] live in that kind of Peace you can drive
[1:20:49] a few miles well I say a few miles few
[1:20:51] hours cross the Border go right into
[1:20:55] Jordan right there was some on the tour
[1:20:57] did that you know lost a phone lost
[1:21:00] glasses said the trip wasn't worth it
[1:21:04] but anyway amen but you see it's there
[1:21:09] that you look at this now it's given
[1:21:12] this Mercy call my brother and sister
[1:21:15] and and people didn't respond God dealt
[1:21:17] with Israel over and over and over again
[1:21:20] and they respond for a season and then
[1:21:22] they would cool right back off and go
[1:21:24] right back to their thing and what about
[1:21:26] America we got more churches than ever
[1:21:29] and the attendance amongst churches is
[1:21:31] declining rapidly and so it's not about
[1:21:34] the big buildings we built millions of
[1:21:37] dollars of buildings and no one wants to
[1:21:39] make the commitment to serve God it's
[1:21:42] too much
[1:21:45] work
[1:21:47] H but you can't tell me God doesn't keep
[1:21:49] his
[1:21:50] word now let's look at the other side of
[1:21:53] this story real quick here time getting
[1:21:55] away from us we'll tell as Paul Harvey
[1:21:57] used to say the rest of the story
[1:22:00] Abraham's spiritual seed now look my
[1:22:02] brother and sister
[1:22:04] Isaac and ishmail half
[1:22:10] Brothers there has to be some traits
[1:22:12] that they
[1:22:14] shared
[1:22:17] mannerisms both of them spiritual
[1:22:21] men that's right
[1:22:25] one
[1:22:27] Wild One
[1:22:32] calm their offspring the traits of their
[1:22:36] amount of children they have all these
[1:22:37] parallels that run through there but you
[1:22:40] look at this now the law of nature says
[1:22:43] that every seed must bring forth of its
[1:22:45] own kind aren't you glad you don't think
[1:22:48] you're planting an apple tree and you
[1:22:50] get a
[1:22:51] cactus amen
[1:22:53] every seed has to bring forth of its own
[1:22:55] kind and the promise has a continuation
[1:22:57] you realize that every promise God ever
[1:22:59] made in the Bible had a continuation to
[1:23:02] it you would see something fulfilled in
[1:23:05] the season but it will come and the
[1:23:08] pattern will repeat itself it's not as
[1:23:11] it is a complete Continuum but my
[1:23:13] brother and sister it's not a finality
[1:23:15] either so the promise of God is an
[1:23:18] unfolding that comes from generation to
[1:23:20] generation and it's that he made a
[1:23:23] promise unto your children and to your
[1:23:25] children's children and so God's
[1:23:27] allowing that Continuum to go on down
[1:23:30] but my brother and sister there's no
[1:23:32] guarantee that because your parents had
[1:23:34] the holy ghost that you're going to have
[1:23:35] the Holy Ghost you've got to get down in
[1:23:37] that private chamber and you've got to
[1:23:39] get in there with God Amen and it's not
[1:23:41] some old cold dry-eyed relationship but
[1:23:44] it's a passionate relationship that Lord
[1:23:47] You're My Savior and I love you and I
[1:23:49] want to serve you and I will amen
[1:23:52] Hallelujah and so as it's coming forth
[1:23:55] this continuation of fulfillment of it
[1:23:58] now in in this sermon we have seen his
[1:24:01] star and have come to worship him I I
[1:24:03] like this because of how this lays it
[1:24:05] out that it gives it very clear and when
[1:24:08] the Holy Ghost comes to you and reveals
[1:24:10] the word and makes it live just exact
[1:24:14] then it's a revelation to you you see it
[1:24:16] it's unfolded it's a promise for the
[1:24:18] hour now I can talk to you my brother
[1:24:21] and sister about what I have experience
[1:24:23] but if you never experience it all you
[1:24:26] have is second hand that's right and too
[1:24:28] many times we have as it is Anointed men
[1:24:32] or women sharing what they experienced
[1:24:35] in their life and people get excited and
[1:24:38] they say I like that that's good but
[1:24:41] they never actually experience it for
[1:24:44] themselves we need to have that kind of
[1:24:48] experience that it is my brother and
[1:24:50] sister my there's no no recorded history
[1:24:54] of ishmail laying on the altar with a
[1:24:57] knife at his chest and being there and
[1:25:00] God staying his hand so there will never
[1:25:03] be a time that ishmail will be able to
[1:25:05] say I've experienced God creating the
[1:25:08] ram in the bush I have experienced that
[1:25:10] my own father so obedient to God would
[1:25:14] be willing to sacrifice me to fulfill
[1:25:16] the word of God but I also saw that God
[1:25:20] respected my father's Comm commitment so
[1:25:23] much that he stayed his hand and I am
[1:25:25] here as a witness to that he had a
[1:25:28] blindfold he didn't have a gag on he
[1:25:30] witnessed
[1:25:32] this that was something he took with him
[1:25:34] all of his life but I tell you what they
[1:25:37] do have is they have ishmael's own
[1:25:39] experiences of being there without water
[1:25:42] in the desert and God guiding directly
[1:25:45] to the water and to say God's my
[1:25:47] provider
[1:25:48] also me
[1:25:50] too remember when we we spoke on that me
[1:25:53] too I did exactly what God showed me I
[1:25:56] heard God's voice but you see my brother
[1:25:58] and sister no promise to
[1:26:02] ishmail of eternal life that's
[1:26:12] right you see the multitudes joining
[1:26:15] together isn't this
[1:26:18] interesting I'm want to shorten this up
[1:26:20] just a little bit I knew I was just
[1:26:22] getting too much
[1:26:26] here there's a certain Aura do you
[1:26:29] remember because I've been reading about
[1:26:31] these things I get confused I believe it
[1:26:33] was a Six Day
[1:26:35] War
[1:26:36] um there was a known name in Israel of a
[1:26:41] war hero had been shot I believe it was
[1:26:44] in the hip or upper leg he's laying
[1:26:47] there bleeding profusely can't walk
[1:26:50] can't
[1:26:51] move an Egyptian's coming with a banet
[1:26:54] fixing to ban at him and he looks up in
[1:26:58] utter astonishment this man's witnessing
[1:27:01] he's laying on the ground looking at
[1:27:03] this man and the man's about to banet
[1:27:05] him in an utter astonishment drops his
[1:27:07] gun and turns and
[1:27:10] runs and that is experience that they
[1:27:12] share in that Nation how God came on the
[1:27:15] scene that was God they left weapons
[1:27:19] trucks idling tanks idling guns with a
[1:27:22] shell in the breach and they turned and
[1:27:28] ran God coming on the
[1:27:31] scene are you going to fight your battle
[1:27:33] or you going to let
[1:27:35] God Amen that's what it comes down to my
[1:27:38] brother and sister we either going to
[1:27:39] fight or God's going to fight and God
[1:27:42] won't fight until you quit fighting and
[1:27:45] give him the fight amen but look at this
[1:27:48] now the multitudes joining together I
[1:27:51] walk watched the other day an
[1:27:56] interview this might sound harsh
[1:27:58] visitors I'm sorry I'm just a blunt
[1:28:00] Country Boy raised in the farm and the
[1:28:06] Corell it's amazing how the UN can just
[1:28:09] choose such authentic people for their
[1:28:13] spokesman here's this guy
[1:28:16] with just the most gorgeous ponytail
[1:28:19] you've ever
[1:28:21] seen wearing just the right I don't know
[1:28:26] I'm sorry I'm not politically
[1:28:29] correct but all I got out of his whole
[1:28:31] thing about Israel needs to do what's
[1:28:34] right and you know everyone need to
[1:28:37] respect each other and they need to
[1:28:39] listen to the
[1:28:41] UN World memo no one in the world gives
[1:28:45] any credibility to the UN except for the
[1:28:48] people like the
[1:28:50] spokesman and then asked him well what
[1:28:52] about the UN demanding of Israel a a
[1:28:55] humanitarian access and the man blew me
[1:28:58] away when he says the UN is afraid of
[1:29:04] Israel yeah they're not afraid of Israel
[1:29:07] my brother and sister the truth of it is
[1:29:09] they're afraid of the god of
[1:29:11] Israel amen and the man is there talking
[1:29:14] about well we said we were going to do
[1:29:16] this and Israel told us no and we
[1:29:18] believed
[1:29:20] them how about we come to the place my
[1:29:23] brother and sister that when the devil
[1:29:24] says this this and this that we tell him
[1:29:26] no and he would believe us amen no devil
[1:29:30] you don't get our children no devil you
[1:29:32] don't get us no devil you don't get to
[1:29:34] control our life no devil you don't get
[1:29:36] to give this influence no devil and he
[1:29:39] will believe us my brother and sister
[1:29:41] you look at that but these multitudes
[1:29:43] are joining together and Egypt is over
[1:29:46] there I'm sorry to tie all this news
[1:29:48] together but to me I saw this whole
[1:29:50] context and hopefully I'm not out on on
[1:29:52] the limb but my brother and sister
[1:29:53] they're saying Egypt Egypt Egypt you
[1:29:55] ought to do this and Egypt says um we're
[1:29:58] going to just stay home we're going to
[1:30:00] mind our own business here last time we
[1:30:03] did what we did we got thrashed on and
[1:30:06] we're in no better position right now
[1:30:07] than we was
[1:30:08] then and Iran said well if that Israel
[1:30:12] keeps doing that we'll send our fighter
[1:30:14] jets and we'll destroy them and when the
[1:30:16] Jets met the Jets the Iranians turned
[1:30:18] and flew home my brother and sister can
[1:30:21] you see what God is doing it's not oh
[1:30:24] praise Israel they got their problems
[1:30:27] but this word of God will be
[1:30:30] fulfilled nothing no politics no things
[1:30:34] of this Earth will stop it but the word
[1:30:36] of God will be fulfilled and if the word
[1:30:39] of God declared that you as Sons and
[1:30:41] Daughters of God would be Overcomers and
[1:30:43] be Victorious and receive a healing amen
[1:30:46] the bomb of Gilead and when he said I'll
[1:30:49] give you back Sons and Daughters when he
[1:30:51] said I will anoint you to prophesy and
[1:30:54] dream dream that he meant it it wasn't
[1:30:57] just a hopeful or just a little word
[1:31:00] here but God said it would come to pass
[1:31:03] and when the word said that there would
[1:31:05] be a great catching away that would be
[1:31:07] there there's going to be a people my
[1:31:09] brother and sister that read that word
[1:31:11] and say God said it it will come to pass
[1:31:14] I'll be a part of that I'm going to be a
[1:31:17] participant in
[1:31:19] that Hallelujah amen it don't matter how
[1:31:23] many multitudes join together against
[1:31:25] the Bride of Jesus Christ it won't
[1:31:28] matter how many Devils just listen to a
[1:31:31] preacher the other day I respect the
[1:31:32] man's Ministry but I didn't quite see
[1:31:34] his point and he was talking about oh my
[1:31:37] what we have to fear the multitude of
[1:31:40] those demons been released out of the
[1:31:42] river Euphrates all the Christians in
[1:31:45] for a rough time well I'm telling you my
[1:31:47] brother and sister I've got Christ on my
[1:31:50] side and there's more that are with me
[1:31:52] than are against me and I don't have to
[1:31:55] sit and be afraid of what the world's
[1:31:57] going to my country over in Europe I
[1:32:01] won't even name a name has just made a
[1:32:03] little uh promotion to pass a law that
[1:32:06] making it mandatory that every child
[1:32:09] start their education at three years
[1:32:15] old the opponents right there in their
[1:32:17] own countries are like don't you mean
[1:32:20] start their indoctrination
[1:32:24] oh bam bam bam on the gaffle you're out
[1:32:27] of
[1:32:29] order why because the devil's
[1:32:32] exposed
[1:32:34] yeah yeah Hallelujah lovely old
[1:32:38] California you can't teach your own kids
[1:32:40] unless you got a teaching
[1:32:42] degree wait by the time you got your
[1:32:44] teaching degree your kids will be out of
[1:32:48] school
[1:32:49] well why because they want want to start
[1:32:53] young amen so you see when these
[1:32:59] multitudes are gathering together I'm
[1:33:02] using this whole thing with Hamas and
[1:33:04] Palestine and whatever as as the pattern
[1:33:08] you might say they're all joining
[1:33:10] together how long will it be we already
[1:33:11] see these other
[1:33:13] countries they they've got their own
[1:33:15] guys firing missiles over the Border in
[1:33:17] the north and they act like they can't
[1:33:20] do anything about it
[1:33:22] Jordan oh sorry Syria yeah what are we
[1:33:26] going to do about
[1:33:29] it one guy that I was looking he said I
[1:33:33] I would just like to ask a simple
[1:33:35] question if no one's involved where do
[1:33:38] all the missiles come
[1:33:41] from Gaza doesn't even have enough food
[1:33:44] and gasoline run generation plants and
[1:33:47] feed their people and they're building
[1:33:50] hypersonic
[1:33:52] pinpoint accurate missiles no see
[1:33:55] there's others joining
[1:33:58] behind other
[1:34:01] ones and if a spirit be cast
[1:34:05] out and return and find it cleaned and
[1:34:10] garnished but unoccupied that's right he
[1:34:14] goes and gets seven of his
[1:34:16] friends because they're all willing to
[1:34:19] come and serve with him you see the
[1:34:22] parallels my brother and sister natural
[1:34:24] spiritual coming this is not a war of
[1:34:28] geopolitics this is a war for men and
[1:34:31] women's Souls this is a war for control
[1:34:33] and Satan as he tempts Jesus he says
[1:34:36] look if you'll just bow down to me I'll
[1:34:38] give you all the kingdoms of the world
[1:34:40] he wasn't just bowing smoke at him
[1:34:42] Saints he literally was the prince that
[1:34:46] had possession when Jesus said H don't
[1:34:48] matter I'll get it all anyway the day
[1:34:51] will come it's mine anyhow you're just a
[1:34:53] temporary occupier you see as these
[1:34:56] multitudes are joining together and all
[1:34:58] this evil and and I find this I hope
[1:35:01] this doesn't offend any of our friends
[1:35:03] that that come from that part of the
[1:35:04] world but I thought it was so
[1:35:06] interesting uh Putin on the
[1:35:09] news rebuking Israel for their
[1:35:13] behavior man who has destroyed a big
[1:35:16] chunk of eastern Ukraine and even
[1:35:20] amongst his own people just chaos
[1:35:22] happening and and he's
[1:35:27] so I'm just stunned when I watched this
[1:35:32] it's Israel's fault they shouldn't
[1:35:33] behave this way and ultimately it's
[1:35:35] United States's fault
[1:35:37] okay okay
[1:35:39] good but what foot would he have to
[1:35:42] stand on but you see the word must be
[1:35:50] fulfilled
[1:35:55] they're joining
[1:35:58] together now do you realize this is all
[1:36:00] about
[1:36:01] parallels do you realize everything is a
[1:36:05] parallel in the
[1:36:08] parallel they're joining together it's
[1:36:11] got to be something else taking
[1:36:13] place there's got to be something else
[1:36:16] taking place amen now look at this in
[1:36:19] this amongst the p parallel it's uniting
[1:36:22] time yes sir now uniting time in sign
[1:36:26] goes like this notice they're right now
[1:36:30] uniting you say brother brandham is that
[1:36:32] true they're coming to the battle of
[1:36:34] Armageddon exactly what will they do see
[1:36:37] and they're uniting for that right now
[1:36:40] see this is a lot of years before amen a
[1:36:43] lot of years six years they're uniting
[1:36:46] for that right
[1:36:49] now and that's why we got the un and
[1:36:52] everything we have the Western world's
[1:36:54] uniting against the Eastern World
[1:36:56] communism so forth It's all uniting
[1:36:58] together the churches are uniting
[1:37:00] together everything seems to be uniting
[1:37:02] together and if you don't think that
[1:37:03] church is uniting together I I'm still
[1:37:06] stunned about that video that come out a
[1:37:09] few years ago of those ecumenical uh
[1:37:12] minded uh ecclesiastical minded uh apos
[1:37:16] not Apostolic uh
[1:37:19] Pentecostal and the guy's there and he's
[1:37:21] went in had an audience with the Pope
[1:37:22] and he comes out and they're like what
[1:37:24] was this and he's telling oh the most
[1:37:26] glorious thing we're all coming home to
[1:37:30] Mama right I'm sorry not my mama ex no
[1:37:34] sir Babylon is not my mama amen that
[1:37:38] Spirit of Babylon not my mama no but see
[1:37:41] anointed they're saying well this is
[1:37:43] where it all come from I'm sorry my
[1:37:45] brother and sister they got not one
[1:37:46] shred that Peter was the pope not one
[1:37:49] shred they repeated it enough times that
[1:37:52] the world believes them and not one
[1:37:54] shred of Hard
[1:37:56] Evidence but it's been repeated so much
[1:37:59] that it's
[1:38:01] become Doctrine
[1:38:04] yeah I was going to say a universal lie
[1:38:08] but yeah I know that's pretty pretty
[1:38:13] straightforward so what's happening
[1:38:15] they're uniting together so you have
[1:38:17] people United under that that once their
[1:38:20] forefather fought gave their lives and
[1:38:23] praise God at the Revelation that by
[1:38:27] faith that's it by faith my brother and
[1:38:30] sister no other thing by
[1:38:35] faith now it's come back made the full
[1:38:44] circle we got the UN and everything we
[1:38:46] have the Western World against the
[1:38:47] Eastern World communist so forth It's
[1:38:49] all uniting together churches un uned
[1:38:51] together everything seems to be uniting
[1:38:54] uniting themselves together we see that
[1:38:56] and um so you look here that's I
[1:39:00] actually had that's where I had the note
[1:39:01] about the UN it was interesting because
[1:39:05] the guy sitting there saying well we're
[1:39:06] actually afraid of them we're afraid of
[1:39:09] what they'll do little tinge of wild man
[1:39:12] right there right they don't know what
[1:39:15] they'll do but
[1:39:18] wait Hamas almost killed
[1:39:21] the UN
[1:39:23] observers that were in
[1:39:26] Gaza little you wild man there go find
[1:39:31] that
[1:39:32] story
[1:39:34] no
[1:39:37] selective
[1:39:40] selective also while this uniting of the
[1:39:42] nation these signs n National signs we
[1:39:45] see out here in the world earthquakes in
[1:39:47] diverse places different things uniting
[1:39:49] bringing the world together bringing the
[1:39:50] people people together all the churches
[1:39:52] together all these things and while this
[1:39:54] uniting has been going on there's
[1:39:56] another uniting going on amen that's
[1:39:58] what I want to point to you now God is
[1:40:02] uniting his bride she is coming together
[1:40:05] from east and west and north and south
[1:40:08] there's a uniting time that's on right
[1:40:10] now what is she uniting for the Rapture
[1:40:14] amen God's getting her ready yes sir
[1:40:17] uniting what is she uniting with the
[1:40:20] word
[1:40:21] amen we don't have a church Dogma over
[1:40:24] here a book that we refer to page
[1:40:26] whatever my brother and sister we have a
[1:40:29] book all right amen and you don't even
[1:40:31] have to buy it from the church you can
[1:40:33] just get it just about anywhere amen and
[1:40:35] it's there that God has made this his
[1:40:38] his uh Cornerstone for us to build from
[1:40:42] yes sir uniting what's uniting with with
[1:40:44] the word for all heavens and earth will
[1:40:46] pass away but my word will shall never
[1:40:48] pass away she's uniting herself with
[1:40:51] thus sayith the Lord regardless of what
[1:40:53] any denomination or anybody else says
[1:40:55] she's uniting herself she's getting
[1:40:58] ready why she is the bride now that
[1:41:01] seems like an aous statement my brother
[1:41:03] and sister but in a minute we'll take it
[1:41:05] right back to scripture that in in that
[1:41:07] uniting my brother and sister she is
[1:41:10] there for one reason that's motivated
[1:41:13] one reason that has brought her well to
[1:41:15] say one reason is not quite accurate but
[1:41:17] Follow Me One Reason that's there and
[1:41:19] that is because she's the bride and the
[1:41:21] bride has to be there for the bridegroom
[1:41:25] she's not the bride if she won't submit
[1:41:27] to the bridegroom oh forget about modern
[1:41:30] societal things my brother and sister of
[1:41:32] we're equal here and we're equal there
[1:41:35] even a man like Dave Ramsey given
[1:41:37] Financial advice these people call in
[1:41:39] and say well my husband and I we got
[1:41:41] everything split down the middle we did
[1:41:43] this and did this and da Ramsey is like
[1:41:45] so you say you have one boy yeah we have
[1:41:47] one little boy did you split
[1:41:49] him
[1:41:52] what is it he is the perfect union of a
[1:41:55] man and a woman and that could never
[1:41:57] come to pass if we were living like we
[1:41:59] should without there being a husband and
[1:42:02] a wife a bridegroom and a bride and the
[1:42:06] world my brother and sister caught up in
[1:42:07] their well we have accepted this and we
[1:42:10] have accepted that you accept what you
[1:42:12] want to this is what I accepted amen
[1:42:15] that's what I accepted Hallelujah some
[1:42:17] loose notes hallelujah look at this she
[1:42:21] is the bride that's right she's uniting
[1:42:23] herself with her bridegroom see and the
[1:42:25] bridegroom is the word in the beginning
[1:42:28] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:42:30] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:42:31] made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the
[1:42:34] church and the bride and the word
[1:42:36] becoming so one until the very word
[1:42:39] itself is working out the works of the
[1:42:43] bridegroom have you ever noted in a good
[1:42:45] marriage and some people offended that I
[1:42:48] would put it that way I'm sorry be
[1:42:50] offended
[1:42:51] but in a good marriage my brother and
[1:42:53] sister the wife can answer for the
[1:43:00] husband in a good
[1:43:03] marriage in other
[1:43:07] words let's share it this way people
[1:43:10] owed us a pretty good chunk of money for
[1:43:11] some hay that we sold them and I told
[1:43:14] them I I'm I'm gone I'm over here on a
[1:43:16] tractor way away and they're like well
[1:43:18] I'll come back later I said no just go
[1:43:20] over and give that to my
[1:43:22] wife I can give this to your
[1:43:26] wife
[1:43:28] yeah yeah any money issues we have in
[1:43:30] our house are just between me and
[1:43:35] her he goes but
[1:43:38] um will you get
[1:43:44] it yeah look let me explain this to you
[1:43:48] my wife knows me so well yeah I can walk
[1:43:52] in the house and she go you got a smirk
[1:43:54] on your
[1:43:56] face I can walk right over to the mirror
[1:43:58] and there's nothing on my
[1:44:00] face but I was smirking in
[1:44:04] here and she'll be blah blah blah and
[1:44:07] I'm like and she's going to then say da
[1:44:09] da and lo and behold it
[1:44:12] happens that's when two have become one
[1:44:19] amen now how in the church with the
[1:44:22] title of brine have a different opinion
[1:44:27] than her
[1:44:28] husband how can she speak something
[1:44:31] that's not the word and stand on that
[1:44:33] and say that's what we
[1:44:36] believe you don't believe the word amen
[1:44:39] because our husband the Lord Jesus
[1:44:41] Christ he spoke and this bride has
[1:44:44] become one with her husband and she only
[1:44:48] wants to speak it's it's not a matter of
[1:44:51] conforming I I'll speak what my husband
[1:44:53] wants me to speak no she wants to she
[1:44:57] wants to speak his word she wants to be
[1:45:00] identified in him she wants to lay claim
[1:45:04] to him and to have him lay claim to her
[1:45:10] amen amen oh she's uniting herself she's
[1:45:14] getting ready why she is the bride and
[1:45:19] she's uniting herself for their
[1:45:20] bridegroom and the bridegroom is a word
[1:45:23] amen I'm I'm repeating myself I'm sorry
[1:45:25] lost myself there and the Word was God
[1:45:28] and the Word was made flesh and dwell
[1:45:30] amongst us in the church and the bride
[1:45:32] and the word becoming so one until the
[1:45:34] very word itself is working the works of
[1:45:37] the bridegroom you see it a uniting amen
[1:45:41] not no more join the church that's it
[1:45:44] where is it my brother and sister
[1:45:45] there's no join the church amen we don't
[1:45:48] need to stamp a brand that says Grace
[1:45:50] Tabernacle on you we need to stamp the
[1:45:53] Briand of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:45:56] to be identified with him amen
[1:46:01] amen amen you see a uniting not no more
[1:46:04] join the church not no more of this but
[1:46:06] flee from everything and tied to Jesus
[1:46:09] Christ see it's uniting time God uniting
[1:46:13] his bride together bringing it back just
[1:46:15] exactly uniting the words of his
[1:46:18] promise That's What's happen and you
[1:46:20] know what this is I'm going to use this
[1:46:22] paper as a little example here pick it
[1:46:24] off the floor at the same time amen you
[1:46:26] know what's happening in the promise of
[1:46:27] God's word my brother and sister the
[1:46:29] promise has always been there that's it
[1:46:31] it's always been there just like we were
[1:46:34] in him right the lamb slain before the
[1:46:36] foundation of the world we always was in
[1:46:39] him but here's the promise and in all of
[1:46:42] life the promise comes and one day we
[1:46:46] are not just by chance but a un uniting
[1:46:50] taking place and This Promise becomes
[1:46:54] our
[1:46:55] promise sir and when that promise
[1:46:57] actually becomes our
[1:47:00] promise well there ain't no taking it

[1:47:05] go of

[1:47:08] promise that the blood washed away every
[1:47:11] sin that I had I'm not going to let the

[1:47:17] away from me I'm not going to let the

[1:48:38] have to admit I'll make a confession to
[1:48:39] you church I I was whining the other day
[1:48:42] and it took a little word sharp word of
[1:48:45] rebuke from my
[1:48:47] wife well it wasn't real sharp it felt
[1:48:50] like like it was sharp can we go by
[1:48:54] feelings you know how she did it she
[1:48:56] just sent me a
[1:48:57] scripture I sitting there in the machine
[1:48:59] she just knew my face was probably this
[1:49:01] giant frowny face she just sends me a
[1:49:04] scripture and I read it and I was like
[1:49:07] first thought you know the devil's on
[1:49:09] the
[1:49:10] job easy for you to
[1:49:12] [Music]
[1:49:15] say second thought Chopper guiding
[1:49:19] itself down the field
[1:49:21] capital letters
[1:49:23] amen amen CU that was the truth
[1:49:26] amen and then I just felt the whole
[1:49:28] burden lift off of me when I said amen
[1:49:30] to the word I felt this burden just lift
[1:49:34] off not to sound carnal or
[1:49:38] whatever but it's like
[1:49:41] H the Lord set my
[1:49:44] table right
[1:49:46] there who am I to say Lord you made a
[1:49:49] mistake
[1:49:51] where you set my
[1:49:53] table his ways are
[1:49:56] perfect and I want to be a perfect Son
[1:49:59] of God Amen you know how you become a
[1:50:02] perfect son or daughter of God say Amen
[1:50:04] to the word let the word be manifested

[1:50:19] and give honor to him for the marriage
[1:50:21] of the Lamb has
[1:50:23] come and that last portion of that line
[1:50:26] gives me great
[1:50:27] encouragement because it's not future
[1:50:30] tense
[1:50:31] Saints it's a past
[1:50:34] tense I want to ask you a blunt question
[1:50:37] do you feel
[1:50:45] ready okay let's talk about the flesh
[1:50:49] first flesh don't feel
[1:50:52] ready but there is a deep rooted
[1:50:59] confidence that if God called me God
[1:51:02] called you that he's not going to leave
[1:51:05] you
[1:51:07] unprepared if we just have religion then
[1:51:09] well it's going to be what it's going to
[1:51:11] be but if you have a deep Abiding Love
[1:51:15] and embracing the word of God embracing
[1:51:17] his life and letting that seed come to
[1:51:20] life then don't have fear don't listen
[1:51:22] to the devil don't find yourself blown
[1:51:25] Every Which Way and always in a turmoil
[1:51:28] settle down and say if God called me
[1:51:31] he's never lost a one he finishes
[1:51:33] everything he begins and he began this
[1:51:36] work in me I didn't begin the work in me
[1:51:39] he began it and I'm going to have
[1:51:41] confidence in you Lord that you're
[1:51:43] finishing this same work oh let's just
[1:51:46] stand Hallelujah I could just go on and
[1:51:48] on and on Saints
[1:51:51] amen yeah I think any Minister would be
[1:51:55] able to say that the part of the reason

[1:52:27] glory to God to shout to the heavens let
