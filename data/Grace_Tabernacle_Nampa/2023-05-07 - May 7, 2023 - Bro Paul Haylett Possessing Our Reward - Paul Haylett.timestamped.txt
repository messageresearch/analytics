[40:08] Manasseh I think Grace is probably with
[40:10] her brother Manassas graduating from
[40:13] college
[40:14] this Monumental moments in our lives
[40:17] amen I want to remind you a bible study
[40:19] this evening at five so all of you that
[40:22] could make it and then this will be our
[40:25] last call
[40:27] for us the seals books
[40:30] um so if you have not responded please
[40:34] let me know we want to make sure we
[40:37] order adequate number for the Saints
[40:39] here in the church I was talking with
[40:42] brother George he has now received what
[40:45] you might say is the Prototype copy
[40:47] which is uh the you might say one-up
[40:51] copy that they had made for final
[40:53] approval and brother George says it's a
[40:56] lovely book it's put together very well
[40:58] the same quality as the church age book
[41:02] leather covered uh the
[41:05] paperback is good thick paper good solid
[41:10] book but brother George you know really
[41:14] really would say you're going to be
[41:15] blessed if you just get the leather book
[41:17] because it it's just going to be a
[41:20] lifelong
[41:21] book so
[41:23] let's turn in our Bibles today I want to
[41:25] speak to you thank you musicians I want
[41:28] to speak to you once again it's been a
[41:30] little bit since I touched on this but
[41:32] of things that are to be now the things
[41:34] that are to be Saints are the promise of
[41:37] the word that has been spoken in not all
[41:40] of that promise was you might say
[41:42] brought right by Brother Branham at this
[41:44] time you see brother Branham put
[41:46] together by his own testimony the loosed
[41:49] ends of the ages and there were things
[41:51] that God waited for this day to reveal
[41:54] but many of these things are just being
[41:56] put in order now if any of you have ever
[41:58] worked in a warehouse now I I did as a
[42:02] Young Man worked in a warehouse for a
[42:04] season and
[42:05] um you know under the management a
[42:08] warehouse can become chaos where people
[42:10] would say we know it's here but we can't
[42:12] find it and so in that we'll find that
[42:15] Under New Management and an orderly
[42:18] fashion is there that if it says that it
[42:21] is on a certain aisle in a certain
[42:23] position you with confidence can go
[42:26] there and find it and I use that analogy
[42:29] because you see that's what the prophet
[42:30] of God did in our day he didn't come to
[42:33] bring something that was out of the
[42:35] scripture but it was there in chaos that
[42:38] people were saying we think this means
[42:39] this and we think that means that the
[42:42] prophet of God come and he set this in
[42:44] order where we as Believers or
[42:47] Christians today can come and say you
[42:50] know what if we're willing to put the
[42:52] effort in we can come and say here it is
[42:54] in the scripture now you know brother
[42:56] George puts it this way coming from a
[42:59] Baptist background being raised by
[43:01] parents that were Baptist missionaries
[43:03] brother George puts it quite strongly
[43:05] and says you know any old Baptist
[43:09] can bury most message Believers in the
[43:13] scripture
[43:14] so it's really a delinquency that we
[43:16] have allowed to take place that we don't
[43:19] know our Bibles better than we do amen
[43:23] so we're not going to be able to blame
[43:24] anyone else people say well the message
[43:26] this no it's you amen Lord help us Amen
[43:31] to just be more diligent to to dig into
[43:34] that so uh we just want to look at these
[43:37] things that are to be going on through
[43:39] that and today I'd like to speak to you
[43:41] on possessing our reward and we will
[43:44] take that out of second John the first
[43:46] chapter verses one through eight and uh
[43:50] in this we're going to look my brother
[43:52] and sister at the word and what the word
[43:55] is saying about us now the word is
[43:59] corrective can we say Amen to that it
[44:01] should be amen I think it was A.W Tozer
[44:04] said that um you know people are might
[44:08] be over there and say you know what
[44:11] um what you preached to me was too harsh
[44:17] but he says God's ministers
[44:20] are not some Lily livered
[44:23] people afraid of offending someone
[44:27] pretty strong words isn't it but we
[44:30] actually like preachers who don't offend
[44:31] us
[44:32] we feel more comfortable we can go to
[44:34] church not worried about kind of getting
[44:37] called
[44:38] but my brother and sister when we get
[44:40] there that day and stand and our little
[44:43] fluffy preacher
[44:45] that sold us short you're not going to
[44:47] look at him and say well I still enjoyed
[44:49] your preaching you're going to look at
[44:50] him on that day and say why didn't you
[44:52] tell me the truth
[44:53] amen so we want to strike the balance
[44:55] right not to be offensive but to
[44:58] definitely preach the truth amen so I
[45:02] love this out of second John uh sister
[45:05] Jerry after all these years many of you
[45:07] will say oh brother Paul that's old hunt
[45:08] but just the other day sister Jerry
[45:10] showed me how that I can actually listen
[45:13] to my Bible on my phone while I'm
[45:16] working
[45:17] now some of you are going to say brother
[45:18] Paul that's been around since they put
[45:21] the Bible on the phone but you see I'm a
[45:23] late bloomer
[45:25] and a late embracer of Technology amen
[45:29] but it's been good I've been just
[45:31] listening as I drive back and forth at
[45:33] three and a half miles an hour
[45:35] and the tractor is doing all the work so
[45:38] I'm have a lot of time to focus on what
[45:40] I'm hearing and it's good amen second
[45:43] John 1 1-8 the Elder unto the elect lady
[45:47] and her children whom I love in the
[45:50] truth not I only but also all they have
[45:55] known the truth for the truth's sake
[45:58] which dwelleth in US so where are we
[46:01] going to find the word living
[46:03] in US
[46:04] shall be with us
[46:06] forever
[46:08] imagine that if we were in the mind of
[46:11] God before the foundation of the world
[46:14] and we will be with him in eternity we
[46:18] have always been in truth
[46:22] even when we are not cognizant of Truth
[46:25] we were in truth amen Grace be with you
[46:30] mercy and peace from God the father and
[46:33] from the Lord Jesus Christ the son of
[46:34] the father in truth and love I Rejoice
[46:38] greatly that I found of thy children
[46:40] Walking In Truth as we have received a
[46:44] commandment from the father and now I
[46:46] beseech thee lady not as though I wrote
[46:49] a new commandment unto thee but that
[46:52] which we had from the beginning that we
[46:55] love one another
[46:57] and this is love that we walk after his
[47:01] Commandments this is a Commandment that
[47:04] as ye have heard from the beginning that
[47:06] ye should walk in it for many deceivers
[47:09] are entered into the world who confess
[47:11] not that Jesus Christ Has Come In the
[47:13] Flesh now my brother and sister it's all
[47:16] on how you want to interpret this many
[47:18] people will say yes yes I know Jesus
[47:21] Christ He Walked In the Flesh I believe
[47:24] myself now I don't want to make a
[47:26] Doctrine but I believe this scripture is
[47:28] not talking about his flesh that was
[47:30] there on the shores of Galilee but it's
[47:33] talking about him walking in flesh today
[47:39] amen and you'd be shocked that people
[47:42] actually don't believe that
[47:44] they believe God's in heaven and we are
[47:47] just these little people down here
[47:48] trying to do our best but as I shared
[47:51] with you the other day my brother and
[47:53] sister this isn't what I'm trying to be
[47:56] this is what God Said I am
[48:00] amen so if we are the word amen and it
[48:03] was poured into flesh in this day then
[48:06] we are the very manifestation of the
[48:08] scripture
[48:10] amen
[48:12] this is a deceiver and an antichrist
[48:15] pretty strong words there look to
[48:17] yourselves that we lose not those things
[48:21] which we have wrought but that we
[48:23] receive a full reward Heavenly Father we
[48:27] just ask you to lead us today guide us
[48:29] father for those that are sick father we
[48:31] just ask the Lord that you would touch
[48:33] Lord bodies affirmities father ear aches
[48:36] whatever it might be that would be a
[48:38] hindrance today uh stomach aches
[48:41] whatever it might be father just ask you
[48:43] to come down touch each one and Lord is
[48:46] the prophet of God as talking about Oral
[48:49] Roberts and preaching of of having a
[48:52] point of contact now the prophet lays it
[48:54] out father I just pray today that each
[48:57] one Lord that might hear this but is not
[48:59] in the house of God would not set back
[49:02] and bemoan the fact Lord but would be
[49:04] able to reach out the point of contact
[49:06] which is you the Holy Spirit and lay
[49:08] claim on that Lord that they would find
[49:11] their very Deliverance the afflictions
[49:13] father physically mentally emotionally
[49:16] spiritually today in the name of Jesus
[49:19] Christ we thank you Lord in your name
[49:21] amen you may be seated
[49:26] you know I was just um
[49:30] visiting with a brother a friend of mine
[49:32] that is a pastor and he was we were
[49:36] talking along a certain subject line and
[49:38] he said you know brother Paul he said
[49:40] what would fix a lot of problems around
[49:42] the message and you know you're always
[49:44] interested in something that will give
[49:46] you the antidote how to fix problems
[49:49] right amen you know if you uh if you
[49:52] have a little something and and you
[49:55] don't know how to fix it you you someone
[49:57] says I know how you know you listen to
[50:00] them often times uh seems though you
[50:03] know in the world of Google Dr Google
[50:05] Etc that they have their own ideas it's
[50:08] not really a proven remedy but you know
[50:11] it's just the nature of man that we
[50:13] would live and try to do that and the
[50:16] brother says I tell you uh how we can
[50:18] fix the problems in the message and I
[50:20] think that I'll lift my hand for you
[50:22] today that we really want to fix the
[50:25] problems that we see around us and he
[50:27] said if we would just listen to the word
[50:29] and how brother Branham brought it out
[50:31] and just love one another that would fix
[50:33] a lot of our problems amen because the
[50:35] love is there covers a multitude of sins
[50:38] and my brother and sister will look at
[50:40] this and the uh Apostle John we see John
[50:44] is projecting uh the love of God to the
[50:47] seed of the elect seed of God he's
[50:50] speaking to them in a very positive
[50:53] fashion uh you know is telling them uh
[50:56] to the Elder unto the elector lady and
[50:59] her children who I love in the truth now
[51:01] John is not saying if you don't agree
[51:03] with me I don't love you but he is
[51:05] saying that there is a certain bond that
[51:07] comes in The Fellowship of the word of
[51:10] God in the truth that is there that
[51:12] draws together and that is what knits us
[51:15] together as a group of Believers from
[51:17] different countries cultures languages
[51:20] Etc that it is not just some great
[51:23] overwhelming human love but it is the
[51:26] very love of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[51:29] that grows from there into a love as it
[51:32] is for individuals now that brings us to
[51:36] understand who they are and how people
[51:38] are and to have Grace for each one of us
[51:41] is little idiosyncrasies and uh if you
[51:45] don't think you have idiosyncrasies just
[51:47] ask me I can point them out for you but
[51:49] it's there that I want to just talk to
[51:52] you for a moment on uh gender pronouns
[51:55] amen that seems like a strange topic
[51:58] right to throw in the middle of this but
[52:01] as you look at this John is speaking to
[52:05] the bride of Christ he's speaking to men
[52:07] and women boys girls uh to the elders to
[52:11] the babes and he calls them the elect
[52:16] lady
[52:17] there is and you say that's not what
[52:20] they mean really brother Paul well
[52:21] you'll forgive me for my interpretation
[52:23] but you see he branded them with an
[52:26] identification that they are one elect
[52:30] and two they're a lady
[52:33] amen and we know that the church has
[52:36] always been represented in the feminine
[52:39] and so it's there that it shows this
[52:42] election of God was to reach out and not
[52:45] to a rebel this is not some depiction my
[52:49] brother and sister of a rebellious
[52:51] church but this is a church that is a
[52:54] lady
[52:55] are you with me
[52:57] you would find that in this day and age
[53:00] it's actually offensive
[53:03] in the age of pronouns and such
[53:06] you hold the door and I experience this
[53:10] somewhat recent you hold the door
[53:14] and they don't look at you and as they
[53:16] walk by they Mumble something that
[53:18] resembled
[53:19] thank you
[53:22] and then you say
[53:25] thank you ma'am
[53:27] and then
[53:31] you see there's nothing feminine there's
[53:34] nothing that's a lady there
[53:37] it's a female
[53:39] identified by whatever Spirit they
[53:42] choose to be identified with
[53:44] and so that is the age that we're living
[53:47] in that to be qualified as the elect
[53:50] lady first you're going to have to be
[53:52] elected
[53:53] but you're going to have to also have
[53:55] this manifestation of a submissive
[53:58] Church it can't be a church that is
[54:01] headstrong it cannot be a people that
[54:03] are going to do it their way and then
[54:05] blame it on God when it doesn't work
[54:07] like the word said it would and so this
[54:10] elect lady my brother and sister but not
[54:12] her only her children also so the church
[54:15] of living God in this day is producing
[54:19] children amen not only the natural but
[54:22] producing children in the spiritual that
[54:26] are once again qualified to be called
[54:28] the elect lady to step in and say you
[54:31] know what I know who I am in Jesus
[54:34] Christ and I'm not ashamed to be
[54:36] identified as Mrs Jesus Christ his wife
[54:41] amen not not to have to do I find it
[54:44] interesting I don't blame anybody if
[54:46] anybody here would be or somewhere else
[54:49] would be but I find it interesting in
[54:52] light of the scripture that we see in
[54:54] this day and age that people get married
[54:57] and will not take the husband's name
[55:00] they still want to maintain an identity
[55:03] that is outside of that now you know I
[55:06] like to listen to Dave Ramsey uh you
[55:09] know money guy not all the time just
[55:10] when the moment is uh you know right got
[55:13] a moment there to listen and you know
[55:15] here's a guy nominal Christian but you
[55:18] know pretty wise in the ways of the
[55:20] world and finances Etc and just a few
[55:23] days ago someone called in and said you
[55:25] know me and my husband or having these
[55:28] troubles and he keeps overspending and I
[55:32] have to keep subsidizing him and you
[55:35] know it's right at that point Dave
[55:37] Ramsey says Whoa stop what do you mean
[55:39] you're subsidizing him well you know
[55:42] he's doing so he digs into this and the
[55:45] husband is taking and using his paycheck
[55:47] to pay for the house the cars the
[55:50] groceries everything and then she has
[55:53] her paycheck and she's angry that she
[55:55] has to actually contribute to this
[55:57] relationship
[56:00] and Dave Ramsey said are you telling me
[56:02] you have their separate accounts and she
[56:05] said yes I I'm not going to share my
[56:08] account with him man this guy can be
[56:10] blunt my brother and sister he if he was
[56:12] called to be a preacher most people
[56:13] wouldn't like him he says you know I'm
[56:15] sorry you're not going to like this but
[56:17] I don't think your marriage is going to
[56:19] last very long
[56:21] now my brother and sister you look back
[56:23] in this scripture and this is the
[56:26] picture that God paints for us of Israel
[56:29] as a wife wanted to live and do but they
[56:32] wanted God to make the contribution
[56:35] they wanted God to be the sole support
[56:37] while they lived like they wanted to
[56:39] live and that relationship from the
[56:41] beginning of the book all the way until
[56:43] God calls 144 000 has been a troubled
[56:48] relationship but look where God is
[56:51] called this elect Lady of this day
[56:53] called her we're not dish Rags amen and
[56:56] we should not treat our natural wives
[56:58] daughters that way but my brother and
[57:01] sister this elect lady is submissive and
[57:04] if God says stop she stops if God says
[57:07] go she goes if God says I want you to
[57:10] pray about it before you do it we pray
[57:13] about it before we do it and we take
[57:15] those things as the prophet of God said
[57:17] if it's a question mark set it on his
[57:19] shelf God will answer it in time and we
[57:22] want to be obedient to that it sure says
[57:25] saves a lot of Heartache my brother and
[57:26] sister of having to go back and fix
[57:29] things that we did
[57:32] and then we say Lord why'd you allow it
[57:34] to happen he didn't allow it to happen
[57:36] we were disobedient
[57:38] we stepped out of his will we stepped
[57:40] over into our own realm of what we were
[57:42] sure God wanted us to do but did we even
[57:46] ask God no we had an opinion of what he
[57:49] thought
[57:50] but you see as I shared with you last
[57:52] Wednesday one of the biggest blessings
[57:54] the greatest blessings and God got it
[57:56] right the first time brother Branham
[57:57] said is he gave us his word
[58:00] amen often times we need to go no
[58:02] further when I didn't agree with the
[58:05] pastor I didn't agree with the financial
[58:06] counselor I didn't agree with the
[58:08] marriage counselor I didn't agree with
[58:09] this I didn't agree with that my brother
[58:11] and sister oftentimes if we just go back
[58:13] to the word first amen we wouldn't have
[58:16] these problems but we skipped the word
[58:18] and we go out someone else's opinion oh
[58:22] my well I'm preaching to Paul today okay
[58:24] if that's all right amen now in the
[58:27] seven Church ages I I don't know this
[58:29] comes up here uh Brothers put a little
[58:31] note we'll have to this this screen is
[58:34] on the blink
[58:36] um literally
[58:38] um
[58:38] so you recall that I mentioned at the
[58:41] beginning of this message that this book
[58:43] that we are studying is the actual
[58:45] revelation of Jesus himself in the
[58:48] church and his work in the future ages
[58:50] then I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[58:52] Spirit to give us Revelation or we will
[58:55] fail to get it right this is a very uh
[58:58] We've read this quote so many times but
[59:00] it's relevant every single day of our
[59:04] life amen so it's if we don't if he
[59:06] doesn't give it to us amen then it's we
[59:09] we will fail to get it uh bringing these
[59:12] two thoughts together you will see that
[59:13] it won't take just ordinary study and
[59:16] thinking to make this book real now I'm
[59:18] going to just insert this real quick
[59:20] here a brother I won't mention his name
[59:22] but years ago he's probably one of the
[59:24] most simple preachers I've ever heard
[59:25] preach and he gone up and he just
[59:27] started preaching and he's there and he
[59:30] says now over here and he reads a quote
[59:33] and then he only makes a couple comments
[59:36] and he said and hear and he reads a
[59:38] quote
[59:39] and he did this for about an hour
[59:42] and you're thinking okay brother you're
[59:44] on quote number 42.
[59:47] but I'll tell you what happened because
[59:49] God led him to put that in a certain
[59:51] order and God led him in the fashion to
[59:54] bring that at the end of the service the
[59:56] Holy Spirit fell down so strong and
[59:58] moved so strong amongst the people
[1:00:00] because you see God wasn't there saying
[1:00:03] he's a perfect preacher God was there
[1:00:06] saying my words been given to the people
[1:00:08] and I'm going to honor my word
[1:00:11] amen we get so caught up in the
[1:00:13] eloquence and the way that men can put
[1:00:15] things together and put personality into
[1:00:18] it my brother and sister are God's
[1:00:20] pleased when he hears his word spoken
[1:00:23] back to him
[1:00:24] that's what he wants to hear is his word
[1:00:27] spoken back to him Lord help us each one
[1:00:30] to speak the word amen not our negative
[1:00:33] thoughts not our negative ideas not the
[1:00:35] negative of life but the word let that
[1:00:37] be the word that comes back and God
[1:00:39] forgive us for our negatism amen so you
[1:00:42] look at this see amen it comes together
[1:00:45] see it won't take ordinary study and
[1:00:46] thinking to make this book real it's
[1:00:48] going to take the operation of the Holy
[1:00:50] Ghost that means this book can't be
[1:00:52] revealed to anyone but a special class
[1:00:55] of people amen I want you today to just
[1:00:58] you don't have to say it out loud but I
[1:01:00] would like you to think in your heart I
[1:01:03] am a special class of people amen maybe
[1:01:06] we could say it out loud I am a special
[1:01:10] class of people amen and to believe that
[1:01:14] and realize that God didn't just throw
[1:01:16] this out to be picked up as it were on
[1:01:18] litter on the side of the road but God
[1:01:20] said I know who I'm going to put my word
[1:01:23] in and I know I'm how to activate that
[1:01:26] word and I know how to bring it to pass
[1:01:28] and I say thank you Lord for that it
[1:01:31] will take one with a prophetic Insight
[1:01:33] now my brother and sister I don't mean
[1:01:35] to speak any words no political points
[1:01:37] here but the prophet of God in this if
[1:01:40] you follow the context he's talking
[1:01:42] about who prophets no people
[1:01:46] so he is declaring that the people not
[1:01:50] just the prophet for the age a messenger
[1:01:52] for the age amen that angel to the age
[1:01:55] it's not just him that's going to have
[1:01:57] prophetic Insight it's the people of
[1:02:00] that age that God has called are going
[1:02:02] to have prophetic insight to see what a
[1:02:05] prophet projected
[1:02:07] amen because if it's projected and we
[1:02:10] can't see it then it won't do us any
[1:02:12] good so the people themselves as the
[1:02:15] prophet of God says now you know read
[1:02:17] between the lines there's people that
[1:02:19] are opposed to the idea of commoners
[1:02:23] reading between the lines but my prophet
[1:02:26] in the books that I have read the tapes
[1:02:28] I have heard told me read between the
[1:02:31] lines and so it is a prophetic Insight
[1:02:34] you say well that's no big deal no I'm
[1:02:35] telling you it is
[1:02:37] for you to be able to read between the
[1:02:39] lines is actually prophetic insight to
[1:02:42] catch that portion that was spoken my
[1:02:45] brother and sister brother Brown's
[1:02:47] talking about as it come with the first
[1:02:49] second third pull and how the fishing
[1:02:51] line got tangled up and all of that
[1:02:53] stuff and God's dealing with him and
[1:02:55] that comes about because God told
[1:02:57] Brother Branham do not tell this to the
[1:02:59] public but brother random so wanting to
[1:03:02] help the people that he lays this out
[1:03:04] and it's there that we see now he's
[1:03:07] telling the story of the dream and how
[1:03:09] the fishing line gets Tangled Up and
[1:03:11] people are there like well I don't get
[1:03:13] it well I'll tell you what the bride of
[1:03:15] Christ gets it amen when we as humans
[1:03:17] start meddling into the word of God out
[1:03:19] of time and out of place and season then
[1:03:22] the line is going to get tangled up that
[1:03:24] doesn't mean the line is completely
[1:03:26] destroyed it doesn't mean you'll never
[1:03:28] catch another fish but my brother and
[1:03:30] sister we as a church we as a body of
[1:03:32] Believers want to be in step with the
[1:03:35] revealed word of the hour I can't make
[1:03:38] it happen you can't make it happen but
[1:03:41] we are a part of The Happening amen we
[1:03:44] are a part of the fulfilling of the word
[1:03:46] amen so this special class of people
[1:03:48] it'll take prophetic Insight it will
[1:03:51] require the ability to hear from God now
[1:03:54] my brother and sister there's many
[1:03:56] people on the Earth today that are
[1:03:58] saying well God spoke to me God spoke to
[1:04:00] me God spoke to me you know in the
[1:04:03] position of a pastor and different
[1:04:04] things you hear this all the time not
[1:04:07] just you know in the local realm you
[1:04:09] might say but different things in
[1:04:11] interacting with people and then you
[1:04:13] give them six months or a year and they
[1:04:16] are going directly counter to the very
[1:04:18] thing they said God spoke to me now my
[1:04:21] brother and sister the prophet of God
[1:04:22] ask us does God change his mind
[1:04:25] no so what's happening is is someone
[1:04:28] believed in what they thought so
[1:04:31] strongly they were sure we're not
[1:04:33] calling them liars deceivers or whatever
[1:04:35] but they believed in that thought so
[1:04:38] strongly they were sure it had to come
[1:04:40] from God well the prophet of God said
[1:04:42] I've got a cure for that one too go
[1:04:44] ahead and run it through this filter
[1:04:46] and if it'll fit through this filter
[1:04:48] then it's me speaking but if it won't go
[1:04:51] through the filter be man enough be
[1:04:53] woman enough to sit down and say that
[1:04:55] was my thought
[1:04:57] that was my idea that was my opinion
[1:05:00] because you see my brother and sister
[1:05:02] there's nothing more embarrassing as it
[1:05:05] is in the natural let me put it just
[1:05:07] into a natural basis there's nothing
[1:05:09] more embarrassing than being so certain
[1:05:13] that you have the answer and being quite
[1:05:17] vocal about the answer
[1:05:20] to be proven wrong
[1:05:22] are you with me
[1:05:25] oh no it's this percentage have your
[1:05:28] grandchild
[1:05:37] well
[1:05:41] don't believe everything on the internet
[1:05:45] especially if it proves you wrong
[1:05:47] no no sometimes we have to come to a
[1:05:50] reality
[1:05:52] that we get certain things
[1:05:54] in our mind
[1:05:57] hmm
[1:06:01] well
[1:06:02] should we move on or should we stay here
[1:06:06] just elect lady
[1:06:07] now as I have belabored this just a
[1:06:10] little bit I want you to realize my
[1:06:12] brother and sister when John was
[1:06:13] speaking to you and I and that's what he
[1:06:15] was doing he was speaking to you and I
[1:06:18] as he's speaking to us he really if he
[1:06:21] was standing here today would want to
[1:06:23] drive home to you the very fact that
[1:06:26] Satan will do everything he can do and
[1:06:28] we see it in the world we live in and
[1:06:30] I'm sorry I'll touch on the culture for
[1:06:32] a minute I don't mean to it's not our
[1:06:34] worry it's not our labor but my brother
[1:06:36] and sister what it is we see out here in
[1:06:39] the world today we can mock them and we
[1:06:43] can do all kinds of things but that's
[1:06:44] not right because what we're doing is
[1:06:46] seeing where the word declared that they
[1:06:49] would not know their right hand from
[1:06:50] their left they would not know up from
[1:06:52] down it would be chaos and confusion and
[1:06:56] their identity would be lost now my
[1:06:59] brother and sister as Israel had lost
[1:07:01] its identity for Generations you'll
[1:07:04] notice that right now her identity is
[1:07:06] coming back in bits and pieces coming
[1:07:09] back to her she's starting to recognize
[1:07:11] there are those within Israel even right
[1:07:15] now that are having a uh what we would
[1:07:18] consider a prophetic insight to the
[1:07:20] hundred and forty four thousand they're
[1:07:22] realizing that all these people that
[1:07:24] have come back into the land of Israel
[1:07:27] that have thy blood in them are not
[1:07:30] God's chosen now my brother and sister
[1:07:32] that culturally is not an accepted thing
[1:07:34] no more than you sitting here this
[1:07:37] morning and saying we are the Bride of
[1:07:39] Jesus Christ will the nominal World want
[1:07:42] to accept that they're going to say who
[1:07:44] do you think you are but my brother and
[1:07:46] sister it's not you when I sing that
[1:07:49] we're that it's the word that has come
[1:07:51] to us and been embedded in our heart to
[1:07:54] say that's the word and I identify with
[1:07:58] this and it's not going to be that we
[1:08:00] simply just go to church and go home and
[1:08:03] count our duty for the day but it is an
[1:08:05] act direct uh uh you might say uh um oh
[1:08:10] my how am I going to say this it's an
[1:08:12] absolute direct connection to God to
[1:08:16] come into the house of God and worship
[1:08:18] him now it doesn't mean nobody worships
[1:08:20] if they're out of the house of God but
[1:08:22] there is something that means something
[1:08:24] to the bride of Christ to come and
[1:08:26] fulfill every portion of the word now
[1:08:29] not everybody wants to do that they come
[1:08:30] out of obligation they come out of you
[1:08:33] know thinking they'll be judged or
[1:08:34] looked down on if they don't come to the
[1:08:36] house of God my brother and sister my
[1:08:38] Bible tells me that as I see that day
[1:08:40] approaching I should be in the house of
[1:08:42] God and so something stirs in me I don't
[1:08:45] say well if I don't do that I must not
[1:08:47] be a believer no I'm telling you
[1:08:49] something stirs in my heart I want to be
[1:08:51] in the house of God Amen now you know
[1:08:54] sometimes our old flesh we get tired we
[1:08:56] get a little discouraged we get whatever
[1:08:58] the devil tells us well it doesn't
[1:09:00] matter but my brother and sister I tell
[1:09:02] you drink another cup of coffee come to
[1:09:05] the house of God jump up and down a
[1:09:07] little bit get the Jitters out go home
[1:09:09] you'll be blessed
[1:09:11] amen
[1:09:13] so we look at this elect is carefully
[1:09:17] selected or chosen
[1:09:20] so this carefully or selected lady
[1:09:24] now my brother and sister his brother
[1:09:25] Branham talks about this I'm just going
[1:09:27] to elaborate it on a little stronger
[1:09:28] sense any man that would go out here
[1:09:31] just go down to the shopping mall or go
[1:09:33] wherever and just go down the sidewalk
[1:09:35] and the first available young lady he'd
[1:09:38] just say marry me that man is deceived
[1:09:42] he is in a delusion
[1:09:44] that's not how it works that's not what
[1:09:46] you should do
[1:09:48] and God didn't just go through you might
[1:09:51] say Time and Eternity and see the sea
[1:09:54] Gene of humanity and just say I'll take
[1:09:56] this one and I'll take that one and I'll
[1:09:58] call this one a wife and I'll call that
[1:10:00] one a bride no sir God looked down and
[1:10:02] he said I see a seed Gene I see
[1:10:05] something that is there I see something
[1:10:07] what am I doing I'm seeing they will
[1:10:10] believe because it's already in them God
[1:10:13] didn't have to come and poke the seed
[1:10:15] into you the seed was born in you amen
[1:10:19] from the very mind of God in the
[1:10:21] beginning amen and so is it there we
[1:10:24] realize you've been carefully selected
[1:10:27] Hitler tried to do it
[1:10:29] and that old Aryan Spirit still out
[1:10:32] there trying to do it
[1:10:34] the whole deal of any color
[1:10:37] that's kind of trying to say we're the
[1:10:40] master of the race
[1:10:42] my brother and sister I'm not talking
[1:10:44] about from race to race I'm talking
[1:10:46] about within a race saying we're the
[1:10:48] master of the race we are the perfect of
[1:10:50] this we are no my brother and sister and
[1:10:52] it doesn't work in the church to come
[1:10:54] down and say well our church has it
[1:10:56] nobody else does I'm more spiritual than
[1:10:58] them God's going to deal with me my
[1:11:00] brother and sister God deals with
[1:11:01] ignorant unlearned people he deals with
[1:11:04] people that got dirt behind their ears
[1:11:07] amen look through the ages God chooses
[1:11:10] who he did and the seed was there and
[1:11:13] when the star appeared God had Shepherds
[1:11:16] my brother and sister that stunk like
[1:11:19] sheep and they saw
[1:11:22] hmm thank you Lord but so did the Magi
[1:11:26] who were actually very rich traitors
[1:11:30] but God knew
[1:11:32] and God selected
[1:11:34] and God knew that they would be the
[1:11:37] elect lady
[1:11:39] now brother Branham shows us love
[1:11:41] projected
[1:11:42] so we'll look in this you know John's
[1:11:44] speaking that he loves
[1:11:46] he loves these people this
[1:11:49] that love the truth that have the truth
[1:11:51] he loves them now I want you to catch
[1:11:54] this how we would look at this today and
[1:11:56] brother Branham shows us love projected
[1:11:58] and just as I was sharing that this
[1:12:00] brother spoke that a lot of problems
[1:12:02] would be fixed around the message if we
[1:12:04] would just drop down all the high Mighty
[1:12:06] ideas and just actually love people and
[1:12:09] when you see them make a mistake amen do
[1:12:12] any of you know of things in this church
[1:12:14] you disagree with hmm
[1:12:18] well
[1:12:19] that makes me feel good there must not
[1:12:21] be one problem
[1:12:23] in this church
[1:12:26] come on be honest Saints
[1:12:28] but what we what do we do
[1:12:33] we don't go over here with a pile of
[1:12:34] wood in the parking lot time to a post
[1:12:37] throw gasoline on them and flip matches
[1:12:39] at them and decide if the fire takes off
[1:12:42] it was God's will they burn up
[1:12:46] oh no they did things crazy like that in
[1:12:48] the in days gone by
[1:12:50] put people in the middle of a wood pile
[1:12:52] and then shoot flaming arrows and if it
[1:12:54] goes up in Flames that was God's
[1:12:55] judgment if it doesn't it was God's
[1:12:57] grace craziness
[1:12:59] God called you and I to judge each other
[1:13:02] by the word but the more grace that has
[1:13:04] come to us hear me now the more grace
[1:13:07] that has come to us the more grace we
[1:13:10] are supposed to extend
[1:13:13] so as we recognize how Fallen that we
[1:13:17] were to realize that whatever might be a
[1:13:20] shortcoming in someone's life that our
[1:13:22] job is not to judge them our job is to
[1:13:25] lift them up amen let's be the muskox of
[1:13:28] the message amen when one is hurt and
[1:13:31] wounded let's get around them amen and
[1:13:35] let's put our horns as it were out
[1:13:36] against the enemy and dare them to come
[1:13:39] and take our weak or sickly
[1:13:42] but instead
[1:13:45] more like the wildebeest
[1:13:49] we've witnessed this
[1:13:52] drive up
[1:13:54] literally walked a wildebeest baby
[1:13:57] bounce off the ground
[1:13:59] just been born
[1:14:02] sat there take a picture or two Marvel
[1:14:05] thousands upon thousands of wildebeests
[1:14:08] here
[1:14:10] Marvel wow we got to witness this
[1:14:15] and then we went on to look a little
[1:14:17] something looked turned around and come
[1:14:19] back my brother and sister that little
[1:14:21] wildebeest wasn't laying there on the
[1:14:22] ground
[1:14:23] God gave that little will to Beast an
[1:14:26] ability to rise up in its infancy
[1:14:30] and a family you might say of of God
[1:14:33] Amen this wildebeest family
[1:14:36] they didn't go Galloping off my brother
[1:14:37] and sister but that little guy got up
[1:14:40] and was able to stay in the body
[1:14:45] and we couldn't find him anywhere
[1:14:48] we saw the herd moving
[1:14:50] and we look there's no stragglers
[1:14:51] there's no nothing
[1:14:53] God help us we also saw a little zebra
[1:14:56] didn't actually literally see the little
[1:14:58] guy born but just all the slobbers of
[1:15:01] birth is hanging off this little guy we
[1:15:04] come driving up there brother Gideon
[1:15:06] pulls us up there and we're like he's
[1:15:08] like that's newborn like we just missed
[1:15:10] its Birth by just that much and you know
[1:15:13] what happened every Mama zebra come and
[1:15:18] we're there in the van maybe here to the
[1:15:21] back of the church or back of the
[1:15:22] sanctuary as all the farther away we are
[1:15:25] and every Mama zebra come and stood
[1:15:29] where we couldn't see this little baby
[1:15:32] we pull forward they literally
[1:15:36] doing some calculus a little geometry
[1:15:39] angle projection visual move forward
[1:15:43] you can't see
[1:15:46] something in nature
[1:15:47] God help us as a bride of Christ
[1:15:50] help us that we will protect the little
[1:15:54] ones the newborn whatever it might be
[1:15:57] the weak in our body amen as we would
[1:16:01] project and put ourselves but brother
[1:16:03] Branham here now is showing us love
[1:16:05] projected and God uses a bull
[1:16:08] now that's the last thing in the world
[1:16:10] we would think that God would need to do
[1:16:12] to use to give love projected but my
[1:16:16] brother and sister we've got to
[1:16:17] understand I love this story because the
[1:16:19] prophet's first reaction you see God put
[1:16:21] him in a corner has God ever put you in
[1:16:23] a corner amen I have God hasn't and just
[1:16:26] look forward to it because he'll use the
[1:16:28] corner sometimes to deal with us so what
[1:16:30] is it brother Branham comes there and
[1:16:32] the bull gets up and his first reaction
[1:16:34] is to reach for that gun it's going to
[1:16:36] defend himself there's no gun oh my you
[1:16:40] know the thought had to go through his
[1:16:42] mind turn and run like you have never
[1:16:44] run since you were a child
[1:16:47] but there was also something there
[1:16:50] just says bull
[1:16:52] I'm sorry
[1:16:54] I'm in your house I'm in your pasture
[1:16:56] I'm I'm
[1:16:58] the one that's distracting you
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:12] I think we need some maturing
[1:17:22] I think we need some maturing Church
[1:17:28] we get upset at people if they don't
[1:17:31] hold the door for us
[1:17:36] we get upset when people do things that
[1:17:39] we think is just completely contrary to
[1:17:42] Common Sense
[1:17:44] we get upset over over human behaviors
[1:17:51] could I challenge us
[1:17:54] would it be all right if I challenged us
[1:17:55] this morning
[1:17:58] let our first inspect Instinct be
[1:18:01] project love
[1:18:15] not throw a curse on the ball that he'd
[1:18:17] get struck down Angel come with a sword
[1:18:19] and Pierce The Bully die right there on
[1:18:21] the scene too no sir the prophet of God
[1:18:24] stepped right over into a realm
[1:18:27] and said I'm sorry
[1:18:29] and if that wasn't enough God comes
[1:18:31] along with some Hornets
[1:18:33] see it was you could say that's a
[1:18:35] one-time occurrence my brother and
[1:18:36] sister I think I'd be more afraid of the
[1:18:38] Hornets than the bull actually
[1:18:43] and the prophet of God then speaks to
[1:18:45] the Hornets
[1:18:47] and they circle around and they go right
[1:18:49] back into their nest now I don't know
[1:18:51] how much experience you guys have with
[1:18:53] Hornets I have never ever in my life
[1:18:56] seen a hornet that listened
[1:19:01] and the more you swing your arms the
[1:19:04] Madder they get
[1:19:05] but they were already had an attitude
[1:19:07] and were mad before you started swinging
[1:19:10] your arms and running
[1:19:12] and a prophet of God projects love to
[1:19:14] them and says I'm sorry
[1:19:17] you know what our response would be we
[1:19:19] would run bat our hands and fast we
[1:19:21] could get in the house amen kill the
[1:19:24] chain the ones that chased us in there
[1:19:26] and we come out armed with raid in both
[1:19:28] hands
[1:19:30] I'll teach you guys a lesson
[1:19:33] but the prophet of God says I'm sorry
[1:19:36] I Disturbed you
[1:19:39] and the presence of God was strong
[1:19:41] enough my brother and sister that those
[1:19:44] Hornets responded the presence of God
[1:19:46] was there why are they before the fall
[1:19:49] they were creatures that might have
[1:19:51] landed on your hand and wiggled their
[1:19:54] little antenna at you as they did their
[1:19:56] you know pollen and whatever else they
[1:19:58] do my brother and sister they didn't
[1:20:00] look at you as something to take a bite
[1:20:02] out of and so what did happen is God
[1:20:05] took those Hornets right back before the
[1:20:08] fall and they recognized that presence
[1:20:11] of almighty God God the Holy Ghost was
[1:20:14] in their midst and it changed them
[1:20:18] are you with me
[1:20:20] amen and God is in our presence and it
[1:20:24] should be changing us
[1:20:31] yeah
[1:20:33] the human reaction
[1:20:35] you know that falls on a lot of things
[1:20:37] in our life come on Saints I'm not
[1:20:39] preaching I'm not preaching to a bunch
[1:20:40] of saints but I'm preaching to Saints
[1:20:42] this morning amen the human reaction is
[1:20:45] the reaction we have to deal with
[1:20:47] sometimes someone can do you completely
[1:20:50] wrong and it's not about them but it's
[1:20:53] about how we react to it and God wants
[1:20:56] you and I he'll deal with them amen but
[1:20:59] what did we do are we going to justify
[1:21:01] our world of anger and and anxieties by
[1:21:04] what they did no that isn't what God
[1:21:07] called God said I want you to respond I
[1:21:10] want you to do the right thing I want to
[1:21:13] be manifested in you
[1:21:15] oh Hallelujah my brothers and sisters
[1:21:18] when God gives you a thought sometimes
[1:21:19] things just prove to come and know
[1:21:21] you're on the right track amen you know
[1:21:24] the biggest thing is is the reason I
[1:21:26] behave like I did is because you behaved
[1:21:28] like you did
[1:21:29] go tell Saint Peter that at the gate
[1:21:33] yeah
[1:21:34] I rented I raved I slobbered I shouted
[1:21:38] stomped screamed
[1:21:40] but it wasn't my fault
[1:21:43] no it is you're the elect lady
[1:21:46] you're the one that God has projected
[1:21:48] love into you're the one that God has
[1:21:51] revealed himself into well Jesus braided
[1:21:54] the cord and chased him out of the
[1:21:55] temple come on find a better excuse
[1:21:58] amen
[1:22:01] you know what backed up Jesus Behavior
[1:22:03] there
[1:22:04] judgment begins at the house of God
[1:22:09] so
[1:22:10] my brother and sister I want you to
[1:22:12] understand this see in verse 4 he says I
[1:22:14] Rejoice greatly that I found of thy
[1:22:16] children Walking In Truth amen so as we
[1:22:19] go back and kind of connect to Wednesday
[1:22:21] night you look at them now them lepers
[1:22:23] are sitting outside of the gates and my
[1:22:26] brother and sister life is pretty tough
[1:22:28] there's a famine in the land that is
[1:22:30] imposed by being surrounded by a
[1:22:32] conquering Army and they are sitting
[1:22:34] there in the gate and they realize we go
[1:22:36] in the city we're going to die of hunger
[1:22:38] there and if we sit right here we're
[1:22:40] going to die of hunger what have I got
[1:22:42] to lose by just simply walking now it
[1:22:44] looks like I'm walking down into the
[1:22:46] midst of the enemy my brother and sister
[1:22:48] when God placed a bride in laodicea
[1:22:51] 2023 a prophet of God thought we would
[1:22:54] be gone by now but God In His Infinite
[1:22:57] Wisdom says no you have not come to the
[1:23:01] fullness of the camp of the syrians yet
[1:23:03] for a complete deliverance and so what
[1:23:06] I'm going to do is you won't sit here
[1:23:08] and starve in the city you're not going
[1:23:10] to say out there I'm going to anoint you
[1:23:12] to get up and I want you to start
[1:23:14] walking and that is exactly what we're
[1:23:16] doing today Saints we are walking here
[1:23:18] in this age called laodicea and God has
[1:23:21] a great feast a great banquet for the
[1:23:24] bride of Christ at the end of this walk
[1:23:26] amen but if you don't ever make it to
[1:23:28] the camp of the syrians you're never
[1:23:30] going to feast and never going to as I
[1:23:33] joked the other night be able to fill
[1:23:35] out your 401K with their gold and silver
[1:23:39] you gotta walk you got to get to the
[1:23:41] camp you got to be part of this to
[1:23:42] fulfill the scripture someone had to but
[1:23:45] God annoyed to them I didn't go there
[1:23:46] Wednesday night God anointed them to go
[1:23:49] back and tell the king and the King's
[1:23:51] house which means the people that there
[1:23:53] is a great feast here and whether people
[1:23:56] come right the man who was scoffing the
[1:23:59] man who said all as God would open the
[1:24:01] windows of Heaven Was trampled in the
[1:24:03] gate of the city
[1:24:05] some will never see it some are caught
[1:24:07] up ran over by the things of this world
[1:24:09] they are that seed that was planted in
[1:24:12] the thorns and the thistles and were
[1:24:14] consumed and covered up and choked out
[1:24:16] my brother and sister but God called you
[1:24:18] and I walk come on are we going to walk
[1:24:20] or not we're not going to sit down and
[1:24:23] just say hey look you know this is
[1:24:25] what's happening and we don't know why
[1:24:27] God hasn't had a Rapture maybe maybe I'm
[1:24:29] the one
[1:24:31] go ahead and say that to yourself
[1:24:33] amen we want this to be not uh exclusive
[1:24:37] but inclusive
[1:24:38] I might be the one that God is waiting
[1:24:41] for but don't get angry with yourself
[1:24:43] Rejoice that God cares enough to wait
[1:24:45] for you yeah
[1:24:50] thank you Lord
[1:24:52] so you're anointed
[1:24:54] walking the truth
[1:24:56] amen if God wants you to just be
[1:24:58] religious you'd just be religious
[1:25:01] I want you to think about that
[1:25:03] what it is to be religious do you guys
[1:25:05] any of you know people who are just what
[1:25:07] you might call Super or hyper religious
[1:25:09] I happen to know people
[1:25:11] they're hyper religious
[1:25:14] they lie cheat steal curse
[1:25:18] Smoke Drink dance
[1:25:23] everything
[1:25:26] have gravel delivered in their driveway
[1:25:28] and walk out there and there's a
[1:25:30] pyramid-shaped stone in their driveway
[1:25:33] oh
[1:25:35] this was all about not the fact we had
[1:25:37] you know eight inch deep mud hole in our
[1:25:40] driveway this is about God delivering
[1:25:42] this this pyramid-shaped rock to my
[1:25:45] house
[1:25:49] they'd pick your pocket
[1:25:51] lie to you while they do it
[1:25:53] but they can turn that stone
[1:25:56] into something super spiritual
[1:25:58] God wanted you to be religious you'd be
[1:26:01] religious God wants you to be his elect
[1:26:04] lady
[1:26:05] and he is forming Us by the word
[1:26:08] forming Us by our trials and our
[1:26:10] struggles forming Us by fire to be the
[1:26:14] elect lady not super religious not super
[1:26:17] spiritual although that's just fine if
[1:26:19] God's given you an understanding of the
[1:26:21] word in that fashion I'm not speaking
[1:26:23] against that but that's not our evidence
[1:26:26] by brother and sister the prophet of God
[1:26:28] said he gave us the best first and that
[1:26:30] was the word
[1:26:31] let the word be our Guiding Light amen
[1:26:34] now look he's give us his revealed word
[1:26:37] it's come alive the select lady knows
[1:26:39] what God wants amen Esther
[1:26:42] she knew exactly how to catch the king's
[1:26:45] attention when she was dealing
[1:26:47] amen when she needed things to happen
[1:26:50] she knew how to catch the king's
[1:26:52] attention amen she didn't like the
[1:26:54] curtains in the palace on fire
[1:26:56] right she welcomed him into her presence
[1:27:00] and he was happy to be there because he
[1:27:02] was in love with her he loved her voice
[1:27:05] he loved who she was he loved everything
[1:27:07] about her then she knew it God help us
[1:27:10] to know God how much God loves us
[1:27:13] amen now look at this
[1:27:16] as uh verse 4 and they're walking in
[1:27:19] truth
[1:27:20] and five
[1:27:22] and I beseech thee lady not as though I
[1:27:24] wrote a new commandment unto thee but
[1:27:27] that which had from the beginning that
[1:27:30] we love one another
[1:27:32] see the word of God puts that
[1:27:34] significance on there and the prophet
[1:27:36] put that significance on there I think
[1:27:38] it must mean something I think God wants
[1:27:41] an emphasis for you and I now you guys
[1:27:44] know I'm just who I am the youngest
[1:27:46] child my wife says I was spoiled rotten
[1:27:48] that's why I am how I am amen just
[1:27:51] jokingly amen but you look at this my
[1:27:54] brother and sister there's always been
[1:27:56] something in me since I was a little kid
[1:27:57] I know it probably makes some of you
[1:27:59] nervous when I look you in the face and
[1:28:00] say I love you uh I'm sorry that's who
[1:28:03] I've been since I was just a little guy
[1:28:06] it's just I I that's a place of
[1:28:09] inhibition you might say to me and I see
[1:28:11] people's reaction to that they kind of
[1:28:13] pull back a little like whoa this guy's
[1:28:15] getting intimate here but I want you to
[1:28:17] know my brother and sister that that
[1:28:19] comes from deep inside me not a not a
[1:28:23] human element but something inside of me
[1:28:25] I love God's people I love to be able to
[1:28:30] fellowship and interact and be connected
[1:28:32] two and it's there in that place and I
[1:28:35] believe I use that not speaking of
[1:28:37] myself but use that that God's moving in
[1:28:39] you and I to have such a deep rooted
[1:28:43] love for one another it's not a love of
[1:28:46] lust it's not a love of Flesh it's not a
[1:28:49] love of these things but a deep rooted
[1:28:51] love that had to come from the Throne of
[1:28:54] almighty God that's what he's calling us
[1:28:56] to that we can look at one another in
[1:28:59] the right way to word it in the right
[1:29:01] way not sensual not of the world not of
[1:29:04] those things but from the heart and it's
[1:29:06] obvious it came from the heart I love
[1:29:08] you
[1:29:09] and we can speak that to one another and
[1:29:12] that is only the love of God coming down
[1:29:13] and touching Our Lives
[1:29:15] Hallelujah
[1:29:17] Hallelujah
[1:29:19] amen
[1:29:21] in First Peter 4 8 9 it says above all
[1:29:25] things have fervent charity which is
[1:29:27] love
[1:29:28] kindness among yourselves for charity
[1:29:31] shall cover multitude of sins use
[1:29:33] Hospitality one to another without
[1:29:36] grudging
[1:29:37] you know my brother and sister it is it
[1:29:40] is a difficult day that we live in at a
[1:29:43] time when Satan would come and
[1:29:46] one of the worst things we can do
[1:29:48] whether it's in friendships or let me
[1:29:50] put marriage first whether it's in
[1:29:52] marriage or French hints is to keep
[1:29:55] score
[1:29:59] wow
[1:30:01] somebody just pulled poured cold water
[1:30:04] all over the church
[1:30:07] if you find yourself keeping score
[1:30:09] go repent
[1:30:12] right
[1:30:14] we're supposed to put our sins on the
[1:30:16] altar every day
[1:30:18] let us be so anointed to put those of
[1:30:21] others that have been against us you
[1:30:24] might say those things that have been
[1:30:25] harsh and difficult to deal with if
[1:30:27] you'll lay that on the altar every
[1:30:30] single day you will find such a liberty
[1:30:33] and then when you do that you'll be able
[1:30:35] to have mercy for that person not
[1:30:37] judgment for them but mercy and I'll
[1:30:40] tell you what that'll be some of the
[1:30:41] best marriage counseling you'll ever
[1:30:43] hear is when you come to the place that
[1:30:45] whatever your husband or wife has done
[1:30:47] that you can take and just put that on
[1:30:49] the Altar and say Lord I know they
[1:30:51] didn't mean it I know that's not who
[1:30:53] they are I know that's not your will or
[1:30:56] your desire Lord I'm going to lay that
[1:30:58] down I'm not going to let the devil
[1:31:00] anoint it I'll tell you how that turns
[1:31:02] out if you allow the devil to anoint it
[1:31:04] anybody ever burnt yourself
[1:31:07] now anybody ever cut yourself
[1:31:10] now what happens in the week following
[1:31:12] getting burnt or cutting
[1:31:15] you know you get a sunburn you go to
[1:31:17] church you're you're maybe out there you
[1:31:19] know in a a t-shirt with short sleeves
[1:31:21] mowing the yard and a Saturday and and
[1:31:25] you're just like toasted and then you go
[1:31:27] to church and every single brother in
[1:31:30] the church will come up and hit you on
[1:31:32] the shoulder and say God bless you
[1:31:34] brother amen you burn your hand
[1:31:37] everybody in the church will want to
[1:31:40] shake your hand that day and before it's
[1:31:43] all done it's an irritation and I tell
[1:31:45] you when you don't forgive brothers and
[1:31:48] sisters and family husbands wives
[1:31:50] Etc the devil will come and he'll keep
[1:31:54] slapping that until you're so irritated
[1:31:56] you're angry
[1:31:58] but if you'll lay that on the Altar and
[1:32:01] the devil will come a slopping he'll
[1:32:03] come around remember remember and if you
[1:32:05] can in all sincerity look him in the
[1:32:07] face and say what are you talking about
[1:32:09] amen my sins are in the sea of God
[1:32:12] forgetfulness and I've took and attached
[1:32:15] every offense and everything that would
[1:32:18] hinder my walk I attached it to that and
[1:32:21] sent it right down there to that seal
[1:32:24] amen and the devil will be like well it
[1:32:27] won't do any good to try and irritate
[1:32:28] these people
[1:32:30] why because love projected
[1:32:33] oh God help us
[1:32:35] help us
[1:32:36] Amen in life's story brother Branham
[1:32:40] says and we each have a life that God
[1:32:42] has given us can we say amen and we must
[1:32:46] live it and I'm saying actually thank
[1:32:48] you very much Lord because if I had been
[1:32:51] given a different life
[1:32:53] you know my brother and sister I won't
[1:32:55] go into it to elaborate but within my
[1:32:58] family history
[1:33:00] there's
[1:33:01] quite interesting stories we'll just
[1:33:03] leave it at that
[1:33:07] very interesting stories
[1:33:12] but they took Holy Communion at
[1:33:13] Christmas two years ago
[1:33:16] and all is well
[1:33:19] but you see when God revealed the truth
[1:33:22] when he opened the book when he poured
[1:33:25] out Revelation to a special class of
[1:33:28] people we realize that's not who I was
[1:33:31] in the beginning God never held that to
[1:33:33] my account I had never committed it in
[1:33:36] the first place but I have a desire
[1:33:39] because he took and wrote that on the
[1:33:41] fleshly table of my heart I have no
[1:33:44] desire to sin and when I come short I
[1:33:47] can lay it before my father because I
[1:33:49] have an advocate before the father that
[1:33:52] will cover that for me
[1:33:54] amen it changes our perspective it's not
[1:33:57] about I can go take the Holy Eucharist I
[1:33:59] can go to confession I can do these
[1:34:01] things and take it away no I can go to
[1:34:04] my father amen I can go to my husband
[1:34:07] and he'll say yes
[1:34:09] yes I forgive you
[1:34:11] and you're Washed by the precious blood
[1:34:13] of Jesus
[1:34:16] to my humble opinion if you'll get this
[1:34:18] I think the most best life in the world
[1:34:21] now I'm taking that to say the very top
[1:34:24] of the top the most best
[1:34:26] amen
[1:34:28] no matter whether it's up or down if
[1:34:31] we'll find God's path and walk in it
[1:34:33] where God has ordained for us to walk
[1:34:36] you see there's no more miserable person
[1:34:38] than somebody who's walking out of the
[1:34:40] will of God
[1:34:41] a backslidden Christian
[1:34:45] is the most miserable person you'll ever
[1:34:48] meet because deep down inside
[1:34:52] they know
[1:34:55] they know
[1:35:03] God has ordained for us to walk if we
[1:35:05] always we find Victory no matter I think
[1:35:08] of blind Fanny Crosby when she was
[1:35:10] sitting there in the darkness and the
[1:35:12] question was once asked what do you
[1:35:14] think of Christ
[1:35:16] whose son is he
[1:35:19] do you know this story
[1:35:22] go look it up go read it
[1:35:25] I'll just put it in common words Fanny
[1:35:28] Crosby's answer
[1:35:30] was
[1:35:31] I'll give everything to him
[1:35:34] what he chooses
[1:35:35] to give back to me
[1:35:37] I accept
[1:35:40] hmm
[1:35:41] she had a relationship
[1:35:44] she had a revelation of that
[1:35:45] relationship
[1:35:47] my brother and sister she was blind
[1:35:50] maybe no hope to ever have sight she
[1:35:53] didn't care because she had Christ
[1:35:56] my
[1:35:58] my oh my
[1:36:00] you know a lot of facets to this is
[1:36:02] Brother George always says let us be
[1:36:04] balanced
[1:36:06] now
[1:36:07] I want you to look here
[1:36:09] this examining of ourselves my brother
[1:36:11] and sister it's not just a communion
[1:36:13] thing
[1:36:14] but it's literally how that we can walk
[1:36:16] into the word of God without a single
[1:36:20] hindrance in our life
[1:36:22] when we go through the examination
[1:36:24] process
[1:36:26] of ourself
[1:36:27] examining by the grace of God ourself
[1:36:31] that's when we have confidence in God
[1:36:34] that's when we walk in and we can look
[1:36:36] back and say you know what this old
[1:36:38] flesh man made mistakes but me as a Son
[1:36:40] of God me as a daughter of God I'm
[1:36:42] perfect before him
[1:36:44] I've been washed in the blood and that
[1:36:46] blood is powerful it didn't let a little
[1:36:49] bit get by behind my ear it didn't buy
[1:36:51] on my collar
[1:36:53] I'll tell you how it is my brother and
[1:36:54] sister I used to laugh at any kind of
[1:36:57] anywhere you might be or something and
[1:36:59] there'd be some commercial about our
[1:37:00] detergent will take the dirt out of the
[1:37:02] ring around the collar and I'll tell you
[1:37:04] what I would be like Jerry there's
[1:37:06] there's a detergent to take the ring out
[1:37:09] of the the caller of your work shirts
[1:37:12] and Jerry would just laugh and say Paul
[1:37:14] there is no detergent that will take the
[1:37:17] ring out of the collar of your work
[1:37:18] shirts because you see in the world I
[1:37:21] live in the world I work in the dirt and
[1:37:24] the grime amen those callers are so ring
[1:37:27] around the collar that there's no way
[1:37:30] you're going to get that dirt out my
[1:37:31] brother and sister but I'm telling you
[1:37:33] there's no ring around my heart that the
[1:37:36] blood of Jesus Christ cannot wash
[1:37:38] perfectly away
[1:37:40] and I say thank you Lord amen we might
[1:37:44] get a con accustomed to some things here
[1:37:46] in the natural but we should never
[1:37:48] become accustomed to that kind of stuff
[1:37:50] in the spiritual Hallelujah let me hurry
[1:37:53] on Amen now look at this these facets to
[1:37:57] examine ourselves in verse 8 he says
[1:37:59] look to yourselves that we lose not
[1:38:01] those things which we have wrought and
[1:38:03] the word rot there is there are several
[1:38:05] different things for but the simplest
[1:38:07] definition of that uh the things which
[1:38:09] we have wrought is those things which we
[1:38:11] have labored for
[1:38:13] we started out to serve the Lord many
[1:38:15] years ago and we're moving forward my
[1:38:18] brother and sister let's not let things
[1:38:20] come in our lives in our families in our
[1:38:23] church that would keep us from receiving
[1:38:26] the reward of what we have labored for
[1:38:29] but I'll guarantee you Satan's there 24
[1:38:31] hours a day pecking away trying to get
[1:38:34] us to come to a place that we're
[1:38:36] discouraged well I don't have any
[1:38:37] friends well find a friend in Jesus amen
[1:38:40] I'll tell you that's the that's the
[1:38:42] preacher's complaint every preacher I've
[1:38:45] ever talked to in a personal level will
[1:38:48] tell you don't have friends it doesn't
[1:38:50] work that way it's difficult it's hard
[1:38:52] and you know the prophet of God himself
[1:38:54] says I know so much about people that
[1:38:57] when I get in their presence I labor
[1:39:00] under that burden
[1:39:02] it must have been hard for the prophet
[1:39:04] to sit down with those Brothers on a you
[1:39:07] know a hunting trip or a fishing trip
[1:39:08] and maybe just there not even calling
[1:39:11] not Desiring but just seeing these
[1:39:14] things that are going on and how that
[1:39:16] must have drawn on him and I don't see
[1:39:19] that I have not not at that ability but
[1:39:22] you come to a place the things that even
[1:39:25] the Saints have said brother Paul pray
[1:39:27] for this and pray for that they become
[1:39:29] burdens to you and the thing is is no
[1:39:32] natural friend is going to relieve that
[1:39:34] burden
[1:39:35] I'll tell you what I made a mistake many
[1:39:37] years ago there was some situation that
[1:39:39] was just eating me up and I was sitting
[1:39:41] One Night in fellowship with a brother
[1:39:43] and I said well brother what do you
[1:39:44] think about this and my brother and
[1:39:46] sister when it was all done before it
[1:39:48] even got out totally out of my mouth I
[1:39:50] knew I had made a drastic mistake he
[1:39:52] looked like a deer in the headlights and
[1:39:54] I was like oh God forgive me
[1:39:58] doesn't make me special it just isn't
[1:40:00] that realm is there and it's hard to
[1:40:03] deal with but I'm telling you my brother
[1:40:04] and sister what we're doing is God has
[1:40:07] bringeth us to a place that we are
[1:40:09] laboring we are working for we are
[1:40:11] moving forward we are possessing this
[1:40:14] land and we're not called to look back
[1:40:16] of what happened in Egypt or what
[1:40:19] happened in the wilderness of sin or
[1:40:21] what happened when Moses struck the rock
[1:40:23] my brother and sister want to call to
[1:40:25] look at that we're called to look at the
[1:40:26] promised land and I'm not going to get
[1:40:28] there today but I'm telling you there's
[1:40:30] such incredible signs that we see my
[1:40:33] brother and sister of what God is doing
[1:40:35] but if we look back I can remember
[1:40:37] brother oh you know brother Trevor I I
[1:40:40] remember one time it was oh and and this
[1:40:43] and I remember I oh and I remember Anna
[1:40:46] and you would be the same way I remember
[1:40:48] the time brother Paul didn't necessarily
[1:40:50] treat me quite right and I my brother
[1:40:52] and sister what is it doing Satan's
[1:40:54] trying to erase what we have labored for
[1:40:57] we're not called look back we're called
[1:40:59] to put that under the blood of Jesus
[1:41:01] Christ and say Lord help my brother my
[1:41:04] brother's wrong help him Lord if I
[1:41:06] didn't receive it right help me Lord but
[1:41:09] to move forward claiming those things we
[1:41:11] have labored for
[1:41:13] Hallelujah
[1:41:15] amen
[1:41:17] now in Shalom brother Brown says
[1:41:19] changing the pages or changing calendars
[1:41:22] doesn't change time a lot of people say
[1:41:24] well the old Year's gone throw away the
[1:41:27] old December calendar now put up another
[1:41:29] one a new year and that's what New
[1:41:31] Year's means to them to me I want to see
[1:41:34] what's promised for the day I want to
[1:41:37] know what the light of the hour is so I
[1:41:40] can know how to walk in it can we say
[1:41:43] Amen this morning Lord I want to know
[1:41:46] how to walk in the word for my hour I
[1:41:49] don't need to worry about if God's going
[1:41:51] to take care of you you you or you I
[1:41:53] need to look and walk in the light God
[1:41:56] has given to me oh Hallelujah sorry I'm
[1:41:59] getting wound up amen so I know how I
[1:42:02] want to know where I'm living what age
[1:42:05] I'm in how far up the road am I and Paul
[1:42:10] said I could stand quoting and could
[1:42:12] stand quoting again forgetting those
[1:42:14] things which are in the past I now press
[1:42:16] to towards the mark the High Calling to
[1:42:20] the complete identification
[1:42:23] when all time will fade out into
[1:42:25] eternity when Jesus comes
[1:42:29] now I want to go back and revisit
[1:42:31] because I never really touched on it
[1:42:32] maybe this was the moment
[1:42:34] you know what's wrong with these young
[1:42:36] men and these young women
[1:42:38] young women wanting to be men and young
[1:42:40] men wanting to be women
[1:42:42] and all the strange
[1:42:45] things that we see
[1:42:48] if we're not careful we judge them in
[1:42:50] the flesh
[1:42:52] went into an auto parts store
[1:42:57] young men in there had them
[1:43:00] big
[1:43:01] Lifesavers gauges
[1:43:03] in his ears
[1:43:05] and the first thing when I saw that I
[1:43:09] was like great
[1:43:11] that's the clerk I'm going to get
[1:43:15] but when he spoke
[1:43:17] something spoke to me
[1:43:22] sir how can I help you
[1:43:26] this total
[1:43:28] presentation respectful
[1:43:31] helpful
[1:43:33] something spoke to me
[1:43:35] and said if we're not careful
[1:43:37] would judge them
[1:43:39] external
[1:43:43] our young adults young people
[1:43:46] what I spoke to you downstairs today
[1:43:49] comes from that
[1:43:51] we can judge the external
[1:43:54] but down deep in there
[1:43:56] be a son of God
[1:43:58] I need to treat him like a son of God
[1:44:02] I need to that if life would bring our
[1:44:06] Crossroads again
[1:44:08] I wouldn't have to go oh my goodness
[1:44:10] this is the young man that I was so rude
[1:44:12] derogatory to the one I told him he
[1:44:15] looked like a and blah blah oh
[1:44:19] no sir
[1:44:22] treat them
[1:44:23] to the potential
[1:44:28] that when we meet them again
[1:44:31] we'll be able with a clear conscience
[1:44:35] address them
[1:44:38] you see what's happened
[1:44:42] I've said it many times I'll say it
[1:44:43] again
[1:44:45] Sister Sarah if you would come
[1:44:47] musicians
[1:44:51] scripture clearly shows us an age of an
[1:44:53] identity crisis
[1:44:56] people will fill the churches like never
[1:44:59] before
[1:45:01] but their identity of why they're there
[1:45:03] is in crisis
[1:45:10] this comes back several years ago we're
[1:45:13] on a little drive with my son down in
[1:45:14] Phoenix
[1:45:16] we drove by this place and I said oh
[1:45:19] my
[1:45:20] here is three I think three soccer
[1:45:23] fields
[1:45:24] two or three or four outdoor basketball
[1:45:27] courts two or three tennis courts
[1:45:30] couple baseball diamonds
[1:45:32] and I said wow that's a pretty fancy
[1:45:34] High School
[1:45:36] my son was like Dad
[1:45:39] that's a church
[1:45:41] [Music]
[1:45:44] and I was like wow
[1:45:47] [Music]
[1:45:49] in the Arizona Church Baseball
[1:45:51] Conference they've been champions for 12
[1:45:54] years
[1:45:55] so if you're any good at baseball
[1:45:58] that's where you go to church
[1:46:01] [Music]
[1:46:06] got a sign up sheet for a baseball team
[1:46:09] we might be able to come up with half a
[1:46:11] team I don't know
[1:46:14] but is that why we go to church
[1:46:17] I'll tell you what we are
[1:46:19] in the Full Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:46:22] we're on the starting and the winning
[1:46:24] team
[1:46:26] because you see our identity is not in
[1:46:28] the flesh
[1:46:30] my son went on to share a story how he
[1:46:32] knows several people that went to church
[1:46:33] there
[1:46:34] one of them was a young man well on his
[1:46:37] way
[1:46:38] to um
[1:46:40] going to play professional baseball
[1:46:44] when he got in an accident of some kind
[1:46:46] damaged his leg and
[1:46:48] crippled him up basically he said you
[1:46:51] wouldn't hardly know he's crippled but
[1:46:52] at the level you have to do to to play
[1:46:55] at that uh his for life it ended
[1:46:58] right there
[1:47:00] he's on salary
[1:47:03] at the church
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:06] not as a youth pastor
[1:47:10] not as a minister
[1:47:12] not as a counselor
[1:47:14] but as a Sports Coordinator
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:20] now I want you to do your own homework
[1:47:22] or if you know
[1:47:23] what did the prophet of God say would be
[1:47:26] a sign
[1:47:27] of the church
[1:47:29] in the end
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:32] but
[1:47:34] got you all frowned in here we're having
[1:47:35] a good service and I just spoiled it
[1:47:38] what did the prophet of God say
[1:47:41] about the church in the end
[1:47:46] she
[1:47:48] would recognize who she
[1:47:52] is
[1:47:54] we're at the end Saints the bride is
[1:47:57] recognizing who she is amen let's just
[1:48:00] stand sing a song or two before we're
[1:48:02] dismissed

[1:48:16] Lord today

[1:48:19] quoting him there but I like as Paul
[1:48:21] said forgetting those things that are in
[1:48:22] the past forgetting those things behind

[1:48:28] Christ Jesus amen
[1:48:31] a win
