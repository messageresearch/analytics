those here in the building with us and those that are listening you know it's just a wonderful time when we realize what's happening in the world around us we can get all concerned about what is happening and we don't take these things lightly right we're not to tempt the Lord but you know I I'm just a last couple days here I just had a you might say a little health event you know and just woke up in the middle of the night with the chills and turns out I had a bit of a fever didn't feel good through that day and next day felt better and feeling just fine today and sister Geri and I was driving to church this morning and we was just discussing these things you know it's like how it would come upon you you know they say these virus starts with a little fever and this that and the other and how Satan you know he would just give you something and just expect you to to accept it but you know hit a little fun I was kind of preaching to sister Geri as we're driving to church this morning and I said look what this is now whatever little virus or bug comes upon you the body then fights against that and our body was designed to overcome the influence of whatever that bug was that was doing that God made us that way and and the thought struck me and I said and you know speaking to her I said you know this is what God designed also we were ordained I used that word our body was ordained to overcome these these viruses and these things and that's the body of believers that's the son or daughter of God this Satan would pour out these things and the Bride of Christ is ordained to overcome it now you know it might not hurt us if we'd have a spiritual fever in other words get hot on fire for God let our let our fever rise up and just say you know what I'm overcoming this whatever it might be I'm going to overcome this because I was ordained to do that amen and you know I just lovely time to serve the Lord because as we see everything upon us you know we can cry we can cry we can cry but some time or another the prophet of God preached that why cry speak and we just want to speak the word I just want to encourage everyone to just kind of watch the website for some you know announcements that were proud becoming the state is adjusting its guidelines and we will be talking to the brothers deciding how that we will be able to comply with the state's wishes and still come together and worship they're saying that on May 1st which would be next Sunday that the churches could reopen but they want the guidelines that they have put in place to be maintained so we will we will put forth some guidelines of our own some direction in this coming week if we would just stand this morning I'd like to turn to the word I want to speak to you once again here this morning redemptions manifestation part 2 he is here Amen I didn't bother to count it but if you go into the message you will find that the prophet of God used the words now not talking about an individual because there are quotes where brother Bram says now brother so-and-so or whatever he is here but we're talking about those that he's talking about the Lord Jesus and over and over and over again he speaks those words he is here amen and we believe that today so we just want to go into John the fifth chapter and just read these scriptures down to first through eighth verse amen what a lovely time praise the Lord got things I'd like to share with you but we'll just wait a few days a week or - maybe we'll share those things with you amen after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep market a pool now do you catch the irony of this my brother and sister it wasn't by the hog market it wasn't by the steer market it wasn't by the donkey market it was by the sheep market amen which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethsaida having five porches and these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind and halt and withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had had an infirmity thirty and eight years now we don't know how long that he had set or been here we don't have any idea how many days weeks months maybe even years but he had this infirmity a long time when Jesus saw him live and knew that he had now a long time in that case he saith unto Him will thou be made whole oh my my brother and sister he'd been a long time in that case a long time under that affliction the impotent man answered him sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another step a--the down before me jesus saith unto Him rise take up thy bed and walk Heavenly Father we ask for your blessings this morning Lord to be with the Saints wherever they might be this morning father at home or some distant place father Lord we would just ask that you would just come move nigh on to us today Lord may your Holy Spirit we have individual needs but yet as a body of believers we all have the same needs for we are one body and Lord we ask you to come down father wherever we would be separated as it were physically this morning we have come in one mind and one accord to worship you to receive from You Father and we ask now speak freely to us Lord coming or mits Lord speak freely may our hearts be opened father to receive we ask for your blessings and we give praise and glory and honor to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated you know I just want to say that this last week you know things are timely and you know sometimes we can get in a condition where if we're not careful all we see is the problems you know we can see the flaws we can see what is lacking and I sure enjoyed our brother Chris's sermon this last Sunday my brother and sister it's time for us to be a people that are grateful it's time for us to voice from our hearts thank you Lord for saving me it struck me you know that the other day I've been having a tremendous pain in my foot I hadn't even mentioned it to sister Jerry and I was just kind of struggling with that when I would get out of bed in the morning sometimes it would hurt so bad I couldn't hardly take that first step sometimes by the time the day was over all I could think about was sitting down in my easy chair and the other morning I woke up and I was laying there in bed and I went to get out of bed and I stretched forth my leg and you know I thought something's different but it didn't quite register and I got out of bed and I walked and got ready for work and and before I made it out of the house it struck me my foot doesn't hurt and I just thank the Lord that I was able to just stop and say thank you Lord for taking this pain away and then brother Chris comes right along a couple days after that a few days after that preaches on gratitude and it struck me deep in my heart Lord we're not thankful enough we need to open our mouth and say Lord no matter what our circumstances answer is a rich-poor this that the other Lord to be able to say thank you Lord for saving my soul - thank you Lord for having called me out of Darkness amen into the light of the gospel amen Oh hallelujah you know as we look in this thought this morning my brother and sister you know once again as I said my title he is here and I believe with all of my heart because the Word of God said that this morning here in this building here at the church even though there just be a few with us here in the building this morning we as a body join together around the Word of God that we are a great body amen we are the body of Christ amen but the prophet of God told us that this body amen that our Lord Jesus is half and we are half and he is not complete without us and certainly we recognize we are not complete without him and so I say thank you Lord for including bringing into this a great body of Christ someone like me amen you know as Jesus come into the pool there Bethsaida you know this great number of people now we don't have an exact count but my brother and sister a multitude it says a multitude is a great number of people not a handful not a dozen or two but a great number and you know if we was to get really into our research we could probably figure out the size of the area that was there but in my mind and as excuse me for making an assumption but in my mind whatever that area was it was full in my mind I see a great need and the reason I say that is because we look around the world we live in today and the hospitals are full the rehabs are full there's many people in their homes suffering from afflictions and so I just believe that there would have been a great group of people that would be gathered there at the at this Pool of Bethesda and you know they were there waiting they had something they were desiring and you know we look and we can see obviously what the prophet of God said about it just look to your Bible and you will recognize where this come from that Jesus walked in the midst of this great group of people he didn't just come to the fringe and and find someone and talked to them but he walked right through the midst of them and he was right there present many did not even recognize him many had no acknowledgement of his existence but he walks in the midst of them until he finds the one that he is anointed to speak to now my brother and sister later in this same scripture our Lord Jesus says these words that I do nothing but what I see the father now this was brother Branham clarifies this and says this is he didn't hear the father he didn't catch this or catch that he didn't get a note didn't get a letter but what he saw the father do amen imagine my brother and sister how beautiful this is and tied to our generation that it's not a matter of hearing the word but you have to be able to see it and that's why the day that we're living in me many people say well I heard the message I wanted you know this and I heard that and I heard the prophets say but do you see the plan of God do you see God in your midst do you see God working do you see God opening his word because it's not just by hearing alone my brother and sister so we look at this and see how that he come and he's there and he comes and he moves through the great multitude of people and he comes to one man who's had an affliction for a long time one man who might not look in the natural outer appearance any different than literally dozens or maybe hundreds of other people and we don't know exactly what his affliction is but we do recognize that this affliction kept him from easily moving to the pool now you could see my brother and how this I just want to move off and clarify this now these people were there because there was a history as it were a testimony that when the angel comin troubled the water those whom that one who may in the water first was healed this was not a story this was not something that someone had told somebody I heard somebody said but my brother and sister these people were there because this was real and I say God help us with our young people and those around us let them see something real don't let it be we said that sometime 50 years ago God was in the church and moving let God be in the church today and moving so that they can see it is real also hallelujah amen so everyone my brother and sister that was there was there because they had a heart's desire to at some point sometime be able to get into the water and receive their healing now you say well he went through all that multitude to come to one well 2nd Timothy 2 and 19 we see the scripture says nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his amen it wasn't random he didn't wander through that multitude of people until this guy looked like a nice man someone I should probably help God searched out that day at the pool that that was his and he brought Redemption healing to that man amen hallelujah and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity Amen I say amen to that scripture now brother Branham clarifies and we can just simply take it back to our Bible but just to put in that context brother Branham shows us or speaks how that God has made healing available in every age right now the reason we can put that foundation even though someone might say now where was healing at this time where was healing at that time it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and what God is today he was yesterday and will be tomorrow amen I am THE LORD thy God and I change not amen so we see how that a healing has been available in every age and I believe that might not hurt us this morning to lift a hand if you would so choose and say he is my healer Amen to make the claim for the day that we live in that you believe right in this hour and I God is still my healer amen I'll tell you my brother and sister God is moving we're living in a day that technology is allowing things that happen in other nations allowing a things that happened on the other side of our own nation wherever might be to come and be available and we're starting to see a with the use of technology healings that have taken place in families diabetics being healed people with cancer being healed eyes that are losing their vision cataracts and things like that being healed my brother and sister and so as we look in this hour we realize that God is still moving with the same power the same authority now as we look at this I want to shift a little bit just take a little bit of a corner you might say you know back when Israel was in the wilderness and and they were moving along see they when they left Goshen they come right down God didn't waste much time proving what was in their hearts and they come right down to the Red Sea and a doubt and fear no look at the age we're living in this Cove at 19 they're telling us already voices saying well it's going to come back this next winter and it'll be worse well my brother and sister I still believe there would be those saying now now don't you be claiming that that you're sealed from this because there's believers that have caught it and passed away while my brother and sister there might be believers that they said they had this and they might be passed from us but before the foundation of the world God had put a day a time a minute a second that that brother or sister would be called home no kovat 19 took them God took them home if there hadn't been a virus God would have taken them home regardless either that or God's not in control so as we look upon this and realize my brother and sister well you say brother Paul what it what if you get that well I'll just trust the Lord hey man I have shaken well maybe I shouldn't say this because I shook some of your hands this morning but my brother and sister I shake hands with people amen I'm not afraid of what the devil's got to offer amen I tell you we were doing some stuff here at their church yesterday brother Isaac and I'm picking up some stuff cleaning it up taking it away and a man was out in the parking lot and and you know he's out there and and his little kids he says they live a couple three houses down here they got no place but the street for his children two cute little girls to ride bicycles and and he said they often come down here in the evening time and his little girls love to ride over the speed bumps now my brother and sister this man he by most standards would look like pretty rough character but he had these cute little girls and look at that all I want to offer to him I'm not concerned what he could offer back to me what I want to offer to him is Christ now if we're too afraid to engage my brother and sister then we might as well isolate ourselves we might as well just find a hole and crawl in it I'm not afraid my God is in control hallelujah everything that's happened to me now we know God's permissible will let's not get confused here you go out and take a hammer and hit your hand that's not God's plan but my brother and sister you realize we're not afraid of what is coming amen our God's already made a plan for us amen so he made healing available in every age now look when they're going through the wilderness Israel brought this judgment upon themselves because they refused to trust God they refused to believe the word that God had spoken when he said that he would take them into a land a land that was flowing with milk and honey a land that was beyond as it were their imagination and truly it was because they could not fathom in their mind what God was giving to them and I believe we suffer the same affliction today that people do not fathom they don't have an idea of the the blessings that God would like to pour out hey men the inheritance that is laying there for us my brother and sister is beyond our human comprehension and so Israel's unbelief brought them to a place their constant murmuring their constant complaining their constant just dragging their feet on this plan of God and so in that God brought a judgment upon them and so they are there in the Serpent's rised up raised up and and are abiding them and they are dying and God raised up a brazen serpent now my brother and sister we won't go into the whole context of the brazen serpent but the prophet of God simply says that it was sin judged amen and so it was there as the people looked to the brazen serpent and believed brother Branham shows us how that become a point of contact they looked at that and when they looked at the brazen serpent and believed they were expressing that in their heart was faith that God had come to deliver them and so those that looked my brother and sister lived but look at this now the brazen serpent was right there in their myths and people will still dying that means someone didn't believe enough to even raise their eyes and look at the brazen serpent and let that become their point of contact my brother and sister that anointing is still relevant it's still fresh it's still here that people would deny there is a God but yet they can't even explain the reason of their existence but they will not give the acknowledgment of the existence of a God amen and so all they had to do is look up and believe now look here in gifts and callings are without repentance later on after the days of the serpent God sent an angel down from heaven trouble of water on a pool called Bethsaida and ever who stepped into the water first having faith see there's the ingredient someone couldn't just jump in and say okay I jumped in the water here worse the healing oh my brother and sister they tested brother branham that same way you know let's cut this baby let's hurt this baby and you heal him oh I'll tell you what prophet of God explains it maybe not in exact words but that's a sick mind that's a sick mind that would hurt a baby and use that as a way to try to prove whether God is real or not well one that wouldn't take place because their unbelief amen but look at this now after the days God sent an angel down from him in trouble water on pool called Bethsaida and who stepped in that water first having faith was healed of whatsoever disease they had into the waters now the brass serpent done no healing it was their faith in what God had done by the brass serpent is that right the water done no healing it was the angel of God on the water that done the healing the water couldn't say see I'm healing water this is where the Catholics got all confused right they've got this water they blessed the water they sprinkle it on everything my brother and sister they they think that was the cure it's not the water you can't bless as it were carnally blessed the water and the water do it it's when the angel of God is on that water Amen see I'm healing water no it was the angel doing the healing when the angel left the water was water now to go a little farther the prophet of God not writing this message about the prophet of God said when God would use a man when he would call a man and bring him to a place that that man was fully sold out fully committed to God and has just present himself and God would use that man he would anoint that man and use him to fulfill the things of God but when the Spirit of God would leave that man he is just a man so we look and find that it's not just who we are some people say well we got a great pastor we got a great ministry we got this we got that but my brother and sister we know that it is the angel of the Lord or in our day amen the Holy Ghost has come down and there's where the anointing is at amen so you look at that and realize the brazen serpent the water in the pool of bethsaida and you look at all these things that God is using now my brother and sister this scripture tells us mark 16 and if we would believe Amen anoint them with horror lay our hands upon them they'd be healed is their healing hand no my brother and sister it's people with faith joining together just fulfilling the Word of God and God honors that fulfilling and manifestation and brings forth the promise and so as we look at that we recognize that God can anoint anything you want you know you want to take that a little bit further amen God used a donkey to talk to Balaam amen my brother and sister that there's no such thing as a talking donkey amen but you see God knew God spoke he used the unusual the abnormal to trying to catch his attention amen now look in this Oh my brother and sister I just get excited this morning excuse me hallelujah Oh in the sermon identification talking about now a point of contact a sir sir man identification let our lives be so salty that others can watch the way we act and live that they'll want to live that way too now my brother and sister when we go to witness the problem we make sometimes now I was talking to an individual the other day and they said brother Paul am I am I am I making a mistake by speaking to these people and not mentioning brother branham I said no absolutely because brother Branham was pointing to Jesus Christ and we are pointing to Jesus Christ and many people will then just go to their computer and type in william branham and go all these people are crazy my brother and sister what you do is you present Jesus Christ to them you present the life that is in the word you present that to them and when they are so hungry and they go out and they can't find that anywhere else they'll come back and say what is it you've got and then the door is open amen we look at that and present that we want to be so salty that they want to live that way too you know Jesus said you're the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its testimony now its savor its drawing power then it can no longer know no more heal or save salt saves when it contacts and this is part of this what I said earlier my brother and sister if we as believer isolate ourself I think it's an affliction that is upon message believers that we isolate ourselves from the whole world because we act like we're afraid of whatever the world's God's going to get on us like a virus and somehow we're going to fall my brother and sister if we're no stronger spiritually then to be able to do that then we're in trouble already amen we are stronger amen greater is he that is next to you in the church you go to no greater is He that is in you than he that is in this world and so if we're afraid to have any contact with the world my brother and sister what kind of testimony you can have a perfect testimony if there's no one to tell it to then well you just have a perfect testimony that's untouched and unshared oh my salt saves when it contacts we must be God's contact God's expecting us my brother and sister now you take a it used to be back in the days when they had those fuses and stuff you had a little brass bar a little boss bar and you had to swing that down and engage it in the other side to get the current - we live in a day now we just flip a breaker to achieve the same thing but my brother and sister if there's no contact there's no power a man has to be a continuity to pass the current through and so by God's grace amen we must be God's contact that means we must engage we must be in contact to share the power of God we are his point of contact as brother Roberts many times refers to putting his hand on the radio or something for a point of contact now if you're not familiar with this I believe y'all would be it's part of the message brother Brown speaks of it more than once but Oral Roberts used to in his radio broadcasts would be speaking and he would encourage the people to reach out if they believed what was being preached reach out lay your hand on the radio now people would be like that seems weird but you see he had tapped into knowing that in the human element we need a point of contact oh my brother and sister so brother branham does not go man or Roberts who's way off no brother branham talks about how the point of contact is and we need to be that point of contact hallelujah so we look at that and we'll see now now someone might say well brother Paul in this story you're sharing with us this morning obviously our Lord Jesus Christ is the point of contact yes my brother and sister but I've got Christ in me you've got Christ in you so it's not us trying to assert a position Jesus when he was standing there dealing with all those doubters and Sadducees Pharisees and all of them and when he said I and my father are one they were angry because they thought he was a surfing a position of authority he didn't have but little did they know hey man that this was literally God incarnate in flesh right in their myths and Jesus could say that because he saw what his father was doing so this flash here was speaking of what the Word was fulfilling oh my brother and sister how beautiful that is amen so it's here that is saying he that we are the point of contact now at the pool of the Sailor look God provided a point of contact for the people now we're not talking about Jesus being there we're talking about the pool itself God provided a point of contact these people were there my brother and sister because they saw literally themselves they saw the water being troubled nobody was out there with a boat paddle or stick stirring the water saying oh Gideon you'll get healed none of this you might be but when the angel come now the scripture says in the season so there was a season no man knew this season right the scripture tells us that no man knows the day or the time of the hour and God still working in that same Channel he didn't come and though people regular as clockwork at 12:01 today the water will stir my brother and sister they would align the sides of the pool and as the water started to be troubled they would have dived in fell in been pushed in whatever was necessary but you see it was in an unsuspecting time an unknown time that the Spirit of God the angel of the Lord would come down in the midst of the people and people would be like well you know I went to church service after service it seems like our pastors struggling and he has sometimes my brother and sister and you say well I just leave Church feeling uh nanou inton I just don't know but my sister will touch on that I'm a little head of myself there but you'll see my brother's sister no one knew when that angel was going to come down and stir that water no one would do there but look what happened here you come and you know that the angel of the Lord is present and the water starts to be troubled and the angel of the Lord is there and people knew my brother and sister once again I want to say there had been many healings there had many testimonies that if you got in that water no matter what affliction that you had if was healed and I believe I could say that it would have been every single affliction just like the leper that went away with the ten he come back to worship the Lord Jesus amen because he caught a revelation that when he was to show himself to the priest that his he was walking with his friends something struck him it might not have come with clarity problem we have many times as we need every I dotted every comma every punctuation and if we can't see that so perfectly then it couldn't be of God but I believe is that leper was walking away something stirred his heart you need to go back and you need to give praise to him you need to give thanks to him and what was it he was manifesting the very words that Jesus had told him the commandment was to go and show yourself to the priest and he caught a revelation whether he fully recognized it or not that the priest he was to show himself and give praise to was not in front of him in a temple but was there in the wilderness with no pillow amen no place even call his own he will back those got healed of leprosy the word says he was delivered set free from every affliction oh you my brother and sister God is here he's real he's powerful and he's offering this very same offering to you and I hallelujah amen so these healings was there attracting the people to come in Oh imagine the stories that had been told maybe someone had been there maybe they weren't afflicted they were healthy but maybe they had a relative they had a friend they had helped get them down to the pool and they're walking down the street and they would see someone and they tell him did you know that just a couple days ago down here at the pool of bethsaida that someone was healed when they stepped into the water after the troubling of the water that person would be there really if they wanted to be delivered if they really had a desire now I want to be set free from my bondage and my brother and sister this morning I want to say that bondage is not always physical and sometimes it's in the soul sometimes it's in the mind amen but whatever the bondage is if you really want to be set free and then you will go and you will pay attention amen hallelujah Oh many stories are what God's done in the past and we have that today I've been criticized probably be criticized again for for talking about these things where we're constantly looking back my brother and sister I I look back I won't I won't deny that I look back but I'm also looking forward and I'm also looking right into the day that I'm living right here knowing that God comes when God wants to move God will move amen I don't have to look back and say look what brother Branham what happened in this meeting in 1959 well that's good my brother and sister but it struck my heart thank you Lord it's the same God hallelujah the same God that was there in those meetings delivering people is right here with us today inside of Grace inside of your home today inside the cab of your truck where you might be it's the same god that's here today and if you will not respond with the same God here today then I say God help you because there's no other avenue to connect with you then through God's word and his word is alive and well today hallelujah amen oh no doubt my brother and sister amount these people imagine here they are around the pool and no doubt much talk you know as people are gathered together there and and you know I personally this is just my own understanding of it I don't believe these people got up every evening and went back and went back to their house some of them would not have had as it were transportation would not have had the ability but there also would have been if you ever got a spot right on the side of the pool you wouldn't want to lose that to go and so I believe what happened is the people started to congregate there originally and it just kind of grew inhale it come to a place that people were just there around the pool all the time and they were kind of just started living there and you know they were talked about the healings that had taken place and you know how that they would be healed if they got to the water first they start to share you know if I could if this would if this would happen I could be healed my brother and sister in fact I tell you I just maybe it's my vivid imagination you don't agree well forgive me I won't press upon you but look at this my brother and sister I believe that they made friends there I believe they were there by the pool I believe that they were there and they started to know these people started to know their family started to know all of these different circumstances and they got real comfortable kind of like going to church hallelujah it just became what we do this is where we go this is where our friends are these when we know they know the story of their life we know this we know that my brother and sister I believe they got there made their friends shared their stories they got comfortable in their surrounding oh I'll tell you what I'll be the death of many a person they got comfortable in church I'll tell you what we didn't bring here and we didn't bring you here anyhow but we didn't bring you here to get you comfortable maybe I'll tell you if we believe Tozer and Spurgeon in them if we haven't made you angry and haven't fussed you up we didn't do our job hallelujah but what is it we got the opposite twist today that if I go to church and the preacher don't make me happy I'm gonna find a different church well hallelujah we didn't call you here or God that means I'm sorry God didn't call you here to make you happy God called you here to set you free amen and I'll tell you what when you look at some of the scale that can get attached to humanity sometimes it takes a lot of washing of the water to get that off of them amen hallelujah any of those that feel scuffed and skinned right now forgive me amen but I'll tell you my job is not to make you happy amen it's God's job to make you happy I can't make you happy I won't be able to make you happy and I'm losing my desire to make you happy amen I've got a great desire to preach the gospel I just don't have much desire left to make you happy no I hope that don't offend anyone amen you see what happened they started losing sight they started going blind while they're there by the pool of the real purpose of why they were there oh I hope that soaks in my brother and sister the word tells us not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together especially as we see that time approaching but you see the house of God is not our social club the house of God is not our place we can express ourselves if you've got a gift thought is given to you and you've committed that to the Lord and the Lord lays it on your heart then you give the gift back to God but my brother and sister we oftentimes we view church more as an extension of our personal house and our personal family and it's become more of that than it has a house of God amen in the word says that a house of God is a house of correction amen Oh hallelujah they lost what they'd come for in the beginning they were there my brother and sister I believe I can say with assurance that many times people were talking to their neighbor to their friend to someone a family member that had come to bring provision to them and the angel stirring the water and they are completely distracted they completely miss it until someone starts to shout and holler and someone there's a splash and someone comes out of that water now my brother and sister the word doesn't say if they as soaked or marinated in that water for a while that then they were healed I believe my brother and sister they got in that pool and they got right back out and they were healed and that would catch the attention but what if you were sitting there and while this happened you were focused entirely on something else and when your attention is drawn Mac it would be something happened all my brother and sister I know of testimony I know of testimony that that you might call it the transgressor has testified that they were in church and their mind being somewhere else amen their thoughts their hearts somewhere else and find out that God had healed and delivered in the very service that they were bored to death in all I want you to think about that this morning the very service that they wish they were somewhere else God come down in the midst amen and we'll touch a little bit more on that hallelujah amen what your circumstance can become your way of life Hey how long you been here four years I've been going to grace I've been going here I've been going there for years have you got the deliverance that you're seeking no I haven't but this is where I go to church oh my brother and sister I'll tell you what we got way too much religion and not enough of God amen and I say Church don't let your current condition become the benchmark of your life this is the place in my life where I hit pinnacle my brother and sister my pinnacle if God would so granted is going to be standing in front of the throne of Almighty God it's not going to be an office it's not going to be a position it's not gonna be if I was no longer pastor of grace my brother and sister I'm still a son of God and I will still serve Him with a capacity that God has put me in there it's not because of an office that we would come and say we are spiritual amen but you see they found comfort and just being there now I have to tell you Saints when I don't make it to church I get antsy to be in church I want to be in church in fact there are some that well I'll just mind my own business hallelujah let's just say sometimes a little rebellion is probably good but the angel went down at a certain season verse 4 into the pool troubled the water and the first one in was made whole of whatsoever disease he hadn't I want you to think about this you got a disease maybe it's taking your life you're right there at the pool or within a step or two of the pool but you've built such a life that the pool is actually only the location or place of transaction of your life your life was not so focused that for day in and day out you looked for the pool now I don't know maybe there was rules maybe there's a handrail maybe there's a fence around the pool I have no idea but if there wasn't you would think that one would practically live on the edge of the pool and would desire enough to be delivered from their affliction that they would spend their life studying the pool and at the moment now pardon me I'm just a person that has to express things and the moment that the water stirred on the pool you would throw yourself in the pool turns out it was just an easterly breeze you might be wet but you'd climb out of the pool saying you know what I'll wait again for the water to be stirred but you see there come a life associated with the pool a life that had nothing to do with deliverance or healing it became a culture it became a tradition I'm afraid many of our churches have become as a pool of bethsaida we come there maybe not for the right reasons oh my you see being there didn't do one thing for their condition not one thing whether we're at home today or whether we were all gathered together in this church sitting on these pews this morning just being here or there wouldn't mean one thing my brother and sister it won't change you won't change me amen just being there doesn't do it you see they had to focus they had to pay attention they had to watch for the stirring of the water and it wasn't as though that they could just easily go over and climb in at their own will but they had to be committed to what God was doing because God had set the condition as the first person now we understand my brother and sister the day that we live in it's no longer about being about one or being the first but there is a certain condition that has to be brought to pass and is not just simply sitting in this church and this might sound a little harsh and I don't want to offend you but I've witnessed it right here in this church to come down to the ends of a service and see people before we're even dismissed picking up their car keys picking up their Bibles grabbing their coat all this stuff they're getting ready to leave they're collecting their stuff because they've got leaving on their mind and so as they're coming here the service is now over I've got places to go I've got people to see I've got things to do my brother and sister I hope this disturbs you I hope it don't make you angry I hope it stirs you because their mind is already somewhere else and while their mind is somewhere else I have many times witness the Holy Ghost coming down in the church and stirring people and see people crying out to God while others are out in the foyer talking about work last week next week this week not week whatever it might be now maybe it wasn't for them I couldn't say my brother and sister that sometimes things are just for an individual but I can assure you my brother and sister that I'll speak to you from my heart that many times the person that is ready to leave never engaged in this service the whole whole time they thought being in church was sufficient well good gather around the pool make a life there do whatever you want to build a tent to get a pillow get a blanket get your stereo get everything you want sit there at the pool for the rest of your life you'll never be healed you had to watch you had to look you had to pay attention you had to know when the moving of the Holy Spirit when the angel come down and stirred the water it was your job God didn't send a memo and say in 10 minutes I'll be at the pool be ready for me God said when I come if you look for me you will find me people say well our pastor preached kind of a very boring service well that's good God said he would be here and if you looked for him you would have found him oh my brother and sister you say brother Paul you're being harsh no I'm being honest I'm being honest because I love you because we got to break the tradition of religion and get back to serving God amen so you know what you got people they got this now look I want to speak kind of you might say I here you know we've got people there collecting their stuff got car keys in their hand and they're already standing at the end of the Pew I'll tell you now you might say well brother Paul I think you're talking about somebody no I'm not I'm talking about spirits but my brother and sister if the service is not over and you're already pointed to the door you didn't get what you should have gotten service we're not here my brother and sister to take a token portion and leave we're here to worship God and where is the worship the worship the true worship is not in the beginning of the service that sets us in a condition to hear the word and then the word brings a deliverance and it's the end that we truly worship my brother and sister at the opening of the word it stirs us just as the angel of the Lord stirred the pool there my brother and sister the Word of God serves the heart of a son or daughter of God and causes them to come to a place to worship and I can assure you my brother and sister let those that step down in the pool and receive their healing didn't get up and say good now I can go on with my life they knew they had experienced the supernatural they had experienced but they had to sit there day in and day out service after service all pardon me service after service they had to look for the stirring of the water they had to be ready because they knew there was a promise in the word that said where two or three are gathered in my name I will be in their building no in their midst oh my brother and sister Oh hallelujah well I still love you I hope you still love me amen you see what happens in those moments you see God's not predictable God comes in his season I've seen this happen but God used it to teach me a lesson one time in far southern Chile preaching in a church service there and just seemed like everything was wrong it just the translator was struggling to to speak the words that I was speaking and I knew it was just the devil because he's a he's a fluent he's he's capable oh but he's just stumbled and he struggled and he kept asking me you know what did you say I didn't understand and when the service is over the people just looking and and I was like oh Lord and and I went in the office is in the back corner of the church and I went in the office and I was sitting there in the dark and I'm ashamed to admit this but it's good confession is and I sitting in there and I was like service was a bomb I wished up isn't even here and then there was a knock on the door and one of the Deacons spoke to the translator and he said brother Paul they want you and I thought Maya what do they want me for I stepped down to the door and half of the churches in the altar crying out to God my brother and sister you see we put too much on what we think what we see how we feel and God comes in an unpredictable time in an unpredictable way what seemed like a totally flat service something there's total confusion and chaos but God said I'm pleased and there's someone here that needs a deliverer is someone in the congregation looked and saw the stirring of the water and they said I'm getting in because the angel of the Lord the Holy Ghost is here I'm gonna get in my life will be changed and their lives are changed to this day hallelujah God has allowed us to remain friends with with many of those that were in that service and that time and their lives have been forever changed not because of me me I too went out the door got in a car and went back to the place we were staying but God was there to do business my brother and sister and God said I'll when you preach a great service I'll come down and deliver when you do this I know my brother and sister the angel came when the angel was sent by God the angel came at the Angels timing and stirred the waters oh I'll tell you what there's more than one testimony my brother and sister of simple simple services and God coming and doing the miraculous because someone was sitting at the edge of the pool are you with me someone sitting at the edge of the pool saying I need you Lord I'm at my edge Lord I met my end I met my ability Lord has come to an end I need you and the Holy Spirit my brother and sister I'll guarantee you God moves more in the sub to moving in the church than he does of the people falling over under the anointing of the Holy Ghost but we miss it because about that time we decided to take a nap I don't know why people come to church to take naps or you might think I'm being mean no I just wanna I just want to bring it right out in the open Saints I love you maybe we need to go to bed before midnight on Saturday night so when we come to the house of God we can watch for the stirring of the pool and not fall asleep oh lord help us lord help us so we see the holy spirit moving and stirring hearts see we have in the same service the same time at the pool two entirely different experiences taking place at the same time you know I often find humor when I think about this when I read it and I'll just cut right down to the barren necessity of the statement and that is those that walked out of church and one says well he called me a buzzard and the one walks right out behind him hallelujah he called me an eagle two different experiences in the same place think about the pool my brother and sister some spent years there never received their healing maybe went and and and passed away and were buried never received it and there would have been some so intent on what their hearts desire was that they with intent watch for the stirring and oh I missed it today as it were but Lord if you would so grant it tomorrow I will see the troubling of the water and I will invite you in I will be healed or my brother and sister I tell you I've missed it myself I set in a truckstop one time lonesome for home been out on the road gone and just not very happy sitting in a truck stop eating some food and waiting for a shower my shower number to be called for those of you don't have experience of that in the evening time there'll be so many trucks come in there they give you a number someone will use the shower they'll they'll clean it and another use the shower and the number will slowly come until they call your name and so sometimes you might sit there I've set in truck stops for an hour and a half you know just waiting and every 10-15 minutes somebody who's taking a shower in that particular shower and you got to wait your time and I'm sitting there and a man comes and sets in the booth across from me and this starts talking to me like I was his friend and at the time I was I'll just be honest with you I was annoyed I'm homesick I don't really want to hear about this guy who's from West Virginia and how his wife is just threatened him on the phone that she's going to divorce him and their children caught on drugs and their life is under chaos and the man pouring this all out and I'm kind of like okay I got my own problems I got my own problems I don't want to hear yours oh my brother and sister if I could have been sensitive if I could have been sensitive that something was nudging me speak to me home but you see I was so caught up in my life beside the pool and to this day it haunts me then I never spoke to him oh god if I could have been sensitive enough to realize that might have been you stirring the water and that man trying to respond and out of a hundred hundred and fifty people stuffed in a truck stop he chooses to sit down in front of me and I ignored God's origin Saints it's not a game it is not a game I can still see that man's face and I still pray Lord let that man somewhere in his life run into someone would have spoken to him Oh hallelujah my brother and sister a whole nother world had taken place I hope that other world that's living outside the edges of the pool is not called grace I hope grace is found in the pool hallelujah amen one looking for the troubling of the water you know you see when Jesus speaks to him now my brother and sister an impotent man is one without strength they have no ability to to fulfill or to do you know it's it's interesting and when you look at that one that is impotent just there there's no strength there's nothing they cannot to accomplish the goal they cannot you look at that and you realize my brother and sister that a heart's desire might be there to be in the pool but maybe a slightly misguided maybe my brother and sister as he was sitting there waiting he says sir I have no man to help me get in the pool we don't know the circumstances I'll only speak this just in context when I would have done has found me a man there would have helped me get to the edge of the pool lord if I have to fall in your presence if I have to roll into your presence if I have to be shoved as it were into your presence but he says I have no man Lord that when when the angel stirs the water and I try to get into the pool and someone would come and even try to help me someone gets there before me aren't you glad we live in a day that every heart every one that desires something from the Lord can just enter right into his presence aren't you glad the veil has been rent and were no longer waiting on the edge of a pool somewhere to find a deliverance to find something from God that we can simply come out and cry out to him and he is there to answer it oh I tell you what stirs my heart thank you lord thank you lord thank you Lord hallelujah amen he says you know I have no man amen well I'll tell you what my brother and sister we live in a day God rich in mercy I was just listening to not the other day brother branham preaching and he lays out every one of those you know what I'm talking about lays out of them but God rich in mercy and goes right into it but God rich in mercy and I tell you it strikes me but God rich in mercy we're sitting here waiting for some man right under the spirit of denomination we'll need some man to lead somewhere but God said I am gonna come and I'm gonna bring a word in your hour and I'm gonna restore everything back to its rightful position and I'm an anoint you Holy Ghost and I myself will lead you and guide you into all truth all we don't have to sit and wait for the man no longer a men the man Christ Jesus is come he's here he's on the scene hallelujah what we got to do is sit there we're no longer looking at the troubling of the water as it were to find it but Jesus Oh hallelujah he's here brother branham preach that sermon look away to Jesus we don't got to look down here in this carnal things here but we can look away to Jesus here's the answer to my need here's the answer to my situation I don't have to let my situation define me I am greater than my situation not us in our flesh but Christ in us amen Oh hallelujah see once again I already mentioned this we don't gotta wait for the man to preach the perfect sermon to stir our hearts we don't have to come and say well if I just if I'd have been the one that would say I would have presented it like this or or you know I would have I would have you know made sure that I read that quote word-for-word I wouldn't have used a paraphrase or I would you know I would have my brother sister forget that nonsense you're looking at the man why don't you look for the troubling of the water why don't you say we're all in the same game this is not us trying to deceive you but the problem is is people get to the place they're looking for what's wrong and not for what's right they're looking for the circumstance they're not looking for the deliverance and I say it's time for us to look beyond that and realize my brother and sister that God is here and God said if there's an heir I'll correct it and if the word is being presented my brother and sister that the power of God God will honor his own word the prophet of God said God's his own he doesn't need us to interpret the word and then how does he or I love this how does he interpret his word by bringing it to pass hallelujah how do I know that this message is the truth my brother and sister because it is producing exactly what the word said it would produce Amen it's not producing a denomination it's not producing a cult it's four deucing sons and daughters of god that are being washed by the water of the word by the Spirit amen no longer sitting looking for that man that will bring us all people are like well there's a man over here there's a man in India there's a man over here in Africa there's a man over here in North America there's a man in Europe my brother and sister I'm not interested I'm interested in the man Christ Jesus because that other portions you might save the word have been fulfilled the restorations been made the prophet of God said we're moving into the bride age where the bride is being brought to complete maturity and in that maturity she becomes the other part of Jesus Christ to make oh oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh makes me think of the words of the song open the eyes of my heart Lord I don't want to just hear this word my brother and sister I want to see it alive I want to see it alive in you I want to see it alive in me let the mirror of God's Word come and stir us hallelujah hallelujah Amen sister Ruth will you come you know over and over I have to admit I never read every one of the quotes there's a Myron of things he's dealing with brother Browns talking about about people you know one of them is that brother that brother is he here I'm paraphrasing us is he here and there's some response he is here okay we discount that we just that's just phraseology but you follow through that you study the quotes I didn't have time enough to go through more than about 30 or 40 of them this morning you study the quotes the prophet of God starts out my brother and sister talking about what God's going to do and then a shift in his ministry and he starts talking about he is here he is here he is here here we're not looking my brother and sister Oh people say well you believe parousia that well good I don't know how you determine it and I don't know when you got in my mind to understand what I think but if you want to call it peruse you you call it peruse you know I'm gonna call it the word and he promised I'll be with you even in you that means he's here oh but that was words good you take the words I'll take the content I don't care how you want to explain it I know what I feel I know what God's done I know what God's changed in my life I know what the focus that he's given me and I say he is here and I can look back in my life and tell you at the time you say well that's just the Holy Ghost good to find that however you want to but I can see the time in my life that it changed and I started to change but you see there was another change after I got saved and after I had the Holy Ghost there come a day that will another change and this message no longer no a message I was following the message became my life it became Who I am I thought it was interesting maybe my brother Adam would would like this I seen a little deal that said religion is when the man is in church thinking about fishing relationship with God is when a man is fishing thinking about God I thought that was lovely I don't want to have religion I don't want to be fixing my farm feeding the cows on the crops in church but I do enjoy spending a lot of time in a tractor cab thinking about God you see my brother and sister it's time for us to quit looking at all the world and start looking at the stirring of the water stirring of the presence of Holy Ghost in our life that God would have Liberty to do what he wants you see if he's not here we have to start tearing the pages out of our Bible that would be in conflict with that you go right ahead I'm not willing I'm not going to change this message to fit me I'm going to change to fit this message Oh hallelujah he's telling us to rise take up your bed and walk you know we won't get into it this morning we're finished but in just a few scriptures down Jesus comes to this man and tells you've been delivered you've been healed now go and sin no more lest something worse would come upon you you see jesus heals this man with not one even reference to him being the Messiah the Son of God anything he simply comes and hunted up that one man just like he hunted up you and I hunted up that one man come to him but you see for a Redemption to make a full circle it comes back to this man and he lays a groundwork those words were simple but you see when our eyes have been opened in our ears have been opened prophet of God clearly shows us it's right in the scripture he draws it out you see my brother and sister the redeemed they'll hear and they will see Amen you can't give it to him and you oh thank you Lord can't take it away from them but Jesus comes back to this man and tells him your he'll go and sin no more that man right there I believe in my when I read the scripture just understanding that man was a sheep might have been the only sheep in the whole porch best SATA but he'll go for one just like he come for you and I and that beautiful I thank the Lord today oh lord help us as you would come and stir the waters as it were of grace Tabernacle that we would be here watching not just going to church day in and day out that's called by rote when you do something my brother and sister the Catechism they take that I've been around it I've been around people I've been on an airplane as a matter of fact I've been on an airplane and and thunderstorms in the plane jerking around and trays flying on the floor and pop flying off of the service cart and whatever else and a lady a row up and over from us across the aisle man first thing that flies out everybody else is like trying to grab their soda pop and their crackers and whatever thing she lets her splash she's got a rosary out and she's just Mormon right what is that it's by rote she was trained that if I was going to deliver her I'll take brother on Peterson's approach they ought to be thankful we
