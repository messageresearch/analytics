could just ask God to tap help us tap into that this morning Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord we know father we know that faith is within us Lord Jesus father you anointed that faith in our hearts and this morning we asked that you would do that for these requests Lord Jesus because we can have faith for our brother and our sister Lord father we just pray for sister her teeth Lord although she's

Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] hallelujah amen isn't it wonderful to be able to come in his presence Amen to be able to adjust from the heart you know I just have been caught up in that thought [Music] a cry from the heart amen sometimes life circumstances bring us we don't even have a response but the heart does the heart is crying out saying I need more of you Lord I need you this morning can we lift a hand this morning and say Lord that is my heart's cry today I need you Lord I need more of you than I've ever had before Lord [Music] I need you in the morning and the noon and in the night time oh thank you Lord Jesus Lord to fill your presence or to know that you're walking with us oh Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen just a couple things I want to share quite quick quick here uh this coming Sunday Easter Service the certainly would welcome any songs that the Lord might lay on your heart of course I would say that for every service um we'll have a potluck to follow this coming Sunday so we want to remind you that brother George will be coming um I think he arrives afternoon or evening of the 20th so I have some things I have not confirmed with brother George but I would like to have a Friday evening service uh just to give brother George time to share what he sees and hears on the mission field what's happening around the world more of an informal time and we don't want to turn this as the prophet of God talked about soup suppers and all these kind of things we don't want to do that but we might have just a little time of Fellowship in the basement after uh brother George on on Friday evening and then we'll have Saturday uh probably about six o'clock Sunday morning and uh then we'll have a time I know brother George enjoyed the last time he was here with us to be able to sit down uh on fellowship with you so we'll be looking forward to a potluck after the Sunday service also amen so as we would just turn in our Bibles um I'm going to do something a little different this evening this might come as a surprise here but sometimes it's good you know reminds me of a brother in South Africa telling me uh a little bit of brother Gideon's approach and he's talking about how brother Gideon called up and said brother I'd like you to speak this Wednesday and the brother said I started to offer up uh brother Gideon um I'll be you know having to work till six and my time will be very tight and everything will be a very busy week and as he gives all these reasons brother Gideon then says brother I've got to go I'm really looking forward to your sermon on Wednesday click and so tonight for maybe 15 or 20 minutes our brother Adrian's going to share a little something from his heart and I'm looking forward to that amen just something just to encourage us right before we go into communion and uh so uh brother Adrian click so anyway let's turn in our Bibles this morning um on things that are to be amen that's a topic my brother and sister is the prophet of God speaks of those things he's he's giving us an insight into what is going to happen before us and we can get caught up in a spirit my brother and sister and we can talk about there's going to be wars and rumors of wars and pestilence and famines and all kinds of tribulations but we as the bride of Christ should be looking we know that's going to happen the word said so but I'm telling you there are things that are to be that are glorious and Supernatural uplifting to the soul empowering a bride of Christ to look with enthusiasm to the day that is coming now my brother and sister I'll just uh throw this in in this context when we're there laboring and you you have no choice but to just labor you have no choice but to take care of the things you have to take care of sometimes we find it when we're weary In the Flesh maybe a little weary in the spirit we we're not Enjoying Everyday Life in some context do you understand what I'm saying but what we have in a spiritual realm is a promise of things that are to be and I tell you if we can look Beyond this flesh and look to the things that are promised to us men this flesh is much more bearable but when we look to the Flesh and have no promise of tomorrow then this life can be pretty dull it can be pretty worrisome it can be pretty bothersome it can be I won't go on all the adjectives that would be included in that but I tell you when it comes and we see all of these things happening what does the word say look up look up Don't Look Down don't just look at what the problems are because our problems are greater than us in the flesh but not greater than him in our flesh amen so it's just a real privilege to be here today so I want to preach once again on blessed is the man you'll find I've jumped ahead all the way to Revelations 19 and if we will just turn in our Bibles Revelations 19 1 through 13. amen and I don't mean to embarrass anybody but brother Daniel and I call you brother because I view you as my brother and friend God bless you to see you this morning amen now look at this my brother and sister what is happening this is a passage of scripture that is very much giving us a spiritual insight into things that are to be and I love this scripture and I really am attracted to that because as we'll get down and read the scripture there amen it tells us that uh there is the time that we should be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamest and that passage has always been a very special passage to me because it is an absolute directive of what is going to happen it is not a hope Soul it might be it is an absolute directive saying this is going to take place can someone say thank you Lord for that amen because when it is promised to take place you know it reminds me of a little story once a brother shared with me he said he told his son he says you know son uh you mow the lawn today and dad will take you and your little sister for ice cream so the little boys out there in the heat of a Saturday afternoon mowing the grass all sweaty little guy almost not big enough you know to to do the job and when they get all done well there was uh some circumstances rose up and it looked like they weren't going to ice cream and the little boy comes in and he looks his dad in the face he doesn't say Hey Dad remember you said this he just says as it was spoken so shall it be our little ones remember and so should we as it was spoken so shall it be amen we should have that kind of confidence now we as parents sometimes have failed to follow through and Lord forgive us children forgive us amen I know that my own children Through The Years you know they're all grown up got children of their own and you know I remember dad you said you never want to hear those things it's like okay let's subject go on but we do fail but our Gods never fail can someone lift a hand and say thank you Lord you've never failed me amen your word always comes to pass Hallelujah Revelations 19 1-13 and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power unto the Lord our God for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication and has Avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said Alleluia and her smoke rose up forever and ever and the Four and Twenty elders and the four beasts fell down in worship God that set on the throne saying amen Alleluia and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great and as I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude and as a voice of many Waters as a voice of Mighty thundering saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice now my brother and sister this directly included you and I right into this scripture and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine lineness of the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb amen just blessed just to be called can we today say Lord thank you for blessing me amen and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that set on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself he was clothed with the vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God Heavenly Father we ask you to bless this time this morning Lord such a lovely atmosphere father just to feel your presence just ask you come down lord I know there are needs here today there are hearts that are hungry Lord I ask you to satisfy every need father and every Hungry Heart may walk today from this building filled the father Lord we ask for your guidance and for your word and for your blessing the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated as I have already said through the years I have looked at this scripture and in times when I struggled with things in my life and I struggled to really see who I was I always come back to this scripture because to me it was an assurance that there would come a time that I would be ready there was a time and assurance that that these pieces would all fall in place and you know at that stage of my life when I lived in a realm you might say of chaos when I lived in a realm that I viewed myself more of a hypocritical nature but my brother and sister it's not hypocrisy when it comes from your heart and you're trying but you come short of the goal amen that is this the process that God is using and we'll touch on that Lord willing a little more here in a few minutes but you look at this and realize that Satan would come every time that we come sort of our expectation of ourself that Satan jumps on the bandwagon to tell us you don't have what it takes but the truth is my brother and sister it's to God who charts our progress it is not ourself it's not the preacher the church it's not the world it's certainly not Satan amen I'll tell you what it is uh just reminds me one time brother Ron Spencer making a statement you know he's dealing you know with cancer and and he's there you know declaring that hey I might have this the doctor say you have this but he said you know I'm here to preach the word of God and that poor devil is going to have to as long as I'm alive gonna have to hear me preach this over and over and over again poor devil amen but he's going to have to hear this bride of Christ because she's got a testimony and God is the one that is marking or charting the process the progress of this bride of Christ amen it's no one else thank you Lord amen and as it is uh I say that Revelation 19 gives us a very clear picture of just how awesome our God is we look at this and realize how beautiful how incredible he is and how this great plan that he had for our lives it can go for a season my brother and sister but as it is you know now this seems like counter-intuitive to use this but I want to I believe it's a very good example my brother and sister there are certain weeds in the world today that their seed can go in the ground and can lay there for many many years before it grows now this seems counterintuitive to use this for an example but it is a very good example a thistle seed while the thistle has not taken over the world only because one out of about 50 000 seeds is dermatized otherwise imagine what everything would look like but a thistle seed can lay in the soil between 12 and 15 years before the conditions are just right for it to grow and so I use that because it is something in the natural we are not thistle we are Sons and Daughters of God but God knows the seed of certain attributes can lay in our life for many seasons and we would say why is this not in my life or I would desire to Manifest this and it doesn't seem to be there and the devil will discourage you because it is not coming to pass but when the conditions are right when the season is right and when the moisture of the holy spirit is right night my brother and sister that pops to life amen and so it's there that we come as Sons and Daughters of God never stopping my brother and sister to judge yourself harshly we should judge ourselves daily but don't judge yourself harshly there's a lot of difference of that there's even an acknowledgment what we might say looks like hypocrisy because we can recognize certain things in our life that need to change but we seem to be powerless to change that can someone say I've been there amen but God knows that in the season because everything has to be in its correct order Amen in its correct season and so God knows that while we recognize and we are praying or seeking to have something manifested in our life God knows this season that is necessary because my brother and sister you don't go out in the field and plant sideways with the planter everything's got to be in a row it's got to be in the right way if it's not whatever when the cultivator which would be the word coming to correct us clean up our life when the cultivator comes everything that's planted in the center of the row is a weed now we have a phrase on the farm that a tree in the wrong place is a weed and we all love trees we want to plant trees we want to live you know have trees my brother and sister but if the tree is in the wrong place I've seen trees absolutely push the whole side of a house foundation over because of the roots planted too close to the house and left unattended for years it has that kind of strength so we don't want these things in our life if they're detrimental to our life amen so you look at that many times like we'll see speaking in tongues I made reference Wednesday night you know people would speak in tongues and say I've got it but is if that is not in the right season not in the right order not in the right ground they'll go through the rest of their life believing God has blessed them and spoke to them and give that stamp of approval when in fact the word is what we measure our life by not by gifts amen so it's always the preeminence that is given to the word and so as we get this clear picture of our awesome God and and he is the only one that is worthy these are just the scriptures we're just going to bounce down through this if you don't mind he's the only one that is worthy of our praise and glory and honor amen we give this to our God we give respect to men and to authority of governments Etc but we give glory and honor to God Amen because the word says we're not respecters of men meaning that they have dominance of our life but we have to as a Christian give a respect in other words if you find yourself being disrespectful to your brothers and your sisters to Ministry Etc you've got the wrong spirit and there are many people today and I'm not going to go off in this but I'm just going to speak strongly on this many people today believe they have a right to speak disrespectfully of those who don't agree with them not realizing that that clearly declares a wrong spirit God give us the right spirit amen because with the right Spirit we can correctly discern amen this brother might not agree with me but I will treat him like a brother I will treat him with respect and people say why are you giving honor to somebody that's caught up in something that's not correct my brother and sister you're not speaking about them as much as you are speaking about yourself because if you don't have that kind of a nature in you then you don't have the nature of God now when I say that people will say but Jesus called them Snakes in the Grass and he called them devils and he called them all that my brother and sister he was speaking from a Divine Authority that you and I don't have yes sir Lord help us because there's a lot of people think they have the authority to declare who is and who isn't but I'm here to tell you we have the authority to pray to change the situation and we have the authority to judge whether it's right or wrong not whether they're in or out um so that's the clarity that we seek amen but look at how awesome our God is this message is a very personalized message you know my Netflix account has been canceled once a week for the last six months usually about 4 A.M my phone dings and because it could be a believer and have a need or a situation I do my best to get out of bed and look at it now my brother and sister I'm not worried about my next flip Netflix account being canceled because I've never had it now the devil can try and tell me how to cancel my situation but if I've never had it it doesn't apply to me amen now I want you to catch this because the word says I've never had any sin held to my account when the Devil comes and says your sin I can say you've got the wrong account this is probably a scam or a fraudulent or a misdirected I don't need to go on tap the little blue thing on the screen and go to their account and try to prove to them who I am you know and the final proof is strangely enough always your credit card number but you see if they're saying you are but you aren't disregard that that's why the word says that when we come to a place so we have no condemnation we have complete confidence my brother and sister do you understand that's not saying come to the day you never make a mistake do you realize my brother and sister what that mistake anybody made a mistake lately okay will the rest of you lift your hands just because we want to be honest in church today my brother and sister do you realize when you made that mistake you'd say why would God allow me to make that mistake I'll tell you why God allowed you to make that mistake to magnify Grace in your eyes to magnify his authority before Sons and Daughters of God it's not to magnify your mistake that's Satan's job his is to say I want you to recognize how great my grace is in your life oh Hallelujah so we get to look and see this personalized message of our God we can talk about Sinners my brother and sister if we talk about in the context we normally talk about Sin as humans well well my sin I made a mistake I thought a thought I looked at a woman I looked at a man I did this or did that a coveted a vehicle a house uh whatever my whatever the situation might be we call that mistake we call that sin and we would say well if you recognize that and you don't do anything about it it's iniquity but my brother and sister if you don't have something stirring in the heart and you just by the flesh try to come and say I'm going to overcome my situation by my willpower I'll tell you your willpower will run out oh but we ever get in the spirit of God getting the presence of almighty God and something down in the heart starts to rumble and starts to bubble and you are there and you say Lord I want to be what you called me to be I want to be alive like you called me to live I want to be everything you said I am and my brother and sister something starts to change and a week goes by and you still are struggling with the same problem and the month goes by you're still struggling with the same problem and the devil says you can't do it and all we can do is say you're right devil but I'm on the road I am moving down the road I'm taking the steps and one by one the Fetters fall off the shackles are broken one by one we leave the things behind us because we were called not to live in a Briar Patch not to live in the gravel on the side of the road not to live in a back alley but to live in the presence of almighty God oh I tell you I my brother and sister this beautiful gorgeous wonderful Journey God has called us on it's called a journey and it's not over till it's over and we take the steps and I'm telling you I'm not where I was yesterday I'm not where I was last week last month last year I'm on the journey and I'm moving forward all the Devils say look it reminds me I just saw a picture on the screen saver this morning of the play that our young people put on a few years ago and uh it was it was wonderful and and it popped up a picture you know they were offered a shortcut the devil's always got a shortcut man I'll tell you what huh the devil's pretty clever because the goal well whatever that was the castle however you want to call that the goal was to Castle everyone could say our goal is the castle but God's got a provided way to get there right right and the devil's got a shortcut that says if you happened to go through the swamp step on the right log that doesn't sink and the gator happens to be taken a nap that afternoon and everything else that's there you might make it on that shortcut but is that what God called us to they never call us take a shortcuttie he told us to go his provided way and so when we are walking in his provided way the word of God clearly shows us we're blessed people amen we don't need to worry how long the journey is or how we're going to get there I've been invited to a marriage supper and the word says I am blessed because I was invited amen so it's not about my ability to get there to be a part of the the marriage supper the fact is I am blessed and if I'm walking in God's blessings I will be there amen because he's already made the way before us now look at this there's verse 5 you know it says uh and there was a voice come out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great you know when I read this and we all have to admit that we would look at the word of God and read things and have different stimulation you might say from that right if you don't think so then why did the denomination come up with a different conclusion so every there's there's a lot of different conclusions come from the same word same anointing of the word will produce the same seed no matter where but if the anointing is not the same anointing then that anointing produces the anointing of where it come from see anointings are birthed [Music] you say what no yeah some of those anointing come out of the pits of hell that cannot be the same birthing that came from the Throne of God so these anointings are birthed my brother and sister and do you realize that Satan's so Desiring to destroy you has birthed these anointings with everything brother Chris was just sharing what he's speaking to the young adults and it's interesting we had a lot of different thoughts but the same thought and my brother and sister when you understand that the anointing that come from God was birth specifically for you amen you realize that's why this is a personal gospel it's not just a random one size fits-all gospel my brother and sister these young people that we have here I pray God fills every one of them with the Holy Ghost but they've not been out raised out here in a bar room they haven't lived in a deal of all this garbage that's taking place in the world today they've been raised in church but they still have to have a new birth they have to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ amen now I want you to know that this birth that God is birthing the word to you as individuals is so personalized my brother and sister when we get down the road aways unfortunately we have to kind of get old before we really Dawns on us but you come and realize how specifically in your path of life God met you here God met you here God met you here no one else has walked that exact same path So Gone had a personalized message for you but you know the devil's got a personalized message and the prophet of God said that Satan has studied you for years upon years upon years studied your nature studied your weakness studied your desire and he's doing everything he can do when he throws that out it's not some random thing my brother and sister it's not that he would come and offer liquor to a man that hates liquor he personalizes it he makes it specific he targets it I believe that was brother Donnie Reagan was preaching some time back about how the more that God gives to you and the more that God is in you the bigger the target is on your back amen when there isn't much there Satan isn't really shooting so much at you but the more that you surrender and give to God the bigger the target is and people will say praise the Lord I'm a Christian now my problems are over no they are gonna start growing from that point on because Satan sees something and he knows he's got to kill it it's a shame that he's a bad enough shot he can't um Hallelujah that's why I gave up bow hunting years ago big beautiful deer standing there maybe here to the back of the church and I after practice and practice and practice and practice I get out in the field I'm standing there behind a Butch I've got my bow drawn and I'm there is he 20 yards is he 30 yards I don't know I always misjudged the distance I'm going to call it 40. and the arrow flies this much over its back after I did that dozens of times I decided Lord you didn't call me to be a bow hunter yeah but they're Satan they're Satan they're in position I can do them in and the one thing that I'm going to cause them to do is I'm going to cause them to miss the marriage he doesn't need to kill us Saints he doesn't need to leave us wounded as the sense of we think wounded he's just got to cause us to miss the marriage however he does it he doesn't even care we might miss it sitting in church as the prophet of God said the man on the bar stool is not going to be disappointed hmm but look at this verse 5. you know when I read this I see it as a command and a voice came out of the throne right so here's a voice it's not the it's not the preacher's voice it's not a prophet's voice as it were it's not any other voice it's a voice that came directly out of the throne but wait God might have used a prophet he might have used a preacher he might have used a good friend whatever it is but God knows how and that voice come forth and tells them praise our God now my brother and sister I want you this morning to take that as it were as a command from God come from the voice of God praise our god what was expected as it was with Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you didn't just sit there and say I don't feel like it today you either praised or you went to the furnace oh boy what did I just say come on my brother and sister look at this this commandment praise our God all ye servants and ye that fear Him both small and great amen Praises is who we are my brother and sister amen we cannot say that we have the Life of Christ and never find ourselves in a state of worship oh it's not gonna happen you're not going to learn to worship when you get on the other side my brother and sister this is I'm a little ahead of myself but this is our season of preparation we're talking about a marriage of a lamb this my brother and sister is our rehearsal now what do we do at a rehearsal we've all been to weddings we've all probably even been a part of one what happens is is as you're coming down and they're saying now the the they're going to come the wedding party and we're going to have the the bride's going to be here and no I want all of them on the Platinum there's not room enough for them all on the platform I'll tell you what we'll do here stop everybody what do we think and we'll have one stand the bridesmaid right here the bride right there and a a another bridesmaid and another bridesmaid and we'll do yeah we can fit them all it looks symmetrical okay now we come up here where do we stop we do we do that we've had weddings here in the church my brother and sister we're human we put little pieces of tape so small most everybody doesn't even notice them and that is you come here and stop and stand here you stand here you stand here how fast that was too fast that you're walking faster than the music slow down no that's too slow that's the right speed now do this we need the the ring bearer needs to come here we want him to do I want him he's my little nephew I want him to be right here part of it so we get him right up here close and we do that and you know we we get all this and we go and we say okay that's good everybody do it again no we kind of lost where we're at do it again we're getting better do it again our rehearsal you say Lord why am I going through this again it's rehearsal time it's our preparation time amen because there's an invitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb and he said I know how to have you and to place you and to put you in exactly the spot you need to be and now go back and do it again and sometimes we say I haven't failed you so miserably Lord it seems like I went through this trial like two or three years ago why am I going through it again come on my brother and sister be happy you are blessed you've been invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb he didn't say you were out of Step get out he said just do it again until we get it right and so God is bringing us into this lovely time of preparation and he's granted this by his grace by his Mercy he's granted us not a one strike in your out but my brother and sister as God applied in his word my brother and sister how many times a day we must forgive each other now if God asks you and I to forgive each other that many times how many times a day would our God want to forgive us I'll tell you it's greater than even what he asked of us because in our failure it magnifies his grace and the grace of God is sufficient for all of our needs amen hallelujah oh and it is my brother and sister no matter whether we are small or great God says I want to hear a little praise from you I want to hear a little Thanksgiving from you I want it to be your voice that comes and you realize in this scripture here the voice of that multitude is you amen God's not got a voice machine somewhere he doesn't have a choir hid behind a curtain he's got a bride that is the voice that is the multitude that is recorded in Revelation 19. it's my voice it's your voice can we be the Fulfillment of the voice that comes as a great thundering of a multitude of people oh help us oh Lord Hallelujah Revelations 22 17 says in the spirit and the bride say come amen there's got to be an echo I'm telling you there's got to be an echo my brother and sister the bride's not out here Lord I told them that they didn't listen no sir The Voice has an echo that comes a great multitude that is saying come amen come this is life come not a voice of human condemning human commanding human but the spirit is speaking and it's the bride's voice that they're hearing amen oh thank you Lord Hallelujah and what are they going to say let them hear us say come and let him that's a thirst come and whosoever will let him take over the Water of Life freely amen no limitation how beautiful God is how beautiful God is amen now you see there's got to be a voice that was designated to be the voice of this multitude and my brother and sister it may be coming from our lips but I'm here to tell you just as God's been laying on my heart and I've been studying this God hears the hearts cry when we deal in our own little personal world right we all have our own little personal world when we're living in our own little personal World God is moving you and I maybe a midnight hour maybe early in the morning late at night at noon time that there's a cry from the heart of the believer there's a heart my brother and sister that's in there it might be a Stony heart at the moment but it's softening it might be a heart that's starting to soften but it needs to soften more maybe it's a heart that's right on the verge of being completely soft but just needs that one last little touch that voice is coming to the throne of almighty God and God says I hear you and I know what you need and I'm the great physician and I will prescribe it exactly what you need and it will change your life oh we say but we're all believers brother Paul I'm telling you I've seen some pretty Stony hearts in Believers and I'm going to tell you how Stony those hearts are I can tell you the very nature of their heart I can tell you that sometimes they'll profess their heart is soft when it's not oh that's judgmental Paul no it is and I was talking about me hmm and the word came and it washed over me and it washed over me and it washed over me it washed over me as the sea is on the rocks or the CHL on the beach my brother and sister just keeps ruashing over washing over and what is it doing it's not judging us in the sense that people say don't judge me don't judge me but it's judging us that we ourselves can see I need wash some more Lord wash me some more Lord I need some more Lord I want to come look I'm not going to show up at the marriage of the lamb in some kind of filthy work clothes I'm not going to show up my brother and sister oh well we won't go there I'll get sidetracked on that amen but there see what it is the the coming from our lips what is it sometimes it's nothing more than our hearts cry it's nothing more than what down inside of us we're groaning but the Holy Ghost can interpret that groaning sometimes you know I get caught up I'll get caught up in thinking of of situations I won't say they're all problems but you're trying to do that and and you know maybe I just hold my breath a little bit too long and I sigh and Jerry's like what what's the sigh about I do the same thing to her she sighs I'm what was a sigh about but sometimes my brother and sister it's just letting go of attention it's just letting go of something and there's a side that comes in the release of that and letting it go and it's there that no one can understand I asked Jerry you know what was the sigh about and she's like I sighed I do the same thing what was that about I I don't know but I'll tell you when you sigh in this Spirit the Holy Ghost is there to interpret that sigh and to say I see the heart is burden I see the heart has desire I see the heart is longing and I understand what they're longing for and they come and then the word of God comes now you want to know where the idea of YouTube and on these other online type things come where you'll be we've seen it it's a little bit spooky you take your phone amen this is my napkin phone hanky phone and you'll have your phone and you'll be talking about you know what brothers we really should organize a Brother's fishing group the sisters are having their little social where they go house to house when they remember and um us Brothers we really ought to organize a Brother's fishing and five minutes later you'll pick your phone up I'm a little older fashion than some of you I'm not really but it's my flip phone and you'll look online there and there'll be 25 different things about fishing on your phone it's scary how do you know we were talking about fishing now my brother and sister we think the devil designed that but the prophet of God said that science broke into God's Laboratory and when we start to express from our heart we start to express the things of God that's why maybe our fellowship should be less about carnal things and more about spiritual things and let the Holy Spirit comes down and discerns that of what we're speaking you know I've got this little Affliction in my flesh I need prayer holy spirit says I'll just come and I'll anoint all anoint and people might wake up at midnight hour amen I'll tell you what my brother and sister God knows how to wake it up and bring the prayers to the throne amen he's not missed out on one thing he hears the hearts cry he brings right down exactly what is needed many times in this church people have said that's exactly what we were reading yesterday or talking about or the scripture I read this morning oh God bless you brother Paul but my brother and sister don't you understand it was the Holy Ghost that heard your heart cry and said I'm going to send an answer right here because the preacher will be oblivious but the Holy Ghost has discerned that because he knows what you need oh thank you Lord Hallelujah and you know my brother and sister it's the voice of the Bride that calls the bridegroom it's a voice of the Bride that calls the master amen it's not the heathens Voice using his name in vain is not the voice that he's hearing he's hearing a bride's voice when she calls on her beloved he's hearing her and says is that not a beautiful sound and her prayers come as a sweet odor before me praise God oh Hallelujah oh Hallelujah amen now look I'll tell you sometimes weddings can be quite the deal sometimes weddings can be a lot of work I've heard people after they got married says you know brother Paul if it wasn't frowned on we would have just went to the justice of peace because it's getting married is a lot of work and it's a lot of money imagine that but I'm telling you you never heard any Holy Ghost filled dad till his daughter just go to the Justice of the Peace what he wants to do is he wants to see his beautiful daughter coming in the beauty of marriage and we've been called to a marriage it's a beautiful thing my brother and sister come on let's be honest it can be a lot of work yeah it can be a lot of work a lot of Labor amen a lot of miles a lot of weary times a lot of things happen along the road but the marriage is beautiful and the marriage my brother and sister it's much more than just a legal document it is a relationship built in the depths of a heart and soul amen it is a connection of two souls and I'll put it to you this way connection of two souls and us being connected to our bridegroom amen not an official paper we can hang it on the wall I joined this we were just looking at a deal the other day a certain church and that's like how do you know Jerry looks it up how do you become a member of the blah blah blah church and so it comes up there and they have shockingly enough we not might need to work on our membership thing we have uh well anyway they have about 10 or 12 pages and they got places for you to initial at each one of these places that you are lined up with this and then you have to give up stand up and give a declaration to the church that you agree with every one of these and will stand in support and can be corrected if you don't and I'm sure that that 10 or 12 Pages causes those people to be righteous and holy but I tell you what causes them to be righteous and holy is that marriage vow being part of that marriage recognizing I'm no longer me I am him amen it's no longer about me it's all about him and my heart's desire is to please him oh Hallelujah yeah let me say it again it's your voice the voice of your heart that calls the master now look at this I need to just move right along amen invisible Union of the bride of Christ brother Gideon take that down real quick before too many read it you know one of our problems we're too worried about what people think that's one of our problems right and if you're sitting there saying well I don't think it's my problem well I'm here to be just direct enough to say I'll guarantee it is we're worried about what others think of us and sometimes we're worried about the man that's the cashier at the hardware store that takes the lord's name in vain 50 75 hundred times a day and we're concerned about how he'll feel about us go ahead and put it up brother Gideon what will the Joneses think if I go to crying and speaking in tongue oh they think if I'm re-baptized what a nonsense are you married to the Joneses or are you married to the church or are you married to Christ the word I'll tell you what my brother and sister my wife has never went out to the store and asked some male Clerk or cash here what do you think of my clothes is that do I look okay like this no she's married to someone and that someone is the one whose opinion matters to her and the church talking about the Believers my brother and sister we're not going to go to the denomination and ask them if they like our Doctrine or not amen we're not married to them we're married to Christ and all we care about is his opinion uh his word his desire his heart's love being poured out to us it's not to the rest of this world amen but we get careful about this oh I don't want to say or do something well I'll tell you what I live in a world where a lot of farmers unfortunately just not to not too religious and I have a reputation out in our area about to be in that religious farmer guy amen you know the guys will be like you know what's it like being a farmer and a pastor almost like if I was a farmer that that is a contradiction to being a pastor or vice versa I just tell them out there you know what you ought not use the lord's name in vain because what you're doing is blaming your problems on God and your problems were created by you and you want to get your life straightened out so your problem will not think in your mind it's God's problem okay Paul I hear a lot I hear a lot of this they'll start pardon my French Paul that did not sound like French had not one bit of a French accent but the point being Saints if we will stand with the one who redeemed us the one who has our soul if we'll stand the world will notice but if we don't stand at all it's not really the direction we're going so I'll just I'll just leave that be so who we married to church yeah amen thank you brother amen what is this all about now this can be a subject that you can say it's already happened or it's happening we're not here to to dissect uh the schematic of this but my brother and sister what it's all about is our pending marriage now some would say now according to the word we're already yes I understand that but I'm making just a point here what is this about our pending marriage amen this is all about us coming see it tells us verse 7 to be glad and rejoice and give honor for the marriages come and his wife have made herself ready I'm telling you what reminds me I've been to a wedding or two in my life you know and uh nobody's really happy with the bride if at the time the wedding's supposed to start she's still trying to figure out which pair of shoes she's wearing under a dress that touches the floor so no one sees the shoes it seems like a irrelevant decision in fact I know a young lady got married here in just the last couple years nobody had a clue but after the wedding there believe her she wasn't in Boston or anything but when they started to take pictures she reaches down and pulls her wedding dress up just far enough she's wearing cowboy boots and I've been to a wedding where the dress was long and when it was all over somebody said something about you've been standing for hours now your feet must be killing you she pulled her dress up she had no shoes at all on hmm my my brother and sister we're getting ready for a wedding now you won't find a reference here in Revelations 19 about the shoes they're wearing but the scripture does say that our feet would be shawed with the gospel amen there's where it really comes down the gospel so if we don't have the gospel where are we walking now I'm I'm purposely jumping over some of this so you can fill in some of the blanks yourself now my brother and sisters I've already went what is rehearsal time it's when all the wrinkles are worked out hey man it's when all of that you have to decide you know I remember being at a wedding one time or at a rehearsal and they had all these cute little cute little candle things their aisle was probably no bigger than our Church's aisle these cute little candle stands at every row amen and nobody give it a thought until the morning of the wedding and here comes this young lady who's got a dress that is so wide and so there that there is a couple little girls have to hold on to the back of it because she can't drag it and they started in the back of the church and the first set of candle holders and then that can set a candle holders and they had to stop and do a little revision right there that's what rehearsal's for amen when God calls this bride and she's responding to the call and he's not looking for her to stop and say we've got to re uh what is that re uh calculate or whatever you know when your computer does this little thing amen he wants us to work this out he wants us to be ready he wants us to think of every detail and the manual that he gave us to be ready for the marriage has every detail in it so that we are not there saying I didn't know I didn't realize I didn't see it's all there now my brother and sister let me skip on here time is just flying amen hallelujah what was it that she was granted to be a raid in fine linen amen and not some grubby old uh dress to be drug in the dirt right but fine linen clean and white for fine linen is a righteousness of the Saints and I'm telling you what this message has come what it's done and I hope this doesn't hurt anybody's feelings but my brother and sister if you want to know how to get yourself ready for this marriage you go and read God's tutorial on making a rapture how to dress for the Rapture it's right here amen we don't have to come and say but I didn't know it's right here church amen a lovely God tube amen tutorial how to be dressed for the rapture amen but what Satan want to do I'll tell you what Satan wants to do he wants to give you and I a second hand robe he wants us to come the prophet of God deals with this not very much but he he deals with this my brother and sister I'll read it to you in a minute but God is not here to give you and I a second-hand revelation of the word of the hour he's not here to give us a prophet's revelation of the word of the hour a pastor's Revelation evangelist Revelation he's here to give you your Revelation he's here to give you the full measure full anointed of the word of God for you not from everybody else but you can say my soul's not happy I've got a remedy I have questions I have answers I have a need here it is not somebody just telling you of you this and you that you know it'll happen but to catch it a first hand rolled a new robe a fresh robe a clean robe God's robe Hallelujah oh once again I want to say can we say we're blessed this morning amen I'll tell you it's a blessing according to the scripture verse 9 that you're blessed just because you're called to this marriage I'm going to say Thank you Lord I feel blessed this morning oh it's been stirring in my soul I might seem a little over excited excuse me but when I wake up in the morning realizing I am blessed not every day is a good day my brother and sister I won't go into details but yesterday I was trying to fix something you know and and as I'm trying to fix something I broke something that cost 10 times as much money and we could just call that normal or I could sit down and say ah the devil did that it wasn't the devil that had his hands on that don't call me the devil come on God must be angry at me he allowed that to happen no if I ever have to go to that again I will remember don't do that come on somebody can say Amen yeah what is it this is rehearsal time amen I'll tell you what happened just let me go through this little personal tidbit of things you don't do at marriages I was a little kid I was invited to a marriage Margaret Taylor's amen and I'm there and that everybody's all excited when they come out and they're presenting them out in the yard and a kid behind me shoved me and I lost my balance and I stepped on Margaret's wedding dress and tore it Margaret's never forgot it and neither have I there are some things you don't do and one thing I will never do and don't do to this day is when the bride is walking with her dress I'm moving the other direction amen because I am not going to get pushed by someone and leave my footprint on her dress what is it my fault only reason it'd be my fault is I was there and I got too close but what's wrong they were dozens and dozens of people too close I hope you catch this but all those dozens and dozens I was the only one that lost his balance and stepped on her dress now whoever it was behind me I was upset I was gonna tear into him only there's a bunch of faces and it wasn't until after I got over being ashamed that I comprehended that it was my fault nobody else's footprint yeah yeah and when I broke what I broke yesterday it would have been easy to say oh devil but I'm the one that had the tool hooked on that thing was wrenching on it my brother and sister sometimes we got to just learn we're in the rehearsal and God's working these things out I don't want to make this about me but I want to make this point some time back there was a man in our shop while we're working I smashed my thumb to where it turned absolutely black and blue and had a big blood blister on the end and when I did that I jerked my hand back and I grunted and this man standing there and kind of mockingly but yet in a friendly way he goes Paul I know you don't talk like that do I need to supply the words for you no no the grunt the grunt was enough the grunt expressed everything I needed expressed and sometimes just a simple Lord help me help me Lord expresses everything we need to express because the Holy Ghost is there to say I know how you feel I know the pain in your heart I know the pain in your life I know the pain of your circumstance hmm well I had more stuff here than I thought I literally thought man we'll be out of here sister Jerry tells me at home don't ever say that again I want to make a real quick point to you I'm going to just bounce through this if you don't catch it raise your hand amen but we look at John 1 right now John 1 is laying the whole Foundation that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God right so it gives us a very clear establishment of the relationship of the written word and our God Amen and so it's there that we can identify and do this and this is why uh Acts 2 38 is brought to life amen that we can look at Matthew 28 19 and say absolutely I believe 28 19. now if you're ever talking to a trinitarian and they get stumbled when you say I believe every drop of Matthew 28 19 because they believe if you believe Acts 2 38 you must be rejecting acts uh Matthew 28 19 but actually it's quite the opposite amen so Satan has put the spin on this flip this over made it sound like if you don't believe 28 19 like they do that somehow you're denying the word of God but my brother and sister it's quite the opposite now we'll see now this establishment that the word is God and God is the word and verse 14 says that the word was made Flash and dwelt Among Us amen and I tell you by the prophecy of the word in our hour amen the opening of the seventh seal we are not to add one word to the Bible but I want to add one word to your understanding and when it says that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we could put a parenthesis and the Word was made flesh and dwelt in US amen that's what the whole goal the whole desire of God was for the word to be in us and we'll look at that and say my okay there it is this is the time this is a place uh God in us amen there it is but look the word has already been with us and you look at this now to see the expression of this would be first John 1 and so we went from John 1 to First John 1 that which was from the beginning hmm not in a recent understanding not in the current Revelation that we just got but thou was from the beginning which we have heard and we have seen we've looked upon it our hands have handled it the word of life oh my my brother and sister what is this all the way out of the Book of Revelation which is the culmination or closing of the age and time the word is telling us you've already seen him already handled him you've already had him in your midst he's already with you it's already done it's not an appearing here in Matthew 19 or in Matthew 20 2 he's already here it's already been manifested to us and we have seen the word of life and it's been visible before us oh thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah we're coming right down to the end here I got kind of a lengthy little lengthy little reading here is that okay Amen in communion 1965 12 12 65 prophets very close to going off scene kind of sad he went off the scene didn't he 1965 1212. I would have been four years and five days old and if he was still alive today we would be such an immature bride brother Brian was it okay if I buy a red car brother Brandon what about this brother Brown what about that brother brother Brown was it would it be wrong to invest in a business and somehow end up rich what about brother brother brother Brown of course don't worry about it you'd never talk to him because they would be about 2.7 million people in front of you are you getting my point God said I've given you the word now it's time bride grow up Lord I want to grow up yes sir I want your wisdom I want your nature I want your life I want revelation amen yeah and sometimes we have to go dig for those things they don't just appear to us you know the hour will soon arise when right Among Us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did and ananias and Sapphira now I want to just put a little word in my brother and sister Grace Tabernacle put your seat belt on because that day is coming amen amen it's already starting to work it's already not necessarily out into the public but God is already dealing in the church so Direct that people are realizing that was me you know we usually do quite the opposite can I have just a couple more minutes we usually do quite the opposite the preacher starts preaching kind of hard and we're like well why why is he preaching to me like that uh uh when the holy spirit moves and starts to speak out like it did in ananiasis fire there's going to be a bride that actually says Lord I needed that Lord that distort the height off of me but Lord I needed that help me help me and then there'll be those that get angry and walk away you notice what ananias and Sapphira they were actually given the window the moment of time almost like the policeman would you like to change your story no then why is there blood on your clothes when you say you had nothing to do with it but you see once they give them the opportunity to change the story and that time that door is closed then everything they say is held against us and God loves this bride so much he's bringing us in the rehearsal time the ability to stop and say Lord I want to change the directive of my life amen I want to change my story from what a drunk I was what are this I was and what of that I was I want to change it so when the Holy Ghost comes my brother and sister and says would you like to change your story don't be thinking somebody's trying to trick you stand up lift your hands and say Lord I want to change my story I want my story to be one of grace and mercy I want a story to be one of the blood flowing over me of a life consecrated that I can say not boastfully but Lord thank you for the fine linen thank you Lord that I can show up at the wedding at the marriage supper not looking like a hobo not out here with a filth of the alleys of laodicea but in clothes that are perfect and spotless before God oh Hallelujah amen now the hours arriving see now just remember that see God is going to dwell among his people see this is a consequence my brother and sister I use the word consequence but I believe you understand what I'm talking about we say Lord will you come dwell amongst us do we not Saints do we not ask the Lord come be in the service with us today amen and when we ask him to be in the service with us today we were asking him to point out our faults and our failure to point out but he's standing there saying this is a problem and here is my blood and it's the solution don't run from this run into it oh Hallelujah see God's going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now and we can receive the message as saying if I was a young man hunting for a wife I could find a wife I say she's just perfect she's Christian she's a lady she's all this confidence no matter how much confidence how much I think she's nice I've got to receive her and she's got to receive me upon these vows I don't think it'd be very funny my brother and sister as a Young Man let me just throw something out okay let me get this off my chest I see people at the second greatest blessing God would ever give a man or a woman in their life second greatest blessing the first is receiving the Holy Ghost and make mockery of their weddings shoving cake in faces doing all kinds of antics young people the Lord tarries I know the day will come please don't make an End tick don't make a show out of your marriage amen amen it's a very solemn thing to be enjoyed of oppressed memory and I'll just back it up with a little story of a man I knew when they got married they just it's like a bunch out of control uh message people and they just smashed cake in each other's face like you can't believe oh here's the cake and they're like remember what we agreed and he just smashed it in her face and then you could see her have a little temper tantrum and she smashed it in his face if you is to go to their house today you will not find a single picture of the cake because they're ashamed they're not proud they don't look back and say oh look what we did now they recognize the value of the vowel and of the marriage and realize that was symbolic of our relationship with God does that know what the word says natural marriage is symbolic of our relationship with God oh yeah God just just take it come on young people I hope this registers deep in your soul young ladies don't marry a man that make that kind of a mockery out of your wedding and young men don't marry a young lady that would make that kind of mockery out of your marriage might be the right guy just not right season maybe just need to grow up amen now I'll take the sting out of that sister Jerry and I have concluded that if we had waited about four years more to get married I would have been grown up so you look at this and realize but there's a maturity amen amen that comes that places value immaturity doesn't place value maturity places value I'll get all sidetracked see this young man hunting for a wife amen she's got to accept him and he's got to accept her well it's the same thing we find is the message we see it's right we see God vindicates it's right it's perfectly right year after year year after year and my brother and sister the critic would say brother Branham was boasting of his own Ministry I'm here to tell you year after year year after year year after year God is proving this to be true proving it to be real it's valid and it's powerful it's a supernatural amen either that I'm completely crazy and don't have a clue no comments because I know that I am sane and I have seen the power of God Vindicated in my own little world yeah remember Great and Small I'm not ashamed to say I'm one of those small ones but the same power of the word come to the small one amen has come to the great amen amen amen okay it continues right continues right everything it says happens just exactly the way he said amen now we know it's right but see don't do it from an intellectual standpoint if you do you've got a second-handed religion see we don't want a second-handed religion something that somebody else has experienced and we are living off of their testimony I'm telling you I'm going to just throw this out I was just very temperate about saying this but I'm going to we have seen men in this message who have quit men that were ministers men that had at times in their life very very uh profound good beneficial Ministries but you'll find in the relationship of their life they often were anchored in spoke of spoke highly of the ministry of their fathers what they had was second hand and when the ministry of their fathers who were off the scene ran out they had nothing to make the next step now how many of you we experienced this a little bit in Israel amen some of those hikes we took I'm sitting there you know I'm thinking why in the world did I sign up for I paid brother George money to do this now none of you say a word to the cops they're they're getting ready there they've got that little hill behind their house and they're out there every day walking around that thing multiples of times because sister Jerry was really expressive I loved how sister Jerry was so eloquent she's just there look sister Cherry if you guys don't start exercising you're gonna suffer it was just really nice and smooth the way she presented that and they all look shocked like like like what yeah no like you guys better start mountain climbing if you're gonna survive this amen oh I'll tell you my brother and sister so what it is we come to a time and I I think we shouldn't be ashamed to lift a hand and say I have come to the time I thought it was my last step I could go no further Can someone say amen for that we've been there now if it is in your mama or your daddy or the preacher or whatever my brother and sister that will in fact be your last step but when you are in Christ and you are there don't have strength enough to lift your foot for one more step but it's not you it's Christ in you and you'll find at the end of the day you've kept going and Higher and Higher and Higher you're climbing in Christ and you'll look Mark and realize if it had been Me In the Flesh I would have been finished years ago but it's not me it's Christ in me oh Hallelujah amen yes look at this now we don't want a second-handed religion something that somebody else experienced and we're living off of their testimony I believe it was Jesus said to pilate amen I can guarantee you that brother Brown knew this well he was just in a flux maybe of his mind something a word I was thinking he said there was just a few moments ago who told you that or was it revealed to you how do you know these things in other words I don't know just what the word is now it's been a long time since I read it but how did you know this what how who revealed this to you about him being the Son of God who revealed it to you did some man tell you that or as Jesus said is it my Father in Heaven which has revealed it to you I want to be able to say today Saints it was my Father in Heaven amen it wasn't me amen I didn't write my own invitation to the marriage supper it was him all the time says I want you to be there I'm gonna make a way for you to be there I'm gonna set your plates at the table I'm gonna have the food for you oh Hallelujah oh my oh my did some man tell you reveal it to you see how did you learn it second-handed or is it a perfect Revelation from God I want my wedding invitation to be a perfect Revelation from God amen I tell you I am blessed to know men in this message sisters families in this message they encourage me I draw strength from them but when it comes down to the final say it needs to come from my father and he shall come from the King of Kings the Lord of lords it needs to come down that I recognize I was called To Praise Him amen not to say somebody else I'm introvert I can't praise you're a daughter of God you're a Son of God you can praise I'm this I'm that forget that you're a daughter of God with an invitation in your hand and in your heart oh hallelujah hallelujah sister Sarah would you come amen amen oh every time I tell myself it'll be short amen oh brother Gideon 821 Hallelujah oh Hallelujah let's just stand and Worship the Lord I trust

Gideon amen [Music] we shall see the king I'm telling you Saints it's so beautiful just talking to a friend a few days ago this is a man I've traveled across the United States in a semi doing a favor for him he always wondered he knows my wife he knows my children we're rolling across Nebraska in a semi he looks over from the passenger seat and says Paul remind me again by your wife and your daughters wear dresses and have long hair [Music] that was the biggest question he ever asked in his life I think it took me about 900 miles to explain it to him [Music] and it broke my heart then he just turned at the end of the day and said Paul thank you but I'm a Baptist [Music] you see Saints I have no such identification I am a Christian I am the bride of Jesus Christ [Music] amen I call Grace Tabernacle my church home and I call you my church family no such defining affiliation outside of Jesus Christ there's a blessed time that's coming coming soon [Music] the wedding of the Bride United with the groom oh we shall see the King when he shall see the king we shall see the king we shall see the King when he comes Will hail the Blessed hour or we shall see the key [Music] save your

was good to be in the house of God today Hallelujah just turn and greet one another amen greet one another is your dismissed and I pray amen I should have went on and read the rest of this last quote I just want to say this in closing not as condemnation but the prophet of God goes on to say and this is why we take communion because it is a person relationship a personal revelation with Jesus Christ I want to encourage each and every one say brother Paul I make mistakes I don't feel like sex should take communion because I've made mistakes well let's just go back you know we declare this to be the guide to be ready for the Rapture go read the manual on repentance it's not a 30 day or a 90 day or a six month process I remember brother Chris it's anchored very much in my heart others it anchored you remember that brother Chris maybe maybe not doesn't know where I'm going another Chris Express what is it repentance you're going the wrong direction and you stop and say Lord forgive me you turn and you go back the other direction I want each one of you to consider that the prophet of God said communion was an expression of your relationship with Jesus Christ my wife and I's relationship isn't always good oh no don't misunderstand me I might be overstating it a little bit people say well you guys fuss a little bit no actually you misunderstood we just let it off we don't hold it in we let it off oh but that doesn't look right well I'm not married to you [Music] let it off Lord my attitude my spirit I have this issue I have this issue Lord forgive me Let It Off let it off and go forward God bless your Saints we love you in the Lord see you tonight [Music] thank you
