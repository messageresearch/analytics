[38:32] [Music]
[38:37] you know the scripture talks about satan
[38:40] being a thief in the night
[38:42] coming says if the good man had known
[38:45] the
[38:46] hour he would have been prepared aren't
[38:48] you glad today
[38:50] god's making us ready he's he's speaking
[38:53] to our hearts this season
[38:55] we recognize the world we live in
[38:59] you know it's interesting the focus that
[39:02] we
[39:03] even can have but certainly the world
[39:06] and you know they've chosen
[39:10] to be offended at everything
[39:14] they're they're offended at cartoons
[39:16] make believe
[39:17] they're offended and yet
[39:20] the word of god said that we as sons and
[39:23] daughters of god
[39:24] would not be offended
[39:27] that if someone would even speak ill of
[39:29] us we would be in such a position
[39:32] that we would say lord forgive them they
[39:34] don't even know what they're doing
[39:36] just forgive them just to be the very
[39:38] nature of of christ and
[39:41] you know there's a message my brother
[39:42] and sister you know
[39:44] uh i i you know look at the news online
[39:47] sometimes and
[39:49] i'm kind of even getting discouraged to
[39:50] do that because
[39:52] you read the news online you're almost
[39:55] afraid to look out the window of your
[39:56] own house because surely everything has
[39:58] fallen down and is destroyed
[40:01] you see there's a message that is being
[40:04] preached
[40:06] but there's another message amen there's
[40:10] a message for those of the redeemed
[40:13] a message for those of the rejecters
[40:16] and by god's grace we're able to take
[40:19] that message of the redeemed and
[40:21] we're able to look at that and the devil
[40:24] would say that can't be you
[40:26] but we'll look at the word and the word
[40:28] says it is you
[40:30] i'm not talking to someone else i'm
[40:32] talking to you
[40:33] and this morning as we just move on into
[40:36] our our thought
[40:37] over all of redemption's manifestation
[40:39] right
[40:40] redemption my brother and sister god the
[40:42] bible tells us not to hide it under a
[40:44] bushel
[40:45] right live it openly now god's not going
[40:49] to let his redemptive power the
[40:51] manifestation of the redemptive word
[40:54] be hidden it will be revealed
[40:57] now whether the world listens the world
[40:59] looks the world even
[41:00] cares or if they decide to be your
[41:03] critic
[41:04] that's right but even then the prophet
[41:06] of god says you have to go through the
[41:08] hall of critics
[41:09] amen before you get recognized
[41:13] as a masterpiece and so we look at that
[41:16] and
[41:16] just remember whose voice we're
[41:18] listening to amen remember the voice we
[41:20] should be listening to let me put it
[41:22] that way
[41:23] you listen to the world that will bring
[41:25] what the world wants you to be
[41:27] amen you know reading a little article
[41:31] uh well several articles actually
[41:33] there's quite a bit of information
[41:35] but come across this article the man is
[41:37] talking about holiness
[41:39] is dead
[41:43] and you think now how can that be but
[41:45] when you read the article i think he was
[41:47] very
[41:48] well balanced he says what's happened is
[41:50] is instead of facing the issues of our
[41:52] day our church has compromised and
[41:54] compromised and compromised
[41:56] and we don't want our sisters to feel
[41:58] like they're awkward and out of place in
[42:00] this world so we've set
[42:02] no standard we've lowered it so low we
[42:05] now set no
[42:06] standard amen
[42:10] so who killed holiness
[42:14] we can ultimately take it back to the
[42:16] devil right
[42:19] but the prophet of god said it was weak
[42:21] pulpits
[42:23] it was people who would not preach the
[42:25] pure word of god
[42:28] and while they say holiness is dead i'm
[42:30] here to tell you today
[42:32] christ our lord jesus christ is holiness
[42:37] so if they claim holiness is dead
[42:39] they're saying he's dead
[42:42] i say he liveth i say he's alive and
[42:45] well in the midst of his church
[42:48] stronger than ever manifesting himself
[42:50] stronger than ever
[42:52] and you say oh how can you say that well
[42:54] because there's this people
[42:56] you might have met them something down
[42:59] inside of them
[43:00] says i want the word amen i don't need
[43:04] it
[43:04] in portion i don't need it in just some
[43:06] measure i want
[43:07] the word and i'm willing
[43:11] to do whatever it takes just reading
[43:14] about the queen of sheba
[43:15] the prophet of god said you know she'll
[43:18] come one day
[43:19] and judge if no more than the fact that
[43:21] people won't even
[43:23] cross the street to go to church and she
[43:25] crossed the deserts
[43:27] he said she'll be there that day to
[43:30] judge them
[43:31] for their lack of sincerity oh my
[43:35] god help us because we live in a day
[43:37] that says well
[43:38] sure i mean i i can i can do whatever i
[43:41] want still believe there's a god well
[43:43] of course the devil believes there's a
[43:46] god
[43:46] he's met him face to face and he's
[43:48] afraid of him
[43:50] hallelujah and we'll touch a little bit
[43:52] later on that something beautiful
[43:54] i pray today god bless you each and
[43:57] every one sister rachel good to see you
[44:00] i'm an embarrasser a little bit there
[44:01] was a time that she was just this sweet
[44:04] girl that thought brother paul was
[44:05] pretty cool
[44:06] and uh you know she's grown up now we'll
[44:10] have to see if she still feels that way
[44:12] or not
[44:12] but uh god bless you it's good to see
[44:14] you again
[44:15] amen she's looking at me like oh boy do
[44:18] i owe you
[44:20] amen well hallelujah that's one of the
[44:23] privileges we have as we get older you
[44:25] can just write it off to senality or
[44:28] whatever you want but it is
[44:31] i i'm really church i i hope you don't
[44:34] mind but i'm really embracing this uh
[44:36] older bolder thing amen you know um
[44:40] you know you know
[44:43] i don't remember who said it here
[44:45] recently but somebody made a comment to
[44:47] me oh my it was my daughter kristen
[44:49] she makes this just off the wall comment
[44:51] she goes oh i'm sorry dad that was my
[44:54] inner voice
[44:58] well hallelujah i think my inner voice
[44:59] is escaping
[45:01] but you know what i want to bring that
[45:04] turn that around not just his humor
[45:06] but see the devil tries to get us to
[45:08] think about mortgage and
[45:10] jobs and this and that but there's
[45:12] another voice
[45:14] there the voice of the beloved is
[45:16] speaking to the bride
[45:17] and he believed it and ordained it so
[45:20] much he said the spirit
[45:23] and the bride say come see it won't be
[45:26] that outer
[45:27] carnal voice the man that labors and is
[45:30] tired you know like our brother
[45:32] tim gets up in in the wee hours of the
[45:35] morning
[45:36] goes to work and goes right down there
[45:38] and has to immerse himself in all the
[45:39] craziness
[45:41] of all the world coming into the store
[45:44] and
[45:44] and dealing with that i can say thank
[45:47] you lord that i just have to deal with
[45:48] the craziness of my own family
[45:51] but um but you see my brother and sister
[45:54] we're looking in a
[45:55] day that they have a voice they would
[45:58] love you to speak they would love for
[46:00] you to speak their
[46:00] their words they want to hear their
[46:02] opinion come from your mouth
[46:05] but you see we have an inner voice
[46:06] that's speaking and it says
[46:08] you are my beloved you are my beloved i
[46:10] love you lord
[46:12] each and every day we just voice that i
[46:14] love you lord
[46:15] thank you lord for your grace and mercy
[46:18] amen
[46:19] hallelujah let's just stand as we go in
[46:21] the word i want to speak to you this
[46:23] morning on the message of life
[46:24] amen amen you know there is a time
[46:28] a day a season that we come and the
[46:30] words of life have been spoken
[46:33] and uh you know i have advocated for
[46:36] years and i
[46:37] just listening to the prophet the other
[46:39] day reinforces it once again when the
[46:42] prophet of god talks about free moral
[46:44] agency
[46:45] and i'm a firm believer just an absolute
[46:49] staunch believer in free moral agency
[46:52] every one of us ought to do what our
[46:54] heart desires amen if our heart desires
[46:57] i was joking with jerry on the way to
[46:58] town we were passed by all kinds of
[47:00] polaris razors
[47:02] jet boats uh jacked up jeeps jacked up
[47:05] pickups
[47:06] dirt bikes all going there and as we're
[47:08] going there i told jerry it says they're
[47:10] going to the church of the oahe's
[47:12] that's right see that's that's where
[47:16] they want to commune at
[47:17] that's where their heart is at now we're
[47:20] not talking about celebrating a holiday
[47:22] and going and doing things right we're
[47:23] talking about
[47:24] this becomes religion in the day we have
[47:27] the prophet of god speaks about that
[47:29] letting off the pressure they come to
[47:30] attack we've got to deal with
[47:32] the cares of life and so they buy more
[47:35] they go in debt and they have to work
[47:37] more and the stress is greater so they
[47:39] have to play
[47:39] harder
[47:45] i i won't try to quote the whole thing
[47:47] in its entirety because i always mess it
[47:49] up
[47:50] but there's this circle that it just the
[47:52] whole peridium shift of that circle is
[47:54] and
[47:55] and um i i'll find that again and share
[47:58] it with you
[47:59] but it's talking about how that uh we
[48:01] play at church and
[48:03] we made work or religion or recreation i
[48:06] don't remember which one was our
[48:08] religion
[48:08] and it was just a shift like you had it
[48:10] on a graph and then you just turned it a
[48:12] little bit and
[48:13] so we play at church and we work it
[48:16] other things and
[48:17] you know we do that but see there's a
[48:20] message of life that has come and
[48:22] you see my brother and sister you know
[48:24] just sometimes you you bump up against
[48:26] these things and people say well
[48:28] paul we understand you're just a staunch
[48:30] supporter or defender of the message
[48:33] well you could say that it might appear
[48:35] that way saints but
[48:37] actually it's just simply it looks like
[48:38] i'm defending it
[48:40] because i just believe it with all
[48:42] that's within me amen
[48:44] i haven't left you know in the in the
[48:46] realm of the pie i haven't
[48:48] left a little undecided in the pie
[48:52] see if you leave a little undecided in
[48:55] the pie
[48:55] then there's room to fill that with
[48:57] something else
[48:59] but god wants us to just be sold out is
[49:02] god real
[49:03] amen is god present amen
[49:06] is he in me amen do we have the holy
[49:09] ghost amen
[49:10] oh wait but i had trouble yesterday and
[49:13] i got upset and i just no
[49:14] sorry amen
[49:20] hallelujah james the first chapter
[49:24] verses 21-25
[49:28] as i said speak to you this morning on a
[49:30] message of life
[49:38] good to be a christian today amen
[49:45] it's also good to go to church with
[49:46] people you like
[49:51] wherefore lay a part of filthiness and
[49:53] superfluity of naughtiness
[49:56] in other words all little sideline
[49:59] things where you say i really ought not
[50:03] be doing this
[50:05] but i'm going to do it anyhow
[50:08] that's the super superfluity of
[50:10] naughtiness receive with meekness the
[50:13] engrafted word
[50:15] which is able to save your souls but be
[50:18] ye doers of the word and not hearers
[50:20] only
[50:21] deceiving your own selves now i i don't
[50:24] this is not our focus i want to just
[50:26] interject this right now my brother and
[50:29] sister there'll
[50:29] be a lot of people that will stand up
[50:31] one day
[50:33] and they'll say lord um i i thought i
[50:35] was doing right
[50:36] you know the preacher the church the
[50:38] religion deceived me
[50:40] but you see they have the same bible
[50:44] they have every ample opportunity to dig
[50:47] into it they have the opportunity to
[50:49] pray for revelation
[50:51] they have all these opportunities
[50:54] but i know none of you do this but i do
[50:57] okay did i take a stress off of you you
[51:00] don't do this but i do
[51:04] when we have made a mess
[51:08] we look for someone to be the root cause
[51:11] that's right of our problem
[51:15] lord this woman
[51:18] thou has given me
[51:22] what was adam doing pushing
[51:25] responsibility from himself
[51:28] over to eve that's right was there a bit
[51:31] of
[51:32] truth in that of course but you see when
[51:36] we stand before him on that day there
[51:38] won't be
[51:39] any superfluities
[51:42] it will be a stark reality
[51:45] [Music]
[51:46] so we don't have to you know take what
[51:48] appears or what looks or what could be
[51:50] or whatever the stark reality is there
[51:54] so we're being told to just do away with
[51:56] all this stuff that's not the stark
[51:58] reality
[51:59] and be doers of the word not hearers
[52:01] only deceiving our own selves
[52:04] for if any be a hearer of the word and
[52:06] not a doer he is like unto a man
[52:09] be holding his natural face in a glass
[52:11] which in this case
[52:12] is a mirror for he beholdeth himself and
[52:15] goeth
[52:16] his way and straightway forgetteth what
[52:19] manner of man he was
[52:21] but who so looketh into the perfect law
[52:24] of liberty now i want you to understand
[52:28] my brother and sister we'll preach on
[52:29] this here touch on this
[52:31] but i want you to understand that we can
[52:33] type these scriptures right here
[52:36] as looking into this mirror right his
[52:39] natural face in a glass
[52:41] carnal natural but when we look into the
[52:44] perfect law of liberty we've now stepped
[52:46] over into the spiritual amen
[52:48] amen that's right amen
[52:53] who so looketh into the perfect law of
[52:55] liberty and continueth
[52:56] therein see a very important ingredient
[53:00] you look into of liberty you can't just
[53:02] say okay i see jesus died on the cross
[53:04] he saved sinners i believe in him okay
[53:06] it's all done
[53:07] but you've got to continue in that he
[53:10] being not a forgetful here but a doer of
[53:13] the work
[53:14] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[53:17] who wants to be blessed today i tell you
[53:20] i want to be blessed
[53:21] heavenly father we ask you to come this
[53:23] morning lord
[53:25] just guide my words lord let me speak to
[53:27] the needs of your people
[53:28] encouraging them strengthening them lord
[53:31] father that yes we make mistakes the
[53:34] father will place them under the blood
[53:36] and we will press forward
[53:38] knowing that we are not identified by
[53:41] our mistakes
[53:42] but we are identified by the blood lord
[53:46] and we thank you today that we can claim
[53:48] that
[53:48] and it's not just something lord we
[53:50] claim but the blood has become
[53:52] us and we have become the blood amen
[53:55] lord we thank you for this opportunity
[53:57] to come and serve you today
[53:59] to worship you give praise and glory and
[54:01] honor today
[54:02] ask you to bless each and every one in
[54:04] the name of jesus christ
[54:06] amen you may be seated
[54:13] you know as we look at this verse 23
[54:18] if any man be a hearer but not a doer
[54:21] and
[54:21] you know often times we we can just type
[54:25] these things back into
[54:26] our natural life and um
[54:30] you know there's just so many examples
[54:32] it would be hard
[54:33] to find a place to start and stop but
[54:36] you know often times we will hear
[54:39] direction
[54:40] whether it be in the home as children as
[54:43] a husband and wife back and forth
[54:47] an employer to an employee we hear
[54:50] something but we fail to respond to it
[54:53] we fail to be a doer of that you say
[54:56] well i said
[54:57] okay or sure honey or whatever but you
[54:59] see
[55:00] if you don't follow through it's the
[55:02] same as not doing it
[55:04] and so we'll find all of these things um
[55:07] that that uh go back and forth of of
[55:10] being a hearer but not a doer
[55:12] and we will find as we look at this uh
[55:15] the mirror
[55:16] image that is here in uh verse 23
[55:20] uh we have to ask ourself what is the
[55:22] reflection
[55:24] in the mirror
[55:27] with these thoughts in mind this morning
[55:29] i told sister jerry's we're getting
[55:31] ready for
[55:32] church i said you know
[55:36] we've yet to get a mirror put up in in
[55:38] our
[55:39] our new bathroom uh we have this little
[55:42] mirror it's at an
[55:43] angle you kind of have to stand weird to
[55:45] look in it and i told jerry i said i'm
[55:47] not
[55:48] liking this and she's why and i'm
[55:49] looking into the mirror all i see is an
[55:51] old man
[55:54] but you see that's the natural
[55:57] i can look into the mirror of god's word
[56:01] and i see a new man
[56:05] i see a new creature in christ jesus i i
[56:08] don't see an
[56:09] old man i don't see a tired man i don't
[56:12] see
[56:12] you can run down through the list a
[56:14] discouraged man of this man or that man
[56:16] but you look through you see what is the
[56:18] reflection
[56:20] uh that we see in the mirror and we'll
[56:22] just look at this on the natural side
[56:24] first and my brother and sister we'll
[56:27] look into the mirror and
[56:28] and pardon me if i sound just very human
[56:31] this morning but
[56:32] you know when you get older your skin
[56:34] doesn't you know you don't have to worry
[56:36] about things like acne so much you know
[56:38] what you got to do is worry about how
[56:40] deep that wrinkle is getting
[56:42] and uh you know it's like they there's
[56:45] little things online they say well you
[56:46] won't get wrinkles don't smile
[56:50] then you won't have any smile wrinkles
[56:52] don't laugh
[56:53] you won't have any laugh wrinkles don't
[56:55] squint you won't have any squint
[56:57] wrinkles i don't know what these people
[56:59] do with themselves
[57:03] you look at this and realize that in the
[57:06] natural side of life we'll look in a
[57:08] mirror and
[57:08] let's just pick on the young people and
[57:10] you know there's a stage i think
[57:12] probably every young person has you know
[57:14] and
[57:15] they have a little acne here and there
[57:16] and they look in the mirror and
[57:18] they they want to deal with that they
[57:19] want to hide it or they want to do
[57:22] you know something they don't want to
[57:24] just walk around with this and we look
[57:26] in the mirror and as time progresses we
[57:28] have different things or stages of our
[57:30] life
[57:31] in the natural that we look in the
[57:32] mirror and you know maybe the the first
[57:34] gray hairs become a
[57:36] shock to you and you know you you want
[57:40] to
[57:40] to do something you know uh now you know
[57:43] i love you sisters
[57:45] but that's why clairol was invented is
[57:47] because we couldn't deal with the gray
[57:49] hairs
[57:51] and then it come over and got on the men
[57:53] and so they had to have grecian formula
[57:55] because they couldn't look in the mirror
[57:57] and deal with their gray hair
[57:58] but i'm telling you what's worse than
[58:00] gray hair is no hair at all
[58:03] and so you know as you look at that if
[58:05] your hair is gray thank god for it
[58:08] because you still have hair
[58:10] but you look at this and as we go
[58:12] through and i mean this a little bit
[58:13] humorous but
[58:14] i want to take this into a serious note
[58:16] as we look through life in the natural
[58:18] we find ourselves
[58:20] looking in the mirror and finding
[58:22] something constantly
[58:24] for us to change or to focus or to do
[58:28] i need to whiten my teeth i wish my nose
[58:30] wasn't so pointed i
[58:31] i but this and i did that i was joking
[58:33] with my daughter jolin remember them in
[58:35] prayer forgot to put the request in
[58:37] they're not feeling good today
[58:38] but you know and i joked with my
[58:40] daughter jolin the other day and
[58:42] i said you know honey i'm not even 100
[58:46] sure you're my daughter and she turned
[58:47] profile to me and touch the end of her
[58:49] nose and says there is
[58:51] no doubt
[58:52] [Laughter]
[58:58] i don't know she doesn't seem to have a
[59:00] complex with her nose i think it must be
[59:02] me that has a complex
[59:04] with the nose but you know we marvel
[59:07] we've got cousins and second cousins and
[59:09] all of this and
[59:10] and you know people say i i never say
[59:13] this in public but
[59:14] are they related to you look at the nose
[59:18] because there's something about us in
[59:21] the natural
[59:22] we will always want to change
[59:32] don't go home and bust your mirror
[59:38] let that be a foundation to recognize
[59:40] that when we look into the mirror
[59:42] spiritually
[59:44] if we look into that mirror and we don't
[59:46] see something we want to change then
[59:48] we've come
[59:49] under a delusion just as it is in the
[59:52] natural
[59:53] my brother and sister if someone it
[59:55] always sounds better when we blame it on
[59:57] the ladies
[59:58] but they would look in the mirror and
[59:59] say i am perfect you would say they are
[1:00:01] vain
[1:00:03] and when we look in a spiritual mirror
[1:00:06] and we say i am perfect
[1:00:08] we are vain there is an image
[1:00:12] that reflects back to us and what we
[1:00:15] need to do is make sure the image
[1:00:17] reflecting
[1:00:17] back is not an image of the carnal man
[1:00:23] but it is of the image of the spiritual
[1:00:25] man
[1:00:26] that that image and you see we are being
[1:00:29] changed the scripture
[1:00:30] says day by day into his image
[1:00:33] and so we should look in the mirror and
[1:00:35] be able each day
[1:00:37] to see the change that is taking place
[1:00:40] in our life and you know if you don't
[1:00:43] have change
[1:00:44] don't get discouraged but get serious
[1:00:48] don't just superficially say well i'm
[1:00:51] getting old i'm getting gray i'm this
[1:00:52] i'm that and i just can't change that
[1:00:55] no we should take care of ourselves in
[1:00:57] the natural and we should certainly take
[1:00:59] that as an
[1:01:00] example in the spiritual to look into
[1:01:02] the mirror of god's word
[1:01:04] and be able to say you know what i am
[1:01:07] not what i'm supposed to be
[1:01:09] but i can say thank you lord i am not
[1:01:12] what i
[1:01:13] used to be because we can look ourselves
[1:01:15] this is not vanity to
[1:01:17] examine ourself right that is what the
[1:01:19] scripture we read that
[1:01:21] every time we take communion for a man
[1:01:24] to examine
[1:01:25] himself you see it's not really the
[1:01:28] preacher's job
[1:01:29] it's not really someone else's job god
[1:01:32] actually has handed that back to you and
[1:01:34] i
[1:01:35] to look in the mirror of his word and
[1:01:37] say am i
[1:01:38] the same image of christ i was created
[1:01:42] in his
[1:01:43] image am i projecting his image
[1:01:47] you see if we're not projecting the
[1:01:49] image of christ
[1:01:50] then something has come and altered our
[1:01:53] image and so we want to just look at
[1:01:57] that
[1:01:57] and help us to see and help us
[1:02:00] to change ourselves can someone say amen
[1:02:03] to that
[1:02:04] lord let me see with clarity with
[1:02:06] honesty
[1:02:07] this is not with condemnation this is
[1:02:09] not with with any uh
[1:02:11] thing associated with that i i don't
[1:02:14] believe
[1:02:14] in preachers preaching condemnation to a
[1:02:17] congregation
[1:02:18] i believe in preaching the unvarnished
[1:02:20] truth
[1:02:21] and getting you yourself to recognize i
[1:02:24] need to look in the word and
[1:02:25] i need to change i don't need to be
[1:02:28] forced to change i don't need to be
[1:02:30] as i use brother sean as that example
[1:02:32] the other day
[1:02:33] and you know we don't want to shame or
[1:02:35] we don't want to cause one to do that
[1:02:37] because
[1:02:37] instead it will drive away but when we
[1:02:40] can present
[1:02:40] an image of christ that we look at that
[1:02:43] and say lord that's who i want to look
[1:02:45] like that's who i want to be
[1:02:47] and then the holy spirit will move in
[1:02:49] and did the prophet of god not
[1:02:51] drive home i looked it up today and i'm
[1:02:53] sorry i forgot
[1:02:54] but you know brother branham speaks over
[1:02:56] and over and over again let me put it
[1:02:58] that way instead of some definitive
[1:02:59] number
[1:03:00] he will give you the desires of your
[1:03:04] heart
[1:03:05] and if your heart is to be in his image
[1:03:08] you can look in the mirror and say i'm
[1:03:10] reflecting something besides his perfect
[1:03:13] image
[1:03:13] but lord i want to be in your image
[1:03:17] he will change you
[1:03:20] you have to put an effort but he
[1:03:23] will change you we don't have to settle
[1:03:26] for
[1:03:26] we live in a very wicked age and it's
[1:03:28] slowly overtaking me that's nonsense
[1:03:30] that's the devil's story
[1:03:32] that's the devil's narrative because
[1:03:34] he's the one that's there trying to
[1:03:36] convince you
[1:03:37] this natural decline of a spiritual
[1:03:40] state
[1:03:41] is normal no my brother and sister
[1:03:44] we'll touch in a minute i'm trying not
[1:03:45] to get ahead of myself he has not
[1:03:48] called us to a spiritual decline he has
[1:03:51] called us into a spiritual ascent
[1:03:54] not descent ascent and so
[1:03:57] the idea that hey this is the age we
[1:03:59] live in
[1:04:00] my brother and sister i say this kind of
[1:04:02] tongue-in-cheek
[1:04:03] i'm glad our church is paid for we don't
[1:04:06] have to try to have some kind of drive
[1:04:08] for money
[1:04:09] we don't have to have some kind of thing
[1:04:11] to impress
[1:04:12] the neighborhood let it be the word of
[1:04:15] god that is impressed upon the heart
[1:04:17] amen let it be that image that is
[1:04:19] impressed into the mind
[1:04:21] let it be that when we look at ourselves
[1:04:23] we can look at the word
[1:04:25] and say lord i am changing and i can say
[1:04:28] thank you lord
[1:04:29] thank you thank you thank you lord
[1:04:32] hallelujah
[1:04:34] otherwise my brother and sister will
[1:04:36] find something else out here
[1:04:38] you realize how many images there are to
[1:04:41] conform to today
[1:04:43] i mentioned the boats well i'll tell you
[1:04:46] you should have seen that beautiful
[1:04:47] beautiful
[1:04:49] boat this morning had a hamilton 212 i'm
[1:04:53] sure it had a big block in it it was
[1:04:55] polished
[1:04:56] trailer had fancy wheels on it pulled by
[1:04:58] a brand new diesel pickup
[1:05:00] they just spent about probably 500 to
[1:05:03] fill it full of gas
[1:05:07] an image do you know a four seat razor
[1:05:11] with a turbo is now 23 000
[1:05:15] it's an image we can't pull it with a
[1:05:18] 71 ford f-100
[1:05:22] that would ruin our image
[1:05:25] and it just goes on and on and on
[1:05:29] and on now pardon me i'm not stepping on
[1:05:33] anybody's toes but we can't go
[1:05:34] hunt deer with a you know a 25 year old
[1:05:37] 30 30
[1:05:38] we need a seiko
[1:05:42] and a tricon
[1:05:45] you see my brother and sister there's
[1:05:47] just a lot this
[1:05:48] image and satan says you're not into
[1:05:51] that image
[1:05:52] let me present you another one you don't
[1:05:53] want that one i've got another one for
[1:05:55] you you know oh you're not even into
[1:05:56] that let me present another one too
[1:06:00] and the list just goes on and on
[1:06:03] and on as much as there is carnal things
[1:06:06] on this earth satan's got to offer to us
[1:06:11] can i pick on you sisters
[1:06:14] oh thank you so much
[1:06:18] you know i did a little research on this
[1:06:21] depending on who you talk about there's
[1:06:23] only like five to seven
[1:06:25] basic color trends in clothing
[1:06:29] why does it take 50 pairs of shoes
[1:06:37] i think it's an honest question
[1:06:41] black brown blue tan
[1:06:46] we've got to cover don't we
[1:06:50] and i don't blame you sisters brothers
[1:06:54] we're about as bad at certain things
[1:06:57] why because just that one shade of brown
[1:07:00] doesn't go
[1:07:02] you see what i'm saying i'm not picking
[1:07:04] on anyone i'm actually trying to put a
[1:07:06] little humor in this this morning
[1:07:08] you see that shade of brown doesn't go
[1:07:09] with this shade of brown so we need this
[1:07:11] shade brown
[1:07:12] and that shade of brown and then we need
[1:07:14] a dark brown and then we need to
[1:07:17] it goes on and on see that's the flavors
[1:07:20] the point i'm trying to make to you
[1:07:21] that's the flavors that satan's
[1:07:23] got not everyone wants to go to church
[1:07:27] they're handling snakes
[1:07:29] shouting hallelujah running around the
[1:07:30] building but some do
[1:07:33] some want a quiet church someone at
[1:07:36] church that they have jericho marches in
[1:07:39] i want a church that the word is
[1:07:41] preached because we just listen to the
[1:07:42] prophet of god say today
[1:07:44] that where he is at where the holy
[1:07:46] spirit is present the supernatural
[1:07:50] is there so let's preach the word then
[1:07:53] we'll have the supernatural we
[1:07:55] won't have to manufacture it i don't
[1:07:57] want to get off in a bunch of quotes
[1:07:58] that i looked through
[1:08:00] in the early hours couldn't sleep
[1:08:01] brother jason i i relate
[1:08:03] i woke up at like 2 45 and then 3 45 and
[1:08:07] then 4
[1:08:07] 15 and finally i decided enough of this
[1:08:10] nonsense and i just got out of bed
[1:08:12] and i want to explain part of the other
[1:08:14] reasons of why i went ahead and got up
[1:08:15] but anyway
[1:08:16] uh you just look at that and just
[1:08:18] realize god's dealing with us and that
[1:08:21] you just look through this
[1:08:22] and there is something to be presented
[1:08:24] to create an image for
[1:08:25] every single individual on the face of
[1:08:28] the earth
[1:08:28] uh forgive me for kind of getting lost
[1:08:31] in that
[1:08:32] do you see you look at that uh the words
[1:08:35] telling us that once we have looked into
[1:08:37] this
[1:08:37] this mirror we've looked into that and
[1:08:40] we see what manner of person we are
[1:08:42] that we uh by nature would tend to walk
[1:08:45] away from that mirror
[1:08:47] and forget who we are amen
[1:08:50] you know i there's some funny analogies
[1:08:53] i could give but i probably picked on
[1:08:54] everybody
[1:08:55] enough already this morning but you see
[1:08:57] sometimes we
[1:08:59] we just feel good about things and i'll
[1:09:01] just share this one
[1:09:02] you know that i found humorous and and
[1:09:05] you know about
[1:09:06] two three sundays ago when i preached on
[1:09:09] that sunday
[1:09:10] uh we get in the car to go home and
[1:09:11] jerry goes do you know that you got a
[1:09:13] great big pimple
[1:09:14] on your face you know it just crushed me
[1:09:17] i thought i've stood in front of those
[1:09:18] people and preached my heart out today
[1:09:20] with a great big old zit sticking out
[1:09:24] not the image i wanted to be
[1:09:33] but it's who i was and i can either
[1:09:36] accept who i am
[1:09:38] or i can walk away with another image
[1:09:42] in my mind
[1:09:46] had a friend he's passed away now in
[1:09:48] high school he was just meaner than a
[1:09:49] little buzz saw
[1:09:52] and when he was well in his 50s
[1:09:55] so far out of shape so far out of
[1:09:57] everything
[1:09:58] he had an image of him at 17
[1:10:02] whipping everybody and he went
[1:10:06] you talked to me looked up i'll just
[1:10:08] whip you
[1:10:10] i don't think so
[1:10:14] but the image is there you know the
[1:10:16] prophet of god said we shouldn't be
[1:10:18] living on an
[1:10:18] experience that's somewhere in our past
[1:10:21] we have an image of us prayed through we
[1:10:24] have an image of us filled with the holy
[1:10:26] ghost we have an
[1:10:27] image of us on fire for god and if we're
[1:10:30] not careful we live
[1:10:31] under the shadow of that image for many
[1:10:34] many many years
[1:10:36] but we're not even the reflection of
[1:10:39] that
[1:10:39] image we've now become something else we
[1:10:41] become the doty christian we become
[1:10:44] the lazy christian we become the out of
[1:10:46] tune christian
[1:10:47] but living on an image of a time that
[1:10:50] god answered prayers and god moved in
[1:10:52] our midst and
[1:10:53] and we felt on fire felt invincible
[1:10:59] amen
[1:11:02] you see we're called to live in the
[1:11:04] present not the past and we're also not
[1:11:06] called to live in the future we're
[1:11:08] called to live in the present
[1:11:10] i look to the day that the rapture comes
[1:11:12] but my brother and sister i live today
[1:11:14] as though today is the day
[1:11:17] i'm not looking at some future tense of
[1:11:19] some time god's going to come
[1:11:21] i believe the prophet's words when he
[1:11:23] said we should believe he would come
[1:11:25] at any moment oh lord help us that's a
[1:11:28] hard one saints isn't it
[1:11:30] amen let's be honest with ourselves that
[1:11:32] sometimes we live like well if i can
[1:11:34] make it till sunday and get my battery
[1:11:36] recharged
[1:11:36] you need to find a charging station
[1:11:39] right now
[1:11:41] hallelujah you see if we walk away and
[1:11:43] forget who we are
[1:11:45] now the word of god says we were created
[1:11:47] in his image
[1:11:49] do we believe that amen so if we're
[1:11:52] created in his image let us reflect
[1:11:56] his image not another image not satan's
[1:11:59] image not something that's created in
[1:12:02] the world we live in today
[1:12:04] we can say well you know i kind of tend
[1:12:06] to agree
[1:12:07] you know that that it is true how do you
[1:12:10] like this
[1:12:11] mentality of the council cancel culture
[1:12:18] the old wesleyan movement now is
[1:12:20] struggling within their leadership
[1:12:22] the various churches that kind of fall
[1:12:24] under that umbrella
[1:12:25] they're now embracing the idea that a
[1:12:29] sister
[1:12:29] not cutting her hair and wearing a dress
[1:12:33] and
[1:12:33] looking godly is a form
[1:12:37] of bondage that should be released by
[1:12:40] women's suffrage
[1:12:42] which means that we as men should take
[1:12:44] our hands off trying to dominate
[1:12:46] our wives
[1:12:49] where do you think that will take the
[1:12:50] church
[1:12:56] this is not something 50 years ago
[1:12:58] saints this is what's happening in our
[1:12:59] culture right now
[1:13:01] we have no right to preach the word of
[1:13:03] god and ask
[1:13:04] someone to line up to that word that's
[1:13:07] bondage
[1:13:09] we need to set the people free and let
[1:13:11] them do what they want to do
[1:13:13] and i oh i hope i don't confuse you i
[1:13:16] say amen but thank you
[1:13:19] lord that there's a people that say
[1:13:21] there's the word of god that was the
[1:13:23] mind of god that is his word
[1:13:25] that is his desire and i will bind
[1:13:28] myself
[1:13:29] it's not going to be the preacher it's
[1:13:31] not going to be the message
[1:13:33] it's not going to be those over there
[1:13:34] those over there i
[1:13:36] bind myself to jesus christ
[1:13:39] you see that mentality you see how that
[1:13:42] spirit creeps in
[1:13:43] i want more liberty i want more liberty
[1:13:45] now pardon me if you're wearing high
[1:13:46] heels i'm not picking on you but you
[1:13:48] ought to listen
[1:13:49] yes sir go back study what the prophet
[1:13:51] of god said it's endemic my brother and
[1:13:53] sister
[1:13:54] that it creeps in and we buy a little
[1:13:56] taller a little taller a little taller
[1:13:58] and we say well i don't want the pastor
[1:14:00] to preach against that well my brother
[1:14:02] and sister i'm not pre-preaching
[1:14:04] clothesline religion i'm preaching
[1:14:06] holiness
[1:14:08] you decide what holiness is to you
[1:14:12] oh this gets a little tricky doesn't it
[1:14:18] brother george
[1:14:21] how tall of heels did sister rebecca
[1:14:26] wear
[1:14:29] it all depended on what parachute she
[1:14:31] had on
[1:14:38] you know why you get an answer like that
[1:14:44] because the size of the heels that
[1:14:46] you're wearing
[1:14:48] will directly correspond to your view
[1:14:54] of holiness
[1:15:00] how'd you like that step around
[1:15:07] otherwise you know what i have to do
[1:15:10] we'll have to take a sawzall and make a
[1:15:13] little foot bracket and
[1:15:14] when you walk into church you step in it
[1:15:16] and it activates the saw and if it cuts
[1:15:19] off your heel that was
[1:15:20] too long and if it doesn't
[1:15:24] you're okay
[1:15:28] you know what that does causes you to
[1:15:31] wear one
[1:15:32] shoe to church and another one
[1:15:36] everywhere else
[1:15:39] creates hypocrisy
[1:15:43] amen so you say brother paul where are
[1:15:45] you going with this i'm telling you
[1:15:47] follow the dictates of your heart
[1:15:49] but pray about being holy
[1:15:52] holiness is not a measure or standard
[1:15:56] it is a life it is a life
[1:15:59] and if our god is holy and the word of
[1:16:03] god says we are holy because he is holy
[1:16:05] then there
[1:16:06] is a standard out there but i'm not
[1:16:09] going to set it for you
[1:16:10] i'm not going to be the one that holds
[1:16:12] the tape measure and tells you good
[1:16:13] enough not good enough
[1:16:15] the holy spirit speaking to you should
[1:16:17] tell you
[1:16:18] pray about it that's what i'm asking you
[1:16:20] to do actually
[1:16:21] pray about it
[1:16:29] we'll just skip beyond that yes
[1:16:35] i thought you'd all be like maybe
[1:16:36] jumping up running down the aisles
[1:16:38] praise the lord brother paul preach it
[1:16:42] but those folks must not made it to
[1:16:44] church today
[1:16:45] so now look
[1:16:48] the marriage of the lamb
[1:16:52] as i say to you all the time saints we
[1:16:54] can't just read every bit of every quote
[1:16:56] way in front of it way behind it just
[1:16:58] want to stir your mind up
[1:17:00] because there's no other tower no other
[1:17:02] stand but the name of the lord is a
[1:17:04] mighty tower that the righteous run into
[1:17:06] and are safe
[1:17:07] when you run into it you take the name
[1:17:12] now remember this scripture speaking of
[1:17:14] seven women taking one man
[1:17:16] we don't we'll provide for ourself we
[1:17:18] just want your name
[1:17:20] you see they're not really taking his
[1:17:22] name
[1:17:23] his name now becomes a false covering
[1:17:26] right because they've never submitted to
[1:17:28] him
[1:17:28] they've never identified completely with
[1:17:31] him
[1:17:32] they just have that name now i tell you
[1:17:34] uh forgive me to take it
[1:17:36] into this avenue but i will my brother
[1:17:38] and sister we live in a day
[1:17:40] of hyphenated names now i am not
[1:17:44] paul halett mrs jesus christ i have
[1:17:47] relinquished my own
[1:17:48] identity and i take the word of god and
[1:17:52] identify as the bride of christ i am mrs
[1:17:55] jesus christ
[1:17:56] if i take my own my own identity
[1:18:00] then you will find the human hail it
[1:18:03] nature
[1:18:04] and my sister can testify the hail it's
[1:18:06] have a nature
[1:18:07] oh my they are stubborn we're not always
[1:18:11] right but about
[1:18:12] 99.999 percent of the time we are
[1:18:17] you see it's not about taking a name
[1:18:20] and keeping the nature when we identify
[1:18:24] in the name
[1:18:25] we are taking his nature amen
[1:18:29] so we don't come you know i had a friend
[1:18:32] kind of jokingly i guess he's got a
[1:18:34] a brother-in-law that this happened to
[1:18:37] uh it would be i think his wife's
[1:18:39] brother married another girl
[1:18:41] he's a meat eater like you can't believe
[1:18:43] and she's a vegetarian to the very
[1:18:45] end and he said it's very interesting to
[1:18:48] go to their house
[1:18:50] because he's trying to throw meat on her
[1:18:52] plate and she's throwing veggies
[1:18:54] on his plate and when it's all done
[1:18:56] they're still veggies on one plate and
[1:18:57] still meet on the other because they
[1:18:59] refuse to move
[1:19:01] and he said you know it just seems
[1:19:06] contradictory
[1:19:09] it's actually kind of funny he said when
[1:19:11] they have a barbecue at their house
[1:19:13] he's out there cooking a big old steak
[1:19:15] and she's out there
[1:19:17] cooking her cauliflower
[1:19:20] just a hard image for me now any of you
[1:19:24] that are vegetarians i don't mean to put
[1:19:26] down on that but it's just a hard image
[1:19:27] you know that we have a nice grill and
[1:19:29] we're grilling cauliflower you can eat
[1:19:31] cauliflower anyway
[1:19:36] you take the name the name not just
[1:19:38] calling
[1:19:39] a name but the name and the person that
[1:19:42] you are
[1:19:43] christ like in the life amen wonderful
[1:19:46] he is yes
[1:19:47] church now this is the part i want to
[1:19:49] get church has done the same
[1:19:51] committing spiritual fornications as a
[1:19:54] woman that would share
[1:19:55] love from her husband to another man
[1:19:56] that woman is not fit to be lived with
[1:19:58] you know that
[1:19:59] and when the church begins to share her
[1:20:01] fellowship with the world god is a
[1:20:04] jealous god
[1:20:06] he put israel away because of that his
[1:20:08] own son will put
[1:20:09] the same thing away he's going to have a
[1:20:12] bride that hasn't got
[1:20:13] a wrinkle in her amen she is holy washed
[1:20:17] by the blood of his own self that's
[1:20:19] right
[1:20:19] so we see where we stand the wedding is
[1:20:23] getting
[1:20:23] ready to come amen can we say amen to
[1:20:27] that
[1:20:28] now we find she commits spiritual
[1:20:30] fornications going out with the world
[1:20:32] professing something
[1:20:34] i hope this doesn't pinch any of you i
[1:20:36] hope you can just say praise the lord
[1:20:37] that's not me
[1:20:38] i looked in the mirror of the word this
[1:20:40] morning and that was not me
[1:20:42] amen professing something living
[1:20:46] something different i'm not being too
[1:20:48] hard this morning am i
[1:20:50] come on saints we just gotta we gotta
[1:20:52] remind ourselves the devil's trying to
[1:20:54] get us
[1:20:55] to come follow his way
[1:20:59] now won't never work what the church
[1:21:02] ought to do is do like esther did
[1:21:06] esther refused the adorning of the world
[1:21:10] amen i want you to think about this
[1:21:15] everything that esther desired
[1:21:19] not only when she was coming up to
[1:21:21] present herself to the king the first
[1:21:23] but as the king's wife
[1:21:26] everything she desired was there to be
[1:21:30] given to her
[1:21:34] i hope you don't mind me being a little
[1:21:35] direct this morning
[1:21:37] she could have hiked the skirt up a
[1:21:39] little she could have cut whatever you
[1:21:42] would call the bodus
[1:21:43] or whatever bodice or my wife's just
[1:21:46] like one
[1:21:48] sorry i don't specialize in that
[1:21:51] could have cut the front down and raised
[1:21:53] the hem up she could have made it so
[1:21:55] tight
[1:21:56] what do they call those
[1:22:00] wiener skirts she could have said
[1:22:03] that's what i want i'm going to present
[1:22:06] myself to the king today
[1:22:08] like this and remind him it's the new
[1:22:11] fashion
[1:22:12] of the church
[1:22:16] but the prophet of god goes we won't
[1:22:17] read those quotes today but the prophet
[1:22:19] of god said no
[1:22:20] what she did is she presented herself
[1:22:23] in humility she presented herself
[1:22:28] in that image that reflected
[1:22:32] her character
[1:22:36] amen think about that maybe how we dress
[1:22:39] is a reflection of our character oh
[1:22:41] brother paul you have no right to say
[1:22:42] that i'm just asking you the question
[1:22:44] amen what if how we dress reflects the
[1:22:47] real character of our heart god help us
[1:22:49] yes god help us saints i want to see you
[1:22:52] in a rapture i want to
[1:22:53] i want to stroll over as the song says i
[1:22:55] want to stroll over heaven with you
[1:22:58] amen
[1:23:01] esther refused the adorning of the world
[1:23:03] we know that little book of esther
[1:23:05] how that mordecai his uncle had a
[1:23:08] daughter and was down during the times
[1:23:10] of the reigns of the medes and persians
[1:23:11] a very beautiful type there the king
[1:23:14] one of the greatest kings in the world
[1:23:15] that day he had a great feast and he
[1:23:17] called the queen to come set by him
[1:23:19] but she wouldn't do it now i want this
[1:23:22] to soak in because this leads somewhere
[1:23:24] here over into this spiritual realm
[1:23:27] amen but she wouldn't do it she refused
[1:23:30] to do it so what did he do
[1:23:31] he was so humiliated didn't know what to
[1:23:34] do that his own wife wouldn't come
[1:23:41] here's the punchline and i think that's
[1:23:45] a whole lot like christ today christ has
[1:23:47] invited us to
[1:23:48] set in heavenly places with him and
[1:23:50] we're ashamed of it
[1:23:54] many people are ashamed to say they've
[1:23:56] got the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:23:57] pentecostal people that's right
[1:23:58] they're ashamed to say it we're ashamed
[1:24:00] of him amen
[1:24:03] now let's just take once and for all
[1:24:05] church and take the whole pentecostal
[1:24:07] movement
[1:24:08] and get it out of our mind that that's a
[1:24:10] denomination that's
[1:24:11] it amen the day of pentecost did not
[1:24:14] have a board of
[1:24:15] elders the day of pentecost didn't have
[1:24:17] a rule book
[1:24:18] the day of pentecost didn't have a
[1:24:20] tradition of
[1:24:22] expectation
[1:24:25] right
[1:24:28] like one of them great pentecostal
[1:24:30] preachers of this day right now has come
[1:24:32] and blasted them and says you know what
[1:24:34] y'all talked in tongues y'all did this
[1:24:35] but what you don't have is a life
[1:24:38] you say you've got christ you got the
[1:24:40] holy ghost because you spoke in tongues
[1:24:42] but you don't have a life
[1:24:44] speaking in tongues imagine this this
[1:24:47] one they're very well accepted
[1:24:50] straight down the middle preachers
[1:24:54] and he didn't do it in some backyard he
[1:24:56] did in a great televised convention
[1:24:59] and says you spoke in tongues you did
[1:25:01] all this stuff but you're dishonest and
[1:25:03] you do things over here in the dark and
[1:25:04] you're doing this
[1:25:05] and because why you don't have a life
[1:25:11] they're looking for oil saints they're
[1:25:13] starting to recognize speaking in
[1:25:14] tongues is great we believe it's the
[1:25:16] initial evidence of the holy ghost but
[1:25:18] there's got to be a life
[1:25:20] that backs this up and it's now become a
[1:25:23] mantra for them
[1:25:25] we've got to find this life we've got to
[1:25:26] find this life we've got to find this
[1:25:28] life
[1:25:28] why is he saying this he puts it right
[1:25:30] blunt to them because we now have just
[1:25:32] as many divorces
[1:25:33] as anyone else we have just as many kids
[1:25:35] on drugs we have just as many drunks in
[1:25:37] our church
[1:25:38] we have just as many nonsense
[1:25:42] but we spoke in tongues
[1:25:48] can i kick you in the shins the same
[1:25:51] spirit's creeping right in the message
[1:25:54] not in this church and i pray god as
[1:25:56] long as i've got breath in my body it'll
[1:25:58] never be allowed in this church
[1:25:59] but we've got message churches that the
[1:26:01] people on this side are getting divorced
[1:26:03] and he's marrying the woman over here
[1:26:05] that just divorced her husband
[1:26:06] and then they're all sitting right on
[1:26:08] the center aisle
[1:26:10] ex-husband over here ex-wives over here
[1:26:14] oh praise god they believe god sent a
[1:26:16] prophet
[1:26:19] where's the life that's it where's the
[1:26:21] life
[1:26:22] there has to be a life let's look in the
[1:26:24] mirror am i
[1:26:26] alive or do i just have a form
[1:26:31] huh i don't want to be ashamed of him in
[1:26:34] fact let me tell you
[1:26:35] i i just uh to for the sake of time i
[1:26:38] i i just a little farther down not far
[1:26:41] beyond that you can go
[1:26:43] uh brother brown says i'm glad i bear
[1:26:45] the name of jesus christ it's the
[1:26:46] greatest privilege
[1:26:47] i've ever had to say that i'm a part of
[1:26:50] him amen
[1:26:51] amen oh my yes hallelujah
[1:26:54] now i want you to think about this my
[1:26:56] brother and sister the whole story of
[1:26:57] esther
[1:26:58] i just kind of trying to wrap it on i
[1:27:00] want to move on beyond esther and my
[1:27:02] thoughts and studies
[1:27:03] but you look at this my brother and
[1:27:05] sister esther being raised as a
[1:27:07] orphan child being raised up and
[1:27:10] you know she accepted mordecai
[1:27:14] as as her father he's really just her
[1:27:16] uncle but accepted
[1:27:18] and and she believed his words she
[1:27:20] followed his advice and
[1:27:22] and uh some you know a huge portion no
[1:27:24] doubt of the character that she had
[1:27:27] uh was uh placed or influenced in her
[1:27:30] life because of mordecai
[1:27:32] and so as we come down to this great
[1:27:34] time a haman is
[1:27:35] is uh bent on destroying the jews he
[1:27:38] sees it
[1:27:39] as an opportunity to steal their wealth
[1:27:42] much like the same spirit that come upon
[1:27:44] hitler in the
[1:27:45] uh world war ii in that era they
[1:27:48] as much as they hated the jews and and
[1:27:50] gave all of their reasons why
[1:27:53] they were actually looking at the wealth
[1:27:55] of the jewish people
[1:27:56] and they wanted that wealth they wanted
[1:27:58] to possess it for themselves
[1:28:01] and inherently you will understand that
[1:28:04] the spirit that was
[1:28:05] in this um uh in these people in this
[1:28:08] nature
[1:28:09] was a wicked spirit now this isn't to
[1:28:11] say my brother and sister that these
[1:28:12] orthodox jews
[1:28:14] and their business practices and what
[1:28:15] they were doing were
[1:28:17] that really spiritual people that they
[1:28:19] were really
[1:28:20] you know on fire for god they had fallen
[1:28:22] into a rut
[1:28:23] uh their real goal at that time if
[1:28:25] you'll study history
[1:28:27] uh literally was to make money oh i pray
[1:28:30] we don't let that spirit get all over us
[1:28:32] amen
[1:28:32] and so you look at this you know because
[1:28:34] brother branham blasted
[1:28:35] you know these these big churches this
[1:28:38] finery we're impressing everybody by
[1:28:40] what we have and what image we can
[1:28:42] project
[1:28:42] my brother and sister it don't matter
[1:28:44] how big a church you're in if you get
[1:28:46] the baptism of the holy ghost you won't
[1:28:48] care whether you're in the backyard the
[1:28:50] front yard or the biggest church in the
[1:28:51] nation
[1:28:52] what you'll care about is that you met
[1:28:54] god face to face
[1:28:56] and if you haven't met him it won't
[1:28:57] matter if you're in the front yard the
[1:28:59] backyard or the biggest church in the
[1:29:01] nation
[1:29:01] you still have not met him amen so you
[1:29:05] look at this and realize that haman now
[1:29:07] has this influence on her and it comes
[1:29:09] to this time
[1:29:10] and you know this scripture you know the
[1:29:12] story uh all back and forth and
[1:29:14] mordecai's out there and sackcloth and
[1:29:16] ashes
[1:29:17] and uh some of esther's servants uh uh
[1:29:20] come and they tell her you know what is
[1:29:22] happening mordecai's out there by the
[1:29:24] gates and he's in sackcloth and asses
[1:29:26] he's
[1:29:27] he's wailing moaning and and uh we don't
[1:29:29] know what's going on finally she gets
[1:29:31] the answer finds out
[1:29:32] that haman is uh building a gallows and
[1:29:35] is uh
[1:29:36] got a king's decree to destroy what was
[1:29:39] the enemies
[1:29:41] i want you to think about this my
[1:29:43] brother and sister
[1:29:44] the enemies of the nation
[1:29:48] i don't know you can no don't find it if
[1:29:50] you look far enough
[1:29:52] it kind of got suppressed and pushed
[1:29:54] back down
[1:29:55] because it just was a little bit strong
[1:29:58] for the season
[1:30:00] but there's a democratic government
[1:30:03] official
[1:30:03] back east that not that far in the past
[1:30:07] stood up and made a public statement
[1:30:09] said christians are the number one
[1:30:13] enemy of our nation
[1:30:20] i wouldn't even say anointed by the
[1:30:21] devil he might have been anointed by god
[1:30:24] god said he would give us the signs he
[1:30:26] would show us
[1:30:27] where we're headed so we see the
[1:30:30] parallel of this story
[1:30:32] that haman viewed the jews as the enemy
[1:30:35] of the nation
[1:30:38] and now they're saying the problem we
[1:30:40] have in america
[1:30:41] is the christians and i can understand
[1:30:45] that i mean i have
[1:30:46] burnt and blazed and beaten and whatever
[1:30:49] else just
[1:30:49] anything and everything around me i
[1:30:51] don't i imagine you guys do that at
[1:30:52] night too
[1:30:54] you know yeah see
[1:30:57] it said what is good would be called
[1:30:59] evil and what is evil would be called
[1:31:00] good and
[1:31:01] we're seeing this all come to pass right
[1:31:03] before us
[1:31:05] that's why i feel so strongly about this
[1:31:07] story about esther because there's so
[1:31:09] many parallels that come
[1:31:11] and show us the day that we're living in
[1:31:13] and i'm telling you let me get going
[1:31:14] along here i don't i don't
[1:31:16] want to keep you forever today but i'm
[1:31:18] working on it
[1:31:19] amen so look at this mordecai's words to
[1:31:23] esther
[1:31:24] is don't run away from this don't think
[1:31:26] you can hide from this don't think this
[1:31:28] won't apply to you
[1:31:29] because it will and if there isn't
[1:31:32] deliverance from you
[1:31:33] god will let you be judged and
[1:31:35] deliverance will come from somewhere
[1:31:37] else
[1:31:38] you were born for such a time
[1:31:41] as this now i want you to understand
[1:31:45] how that would have driven down in her
[1:31:47] good little
[1:31:48] holy ghost-filled heart right godly
[1:31:51] young woman
[1:31:52] and drove down in her heart i literally
[1:31:56] was called for this season
[1:32:00] can someone say amen i wasn't called for
[1:32:04] some other day my brother and sister i
[1:32:06] wasn't called for some other deal
[1:32:07] i wasn't called to be in a lukewarm
[1:32:10] thing and not hear the truth i was
[1:32:12] called you were called to hear the truth
[1:32:15] and not only hear the truth but be a
[1:32:17] doer
[1:32:19] not look in the mirror and walk away and
[1:32:21] forget who you are and take on a spirit
[1:32:23] of laodicea
[1:32:24] he didn't call you to look in the mirror
[1:32:26] and say everything's fine in my world
[1:32:29] he called you to look in the mirror and
[1:32:31] say lord i want your nature
[1:32:33] i want your life and i will pay the
[1:32:35] price
[1:32:36] whatever it is to be what you called me
[1:32:39] to be
[1:32:42] hallelujah amen or we can preach that
[1:32:45] other kind of gospel that says you know
[1:32:47] what let's just go undercover
[1:32:52] we'll laugh at their jokes be partakers
[1:32:55] of
[1:32:57] and then tell the lord lord you
[1:32:59] understand
[1:33:01] they never wait to hear from him to see
[1:33:03] if he actually responds
[1:33:05] whether he understood or not they just
[1:33:07] assume
[1:33:08] amen he understands well i'll tell you
[1:33:11] what he understands
[1:33:13] he understands that his word is his will
[1:33:18] amen yeah come on saints
[1:33:21] no i'm not angry this morning i'm
[1:33:23] actually quite happy amen
[1:33:25] hallelujah now let's look at the nature
[1:33:28] my brother and sister look at this
[1:33:29] mordecai's words are
[1:33:30] you you were born for such a time as
[1:33:32] this you can't hide from this see
[1:33:35] a bride a wife who knows who she is
[1:33:40] see that's what separated if we could
[1:33:43] just catch the revelation
[1:33:45] of this how the chamberlain's
[1:33:49] eunuchs maids everyone loved esther
[1:33:53] and when she says i'm going to go before
[1:33:55] the king they are not just like oh you
[1:33:57] can't do that that's against the rules
[1:34:00] they were in fear they literally were in
[1:34:03] fear
[1:34:04] thank you lord that they was rent
[1:34:08] amen thank you lord that it's no longer
[1:34:11] that we have to fear to go before the
[1:34:13] king
[1:34:14] do you realize saints that when esther
[1:34:16] went that day no doubt she
[1:34:18] had apprehension in her heart but she
[1:34:20] didn't go
[1:34:21] and she didn't suddenly clip on the
[1:34:22] earrings and the long fingernails and
[1:34:24] the gaudy whatever
[1:34:25] and do all this what did she do she knew
[1:34:28] the desire of her husband
[1:34:30] and she went back to the desire of her
[1:34:32] husband because that was her desire
[1:34:35] and she adorned herself as always
[1:34:39] oh you dodio message sisters
[1:34:45] praise the lord praise the lord
[1:34:48] we don't have to go out here and waddle
[1:34:50] down the street
[1:34:52] and be so ridiculous that's right come
[1:34:55] on i don't mean to be crude my brother
[1:34:56] and sister but we were at a store the
[1:34:58] other day
[1:34:59] and there was this lady that was you
[1:35:01] might say there was just a lot of her
[1:35:03] and she jumped into somebody else's
[1:35:04] clothes and she's walking around like
[1:35:06] that
[1:35:07] and there was not one thing attractive
[1:35:10] in fact it was revolting but the
[1:35:13] anointing
[1:35:14] is if i jump in this spandex and i put
[1:35:16] on a t-shirt spandex thing that's way
[1:35:18] too small for me
[1:35:19] and i go out in public i'm sorry i'm
[1:35:21] being just blunt with you
[1:35:23] but i'm telling you there is an
[1:35:25] anointing
[1:35:26] that they think they have something to
[1:35:28] show off
[1:35:29] when in reality any normal human that
[1:35:32] hasn't lost their mind
[1:35:34] would say i would never be caught in
[1:35:36] public like that
[1:35:39] but the delusion the delusions
[1:35:43] getting stronger the devil
[1:35:47] the devil's going that's it i like it

[1:35:59] morning but look come on it's time for
[1:36:01] us to

[1:36:11] in meekness amen hallelujah she adorned
[1:36:15] herself
[1:36:16] as a humble person in fact the word says
[1:36:18] that she was a joy to be around
[1:36:22] amen praise the lord i've been a message

[1:41:39] judgment on the devil amen amen
[1:41:43] she's there serving her husband and she
[1:41:46] was presenting an
[1:41:48] atmosphere creating an atmosphere that
[1:41:51] when she
[1:41:51] asked for deliverance from the control
[1:41:54] of the adversary that he was right there
[1:41:58] saying whatever you say
[1:42:00] you say what you want read your bible

[1:42:14] who passed judgment on amen and this
[1:42:17] bride of christ my brother and sister
[1:42:19] is not bound by the devil not bound by
[1:42:22] the spirit of the age
[1:42:24] not bound by some kind of complex but
[1:42:27] when she
[1:42:28] speaks the word her husband listens
[1:42:31] and says whatever thy that you want
[1:42:34] ask anything in my name
[1:42:37] and i'll give it to you
[1:42:39] [Music]
[1:42:40] hallelujah oh look at this my brother
[1:42:44] and sister
[1:42:45] she created an atmosphere she had the
[1:42:46] right actions the right words
[1:42:49] what did she do it brought a message of
[1:42:52] life
[1:42:53] you say but it wasn't right there in
[1:42:55] that moment it brought a message of life
[1:42:57] no sir my brother and sister the king
[1:42:59] went back and he wrote a decree
[1:43:01] that said sons and daughters of god can
[1:43:04] take
[1:43:04] my word that i have put my stamp on
[1:43:07] and given my approval to it and they can
[1:43:10] defend their very life
[1:43:12] defend their household
[1:43:15] whoa praise the lord god wants you to
[1:43:19] hear that
[1:43:20] defend your household you've been given
[1:43:23] rights from almighty god
[1:43:25] to defend your household
[1:43:29] and take spoil of the devil
[1:43:32] and in that you can take spoil of the
[1:43:34] devil as take
[1:43:35] dominion over him
[1:43:38] or do you just like your
[1:43:43] hot cold in
[1:43:46] out powerless message
[1:43:50] church
[1:43:58] you see satan's got a wish list
[1:44:04] he takes names and he knows exactly what
[1:44:08] to give you
[1:44:10] come on what he gives to brother trevor
[1:44:14] is not the same brother david's brother
[1:44:16] jason right on down the line
[1:44:18] taylor taylormade and satan's got his
[1:44:21] wish list
[1:44:23] and what's really sad breaks my heart
[1:44:25] even with my name on it
[1:44:26] he gets to check that wishlist off a lot
[1:44:28] more than we would like him to
[1:44:31] why because we've come
[1:44:35] and we said well i prayed about it i
[1:44:37] prayed about it brother paul i prayed
[1:44:39] about it brother paul
[1:44:42] but the bible says you ask amiss
[1:44:46] that's right you say but i didn't think
[1:44:49] i did
[1:44:49] no that's because you see we never
[1:44:51] communion with him
[1:44:53] right let me just put this type becomes
[1:44:56] the wife
[1:44:58] i'm not speaking to no one in general
[1:44:59] okay becomes the wife
[1:45:02] that her communion with her husband is
[1:45:04] give me give me
[1:45:06] give me give me i want
[1:45:09] now amen
[1:45:13] that's not communion no sir that's not
[1:45:16] an atmosphere
[1:45:18] now the fact that that trails in the
[1:45:21] natural just the same as it does in the
[1:45:22] spiritual
[1:45:23] is not beside the fact but it's just a
[1:45:26] fact
[1:45:28] amen i'll tell you the man
[1:45:32] you want a way to a man sisters
[1:45:36] you butter him up
[1:45:40] i thought i'd hear an amen brother
[1:45:46] no sir i'm not kidding
[1:45:50] sisters you'll get a whole lot more
[1:45:53] about throwing your arms around him you
[1:45:55] might have to lock the kids in the
[1:45:56] bedroom or whatever so that anyway
[1:46:00] he walks in the door you throw your arms
[1:46:02] around him oh come on is this too blunt
[1:46:04] are we we not humans or
[1:46:06] throw your arms around him and smack him
[1:46:08] on the lips till he's dizzy
[1:46:13] you get a lot more out of him than when
[1:46:15] he walks in the door
[1:46:16] and you're like you said you'd have this
[1:46:18] fixed by monday and it's friday now and
[1:46:20] if you don't do this if it goes you
[1:46:21] didn't mean next monday it was this week
[1:46:23] and i'm
[1:46:23] i mean my daddy to do this
[1:46:30] come on pick any way you want come on
[1:46:34] he'll appreciate well anyway
[1:46:42] come on are we all this morning
[1:46:47] are we honest totally honest this
[1:46:48] morning way too
[1:46:50] often we talk to god like he failed to
[1:46:54] deliver
[1:46:55] what we wanted him to deliver on time
[1:47:02] my i'm ripping hide off of people and i
[1:47:04] was going to preach a happy message this
[1:47:06] morning
[1:47:07] my now let's look at this christ the
[1:47:10] mystery of god reveal
[1:47:12] then we stand justified in the presence
[1:47:14] of god as a drop of ink
[1:47:16] dropping into a tub full of bleach
[1:47:17] you'll never find the stain of the ink
[1:47:19] no more it went somewhere
[1:47:21] and never come back again and when a man
[1:47:24] is truly redeemed that predestinated
[1:47:26] seed that sees it
[1:47:27] and accepts it his sins are demolished
[1:47:32] not displaced not tucked away for future
[1:47:36] reference demolished
[1:47:39] it's gone it's separated it's dropped in
[1:47:42] the ink of the blood of jesus christ
[1:47:44] and it's never to be remembered god
[1:47:46] forgets it
[1:47:47] and you don't want to know the problem
[1:47:48] is we often forget that god forgets it
[1:47:52] and the devil comes along and says you
[1:47:54] you you you and we're like
[1:47:55] yes yes yes yes come on god forgot it
[1:48:00] put it under the blood your own self
[1:48:02] wife
[1:48:04] your husband repents put it under the
[1:48:08] blood
[1:48:09] husband your wife repents of something
[1:48:11] put it under the blood
[1:48:12] parents children brother sister
[1:48:15] sister sister sister brother brother
[1:48:18] says whatever it might be
[1:48:19] amen when it's repented put it under the
[1:48:22] blood
[1:48:23] and forget it amen
[1:48:26] in fact i want to i want to just put it
[1:48:28] this way this is opinion if i could put
[1:48:30] you is that way my brother and sister we
[1:48:32] get an arrogant spirit and we think that
[1:48:34] what god has put under the blood we have
[1:48:36] a right to march in there
[1:48:37] latch onto that thing and come out and
[1:48:40] say do you remember
[1:48:44] that's an arrogant spirit right there
[1:48:47] amen god ain't gonna remember it but i
[1:48:49] have a right to
[1:48:52] i'm talking about true repentance not
[1:48:54] some half-hearted man i'm sorry
[1:48:57] amen let's never remember god forgets it
[1:49:00] he stands as the son and daughter of god
[1:49:02] in the presence of god amen and amen
[1:49:04] now we are the sons of god not we will
[1:49:07] be
[1:49:08] right we are now we are redeemed
[1:49:13] oh this is it this whole quote right
[1:49:15] here
[1:49:16] just i was just so excited i could
[1:49:18] almost run through the building and
[1:49:19] scream jump on a pew or two
[1:49:21] we have satan's answer satan's always
[1:49:25] wanting an answer
[1:49:25] what about this what about this you did
[1:49:27] this what about this what about this
[1:49:29] we have satan's answer amen
[1:49:32] god has vindicated himself god has
[1:49:34] proved himself
[1:49:35] to his promise in this day can we say
[1:49:39] amen to that
[1:49:40] are we looking for the message to
[1:49:42] somehow be completed
[1:49:44] in our thinking no sir god's proven
[1:49:48] right the evidence is i will tell you
[1:49:50] over and over again sitting right here
[1:49:52] the evidence is not based in 1965 and
[1:49:55] previous
[1:49:56] the evidence is right here lives changed
[1:49:58] prayers answered
[1:50:00] holy ghost filled our children with no
[1:50:02] desire to go to the world they want to
[1:50:04] serve god
[1:50:05] my brother and sister that's god in our
[1:50:06] midst amen that's what he said he would
[1:50:09] do
[1:50:10] we have satan's answer god has
[1:50:12] vindicated himself god has proved
[1:50:13] himself
[1:50:14] to his promise in this day hallelujah
[1:50:17] the headship is here
[1:50:18] amen christ the risen lord is here in
[1:50:21] the same power
[1:50:23] of his resurrection that he ever was
[1:50:25] manifesting himself
[1:50:27] there's the devil's answer
[1:50:30] so when the devil starts crowing and
[1:50:32] hollering and whooping and whatever else
[1:50:34] just point him back
[1:50:35] pointing back yeah satan you're
[1:50:37] vindicating yourself out here you're
[1:50:39] producing a generation of neurotics
[1:50:44] and i would not speak against someone
[1:50:45] that would maybe be on some kind of
[1:50:47] medication don't don't misunderstand me
[1:50:49] but look at the spirit of the day when
[1:50:52] it's there
[1:50:53] that the doctors now during coven
[1:50:56] prescriptions for sedatives skyrocketed
[1:51:04] well if we had a little so to speak
[1:51:06] pedometer
[1:51:07] for prayer time i would hope that your
[1:51:10] prayer time
[1:51:11] skyrocketed amen world's falling apart
[1:51:15] lord
[1:51:16] god help these poor people that are
[1:51:17] going crazy
[1:51:20] praise the lord amen amen now look at
[1:51:24] this
[1:51:25] i'm going to just throw this out here
[1:51:26] sorry i'm not jabbing nobody
[1:51:28] but there's people that don't believe
[1:51:30] his presence are here they've told me
[1:51:32] that to my face
[1:51:34] you must be believe perusia that's false
[1:51:37] doctrine that's not right
[1:51:38] well let's go back saints before we move
[1:51:40] on
[1:51:41] the head ship is here who is that
[1:51:45] is that brother paul no
[1:51:49] okay christ
[1:51:53] amen the headship is here amen christ
[1:51:57] the risen lord is here
[1:52:05] i think it's pretty self-explanatory
[1:52:10] in the same power of his resurrection
[1:52:12] that he
[1:52:14] kind of sort of was at one point in time
[1:52:18] ever ever does it ever mean
[1:52:24] my brain just went ah what would be the
[1:52:27] ever of ever
[1:52:32] the only way we do is move all the way
[1:52:33] never of ever
[1:52:36] right because if it was ever of ever
[1:52:39] the only opposite paradox of that would
[1:52:41] be
[1:52:43] have ever and there's only three kinds
[1:52:46] of believers and
[1:52:47] even the make-believer williams believes
[1:52:50] he has power
[1:52:53] believes he's god see what i'm saying
[1:52:56] the devil's so tricky i i hope i'm not
[1:52:59] i'm i'm kind of stumbling on how to
[1:53:01] explain this to you
[1:53:02] see how tricky the devil is when he
[1:53:04] comes in and gets a message believer
[1:53:07] to say he's not here he's not here
[1:53:12] where are they going to move on the
[1:53:13] promise saints i'm talking doctrine i'm
[1:53:16] not picking on people
[1:53:17] i'm talking about that devil how he's
[1:53:19] trying to trick them by their own words
[1:53:22] not to expect much
[1:53:25] i tell you what i expect every promise
[1:53:28] every promise in the book
[1:53:30] is mine every chapter every verse
[1:53:34] every line amen i am living
[1:53:37] oh that's a tractor version anyway i'm
[1:53:39] living in his love divine
[1:53:42] cause jesus christ is
[1:53:45] mine hallelujah
[1:53:49] come on don't you believe me saints make
[1:53:51] me think i'm nuts or something
[1:53:57] there's the devil's answer satan you
[1:54:00] said this my lord said this
[1:54:02] not even going to argue with you i got
[1:54:03] it no even fight i'm not even going to
[1:54:05] fight with you
[1:54:06] i'll just stick with the word you stick
[1:54:07] with whatever you feel
[1:54:11] now amen amen john 14 14. let me just
[1:54:15] hurry along here
[1:54:17] if he shall ask anything in my name i
[1:54:20] will do it can we interpret that any
[1:54:22] other way
[1:54:24] is there an adjective and an adverb and
[1:54:26] um i don't know
[1:54:27] noun pronoun sorry for doing that i i've
[1:54:30] flunked all that stuff
[1:54:32] my family tried to get me to bring my
[1:54:33] vase we're moving and i
[1:54:36] found my little vase i made for my
[1:54:37] passing grade from art class remember i
[1:54:39] shared that with you
[1:54:41] we actually found that little vase and
[1:54:42] i'm telling you there was kids in our
[1:54:44] class that built these great big vases
[1:54:46] with the lip that poured you know
[1:54:48] rounded and big scrolled handles and all
[1:54:51] this stuff and
[1:54:53] miss braden said paul i'll give you a
[1:54:54] passing grade if you can simply get
[1:54:56] something off the pottery wheel
[1:55:00] i found it while we were moving it's
[1:55:02] about that tall
[1:55:04] it's about that big around
[1:55:08] it's not round but it looks it
[1:55:13] but it doesn't matter you might
[1:55:17] be more spiritual than me you might have
[1:55:20] more
[1:55:21] understanding than me but all i have to
[1:55:25] have
[1:55:25] is him
[1:55:29] paul doesn't need to impress you paul
[1:55:31] doesn't need to pre
[1:55:32] impress any other preacher any other
[1:55:34] person on this earth
[1:55:36] all i've got to do is please him that's
[1:55:38] right
[1:55:39] come on saints come on we get all caught
[1:55:42] up in how good we are and what we look
[1:55:44] like and comparing ourselves
[1:55:46] nonsense nonsense my brother and sister
[1:55:50] hallelujah because i can take you if
[1:55:53] you want to spend the time i can take
[1:55:54] you through the scripture and
[1:55:56] show you that those that god tries
[1:56:01] is those that he tries you might say in
[1:56:03] a deeper measure
[1:56:06] as those he has greater
[1:56:09] confidence
[1:56:13] look he opened the hedge to the devil
[1:56:15] completely to job
[1:56:19] but before it ever happens don't you
[1:56:20] know job after the fact was like man i
[1:56:22] wished i know god thought that about me
[1:56:25] thought i was a righteous man thought i
[1:56:27] was a a good man thought that it was
[1:56:29] so to speak none greater than me i
[1:56:31] wished i would have knowed that before
[1:56:33] this whole battle
[1:56:34] i would have went through it whole
[1:56:35] different but you see god's not going to
[1:56:37] treat you any differently treated job
[1:56:39] and he's telling the devil this is my
[1:56:41] bride she's the best of laodicea she's
[1:56:44] the best there is on the earth
[1:56:46] and you can't touch her
[1:56:50] hallelujah but we got an advantage
[1:56:52] saints we get to read
[1:56:54] the story of job and we're going to read
[1:56:56] all of the word and we get to realize
[1:56:58] god feels exactly the same way about you
[1:57:01] and i as he felt about job
[1:57:03] and so we ought to be standing up
[1:57:04] instead of whimpering and crying
[1:57:06] we ought to be standing up and saying
[1:57:08] lord i read the book i read my name in
[1:57:10] the book
[1:57:11] i know what your goal is i know what
[1:57:12] your desire is and i
[1:57:14] know who i am
[1:57:17] you see that was the key for esther when
[1:57:20] she stood there
[1:57:21] the chamberlain's the eunuchs the maids
[1:57:24] all of them are like oh you're making a
[1:57:25] mistake
[1:57:26] he'll cash you out this isn't how it
[1:57:28] works but
[1:57:29] she was there saying i know
[1:57:33] who i am
[1:57:37] not i hope to be his bride do you see
[1:57:39] where i'm at
[1:57:40] i'm not i hope to be the bride of christ
[1:57:43] we stand with the confidence the world
[1:57:45] calls it
[1:57:46] arrogance
[1:57:49] yeah i stood right there one time when a
[1:57:52] man speaking to another message guy
[1:57:54] says you guys are so arrogant
[1:57:58] yes sir you mistaken his arrogance i
[1:58:00] take it as confidence
[1:58:02] hallelujah i know i am
[1:58:06] the bride of christ i know
[1:58:09] my name is mrs jesus christ
[1:58:13] i'm not arrogant and i would stand in
[1:58:16] front of you it wouldn't take you people
[1:58:17] very long to look at my life and each
[1:58:19] one of you would say i see this little
[1:58:21] thing and brother paul
[1:58:22] i see this little thing and brother paul
[1:58:24] probably scare me how big a list you
[1:58:26] could have
[1:58:28] but as long as you're looking at me
[1:58:29] you're not looking at him and i'm
[1:58:31] looking at him so you go ahead and look
[1:58:32] at me while i look at
[1:58:34] him and i'll be who he wants me to be
[1:58:36] because he promised me i would be

[2:00:46] midst amen
[2:00:47] you see let me just reiterate this i
[2:00:49] just feel led to reiterate this
[2:00:51] it's not our complaints
[2:00:55] it's not our whining it's not our crying
[2:01:00] it's our praise
[2:01:05] when esther walked out and he looked
[2:01:08] down there
[2:01:09] he was a man just like us brothers or
[2:01:12] men
[2:01:15] sisters i'll call you to the carpet here
[2:01:17] hope you don't mind i love you so much
[2:01:23] if your husband remembers the last words
[2:01:28] you spoke to him
[2:01:31] will he be built up or tore down
[2:01:38] can we get the rubber any plainer than
[2:01:40] that that's good
[2:01:44] king hazardous when he saw esther step
[2:01:47] into the court
[2:01:54] no wonder vashi left you
[2:01:59] no sir no no sir he looked down there
[2:02:04] and you remember those words so proud to
[2:02:07] be your wife
[2:02:08] i'm so happy you chose me
[2:02:12] amen when i come and offered myself into
[2:02:15] the court
[2:02:18] it's because i wanted with all of my
[2:02:20] heart
[2:02:22] to be your wife amen
[2:02:26] it wasn't like well if i'm not a wife to
[2:02:28] the king maybe he'll let me go over here
[2:02:29] and i'll marry this prince
[2:02:31] no sir and when he looked at her
[2:02:36] he saw this woman
[2:02:40] who was sold out she took his name she
[2:02:42] was sold out
[2:02:43] and she let him know how much i love you
[2:02:45] how much i appreciate how much i thank
[2:02:47] you for the life you've given me
[2:02:49] you hear my prayers i mean you hear my
[2:02:51] words
[2:02:54] come on amen because i can
[2:02:58] guarantee you if he'd married another
[2:02:59] vashti he'd have just
[2:03:01] left that scepter right there and he'd a
[2:03:03] letter walked up there and then he'd
[2:03:04] have told the chamberlains
[2:03:06] take her away
[2:03:09] come on amen i i you know brother david
[2:03:14] had like three sermons and i tried to
[2:03:16] cram them all into the same deal
[2:03:19] yeah now i'm struggling because somebody
[2:03:20] pushed the zip file and they're going
[2:03:22] bam
[2:03:22] blah blah blah blam and i got problems
[2:03:25] hallelujah conflict between god and
[2:03:27] satan
[2:03:29] and so here we are finish it the bride
[2:03:32] must be unified don't read no more
[2:03:35] stop there
[2:03:39] if all we took was those words right
[2:03:42] there
[2:03:43] the bride must be unified we've got
[2:03:46] everything under the sun believing
[2:03:47] everything under the sun
[2:03:48] preaching every weird thing under the
[2:03:50] sun and we've got an obligation to be
[2:03:52] unified with them
[2:03:54] some are peddling that
[2:03:57] come on i'm not complaining but i'm
[2:03:58] telling you i get peddled that way more
[2:04:00] often than you guys would even guess
[2:04:02] we're all one we're all bible believers
[2:04:05] message believers
[2:04:06] we should just all get together this
[2:04:08] should just all be the same
[2:04:09] so we could take that little chunk right
[2:04:11] there and justify that
[2:04:13] but look what he says here unified
[2:04:16] together
[2:04:17] by what the word
[2:04:20] the word you see there's no unity
[2:04:24] outside of the word amen i don't care
[2:04:27] what kind of programs and how
[2:04:28] fun they are we can sit around and say
[2:04:30] this was fun
[2:04:31] that's good my brother and sister but
[2:04:33] that's not unity
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:36] my sheep hear my voice and this is his
[2:04:39] voice on printed word
[2:04:41] he's talking about the bible he wasn't
[2:04:42] holding up a message book
[2:04:45] all right unified by the word she makes
[2:04:46] herself ready not with a regular creed
[2:04:49] like esther when esther was to be chosen
[2:04:51] to stand before the king
[2:04:53] she didn't adorn her themselves with all
[2:04:55] the things
[2:04:56] but she adorned herself with a sweet i i
[2:04:58] told you earlier i didn't have this
[2:04:59] quote i do here it is
[2:05:01] adorned herself with a sweet meek spirit
[2:05:05] that's what the bride is adorning
[2:05:08] herself with
[2:05:09] with all the fruits of the spirit
[2:05:12] following
[2:05:13] amen well we want to we want to put all
[2:05:16] the fruits of the spirit up front and
[2:05:18] you know what praise the lord i i just
[2:05:21] you know i know i i treat everybody like
[2:05:23] a
[2:05:24] mad dog a chainsaw and a whatever
[2:05:28] but praise the lord i believe the
[2:05:31] message
[2:05:32] no sir meek contrite
[2:05:36] spirit are you listening paul haylett
[2:05:41] paul did you answer me
[2:05:58] what are we seeing in the mirror
[2:06:03] we should be seeing a nature change
[2:06:06] amen because if the old man
[2:06:10] still showing up
[2:06:14] isaac i'm going to tell on you buddy
[2:06:17] so they got him this cutest little fuzzy
[2:06:20] dog
[2:06:21] i mean i joked with him that's like one
[2:06:25] bite size for a coyote
[2:06:29] we were joking about their little dog
[2:06:31] it's a sweet little thing i have to
[2:06:32] admit
[2:06:35] and then isaac comes out of nowhere and
[2:06:37] he goes yeah you know brother brown said
[2:06:39] about the white dog black dog
[2:06:40] well you know they got this black lab
[2:06:42] that's about this big
[2:06:44] and they got a little white dog that's
[2:06:45] about that big
[2:06:47] and isaac got this just weird smirk on
[2:06:49] his face he says i guess you can see
[2:06:51] what we've been feeding
[2:06:52] [Laughter]
[2:06:56] i just thought that was humorous in the
[2:06:58] natural
[2:07:00] but saints let me go back to this in
[2:07:01] serious no
[2:07:04] we have every one of us proven
[2:07:08] that story that the prophet told
[2:07:13] what we feed is what
[2:07:16] we reflect
[2:07:19] all we have to do is feed on a negative
[2:07:22] spirit for one day
[2:07:24] and we are negative we
[2:07:28] feed on the holy spirit on the word of
[2:07:30] god
[2:07:31] and a lot of this goes away well you
[2:07:34] just don't know me i'm just naturally
[2:07:35] cranky
[2:07:38] oh well i just naturally know someone
[2:07:41] who
[2:07:41] changes nature
[2:07:44] amen i don't know if you can still find
[2:07:48] it or not
[2:07:50] it's burnt into my memory
[2:07:54] into my thinking brother gideon ratif
[2:07:58] 2007 cloverdale bible way
[2:08:01] missionary conference preaching
[2:08:06] i always call it the cycle breaker it
[2:08:08] has a little different breaking the
[2:08:10] cycle i think is the real title
[2:08:12] cycle breaker breaking the title
[2:08:14] something of that nature
[2:08:17] if you're struggling with your nature
[2:08:22] want you to go i'm pretty sure you could
[2:08:24] find it on their website
[2:08:26] my you know it's 2007 but they have
[2:08:29] quite extensive archive
[2:08:32] listen to that sermon we serve a god
[2:08:35] that doesn't
[2:08:37] cover over
[2:08:40] we don't serve a god that puts it in a
[2:08:42] closet and says just forget about it
[2:08:46] we serve a god amen that breaks that
[2:08:49] cycle
[2:08:51] our family is like this we're irish
[2:08:54] we're this
[2:08:55] we're that i serve a god who
[2:08:58] breaks that cycle changes that nature
[2:09:02] and fills it up with the holy ghost
[2:09:06] don't choose an excuse choose
[2:09:08] deliverance
[2:09:10] don't stand that because you see that's
[2:09:12] what the bride is adorning herself with
[2:09:17] not this world not religion
[2:09:22] christ amen
[2:09:25] could i go further
[2:09:30] king hazardous could no more rejected
[2:09:32] esther
[2:09:34] than he could have rejected himself
[2:09:41] christ can no more reject this bride he
[2:09:44] has
[2:09:45] called in this hour then he could come
[2:09:48] to that day and say i reject
[2:09:50] myself as a savior
[2:09:54] i reject myself as a healer i reject
[2:09:58] myself
[2:09:58] as a provider couldn't do it
[2:10:02] the devil wants you to think he's not
[2:10:05] going to provide for you
[2:10:06] the devil wants you to think he's not
[2:10:08] your healer the devil wants you to think
[2:10:11] he hasn't purchased your salvation but
[2:10:14] we have
[2:10:15] an answer for the devil amen

[2:10:49] a royal priesthood a holy nation
[2:10:54] of peculiar people that's right you know
[2:10:57] one of the things this man
[2:10:59] wrote in his
[2:11:02] little discourse of holiness is dead
[2:11:06] is that the people got tired of being
[2:11:11] viewed as a peculiar people
[2:11:16] they got tired of standing out
[2:11:21] and wanted to be included
[2:11:24] [Music]

[2:11:30] inclusion that matters to us
[2:11:33] is right here this is the only inclusion
