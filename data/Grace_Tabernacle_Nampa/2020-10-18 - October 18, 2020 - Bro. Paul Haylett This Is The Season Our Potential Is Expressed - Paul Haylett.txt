morning hallelujah thank you lord amen you know just in our studies sometimes you just read a little quote here a little quote there and you don't use it but somehow it lodges in your mind and you know just thinking this morning about some quotes that i was studying a certain thought and you know brother branham's basically i'm gonna twist what he's saying just a smidge you know he's saying some people got confidence in their church got their anchor hook there some got confidence in their pastor and they've got their anchor hook there but i say this morning my brother and sister it's a revelation amen people say oh no we're anchored in jesus but we're nazarenes we are anchored in jesus but our pastor our church our and they've got i just want to be just completely anchored in jesus not don't want to be anchored in jesus plus something else amen just simply anchored in him amen maybe we'll i didn't go ahead and put it in this in my notes this morning but maybe we'll touch on it uh just uh i like to give credit where credit's due i don't want people to misunderstand uh but sometimes sister jerry as she's listening through the day will send me quotes and sometimes they're just profound and and uh as you look at that you know you just realize see the prophet of god even today we'll we'll read a quote and we get to it he's he's speaking of a nature i i'm saying something but i'm not saying it but i want you to get it now why would he not just say it because it wasn't for everyone it needed an anointing of the holy spirit to speak to that individual and when the anointing of the holy spirit speaks to that individual it brings it to light right i mean how many of you we look at be baptized in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ see once that's opened to us we read that and we look at that and it's like yes there's no conflict this is the same exact words but without revelation without revelation people are like nope we're either over here or we're over here sorry i can take both i can take both because the word has revealed the content or the intent amen we recognize that glad today hallelujah amen well let's just stand and go right into the word i just want to speak to you this morning in the season that our potential is expressed now we look at this my brother and sister um so so many things tied together and god help us the lord help us to to do this because when i say tangent i don't believe anything that you would vain that you would go off into the word as a tangent but uh sometimes it's very easy to start in a thought and you get to a certain point and and you go and then after a while you're like now what was we talking about but it it's just so beautiful amen it's so connected together hallelujah uh let's just turn to revelations 19 and 1. um it is good to be in the house of the lord with each one of you and uh those that are missing from our presence i just thinking of brother bob and sister joanne amen how many are thankful for coven now come on saints now look i want you to look at this for a second on one side we stand over here and we say we believe the holy spirit can keep us from any disease any trouble any pestilence hallelujah but god opened the heads to job hallelujah and praise the lord those of you that never were affected we are certainly envious but praise the lord those of us that got sicker than sick amen we're not in a hospital we're not on a ventilator we're not on the death's door hallelujah i don't know how people want to interpret that but i'll tell you to me it's just the same as never having got it in the first place because god's hand come down brother sergey as we were texting i don't know time flies back a ways i was like brother how are you feeling he said well brother paul i'm just doing the work therapy method amen he had work he had to do it he just got up he went and did it well i can tell you that sister jerry and i went down to mountain home we kind of committed ourselves to a deal there and we got up way before the sun ever rose at night we didn't stop working till the sun had already set and i thought oh my what have i got myself into and i thought yes brother sergey thank you amen work therapy hallelujah i'm going to get up in the morning god's going to give me strength to make it through this day and i'm not going to think about it any other way it's not woe unto me i can do this i can do all things through christ jesus amen hallelujah revelations 19 1-9 you know as time goes on i love this scripture more and more after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power unto the lord are god for true and righteous are his judgment for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up forever and ever and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped god that set on the throne saying amen hallelujah and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude hallelujah amen that's my hallelujah and as a voice of many waters the voice of a mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth can we say that this morning for the lord our god omnipotent reigneth amen we got nothing to fear saints let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready oh you know i don't like that maybe it's a little complex to be redundant i feel like oh i just keep but my brother and sister there is much more in this that the fact that his wife hath made herself ready that means she completely believed he told her there was not a doubt not a delay not a procrastination not a maybe for some future time but she completely believed what she heard said i'm going to get up and i'm going to make myself ready you know i don't want to throw sister jerry under the bus but she made a statement that she might not even remember making while we were in mountain home working she was she was sick her bones hurt she just whatever we slept terribly et cetera et cetera and one morning i rousted her and i said honey get up fix me breakfast and she said i don't want to but because i love you i will hallelujah this old flesh sometimes saints just doesn't want to push back again well to see you this old flesh sometimes just wants to go with the flow this old flesh sometimes is just like i have not enough strength to even resist the spirit of laodicea oh but lord because i love you and because you love me lord i'm gonna go ahead as it were and get out of bed and i'm gonna do what i need to do oh thank you thank you thank you lord oh hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife right she's identified his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints oh my goodness i read this saints in my heart just burst god granted us this just happened it didn't just kind of oh look what fell our way god granted that you and i could partake of his righteousness rapping ourself amen reminds me of a little deal that i read this people were famous they were rich and this woman she was quite discerning in a way for probably worldly people and she started searching for a wedding dress and they had her and i don't mean to be crass forgive me but they had her in these skimpy sexy wedding dresses lots of flesh showing she didn't say no i'm a christian i don't wear that right but there was something inside there she said this is a special day the only time in my life that i'm going to get married i don't want to look like that and they come with another style of dress and another style of dress and another style of dress and another style of dress and one day a friend of hers says hey i know a young woman not very well known she's not famous but you ought to give her a chance let her show you what she thinks you ought to look like oh saints you just think about my thought you'll catch and this young woman comes in there and here again i'm not beating crass but she just has the lady basically in her undergarments don't need anything else here and she starts in with this silk that was some something silk from a certain silkworm in india that was it was extravagant it was expensive but it was also sensuous in the sense that it was so fine it was so soft it was so and she took the whole bolt of cloth and she says where is the dress she held up the whole bolt of cloth and said right here and she started to wrap it around her she brought it up here and she fluffed it here and she wrapped it there and when she was finished she was covered from head to toe in this fine linen yes sir and she says now bring a mirror and when she saw herself oh when she saw herself she said this is what i want to be married in i look like a lady i look like a queen i look regal yes sir oh hallelujah it's an interesting story because you see it just been draped around the lady now the young woman when she said this is what i want she had to somehow tack it all together to make a dress out of it but you see that's what the preaching of the word has done it's taken the grace of god's word and it's wrapped it around this and around us and around us but when we start to walk into the marriage supper it doesn't fall off of us amen we have become the word we are wrapped in the word we are the word hallelujah i hope you catch a gist of that story i cut a lot of details out but that woman it was there what was it just fine linen that's what she was clothed in she didn't have to expose herself express herself project herself she just allowed the beauty of the linen that she was wrapped in to become her beauty hallelujah and he saith unto me blessed are they which are called i heard that call unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god heavenly father we just asked lord today that you would just speak to us lord you know my heart's desire as i come behind this pulpit each and every time lord let us only speak your word correct us silence us lord anything that would be our own thought or contrary lord bind it and loose the word father to your sons and daughters loose the word to us lord the very words of life that change us that draws forth it bring forth the expression of who we really are truly are called to be we thank you for this day lord and those that are not with us for whatever purpose may your holy spirit deal with them lord go out to them touch their hearts stir them father lord the time is drawing nigh we ask now for your blessings for your purpose to be manifested in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated all i can say is this morning saints just say a quick prayer that the lord would just help us to stay on our thought amen as it would be coming to a great intersection that has many many avenues we just pray this morning to follow the avenue that the lord desires for us revelations 1 and 19 verse 20 also we look at this he says now at this is this is the start my brother and sister not really the start but it it it is the beginning of the expression that god give to uh john as he is here this book of revelation not revelations amen not a multitude of it but it's one continuous connected revelation this is why my brother and sister you know not to belabor it but just to put this when god opened the six seals if he had left the seventh seal undone which was redemption according to the prophet amen the coming of the lord if he left that undone then we would have a a avenue that we would come to and we simply wouldn't know which way to turn but by god's grace he opens these things up he connects it together do we always uh understand it can we always explain it like some kind of theologian no my brother and sister but something stirs in your heart that you realize you know what god was talking to me now the problem we have in the message is people believe that god was speaking to the whole multitude my brother and sister he calls a church out a people out of the church amen the church will have a revelation they'll be rejoicing sing and shout and say thank you lord but that group of people that was called out heard something more than the rest of the group amen now does that make you and i special as some kind of uh you know big headed intellectual kind of people no it doesn't what it does is causes us to rejoice that even though i cannot explain it amen and you couldn't go find it i'm not speaking from paul here the prophet of god talks about this amen now see these things cannot be taught but yet we come to church and by the preaching of the word we are taught but yet we cannot teach the revelation of jesus christ it is a revelation it is god himself coming many times in our darkest hours many times in the desolate places and god dealing with us and opening himself to us revealing himself and as we would look at this and realize what god is doing he he comes and and as revelation 1 19 he says write the things which thou has seen so john has seen something and it's there he's now following now look my brother and sister god would have never revealed this to john if john wasn't an obedient servant many people would say well praise the lord i've got a revelation the lord spoke to me and i'm going to do this but it's contrary to the word of god look you don't even have to go pray and labor over what to do or what to follow if it doesn't line up with the word then it's simply something that somebody's just speaking they might be anointed they might feel that it come from god they might feel it's a direction to go you just go study the word of god the prophet of god just saying and i'm trying not to preach another thought here but when makeo was dealing with you know they said throw him in the deepest of prisons and he and we'll deal with him when we come back and he just oh was he a rebel was he mouthy no but when he spoke up he said look if you come back at all i'm false amen because there comes a time that the word must be anchored the prophet of god said the nail must be clenched amen we're in that hour saints no longer just a random message where hey god sent a prophet oh hallelujah we might throw one at you at the end of the service here depending on what the lord leads but look at this now revelations 19 write the things which i'll have seen the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter so the past the present the future was all laid out in a great cinematic uh view before john where he saw these things happen now look my brother and sister this does not mean that john had a complete revelation of what he saw but god chose to use him as the master penman uh uh to to write out what was happening you see my brother and sister if you wonder about the presence i was asked one time do you feel like that that today is uh greater or more or something you know it's a message uh greater than paul's message or you know it was kind of a convoluted question and they were looking for just a yes or no well my brother and sister i'll tell you i believe that we are in right now the greatest time in history and you say well you mean greater than even when the prophet was on the scene yeah i believe actually greater than when the prophet was on the scene oh i can hear him go i've got him there he's fault no my brother and sister you see the things that the prophet spoke had to come to pass and we are now in the season that is coming to pass and so we are seeing now is a is the manifestation of a prophecy greater than the prophecy itself i believe it is because if there's no manifestation of the prophecy then we're doing but when the prophecy comes to pass you are recognizing that the power was placed in the spoken word and it was spoken forth by a man of god amen what if no more power touches that prophecy you see then the prophecy becomes now be careful here that's right the prophecy if never fulfilled was literally a waste of time i want you to think about that seems like a pretty direct statement to make right a prophecy unfulfilled was a waste of time amen now don't start looking through there saying well we haven't seen this we haven't seen this we haven't seen this because there's things happening on this earth right now my brother and sister that you and i have not a clue about there are things happening that is bringing about the word of god that you and i may never know things close behind doors of important places of government and of religions and whatever that we will never see but if we are aware of what the prophecy said would happen you don't need every detail and what the problem is is we've got detail finders they're not looking for the finished work they're looking for details i've got to have details well i'll tell you what my brother and sister i'm just looking for the finished work amen the word of god said that these things would come to pass before the coming of the lord amen i'm not concerned about what president's in office what beautiful woman supposed to fulfill this what religion is supposed to do this i'm looking to the finished work and that finished work is not even taking place on the earth for you and i because we're not earthly creatures it's taking place hallelujah the marriage supper of the lamb amen the time and the place we stand before the throne and we worship the millennium which we get to praise him for a thousand years and walk out on the ashes of the wicked and people are worried about whether this little thing here who's a beautiful woman well they fought this person and they prophesied of this and they said of that my brother and sister why just a waste of time the prophet of god told us in so many words don't get sidetracked that's right don't get sidetracked in the mysteries of the seven stars which sauced in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks and the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou saust are the seven churches now you'll notice here my brother and sister i just want to throw this in maybe a future topic you'll see here that there is only seven stars amen there's not seven and a half there's not eight there's not six there's seven amen now we're either very confused and in the wrong message if we believe that we need an eighth that's right come on we believe we need something plus oh my brother and sister the prophet of god now we i don't want to get sidetracked but but he's when my work here is finished the lord will take me home so i've got a prophet that didn't get his job done he's got to come back no come on thanks and i'm not trying to be facetious i'm not trying to pick at somebody i'm just telling you seven angels to the seven churches and god took the messenger home when the work was complete hallelujah but you say we're still here that's right that means he has deposited everything we need to finish this life hallelujah everything we need don't need not someone now are we still finding nuggets out of the message i'm not talking about that we are finding nuggets out of the message we are making the connections hallelujah but we don't have to come with a new revelation amen and so as god works in our lives and this is opened up to us amen we are able by god's grace here again i'm not one of these people that so much oh got the revelation got the revelation but it needs to be a revelation to you that you were called hallelujah that you can i say it again you need that revelation that you were called it wasn't an accident it wasn't a happenstance god called you to the marriage supper of the lamb hallelujah amen blessed are they which are called oh hallelujah amen now i want to just backtrack just a moment this morning amen revelation 18 we won't put it up on the screen or anything but i want you to see right before revelation 19 which is talking about the marriage of the lamb revelation 18 17 18 is moving here and what we're seeing there in those chapters is a uh judgment on the whole babylonian system now many people would say no that that was the roman catholic church well okay you can put it right down to that but you've got to understand the church is only the physical manifestation of the spirit behind it amen so what you would say oh we go to rome and that that's that my brother and sister yes of course seven hills so many things scripturally it all ties together but you have to understand it's the spirit and you go through the message here again we're not going to sign track into these things the prophet of god clearly shows us that spirit is not confined within the roman catholic church amen in fact in one place brother branham says that it's a spirit of denominationalism amen that's the babylonian spirit so what would the babylonian garment look like amen it would be the garment of denomination amen well hallelujah we're not talking about baptist this morning or methodist this morning we're talking about the message amen we're talking about where people have put on that garment and if you're not part of our place right here you're not part of this group or our little system around the world then then you're not in at all well i'm sorry i just don't see that in the scriptures you're talking about the body of believers unless you're talking about that body of christ which makes up that glorified body around the earth amen from every nation kindred tongue so as we look at that and realize that this babylonian spirit is coming down now revelation 18 is speaking very directly uh if you haven't read it in a while just read it remind yourself of how direct god is speaking and the bringing of judgment it's speaking about how that this system has been judged and this system has been found guilty amen so that spirit that babylonian spirit when it causes one now catch this here when it causes one to exit the word amen imagine as though the word is your little room the prophet of god was talking about amen amen now look i i don't want to get in deep and i don't want to be controversial with you but that little room my brother and sister you study it in a spiritual sense and you pray over it revelation of jesus christ was inside that room amen and they walked out what happened in there well be honest with you i really don't know i walked in there in this condition follow this i walked in there in this condition and i walked out a brand new man i walked out a brand new creature in christ jesus amen it wasn't an indoctrination it wasn't an impersonation it was a revelation amen and what was that that was god coming down right into this sacred heart place that he has reserved in the hearts of sons and daughters of god now you can look at these things my brother and sister and say well we're looking for a a more uh uh uh natural uh understanding well for the sake of time this morning i'll just have to let you uh just follow with my words uh but they are there in the message the prophet of god turned it around he says well now we see these natural manifestations he said where the natural manifestation is there must be a spiritual amen well you see the churches you see the world you see groups you see things coming together i don't harp on it be redundant that word is redundant but my brother and sisters you see we don't need to create our own unity the word is bringing unity the word is bringing the bride of christ in unity oh get this now i might catch flack on this i don't really care the word of god is not bringing me in unity with you it's not bringing me in unity with you or you or you the word of god is bringing you and i in unity with christ the word and when we are brought into unity with christ the word then we have unity amen we can't have anything else but the unity or the love of god perfect love if we are in unity with christ we can endeavor to be in unity with one another and there will always be some little friction like an individual that visited our house recently as they were leaving for the evening said i don't know about this brother paul every time i come to your house i step on a goat head how many times have you stepped on the go head lately maybe that was just a reminder there's no perfect world sorry we don't like our goat heads either i don't like my badger nature either i don't like my my myself amen but when we become one so much with the word i can look oh praise the lord now don't take this judgmental but i can look past your faults i can look past your back your skin because i'm looking to christ and i see christ in you so i can't see the badger skin that's it that's why in the natural we will never find a unity that they're searching for in the body of believers because until we only see christ we will see each other and i don't like some of your habits oh was that your thoughts being telegraphed to me or was that mine being telegraphed to you it's a circuit come on saints there we should we should be able to have a tad bit of humor in our life come on you all if you'd be honest would lift a hand today and say brother paul you've said things and done things we didn't like come on some of you be honest with yourself yeah come on the rest of you know i'm telling the truth well hallelujah if i had a mirror big enough to cover the sanctuary you could just look right back amen but you see that babylonian spirit causes one to exit if you can envision amen it causes one to exit the word because as long as you stay inside of the word the prophet of god said satan can't get to you so we got to exit outside of the word for that babylonian spirit and that spirit gets on people and they say well i i just won't be a part of this i won't be a part of that i don't like this i don't agree with that okay fine whatever just make sure you stay with the word amen well praise the lord now this had always come around like a person is speaking highly of himself and i don't mean it that way but if you're staying with the word and you're saying with the word and you're staying with the word and you're staying with the word and we disagree whether it's apple pie or cherry pie i use that as a simple thing yeah do you know that sooner or later you're going to bump into me or i'm going to bump into you because if we're in the word that's right regardless of some little difference that we have we never exited the word are you following me we will come back together and our differences will be dealt with because we are in the word [Music] but when we are in isms amen so when the babylonian spirit causes one to exit the word god will not judge them without warning that's right i want you to think about this god will not judge them without warning that's right now i want to just bounce back to uh what i preached the other day and not on the same thought or whatever but speaking of abraham and lot you see back when he was still abram he had a directive of god to leave all of his kindred he had he had a word from god to move or separate himself and yet god in his infinite mercy and grace aren't you don't you just love his infinite mercy and grace amen so what happens abram he just can't quite bring himself to that place now i hope you see the big picture this morning abram can't quite bring himself to just pack up and leave his nephew maybe he felt uh responsible for him you know that he was too young too moldable too influenceable that he needed to kind of guard him and god in his grace and mercy doesn't slap abram down and say look i told you boy but what he does is he allows this this word that was given to him to separate himself it allows him to step outside of that word [Music] and go for a season amen and what did he do he faced all the trouble of a mixed multitude he faced all the trouble of the three kinds of believers he faced all of the trouble of not doing all of god's word amen i love this part right here because it's so painful sometimes i want to sit down and just cry god allowed abram i just like to refer to him as abraham because that's really who he is amen that's who he was he had one name god gave him another amen sister sarah i was thinking about you about six o'clock this morning i'm just reading there where the prophet of god is talking about changed her name from sarai to sarah the name of a princess hallelujah i thought praise the lord sister sarah and look i'll just throw a rose out to you i believe you're a princess amen hallelujah but you look at this my brother and sister what happened was is god just allows him to go on until abraham is like lord i need a separation lord i need to get away i need to get away from this lord amen hallelujah i'll tell you what happens many of us that struggled with things in our life through the years past god let you get so sick and tired of being sick and tired of sick and tired of sick and tired of sick and tired of sick and tired until you begged god to deliver you amen god didn't come and slap down the ultimatum amen we'll mark you like a thief in the abrab world and we'll cut a hand off and everybody will know you have unbelief god didn't do that god let us go until we come to the place that we're like lord i'm so sick of my condition lord help me lord help me yes sir amen amen i don't know about you but i'm ready for a complete separation amen oh i'll tell you now god as we we shared there i know that's been like a month ago i know you might not totally remember those things but lord stir your memory see what happened is god gave abraham and lot see god didn't just put the decision-making on abraham or he didn't just put it on lot right every one of us has to be a partaker of the decision process amen so god giving abraham and lot a chance to make a conscious decision now the difference of conscious decision and unconscious decision is my brother and sister we'll see sometimes that decisions are simply made for us you are driving down the road and you realize um wait this is the on-ramp to the freeway and it's three lanes and there's no way i can get over that's really a unconscious decision you were unconscious and missed every sign that pointed to the fact that you had to get on the freeway but now there's nothing you can do about it but a conscious decision is right or left i get to choose i have fear or i stand on the word amen that shouldn't be an unconscious thing i just accidentally trusted the lord no such thing i just accidentally had fear no no such thing see god was bringing them abraham and lot to the place they made a conscious decision every circumstance like i said the other day and i believe this with all my heart not doctrine just something i believe that if lot had said i'm staying up here on the planes you know because i got this great big herd of sheep and goats and cattle and whatever i'm staying up here you can have the plane down there and soda they'd have been a revival in sodom because abraham would have went down there and said in the name of the lord i bind every evil spirit and symbolically by the word of god would have just started sweeping sodom clean and there would have been nothing the spirit of sodom could have done about it are you with me you because we've been given power over unclean spirits amen come on saints we've been given power over them that shouldn't even be a you know a secondary thought to us so we look at this now this conscious decision but abram abraham by the word of god see i love this because god will never force the hand the holy spirit's a gentleman amen amen abraham step back you choose amen and whatever you choose i will take the opposite amen it doesn't say if he had an hour a day a week a month a year but it come to the place he made the conscious decision i want that that's where he went see that's the different saints between satan stumbling you are tricking you and you choosing right the conscious decision is you choosing to be whatever unbelief stumbling and falling is a unconscious i don't believe and we're using the word accident but that's you stubbing your toe and falling down but the holy ghost in you gets you back up cleans you up and you come to the place that you stand and say hey this is who i am this is my identity amen so so i i just throw this out and i need to move on i just throw this out to you which way are we pitching our tent it's really what it comes down to we don't need to go in a whole big process and waste a lot of time about do you believe are you a believer in this end time message this this this and this which way are you pitching the tent just stop right now and look at your tent and say which direction is my tent pitched and if you don't like the direction your tent is pitched today pull up the stakes turn that thing a different direction amen and drive those stakes down and never change it amen hallelujah are you with me amen now look i i just got quite a bit on the plate here sorry i need to hurry along now let's take john or saint luke 17 30 and watch what jesus prophesied there saying as it was in the days of sodom it'll be the same now remember notice this is at the time that the son of man would be revealed the revealing of the son of man now we can look at it i don't want you reading i'll let you stop now we usually look at that in the coming context of our day as it was in sodom talking about historical is what we're going to see today at the coming of the son of man are you with me so that's how often i don't mean to imply that to all of you but i believe that's what the majority of us actually just draw that out place it right in this day and say okay as it was in sodom this is where we're at but i want you to see there was more elements involved than just the fact of what it was in the days of sodom there's elements that make up the depth of the story now my brother and sister i i'm not trying to apologize for myself and i'm not trying to to whatever uh sometimes sister jerry's just like you know paul you like gave so many details nobody knows what you're talking about and i realize i do that i do because i i like sometimes the details because to me the detail makes a difference and i'm not picking on sister jerry i'm just recognizing sometimes i just add so much in the story that that people are like okay now did that happen in the 17th century the 18th century because that was just way too much to have happened in the 21st this is at the time that the son of man would be revealed the revealing of the son of man now the son of man was actually revealed potentially now stop reading revealed potentially now he doesn't my brother and sister say he was revealed you know why i hear i'm going to read between the lines you people that don't like reading between the lines i'm sorry here we go push pause the reason brother branham uses the word potentially is not everyone saw this reveal this was not the merchant on the corner this was not the shepherd in the pasture this is not the whatever over here and over here you see this was something that clicked yes that's right for the believer the son of man was actually revealed potentially just for a few moments there just before sodom was burned now that man was elohim look at this now two angel messengers going down to lot down in sodom but who oh i hope you catch this but who is with those that will bring forth the promised child amen it wasn't excuse me it wasn't two messengers it was god himself hallelujah and it's not in this hour people are like oh this great preacher in the message it's great here i'm sorry my brother and sister it's not a great preacher that's bringing revelation to the bride of christ it is elohim himself it is not another voice make the connection i'll get sidetracked here but somebody reign me back start pulling right now but look when the prophet of god comes and he said i am god's voice to you was that lifting up any flesh no my brother and sister not was the potential revelation of elohim himself coming down and speaking lip to ear of the bride of christ now i am speaking to you amen that man was elohim that was gone for those that struggle sometimes maybe i shouldn't be so harsh on this but if you struggle with the godhead you just go study what the prophet of god talked about god in you the holy spirit is god all these things you know what i'm just going to go ahead and throw this out here amen brother alex amen how's those words go the holy spirit is god's prophet to you brother alex can you find that real quick amen those words it doesn't come up a whole ton of stuff so you'll be come on saints you've got to understand we got to get a better balance maybe on the godhead than some of our teachings man because we got people that that are thinking god's not in me i've got the holy ghost but god's not in me i'm sorry you're confused somebody hasn't taught you correctly amen the prophet of god said this is all god the holy spirit jesus christ it's all gone amen now you look at that my brother and sister and realize now what brother branham is saying here that was god jesus is god and god was revealed potentially right there for a few moments to talk to abraham in the investigation judgment amen oh think about this this was not now look at this we see lot has made his decision went to sodom and here is abraham sitting here now my brother and sister i'm sorry god will not allow anyone to make it without being judged people say oh don't judge me the word says oh don't you judge me now you judge me it'll come back to you no no i'm sorry they missed the whole revelation of him you get a judge yourself or you get to be judged oh god help us this morning lord help us to judge ourselves i tell you saints i'm not talking about a harsh condemnation but i want to encourage you today investigate yourself uh very uh strictly very uh deeply amen and judge yourself on that just for a little bit the son of man was revealed the son of man elohim do you see it church congregation says amen well we take another place where brother brown was speaking to billy paul and he says you know i said this and this billy paul he says yes did you get it uh uh yeah yeah daddy i think so dad said there wasn't but what is that 3 or 4 or something the whole church that got it open our eyes lord that's right amen open our eyes lord don't let us just intellectually grasp something come on saints intellectually grasping it will not open it to you and i that's the truth that's exactly right that's it the son of man elohim was revealed just for a few minutes and for the very next morning she was burned when before the sun could come up again you see what's happening there my brother and sister there is there is such an anointing of the intellectual realm brother brown talks about no the worst mistake you can do is send your young men off to seminary did he do he called it cemetery you send them off what happened we're replacing the leadership of the holy spirit with an intellectual understanding and knowledge the prophet of god says knowledge will not bring the presence of god oh god help us when you find yourself grasping something in the word i encourage you stop and say lord don't let this be intellectual to me lord i want this to be the anointing of the holy ghost that's opened my eyes so that i don't just have a bit of knowledge hallelujah right my we got all these programmer kind of people amen brother alex brother isaac uh brother chris and they type in x's and o's and all this kind of stuff that makes these things happen right and it's kind of cool right because i can't do it of course i haven't seen them make a cornfield grow lately either so i i don't have an inferiority complex but now look my brother and sister all the x's and o's and all the type it in on the screen and push enter doesn't make it real i won't go too far in depth i've got a i've got a relative you can say something and then he'll be over you can see it i've caught the pattern now you'll say something and then he'll just kind of be over well google says well i don't really care what google says but i can tell you if you're swinging a two-pound hammer and your hand is in the way google never told your brain what that felt like [Music] intellectual conception never moved you in the do it take your phone right now even if you want to google siri what does pain feel like until they put prongs on the end of that phone and that siri tells you to put that on your chest yeah siri google can't tell you what pain feels like nor can it tell you what revelation that's it did we find that quote brothers hey man let's pop that right up real quick amen now look i i i'm gonna say right here i'm cherry-picking this and the reason i throw that out is i want you to go and investigate to make sure all that's being said right here but you know what when we start arguing over profit and believing a prophet and this and that brother brown said this one time is that sufficient for us to believe it or do we need 100. you go back and find the point the holy spirit is the prophet of this hour do i believe that there is a prophet in the land oh my brother and sister the earthly prophet that god used to walk on this earth that we could have as brother branham talks about several places we could have a point of contact he talks about how oral robert tells him to reach out now and touch the radio or the television have a point of contact well god sent us a prophet in the flesh so that we would have a point of contact but look what that point of contact told us the holy spirit is the prophet of this hour he vindicated his word proving it the holy spirit was the prophet of moses hour the holy spirit was the prophet of michael's hour the holy spirit which wrote the word come on come on this holy spirit the word of god says that men were anointed of the holy spirit to write the word of god so you could take this and say wait now men wrote the word of god no they never because i can tell you what it's like when your mind is completely blank and you're studying for a sermon you can sit 25 30 40 50 hours but without a spark of anointing you'll have no more to preach to the church than when you started but when that anointing hits you that spark comes down all of a sudden you can't write fast enough oh hallelujah amen the holy spirit which wrote the word comes and confirms the word no i'm just going to throw this on there i'm just going to throw this on there i just can't help myself i have stood and i will continue to stand i have been criticized for making this statement and i don't really care because i believe it's the truth and i believe if you analyze it you'll believe it's the truth my brother and sister the miracles that took place when brother branham was on the scene amen he discerned the hearts we just was listening the other night sitting in bed listening to a service there comes right down in the prayer line and brother branham's talking and then he mentions a city where somebody lives and he says oh somebody thinks that's wrong holy spirit so in tune that those people had moved that very day or the day before whatever it was right right and people are like he missed that one no he never no amen amen is that the vindication of malachi 4 i maintain and i will till there's no breath in this body you are the vindication of malachi 4. because if the prophecy as i spoke this earlier and i spoke it intentional if the prophecy is prophesied but no manifestation but i'll tell you one of the reasons i believe this message paul one of the reasons you believe the message you got more than one i got a list so long and knock you down one of the reasons i believe this message is because i'm seeing the vindication of this message hallelujah we could get if we could afford to do it and they would let us we could all climb on a plane today we could fly to africa we could fly to europe we could fly to asia we could fly to australia we could fly to south america we could fly to the other end of the united states and we can walk right into an assembly and you'll know that this is the same presence of god that you experience day by day the same power of the word the same thing's happening hallelujah it's not a man-made creation otherwise you'd get on a plane fly to johannesburg and it would be uh brother gideon retief flavor you could go to europe and it'd be brother uh gerwald it'd be his flavor and you go to the east coast and be their flavor and go the west coast and be their flavor but i'll tell you what i've witnessed it you can get off you can walk in the door many years ago sister jerry and i went to south africa for to speak in a youth deal and we've gone in there on a sunday night and uh the brother said brother paul we're having communion at the church i know you're tired you guys just been in a plane for 20 some hours go to church or we'll take you to your room jerry and i look at each other church we want to go to church they're having communion the brother's up there they're already in the process of doing communion but the brother's up there now i don't say this to not pump anything up i just want to tell you this is my first hand witness of god doing and the brother is there serving communion he's making some comments and i'm like i just preached that on wednesday makes another comment that was the sunday previous is that orchestrated of man amen i'll tell you what i believe every word my prophet has said i say that natural and the spiritual side too hallelujah if i did not go find me a new religion but the world's just fresh out of religions that are worth following so what are we going to do please don't misunderstand me okay let's go back to where we was brothers amen hallelujah so there can be no organization left neither can there be any further advancement than what's going right now amen amen we've got a new revelation sorry it's on my axe grinding table i haven't finished grinding it yet so you'll just have to put up with a little longer when somebody can stand when the word of god timothy and titus and a prophet of god brings it out and speaks against it and yet people will say oh the prophet gave us the prophet spoke of a divorced preacher exemption in the message sorry i'm sorry it's still on my axe grinding table it won't be done until i have ground that thing past the handle and it's just no good because my brother and sister the word of god says you deviate one word amen but you know what people will go well that's just an opinion no that's false doctrine that's false and i don't care how kind the old priest is that brings it amen hallelujah so thank you for being patient while i ground my axe that's all right see there can't be no organization neither can be further advancement right prophet of god himself says look if i come and said anything different remember concerning the seals and that and they said oh brother branham the things that you could write and he says no no oh no no no i couldn't add anything to this it was already in the word it was already there i can't add anything to this amen for she'll burn before the day breaks again the revival is over across the nation there ain't going to be no more revivals big sweeping revivals this nation never receive it you might have an intellectual gathering but i i mean a spiritual revival we've seen all of it you know what that tells me saints look i'm not trying to make a great emphasis and twist anything or turning you know what it tells me you don't need to go search out the latest and greatest in this message you need to believe and live what's already been placed in your hands that's all we need don't get under some inspiration we go over here look what's going over there they're dancing down the back of the pews i'm sorry you don't need that you don't need that that's no sign prophet of god says over and over again those things speaking in tongues all of this but there that that's no proof that's no sign that you got it but the word amen becomes our sign hallelujah we've seen all of it i hope you're catching it i'm saying it in such a way i'm saying it in such a way that i i hope you get it see you know what that is that was the curve ball come on the curveball did you see it amen because if you see the curve ball you hit it i'm sorry to deviate and i'm not much into sports but there's this guy that was just he's retired now but he was one of the best hitters in baseball and they said how can you be so consistent he said well the minute that ball left the pitcher's hand i could tell you where it would be can you believe that or should we just blindly swing come on this is a revelation of the holy ghost in you that when the prophet spoke and he says now i spoke this ins i sang in such a way that i hope you get it the bride of christ is like it's going to be right here there a flying off over here this ain't flying off over here i know what he meant and then people are like how can you say you know well i don't know how i know i just know praise the lord that's the truth a fine minister said a while ago brother branham if i could just have the joy of the lord in my heart come on say that's it what do you think about it i don't care what any preacher will tell you there's times that the joy of the lord just escapes you you get up and you preach because well i told the pastor or i am the pastor or whatever and this is what i do you don't always get up behind this pulpit my whole praise the lord i'm fixing to tear the arms and legs off the devil tonight sometimes you come as the ox burden bearer and you come up here and people might even recognize it well the pastor sure seems under a burden today well praise the lord he's still the same ox amen don't throw him out and find you a young ox amen he's still the same ox i'm kind of petition yo brother random if i could just have the joy of the lord in my heart i said son the revival is over see wow that was up forget about the joy the lord buddy the revival's over okay oh why would i want to be a preacher then why why why hmm go back for me brother alex please i should learn how to go back here son the revival is over come on saints what if what if your pastor minister just come out here told y'all 21st century laodicea closing the light according to what was drawn placed in the church age book we're down here just darkness revival's over church man a lot of people would be just like i knew i was wasting my time oh yeah i i i knew we should have just done something i could be a lay minister in the methodist church right now if we just stayed there according to some of my relatives many many years ago i probably could be kind of some hierarchy in the mormon church i'm sure that would impress all of you come on the revival's over i could just have the joy of the lord in my heart what was it he was going by what emotions feelings okay that's right okay that's why i want to come back that's it now the stabilizer have been put on the ship great fearful waves are out there before us but we know just beyond the wave yonder we're nearing the shore see i don't have to stop and say i'm my feelings my feelings my feelings i know we're nearing the shore see we're nearing the shore just stay stable just stay in the word amen what is this i want joy in my heart now this is the prophet's answer just stay in the word [Applause] amen stay with god no matter how you feel what anything else stay right with the word it stays stable and when you see all these great big old clouds around us and storms coming and atomic bombs and everything else they're talking about but our oh come on are you with me but our stabilizer is right straight in the word my stabilizer is not my fellow friend ministers in the message and it is not grace tabernacle it is not these intellectual things my brother and sister is straight lined up in the word that's right you say brother paul we just sort of been beaten up as a family sir been beaten up as an individual i understand there's some pretty big waves out there there's some big things but if you will realize that you are stabilized if you will in your mind make the position i claim i'm stabilized by the word of god i am not tossed about by every wind of doctrine every doubt every fear i'm stabilized amen thank you lord amen reminds me man i knew years ago and it's a sad story my brother and sister but everybody said well you know he started out in and basically high school started becoming unstable started things affecting him and and you know it just got worse and worse and worse got out of school and everybody's like yeah the doctor said he's just gonna go until he's completely insane but that young man caught up caught a revelation uh uh he never completely got delivered from this but his mama and his daddy were going to the institution doctor going to the institution up going to institution go to the institution this boy would walk around the city of nampa and people are like this dude is definitely nuts but you know what he'd say when he walked down the street i am not crazy then people are like yeah you are i am not crazy i am not crazy you see when i knew him many years ago i haven't seen or heard from around i thought yeah you're crazy but you understand where he was at he caught a revelation he was pushing back against that and the very people that should have been sitting there saying you are not crazy we're going yeah you are look how you act you're going to walk around saying i'm not crazy but you know what he never digressed amen he still functioned he still had a you know kind of a menial job but he had a job he had all these things that happened but you see they never caught the revelation oh god not lord please don't let grace tabernacle us ever catch the revelation oh that poor brother that poor sister that poor situation that poor thing woe unto me hallelujah what are you going to confess my brother is healed my sister is healed my brother's delivered my sister is delivered i've got liberty in jesus christ i am a son of god satan take your grubby hands off of god's property that's what we ought to be confessing i don't care what your symptom says amen our stabilizers write straight in the word amen amen god said it would be here we'll crest every one of them i want you to lift a hand and say i'll crest every one of them hallelujah we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they can't sink us they can't drown us you put us in the grave we'll come out again that's just all there is to it there ain't no way in the world to keep it down there we'll crest every one of them because our great chief captain is calling amen oh hallelujah at the other side oh my my oh my why did i think i could preach this in this short of a time oh my goodness sister emmy come on why my brother and sister because this is our season for our potential to be expressed don't go looking for another day when i i'll be an overcomer another day no don't come another day and say i i'll get ready as the bride of christ another day amen stand on the word right now and say you know what in fact oh i know there's some people get a little upset around the message when you start talking about we are the rapture the rapture is taking place in us etc they're looking for some event to take place but i'm just going to put it out here this day my brother and sister hope it don't stumble you but you know what you see i am the rapture in process come on come on i don't care if you say about brother paul i saw you kind of lose your cool the other day [Music] well praise the lord i repented you didn't see that part [Music] and brother paul i saw you with dirt on your knees where you fell down the other day that's right but you didn't see it was me dusting that off [Music] because see it's a finished work absolutely it's done it's done i believe my lord he said this work i have began in you i might finish someday no he said i will and you study out with the prophet of god what the word of god chose us that word will is the evidence of a predetermined value [Music] hallelujah i got a place at the marriage supper of the lamb i got a place at the millennium i got a place before the throne of god i'm not hoping i am testifying that's right hallelujah because there has been a predetermined value that has been declared oh hallelujah oh hallelujah [Music] oh maybe we need to go to a four or five hour service amen i don't know oh hallelujah [Music] well as i told sister jerry this morning i said i don't even know how this service will come out i threw this in it's like that don't fit i left i threw this in this won't fit but i left it i threw this in and i threw this and i threw this in and i said none of it fits line upon line word upon word hallelujah what's god doing my brother and sisters he's filling in all the voids hallelujah well problem we have in this world we live in today is when you got that puzzle with a cow's foot too many people are pulling something out the top of the tree trying to put that foot up there we don't need to put that foot up there you know what the prophet of god told you if you don't understand put it on the shelf that's right so you might have to take that puzzle piece it's pretty funny story actually i read some time back this guy had three pieces left in the puzzle [Music] and his grandson come and says grandpa he said what's wrong and he goes well i got these three pieces they'll go in in the puzzle here and i can't find a place for him the young man it describes in the story very graphically how the young man scooted over on the table in front of his grandfather and looked him in the face and he says that's grandpa because only one of the pieces belongs in this puzzle come on saints let's not let's not take satan's pieces to the puzzle let's not take all the rest of this and try and mash it in i've been beating this thing into my puzzle no sorry just stay with a simple word amen if your puzzle doesn't have a cow in the top of the tree don't try and put him there hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah man this is just terrible it's just terrible i i need to stop i want to want to go on i just for a moment thanks just for a moment i want to jump back now [Music] amen elohim come down in the midst prophet of god said he come in more faith right all he does change a mask not a different god amen same god different mask amen see if we can recognize that god himself bound himself to be the same yesterday today and forever that's just that's not you and i are trying to hold god to something god said nope that's how it is i am the same yesterday amen if i healed you i delivered you i touched you i spoke to you yesterday i'll do it today i'll do it tomorrow amen amen hallelujah now look at this god's visit to abraham what was it it was actually judgment you know that yes sir look at this what he does he comes there and he tells him that you're going to have a child [Music] grandpa i just can't you know it struck me here a while back just really struck me here a while back just studying that here's sarah and she's down there we got a king and he's just all wow look at that girl he's either blind crippled or crazy that's a woman he's talking to or was it hallelujah look my brother and sister this was not sarah with max factor this is sarah with the manifestation of the holy ghost oh hallelujah don't go looking at yourself well i was and i'm this and i'm that oh god help me no i'm sorry look at you with the manifestation of the holy ghost amen you're not oh pardon me sisters you're not that old lady hallelujah come on brothers you're not that old man you are a new creature in christ jesus hallelujah that's how god works my amen come on look at this now look at sarah sarai she's there and you know as as elohim is speaking this is not elohim's messenger this is not elohim man with a book i hope i don't offend nobody this is not elohim's tape recorder this is god himself [Music] come on sorry here i can hear another axe grinding nowhere in the word nowhere in the word saints come on nowhere in the word did god say i'll be with you even in you press play [Music] it's blunt but as it gets blunter the rhetoric gets blunter coming out amen we'll just push back against it well we can't trust preachers fine don't trust a preacher trust the holy ghost trust the holy ghost come on look here's sarah serie she's in the tent behind them and in her heart my brother and sister i want you to catch this in her heart she laughed me have pleasure with my lord i don't want to be crass right but as an old woman she recognized there's no way my husband's going to make love to me just not you know what syria syria sarah's issue was she was human [Music] oh come on let's not put her down to an unbeliever don't put her down to make believer don't put her down to some whatever she was human and every sense told her this can't happen but look at the infinite grace of god he didn't say done i've got a new one for abram [Music] she was part of the promise she was part of the revelation of the opening of the word now i'm going to throw a curveball at you are you all ready i used to actually be pretty good pitcher okay come on sorry you foul balled that brother time if god didn't intend for ephesians 4 to be manifested in our day he'd never put it in the word of god amen sorry people got one thing and they'll stand adamant on it that's fine i'm gonna stand adamant on it because i saw when it was thrown and i saw right where it would end up and by god's grace brother tim just kidding with you i get to hit it out of the park don't expect me to fall for it if god didn't want his word he wouldn't have put it in his mind god didn't want it to come down to be manifested in the day that we live in he would have never put it in his word come on you add one thing you take one thing away this scares me saints i'm not here being rude i'm not here being vindictive i'm actually afraid for the approach that people are taking because the word my brother and sister has come down and declared to you and i that we are here and what is it it's not lord help me maybe i should have stopped this message that has come down it's no longer a 20th century message right we're in the 21st century it wasn't to show us the potential of a prophet come on saints catch this don't let this slip by you not to show the potential of a prophet that was that a prophet's words would show your potential as the bride of christ that's right then you could see who you were yeah i tell you i don't have any struggle at all to look at brother branham's life and say it is a vindicated prophet of god who obviously was in the presence of god used of god to bring open up this word but what about you and i well unto us what one to us unto us no i promise you with all of my heart i believe this is the truth that the prophet of god could come and stand right here today he would tell you this message is about you [Music] hallelujah oh hallelujah amen okay you know what i gotta quit being a liar amen oh my i know i've told the truth go back look this up there's a lot more goes with this my sheep will hear my voice jesus said like he said there the sign how do you know he's here listen the holy ghost is right here now i hear him speak with tongues interpret i see him do signs and wonders and see him even the last sign was to be a messiah sign jesus said just what was the last sign that abraham had just before sodom burned that the angel stood there god himself in flesh come on did you catch it saints amen we're right here right before the sight the prophet of god is showing us did he put big bold letters did he blow a trumpet no because he knew the bride would catch this and recognize that it's god on the scene right before the judgment falls it's god on the scene oh hallelujah look less people would misunderstand if i heard tomorrow that the prophet was speaking anywhere within the reach that i could get to i believe i would find a way to be there but if i didn't make it there i'm still a son of god i'm still an overcomer still got the holy ghost still believe the word hallelujah amen well see we got to get a balance to this oh i was safe because i shook someone's hand no it don't work that way i was safe because i made it to calvary and that precious blood that precious blood amen the angel stood there god himself in flesh we took that haven't we abraham called him elohim god stood there a stranger and watched what he called abraham called abraham his new name he just got it a few days before instead of abram he was abraham called sarah her princess name as i said earlier i thought of you sister sarah abram abraham where's your wife sarah how'd he know he's married how did he know he had a wife how do you know her name was sarah come on she's in the tent behind you i'm going to i personal pronoun i am going to visit you according to the time of life well hallelujah i hope you all forgive me here i am going to quit on this i hope you all forgive me here for being so presumptuous as i get older i just get way more conscious it's just terrible it's just terrible i'm reading between every line and words that jump out and that's like yeah look at that word hallelujah amen we got a little dunamis friend all the way through the bible somebody pushed the level boom [Music] praise the lord i'm so excited to be the bride of christ i just can't hardly contain myself for the things that god's done for me [Music] don't get concerned church if you come and you see all them shocked paddle things like they have in the airport finding the walls because a day is going to come when you i don't want to sound harsh and i'm not being facetious but the day's gonna come when you yeah deal i'm talking to you i'm gonna catch a revelation praise god of what being the bride of christ i see people express more emotion in the spice aisle at winco than they do in church [Music] i just love ginger [Music] come on sounds humorous doesn't change i want you to take it serious it's about time that you look at the word and when he said you're an overcomer that you would say i am an overcomer he said i was that precious beautiful i'll tell you what i'll tell you what i'll just leave it simple this i want you to go to song solomon and read it from the back some of you are going to be like aha gary this is way too intimate okay well praise the lord find your business you've waited for 25 years sarah and your heart laughed and said would i ever have joy with my lord think i'm open past the years of bearing he's old too and the angel said why did sarah laugh saying in her heart it just can't happen jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man i'll just close right here just plain and simple how dare you how dare you question how god will bring his word to passage [Music] how dare you stop and say how can this come to pass how it just can't happen how dare you what you should do is just say lord thy will be done i don't care what it takes lord you said you would shake heaven and earth and i'm here to take you at your word lord let it start shaking let it start shaking amen i got a husband i got a wife i've got children i don't care just let god shake let god move let god do what god wants to do let god be god amen hallelujah okay we'll have to save the second half for another day oh my but but just in case there's some really awesome awesome quotes in the rising of the sun amen i mean there's some really good quotes let's see we're on about page five or six in the rising of the sun amen but we're gonna go right to the end of it right here and we'll close with this and as he being the groom [Music] the bride might come forth [Music] aren't you glad we have a screen because i'd have you guys all confused what not as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because what's the cause it's a part of him wow wow this bride has to come forth a prophet's message must produce a bride of christ because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the bride it can only manifest [Music] you see my brother and sister i don't care how deep the revelation is of the preacher or how shallow the revelation of the preacher is how that this pastor over here just has such this incredible a grasp on everything and can tie the greek and the hebrew and the aramaic and all this together and then this poor pastor over here all he can do is tell you jesus christ the same yesterday today i believe what do we lean to the one that breaks it all down one that breaks it down or the one that says i'm not very smart and i can't put this together but i found this reference guide and uh my prophet said it's a road map so i i just uh well look here's point a [Music] here's point b wow i don't know how i got all the way from a to b but i really like where b is at [Music] and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoken see they didn't have anything they didn't make the bride they didn't provide the way for the bride they didn't give strength to the bride they were not what brought the bride to the bridegroom they were just eliezers helpers [Music] and it can only manifest it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because this is the part i want to get excited about are you already with me come on are you all ready with me she that's me is flash of his flash hallelujah it can't go to a marriage supper without me because i'm flesh of his flesh amen i am bone of his bone life of his life oh come on saints don't be timid i am power of his power now look at this oh come on i should have told the brothers to highlight this she is him hallelujah so she is here in grace tabernacle this morning that means he is here in grace tabernacle this morning i am manifesting my portion of the body of christ hallelujah as a man and a woman are one and a woman taken from his side she has uh oh careful what spirit you take church [Music] come on i'm sorry i'm just enjoying myself [Music] she had taken a spirit amen it was not a dominating female we'll tell god when where and how spirit no she took the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both the mechanics and the dynamics what is it the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dynamics oh hallelujah i should have just read the whole quote but it literally is about eight pages and i had to preach it to you but go right back there my brother and sister and you look at that the prophet of god says it don't matter how much gasoline you got it's got to be a spark well it's that holy ghost and power and it's keeping me alive oh keeping me is is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is is [Applause] hallelujah oh thank you lord yes thank you lord hallelujah i'm sorry saints i just get just a tad bit excited amen i think about it what's god doing god didn't come around say now in these final last days i'm going to come down in the midst of my people and i'm gonna take my little pole here pardon me i'm gonna take my little pole here and i'm gonna prop my son's arm up so he can praise the lord hallelujah eat this i don't need a prop i'm telling you probably the bride don't need her prop saints she's got that holy ghost and fire it's burning inside of her you know in that sermon brother brown talks about like i said i should have preached it to you but brother brown says you know you got two cars come off the assembly line they're both the same both the same both got gasoline [Music] there's no spark come on come on saints do you know where there's fire there's heat and where there's heat there's movement and wherever there's movement there's life and wherever there's life well come on i'll let you just finish that where there's life praise the lord come on i want life saints you say oh brother paul you're just trying to get us excited yes i am i want you to catch the revelation that you've already been built by the word of god you've got the holy ghost in you which is gasoline and the spark is present something has to happen [Music] [Applause] take off the e-brake take off the e-brakes saints lord oh i gotta stop i gotta stop hallelujah well this whole world can never hold me [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that the lord is good oh it tastes like [Music] is honey in the wrong amen did you enjoy that this morning amen well if we have to go to four or five hour services [Music] let's sing number i think it's 9.75 i can't remember what he is his word will stand key of f

will endure and forever don't listen to the voices of the world cut up in fear for the word of god proclaims a victory he gives his children courage to confront the gates of hell with a sword that conquers every enemy his words [Music] god's word is true his promise is sure his love will enter and forever his word will stand sing the course again his word will stand his word will stand [Music]
