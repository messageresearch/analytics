a blood [Music] that caused a life that paid my way death its pride when it flowed down from the cross my sins were gone my sins forgot there is a grave that tried to hide this precious gave me life

to proclaim that he's coming back for you there [Music] the is that heals the sick the lonely finds it has the power to freeze the bound as chains they fall [Music] upon the ground so pour it out to change my soul and let his criticism glory flow because it lives to make me whole i owe my life i owe my all so i come to tell you he's alive to tell you that he tries every tear that falls so i come to tell you that he saves to shout and to proclaim that he's coming back for you [Music] there is a grave that tried to hide this precious blood [Music] that gave me life but in three days he breathed again and rose to stand in my defense so i come to tell you he's alive to tell you that he trusts every tear that falls so i come to tell you that he saves to shout and to proclaim that he's coming back for you for you this blood this precious blood this christ the one who came for us oh this blood this precious blood [Music] this life is the one he gave for us [Music] so i can't tell you he's alive [Music] [Music] that he said [Music] and he's coming back [Music] [Music] is [Music] shout out [Music] [Music] this [Music] is that fall [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this precious [Music] [Music] that [Music] and he's coming back for you hallelujah coming back for you amen you know i was just it just struck me i thought as a minister i can come and take that and i've come this morning to tell you he's alive hallelujah amen we're not here to talk about what's wrong with the world we're not here to talk about what's wrong with the church we're here to talk about some believers who have believed the word of god and taken a holds of that word and said you know what this word that was spoken is my word i'm identified in it and i am delivered in it hallelujah hallelujah you know we can we can look a lot of things and you can look back through the years and you can awaken the morning and satan can the very first thoughts in your mind say remember when you did this and you can stop and you can say oh my brother trevor it happened this morning when the devil come in like a flood right there behind it the standard that's right rose up and satan said remember what you did this many years ago and right behind it amen i don't take no credit for it but i asked sister jerry to sing that song this morning because right behind satan's words were those words he's alive he's alive hallelujah wipe every tear from our eyes change our world around us and remind us i'm alive i'm alive you don't serve a dead god you don't serve a god of history you serve a god that's here present this morning and he wants to speak to you he wants to speak to me he wants us to remind that he is alive and the power of the word has been unleashed hallelujah look saints i want you to think about this if you haven't if you didn't listen to wednesday night you weren't here you didn't hear it i i asked you go back listen to wednesday night we have got to put our hand in his hand we can't just say i can do this i can do this i believe the message i can do this you've got to go put your hand in his hand and every doubt that you have don't be ashamed to say i had doubts come on saints this morning we got to just be honest with ourselves we've had doubts we've had things that have sidetracked us we've had things that derailed us and we're there but the thing is is just like thomas we have to come and say you know what i've got to see jesus and i don't want to just see jesus i want to put my hand in his end i want to know and god is faithful oh amen just to forgive us of our doubts of our weaknesses is it good be in the house of the lord today hallelujah hallelujah other thoughts in my mind but i believe i'll just leave them to rest hallelujah i want to speak to you this morning once again on redemption's manifestation i didn't have them put this on the title page because there's just way too many things there but my brother and sister we just want to look at this once again as a part of our thought of our call to action amen so you see when something moves you either respond or you don't now let me phrase that in a different fashion you either accept see sometimes we water this down god bless you it's good to see you back in the house of the lord amen you see what happens is we water things down and bring it to a place we say oh i just disagree come on i want you to ponder that it doesn't work that way you either accept or you reject there's no i disagree we either accept what the word says or we reject what the word says the bible clearly shows us to reject even one word is that loss to our soul you see we got to come down and get a reality saints just like our nation is living in a fairy tale that it can spend trillions of dollars and has nothing to back it up but it doesn't matter we already have prophecy we already have the word of the lord that our nation's bankrupt we see that now if 40 50 years ago they were spending money that could not be repaid in the next 40 years what are they doing now but i don't want you to be concerned about that because it says in the scripture that when you see that day coming look up rejoice your redemption draws nigh this must this must happen the world must be degraded it must come why is our states excuse me while i just touch on this why are states now having to pass laws that say you can't teach perversion to our children in school should never even be a question should never even come to the forefront but you see the corruption has come to the surface and now there's still a remnant you might say of people that are pushing back and saying no you can't teach our children these perverted things in school why because prophecy must be fulfilled now i i need to remove that little lingering that just got left in your mind prophecy must be fulfilled and the word said there would be sons and there would be daughters that would reach out and take a holds of the word and be so hungry for the things of god that they would be willing to sacrifice even their very life for it but we live in a day my brother and sister while it's happening in places around the world that there is direct persecution of christians i want you to realize that living in the world we live in right now you dying to the gospel is you pushing back against the cares of life is you pushing back against the flesh you pushing back against all of the spirit that would come and make you a lukewarm believer because remember they're the ones that get spewed out they're part of the plan right they're right there in the scripture right they're they're just as much of the scripture as you are my brother and sister but they're spewed out and you get to hear the words well done my good and faithful servant well now lest i depress all of you some of you are frowning at me and looking sad let's just stand and go right into this scripture i want to speak to you today on room for growth amen it's a lovely thought i hope that it stirs your heart as it has mined this last week as we have been just pondering and studying uh it was it was nice i was appreciative of brother chris i just felt like the lord opened that door uh you know to have him speak this last wednesday because there's a time that even the preacher needs to sit on the pew and hear the word preached amen and so it was just to me it was very timely a real blessing to me and uh so this week i've been able to just ponder uh this thought just focus entirely upon this thought and i had a hard time i must admit this morning uh putting the final you might say uh uh thoughts to to the page but we'll ask and have asked the lord's blessings upon this first peter the second chapter 1 through 10. amen certainly greet all of you my brother carl and sister chrissy zeller greets the church amen brother carl was sharing with me a little video clip of how that now uh certain in the eastern part of the united states and in europe they're now coming out with atm machines that have several forms of id that you can use one of them will be your eye your palm print your identification card or even your vaccination card my brother and sister here again don't get depressed look up your redemption draw nigh the scripture said you won't buy or sell without that mark well praise the lord i've been marked i have been marked oh thank you lord the prophet of god said now it will be giving your will or your life your agreement to to their work it will not be a microchip it will not be it might be in the forehead but that's because you have turned not you they let me rephrase that they have turned their thoughts in agreement but i want you to look at this my brother and sister you're marked this morning the holy ghost has come down just as sure as a death angel went down through egypt and down through goshen my brother and sister everyone that had the blood over the doorpost that death angel passed right over that household why they were marked by the blood and we stand here as a people this morning marked by the blood of jesus christ we have put it over the doorpost of our life we have put it over our lintel my brother and sister that surely as god looks down upon it and he will send judgment on the earth he has already marked sons and daughters of god and they are receiving you see we say well it's not the mind it's not the mind it's not intellectual but your intellect plays a part your intellect hears the word of god preach processes and the heart is what punctuates it with amen hallelujah because the mind can argue the points but the heart responds to the word first peter 2 1 and 10. we're for laying aside all malice can we agree with that yes all guile i say all hypocrisies and envies in all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious can anyone hear this morning say you have actually tasted that the lord is gracious i would hope every hand would be raised this morning to whom cometh as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood hood and to offer up spiritual sacrifice acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold allah and zion achieve cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded now look at this my brother and sister the scripture tells us let me interject this right now the scripture tells us that it will come to a time that the people will be in gross darkness that's right now i'm going to just take it because i don't want to get sidetracked here but we'll see in this scripture my brother and sister through the ages god used gross darkness to confound the people times in scripture when they come in such a darkness they wandered around bumping into things and knew not where they went now you look at it we're living in a time that is in gross darkness and you say now now this kind of has a political overtone forgive me but i want you to catch this how it has to be expressed they in gross darkness are making decisions and doing things that we are saying how can they do that how that is insanity what are they thinking what are they doing and inherently we would say they must just be evil people but do you understand that they're in gross darkness and they're confused and confounded and in their mind it has perfect clarity but there's a man here who has already turned on the light we're not waiting for the light to be turned on look my brother and sister you can go out here in denomination and they talk about jesus christ they talk about the blood they sing some of the same songs we do they read the same scriptures and they go out and live a life that is confounding to the scripture because of darkness somebody ought to say thank you lord yeah ye as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifice acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in sign a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded oh i'll tell you somebody might say well they sound arrogant they sound pompous they sound this they sound that no i like what was said here it is not arrogant we have confidence in our god amen we have confidence in his word and he has shown the light on that word and the word is speaking back to you and i yes oh thank you lord unto you therefore which believe he is precious see without belief my brother and sister it's nothing precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of a fence i saw a little video clip i'm sorry to keep you standing but i just want to interject these things i saw a little video clip this young man is going to college he's a christian not afraid to express what he believes and he's done a little research he might say what it is so there's somebody else standing by obviously because he's not holding the phone filming this and almost to a person everyone that he encounters that he starts a conversation he interjects jesus christ in the conversation jesus christ jesus christ jesus christ and almost to the person you can see them go and many at the mention of jesus christ turn on their heel and walk away they've rejected the cornerstone and it's become offensive to them a rock of offense even unto them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed but don't you just love how the word of god comes it always puts this right there to remind you and i who we are but ye hallelujah somebody say it with me ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness out of confusion out of oh hallelujah called us out of my brother and sister into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy heavenly father lord just ask you lord this morning just give us clarity of thought lord let us be concise and precise to preach your word lord as we speak this i ask lord that you would just bless the hearts of your children today in the name of jesus christ amen may be seated as we look at these scriptures my brother and sister we could kind of put this in the context of peter is laying a foundation now it is the word of god speaking no matter where you stand right if you are disobedient the word speaks of you if you are called into the marvelous light the word is speaking of you but i believe as we look through the bible we will find that the word of god is especially precious amen to the believer it is there that we look and realize my brother and sister we're not living in a world i do not live sometimes in the flesh god forgive me saints forgive me sometimes we'll say a word comes across negative uh it's not my heart amen as god deals with us as we get closer to the throne it is not in our heart to speak ill of others and sometimes it is this a nature that we have as humans that we we tend to say things that they don't come out right sometimes we're trying to make a reference point but yet it seems as though we just criticized someone god forgive us for for that uh you know that we don't want to be caught up in that because i'm not here it is not my desire to to focus on the negative as it were that is in the world today but we're called to look into the word of god now you can take the scripture my brother and sister if you want to be the naysayer or negative person and you can draw out of the scripture how that it will be that there is going to be virtually no one saved and and you know woe unto us and uh how can this be and what must we do oh it just doesn't seem possible or you can look at the word and realize that you were chosen to be that generation you were chosen to be the ones that are holy and righteous before god that you were there and then let that be the expression of your life amen you know it is there that many times you know the attitude of what we deal in the world around us has an influence on us and and i mean this by if you hang out with optimistic people you will be optimistic if you hang out with negative people you will be negative and so it's there my brother and sister that i just desire that we as a group of believers christians would not look sometimes we have to recognize the facts of the world around us and the facts of people's behavior but my brother and sister let's look at the good that is around us let's look at the good in one another and i bring this out in this fashion because you see and i'm ahead of myself and i'm just going to go ahead and express it all through this scripture we see those that have come short we might say of the glory of god and if we lock them into that position we give them no room for growth [Music] a pastor could look out on a congregation and say well i i see what this one's done and i've seen what that one's done and and we can preach and we can do all of this but if we don't give room for growth that person will always be the liar the thief the whatever are you with me the word of god always gives us room for growth god has never constrained us that what you was is what you will always be but the blood this precious blood amen has come to tell us that we are alive because he is alive and we have been delivered because that is his power that is his plan that is his uh that is him amen and so if we are not careful we can lock someone into a position and not give them any room for growth amen but you look at this now you see because no matter where you stand but especially the believer god has called you to grow into a position you see the very scriptures that we were there amen as verse 2 we won't go back to it on the screen but as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow that's speaking of potential of possibility amen thereby now let's just go on here and go into the book of ephesians and just look here verses 7 through 16 but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of god now if god called you to be a son or daughter of god my brother and sister he said that his grace is sufficient for you that doesn't mean that you've got a quota that you must live inside it doesn't mean that there's a time that grace will run out for you his grace is sufficient to take you from the beginning to the end this work i have begun in you i will finish hallelujah i'll tell you what that just gets me excited my brother and sister to think about that according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascended upon high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now he that he ascended uh what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth oh i tell you what my brother and sister i think it's a scripture we pass over way too easily way too commonly that he went to hell took a hold of the keys of death hell and the grave and possesses that in his hand now satan has no power over you because he doesn't even hold the key to his own door whoa think about that no man in his right mind in the natural is going to put his key to his house out there and give it to the neighbor and say now every time i need to go through this door here i'll come to you and i will ask for the key it just doesn't even make sense but look at this our lord jesus christ went down down down down down down into the very pit and took i can see it now he just went right up there and just snatched that key right off the belt of the devil and now the devil doesn't even have the key to death he doesn't have a key to hell and he don't have a key to the grave i'll tell you what you ever think about that my brother and sister the devil is completely at the mercy of almighty god oh hallelujah and i'm his wife and i have been given permission up to the half of the kingdom so it's time for me it's time for you to rise up and say you know what i have some authority here i have access to the keys oh people are saying but they're still passing away no they're not passing away they're being promoted see we get the wrong idea sometimes my brother and sister as jesus spoke about lazarus don't worry about it he's only sleeping the little girls only sleeping my brother and sister why because jesus himself held the key not the devil amen praise god well hallelujah god's got a whole lot more keys you know i preached on that one time but i i kind of got away from it quicker than i should have i want you to understand that god's got the key to revelation also hallelujah and his here and the prophet of god said you should pray for revelation first and foremost what does it do come seek the key don't just say the door of revelation is closed i don't understand my bible i read the words but i don't understand it i guess i'll never understand it no get down get serious get the key hallelujah and when you get the key the bible will become a whole new book amen he the descendant is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things yes now i don't want to confound you with this scripture but this leaped out at me this morning i never quite read it this way before and he gave some comma hope i don't ruffle any feathers this morning he gave some apostles that's all they want they want an apostle come in they want a apostle to run their church they put all this value the apostle the apostle the apostle but if that's all they got you'll find my brother and sister apostles are setters in order establishers well that's good we need the body but if you want to be preached to like you're a sinner almost every service come on don't you think about it that's not the sum total of being an apostle right but they set things in order and they're going to whip you into order like a drill sergeant at boot camp and if that's how you want to live a christian life constantly being set in order but somewhere along the line my brother and sister you see we need a prophet and he gave some prophets now my brother and sister you can have a prophet and it's still not be the sum total of what you need he will reveal the word and lay it all out for you but a prophet is not going to be there now don't misunderstand me i'm just going to put it in these blunt words a prophet is not going to be there to hold your hand all the time right because you see the ministry and message of a prophet goes far beyond their natural time on earth are you with me and some the evangelist which comes back in essence i don't want you to misunderstand when i was talking about the apostles that that's all they do is just correct you but you see they set things in order they establish things and if you start off on the wrong foundation you have a hard time getting on the right foundation so apostles can be pretty blunt be pretty direct be pretty you know just uh a little bit but you know what you get to see that manifested in its fullness in an evangelist that's right i'll tell you what i've been around i've got some friends that are evangelists you know and and they are just those kind of guys that they will look out just following the leadership of the holy spirit they're not ashamed they're not embarrassed to come out you might be embarrassed when they get done i've set in services when evangelists come right out and just say the lord's revealed to me and appointed an individual and say you got a spirit on you you need to go in the morning and repent to your boss for the time and stuff you have stolen from him now nobody wants to have that preached in me you know it's on video cut the video uh you know but anointing on an evangelist why because he's going to stir you up he's going to stir you up and some they just like evangelistic services they just because they can go you know we always used to refer to it as a special meeting anointing you don't see somebody in church for three months straight and then there's special meetings and they're on the front row hallelujah special meeting anointing have i stepped on anybody's toes yet okay good i'm glad and some he gives pastors and teachers what is this laying of the foundation settling it all down now the way the word is written here saints i'm not here to promote the preachers so don't misunderstand me for why i'm bringing this out but you see some i i'll just reference myself so i don't have to embarrass anybody he gave some apostles i've got apostles and he gave some prophets i've got a prophet and he gave some evangelists i love evangelists well they've had a huge impact on my life and he gave some pastors and teachers you see some are going to get it all some get to choose what they want and they won't take no more but some are going to accept it all they're going to take all of the office and all of the things and the scripture says that this is for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ and here again i'm just going to throw this in i don't mean no offense it's just laid on my heart when i was studying my brothers and sisters some people don't really want that and according to the word of god i see where god put it in scripture but i never i haven't been able to find yet where he took it out so so he's not removed these offices from the perfecting of the saints some people got their idea my brother and sister now look this is be a little cutting but forgive me for it but my brother and sister a man who says he's a pastor who does not rightly divide the word of god he does not labor for the sheep he is not praying lord is this the right word if his deepest concern is choosing the title of the tape he's going to play then i will argue whether he is really called to be a pastor or not my brother and sister because choosing a title is not the same as laying down in the sheep code and laboring on behalf of the saints now here again that might sound like i'm pitching this for the preachers but i am not i am one of the harshest critics you will meet of preachers because my brother and sister they have a choice between being genuine or being a hireling they have a choice to labor for the sheep or to take the easiest way possible hopefully i haven't offended anyone i didn't mean it for that but you see till we come into the unity of the faith which is the word of god there's the only unity there is in the word and of the knowledge of the son of god into a perfect man into the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ now we henceforth be no more children okay so what is what is happening here is telling us here as we come into the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that is reflecting to us growth we're coming into this we're rising up into this position of the stature in other words we weren't always in that but we're coming up into it we're growing into who god called us to be oh thank you lord i want to grow hallelujah but look at this now that we henceforth be no more children what is he telling you you know i thought this might be funny except for i know i couldn't probably pull it off without messing it up but you know what i wanted to come out this morning and i wanted to look at you and say you know what saints grow up into the stature of a perfect man it's time for us to grow we cannot stay stunted i've used this example through the years my brother and sister if your child is little it just pops in my mind just because it is this what but uh our little brother samuel he's like a hundred and two three four five or whatever percentage of growth for his age right he's he's i hope he grows up into that the lord tarries i hope he grows up into that brother sergey i hope you have to stop someday in your life and say son hallelujah but mostly i hope it comes spiritually i hope that brother sergey would come at a time in his life he could look at his son and say look at what my son's grown into a man of god and that's what i wish and desire for each and every one of our children each one of us we can grow up into this maturity in the word of god that you look at and say now here is a mature person here is a person that is as we'll go in the scripture not thrown around by any wind of doctrine by every wind of doctrine by some wind of doctrine that it be that this strong and and it will be there henceforth tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftness whereby they lay in wait to deceive you see my brother and sister the ones oh i know this is going to be a harsh statement i hope you all forgive me i prayed about this and i just but my brother and sister you see the ones that will be deceived will be immature they will be as children spirits i'm telling you my brother and sister that when a church comes into maturity meaning this body of believers in particular when you come into maturity it won't matter what kind of man comes behind a pulpit and says something contrary to the word of god you're not going to just fall over yourself to accept that because you become mature in the word and you would look at that and say i'm sorry that doesn't line up with the word of god i just thought watched you strick put strychnine in our meal and you're trying to feed it to a sorry i don't accept that i'm not going to do it just because you have reverend in front of your name or pastor in front of your name or evangelist in front of your name if you have done something to hurt the body of believers we're going to stonewall you reminds me a little story a brother shared with me one time he said they were in some meetings and a minister which went on to go into some almost heresy made some statements and some brother there you know he'd been saying amen to the word and there was a what you would call a pregnant pause and and then the brother goes amen and afterwards this brother comes up to him and says why did you say amen to that he goes well it was either that or that's a lie and he said i thought that would be inappropriate but you realize it wouldn't have been because that's what everyone was thinking maybe i shouldn't have said that but you see my brother and sister comes down speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things you realize in all things means our children growing up in him it means our elders you know we we sometimes like well this is brother so and so he's been a christian for 50 years it doesn't mean he's mature as a 20 year old but we give deference well they've been around forever you know and they were with this person and with that person and no i don't mean a thing they don't mean a thing see they've got to allow they've got to grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which in every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part making increase of the body into the edifying of itself in love you know and i always whenever i read this scripture my brother and sister it always reminds me that we have to come to a place that we can speak the truth in love very very important speaking the truth in love now you look at this um these creatures called humans you know that's what the scripture calls you you're just a creature yes maybe wearing a few hundred dollars worth of clothes maybe all dolled up you arrived here in a really nice chariot and you have the creature comforts you wondered where that term come from creature comforts because even the world acknowledges we're just creatures this is totally inappropriate but if it was different it could be bear america some of you will understand what i'm talking about yeah see these creatures called humans have a tendency to become stymied now i want to ask you how many of you have ever thought about changing jobs but your list of why you couldn't was greater than why you could what have you done you've stymied yourself but what if i changed jobs and i didn't like it well then change jobs again all but then everybody in the church including the pastor would say you're unstable are you unstable or stymied you see when you become stymied you are afraid to take a step for the fear of the consequence you know that's why some people are in church that's right because they're afraid of the consequences of leaving if i leave maybe you know maybe something bad would happen won't be any worse than what would happen to you sitting here wishing you were left and i've heard so many times come on i hope you're in good humor this morning don't don't get depressed on me i've heard so many times oh brother i felt like in the middle of the service jumping up and shouting hallelujah why didn't you well i was kind of afraid what people would think huh that thinking thing stymied you hmm oh my [Laughter] if it's in order and it's led of the holy spirit it will be correct if it is just your human side your creature side god will set that in order amen so we have a tendency to become stymied because we we we feel like i could do this i i could do i had a friend many years ago let me just throw this in here i had a friend many years ago and i won't go into details of what the deal was but one day he had this uh this paper uh scratched on and all this thing and whatnot and he said paul i just like woke up in the middle of the night and i thought oh look at this this had worked so good and he had it drawn out almost like dimensional there you know and he goes how to do that and i said you ought to do that i said what i would do if i was you i wouldn't even go to work today we were doing construction work i wouldn't even go to work today and i would go find it you know uh some uh uh something like you know some plastic thin plastic some balsa wood and i would make me a mock-up of what you're thinking about here because i i think you're on to something and he was like yeah yeah yeah and he goes to work and he talks about it all day every day i got to hear it five and six days a week about this thing and then one day comes and man he's got the longest face you've ever seen this is probably eight ten months later longest face you've ever seen and he holds a magazine up and there it is and the man who designed it went on this is irrelevant but a key ingredient me a multi-millionaire why didn't he pursue it what stymied him doubts of whether it would be accepted doubts whether it was feasible doubts of this doubts of that remember the quote we just read to you the other day my brother and sister you got to dig down you got to throw the tin cans and the pots and the pans and the doubts and the fears out till you get all the way down to jesus christ you can't let any of that because my brother and sister the devil will put something in your life to stymie you stepping out on the word and saying you know what i'm going to act on this the word says i'm going to act on this the devil come and says but you know uh you know just it was just only a few months ago you told a lie so you couldn't possibly rejoice in god now you couldn't possibly claim victory now because because you did this or you did that or you come from a certain background my brother and sister it's there that satan is going to always throw something out there to stymie you you can either resign yourself to be stymied which depending on which dictionary you look in basically you can just say that the word stymie is to be hindered and as we said before maybe the devil might be out on the step crying because you're blaming him for the lack of something in your life when it really isn't him in charge at all he has no keys he has no keys saints come on hear me well this morning he has no keys to lock you in or lock you out you're the wife of the king which means you have keys to everything certain tendencies we have and i don't mean to use large words but this is the word that came to me so i put it in here we have a proclivity a tendency to go in a certain direction well you know i i've just never been a a real real spiritual person like brother so and so our sister so-and-so well i'm going to ask you why you'll be just as spiritual as you choose to be but it's never ran in our family i mean all the way back to my great grandfather and grandma you know they they never and my grandma and grandpa they never and mom and dad they never and so that's that's why i'm not oh so you have a tendency to just follow the family well maybe we all know what lemmings are don't we how many cartoons are there about lemmings one of them stops at the edge of the cliff looking down the ocean says to another why are we doing this i don't know but everyone else is doing it come on and they leap off okay that might be your tendency you think you think that you're a follower oh come on i'm gonna get rough on you now i don't like to hear this we're followers of the message no i'm sorry i'm not a follower of the message i am the message i am the gospel of jesus christ i am the bride of jesus christ i'm not a follower of this reminds me of a deal i come across a while back i don't really do the social media thing but every once in a while i spy on you i mean i look at people's stuff and that this guy had thousands upon tens of thousands of likes to some deal that he put and i thought well that might be interesting and i clicked on it and i thought this is the stupidest thing i have ever seen in my life oh i'm not allowed to use that term i'm sorry children it was the most ridiculously unedifying uneducational and empty and he had like 175 000 people who had liked it i think i'll follow him 175 000 people can't be wrong can they no they can be ah anyway forgive me very wrong thank you sister kerry yes i was thinking more on the intellectual level but uh now look a tendency to go in a certain direction come on let's just be real this morning maybe you have a tendency to get caught up in the things of life and and and you know you have a real problem with things and and you have a tendency to get in a certain vein and and people say well i'm just so tired i'm sorry that's why i'm angry i'm hungry that's why i'm angry i'll use that one because it's one that has been coined on me you're angry no i'm actually just angry i'm not hungry at all really i mean i could eat but i'm just angry let's not make an excuse out of it i'm blaming the sandwich i never ate on my mental condition come on i want you to think about this to go beyond the humor and think about the reality of it i'm gonna blame you know what this is not my fault my husband looked at me like yeah and so therefore i will act like and so it's his fault wow i'd like to have a little joystick to your expressions no you're in control of you the devil's not in control of you he has no keys and if the devil don't have a key you can't go blame it on someone else that they've got the key to your situation god's got the key to your situation trust god and act upon his word and have faith in god oh no don't worry about his saints no none of you get offended this morning i'm preaching to me and so far it's hurting because you see my brother and sister because we have a tendency to go in a certain direction i'll throw myself under the bus i worked with brother adam several years one day he looked at me and he goes my goodness paul you are the moodiest person i have ever met in my life same to you buddy because probably the reason i'm in this mood is you no no the reason i was in that mood was me i think that was also at the same time that brother adam said i think i should just hit you in the head with a hammer and get it over with but you see i don't move on to greater things because go ahead fill in the blank go ahead come on saints i want to ask you why you're not moving in heavenly places fill in the blank i'm not moving in there because we can arrange that and i'm not sliding this don't misunderstand me but we can arrange that answer from something everywhere from our childhood to our boss from our financial condition to lord this woman thou hast given me i want the real answer why aren't you in heavenly places why aren't you moving in the direction that the word of god called you in why aren't you rising up amen husbands why aren't you making your wife a queen wives why aren't you making your husband a king why well i have go ahead fill in the blank but the scripture says that our natural relationship is a reflection of a spiritual relationship ouch can i say it for you saints ouch wives will you say it with me ouch husbands come on say it with me ouch but no sir even started with adam oh no lord this whole circumstance is not my fault it is the woman you gave me lord had no idea she was so wiry she was so strong and she held me down and shoved that apple in my mouth come on are you with me i'm not going to move on i can't move on because of see what happens my brother and sister when you fill something in that blank other than recognizing you yourself or hindering your spiritual walk you will never do the greater work now who wants to do the greater work i hope this morning that i'm not coming across too straight to you i mean i want to come across straight to you but i hope it's not offensive amen who wants to do the greater work amen i believe every one of us here ought to be saying lord i want to do the greater work i want to be the overcomer i want to be filled with the holy ghost i want to be the example of what a daughter of god should be like i want to be an example of what a son of god should be like that's what i desire to do so my brother and sister are never going to move into the greater work if we're putting the wrong thing in the blank now i want to ask you where's your life going to go if satan's giving you advice you know there's that guy on the radio dave ramsey some people don't like him they don't like the way he speaks they don't like the way he thinks sister jerry and i don't follow his stuff 100 percent but i tell you what he was the guy that let me know years ago how i was feeling is because i was sick and tired of being sick and tired of being sick and tired of being broke so he started to implement his plan and what worked for us you might say but we did it one thing we did take from him was discipline and that was if we didn't have the money we didn't spend it so that cute little piece of plastic didn't become our banker amen now you look at that my brother and sister and realize that if satan is giving you advice dave ramsey says never take advice from a broke man now if you'll loan me a hundred dollars i'll show you church how to invest that no sir i hope you're i hope you're smarter than that don't take advice from a broke man oh my oh my can i just give you this startling startling revelation i mean it is very startling don't take advice from the devil oh you look pretty in that half a dress oh you look so masculine strutting around like that you look so fill in the blank i'm sorry i've already got i'm not preaching dress code here but i've already got god's advice on what i should look like we have god's advice on what we should look like how we should present ourselves some people i've heard it preached before well the word of god talks about wives with a meek and contrite spirit yeah bride of christ no no i'm talking about my earthly bride i mean i want her to like heal well how come when the lord spoke to you last time and asked you you refused but you want your wife and your children to line right up to what what are we lining up to say amen paul amen so is satan offering the advice or is god look my brother and sister there's so many scriptures we couldn't touch on it this morning speaking of the foundation of growth or foundation for growth through the scripture amen it's all over it's there everywhere just speaking for us all these things uh i could have brought you up many many many scriptures that either directly touch it or in reference to it now you look at this my brother and sister brother brahms speaking in the church age book and it's there he's talking about how the real tendency we have is a tendency to decline now have you ever noticed amen i don't speak nothing i'll just go ahead and name their names so i they won't feel embarrassed but um you know the minute that uh sean and uh uh gideon quit doing all them push-ups and sit-ups and chin-ups they're gonna look just like me and when they're my age they will look just like me i'm sorry to disappoint you brothers but i applaud them they're young you know sorry brothers but if you've ever been around peacocks it's your season it's your season go for it sorry i just couldn't help myself but you see there's a tendency to decline and we'll see when it comes to the spiritual my brother and sister i want you to give me a yes or no on this do we remain spiritual by just going to church no we go to church and we do all of these things because it's part of the regimen sorry brothers i included you that way it wasn't fair but i just love you so much i only threw you under the bus once the spiritual regimen the word of god's given the answer of the spiritual resume how we stay strong we don't do it by just going to church and saying god is real the devil says god is real the devil believes the bible he understands it better than we do but it won't make him spiritual amen so you see we have to come to a place and we have to fight against this tendency to decline in this spirit and brother branham says here just this yeah you know this looks very cherry picked and it is you go read before it you go read after it i saw this beautiful cherry on the tree i picked it what does the messenger church message the church teach us then teach us teach us not the growth in the spirit no sir it's decline of the spirit we have a decline all the time i cherry picked this out you go study it you have access to it you see what it is though is the nature if we don't go and some people say i can be spiritual without going to church that's good but my bible tells me not to forsake the assembling of myself together because the bible's acknowledging that is part of the ingredient of your spiritual state read your bible pray pray for others these are all part of the ingredient of what gives us a strong spiritual standing gives us the endurance to stand in the day that we are my brother and sister so it's there what this will do is a constant diet now part of the reason i brought sean and gideon into this conversation is as young men they themselves know that if they were doing you know a hundred push-ups and then they go on vacation or do whatever and they don't have opportunity to do that very next time they get on the floor a hundred push-ups is agony just in that is that not right brothers in just that little short time and and look as long as we serve god first seek ye first the kingdom of god exercise the scripture says does no good it's not but but my brother sister it's talking about when the spirit of the age comes we got these spiritually mentally morally defunct people that are very strong very fit very well there's nothing wrong with what they're doing at least i'm not gonna i'm not gonna speak against that's between them their parents and them but they know 100 push-ups two weeks later i'd get back on this 61. 62. ah that's good for today apply it to the spirit there was a while i know you guys won't believe this but there was a while brother paul was doing between 50 and 75 push-ups a day and i was doing some other things exercising then i got sidetracked i see that was uh wasn't 20 20. it wasn't in 2019 wasn't 18 might have been in 2017 but i'm going to get right after it you see what happens the mind they say is willing but the body is weak no i'd say the body is weak because the mind is not willing spiritual position for growth you have to decide i'm going to grow into what god called me to be come on that's right this is not not the most exciting the rate i'm going it might be one of the longest ones though so so it's a tendency now look i want you to understand the principles of growth it takes good soil we have the parable in the bible right planted by the roadside amongst the rocks good soil weeds briars etc right that parable we have a water amen necessary for growth and the scripture tells us that we must be washed by the water of the word so the presence of the word of god in our life the effect of the word in our life washes us you don't have to ask it to wash you you get in the word you get in the presence of god it will wash you too many people then they get distracted they go to church and they plan their future they plan this they plan that uh you know church is a good place i fixed a lot of things in church oh yeah i know you think i'm joking i'm dead serious why because my mind was somewhere else and i did not let me just put it this way you said here with your mind out there you will not be washed you will not change in the slightest you have to be here in body mind and spirit then the water of the word starts to wash you and we find ourselves being changed and then the last ingredient that is absolutely necessary for growth is sunlight and when you have the sun in your life my brother and sister your life changes it absolutely changes now look this might sound funny i i want to explain this in such a way that you'll understand now this is based upon ornamental plants okay but if you've ever been to a pot farm no no not that kind of pot ornamental plants they call them pot farms because everything there is raised above ground in a pot it starts in the greenhouse go over in the state of oregon the willamette valley there is hundreds and hundreds of these kind of farms yeah all these stores over here you're buying geraniums and this that and tulips and all these things right here they come out of a pot farm and they start off in a greenhouse with these little dinky pots and little dinky cups and a seed in it and it sprouts and it goes for so many days they've done this research where they it's very predictive it grows for so many days they pop it out of that they don't throw that little pot away they reuse it but they pop that out of there and they literally go and they move it right over here and transplant it into a bigger pot and then it goes for so many days and they transplant it to a bigger pot and so many days they transplant it to a bigger pot now what happens my brother and sister if they skip that process that little plant has now it has soil it has water it has sunlight it's going to grow but if it's not moved to another pot it will become root bound and i tell you our churches are full of root bound people because they didn't want anyone to come out oh pardon me saints they didn't want no one coming out disturbing don't you preacher disturb my world don't you dare try and pluck me out of my condition that's miserable my marriage stinks my children are falling apart i hate my job but don't you dare preacher talk to me about my life why they want to stay in that same little pot and they don't realize the whole time the roots are still growing but instead of growing out now they've turned back on themselves and pretty soon the only thing that's going to cure my problems is a bottle only thing that's going to cure my problem is an extra marital effect only thing that's going to is this only thing it is going to have a new car i got to have a boat i have to i can have this gotta have that i got it why because the roots have turned back on themselves they're no longer growing out they're growing back to themselves i must do this if i do this i'll happy does anyone here know what i'm talking about if i just had this i would be happy you get it now you're just unhappy with the payment but if i had this i would be okay and now you're unhappy with another payment you see it's got to be plucked out of that it's got to be disturbed its world's got to be broke up now i happen to know people that own or run a place like this my brother and sister they don't just pull that little thing out of that little round or square hole and stuff it in some other dirt over here but to stimulate the roots to break away from its position they actually grab it and crush it and then transplant it into new soil are you with me and you wonder sometimes well the preacher he got a little too personal i don't know i don't like this i don't like him look in my world you know i don't like him talking about my condition i don't like that why my brother and sister you've got to break those root bound roots and get them to where now they've got to go and find new soil and it doesn't happen just once in your life god allows it to happen again and again and again and the ultimate of it my brother and sister is this little seed that started off in a greenhouse is now planted in a pot and you take that pot home as it were and you dig a hole and you put all the right ingredients and and peat moss and a little bit of steer manure and compost or whatever you want to call it around it and you get it seeded in there and you know it says it should the root crown should be you know three inches above the yard so that it just and so you don't just say ah they don't know what they're talking about listen listen god knows what he's talking about saints listen we can't just do this any old way i don't understand why their plant looks so good and ours doesn't you didn't listen god says i want to i want to transplant you i want to take you from your position i want to take you from your situation you're starting oh you've gotten a bigger pot god's blessed you you have some understanding you have a little revelation of the word but it's time to be moved to another pot it's time for you to be plucked up out of that one and move to another place and then there is a place my brother and sister that god says you know what this world is not my home and so there's gonna come another day right here that god is going to puck you and i right out of this place we call home and he's going to take us home hallelujah amen now look at this if it's not moved it comes to a season where it starts to decline it's stunted and will never oh saint i hope you just grasp this you take in the natural a plant and it goes so far and that it's stunted not just set back a little bit but stunting that plant will never reach its potential can you see what satan's trying to do saints satan's trying to come down he's trying to make it to where we're so so afraid almost we're so resistant to the idea of god coming down and shaking our world that we just want to hold on to what we got our little position i like it how it is i'm comfortable and god says look i'm not going to move you unless you want to be moved i'm not going to force you to serve me and i know i'm just comfortable lord i get stimulated i can say amen once in a while my family's good everything's fine but the day that plant is stunted it don't matter what condition you place it in after that it will forever be stunted do you see what satan's trying to do he's trying to bind us down he knows that you're a son of god he knows you're a daughter of god and he's doing his very best to come along and stunt you but brother paul god answers my prayer that ain't got nothing to do with it anointed ones at the end time will give you a clear vision on what it is god answering prayer god will answer prayer my brother and sister for healings for deliverance for all of this and all they have is the authority of the word they never had the experience and you say how can that be well god god will honor that amen oh let me hurry along here now this is just lovely because the title says it all now israel in egypt was not planted that's right that wasn't their home they were just set out it wasn't their original home ground and a man that's a christian that rests his eternal destination upon some denominational creed he's not in his right place he was born to be free and a child of god to worship god but he's under a creed he can't bring forth his fruit yet something in him is longing to do it he shall be like a tree that is planted by rivers of water rivers pearl water singular many rivers coming into one channel in other words he'll be like a man in the scripture that believe all of god's words where the power and nine spiritual gifts can flow through one god into his inner most being you know i'm tired of apologizing and i'm not going to be ashamed of who i go to church with that's right but i'm entitled to my opinion too people don't believe in shouting the thing it is they haven't got spiritual joy and the joys of the water of life can throw flow through that's a whole lot is the matter with the branham tabernacle because that unbelief that's it oh our prophet is so kind and so loving so encouraging unlike some of these oh this is almost a direct quote unlike some of these preachers in the message that are so harsh okay and the joys of water life can flow through that's a whole lot is the matter with branham tabernacle wow sounds kind doesn't it like a grandfather be almost like a dad saying now there's a lot of really good young men around here except for my son no he just named it right to him he's speaking direct to them do we have the courage to change that today that's a whole lot is the matter with grace tabernacle because that unbelief the cares of the world had bound the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth that's the matter with our nation that's a matter with our churches they have no joy and the joy of the lord has departed brother branham goes on go ahead do the homework on this he goes on to talk about ichabod it is very direct amen no use planting or playing around my brother and sister now look i'm going to put this this way i i've got to get over this complex i'm not going to defend myself i'm not going to do i know what my heart is i know what my desire is but my brother and sister i can assure you this having been around a couple places on the earth that some preachers don't really want you to grow because you see it takes work to prepare the soil it takes work on all parts to to get the condition to get it watered it takes work to get it in position to get the sun to shine on it and it's much easier just to go ahead and move along with a half-hearted we are believers we believe this we believe that and just let it rest but i'm here to tell you my brother and sister that we're not just wanting you to sit down and say praise the lord god gave us this and it's good your tree is growing your life is growing this word is growing and it's time for you to get off and pardon me you can fire me if you want to but it's time for you to get off of your excuse wagon it's time for you to get off your little lazy bottoms it's time for you to stand up and say i want to be what god called me to be i am no longer going to sit here and offer up an excuse i am going to get up i'm going to let the word of god motivate me and i'm gonna go stand in the sun amen and when i get in the presence of the sun i cannot help but grow have you ever done this now sometimes our houses are situated as such but my brother and sister we did it when the kids were young well we we we did a lot of little things like that you take certain flowers or very receptive to this and you go put them in this window and they'll lean this way and then you go to the other side the house and put them in a different window with them leaning into the house and you go back the next day and they lean this way you see there's some that are just so attracted to the light they cannot help themselves i've got to be in the presence of the sun amen and it's time for us to just get off of our lazy bones and get to the place that we say i'm tired of offering up excuses you're giving an offering am i preaching too hard okay because i could water it down and finish this up if you don't mind you're offering up a sacrifice it's either praise or it's an excuse but you're offering it up the same let me say that you are offering up your life you will either offer it to him amen or you will offer it i just hate to say this because it sounds so harsh you'll either offer it to him or you'll offer it to the devil that's right amen but but no i wasn't offering it to the devil i'm sorry to tell you if you're not offering it to him you're offering it to the devil there's no middle ground there's not a broker show me a scripture where there's a broker now look okay jesus um we'll we'll give you these two if you let us have these three and these three are lefties anyway so it doesn't matter and so you're coming out better because these two are good and oh because we gave you the two better ones last time now we want these here and we'll get no there's no brokers there's no brokers it's your decision i want to know what you're offering today yeah come on i watched a video here a while back hope you guys don't misunderstand this they passed an offering parade big old church about 15 minutes later after he's telling about his latest this and that and they come back now i told you all to put a hundred dollars a piece in the offering plate and we did the math and we counted you and it come up short we're passing the plate again what did you offer up this morning come on saints do i need to come and sit down on the pew with you i want to ask you this morning in all seriousness what did you offer up this morning amen did you come to church today because it's formality or did you come today to offer spiritual sacrifice and offerings to the king what are we doing paul's here paul's hearing what is being spoke this is not my notes but then again maybe it would be easier for me saints to just tell you we're all going in the rapture praise god we're all we're all every one of us no matter what we've offered up no matter what we've given we're all no i'm sorry that's not the word of god and i'm sorry i i cannot preach that i refuse to eat watered down food and i refuse to feed it to you now this next this next one here once again the title says it all right shortcuts tonight they're out here today they're going on oh my tomorrow they want to preach i met that guy penn apostle people letting him do that too yeah they want a shortcut to heaven hallelujah all i had to do is get down here just don't think of nothing at all and say hallelujah hallelujah i've gone on elijah's garment i'm going out tomorrow to cast out devils hallelujah hallelujah i got it you think we're exempt from that no i can take and introduce you sounds judgmental don't it i can introduce you to these guys right here i know them personally personally praise god here i go they want this shortcut to heaven taking as much of the world as they can take you can't take any of it who's going to heaven come on i hope every one of us got a hand up i'm going to heaven and the word of god tells me that that i i cannot take any of this world with me so you know what just get the windows down on your little train car your bus or whatever it might be and start chunking that stuff out don't wait for tomorrow don't wait for next month don't wait for the evangelist to come you've heard the word start chunking it out hallelujah there's no shortcut you come the way of calvary you come the way of the brass altar you come the way of the brazen serpent you die you actually die oh god why can't i say it right you die literally die to yourself you die to the things of the world and are born anew amen no world the things of the world is dead there's no shortcut see they want to come right quick they don't want to grow what what you mean they want to come to church they want to sing songs of praise and lift their hands and say hallelujah and listen to the preacher go on and on for an hour and a half they want to do all of that but they don't want to grow something's wrong here you know you know what's wrong can i tell you what's wrong they're root bound they're ripped down there's no more nutrients or room in their world to grow amen does that mean they're lost no it doesn't it means god's going to come in the right time and place and jerk them out of their little container and he's going to crush their little roots and they're going to be all shook up what's going wrong lord what's going wrong why why i thought everything was good i'm a believer i'm a christian i'm a and god says i'm doing this for you you know i always say this was humor because it is kind of funny when you think about it because i remember my parents saying it and i said it to my children i have no doubt my children have said it to their children except for maybe not because i don't know that they whip their kids i mean spank their children i can remember as a kid my dad look at me in the face son you don't understand this hurts me worse than it hurts you and i'm like there ain't no way there is no way this is going to hurt you worse that's going to hurt me and after you got whipped and your feet come off the floor a few times you walked away from there going my dad's a liar there's no way he felt that and then i found myself a lot of years later looking my kids in the face especially my son joel son you just understand this is going to hurt me worse and it hurts you my son joel was a little different than me because i never had the courage to say it to my daddy my son joel looked me in the face and said you're not telling the truth dad there ain't no way that's going to hurt you but the truth of it is down in the spirit it does that's the truth of it we're not telling us and it actually hurts our lord jesus to come down and jerk you out of your little world and crush your roots and loosen them up and transplant you but it's necessary it has to happen because you see if it don't as we already read there we'll get caught in the cares of this world and we become root bound and we wither we pray we read our bible we go to church and god sent a prophet and we think we've got the answer to everything and our potential every day is declining declining declining declining now pardon me for even saying this but i want to drive this home to you then you can be in your late 70s followed the message for 55 years and deny it how how i'll tell you how saints because someone let you or them i mean set in a pot and become root bound because i don't want to offend you i don't want to offend you i don't want to offend you i don't want to offend the body of believers well i'll tell you what i believe it's charles spurgeon says if you haven't offended someone when you preach you did not really i don't use that as an excuse but i'm telling you we've got to be taken out of our pot and our little roots of this cares of this life need to be crushed and transplanted into a place we can grow amen oh god help us oh my saints i shouldn't even ask can i have a few more minutes hallelujah look at this i tell you i i love this now i want to give you some example i'll try and hurry through this in luke 7 37 amen i knew just this morning i thought i'm not even going to say i'm going to try and be short i'm just acknowledging that there's just so much here but it's all tied together hallelujah that's kind of like going to the house and they tell you here's the salad to start off with come back tomorrow and we'll serve you something else no sir when you go there and sit down saints don't bring me to your house and tell me that you'll invite me back in a month or two for the steak but right now here's the salad and the greens come on don't do it to me don't do it i'll stay at your house all day if that's what it takes for you to get that stake on the plate luke 7 37 behold a woman in the city which was just like me a sinner when she knew that jesus said it meet in the pharisees house and brought an alabaster box of ointment stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with her with tears did wipe them with the hairs of her head kissed his feet and anointed them with ointment now when the pharisee which had bitten him saw it spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet if he was a prophet if he was spiritual would have known who in what manner of woman that is that touches him for she is a sinner do you know where they got the idea of superman having x-ray vision i'm speaking serious the inspiration of that comes out of this word of god because he sees and discerns the spirit of the people the pharisee says if he knew what manner of woman that was he did he did look saints he didn't look at her and say whoa you're a prostitute what are you doing here oh sorry i spilled that now in the pharisees this man if you were a prophet would have known what manner of woman touches him jesus answering said in him simon i have someone to say to you i'm gonna i'm gonna upgrade you simon i'm gonna call you to the carpet i'm i'm gonna let you know simon how messed up you are master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 pence and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most simon being a fairly smart guy wasn't too hard i mean he's good at counting money in his head not very good at discerning spirits or being spiritual but he didn't have any problem figuring out this money part probably was a good preacher simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most he said unto him thou hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman now get this turned to the woman and said to simon you see actually simon's falling out of the conversation now see us thou this woman i had entered into thine house now gave us me no water from my feet but she has washed my feet with tears and wipe them with the hairs of her head thou gave us me no kiss but this woman since time i come in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil did us not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore ascended thee her sins which were many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little you didn't see simon approaching jesus and saying forgive me forgive me you see he had very little love very little but you see my brother and sister here was a woman i'll just speak it plain to you a prostitute now that's my i hope our children god blocked their ears this is a woman that night after night did not just sit in her house and cry for the bitterness of her life but this was a woman who night after night was debased in the eyes of man this was a woman that every day that went by sunk lower and lower and lower in the image of the world around her this was not i can go on i can be respectable she was trapped in her pot she was root bound i am marked i have nowhere to go i have no way i will always be the woman from down there on the corner but something happened she didn't put announcement out she didn't tell everybody come see what i'm going to do she was anointed and she went and history will tell you that she actually was not even welcomed in that house it would have only been god himself that provided a way for her to get in there god's provided way my brother and sister not man not the church not this preacher not that preacher god's provided way brought her to a place and as it was that it's there and is this and we see the word of god coming forth see how it's broke down right there and he says unto her thy sins are forgiven what has he done he's pulled her out of her root bound condition and he's taken her over here and said i'm going to plant you in good soil i'm going to put you in a place under the water of the word under the sunlight of the sun and you will grow and they just said at me with him begin to say within themselves who is that to forgive his sins also and that didn't matter he's now dismissed simon he's dismissed the unbeliever he's dismissed all the make-believers he's dismissed everything and he says to her thy faith is save thee go in peace my brother and sister she did not go out of there and book another customer she was changed it was overnight you might say or instant is that clear enough hallelujah can i move on just a little bit look we look in john 4 4. we see the scripture he says and he must needs go through samaria that's just a little foundation you see god never just absolutely absently did something god just wasn't oh i run into this person how lucky no no sorry no sorry i i i'm torn whether to even share this from my own heart and i think it'll be beneficial not to but i can tell you one of the thoughts that the devil put in my mind this morning was an event that damaged my family shocked my wife and my children many years ago happened about this time of the year the devil come this morning tried to remind me and i just realized by god's grace the devil had had his way i wouldn't be here and i wouldn't have for many years i would have been gone it would have been history maybe a name on a little stone somewhere but god rich in mercy god rich and mercy said i'm here to minister to your needs i'm here to deal with whatever's happening in your life it don't matter big or small i'm able to take care of it i'm here to raise you up into heavenly places i'm here to use you if you'll let me use you amen now we know this story right this a woman at the well now we understand my brother and sister that jesus says i have needs to go through samaria i've got an appointment to keep i'm gonna i'm gonna go down this way and here's this little lady living in samaria now my brother and sister she might not have been identified as a prostitute but she had had five husbands which in that day and age was the same as jesus tells the disciples guys um i won't need your misunderstandings i won't need your maybe judgmental approach i won't need you guys questioning so i'm just going to send you all the town because this is something that's just between her and me well thank you lord i like that i like that when it comes down that it's just between you and god amen you know i i don't i'm not real comfortable myself and needing to interject myself into your life and your life and your life to make sure that somehow it's going to come out right it's just really nice to just let it be between you and god i was talking to a brother just a few days ago and he asked me a little question and i say this as a compliment saints i hope you don't ever think i was shirking my job i probably have a few times but forgive me for that brother made a comment to me and i gave him a comment back i said brother i believe in rugged christians i believe if you have a question you pray about it you don't need to come and say no pastor should i shouldn't i have you prayed about it go pray about it get in the spirit pray through god said he would answer you as long as the pastor is in the room no i misquoted that one didn't i oh that was out of nicolaitan chapter four i believe in rugged christians i believe god has done that we come to a time like as in china right now that they're persecuting all the all the believers all the christian churches they're persecuting that it hasn't stopped the church the church is exploding the chinese government's more afraid of the christian church in china than they are of the united states because the harder they press on it the more there are well hallelujah you never now pardon me we don't drink wine around here except for communion and i'm telling you if you don't ever squeeze the grape you don't ever get the juice the more they're squeezing the christian church the more it's happening amen well hallelujah i'll tell you my brother and sister there's been more people backsliding the united states from being a christian because life was too easy than there was from being too hard so look at this woman he says now look uh you know he says to the to the saints there he says now you guys just all go and um so it's there and we see what happened right we see the whole context of she comes he starts talking to her she says hey look now no wait wait i'm this i'm that you're that he tells her no no you don't even know where you worship you know you guys don't even have revelation but when it comes to a certain point he says something and she's like that's what i've looked for a woman with five husbands is acknowledging that's what i've looked for my whole life this is what i'm looking for and i perceive that you must be a prophet amen now let's go into my thought what did she do a woman that had to go to the well at a certain time of day because she could not associate with those around her now under an anointing she didn't step out of her place she didn't say no i believe i'm called to be a preacher no she went down she started preaching in the correct fashion i had this experience this man told me all about my life she starts testifying everything he knows he spoke it he's the messiah this is what we're looking for and this is the result many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that i ever did so when the samaritans were coming unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode their two days and many more believe because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because you said so not just because you said so but we have heard him ourselves but you see they never would have come from the city to hear him except for she caught a revelation and went and told them this man has told me everything i ever done and this little woman that they would have looked at with the most demeaning approach we had such as a ring of sincerity such a truth coming from her such a revelation coming out they said we gotta go see what affected her like this she's lived her life she's hard she's callous she's been through everything she has been pardoned me for saying this she has been loved and left she has been abused and mistreated she's been dumped she's been despised and she's coming here saying there's one who's told me all about my life and who i am and what i was called for and they said we gotta go see what this is and because of her words they went but they're coming back and acknowledging just like you and i should be acknowledging we don't believe just because someone told us we believe because we have heard we have heard the word of god for our hour we've heard his voice he spoke to us in the quiet of the midnight hour his word is speaking to us as brother chris preached my brother and sister we're not just going to take someone else's word for it we want to touch and put our hand in his hand we're not going to just settle for some kind of hey this is what this is so-and-so said i gotta meet him myself i gotta hear from him myself i've gotta know this word myself because of christ my brother and sister the anointed one has come in spirit and in truth hallelujah i love this i got so inspired i'm sorry except for my office it's so little it's hard to run around in a circle when there's only room enough for a chair but i got so expire many more be believed because of it says his own word but the word many believe because the word spoke to them not just a word the word spoke to them and the woman i believe this must would have been spoken the right context because you could put just a little bit now i didn't believe i didn't believe because her no no no not you don't you you testified you witnessed to me but don't you get any ideas you had anything to do with this well that's right and wrong because god uses who he will to speak said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying but thank you lord we heard him ourselves oh hallelujah and we know that this is indeed the christ the savior of the world sister emmy would you come look at this my brother and sister we have heard him amen ourselves how beautiful that is now look we were speaking of the first lady how god replanted her look how quickly god changed this lady's position she got up in the morning little did she know she was gonna walk into the very presence of god himself she's got a water pot she's gonna go get a little water it's the time all the respectable people have already got their water i can go now little did she know she had an appointment amen and god said i i've said even the traditions i want you to follow this and i'm stopping god even set the traditions of a nation so that he could make the appointment with her let me close with this and god has set the appointment amen of the hour we live in so he could come and meet us at our well don't miss the appointment don't walk away because the cares of this life but just say lord meet me meet me lord if i miss the appointment father forgive me lord but i want you to come i want you to meet me because you see my brother and sister this is the season of our growth and god will grow you right into the stature of a perfect man he'll grow you right into that position hallelujah oh my lord we love you today hallelujah hallelujah in the morning when i rise hallelujah you know we just can't even sing that song sitting down i don't believe saints let's just stand up and let's just worship the lord for just a few minutes hallelujah i hope i haven't messed up your

sometimes god uses these things to move us as ministers you you find yourself you might say in front of the firing squad and then you have to decide what i've been preaching is it true or not and the minute you declare us the truth god takes a firing spawn unloads their weapon now look this morning the devil come and he tried to speak certain things to me but then the wall came up satan's darts and errors and accusations all started just thudding into the word of god i stood behind it said thank you lord for a standard thank you lord for a word thank you lord for all that you promised us it's true i'm not exempt but the word has already defeated the enemy [Music] and we sung the song let the worshipers arise the other night and right after the devil come i'm not trying to elevate myself don't don't please don't take that but the devil just called me sitting there in the office i got up i felt really groggy almost felt like i was drugged or something this morning when i got up i even washed my face and i was trying to get my thoughts collected and and it was there and then the devil just come and he started just pounding on me and i i just was there and then i the word of god come the presence of god just come right behind that and and i just started rejoicing i sat there in the office and i just cried i was like thank you lord thank you lord you're faithful you're
