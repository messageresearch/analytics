[39:05] us amen
[39:07] everything that's happening you know
[39:09] sometimes we go through things in life
[39:11] and we wonder am i what was that about
[39:14] you know kind of a little tornado so to
[39:17] speak hits your life but you know down
[39:20] the road somewhere you realize this is
[39:22] what it was about
[39:22] God preparing us for those things that
[39:25] we're coming to the things that we face
[39:28] amen and you know I think it I think
[39:31] it's wonderful what God is doing in our
[39:34] lives so good to see each and every one
[39:36] of you today amen you know God's grace
[39:40] and mercy is sufficient
[39:41] I was just sitting there on the Pew
[39:43] thinking about my brother Bob and sister
[39:45] Joanne and you know praise the Lord
[39:49] if the Lord tarries Saints now I'm not
[39:52] lifting up individuals right because we
[39:55] believe this is the same God in us but
[39:58] I'll tell you if the Lord tarries I be
[40:01] Amen sorry brother Bob's sister Joanne I
[40:04] want to be old and still be in the house
[40:07] of God raising my hands singing songs
[40:11] and worshiping amen amen I don't want to
[40:14] just drift off on the Prairie as it were
[40:17] and disappear out of sight I want to be
[40:20] right to the last breath that's in my
[40:22] body in the house of God amen
[40:25] you know as we kind of slot 'red it a
[40:28] little bit of what our brother Danny
[40:29] fare but my brother and sister if we
[40:32] don't declare church as essential amen
[40:36] then the world will determine what is
[40:37] essential and I'm telling you it's
[40:40] essential and I need it I want it I
[40:43] desire it and I say God bring it upon us
[40:47] everything that's necessary
[40:49] Alleluia well I sent a little word to
[40:52] brother Sergei this morning and and just
[40:56] you know just a little remembrance for
[40:59] my friend and brother and and they were
[41:02] in the car traveling and I don't know I
[41:05] guess it's something of youth that I
[41:07] have forgotten but he said well I made a
[41:09] call man brother Alex driving must be a
[41:11] little scary because everybody just
[41:12] looks so solemn and he said no we didn't
[41:15] go to bed till 2:00 a.m. and I'm like my
[41:19] oh my I am certainly have passed over a
[41:22] transition I am no longer a young person
[41:25] because 2 a.m. is what you do in an
[41:28] emergency
[41:30] alleluiah not for fun but in an
[41:33] emergency hallelujah but we just want to
[41:36] remember them they were driving down
[41:38] into Kentucky to go worship with a
[41:40] little group of believers there today
[41:42] and there ahead of us so no doubt
[41:44] they're already in service but just to
[41:47] lift them up before the Lord that God
[41:49] would just bless the Saints wherever
[41:51] they are at are you blessed today Saints
[41:54] amen let's just stand and go to the word
[41:57] now I'm going to speak some things today
[41:59] that I certainly hope that you're
[42:03] patient and understanding with me might
[42:05] be a little direct but I believe if
[42:10] you'll approach it
[42:11] God will anoint you to approach it and
[42:13] the way that we were looking at it it
[42:15] won't be it won't be wrong but my
[42:18] brother and sister I'll just have to
[42:19] share this with you so as our brother
[42:21] Chris was preaching uh I guess that
[42:24] would be to Wednesdays ago as he was
[42:26] preaching he just got started with his
[42:28] service and I just got under such an
[42:30] inspiration I I'm not saying this is how
[42:35] we should do things but I just pulled a
[42:37] clean piece of paper out of my little
[42:40] folder there and I just started writing
[42:42] and I guess I don't want to some
[42:46] boastful but I guess I caught a little
[42:47] of the vein that brother Chris was
[42:49] preaching in but you know I took a
[42:51] little parallel route to it and I just
[42:53] wrote down this and then as we kind of
[42:55] been studying this for a week and a half
[42:57] I just want to bring out the virgin
[43:01] birth of the word Amen hallelujah not
[43:05] something convoluted not something
[43:07] hybrid now I cut a lot of quotes out I
[43:10] was joking with brother J do we have an
[43:12] hour service hour and a half to two and
[43:15] a half three five brother J I'll just
[43:18] say this brother J gave me permission to
[43:20] preach until my voice quit and I'm
[43:24] feeling pretty good today the virgin
[43:27] birth of the word let's turn in Matthew
[43:29] the first chapter verse 18 now we don't
[43:35] want to look my brother and sister at
[43:37] the Bible as a historic writing this is
[43:41] living here today amen Jesus Christ the
[43:47] same yesterday today and forever and you
[43:51] know sometimes I struggle with the idea
[43:53] that people around the message struggle
[43:56] with the idea when even in the
[43:58] denominations in Pentecost apostolic
[44:01] they have no problem embracing the fact
[44:04] of the word being alive and the word
[44:07] being God and the word being in US and
[44:11] yet some people around the message
[44:14] struggle with that because there's been
[44:16] some lack of teaching or revelation
[44:18] somewhere along the line now the birth
[44:21] of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as
[44:24] his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[44:27] before they come together before there
[44:32] was ever any carnal or natural or
[44:37] intellectual she was found with child of
[44:43] the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband
[44:45] being a just man not willing to make her
[44:48] a public example was minded to move to
[44:50] another city under another circumstance
[44:53] to hide the shame it's what it says
[45:00] isn't it but it's what it meant see
[45:06] people also around the message struggle
[45:08] brother Branham in several places says
[45:11] now you heard what I said I hope you see
[45:17] what I meant
[45:19] so we need to come not with our own
[45:22] thinking not with our own I'm going to
[45:24] interpret this but to realize the
[45:27] prophet of God says not everything that
[45:29] is a visible to us is manifested so God
[45:34] has to come down and he has to open our
[45:37] eyes as we read the word of God as we
[45:41] listen to a prophets voice we can't just
[45:44] say okay I'm gonna I've God no we need
[45:46] to say Lord now what he's saying I need
[45:48] to catch the meaning of this I need to
[45:52] understand what it is what is veiled in
[45:54] what is written
[45:55] Amen not everybody agrees with that and
[45:58] I'm not here to pick a fight with that
[46:00] but I for one believe when the prophet
[46:02] of God said pray for revelation that
[46:05] ought to be a first and foremost thing
[46:07] that you do that we take the Prophet at
[46:09] his word and pray for revelation amen
[46:13] now this and we're going to hit on a few
[46:15] things today this is not revelation of
[46:17] some man in a pulpit Saints I want to
[46:20] admonish you right now don't you ever
[46:22] take Paul's interpretation of this
[46:25] message or any man right we're relying
[46:32] on the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[46:36] then Joseph her husband being a just man
[46:38] not willing to make her a public example
[46:40] in other words publicly shame her away
[46:45] privately or privily but while he
[46:48] thought on these things the angel of the
[46:52] Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying
[46:55] Joseph thou son of David fear not see is
[47:00] talking here he's in the lineage that's
[47:03] all the more that's here is declaring to
[47:05] him you're in the lineage of David
[47:08] you're not a castaway you're not as it
[47:11] were a dog from the gutters you are of
[47:13] the very lineage of God fear not to take
[47:19] unto thee Mary thy wife for that which
[47:22] is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
[47:25] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[47:28] shalt call his name Jesus for he shall
[47:31] save his people from their say
[47:33] now all of this was done that it might
[47:36] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[47:38] Lord by the Prophet saying behold a
[47:41] virgin shall be with child and shall
[47:44] bring forth a son and they shall call
[47:45] his name Emmanuel which being
[47:48] interpreted God with us hallelujah
[47:53] then Joseph being raised from sleep did
[47:56] as the angel of the Lord had bidden him
[47:58] and took unto him his wife now my
[48:00] brother and sister you'll catch this in
[48:02] verse 25 but when he took unto his wife
[48:04] he then made a commitment that was not
[48:08] based in the physical because verse 25
[48:12] shows us that he knew her not till she
[48:15] brought her firstborn son and called his
[48:17] name Jesus but what it was is he
[48:20] received oh you might stumble it when
[48:23] I'm fixing to tell you he received the
[48:26] revelation of the angel that came to him
[48:29] and he realized this is my wife was to
[48:34] be my wife but now I'm receiving a
[48:38] revelation that was brought to me he had
[48:41] to my brother and sister he had to stop
[48:43] and decide if the words of this Amos
[48:46] dream coming to him if this was true or
[48:49] not but there was something there by
[48:52] which he could say I believe this and
[48:55] then he went in and fully embraced Mary
[49:02] no reservation no sorry to put it in
[49:05] these words no hanky-panky no mystery as
[49:08] to what's going on here I'm gonna waitin
[49:11] to see no he received her he took her
[49:16] then unto himself as his wife that was a
[49:20] committal hallelujah
[49:23] father we thank you today lord your
[49:26] grace your mercy your hand upon our
[49:29] lives father truly Lord revealed to us
[49:32] today Lord the hidden meaning of your
[49:36] word father that that was hid from the
[49:39] wise and the prudent Lord that was
[49:42] hidden from Father the intellectual
[49:45] hidden
[49:46] father from those that Lord only saw it
[49:50] as a source of influence father let your
[49:55] word be living in us today let this
[49:57] Bible come living Lord let each one of
[50:00] us from the oldest to the youngest today
[50:02] be able to just open our hearts today
[50:05] and just receive your word and father
[50:08] come and vindicate your word father let
[50:11] it not be our words not be just trust us
[50:15] Lord we trust you Lord that's what we
[50:19] trust we trust your word Lord asking for
[50:22] your hand today upon every need upon
[50:24] everyone in the body and the bride of
[50:26] Jesus Christ amen you may be seated
[50:28] Saints as I said we're going to look at
[50:33] a few things today and I will make some
[50:35] statements no doubt unless the Lord
[50:37] checks me different that will come
[50:40] across and I pray that you're able just
[50:42] to to understand where I am at amen
[50:45] let's look at Mary for just a minute my
[50:48] brother and sister here is a young girl
[50:50] she's been raised correctly she's
[50:51] obviously pure and holy because God
[50:55] would not choose a just any old girl you
[50:57] might say off the alleys for this and
[51:00] and she was there I believe having as I
[51:03] study the word I believe she had a
[51:05] experience with God and in that there
[51:09] must have been some faith that allowed
[51:10] her to reach out in take a Holtz of what
[51:13] would be beyond the extraordinary beyond
[51:17] the you know mind could grasp how that
[51:20] an angel would come to her and be
[51:23] speaking and declaring to her so we
[51:26] would understand I believe by looking at
[51:28] the word that Mary did not have an
[51:30] intellectual understanding she was not
[51:33] there trying to measure I don't think
[51:35] her mind raced back to the prophets of
[51:37] old and said well this has got to be a
[51:39] scriptural fulfilled I guess I would be
[51:42] the girl but my brother and sister the
[51:44] prophet of God talks about how that the
[51:46] word having declared that a virgin would
[51:49] conceive that no doubt many people
[51:52] fathers and mothers might think my
[51:54] daughter might be one she's a godly girl
[51:57] my daughter might be one that God would
[51:59] choose
[52:00] - to do this but you see we need to be
[52:04] looking we need to have expectations but
[52:06] my brother and sister we also need to
[52:09] just simply stop and say Lord thy will
[52:12] be done whatever it is you want me to
[52:13] fulfill whatever my part of the plan of
[52:16] God is we can't run around am i a
[52:18] preacher am i evangelist am i this am i
[52:21] that we have to just kind of you might
[52:22] say just live life and say lord thy will
[52:25] be done to guide me into what you desire
[52:28] for me and so as Mary's living out her
[52:32] life this day comes and she comes in the
[52:35] presence of an angel and my brother and
[52:37] sister when this angel speaks to her Mar
[52:40] it was not as though she said okay now
[52:44] can you give me some documentation and
[52:46] my brother and sister you know it's an
[52:48] interesting thing that sometimes you
[52:51] know around the message if I'm if we
[52:55] don't quantify it brother Branham said
[52:57] people can reject what is said because
[53:01] they need brother Branham said on there
[53:03] but what we really need is to be so
[53:05] close to God that when we hear the
[53:08] preaching of the word it's connected or
[53:10] stirred right to our heart not to our
[53:13] brain hey man so that we don't have to
[53:16] critique this does this fit do I
[53:18] remember a quote is there a sermon what
[53:20] do we have here my brother and sister
[53:22] the day may come that we will no longer
[53:25] have a message book or a computer we
[53:27] might not have a Bible the only place
[53:30] the word will be recorded then is down
[53:33] in your soul hey man and God promised he
[53:36] said that he would bring it to our
[53:38] remembrance he would bring it to our
[53:40] lips in the time of need amen so we got
[53:44] to get beyond I can find it on my phone
[53:49] hallelujah amen many times things come
[53:53] and her preached and in people back up
[53:55] from it I won't go into the details but
[53:57] I can just tell you there's a brother
[53:59] one time he was preaching in and you
[54:02] know he said in a service he said you
[54:05] know dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah he
[54:07] didn't say brother brems head and people
[54:08] box against aft they sent him texts and
[54:11] emails we don't believe
[54:12] that and the very next service the
[54:15] brother gets up and says for those of
[54:17] you and then he reads it brother branham
[54:19] says right here in this sermon now my
[54:23] brother and sister I think it shows a
[54:25] critical flaw that when you could
[54:28] instinctively say I don't believe that
[54:31] and then the minute brother branham said
[54:34] oh yes isn't that beautiful there's a
[54:37] flaw and I'll tell you my brother and
[54:40] sister submarines I studied them kind of
[54:43] a little historical thing I like to read
[54:45] about and I was reading about submarines
[54:47] and you know some of the original
[54:49] submarines my brother and sister the
[54:51] poor men who felt honored at the moment
[54:54] to test them their bones still lie in
[54:57] them at the bottom of the ocean because
[54:59] there was a critical flaw in some cases
[55:02] you know they made the hole to be able
[55:05] to withstand so many a amounts of
[55:09] pressure per square inch thousands of
[55:11] pounds per square inch of pressure but
[55:13] they had a valve and in one case one of
[55:15] those submarines it was the door where
[55:17] they shot the trash out while they were
[55:20] in the ocean it grounded up and shot it
[55:21] out that door couldn't handle the
[55:24] pressure and so there might be some
[55:26] little thing in your life in my life
[55:28] that we would say here well praise the
[55:30] Lord understand the message of the Lord
[55:32] this is all good but if we have a little
[55:35] door to the heart a little door to the
[55:37] mind a little door to whatever emotion
[55:40] and it won't stand the pressure it's
[55:42] gonna blow up on you and so God is what
[55:46] is he doing
[55:47] hallelujah is pressurizing us that's why
[55:51] we have these little struggles we have
[55:52] little trials we have little things that
[55:54] happen in our life
[55:55] what's he doing he's pressurizing us but
[55:57] by the grace of God my brother and
[55:59] sister we're getting to try this all out
[56:02] while there's still a lifeguard on duty
[56:04] hallelujah so you look at this and
[56:07] realize that Mary had no documentation
[56:10] she did not have a Bible she did not
[56:12] have a message she did not have some
[56:14] kind of scroll to go back and go now has
[56:17] God ever done this before this the way
[56:19] God works is could this possibly be
[56:22] you know something else it's not the
[56:23] angel of the Lord but what it was is
[56:25] doing I'm
[56:26] what is fixing to happen here my brother
[56:29] and sister she had none of that but I'll
[56:31] tell you what she had she had some
[56:33] preparation for the pressure that came
[56:35] into her life because that pressure my
[56:37] brother and sister included that while
[56:39] she was there living her life in amongst
[56:43] her own friends they started to say whom
[56:45] what's Mary been up to there's a little
[56:48] problem in this relationship and it's
[56:50] even a bigger problem because Joseph is
[56:52] gonna go ahead and marry her which means
[56:54] he's breaking the bridal covenant well
[57:05] you know what it was if a bride went
[57:08] into the bridal tent under the bridal
[57:10] covenant and was found not to be a
[57:11] virgin its death it wasn't well just the
[57:20] way the times are it's just how life is
[57:23] no my brother and sister was death now
[57:27] you see God had to come down because
[57:29] Joseph himself had to come and accept
[57:33] publicly Mary to take away but yet the
[57:37] shame did not disappear are you with me
[57:40] but Joseph anointed here once again no
[57:44] documentation no quote no Scripture
[57:47] nothing to fall back on but the fact
[57:49] that he knew that was the angel of the
[57:51] Lord that spoke to someone else no it
[57:54] spoke to him
[57:55] and that's where we must get today my
[57:58] brother and sister in the age the day
[58:01] that we live in it's not now don't
[58:03] misunderstand me I get people say
[58:05] brother Paul we don't like how you speak
[58:07] down on the Prophet I'm not speaking
[58:09] down on the Prophet my brother and
[58:10] sister I believe the greatest compliment
[58:13] we can give to our brother William
[58:14] Branham is living this message not that
[58:18] we walk around all politically correct
[58:21] all the time of us say only in Studdard
[58:24] of when he did my brother's sister
[58:27] that's not the compliment that's not the
[58:30] lifting up my brother's sister the
[58:32] lifting up is day by day my day looking
[58:35] at this and saying I believe what he
[58:38] preached and I took it back
[58:40] the word and the word agrees and we
[58:42] stand with confidence because our
[58:45] prophet brought a restored word to us
[58:47] all this faults my brother and sister
[58:50] I'm sorry but that's just how I see it
[58:52] all this faults politically correct
[58:55] world we live in has got inside our
[58:59] message boat it's time to forget them
[59:03] politically correct this that and we're
[59:05] afraid to say it's time for us to say
[59:08] this is the word God sent it Malachi 4:5
[59:12] revelation said behold I send you didn't
[59:21] say behold I'll send a prophet some
[59:23] people he said people I've sent you a
[59:27] prophet that will restore you black
[59:32] hallelujah I don't know how I got on
[59:36] that subject praise the Lord
[59:39] but you see Mary had no documentation to
[59:42] go to no reference no concordance no
[59:45] quote books but something in her heart
[59:48] oh I just love that it's in Luke 1 in 38
[59:51] let's just pop that up on the screen
[59:52] here Luke 1 in 38 this is Mary's
[59:55] response to the supernatural unexpected
[1:00:00] event in her life she didn't say I got
[1:00:03] to think about this
[1:00:04] I gotta go Sri search this I gotta go
[1:00:06] after the priest what he thinks about
[1:00:08] this that's something in her heart she
[1:00:10] said Behold the handmaid of the Lord see
[1:00:13] she was identified already she said I am
[1:00:17] a handmaid of the Lord I know who I am a
[1:00:22] man and because she knew who she was she
[1:00:25] was able then to receive the word of the
[1:00:28] Lord be it unto me according to thy word
[1:00:33] can we say that this morning being unto
[1:00:37] me according to thy word my brother and
[1:00:40] sister that'll go a long ways towards
[1:00:42] wrinkling out of ironing out the
[1:00:44] wrinkles in our lives because when we'll
[1:00:47] get in a place that we absolutely know
[1:00:49] who we are and where we stand in this
[1:00:51] word of God my
[1:00:53] sister you won't have to stop and say is
[1:00:55] this going to lead me away now I'm sorry
[1:00:57] I'm gonna beat this drum a little bit
[1:00:59] more but people think I'm overly
[1:01:01] confident in fact they called it a
[1:01:03] liberal of view on we cannot be deceived
[1:01:07] I'm sorry my brother and sister I don't
[1:01:09] know how we can take a liberal view on
[1:01:12] being deep when the word said it would
[1:01:15] deceive the very elect if it were
[1:01:18] possible now is a question mark whether
[1:01:22] God can sustain his word or is a
[1:01:25] question mark whether were the elect she
[1:01:32] answered the question behold the
[1:01:33] handmaid of the Lord she knew this the
[1:01:35] position I am this is who I am she
[1:01:38] didn't say if I am a handmaid of the
[1:01:39] Lord I am a handmaid of the Lord and we
[1:01:44] need to have enough confidence today my
[1:01:46] brother and sister and if we don't have
[1:01:48] that confidence we're not digging in the
[1:01:51] word deep enough you're just floating
[1:01:53] along on that little stream of life and
[1:01:56] you're saying well praise the Lord God
[1:01:59] sent a prophet get through that get
[1:02:02] through that and know who you are in the
[1:02:05] word
[1:02:06] there's no prophet I'm sorry to tell you
[1:02:09] there's no prophet can come on the scene
[1:02:11] and convince you of who you are in the
[1:02:14] word the words are there he okay he gave
[1:02:17] us a research he gave us a documentation
[1:02:20] gave us everything we need many of you
[1:02:23] don't get in it and you don't eat it
[1:02:25] you don't consume it you don't believe
[1:02:28] it you don't submit to it then you'll
[1:02:31] come to the day that you'll put an F in
[1:02:33] front this equation if I am the elect
[1:02:38] come on let's get in the word saints
[1:02:40] let's eat the carcass start chewing on
[1:02:44] it know who you are then you see you
[1:02:50] don't have to have fear of whether
[1:02:53] you'll be deceived or not because God
[1:02:56] made that promise to who the bride you
[1:03:01] you so he made that promise to you
[1:03:05] can't deceive the very elect Amen whole
[1:03:10] hallelujah well I might be a liberal
[1:03:12] anyway you all call me a liberal call me
[1:03:14] liberal but I believe it God said it I'm
[1:03:17] gonna hang my whole life over the chasm
[1:03:20] amen brother Chris preached about the
[1:03:23] bridge that was my brother and sister
[1:03:25] I'll hang my life off of that bridge
[1:03:27] I'll stand in the middle of that bridge
[1:03:30] over that chasm and I will say thank you
[1:03:33] Lord for the bridge that you have built
[1:03:36] and the fact that you guided me to be
[1:03:39] able to cross that bridge you gave me
[1:03:42] the strength to climb up you gave me the
[1:03:45] strength and the courage to press on and
[1:03:47] see the vision of what was beyond oh but
[1:03:50] if you stand there and say I don't know
[1:03:52] I don't know if that bridge is going to
[1:03:55] handle all these cares and terrors of
[1:03:58] life well my brother's sister you can
[1:04:00] stand there go ahead hire an engineer
[1:04:02] that engineer will probably tell you the
[1:04:05] days of miracles are past that engineer
[1:04:08] will probably tell you that God's just
[1:04:10] here and he's full of grace and you just
[1:04:12] live like you want to live
[1:04:14] III just this is weird how things are
[1:04:17] but as I was studying I looked up a
[1:04:20] little something on my computer and the
[1:04:22] sidebar do any of you know how to
[1:04:24] permanently eliminate them anyway it
[1:04:29] caught my attention I think the Lord had
[1:04:31] it for a reason Christian singles well
[1:04:39] it's not for me I will go through the
[1:04:45] name there's a picture quite pretty
[1:04:47] woman probably about 40 years old
[1:04:49] Christian likes to cook clean hike drink
[1:04:55] wine
[1:05:02] prophet warned us about that didn't he I
[1:05:07] won't go into all the rest of details
[1:05:10] but you see my brother and sister that's
[1:05:13] not what we were called to we were
[1:05:16] called to stand up and say be it a court
[1:05:18] be it unto me according to who is she
[1:05:22] speaking to not even the angel oh I want
[1:05:27] you to grip that get ahold of that she
[1:05:31] wasn't saying amen to the angel she was
[1:05:36] talking bright back the angel brought
[1:05:38] the message oh oh I hope you get this
[1:05:40] this morning the angel brought the
[1:05:43] message but he spoke back to God
[1:05:48] hallelujah I wish some people would get
[1:05:51] that revelation amen we didn't have to
[1:05:53] speak back as it were to the angel we
[1:05:55] had to speak back to God amen hallelujah
[1:05:59] oh look at this now see so she was there
[1:06:04] you know that that brings to mind to me
[1:06:07] it's always a just a little source of
[1:06:08] humor I hope you would see this our
[1:06:10] brother David Nash for years I've known
[1:06:12] him since I was a roughly 14 years old a
[1:06:15] long time Wow but uh um you know he
[1:06:19] always sang that song let your word be
[1:06:22] born in the manger of my heart and I
[1:06:24] went for about 30 years thinking that
[1:06:26] brother David had written that song I
[1:06:29] was like that song that brother David
[1:06:30] wrote it one time I made that comment to
[1:06:32] brother David I'd like you to sing that
[1:06:34] song that you wrote and he just looked
[1:06:36] at me I was like oh what songs that I
[1:06:39] know you know the one about the manger
[1:06:41] huh sorry brother Paul that's not my
[1:06:43] song really I've went 30 years thinking
[1:06:47] that brother David Rohtang but then I
[1:06:49] stopped and I thought it doesn't matter
[1:06:51] that song touched my heart for 30 years
[1:06:53] hey man I didn't matter who wrote it let
[1:06:56] your word be born in the manger my heart
[1:06:58] turned the song into a prayer my brother
[1:07:00] and sister hallelujah now for there to
[1:07:04] be a birth of the word where there would
[1:07:09] be a birth of anything one must first be
[1:07:13] pregnant
[1:07:15] you see God follows the law my brother
[1:07:18] and sister you say what God follows the
[1:07:20] law yes God set the law of nature the
[1:07:24] law of humanity etc and he give these
[1:07:27] principles and God will not break his
[1:07:30] own principles that's why we can carry
[1:07:33] these things that's why the prophet of
[1:07:34] God shows us we can carry these things
[1:07:36] and I'm a typology we can carry these
[1:07:39] things through the Bible with confidence
[1:07:42] because God will not break his principle
[1:07:49] now I'm sorry to beat on this my brother
[1:07:52] and sister but I just it is just
[1:07:54] something that just galls me uh you know
[1:07:57] there's things that that are right in
[1:08:00] there question answers 1964 someone said
[1:08:03] well brother randomly was this situation
[1:08:05] before we come in and can we still
[1:08:07] preach was divorced and remarried and
[1:08:09] can we still preach and brother Branham
[1:08:11] says no moment take you over here to
[1:08:12] Timothy read those scriptures that
[1:08:14] they're there let's go to Titus read
[1:08:16] those scriptures no you can't but yet
[1:08:18] that spirit is so subtly they'll come
[1:08:20] down to what brother Branham preached
[1:08:21] and marriage and divorce and when he
[1:08:23] says God's forgiven you as though it
[1:08:25] never happened they they go oh I can
[1:08:27] preach now my brother and sister you see
[1:08:30] how slippery this is amen we introduce
[1:08:33] something and we go back we have quotes
[1:08:36] for it we've got one single scripture
[1:08:38] for it amen we can't lining up in
[1:08:41] continuity to the Word of God but we say
[1:08:45] all this is revelation if it is a
[1:08:47] revelation then God changed his
[1:08:50] principle and my God does not change now
[1:08:57] look I'm not going to beat around the
[1:08:58] bush we had those around us just here
[1:09:00] recently that held on to that how did
[1:09:02] that supported that it went to other
[1:09:04] countries and supported that and I'm
[1:09:06] gonna stand up and declare that came
[1:09:08] right out of the pits of hell that is
[1:09:11] not the message you cannot take a
[1:09:14] convolution of words and change the
[1:09:17] scripture and expect God to honor it
[1:09:21] now I know that's kind of blunt and I'll
[1:09:24] probably get some feedback on that I've
[1:09:26] been getting a lot of feedback lately my
[1:09:29] brother and sister but I'll tell you
[1:09:30] about I got more feedback when the Lord
[1:09:32] said I told you to preach it you preach
[1:09:34] it and I'll stand on that why you say
[1:09:37] brother Paul why are you preaching that
[1:09:39] because my brother and sister the baby
[1:09:41] wolf that you took in and fed at your
[1:09:44] hearth and at your table grows up to be
[1:09:47] a full-grown wolf and that full-grown
[1:09:50] wolf looks at your wife and your
[1:09:53] children and your husband and your daddy
[1:09:55] has lunch what was so cute and so
[1:10:01] friendly and so fuzzy and only bit a
[1:10:04] little here and a little there and only
[1:10:06] had that gleam in its eye once in a
[1:10:09] while will destroy your family and I
[1:10:14] hate to say this but I was listening to
[1:10:16] a Pentecostal preacher a couple years
[1:10:18] ago and it struck me deep oh I know some
[1:10:21] of you might be disturbed about that but
[1:10:22] the guy's a really good preacher
[1:10:25] and he's not well anyway no I'm not
[1:10:31] telling you who it is but he made a
[1:10:35] statement that struck me I've spoken
[1:10:36] over the pulpit here he said if God is
[1:10:38] not moving in your church pastor you are
[1:10:44] obligated to God to find out why not
[1:10:48] oh come on Saints I don't care it came
[1:10:52] from some Pentecostal preacher that's
[1:10:54] their truth it doesn't land with sister
[1:10:57] Nadia or someone else or in this brother
[1:10:59] that when it lands with myself brother
[1:11:02] David brother Chris if we don't find out
[1:11:05] why God it's not moving in our midst we
[1:11:09] will stand the judgment I don't want to
[1:11:12] stand that judgment I'd rather dig and
[1:11:15] root and make people upset with me and
[1:11:17] you know I scrub says you offend one of
[1:11:20] those little ones my brother and sister
[1:11:21] now I don't want to do that but the
[1:11:23] prophet of God also said the word cannot
[1:11:26] offend the word
[1:11:29] amen so look it's time for us to look in
[1:11:32] our own life look in our church and say
[1:11:35] if God's not moving here the Saints we
[1:11:38] gonna start rooting and we're gonna
[1:11:40] start figuring out not just a church but
[1:11:42] in our house and if we were afraid to
[1:11:48] root that deep then we weren't called
[1:11:50] for the job we just got up and went
[1:11:52] hallelujah hallelujah now look if you
[1:11:59] fire me
[1:12:00] don't forget that there was a clause
[1:12:02] that there was there you know where you
[1:12:04] had to give me a compensation when I
[1:12:06] left I shouldn't joke about that but I
[1:12:11] just see the bad humor for there to be a
[1:12:18] birth of the word there must first be a
[1:12:20] pregnant hey man my brother and sister
[1:12:23] now look I don't want to we got young
[1:12:24] people here and I'm not trying to be
[1:12:26] crass or anything but I just want you to
[1:12:27] understand just feel the need to just
[1:12:29] put this right out my brother and sister
[1:12:31] this pregnant doesn't come by shaking
[1:12:33] hands it does not come by rubbing elbows
[1:12:37] it doesn't come by sitting on the Pew
[1:12:42] come on let me drive this home to you my
[1:12:44] brother and sister amen
[1:12:46] it happens with a personal intimate
[1:12:49] relationship Oh y'all brother Paul
[1:12:54] you're getting a little personal yeah
[1:12:55] I'm getting a little personal
[1:12:57] cuz I'll go a step further these little
[1:12:59] kids aren't in this church because some
[1:13:01] people lived in the same house come on
[1:13:05] let's not act like oh this is nature
[1:13:07] it's how God created us but hey man you
[1:13:10] didn't have a husband and a wife rubbing
[1:13:12] elbows at the kitchen table and her one
[1:13:14] day say I think I'm gonna have a baby
[1:13:17] amen and you don't come to the house of
[1:13:19] God and rub elbows and one day say I
[1:13:21] think I'm pregnant with the Word of God
[1:13:23] amen there's got to be something deeper
[1:13:27] than just coming and sitting on a Pew
[1:13:29] and saying I belong to grace hallelujah
[1:13:34] must be something more than coming I'll
[1:13:36] tell you what's happened my brother and
[1:13:38] sister he's in the house
[1:13:40] he's in the house are you with me he's
[1:13:43] in the house it's time to get intimate
[1:13:47] it's time to step over that and quit
[1:13:51] having a impersonal relationship with
[1:13:54] Jesus Christ
[1:13:55] well I believe in God I love the Lord
[1:13:57] Jesus I do all of this my brother and
[1:14:00] sister I'll tell you what there is no
[1:14:02] such thing as a half-hearted
[1:14:04] relationship with God you have a
[1:14:07] relationship or you don't
[1:14:09] hey man it's either intimate or it's not
[1:14:14] now I hope that's not too personal for
[1:14:17] you I looked at that and I thought Lord
[1:14:20] do I dare say it about these little
[1:14:22] children it sounds like we're talking
[1:14:23] about the carnal my brother and sister
[1:14:26] amen God intended in the garden for the
[1:14:29] spoken word to bring Adam and Eve
[1:14:32] offering but we're in a fallen state and
[1:14:35] we have no problem understanding in the
[1:14:38] natural what it takes to bring four
[1:14:40] children and God put that great desire
[1:14:43] in the heart of mothers amen of sister
[1:14:46] to want to have a child to go through
[1:14:48] that travail even under the influence of
[1:14:51] the curse and we are there in the
[1:14:53] natural saying yes we want a family well
[1:14:57] God wants a family God's got a family
[1:14:59] amen and that family is not afraid to be
[1:15:02] intimate that family is not afraid to as
[1:15:05] it were right the three room house
[1:15:07] they're not going to just sit in the
[1:15:08] kitchen rub elbows at the table not
[1:15:11] gonna sit in the living room and hold
[1:15:12] hand there comes a day pardon for saying
[1:15:15] it but there comes a day that desire
[1:15:18] takes them to the bedroom and they
[1:15:22] consummate the relationship to bring
[1:15:24] forth what God called them to bring
[1:15:27] forth oh and we got way too many
[1:15:30] believers want to sit around the living
[1:15:32] room now don't misunderstand me
[1:15:34] but they want to sit around the living
[1:15:35] room and strum on the guitar they want
[1:15:37] to go over here and do this they want to
[1:15:40] go over there and do that but I want to
[1:15:41] ask you have you been to the bedroom
[1:15:49] come on he's in the house Saints amen
[1:15:53] oh this intimate relationship pregnant a
[1:15:59] word in us to bring forth Christ in the
[1:16:03] flesh Oh hallelujah
[1:16:07] this is not Christ just in the spirit
[1:16:09] realm my brother and sister right some
[1:16:12] people struggle I think around the
[1:16:13] message we still got people they don't
[1:16:15] have God head straightened down they
[1:16:17] that looks like well we got the Holy
[1:16:18] Ghost that's right that's God in you
[1:16:21] don't look it up that's what the prophet
[1:16:23] of God says it's not just some part Amen
[1:16:26] said it right here over the pulpit one
[1:16:28] not open Sunday God in you people got
[1:16:31] upset with me if God's in me where's he
[1:16:34] at my brother and sisters something's
[1:16:37] missing from the understanding Amen
[1:16:40] because a prophet of God himself said
[1:16:43] the Holy Ghost is God in you hallelujah
[1:16:50] it's time we just knock off the fetters
[1:16:53] knock off all the shackles knock off all
[1:16:55] the yokes my brother and sister and
[1:16:57] preach this message because time is
[1:17:01] wrapping up
[1:17:03] hallelujah might bury me as an old man
[1:17:05] but still the word has to be laid in
[1:17:08] place to be built upon hallelujah what
[1:17:11] is this to bring forth Christ in the
[1:17:14] flesh
[1:17:15] once again except for I didn't want to
[1:17:22] preach all day I've got so many quotes
[1:17:26] no brother David it's not justification
[1:17:27] to preach forever and ever
[1:17:29] I just put humor and that don't take
[1:17:33] that serious so many quotes my brother
[1:17:37] and sister did you just have to pass on
[1:17:42] that pass on that would pass on how and
[1:17:43] that right brother David pass on that
[1:17:45] one pass on that one pass on that one
[1:17:47] that's an hour's worth pass on that one
[1:17:49] pass on that that's another hours worth
[1:17:51] pass on that one pass on uh yeah
[1:17:54] come on we might laugh about it Saints
[1:17:57] but it's the truth there's power in this
[1:17:59] word this message is not a dead letter
[1:18:02] that started to be preached back in the
[1:18:04] forties this message is alive and well
[1:18:08] today there is the power of Almighty God
[1:18:13] in his word here today whoa can you back
[1:18:22] that up brother Paul I sure can but you
[1:18:26] don't have enough time
[1:18:29] Alleluia will be will we be reading
[1:18:34] quotes in heaven you know the reason I
[1:18:38] ask that is that's how long it would
[1:18:41] take to get through all of them yeah I'm
[1:18:47] not trying to just be funny why because
[1:18:51] these are not just quotes this is the
[1:18:54] word oh come on I saw this a little
[1:18:56] example just struck my heart sending it
[1:18:59] to supper table last night seems like
[1:19:01] yesterday was a long time ago my
[1:19:05] daughter Kristen she cut up a little bit
[1:19:07] of that venison roast that they shared
[1:19:09] with us hmm can't tell you how good that
[1:19:11] was but we don't talk about food she cut
[1:19:14] it up in little chunks and she put some
[1:19:16] of it on declan's tray in his highchair
[1:19:19] and I was kind of I don't know I'm
[1:19:23] getting old I'm chunks look big and she
[1:19:26] sure gave him a lot of them and he's
[1:19:28] only got two little teeth in and I and
[1:19:32] then something crossed my mind
[1:19:34] it's not your baby old man it's not your
[1:19:39] baby just leave it to mama and so he's
[1:19:44] there and it's all in a little stack and
[1:19:46] he reaches out there and he grabs all of
[1:19:48] them and I'm like I can't I can own up
[1:19:50] he's right here beside now no way I'm
[1:19:52] letting him put all of them in his mouth
[1:19:53] but you know little guy he drops all but
[1:19:56] one of them before he gets them off the
[1:19:58] tray and they're just and he shoves that
[1:20:01] one in his mouth and I'm all ready to
[1:20:02] stick my finger in there and pry that
[1:20:04] thing jerky mouth a highchair papa
[1:20:08] and he starts the gum in that thing
[1:20:10] I kid you not Saints he closed his eyes
[1:20:15] and we're hmm then he picked up another
[1:20:24] one and ate it even faster and he picked
[1:20:28] up the other one and ate it even faster
[1:20:30] picked up the last one and ate it faster
[1:20:33] amen hallelujah
[1:20:36] can somebody say thank you Lord
[1:20:37] hallelujah Oh somebody said well we
[1:20:41] gonna water the word down for you no you
[1:20:44] don't I was he quipped hallelujah to eat
[1:20:49] this word hey man I don't need old man
[1:20:53] over here to tell me what I can and
[1:20:55] can't do in the Lord and I'll tell you
[1:21:00] Saints I like us as a minister as a
[1:21:04] pastor I like it when I look out there
[1:21:06] and I see the Saints just God mmm mmm
[1:21:10] mmm that was can I have some more
[1:21:14] hallelujah spoken word is the original
[1:21:19] seed hallelujah Oh people god bless you
[1:21:23] hear me now you know the problem we've
[1:21:27] lost my brother and sister is that so
[1:21:30] many people have turned brother Branham
[1:21:31] into the kind old priest I'm sorry to
[1:21:35] tell you our prophet is not the kind old
[1:21:38] priest Alleluia could not be anointed
[1:21:42] with the spirit of Elijah and be the
[1:21:44] kind old priest
[1:21:45] I can't believe nothing but God's Word I
[1:21:51] want it to be my life everything that I
[1:21:54] am and I want you to do the same
[1:21:57] let your walks your talks your moves
[1:22:01] everything you do be in the Word of God
[1:22:05] oh I know some people get angry with me
[1:22:08] they don't like me putting it this way
[1:22:10] but my brother and sister I'll just tell
[1:22:12] you where I stand when he said let it be
[1:22:15] in the Word of God he was talking about
[1:22:17] this
[1:22:19] not to take the first two lines out of
[1:22:22] this quote jump five years take the last
[1:22:24] two lines out of that quote jump two
[1:22:27] years and take the middle of lines out
[1:22:29] of another quote say this is what the
[1:22:30] Prophet meant take it back to the word
[1:22:39] amen let the mind of Christ come into
[1:22:44] you and that'll pregnat you with the
[1:22:48] word o now pardon me I ain't gonna be
[1:22:53] able to do this I am getting too old but
[1:22:57] when he said let the mind of Christ be
[1:22:59] into you he's not talking about this I
[1:23:07] feel I feel yes I feel somebody help me
[1:23:17] up
[1:23:19] Thank You brother ever
[1:23:23] what Saints let's get over this yeah we
[1:23:27] have feelings I have feelings you guys
[1:23:29] hurt my feelings you hurt my feelings
[1:23:31] more often than you know but I have to
[1:23:34] get over my feelings yes my feelings
[1:23:36] will never take me where I am going
[1:23:38] my feelings will never get me to the
[1:23:41] altar will never get me to the throne
[1:23:43] will never get me to the Sea of crystal
[1:23:45] will never get me to see how beautiful
[1:23:47] heaven must be my feelings will lie to
[1:23:50] me though the scripture says that our
[1:23:52] heart is deceitful whoa let the mind of
[1:24:02] Christ come in to you you know what the
[1:24:04] only way you're gonna get into the mind
[1:24:05] of Christ you're gonna have to spend
[1:24:07] enough time with them now let's just
[1:24:10] bring a natural type to this it's crazy
[1:24:12] how this whole married thing works right
[1:24:14] I mean my goodness Geri and I look back
[1:24:17] and I'm thinking my goodness this girl
[1:24:20] she's like I was this way when you
[1:24:23] married me oh she still I'm telling you
[1:24:26] sticks her chin out and everything I was
[1:24:28] his way when you married me
[1:24:30] don't you be trying to change me now
[1:24:35] then she looks at me and goes my
[1:24:37] goodness if I had only known what I was
[1:24:40] marrying
[1:24:41] but then she corrects herself and says
[1:24:44] well I did pray about it
[1:24:45] I asked her did the Lord actually answer
[1:24:49] that prayer though now come on Saints
[1:24:53] for the mind of Christ again in us we
[1:24:56] have to spend enough time with Christ
[1:24:59] that we can understand him it's so funny
[1:25:04] sit in a restaurant older couple setting
[1:25:07] a couple tables over this in Hawaii when
[1:25:08] god bless Terri and I with the love a
[1:25:10] keishon there and the waitress comes up
[1:25:13] and says sir what would you like to
[1:25:14] drink and he's like and his cute little
[1:25:19] wife there probably about 75 years old
[1:25:21] he wants a strawberry lemonade he never
[1:25:28] said a word just mmm the way he slurp
[1:25:34] down that strawberry lemonade that you
[1:25:35] knew that's what he wanted it he wasn't
[1:25:38] impact here you know he didn't have a
[1:25:39] domineering wife he just was gonna
[1:25:43] through the whole list and finally go I
[1:25:45] think I'll settle for a strawberry
[1:25:46] lemonade she saved a lot of time let the
[1:25:52] mind of Christ come into you and that'll
[1:25:56] pregnat you with the word now look III
[1:26:01] I'm just full of ambition this morning
[1:26:03] my brother and sister it ain't what
[1:26:05] brother so-and-so taught us for 25 30 40
[1:26:07] years no that ain't going to get us into
[1:26:10] the world oh but I said under this
[1:26:12] ministry and I said under that ministry
[1:26:14] and I would never forsake those
[1:26:16] ministries because they were my whole
[1:26:17] founder maybe you need to maybe the time
[1:26:20] has come for you to forsake all of that
[1:26:23] and get in to the mind of Christ
[1:26:29] hallelujah hallelujah let the mind of
[1:26:34] Christ come into you and that'll pregnat
[1:26:36] you with the word if you don't if you
[1:26:39] let the mind of the denomination come in
[1:26:42] you'll be denominational pregnant if you
[1:26:46] let the mind of Christ come into you he
[1:26:48] can't deny his own cuz he's gone
[1:26:52] hallelujah I want his mind my brother
[1:26:54] and sister because then he can't deny me
[1:26:57] so I've got to do is die to myself
[1:27:00] submit myself to my husband amen and
[1:27:04] move right to that position and he could
[1:27:06] no more reject me than the reason the
[1:27:08] prophet of God shows us that Adam could
[1:27:10] not reject Eve hallelujah Christ

[1:37:50] male the female receives seed come on my
[1:37:59] brother and sister I don't say this to

[1:38:27] bride look Saints I don't say this on my
[1:38:33] defense but to make a point to you I

[1:38:38] I've never come and told you you must
[1:38:41] believe this and you must believe that
[1:38:43] you know why because you see if I start
[1:38:48] telling you what to eat and how to eat
[1:38:51] it and when to eat it and when you have
[1:38:54] had enough a man handling you

[1:39:56] I sit in church for a season I'm talking
[1:39:59] about me I said in church for a season
[1:40:01] and whatever I got from God was because
[1:40:03] some Minister led of God come down and
[1:40:05] laid it on the table in front of me and
[1:40:07] I was eating it and you know it was good
[1:40:10] it was nourishing amen but still I
[1:40:12] wasn't doing one single thing for myself

[1:40:32] time while honey I'm sorry I got to work
[1:40:35] this weekend after a while amen

[1:41:07] right through it
[1:41:11] come on Saints I'm not here to insult or
[1:41:15] whatever but let's just get real with
[1:41:17] ourselves our story gets thin after a
[1:41:19] while you ever noticed we manage to do
[1:41:24] everything we want to do come on Oh skip
[1:41:33] your story Paul go back to the word see
[1:41:37] here's this eagle been fed everything
[1:41:43] gaining some strength there's an
[1:41:45] instinct in him very soon he's not
[1:41:47] sitting in the bottom of the nest pretty
[1:41:49] soon it's perched on the side of the
[1:41:50] nest and you know something's happen in
[1:41:55] them feathers start to pop out all the
[1:41:57] little fuzzy comfortable stuff starts to
[1:41:59] go away and feathers start coming out
[1:42:02] and something starts happening that
[1:42:05] eagle he sits in the nest now look I
[1:42:06] want you to understand that Eagle that
[1:42:09] little igloo it's a firm grip on the
[1:42:11] nest but he's standing there back to me
[1:42:20] so I don't offend anyone I did a lot of
[1:42:24] flapping and I had to start doing the
[1:42:26] flapping before I come back in the house
[1:42:29] of God because I thought I'd be like a
[1:42:32] hypocrite to say Amen in the house of
[1:42:34] God living like I've lived but God
[1:42:37] started dealing with me and my wife
[1:42:39] bought me a little Walkman I know this
[1:42:42] younger generation don't know what that
[1:42:43] kind of stuff is but it actually had a
[1:42:46] cassette tape in it you know
[1:42:48] old-fashioned stuff you know oh this
[1:42:52] will sound bad you guys maybe sister
[1:42:54] Jerry should have been the pastor but
[1:42:58] she started she started encouraged me
[1:43:00] here Paula I already put a sermon in the
[1:43:02] in your Walkman and fresh batteries
[1:43:04] listen to it today please this story's a
[1:43:11] lot uglier new thanks Saints I stand
[1:43:15] here by God's grace nothing
[1:43:19] I'd find myself somewhere work and
[1:43:22] shoveling corrugate changing water and I
[1:43:25] think okay put that in there turn that
[1:43:27] on least brother branham you could be a
[1:43:38] little kinder until one day i've been
[1:43:43] eating on that word and something
[1:43:46] stirred and I said Amen who was it said
[1:43:53] that do you know I can tell you it
[1:43:56] wasn't me oh I can take you back to
[1:43:59] quotes if you want it it was Christ in
[1:44:02] me saying Amen to his word it wasn't
[1:44:06] this flesh this flesh felt like dirt but
[1:44:09] it was Christ in me amen because
[1:44:12] something told me I'm not a vulture I
[1:44:14] don't care how hard the preacher
[1:44:16] preaches at me I'm gonna prove the
[1:44:18] preacher wrong if the preacher says I'm
[1:44:21] the problem I'm gonna come to church
[1:44:23] prayed up I'm gonna come to church
[1:44:24] inspired I'm gonna prove the preacher
[1:44:26] wrong I'm not the problem or I can run
[1:44:34] well hallelujah that one might have been
[1:44:37] hard to swallow you see the word just
[1:44:44] made manifest the C gene that's in us
[1:44:47] Amen it had to be God all along Saints
[1:44:49] it ain't you and I do you get that Amen
[1:44:52] for this pure word to be born
[1:44:54] it could not be the seed of our hearts
[1:44:56] it could not be the inspiration of our
[1:44:59] mind but it was the seed gene of God in
[1:45:01] our heart and then it was Godsey G they
[1:45:05] come down and inspire that and the
[1:45:07] prophet of God said that brings forth a
[1:45:10] child Amen that's what brings forth the
[1:45:13] Living Word hallelujah because if it was
[1:45:17] me or you in any part of this it would
[1:45:20] no longer be a pure word it will no
[1:45:23] longer be unadulterated amen now we'll
[1:45:26] probably preach on to this so brother
[1:45:28] Chris brother David you don't touch it
[1:45:30] amen hallelujah but I'll tell you my
[1:45:33] brother and sister the Prophet goes and
[1:45:35] he says look what it is
[1:45:37] the hybrid seed when anything else is
[1:45:41] introduced into it it's now a hybrid
[1:45:45] seed and the hybrid seed will never take
[1:45:48] you back to the original it can't take
[1:45:52] you back to the original because
[1:45:54] something else was introduced and
[1:45:57] changes the DNA forever oh just study
[1:46:02] about it now I don't want to be too
[1:46:03] personal here too much though when a man
[1:46:05] in a woman gets intimate and have
[1:46:07] relationship now my brother and sister
[1:46:09] they're proving that the man changes the
[1:46:12] DNA of the woman forever oh if that
[1:46:17] doesn't take it back to the word and
[1:46:19] stir you all my brother and sister
[1:46:21] that's why the prophet of God said don't
[1:46:23] let that denominational spirit get into
[1:46:26] you or get into your church because it
[1:46:29] will change the nature and the DNA of
[1:46:32] your church forever but this is not a
[1:46:36] place for us to come to hybrid this is a
[1:46:40] place my brother and sister for the true
[1:46:42] word to be burst Oh hallelujah Amen what
[1:46:49] that DNA that see gene in me and you a
[1:46:53] man will bring court the word according
[1:46:56] to the word that's all I can do right
[1:46:59] every seed bring forth of its own kind
[1:47:01] amen hallelujah hey you want to see God
[1:47:06] move hey man anybody want to see God
[1:47:08] move you want to see the supernatural
[1:47:11] you want to see the miraculous

[1:47:17] Oh I come to church today expecting you
[1:47:21] know where two or three are gathered in
[1:47:23] his name now look that's the scripture
[1:47:24] I'm not going to speak against it but
[1:47:26] I'm gonna tell you move on from that you
[1:47:29] can look around and say well one two
[1:47:31] three four five six seven twenty

[1:48:30] and the devils been pounding on them I'm
[1:48:34] gonna make sure that I bring the double
[1:48:36] portion to church or we can sit back and
[1:48:39] say well there'll be two or three of
[1:48:41] this so Amen God will meet us there oh
[1:48:45] my doing okay you see it's time for us
[1:48:52] to quit that foolin around
[1:48:54] we almost use this scripture sometimes
[1:48:56] parables of the scripture as a crutch
[1:48:59] well hallelujah I looked around and I
[1:49:02] feel beaten and I sing like I'm beaten
[1:49:05] and I worship like I'm beaten but so
[1:49:07] does everybody else so I'm doing okay
[1:49:10] really well hallelujah hopefully there's
[1:49:20] no laws against Church abuse look it's
[1:49:25] time to have a real expectation you know
[1:49:29] the prophet Bob Foster talks about those
[1:49:31] painted fires
[1:49:32] come on Saints let's just go let's just
[1:49:35] get our little painted fire here we'll
[1:49:38] get three or four of them so there's
[1:49:39] room enough for all of us to gather
[1:49:40] around it and we'll all be doing good
[1:49:42] because we can look at the painted fire
[1:49:47] house that
[1:49:49] for us I don't think it works at all
[1:49:52] does it
[1:49:53] hallelujah I remember one time many many
[1:49:56] years ago my wife just really rails on
[1:49:59] me cuz it seems like I married her and
[1:50:01] quit hunting I think that she probably
[1:50:03] was the fault
[1:50:04] I was hunting with a brother many years
[1:50:09] ago or wading through the snow my feet
[1:50:11] had quit hurting hours before they just
[1:50:13] they were just numb and he's his march
[1:50:15] along he's all happening wants to climb
[1:50:17] another mountain and do whatever and I
[1:50:18] was like what's wrong with you and he
[1:50:20] said it isn't what's wrong with me it's
[1:50:21] what's right with me I have
[1:50:22] battery-powered socks well I tell you
[1:50:28] what it didn't do me any more good
[1:50:30] knowing he had battery-powered socks
[1:50:31] than before my feet were still numb and
[1:50:34] I wanted to go back to camp and I could
[1:50:37] care less about this hunting trip I'm
[1:50:38] gonna get back in the pickup and I'm
[1:50:39] gonna drive home because whose crazy
[1:50:42] idea was this to go hunting in December
[1:50:44] because a deer and the elk will all be
[1:50:46] right down here well right down here the
[1:50:49] snow was only this deep painted fire my
[1:50:53] brother and sister how about we reach
[1:50:55] out would you would you humor me today
[1:50:56] how about we just reach out and tear our
[1:50:58] painted fire into today how we tear it
[1:51:01] it through and not settle for a painted
[1:51:04] fire talking about what God did 50 60 70
[1:51:07] or 100 years ago let's talk about what
[1:51:09] God is going to do and is doing right
[1:51:12] here today but if you said they're just
[1:51:14] dead oh pardon me I don't mean it to be
[1:51:17] any salt to anybody but you said they're
[1:51:19] just dead on the Pew and expect them to
[1:51:21] rev you up yet you cited well I'll tell
[1:51:24] you more than likely what will happen is
[1:51:25] you'll just start critiquing the
[1:51:27] preacher he repeated that four times he
[1:51:29] didn't say that right he didn't do this
[1:51:31] over here my brother and sister you see
[1:51:33] it's all what our expectation is we talk
[1:51:37] about expectation the prophet of God
[1:51:39] talks about expectation let's start
[1:51:41] coming and exercising expectation
[1:51:45] hallelujah lujah oh you know what
[1:51:54] I don't want to burn the church down but
[1:51:56] I think we ought to get a holy ghost
[1:51:58] wildfire grace Tabernacle I'll tell you

[1:52:31] mom and dad and they think I need to
[1:52:33] serve God and I need to get excited and
[1:52:35] I need to commit my life to the Lord and
[1:52:37] all I see is this painted fire and I
[1:52:40] have handled the painted fire I've put
[1:52:42] it out in the weeds it won't light them
[1:52:44] on fire I'll put it to me it won't light
[1:52:45] me on fire this painted fire won't warm

[1:53:59] because you got not one drop of
[1:54:01] expectation to see it amen you're
[1:54:05] letting this body this mind this spirit
[1:54:08] hold the supernatural hostage o my
[1:54:12] brother and sister well can I have just
[1:54:20] another minute or two his mother knew
[1:54:26] that she had laid two eggs not one there
[1:54:29] had to be another one somewhere

[1:54:33] circling finally she'd come over the
[1:54:35] barnyard and she found Paul I mean she
[1:54:39] found her baby and she screamed to him
[1:54:42] it was a voice that he realized that's
[1:54:46] the thing that fit
[1:54:49] who can say him into that hey man I was
[1:54:53] raised in the church raised on the Pew
[1:54:55] my brother and sister I walked away but
[1:54:58] the voice kept calling me and I praise
[1:55:01] the Lord woke up one day and said this
[1:55:04] is the only thing that fits hallelujah
[1:55:09] well thank you lord
[1:55:12] I like it when things fit amen that's
[1:55:17] what he was looking for see and he
[1:55:19] realized then that he wasn't a chicken
[1:55:21] oh my back to this realization he was an
[1:55:25] eagle and that's the way every
[1:55:26] born-again Christian when you come I
[1:55:28] don't care how many denominations you
[1:55:30] joined how many names you you put your
[1:55:32] name on the books and things when the
[1:55:34] real Word of God is vindicated and main
[1:55:36] true before you like that you realize
[1:55:39] you're an eagle NoHo I tell you my
[1:55:43] brother and sister I got some friends
[1:55:44] and walked away from this message I'm
[1:55:46] not speaking down to him I believe the
[1:55:47] Lord will call them back but they went
[1:55:49] out and I have these conversations with
[1:55:52] them that are our heart I mean my
[1:55:54] brother and sister when somebody says
[1:55:55] well Paul you owe it I owe it to you Oh
[1:56:00] take these words I owe it to you to take
[1:56:04] you guys away from the message you know
[1:56:10] what my answer to him was what are you
[1:56:13] doing what are you doing well
[1:56:18] I can't find a church I like wonder why
[1:56:27] amen you know what I told him much as I
[1:56:38] love you buddy
[1:56:39] I'm not going to join you in your misery
[1:56:48] it sounds offensive but there's a church
[1:56:51] down the street here it's got a rainbow
[1:56:52] I can go down there and be anything I
[1:56:55] want to be but you see I've already been
[1:56:58] there not that church but be whatever I
[1:57:02] want to be that didn't fit I could be
[1:57:07] like these guys here but that doesn't
[1:57:09] fit I won't be like these guys but that
[1:57:10] doesn't fit I could do this but it
[1:57:12] doesn't fit hallelujah I can't help what
[1:57:16] he believes what he feels what he calls
[1:57:18] right or wrong all I know is what fits
[1:57:21] hallelujah I woke up one day and said
[1:57:23] this fits hallelujah Amen didn't fit
[1:57:28] that's what he's looking for she
[1:57:30] realized that he wasn't a chicken he was
[1:57:32] an eagle and that's the way every
[1:57:34] born-again Christian when you come I
[1:57:36] don't care how many denominations you
[1:57:38] joined how many names you put your name
[1:57:39] on the books and things that when that
[1:57:41] real word of God is vindicated and made
[1:57:43] true before you like that you realize
[1:57:45] you're an eagle right there because all
[1:57:48] this clucking of a hen you join this and
[1:57:51] join this and go this way and that way
[1:57:53] it's nonsense it's genuine adding to the
[1:57:56] word oh my brother and sister let me go
[1:57:58] back to the Eagle story when that Eagle
[1:58:00] ever finally gets all of those primary
[1:58:02] feathers you know he can't fly without
[1:58:04] them right so we got to get a foundation
[1:58:06] a spiritual foundation under us because
[1:58:08] otherwise the wind will slip from
[1:58:10] beneath your wings and when you get
[1:58:13] those eagle's wings out there and those
[1:58:15] primary feathers say man you get your
[1:58:17] things laid down in brecht foundation
[1:58:20] what in the prophet of God talks about
[1:58:22] witnessing those things that Eagle gets
[1:58:24] that little eagle it to latch on and
[1:58:26] takes them out there and God is so mean
[1:58:31] just don't you and let you just but
[1:58:46] there's not been a one of us that ever
[1:58:49] hit rock-bottom
[1:58:50] God come right down and said Here I am
[1:58:54] and you know I like rabbit I like lamb I
[1:59:02] like all of this and as long as mama is
[1:59:06] feeding me this is good but did you know
[1:59:12] that right after mama teaches baby
[1:59:15] eaglet to fly she also puts him on a
[1:59:19] diet
[1:59:23] come on Saints amen and as he's flying
[1:59:29] around Mama's like remember that rabbit
[1:59:32] you liked all this preaching about the
[1:59:34] third pole in the opening of the seals
[1:59:36] and all of this how you've got the Holy
[1:59:39] Ghost and all this there is it for
[1:59:44] yourself that's so cool
[1:59:47] no no my brother and sister I'll tell
[1:59:50] you what it is I'll tell you what
[1:59:51] happens when someone's never learned now
[1:59:53] I don't say this I don't say this
[1:59:55] derogatory at all it's just a simple
[1:59:57] fact but when someone's never learned
[1:59:59] how to get in here and find it for
[2:00:03] themselves well I'm not talking about
[2:00:05] outside of the message things but you've
[2:00:08] got to get to the place that you say you
[2:00:10] know what Matt that carcass that we fed
[2:00:12] on hey man that was so good I had a
[2:00:15] gastric Jubilee I shouted and I did it I
[2:00:17] love that I want more of that how do I
[2:00:19] get more of that well I guess I'll wait
[2:00:22] til Wednesday night I guess I'll wait to
[2:00:25] to Sunday wool my brother and sister you
[2:00:30] got to learn to feed yourself you gotta
[2:00:33] learn to feed yourself amen oh I'm not
[2:00:35] talking about coming up with our own
[2:00:37] revelation hallelujah but you got to
[2:00:41] learn to feed yourself
[2:00:43] because mommy Eagle will come along and
[2:00:45] she'll point out the rabbit for you and
[2:00:47] she'll even communicate to you how this
[2:00:49] is all going to work and what that
[2:00:50] rabbits behavior is and how what you got
[2:00:53] to do to feed yourself but she's not
[2:00:55] going to go day after day for the rest
[2:00:56] of your life it's time for us to be what
[2:00:59] the prophet of God said when he said a
[2:01:01] Christian a real Christian is wrong
[2:01:03] she's not a hothouse flower she's not
[2:01:06] some little Lily that you know just
[2:01:08] waiting for everything to work oh my
[2:01:10] brother and sister she is rugged Oh
[2:01:14] hallelujah and when a germ comes in the
[2:01:17] womb of the female it don't take you
[2:01:19] didn't become a human germ from your
[2:01:21] father and then the next thing you
[2:01:22] become the germ from a dog
[2:01:23] and the next thing from a cat and the
[2:01:25] next thing from a chicken it was all
[2:01:27] human germ and the body of Jesus Christ
[2:01:30] what does he say the body is the bride
[2:01:34] amen the body of Jesus Christ the bride
[2:01:38] amen
[2:01:40] will be part of his body so she can't go
[2:01:43] and become a separate entity she's got
[2:01:46] to be oh I'll tell you what to those
[2:01:49] people I hope none of them are in this
[2:01:50] church I hope it's none of you sisters
[2:01:52] but when we come to the place that we
[2:01:54] will not submit to the higher authority
[2:01:56] as it would a wife to her husband and us
[2:01:59] to Christ we've got issues and we need
[2:02:01] to settle those issues don't make a big
[2:02:03] fight over it don't make a big fuss over
[2:02:05] it go back to the word and say Lord let
[2:02:08] me sit pattern up this word that's all I
[2:02:12] want to be I don't have to be a doormat
[2:02:14] I don't have to be beat around I'm not a
[2:02:16] slave a man I'm a daughter of God but
[2:02:19] lord let me understand what it means to
[2:02:21] submit an S comes down double so for the
[2:02:24] preacher hallelujah amen gotta learn to
[2:02:29] submit amen and the body of Jesus Christ
[2:02:32] the bride will be part of his body which
[2:02:34] will he was the word and the bride will
[2:02:37] have to be the word word oh come on I
[2:02:42] wish to add another book here
[2:02:44] amen let me borrow a book somebody Amen
[2:02:47] hallelujah huh oh I really want the
[2:02:49] Bible thank you hey man so what is he
[2:02:51] saying here amen the bride will have to
[2:02:54] be the word
[2:02:55] amen and the word added to the word
[2:03:00] added to the word amen and that's how we
[2:03:04] get built up my brother and sister
[2:03:06] Luther's justification Wesly
[2:03:09] sanctification Pentecostals baptism of
[2:03:12] the Holy Spirit restoration of the gifts
[2:03:14] all the rest of it goes with it see it's
[2:03:17] got to be the word on top of the word
[2:03:19] germ on top of the germ life on top of
[2:03:22] the life to bring out the full stature
[2:03:25] of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:27] now remember you was an attribute Oh
[2:03:31] hallelujah not just something snatched
[2:03:34] out the atmosphere you're an attribute
[2:03:36] God Himself Oh
[2:03:40] I'll tell you people struggle with that
[2:03:42] God Himself just go study it out through
[2:03:44] the message amen hallelujah what was on
[2:03:50] God was reconciling himself to the world
[2:03:53] oh I tell you I just read a quote the
[2:03:55] other day I showed a saved I can't find
[2:03:56] it again and that just really bothers me
[2:03:58] but brother Branham says God come right
[2:04:02] down there that dead body of Jesus
[2:04:09] poured life into him come on that body
[2:04:15] laying there was dead people have well
[2:04:18] you know it was just God doing his thing
[2:04:20] no that body was dead God chose to
[2:04:23] resurrect that body just like we chose
[2:04:26] to resurrect this body Oh hallelujah
[2:04:33] hallelujah I've got to hurry along here
[2:04:35] I'm just having so much fun this is
[2:04:37] getting ridiculous okay and now the
[2:04:44] thing of it is after we find out these
[2:04:47] things that Christ is coming for his
[2:04:50] bride now how do we get into that bride
[2:04:53] how do we get in that right that's the
[2:04:57] question many say join our congregation
[2:05:00] one of them wants a certain type of
[2:05:02] baptism one wants to do this or that one
[2:05:05] said you must speak with tongues or you
[2:05:06] haven't got another said you don't have
[2:05:08] to speak with tongues this
[2:05:09] says you must dance in the spirit this
[2:05:11] one says you must shout this you've got
[2:05:13] got a sensation it's alright and then
[2:05:16] still it's all wrong how could a man or
[2:05:19] a woman or a child of God that's born of
[2:05:21] the Spirit of God deny the word of God
[2:05:24] when God Himself interpret it and say
[2:05:27] this is it I promised it here it is
[2:05:29] showing it just as plain as it can be
[2:05:32] now you know here's the stumbling block
[2:05:35] Saints some people say I don't see it
[2:05:39] now we're gonna make sure we don't get
[2:05:42] an attitude of like oh then then poor
[2:05:45] sorry people can't see it what you
[2:05:48] should do is stop and say thank you Lord
[2:05:49] that you were kind enough to me and then
[2:05:53] I could see it not Allu you because
[2:05:57] people say well well Paul I don't agree
[2:05:59] with you show me the message you know I
[2:06:02] didn't even bother I'm sorry this might
[2:06:04] sound bad I didn't even bother to
[2:06:06] respond because all they had to do is
[2:06:08] take the very words they were arguing
[2:06:10] over put it right into a message search
[2:06:12] and they would come up with all kinds of
[2:06:16] places and ways that the prophet of God
[2:06:18] spoke about it and clarified it I'm
[2:06:21] sorry I'm sorry those that hunger and
[2:06:27] thirst you know I'm a terrible cook but
[2:06:32] I'm a survivalist in other words that
[2:06:35] means I can eat my own cooking and live
[2:06:37] through it and you know there's times
[2:06:41] I've been known to call sister Jerry and
[2:06:43] say honey when you're gonna be home and
[2:06:45] she's like well I've still got to go to
[2:06:46] the bank and I've still got to go do
[2:06:48] this errand you wanted me to do and I
[2:06:49] kind of get those parts it's gonna be 2
[2:06:51] or 3 hours and I don't want to cook so
[2:06:54] bad I'll go hungry for three hours till
[2:06:59] she shows up no that's normal don't look
[2:07:05] down on me that's normal amen
[2:07:08] because you see I'm not in survival mode
[2:07:11] survival mode is when she used to go
[2:07:13] visit her family in Alaska and was gone
[2:07:15] for two weeks and then it was like whoa
[2:07:17] honey would you have her supper tonight

[2:07:31] gone but I'm falling some more well you
[2:07:38] know you can't ruin a hamburger right
[2:07:41] look Saints this is it showing just as
[2:07:48] plain as it can be why they're bound to
[2:07:50] see it see how could Christ deny his own
[2:07:53] Word and if Christ is in you it can't
[2:07:55] deny his own words then how do we get
[2:07:58] into this body first Corinthians twelve
[2:08:00] by one spirit were all baptized into
[2:08:02] this body by one Holy Spirit baptism
[2:08:04] then if you want to put that down first
[2:08:06] Corinthians 12:13 by one spirit we're
[2:08:08] all baptized and the Spirit is the life
[2:08:11] of Christ is that right the congregation
[2:08:15] said amen amen congregation said amen
[2:08:17] the life of Christ and the life of any
[2:08:19] seed which he was the word seed brings
[2:08:22] the seed to life you get it and if life
[2:08:26] is laying in the seed and this baptism
[2:08:29] of the Holy Spirit comes upon it it's
[2:08:31] bound bring that seed life hallelujah we
[2:08:36] don't have a complicated formula we
[2:08:38] don't got a big thing we got a toe the
[2:08:39] mark to my brother and sister people say
[2:08:42] well you know you gotta this and for
[2:08:44] this and the Prophet said this the
[2:08:45] Prophet said this hallelujah we can go
[2:08:50] take all the other ones and do whatever
[2:08:51] you want to do but the Prophet said this
[2:08:54] my brother and sister and I'm telling
[2:08:56] you the seed of the bride is in the
[2:08:59] bride and the groom which is our Lord
[2:09:02] Jesus Christ is the one who Germa ties
[2:09:05] that seed and is bringing forth the body
[2:09:08] bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[2:09:12] hallelujah oh I'll tell you why I know
[2:09:17] I'm going for PO to code I'm sorry I
[2:09:18] don't normally preach this way but
[2:09:19] lately I just can't help myself looking
[2:09:22] now in the rising of the Sun if you
[2:09:24] haven't listened this sermon for a while
[2:09:25] I'd recommend you go home listen to this
[2:09:27] hey man it is so good I just cannot get
[2:09:30] over it
[2:09:30] amen it's just so many things you listen
[2:09:32] to it and some more pops right out of it
[2:09:34] now the very essence of the mess
[2:09:37] that was sent that he is risen from the
[2:09:40] dead we his beneficiaries we who share
[2:09:43] the resurrection with him draw benefits
[2:09:46] from this by proving to the world that
[2:09:49] he is alive
[2:09:51] now who's proving to the world that he
[2:09:53] is alive Christ in you there is the
[2:09:59] proof that he's alive because we were
[2:10:02] dead and we have been resurrected and it
[2:10:06] was not some done in the dark thing
[2:10:08] God's drugged the drunks he's drugged
[2:10:11] the prostitutes he's drugged the
[2:10:12] whatever's and proved to the world he
[2:10:15] can change his people hallelujah Amen
[2:10:23] okay
[2:10:25] where am I Who am I what am I doing here
[2:10:28] I'm afraid today that too many of us are
[2:10:30] not getting people to Christ we're
[2:10:34] getting them to a church to a theory but
[2:10:38] we must get them to Christ amen that's
[2:10:44] the only solution Saints Church is good
[2:10:46] we're here today I get a talk you listen
[2:10:50] wonderful really is that all we're doing
[2:10:54] here no I hope not I trust not you see
[2:10:59] what we're doing my brother and sister
[2:11:00] is we are getting to the place that
[2:11:04] Christ is no longer just in his church
[2:11:07] as a building but he's in his church
[2:11:12] hallelujah
[2:11:13] yeah must get them to Christ he is the
[2:11:16] only one and the only one that has life
[2:11:18] he that has the son has life and if the
[2:11:22] life of a man that's dead be projected
[2:11:24] in you meaning Christ you will live the
[2:11:26] same life he lived if the blood of a man
[2:11:29] was a certain type and you took the
[2:11:31] blood from one man and changed the blood
[2:11:32] of one man into another he would
[2:11:35] absolutely be that type blood in other
[2:11:36] words that the bloods there you can't
[2:11:38] argue with the type amen hallelujah now
[2:11:40] look and that gospel light of the
[2:11:42] resurrection the confirmation of the
[2:11:44] word how did we know he was the Christ
[2:11:46] because he proved what he was talking
[2:11:49] about
[2:11:50] how will I know the message of the hour
[2:11:52] God proves what he promised and he talks
[2:11:56] about it and that is the identification
[2:11:59] that we are beneficiaries with him in
[2:12:01] the resurrection he proves what he was
[2:12:04] he and what he has talked about now I
[2:12:06] want to interject this in again this is
[2:12:08] my personal view of it this is my
[2:12:10] personal take of it no one has to agree
[2:12:12] with me but my brother and my sister
[2:12:14] I'll tell you what I believe with all of
[2:12:17] my heart all of the vindications of who
[2:12:19] brother Branham was as a prophet the
[2:12:22] hand the discernment all of the signs
[2:12:25] all of these gifts that was given the
[2:12:28] opening of the word and we say that was
[2:12:30] brother branham's vindication that's
[2:12:31] good I agree with it my brother and
[2:12:33] sister every bit of it fits perfectly
[2:12:35] with the scripture but I tell you now
[2:12:39] don't stumble over this but I tell you
[2:12:41] my brother and sister to brother Paul
[2:12:43] the vindication of brother Branham his
[2:12:45] ministry he talked about it he said this
[2:12:48] is what the word will produce this is
[2:12:50] what the life will do and this will be
[2:12:52] and you can talk about all that and say
[2:12:54] well you know there's right on the tapes
[2:12:56] you know names that were called people
[2:12:57] have went even in latter times here you
[2:13:00] know back years these people it's the
[2:13:01] way now but they went to him and said
[2:13:03] you know you was in a prayer line your
[2:13:04] name was called was this and people talk
[2:13:06] about yes I was there I was healed this
[2:13:09] and this happened all this experience
[2:13:11] and did you know there was a message and
[2:13:13] I'm not really interested well okay okay
[2:13:16] that's good but my brother and sister
[2:13:19] I'll tell you what's vindication to me
[2:13:21] vindication to me was the very thing
[2:13:23] that the word said he said the word will
[2:13:25] produce it I've come to put this in the
[2:13:27] order I've come to do this and if you
[2:13:29] get the word you get the Holy Ghost you
[2:13:30] get the line you this is what it will
[2:13:32] produce and here it is and here it is
[2:13:35] what he talked about is coming to pass
[2:13:38] it's right here he didn't just kind of
[2:13:42] hid it here and kind of hid it here
[2:13:44] paper like well we're william branham
[2:13:46] and the problem is here well you're
[2:13:48] looking way too far behind because the
[2:13:51] word was spoken and it went forth as a
[2:13:53] seed and it come into a bedding ground
[2:13:56] and some people one day a walking on a
[2:13:58] street walking into a mission coming
[2:14:01] into a service into a tent
[2:14:03] hearing the preaching of the word and
[2:14:05] something German ties in them and I tell
[2:14:08] you what happened they didn't walk out
[2:14:10] in five years later go I think something
[2:14:12] happened they walk out and go I don't
[2:14:15] know what happened but something
[2:14:16] happened oh I don't want to be crass
[2:14:18] today but they got intimate with Jesus
[2:14:21] Christ
[2:14:22] and a seed was put into them and it's
[2:14:25] not them and it's not their seed it was
[2:14:28] Christ the seed and the Dermott eyes
[2:14:30] life was Christ and it will bring forth
[2:14:34] hallelujah
[2:14:35] it will bring forth a virgin book Word
[2:14:39] of God not manhandled not man
[2:14:42] interpreted not man twisted Oh
[2:14:45] hallelujah
[2:14:46] Oh what he promised to do in Christ he
[2:14:50] proved on the resurrection what he
[2:14:52] promised to do in the days of Moses he
[2:14:54] proves he proved what he promised in the
[2:14:57] days of Enoch he proved in all the days
[2:14:59] of the Apostles he proved it now in this
[2:15:02] day Oh hallelujah

[2:15:08] date is may something 2020 my brother

[2:16:24] oh right here
[2:16:25] Thanks right in front of my face well
[2:16:27] that's the way it is for a lot of people
[2:16:31] we cannot do it by some tradition of men
[2:16:35] we only reflect exactly what we are
[2:16:39] pointing to come on church are you with
[2:16:46] me you want to reflect Christ you got to
[2:16:49] be pointed to him you reflect the church
[2:16:52] you're pointed to church you reflect the
[2:16:55] preacher you're pointed at the preacher
[2:16:57] you reflect as it were message overall
[2:17:01] you're pointed to a religious activity
[2:17:08] because you see this message the prophet
[2:17:10] of God said will never become a
[2:17:14] nomination never if we have a
[2:17:19] denominational tendency then that means
[2:17:21] we're looking to a denomination but you
[2:17:24] look to Christ and you're gonna have
[2:17:26] Christ tendencies you're gonna have a
[2:17:28] word hallelujah the word coming to life
[2:17:32] in you Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah my oh
[2:17:39] my how do you one more call oh I get all
[2:17:49] over brother David then I turn around
[2:17:51] and do the same thing
[2:17:57] amen well I have to say when it comes to
[2:18:03] brothers and little brothers they saved
[2:18:04] the best for last and we find today that
[2:18:11] the modern church modern church world
[2:18:13] the modern world Church is also that the
[2:18:17] spiritual church are both pregnant to
[2:18:19] give birth to son so we got we got two
[2:18:21] churches both pregnant
[2:18:23] you're gonna give birth to sons one of
[2:18:26] them a denominational birth is going to
[2:18:28] give one of a day these days at the
[2:18:31] World Council of Churches which will
[2:18:32] produce the world to the world the
[2:18:35] Antichrist through a denomination that's
[2:18:37] exactly the truth I may not live to see
[2:18:39] it I believe I will now look my brother
[2:18:42] and sister this always I'm just going to
[2:18:45] throw this in here so I if I throw any
[2:18:46] bricks out you stumble over them no
[2:18:48] don't worry about it it's intended to I
[2:18:54] may not live to see it I believe I will
[2:18:58] okay let's weigh this out on one hand
[2:19:01] God didn't promise that brother branham
[2:19:03] had to see it a lot of things god never
[2:19:07] promised brother Branham had to be here
[2:19:10] okay are we good with that so he said he
[2:19:14] believed he would see it What did he say
[2:19:17] I believe that the ending or closing
[2:19:20] down of this Gentile dispensation take
[2:19:23] place in 1977 people fell off the cliff
[2:19:26] right and left he prophesied that's all
[2:19:29] it can be you read the words it's a
[2:19:31] prophecy and it didn't happen
[2:19:32] okay brother Brown says well I didn't
[2:19:35] prophesy I'm just chewing this but let's
[2:19:39] get on the other side the scale are you
[2:19:41] with me maybe something happened that
[2:19:46] fulfilled that and we don't have a clue
[2:19:51] but if I didn't see it I can't believe
[2:19:54] it
[2:19:54] well we got scripture for that yeah and
[2:20:00] at this really good conversation with
[2:20:02] the brother one time he looked me in the
[2:20:05] face caught me totally off-guard and he
[2:20:07] said brother Paul you made this little
[2:20:09] statement then he looked me right in the
[2:20:12] eye and said I am now the devil's
[2:20:13] advocate man he looked at me with such
[2:20:16] intensity I was like oh no 1977
[2:20:33] he said prove to me something happened I
[2:20:35] said I can't all I can do is take a
[2:20:38] profits words that he believes something
[2:20:40] would happen 1977 and then you know how
[2:20:44] the Lord will give you inspiration I
[2:20:45] started speaking to him well brother
[2:20:47] Brian said this and this led to this and
[2:20:49] this came here and halfway through the
[2:20:51] conversation it caught me off guard
[2:20:58] proved to me something didn't happen I
[2:21:00] was like wait you can't switch sides he
[2:21:02] said I can do anything I want
[2:21:07] but you see Saints regardless of whether
[2:21:10] something happened or something didn't
[2:21:13] happen that doesn't make the Word of God
[2:21:17] change in one iota if that's what we
[2:21:22] pinned our belief in the message on
[2:21:24] something so small then we're in serious
[2:21:29] trouble your garbage chute is not going
[2:21:33] to work at 500 feet and several
[2:21:36] thousands per square inch of pressure
[2:21:39] hallelujah the garbage will back up sink
[2:21:43] your boat are you with me Alleluia you
[2:21:48] see this isn't what we're looking at
[2:21:50] we're looking at a sure Word of God amen
[2:21:54] that's exactly true so I'm a lot lived I
[2:21:57] believe I will
[2:21:58] but you young people that was me
[2:21:59] remember that you heard a minister say
[2:22:01] that it'll finally wind up and that is
[2:22:03] the mark of the beast when she forms
[2:22:05] that World Council of Churches she'll
[2:22:06] give birth to her son the Antichrist the
[2:22:09] other now we're getting down to us amen
[2:22:12] we're getting down to our subject the
[2:22:14] other is pregnant by the word of God and
[2:22:17] will bring forth the body the finished
[2:22:20] body of Jesus Christ which is the bride
[2:22:25] hallelujah
[2:22:26] the body of Christ isn't finished yet
[2:22:29] how many knows that a man and a woman is
