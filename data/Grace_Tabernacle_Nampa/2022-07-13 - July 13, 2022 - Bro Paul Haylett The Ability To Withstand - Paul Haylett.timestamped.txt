[38:08] evening on the ability to withstand
[38:11] now my brother and sister uh you know
[38:13] the great oak tree
[38:15] amen the reason that oak tree can
[38:18] withstand every storm that has ever come
[38:21] its way is not because it says i am a
[38:24] mighty oak
[38:25] but it has
[38:27] taken the time in its life to sink its
[38:29] roots
[38:31] and the prophet of god shared with us
[38:33] and said it's in those storms of life
[38:36] that's shaking that that loosens the
[38:38] roots which gives them room
[38:41] to press deeper
[38:43] so i say today this evening
[38:47] sometimes we'll look at our circumstance
[38:49] and we say lord why
[38:51] stop and say thank you lord for shaking
[38:54] me
[38:55] that my roots can go deeper
[38:58] amen because my brother and sister
[38:59] there'll be many in this day the word
[39:01] promises that will be shaken loose
[39:05] but god is shaking you and we come to
[39:07] the time we think i'm being shaken like
[39:09] they're being shaken but god's shaking
[39:11] you in a different fashion because he's
[39:13] going to use your present circumstance
[39:17] to cause you to dig deeper
[39:19] you're going to cry out more you're
[39:21] going to get in the word more you're
[39:22] going to say lord i need you more
[39:26] than i did yesterday even then i did
[39:28] this morning
[39:30] and so while we say lord please make the
[39:33] test easy god says i'll give you the
[39:35] test that's necessary
[39:37] not what's easy
[39:39] hallelujah ephesians the sixth chapter
[39:43] just pray the lord would just help me to
[39:46] bring out this thought it's been
[39:47] rattling around in my head for a while
[39:50] amen finally
[39:53] now let's let's stop for a minute i just
[39:55] do a little homework you're familiar
[39:56] with the scripture the scripture is
[39:59] laying out about masters and servants
[40:02] and how to treat each other and what you
[40:04] do in these circumstances and it comes
[40:06] now and finally and says finally my
[40:08] brethren so it's including masters and
[40:11] servants it's not talking to a
[40:13] segregated class but it's talking to
[40:15] each and every one finally my brethren
[40:19] whether you're a master or you're a
[40:21] servant
[40:22] be strong in the lord
[40:24] and in the power of his might put on the
[40:27] whole armor of god that you may be able
[40:29] to stand against the wiles
[40:32] of the devil
[40:34] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[40:36] blood but against principalities against
[40:38] powers against rulers of the darkness of
[40:40] this world
[40:42] now remember
[40:43] when satan
[40:46] was there on the pinnacle
[40:48] of the temple
[40:50] and he told jesus i'll give all of this
[40:53] world to you
[40:54] he was not bluffing
[40:58] god had deposited that into his hand
[41:01] now look what he's doing to people in
[41:03] this day here
[41:04] he's still i hope you catch this
[41:07] offering them
[41:09] the world
[41:12] so he's still using the same tactic the
[41:14] same approach
[41:19] again spiritual wickedness in high
[41:21] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[41:23] armor of god
[41:25] that you may be able to withstand in the
[41:27] evil day and having done all
[41:30] pause
[41:32] to stand
[41:35] stand therefore
[41:38] we're standing tonight saints
[41:40] don't think about quitting don't turn
[41:42] about giving up don't i'm weary i'm
[41:44] struggled i this i that just come take
[41:47] the word of god and he says now that
[41:49] you've come to this place to stand
[41:52] then stand
[41:54] having your loins gert about with truth
[41:57] and having on the breastplate of
[41:58] righteousness and your feet sawed with
[42:01] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[42:05] above all
[42:07] now look at this
[42:10] i think you guys have caught this
[42:12] have you noticed a trend i was busy and
[42:14] i feel bad but i don't have to preach
[42:16] every service in this church
[42:18] brother david
[42:20] in his various topics that he was tying
[42:22] together
[42:24] tied faith in there
[42:26] brother chris comes along here a
[42:28] wednesday ago drives faith home hard and
[42:32] when i had this thought i didn't even
[42:34] make the correlation or it didn't strike
[42:36] me i didn't choose this because it had
[42:38] about faith in it but i even today was
[42:40] sitting there going hey wait just a
[42:42] second
[42:43] this actually fits i'm glad i fit with
[42:45] you guys
[42:48] above all
[42:50] take the shade the shield
[42:53] of faith
[42:56] don't forget your shield oh no i need a
[42:59] shield to block this and to block that
[43:00] you do it's called faith
[43:03] there's the shield it's faith
[43:05] it's not that we can defend ourselves
[43:08] well i can defend my position with the
[43:09] bible i can defend my position with the
[43:12] message
[43:14] why don't you defend your position with
[43:16] faith
[43:18] let faith
[43:19] faith is what has been given to us
[43:22] amen
[43:23] above take the shield of faith wherewith
[43:25] all ye shall be able to quench all the
[43:28] fiery darts of the wicked and take the
[43:30] helmet of salvation and the sword of the
[43:32] spirit which is the word of god heavenly
[43:36] father we ask for your blessings tonight
[43:38] lord open your word to us make it so
[43:41] alive the lord we walk out of here
[43:43] tonight not saying brother paul preached
[43:45] a good sermon but thank you lord that
[43:47] you spoke to me lord i want to hear from
[43:50] you father and i desire for you to speak
[43:52] to the saints in your precious name we
[43:54] ask this
[43:56] amen and amen
[43:58] you may be seated
[44:04] now i want to just drop back a little
[44:06] bit brothers if you'll take me back i
[44:07] guess i can do that here
[44:09] as we'll look at this my brother i want
[44:11] to go back to verse 11.
[44:14] it says put on the whole armor of god
[44:16] that ye may be able to stand against the
[44:19] wiles of the devil now this word may
[44:23] is expressing possibility and just
[44:26] follow along with me if you would
[44:27] tonight this possibility is declaring
[44:31] that you guys may or have this
[44:33] possibility to actually
[44:36] stand against
[44:38] the wiles of the devil
[44:39] now if we were talking about
[44:41] possibilities maybe we would have to put
[44:43] percentages and say well you know 50 of
[44:46] the time i'll feel like a successful
[44:48] christian if 50 percent of the time i
[44:51] can stand against the wiles of the devil
[44:53] and various people some would say no i
[44:55] would be 75 some might be having a bad
[44:58] day and so well for me it's probably 10
[45:00] percent but my brother and sister we
[45:02] want to follow the correlation of the
[45:04] word and then do we we believe the
[45:07] prophet brought clarity to the word
[45:08] right amen he didn't come to change the
[45:10] word as some want to do but he come to
[45:13] bring clarity in the word and so as we
[45:15] look at this that he may amen this is
[45:19] expressing possibility be able in other
[45:22] words i have a possibility of standing
[45:25] against the wiles of the devil but you
[45:27] see god makes possibilities realities
[45:30] he's not just there as brother chris
[45:33] spoke to us the other night says you
[45:35] know if god said it he meant it
[45:37] amen so god isn't saying well you know
[45:39] i'll be happy you know you can make you
[45:41] can play major league baseball and only
[45:44] hit 300. that's one out of three balls
[45:46] my brother and sister i don't want to
[45:48] win just one out of three trials i want
[45:51] to come to a place that i am so into the
[45:54] presence of god so into his word that i
[45:57] can stand up as a soldier of the cross
[45:59] not representing myself but representing
[46:02] him right we don't want to be shoddy we
[46:04] want to express ourselves we want to be
[46:06] able to present ourselves as a godly
[46:08] people and so you know it is there in
[46:11] verse 13 that he tells you that you may
[46:14] be able once again expressing
[46:16] possibility to withstand in the evil day
[46:20] and having all done having
[46:22] done all to stand so it's here again
[46:25] expressing this possibility that you
[46:28] would be able to withstand
[46:30] the evil of our day
[46:32] now i'm telling you as as a man i hope
[46:35] this doesn't come across wrong but as a
[46:37] man i i i have had my own struggles
[46:40] through the years you know
[46:41] something that you know happened in my
[46:44] teens it took me a lot of years 21 years
[46:47] in fact to really be able to kind of
[46:49] overcome and step beyond those things
[46:51] and my brother and sister there was a
[46:53] time in my life that i thought nope this
[46:55] is what it is god's given me a godly
[46:57] wife but i'll never be able to to live
[47:00] this or be able to do this and as a
[47:02] minister as a pastor i've heard many
[47:04] people say brother paul i would serve
[47:06] god but i'm just not able to live it
[47:11] well let me express there's possibility
[47:14] and where there is a chance of life my
[47:16] brother and sister we do not give up we
[47:18] keep pressing amen i had a man ask me
[47:21] one time said well you know we got this
[47:23] certain circumstance i got a wife she's
[47:25] got cancer i don't know what the will of
[47:27] god is i said brother i can answer that
[47:29] for you not because i am smart not
[47:32] because i am some super spiritual guy
[47:34] but the word of god always expresses
[47:36] life so you need to pray for something
[47:39] you pray for life there's a sinner out
[47:41] here you don't say well lord if they
[47:44] could be you claim them in the name of
[47:46] jesus christ because you're claiming
[47:47] life
[47:48] amen and when you come into that
[47:50] atmosphere that your first instinct
[47:54] is not to say oh that's too bad but your
[47:56] first instinct is to say lord as the
[47:58] prophet did to that young lady i believe
[48:00] it's a sermon choosing of a bride that
[48:02] that young lady got up in the service
[48:04] and she walks out and i know brothers
[48:07] have personal testimony sitting there in
[48:09] that service and they walked out that
[48:11] young lady did and and you could tell
[48:13] she was disagreeing with the prophet and
[48:15] he stops and i don't even know if it's
[48:17] actually on tape but he speaks enough
[48:20] that people heard he says i send the
[48:22] holy spirit after that young lady
[48:26] she goes out the door
[48:28] in about 10 minutes or so rough estimate
[48:30] of time
[48:32] she comes back in sits through the rest
[48:34] of the service
[48:36] now i'm telling you my brother and
[48:37] sister if god would send a prophet to
[48:41] express those words
[48:44] then why can't we
[48:46] why can't we send the holy spirit out
[48:49] i've got a son
[48:51] we might say i've got a son or a
[48:52] daughter i've got a husband i've got a
[48:54] wife i've got a brother i've got a
[48:55] sister send the holy spirit after them
[48:59] don't sit back and say whoa unto us i
[49:01] think they're lost but sinned amen but
[49:04] i'm telling you when you start sending
[49:06] the holy ghost you better have yourself
[49:09] presentable your own self because god
[49:11] doesn't like to use vessels that are
[49:13] tarnished
[49:14] so let's get ourselves
[49:16] amen let's get on fire let's get our and
[49:19] start sending the holy ghost now
[49:22] amen
[49:23] because you see my brother and sister
[49:25] i'm going to come and counter dick
[49:26] myself later if you don't mind but you
[49:28] see we should be taking the position
[49:32] of expressing possibility
[49:36] amen
[49:37] all tatted up
[49:40] pierced
[49:45] come on the flesh says no it can't be
[49:46] them
[49:49] let's express possibility
[49:51] lord there's a soul inside that
[49:54] that body there lord it might be
[49:56] tarnished
[49:58] but lord there's a soul in there
[50:00] i'm claiming life for that soul
[50:07] but the devil gets us down sometimes
[50:08] saints we can't even claim life for our
[50:10] own family
[50:12] you would think amongst all that we
[50:14] would want life for our own family
[50:17] but the devil gets us into such a place
[50:21] so we look and
[50:24] my
[50:25] i should have rearranged these notes
[50:26] differently you know that
[50:29] above all taking the shield of faith
[50:31] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[50:35] some
[50:36] of the fiery darts
[50:39] of the wicked
[50:42] can somebody say that really loud
[50:45] oh
[50:47] amen let's not settle for some
[50:49] people say well i've been hurt in church
[50:52] well i'm sorry to hear that but let's
[50:55] get in a position to quench that
[50:58] not to carry that burden for years and
[51:00] years and decades saying i was hurt a
[51:03] bad pastor about a judgmental church or
[51:06] a false doctrines or whatever let's get
[51:08] in a position to quench that once and
[51:11] for all to put that under the blood and
[51:13] just wipe all the power to control our
[51:16] life right out of that
[51:19] because otherwise satan will just keep
[51:21] pouring gasoline on the fiery dart
[51:24] or send another one to strike in the
[51:26] same position
[51:30] not for years my brother and sister of a
[51:32] church carrying on burdens
[51:34] of something that is so bygone so far
[51:37] behind them
[51:39] but still so
[51:40] fresh
[51:43] that as though they lived it yesterday
[51:47] now we're human right i don't make that
[51:49] as an excuse but see we'll say but you
[51:51] don't understand what i went through
[51:54] but you saying you don't understand what
[51:55] you went through is telling you telling
[51:58] me
[51:58] that you don't understand what quenching
[52:00] all the fiery darts is
[52:02] i don't say that judgmental i just say
[52:04] that
[52:05] let's go to the place of quenching the
[52:06] dart
[52:07] and let the past go away and let's look
[52:10] to the mark of the high calling in
[52:11] christ jesus let that become our focus
[52:14] not what happened to me here or what
[52:16] happened to me there but let the mark of
[52:18] the high calling become our focus
[52:21] that nothing else matters but moving
[52:23] forward in jesus christ
[52:26] now paul is speaking to the ephesians
[52:28] and if i could put it this way
[52:31] he gave them kind of you might say a
[52:33] recipe on how to withstand
[52:36] now the word withstand is to be
[52:38] undamaged or unaffected
[52:41] now those of you who went through trials
[52:43] church splits problems and families
[52:46] problems with ministries you would say
[52:48] but this has affected me so deeply
[52:54] let's get out of the carnal realm
[52:56] step into the spiritual
[52:58] god's telling you i'll quench that
[53:01] that you will be unaffected
[53:04] but we got to get out of this flesh my
[53:05] brother and sister to understand what
[53:07] paul was speaking to the ephesians
[53:09] because paul was not concerned about
[53:11] their emotion
[53:13] i read you the quote the other day the
[53:14] prophet of god said i'm not concerned
[53:16] your emotions not my problem
[53:19] so paul's not speaking to their emotion
[53:22] and he's not preach speaking or
[53:24] preaching to their present physical
[53:26] circumstance paul was preaching to the
[53:29] soul
[53:30] he was there to tell them look what i
[53:32] want to do is i want you to be able to
[53:35] withstand all the fiery darts of the
[53:38] enemy and in the spiritual realm my
[53:40] brother and sister is where are where
[53:42] well
[53:43] warfare excuse me
[53:45] our warfare is not physical
[53:48] right it's too spiritual
[53:51] we've covered that it's a spiritual side
[53:54] and you know we say well i'm not
[53:56] undamaged
[53:58] if we were to be honest tonight looking
[54:00] back in church and family and et cetera
[54:03] experience we'd say no i am not
[54:05] undamaged i am damaged in in a sense but
[54:08] i want you to get out of that initial
[54:10] overlapping of the carnal and look at
[54:13] this are you in the same place you was
[54:16] five years ago
[54:19] amen we have moved forward
[54:22] and satan has tried to stop you but if
[54:25] the soul is growing
[54:27] amen if the spirit in you is growing if
[54:30] the spirit has more control of your life
[54:32] today than it did a year ago my brother
[54:36] and sister you're not damaged
[54:38] you're growing but we look at this in
[54:40] the hurt and the pain and satan tries to
[54:43] overlap that and make that the thing
[54:45] that you see but god's trying to uncover
[54:47] that and tell you can't you see you're
[54:50] growing spiritually you're growing
[54:52] spiritually you've got more holy spirit
[54:55] living in you controlling you than you
[54:57] did last year then you did five years or
[55:00] ten years i am with you i am even in you
[55:04] to the end of the world
[55:06] and this work i have begun in you i will
[55:09] finish and god's not going to create you
[55:12] as a limping dragging whatever
[55:15] going through the gates we are
[55:16] overcomers
[55:18] we are the representation or the
[55:20] manifestation of the power of god on the
[55:23] earth today we're not a bunch of
[55:25] spiritual cripples we're not a bunch of
[55:27] people that are just barely getting by
[55:30] we are the bride of christ
[55:32] and he did not clothe us
[55:35] in some defeated spirit
[55:37] he did not clothe us with the spirit of
[55:40] i might make it he has come and declared
[55:44] you're my wife and i have chosen you and
[55:47] i have made the way before you and i
[55:49] made the rough places smooth for you
[55:52] and we say oh life is so hard i just
[55:54] sometimes struggle with the idea that
[55:56] god's made it smooth well imagine what
[55:58] it would be if he wasn't in your life
[56:02] oh my brother and sister some people
[56:04] would be like oh you're just trying to
[56:05] scare us no i'm not i'm just telling you
[56:07] in reality our lives we would be there
[56:09] amongst our midst today without god we
[56:12] would be drunks we'd be street walkers
[56:14] we'd be living in alleys we'd be
[56:16] alcoholics
[56:19] we'd be dialect in the world we live in
[56:25] but he gives this recipe
[56:28] how to be undamaged
[56:30] or unaffected
[56:34] now we would say you know what my life
[56:36] has been altered by this struggle i face
[56:38] and on the surface saints that would be
[56:40] right isn't it
[56:42] we have faced sicknesses
[56:44] heartbreak
[56:47] but let me throw something a little
[56:48] curveball as it were to you
[56:51] your life
[56:52] has not been altered
[56:55] by your struggle
[56:59] because the struggle is what god is
[57:02] using to move you from where your flesh
[57:04] thinks you ought to be
[57:06] to where his word said you will be
[57:10] oh come on we ought to be able to say
[57:12] thank you lord for the struggle i i you
[57:15] know it's a bad analogy to say i'm that
[57:17] little chicken but in the story the
[57:18] prophet of god is talking about how if
[57:20] you try to help that little chicken
[57:22] break out of that shell you'll kill it
[57:24] now look what god's doing my brother and
[57:25] sister it's not an ecumenical move out
[57:28] here it's not some great denomination or
[57:30] some great preacher it's christ himself
[57:33] the holy ghost moving and breaking the
[57:35] shell of your life so that you can come
[57:37] out victorious and glorious to express
[57:40] who you are
[57:42] hallelujah i want to change that story
[57:44] to an eagle
[57:45] hallelujah i'm not a chicken
[57:48] neither are you
[57:50] but you see we think all my life has
[57:52] been changed it's been altered by this
[57:54] struggle no as i want to repeat the
[57:57] reality is the lord is moving us into
[58:00] our correct position
[58:02] now i'm not talking to stubborn people
[58:04] i'm not talking to you i mean i'm
[58:06] talking to stubborn people
[58:11] but the more we hang on
[58:14] are you with me i'm not talking about
[58:15] the hanging on to the word as a son or
[58:16] daughter of god i'm talking about
[58:18] hanging on to opinions and emotions and
[58:20] positions and things that we think
[58:23] and the more we hang on the more
[58:25] pressure god's got to apply to move us
[58:27] oh that he should just go throw our
[58:29] hands up say lord i'm letting go you've
[58:32] got to move me you've got to carry me
[58:33] you've got to make it happen lord i
[58:35] don't need to be crushed to dust
[58:38] i want to just yield to you
[58:40] hallelujah
[58:42] because you see
[58:43] this struggle is just a tool
[58:45] have you ever noticed there's people
[58:47] now maybe you don't deal in this realm
[58:50] but i know brother david for certain
[58:52] will know what i'm talking about i'm not
[58:54] sure if chris has experienced this
[58:56] but you'll find people
[58:58] and they'll talk about why
[59:00] they're not in church they'll talk about
[59:02] why they're not doing this
[59:05] and then they pin it out and they say
[59:06] well i'm not in church because of
[59:07] brother david
[59:10] but did you know the reason they're not
[59:11] in church is because they're actually
[59:12] angry at god
[59:15] this man right here how can a man a
[59:17] minister who gets just a few hours
[59:20] you know all the ministry together only
[59:22] gets a few hours in a week to captivate
[59:25] your time how can they control your life
[59:33] come on
[59:35] and especially seeing how us being a con
[59:37] cult we have such control over you
[59:41] yeah we are the worst managed cult on
[59:44] the face of the earth
[59:46] you guys appear at church but even to
[59:49] them it sounds wrong to start blaming
[59:51] god
[59:52] so they find i know none of you have
[59:54] ever blamed anybody else for something
[59:57] you did
[1:00:02] now multiply that many times over in
[1:00:04] influence of satan trying to get you i
[1:00:07] mean look at the devil he's going to
[1:00:08] rejoice that people are angry at god
[1:00:11] they won't talk to god don't won't
[1:00:13] listen to him the devil's out there i've
[1:00:15] got it figured out if i can get them so
[1:00:18] disappointed so angry so whatever that
[1:00:20] they won't even talk to god won't listen
[1:00:22] to him then i don't even have to i don't
[1:00:24] care how much of the message they have
[1:00:26] on the shelf
[1:00:32] we realize the struggle is just a tool
[1:00:34] that god uses
[1:00:36] and when the bride of christ submitted
[1:00:38] to
[1:00:39] god to the holy spirit
[1:00:42] recognizes
[1:00:45] i didn't look circumspectly
[1:00:48] at that
[1:00:50] i just went out and did this
[1:00:52] and this
[1:00:55] i never even prayed about it
[1:00:57] i didn't even seek the mind of god
[1:01:02] while jackson wouldn't even take a drink
[1:01:04] of water but what he stopped
[1:01:06] and gave thanks to the lord
[1:01:11] i just make that as a point saints
[1:01:16] so our present circumstance we'd say
[1:01:18] well you know i don't know how i got in
[1:01:20] this and you know i feel that way myself
[1:01:22] sometimes saints you know i just like
[1:01:25] you know i i could i could do this and
[1:01:27] this but i made this decision now i have
[1:01:29] an obligation here i must do this to
[1:01:32] keep my own word or take care of it and
[1:01:35] you realize you didn't think it through
[1:01:37] in the beginning and now we have to pay
[1:01:40] a price and if we're not careful that
[1:01:42] price can be a separator or a wedge that
[1:01:45] the devil will use to keep us out of the
[1:01:48] house of god to keep us from a prayer
[1:01:50] life keep us from reading the bible keep
[1:01:52] us from fellowship
[1:01:55] now when you see people start to forsake
[1:01:57] fellowship people say well they're just
[1:01:59] they're just not social my brother and
[1:02:01] sister we are not human in the sense the
[1:02:04] rest of the world is the scripture says
[1:02:07] that we should associate with one
[1:02:09] another that it is fellowship that is
[1:02:12] something that is necessary for us and
[1:02:14] the devil comes and people get the idea
[1:02:17] hey i can i can do this without
[1:02:18] fellowship well i want you to go back
[1:02:21] and take the bible and i want you to
[1:02:22] prove to me that you segregating
[1:02:25] yourself away from fellowship of the
[1:02:27] body is scriptural
[1:02:31] i'm pretty bold to make that challenge
[1:02:33] because it's not there
[1:02:35] there's nothing encouraging that
[1:02:38] to recognize this struggle is just a
[1:02:40] tool god uses
[1:02:41] now look i need to hurry right along
[1:02:43] here
[1:02:44] see where a wrestle is now see we've
[1:02:46] been looking at this whole struggle
[1:02:48] we're talking about struggle and and
[1:02:50] we're looking at this and see where our
[1:02:53] wrestle is today i gotta love this
[1:02:55] english i just love it so much
[1:02:58] see what the death angel is
[1:03:00] it's spiritual power
[1:03:02] wickedness in high places great places
[1:03:05] big places wherefore take unto you the
[1:03:07] whole armor of god that you may be able
[1:03:09] to withstand the evil day i say we're
[1:03:12] there
[1:03:14] i fought years ago that we were in sodom
[1:03:17] my brother and sister i'll tell you how
[1:03:19] naive i was it is so so so much worse
[1:03:23] right now than it was when i was sure we
[1:03:25] were in sodom
[1:03:27] it just eclipses it but look at this now
[1:03:30] the word of god is coming to tell us you
[1:03:32] may be able to withstand the evil day
[1:03:34] and having done all to stand to stand
[1:03:37] stand
[1:03:39] stand therefore having your loins girded
[1:03:41] about you with truth now i'll just hit
[1:03:44] that one because i want to get back to
[1:03:46] my subject see this made me feel good
[1:03:47] brother brown just gets off
[1:03:51] watch him he goes ahead and says the
[1:03:53] breastplate and the helmet and
[1:03:55] everything else wish we could dress that
[1:03:58] soldier up for you here but we haven't
[1:04:00] got the time imagine as it would be that
[1:04:03] we literally spent all the time and
[1:04:06] delved into this and realized what god
[1:04:08] is trying to convey to us what the
[1:04:11] apostle paul is trying to convey it is
[1:04:13] not just a matter of us going okay i'm
[1:04:16] going to try for this but this is a
[1:04:18] matter oh i'm going to spill the beans
[1:04:20] before i get there this is a matter of
[1:04:22] completely dressing ourselves this is
[1:04:26] not i'll just put on a breastplate and
[1:04:28] that ought to be good enough well
[1:04:30] they'll just cut your leg off my brother
[1:04:31] and sister no it's not a matter about
[1:04:33] covering your head and saying my
[1:04:35] knowledge or my understanding is good
[1:04:37] enough it's not a matter of these little
[1:04:39] pieces it takes the
[1:04:41] whole
[1:04:43] armor of god
[1:04:45] let's not settle for intellectual
[1:04:47] conception let's not settle for having
[1:04:50] 90 percent let's not settle for 75 we
[1:04:53] have to put on the whole
[1:04:56] armor of god
[1:04:58] amen
[1:05:00] amen
[1:05:02] brother brown says well we ain't got
[1:05:04] time let's just take the loins
[1:05:08] right
[1:05:09] that's here
[1:05:11] not to be crass but that's where our
[1:05:13] strength and that's where life lies
[1:05:15] is in the loins
[1:05:21] girded about with a girdle
[1:05:23] that's the belt that holds the rest of
[1:05:26] it amen all together
[1:05:29] you realize if we do not have the life
[1:05:31] of christ we can have all kinds of head
[1:05:34] knowledge we can do everything just
[1:05:36] right we can say the right things we can
[1:05:39] think the right things but if we haven't
[1:05:41] protected the life of christ which is
[1:05:44] the strength of the believer then we
[1:05:47] have not done anything amen so it's
[1:05:50] there gerd your loins what we're girding
[1:05:53] it with not intellectualism not with
[1:05:55] popularities or these kind of things but
[1:05:58] gird your loins with truth in the day
[1:06:00] brother when there's all kinds of isms
[1:06:02] and fanaticism
[1:06:04] it's time to gird yourself with the
[1:06:06] truth
[1:06:08] oh look at this i don't mean to be too
[1:06:10] bold tonight but we're coming that we're
[1:06:12] not much different saints than the rest
[1:06:15] of the religious world we've got all
[1:06:17] kinds of isms and schisms we've got all
[1:06:19] kinds of voices saying if you're not
[1:06:21] following our way you won't have eternal
[1:06:24] life well i'll tell you what i'll do my
[1:06:26] brother and sister i'm going to come and
[1:06:28] i'm a little ahead of myself but i'm
[1:06:30] going to stick with it is written i'm
[1:06:32] going to stick with what god put down
[1:06:34] and said this is what you need this will
[1:06:37] do it this will get you through the
[1:06:39] battle this will get you into victory
[1:06:41] this will get you into the kingdom this
[1:06:43] will do it so i don't need a man that
[1:06:45] needs my money i don't need a man that
[1:06:47] needs my accolades i don't need a man
[1:06:49] that's trying to boost me up i need the
[1:06:52] word
[1:06:53] i need truth
[1:06:55] and when i've got truth what is it when
[1:06:58] my loins are girded with truth i can go
[1:07:01] forth and i can declare on my worst day
[1:07:04] i am victorious
[1:07:06] i can declare on my worst day i have
[1:07:08] withstood the devil i have withstood the
[1:07:11] enemy and the work that god began in me
[1:07:14] he promised he would finish it and the
[1:07:16] devil's not going to convince me any
[1:07:18] different
[1:07:19] because he spends a lot of time does he
[1:07:21] not
[1:07:22] convincing us
[1:07:23] or trying to
[1:07:26] so there's all kinds of isms and
[1:07:27] fanaticism it's time
[1:07:30] and i want to just say saints tonight
[1:07:32] not judging anyone i don't mean it that
[1:07:34] way
[1:07:35] but it is time
[1:07:36] for us to gird ourselves
[1:07:39] with
[1:07:40] truth not little somethings
[1:07:43] they're hanging on the edge and we kind
[1:07:45] of brush them aside because we've we've
[1:07:47] decided
[1:07:49] or maybe someone decided for us
[1:07:52] that happens you know
[1:07:56] that's not important
[1:07:59] don't worry about it it doesn't apply to
[1:08:01] you
[1:08:06] if it is written
[1:08:08] it applies
[1:08:14] it's time to gird yourself with the
[1:08:15] truth hallelujah jesus said
[1:08:17] i am the truth
[1:08:20] i love that hallelujah amen now look
[1:08:23] i tell you when people say what about
[1:08:24] this and what about that it's good to
[1:08:26] see the old truth
[1:08:30] hallelujah i know this kind of seems
[1:08:32] silly but it's just good to see
[1:08:35] that old truth
[1:08:37] around us
[1:08:39] you've all seen that little picture you
[1:08:41] know that shows the bride and she's
[1:08:42] wrapped in the word and it's all
[1:08:44] trailing around her what she didn't just
[1:08:46] throw on uh what what they call that
[1:08:48] a veil she didn't throw on a veil that's
[1:08:50] the word
[1:08:52] right
[1:08:54] she just didn't you know
[1:08:55] i don't know i'll get myself in trouble
[1:08:57] here
[1:08:58] i haven't ate my shoe in a while so
[1:09:00] maybe tonight's just good a night to
[1:09:02] shoot eat some shoe leather
[1:09:04] but you know she didn't just gird
[1:09:06] herself with the undergarment
[1:09:08] of truth
[1:09:10] you know what the undergarment of truth
[1:09:12] is
[1:09:13] the secret believer
[1:09:15] the one would never know that they
[1:09:17] really believed
[1:09:19] because all you see on the outside
[1:09:21] testifies of something different
[1:09:26] but i'll cut through all of this for the
[1:09:28] sake of time she's the one
[1:09:30] that started pardon me it's referenced
[1:09:32] to a sister but she's the one who her
[1:09:34] undergarments are truth
[1:09:36] her outer garments are truth her veil is
[1:09:40] truth
[1:09:41] amen she walks in truth she talks in
[1:09:44] truth she lives in truth and she
[1:09:46] expresses or manifests truth
[1:09:48] that's one that has been girded
[1:09:51] with truth
[1:09:53] amen she's not a sunday christian she's
[1:09:55] not a wednesday christian she is a
[1:09:58] christian seven days a week 24 hours a
[1:10:01] day
[1:10:02] amen that's what the king saw in esther
[1:10:06] that's why he loved her she was real
[1:10:09] she wasn't some fake or an imitation she
[1:10:11] was a real thing
[1:10:13] amen
[1:10:15] there stand there let them say well you
[1:10:17] have this that or the other you know
[1:10:19] where you're standing can someone say
[1:10:21] amen to that we know where we're
[1:10:23] standing tonight we're not waiting for
[1:10:25] the next excuse to hit the message to
[1:10:28] walk away we're here because we are
[1:10:31] going to withstand every buffeting every
[1:10:34] wind of false doctrine and everything
[1:10:36] that comes we're going to live through
[1:10:38] that because we read the word and we
[1:10:41] said he's talking about me
[1:10:43] he's not talking about someone else the
[1:10:45] pastor the pastor's wife this person
[1:10:48] that person is talking about me and i
[1:10:50] might be the lowest and the most lowly
[1:10:52] of all that he's talking about me
[1:10:56] hallelujah because i have buckled the
[1:10:59] whole armor on and gird around and
[1:11:01] buckled down good and tight and pulled
[1:11:04] down with the truth of god's word
[1:11:07] anchored
[1:11:08] i'm going to change this
[1:11:10] not in tents out there
[1:11:14] anchored in my hallelujah
[1:11:16] if the pastor don't go in the rapture
[1:11:19] i'm going
[1:11:20] song leader don't go i'm going elders of
[1:11:23] the church don't go i'm going
[1:11:26] there's nothing going to detour me
[1:11:28] nothing's going to stop me i'm going
[1:11:32] come for me lord jesus come quickly
[1:11:35] look that little girl that was there
[1:11:37] with the armored meat packers and all
[1:11:39] them daughters and whatever it was she
[1:11:41] didn't go out there and say now if you
[1:11:43] guys want to take my place
[1:11:46] no sir
[1:11:47] somebody thought brother trevor she
[1:11:49] wasn't very spiritual because when that
[1:11:51] wagon started coming some of them other
[1:11:54] girls might have said well i'll just
[1:11:55] step in there kind of flounce my way up
[1:11:57] and catch his attention what did she do
[1:12:00] she had that suitcase she had her
[1:12:02] wedding garment on and she said he's not
[1:12:05] coming for you i am prepared i have the
[1:12:08] wedding garment i have all that he asked
[1:12:11] me to do and you
[1:12:13] get
[1:12:14] out of my way because this has come for
[1:12:17] me this is my rapture
[1:12:20] this is my calling away
[1:12:22] this is my fulfilling of the word for
[1:12:25] the hour i am the one that god called to
[1:12:28] be the bride to take the rapture it's
[1:12:31] not this worldly daughter it's not this
[1:12:34] worldly niece or cousin i'm the one that
[1:12:37] he spoke the words to i'm the one that
[1:12:39] he met out on the backside of the
[1:12:41] building separated from the spirit of
[1:12:44] the world in the quietness and said i
[1:12:47] like you amen i love you oh how could
[1:12:51] god love me i'm such a rat and i am oh
[1:12:55] i'm just a dish girl but god said i see
[1:12:58] your character i see your nature i see
[1:13:00] your desire and i knew you before the
[1:13:03] foundation of the world you're mine
[1:13:06] oh hallelujah
[1:13:09] oh my you're right brother david that's
[1:13:11] the seventh seal
[1:13:13] look at that
[1:13:15] pulled down with the truth of god's word
[1:13:17] anchored anchored saints
[1:13:20] anchor
[1:13:22] now that's not some chunk of metal you
[1:13:24] threw in the water
[1:13:25] and then the boat just keeps blowing
[1:13:27] with the wind that's not an anchor
[1:13:30] definitively on the deck of the boat you
[1:13:31] could call it an anchor
[1:13:33] but an anchor is something
[1:13:35] that hooked into something that's right
[1:13:37] and then
[1:13:39] it holds
[1:13:41] in the time of the storm
[1:13:44] people say well i'm i'm anchored i'm
[1:13:46] anchored in my church i'm anchored in
[1:13:48] this i'm anchored that they're blown
[1:13:49] that way and they're blown that way and
[1:13:51] you have to just stop and say what what
[1:13:55] i don't understand
[1:14:02] i'm still working on this part right
[1:14:03] after paragraph 96
[1:14:06] hope you all don't mind if i make that
[1:14:08] confession
[1:14:19] and i see a storm cloud come over the
[1:14:21] mountains
[1:14:26] i stop and i say lord please
[1:14:29] please lord
[1:14:32] i've done this so many times saints
[1:14:33] you'd probably think oh my goodness
[1:14:34] brother paul why would you confess this
[1:14:36] in public because i believe the word
[1:14:38] amen
[1:14:39] it says it's good for my soul i've
[1:14:42] stopped in the corner of a hayfield so
[1:14:44] many times and said lord please let this
[1:14:45] storm pass
[1:14:47] then i felt selfish because it would be
[1:14:48] somebody else's hay field
[1:14:52] and to watch the storm go way out there
[1:14:54] and say thank you lord
[1:14:56] to see it turn around
[1:14:59] amen and come right back
[1:15:01] and then as i'm sitting there in a
[1:15:03] tractor
[1:15:04] watching sheets of water run off of the
[1:15:07] tractor
[1:15:09] and i'm like why lord
[1:15:12] why
[1:15:16] and then the prophet of god says
[1:15:19] everything god does
[1:15:22] are you with me
[1:15:24] everything
[1:15:27] what is outside of everything
[1:15:30] everything god does
[1:15:33] is for your edification amen
[1:15:38] lord i guess we needed rain
[1:15:41] in my flesh i feel huh
[1:15:43] and i think we call them ten thousand
[1:15:45] dollar rainstorms
[1:15:46] because many times that's exactly what
[1:15:48] it costs us
[1:15:51] but he's never left his children
[1:15:53] begging bread
[1:15:58] oh what about this and what about that
[1:16:01] i've never had to beg for bread god is
[1:16:04] in control saints
[1:16:06] and you come to the time you have to
[1:16:08] decide i will trust him or i won't
[1:16:10] because i can't straddle the fence i've
[1:16:12] got to trust you lord because i can't
[1:16:15] disbelieve you i can't walk away from
[1:16:17] what you have done for me i have to
[1:16:20] trust you
[1:16:23] yeah all the devils in hell can't upset
[1:16:26] you and that's really in a spiritual
[1:16:27] connotation that's right now look at
[1:16:30] this this is what got me really excited
[1:16:33] you can meet satan
[1:16:35] and say
[1:16:38] it is written
[1:16:41] i am a child of god
[1:16:43] i have been called
[1:16:45] i have been sanctified i've been filled
[1:16:47] with the holy ghost i stand here on the

[1:17:41] written amen amen amen no we get on the
[1:17:45] pinnacle of our temple and we start to
[1:17:47] explain ourselves well i this and i that
[1:17:50] and i felt like this um and i you know
[1:17:52] this and they said this and the preacher
[1:17:55] preached that and yeah how about we just
[1:17:57] back up and say you know what my lord
[1:17:59] jesus christ
[1:18:00] my bridegroom
[1:18:02] told me it is written
[1:18:05] amen it is written i recorded it in the
[1:18:08] heavens i recorded it in the earth i
[1:18:10] recorded it in my written word you're
[1:18:13] the one you're my bride you're the
[1:18:16] chosen you're the one out of all that i
[1:18:19] picked

[1:18:21] your name is in the book somebody ought
[1:18:23] to be able to rejoice my name is in the
[1:18:26] book it is written
[1:18:29] oh hallelujah well how do you know your
[1:18:31] name is in the book i can't really
[1:18:33] explain it to you but there's something
[1:18:36] down inside of me that i know that i
[1:18:39] know that i know my name is in that book
[1:18:43] and he called me he wrote it in his
[1:18:45] blood and i'm not going to doubt him
[1:18:48] amen
[1:18:49] amen
[1:18:51] hallelujah oh is it all right to be
[1:18:54] excited
[1:18:55] amen
[1:18:56] now look here and a greater than solomon
[1:18:59] is here now
[1:19:00] brother branham is referring to the
[1:19:02] little
[1:19:03] syrophoenician woman
[1:19:06] and he's talking about her circumstance
[1:19:08] and i want to take tonight and just kind
[1:19:11] of overlay or interface this of our
[1:19:14] circumstance
[1:19:17] most of you tonight have a circumstance
[1:19:18] don't you
[1:19:20] you're not living if you don't
[1:19:22] somebody check their pulse
[1:19:25] because every one of us that's living
[1:19:26] has a circumstance something is going on
[1:19:32] either with us or those around us
[1:19:34] in our world
[1:19:36] hallelujah
[1:19:38] and you realize that the devil has a
[1:19:40] voice in every circumstance
[1:19:43] he does not set mute
[1:19:46] my brother and sister you can even have
[1:19:48] this is an interesting testimony that
[1:19:50] was shared because god knows the faith
[1:19:53] that really resides in the heart and
[1:19:54] soul
[1:19:56] i believe it was a sister
[1:19:58] going through a prayer line
[1:20:01] and even as she's coming up
[1:20:03] to have holy ghost-filled godly men pray
[1:20:06] for her
[1:20:07] the devil's telling her
[1:20:09] going
[1:20:11] echoing in her head
[1:20:13] this
[1:20:14] is not for you
[1:20:17] you imagine
[1:20:18] you'd be thinking the lord's not going
[1:20:19] to touch me i'm i'm thinking all these
[1:20:21] negative thoughts this is not for me
[1:20:25] but down in the soul
[1:20:29] right
[1:20:30] brother trevor
[1:20:33] in the fleshly
[1:20:35] table of the heart
[1:20:37] not the stony table
[1:20:39] the mind
[1:20:41] is saying
[1:20:42] it's not for you
[1:20:44] but something had already been written
[1:20:46] on the heart
[1:20:48] god had already before a foundation
[1:20:51] written down in that heart this word is
[1:20:55] for you
[1:20:57] and she's up there with these thoughts
[1:20:59] coming in a prayer line it's not for me
[1:21:01] it's not for me she goes over there
[1:21:03] she's there it's all she could do her
[1:21:05] testimony was just to bow her head
[1:21:06] because she almost felt like crying out
[1:21:08] this is not for me but the brothers laid
[1:21:10] hands on her and as i spoke to you here
[1:21:12] recently how we are in such a turmoil
[1:21:15] and we can come to church and our
[1:21:17] thoughts are scattered and we don't even
[1:21:19] know if we're saved maybe we fought with
[1:21:21] a family or something on the way to
[1:21:22] church and you walk in the door and you
[1:21:24] almost feel like a hypocrite because you
[1:21:26] find yourself in the first or second
[1:21:28] song hands lifted
[1:21:30] worshipping the lord and the devil's
[1:21:32] like you hypocrite
[1:21:35] but we came in the presence
[1:21:37] of the prince
[1:21:38] of peace
[1:21:40] and that just flows over us and all of
[1:21:43] the devil's voice and all his accusation
[1:21:46] all of his crying out saying oh there's
[1:21:49] no one there's no one can help you in
[1:21:52] your circumstance the doctor can't do
[1:21:54] nothing for you and this and this and
[1:21:56] this and this and this and it's there my
[1:21:59] brother and sister and then we come into
[1:22:01] the presence can someone say hallelujah
[1:22:03] we come in the presence of the prince of
[1:22:05] peace and it all changes and in our
[1:22:08] flesh we almost feel i'm a hypocrite
[1:22:11] i don't know but you see what it is is
[1:22:14] the bombarding
[1:22:16] of the spirit of the day amen and god
[1:22:18] says i'm not worried even about the
[1:22:20] thoughts right the prophet of god says
[1:22:21] you know don't let the bird build the
[1:22:23] nest but the thoughts are still going to
[1:22:25] ping off of you and it is they don't
[1:22:27] just ping off of you one a day they
[1:22:29] praying off of you one a second or
[1:22:31] whatever it might be but the prince of
[1:22:33] peace comes and says don't worry about
[1:22:35] it i wrote it on your soul i wrote it in
[1:22:37] your heart and it will last it will take
[1:22:40] you through this storm
[1:22:42] oh my
[1:22:44] amen
[1:22:45] there's always boy i would sure turn
[1:22:47] that first sentence into a long one
[1:22:48] didn't i amen
[1:22:51] look there's always difficulties in the
[1:22:53] way satan throws everything
[1:22:56] everything in the way he can
[1:22:59] when he sees
[1:23:01] you trying to get religious
[1:23:04] when he sees you just quoting scripture
[1:23:06] quoting quotes
[1:23:07] no sir he said when he sees a real move
[1:23:12] of god
[1:23:15] come on saints we've walked out of this
[1:23:17] church
[1:23:18] i can assure you you're not much
[1:23:19] different than me
[1:23:21] we felt the presence of god moving here
[1:23:24] you walk out of church and before you
[1:23:26] get home to your dinner table
[1:23:28] these spirits
[1:23:34] satan attacking you because you're
[1:23:36] defeated
[1:23:38] that would be a really dumb army to
[1:23:40] attack an army that's already defeated
[1:23:43] amen so look what the prophet saying
[1:23:45] when he sees a real move of god get
[1:23:48] started he'll do it to you he'll put
[1:23:51] everything all the hindrances he can in
[1:23:54] your way remember the woman talking
[1:23:56] about the syrophoenician woman had oh i
[1:23:59] love this those of you the read ahead
[1:24:01] you're naughty but look at this look at
[1:24:03] this remember the woman
[1:24:05] had a lot of hindrance
[1:24:07] but her faith oh hallelujah her faith
[1:24:11] didn't have any hindrance that's why we
[1:24:14] got to separate ourselves it sounds like
[1:24:16] we're double-minded it sounds like we're
[1:24:18] some kind of confused people but my
[1:24:20] flesh says there's hindrances but the
[1:24:22] soul inside me says christ in me there
[1:24:26] is no hindrance
[1:24:28] amen
[1:24:30] but her faith didn't have any
[1:24:33] faith
[1:24:35] has no hindrance
[1:24:37] there is nothing going to stop it no
[1:24:40] matter what anybody says if you've got
[1:24:42] that right hold on god
[1:24:46] amen when i read this i had to read it
[1:24:48] again i had to read it again to make
[1:24:50] sure i was really reading it
[1:24:52] when you've got that hold on god wait
[1:24:54] god did i i didn't call god god called
[1:24:56] me
[1:24:58] but you see there's an element that god
[1:25:00] placed down in you
[1:25:04] why didn't the woman at the well tell
[1:25:06] them to go mind your business
[1:25:10] pardon me for being so bold but why
[1:25:12] didn't rahab just go ahead and turn on
[1:25:14] the light
[1:25:17] because they couldn't
[1:25:20] because they couldn't saints
[1:25:22] they couldn't quit they couldn't walk
[1:25:24] away they couldn't deny what had been
[1:25:26] brought to life in them it was unable to
[1:25:30] turn their back on that right oh and we
[1:25:33] were talking about that brother terry
[1:25:35] and i amen is there right in the lineage
[1:25:38] of jesus christ god didn't choose the
[1:25:41] perfect purity whatever god chose those
[1:25:44] to prove that his blood is more than
[1:25:46] sufficient hallelujah
[1:25:49] amen nothing going to stop her no matter
[1:25:52] what anybody says if you've got that
[1:25:54] right hold on god and god has got the
[1:25:57] right hold on you
[1:25:59] there can be 40 doctors standing here
[1:26:01] telling you he was dying
[1:26:06] telling you you was dying and you
[1:26:09] wouldn't believe one word of it no sir
[1:26:12] no sir because there's something inside
[1:26:16] of you that has already declared he is
[1:26:19] my healer and i received him the person
[1:26:22] of jesus christ
[1:26:24] and what he has said i believe and i
[1:26:27] believe that it will be oh can someone
[1:26:29] say i believe it will be
[1:26:31] amen we're not here just guessing we're
[1:26:34] not here hoping we are here with a
[1:26:37] steadfast confidence that what god said
[1:26:40] he meant for me
[1:26:42] amen there could be 40 clergymen
[1:26:44] standing here like ahab's 400 withstand
[1:26:48] if you're a machaya and you've got a
[1:26:50] hold of god and god has got a hold of
[1:26:52] you and you see it vindicated in the
[1:26:55] word
[1:26:57] come on what is it it's written
[1:27:00] it's written saints everything i need to
[1:27:04] make the rapture the prophet said is
[1:27:06] already in me is that me with an
[1:27:09] intellectual understanding of the
[1:27:10] message no
[1:27:12] it is a living word written in the very
[1:27:16] depths of my soul upon the table of my
[1:27:18] heart this word is true and this word is
[1:27:22] who i am
[1:27:25] i'm sorry i'm just a little excited
[1:27:26] tonight
[1:27:27] hallelujah
[1:27:30] my cane got a hold of god and god's got
[1:27:32] a hold of you you see it vindicated in
[1:27:34] the word
[1:27:36] that's why there's people like we just
[1:27:37] don't understand i mean the message is
[1:27:39] so
[1:27:40] outdated
[1:27:46] excuse me a minute i just had
[1:27:49] a flash i should look for an expiration
[1:27:51] date
[1:27:54] right brother branham's answer to the
[1:27:56] man that said the
[1:27:57] apostolic age is over brother brown says
[1:28:00] i can show you where god put it in
[1:28:03] can you show me
[1:28:04] where he took it out right
[1:28:06] no expiration date
[1:28:08] hallelujah this living word has been
[1:28:10] written on the table of my heart on the
[1:28:12] table of your heart and there is no
[1:28:15] expiration there is no exceptions and as
[1:28:18] i have spoke to you often enough there
[1:28:20] is no but amen right that negates
[1:28:23] everything in front of it
[1:28:24] god's got to hold to you you see it
[1:28:26] vindicated in the word there's nothing
[1:28:28] going to stop you you're going to stand
[1:28:30] there anyhow because something has got a
[1:28:33] hold of you
[1:28:35] oh hallelujah isn't that beautiful
[1:28:38] oh my oh my
[1:28:41] i i love that
[1:28:43] i'll just want to go back to that
[1:28:44] portion right there the more remember
[1:28:46] the woman had a lot of hindrance
[1:28:48] we could be bold tonight couldn't we
[1:28:51] we're not too we're not too high and
[1:28:52] mighty to lift a hand and say i've got a
[1:28:54] lot of hindrances
[1:28:57] but the faith amen this is why you've
[1:28:59] got to separate your flesh from your
[1:29:01] faith
[1:29:03] as long as your flesh is controlling
[1:29:05] your faith then your faith can never be
[1:29:07] activated
[1:29:09] but when you'll separate your flesh from
[1:29:11] the faith that's not saying two souls in
[1:29:13] any of this other nonsense that is you
[1:29:15] recognizing that god didn't come to
[1:29:18] redeem this vessel here he put inside of
[1:29:21] you a rapturing faith that will put you
[1:29:24] to meet your theophany and stand in his
[1:29:26] presence on that day
[1:29:28] oh hallelujah
[1:29:30] hallelujah
[1:29:32] her faith didn't have any because faith
[1:29:34] has no hindrance
[1:29:36] now look
[1:29:38] i already touched on this got all
[1:29:40] excited earlier going back to ephesians
[1:29:42] 6 verse 14.
[1:29:45] it says stand there for having your
[1:29:47] loins bout with truth
[1:29:49] my brother and sister i believe this
[1:29:51] right here even though brother branham
[1:29:53] doesn't bring it out in quite this
[1:29:54] fashion i believe this right here is
[1:29:57] part of the foundational uh move that
[1:30:00] god had
[1:30:01] of why we see all the way through his
[1:30:04] ministry
[1:30:05] and i would pray all the way through our
[1:30:07] ministry
[1:30:08] is it's always
[1:30:09] truth
[1:30:10] go back
[1:30:11] to truth amen
[1:30:13] you know how much more comfortable we
[1:30:15] would feel
[1:30:17] if we just fudged it just
[1:30:20] a little
[1:30:21] bit
[1:30:23] come on
[1:30:25] we could fill grace up
[1:30:26] have to build us a new church
[1:30:29] we could have all kinds of programs
[1:30:31] we might even be able to buy you
[1:30:36] choir gowns
[1:30:44] we might be able to publish a newsletter
[1:30:47] with your picture in it
[1:30:53] but we wouldn't have truth
[1:30:56] and the truth is more precious
[1:30:58] than even our very life
[1:31:03] that's why a prophet come back
[1:31:06] in the simplicity of the message
[1:31:08] and said take you back to the word
[1:31:10] back to the word
[1:31:12] back to the word and people are like
[1:31:14] such a boring topic that's right because
[1:31:18] the word is not in you you are not
[1:31:20] girded
[1:31:22] in the word
[1:31:23] because when you're girded in the word
[1:31:26] now i was going to use analogy that most
[1:31:28] sisters would never come to church and
[1:31:31] the first word somebody say oh nice no
[1:31:34] it's a rag
[1:31:35] i'm just wearing a rag to church today
[1:31:39] no sir i haven't beat up on sister jerry
[1:31:42] in quite a while
[1:31:44] but you know
[1:31:46] the other day
[1:31:47] she wore a dress to church i thought was
[1:31:49] quite charming
[1:31:52] and
[1:31:53] i had a couple other minor
[1:31:56] criticisms
[1:31:59] she gets in the car on the way home from
[1:32:01] church
[1:32:03] sister so-and-so and sister so-and-so
[1:32:04] complimented my dress
[1:32:08] she didn't really care what i thought
[1:32:12] sisters you don't know how much sway
[1:32:14] that you have
[1:32:16] more than i do of course
[1:32:18] but you see the devil's trying to tell
[1:32:20] you
[1:32:21] this message
[1:32:22] you don't have to dress this way
[1:32:25] you don't have to live this way you
[1:32:27] don't have to be that
[1:32:29] you can be this
[1:32:31] but then there's one that comes
[1:32:34] and says you are beautiful today
[1:32:36] you're my beloved you're my bride
[1:32:39] i'm so happy
[1:32:42] that's the voice
[1:32:43] that matters
[1:32:44] to us
[1:32:47] now i'm not saying that my voice don't
[1:32:48] matter to my wife that didn't come out
[1:32:50] quite right
[1:32:51] but you see
[1:32:53] we have to
[1:32:54] have our loin skirt about with truth
[1:32:58] and we have to have on this breastplate
[1:33:01] of righteousness
[1:33:02] amen there's no way
[1:33:04] we have to come then
[1:33:06] and walk
[1:33:09] see look at this the reason your feet
[1:33:11] have to be shod with the preparation of
[1:33:13] the gospel of peace is that's the way
[1:33:16] you have to walk
[1:33:18] we can't walk in bitterness and anger
[1:33:21] frustration and all of these other
[1:33:23] spirits of the day
[1:33:25] oh i said oh that i'm sorry i was sister
[1:33:27] april was telling me that in atlanta
[1:33:30] can't even walk down the sidewalk and
[1:33:31] look at people and they're angry you
[1:33:33] looked at me
[1:33:35] be like
[1:33:37] okay
[1:33:43] no
[1:33:43] you see because there
[1:33:46] but we're here
[1:33:48] oh let the world look at us
[1:33:50] not who we are in the flesh but look who
[1:33:53] we are in jesus christ let them look we
[1:33:55] ought to say look at me
[1:33:57] look at me and i'm not boasting i'm
[1:33:59] boasting on my lord jesus he changed me
[1:34:01] from a drunk he changed me from this he
[1:34:03] changed me from that took me from a
[1:34:05] street put me in the middle of his word
[1:34:07] he took me out of this place put me
[1:34:09] right here i can walk in righteousness i
[1:34:12] can have my feet shod in this
[1:34:14] preparation of the gospel
[1:34:16] oh my brother and sister we ought to be
[1:34:18] able to say tonight thank you lord for
[1:34:20] what you're doing thank you lord for all
[1:34:23] that you've done for us
[1:34:25] now can i just read just a little
[1:34:26] further we're kind at the time i said i
[1:34:28] was going to close but please
[1:34:31] please
[1:34:32] amen
[1:34:33] let's go right down here
[1:34:35] see there's a reason my brother and
[1:34:37] sister
[1:34:39] there's a reason i kind of jumped away
[1:34:41] from that quicker because i just decided
[1:34:42] i need to reiterate that my brother and
[1:34:44] sister we need to come to a place that
[1:34:47] you quiet the voice of the devil
[1:34:49] you've got to quiet that voice because
[1:34:52] the word said that you would have christ
[1:34:55] and that would quench all
[1:34:58] and somebody say it with me again all
[1:35:01] the fiery darts of the enemy
[1:35:05] amen we don't have to live a life
[1:35:07] tormented we don't have to live a life
[1:35:09] of defeat we don't have to live a life
[1:35:11] of unfulfilled expectation as christian
[1:35:15] because we have a word that if we will
[1:35:17] apply it we'll quench that dart it will
[1:35:20] snuff the life right out of satan's
[1:35:22] voice it will snuff every accusation and
[1:35:26] everything that he would try to afflict
[1:35:28] you it will snuff it
[1:35:30] because we'll stand on the word and we
[1:35:32] will confess it and maybe we should just
[1:35:34] stand in our closet or wherever there is
[1:35:37] that you would find a quiet place and
[1:35:39] start repeating this scripture to
[1:35:41] yourself that it will quench all the
[1:35:44] fiery darts until you believe it amen
[1:35:49] come on
[1:35:53] kind of a little story a little joke of
[1:35:54] a preacher once
[1:35:56] challenged his church he says maybe you
[1:35:59] shouldn't even come back to church until
[1:36:00] you guys can believe all the word of god
[1:36:03] and next sunday there was nobody there
[1:36:06] because the people actually acknowledged
[1:36:09] they had a void
[1:36:11] but where does the word say we deal with
[1:36:14] the void
[1:36:16] in the house of god
[1:36:18] not in our basement
[1:36:20] not in our boohoo
[1:36:22] in the house of god
[1:36:24] amen now look at this
[1:36:26] exposition seven church ages revelation
[1:36:28] you guys know this quote probably know
[1:36:30] it could many of you could quote it
[1:36:31] right off let me show you another reason
[1:36:34] why satan hates this book of revelation
[1:36:36] of jesus christ in the church
[1:36:38] he knows that jesus christ is the same
[1:36:40] yesterday today and forever and he
[1:36:43] changes not he knows that a whole lot
[1:36:45] more than do 90 of the theologians he
[1:36:48] knows that since god is immutable in his
[1:36:51] nature then he is just as immutable in
[1:36:53] his ways i hope you're catching this
[1:36:56] amen because god's not going to come
[1:36:58] along and change his mind midstream
[1:37:02] but i this and i that and i'm no the
[1:37:05] prophet of god said don't don't speak
[1:37:07] those negative things don't talk the
[1:37:09] devil's language
[1:37:10] don't do that
[1:37:14] thus satan knows assuredly that the
[1:37:16] original church at pentecost with the
[1:37:18] power of god mark 16 in action
[1:37:21] is the true church
[1:37:23] people say how do you know the message
[1:37:24] is true
[1:37:26] well by god's grace
[1:37:27] see what they expect you to do
[1:37:30] is to say well
[1:37:32] in this sermon
[1:37:34] and in this work sermon this quote that
[1:37:39] but you see what god has done to the
[1:37:41] true bride of christ he took you back
[1:37:44] to the book
[1:37:46] and said i want you to go
[1:37:49] and prove every thing this is actually
[1:37:52] brother brown's words
[1:37:54] i want you to prove
[1:37:56] everything
[1:37:58] by the bible
[1:38:01] well hallelujah i have confidence in
[1:38:02] that amen
[1:38:07] satan knows assuredly that the original
[1:38:11] so that's the true church
[1:38:13] that jesus claims is his own all else is
[1:38:16] false it has to be now remember this
[1:38:18] christ
[1:38:20] i just love this because i'm just
[1:38:21] arrogant
[1:38:23] i'm just arrogant enough to
[1:38:26] he was talking about me i'm sorry
[1:38:28] i don't know any of you feel that way
[1:38:30] you don't have to have arrogant but
[1:38:32] that's what the the distractors want to
[1:38:33] call you you're arrogant to think you
[1:38:36] are the bride of christ no i just read
[1:38:38] the book
[1:38:39] and the book spoke
[1:38:41] and the book told me you are my own
[1:38:44] you're my child you're my bride the book
[1:38:47] spoke not me speaking the book spoke
[1:38:52] amen
[1:38:54] all else is false it has to be now
[1:38:56] remember this christ in the true church
[1:38:58] is a continuation of the book of acts i
[1:39:01] think that's one of the reasons why i
[1:39:02] love that song a new testament church
[1:39:04] rising up it's not a new testament
[1:39:07] church imitating it's the real thing
[1:39:10] hallelujah but the book of revelation
[1:39:13] shows how that the antichrist spirit
[1:39:14] would come into the church and defile it
[1:39:17] making it lukewarm formal powerless
[1:39:20] oh can i just be bold enough to say
[1:39:22] tonight just as long as god would give
[1:39:24] me voice and i could stand in the
[1:39:26] position of your pastor we will defeat
[1:39:29] the spirit of lukewarm laodicea we won't
[1:39:33] compromise with it we won't lower the
[1:39:35] standard to fill the church up in fact
[1:39:37] i'm kind of feeling like we ought to
[1:39:39] maybe raise a standard one more notch
[1:39:42] amen and move to the mark of the high
[1:39:44] calling
[1:39:45] amen it's a real challenger my brother
[1:39:48] and sister that presses into it it's not
[1:39:51] the one that says hey can you guys lower
[1:39:53] that that's not the one you want to be
[1:39:55] on the same team amen can you just lower
[1:39:58] the qualifications so that i can kind of
[1:40:00] as it were sleep in and not do anything
[1:40:03] and i could still make it my brother and
[1:40:05] sister that's called the denominational
[1:40:07] spirit
[1:40:08] amen but god said no no i'm not going to
[1:40:11] do that what is it it exposes satan who
[1:40:14] wants to be an exposer
[1:40:16] yeah i want my life to expose the devil
[1:40:20] amen it exposes satan revealing his
[1:40:23] works what is he trying to do
[1:40:25] destruct
[1:40:26] amen the destruction of god's people and
[1:40:29] the discrediting of god's word
[1:40:32] now do you realize when the prophet of
[1:40:34] god spoke this
[1:40:36] most of the dissenters of our day
[1:40:39] knew nothing about what god was doing
[1:40:42] but this right here as the old phrase is
[1:40:45] hit the nail on the head and clenched
[1:40:48] it
[1:40:50] it identifies
[1:40:51] there's ways if you disagree
[1:40:56] i've told you guys about that time there
[1:40:57] in
[1:40:58] in north carolina
[1:41:00] where brother jewell took me to
[1:41:01] breakfast remember that sat down in that
[1:41:04] little cafe and
[1:41:06] caught me so off guard when that little
[1:41:08] lady probably 70 years old
[1:41:10] hair all done up and all this rouge and
[1:41:14] she had just the you know the bright red
[1:41:16] cheeks and and
[1:41:18] let you come in there in honest
[1:41:20] sincerity
[1:41:21] brothers
[1:41:24] my husband's back in the hospital
[1:41:26] the doctor said he's dying
[1:41:29] you prayed for him before and god came
[1:41:31] on this scene and i'm asking you to pray
[1:41:32] again
[1:41:34] i don't know about the outward side of
[1:41:36] her how god will judge all this but
[1:41:38] there was a woman that said i have seen
[1:41:40] results and i'm going to go right back
[1:41:42] where the results were in the beginning
[1:41:44] because i believe god will answer your
[1:41:46] prayers and those brothers prayed as
[1:41:48] earnest as they ever prayed for anybody
[1:41:50] i believe ever in their life and that
[1:41:52] little old lady with tears just running
[1:41:53] down it's really sad you see this
[1:41:56] i'm not trying to be funny but you see
[1:41:58] this
[1:42:00] probably have to go with the bathroom
[1:42:01] and
[1:42:02] straighten it all up again
[1:42:05] they ought to just let their tears wash
[1:42:06] it right off and be done with it
[1:42:11] but he's trying to
[1:42:12] discredit see how hard he's worked
[1:42:15] discredited
[1:42:17] he doesn't have to defeat you saints
[1:42:20] if he's discredited your life
[1:42:23] that's why the scripture says
[1:42:25] not even the appearance of evil
[1:42:29] let that be a governing factor for us
[1:42:31] not even the appearance
[1:42:33] okay i'm hurrying
[1:42:36] sister ruth come that'll really work it
[1:42:37] on me here
[1:42:39] amen right down to the time he's cast in
[1:42:41] lake of fire he fights that he cannot
[1:42:42] stand it he knows that if the people get
[1:42:44] the true revelation of the true church
[1:42:48] and what she is and what she what stands
[1:42:51] for so it's not just one part it's
[1:42:54] multiple what she is and what she stands
[1:42:57] for and that
[1:43:00] come on do you know half the battle
[1:43:02] brother sisters pardon me i'm just so
[1:43:04] excited here half the battle in our life
[1:43:06] sometime is figuring out we can do it
[1:43:11] look from our childhood going forward
[1:43:15] hallelujah
[1:43:17] every young person i've seen it through
[1:43:19] the years my own children included okay
[1:43:22] dad's gonna teach you how to drive oh
[1:43:23] dad i can't do this
[1:43:26] give him just a few weeks
[1:43:28] dad can i take the car out
[1:43:29] [Music]
[1:43:31] why they figured out they can do it
[1:43:33] that's why by god's grace i pray our
[1:43:35] young people in this church and families
[1:43:37] and others in this church recognize i
[1:43:39] can do this
[1:43:41] i can live this
[1:43:42] i don't have to compromise
[1:43:45] i can do it
[1:43:46] i can do the greater works
[1:43:49] she will be
[1:43:50] an invincible army
[1:43:52] and if they get true revelation of the
[1:43:54] two spirits within the framework of the
[1:43:55] christian church and by god's spirit
[1:43:57] discern and withstand right
[1:44:00] amen look this was standing my brother
[1:44:03] and sister
[1:44:04] this is what we're preaching on tonight
[1:44:09] a time
[1:44:11] that satan comes in like a flood and we
[1:44:13] have it in our mind
[1:44:14] god's gonna raise up a standard over
[1:44:17] here a big wall is gonna no that's
[1:44:20] already in you
[1:44:23] satan buffets you
[1:44:24] and faith in you
[1:44:27] which doesn't know
[1:44:28] any hindrance
[1:44:30] rises up and says no
[1:44:33] i'm not much but i am
[1:44:35] a child of god
[1:44:37] and i am not walking away
[1:44:41] look i had a man one time i shared this
[1:44:42] with you

[1:44:46] church to get them away from the
[1:44:47] messenger you're a good pastor and
[1:44:49] they're good people you owe it to them
[1:44:53] and i said you're right i owe it to him
[1:44:55] really yeah so when you find something
[1:44:59] greater than this message

[1:45:03] but don't plan on it
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:06] silence them why

[1:45:44] what's the prophet say here people say
[1:45:46] well you know he didn't really write the
[1:45:47] church age book
[1:45:49] okay forget your nonsense
[1:45:51] just just if you don't believe it don't
[1:45:53] believe it but i believe it not because
[1:45:57] this person wrote it or that person
[1:45:59] wrote it i believe it because it is a
[1:46:02] perfect description of the believer in
[1:46:05] this hour and the unbeliever in this
[1:46:07] hour it is a perfect description of the
[1:46:10] spirit of the age and i can read that
[1:46:12] book and say well you care about it or
[1:46:15] not it's accurate
[1:46:18] it's real it's alive
[1:46:21] amen
[1:46:24] we're coming to a place saints whether
[1:46:26] you really feel it this evening or not i
[1:46:28] would ask you just to lift your hand and
[1:46:29] declare
[1:46:30] this spirit of the age is powerless
[1:46:33] before me
[1:46:34] this spirit has been bound by the holy
[1:46:37] ghost
[1:46:38] it is not me it is him it's always been
[1:46:41] him it'll never be about me it is always
[1:46:45] will be about him
[1:46:47] hallelujah
[1:46:49] hallelujah and he will be as definitely
[1:46:51] thwarted today as when christ would
[1:46:53] withstood his every effort to gain power
[1:46:56] over him in the desert yes
[1:46:59] satan hates revelation
[1:47:02] satan hates revelation
[1:47:05] come on saints these spirits are
[1:47:06] invading our realm
[1:47:08] where people are saying
[1:47:10] revelations overrated
[1:47:12] well i'm sorry that you're underrated
[1:47:15] and i don't mean that derogatory but
[1:47:17] you're underrated because revelation's
[1:47:18] not overrated to me revelation is life
[1:47:21] revelation is who i am revelation is the
[1:47:24] seventh seal open to us that we
[1:47:26] recognize that we are the very vessel
[1:47:28] that christ said i will come down in
[1:47:31] flesh in this day and i will manifest
[1:47:34] myself to all men
[1:47:36] oh hallelujah
[1:47:38] yeah satan hates it we love it
[1:47:41] true revelation our lives the gates of
[1:47:43] hell

[1:47:47] but we will prevail over them
[1:47:50] oh hallelujah
[1:47:53] let's just stand and worship the lord
[1:47:54] for a minute or two
[1:47:56] i i'm just gonna i'll tell you what
[1:47:58] excuse me i'm just overwrought tonight i
[1:47:59] know i'm just over the edge but i'm
[1:48:01] gonna lift both hands right here myself
[1:48:03] and i'm going to say lord thank you
[1:48:06] thank you lord for revelation
[1:48:09] because without revelation lord i would
[1:48:12] be simply some person caught up in some
[1:48:15] kind of theology i would have some kind
[1:48:17] of man-made idea i would have some kind
[1:48:20] of criticism or some kind of skepticism
[1:48:24] but by your grace
[1:48:27] i can hang my very soul
[1:48:29] on the word of god
[1:48:31] and knowing that it's good enough
[1:48:33] to take me and a rapture good enough to

[2:00:04] walls down low open area above

[2:00:16] he stops for a breath
[2:00:17] [Music]
[2:00:22] and i have to admit
[2:00:24] i thought why
[2:00:26] why these i'm looking through these
[2:00:27] young people
[2:00:30] been there when they were baptized been
[2:00:31] there when they gave their heart to the
[2:00:32] lord i saw god work there saw that i
[2:00:35] thought why is he preaching
[2:00:36] so hard at these young people
[2:00:40] just laying it down
[2:00:45] and then out this doorway of the
[2:00:47] gymnasium
[2:00:49] come a man
[2:00:50] from the street
[2:00:52] come to the altar
[2:00:54] bent down
[2:00:56] gave his heart to the lord
[2:00:58] and then here come a man and a woman off
[2:01:00] the street
[2:01:01] walking in
[2:01:03] coming then he make it to the altar
[2:01:05] kneel down on the floor start crying out
[2:01:07] to god
