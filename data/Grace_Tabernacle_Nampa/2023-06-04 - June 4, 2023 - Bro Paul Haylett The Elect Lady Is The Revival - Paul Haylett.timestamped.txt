[49:42] a Heavenly reward the word of God just
[49:44] reading this morning the prophet of God

[50:13] pulmonaries but if you would be seated
[50:14] for just a moment
[50:16] just have a few things we want to touch
[50:20] upon for a quick moment here
[50:23] amen one as you would remember from
[50:27] previous announcement that Sunday school
[50:29] is over for the summer take the summer
[50:32] break so
[50:34] um God bless you and um how do I say
[50:37] this I'll just say it
[50:40] don't start coming just before church
[50:42] starts now that you don't have to show
[50:43] up for Sunday School
[50:45] let's come early to the house of God
[50:47] let's spend some time and enter in Amen
[50:51] to pray to worship I don't know about
[50:54] you some of us maybe are are affected by
[50:58] this world a little more than others but
[51:00] I'm telling you Saints it takes a few
[51:02] minutes to shake off the spirit of
[51:04] laodicea
[51:05] amen let's shake it off before we come
[51:08] to worship amen before we come to enter
[51:10] in let's come and and shake that off
[51:14] um June 14th is a Wednesday it was a
[51:18] decision I made and I have reversed
[51:20] myself there will be no Wednesday
[51:22] Service uh June the 14th many of you
[51:26] will have to work and then we will be
[51:28] transitioning to go and get set up at
[51:32] Camp the very next day and then there
[51:35] will be no Sunday service here at the
[51:38] church at the Tabernacle
[51:40] on the 18th of June and for those that
[51:44] won't be able to go to Camp I don't know
[51:46] I think many of you will be traveling
[51:48] there's a wedding a few things like that
[51:51] graduation uh amen um uh I hope this is
[51:57] not too much of an inconvenience for you
[51:59] but just simply will not have enough uh
[52:05] Saints here at the assembly to to Really
[52:08] hold this service or at least I trust
[52:10] that all of you that can will come to
[52:12] camp amen now I want to you know
[52:15] sometimes Saints um
[52:18] we have to be careful
[52:21] um
[52:22] that in the business God's business
[52:25] I I believe in transparency I believe in
[52:30] what we do needs to be defensible and
[52:33] when I say that is is not to be
[52:35] defensive like not my fault not this not
[52:38] that but be defensible of why did this
[52:41] happen and be able to say we did this
[52:43] for this reason we have spent your money
[52:47] for this reason and so this morning I'm
[52:50] giving you just a little transparency of
[52:53] what um
[52:54] we have chose to spend your money on and
[52:57] um
[52:58] those of you that would know in time
[53:00] message Tabernacle it's in Ferndale
[53:02] Washington right now brother John Andes
[53:05] felt led of the Lord and you know it's
[53:08] interesting and I won't get into the
[53:09] controversy but people you know say well
[53:11] brother John this but I happen to know
[53:13] that brother John's had this burden
[53:14] about having a church on the United on
[53:17] the state side for
[53:19] um probably
[53:21] in the in the decade plus
[53:24] um you know 12 15 years he's voiced we
[53:28] we need this and and then God laid upon
[53:30] his heart and he's done this and
[53:32] um we know from the early there's
[53:34] probably not too many of here from the
[53:37] early uh times of Grace Tabernacle but
[53:40] there was times that we shared buildings
[53:42] and you would walk into the building uh
[53:46] on a Sunday morning and literally there
[53:48] would be cigarette butts and beer cans
[53:50] and party balloons and trash everywhere
[53:53] and we would have to change the
[53:56] atmosphere before we could have church
[53:58] and really worship and so they have been
[54:02] in the community center they're in
[54:04] Ferndale and dealing with these same
[54:07] kind of issues and uh so God has granted
[54:11] to them uh to be able to lease a church
[54:15] uh that is closer to the airport there
[54:18] in Bellingham uh it's a lovely facility
[54:21] T it is going to be quite a burden upon
[54:25] them as a church it did not come cheap
[54:28] but they have prayed about it feel like
[54:31] that God opened this door for them and
[54:34] uh so they've been able to move now out
[54:37] of the Community Church Center for
[54:39] church into they're in the process now
[54:42] moving into a church of which they will
[54:44] be the sole occupant and I'm telling you
[54:47] do we remember the days when we became
[54:50] the sole occupant amen when you walked
[54:53] in the house of God
[54:55] whether it be a Wednesday night a Sunday
[54:57] morning and you could still feel
[55:01] the presence of God
[55:03] from the previous service
[55:05] there was no atmosphere of demons to be
[55:08] chased out no atmosphere of the Carnage
[55:11] of laodicea in there but you could walk
[55:13] through the doors of the church into an
[55:16] atmosphere that took you right back and
[55:19] brought you to a place that you could
[55:21] say thank you Lord for your blessings
[55:23] and I'm believing with all of my heart
[55:25] this is what God is is giving to those
[55:29] of end time message Tabernacle
[55:31] and um so we have our in the process of
[55:35] sending a
[55:37] offering to them and um
[55:41] we um
[55:43] with Council we have uh
[55:46] felt like a 2500
[55:48] uh would be apportioned just help and
[55:52] encourage them to move forward so I just
[55:54] want you to know a little bit of that's
[55:57] where we're sending your money amen now
[56:01] you can divvy that up any way you want
[56:03] call it tithe call it offering call it
[56:05] this call it that it's all God's money
[56:07] and we are God's people amen that means
[56:10] we all are a part of the work that is
[56:13] being done and can we lift a hand and
[56:15] say thank you Lord for allowing me to be
[56:17] a part amen I don't want to be just a
[56:19] stranger an observer a bystander
[56:24] I want to be a part of it amen and oh
[56:27] God bless you
[56:28] brother personant sister akonsha God
[56:31] bless you good to see you here our
[56:33] brother Paul God bless you good to see
[56:35] you and your family here today
[56:38] you'll have to forgive me I'll have to
[56:40] work on remembering names
[56:42] it's always a struggle you know uh to to
[56:46] remember names amen uh and uh communion
[56:51] tonight 5 PM
[56:53] now
[56:54] sister Jerry shared with me
[56:57] I could insert this in the in the sermon
[56:59] real easy but I just bring it out right
[57:02] now Sister Jerry shared a little
[57:04] something with me a little clip which a
[57:08] man is talking about how Medical Science
[57:11] Now
[57:13] has figured out there's certain kind of
[57:15] cell
[57:16] in the human body and amazing my brother
[57:20] and sister that each cell
[57:23] in our body knows right where it belongs
[57:27] they can give you a blood transfusion
[57:29] and it doesn't all just go to your foot
[57:32] but the cells that are in that know
[57:35] right where they belong and medical
[57:37] Sciences now figured out that there is a
[57:41] healing power in the body now when
[57:44] things happen it's recorded in the brain
[57:46] right
[57:48] you're sitting here observing this
[57:49] morning you have an endless loop video
[57:53] playing in your mind this morning
[57:56] Medical Science has figured out there's
[57:58] uh forget the names but they have
[58:00] figured out that there's a certain kind
[58:02] of cell that resides only in the heart
[58:06] and that cell
[58:09] is not a singular cell to itself but as
[58:11] a cell that communicates as a cell that
[58:13] has memory
[58:15] and we can have traumas and we can have
[58:17] trials and we can have stresses in our
[58:19] life and we could say you know what I've
[58:21] had healing in my mind I've been able to
[58:24] put this to the side and I've been able
[58:26] to move on but their understanding that
[58:29] stress
[58:32] is recorded in the heart
[58:35] now if you'll just think about this
[58:37] you'll be able to take it right to
[58:39] scripture
[58:40] stress is recorded in the heart Joy is
[58:44] recorded in the heart the things of life
[58:48] are recorded in the heart and the
[58:51] scripture tells us that we are living in
[58:53] an age when men's Hearts would be
[58:55] failing for fear so it is a fear that is
[58:58] being recorded in their heart that is
[59:01] causing a failure but the psalmist David
[59:03] said that it is joy in the morning my
[59:07] brother and sister that brings the
[59:08] presence of God into our life it is the
[59:11] joy of the Lord and the deliverance and
[59:13] Thanksgiving in our hearts that is
[59:15] recorded in our hearts that gives our
[59:18] heart Liberty the word says if your
[59:21] heart condemns you not amen so there's
[59:24] not judgment recorded in your heart then
[59:27] you have confidence in God and I want to
[59:30] say this morning I want confidence in my
[59:33] God I want nothing but joy in my heart
[59:37] to be lifted up all the stresses of Life
[59:39] come the strain of life is here but we
[59:43] can by God's grace let that go and let
[59:46] the joy of the Lord our hearts Can
[59:49] someone say Amen this morning
[59:51] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen and
[59:55] that calls me as that was said brother
[59:57] Tim to think as we've read requests
[1:00:00] speaking with brother Trevor last night
[1:00:02] amen we want to remember Joshua we want
[1:00:06] to remember our young people we want to
[1:00:08] remember each one that's not serving God
[1:00:10] and parents brothers and sisters elders
[1:00:15] our young people our teenagers
[1:00:19] are living in the worst of times
[1:00:24] let's not pray for them after
[1:00:26] the devil has tore them up and clawed
[1:00:28] them
[1:00:29] let's pray for them now that the Holy
[1:00:32] Spirit surround them the power of the
[1:00:35] word be there to lift them up we are
[1:00:38] just human
[1:00:39] and sometimes we as humans fail and you
[1:00:42] might say we fail miserably
[1:00:45] but it's the word of God that is holding
[1:00:48] each one of us not one of us today can
[1:00:50] say I'm standing on my strength but we
[1:00:54] have to acknowledge today I am standing
[1:00:56] by the grace of almighty God Amen let's
[1:01:00] just stand and lift our hands for a
[1:01:01] moment and thank him for his grace as we
[1:01:04] go into this service today I see my
[1:01:05] brother vasili God bless you brother

[1:01:15] we stand by The Amazing Grace that you
[1:01:19] have poured out upon us as your people I
[1:01:22] say thank you Lord and we just give
[1:01:24] praise to you this morning Lord to lift
[1:01:27] our voices lift our hearts and hands to
[1:01:29] say thank you for this amazing grace
[1:01:31] that is here today in our lives has come
[1:01:35] down and settled in our hearts that we

[1:01:53] 1-8 to start with
[1:01:56] amen you think we could read this
[1:01:58] together Saints could we coordinate
[1:02:00] ourselves to read this together you see
[1:02:03] this I bring to you today as part of the
[1:02:05] sermon but yet still just because it is
[1:02:09] such a lovely
[1:02:11] encouraging strengthening word of God
[1:02:13] don't you love it when the word of God
[1:02:15] gives you strength amen amen can we read
[1:02:20] together
[1:02:21] okay
[1:02:23] I will praise thee with my whole heart
[1:02:27] before the gods will I sing praise unto
[1:02:31] thee I will worship toward thy Holy
[1:02:34] Temple and praise thy name for thy
[1:02:38] loving kindness and for thy Truth for
[1:02:40] thou Hast magnified Thy word above all
[1:02:45] thy name in the day when I cried thou
[1:02:49] answered me oh Hallelujah and strengthen
[1:02:52] me with strength in my soul all the
[1:02:55] kings of the Earth shall praise thee O
[1:02:58] Lord when they hear the words of thy
[1:03:01] mouth yea they shall sing in the ways of
[1:03:05] the Lord for great is the glory of the
[1:03:08] Lord though the Lord be high yet hath he
[1:03:12] respect unto the lowly but the proud he
[1:03:16] knoweth afar off though I walk in the
[1:03:19] midst of trouble thou will revive me
[1:03:22] Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand
[1:03:25] against the wrath of mine enemies and
[1:03:28] thy right hand shall save me the Lord
[1:03:31] will perfect that which concerneth me
[1:03:35] thy mercy O Lord endureth forever
[1:03:39] forsake not the works of thine own hands
[1:03:43] can we say Amen Hallelujah Lord bless
[1:03:46] the service I pray today amen you may be
[1:03:49] seated Saints
[1:03:57] some of you may or may not be
[1:03:59] uh
[1:04:01] aware of or or uh
[1:04:04] enlightened as it were into the
[1:04:06] proximity principle
[1:04:08] um are you aware of what the proximity
[1:04:10] principle is
[1:04:12] it actually has to do the way it's
[1:04:14] promoted in the world today is that if
[1:04:17] you want to be successful you hang out
[1:04:21] with or in the proximity of successful
[1:04:24] people if you want to uh uh be a good at
[1:04:28] business you don't go and seek the
[1:04:31] advice of poor businessmen if you want
[1:04:34] to be a good student you don't take the
[1:04:36] behavior of the student who is failing
[1:04:39] so the proximity would be that you would
[1:04:42] be in that little circle uh with those
[1:04:45] that are what you desire to be amen and
[1:04:48] so it's there my brother and sister that
[1:04:50] we as Christians we're not going to go
[1:04:52] into all the business Avenue but it
[1:04:54] certainly is true you want to be
[1:04:56] successful you you don't go with someone
[1:04:59] who by repeated failure believes they
[1:05:03] have good advice my brother and sister
[1:05:05] you find someone so as Christians we
[1:05:08] want to uh be in fellowship with we want
[1:05:12] to be close to truth amen we don't want
[1:05:15] to hang out as it were in the world
[1:05:18] today and say well I went here and I
[1:05:20] went there and I saw their faults and
[1:05:22] failures so therefore I believe I'm
[1:05:24] Authority what you want to do as the
[1:05:26] bride of Christ you want to be with the
[1:05:29] bride of Christ so that the truth that
[1:05:32] is present in the bride will have that
[1:05:35] proximity effect upon you in other words
[1:05:38] sometimes when we don't feel so
[1:05:40] encouraged in life anybody ever feel
[1:05:42] that way amen what happens when someone
[1:05:45] comes around that is singing the Praises
[1:05:49] of God someone calls you up and says I
[1:05:52] just felt to call you or I felt to text
[1:05:54] you and say God bless you and lift you
[1:05:57] up today that whatever your day might be
[1:06:01] that God is with you and not by brother
[1:06:04] and sister the proximity it is the word
[1:06:06] and and today I believe as I I would
[1:06:09] just come back my brother and sister
[1:06:11] speaking on things that are to be my
[1:06:14] brother and sister were talking about a
[1:06:15] Revival in this day and there has been a
[1:06:18] phrase that has been put out it wasn't
[1:06:20] direct words as it were from the prophet
[1:06:23] of God but my brother and sister people
[1:06:25] talk about the bride's Revival well
[1:06:28] we'll look at this you won't find
[1:06:29] anything where the prophet of God
[1:06:31] directly identifies what this bride's
[1:06:34] Revival would be or is but I'm here to
[1:06:37] tell you today as I speak to you the
[1:06:39] elect lady
[1:06:41] is the Revival
[1:06:44] she's not looking for a Revival she is
[1:06:48] the Revival
[1:06:50] my brother and sister we know the story
[1:06:52] as it were they were looking for the
[1:06:54] great Revival and you know they come to
[1:06:56] the policemen and we're looking for this
[1:06:59] and he's telling them you found it amen
[1:07:01] he didn't Point him to an address down
[1:07:03] the street he didn't tell him come back
[1:07:05] at a certain meeting time but he
[1:07:07] recognized that the Revival was in him
[1:07:11] and this bride my brother and sister is
[1:07:14] the Revival that the world is looking
[1:07:17] for today now I've had to cut back many
[1:07:19] quotes and many references just to try
[1:07:22] to fit it in a time frame today but I
[1:07:25] want you to understand my brother and
[1:07:26] sister that the answer is not to be
[1:07:29] found in our governments it's not to be
[1:07:32] found in the Nations or politics it's
[1:07:34] not to be found in the churches it's not
[1:07:37] even found as it were in the preacher or
[1:07:41] the actual body of Believers it's not
[1:07:43] found there the prophet of God clearly
[1:07:45] shows us it's found in Christ the word
[1:07:49] amen and so when we get in Christ the
[1:07:52] word and recognize that's where we
[1:07:53] belong that's when we come into the
[1:07:56] atmosphere of Revival amen and there has
[1:08:00] to have been life there already for it
[1:08:02] to be revived amen our sister being you
[1:08:07] know what she is in the medical field
[1:08:08] amen if someone's there and all the
[1:08:11] blood has run out of them and their
[1:08:13] heart hasn't beat for 20 minutes my
[1:08:15] brother and sister the very odds that
[1:08:18] they could ever be brought to life would
[1:08:19] have to be an act of God Amen because
[1:08:22] the life has left but if there is even
[1:08:24] the flicker of life in that individual
[1:08:28] then they can be by God's grace revived
[1:08:32] and so we're looking at the Dark Ages
[1:08:34] we're looking at all the time we're
[1:08:36] looking of the spirits of denomination
[1:08:38] and we're seeing that and people say
[1:08:40] well well why is he talking about
[1:08:42] Revival we've had Revival my brother and
[1:08:45] sister it was being revived back to the
[1:08:48] original life amen not just a life but
[1:08:51] an original life amen and without that
[1:08:54] Revival there will be no true life in
[1:08:57] the individual amen so it is my brother
[1:09:00] and sister once again the proximity
[1:09:02] principle is being close to look it up
[1:09:05] Webster Online will tell you it's been
[1:09:08] close to truth
[1:09:09] that doesn't talk about being close to
[1:09:12] uh uh Warren Buffett
[1:09:13] on how to own a few railroads and a few
[1:09:16] Airlines and a few coca-colas and
[1:09:18] whatever else my brother and sister it's
[1:09:20] truth amen now look there's a certain
[1:09:23] anointing of being on the scene
[1:09:25] I could pick almost any uh event today
[1:09:29] and tell you about what I have witnessed
[1:09:31] in my life and uh you you would you
[1:09:34] would be there and say okay that's good
[1:09:36] brother Paul that's a very Vivid picture
[1:09:38] that you've painted but you'll never
[1:09:41] have the same reaction as you would have
[1:09:44] if you were on the scene if you were
[1:09:47] there my brother and sister I understand
[1:09:49] the circumstances of life I'm a little
[1:09:51] hesitant to put this out this way but I
[1:09:53] will because they will be understanding
[1:09:56] but my brother and sister I've watched
[1:09:58] many a service online
[1:10:02] and I can tell you it's not the same
[1:10:05] as being there
[1:10:09] I have been in Services before
[1:10:13] traveling in our personal time vacation
[1:10:16] drop into a service we were there
[1:10:19] we felt the presence of God and sitting
[1:10:22] watching the same service again online
[1:10:25] and you realize something's missing
[1:10:28] because there's an anointing with being
[1:10:31] there
[1:10:32] in person
[1:10:34] now my brother and sister when we'll
[1:10:36] talk about the redeeming
[1:10:38] blood washing
[1:10:41] life-changing word of God in this hour
[1:10:44] to be told what that is is good we need
[1:10:47] to share this amen we need to give this
[1:10:50] but there's nothing like experiencing
[1:10:52] that for yourself there's nothing like
[1:10:55] having the power of God come down answer
[1:10:58] your questions when you never told
[1:11:00] anyone what the question was the power
[1:11:03] of God coming and moving in your life
[1:11:05] giving you directions before you ever
[1:11:08] come to that intersection of life God
[1:11:11] telling you this is where you need to go
[1:11:13] this is what you need to do this is
[1:11:15] where you need to stop as it were sister
[1:11:18] Jerry and I in Australia a few years ago
[1:11:20] we had quite a phenomenon our phones
[1:11:22] they didn't I guess the cell network
[1:11:24] didn't really like our phone or
[1:11:26] something and we'd be driving
[1:11:27] unfortunately I'm here to be transparent
[1:11:30] to you it caused a little friction
[1:11:32] between sister Jerry and I because we're
[1:11:34] driving down the road not only am I on
[1:11:36] the wrong side of the car
[1:11:38] hey man how many of you drove on the
[1:11:40] wrong side of the car
[1:11:42] amen it causes a little friction you got
[1:11:44] to remind yourself I got to stay next to
[1:11:46] the center line next to the center line
[1:11:48] you come to an intersection you know
[1:11:50] Center Line you just want to turn and go
[1:11:52] into the correct Lane
[1:11:54] but you're driving along there and and
[1:11:57] sister Jerry you know we're going by GPS
[1:11:59] and we would go by an intersection and
[1:12:01] Jared say you missed the turn and I said
[1:12:03] I didn't know it was my turn
[1:12:05] how did I supposed to know and then
[1:12:08] while the phone wouldn't tell us we
[1:12:10] needed to turn there it was
[1:12:12] instantaneous to tell us you missed it
[1:12:15] now correcting now correcting
[1:12:18] redirecting
[1:12:19] my brother and sister but the Holy Ghost
[1:12:21] amen the only time the Holy Ghost does
[1:12:25] not we don't hear it is because when we
[1:12:27] don't heed it amen God is Not diligent
[1:12:30] or negligent I mean to to let us just go
[1:12:33] on blundering through life without
[1:12:35] giving a word to us of what we need to
[1:12:38] do Can someone say yes I have experience
[1:12:41] amen so there's an anointing with being
[1:12:44] on the scene now in a minute we're going
[1:12:45] to read Acts 2 so you'll understand
[1:12:47] where we're going here but my brother
[1:12:50] and sister to be on the scene we have
[1:12:52] choices today we can either be in the
[1:12:54] upper room or we can choose to be on the
[1:12:57] street
[1:13:00] the people on the street said they're
[1:13:02] drunk and they were right
[1:13:05] come on do you hear me this morning
[1:13:07] they said they're drunk and they were
[1:13:10] right but they weren't drunk on carnal
[1:13:13] inspiration a carnal anointing they
[1:13:17] weren't drunk on the things of this
[1:13:19] world my brother and sister they were
[1:13:21] drunk on the Holy Ghost amen and so it's
[1:13:24] there as we today also have our
[1:13:27] opportunity to choose whether we want to
[1:13:29] be in the upper room or on the street
[1:13:31] amen I'll tell you look at this now
[1:13:34] everyone this will be hard for some of
[1:13:37] us in this day to digest everyone in the
[1:13:40] upper room the scripture tells us come
[1:13:43] in one mind and one Accord
[1:13:46] now that'd be all easy if you'll all
[1:13:48] just agree with me
[1:13:50] but it wasn't man
[1:13:52] that they were coming into one Accord
[1:13:55] with
[1:13:56] it was gone
[1:13:59] so we can all be in lockstep if you
[1:14:02] understand that phrase walking perfectly
[1:14:04] together
[1:14:05] we can be in lockstep my brother and
[1:14:07] sister and not be right
[1:14:10] do I need to repeat that
[1:14:12] we can be in lockstep
[1:14:15] every one of us agreeing with one
[1:14:18] another
[1:14:19] that does not make us right
[1:14:23] amen the unity that we must find has to
[1:14:26] be found in the word of God and when we
[1:14:29] find that Unity we will find the actual
[1:14:32] cares of Life the actual things of life
[1:14:35] we are able Can someone say we are able
[1:14:39] to take and set aside the difference of
[1:14:42] personality of the flavor of I like this
[1:14:45] or I like that I often joke you know
[1:14:48] that's why literally every year comes by
[1:14:50] they invent a new kind of ice cream
[1:14:52] because there are somebody who doesn't
[1:14:54] like the other 400 flavors
[1:15:01] but today will come
[1:15:04] when your favorite flavor
[1:15:06] of church
[1:15:07] of preachers
[1:15:09] of whatever is not available
[1:15:13] then what do we do
[1:15:15] you wonder why churches come into
[1:15:17] disharmity they come into a place where
[1:15:19] there's discourse uh not discourse
[1:15:22] discontent in the body of Believers is
[1:15:25] because they quit finding their unity in
[1:15:28] Jesus Christ and we're trying to find
[1:15:31] their unity in numbers
[1:15:33] we have 51 of the church stands with us
[1:15:37] I don't care about what your percentage
[1:15:40] is that stands with the preacher or
[1:15:42] stands with someone else I want to know
[1:15:44] how many of us are in unity with the
[1:15:47] word
[1:15:48] what is our important thing in our life
[1:15:50] that we look to and say Lord I have one
[1:15:53] desire not to stand with brother Paul
[1:15:55] not to stand with brother or whoever but
[1:15:58] I want to stand in a Unity with the word
[1:16:01] of God for this hour
[1:16:04] and when we can find that my brother and
[1:16:07] sister amen we find ourselves April to
[1:16:11] come into the house of God
[1:16:13] with not a burden to our heart
[1:16:18] I don't know about you are you able to
[1:16:19] separate your heart from your mind
[1:16:23] actually I would hope you could
[1:16:26] because the mind my brother and sister
[1:16:28] can be a large filing cabinet
[1:16:33] do you have a filing cabinet in your
[1:16:34] house
[1:16:36] you know some of you do some don't well
[1:16:38] I'll just use the example anyway go home
[1:16:40] open that file cabinet is everything
[1:16:42] inside that file cabinet important
[1:16:45] no sir you go back we file our business
[1:16:48] in storage boxes to get them out and get
[1:16:52] them put away and you know we're
[1:16:54] starting to go back uh quite a few years
[1:16:56] saved them way too long sister Jerry is
[1:16:58] there like oh look at this poem uh let's
[1:17:01] see how's that was in um that was in
[1:17:03] 1979 you would have been uh 17 years old
[1:17:08] you think this check's important
[1:17:10] yeah
[1:17:14] that's our mind
[1:17:17] we have filed grievances
[1:17:20] and we have also filed things that are
[1:17:23] of joy
[1:17:25] don't throw out the important things
[1:17:27] throw out the unimportant things
[1:17:31] let the important things be anchored in
[1:17:33] our soul my brother and sister how many
[1:17:35] of us today would literally say Lord I
[1:17:38] would ask you to come today and let our
[1:17:40] service be an upper room experience let
[1:17:43] our service be a service of the power of
[1:17:46] God would speak down through our
[1:17:48] building but we can't do that if our
[1:17:51] file cabinet is full of every bit of
[1:17:53] grievance and trash of the years gone by
[1:17:56] because those things will hinder us but
[1:17:59] by God's grace my brother and sister we
[1:18:01] can say you know what I've got to I've
[1:18:03] got things to worry about tomorrow I've
[1:18:05] got things I need to do tomorrow but I
[1:18:09] in the moment am going to let my heart
[1:18:11] rejoice in the presence of almighty God
[1:18:14] Amen I don't care what yesterday held I
[1:18:18] don't even care Saints if you're sitting
[1:18:20] here sleepy this morning and Satan
[1:18:22] trying to distract you I want you to let
[1:18:26] your heart loose let your heart be free
[1:18:29] let your heart Rejoice this this morning
[1:18:32] amen not let your heart be burdened
[1:18:35] amen they come not only in one Accord
[1:18:38] with the word but they had to come
[1:18:40] United with one another in Fellowship
[1:18:43] now it didn't change
[1:18:45] their distinct desire of certain food or
[1:18:48] certain spice or certain clothes or
[1:18:50] certain colors or certain place
[1:18:54] some can live right down in the very
[1:18:55] midst of this city crowded by honking
[1:18:58] horns and and traffic and others just
[1:19:02] would melt down there I can say that
[1:19:04] from experience my brother and sister I
[1:19:07] lived in an apartment when we were first
[1:19:08] married amen sister Jerry finally is
[1:19:11] like look you're worse than the dog you
[1:19:13] know every time a car drives by I'm at
[1:19:15] the window
[1:19:17] it's just a neighbor Paul it's the same
[1:19:20] car that shows up at five o'clock every
[1:19:22] single day
[1:19:24] and I'm like I gotta know who's in my
[1:19:26] yard it's not your yard it's a parking
[1:19:28] lot
[1:19:30] but people do that they live in that
[1:19:32] world
[1:19:34] and other people
[1:19:36] come out in our world and go you know
[1:19:37] it's a little bit creepy when you're out
[1:19:39] here by yourself
[1:19:41] no it's we're not here by yourself we
[1:19:43] have a neighbor a half a mile that way
[1:19:46] we have neighbors on top of the hill
[1:19:48] there's a neighbor down the road that
[1:19:50] way we're not alone
[1:19:53] you see we've got to come to the place
[1:19:55] my brother and sister that we realize
[1:19:57] the unity that we're looking for in the
[1:19:59] word of God is not a Unity of Conformity
[1:20:02] but it's a Unity where we can enter into
[1:20:05] one mind and one Accord with a word of
[1:20:08] God for this hour and when we can enter
[1:20:11] into that one of mind and one Accord
[1:20:13] amen it is there and I'll tell you I
[1:20:16] want to be United with you
[1:20:18] amen I want to be United with you I want
[1:20:20] to be in fellowship with all of you
[1:20:23] young and old amen I don't care about
[1:20:25] what your situation is and you're a
[1:20:28] teenager you're in high school you have
[1:20:30] a different set of things of your world
[1:20:32] I don't care I want to be in unity with
[1:20:34] you as my brothers and sisters and I
[1:20:37] want to be in unity with my Lord Jesus
[1:20:39] Christ I want to be in one mind with him
[1:20:42] that if he says stop I can say yes Lord
[1:20:45] if he says go I can say yes Lord
[1:20:48] Hallelujah sorry for holler and I'm just
[1:20:50] excited
[1:20:52] Amen in time seed sign brother Branham
[1:20:55] says here
[1:20:59] would be there I think
[1:21:00] what's the matter Church of God what's
[1:21:02] the matter with us what's the matter
[1:21:04] with you Baptists you Presbyterians
[1:21:06] Assembly of God Jesus only all the rest
[1:21:08] of you what's the matter with us can't
[1:21:10] you see the seed don't you be careful
[1:21:13] what kind of seed you're taking into the
[1:21:16] womb of your heart
[1:21:18] this is a very science my brother and
[1:21:21] sister that they have now discovered
[1:21:23] that your heart has a memory it is
[1:21:26] actually not so much that your brain is
[1:21:28] telling your heart to be it's your heart
[1:21:31] telling your heart to beat
[1:21:34] you realize if they continue medical
[1:21:37] things and correct me if I'm I'm got the
[1:21:40] facts a little wrong but my brother and
[1:21:42] sister you can be brain dead and your
[1:21:44] heart still beating it needs oxygen
[1:21:49] if they introduce oxygen
[1:21:51] the heart can go on beating
[1:21:54] because you see really the stimuli
[1:21:58] is not necessarily entirely encapsulated
[1:22:00] in the brain
[1:22:02] but the heart has an intrinsic instinct
[1:22:06] to keep on beating
[1:22:10] now let me bring it down to a term here
[1:22:13] to those of you that ever walked away
[1:22:15] from serving God
[1:22:16] and you got out there in the world out
[1:22:18] there
[1:22:19] and you were like I'm free amen I have
[1:22:22] moved out I'm a thousand or more miles
[1:22:25] away from home there's nobody here to
[1:22:27] tell me what to do but you couldn't
[1:22:29] enter into the world my brother and
[1:22:31] sister there was not single shackle
[1:22:33] there was not a single person looking
[1:22:34] over your shoulder you could be anything
[1:22:36] you wanted to be but there was something
[1:22:38] where in the brain that was keeping you
[1:22:41] from being the world no it was in the
[1:22:43] heart something down in the heart says
[1:22:47] you don't belong here you are not a part
[1:22:51] of this this is not who you are it
[1:22:54] wasn't a brain because the brain would
[1:22:56] be fanciful that this group of people
[1:22:58] this cute girl this circumstance over
[1:23:01] here that would be fun that would be
[1:23:04] good I want to do it and the heart is
[1:23:06] over here saying no
[1:23:09] amen
[1:23:10] what we got to do is separate Satan's
[1:23:12] influence on the brain amen and let it
[1:23:16] be God's influence in the heart
[1:23:18] because when we'll surrender the heart
[1:23:20] to God he'll take you through laodicea
[1:23:23] he'll take you through this wicked age
[1:23:25] he'll take you through every dire
[1:23:27] circumstance he'll take you through
[1:23:29] every jungle through every desert
[1:23:32] through every Mountaintop every Valley
[1:23:34] but we've got to listen to the heart and
[1:23:38] not the brain
[1:23:39] amen
[1:23:41] be careful what kind of seed you're
[1:23:43] taking into the womb of your heart don't
[1:23:46] take Creeds take the word they've been
[1:23:48] talking so much about latter rain
[1:23:51] in this funny here because brother
[1:23:52] Branham actually has very much a
[1:23:54] rebuttal here against the latter rain
[1:23:56] and the critics of the message are like
[1:23:58] well William Branham was all caught up
[1:24:00] in that ladder rain nonsense well when
[1:24:02] you read this this is one that tells me
[1:24:05] amen he says they're talking so much
[1:24:07] about latter rain not discarding you
[1:24:10] latter rain Brethren but that's not
[1:24:12] latter rain
[1:24:14] amen the very thing they said this is
[1:24:16] the move of God this is the move of God
[1:24:18] the prophet of God's there saying not is
[1:24:21] not the move of God
[1:24:23] man no wonder they even kicked him out
[1:24:24] of that movement
[1:24:26] huh
[1:24:28] if the latter rain would have been here
[1:24:30] the power of God would have struck that
[1:24:32] thing and cheetah swept the world the
[1:24:34] latter rains fixed it up whoa this gives
[1:24:37] us room for a Doctrine
[1:24:39] there's still room for a lot of rain
[1:24:41] Doctrine
[1:24:42] anybody want to join me
[1:24:45] I hope you do
[1:24:47] amen
[1:24:52] a lot of rain's fixing to come what's
[1:24:54] the matter the church is manufacturing
[1:24:57] herself something just like Eve tried to
[1:24:59] do she tried to have more light to
[1:25:02] manufacture something we've done the
[1:25:04] same thing trying to make something in
[1:25:07] ourselves
[1:25:09] oh look at that keep your hand off of it
[1:25:12] let God do it amen take his word believe
[1:25:16] it hold it in your heart and when the
[1:25:19] rain begins to fall life will take hold
[1:25:21] and the word will manifest itself amen
[1:25:25] we don't have to produce this my brother
[1:25:27] and sister now there's many quotes about
[1:25:30] the Sheep you don't tell the Sheep make
[1:25:32] us wool you don't go out whisper in the
[1:25:34] sheep's ear make me some wool the Sheep
[1:25:37] makes wool because he's a sheep and the
[1:25:40] bride will manifest the word of God in
[1:25:42] this hour because she is the bride it
[1:25:46] won't be that we got to manufacture
[1:25:48] there that we've got to have a certain
[1:25:50] thing to prove that God is present but I
[1:25:53] tell you what my brother and sister if
[1:25:55] you was just to go and have time to just
[1:25:57] sit out there and watch a sheep
[1:26:02] any sheep that's healthy wants a lot of
[1:26:05] water
[1:26:06] wants food and wants shade
[1:26:09] and everything else just
[1:26:12] happens
[1:26:15] Lead Me
[1:26:16] beside the Still Waters
[1:26:20] cover me
[1:26:22] Lord with a shadow
[1:26:24] I win
[1:26:27] that I couldn't just trust you
[1:26:30] that I can just stop with my care of
[1:26:33] life and say Lord
[1:26:38] you see that's when we come in unity
[1:26:42] footsteps on the sands of time we all
[1:26:44] know the story we've all seen a picture
[1:26:46] here or there of the footsteps on the
[1:26:48] sands of time do you realize my brother
[1:26:50] and sister that it was actually a
[1:26:52] necessity to come with you know in the
[1:26:54] story it's like Lord why did you leave
[1:26:56] me only one set of footsteps and the
[1:26:58] Lord telling them no that's when I
[1:27:00] carried you but my brother and sister do
[1:27:02] you realize it's actually not a sign of
[1:27:06] being in tune with the word when we're
[1:27:07] walking on our own
[1:27:09] it's when we come to the end of our
[1:27:12] string and there's only one set of
[1:27:14] footprints in our lives one set of
[1:27:17] footprints in our families only one set
[1:27:20] of footprints in our church that's when
[1:27:22] we truly have come into the correct
[1:27:24] position but yet we as humans say I need
[1:27:27] to be strong I need to be strong I tell
[1:27:29] you what I need to be I need to be weak
[1:27:31] and let Christ have his way
[1:27:33] I need to submit myself and say Lord I
[1:27:36] can't do this any longer Lead Me Lord
[1:27:39] Carry Me Lord
[1:27:41] because I tell you I know the human
[1:27:43] nature well enough after these many
[1:27:45] years my brother and sister if we can do
[1:27:47] something on our own and we as humans
[1:27:50] will be prone to do it on our own but
[1:27:53] God's going to bring you amen can I make
[1:27:55] you all discouraged this morning God's
[1:27:57] going to bring you to a place that you
[1:28:00] can't even walk on your own and we fight
[1:28:03] against it we fight against and we fight
[1:28:05] against it you should rejoice in it say
[1:28:08] Carry Me Lord Carry Me Lord because then
[1:28:12] I walk on my own my footsteps and your
[1:28:14] footsteps are not perfectly lined up
[1:28:17] but when he's carrying us amen when the
[1:28:20] rain begins to fall life will take hold
[1:28:22] that's what we need to look for that's
[1:28:25] the latter rain my brother and sister
[1:28:27] that the prophet of God believed in now
[1:28:30] let's
[1:28:31] turn in our Bibles
[1:28:32] I forgot me a hanky amen
[1:28:35] well praise the Lord that's all right I
[1:28:38] hope you all don't mind me kind of
[1:28:39] snotting around here

[1:28:45] Kleenex right there two or three
[1:28:48] oh

[1:28:56] name or something

[1:29:08] kidding brother Tim

[1:29:11] two Acts 2 and 16
[1:29:14] . now look
[1:29:16] what is brought here
[1:29:18] their Supernatural event taking place
[1:29:21] things happening my brother and sister
[1:29:23] that the world is questioning because
[1:29:25] they've never seen
[1:29:28] such
[1:29:29] now just because the world has not seen
[1:29:32] it does that mean it's not of God
[1:29:35] that's what the Pharisees problem was
[1:29:37] that's what the Sadducees herodians
[1:29:41] they've never seen this
[1:29:43] that's what's wrong in Israel right now
[1:29:45] I like to watch some of these deals of
[1:29:47] some of these rabbis over there
[1:29:49] they get some of them are pretty strong
[1:29:52] you wonder about the spirit that Jesus
[1:29:54] faced in that day you just have to go
[1:29:56] and watch through some of these things
[1:29:58] of these priests and whatnot that are
[1:30:01] there and these rabbis you know and uh
[1:30:05] you know some of them come out so strong
[1:30:08] you know if this and this and this ever
[1:30:10] happened why blah blah blah and no way
[1:30:14] it's just a deceit it's a lie we have
[1:30:17] tradition
[1:30:19] well good my Bible says you're going to
[1:30:21] die in your tradition
[1:30:23] amen I'll tell you what I want to do I
[1:30:25] want to die in the blood
[1:30:27] amen and I'm not talking about natural
[1:30:29] death I'm talking about spiritual death
[1:30:31] I want to die in the blood
[1:30:34] amen and let life amen as the rain
[1:30:36] begins to fall amen then that's when
[1:30:40] life appears
[1:30:42] amen but this is that which was spoken
[1:30:46] by the prophet Joel and it shall come to
[1:30:48] pass in the last days so it's our day is
[1:30:50] talking about saith God I will pour out
[1:30:53] my spirit upon All Flesh and your son
[1:30:56] and your daughters shall prophesy and
[1:30:59] your young men shall see visions and
[1:31:01] your old men shall dream dreams and on
[1:31:03] my servants and upon my handmaidens I
[1:31:06] will pour out in the house in those days
[1:31:09] of my spirit and they shall prophesy
[1:31:12] where is this taken place my brother and
[1:31:14] sister there are people here today in
[1:31:17] the message saying we're looking for
[1:31:19] that day to happen but you know what
[1:31:21] they're going to make a mistake and are
[1:31:22] making a mistake they're trying to
[1:31:24] manufacture that amen we haven't even
[1:31:27] got unity in the body in the fellowship
[1:31:31] and we're going to try and manufacture
[1:31:33] this why don't we get United in the word
[1:31:37] and let the word produce it in us
[1:31:40] because when the word produces it it
[1:31:43] will last amen it will stand every storm
[1:31:46] every understanding every trial of life
[1:31:48] but when it's manufactured
[1:31:57] you know they manufacture almost
[1:31:58] everything in this day and age
[1:32:00] I've seen some time back in
[1:32:02] advertisement
[1:32:04] for a deal that it's just like oatmeal
[1:32:10] well if it's just like oatmeal wouldn't
[1:32:12] it be oatmeal
[1:32:17] but it's held together with a few
[1:32:18] binders
[1:32:20] which the man who showed it to me says
[1:32:21] I'm pretty sure these are the same
[1:32:23] binders that's in wood glue
[1:32:28] what kind of spirit are we being held
[1:32:29] together with
[1:32:31] come on Grace Tabernacle let it be the
[1:32:33] Holy Ghost That Binds us together as a
[1:32:36] body of Believers not that just oh we
[1:32:38] have a good program we have good
[1:32:40] friendships we have this but let it be
[1:32:42] the Holy Ghost let this not be kind of
[1:32:46] like a real manifestation of God let it
[1:32:49] be a manifestation of God
[1:32:51] no need to be bind bound together with a
[1:32:55] good program
[1:32:56] amen says he'd pour out his uh in those
[1:33:00] days of my spirit and they shall
[1:33:01] prophesy and I will show wonders in
[1:33:04] Heaven above and signs in the earth
[1:33:06] beneath blood and fire and Vapor of
[1:33:09] smoke and the sun shall be turned into
[1:33:11] darkness and the moon into blood before
[1:33:13] that great and notable day of the Lord
[1:33:15] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[1:33:19] I mean that looks pretty dire when you
[1:33:21] look at acts 2. it looks pretty dire my
[1:33:23] brother and sister but we come here now
[1:33:26] in this time it shall come to pass verse
[1:33:30] 21 that whosoever shall call on the name
[1:33:33] of the Lord shall be saved amen not
[1:33:37] standing next to someone who's calling
[1:33:39] on the name of the Lord not standing in
[1:33:42] a church where they're calling on the
[1:33:43] name of the Lord but you and I can
[1:33:46] someone say Amen you and I calling on
[1:33:49] the name of the Lord
[1:33:50] I clipped this out of my sermon but I'm
[1:33:53] sorry I gotta reinsert this I tell you
[1:33:55] what fear and anxiety does it paralyzes
[1:33:58] you
[1:34:00] paralyzes you my brother and sister what
[1:34:03] else could we explain why in the time we
[1:34:06] should be calling on the name of the
[1:34:07] Lord we call on nothing but the banker
[1:34:12] or the doctor
[1:34:17] the word
[1:34:18] is what takes our paralysis away
[1:34:21] the presence of almighty God we can sit
[1:34:25] and say whoa there's problems in the
[1:34:27] church be a part of the solution that's
[1:34:30] not to come with a list of all the
[1:34:32] things wrong that's for you to get down
[1:34:35] on your knees and call out to God and
[1:34:37] say Lord I believe you want us as a body
[1:34:40] of Believers to be in unity and I want
[1:34:43] to be in unity I think I might be right
[1:34:46] but if I'm wrong Lord I Want to Be Right
[1:34:49] I want to be in unity with the body but
[1:34:53] what Satan Dewey does his very best Amen
[1:34:55] to come and bring us to the place
[1:34:59] come on Saints I'm not just preaching to
[1:35:01] myself I've been there
[1:35:02] I'm not just preaching myself he'll come
[1:35:04] on the place we become mute
[1:35:07] when we should be crying out to God
[1:35:10] calling upon the Lord why because we
[1:35:13] have a desire we have a desire to be
[1:35:15] saved do it
[1:35:16] amen when we should be calling on the
[1:35:19] name of the Lord to ensure our Salvation
[1:35:22] Satan gives us mute makes us mute
[1:35:26] we come to the place
[1:35:31] well how's life brother
[1:35:35] would you guys really want to know
[1:35:39] Farm Commodities are down
[1:35:41] anything to do with the replacement part
[1:35:43] has tripled
[1:35:45] fuel has moderated but we already spent
[1:35:48] the 150 000. can't do nothing about that
[1:35:52] can't find anybody that wants to work
[1:35:55] come on if that was my message
[1:35:58] you would grow tired of it so quickly
[1:36:03] I leave that man behind I leave him out
[1:36:06] of the door I leave him because he has
[1:36:08] nothing to do with who I am and who you
[1:36:12] are we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:36:14] Called to a high commission called to a
[1:36:17] high calling and the very same God of
[1:36:19] Abraham is here this morning and Abraham
[1:36:22] my brother and sister had so many
[1:36:24] problems we would never have put him in
[1:36:26] the book as an example but God said I
[1:36:28] use him for the example because I'm
[1:36:30] showing you it had nothing to do with
[1:36:33] you it had all to do with what or who I
[1:36:37] said you were
[1:36:39] and we either have to believe our own
[1:36:41] flesh or we have to believe the word and
[1:36:43] I say Lord help me be in unity to the
[1:36:45] word let me be unified with the word
[1:36:48] amen
[1:36:49] see once again
[1:36:51] just being close
[1:36:53] won't work
[1:37:04] you know you can have a situation
[1:37:08] dire circumstance
[1:37:11] you can be trying to save someone's life
[1:37:15] there'll be an individual standing right
[1:37:16] there

[1:37:19] and that individual will turn
[1:37:23] to no one in particular call an
[1:37:25] ambulance
[1:37:27] and no one
[1:37:28] calls an ambulance
[1:37:32] God didn't send this message my brother
[1:37:34] and sister
[1:37:35] to be some ambiguous message
[1:37:40] it was a message that was targeted right
[1:37:43] to you
[1:37:44] it was a message that was so perfectly
[1:37:47] fit to you then it went to every
[1:37:51] continent Every Nation every household
[1:37:54] of every Providence of ever and targeted
[1:37:57] you

[1:38:01] God that says I want to be in unity with
[1:38:03] you I need you so much I want you so
[1:38:08] much
[1:38:10] amen hallelujah sorry to deviate here
[1:38:14] but it's there my brother and sister you

[1:38:46] those people out there are more sincere
[1:38:48] than you how about if we focus in this
[1:38:51] message here today God there's more
[1:38:53] sincere people than you you guys are
[1:38:54] nothing there's more sincere people than
[1:38:56] you but my brother and sister it wasn't

[1:39:34] amen I'll take care of the details keep

[1:39:42] excited
[1:39:44] amen
[1:39:46] Hallelujah
[1:39:48] oh
[1:39:50] let's just look real quick I need to
[1:39:52] hurry along I got so much stuff here
[1:39:53] this looks like the grand Gourmet
[1:39:55] Amen in the Southern church age
[1:39:58] brother Brown says here
[1:40:00] oh which God's a church we're cold or
[1:40:03] hot best of all she should be fervent
[1:40:05] hot but she is not sentence has been
[1:40:08] passed you know that would almost
[1:40:10] impress us
[1:40:11] the sentence been passed my brother and
[1:40:12] sister but remember I got a quote I
[1:40:15] didn't bring it today but I got a quote
[1:40:17] where the prophet of God says what
[1:40:18] happens is we get hot and we kind of
[1:40:21] drift back down and we start getting
[1:40:23] cooler and cooler a little bit formal we
[1:40:25] get cooler and before God lets us get
[1:40:27] cold he gets us hot again
[1:40:30] and he said this is a cycle
[1:40:32] it's a cycle he typed it back to Israel
[1:40:34] this is cycle Israel but we know if it
[1:40:37] was a cycle a type of Israel it's a type
[1:40:39] of you and I and I think we should this
[1:40:41] a hand and say yep that happens to me I
[1:40:44] get on fire and then things happen and I
[1:40:47] cool off a little bit and then I realize
[1:40:49] whoa somehow or another where'd you go
[1:40:51] Lord where'd you go
[1:40:53] then we get on fire again
[1:40:56] come on am I telling the truth
[1:40:58] amen I I wasn't thinking I was talking
[1:41:00] to AI here or something
[1:41:02] amen we're just programmed to lift the
[1:41:04] hand amen
[1:41:06] amen
[1:41:07] amen
[1:41:11] sentences didn't pass she's no longer
[1:41:12] God's voice to the world
[1:41:16] wow so the church is no longer God's
[1:41:19] voice to the world she will maintain
[1:41:22] that she is but God says not oh God
[1:41:24] still has a voice for the people of the
[1:41:26] world even as he has given a voice to
[1:41:29] the bride can I hear your voice Bride
[1:41:32] Can someone say amen I believe this I
[1:41:36] believe God gave me a voice
[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:42] Hallelujah no voice is in the Bride As
[1:41:46] we said and we'll talk more about that
[1:41:48] later my brother and sister you go right
[1:41:50] into Revelation you'll see the spirit
[1:41:52] and the bride say come so that bride has
[1:41:55] to be in Harmony Harmony and unity to be
[1:41:59] seeing the same thing as the spirit and
[1:42:03] I'm gonna just get a little excited this
[1:42:04] morning God's allowing me to have the
[1:42:07] same voice The Same Spirit of his spirit
[1:42:11] the very life that is in Christ is in me
[1:42:14] and that life gave me his voice
[1:42:18] oh praise the Lord
[1:42:21] that's why this bride should have a
[1:42:23] Revival is having a Revival amen because
[1:42:27] the voice of almighty God is in her
[1:42:30] [Music]
[1:42:33] oh thank you Lord
[1:42:36] now you notice he didn't say the voice
[1:42:38] was in the church
[1:42:42] or whatever name
[1:42:44] is above the door
[1:42:47] we're of this we have it
[1:42:49] we have that we have it
[1:42:52] you see the beauty about preaching a
[1:42:54] message like this is it can be
[1:42:58] ambiguous enough
[1:43:00] that it's not me deciding whether you're
[1:43:02] bride and have a voice or not
[1:43:04] it's you
[1:43:06] deciding whether you're bride
[1:43:09] and whether you have a voice
[1:43:11] so nobody will be able to say brother
[1:43:13] Paul preached and made it sound like I'm
[1:43:16] not bride
[1:43:17] no sir that's your decision
[1:43:20] and if the word says you're not bride I
[1:43:22] think you ought to go back and read it
[1:43:23] again
[1:43:25] huh come on
[1:43:27] God didn't call us out of this gutter of
[1:43:29] laodicea my brother and sister for us to
[1:43:31] sit in church and doubt Who We Are
[1:43:33] God called us from the very beginning
[1:43:35] because I know who you are and all I
[1:43:40] have called shall come
[1:43:43] no I have not lost a single one man that
[1:43:47] ought to be enough to get us excited
[1:43:49] amen it doesn't matter the name above
[1:43:51] the voice the door my brother and sister
[1:43:53] The Voice the Revival
[1:43:56] is in the individual
[1:43:58] people are like well I'll tell you what
[1:44:00] or is a preeminent Message Church
[1:44:03] well your message Church might have some
[1:44:05] preeminent people in it and I can
[1:44:08] declare your whole church it's not
[1:44:09] preeminent
[1:44:11] well I know it's brutal for us to
[1:44:14] acknowledge these things
[1:44:16] but we know what the prophet of God said
[1:44:18] amen
[1:44:19] now I'm not here to put anyone in or out
[1:44:23] I'm here to encourage every one of you
[1:44:26] run the race with all that's within you
[1:44:30] amen
[1:44:31] reminds me of a little story true story
[1:44:33] this little boy little sawed off legs
[1:44:36] couldn't run that fast kind of almost
[1:44:39] required in school to to go out and get
[1:44:43] into a sport and he was in track and he
[1:44:46] ended up in cross country and his little
[1:44:48] short-legged thing all these long-legged
[1:44:50] guys you know and be like me and brother
[1:44:52] Sergey having a race
[1:44:54] yeah
[1:44:55] that isn't a good example neither one of
[1:44:58] us would probably make it to the city
[1:44:59] block and we'd be done
[1:45:00] but
[1:45:03] I was running with all these long legged
[1:45:05] kids and they're just going along he's
[1:45:08] back there
[1:45:10] and he's going along and they're coming
[1:45:11] on the last lap of the course and one of

[1:45:35] people and he ran right by the finish
[1:45:37] line and kept right on going and they're
[1:45:39] like hey come back here
[1:45:43] I'm telling you Saints if I could use
[1:45:45] that as a little example to you don't

[1:45:50] make it for the Finish Line you keep
[1:45:52] running that you cross right over the
[1:45:54] threshold of glory and run right in the
[1:45:57] presence of almighty God Not Looking

[1:46:01] line no sir get anointed you're not
[1:46:05] losers you're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:46:08] and you've been called to carry the
[1:46:11] Revival of the last age message and that
[1:46:15] is not a Revival we're going to carry
[1:46:17] and lay down somewhere that's her
[1:46:20] Revival gives energy and Life to us when
[1:46:23] the devil screams and the world's crying
[1:46:25] and everything's falling apart we can
[1:46:28] say I'm sorry but I gotta finish the
[1:46:31] race I'm not a loser
[1:46:34] Hallelujah
[1:46:36] oh
[1:46:39] can I finish
[1:46:40] amen
[1:46:42] let's look here
[1:46:45] the pergament church age
[1:46:48] notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:46:50] son
[1:46:52] Jesus never did anything it was first
[1:46:54] showed to him by the father
[1:46:56] John 5 19.
[1:46:59] this harmony now exists
[1:47:02] between the groom
[1:47:04] and his pride
[1:47:07] this is not
[1:47:09] for someone else
[1:47:11] well they all go to that church
[1:47:14] they all this they owe that
[1:47:17] the elders in their church this their
[1:47:18] Pastor was that
[1:47:20] forget that my brother and sister amen
[1:47:23] we're here today looking at the harmony
[1:47:25] between us and our bridegroom can
[1:47:29] someone just humor Paul and lift a hand
[1:47:30] and say Lord I want that Harmony I want
[1:47:34] that in my life Lord I want that that's
[1:47:37] something I want to possess
[1:47:40] hey man
[1:47:42] oh he shows her you know brother Branham
[1:47:46] I mean his is very presumptuous I mean
[1:47:48] let's just face it he was almost
[1:47:49] arrogant
[1:47:51] to actually be able to make a claim
[1:47:54] that God
[1:47:56] is going to show his bride
[1:47:59] his word
[1:48:01] don't we need a middleman
[1:48:06] I don't want to drive the point home but
[1:48:08] I think you know where I'm coming from
[1:48:09] do we need a middleman
[1:48:11] amen
[1:48:13] it don't matter what religion there is
[1:48:15] and I'm sorry Even in our midst there
[1:48:18] are those that think we need a middleman
[1:48:21] but I'm here to believe what the prophet
[1:48:22] of God said right there amen the harmony
[1:48:25] now it to exist between the groom and
[1:48:28] the bride he shows her his word of life
[1:48:31] and she receives it are there any
[1:48:33] receivers here today amen I'm receiving
[1:48:36] this from my father amen from my God I'm
[1:48:40] receiving this amen and she receives it
[1:48:43] and she never doubts it
[1:48:45] amen come on therefore nothing can harm
[1:48:48] her not even death for if the seed be
[1:48:52] planted the water will rise up again
[1:48:54] here is the secret of this the word
[1:49:01] has been laid
[1:49:03] on the pulpit in a message Church
[1:49:07] read this again Saints
[1:49:09] the word is in the bride as it was in
[1:49:14] Mary
[1:49:15] come on are you with me
[1:49:17] when the word was in Mary It produced
[1:49:21] Jesus Christ
[1:49:23] oh Hallelujah and the word is in you and
[1:49:26] I today and what are we going to produce
[1:49:28] not another message church not a
[1:49:31] denomination we're going to produce
[1:49:33] Jesus Christ
[1:49:35] and I'll tell you any woman that is
[1:49:37] happy to be married to her husband in a
[1:49:40] natural sense proud to be married to
[1:49:42] this man is happy to carry his seed
[1:49:45] happy to produce that life and this
[1:49:47] little bride here in laodicea is happy
[1:49:50] to be called The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:49:53] she's happy to bring forth Jesus Christ
[1:49:57] again
[1:49:58] oh my
[1:50:01] God the Brian has the mind of Christ for
[1:50:03] she knows what he once done with the
[1:50:06] word
[1:50:07] now
[1:50:08] isn't really the message just for us to
[1:50:10] debate
[1:50:12] we can have you know Debate Club instead
[1:50:14] of Bible study
[1:50:17] we could argue
[1:50:22] I won't go there
[1:50:24] I definitely won't go there
[1:50:26] she performs the command of the word in
[1:50:29] his name for she has thus saith the Lord
[1:50:31] and then the word is quickened by the
[1:50:33] spirit and comes to pass like a seed
[1:50:35] that is planted and watered it comes to
[1:50:37] full Harvest serving its purpose
[1:50:41] you see what God our purpose is
[1:50:43] my brother and sister our purpose is not
[1:50:45] to become Canon fodder to laodicea
[1:50:48] our purpose is not to go out here and
[1:50:50] get so scarred that seems like there's
[1:50:52] nothing in our life worth living
[1:50:56] that's not our purpose
[1:50:58] our purpose is to manifest the very life
[1:51:02] of Jesus Christ amen
[1:51:10] amen
[1:51:12] Church
[1:51:13] Wherever You Are
[1:51:17] what you belong to makes me no
[1:51:19] difference but there's one thing you
[1:51:21] must know we've got to be in Christ or
[1:51:24] you're dead
[1:51:25] you can't live outside of him you're
[1:51:27] right your church might be all right as
[1:51:29] a building your fellowship might be all
[1:51:31] right as a man but when you deny the
[1:51:33] body the blood and the word of Jesus
[1:51:35] Christ you're dead the minute you do it
[1:51:37] it's God's chosen place of worship now I
[1:51:40] hope you're catching what's happening
[1:51:41] here because in a minute you're going to
[1:51:43] kind of catch this little miniature
[1:51:45] bombshell amen it's talking about when
[1:51:48] you deny the body the blood and the word
[1:51:50] of Jesus Christ you're dead the minute
[1:51:51] you do it it's God's chosen place of
[1:51:54] worship
[1:51:56] okay let that sink in
[1:51:58] that's where his name is exactly
[1:52:01] there is where he chose to put his name
[1:52:04] not in church but in the son Jesus
[1:52:07] Christ notice safety lied only in the
[1:52:10] place of his choosing in his lamb in the
[1:52:13] name of the Lamb notice it was a male
[1:52:16] lamb a he not a her not a church she but
[1:52:19] his name not her name where he was going
[1:52:22] to meet the people was not in her name
[1:52:25] but in his name
[1:52:28] him
[1:52:29] the lamb
[1:52:31] oh sorry about that
[1:52:33] now we say the church the Great Mighty
[1:52:35] Church she did this she did that she has
[1:52:38] weighed the storms we've picked up
[1:52:40] population we're great numbers we're a
[1:52:42] mighty Church she's a great thing but
[1:52:44] God never said anything about a she he
[1:52:47] said him him is a meeting place the lamb
[1:52:50] not the church not her name but his name
[1:52:53] he didn't put her name anywhere but he
[1:52:57] put his name in him and that's why all
[1:53:00] we must do in word or deed we must do it
[1:53:03] all in the name of Jesus Christ if we
[1:53:06] pray we got to pray in the name of Jesus
[1:53:08] if we ask a petition we've got to ask in
[1:53:11] the name of Jesus in Jesus name if we
[1:53:14] walk we walk in Jesus name if we talk we
[1:53:16] talk in Jesus name if we baptize we've
[1:53:19] got to baptize in the name of Jesus
[1:53:21] Christ and all that we do in word or
[1:53:24] deed we do it in the name of Jesus
[1:53:27] Christ
[1:53:28] amen my brother and sister Mary shows
[1:53:32] how insignificant that we really are but
[1:53:37] yet we are the greatest thing because
[1:53:39] the prophet of God if you'll bear with
[1:53:41] me and the prophet of God said that a
[1:53:43] Godly wife was the greatest thing that
[1:53:46] could be given to a man Brothers can we
[1:53:49] say Amen
[1:53:50] amen and if the prophet of God making
[1:53:54] that type that the greatest thing that
[1:53:56] could be given to a husband is a Godly
[1:54:00] wife then we are the greatest thing that
[1:54:03] has ever been given to Jesus Christ
[1:54:06] amen he said I'm gonna mold you into
[1:54:10] this very image of my perfect wife I'm
[1:54:14] gonna claim you and I'm gonna mold you
[1:54:16] into that and nothing else not heaven
[1:54:19] it'll pass away not earth it will pass
[1:54:22] away but the word in you oh cannot pass
[1:54:26] away this bride is eternal amen this
[1:54:31] Bride is a very Mind Of God that has
[1:54:34] been expressed to the world
[1:54:36] oh thank you Lord we're not just some
[1:54:38] people trying to make it through I'm
[1:54:41] trying to live right I'm trying to make
[1:54:43] a Rapture you are the word
[1:54:46] amen you are flesh today living the very
[1:54:50] life of God

[1:55:16] screen and
[1:55:17] amen

[1:55:38] hmm
[1:55:40] well

[1:56:31] Jesus Christ for all we do and word or
[1:56:33] deed we do in the name of Jesus Christ

[2:25:05] because you got a long-winded preacher
[2:25:07] but you're still here
[2:25:08] and that just shows that you have a
[2:25:10] hunger for the word of God it's not
[2:25:13] about the man up here it's not about

[2:26:08] excuse me we do not have enough for
[2:26:13] everyone so if you would take it even if
[2:26:16] you took it home bring it back
[2:26:19] um brother Barry
[2:26:21] brother Barry sent out these little
[2:26:23] newsletters about Vision books and I
[2:26:26] want to just be very very clear so there
[2:26:28] is no misunderstanding
[2:26:31] brother Barry's not looking for your
[2:26:33] money
[2:26:34] brother Barry is letting you know or the
[2:26:37] money that's already been given has went
[2:26:41] this is not a solicitation this is not
[2:26:43] something to make us think oh my I I you
[2:26:47] give according to your heart brother
[2:26:48] Berry shared this because it's kind of a
[2:26:52] testimony
[2:26:53] to to the saints that have given and
[2:26:56] this church has given I'll keep it
[2:26:58] simple this church has given many
[2:26:59] thousands to this work and it's here if
[2:27:03] you look and and uh brother vasili would
[2:27:06] you just step up here real quick so when
[2:27:08] the people leave and put these on the
[2:27:10] table back there people could look at
[2:27:12] them they sent us I think 12 of them so
[2:27:15] obviously not enough for everyone to
[2:27:17] take one home and keep it uh but when
[2:27:20] you look in this you'll see a little
[2:27:22] introduction of talking about running
[2:27:25] with the message talking about the
[2:27:27] countries all over quite a list across
[2:27:30] here let's see that's uh five deep one
[2:27:32] two three four five six seven eight uh
[2:27:35] so roughly there's 39 countries the
[2:27:38] vision books has made it impact some
[2:27:40] countries have not had a new message
[2:27:41] book
[2:27:43] in 17 years
[2:27:45] and the message is now coming and the
[2:27:48] impact right of vision
[2:27:51] Malawi
[2:27:53] they're now got a vision to print their
[2:27:55] own to press forward the it's blessing
[2:27:58] the Saints so much and so you'll see
[2:28:01] here when you glance through this and my
[2:28:04] brother and sister I want you to see
[2:28:05] it's there in Malawi and sharing these
[2:28:08] different countries and we're not
[2:28:10] lifting up brother Barry we're not
[2:28:12] lifting up Vision books
[2:28:15] but this was just a little brief thank
[2:28:17] you that brother Berry could print very
[2:28:19] inexpensive and share that you would
[2:28:22] know what is happening with the dollars
[2:28:25] that you give his offerings and I wanted
[2:28:28] to bring this to your attention once
[2:28:30] again in a transparency that you would
[2:28:33] know what we are doing with the money
[2:28:35] that you give to Grace Tabernacle
[2:28:39] we want to support that I have a letter
[2:28:41] at home from Brother George talking
[2:28:43] about a half a dozen countries that
[2:28:47] um the ministry of
[2:28:50] [Music]
[2:28:52] it's brother George's
[2:28:55] Believers International flavor is
[2:28:57] international
[2:29:00] are doing we want to support this
[2:29:02] we don't want to isolate ourselves and
[2:29:05] just sit down and say they're there
[2:29:07] we're here we want to support it
[2:29:09] whatever country it is
[2:29:11] I'll just give you an idea I'm sorry to
[2:29:13] draw you out but Years Ago by God's
[2:29:15] grace when they had earthquakes in Chile
[2:29:18] this devastated we got to see the damage
[2:29:23] and by God's grace we raised here you
[2:29:26] might say through Grace Tabernacle tens
[2:29:28] of thousands of dollars that we sent to
[2:29:30] Chile
[2:29:32] Brothers contacted me and said brother
[2:29:34] Paul is this money only for people
[2:29:36] who as it were believed the message like
[2:29:39] us
[2:29:42] God forbid
[2:29:44] God forbid
[2:29:46] it's not for me to decide
[2:29:49] and the money the support
[2:29:52] went to churches that had many different
[2:29:54] doctrinal points of view of the message
[2:29:58] and I got to be a recipient of grown
[2:30:01] pastors men who maybe doctorally did not
[2:30:04] agree
[2:30:05] exactly where we stood
[2:30:07] come crying on your neck saying thank
[2:30:10] you
[2:30:12] for displaying the love of Christ to us
[2:30:14] restoring houses in churches and things
[2:30:18] like that and my brother and sister as I
[2:30:21] said not a solicitation for money but we
[2:30:23] just want you to know God's doing a
[2:30:25] mighty work
[2:30:27] said it would be a powerful work in the
[2:30:29] end time
[2:30:30] and God is moving in countries he's
[2:30:32] using every tool he's using technology
[2:30:34] he's using all this stuff Brothers
[2:30:37] interpreting translating all of this
[2:30:40] stuff with all this latest voice over
[2:30:42] technology all these things it used to
[2:30:44] take forever to do is being done very
[2:30:47] brief and the scripture said it would be
[2:30:49] a short quick work I say God let us be a
[2:30:54] part of a short quick work God bless you
[2:30:57] Saints we love you in the Lord sorry
