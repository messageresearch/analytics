amen that's what it is just a change hallelujah but the change has already got to be in here to have that one amen praise the lord amen before we go to prayer 123 i want god's way you want god's way well but it's a harder way amen how many say that too oh well and then i'm willing to bear that amen thank god i say that with all of our hearts why why why because it's a duty no why because it's what others are going to think no why i don't want to preach excuse me i'm not why because you love him because he first loved me and he loved you amen amen i want god's way to be my way you know his way his perfect way is his word amen amen i want god's way to be my way as i journey here below for there is no other highway that a child of god should go over all these deep and rough if he leads me tills enough amen i want god's way to be my way every day that's that right i want god's way to be my way as i turn i want your perfect will or there is no other highway that a child of god should go though the road if he leads me it's enough i want god's way to be my way every day one more time oh i want god's way that's my desire as i journey here below for there is no other highway that a child of god should go though the road be steep and run as he leads me it's enough i want god's way to be my way every day how by denying yourself take up your cross and follow him amen i want god's way amen not not my way in his way i want his way amen amen amen if you'll stand with me we have several prayer requests here tonight just to mention also i want to mention to announce that there's a work day saturday morning i think it's around 7 00 80 we'll kind of try to find that out from brother isaac and maybe some of you already know you know i don't know but if any questions you can check with brother isaac on that for saturn this coming saturday the seventh and then we want to remember brother sergey and his mother in prayer that uh god would just continue to direct their path direct their way and uh give them strength give them healing body physical strength and just know how to answer know how to speak amen let's just remember them in prayer sister jerry mom jerry grandma jerry however you want to refer to her she's all of that to us so just remember her in prayer i know that gets lonely but just continue to remember that god would just stir her hearts or her soul and just keep her just ever present every remembrance of him every day amen brother vasily he's out in the in the on the road so let's remember him sister tomah in ukraine remember her in prayer and then also brother jason has found out that he's been exposed to some coveted work and that's why he decided he probably shouldn't i guess he thought he didn't know for sure if he was but he thought that's the way he kind of said it to me in the proximity so he felt like he just hold off for maybe two or three days four days maybe sunday or whatever if the lord lord wills and just see what you know kind of so he doesn't become a carrier amen so and that's why their family is not here and then also um a lot of that brother paul wants to mention our brother you know about sister karen's passing and uh i know brother paul has something to say about that and also a brother brother hugo vega too and um and then also let's remember brother donnie's church and the and the saints there because and there's i i've been told there's about a hundred that are sick and there's about 11 of them are in the hospital so let's just keep that in prayer and things are and there's many i've heard of others that have passed here recently and brother stephen francis in in south africa and i guess he has a memorial service this saturday and then also a brother from wichita kansas a brother i can't think of his first name you remember that first name i think a pastor there in wichita leaving a family to end the message so just remember them as many let's just pray that god will just keep us strong in the word looking at the fact that all things work together for good to them to love god and hold that word forth amen before us in in complete trust because god knows how to how to do things just right he allows things but we just pray that god will just remember us in these things and them also amen and then see if i'm forgetting anything oh kristen nash had that request for brother carl maybe we prayed for carl and his wife his wife's out of the hospital yeah but carl is still in the hospital i see you with pneumonia so we want to remember him i don't know if he had kind of a setback or what but let's remember him in prayer and also dyna and i would like you to remember our daughter sarah she's also been diagnosed with covid and just keep her in prayer and then andrew i don't think he's had been checked but he's he's not feeling well has been feeling bad and he said that he possibly had him and her dog our granddaughter abigail has been diagnosed so and they never had that originally and so whatever i just know that god's in control we pray that god whatever it takes you know for unsaved not unsaved i i know abigail and and sarah my boy nathan are saved i can't call them unsaved they are saved they're backslid but blacksliding doesn't unsave you you may lose a reward but it doesn't unsave you amen so so just remember them i believe god will and has to bring them back because we lay a token before over them and i know brother others believe the same thing so brother chris why don't you come and take this prayer request to the lord amen spyroads heavenly father lord jesus

storms he brought me through for if i'd never had a problem i wouldn't know that he could solve them i'd never know what faith in god could do amen we know it's a lot more than that he has a way to get us out from here in the new body amen amen he develops his character doesn't he amen and the first verse there has something else about it i've had many tears sorrows questions of tomorrow there have been things i didn't know right from wrong but in every situation god gave me blessed consolation that in my trials might that my trials only come to make me strong amen so let's sing this one more time this course it's our brother through it all [Music] through it all i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned to trust in god through it all through it all i've [Music] man good to be here this evening saints amen i want to just take just a moment here at the beginning just to kind of speak a little bit you know we we see the signs my brother and sister of the day that we're living in and you know it just seems in the last little bit we have just had a tremendous amount of brothers and sisters going you know over passing on to the other side into the presence of the lord and um you know i was invited uh by some brothers to be part of a little uh chat thing you know and in that you know there's just a lot of a lot of things that comes about and there has been all over the world uh a tremendous amount of pastors of ministers that have passed away and just these last three or four months you know you look at that some of them are elderly but some of them in just days or you might say short weeks before they passed away were just healthy you know full of vitality and just going and then they're gone and we know this one thing that we cannot pass from this life without god's approval amen there's no accidents to sons and daughters of god there's no just circumstance we are not that's why we are while we are not foolish while we are not careless we still know that things like coven now i was listening to a little deal today and this government official was saying the people should be afraid and so look at the spirit that's on the earth today but see we're not afraid because all fear has been taken from us but yet we have because of our stewardship as sons and daughters of god we have a healthy respect you know as it is we wash our hands from their jason sister emmy not here tonight but i'm sorry to tell you i hugged brother jason yesterday and i think brother ivan did too or you know anyway all the timing of these things you see um but we trust more in god we're not fearing this we're trusting in the lord amen so as you i had shared on the church site uh with you sister karen pruitt has gone to be with the lord this morning you know sister karen i never really knew her myself sister jerry had opportunities in louisiana camp uh to establish a friendship and she's just a loving lovely loving sister just always there to help and encourage and as brother tim's love affair of all these years um let's not just pray for him for a day or two remember him it's going to be difficult remember him in the next few weeks or months and you know a loving family a church family there just very close and you know sometimes we don't really know how to express this because when you see someone suffering you know you kind of feel like lord just heal them or take them home and still the the pain of the separation is great and so just remember them and also our brother hugo vega ricomi uh first pastor in south america to open up a pulpit to me uh specifically we traveled there with um my niece and nephew uh and with my brother-in-law uh we're happy to have you guys with us amen uh traveled down there in that first part of south america with my brother brother flint and um brother hugo opened that and just a very loved brother and um here again some health issues and then cove would come along and people are like sad oh this has taken him but remember this is all in god's time everything that happens in god's time we need to remember that there's not one portion of our life that should not be based on god's time amen i know when we go to rush things in our life uh we can look back and say lord i wish i'd have been on your time instead of my own so remember uh their family um just the little church there they do have a minister brother that has been very faithful uh in lifting up the saints there and uh freidy and um so just remember brother hugo's family and the church also amen i'd like to speak to you tonight on the wisdom of the prudent and it's kind of funny because we were talking about we were joking a little bit with the brothers about part whatever thank you sister ruth about part whatever and uh so i just left off the age-old proverbs tonight just to break that up a little bit there's no part anything here and uh so we're just going to talk tonight for a few minutes on the wisdom of the prudent and so i want you to look as we come into this scripture you're going to find what would be seemingly a paradox of the words and so we have to remember as brother branham brought it out the rain falls on the just and the unjust and so we look at this and whatever is you might say an attribute of the bride you're going to find very similar attributes in the world today you will find people that don't even claim to be christians that live very very very moral lives and raise their kids without television without rock and roll without these things but you see my brother and sister it's not just us living a good life it's not just our goal because as it would be somebody can satisfy that but what we are here is the manifestation of jesus christ in the day that we live that's what we were called for saints not just to live good moral lives because you can find as i've jokingly shared about carrie the hippie that sister jerry and i knew years ago right i'm just sure she has to be a christian she's got long hair always wears dresses but she's just like i'm sorry to disappoint you i'm just a hippie and so you know here she is a modest hippie because not all hippies are modest right so you know probably the majority of hippies are not modest but here is a lady that that just something in her this is what she manifested that did not make her a christian that did not mean that she was on the right track in life and so uh and in fact i'll put it the other way often times satan likes to come in to the very bride of christ and tempt us to let down our standard because he knows by getting us to lower our standard then that he has access to to our life in a in a greater fashion and so um oh i i have right here i just want to put this out now i think i have this correct uh sister sarah you guys are having a fellowship at your house saturday afternoon is it five five o'clock and then i know there was another i got confused about this reason i wanted to bring clarity to you i believe there's another fellowship on sunday afternoon and i'm not sure where that's at um so it's somewhere um uh anyway so there is a sunday fellowship so let's not get the two confused as brother paul did so anyway let's just stand my brother and sister and we'll go into the word tonight and i will find tonight we'll be dealing with both sides of the prudent we will look at this from both angles tonight and both of them from the scripture uh and so as we look let's just go to uh proverbs uh chapter 14. now this is a scripture i used in just a couple services back uh but i wanted to drive home as we're just looking at this from the position of wisdom and the prudence uh proverbs 14 8 the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way now my brother and sister this isn't necessarily declaring a man filled with the holy ghost but you will find that when we come in the presence of god and he starts to change our life we become prudent we become because you see the word prudent means careful in his way or concern of the future so when we get closer to god we become more and more prudent with our lives we do not make irrational decisions to come back to fix them see that's why some of our trials that we're facing are as god's knocking can i put it this way sounds kind of almost irreverent but god's knocking the nonsense out of us amen the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way but the folly of fools is deceit fools make a mock at sin i think my brother and sister we live in a world full of fools but among the righteous there is favor now i i'm not going to come back and make great emphasis on that so i just hold you for a moment is this not true do we not find favor in the sight of god look around our life my brother and sister you say but i i we labor we work hard we this we that we you know maybe have to mind every penny in our budget and we have to i'm sorry you just stop and look around you look at your background look at your nature look at the world you're living in and you'll realize very quickly we have found favor in the eyes of god the heart knoweth his own bitterness and a stranger does not inter-medal with his joy the house of the wicked shall be overthrown but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death lord we ask for your blessings tonight upon your word father for every brother every sister every need father we just ask you come father for you are ever present help in the time of trouble and lord we know that you are our provider we commit these things to you in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now prudent is someone who has or shows good careful judgment now my brother and sister i think it's good that we could uh uh that we could know you know sometimes in life uh we have question marks we have things that uh we look out and say lord i i don't know exactly what direction to go i don't know exactly you know to to do this and and you know just having this conversation recently sometimes we're like do a a job do i do this or do i do that you see it's always just great in the natural let's just look at it for a moment from the natural isn't it no nice to just know to what right thing to do just to do it you know you go and i just know this is what is what i need to do and so you know in that oftentimes we do have you might say the green light where we just simply know uh this is what i need to do and it's good because when we can step in that realm and operate without a doubt you know doubt is like a drain upon your spirit doubt is uh and i'm not talking about doubt as in doubting your your faith i'm talking about you know am i doing the right thing you know almost like you know going to buy a car say and you look at the car and should i should i commit myself do i really want to uh you know spend uh i i'm from way back so you guys will have to forgive me but do i want to spend you know 250 dollars a month that's the one no radio no bumpers no headliner uh do i do i want to do that see and when you go into that with a doubt when you go in there to a question mark you'll ask actually find you've sowed the seed of buyer's remorse right because you're going to go home and the doubt has not been erased but let's just for this scenario take this you know you've budgeted you've saved you you have done all the right things and literally you're looking for a ten thousand dollar car and you have ten thousand dollars and so you go and you find the car with low miles it turned out to be you know mom's car and she just didn't drive much and it's had maintenance done and everything is perfect perfect tires and brakes and upholstery and paint and and you like this is the car and and you have no problem just stepping into that situation and so when we can eliminate as it were the doubt in our life when we can step beyond that now my brother and sister having said that i want you to understand that there's a certain amount of the things of life that we're always going to face uh that is going to have a second guess you might say a little question mark or something associated with it but you know to go here into the spiritual realm it is good to know without a doubt where we stand amen it's good to know that when we are moving forward and we read in the word and it shows us that every promise in this book is mine that you don't have any doubt that you can reach out and take a holds of that promise and god will honor that now very very a multitude of places brother branham talks about this he says now when we have met all the qualifications so my brother and sister there is a requirement on god's part that we can't just randomly live some sloppy life and come in and just claim all these promises of god in fact brother branham kind of invites a bunch of pentecostal preachers for having sloppy pulpits and then questioning why god is not moving in the midst of the church and so there is a certain qualification or quantifying that god requires amen but i want to put this thought to you tonight and and please don't take this as a die hard i just want to stir your thinking i think it might be good if we would pray for understanding just as much as we pray for results you see sometimes we ask god i put my hand up first so nobody will be embarrassed about where we're going here we want god to do this on this day in this way hey that almost rhymed and then it doesn't happen that way and then we start to doubt but you see what it is is we we were trying to prescribe to god what his will would be what his desire to us would be and because we approach the promises of god from our natural way because we are human then we would be looking at the promise and we say this is what god must have meant he said i'll be your provider now i hope you don't mind a little humor tonight but it would be lord my provider do i want a blue or a gray escalade maybe god says i'm just going to give you wheels so you don't walk but you see we're disappointed when it doesn't work out so to pray for understanding my brother and sister would be for us to be into the very mind and spirit of god to be praying saying lord thy will be done lord thy will not my will father i want to get in and understand lord what it is you want for me and my brother and sister look at the confidence that we walk in when we are in the will of god when the scripture says that he that doesn't have condemnation amen is god an unlimited outlet of the power of almighty god but satan comes and he looks at us and says i can limit him here and i can let him limit them here and here and here and by the time he's done with his limiting effect we my brother and sister come to church downtrodden i don't know i thought this is what i thought this i thought that but if we can get into the realm where we have the mind of god when we can walk in the realm that we can look at the scripture and say even though i have to say ouch tonight this is the truth and i'm going to live it amen and so then we come into and the understanding of what it is god desires for us now this goes much deeper than we'll touch tonight but my brother and sister we cannot fully grasp the authority that god has given us until we come to an understanding of the authority we can't randomly just say well i'm going to claim this in the name of jesus christ why are you claiming it what is the reason you're claiming it that's why oftentimes i hope you can understand so i just want to touch this just a little bit you can come sometimes and you can lay hands and pray for someone else and god will move and answer that prayer and you know for a fact that god answered the prayer in the way you prayed it you know that you were a part of what god just did but yet we will pray over things in our life you will find this in brother branham's own sickness in his own body he's praying for people they're being healed and he's claiming this and then suffering through this sickness my brother and sister you see what god is doing sometimes is he is allowing you to be a channel but we don't fully understand the whole equation and it's not just us we abide our faith with one another but remember the prophet of god taught that when they come see it's not my faith it's their faith so what we got to do is understand the moving of the power of god is not just understanding we can lay hands and people will be healed we can lay hands and people will be delivered it goes much deeper than that amen i hope you are you with me tonight so i say this again i think we should this is just my feelings oh i used that word didn't i feelings this is the way i see it we probably should pray for understanding more right maybe we can put that right there on the list just underneath patience but to pray for understanding because you see so many people saints are are uh kind of i'm going to use the word disturbed because they prayed and they prayed and they prayed and it doesn't seem like god is answering their prayer but partly it's because we're not understanding what god is trying to accomplish in our own life now you can go study it in the message you'll see where brother brown says i have to be careful when i go praying for people for deliverance because sometimes god allows these things to come on people to move them from their position and brother brown says i have to be careful about praying for deliverance so you're going to understand the will of god now god never put sickness upon a human people are like oh god let me get sick no he didn't but god pulled his hedge back and he let the devil who would love to make you sick come in and god says that's no problem because i know i have delivering power i know that i can change this situation but i need something to move this individual who is oh not you but people like you stubborn and overly determined and overly think we're right and overly think we're righteous and overly think that right there's a way that seemeth right that's correct so we have to understand that and i know brother david brother chris would know this as ministers there's been times saints i have prayed for people and i've fully determined when i laid hands on it i was just gonna cast that devil out or just claim it in the name of jesus christ and you find yourself praying lord thy will be done that's all you can do because there's something there that you recognize is checking you from taking the word and driving the devil away because you realize there's something just comes over you that god's doing something here all i want lord for this individual is your will be done that doesn't mean we love them any less or have any less desire to see them delivered but we're not here to contest as it were with god over what we want to accomplish and so it is there oftentimes i think that we come as a results-oriented oriented preacher we're praying with a goal orient we're this is lord this is what am i making sense we come and we have a very specific we're praying to the lord very specifically and there's nothing wrong with that saints but we need to as the word of god shows us brother random emphasis we need to say you know what lord thy will lord if you are willing lord so that we're not coming and saying you know what i prayed for brother so and so i prayed for sisters so and so and it didn't seem like god answered my prayer no no don't let the devil get that god answers prayer sayings and sometimes we're looking at the big picture and god's moving in the background amen what we don't need see this has happened so much in days gone by i pray it's not happening now but we when the days gone by there used to be great sweeping meetings and a lot of people young and old come and they got baptized and they made commitments and they did all this but there was no real conversion and so it was there that by the will of man people felt compelled to come to the water be baptized do all of these things but nothing really changed and what god wants is to start down in the background at the bedrock and he wants something within the soul not an emotional compelling not an emotional oh you don't want to go to hell don't don't do that we don't want to do that the will of god is something down in the inside says you know what i love you lord i want to serve you lord and and see that's where people don't understand when brother branham said you know what i even if i knew he was going to send me to hell i would still serve him it's because down in the very depths of that was a love for the things that god has done for his love to us his grace his mercy his blood and if somehow we recognize i'm coming up short of the goal lord it's not your fault help me lord but see people become angry now i won't ask anybody to raise a hand but it's more frequent than we realize that people become angry at god because prayers are not being answered and situations are not changing i've got a husband i've got a wife i've got children i've got parents i've got a friend and lord nothing's happening why aren't you answering me maybe they need to pass through the fire one more time maybe they need to go through the struggle of life one more time maybe god wants to take them to the brink of extinction so that he can bring them back so that they will never forget who they are and why they are here hallelujah it's hard my brother and sister and you think serving god is heart disco serve the devil and he will use you abuse you and trash you and abandon you people are like well it's just too hard being a christian wow wow look what the devil's got in store now trying to find myself here brother alex did we not get the paradox put in there we didn't okay that's fine no no problem at all i just didn't want to so in the message the paradox 61 12 10 brother branham says this it was a paradox when a great soldier of god by the name of jehoshaphat stood in the gates with a backslidden man by the name of ahab and said before we go to this battle is is not it a good thing that we consult the lord now look at this he he's going and he's something's compelling him to say i think we better stop and we better pray for understanding of the will of god is this something we should do or should we go home or whatever it might be now brother branham i brought this for these words right here so i'll read it real slow so i catch it now if that man's heart is hungry to know the will of god there's got to be a will of god somewhere now remember what brother branham taught us he preached this deep call to the deep so if there's something deep within the soul of a man or a woman to cry out to god there's got to be something there to answer this and now brother brown takes this same i'm going to use the word theory so forgive me if it isn't quite the right way brother branham takes this what would be the right word brother brown takes this context he takes this uh this principle this pattern would that be better put it that way he takes this and now he's applying this that if there's something in your heart that is desiring to know the will of god god's got a will expressly for you not some blanket will you know go to church be faithful pray read your bible but something specific for you now i believe it's the same my brother and sister he says that those that hunger and thirst after righteousness will be filled so if we're hungry and thirsty after the will of god for our life for our church our family whatever the situation might be then god's got a specific answer for you and i to guide us into his will have you ever suffered from the uncertainty of life and when i use that word suffer i mean suffer now i'll bring this back don't feel sorry for us i just feel like a use an example that's not one of you there was a time in our life sister jerry and i lost so much money several years in a row that had finally come up to the fact we weren't bankrupt we had more assets than we had debts but when your wife comes to you and says paul we have 80 000 worth of bills and we have seventy eight hundred dollars in the bank uh what do you want me to do and you get up every morning with an uncertainty of life to compound this we had a man who showed up at seven o'clock every thursday morning wanting to know when are you going to pay the money me i was so frustrated i wanted to grab him choke him throw him off the step put him back in his car push it down the hill my wife was like paul it's not the right thing and then she'd turn to this man and say you realize it's still you know whatever it was 46 days till we owe the money i know but this is my job and if i don't do my job they fire me and i've got a mortgage i'm going to be knocking on your door every thursday morning because i got a mortgage to pay okay good talk about uncertainty you know what happened saints i'll tell you just very briefly what happened paul was headed this direction turning into a wreck my wife was headed this direction saying god's in control paul don't forget god's in control all i could think of saints was everything i've worked for for years here is going away now that seems to be what happened right but i tell you what happened was behind the scenes god was making things in his supernatural realm take place and when it got really close that it looked like it was just going to be toast i finally resigned myself to the fact that this is always going to be over and this might be god's will so okay whatever and then the supernatural started coming a check from the bean company because and i won't go into all these details because of an issue and a check from a man that we had sold uh hey to that had uh uh you know was there was an issue as it was he told me like he could buy hay all day long at this price and then he went shopping for hay and realized that he had to pay considerably more and something stirred a dutchman to write a check for the difference and send it to me now this is a good man and i respect him right we're not talking about him but something stirred him and he was like i told you something and basically it was a lie here's a check for i don't remember the numbers now twenty thousand dollars not pocket change not fifty bucks but you see god moving in the background god doing what god does now my brother and sister i've used natural examples here but i'm telling you that is this the tip of the iceberg because god does deal in the natural but god specializes in the spiritual amen so while he's working in the natural he specializes in the spiritual amen so what it is my brother and sister if we suffer from the uncertainty of life it drains the joy from us and satan boy don't you know he wants you as a christian just to be down and out and pouty and life is horrible and nothing's going right in my life and whatever that's what satan desires so he's trying to drain the joy from you but when you come to the place that you have a certainty and that certainty might be all the rest of this is going to go away we might lose everything we own but i am a son of god i'm a daughter of god and you have that certainty suddenly all the things of the natural diminish in your sight and you realize it's not about that anyway it's not about what we possess in the natural but the fact that i have a certainty by the word of god that i am a son of god i'm a daughter of god and this work he began in me he is going to finish it hallelujah change your whole perspective you can say oh lord whatever it is amen when you come to that place now i hope you catch where i'm going right here you can come to the place that in the natural life so let's just talk about your finances the natural life there may be uncertainty of paying the mortgage or paying the rent or whatever it is there might be uncertainty there but you come to a place that you can walk in liberty because you have a certainty and because you know that you are anchored in that word of god and and you're able to take that and say oh lord thank you thank you lord i know what your will is it wasn't for me to be this super middle class or well-off or whatever it wasn't for me to be this or to be that it was for me to be a son or daughter of god and manifest the word in the laodicean age of all the people there is you chose me and i have a certainty i know it's the will of god that i live victorious that i live with praise on my lips and i live with a liberty in jesus christ hallelujah can somebody say lord let me know thy will amen that's what we want to know my brother and sister because when you know you're walking in the will of god you know you're walking and you are there now look you can go look this up study it for yourself i i could use it in another sermon but you can also study this out look at what brother branham talks about when people move over into the permissible will of god they're not lost i thought brother david you was going to preach my sermon for me tonight my brother and sister you get over there see we we can get in the permissible will of god and and that doesn't mean as it would be backslid doesn't mean god's just threw you off in the dumpster and you're gone but my brother and sister that permissible will is in no way the same as walking in that perfect will of god and i lift my hand hands tonight and say lord help me walk in thy perfect will let me walk lord according to that let me understand what your will is for my life because you might be there and all of that would be fine but my brother and sister if we're gonna walk well i've always put it this way i don't know where i come up with this maybe i plagiarized it but i'm telling you you're going to give your life now or then but you're going to give your life oh wouldn't it be much better just give our life as a bride of christ a walk in liberty knowing the will of god then to come and realize lord i wasted all those years and the persecution as it would we all have concepts of what the tribulation would be like i'm not trying to define that but to find yourself there knowing lord i messed up i missed it oh god i know i know that i am yours lord i know but yet unwilling here to give it god help us yes god help us to break through that self will that stubborn spirit that holds us back and i'm telling you this evening i hope it don't shake you or or make you nervous but i got both hands up saying lord help us amen not to be looking at all of the things around us right now and forgetting the supernatural now in the message be certain of god isn't that what we want to be see if you're certain of god you can take his word for anything he says amen and that beautiful but you see we can't do this if we're on the fence that's right you're not going to be able to take everything that god says to you if you're on the fence if one day you're on fire and the next day you're cold as ice boy isn't the devil like to do that if you're certain of god you can take his word for anything he says if you're not certain that he is god and this is a bible then you'd better be careful of what you're doing and i want to tie this back my brother and sister to kind of into this original scripture here uh in proverbs amen the wisdom of the prudent is understand his way but the folly of fools is deceit now in that folly of fools my brother and sister is someone hiding the truth from you amen the folly of fools is when they would give you something less than the truth when the truth would serve even them better but see there's an anointing there we're going to take this message and we're going to chop it up and we're only going to serve to you pardon me you get this little portion you get this little portion you get this little portion when we can hand out the hole amen let me just mimic it this way we can hand out the hole and there's still the hole to hand out it's not like we're gonna run short amen there's no shortage of the holy ghost in our lives amen there's no shortage of the word of god waiting to be manifested the presence of god waiting to come into our midst no shortage but you see there will be those that are anointed my brother and sister to deceive my heart actually goes out to that people that have to go and and when you question them show me in the bible they just skip off to something else because they can't back it up now if you can't find it here how are you going to know the will of god concerning it or if there is another interpretation and you respect this is the thing that catches people i respect brother so and so and uh what he's saying doesn't fit the bible but i respect him and so then you give his word equal weight to the bible yeah that's it that's not what the prophet said is it he said you take everything amen back to scripture that means as much as i love brother david i have to take everything brother david said back to scripture as much as i love brother chris's ministry i go to take everything back to scripture and i would hope that you would say the same thing concerning myself amen so you look at this see then you'd be better be careful what you're doing but if you're certain meet his requirements see this isn't a free ride oh we're in the message we got a free ride no we don't meet his requirements then faith takes it solemn rest oh faith cannot be based upon the shifting sins of man's theology but faith takes its solemn stand upon the eternal everlasting rock of god's eternal faith and there it rests unmovable now i've often brought this in a fashion saints and i i don't ever want to be irreverent but you know i'm sure there's a lot of people out here that sing the song i shall not be moved but they don't sing it with the same thought that you and i do amen i believe this and you ain't moving me no matter what i don't care god comes and shakes it down and there's ample evidence that's what i'm i shall not be moved but look at this now a real believer comes upon the eternal everlasting rock of god's eternal faith their arrests unmovable it knows that god is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him isn't that beautiful you know how diligently seeking him can be saints can i just not try to look down or whatever upon your intelligence and understanding right i'm not trying to look down on anyone but you know what diligently seeking him is seeking him in everything often time the diligence of seeking him can be something that people go you pray about that yes i do because i want to understand god's will for me amen i don't want god's will in just big things or god's will when i'm sick i want god's will in everything there's where the diligence of seeking him what is that absolutely brother david almost started preaching on it i'll tell you that's absolutely putting god first in everything and dying out to our own thoughts on everything boy that's hard isn't it come on let's be honest with one another that's hard we get ideas you know you know you get an idea on something and and you're like oh i want to buy one of these and you'll find yourself on craigslist you're looking for one of those you look for one of those every day and pretty soon you get the idea i don't think god wants me to have one of those now might be a multitude of reasons you think i can spend 250 dollars and there's not one on craigslist for less than 500. the devil's there what's another 250. and that could go into a whole whole thing jerry's over there laughing she's like hi you're preaching about yourself always yeah amen now look at this saints so as we come to this we'll see now that if we are have that kind of certainty we can come to this place with such a caution such a a a desire to look into the future we're looking there we're saying okay now what is this i want lord i want to do i want to make a decision today lord that actually blesses my family tomorrow i want to do today church when i speak to you i want to lay something that might be a benefit to you tomorrow or the next day or next week or next month see we can anybody can preach the flowery stuff and i don't say this in any kind of mockery or whatever but anyone can get up here and lay out the whole platform of god's center prophet and we can get excited about that i'm glad he sent him saints we i don't know what we'd be maybe we'd still be methodists but you see there's more to that we can get beyond it why did god send a prophet people are like oh god send a prophet all these people look what it's going to do but you know what when you really read malachi you'll realize sister kerry god sent a prophet just to you just to you just to you just to you see it wasn't that it's like oh he goes forget the whole world saints forget everybody else in the church behold i send you malachi 4. amen i send you elijah the prophet why because we had specific needs that had to be met and by the preaching of the word it isn't just a prophet's word to you but you find that it's the will of god being revealed this is actually a revelation that is coming out when you see the will of god for your life people like oh i never saw that scripture before but i'm telling you what's just equally exciting to me is when someone in the body of believers eyes is open and they actually one day realize what this whole thing is about it's not me coming and conforming and this and that this is god himself saying i am unrolling the red carpet from this point all the way into eternity for you and you realize that down in your soul that that's what god's doing he's making a way he said i will make the way smooth before you as the devil drives around throwing all the rocks out and we say man life is hard well i tell you what if god gave you a supernatural vision of what it was compared to what the devil has for you that's smooth amen and you know what the bane of christians are of christians is laziness that's the bane of christians we get lazy that's why god lets the wheels fall off your car so that you don't just get up oh lord bless our day thank you you actually stop and say lord we need you around here we need you lord you see that's his will if you want an example i don't preach it tonight in fact i want to stop uh but you just go look what brother branham just go look read job and then go look at what brother brown says about job you'll see that job was a perfect man in the eyes of god but god was going to prove himself amen okay let's let's hurry up hurry on here real quick and uh first corinthians 1 and 18. now we're going to look here at what this wisdom and prudence and uh foolishness all right here in this few scriptures is very condensed down it's just beautiful for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness so we have a whole class of people that this is all foolishness to i was talking to a gentleman a few days ago and he was like well what kind of church do you have and i thought might as well just get this conversation over with we are holiness oh then paul just acts like he doesn't have a clue he just comes stumbling right along well you know holiness is all through the bible in fact god even described himself in holiness uh yeah okay uh look saints know you speaking around the bush there are some people that the preaching of the cross is holding us part of the preaching of the cross amen we serve a righteous god a holy god amen so to the preaching of the cross it's to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god oh i tell you what we're probably going to have to preach on high heels here in the church seems like we've had an invasion now i don't know if we compare them to grasshoppers or mormon crickets or mosquitoes but you know it just seems like they get in the room and they just spread out my brother and sister i'm not against anybody i love everybody that comes this church but are we are we a message church now you don't have to but i'm just going to tell you if you want to go spend some time just go study what the prophet of god said about high heels and if i don't want to scar your eyes i could give you a demonstration come on the prophet of god said mincing you know what that means i won't follow it through so i scar you but mincing is the action and movement of the body meant to entice that's exactly right now some people will be upset you know the preachers preach it on on clothesline religion or something like that is it clothesline or is it the gospel we can call it clothesline and then think it's petty or whatever or we can preach the gospel now i know it's only half the church here tonight but i mean do you want brother branham you know says i'm deviating i'm sorry but brother brown says you know that the problem we have is weak pulpit praise the lord if all those people quit because they don't want to hear it means you guys will just have to pay twice as much but no problem no that's the problem do you get what i'm being facetious about people are worried about who's going to pay the bills more than they are about who's going to make the rapture let's get this in its right proportion god will take care of the bills we want to be ready for the rapture for his written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and i will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent so now we have this group of people saints this is why i brought that little disclaimer to you we have a group of people that are thinking for the future and they might be right in the church they're like well now the church is growing we've got a program we're going to have to build a wing here we're going to have to sell it buy more property we need a building fund we need to do this we need to make these investments and we want to make sure that we have a group outreach for this and for this and for this and for this you know what i i find out saints now sorry i'm kind of deviating but you know people approach me actually quite regular you'd be a little bit surprised how regular people call me and they say hey we're this group and we're this or sometimes it's just almost like a social type thing and we would like to use your church we're this little group and we'd like to rent your church we noticed you don't have sunday evening service and we'd like to rent your church on sunday evening or have it on thursday evening or tuesday evening and you know saints when you think about it some of them are like we're willing to pay you like 350 450 550 some of them were like we'll give you 250 a week that's a thousand bucks a month but you know what a thousand bucks a month is worth when you walk into your own church and you have to start fighting your way through these spirits to try to get some liberty inside your own church hallelujah so i will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudence so we have prudent now the definition doesn't change but the atmosphere or the spirit on the individual that we're talking about being prudent so we're going to have those people out here in laodicea that are prudent you'll meet them and they are they're the ones that have a balanced budget have no debt they have this they have that they got plans for the future and everything's all laid out all's well and then you will find those that are sons and daughters of god who are also living by you might say budgets and this and that not above their means and whatever but there's something different because one has found favor in the eyes of god one has found favor in wisdom of this world and an attribute of that wisdom well i'll tell you what it works a lot we read the scripture already amen those of those of god find favor with god see you can look at this now when you go home and you study this look at this from natural and spiritual and you will see the type is almost to me glaring it's just bold it's just there because you can find people i could introduce you tonight probably they'd answer the phone and i could take your house tonight people that have just done they just do everything just right but they have no desire to serve god so being prudent does not them any good in the eternal realm where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world now if we don't think so saints you can just go on your computer i don't know how maybe you want to find news or even if you dare to find news anymore but when you look out here now i i find this and i'm not making fun of the man because i believe it's the spirit of the day and god's going to manifest that has to bring it back but i heard today just listen to the radio for a few minutes when i was doing and and they had these clips and here's the government their spokesman saying oh no if you're vaccinated you don't need to wear a mask anywhere in the very next clip they're like if you're vaccinated you still need to wear two mouths and then the next clip is if you are indoors with your own family you don't need to wear a mouse the very next clip is says well probably to be safe if your children are you know blah blah you probably should even wear the mask inside of your house and if you go in public you should do this and this oh no you don't need to do this you can do that you can do this over here no don't do that do it this way do it that way do it this way over here you need to get vaccinated you know we're thinking about making it so you can vaccinate it a third time now foolishness foolishness now we would argue about it amen those are personal choices but you see my brother and sister my point is not about the vaccine itself my point is they're out here all over the table all over they have no clear answer because they're trusting to something that is foolishness in the eyes of god amen brother branham said they broke into god's laboratory amen they run amok inside that laboratory amen so what did god do he comes along and says you know what i'm going to do i'm going to do by the foolishness of preaching and let me tell you saints there's many a time i walk out of this church get in the car start driving home thinking paul you are so foolish you said what you used what for an example you oh my oh my i'm resigning i'm done i'm finished i can't face the people again now i say this in jest but when your wife ingest gets in the car and is driving home and she says now what was that word you said and i'm like i have no idea she said well you repeated it two or three times you know you talk about feeling foolish but now saints i'm going to approach you a different fashion here don't get distracted is god not present in our church is god not present in our lives is god not moving changing building us up it's not the men here it's the power of god but he says i'm going to use the foolishness of preaching to bring it down and make it real to you and i and all we can say is lord you know you know lord amen amen because you see what he's done now is he's causing these people that are in this realm that they they look at everything and it doesn't fit they say well where is this and where is that and but you see god's making slow but sure the wisdom of this world foolish and the wisdom of god in verse 21 for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god and it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the jews require a sign the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified see now i want to just lay this out real quick and sum this up close here but look at this my brother and sister we preach christ crucified but every one of you as sons and daughters of god takes the word and prudently applies it to your life it's not foolishness you look at this now i'm just very shallow as it were examples we realize my days go better when i pray my days go better when i read my bible my days go better when i stop and i want to say and i say god help us amen your days go better amen because we're prudently applying the word i mean maybe i could use titus for an example or something you know it'd be almost easier just to walk up to your kid but is that what's prudent no sir but i tell you what i've seen this saint because it worked on you you want people to change they say where are you going brother paul i'm just telling you the message as the prophet taught us you want to see people change what do you do you pray for them the prudent thing to do sorry sister nadia it's one of those risks of sitting close to the front you don't come put your finger in their face and tell them what a bad person they are what you do and i'm not implying this to sister nadia what you do is you start praying amen and the more that you lift them to the throne of god the more you are changed and the more they are changed and suddenly we all feel like god's moving in our midst because we have to prudently apply the word in other words we would just supply pitchforks in the back of the church and i would pitch it off here to brother trevor and sister carrie and brother trevor and sister kerry are you both right-handed yeah okay wendy is going to have to convert because otherwise if it's right-handed you guys would be all going like this so i guess it would be coming to sister nadia and sister gabriella are you guys right-handed no gabriella i knew was left-handed maybe we will get it spread around but you see saints what do we do we prudently apply it do you know if someone offends you what the scripture says to do write a you blog me oh thank you lord oh you're dwelling inside me holy spirit hallelujah and what it produces is we've come a new creation hallelujah let's sing that little song i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man isn't that awesome hallelujah i like the idea of being a brand new man hallelujah that old man i'll tell you what the devil's got a big old notebook full of notes and he's got a name wrote on there but i'll tell you what the devil's fool i'll tell you how he's fooled because he's got a notebook that says paul haylett on it seems like he's identified me right paul haylett did this did this did this did this did this but you know what happened the word come i went through a adoption series i come out the other side a brand new bride with the name of mrs jesus christ and when he goes flipping over to the book of moses jesus christ he can't find nothing now if i go through the rest of my life still being the paul haylett the devil still got a list to keep but when we step over saints are you with me we step over in that new birth in that new creation we're identified entirely different god doesn't look down on you and say oh that's that little rascally no good bum no he says that one's gone that's gone i've taken this one through the blood through the new amen through the new covenant and brought it out the other side identified as my wife well hallelujah you know that's the same thing they used same thing they used my brother and sister all through this scripture every one of them harlots that got introduced into the bloodline he took them and brought him out the other side and identified them in a new name wow hallelujah somebody [Applause] oh i've been born again to win why thank god he justified me of his fullness have we all received of him i'm a new creation i'm a brand new land [Music] all things are passed away i've been born again that's what i am i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man i'm a new creation [Music] i'm a brand new man all things have passed away i've been born again more than a conqueror that's what i am i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man hallelujah one more song hallelujah thy loving kindness aren't you glad tonight can we just lift our hands and say lord thank you for your loving kindness thank you lord that you've brought us down and you're not just leaving us as some person that come to church and had some kind of experience went away hopefully changed but lord thy loving kindness has come give us a vision of your perfect will for our lives brought us to a place that our heart is constantly saying lord i want to please you lord i want to live the life you called me to lord i i want to be able to express you lord jesus and in the time of need to also have that same faith of our lord jesus christ rising up being able to say satan depart laying hands on our children saying lord you made a promise i'm a mother i'm a father you made a promise i lay my hands on my child in the name of jesus christ and expect the results to come oh hallelujah thy loving kindness [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i lift [Music] [Music] i will [Music] amen greet one another in the name of the lord jesus christ say god bless you remember these these needs amen our brother vasily on the road sister thoma in the ukraine many things happening saints for the sergey traveling i i don't know we'd have to ask sister yulia but i know that the little communication i had with brother sergey this is not just a nice little trip he rode from i can't even pronounce it probably correct kiev down to the nest stuffed in a van full of people you know not no first class train ride or bus ride or private car but stuffed in a man with a bunch of people things to take care of decisions to make let's just remember them in prayer amen remember one another look around if you would please just remember one another in prayer we need one another brother and sister you know i shared this i think that might have been a little text sister kerry sent me but i kind of wonder saints not trying to make a doctrine but i kind of wonder if this standard that god's raising up as satan's come pouring in right now see if we're not careful we get this idea that here comes the flood and suddenly in the last minute we struggle we got something to stop the flood no i'm sorry god's got it all ready set in place now i want to just put something out to you don't make doctrine out of this please don't twist it but i just wonder if part of that standard isn't you praying for me and me praying for you all of us right here saying i care enough i love them enough i'll lift them up in prayer and we're over here struggling it feels like oh something's happened you know and this is wrong and that's wrong and oh lord why and what and somebody's over here praying and that standard is somehow buttressing us i believe i just believe that's part of it but god said i'll place people in your life that will lift you up and in your time of need their prayers will be right there that's what you call unity in the body god bless you saints we love you and the lord just pray have a lovely rest of the week come together on sunday it's not this coming weekend is it brother david it's next weekend
