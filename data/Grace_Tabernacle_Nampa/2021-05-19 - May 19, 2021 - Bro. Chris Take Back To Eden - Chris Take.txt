to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them and the lord god said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life let's bow our heads heavenly father lord we ask that you would come and have your way tonight in our midst lord father prepare the bedding ground lord for the planting of the seed tonight for the watering of the seed father there's hardness in our soil father till it up lord jesus tonight father

way tonight lord may i not hinder the moving of the holy spirit we pray father we'll just step aside and allow you to speak tonight in jesus christ's name we pray amen may be seated tonight so as you may have seen uh my title title tonight is back to eden amen so we read here in genesis chapter 3 that um is it loud it might little bit loud i think for me appear anyways written in genesis chapter 3 we see the start of the story of where we are today because of what happened in the garden of eden we deal with what we deal with on a daily basis and we see the great tragedy in the love story that began in the book of genesis we read about the great things that happened in the garden of eden how adam had dominion over the the the land and the animals and how they walked with the lord every single night and yet eve allowed the serpent to change one thing in the word of god and from that she fell and from that she received the seed of death then she went to adam and adam partzik as well out of his love for eve he was not blinded and then the lord came looking for them and um he always had a quick response before when he said adam and eve where are you guys or adam arthur and they would say we're over here you know and they would fellowship with him but this time no one answered the call and finally the lord finds them and he says you know what's going on and they said oh we know we're naked and that is where we we pick up here in in genesis and so um mankind fell losing the connection they had with god and sent into the human race and then we lost eden uh webster's call uh gives the definition unspoiled paradise amen we cannot duplicate replicate unspoiled paradise they try right the caribbean the bahamas hawaii right paradise you know perfect temperature every every all year long but there's still sin and there's even more sin in those places it seems like a place that mankind says this is going to be it this is the utopia we gotta the politicians get involved and they said we gotta you know go to this new systems of these things and everything will be good you know let's hand out the money and everything we better will create a paradise and the time and time again down through history and then they these things came to nothing they fell apart and many of them ended in tragedy the mormons tried to create their paradise and things did not go well and still don't go well for them and then we have here of the people that go off in the middle of the jungle and then to the paradise and then they all drink the kool-aid so man tries to replicate unspoiled paradise but you cannot achieve unspoiled paradise born of a man in a woman or can you there's something that happens to a child of god that changes them you live inside a spoiled paradise adam and eve had perfect bodies but they became spoiled by sin by mixing with sin and because of that every single one of us are born sons and daughters of god inside but living in a spoiled paradise so this body has potential to be in eden this body has a potential and you have one that's just like it waiting for you you'll put this one aside because this flesh cannot be redeemed but the soul of your of your soul has been redeemed and you'll step from this version of eden into the true eden amen your theophany that's waiting for you so the devil amen he thought he could come in and he thought he could bring it and he's this is satan's eden but unfortunately since the word means unspoiled paradise this is satan's spoiled paradise this is satan's attempt at the version of what god did at the beginning and you say it's kind of like god's the bag said okay satan let's see what you got and he ruined the whole thing amen you have you know you have these these uh these uh arguments and they get kind of political about global warming and different things like that well i don't know how much you want to believe about their rhetoric but the earth isn't doing well the earth is sick because we have perverted we have spoiled god's paradise amen and we you can't help it you were born that way but god has come down and he has a vision in his mind he has a vision in his heart that he wants to once again walk with you in the cool of the evening once again spend time with you once again put his arm around you and bring you into fellowship and because we my title is back to eden because in this world we live in a wasteland that people say try to to pretty up like putting makeup on a really ugly woman try to make her look nice but you can't hide it and so that's that's what's happening it's a wasteland around us we see glimpses of god's glory because he created it the other day i was driving through the around the parking lot waiting for kristen as she was in the store and uh they had they tried to do the landscaping or they do be landscaping around you know stores and kind of try to put things back so it's not just all concrete and i was looking at the trees and they were fluttering in the wind and it was it was it was this was a while a few weeks ago so spring was not quite honest but it was it was a taste of spring and summer to come and it just it was absolutely beautiful and i realized what a stark difference those that row of trees was to the pavement and the curb and the big shopping center and the cars and the weird people all around them and i thought wow we can try our best but we'll never ever replicate god's beauty and um your your sons and daughters of god are drawn to that because it's a glimpse into the heart of god amen we find his beauty in the scriptures and so and that draws us back to god back to eden and so praise the lord sin entered the human race and we were filthy this flesh still is it's fallen but we by god's grace keep it in control amen i can't imagine i like i don't know about you but i have a pretty vivid imagination and i i i put myself in these stories that i read and i'm not trying to say i'm special i'm just saying i imagine adam and eve put yourself where they are never having a headache never seeing never having a cut and blood never never having um an itch never never stubbing their toes never hurt not a single ounce of pain never having disappointment never never feeling disconnected from god and in a moment all of that changes they they had a relationship with the animals they had friendships with the animals think about how in your fallen flesh you how close you can get to like your dog or your cat but you really love them they might even love you back i don't know how that works but um here they are and now they stand and now they stand in their shame before god and he murders an animal in front of them for the first time they watch a life be taken can you imagine we see it every day we eat of we eat meat from animals that have been killed it's just part of our life but all of that happened to them in a single moment you went from paradise to chaos they they they started to hear as they left the garden of eden brother branham paints such a a heart-wrenching picture in your head but such a contrast to god's great grace and redemption when he talks about adam and eve walking from the garden he says eve crying on adam's shoulder the wet bloody skins of the animals flapping against their legs god watching them walk away breaking god's heart yet it was all part of god's eternal plan but you see the state of this love story that started off so well but then took a tragic tragic turn for the worse or so it would seem and so they go they they they spin somewhere for the night perhaps had to find shelter maybe that day was things slowly begin to change on the earth and in their bodies uh that night they begin to hear sounds they never heard before the howling of the packs of wolves as they took down an innocent lamb or took down a deer or a stag they begin to hear the noises you hear you're used to but here at the at the in in a single day 24 hours if you will if i can take liberty to say so they they go from perfect paradise unspoiled paradise now they begin to hear the sounds of death around them amen adam had his first headache they had their first argument the next morning over how he wanted his eggs they were amen they all the things that we experience every day suddenly rushing upon them imagine going i don't know how many of you have experienced that most of you probably have but i've had the opportunity uh to be in some very very remote places in the wilderness and you're there for a long period of time and when you come back my everything is so loud you hear every honk you hear every screeching tire you every baby in every house crying you hear people talking everywhere and just it rushes upon you and you're like you know you kind of get the blues for a little bit and you're like oh here welcome back right but that's just a glimpse to everything that came upon them that day when they made the wrong choice and it would seem as we look in from the outside on this great story unfolding before us that what is god going to do he lost his his his love the love of of his heart betrayed his word and he had to put them out from this place called the garden of eden but god whispered in adam's ear as he walked from the garden of eden don't worry son i will redeem you amen so what would become we look on and say well what will become of the people that god calls his children here they are out of the garden of eden amen but god had a plan you sit there you know it but imagine not knowing it not knowing what's going to happen but see adam it doesn't say it in the scriptures but you read between the lines adam had a revelation that someday someday god was going to fix the mistake that him and eve had made and then god was going to come back and as time progresses you see god called abraham out of the wilderness and begin to give him his promises and from abraham down through history god has been bringing those children of abraham back to him amen every everyone though they have passed on on their way back to eden amen we pick up the story in isaiah 51 if you want to turn there you can um thus saith whoops 51 verse 1 hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek the lord look unto the rock whence ye are hewn and to the whole of the pit once you are digged so you were cut from the rock you were cut from christ before the foundation of the world god said this one's my daughter right out of the rock what is the rock a revelation of who jesus christ is amen and so you were cut from that revelation in other words you cannot deny christ amen adam and eve lost it but god began to bring it back in place and he said don't worry you messed it up now but i already cut you from the rock and and the whole of the pit whence you were digged you say i'm so far down in in in this pit of sin how can anything help me but the scriptures here says he'll pull you right out of the pit amen he'll pull you amen right out of the pit that you have dug he says look unto abraham your father okay so he's talking about you we know that you're children of abraham and unto sarah that bear you for i called him alone and blessed him and increased him for the lord shall comfort zion he will comfort all her waste places and he will make her wilderness like eden and her desert like the garden of the lord joy and gladness shall be found therein thanksgiving and the voice of melody god's promise you daughters of zion he will make your wilderness like eden he will restore everything in your heart and soul amen back to the way it was before why so he can have fellowship with you he can't do it as long as you're a wilderness as long as zion is a wilderness there is no fellowship with christ he has to come and bring you back to eden we are facing eden are we there yet we will be when we go over to the other side and we rapture into eternity but we are standing in the wasteland that's called satan's eden but in our hearts there is unspoiled paradise you have an unspoiled communication an uninhibited fellowship with jesus christ amen who is the door got to stop there i'm going to get ahead of myself praise the lord revelation chapter 4 1961 brother brown had caught you there but the bible says you notice these cherubs that john saw here must have been interested in keeping the tree of life so they must have been they must be interested in human beings or read genesis getting back to genesis again they kept the tree of life guarded it the way of life the way of life how is the way jesus said i am that way i am that bread that come from god out of heaven if a man eats this bread he'll live forever now there is now there is a way back to that tree of life not a that tree of life you get it now at this so so the there was guards placed there but when christ died on the cross and the veil was rent into that holiest of holies if you will spiritually speaking the terror cherubs called off duty because now you have the ability to access the tree of life you can attain eternal life actually the guards still stand there but you have a pass amen now he says at this i want to to show to show now and make this sure it's an altar now this must have been an altar at the garden of eden i'll tell you why do you remember both cain and abel come up here to worship so that shows that god's altar was moved and set here at the garden of eden and the only way back to eden is by the altar here you are again see back to eden through the altar and they were to keep that way there guard it that they couldn't get back there until this altar was covered with blood so so okay i'll finish a quote oh god can't people see it see nothing but the blood there has to be an atonement a mercy seat there this altar of judgment must become a mercy seat how did the um which it was the east of the east side of the garden by the way which east is the line of the tribe of judah how did this way the only way for them to have access back was by spilt blood on the altar what does that blood on the altar do it turns judgment into grace it turns judgment into mercy into the mercy seat as long as that blood is there amen god is giving out mercy and so he says and when this altar if the blood is lifted there will send on that judgment day the fire of god's wrath to guard that tree again only one thing will enter into this gate to eden again will be through the blood of jesus christ so i re i going back in time the cherubs are off duty everybody has access to the tree of life but one of these days when the blood is lifted amen they're going to stand guard again amen to that tree of life so anybody can come but not everybody is going to find the the entrance to the garden of eden because jesus christ is the door he is the way amen he is life and there's only going to be those that remember eden uh that was thousands of years ago chris i was born 20 40 40 years ago how do i remember eden the spiritual version of you you the seed of god in your heart remembers eden that's why when you met christ he was so familiar because there was something that connected it was what you were always looking for abraham walked and walked and walked and walked and his faith on his journey was testified to his righteousness but you found it the children of abraham have found the door to the garden of eden they have found the door which is christ why because now you can find him when abraham walked the plains of memory there was no access to that fellowship yet there was only a type of that access and then abraham was able to see melchizedek and speak to god because god led him but there was no holy ghost even amen so the altar is the only way back to eden the tabernacle in the wilderness was just a foretaste of what god had in mind it was it was god's god said okay this is going to be an example the time is not right yet but this is an example pointing them to the truth but you see it was the truth and it was their access but it was it wasn't it wasn't the real thing it was it was it was a an expression of worship but it wasn't the real thing they didn't have access to christ like you do amen if if you allow me it was it was like a mirage out in the desert you see it and wow look at that can almost see what that is right but you never quite get to it they were they were trying to get to it they were trying to but they couldn't get to it they're only the priest high priest could go in once a year but then when god came amen and he turned your wilderness into eden you arrived at that place amen that it was no longer a mirage to you and then it was no longer obscure and something you were looking for i'm not exactly sure what i want you know mirage you're not exactly sure what you're seeing it maybe water maybe trees you know it's real blurry and um but it turned out this time around the mirage turned into reality for you there are people chasing mirages in the wilderness called satan's eden and they come to them and they vanish oh this this new job will give me all i want and they go and they get to that and it's just a mirage of peace it vanishes before their eyes but they see you and you're you're traveling forward you see the real thing and the fake thing both look the same in the distance in the desert the heat waves a mirage is something i think that's not there but it can look like a mirage and be real so the world says i don't know why you're going after that it's fake it looks just like this and this one over here that i went to and it disappeared in vanessa i couldn't find peace why are you going towards it but you have a revelation in your heart amen that you're on your way back to eden so you're looking in the distance amen praise the lord excuse me i heard that so they were looking towards this this tabernacle in the wilderness and they're asking themselves is that eden i see do i see the truth in there amen it was a it was a teaser it was a it was a preview and then but down through history it was preached and prophesied there would be a return to eden amen but how and will then come along the prophecy of a virgin shall conceive amen john asked the same question who is worthy who is worthy to take us back those guards are standing there with their swords ready they're flaming swords adam and eve lost it who can fix it who can bring us back to eden who can restore the fellowship there's nobody worthy who can do it and then weep not job before behold the lion of the tribe of judah shall prevail so he got his answer in christ he saw that christ was the answer to the eden dilemma this great love story with such a heartbreaking beginning amen praise the lord with such a heartbreaking beginning is has seen a shift in the story kind of like a good a good book you know like a good book that you cannot figure it out you try i've read a lot of books so i'm pretty good at figuring out the plot and when i find a book that's too challenging to figure out and just you just you love it right get down to the very end and and oh wow it's going to work out so here's john reading the book and he said i don't know how it's going to work it's impossible i i can't see i can't see how the the the this love story there's there's gonna be a redemption of this of this relationship this love that was lost how is god going to get his bride back how is he going to bring a bride to him how are we going to ever have a promise outside of this death but there was a plot twist see the lion became the lamb and the lamb was given for a sacrifice nobody saw that one coming and so christ rescued his bride now god has fellowship again amen and is taking us back to eden brother madam says in redeemer redemption 1955 what did he redeem he redeemed your soul from hell he redeemed and brought back everything that adam lost when he put you in the pawn shop jesus christ on calvary was your kinsman redeemer that redeemed you from every curse of the devil he redeems your soul he redeems your sick body he redeems your weary dreary spirit he brought you happiness he brought you joy he brought you that's what the redemption brought you brought you peace long-suffering goodness gentleness meekness power the holy spirit brought you divine healing all these things jesus christ brought to you because excuse me he was our kinsmen redeemer amen isaiah chapter four i went to this scripture not not knowing that um it was the the scripture that they all sing about on sunday but i found and i said oh look at there so isaiah chapter 4 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach and that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious see i'm trying to paint the picture adam and eve amen walked out of the garden of eden and all of this and and now that this filth enters the human race and you you look at this picture in this spoiled ride amen this this this bra whose garments are tattered and spoiled and you think how can god find a bride in that but the scripture here says when those that aren't called of god will begin to say we just want his name that god's going to say i am going to bring from zion i'm going to turn her wilderness into eden i'm going to bring that woman and clothe her in a spotless white garment and so the world won't recognize who she is because they only know her by what she was but i saw from the beginning of time that down in her heart and when she was spotless she was cut from the rock and i was going to bring her from the pit so you have this two versions versions one this woman who is covered in filth and just wants the name the daughters of babylon but then on this side you have the daughters of zion and he says in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious what day this day and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy everyone that is written among the living in jerusalem you mean the children of the man and the woman that betrayed god's trust in the garden of eden could be holy you mean that children of those parents that committed fornication in in the garden of eden in god's great holy place could bring forth somebody worthy of marrying jesus christ yes because god said i have a plan of redemption when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion so the daughters of zion were filthy but god washed them white as snow amen and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning i am you were called justified redeemed and cleansed by the holy ghost and fire god stood and judged you called but there's a quote you can find it but then talks about the scripture and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain the only way back to eden is under the headship of christ amen god took you the daughter of zion and washed the filth from you and he brought you to a place where you stand called holy called mrs jesus christ amen god is bringing you back to eden and but the only way and this is where this is what just gets me stirred up because you can't you can't deny who you are you you there is even these people that do weird things with their bodies they're still what they were born you can't deny it you can't change what you are the same way as a believer you can't change the fact that you're a part of the bride of christ you can you wouldn't but you could try as hard as you could to to change it i don't want to be it i don't and you you fought it you fought it till you found no peace in satan's eden in the spoiled paradise of the world you didn't find it amen but here it is brother mohammed says in in christ is the mystery of god revealed 1963 the word produces its own life that eve swapped for personal knowledge now yes i cut and spliced but i didn't cut and splice if you know what i'm saying there's just a couple paragraphs where those dots are that we didn't need to read then he says a little bit further he says he the head is the first fruits of the resurrection and then in paragraph 5 16 then the bride body must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection part of the mystery your part of the mystery why is it a mystery how could he take filthy daughter of zion a filthy woman and make her the daughter zion how could he take mary magdalene and turn her life around till people see her and say she's a holy woman how can god take that fallen bride from the garden of eden and restore her back amen that is the mystery that is the paradox he says it's impossible for it not to go see you can't you can't you can't stop it you're on the train and the train ain't stopping amen so he says it's part of god's mystery how god revealed himself here and raised it up by the word so he reveals his church and raising it up by the same word it's a part of his threefold mystery as the head was took from the grave so must the body follow him back to eden praise the lord maybe this will sink in tomorrow and then you'll smile and laugh as the head was taken from the grave so must the body follow him back to eden where the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow not she might follow maybe she'll follow i don't know eve she didn't follow and and and now the second adam we're gonna try this again the second eve we're gonna try this again okay we'll try this all again but guess what there's a secret ingredient there's a mystery and the devil wishes he can figure it out but he can't and we can't even explain it but it's the mystery that you are the elect of god there is something in you something in you that marks you as one of his own and nothing can take and it's it ain't no mirage amen the bride because that's the head the head is revealed how could you follow the head unless it was revealed has to be revealed christ has to be revealed you have to know everything he is you have to have the ability to know everything he is if you want to follow him back to eden if you're following a god that's not revealed you're wandering in the desert like everybody else but christ has revealed himself in order for us to find our way back to eden and then we can't do it without christ revealed because he is our head if your head's not revealed how are you going to find your way you can't do it that's why you don't understand it but people can't understand it god had to show himself and if he hadn't showed himself by now the bible would be false because how are you going to get back to where you're supposed to be how are you going to become who you are meant to be unless he shows himself to you and that is happening the world around you testifies that it's the time for christ to be revealed amen that has to line up praise the lord so he says um the head is revealed and come back with eternal life and the body must follow that because it is husband and wife again what yes you're married to christ you are married amen and as long as you're pregnant with the same word which is his body you took his body become in him when you took the word not the creed the word and he says i hear the word produces its own life see eve swapped th swapped the word for personal knowledge but the bride that's married to the second adam is not going to swap it she can't swap it because she has received the word the word got to her before the devil could and sealed her up sealed up that wound of her soul and now what what's happening the flesh your flesh tries to deny it are you even a christian man bro what are you doing you're not even saved right your flesh denies it but the word inside of you is producing its own life it says never mind about you i'm growing i'm pushing it's pushing back the dark amen the love story has been completed because you're married to christ you know um just uh telling my wife a little that when i first met her i was like this girl is is is all right um and i i well i was too scared to pursue it she had to message me on facebook and then i pursued it and um you know we're talking and i'm on cloud nine man i'm wow man this girl is awesome like finally found me a good one and she goes hey by the way i just want to be friends and just pop my balloon just and i was deflated and uh but my dad said don't worry my your mom said the same thing to me and so a few months later she changed her mind but it kind of i forgot i lost my train of thought when i said all that so god started out with his bride but she said never mind i'm not interested and took the seed of the serpent but god you know what i apologize somebody can go back and find my thought there in the archives and they can maybe figure it out for themselves i'm just going to move forward because i do not remember what i was talking about so anyways oh that's what i was the love story has been completed so amen praise the lord so the love story had a bad beginning oh it didn't seem like it was going to work out but i can stand here and say it's been completed because now you're married to christ amen praise the lord leave it there so we are facing eden i had notes to this sermon before brother preach brother david preached on sunday and he started talking about facing eden and i just met i don't know this is all just going together somehow amen it's no mirage on the horizon for us we see it you know they those without a revelation they look on and they go ah what are you seeing i can't see it it's just it's you know it looks like maybe the seals are open but i just can't understand it i don't know i just should we just listen to tapes i can't tell but you have been given the eyes to see and what is a mirage to everyone else is crystal clear to you and you know that that is eden amen behind us and around us is a wasteland the desert of satan's eden the world looks on trying to reach eden but for them it is only a mirage that vanishes when their ideas for peace crumble they try it imagine world peace right they've been trying for it you know free love the just just gone downhill from there trying to find peace why can't we just all get along let's create you know the um the u.n let's let's just have peace all the world over it can't happen it cannot happen um so to okay to turn from following after christ is to deny his headship i didn't i didn't get the pictures and now i wish i would have but i was gonna have a picture of the desert and of beautiful scenery problem is i was worried because what i think is beautiful scenery might not be the same for everyone else but if you had a gorgeous mountain scene like something up in the sawtooths right big beautiful blue lake green trees around and you had the sahara desert sand only which would you rather pursue the desert or the mountain or the beautiful scenery with water any any normal person would say the mountain scene so why why do you want to turn and say oh i can't follow after that and walk back into the wasteland just like the children of israel they said all the leaks and the garlics of egypt and someone's like um you mean the whips and the scorching of egypt how soon they forget when things don't go their way they had been spoiled if you will and they didn't like it now it's boring guess what i'm here to tell you sometimes serving god can be well i don't want to be i don't want to say this wrong the life of a christian can sometimes be boring that's how the devil gets you nothing's happening things are just you know you know their people are here they're doing you know he can kind of get you to think i don't know what i'm trying to say you just gotta fill in the blanks there but anyways there it was it was same old same hole sunday morning that's on friday sunday morning church but jason's singing that song again i said wednesday night brother chris is slobbering again right i'm just doing this thing like i'm here i'm at church right and you're converted but see you have just this it's a rhythm a pattern gets stuck in a rut it's called and you think to yourself you know if i could just hop the fence my goodness i would have a blast in that grass over there now you just hop the fence but then the shepherd comes along and breaks your leg so then you have to stand and buy and hang out with the shepherd but um as of having the children invisible they got complacent with the miracles happening all around them we say people some people say you know where where's the great you know the great healings and the miracles of brother brandon if we could go back to the days of brother branham it's happening here it's happening now god is is on the move if you don't see it you ain't looking in the right place amen the world looks on praise lord okay i got behind in my notes to turn back into the desert from following christ they entered back into the wasteland but in deuteronomy 32 and i'm closing here shortly deuteronomy chapter 32 oh should i mark the spot that's a hard book to find deuteronomy chapter 32 verse 7. don't have to follow what you can remember the days of old consider the years of many generations and ask thy father and he will show thee thy elders and they will tell thee in other words ask for the testimonies of the time gone by and when the most high when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of israel for the lord's portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance you are the lord's inheritance amen he found him in a desert land amen he found you in a desert land in the waste howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye as an eagle stir up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him in other words he had revelation that his god was the only god for him he had a revelation this is the one that pulled me from the wilderness from the howling wasteland and as an ego stir with her nest as she puts out her wings with her brother man tell the story and you can go listen to that sermon as eagles stir with her nest she put out her wings and brought them little eaglets up into the sky he brings you up into the heavenly places and then he pops you off to learn how to fly and you're falling and you're falling and you're thinking god has forsaken me and then he catches you and bears you up on his wings again and then god teaching you amen how to fly how to make it through this wilderness called satan's eden into the place of of of true unspoiled paradise amen the children of abraham he leads from the wasteland god is guiding you and leading you back to eden you say i i you know you want to find that that peace the world is looking for that peace and they'll never find it in the wilderness but god can lead them like god has led you to a place where they recognize amen that he is their peace he is their portion so while we are here on earth in this dreadful satan's eden amen there is an eden within us that we have can tap have tapped into and when there's chaos all around we can find you know there's oasises oh he says i don't say that right in the desert places of comfort and peace and that's what god gives you amen praise the lord and everything he has promised in his book is yours for the taking amen the musicians want to come tonight jesus christ has restored all that was lost in the garden of eden amen we're on our way back to dwell there for eternity but the bantam says that christ restored all christ was all that adam lost and that's a sermon in itself christ was all that adam lost in other words peace redemption eternal life healing all of that was lost but when christ came see you don't need anything else besides christ when that's why when christ has been revealed to you eliezer steps off the scene you need christ if i was going to say hey listen you need to talk to this guy joe over here he knows a lot about gold panning and i brought you to joe and then i sit in between you guys and start to tell you what i know about gold panning what what would be the you excuse me i'm trying to talk to joe if what i'm trying to say is if i brought you to joan then you talk to me and not joe what will be the point of that introduction what will be the point but we have been introduced to christ amen but to [Music] but to submit to god's word takes full surrender and when you find people that that that that can't follow the way that god has set in order it's because they have a problem coming underneath total headship because you can follow the tapes of brother branham and live in your life and chip of christ because the headship of christ says the fivefold ministry so you can't get back to eden without being under the headship of christ you have to follow and you can't get back to eden but underneath the edge of christ maybe you even believe in preachers but you don't accept god's revealed word for your for today you cannot come underneath his headship it's impossible because you don't know who the head is unless he's revealed to you amen as the believer as a son of god believing all of this coming to a good church listening to good preachers you will never find victory in your life until you can surrender and come underneath his headship so that he can take you back to eden amen the things that you're struggling with until you completely surrender and lay it all on what the altar which is the way into the garden of eden that blood of jesus christ comes and covers those things until you lay it down it doesn't have to be sin it doesn't have to be an addiction to something or cigarettes or smoking or drinking it can simply be a burden that you're carrying you can be it can be a lie that you're accepting from the devil god is asking you to just set it down and he'll cover it with the blood amen and allow you to step in to eden amen into the peace that he is offering you amen in this great love story saints of god we hear enough negativity in the world around us god doesn't need to point his finger down at you and say how dare you instead he says better than this you're better than this saints of god i'm here to tell you tonight you're better than this whatever it is you're facing you're better than it it could be a just a a problem you're trying to solve at the job you can't figure it out just pray look i'm not a smart i'm not a you know people oh you're a programmer you must be some kind of brain no no i just pray lord i can't figure this out and he gives me the answer [Music] god what god has been trying to say in these in these we've kind of talked about it in fellowship a little bit how the the services are lining up so beautifully picking up the next verse and and brother david said it on sunday the lord is trying to tell you something and i believe what god is trying to say is little bride come underneath my headship a little bit more because i just want to wrap my arms around you i just want to hold you close just come here just just lay on the altar of of your heart let everything go because not because he you don't do that of fear you do it because you love him not because you're trying to keep him happy but because he longs he's a longing his arms are aching to wrap them around you and hold you close but there's something holding you back there's something keeping you some unforgiveness in your heart that's keeping you from from from god being able to wrap you up because that's what he wants to do so bad he's not standing there telling you would you just get get things straight come on knock it off no he's saying please come please i want to hold you close that's what god is trying to say but you can't do it outside of his headship you have to be underneath the headship and then god will bring you and hold you and take you back amen let's bow our heads heavenly father lord jesus we're so thankful father that we serve you father there are many gods there are many religions there are many things we could put our time and energy into but none of them bring life father the satan's eden that we are walking through shedding your light father is a world of
