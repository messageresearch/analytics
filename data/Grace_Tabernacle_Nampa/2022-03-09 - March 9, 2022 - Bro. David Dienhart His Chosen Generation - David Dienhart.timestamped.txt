[30:29] but we know he'll share his glory with

[31:15] i just don't have time i realized i

[32:28] good to be in
[32:29] it's good to be in not just the building
[32:31] but in the house
[32:33] of the lord
[32:34] a part of his body
[32:36] a part of himself
[32:38] amen let's have a word of prayer
[32:40] our heavenly father we do thank you for
[32:42] this opportunity now to
[32:45] to in this hour to be the very
[32:47] expression
[32:48] of yourself
[32:50] lord as you express this message to us
[32:52] and brought it through a prophet you are
[32:54] expressing your bride
[32:56] and lord we know that it's through that
[32:58] expression of a thought that we had in
[33:00] you and were in you before the world
[33:02] began
[33:04] that when you expressed it we come to
[33:05] ourselves in this hour the only way we
[33:08] could
[33:09] was through that thought expressed in a
[33:11] word
[33:12] we come direct from the thought of god
[33:14] lord and came down into his bodies of
[33:16] clay
[33:18] but lord we're going to leave these
[33:19] bodies of clay because the inside man
[33:21] the rapture has already taken
[33:23] place and already in progress
[33:25] so father we know that we have a new
[33:28] body waiting for us because we know that
[33:30] our name was in that record of eternal
[33:32] life
[33:33] we thank you for this now i ask you to
[33:36] bless your word circumcise these lips
[33:39] to your thoughts alone lord
[33:42] and father i'm not here intending to
[33:44] speak my own thoughts i want to speak
[33:46] your thoughts as you desire it to be
[33:48] may you accomplish your will
[33:50] may you accomplish your purpose
[33:52] in our gathering here tonight may we
[33:54] leave here raised to a higher plane
[33:57] in christ jesus our lord
[33:59] for in christ jesus our lord is
[34:02] everything the full
[34:03] complete realization
[34:06] lord of what we stand in in this hour
[34:09] we now thank you and praise you and give
[34:11] glory and honor to you in advance
[34:13] because we know number one you're
[34:15] present
[34:16] and you have all things in control
[34:19] we thank you jesus in jesus name amen
[34:23] amen
[34:24] his chosen generation isaiah 53 53 53rd
[34:29] chapter isaiah
[34:31] to start with
[34:38] isaiah 53
[34:40] and
[34:41] starting with verse 1
[34:43] and then i think we'll jump down to
[34:45] another part of this
[34:47] brother branham referred to this in the
[34:49] message the masterpiece
[34:51] and he said that this is the masterpiece
[34:54] as we kind of broke into that a little
[34:56] bit
[34:57] on sunday we realized that we see both
[34:59] him and her here because that's his
[35:02] masterpiece brother branham preaching
[35:04] the masterpiece
[35:05] took first
[35:06] our lord showing he was
[35:09] god manifested himself all he was in one
[35:11] person the masterpiece then brother
[35:14] branham said god's
[35:15] in the progress of building another
[35:17] bringing forth another masterpiece
[35:20] amen so so we see that that brother
[35:23] branham referred and said to us in this
[35:25] hour that
[35:26] the mystery of god under that seventh
[35:28] seal was in it was unveiled through the
[35:30] bible in a three-fold manner
[35:32] and
[35:33] and we went into those manners and i
[35:35] won't try to do i won't try to bring
[35:37] back so much what we said sunday because
[35:39] if i do that i'll never get through this
[35:41] one
[35:42] so
[35:43] you know you have a tendency as a
[35:44] minister to try to go back and pick up
[35:46] things because it's just all alive
[35:48] isn't that wonderful i know one thing
[35:50] the the word is becoming so alive
[35:54] and and he said it would be like that be
[35:56] just a real fresh outpouring of the holy
[35:58] spirit right at the end upon that body
[36:00] the bride
[36:01] and the word just becoming alive every
[36:03] day i just can't even stay up with it
[36:05] it's just becoming just quick and quick
[36:08] and quick and quick and it's just
[36:10] and you try to you know and it's just
[36:12] becoming one great picture and that is
[36:15] the full revelation of jesus christ
[36:18] and and we're glad that i'm i'm glad
[36:20] that i can say individually i'm a part
[36:22] of that
[36:23] and so verse 1 53 chapter 53 of isaiah
[36:28] who hath believed our report
[36:32] and we know one thing that the bride in
[36:34] this age under her messenger will be the
[36:36] final voice so who hath believed our
[36:39] report
[36:42] and to whom
[36:43] is the arm of the lord revealed
[36:46] now i can tell you what the prophet said
[36:48] about that i believe what the prophet
[36:49] said about the word we don't need
[36:51] another interpreter about it because god
[36:54] will interpret his word through his
[36:55] prophets
[36:57] brother braham said we have the perfect
[36:58] interpretation of the word so we need to
[37:01] look around for other interpretation we
[37:03] have the perfect interpretation of the
[37:05] word by divine vindication
[37:07] and so
[37:08] see he said whoever who believes the
[37:10] report is who the report's revealed to
[37:13] that's what he told us
[37:14] he that can believe it believing it is
[37:17] has the faith in him to see it
[37:20] and and to receive it and so who hath
[37:23] believed our report and to whom is the
[37:25] arm and the arm of the lord of course is
[37:27] his word
[37:28] his arm is not shortened you know the
[37:30] scripture on that
[37:31] the arm of the lord revealed
[37:34] now i could take a lot in this but i
[37:36] want to jump down here let's take verse
[37:38] 5 but he was wounded for our
[37:40] transgressions
[37:41] bruised
[37:43] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[37:45] our peace was
[37:46] upon him and with his stripes we are
[37:48] healed the prophet told us to put your
[37:50] name in there
[37:52] amen
[37:53] and then he's then he goes on to say
[37:56] you know we know he's born our griefs
[37:58] all we like sheep have gone astray
[38:01] and and
[38:02] trying to turn everyone their own way
[38:04] and the lord has laid on him the
[38:06] iniquity of us all
[38:08] and then in verse 8 he was taken from
[38:10] prison
[38:12] and from judgment
[38:15] and this is what i want to get to
[38:17] who shall declare his generation
[38:21] for he was cut off
[38:23] out of the land of the living for the
[38:26] transgression of my people
[38:28] was he stricken
[38:30] then i want to jump the first 10.
[38:35] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[38:39] he hath put him to grief
[38:42] now listen
[38:43] when thou shall make his soul an
[38:45] offering for sin
[38:47] he shall see
[38:49] his seed
[38:51] for he shall prolong his days and the
[38:54] pleasure of the lord shall prosper
[38:57] in his hand
[38:59] you may be seated i'd like you to turn
[39:01] with me the first peter
[39:05] these two scriptures
[39:06] first peter 2.
[39:11] our brother chris had taken these
[39:13] scriptures and
[39:16] and we've taken them many times and
[39:18] we'll probably take them more times
[39:20] first peter 2
[39:25] and i want to begin reading
[39:27] with verse 7
[39:29] unto you therefore
[39:31] which believe
[39:33] he is precious
[39:37] and let me just back up a minute i
[39:39] missed something isaiah 53 he said he
[39:42] said
[39:44] who shall declare who shall and the
[39:46] question is who shall
[39:48] declare his generation
[39:50] well the answer was in the first verse
[39:55] that's who shell
[39:58] who is the arm of the lord revealed to
[40:00] is who shall declare
[40:02] his generation
[40:04] so
[40:05] and i'll come into just a moment here
[40:07] that what declare means in generation
[40:10] but in first peter 2 7
[40:12] it says unto you be unto you therefore
[40:15] which believe he is precious
[40:18] but unto them
[40:20] now we know who you are you are that
[40:22] living stone you are that lively stone
[40:25] you are that elects
[40:27] amen you are the house of god
[40:31] amen
[40:32] and he said unto you therefore which
[40:35] believe
[40:37] he is precious but unto them which be
[40:40] disobedient the stone which the builders
[40:42] disallowed
[40:44] the same is made the head of the corner
[40:47] i want you to notice the builders
[40:48] disallowed the cornerstone but now it's
[40:50] become the head
[40:52] amen and i think we're in that day i
[40:55] know we're in that day we had the
[40:56] prophet tell us too many times
[40:58] we're in the head age
[41:02] we've had the headstone come and appear
[41:04] and now is uniting with his body the
[41:07] head and the body are becoming one unit
[41:09] we we covered that pretty thoroughly on
[41:12] on sunday so i won't try to
[41:14] pick that up again
[41:15] but
[41:16] he said the stone which the builders
[41:18] disallowed the same as made the head of
[41:20] the corner and the stone of stumbling
[41:23] a rock of offense
[41:25] even to them which stumble at the word
[41:28] being disobedient whereunto also they
[41:31] were
[41:33] appointed
[41:35] amen
[41:36] god had some foreknowledge of them and
[41:38] they were appointed to that
[41:40] amen is that right all right now verse 9
[41:44] but you are a chosen
[41:47] generation
[41:49] amen you are a chosen generation
[41:52] a royal priesthood
[41:55] a holy nation
[41:57] a peculiar people that word peculiar it
[42:00] means a people for a possession
[42:04] and of course the chosen generation is
[42:07] election
[42:08] chosen
[42:10] a holy nation a peculiar people that you
[42:12] should show forth
[42:14] the praises
[42:16] show forth is the meaning if you want to
[42:18] know the meaning of declare i'll show it
[42:20] to you right now it means show forth
[42:23] make known
[42:26] lead
[42:27] amen
[42:28] so
[42:29] so
[42:31] show forth the praises of him who hath
[42:33] called you out of darkness into his
[42:36] marvelous light i want to remind you of
[42:39] isaiah 60 thy light
[42:41] is come
[42:42] yeah
[42:44] and the glory of the lord has risen upon
[42:46] thee
[42:47] amen
[42:48] amen
[42:49] so
[42:50] i'd like you to go with me now to
[42:53] isaiah
[42:55] i'm excuse me deuteronomy i'm sorry
[42:58] i said isaiah deuteronomy
[43:07] i might add we you know we we spoke of
[43:10] that possession of peculiar people in
[43:12] exodus 19 4
[43:14] moses speaking said you are
[43:17] you are a peculiar treasure
[43:21] moses told the people he said this is
[43:23] the saying of god to you you are a
[43:25] peculiar treasure
[43:27] and we know that this treasure
[43:29] which was once in one person
[43:32] are you with me our lord jesus
[43:35] is now
[43:37] is now
[43:38] in earthen vessels when once it was in
[43:41] one vessel now it's in earthen vessels
[43:44] amen
[43:45] amen so
[43:48] so now we see that it's getting a little
[43:50] loud you can turn that down a little bit
[43:53] reverberating in my ears here
[43:55] all right i'll get louder
[43:58] i'm sure anyway deuteronomy chapter 7.
[44:04] so you can look that up and i don't have
[44:06] time just to save time not go back to
[44:08] exodus
[44:09] this quote that to you but i want to go
[44:11] definitely to deuteronomy chapter 7 a
[44:13] minute
[44:17] now
[44:18] verse 6
[44:20] for thou art unholy people
[44:23] amen unto the lord thy god
[44:26] the lord thy god hath chosen thee
[44:29] to be a special people unto himself
[44:35] above all people
[44:37] that are upon the face
[44:39] of the earth

[44:47] i am a special people
[44:49] a people called for his name

[44:54] amen so
[44:55] so we are a chosen we are his not just a
[44:59] we are his
[45:00] chosen
[45:02] generation and that goes on to say the
[45:05] lord did not set his love upon you nor
[45:07] choose you because you were more number
[45:09] than any people you were the fewest of
[45:12] all people
[45:13] amen that is right few there be that
[45:16] find it many are called but few there be
[45:19] amen
[45:21] but because of the lord
[45:23] because but because the lord loved you
[45:26] and because he would keep his oath which
[45:28] he had sworn unto your fathers
[45:30] hath the lord brought you out with a
[45:33] mighty hand
[45:34] out of what now what are we brought out
[45:36] of
[45:37] dark denominationalism

[45:43] and we are mighty hand and redeemed you
[45:45] out of the house of bondman
[45:48] from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt

[45:58] lord thy god he is he is god the
[46:01] faithful god

[46:32] same source other words they're the same
[46:35] kind

[46:50] progeny

[49:22] did he mean that or didn't he mean that
[49:24] are we believers of that
[49:26] amen
[49:27] amen all right
[49:29] all right having predestinated us
[49:32] positioned us replaced us having
[49:34] predestinated or given us the place
[49:36] perdition replacing excuse me having
[49:39] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[49:41] children adoption is also placing place
[49:44] or destinate us unto placing
[49:48] unto adoption of children by jesus
[49:50] christ to himself
[49:53] according to the good pleasure of your
[49:55] will

[50:48] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[50:51] hath past tense abounded toward us in
[50:54] all wisdom and prudence

[50:57] whether wisdom and prudence is going to
[50:59] come along because it's going to be
[51:00] there it's because it's a part of this
[51:03] germ of life this gene of life this

[51:48] i'm thankful for that why do we have the
[51:51] why do we have such a glorious time in
[51:53] the mystery of his will because the
[51:55] mystery the full mystery has been opened
[51:58] the mystery that's been hid that john
[52:00] couldn't write the mystery that john
[52:02] couldn't write has been opened
[52:04] that's why we can come to ourself and
[52:06] see our position so clearly in this hour
[52:09] and walk in it
[52:11] talk in it
[52:12] live in it
[52:15] amen
[52:16] so
[52:17] having made known unto us the mystery of
[52:19] his will according to his good pleasure
[52:22] we know what the mystery of his will was
[52:24] jesus said what the father only knew
[52:27] but brother brennan i took it to you
[52:28] last sunday brother abraham said when
[52:30] jesus was glorified and went up and came
[52:33] back and and brought the revelation
[52:36] in the book of revelation the book of
[52:37] revelation is the full revelation of
[52:39] himself but it couldn't be fully known
[52:42] until the message of the seventh angel
[52:44] because that's what john couldn't write
[52:47] what jesus said he didn't know only the
[52:49] father and he said i don't because it's
[52:51] not given to me now to know it but he
[52:53] said when he came back and the
[52:54] revelation of jesus christ was given to
[52:56] him
[52:58] jesus christ then he said he said there
[53:02] that revelation was made known and
[53:04] brought to the bride
[53:06] amen now that's just kind of everything
[53:08] in a nutshell but you can look it up if
[53:10] you want the quote on it i got it amen
[53:13] so
[53:14] all right so i just want to say that
[53:16] having made known unto us who's us
[53:19] his generation
[53:21] has made unknown unto us the mystery of
[53:23] his will other words we are his
[53:25] offspring we are his race
[53:28] we are his family god is family god
[53:30] always wanted to be family and he's
[53:32] going to have a family and it's going to
[53:33] bring it all back to the way it should
[53:35] have been in the beginning
[53:38] amen that's exactly right all right so
[53:42] going back other words you're going to
[53:44] bring us back to an eden the eden again
[53:46] amen a full restored eden
[53:50] now
[53:52] having made known the mystery of his
[53:54] will according to his good pleasure
[53:56] which he hath purposed
[53:58] notice where it was purpose in himself
[54:02] that in the dispensation that's a
[54:03] dispensing notice of the fullness of not
[54:07] time because when jesus came he came in
[54:09] the fullness of time to come through a
[54:11] woman we were we brought that out sunday
[54:13] amen that was the fullness of time but
[54:16] if you notice in the 10th verse here
[54:18] this is the dispensation of the fullness
[54:20] of times
[54:24] we are at the end
[54:26] sirs is this the sign of the end
[54:29] amen all right he said that mystery of
[54:32] that book he said being open that
[54:34] seventh seal brother graham said defines
[54:37] and tells us we have arrived
[54:39] we're at the end
[54:42] amen that's the only time that book
[54:44] could be revealed was in our day
[54:47] all right so he said in the dispensation
[54:49] of the fullness of times he might gather
[54:52] together in one all things in christ
[54:57] both which are in heaven and which are
[54:59] on earth
[55:00] even in him
[55:04] amen in whom in whom
[55:07] also we have obtained an inheritance
[55:10] amen
[55:11] amen being predestinated according to
[55:14] the purpose of him who worketh all
[55:16] things after the council according to
[55:19] the purpose of him
[55:21] and we'll get into this more as we get
[55:23] into the message here i want to share
[55:24] some of these things with you being
[55:26] predestinated according to the purpose
[55:29] of him who worketh all things after the
[55:31] counsel of his own will
[55:34] amen amen no so verse 10 i want you to
[55:38] note here this is something that prophet
[55:40] has said remember

[56:12] last days to gather his bride together

[56:28] the the
[56:30] we know there has to come a falling away
[56:32] first
[56:34] amen
[56:35] uh how's that
[56:37] i
[56:38] let me just get that real quick
[56:40] i think that's in um
[56:44] yeah that's second thessalonians let me
[56:46] just read that the way it reads here
[56:50] i didn't plan on this so let me just
[56:52] look at it here
[56:57] let no man deceive you by any means for
[56:58] that day shall not come that day
[57:01] the day of christ okay that day shall
[57:03] not come except there come a falling
[57:05] away first and that man of sin be
[57:08] revealed the son of perdition now we
[57:10] know who he is
[57:13] amen it's been unveiled to us there
[57:15] shall not come so there was a turning of
[57:17] the point i'm trying to make there's a
[57:18] turning of the corner the churches the
[57:20] denominations put the word out
[57:23] this last day this last day pentecostal
[57:27] move
[57:28] organized move
[57:30] amen
[57:31] which was
[57:32] she came shuck put the word out
[57:36] prophet said it's dead it's dried up the
[57:38] spirits left it
[57:40] amen he said just put the word out there
[57:43] came a falling away but what happened
[57:45] the corner was turned into a bride age
[57:48] not another not a seventh age a bride
[57:50] time a seed time a bright age a raptured
[57:54] time he said
[57:56] amen what are we talking about life is
[57:58] in the grain again
[58:00] amen so there had to come that falling
[58:03] away for this message to be unveiled he
[58:06] said the message of the seventh angel
[58:08] was revelations 10 the opening of the
[58:11] book
[58:13] amen the seventh seal sealed that book
[58:17] that was the others his message
[58:19] amen in the days of the seventh angel
[58:22] the mystery of god the mystery this
[58:24] mystery we talked about here in
[58:26] ephesians would be unveiled yes
[58:29] amen
[58:31] all right so i just want to lay that
[58:34] background a little bit now he says so
[58:35] we have the message of the lord to
[58:37] gather his bride together no other age
[58:40] has it been promised it's promised in
[58:42] this age
[58:45] hallelujah and the prophet said always
[58:47] the messenger always comes at the end of
[58:49] the age
[58:51] amen all right now
[58:54] the purpose of god stands in election
[58:58] you know that the purpose of god stands
[59:00] in election the bible said romans 9
[59:02] as it was purpose because it was
[59:04] purposed in himself so what he foreknew
[59:09] he elected by foreknowledge
[59:11] are you aware of that first peter 2 said
[59:14] first peter 1 2 said elect according to
[59:17] foreknowledge
[59:18] all right
[59:20] now
[59:21] it was god's purpose and we know what
[59:23] god's heart purpose was if you go to
[59:25] page 149 of the older church age book
[59:28] not the new one that brother george put
[59:30] out but the the older one page 149 the
[59:34] heart purpose of god was to have a bride
[59:36] of his own choosing
[59:38] that was his heart purpose that's quite
[59:40] a statement when you realize the heart
[59:42] purpose of god
[59:45] was to have a bride of his own choosing
[59:49] see because she was chosen in him
[59:52] so he said now he said it was god's
[59:55] purpose
[59:57] to bring forth a people
[1:00:01] like unto himself
[1:00:03] that would be a word bride
[1:00:07] that would be a word bride she was
[1:00:09] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:00:11] world in him
[1:00:13] amen those words just leap at you in him
[1:00:17] she was foreknown and beloved before she
[1:00:20] was she was foreknown and beloved before
[1:00:23] she was ever brought forth during the
[1:00:24] ages upon the earth it's already done
[1:00:27] thing
[1:00:28] he first loved you
[1:00:31] that's why you love him because he first
[1:00:32] loved you do you realize and get the
[1:00:34] revelation that he first loved you
[1:00:36] nothing shall be able to separate you
[1:00:38] from that love nothing nothing
[1:00:43] hallelujah
[1:00:45] amen
[1:00:46] and so
[1:00:48] she was she was
[1:00:50] redeemed by his blood
[1:00:52] she can never come into condemnation you
[1:00:55] know what that is judgment she can never
[1:00:57] come into condemnation
[1:00:59] she can never
[1:01:01] be in the judgment
[1:01:04] how about that
[1:01:06] she could never be in the judgment oh
[1:01:08] she'll be there but she's in his throne
[1:01:12] we're talking about the white throne
[1:01:13] judgment she'll never be in the judgment
[1:01:16] why because her book
[1:01:20] remember in the judgment there were
[1:01:21] books opened and then another book
[1:01:24] books and then another book the dead
[1:01:26] they were books
[1:01:29] every bit of what they ever did every
[1:01:31] war everything else was like a book it
[1:01:33] was right there it was red it was right
[1:01:35] before them their works everything then
[1:01:37] another book
[1:01:39] and those were judged out of that other
[1:01:42] book
[1:01:43] are you with me but there's another book
[1:01:46] not a another book so much but another
[1:01:48] but a section
[1:01:50] of that book of life
[1:01:53] amen there's a section
[1:01:55] which
[1:01:56] that's already been opened
[1:01:59] hallelujah and we are judged by that
[1:02:04] and those that book of life only
[1:02:06] contains names and the book the record
[1:02:09] of eternal life also contains names amen
[1:02:13] and that's been a mystery
[1:02:17] hallelujah that's been a mystery
[1:02:20] but it's been un unveiled in this hour
[1:02:24] that mystery that mystery has been
[1:02:26] opened brother madam said what sealed
[1:02:28] that book christ he christ is those
[1:02:31] seals then what would be the revelation
[1:02:33] contained in that book it would be the
[1:02:35] revelation of christ
[1:02:37] hallelujah
[1:02:38] hallelujah
[1:02:40] amen
[1:02:42] amen satan hates you if you get a hold
[1:02:44] of the who you really
[1:02:46] are you going to fight your tooth and
[1:02:49] nail because you've done you've done
[1:02:50] escaped
[1:02:55] he can't find you even
[1:02:58] every time he comes up against it the
[1:03:00] word comes up all right
[1:03:03] all right so
[1:03:04] i got to stop these running off these
[1:03:06] sides here and keep going she can never
[1:03:09] be in judgment because sin cannot be
[1:03:11] imputed unto her that's romans 4.
[1:03:13] blessed is the man or the individual
[1:03:15] that god will not impute sin
[1:03:19] it can't be recorded against him it
[1:03:21] can't be imputed it can't be put on this
[1:03:23] record it can't even be accused
[1:03:26] because our judge said our judge said
[1:03:28] the case is dismissed
[1:03:30] there's no case against you why isn't
[1:03:32] there no case because there's no record
[1:03:34] against you
[1:03:38] amen i'm talking about the generation
[1:03:41] i'm talking about his people his bride
[1:03:42] his generation his offspring his race
[1:03:45] all right so now
[1:03:47] he said can never she can never be in
[1:03:49] the judgment because sin can't be
[1:03:50] imputed unto her
[1:03:52] this book of his now i'm going to tell
[1:03:54] you something here this is my words
[1:03:56] this the excuse me the book of his
[1:03:59] generation i said it like that which is
[1:04:01] his bride now i said it like that
[1:04:04] because you go back to genesis 5 1 and
[1:04:07] it says the book of the ju
[1:04:09] the book of the generation of adam then
[1:04:11] you go back to matthew 1
[1:04:14] and it says and it says the book of the
[1:04:16] generation of jesus christ
[1:04:19] is that right then we go to revelation
[1:04:21] 10 2 and there's another book
[1:04:24] i wonder if the book could be the gener
[1:04:26] of of his generation
[1:04:33] his generation
[1:04:35] you know brother brown said god works in
[1:04:37] threes
[1:04:39] all right so he said the book of ice i
[1:04:42] just i'm writing is my note the book of
[1:04:44] his generation his bride
[1:04:47] the original seed
[1:04:50] spoken word is the original seed hello
[1:04:54] we'll get into that just a minute the
[1:04:55] original seed their names are recorded
[1:04:58] in a book
[1:05:00] their names are recorded in a book and
[1:05:03] that book in revelation 10 2 is called a
[1:05:06] little book
[1:05:07] a little book
[1:05:12] and the brother branham said it's called
[1:05:14] it's it's a section and i'll get that
[1:05:16] just right here in a minute making it a
[1:05:18] little book
[1:05:22] the word the word doesn't
[1:05:24] god doesn't mince words
[1:05:26] it's a little book and john was
[1:05:27] commanded to eat that little book
[1:05:31] is that right what's that little book
[1:05:32] contain
[1:05:35] the hidden revelation
[1:05:36] that god hid
[1:05:38] for our day and hour
[1:05:40] of his coming and his appearance here in
[1:05:43] the earth the way he said he would
[1:05:47] now
[1:05:49] amen
[1:05:50] amen all right so here
[1:05:53] now he said the book of the generation
[1:05:56] it's called in the revelation the little
[1:05:58] book it's also brother branham called it
[1:06:00] the bride's book
[1:06:03] amen the bride's book
[1:06:05] so
[1:06:06] it must be the a book of the bride
[1:06:10] his generation
[1:06:12] what's her what's where did she come
[1:06:15] from
[1:06:16] who is she
[1:06:19] brother brahm said there's only one book
[1:06:20] can tell you
[1:06:22] where you come from
[1:06:25] and who you are
[1:06:28] what were the seals open for
[1:06:30] to show her where she come from
[1:06:32] how she was in god at the beginning
[1:06:34] go back to adam and eve we'll find the
[1:06:36] same thing open the seventh seal opened
[1:06:38] right there is what's been opened to us
[1:06:42] the revelation of himself the mystery of
[1:06:44] himself has been opened
[1:06:47] amen
[1:06:48] all right
[1:06:49] and brother brown said you'll find that
[1:06:51] threefold purpose right back in eden
[1:06:53] between adam and eve he said
[1:06:55] hallelujah
[1:06:59] all right so
[1:07:01] so he said so he said the the book he
[1:07:04] said it's hidden a book tells you who
[1:07:06] you are where you come from
[1:07:08] shows you how you'd be in christ
[1:07:11] and how you'd be revealed here at the
[1:07:13] end brother braham said that's why the
[1:07:15] seals open
[1:07:18] that's what it opened
[1:07:22] amen what is it revealing christ
[1:07:26] christ is what the mystery of god
[1:07:29] revealed and in this message was to
[1:07:32] reveal the mystery of god would be
[1:07:34] finished
[1:07:37] amen
[1:07:39] amen amen
[1:07:43] i get a little excited forgive me all
[1:07:44] right
[1:07:45] now
[1:07:46] it's called the bride's book if we go to
[1:07:48] first john you go to first john with me
[1:07:50] real quick first john
[1:07:59] first john chapter 5.
[1:08:01] read this sunday but i'm going to read
[1:08:03] it again
[1:08:04] chapter 5 verse 11
[1:08:06] and this is the record
[1:08:10] this book contains a record
[1:08:12] this is the record
[1:08:15] that god hath given to us
[1:08:18] eternal life
[1:08:19] and this life is in his
[1:08:22] son and when he made his soul an
[1:08:25] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[1:08:28] amen verse 10 of isaiah 53
[1:08:31] amen are you that seed
[1:08:35] amen are you the seed all right so he
[1:08:39] said
[1:08:41] because he's that seed
[1:08:43] is that right he's that seed
[1:08:48] all right so and verse 12.
[1:08:52] or verse 11. and this is a record that
[1:08:54] god hath given to us eternal life and
[1:08:56] this life is in his seed
[1:09:01] he that hath the seed
[1:09:03] the son
[1:09:04] hath life
[1:09:09] and he that hath not the son of god hath
[1:09:12] not life
[1:09:14] then this stone will be a stumbling
[1:09:20] amen because the stone is the word seed
[1:09:24] revealed
[1:09:27] amen
[1:09:29] the stone means revelation that's what
[1:09:31] is sown in the bible brother man said
[1:09:33] the rock anywhere you read rock god is
[1:09:35] my rock means god is my revelation
[1:09:38] amen all right so so we find then by
[1:09:42] this scripture we're finding that her
[1:09:44] name and i'm quoting now what the
[1:09:46] prophet said her name each of her
[1:09:49] members
[1:09:52] amen was written in a section of the
[1:09:55] lamb's book of life before the
[1:09:57] foundation of the world it was written
[1:10:00] in a section
[1:10:03] brother brown said the book of life and
[1:10:05] the land book of life is the same book
[1:10:07] that's what he said
[1:10:09] this is the part i want to get into
[1:10:10] these things but i can't i can't get
[1:10:12] into it tonight
[1:10:14] i want to bring it out later time
[1:10:17] but he and we did bring in part of this
[1:10:19] and we'll at tonight even here but
[1:10:23] each of her members was written in a
[1:10:25] section
[1:10:28] there are there is a part of that book
[1:10:30] whose names can be removed
[1:10:32] there's did you know that yes all right
[1:10:35] not this book but the book of life
[1:10:40] they are there's
[1:10:41] there's names can be removed from that
[1:10:43] judas was
[1:10:45] others are probably even this hour today
[1:10:47] names removed by rejecting the word
[1:10:52] amen there's a lot more to be said on
[1:10:53] that part right there but that's why i
[1:10:55] wanted to keep it later
[1:10:58] their names can be removed but there's
[1:11:00] names that will remain
[1:11:02] that are not bright
[1:11:05] they get life that are given life
[1:11:07] eternal life at the white throne
[1:11:09] judgment
[1:11:12] amen but there is a section of this book
[1:11:15] whose names could never be removed
[1:11:20] amen
[1:11:22] section means a little book
[1:11:25] are you with me
[1:11:26] all right
[1:11:28] it's a little book
[1:11:31] but it's the full revelation of jesus
[1:11:33] christ
[1:11:36] it couldn't be written but it is brother
[1:11:38] brown said but we'll find where it's
[1:11:39] written
[1:11:41] because he said you can't take something
[1:11:43] you can't take that out of the word it
[1:11:45] wasn't written
[1:11:47] john was
[1:11:49] commanded to seal it up
[1:11:52] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:11:54] seventh angel it's going to be unsealed
[1:11:57] because it's now the time for it to be
[1:11:59] unsealed
[1:12:01] amen
[1:12:02] and if that was never unsealed there'd
[1:12:04] be no rapture for you and i right
[1:12:09] because he's not complete without us
[1:12:14] it's the names of his generation it's
[1:12:16] the names of his bride
[1:12:18] amen right there so so you see it's
[1:12:21] important
[1:12:22] it's got to be unloosed
[1:12:24] but it's not known to everyone it's just
[1:12:26] known to the bride alone
[1:12:28] now i don't know who that bride is
[1:12:30] but that mystery is only known to her
[1:12:33] only known to an individual
[1:12:35] in that body
[1:12:37] amen and the body of course is a is the
[1:12:40] is himself
[1:12:44] by the planting of one seed
[1:12:48] the purpose of planting the one seed is
[1:12:50] to bring up a many-membered body
[1:12:54] of the same seed
[1:12:56] many
[1:12:57] seeds
[1:13:00] are you with me but still one seed for
[1:13:02] every member of of the body of christ is
[1:13:05] christ
[1:13:07] all right so now
[1:13:12] god is so now each of our members was
[1:13:14] written in a section of the land book of
[1:13:16] life before the foundation of the world
[1:13:18] thus if god so designed that there would
[1:13:21] be where that there that there be those
[1:13:24] names are placed
[1:13:27] in this in a section of the lamb's book
[1:13:30] of life and cannot be erased for they
[1:13:32] are the names of his bride then we must
[1:13:35] accept that
[1:13:39] see why because he's sovereign
[1:13:42] he chooses by election
[1:13:45] by shooting me by foreknowledge he
[1:13:46] elects excuse me
[1:13:49] amen are you with me
[1:13:51] he knew he knew every one of them but he
[1:13:53] can do as he will and he desires with
[1:13:56] his with
[1:13:58] his creation
[1:13:59] he's sovereign
[1:14:01] amen but he chooses or elects by
[1:14:05] foreknowledge
[1:14:07] all right
[1:14:08] now and that's just the next statement
[1:14:10] here god being sovereign he foreknew by
[1:14:13] divine decree exactly who would be in
[1:14:15] his bride
[1:14:17] he chose her she did not choose him
[1:14:20] he called her she did not come on her
[1:14:22] own he died for her he washed her in his
[1:14:24] own blood he paid the price for her she
[1:14:27] belongs to him and him alone
[1:14:32] my goodness
[1:14:34] yeah his eternal possession brother paul
[1:14:38] it is his eternal possession
[1:14:42] and him alone she is wholly committed to
[1:14:44] him
[1:14:46] and she and he
[1:14:48] i love this he accepts the obligation
[1:14:51] he is her head
[1:14:53] for christ is the head of the church as
[1:14:55] sarah called abraham lord even so the
[1:14:57] bride is happy that he is her lord he
[1:14:59] speaks and she obeys for that is her
[1:15:02] delight
[1:15:07] john 12 24 if you want to turn over
[1:15:10] there it's one seed i'm just going to
[1:15:13] reiterate that here a minute
[1:15:15] in john
[1:15:17] chapter 12.
[1:15:30] and verse 24 except a corn of wheat fall
[1:15:33] into the ground and die
[1:15:35] it abideth alone but if it die it
[1:15:39] bringeth forth much fruit
[1:15:45] a grain of wheat is planted to the end
[1:15:47] that a single grain of wheat will
[1:15:48] reproduce reproduce and multiply itself
[1:15:51] through a certain process during a
[1:15:53] certain period of time
[1:15:56] amen now you can see he's building his
[1:15:58] bride
[1:15:59] all right
[1:16:01] the single seed will die but in dying
[1:16:03] the life that was in it will come up
[1:16:06] into a plant which in turn will be the
[1:16:08] bearer or carrier of that life
[1:16:11] and we'll go more into this when i go on
[1:16:12] and go back
[1:16:15] into the other
[1:16:17] be the carrier of that life which is to
[1:16:20] come back to originality in a multiplied
[1:16:24] form
[1:16:25] come back to originality
[1:16:28] in a multiplied
[1:16:30] form
[1:16:32] hallelujah
[1:16:33] all right galatians 3 29 and if he be
[1:16:36] christ then are you abraham's seed and
[1:16:39] heirs
[1:16:40] according to the promise now watch what
[1:16:42] he said then paul
[1:16:44] goes on to not only narrow down this his
[1:16:46] definition but rather to finalize it for
[1:16:50] in galatians 3 he identified the seed
[1:16:52] singular
[1:16:54] with jesus
[1:16:58] and counted the seed
[1:17:00] children
[1:17:01] offspring
[1:17:04] as children of promise
[1:17:07] and promises having to do with election
[1:17:10] or the choosing of god and that is
[1:17:12] exactly what we've been saying these who
[1:17:14] are the royal seed are the elect of god
[1:17:19] now there is to be a royal seed in this
[1:17:21] hour if you go back to the message this
[1:17:23] day this scripture is fulfilled he said
[1:17:25] she's to come on the scene the royal
[1:17:26] seed to the royal promised son is to
[1:17:28] come on the scene in this last day it's
[1:17:31] a promise word for the hour she is to
[1:17:34] come on the scene
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:40] what's the focus then christ
[1:17:42] in the formation of his bride
[1:17:46] amen what's the focus christ in bright
[1:17:49] form
[1:17:51] if we don't see that revelation we'll
[1:17:54] never meet him in the air
[1:17:56] because this has got to come on unlocked
[1:17:59] there's got to be a spiritual union take
[1:18:02] place
[1:18:03] an invisible union
[1:18:05] all right now
[1:18:08] so
[1:18:09] the seed
[1:18:11] is the ch is the seed children the
[1:18:13] children of promise
[1:18:17] these
[1:18:19] who are of the royal seed or the elect
[1:18:21] of god are predestinated for and only
[1:18:24] god we're in the mind of god and his
[1:18:25] thoughts see he said christ and his
[1:18:28] alone christ you are christ and his
[1:18:30] alone already finished
[1:18:34] already finished he said the seed was
[1:18:38] there
[1:18:40] amen
[1:18:42] hallelujah
[1:18:44] the seed was already there
[1:18:49] when when was the seed there when he
[1:18:51] went to calvary
[1:18:52] the seed was already there
[1:18:56] when he made his soul an offering for
[1:18:58] seed sin he saw his seed it was already
[1:19:01] there
[1:19:03] it's finished
[1:19:05] you died with him and when he rose up
[1:19:07] victorious over death you raced with him
[1:19:11] what a resurrection that was but what a
[1:19:13] resurrection this is to have this seed
[1:19:16] quickened in me to recognize i'm already
[1:19:19] accepted i'm already delivered
[1:19:22] i'm already my future
[1:19:24] my future is clear
[1:19:27] [Music]
[1:19:28] clear to where clear to a body change my
[1:19:31] future is already clear all the way to a
[1:19:33] body change i'm not saying you're not
[1:19:35] going to have struggles you're not going
[1:19:36] to have pressures in your life because
[1:19:38] it's all building the character of that
[1:19:40] seed
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:43] but your future
[1:19:45] oh i don't know if i'll make it or not
[1:19:47] now with this revelation you'll know you
[1:19:49] made it or not because your future is
[1:19:51] clear those that he called him he
[1:19:53] justified those that he justified he has
[1:19:55] elsa what
[1:19:57] glorified
[1:19:59] hallelujah
[1:20:02] hallelujah
[1:20:04] already glorified brother madam said
[1:20:06] you've already got one waiting for you
[1:20:08] now who's going to take that out of the
[1:20:10] hand of god when that was already
[1:20:11] predestinated by him from the foundation
[1:20:13] of the world already in him already in
[1:20:15] his thoughts and all he did was come
[1:20:17] down here and speak the word and you
[1:20:18] responded
[1:20:22] because you always were in the word when
[1:20:25] he when melchizedek made abraham on the
[1:20:27] on on when he had the battle of he's you
[1:20:30] were already in melchizedek
[1:20:33] in the beginning was the word you were
[1:20:35] there
[1:20:37] now you bypassed your theophany comes
[1:20:39] straight out of the mind of god but
[1:20:41] you've got to understand you are his
[1:20:43] attribute you are his thought being
[1:20:46] expressed in a body of clay today
[1:20:51] because you always were
[1:20:53] eternal life
[1:20:56] amen
[1:20:58] amen oh let's get done with this i gotta
[1:21:02] get through this here okay now
[1:21:04] will you will you bear with me here
[1:21:06] all right now he said then
[1:21:10] so in very plain language now listen to
[1:21:13] this carefully in very plain language
[1:21:15] the true bride of christ was in the mind
[1:21:17] of god eternally
[1:21:22] though not expressed
[1:21:24] it was in the mind
[1:21:26] not expressed how is it going to be
[1:21:27] expressed
[1:21:29] by word
[1:21:32] amen
[1:21:34] so not expressed
[1:21:36] until each
[1:21:37] or each of you you until you came forth
[1:21:41] in your designated decreed season now
[1:21:44] this is your season
[1:21:46] what
[1:21:47] what expressed you in this season
[1:21:49] brother branham said he burst his
[1:21:51] children by speaking his word
[1:21:55] that's how god brother brad said that's
[1:21:56] how god borns his children he used the
[1:21:59] word borns that's how god bursts his
[1:22:01] children is that in their season he
[1:22:04] brings the word of himself the word the
[1:22:06] mind of god the thought of god and
[1:22:08] expresses it for that season
[1:22:12] and you hear his word
[1:22:14] you're able to receive his word
[1:22:16] he that hath an ear to hear let him hear
[1:22:18] the word let him receive it
[1:22:21] amen is that right
[1:22:24] all right so when the voice is voiced in
[1:22:27] this hour it's being voiced out through
[1:22:29] a bride amen because she comes the final
[1:22:31] voice
[1:22:34] same voice
[1:22:36] then who's going to hear it
[1:22:38] i'll tell you who's going to hear it and
[1:22:40] show it forth will be that generation
[1:22:42] because that line of blood that light of
[1:22:44] blood that life in that blood will speak
[1:22:46] to other life we are we are absolutely
[1:22:49] sent here by god to present and to and
[1:22:53] to and to um
[1:22:55] uh
[1:22:56] you represent yes but i mean to um
[1:23:00] part yes thank you impart life
[1:23:04] to who
[1:23:05] believers
[1:23:09] that's our position for being here
[1:23:11] that's our calling here in this hour to
[1:23:14] live out and manifest the word of
[1:23:16] promise for this day
[1:23:19] because you're going to catch the
[1:23:20] revelation of this day and you're going
[1:23:22] to live the just or justified will live
[1:23:25] by that faith
[1:23:28] his faith
[1:23:30] amen because it was by the speaking of
[1:23:33] that word for the season
[1:23:36] you recognize your position
[1:23:39] he gives birth born through the word by
[1:23:42] the word
[1:23:44] amen that's that's scripture first verse
[1:23:46] peter i think it's first peter 1 23
[1:23:49] we are born by what
[1:23:51] the word of god
[1:23:54] amen all right now
[1:23:57] so in very plain language each member
[1:23:59] came forth it became expressed and an
[1:24:02] expression is also manifestation of that
[1:24:05] word
[1:24:06] so it became expressed and took its
[1:24:08] place in the body
[1:24:10] thus the bride is the literal
[1:24:14] original seed thus the bride is the
[1:24:16] original a literal spoken word seed
[1:24:20] bride
[1:24:21] and though she is feminine in the
[1:24:23] designation
[1:24:25] she is also called the body of christ
[1:24:29] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:24:30] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:24:33] him
[1:24:35] came listen to this now here's your
[1:24:37] generation came from the same source
[1:24:44] came from the same source
[1:24:46] was eternal with him and is now
[1:24:49] manifesting god
[1:24:55] what will it be here in this union it'll
[1:24:57] be the son of man
[1:24:59] known again revealed again see the son
[1:25:02] of man
[1:25:04] amen
[1:25:07] think of this message we're taking it
[1:25:09] too lightly
[1:25:10] when you realize the son of man is
[1:25:12] revealed again where is he
[1:25:15] how do you know it's in me
[1:25:20] how do you know you have what you have
[1:25:22] here because it's in me
[1:25:24] here it is in me
[1:25:25] and it's making it identifying itself
[1:25:27] with the word
[1:25:30] there's my name
[1:25:34] amen all right so you came from the same
[1:25:37] source
[1:25:38] eternal with him
[1:25:40] and now manifesting god in a
[1:25:42] many-membered body whereas once god was
[1:25:44] manifested in one member even our lord
[1:25:46] jesus christ when i think of it he said
[1:25:48] denominations just
[1:25:52] leave
[1:25:56] amen it just they just pass off the
[1:25:59] scene
[1:26:00] when i see god's great purpose
[1:26:04] god's great purpose
[1:26:06] revealing himself
[1:26:09] amen and having first where was his
[1:26:11] purpose what was his purpose
[1:26:13] made known in election
[1:26:16] all right
[1:26:17] revealing himself and having first to
[1:26:20] reveal himself in christ the fullness of
[1:26:22] the godhead bodily and then bring that
[1:26:25] fullness of the godhead bodily into a
[1:26:28] people
[1:26:31] amen amen
[1:26:33] now where is he
[1:26:36] do you see him
[1:26:40] he's here
[1:26:42] what manner of people are we to be what
[1:26:44] man or person are we what man or person
[1:26:46] all we to be we ought to be what we are
[1:26:52] amen
[1:26:55] all right
[1:26:56] now man now now
[1:26:58] oh he said now the fullness of the
[1:27:01] godhead bodily is in a people that he
[1:27:03] should have the preeminence the
[1:27:04] oversight
[1:27:06] the leading
[1:27:08] where's his generation then see you see
[1:27:10] his generation
[1:27:11] all right oversight declaring who's
[1:27:14] going to declare
[1:27:16] he's declaring it
[1:27:18] and you're manifesting his declaration
[1:27:22] all right romans turn with me to romans
[1:27:24] 8.
[1:27:26] i'm going through this just as quick as
[1:27:28] i can now romans 8.
[1:27:35] romans 8 and let's start with verse 29.
[1:27:39] listen carefully to the word
[1:27:42] for whom he did for no of course we all
[1:27:44] know verse 28 and that's why he said
[1:27:47] nothing happens by chance to a believer
[1:27:48] because of that verse 28.
[1:27:51] for whom he did for no is there anybody
[1:27:54] here he's for knew
[1:27:56] your name is on the book
[1:27:58] you know your name's in the book what do
[1:27:59] you have to fear
[1:28:01] the lord is my light and my salvation
[1:28:03] and whom shall i fear
[1:28:04] the war should rise against me i'll fear
[1:28:06] not even fear the war to be a thousand
[1:28:08] fallen one side and thousand on the ten
[1:28:10] thousand the other side but it shall not
[1:28:12] come nigh me
[1:28:15] satan cannot take you and just do
[1:28:16] whatever he wants to do with you
[1:28:19] god has to
[1:28:20] control it
[1:28:23] he watches over his word
[1:28:26] amen amen
[1:28:28] all right now
[1:28:30] he said
[1:28:33] okay 8 29 for whom he foreknew he also
[1:28:36] he did predestinate
[1:28:39] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:28:43] when he went to calvary this our son our
[1:28:46] savior went to calvary he was born he
[1:28:48] had he had he was both masculine and
[1:28:50] feminist
[1:28:52] did you know that you were in him then
[1:28:55] amen
[1:28:58] so it's the same person
[1:29:01] in a many member body it's the same
[1:29:04] person
[1:29:05] now in as i said
[1:29:08] in
[1:29:10] fullness in his body
[1:29:12] bride all right now
[1:29:17] he was you he did predestinate be
[1:29:19] conformed to the image of his son watch
[1:29:21] that he might be the firstborn
[1:29:24] first born
[1:29:29] what would be the other born his
[1:29:31] generation
[1:29:32] the firstborn
[1:29:34] of many brethren
[1:29:36] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:29:39] he also called and whom he had called
[1:29:42] them he also justified and whom he
[1:29:44] justified we had already mentioned them
[1:29:46] he also glorified
[1:29:49] what shall we say then to these things
[1:29:52] if god before us who's the russians
[1:29:58] i'm just saying that to bring comfort
[1:30:00] i'm not saying that to make fun
[1:30:05] if god before us
[1:30:07] who can be against us
[1:30:10] he that spared not his own son but
[1:30:12] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:30:15] not with him
[1:30:17] also freely give us freely give us all
[1:30:19] things
[1:30:21] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:30:24] god's
[1:30:25] generation
[1:30:29] who's going to lay anything to the
[1:30:30] charge of god's bloodline who's going to
[1:30:32] lay anything to the charge of the bride
[1:30:35] it is god that justifyeth
[1:30:38] justify it it is god who declares you
[1:30:41] righteous
[1:30:44] amen it is god who declares you
[1:30:46] righteous
[1:30:50] amen all right who is he that condemneth
[1:30:56] all right good question who is it
[1:31:00] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[1:31:03] that died yet rather that has risen
[1:31:05] again who is even at
[1:31:08] the right hand of god who also maketh
[1:31:10] intercession
[1:31:12] for us
[1:31:15] amen
[1:31:17] amen amen amen who
[1:31:20] now watch
[1:31:23] it is he who is he that condemneth it is
[1:31:25] christ that died ye rather that is risen
[1:31:29] again
[1:31:31] and jesus said because i live
[1:31:34] you live also
[1:31:36] speaking
[1:31:37] to just anybody that would know
[1:31:39] speaking to his bride
[1:31:44] amen
[1:31:46] any son is the attribute of his father
[1:31:49] and this is invisible union
[1:31:52] any son is an attribute of his father
[1:31:55] just as you were in the genes of your
[1:31:57] father physically
[1:31:59] in the body of your father when he was a
[1:32:01] young boy you were in him
[1:32:05] so were you sons of god and daughters of
[1:32:08] god
[1:32:09] and let me just add this in here in the
[1:32:10] genes of your father god
[1:32:12] before there was even a moon stars or
[1:32:15] molecule you were sons and daughters of
[1:32:18] god you were you are only the physical
[1:32:21] manifestation you came directly from the
[1:32:23] thought to the bot to this earth
[1:32:26] born under a a natural physical sexual
[1:32:30] birth that was your first husband
[1:32:34] that nature
[1:32:36] that's what the prophet said invisible
[1:32:37] union that was your first husband
[1:32:39] but you had that husband had to die and
[1:32:42] when he died
[1:32:43] he died you became eternally separated
[1:32:46] from it
[1:32:47] and now you have a new nature amen
[1:32:51] amen you are a new creation
[1:32:54] because god got a hold of what you were
[1:32:56] to begin with
[1:32:58] and said you're not his you're mine
[1:33:02] and in order for you to be mine he's got
[1:33:04] to die
[1:33:04] [Laughter]
[1:33:07] amen you said yes lord that's exactly
[1:33:09] what i wanted to do die
[1:33:14] and you can't have a new birth until you
[1:33:15] die
[1:33:18] spiritually dead
[1:33:21] amen spiritually to that old husband
[1:33:24] you die to it
[1:33:28] you have to die to be resurrected
[1:33:30] all right now
[1:33:32] so he said
[1:33:34] for you are only the physical
[1:33:36] manifestation of the attributes that was
[1:33:39] in god
[1:33:40] at the beginning
[1:33:42] for there's only one form of eternal
[1:33:44] life
[1:33:45] see you're the physical manifestation of
[1:33:48] god which is living now in you you're
[1:33:50] that physical manifestation of that god
[1:33:53] today
[1:33:56] amen how many believe god's made flesh
[1:33:58] among us
[1:33:59] certainly
[1:34:00] amen
[1:34:02] what would he do how does this flesh
[1:34:04] become his
[1:34:05] because he quickens it
[1:34:08] amen he's poured his blood out claims it
[1:34:11] as his own and then quickens it
[1:34:13] by his word to his word
[1:34:16] by his spirit mean to his word amen
[1:34:22] all right
[1:34:23] so neither he said that was he said for
[1:34:26] you for there's only one form of watch
[1:34:28] what he says here for there's only one
[1:34:30] form eternal life one form of eternal
[1:34:32] life and that was you
[1:34:39] why because you were in god you came to
[1:34:41] the earth already a part of god and when
[1:34:43] you heard the voice of god you came to
[1:34:46] it
[1:34:48] now you're being manifest in a through a
[1:34:50] physical body
[1:34:52] all right so there's only one form of
[1:34:54] eternal life and that's who you were in
[1:34:56] the beginning so that one form because
[1:34:58] you were there that one form of eternal
[1:35:00] life is you
[1:35:03] you don't know nothing about it neither
[1:35:05] did you know when you was in your
[1:35:06] earthly father but you are manifested
[1:35:08] too in his image in the image of god you
[1:35:10] were made and you were manifested for
[1:35:12] his glory and fellowship of god
[1:35:16] and therefore as sure as your gene had
[1:35:18] to be in your father how many understand
[1:35:20] what it's saying as sure as your gene
[1:35:22] had to be in your father
[1:35:25] before your natural birth
[1:35:28] your spiritual gene had to be in god
[1:35:31] because you're an expression of the
[1:35:33] attributes of his thoughts
[1:35:36] oh brother sister
[1:35:38] what do we have to fear
[1:35:41] we aren't here by chance just running
[1:35:43] around
[1:35:45] we are directed we are controlled we are
[1:35:49] we are led
[1:35:52] i don't care whether you and your carnal
[1:35:54] mind reasons it and can figure it out or
[1:35:55] not quit trying to figure it out just
[1:35:57] believe and know know that he's leading
[1:35:59] and follow
[1:36:01] give way to him let go and give way to
[1:36:03] him
[1:36:05] take up your cross deny yourself and
[1:36:07] take up your cross and follow him he's
[1:36:10] leading follow him do you know he's
[1:36:12] leading
[1:36:13] then let go follow him let him have his
[1:36:15] way let him do things at your carnal
[1:36:17] mind that david i want to do things that
[1:36:19] david knows nothing about but i have
[1:36:21] complete confidence in him that he's
[1:36:22] leading
[1:36:24] then i can relax and let go
[1:36:28] [Laughter]
[1:36:30] oh brother david that's too radical
[1:36:33] i've got to have something i can put
[1:36:34] into it i've got something i can do
[1:36:36] about it
[1:36:39] if i can't reason it then it must not be
[1:36:40] god
[1:36:44] no
[1:36:47] if you can reason it you better quit
[1:36:49] your reasoning because you're flirting
[1:36:50] with another man
[1:36:52] when you go to reasoning anything about
[1:36:54] god's word now i'm not saying don't use
[1:36:56] reasoning you can use your reasoning you
[1:36:58] reason with things you do things
[1:36:59] certainly but if it disagrees with the
[1:37:01] word you better be dead to that
[1:37:03] reasoning
[1:37:05] amen
[1:37:06] or feelings or imagination or reasoning
[1:37:08] or conscience or memory
[1:37:11] amen all right
[1:37:14] oh
[1:37:15] i have to bypass some of this to get
[1:37:17] done all right now i got to get done
[1:37:20] because it's the only shot i got
[1:37:24] excuse me i didn't mean shot like that
[1:37:25] but you know it's only anyway all right
[1:37:28] now
[1:37:36] your spiritual gene had to be in god
[1:37:38] because you're an expression of the
[1:37:40] attributes of his thoughts before the
[1:37:41] foundation world no way around it that's
[1:37:43] right no way around it
[1:37:45] that life being in you god's life being
[1:37:48] in you from the foundation of the world
[1:37:50] but to the elected god is calling they
[1:37:52] know it calling the virtuous bride the
[1:37:55] last day church the elect lady of our
[1:37:57] lord jesus christ how many believe that
[1:38:00] if then he's the word you believe that
[1:38:04] all right then the bride is always part
[1:38:06] of the bridegroom so the bride will not
[1:38:08] be a denomination
[1:38:11] when we want to hear the word around us
[1:38:14] we don't want that dominating female to
[1:38:16] come around us
[1:38:18] want that spirit
[1:38:20] all right then
[1:38:23] all right then the bride is always a
[1:38:25] part of the bridegroom so the bride will
[1:38:27] not be a denomination it'll have to be
[1:38:29] the word manifested
[1:38:32] to be the bride of christ he promises
[1:38:34] she's got to be the word
[1:38:36] the word not for his day
[1:38:39] he's not the word of his day
[1:38:41] she's the word of this day
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:48] that he promised would be this day
[1:38:51] that's you
[1:38:55] well
[1:38:57] okay you're separated from unifor by
[1:38:59] from by spiritual death okay you're
[1:39:02] remarried again to the
[1:39:04] by spiritual death you died to that
[1:39:06] first union you're born again or
[1:39:08] remarried again to the new spiritual
[1:39:10] union not of your natural life of the
[1:39:13] things of the world but of eternal life
[1:39:15] listen now i'm getting these major
[1:39:17] points that germ that was in you at the
[1:39:19] beginning
[1:39:22] found you
[1:39:25] where is that life where does that germ
[1:39:27] go from how does it travel what is it
[1:39:28] traveling through the word a promise for
[1:39:31] this hour spoken
[1:39:35] amen
[1:39:37] amen all right
[1:39:38] but down on the inside of that now watch
[1:39:41] what he's saying but down on the inside
[1:39:44] of that we're talking about that spirit
[1:39:46] realm
[1:39:47] down on the inside of that second realm
[1:39:49] how many know you first realm is flesh
[1:39:51] second realm spirit
[1:39:54] amen
[1:39:55] third realm is
[1:39:57] the soul
[1:39:59] all right so he said down in the inside
[1:40:01] of that second realm
[1:40:06] is the next realm
[1:40:08] which is the third realm
[1:40:10] is the soul
[1:40:13] and that's predestinated by god brother
[1:40:15] sister that's where the word opened amen
[1:40:19] that's why you are the open word
[1:40:23] you are the secret made manifest
[1:40:26] god has come in full view of you
[1:40:29] hid
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:32] you seem you know him
[1:40:35] but this cannot be known to the public
[1:40:39] all right
[1:40:41] see
[1:40:43] you separated from your first union by
[1:40:45] spiritual death now that germ that was
[1:40:47] in you at the beginning found you so
[1:40:50] down in that third realm is the soul and
[1:40:52] that's predestinated by god there is
[1:40:54] where the real seed germ lays
[1:40:59] is in that third realm
[1:41:01] is in there
[1:41:03] let me say what he said on things that
[1:41:05] are to be he said the real you is the
[1:41:07] spirit of god
[1:41:10] the real you is the spirit of god
[1:41:12] therefore the word you are the word
[1:41:15] living
[1:41:16] and in action
[1:41:19] the bible said in hebrews 4 12 that the
[1:41:21] word of god is quick and powerful
[1:41:24] are you with me it's quick and powerful
[1:41:26] but that word quick and powerful means
[1:41:28] god means that the word is living
[1:41:31] and operative the word of god is living
[1:41:34] and operative that's why the prophet
[1:41:36] said that the bride is the word living
[1:41:40] and operative
[1:41:42] hey amen
[1:41:44] not just it's not it's not it's a living
[1:41:47] revelation a living revelation
[1:41:50] all right
[1:41:53] your old book is going with gone with
[1:41:54] your old union
[1:41:57] you stand perfectly god put it in the
[1:42:00] sea of forgiveness you stand perfectly
[1:42:03] before god
[1:42:07] thank you lord
[1:42:09] i believe that
[1:42:10] the bible said that
[1:42:12] amen your new life is in the lamb's book
[1:42:15] of life your marriage certificate
[1:42:20] sure it's in the land book of life
[1:42:22] brother brahm said in a section of it
[1:42:27] amen are you are you with me here
[1:42:30] that's why it's such a mystery
[1:42:32] because she's she is she is a she is a
[1:42:36] very special
[1:42:38] person to christ
[1:42:41] he kept her head
[1:42:42] he just let it out gradually and said
[1:42:45] now at the end i'm going to open this
[1:42:47] thing up and it'll be rapture for
[1:42:51] amen and it's quite an escasy
[1:42:55] you know that's rapture
[1:42:57] a change
[1:42:59] all right
[1:43:00] i'm i'm really trying to get done here
[1:43:04] your marriage certificate where you're
[1:43:05] true watch what he said
[1:43:07] it's your marriage certificate where
[1:43:09] your true eternal germ from the
[1:43:11] beginning takes hold
[1:43:14] now you're not only forgiven but you're
[1:43:17] justified
[1:43:19] the word justified is
[1:43:21] as if not even regarded he said
[1:43:24] as though you never did it you've never
[1:43:26] done it amen not even regarded at all
[1:43:28] how is it done it's in god's book of the
[1:43:30] sea of forgetfulness your old book in
[1:43:32] marriage is divorced and dead it's not
[1:43:34] even the memories of god it's not even
[1:43:36] in the memories of god amen you are
[1:43:39] justified
[1:43:40] therefore being justified romans 5 1
[1:43:42] being justified by faith all right
[1:43:45] he said it was you was accused you was
[1:43:48] accused you never done it
[1:43:50] you

[1:43:55] amens than that you never done it
[1:44:02] you did this you did that devil's
[1:44:04] accused you did this you did that which
[1:44:06] side you're pointing on

[1:44:11] this germ is the real me this life
[1:44:13] that's this seed quick this life that's
[1:44:15] come alive in me is the real me this
[1:44:17] holy ghost in me you talk to him about
[1:44:19] it amen you're talking to me about it
[1:44:21] i'm telling you you're a liar satan
[1:44:24] because that book that word already
[1:44:27] declared me perfect
[1:44:29] holy and without blame
[1:44:33] amen holy and without blame justified i
[1:44:36] never did it in the first place the old
[1:44:38] union is in the sea of forgetfulness you
[1:44:40] wasn't married to it to begin with he
[1:44:42] the bridegroom bore your shame himself
[1:44:45] took you took
[1:44:47] for himself for you in your place he
[1:44:49] took your place you were predestinated
[1:44:51] for him to be his bride before the
[1:44:53] foundation of the world the bible said
[1:44:55] so you are the predestinated seed
[1:45:01] how did you come to this you were
[1:45:02] deceived into it by your first marriage
[1:45:06] to your adulterous parent eve it's no
[1:45:08] fault of your own
[1:45:10] but that's why you got to be born again
[1:45:12] see how simple the new birth is if you
[1:45:15] realize it's no fault of my own and i've
[1:45:16] been deceived into this thing and now
[1:45:18] god gives me an open door
[1:45:20] to come up higher
[1:45:22] amen
[1:45:24] amen are you with me
[1:45:26] why not accept it
[1:45:32] amen
[1:45:33] it's very easy to accept
[1:45:35] not reason no god made it very easy
[1:45:38] to believe his word he said just accept
[1:45:40] it
[1:45:42] claim it believe it accept it quit your
[1:45:45] reasoning about it quit trying to put
[1:45:46] your own opinion to it just accept it
[1:45:49] satan gave the opinion
[1:45:53] amen are you with me
[1:45:54] he made it complicated
[1:45:57] it's just simple
[1:45:59] just accept it
[1:46:01] believe it can you believe it
[1:46:04] amen
[1:46:06] amen it's your absolute all right you
[1:46:09] were deceived
[1:46:11] into it
[1:46:13] amen it's not your fault it ain't your
[1:46:15] fault now watch what he says you didn't
[1:46:18] you never did it
[1:46:20] because that little germ that was in you
[1:46:23] was to be you
[1:46:27] how can he impart
[1:46:29] how can he impart anything
[1:46:31] against the elect when they were in him
[1:46:33] to begin with if he imparts sin against
[1:46:35] if he imparts any of this stuff against
[1:46:37] him he's imparting it against himself
[1:46:42] he can he can't part sin to himself
[1:46:47] amen
[1:46:48] that's why he said just awaken awaken
[1:46:51] what awakened us the seven thunders

[1:47:09] been done still looking for it to happen
[1:47:11] still looking for it to happen
[1:47:13] he said it already didn't happen what
[1:47:14] they haven't recognized is the awakening
[1:47:16] of the bride
