Hebrews 11. and we'll begin reading with verse 5 and verse 6. he was 11 I'm sorry to mix that up back there I told my brother where we was going and then I change I didn't change it he changed it I'll put the blame on him it's not blame it's perfect in what he does how many believe that okay Hebrews 11. verse 5. excuse me all right bye faith I want you to notice this faith is a revelation revelation is faith all right by Faith by Revelation Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony remember there's going to be Overcomers here that are going to have a testimony a testimony of a true Witness we find that in Revelations 12 11. amen they are they are Washed by the blood the blood of the Lamb the Overcoming By the blood of the lamb and the testimony which they held is that right all right so God had translated for before his translation he had this testimony he pleased God how did he please God the prophet said with rapturing faith amen and so the next verse says answers it for without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is he must have faith that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently diligently not slothily amen not dilatorily that's right that's how the that's how the the tribulation Saints one of the reasons they missed didn't have the oil was it was dilatory amen all right so in them that diligently seek Him Hebrews 11 1. now Faith is the substance now Faith Revelation is the substance it's not imagination it's not a feeling it's not an emotion it is an actual substance now Faith is the substance didn't say would be or it is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so it's the evidence of eternal life we live not by the things which are seen but the things that are not seen amen is that right things that are not seen are eternal all right you may be seated if you put that first quote up sister on infallible word of God I want you to notice the title first of all the infallible word of God infallible means this incapable of making mistakes or being wrong incapable of making mistakes or being wrong you were in him before the foundation of the world you are his thought of himself expressed you are his word that's the bride infallible word amen are you with me all right so incapable of making mistakes or being wrong other words perfect Flawless error-free faultless precise accurate never failing amen let's read this quote you can follow with me as I read it here so it so isn't it wonderful to know yes it is what is that no faith isn't it wonderful to know that it's all settled amen that you can know that you know your future is clear amen all right you have you have a a expected end it's all settled I just love it don't you just that perfect satisfaction and no or knowing that his Spirit lives in you that his Spirit something you know that his Spirit lives in you that lives in you is an abiding it's a difference to have the spirit abiding you than just anointing you amen certainly we love the anointing certainly we have to have the anointing the water of the anointing Must Fall upon the seed but then it ought to bring but then the seed is made manifest that's the word in spirit form living in you amen all right now what is it doing bearing record of the resurrected Jesus Christ remember Romans 8 16. what's he bear record with or give or what's he bearing witness with your spirit amen it Bears record with your spirit that we are the children of God amen are you with me that's Romans 8 16. what is that spirit it's a Sanctified Spirit he won't come he won't he'll work through the spirit which is a sanctification but you've got to go beyond sanctification don't you the new birth is the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the seed that's the new birth you can't have a new birth without the seed laying there by pre or other words predestinated there it was placed there before the foundation of the world all right now so you're very so the spirit living in you is bearing witness or record of the resurrected Jesus Christ and right to living friendship with him every day not trying to live this or live that but him in you just lives his own life out going where he wants you to go saying what he wants you to say doing what he wants you to do that's the way to live isn't it and you people who are living that way speaking to you tonight God bless you my dear brother and sister and just strive and pray for others to come into that wonderful faith the Revelation in Christ Jesus what is that Revelation it's the faith of Jesus Christ amen all right and that never failing that infallible I think I already mentioned that it's never failing word if you'll put the next quote up in perfect faith my sister listen I'm wanting to read these first before I go further in the word here delay a little Foundation this is the perfect faith paragraph 68. now the only thing you have to do that is have faith in what you are you now the only thing you have to do is have Revelation who's going to give you that Revelation and how does it come you can't please God otherwise without it and we're not talking about a faith brother Brown we'll say this a little bit later we're not talking about a faith but substance faith perfect faith there's only one perfect Faith that's God's own faith amen and to have God's own faith has to have God in you Hallelujah all right now so the only thing you have to do is have faith we'll come back to he'll come back to this a little bit is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are and Jesus you know what the word says you are the word says you are him the problem brother Brown said every promise that pertained to Jesus Christ pertains to the bride praise the Lord all right he said he said now have faith in what the word says you are and Jesus had Faith Revelation in the word of God that said what he was it is it is written of me can you take this word and realize it's written of you it never was written of you to be a failure it's written of you to be Eternal it's written of you to be a part of him it's written of you as an overcomer more than an overcomer all right said and and Jesus had faith in the word it's written of me didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets and all then speak of him I am the member I said is spoke of him can you see yourself written there he said I am the bread of life that came from God out of Heaven you see brother sister that was the hidden Mystery that God had in the back part of his mind that he was not to let out until the opening of the word or the book containing the record of his bride that's why without that open book we'll never have a Rapture in our body it takes that opened record not not opened at the white Throne judgment open to us now we have the record opened and the judge is saying there is no fault in her she is me she is who I am she's myself revealed the bride is himself quoting brother Branham the bride is himself revealed that's the faith we're speaking of all right he said and Jesus he said didn't David the psalm the prophet all of them speak of him I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven amen I am that tree of life from the Garden of Eden did not he say there would be another Tree of Life in Bride form in this hour was there not to be a bride tree Hallelujah another pass Masterpiece in the making a second fold of a three-fold revelation amen all right he said he said I am all he said from the garden on the tree of life from the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am that I am and he knew with that perfect faith substance faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the may not isn't that exactly pouring out his Spirit Upon Us anointed Messiahs of this day did not he say that in perfect Faith paragraph page 27 did not he say you're in this little bride is the anointed Messiah of this age manifesting the resurrection of Jesus Christ showing that Resurrection what is it it's not a in action it is an action of the word made manifest himself amen so he said I am that I am he knew that with that perfect Faith he was the anointed Messiah who is that anointed Messiah the anointed one who is the anointed one the anointed word who is the anointed word Christ Hallelujah all right he said that the spirit he knew that perfect faith that by Perfect faith that he was anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I in myself you in yourself so you have to die to self you have to surrender yourself it's a surrendering every day we die daily we take up our Cross of death and follow what do we do we're denying ourself our own ability our own thinking our own ideas contrary to the word of God right and follow that headship that is in you leading amen all right he said he said he said now I and myself do nothing it's but it's my faith notice what he said it was but it's my faith in God and God was in him how faith revelation God was in him was it God revealed in him that's what made him the son that's what made God the son that's what makes in God in you God the bride Hallelujah all right he said he said now I and myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him the word made manifest God was in him the word made manifest and when the word come the word of God comes in you the word is God God is the word comes in you it's made manifest for you are a believer see what's the identification that you're a Believer then the unveiling of himself in you the word all right and so it's made now made manifest who's made manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever all right he said now it's made manifest for you are a Believer see and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you moves Moves In You now we'll come to that further as we go along he said you like that I'm through that okay you like that I like teaching of what faith really is now watch he said if he abide in me and my word in you now I'm going to stop here a minute go to First Corinthia or second Corinthians chapter 5. hmm II Corinthians 5 and we'll read with starting with verse 16. and 17. therefore let's it will just take 16 with it wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh foreign let's just start at verse 14. just give you a background for the love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead amen and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves goes right with the sermon Sunday but unto him which died for them and rose again him where him and you him in the word the word in you all right wherefore henceforth wherefore henceforth we know no man after dead flesh we know no man after the flesh your flesh you find no good thing in your flesh so don't quit quit trying to judge yourself by your flesh your mistakes your failures your your inactions you're this you're that but what's in the soul what's revealed where's the evidence lay it lays in the unveiling or revelation of Christ in you that you're his seed what will that do live the word it moves in you all right not something you do he said not something you tried to do live this live that but he works and you acts in you Works speaks in you amen does in you it's a daily living it's not just a church it's a daily living he doesn't change when you're in church and then change when you're out amen he's the living word living person Amen brother Trevor a living person the living person eternal life person all right let's let's go with this a little bit as we go further here so we know no matter for the flesh though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth no we him no more after the flesh you can't judge yourself by your outward God doesn't so why should you I'm speaking to the bride tonight amen all right therefore If any man be in Christ amen there's the big statement in Christ when were you in Christ before the foundation of the world amen you were existing in his thought you were in him then he chose you before the foundation of the world all right and and you're and therefore If any man be in Christ he is now watch this Revelation he is a new creation a new creature not the old creature patched up this is a new creature this is a birth creature by the word of God by the thought of God expressed in word for this season he births you that's what the message of the hours to do Amen brother Brandon when he started his message his ministry he laid the foundation he laid the Cornerstone is that right what was his ministry doing taking these loose taking these loose things that had been forgotten through the years right baptism eternal security predestination amen on and on but what happened the corner was turned and the coroner became the head to cap off that building which takes The Headstone Ministry and the seventh seal message of Revelations 10 is The Headstone Ministry it's the Capstone Ministry this is our perfecting this is our perfection we're not going to make a bride without coming into that stature brother brother Marcus made it very clear you grow up into him and we have a scripture here you must grow it's not the the new birth you're an infant but you must grow now and what how do we grow we'll come to it in a minute but from glory to glory another place that said from Faith to Faith amen amen all right from Faith to Faith Enoch walked like that Enoch walked with God from Faith to Faith with a raptured faith he said pleasing God he had this testimony that he pleased God Glory so the new creature we're talking about is a person and that person is the unveiling of the word in you now let's let's see what he said here and he said All Things become new now let's let's go to another quote here but the real believer no matter what they are he said no matter what excuse me but the real believer no matter what they are thoroughly satisfied they are thoroughly convinced because the life that's in them has already become Christ there's the person what is the New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ in you unveiled Christ in you identification that you're sealed to the day of your Redemption that you're faultless that you're sinless that you are found and always was in him it's your identification it's your evidence Hallelujah what did Abraham have to have the Seal of circumcision as a sign a token that his faith was received it was accepted by God amen what did God see his faith what did man see that Faith living so the faith in you moving in you is the real believer there's the believer you know we'll have to look at yourself no more you don't have to look at your ideas your failures look to Christ who's revealed in you that's the real believer you are not counted an unbeliever you are counted as a True Believer you are his seed you are his life Hallelujah Hallelujah he said he said they are thoroughly convinced because the life that's in them has already become Christ it is Christ it's no more you glory to God point that back at the Devil and tell it bring it back to the word this is written of you it's no more you greater is he that is in you you see it's no more you glory to God it's a revelation of who you are it's a revelation that you are an accepted True Believer Hallelujah Hallelujah he said it is Christ it's no more you but Christ that lives in you no more you but Christ that lives in you and no matter there is nothing Paul said present future death Peril nakedness whatever it is can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ you see there's a perfect satisfaction in every trial in every test that's sent to you that's come your way by God's Direction by God's leadership everything he does is perfect all that he allows you to go through is absolutely working for your good it's it's gold try it in the fire it's for your it's for you to glory in him it's for the manifestation of his character it's absolutely for you to be brought to a place where you've manifested and glorify him and live for him in this hour proving him to the world amen we are here for that purpose to live Christ to others to bring Christ to others amen we are here for that very purpose after we become his property our confession and our baptism and our promise to walk in life with him for him then every trial that comes upon us is perfect is to perfect us for his glory it's to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial come amen and remember no matter how great the distress is Satan cannot take your life until God is finished with you and who's the real believer God in you God above us God With Us now it's God in you eternal life in you amen amen see until God's finished with you there's nothing can happen to you unless God permits it there's no evil can come unless God permits it and it's for your good he's working that why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble puts bits in his mouth makes it obey him do you see what we just read here at the very beginning he said in right living friendship with him every day not trying to live this or that but his own life living out going where he wants you to go through this trial that trial so would God lead you into trials you bet he does he loves to do so because he knows without it you'll never be in a Rapture you could never meet him in the air that's your growth that's your growing time amen but you need to keep your focus on who's the believer amen that's right don't turn to the right or left of that just remember that every one of those things you're going through just remember it's for your good it's for your benefit it's it's to bring you to the place where you're glorifying him hey man that's right we are here as a very manifestation of himself the complete revelation of God is who we are in this hour did you know that we are the complete Revelation Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of God in this hour of the whole thing my talk about Destiny amen you can't there's no way if God comes in and seals you that real believer and there's going to take you right into a body change it's got to he's already identified it he's already identified you've got a glorified body waiting he's already identified during you've heard from your theophany he's already identified that you the the outfit of you bypassed you've got to come to it it's already there waiting convinced of it and he's leading it perfectly to bring you to that place can you believe that can you accept that can you look beyond your own self-motives can you look beyond your own self feelings and realize who the believer is where are you identified where are you identified what does identify you amen all right see now where was I gotta go back here all right he we asked for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations but that's part of his plan that's part of his leadership going where he wants you to go saying what he wants you to say doing what he wants you to do forget your own reasoning and figuring out that those things right there recognize who you are recognize him in you know it it's not an it's not an imagination it is an actual Revelation which is substance Hallelujah all right and he said trials and tribulations are better than comfort and peace and yet I'm talking about perfect satisfaction why because perfect satisfaction lays in the reality of the revelation of the True Believer which is Christ in you which you are hallelujah it's a person it's a leadership of eternal life how are you going to go wrong when you're led by eternal life right amen how can you go wrong when you're meant to go right well the right is the harder way Brother David but the harder way is the way of comfort and peace it is if as long as you're in Christ forget your feelings your feelings is not your identification God's not dealing you about Ways by ways of your flesh anymore he's he's taking this body and quickening it by the Holy Ghost that's in you bringing it subject to the word then let him do it the way he wants to do it sovereignly Hallelujah Hallelujah that's right all right so see it's Christ no more you but Christ that lives in you no matter no matter and no matter there is nothing nothing future present naked whatever can separate you from the love of God's kind not not not no no many how many of this that or or other Rise how many doctors of divinity can explain it away and say it's for another day and they're saying it right here in the message well that's for another day that's for another day yet to come or that's another day that was passed no it's right now we're living right now yes there's things for the future but live right now live what you have right now live where you are right now walk with him amen what a place you want to make you have a Rapture walk with God you want to go on a Rapture walk with God right it's all about walking with God I'll be with you even in you I will never leave you nor forsake you I will be in you that's walking with God okay okay all right now it's Christ see nothing can separate you at all you're there to stay it's in you it's excuse me it's you in Christ you're no more your own that's you and God Alone he said that's you he said that's you what is you what is the real you the faith that's in you the spirit of God that's in you that's the real you now there is the believer praise the Lord you didn't know you had that kind of belief did you who's that believer perfection who's that believer your headstone who's that believer your husband who is he where is he he's one with you talk about a union and talk about a place I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit so let's back up here a minute all right now now watch if you abide in me and my word abides in you don't lose that word abide if you abide in me and my word in you abiding in you you can ask what you will it'll be done what you will what do you have the faith what is the will his faith your confession should be the confession of faith amen now let me just say something here intellectual faith is not perfect there is an intellectual faith people do great things with intellectual Faith they can be anointed to do great things with intellectual faith do you know that but that's not perfect Faith No More Than filial Love is perfect love amen but where perfect love is perfect Faith exists with it because perfect love is God and perfect faith is God the believer are you with me but that perfect Faith Works by that love so you can you'll go back to First Corinthians 13 and you'll find without charity none of those things matter you can have a knowledge you have a knowledge of the truth you can even you can quote the messages you can even bring forth the Mysteries intellectually and be right but without the nature of that love Christ in you living you're not connected with the word boy that was a good one amen that Nature's got to be in you living that word recognizing hearing the word for your season your time your age your moment this is bright age we're gone above the layout to see you we're in the bright age we're in bright time we're in the seed time who is that Christ in you the True Believer Christ in you the new creation Christ revealed in you you are that believer amen all right now so God is the only God's faith is the only Faith that's perfect amen thank the Lord all right and if you want to find where I said Faith worketh by love that's Galatians 5 6. Galatians 2 20 said that we live by the faith of the son of God I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God his faith and if it's his faith in you working you're going to come to the realization and knowing of where you're standing Who You Are by that Faith by that spirit because he's going to lead you into all truth he's going to guide you not away from the word but into the word more and more the path of the just is as a Shining Light clear and clearer unto that perfect day what's the perfect day our meeting in the air amen that perfect realization of the faith that's in you that brings you there amen amen yes faith in you israelization but it brings you to a perfect completion amen it's always Faith first it has to be faith Hallelujah God has made that thus he even proved it between Cain and Abel it was Faith Revelation that made the difference both religious both boys seeking God both had a church but revelation of the word was the evidence that Abel was the seed of God amen amen amen talk about a perfect evidence amen all right ability to hear Brother Brown said it isn't love that's the evidence he said it's the ability to hear the word for the season for your time and what will that Faith do live the word because it's God in you living oh my what a place what a relationship what a union all right now so you see recognize your pre okay if you abide in me in my word in you ask what you will to be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his position now you must believe what you asked for if you are a Believer recognize yourself as a Believer recognize these things are for you if there's condemnation in your life straighten that first because you can't have no confidence in what you ask for of God unless if there's condemnation all right I can do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was see he relied knowing that he was the word that he had faith in God who made him the word amen because he understood Faith give Faith because he understood his position therefore he relied upon what God had made him he relied upon what God had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what God made us as believers and not has he hath it's just being manifested that you always were in him if you know where you come from then you know who you are and if you know who you are then you know where you're going amen all right if you are a Believer have faith in what you are you are a Believer and these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was amen have faith in what you are that's what God's trying to get across to this tonight is that faith that real believer in what that's who you are who identifies that who identifies Christ in you who identifies that you were in him before the foundation of the world when you catch that Revelation there's not enough devils in Hell could take you out of that because you always were you're as Eternal as he was eternal you are eternal life living in you don't look to this outside man and say well do I have eternal life or don't I know look to what God's revealed in you look at what he's made manifest in you look at himself in you then he said I'll bring this body under obedience to my word and that might lead you through trials and tests all right but do you have confidence in his he that's in you do you know he's in you do you know that that is your identification my we have a face-to-face identification all right so we don't need to live in Vertigo anymore not knowing where you are upside down right side up why is this happening why is that happening just look at the pilot in you he's watching keeping you in line with the word so we don't fly by sight do we we fly by revelation I like that I think Chris does too that's piloting he's our pilot right I got confident he says no no you're turning left you think you're turning right you think you're climbing says no you're diving you think you're right side up he says you're upside down or you think you're upside down he said no you're right side up amen hallelujah amen where's your confidence where's your identification who are you are you a True Believer than if you are you're in Christ the person is in you the person this we're talking about a person unveiling of Jesus Christ and you the person that's who you are well it could be him but it's not really him yes it is him the same word just made flesh in him is the same word made flesh in you you come from the same source as he did being predestinated as he was makes the Word Flesh in you as it was in him amen amen amen all right now the real believer no matter they are thoroughly satisfied they are thoroughly convinced amen okay I already read that they but I but that has to be said again they are thoroughly satisfied they are thoroughly convinced it's Christ in them we have the faith of the Son of God Mark 11 22 says have faith in God the right translation on that is have the faith of God have the faith of God if you have the faith of God you say to this mountain to be moved and not doubt in your heart amen you can have what you said is that right all right second Corinthians 4 if you turn to me over there real quick please second Corinthians 4 7. but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels what what treasure do we have God come who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in your hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ other words face-to-face Revelation here he absolutely reveals Who You Are in the very presence that face of Jesus Christ is in the presence of Jesus Christ himself in you you've gone behind the veil you've gone behind the inside of the inside and you realize it's not the outward man that identifies you at all it's that Inside Man what is that Inside Man amen there's your anointed word there's your Messiah there's the believer amen amen we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us all right now I could go right on down we're troubling every side not distressed go right down you can read that I want to come to verse 13. we have the we having the same spirit let me read that again we having the same Spirit of faith so this faith in you a revelation of Christ in you is a spirit it is the holy spirit there is your believer there is your identification there is you are identified you are My True Believer you're not a make-believer you're not a pretender you're not an unbeliever you are a real believer filled with oil filled with revelation amen not missing the hour not missing the time God identified in you all right without the person of Christ in you you won't be in a rapture because the person of Christ in you unveiled is the rapture and therefore you already have the substance of the Rapture because the Rapture is a revelation Hallelujah the Rapture is a revelation then you have Rapture already amen then you have the substance of the thing that's promised you and expected end a new body Hallelujah because you're already identified in Melchizedek Hallelujah then you can say looking Beyond the Veil this opened right up said who is this Melchizedek Hallelujah oh the other David you're getting foolish no I'm not I'm dead serious that's exactly the truth all right now verse 13 we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed amen how many Believers we have here I believed and therefore have I spoken and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak now Romans 10 8 said what let's go over there just a minute with that scripture in mind let's go over to Romans chapter 10 verse 8. but the righteousness which is of Faith verse 6. speaketh on this wise saying you don't say in your heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above somebody has got to go up there and bring him down somebody's got to come up there we've got to have a prophet lead us we've got to have a church we got to have an organization some we lead us to where we can go where he is bring him down here we can't have faith until he comes back I'm not making fun but that's the definite strong Spirit today amen amen now watch he said here he said who shall Ascend into heaven and bring him down from above who shall us descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ from the dead but what's saith it the righteousness of Faith what does this righteousness of Faith say the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth why why and in thy heart what is in thy heart what is in thy mouth the word of faith revelation that we preach I wish I could explain it to you but we can't explain it to anybody it's up to God to reveal it but it comes by hearing that preached by hearing the word all right okay I could go further you can read that further if you'd like but Romans 10 8 so we having the same Spirit of faith therefore we speak we believe and therefore speak all right now second Corinthians 3 excuse me and those always wants to run when they preach second Corinthians 3 verse 2. you are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for so much as you are manifested declared to be the epistle or the written word ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart that's where the Prophet said we'll find where it's written although we'll find words written in the scripture too but where's it got to be written to be manifest in your heart all right he said and in and such trust have we through Christ to God's word not that we are sufficient of ourselves no human ability no see to think anything as as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God that's our abilities of God Amen who also has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter you could have an intellectual understanding of all you want the message the letter everything but unless God can take that letter and bring it out there in Revelation and reveal to you the thought behind those words letters amen how can you be connected to that unless God's in you that would lead you into that truth there you are see see yeah you say well brother God brother Graham said a right mental attitude yes you have to receive it that way a right mental attitude or any promise will bring it to pass but when it drops down into your soul as a substance it's yours that's it settle nothing can ever move that oh Satan will try to but he can't move it because he can't enter into that which is behind the veil because if he comes he has to come through the blood so he can't get where you dwell he can't get to you your dwelling that's why no no plague shall come nigh your dwelling because your dwelling is in Christ amen amen amen amen all right now so we come down to verse 16. nevertheless oh but we're Ministers of the spirit for the letter killeth the spirit giveth life verse 16 nevertheless the Bible said the veil is upon their heart Israel as as Moses is read nevertheless when it IT the heart shall be returned shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty amen not anguish not droopy lip disease no complaining and murmuring and I know the flesh does that but we are commanded to keep it under subjection and the more this unveils to us that who we are we grow into that manifestation we grow into that headship we grow into that Capstone Revelation that's perfection you can't go any higher than the Capstone that Capstone is our perfecting we grow up into him amen it's not growing up perfecting this it's growing up into him that's the maturity that's the Perfection he was speaking about amen so let us go on to Perfection not stay in the baby stage let's go on feed on the word and be fed upon the open book and feed on the open book amen and grow into that stature of himself because this ministry this message this opening of these seals this message of the seventh angel is the Capstone message it's The Headstone message and brother Branham said the head and the body has look at how he's projecting watch how he he already sees that already a finished work he said has become one unit and this is an individual affair but he saw that body perfect has the heads been uncovered the head's been revealed from heaven and now he's uniting with his bride and they are becoming one four the Celebration The Wedding supper of a marriage a union amen amen all right now so we see verse 17 Liberty where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty but we all with open face not veiled face an open face the seventh Seal's been opened that which is perfect is come amen and not looking through a veil anymore we're not looking at this Darkly we are looking at this face to face this is what changes us from glory to glory we are being changed amen we see as he sees us this is what the opening is to us is to realize he's here in Bride form who is it the revealing of the son of man at your position amen hallelujah all right verse 18. but we all with open face beholding is in a glass a mirror the glory of the Lord are changed raptured change what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is amen what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to come out of Darkness into the manifestation of light God is light that's the message God is light and in him is no Darkness at all and if you walk in the light as he is in the light you have fellowship with him and if you have fellowship with him every member of the body is himself amen so you see where our fellowship is is under the blood is in the light and if we're not walking in the light it's not you're not under the blood well that's a good one if we walk in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us amen amen all right now then the glory of the Lord we are changed we are faced open face beholding is the glass the glory of the Lord what is the glory of the Lord his wife his own Glory he did not would not share that with another but he will share it with himself did you know that the Bible said he won't share his glory with another but you are not another that's exactly right you go back to Isaiah 60 and see if the light the light is upon you bride and the glory of the Lord is seen upon you amen that's right amen and this Lord we're speaking about is your husband and the wife is the glory of the man amen it's an unveiling you see it it's an unveiling your Victory is unveiled I didn't even read I didn't even finish my scriptures while we're at this pause and I'm going to quit in just a few minutes first John let's go to first John five four let's look at this very familiar scripture for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world overcometh the world's system overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even the Revelation that we are the Believers even our faith amen is that right even our faith that's right our Revelation what is it the revelation of Christ in you the new creation is a person Christ in you don't keep him back there in the manger he's your head amen amen yeah he's birthed in a Manger all right the brother sang about it tonight amen he's birthed in you isn't he the holy spirit overshadows that seed and brings himself to life it's an unveiling of Christ in you that's your victory that's the victory that overcometh the world and who is it it's Jesus Christ our Revelation is Jesus Christ all right so then let's go back to Second Corinthians 3 again so then we are changed into the same image from glory to glory even is by the spirit of the Lord because we look into the glass we see a person and that person that open face that person is Jesus Christ and we realize mama Daddy father that's me okay therefore and that's a direct quote by brother Brandon he said you look into that glass and you see that Glory he said that's you that's what he said amen all right he said you're seeing yourself all right therefore seeing we have this ministry we have this message we are the message we are the manifestation of eternal life we are his eternal possession we are his kingdom our headship is a kingdom and the kingdom of God is within you we don't belong to a denomination we belong to a kingdom the kingdom of God is within you amen and the kingdom of God is the word of God made spirit and life in your own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word in God Was Won and the word and God is one in his bride today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day so where's the final voice you are the final voice under her messenger the bride becomes the final voice to the final age who's the people hearing from today he that knoweth God heareth us because why you are of God and have overcome them because greater is he a person he and a person that's in you than he that's in the world then he that he and you has overcome your enemy amen are you with me has overcome your enemy This Old Man greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world this body is not born again amen are you with me but it will come to a change it has to because the god that put himself in you will change it you have a glorified body waiting so you don't have to look at this anymore look Beyond the Veil look beyond your senses look beyond the camp look beyond your feelings look Beyond and see eternal life see the real believer okay it's about ready to close this off Galatians 5 1 says this Stand Fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage steadfast in the Liberty what is the Liberty where the Liberty is the spirit of the Lord is Stand Fast in your Liberty of the revelation of Who You Are and don't fear there's no fear of man if you fear man then you've got confidence in man if you fear man you're gonna you're gonna serve and believe who you fear remember that amen we have no other one to serve we have no other one to bow to but this perfect infallible word of God in you you are that word you cannot fail you cannot pass away because he said she won't she's predestinated not to she can't fail she can't fall why because she's in the unfailing one she's she's in the infallible one she's identified everything you were was in him when he went to Calvary you were already you have been already accepted in the Beloved you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and Without Blame before him in Love Therefore the bride is sinless she's a True Believer how can you be in the in the sinless one and not be sinless you tell me that how are you going to be in the sinless one to not be sinless amen praise the Lord Hallelujah we must feed and I said be fed on the open book that book's been opened to take us home that folk has been opened the record of eternal life that little section of that book of life has been opened that's the bride record and her name can never be removed and she's already had a reckoned her record is opened amen amen amen glory to God we've got a lot to say in that and I need about four Services brother Paul it's true so whenever the Lord moves on you I've got four services about the white Throne judgment amen I'm not making fun of that that that is so fun it's so powerful so God help us there'll be a right time I believe that whether I ever preach it here or not it's going to be preached somewhere amen not by me by him the True Believer you say you're pretty bold in saying that I'm I may be bold but I love you all and I love him and when you love him like I love him like he loves you you can be bold amen amen all right you have to recognize yourself as a believer Ephesians 4 12. one of my last scriptures here and we're closing and I'm not come I've done pretty good tonight Ephesians 4 12. for the work this this the the fivefold ministry just put it that way is the ministry for the perfecting of saints for the maturity completeness of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body the building up of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith amen that's perfect Faith till we all come in the unity of God's own faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto and that knowledge isn't a head knowledge that's divine revelation unto a perfect man now knew no good and well that David is not perfect but David is perfect David isn't perfect but the real David on the inside is and that's where I'm identified it doesn't matter how the how the flesh man wants to speak to you oh he'll speak anybody heard him speak today to you oh yeah your own carnal spirit will speak to you that can't be reasonable that can't happen you know that's not oh yes it is God Said So how do you answer it it is written where is it written in you Jesus Took Satan back to what was written of him you can do the same thing for the word of faith the word of Revelation is in your mouth amen that's right and when it's revealed to you you speak it's got to happen because God's speaking now verse 14 that you hence until we come into perfect Faith to a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children children children toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate slight of men and cunning craftiness and whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love May grow up into him in all things may grow up into him May grow up into him who are you in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplier according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen amen all right now greater is he that is in you as we said than he that's in the world then if it's then who is in you that's greater it's Christ then it's not you anymore living it's him living in you it's not your thinking of what you think about this is what he said about it he absolutely being you would not absolutely could not deny what he said he couldn't do it amen he's trying to find that person that he can vindicate himself through amen the phrase Isaiah 9 6 I won't go into all this but the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony the East when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil places it over the groom's shoulders sanctifying now remember the marriages come all right signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her I want you to listen carefully I don't I I just want you here real closely what these words are saying that he that she has transferred her rights to him for the Paul there's your ministry surrendered completely that he is the head but also that he bear that he he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and the care the responsibility and the care that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility what a piece what a quietness what a rest what a satisfaction that he no he's responsible he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come in her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for you her she belongs to him you belong to him and to him alone she is wholly committed to him You Are Holy committed to him and he accepts Glory the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of his church there is your perfection The Head and the body brother Brown said Christ The Mystery of God revealed The Head and the body has become one unit the message of the hour this message of the hour that we are the Capstone message the ministry this is our ministry second Corinthians 4 1 seeing we have this ministry we think not perfect satisfaction perfect rest the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley still not the seed still not perfect are you with me through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostal still not perfect still small little infant amen and what what did the baptism Holy Ghost which is the new birth what did the baptism the Holy Ghost Make Way for the Holy Ghost himself to come right down in what perfection there's your True Believer amen again right back to the word Perfection again right back to the word in the beginning was the word so God is now family he has a bride a bride of his son all that he was he poured into Christ all that Christ was is poured into his bride where is he now where is the head where's the head now where is he in what he said Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing can you imagine that God is not complete so God is family isn't he now he has a complete Masterpiece family ready for what the third fold Eden amen going right back to Eden brother bam said right back to the original amen amen remember the Bible said that he knows his thoughts concerning you Jeremiah 29 11 he knows his thoughts concerning you what are those thoughts concerning you thoughts of himself that's exactly what they are thoughts of himself what are those thoughts of himself being tangible thoughts of you when he thought of you and thought of others he thought of himself becoming tangible amen is that right you have that what no he said himself would be coming of being tangible the substance in you substance in you made flesh in you moving in you Romans 8 11. and he shall also Quicken your mortal body by that spirit that dwelleth In You by that revelation amen all right the church will come through these it'll come through the Pentecostals and go right on into the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self-person God persons God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at Jesus said at that day that's this day at that day when the Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father father me I and you and you and me when the Revelation is made manifest at that day you shall know that I and the father are one I'm in the Father the father and me then when the revelations comes forth then it's I in you and you in me one God not two not three one same person all right now now remember God fulfilled it Sarah he he brought Sarah he he sang of how Mary what'd she do she conceived is that right God kept his promise to Sarah and she conceived the Lord brought the conception her faith raised to the level where she could conceive amen and she conceived a marriage a union all right and now brother Brown said paragraph 578 Christ the mystery God revealed now not will now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in Christ the true headship sounds like a union going in what it you saw he saw the bride marching he saw her get out of Step what was she watching this carnal church out here going into chaos get your nose out of that doesn't even pertain to you amen because what happens when you look at that begin to look at that and all these other things happening you're getting out of Step not with each other you are getting out of step with the word amen what's he crying back get in line get in Step get in step with what the word you take your eyes off of the message of the hour you lose you're getting out of Step amen get back in line with the word get back and step with the word if that was critical in that hour what's he seeing he's seeing us today he said those ones at the last we're getting out of Step not the ones at the first the ones at the the last the LA they saw the end time bride and it was those at the last of that were getting out of Step because they were looking at the turtle this church going into chaos now look at this is happening look at that happening look at this happening look look at this one's left this one hasn't this one I'll go on the internet find what why don't get out of line with the word stay in step with the word keep your focus I'm speaking to me as well as you I speak to every one of us I'm not talking about you losing losing your that he was looking at the bride brother sister looking at the bride get in line stay in step with the word and he saw them getting back in step praise the Lord God bless you now we see the Promise being fulfilled being fulfilled not over with yet until we meet in the air Christ the true headship going in coming in there's your revelation brother Branham said this going is a secret going it's not a public show it's not even known to the public only the bride knows her bridegroom and she enters into marriage with him and when that last one enters into that marriage the door's shut amen amen all right then now we see the brahmas being now we see it we see it we're seeing the promise of the word being fulfilled Christ the true headship coming going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word is making ready and fulfilling his word as he did it the first in John 14 12 he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also then the head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life Vindicated by God himself through his promised word for the last days he promised this in the last days now if you're spiritual you'll catch it who is he the spiritual the real believer Veil behind your skin God bless you let's stand amen sorry to go a little overtime if there is such a thing I think God would consider what's over time and what isn't
