[Music] father and then you brought that word Lord when you have done my will thereafter you shall receive the promise Lord that's our desire this morning do not get in the way Lord to not preach as a man preach as a vessel that you will use this morning open our hearts to the truth of the spirit world that would like to control Our Lives I pray this morning you would break it followed the prince of the power of the air would have no hope on your people Jesus your word said where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty well then you have anointed us to preach the gospel or in spirit and in truth that is the truth that sets your people free God I pray this morning you would bring freedom in our lives Lord Jesus that or only you and you alone would have a say in US Lord Jesus we would not be pushed around by every wind of Doctrine but God May would stand firmly our feet planted on the Rock which is the revelation who you are in hospital thank you Father God bless your people this morning bless this assembly Lord we're giving all things into your hands now in Jesus name we pray amen thank you musicians Isaac thank you amen thank you for your prayers for us Vietnam had a good time God really blessed us last weekend amen if you have your Bibles turn to Hebrews chapter 6. this morning it is never my job as a minister to convince you of anything and does my job as a minister to preach to you to the to you the word let God bring the revelation and let God do the work in your life amen Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh offed upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which beareth thorns and Briars is rejected and is nigh into cursing whose in is to be burned first John chapter 5. first John 5 verse 1. whosoever believeth that Jesus says the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begot loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments it is not to say I love God but that love is a Divine love is a love only put there because Christ is inside amen for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God that keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not excuse me for whatever is born of God overcometh the world is that what that's what I want I want to know how to overcome the world that's where I'm living and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith Faith hold on to that hold on to that word faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God so all I have to do is believe not necessarily in a sense but to believe unto unto what have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed the Bible says who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth for there are three now watch carefully there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one I hear verse 8 and there are three that bear witness in Earth the spirit the water the blood and these three agree in one if we receive the witness of men the witness of God is greater for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his son he they believeth on the Son of God hath to witness in himself he that believeth not God hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that God gave of his son and this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son Christ is our life Christ is our eternal life he that hath son hath life amen and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life that's it may the Lord bless the reading of his word he can be seated this morning foreign I was I was struggling with this thought this morning just very much in prayer last night and you know you got to pray through you got to wrestle with God and and uh it is never my my job as a minister to preach my opinion and there's certain topics whereas ministers and I know our pastor and Brother David will agree or if we're not careful our opinion our opinion does come out we can get you know because we're men but I I but when you touch those topics you pray God I want your word this morning I am going to just read the word I am going to to preach the word now it's going to be your job and God's job to give you Revelation and they're you to take that word it's not my idea it's not my opinion but it's God's word so my title this morning you want to bring that up is the spirit within the birth Spirit within the birth now I have quite a few quotes and and uh this morning I don't I don't want to take too much time if uh the Lord permits we finish these quotes then that's his will if we don't get through it and you are full then that is his will Israel and the church so I want to talk about justification lay a foundation here to talk about being born again and what about the new birth so justification we know is water the the baptized being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's the first step that is the water and brother says in Israel in the church he says now I want to quieten you you down just a minute and Judas was with them is that right Judas was just as big a duck was in the puddle he was I don't know what that means he was shouting and rejoicing too and that part I understand and he followed the church right on down till it come to Pentecost and when it come to Pentecost to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he refused it and betrayed Jesus and that was the Antichrist and that Spirit today will come right down and teach justification by faith and everything and everything so what's between justification and the Holy Spirit is sanctification and move right on down up to the baptismal holy spirit so Justified Sanctified there's a script story in the Bible where brother where Jesus talks he says them the man cleaned the house but the good man of the home wasn't in the house and the devil came back and it was worse it's not enough to be sanctified uh and and move right on down to the baptism of the Holy Ghost then show its colors that's exactly so Judas was justified and Sanctified questions and answers 1964. brother Branham if possible this is a question if possible for a person to be lost and end up in hell if he rejects the light of the word even though he has a genuine experience of justification and sanctification he says yes sir that is exactly right the only ones at the end time which we'll reference a lot in this sermon one of his disciples the treasurer of the church Jesus called him his friend see the Bible said he was born the son of perdition just the same as Jesus was born the son of God he said deceive the very elect if it were possible the Lord knows my heart and thy burden this morning if we're not careful we get confused and God has given a scripture after scripture let us not be put to confusion to be confused in the scripture is to be partakers of idolatry idolatry is confusion to accept the false Doctrine is to accept confusion but God always brings Clarity in our lives and there's a point in our lives where God says now it's time for clarity in for you overcoming is first identifying identifying the devil at his tricks I pray this morning God would bring Clarity the next step in in in this process is what we call sanctification which is the blood Ephesians 5 verse 25 if you want to turn there with me Ephesians 5 25. this is no new gospel this morning this is the word of God Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25. husbands you know we always want to read the first verses but I want to just take a small bunny trail here husbands love your wives even as Christ also love the church and gave himself for it oh well she won't line up she won't submit how are you treating her are you loving her look what God God while we were sinners while our lives were in effect chewing him out he died for us we as husbands must love our wives as Christ loved the church you want to know what's how to be a good husband look at the example and the relationship Christ has with his bride that's right we are called to adore her to to to lift her up to be her she's our girlfriend to have that relationship with her where we say what what do you want I want to give it to you because that's what God says ask and you shall receive 20 verse 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word so Christ had to love the church and give himself for it to sanctify it we are part of the church this morning to sanctify it washing of the Water by the word the word of God which is also the blood of God that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself Hebrews 13 verse 2 wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gift so we are Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ which came according to his word the Bible is a book of Prophecy from the beginning of the world to the end of the world everything that's going to happen is written in the book the word of God said I must come down and give my life and my blood will sanctify him in 1965 in birth pains it says now in first John 5 7 which which we read in the opening it says I believe it is if I'm not mistaken it said there are three that bear record in heaven the father of the word and the Holy Ghost these three are one these are three that bear record in Earth that's water blood and spirit they agree in one now notice the first three are one the second three are Earthly which agree in one cannot have the father without the son you cannot have the sun without having the Holy Ghost but you can have the water without the blood and the blood without the spirit I think through our ages I think through our ages has proved this to be true water blood spirit justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit that types and and an anti-type which takes away from the natural birth natural always types of spiritual amen look when a woman or anything in travail for birth the first thing comes to pass the breaking of the water a normal birth second thing is the blood and then comes life water blood spirit that constitutes the normal natural birth and so it is it in the spiritual realm it's water justification by faith believing on God receiving him as your personal Savior and being baptized second is sanctification of the spirit that God cleanses the spirit from all elements of the world and the desire of the world and then the Holy Spirit comes in and gives the new birth and fills up the set Sanctified vessel all three you can have the water and not have it you could have the blood and not have it you could have the baptism of the Holy Spirit and not have it sir I'll jump to that quote since y'all gave me a weird look don't worry guys we'll if you want to jump this very last quote uh sorry it's not the last quote leadership 1965. the choice of your conduct you could you can't mix it now you're either for God or against God and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside see the cocklebur many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell amen now I gotta go back and find my spot so all three for instance like this he says now we're back in uh the quote birth pains 1965. I think it's the first birth pains quote oh you got it right there okay for instance like this now that I told you um what you don't believe lay aside didn't take the pie so spit out the seed isn't what he's saying okay he says now a glass is so a cup is laying out in the chicken yard you don't just pick that up and put on your table and fill it with water or milk no by picking up is justification cleansing it is sanctification but that cup that cup is not ready to be is not being used he says cause the Greek word sanctify is a compound word which means cleanse and set aside for service not in service for service then when you fill it it is put in service now in Revelations 21 verse 27 there's a scripture that says there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defile lets us begin the Kingdom of Heaven neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life we know for the foundation of the world we were Sons and Daughters of God God put us there God ordained us predestinated us by foreknowledge in other words he knew you would accept him he knew you would accept Christ okay statue of the perfect man 1962. he says all right first you must be born again then when you're born again now watch he says then you're born again you have faith when Moses went to the burning bush and God began to speak to him brother says God anointed his faith you are born with a with a seed you're in the natural in the natural you have the seed of God in you you don't have faith it's there but you don't have it that's it until God comes and he anoints that Faith now what is faith faith is the foundation right it's the bottom layer of the Statue of a perfect man it's the first thing Faith brings Revelation amen and faith comes when we listen to the word of God so feeding the word is gives us faith but you've got to be in a place to receive the word you're not going to put the word in a dirty cup no we take communion we're very careful with the cup and we keep it covering we pray and we bless it and we right God does not just doesn't want to he doesn't want us taking communion with the dirty cup neither does he want communion with us with a dirty cup but you're already a seed you're already seen that's that's going to have to give Revelation but that's how it should always be we just preach the word you're going to have to catch God's God wants to fill you up but you have to be in that position for him to do so and when he anoints that Faith you begin to see God for who he is so he says you're born again and you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you'll argue against it if you're just religiously inclined and you got a little human knowledge that you should do right you'll never be able to agree upon the word of God you'll never do it you've got to be born again and born again it produces faith Born Again produces faith then after you get Faith right there f-a-i-t-h then you're in a position of growing that's right now you're in the position of growing The born-again Experience produces faith in your life now you're in the position of growing another Foundation lay now let's go to circumcision Romans 2 verse 29 but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and now this is just the one scripture I picked there's a lot of scriptures on circumcision Paul really had to break it down because the Jews and the Gentiles clashed over the circumcision of the flesh so he really had to to come I'm glad it anoint him to speak because he was a die-hard Jew but the the word of God anointed Paul to speak to set the balance for this so it couldn't be Paul's opinion had to be God's word and they still fought with it after that because it's God's word spoken but you have to receive that word and God has to give you revelation of that word it is only my job as a minister to preach the word I should not appear trying to convince you of something if I try to convince you of something that's pointless chances are you're probably going to get mad at me or you'll become a man worshiper and I don't want that Romans 2 29 but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God amen amen the spirit so circumcision we all believe circumcision is of the heart so you see you see where we're pulling these points from the scripture in the message and we're setting them out if I had a board I would write it out we're setting them out we have justification sanctification but that's not you can't stop there you can have those two and still go to hell you need you need you need and then a born-again experience produces faith and over here we have circumcision is of the heart now let's look at what circumcision is all about I will restore 1954. now what is circumcision today he says is the holy spirit God circumcises our heart by the Holy Spirit where it was done by the flesh with hands and days gone by but it's done by the Holy Spirit now when we believe correctly on the Lord Jesus Christ God gives the Holy Ghost to us to confirm it so we read first John 5 he says he that believeth on the son of God basically he says has eternal life but it's that it's that that scripture is talking about this right here when we believe correctly on the Lord Jesus Christ let me ask you a question you can nod your head you can raise your hand can you believe without faith you cannot you cannot the devil loves to loves to take the simple things of the word throw it in one cup and then Zoom way out right and anoint people to talk about that cup and people go wow yeah and they NE and then we just go along and we never Zoom back in and see God what are all the pieces that you have here it's so easy to get caught up in in a moment so easy to get caught up in something and you miss well what about this because it's all simple pieces to the puzzle we are complicated not God that's right God is simple we are complicated so God when we believe correctly oh I like how he says correctly it's not just believing what do you believe oh I believe Buddha I believe Muhammad okay believe correctly all of the strength of God that I'm we're speaking this morning all of this comes down to the fact that it's not based on the experience that we have it's not based on how we felt in the moment it's based on is our life bearing fruits of the gospel and if you want to know look at your life yesterday and then go to the word and say is that a reflection of this no excuse the mistakes apologize to God but is your life growing in reflecting Christ do you have a burning desire as a woman to dress modestly but we we have complicated this this topic the new birth we as humans have complicated it because they say oh it's this and one person says no it's this over here but God brought the word to bring us from this side and this side into balance you know I was reflecting on balance I I administered on balance last weekend and I was reflecting on balance on the Fly I think I was on a flight home and I was thinking about Jesus he's not he's spread out on the cross you know why why across and there's a lot of things but why his hands spread out while he's grabbing from this side of the road and he's grabbing from this side of the road and he's pulling it to the heart his desire even in his death he was trying to bring balance in our lives god Set the World in order in balance and it's our jobs as ministers when God's anoints us to speak something to bring that balance that we speak only the God only God's word not our opinion not our opinion so this is the word this is just the word this morning and and so okay and God gives the Holy Ghost to us to confirm it that our faith not ready for this when you're born again that produces faith okay and he says here go the holy goes to us to confirm it that our faith has been reckoned before him and imputed to us for righteousness without the Holy Spirit you never recognize it yet amen amen Jehovah Jireh 1962 and if he has never circumcised you yet by the Holy Ghost he hasn't received your faith yet when you're born again that produces faith the Holy Spirit recognizes your faith and seals you seals your heart with circumcision God gives the Holy Ghost as a confirmation he has received your faith your faith that was given to you before the world ever formed but God has to recognize that is this vessel ready is this vessel ready now if you stop believing because until you receive the Holy Spirit you're not sealed but as a child of God you will be sealed he says if you now if you stop believing and scrambling around and just believe God God will circumcise that heart and that cuts off all unbelief circumcises the world and all unbelief away from you and then you stand the word alone Jesus said if you abide in me in my word in you then ask what you will and it'll be given to you brother Brandon would have people come to prayer and he said will you accept Jesus Christ as your savior if you do so God will heal you hmm now and there's another spot where you know he says here if you stop believing you can so he's talking about stop believing and scrumbling around just believe God but if you get to the the the that the baptized in Jesus name sanctified and then you just what happens tells a story about a man who was blind he was a shoe cobbler and he was blind for 10 years and um he wouldn't he got prayed for but then prayed for him and God opened his eyes and he went back to his church and began to testify what God did and the Pastor said well no that you know you can't believe all that crazy nonsense basically in so many words and within just a few months the man was back in his Services just as blind as he was in the first place anybody makes the comment he says you will have your healing as long as you continue to believe now if we can apply apply that to Healing we can apply that to that promise that if we will Keep On Believing God will answer that but if we stop believing we lose that position until you're sealed and once you're sealed God recognizes that Faith you know what that means that faith will always be there now it always was it'll always be that you don't have to worry oh I'm gonna be deceived no you don't you will not be deceived God will bring you to Greater truth as you grow because you're in the position to grow Abraham was the first one we read in the Bible who was circumcised Genesis 17 verse 11 says and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you so it's a token now there's a there's a quote and I don't know if I have it or not or brother Branham talks about Abraham and the circumcision and he says it took the name change amen what was Abram's name changed Abraham it was testifying he was sanctified you are not you have been cleansed you have been sanctified people see the difference you're known by something else now but it takes circumcision to confirm that experience to confirm that faith in your heart in a why I am against organized religion it's very interesting to me how when you when you take a topic like this the sermons you quote from yeah or what I call the the fundamentals you know why am I just organized religion uh birth pains yeah um statue of a perfect man anointed ones at the end time he says to be born of the spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit is to understand and believe with your heart that Jesus is Christ and this is his word that no other words can be added to it or taken away from it now he says there if you kept reading he says without your name taken out of the Book of Life later on he confirms that as a seed of God your name is put there you'll never be taken off because you'll never deny the word so a little further down he says if you add one thing to it in your tradition or take one thing from it Christ said himself your name shall ruled off the book now Born Again means a new birth from above birth from above then we are active in the things from above for it is himself acting in his word through you believing and acting upon the word for your hour those are my words sorry I ended the quote believing and acting upon the word for your hour we never say oh I was at the altar and I cried and now I have the Holy Ghost you can have the baptism of the Holy Spirit every day of your life and go to hell amen amen so we have to look at our lives we have to be mature Christians and we have to stop falling around about our feelings and we have to say what does the word say about me and if you can accept the word and keep accepting the word and then your life reflects that you are acting upon it there's your evidence brother Branham gave us the evidence God gave us the evidence through the ministry of the Prophet why are we still talking about it the wrong way why are we still pushing people not you necessarily not our pastor ministers here but why why as a whole the church The Message Church there is we and I had this disconnect I had this as a young person and for me that's a big burden because you go to camps they're not preaching against camps and there's a big workup and I had experience after experience in those workups and nothing changed but if you're not careful you go away thinking that what it's that's what it's all about and then people don't want to touch the quote where he says you can have the baptism of the Holy Spirit every day of your life and go to hell it's not for us to say I feel it today I don't feel it tomorrow it's for us to say is our life reflecting the word do I have that ability within me to accept the word do you have that desire for the word that hunger for the word that desire to be right to always be right to make things right well those are fruits of the spirit those are fruits of Christ so my prayer today to in the back to the Lord was that if there is an hindrance in your life where you you God is looking down saying you have the Holy Spirit but you're wrestling with it I pray this morning God will bring Clarity you would know your position amen that's right if you don't I pray God will bring the clarity so you know your position either way my desire every time I ministers God your word only and show the people their position amen if you okay now Titus 3 verse 5 says not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us see it takes it takes Revelation saying to God it's that simple you tell people and you know when you're when you're in you're witnessing to people it's hard sometimes the certain things that we believe for them to accept and really it's for me when I say it it's just the devil coming in my mind but it sounds weak to say well you just have to have Revelation but the fact of the matter is it's that simple it's that simple when we witness to people this is now this is my for me speaking from my experience I over complicated because I tried to avoid the truth now you're not going to come to somebody and say do you know the serpent seed you and God to lead the conversation but just say the truth amen just speak because when you speak the truth if there's something in there to awaken that truth will awaken that that truth will awaken that and so when we read the scripture sometimes you say oh well Titus here he just says hey uh not by works but Paul says show me your faith by your works so will the Bible contradicts itself it takes Revelation to see what God is trying to say what is he saying between the lines and his love letter to us we can't just pull this scripture and run with it no we've got to have continuity through the scriptures appreciate it our brother Paul when he was praying in the back for the service this morning he said May the preaching come in continuity and that was it's exactly my heart's desire this morning but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration regeneration is the new birth and renewing of the Holy Ghost in 1961 an uncertain sound he says no matter where they put you if you're born again and filled with the Holy Ghost it might not be even enough Ashes to hold your little fingernail but she'll come forth again at the resurrection because you got life amen if you're born again and filled with the Holy Spirit the oil in the lamp the oil is the Holy Ghost where does that leave the foolish virgin I'm not going to go into that topic but but chew on that where does that lead the foolish version they don't have oil talks about this and and I'm going to bring it in and I'm going to tell you this morning that that my desire is just to preach it's just to bring the word and I know I keep saying that and you forgive me for my insecurities um but brother random talks about this this concept of stillborn and in birth pains 1965 he says that's what's the matter with the church today now how many know God's bringing a bride out of the church so the church is in birth pains not the denominations the message searches and birth pains why do you think there's so much so much uh um uh what I don't know what the word is so there's there's a lot you know what traveling and stuff there's a lot of bickering going on in the message as a whole there's a lot of this and a lot of that and it's just getting worse because it's birth pains the church the message search is in birth pain so don't get caught up in the birth pains but my wife you know has having a baby um first of all I Thank God I'm a man whenever that happens is he going through birth pains I don't go birth pains pains oh no pains pains pains no I'm looking pains means life is coming I'm looking I'm not I'm not focused on the pain she's having I'm saying honey you got this you got this you know I could always tell when she was just about ready and uh so tell you know she'd be like no no no no I'm like no it's almost there I'm not focused on birthday I'm not talking to the doctor you know she's in a lot of pain she's in the doctors and be like duh she's having a baby as children of god let's not get focused on the pains and the differences and and this person this church is Pentecostal so we go there and this church is is legalistic so we don't go there or this Church's legalization so we go there and this shirt Pentecostal so we go there we want the middle of the road we want the balance and you're gonna ask we're gonna find Christ and that's why you're not going to find confusion and I have to pray God help me not get caught up in that especially as a minister because God this is just the way God anointed the fivefold ministry I'm here you're there that's just because God planted that way but I'm still a man and if I get caught up in in preaching against Pentecostalism I am just as bad and if I get caught up in preaching against legalism I'm as just as bad I want to come the middle of the road and I want to preach the balance in the scriptures preach the word of God and I know that our I know that we all agree on that this morning that is where we'll find continuity so it's birthplace now get caught up in the birth pains look for the life look for the life that's coming because the bride will be what a reflection of Christ so when the church is done birthing what will that be the bride a perfect reflection of God Amen then we'll get out of here praise God and we won't have to argue anymore birth pains 1965. that's what's the matter with the church today the system we've got too many stillborn children that's right they need a gospel spanking you see and so to wake them up to bring them to themselves so that God can breathe the breath of life into them now we find that that's so true it's crude theology but it's the truth anyhow still born so there was water there was blood there's a baby born but it has no life natural always types the spiritual God's provided a way of approach to Fellowship 1960. I told you I have a lot of quotes I even gave brother Alex a heads up I said hey I got a ton of quotes and they're not going to come till right at 10. busting for putting all this together and everyone else back there in the sound team what come from Jesus's body when he died now what when Jesus died what was that the world was in birth pains he was causing A disruption and the enemy was trying to quiet that disruption people take that they run with that and they say anything I say in in defense against you and enough sense against you I'm causing disruption I'm in the will of God we are not Jesus he was perfectly in the will of God now if you're perfectly in the will of God you're causing disruption you're not going to be arrogant about you're going to be humble so when Jesus died he was moving he was transitioning to us receiving the Holy Spirit a comforter shall come so this was a birth the church was in a birth and they they thrust him in the side and he says he says um when he died what come from Jesus's body when he died blood and water so he says now then does the natural what does the natural birth consist of excuse me sisters and you young ladies I beg you'll forgive me but I want to make a statement when a baby is born a natural birth that's the first thing water second thing blood third thing spirit what come out of the body of Jesus water blood spirit because he Pat he passed away he died when a baby is born and it never cries it never moves there's something wrong with it it's what's called a stillbirth it's dead when it's born what happens the dogs are picked up by the heels shakes him and gives them a little few little spankings and the screen comes out life comes in what's the matter with the Pentecostal church tonight it needs what's the matter with the message church today it needs another gospel spanking that the Holy Ghost now that is not me coming up here and beating you across the head with the gospel stick no no it's the power there's power behind us there's power behind a spanking it gets a message across the Holy Spirit has power to bring life that's what he's saying when he says the church needs a good old-fashioned gospel spanking he's saying the church needs the power of the Holy Spirit to bring life amen what's the matter with the Pentecostal church today it needs another gospel spanking that the Holy Ghost shaking by the heels of the Gospel that life will enter into it again and it'll scream out to the Praises of God oh he is so wonderful a birth the spirit of God water blood spirit these three agree in one what is that one that's what is that one that is the new birth these three agree in one that's why you can have the baptisms of the Holy Spirit every day of your life and go to hell you can be baptized every day of your life and go to hell you can be Sanctified every day of your life and go to hell you need all three together in one for God to come recognize the faith that was produced in you when you were born again and seal you with the Holy Spirit see you don't that's that's right there you don't have to come up here and rip the carpet up an emotion that's right you have to do God what you do is you pray you say God I want the Holy Ghost you have faith right because if you're praying and asking for it you have faith that Born Again experience produced that faith in you now you have faith to call out for the holy spirit for the baptism of the holy spirit that will seal your life the faith you begin to cry out in that Faith guess what by time you come up to the altar you might already have it it's not one event right not everybody knows this day I got the Holy Ghost everybody just knows I'm not the same one I used to be everybody knows I'm not the same one I used to be not everybody knows exactly when it happened you see people come up on the and and see this is why I have to be careful because it sounds like I'm preaching against Pentecostalism I'm not I'm not now the experience but the brown said then a Revival dies does not come back Pentecost was for Pentecost today we want the bride it's Revival we want the word of God in our life but what does that mean go to the word and find out praise the Lord so now I want to take a minute to look at adoption in a hit in life 1955 brother Brown says this he says and remember the child no matter what whatever take place it was born a child it will always be a child I love how he just takes the simple example says if you're human you're going to act like a human if you're a normal human and you're born You're Gonna Act Like a human if your child of God and you're born again you're going to act like a child of God he says um okay born it'll always be a child and when a man is born of the Holy Ghost he becomes a child of God for it is actually a second birth a regeneration that creates something in the man that wasn't there to begin with see when you get a baptism of the Holy Spirit on your flesh nothing inside changed but when you get when you when you follow through and you are born again and the Holy Spirit testifies of that faith and you are sealed now something changes because the Lord sealed that faith so can't get away he knows our Humanity he knows our Humanity so he died on the cross to give us the opportunity to seal that faith in our hearts so nothing can take it away you can get to that position without the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit has to come to seal that in your heart he says as a child and when a man is born of the Holy Ghost he becomes a child of God for it is actually a second birth okay that creates something in the man that wasn't there to begin with when every man is Born Into the household of faith he becomes a child then the Holy Spirit follows this man and brings word to God how he is progressing by God's grace I I don't have everything figured out but I'm preaching you today something I've wrestled with for years I'm just trusting the Lord that it would just be his word and the same message again he says now I believe that this is the time that the church has arrived at today that the great move in the church is for God after we've seen the false alarms but now God will place in his church correctly correctly Apostles prophets teachers evangelists not man-made Seminary bottom but God will place into the church so the previous quote he says then the Holy Spirit follows this man and brings word to God how he is progressing the teacher brings word to the father how his son is doing and then there's a moment in time where the father says he's ready for adoption when you were first born again guess what you were not ready for a position why is it that that Forgive Me Lord you're not you're not born an adult spiritually speaking you don't you're not born and boom you're an adult there's a growing time and and I've said this and by God's grace I I see this now in the word but I've said this that I believe every experience every believer has a desert experience that's a time in your life you'll walk through or you're growing to your position and you know this is what God has called me to do that's your position and it's it's easy to use the example of ministers because it's a it's an example but even ministers can start and they're still not in their position are you an evangelist are you an apostle are you a teacher are you a pastor what is your position and you got we're preaching this and we're this way and we're that we have to grow even as we're already in our ministry do we put to our position that God has called us to and in that process it is painful you as a child of God growing through your position in Christ because we all have a position is birth pains and God and the Holy Spirit is teaching you bringing that place where then God can say now they're in their position now that position individually speaking does not mean now it's time for the Rapture now you're in the vision God can begin to use your vessel Use Your Vessel when the bride collectively we all recognize at the same time wow you can't explain anyway so wow then we're out of here so he says uh but God will place into the church not theology run overs and overnights but God will place in the church as God has chosen as the Holy Ghost has tutored his church and raised it up and in there God will adopt into it adopt into his into the position his sons they're already his sons but whether they are worthy ready to catch this this boo me out of the water whether they are worthy of the position that he has for them you were not born an adult you have to grow you're in the position to grow that's why we was never become stagnant as Christians we must be watching cautious careful already becoming stagnant we we are called to a higher order we are not called to Camp down on one thing we are called to a higher order because we are going to make it we are going to make it Donna we're gonna make it one day you mean you're gonna be the same age brother Roman wait for the translation we're gonna make it or the Trevor we're gonna make it let's preach that way let's live that way when we see our brothers mistakes we say that's what we're gonna make it we need the difference in our lives so we can witness the difference to those around us God is looking for light to shine how can the light shine if there's confusion in our lives now I know we're at the hour mark but y'all I feel like y'all are still there so we'll keep going now in in 1951 I thought in the last days there's going to be two classes of people then that has the seal and the others will have the mark of the beast that's right so the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Spirit Ephesians 4 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption so that life breathes into the vessel you read that scripture and then you read that quote about being baptized with the Holy Spirit every day of your life and going to hell and you think but if I was contradicted with the scripture but when God says grieve out the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed so you've been sealed now that's not on the flesh that's something that's happened inside of you that God has sealed that Faith he has given you with the holy spirit it's a totally different position in Matthew 5 45 I want to touch on this anointed ones I'm drawing by God's Great the Lord is I'm trying to get out of the way it's the Lord by the Lord can bring out this and because well I'm just going to read it Matthew 5 45 that they may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and on the unjust I was sitting in church one day and it just hit me the weed and I know this you're like whoa but the Chris you you you need to you know really learn more but you just have those epiphanies where you know it but then it just it just looks at it looks a little bit different and I was sitting there and I realized the weed and the wheat are growing from the same ground they're right next to each other they're growing from the same ground they're reacting the same way so how do we know how do we know well the wheat births the life of the wheat the weed birtheds the life of the weed amen that's right amen at the end time now they would not stand for that but false Christ false anointed ones almost with every sign and every letter of the word they believe baptism of the Holy Ghost absolutely believe in all this yep believe in speaking in tongues yep believe signs and wonders follow sides and wonders will follow them or signs will follow them yep that's not Methodist that's not Baptist no no that's message Believers see this is the last day again the same sermon Jesus said that rain falls on the just and the unjust now someone might say to me do you believe that the anointing of those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine Holy Spirit o God upon a person and yet they are false why what is false they're teaching they're teaching but it can be so close to the seed of elect if it was possible it's not these churches where they get up and they say brother branham's God we have matured beyond that point that is not close enough to deceive the very elect it's when a preacher gets up and he preaches a twisted sermon with his opinions mixed in you have to know the word and you have to find your position in the word and then when the minister gets up and he preaches under the anointing of the spirit and you hear it and maybe you're just like you open your heart and say God if that's you show me and you go back to the word of God I Marvel and I know it's the signs of the times and I know there's lots of excuses but we need to stop using the excuse that it's the flesh yeah right we have no excuse why do we have children and I'm partly guilty of this as my kids you know get older you you sometimes you you lag behind because you you look at them as they're still toddlers my my own daughter is old enough to start reading the Bible herself why is it that children are in their high school college and they don't even read their Bible they go to church Sunday Wednesday they go to all the youth meetings they go to the functions and they don't read their Bible that is the world that we live in today it is time for us to stand up and say we got to make a change I was on the plane coming back from Alaska and God just struck me and this is the burden God gave me now the burden God gives you is different burning God gave me we're running out of time and we're not doing enough why aren't we doing enough because we're not in our position so God's spending his time and we're spinning our wheels and God doesn't lose time so careful here careful here God don't waste time but God uses words like this stop messing around to provoke us into our position so stop messing around get in and get good so God can use you so Glock in his eye I say that in all love we all have we go through things and God walks us along in the footsteps of the righteous or order of the Lord keep on keeping on thanks to God he says now you can't make it any other way and understand this is the same I think the rest of these okay the next few quotes are the only two ones at the end time well you have it right there okay now you can't make it any other you can't make it another way and understand Matthew 20 24 he said these shall were false christs Christ is Anointed it's Jesus Christ he's the anointed one false anointed ones Anointed with the genuine thing but be false prophets of it false teachers of it the reasons no now he in this I think it's this sermon he talks about zedekiah in conflict with I think it was Jeremiah the problem was that akaya didn't know the word for his day there was Arya prophecy that they're going to go to Babylon for 70 years there already was a prophecy and zedekiah was trying to contradict that prophecy but he was anointed that right there should just clear it up what word are you hearing what word are you believing is it contradicting prophecy that's why I have a hard time and this is a little bit of brother Chris's opinion when people get so caught up in politics and they want to save America prophecy has been given now we got to do our best to shine a light to get as many here out us out of here with us as we can we're not going to save America that's right don't get caught up in the politics of today do not amen now the only ones at the end time Balaam Anointed with the same Spirit can you talk about this without bringing this guy up Balaam Anointed with the same spirit that was upon Moses what was the difference you see that's why you have to be careful he says it's the anointing it's the anointing it's the only thing it's not it's not it's the word is and now God will anoint you sometimes to shout and run the aisles God will anoint you sometimes to sit and listen what is God leading you but it's the anointing on the true seed that's what makes the difference it's not just anointing it's not just the water just the blood just the holy spirit it's all of that on the seed that God has placed in your life that is the difference I want to know the difference and I want to preach the difference because there's too much of the other stuff amen I want to witness the difference with my own life say wow wow amen I just think about God's grace in my own life some of you would have known me God's grace Balaam Anointed with the same spirit that was upon Moses what was the difference the teaching of Moses was perfect we have no excuse we are called unto Perfection stop saying well the flesh is weak but the spirit is willing stop even giving word to flesh don't even don't it just whatever get rid of that see it's not that easy I know I live with the flesh every day too but the word of God you see I had I had and now now once again once again this is stuff I already know already knew but I had this Epiphany I was back from a trip and I was tired and I had been been studying for like a month every day just really heavy topic I just need a I need to chill you know something just chill and the Lord spoke to me said chilling is not going to strengthen you you need a tape I thought oh you're right put on a tape and I was in I was strengthened amen and strengthened the world the world wants us especially for men you know we love to just have a nothing box as they call it the world has plenty of nothing boxes for us to sit in we got games we got YouTube we've got you know hunting blogs and fishing blogs and fishing magazines and all of that stuff we can get ourselves lost in and we can dream and but that doesn't strengthen us that doesn't strengthen us going fishing can strengthen you you're spending time with God sisters but that's what the devil wants to pull you away from God because you know what if you chill that's the world would say Netflix and chill I don't have a Netflix subscription the rule would say that but that doesn't when you do that you just feel like you need to chill more because you're a child of God and all that stuff just brings you down amen amen enough said there the teaching of Moses was perfect the Bible said here in second Peter that it was the teaching of Balaam that Israel received that God never did forgive it wasn't that what happened it was the teachings they received that God never forgave unpardonable sin not a one of them got saved though they had come out under the blessings of God Red Sea justification the desert experience sanctification but they received the wrong teaching they were Seated on teaching they were still born Israelites the hand of God moving by this Mighty prophet and seen it exactly Vindicated by God I just want to touch on this real quick here regeneration and we'll get to to the ending the scripture there's a scripture in Titus did we read it already we did where he says regeneration in preparation 1953 says but brother it's got to take the Holy Spirit a new birth a regeneration a new creature in Christ Jesus when God comes down and puts his Spirit into you then you're no more your own but you're gods or begin to feel religious already and you know what a birth is God's provided way it's a regeneration a new creation a man becomes a new creation in Christ and by accepting his own word and Titus 3 5 says not by works okay by Mercy but by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost so um uh hear ye him he that believeth not is condemned already before you even get started you're condemned you're born and sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies no matter how much he was dedicated on the altar how many times you were sprinkled baptized poor whatever it is you're still a sinner that's all until you repent and God until you repent it doesn't stop it says and God recognizes and seals that promise with the Holy Spirit the Born Again experience produces faith in your heart God recognizes that faith and you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit sealed unto the day of your Redemption that's right he says then you're born again then your son and daughter's daughter of God it's a regeneration a new creation then your attributes now here's what you have to focus on my wife we were talking about something the other day and she said you have doubts and I said yes and she started to get worried and I said but the word says this amen and that's where I stand amen amen you can have doubts on your flesh and still be a saved Sanctified blood-filled on fire Son of God amen because you stand on the word what is the foundation of a perfect man the word faith faith faith is knowing your position in Christ your daughter of God it's regeneration a new creation then your attributes your thoughts are not like they were your life is not like it was you become a complete surrendered vessel to God see it's the attributes that testify of the work God has done the attributes of God and he speaks and uses you and you're not your own no more but you're bought with a price that's the price of the Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ okay trying to find a place to wrap this up this morning or get get to the get to the Crux he says I don't believe that sir Morgan Church age I believe uh 1960 the sermon he preaches on submarine Church age I believe regeneration comes by the blood of Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit that's right baptism is only an outward Act to the inward work of regeneration he's talking about Oneness people how they believe that when you get baptized that's your regeneration but he says that's not what it how it is so now let's wrap this up by God's grace Israel in the church number two notice three stages three stages three stages justification by faith sanctification through the blood baptism of the Holy Spirit next quote God always does things in threes god is perfect in three he is perfect he is perfect and father son Holy Spirit he is perfect in justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit he is perfected in his threes we are in his making so we are perfected in three yeah yeah soul body spirit and your body is controlled of nerves of blood and of cells flesh three all perfected in three expectations next quote when you are born again and the baptism of the Holy Spirit has come into your heart you have everything that you have need of for the journey amen 1965 leadership the choice of your conduct you can't mix it now you're either for God or against God and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost go to hell say what is it wow what can we do be born again amen the key to the door 1962 so communion is for Christians that's born again of the spirit of God Born Again does not necessarily mean now that you got the Holy Ghost now remember now many you many teach that I don't know anybody that teaches it like this but as old brother organ fight said that night from the pulpit but new Birds is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit the scripture doesn't support it I don't think see the way am I seeing it say whoa brother Chris hold on we read we've read a bunch of quotes a bunch of scriptures where he says the new birth brings the faith produces in you the faith for receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit you can't have the new birth without the baptism of the Holy Spirit but you can have the baptism of the Holy Spirit without the new birth he says an influence of another I don't believe in being born again is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's being reborn again we're reborn by the blood blood cell comes from that now we read quotes everybody now says it's the blood that brings the birth child is born it's water it's blood then Spirit comes in but they're born the spirit needs a body to inhabit your their Spirit body you need to you need a birth for the spirit to inhabit it's being reborn again we're reborn by the blood blood cell comes from I mean life still comes from the blood you're baptized the Holy Ghost into the body but you're born by the blood absolutely you're born by the blood of your father I am Born Again by The Blood of My Father by your Our Father Christ it is the rising of the sun he says if that ain't my message exactly today justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I was saying that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to walk that highway so when we say You must be born again we're not saying come up and get the baptism of the Holy Spirit we're saying go the process water blood spirit you see where the confusion is what happens is you you get an experience the baptism of the Holy Spirit on you and it falls on you and your life doesn't change and you wonder I missed it or you go away thinking God doesn't keep his word but what you want is you want God to recognize the faith inside of you that produce that's produced by the birth then God fills you with the Holy Spirit you can ha you can't have the birth without the Holy Ghost but you can have the Holy Spirit without the birth we just read the quote baptism of the Holy Spirit on your flesh on you every day of your life and still go to hell now in in closing here birth pains he says and it proves beyond the shadow of a doubt what Luther's message was justification what sanctification is the next process is the natural birth birth and then come the Pentecostals exactly now remember I didn't preach any of my opinions I've read the quotes now God has to do the rest I was struggling with with preaching along these lines and and I've already I've already talked to the Paul some time ago and I and I open my bible and I saw this sticky note I put here last weekend it says easy has the cost are you willing to pay the price the Bible says his yoke is easy and his burden is life there's a price we have to pay surprised that we have to pay him God calls us to do something he says do my will and afterwards Brother David read the scripture afterwards receive the promise I pray this morning there would not be any any kind of confusion that we would know that it's it's it's the new birth and that God has given us a plan to get to that position and it's not what experience we had it's what does our life reflect and I believe if our life reflects the word we are sealed the day of our Redemption now we're in the position to grow to come to that position where God can adopt us and use us for his glory let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your word this morning Lord I pray Lord Jesus as the saying goes a plant we water but the the life comes from you or somewhere along those lines they might have said that wrong but God you give the increase Lord

I'm challenged to go back to your word and say Lord show me for myself can you Revelation for myself Lord Lord I love you so much and we're all on a journey to to get out of here and father we need clarity as Christians we need clarity as Believers to know where's the middle of the road where's the line so that we can walk it sometimes it doesn't matter where we are in our life how many years
