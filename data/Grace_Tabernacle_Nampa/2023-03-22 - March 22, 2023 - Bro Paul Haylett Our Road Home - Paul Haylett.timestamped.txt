[32:51] isn't that beautiful
[32:53] amen how
[32:55] these lovely songs can express
[32:58] the very thoughts very desires deep in
[33:02] her heart
[33:03] we get to sing it out and
[33:07] you know it's just all through the Bible
[33:10] we see how the Saints
[33:12] lifted their voices in praise to God it
[33:15] was an expression that God gave us an
[33:18] ability that he placed in us to just
[33:21] Express that out and you know the old
[33:23] phrase that says Sing from your heart
[33:25] and truly I I believe that that the Lord
[33:28] hears our heart when we sing amen
[33:32] um just forgot to put this on a prayer
[33:34] request but sister Jerry's not been
[33:36] feeling real well and I know that there
[33:38] are others here in the assembly so let's
[33:40] make sure we lift one another up in
[33:42] prayer for the physical needs for
[33:45] healing and and strength and uh so we
[33:49] appreciate those prayers amen I know
[33:51] that I appreciate the prayer of the
[33:54] Saints and uh I believe that each and
[33:58] every one of us do amen thank you
[34:00] musicians it was a lovely song Service
[34:02] uh amen spoke to my heart and uh I want
[34:07] to just uh speak tonight once again on
[34:12] our journey
[34:13] and tonight our road home
[34:16] it is uh of all the roads that we can
[34:20] take there is something special
[34:22] about the road home and I say this just
[34:26] a bit humorous that even our dog teddy
[34:30] knows when he's on our road amen so how
[34:34] much more we as Sons and Daughters of
[34:36] God to recognize that God is so gracious
[34:40] to us that we're on the road home amen
[34:43] let's just stand and turn in our Bibles
[34:48] in Luke the 8th chapter
[34:51] we want to pick this up right here in
[34:53] verse 26 and
[34:56] um we'll we'll see that uh we're picking
[34:59] this up just right after uh Luke's
[35:02] account of um the disciples experience
[35:05] on the sea and uh we'll look and there's
[35:08] so much isn't it amazing when we start
[35:10] in and we can study a thought uh that
[35:14] literally a person could could uh preach
[35:18] on on these thoughts for months if not
[35:21] years because it's it's uh when I say
[35:24] complex I don't mean it
[35:27] in complexity but it's so interwoven
[35:32] it is just so interconnected that you
[35:36] can start in a certain way and if we're
[35:38] not careful we can get branched off into
[35:40] a uh literally dozens or hundreds of
[35:43] other avenues and um and yet we'll find
[35:47] that ultimately they would bring us back
[35:49] right to the very place we're at and
[35:52] that's the beauty of the word of God and
[35:54] so let's just turn in Luke 8 26 to 39
[35:58] and um
[36:00] we will just unfold this story by God's
[36:04] grace tonight
[36:05] and they arrived at the country of the
[36:08] Gatherings which is over against Galilee
[36:11] and when he went forth to land there met
[36:13] him out of the city a certain man which
[36:17] had Devils long time and wear no clothes
[36:21] neither Abode in any house but in the
[36:24] tombs when he saw Jesus he cried out and
[36:27] fell down before him and with a loud
[36:29] voice said what have I to do with thee
[36:32] Jesus thou Son of God most high I
[36:36] beseech thee torment me not
[36:40] for he had commanded the unclean Spirit
[36:43] to come out of the man for often times
[36:46] it had caught him and he was kept bound
[36:49] with chains I love the fact we sang that
[36:52] song tonight amen bound with chains and
[36:55] in Fetters and he break the bands and
[36:58] was driven of the devil Into the
[37:00] Wilderness and Jesus asked him saying
[37:03] what is thy name and he said Legion
[37:05] because many Devils were entered into
[37:08] him and they besought him that he would
[37:11] not command them to go out into the deep
[37:15] and there was a herd of many swine
[37:17] feeding on the mountain and they
[37:19] besought him that he would suffer them
[37:21] to enter into them and he suffered them
[37:24] then went the Devils out of the man and
[37:27] entered into the swine and the herd ran
[37:29] violently down a steep Place into the
[37:32] lake and were choked and when they had
[37:34] fed them and when they that had fed them
[37:37] saw what was done they fled and went and
[37:40] told it in the city and in the country
[37:43] then they went out to see what was done
[37:46] and came to Jesus and found the man out
[37:49] of whom the Devils were departed sitting
[37:51] at the feet of Jesus clothed and in his
[37:54] right mind and they were afraid my they
[38:00] also which saw it told them by what
[38:02] means he that was possessed of the
[38:04] Devils was healed
[38:06] then the whole multitude of the country
[38:08] of the gadarines round about besought
[38:10] him to depart from them for they were
[38:13] taken with great fear and he went up
[38:15] into the ship and returned back again
[38:18] now the man out of whom the Devils were
[38:21] departed besought him that he might be
[38:23] with him but Jesus sent him away saying
[38:26] return to thine own house and show how
[38:30] great things God hath done unto thee and
[38:33] he went his way and published throughout
[38:35] the whole city how great things Jesus
[38:38] had done unto him Heavenly Father we ask
[38:41] for your blessings upon the word tonight
[38:43] let it live in our hearts our souls
[38:46] father we ask in your name amen you may
[38:49] be seated
[38:52] as we look at this story as we've read
[38:54] the Scripture it lays the story out very
[38:57] well before us and as we look at this
[38:59] story we see that there is
[39:02] um a a position and Jesus being on the
[39:06] other Shore the prophet of God says that
[39:10] um there is a horse cry in Jesus amen
[39:14] responded to one man's heart cry you
[39:17] notice that there was not another cry
[39:19] mentioned in the scripture not another
[39:21] need right there at that time but you
[39:24] look at this story in the heart cry of
[39:27] one man who had come and been in a place
[39:29] and it was across the sea and brother
[39:32] Branham lays it out this way and I find
[39:34] it uh very beautiful he says you know it
[39:37] was there that uh that cry he knew that
[39:40] that need was on the other side and of
[39:43] Galilee and so it was there was the
[39:45] whole purpose for him now did things
[39:47] happen along the way did God deal with
[39:50] the hearts of the disciples and give
[39:52] them a greater understanding all of that
[39:55] is tied together but it was the you
[39:58] might say tonight we're going to say a
[39:59] principal reason that they were there
[40:02] and crossed over and Jesus comes and and
[40:05] everything that's done he speaks to the
[40:07] disciples about their lack of faith and
[40:10] encouraging them now my brother and
[40:12] sister sometimes we take hard preaching
[40:14] or direct preaching as almost like it's
[40:17] an assault upon us but we really should
[40:20] count it as a blessing because the word
[40:22] of God says that he corrects those that
[40:26] he loves amen so he brings the word to
[40:29] us and we say well it could be brought a
[40:31] little softer but sometimes it takes
[40:34] something to get our attention sometimes
[40:37] God just uses very direct means to get
[40:40] our attention and so the the word of God
[40:43] you know shows us so clearly how this is
[40:46] now steps upon the shore what was it my
[40:49] brother and sister the word had come
[40:51] across the sea if we look through this
[40:53] scripture we'll find where the word has
[40:55] come over the mountain and we'll also
[40:57] find as it would be that it's come
[40:59] through the jungle and it's come through
[41:01] the depths of the city my brother and
[41:03] sister and of all of those things I
[41:06] would almost say that I'm more afraid of
[41:08] the depths of the city than I am of any
[41:11] of these other places and but it's there
[41:14] all to respond to the heart crime of one
[41:17] and so we see this one as it were that
[41:20] he was there taking some of these things
[41:22] that brother Branham said and and
[41:24] putting them not to imply anything that
[41:27] would not be a foundational of the
[41:29] scripture but the prophet of God talks
[41:32] about this and we'll read a quote in
[41:34] just a moment but he had been taken
[41:36] maybe it started that he'd just gone out
[41:39] of Fellowship maybe it just got started
[41:41] I don't know if you've ever read the
[41:43] little story about the minister coming
[41:45] to to the man who hadn't been to church
[41:47] for a while and they're sitting there in
[41:49] the winter time and the fire is going
[41:51] and the Ministry comes in he greets him
[41:54] and they sit down and he takes the tongs
[41:57] at the fireplace and he just grabs a
[42:00] coal and he sets it off to one side and
[42:03] as they're visiting he never says a word
[42:05] about the fact that the man's not in
[42:07] church but as the conversation went on
[42:09] you could see the glow go out of the
[42:12] cold and slowly it turned dark and
[42:14] solely it started to cool off and after
[42:16] a little bit the man says I get it
[42:20] you see my brother and sister that's one
[42:22] of Satan's way is to get us out of
[42:24] Fellowship get us to the idea that
[42:27] people don't care or it's not necessary
[42:29] but we'll see here how him out of
[42:33] Fellowship maybe he started to separate
[42:35] himself from his family maybe he found
[42:38] new friends and so we'll look at this my
[42:41] brother and sister there is a spirit on
[42:44] a person is what attracts them to the
[42:46] nature of the spirit
[42:49] does that make sense
[42:51] you see it's there that anointings or
[42:54] Spirits calls it to change and we've
[42:56] seen it we've all witnessed the change
[42:59] that comes when people change who they
[43:02] work with
[43:03] you can see it in just a change of
[43:06] employment
[43:07] and I remember years ago it's kind of a
[43:10] landmark moment for Paul but years ago
[43:13] we were we were slowly going broke on
[43:15] the farm and and I I realized I had to
[43:19] have a winter job and so I went and and
[43:23] um you know of course Every Man's right
[43:24] in his own eyes right I'm close to a
[43:26] perfect employee
[43:29] um that's why I've never really been
[43:30] able to work for anyone else I'm such a
[43:31] good employee but it's there that I
[43:34] would apply for jobs and they would be
[43:35] all excited oh Mr haylet will hire you
[43:38] blah blah blah and now tell them look I
[43:39] need to tell you that I am a farmer and
[43:42] when I go back you know farming starts
[43:44] in the spring I'm going to be gone we
[43:45] don't need you I went from job to job
[43:48] suffering that you know kind of almost I
[43:50] called it Prejudice but I understand why
[43:53] they felt that way and you know
[43:55] ultimately I got a job in a wood molding
[43:58] plant in Meridian and uh so you know I
[44:01] go to work there and my it's a different
[44:03] world for me and the very first day I'm
[44:06] there uh the the manager he takes me out
[44:09] and says okay now this lady right here
[44:12] is
[44:14] um is your Foreman your boss and uh
[44:17] you'll be she'll assign you to a job so
[44:20] they put me at a really really technical
[44:23] job of when the boards come through the
[44:25] molding machine I had to take them put
[44:28] two of them face to face and stack them
[44:30] on a cart
[44:32] very high tech work
[44:35] and I realized I I'm going to wither
[44:38] by the time spring comes I will have
[44:40] withered down to nothing
[44:42] I'd be the guy walking around who am I
[44:44] and what am I doing here
[44:47] but it wasn't long in the job that you
[44:49] know a couple people befriended me and
[44:51] one of them come and he he actually was
[44:53] a pretty nice kid but he goes now look
[44:55] this boss of ours is weird and when I
[44:58] mean weird I mean really weird and he
[45:01] says so you be careful around here or
[45:03] her okay and I'm like okay okay uh you
[45:07] know I don't know maybe there's
[45:07] something about this I don't know well
[45:10] you know they had uh they had a unique
[45:12] deal just uh no lunch hour it was just
[45:14] two long breaks uh mid-morning and
[45:17] mid-afternoon and uh so that very first
[45:21] shift that I'm there and I'm in the
[45:23] lunchroom the very first time I realized
[45:25] just how weird this lady was
[45:28] because she sat down at the table in the
[45:32] lunchroom
[45:33] opened her lunch box
[45:36] pulled her Bible out
[45:38] laid it on the counter or the the table
[45:41] and bowed her head and prayed over her
[45:43] food
[45:45] and I thought
[45:46] truly she's weird
[45:49] and I'm going to be weird with her
[45:52] I bowed my head and prayed for my food
[45:54] when I raised my head that kid's looking
[45:55] at me like not you
[45:59] but you see the spirit of the world my
[46:02] brother and sister has taken and made
[46:04] everything the house to do with God
[46:05] unless it's religion
[46:08] religion's not weird
[46:11] serving God is
[46:15] and so we see this man as the prophet of
[46:17] God is speaking
[46:19] this man would come and he he got
[46:22] started maybe in little things and
[46:24] brother Branham talks about that and I
[46:28] didn't put it up as a quote here but I'm
[46:30] drawing this out of uh uh
[46:33] exhortation of Divine Healing and
[46:36] brother branham's talking about kindred
[46:38] spirits and how that it is the dove
[46:41] stays with the doves and the vulture
[46:43] scavengers stay together and the
[46:45] buzzards stay together and so you'll see
[46:48] what happens and when these Spirits
[46:50] start to work they want to draw into a
[46:53] kindred atmosphere and so it's there
[46:56] that we see this this man it was the end
[46:59] up he ends up from this city and he ends
[47:01] up out in the tombs well what's out in
[47:04] the tombs dead
[47:07] it's just dead my brother and sister
[47:09] there's no life amongst the tombs and
[47:11] and that's what Satan wants to do he
[47:14] wants to take and make whatever we have
[47:17] in our life he wants to make it dead our
[47:19] relationship with God dead relationship
[47:21] with one another dead and emotionally
[47:24] Dead all of the things that we see as
[47:26] issues in the world today is because
[47:29] Satan has put an anointed not with a
[47:32] spirit they say we're concerned about
[47:34] the next generation of young people
[47:36] coming up because they have no
[47:38] motivations they have no no there's
[47:40] nothing to look forward to why because
[47:42] there's anointing of death upon the land
[47:45] and so it's there that they don't
[47:47] recognize how that this has been a
[47:49] spirit that has come in and it's
[47:52] infecting not in the way that they
[47:54] thought it would or the way that man
[47:56] would die look at that or describe it
[47:58] but it is still an anointing and so it's
[48:02] there as we move forward it would appear
[48:04] that this this man had no hope the
[48:07] scripture says he'd been out there
[48:08] amongst the tombs for a while this
[48:10] wasn't just something that happened last
[48:12] week but this had become an identity for
[48:16] this man he'd become a place where
[48:18] actually he was comfortable and I'm
[48:21] telling you I have witnessed this in my
[48:23] times uh in places in the world today my
[48:26] brother and sister you can have people
[48:27] whatever the age would be and as long as
[48:31] God is not dealing with them openly
[48:33] Satan lets them kind of just go on and
[48:36] live life but the minute someone starts
[48:38] to witness to them God starts to deal
[48:40] with him chaos starts happening
[48:42] everywhere and they start to become rude
[48:45] and indignant and all of these things
[48:47] you know and if you say well brother
[48:49] Paul what do you mean well it might not
[48:52] always come out as a rudeness but if
[48:55] you'll understand the spirit that causes
[48:57] mankind to say don't judge me
[49:02] that is not a man or a woman or a child
[49:06] pushing back that is a spirit
[49:09] and it is the same spirit that anointed
[49:13] this man in the tombs that he was
[49:16] becoming or had become resistant to
[49:19] anything that would change his position
[49:21] my chains are gone my brother and sister
[49:25] God has come and broke the spirit that
[49:29] would make you and I resistant to the
[49:31] move of God to the presence of God in
[49:34] our life can we say thank you Lord
[49:36] tonight that that chain that made us
[49:39] resistant held us back has been broken
[49:42] oh thank you Lord amen and so here it is
[49:46] what's happening is he is going it
[49:49] appears no hope
[49:51] it appears that there's nothing going to
[49:53] change for this man
[49:55] he's come debased to the place he's
[49:58] naked
[50:00] and doesn't even know it
[50:02] does the scripture not say that's a
[50:04] spirit of the age
[50:05] amen and Harry is he doesn't even care
[50:08] he's so possessed by his spirit and you
[50:10] look and see this position that he has
[50:13] come and as time progressed everything
[50:16] that was near and dear to him is just
[50:19] getting further and further away brother
[50:22] Branham talks about how no doubt that he
[50:25] had a wife and he had children and he
[50:28] had departed out of that household and
[50:30] we'll just read a little snippet my
[50:32] brother and sister of the quote here but
[50:34] let me catch this right here every time
[50:37] someone saw this man it seemed as though
[50:40] he had got worse I'm telling you my
[50:43] brother and sister the prophet of God
[50:44] talked about it in natural healing and
[50:47] natural healing and spiritual healing
[50:49] oftentimes parallel each other and the
[50:52] prophet of God says now you're healed in
[50:54] the name of Jesus Christ now you go home
[50:57] you'll get sicker before you get better
[50:59] but you believe that you were healed now
[51:03] look at what happens sometimes when God
[51:05] comes on the scene starts to move on the
[51:07] soul it seems as though they're going
[51:09] the opposite direction it seems as
[51:12] though it went downhill from the time
[51:14] that God stirred them but my brother and
[51:16] sister what it is is God is working and
[51:18] Satan's working overtime amen but Satan
[51:21] on overtime cannot even deal amen with
[51:25] the word of God so it don't matter how
[51:27] many hours Satan Works amen he cannot
[51:30] overcome the word oh aren't you glad
[51:32] about that tonight amen so there it is
[51:35] that it starts to get worse but I'm
[51:38] telling you don't you just love this my
[51:40] brother and sister the appointment had
[51:43] already been set God had heard that
[51:47] voice The Voice not of the physical man
[51:50] but the voice of the Soul had been
[51:53] crying out I long for deliverance I long
[51:56] for Liberty I long to be free in Jesus
[51:59] Christ
[52:01] and it was there God hears that voice
[52:04] amen imagine how strong that the voice
[52:07] would be but also Imagine the strength
[52:09] of the hearing of the one who hears
[52:14] all the way across the sea
[52:17] we've got the privilege
[52:19] it's a pretty good sized chunk of water
[52:21] actually
[52:23] you know I never really fathomed you
[52:25] know we looked it up and you know it was
[52:27] 13 miles long and this wide or whatever
[52:30] and you still don't fathom until you're
[52:31] on a boat and you're leaving the dock
[52:35] and there's the shore
[52:37] way over there
[52:39] you realize my brother and sister
[52:42] the man who was the captain of our boat
[52:45] somebody asked him does how how what's
[52:47] what's it like when it storms here and
[52:50] that's a pretty good sized boat we were
[52:51] on wasn't it I think it might even
[52:53] qualify as a ship
[52:55] and he says you don't want to be out
[52:56] here when it storms
[53:00] so it's not just some little little
[53:02] white cap a real storm
[53:06] and in spite of that
[53:08] Jesus heard
[53:10] and responded
[53:12] my oh my
[53:15] makes me happy the appointment's been
[53:17] set
[53:18] amen so what happened here is a
[53:21] chain-breaking demon
[53:23] see how Satan tries to duplicate this
[53:26] amen our chains have been broken and set
[53:29] us free Satan comes along in his own
[53:32] impersonation of it and breaks chains
[53:35] but God says you know what you can break
[53:37] all the change you want but you're not
[53:39] free and when I break the chains you are
[53:42] free and so this chain-breaking demon is
[53:46] fixing to meet his match amen and
[53:48] realize now the prophet of God says this
[53:50] and we just take this for the context he
[53:53] sent it in recognize it is not the
[53:55] person it is the spirit on them amen and
[54:00] I think oftentimes we get too carried
[54:02] away with the idea well so and so did
[54:04] this or said that this happened this way
[54:07] and they did that I don't know what's
[54:09] wrong with that brother or that sister
[54:10] or why they would act that way stop and
[54:14] recognize that is not your brother that
[54:17] is not your sister that is a spirit
[54:19] trying to stir up everything he can stir
[54:23] up amen so much so Satan thought that if
[54:28] he ran down to the water and met Jesus
[54:30] on the shore that he could somehow deter
[54:33] him and get him to turn turn around and
[54:36] get back in the boat and leave but my
[54:38] brother and sister I'm so glad that when
[54:40] God sets an appointment he says I'm
[54:42] going to be there I'll be right there on
[54:45] time and there is nothing turning me
[54:47] around nothing turning me to the side
[54:49] but I will be there at the time that I
[54:53] have designated not what man designated
[54:55] not a church designated what God himself
[54:58] said this is the hour this is a time
[55:01] this is a place and I'm fixing to break
[55:03] the chain of a spirit on an individual
[55:06] oh thank you Lord
[55:08] Hallelujah now remember my brother and
[55:10] sister chains come in all sizes
[55:13] sometimes we get the idea of somebody's
[55:15] burden down with huge chains that they
[55:19] must be under just a terrible burden but
[55:21] my brother and sister if we've ever come
[55:23] and I'm not going to speak as though you
[55:25] are there but this kind of people like
[55:27] us if you've ever come to the point that
[55:29] you're going to bed and almost find it
[55:31] uh uh you're resistant to taking time to
[55:34] pray or read your Bible before you go to
[55:36] bed there's a chain
[55:38] can be that simple
[55:40] I met a brother one time I I just
[55:43] thought he was just a wonderful brother
[55:44] somewhere in the course of everything
[55:46] going on uh this South America he told
[55:49] me he says brother Paul he said I feel
[55:51] so terrible and I was like well what
[55:53] brother and he goes well he said I get
[55:56] out in a restaurant and he said I hardly
[55:58] ever pray over my food because I feel so
[56:01] so conspicuous and he said I don't
[56:03] really believe I'm ashamed I just feel
[56:06] so awkward
[56:09] you know like when you start to pray in
[56:11] the building go silent the cafe
[56:14] and I was like when when you bow your
[56:16] head in the cafe and start to pray it
[56:18] goes silent goes yeah I said brother
[56:21] that's nothing be ashamed of that's a
[56:23] good sign
[56:24] that's a sign that these people are
[56:26] respecting you and they're respecting
[56:28] God that's the time to be bold
[56:31] that's the time to not keep your voice I
[56:33] tell you what you go with some of these
[56:35] brothers brother Kenny camps you sit
[56:37] down in a little cafe in the middle of
[56:38] North Carolina with brother Kenny Capps
[56:40] and everybody in that Cafe knows brother
[56:43] Kenny Capps is praying for food
[56:45] amen because it's not a show-off but he
[56:48] just not embarrassed not at least bit
[56:50] hindered Lord bless the people that
[56:53] prepared this the people that grew this
[56:55] bless the staff he knew everyone in the
[56:57] little cafe bless each one of them bless
[57:00] our waitress blah blah blah and and you
[57:03] know what that place went silent also
[57:06] my brother and sister nothing be ashamed
[57:08] of but this brother realized that there
[57:11] was something hindering him and when he
[57:13] realized that we had a little
[57:14] conversation he realized it wasn't
[57:16] really him
[57:18] good faithful man he wasn't ashamed to
[57:21] be a Christian but Satan had thrown a
[57:24] little chain on him
[57:26] and in that circumstance it bound him
[57:29] and he says I walk out I feel so ashamed
[57:32] Lord why
[57:33] why am I where I just closed my eyes and
[57:37] pray acquired
[57:39] they call them interpersonal prayers
[57:42] sounds sophisticated when you're ashamed
[57:45] to pray in public
[57:46] it's just a little interpersonal prayer
[57:53] I used to be that way
[57:57] and many years ago one day
[58:00] God dealt with me so hard
[58:05] and I was like never never never again
[58:11] will I allow a spirit amen to keep me
[58:14] from blessing
[58:15] food it comes so much I've shared this
[58:19] story a long time ago we used to eat at
[58:21] The Little Country Cafe thing out there
[58:23] and one time I come in there a little
[58:25] late the table's clear full but guys I
[58:27] said I'll just eat and go back to work
[58:28] and they're like no we'll make rooms so
[58:30] these grown men all scrunching on these
[58:32] little benches and I got a seat right
[58:34] there and put my food down there and
[58:36] bowed my head and I started praying and
[58:38] something come over me and I had a
[58:40] friend his name's Doug sitting directly
[58:43] across the table from me and I don't
[58:44] know why of all these guys I consider
[58:46] them all friends but I was like Lord
[58:47] just touch my friend Doug
[58:50] when I lifted my head up from praying
[58:52] Doug said across there kind of boldly
[58:55] looked me in the eyes and said did you
[58:57] pray for me
[58:58] and it just
[59:00] it was so organic that it was obvious
[59:02] that and I said yes I did
[59:05] when you talk about a table going quiet
[59:07] everybody's like oh
[59:10] and my friend dog oh
[59:14] God works in mysterious ways
[59:17] God knew that Satan was going to try and
[59:19] throw a chain around that whole thing by
[59:21] throwing a little something like that
[59:23] out and God Beat the Devil to it
[59:25] amen now let me get back on track here
[59:27] hallelujah now look here see so
[59:30] everything near and dear move farther
[59:31] and farther away it's getting worse it's
[59:33] getting worse but as we look at this
[59:35] just like you you know I still like to
[59:37] actually use a calendar believe it or
[59:39] not to plan for the future you know you
[59:41] flip a few months ahead and ride it on
[59:44] the date and then when you get there the
[59:46] rest of you are more modern no doubt use
[59:48] your phone amen I use my phone and then
[59:51] when the day comes and it doesn't ding
[59:52] or do anything I realized that I had
[59:55] done something wrong but it's a little
[59:57] late amen so it's there and then it
[1:00:00] comes and so this chain breaking was
[1:00:02] starting to take place and no one
[1:00:04] recognized it and amen now when then
[1:00:07] Jesus came amen it's just a beautiful
[1:00:09] quote here now she this is coming from
[1:00:13] from another portion of this but go read
[1:00:15] it all and she could not go to Jesus but
[1:00:18] oh there is one blessed thing you can go
[1:00:21] to him but he can come to you and he has
[1:00:24] never again any time fail Can someone
[1:00:27] say Amen one day way down in the land of
[1:00:30] godara No Doubt a sociable God-fearing
[1:00:33] citizen once lived and he got out with
[1:00:36] the wrong crowd maybe just married had
[1:00:39] two or three little kitties but he got
[1:00:41] mixed up in the wrong group and that's
[1:00:43] where many a young man or young woman
[1:00:45] loses out getting mixed up in the wrong
[1:00:47] group the wrong Associates and so one
[1:00:51] night they had taken him out give him a
[1:00:53] drink or play a little game do this or
[1:00:56] gamble a little it won't hurt then the
[1:00:58] first devil entered him now brother
[1:01:01] Branham is not saying this is exactly
[1:01:03] how it happened he's giving us just an
[1:01:06] insight into how it works and I'll tell
[1:01:09] you those of you that rubbed elbows with
[1:01:11] the world you'll know what this is like
[1:01:12] I used to justify it Jerry and I married
[1:01:15] had a couple little kitties amen I would
[1:01:17] go out on Friday nights I would shoot
[1:01:19] pool come home at one or two in the
[1:01:21] morning and I Justified it I'm not
[1:01:23] drinking I'm not smoking I'm not looking
[1:01:25] any other girls I'm not doing anything
[1:01:27] bad but my brother and sister there is
[1:01:30] the Trap that Satan lays and we justify
[1:01:33] I'm the kind of insert into what the
[1:01:35] prophet's saying here justify I'm not
[1:01:38] doing anything wrong in fact he might be
[1:01:42] able to say I'm not doing anything
[1:01:44] different than others in the church are
[1:01:47] doing but that don't make it right
[1:01:50] because someone else is doing it
[1:01:53] hmm
[1:01:55] and that's a mini young man young woman
[1:01:57] loses out get mixed up wrong Associates
[1:02:00] and one night they take and give him a
[1:02:02] drink maybe never took one before takes
[1:02:04] a little sip not enough to get drunk not
[1:02:07] enough to get uh you know and by to
[1:02:09] where he's acting silly but it was the
[1:02:12] ACT
[1:02:14] my brother and sister that's how Satan
[1:02:16] works it's the ACT
[1:02:17] and when you get started like the
[1:02:19] proverbial snowball amen when it starts
[1:02:22] downhill it's not an avalanche when it
[1:02:25] starts
[1:02:26] but it is when it finishes
[1:02:28] amen and so it's there play a little
[1:02:32] game gamble a little won't hurt first
[1:02:34] devil entered him he went home and had
[1:02:36] to tell his wife a lie
[1:02:38] boy I'll tell you what then that lion
[1:02:40] Spirit when he got away with it not lion
[1:02:43] spirit is that like see this ain't so
[1:02:45] bad
[1:02:47] come on
[1:02:49] let me just put this
[1:02:51] our husbands our wives are not our enemy
[1:02:55] they are us
[1:02:57] amen that's what the word says one flash
[1:02:59] they are us
[1:03:01] so you know if you feel compelled to do
[1:03:04] something like that it's a devil
[1:03:07] come on
[1:03:11] tell his wife lie second devil entered
[1:03:13] him until he was possessed with a legion
[1:03:16] he got Beyond any help on a man there
[1:03:18] was nobody could help it they would go
[1:03:20] out there imagine how many men strong
[1:03:22] men it would take to tackle a man like
[1:03:25] this and to hold him down and bind him
[1:03:28] in Chains
[1:03:31] and they say we got him look at him here
[1:03:33] he is bound
[1:03:36] but then the spirit moves
[1:03:43] yeah we can use that Universal can't we
[1:03:45] the spirit
[1:03:47] because there are two
[1:03:51] we want to break it down in all kinds of
[1:03:53] categories and whatever else there's
[1:03:54] either Holy Spirit or an evil spirit
[1:03:57] amen demonic or of God and his possessed
[1:04:02] or Legion got Beyond in help poor
[1:04:03] fellows drove out to the tombs
[1:04:06] for one nobody wants a man like that in
[1:04:08] their neighborhood
[1:04:10] and imagine let's just draw this just a
[1:04:12] little closer there he is in his own
[1:04:13] house
[1:04:14] his own wife his own children now
[1:04:16] terrified because they don't know when
[1:04:18] this will come upon him
[1:04:22] they don't know when there'll be a
[1:04:24] reaction to something said
[1:04:26] a reaction to something
[1:04:29] we have a little deal on the mirror in
[1:04:31] the house
[1:04:33] basically just to sum it up it says shut
[1:04:36] up
[1:04:38] and it gives all these when this happens
[1:04:41] ties it back to scripture when this
[1:04:43] happens
[1:04:44] don't respond
[1:04:46] this happens don't say a word this
[1:04:48] happens don't
[1:04:49] and oftentimes my brother and sister you
[1:04:51] realize those Spirits are actually
[1:04:53] waiting in ambush
[1:04:55] come on married folks
[1:04:58] you know good and well there's times we
[1:05:00] know I shouldn't say this but I'm going
[1:05:02] to say it anyhow
[1:05:03] and then what happens somebody flipped a
[1:05:06] match out and somebody else poured the
[1:05:08] gasoline
[1:05:09] but what happens whenever the chain
[1:05:12] breaker is present and let me just put
[1:05:16] it harshly
[1:05:17] you're prayed up and I'm prayed up the
[1:05:20] same thing can be said and we will say
[1:05:23] yes praise God we should pray about that
[1:05:28] or
[1:05:35] my Dad loved the joke about the man at
[1:05:38] work and he tells his co-worker
[1:05:41] but I had my wife last night my wife was
[1:05:43] down on her hands and knees begging
[1:05:47] co-worker looks at him goes
[1:05:50] wow are you serious
[1:05:53] what was she begging
[1:05:56] well
[1:05:58] she was saying come out from underneath
[1:06:00] that bed and Fight Like a Man
[1:06:03] hmm you know what kind of spirit it'd
[1:06:06] take to get to that place
[1:06:08] and they're right here my brother and
[1:06:09] sister they're right here
[1:06:12] they're just waiting for their
[1:06:13] opportunity they're waiting for their
[1:06:14] time to pour out their anointing
[1:06:18] but God says you know what I knew how to
[1:06:20] deal with that anointing and so here it
[1:06:22] is he comes and it starts so simple he's
[1:06:24] out at the pool halls shooting a little
[1:06:26] pool he's not smoking he's not drinking
[1:06:28] he's Justified I'm just having friend
[1:06:31] fun with my friends
[1:06:35] oh wait I went to church with my friends
[1:06:39] maybe he did too
[1:06:43] now you look at this
[1:06:45] it comes to this place the prophet gives
[1:06:47] us a little view of what happened to a
[1:06:50] normal man
[1:06:51] to a man that was not irregular he
[1:06:53] wasn't some crazy man he was just a man
[1:06:56] but Satan come and went to work and
[1:06:59] Satan is very faithful talking to a man
[1:07:02] about natural success and the man makes
[1:07:04] a statement he goes well you know it's
[1:07:06] still very simple
[1:07:08] just get up and go to work and you'll be
[1:07:11] successful
[1:07:13] and the devil gets up and he goes to
[1:07:15] work and he is successful
[1:07:19] amen
[1:07:20] so he sees Jesus and he cries out and he
[1:07:24] falls down before him my brother and
[1:07:25] sister the word says that every knee
[1:07:27] shall bow and so we see this sign right
[1:07:30] here that this this man possessed with
[1:07:33] these demons uh falls down and and says
[1:07:36] with a loud voice what have I had to do
[1:07:38] with thee Jesus thou Son of God most
[1:07:40] high and the spirits in him see not the
[1:07:43] man himself because we'll find as The
[1:07:45] Story Goes later this man is there with
[1:07:48] Jesus so it's not the man it's the
[1:07:50] spirits on the man that is resisting and
[1:07:53] pushing back and saying what do I have
[1:07:55] to do with you
[1:07:57] but if Jesus was to go into the minute
[1:08:00] details and he was to explain it all to
[1:08:03] him he would be able to say not you
[1:08:05] Legion but this man's Soul has been
[1:08:08] crying out and I was on the other Shore
[1:08:11] and I heard his soul cry out to me and I
[1:08:15] followed the cry and this is where I'm
[1:08:17] at you're not why I'm here demon you're
[1:08:20] not even there my brother and sister
[1:08:22] people are there we're going to cast
[1:08:24] these demons out we're going to do this
[1:08:26] we're going to do that well if we're
[1:08:28] going to get the demon out we better get
[1:08:30] something in
[1:08:32] not just cast out the demon we gotta
[1:08:35] have something that will take residence
[1:08:37] and fill that space or that demon will
[1:08:40] come back and say look there's room
[1:08:42] enough now for my friends
[1:08:45] so it's there as we go I want to kind of
[1:08:48] just hurry through this you know the St
[1:08:50] the story and so while verse 29 lays it
[1:08:55] out in this fact here that he had
[1:08:57] commanded that Spirit to come out uh you
[1:09:00] know it was there my brother and sister
[1:09:02] we see that it was this spirit being
[1:09:06] cast out now opens the door
[1:09:10] and God comes back now now you're not
[1:09:13] going to find this in the scripture but
[1:09:14] the prophet of God teaches this
[1:09:18] the Holy Spirit opened the door
[1:09:22] but it had to have been that man's
[1:09:23] heart's cry to invite him in
[1:09:27] so just the fact that Jesus broke the
[1:09:30] power of that Spirit did not deliver
[1:09:34] that man
[1:09:36] it was an open heart and soul crying for
[1:09:40] deliverance so we don't really see this
[1:09:42] but we find the principle of it are you
[1:09:44] with me and so it's there this man now
[1:09:47] that demon he's not happy that he's been
[1:09:50] called out and cast out and the Very
[1:09:53] chain you might say of the spirit that
[1:09:55] he has bound this man with has been
[1:09:58] broken oh I can hear the chains falling
[1:10:00] right now my brother and sister there
[1:10:02] should not be one thing that we are
[1:10:04] bound with tonight but we should be able
[1:10:07] to stop and say I hear the chains
[1:10:09] falling I hear their rattle on the floor
[1:10:12] I hear their rattle on the altar eyes no
[1:10:15] Deliverance has come
[1:10:18] oh Hallelujah
[1:10:20] and so it is
[1:10:22] this spirit
[1:10:24] this voice that represented these demons
[1:10:27] you know declares I'm Legion my brother
[1:10:30] and sister it does not matter if it's
[1:10:32] one Spirit on the individual or five or
[1:10:35] seven or Twenty or a hundred or a
[1:10:37] thousand amen when the deliverer comes
[1:10:40] amen it's not deliver until it's not
[1:10:43] delivered when my brother and sister
[1:10:46] he's the deliverer amen he is our
[1:10:49] provider he is everything that he ever
[1:10:52] said he would be in his word and there
[1:10:55] is not one failure to be recorded
[1:10:57] against our lord Jesus for him not doing
[1:11:00] now my brother and sister we have
[1:11:01] stories the prophet tells people get
[1:11:03] healed they're delivered they go out
[1:11:05] they talk to people they start to tell
[1:11:07] them that's nonsense they come back to
[1:11:09] the prophet and say I I know I lost my
[1:11:11] healing or whatever and the prophet of
[1:11:13] God says you know what look I you didn't
[1:11:15] lose it because of what I did or it
[1:11:17] wasn't powerful enough you started man
[1:11:19] speaking and repeating and associating
[1:11:22] and you went in if I can put it this way
[1:11:24] tonight you went in and stood there
[1:11:27] while they put a chain of unbelief
[1:11:30] around you
[1:11:32] and they stood right there and they
[1:11:35] didn't hold you down with a paddle lock
[1:11:37] and lock the chain of unbelief they
[1:11:40] convinced you to take the chain of
[1:11:43] unbelief and lock the padlock on
[1:11:45] yourself
[1:11:48] but praise God
[1:11:50] if
[1:11:51] there's not a key for that padlock
[1:11:55] our lord Jesus
[1:11:57] just simply breaks it
[1:11:59] oh you talk about a power Satan's trying
[1:12:03] to duplicate it he's trying to imitate
[1:12:04] it but he can't do it amen and I don't
[1:12:07] care what it is amen you know there'll
[1:12:10] be things that happen my brother and
[1:12:12] sister and people will say well this has
[1:12:13] been in our family amen I I just
[1:12:17] remember so well years ago sitting right
[1:12:19] there in the church amen and listening
[1:12:21] to brother Gideon preach uh breaking the
[1:12:24] cycle is how I remember those Services
[1:12:26] Brother David sister Diane were there
[1:12:28] amen and you look at that and brother
[1:12:31] getting in laying out such a beautiful
[1:12:33] picture and it don't matter you can say
[1:12:35] our family has always been this way good
[1:12:38] there's one that can break the chain
[1:12:40] tonight there's one that says I've got
[1:12:43] an appointment with you Amen to break
[1:12:45] this chain to change the pattern of your
[1:12:49] family that may be of God Terry now in
[1:12:51] the ways that you become the great
[1:12:53] grandparent the family might say you
[1:12:56] know what we've always been in the house
[1:12:58] of God we always they serve God we
[1:13:01] believe the word because that's all they
[1:13:03] know and the cycle has been changed
[1:13:07] oh you look how God works here now amen
[1:13:12] oh Hallelujah
[1:13:15] now look at this brother Branham speaks
[1:13:17] here
[1:13:18] the maniac and gadera
[1:13:22] just kind of move forward here
[1:13:28] now he's actually talking about
[1:13:29] Sadducees Pharisees right here at the
[1:13:31] top it's good to go read these Saints
[1:13:33] don't take Brother Paul's reading or
[1:13:36] presentation of it go read it and make
[1:13:38] sure brother Paul isn't out in left
[1:13:40] field
[1:13:41] they always had healings and signs and
[1:13:43] wonders God worked with them through the
[1:13:45] age and you look back there and see what
[1:13:47] the Pharisees did they fought against it
[1:13:51] every time God come right down it wasn't
[1:13:53] completely absent from Israel it wasn't
[1:13:55] as though Israel had nothing going on my
[1:13:58] brother and sister but you'll find that
[1:14:00] that Spirit of religion
[1:14:03] hmm
[1:14:04] that's not mistaken when you read where
[1:14:06] the prophet of God says oh I feel
[1:14:08] religious tonight
[1:14:09] that's not what we're talking about
[1:14:11] we're talking about a deep rooted
[1:14:14] tradition of man that's religion right
[1:14:17] there at its finest see what the
[1:14:20] Pharisees did they fought against it you
[1:14:22] see where they went don't get on this
[1:14:24] don't don't get on that same group
[1:14:26] better get over here
[1:14:29] I'm going to get detoured for a moment
[1:14:35] that spirit's alive and well
[1:14:38] right in the message
[1:14:42] we got more Revelation than they do
[1:14:46] show it to me
[1:14:48] oh no no I'm not talking about you
[1:14:50] digging out a book are you doing that
[1:14:52] let's just go ahead and
[1:14:54] go through the wilderness
[1:14:58] let's go down in a valley for a while
[1:15:01] then you can show me
[1:15:04] you got more than everyone else
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:09] what's God looking for
[1:15:13] character
[1:15:15] now look at this don't get it that's
[1:15:17] that same group better get over here you
[1:15:19] see where the and I'm I'll guarantee you
[1:15:22] a few to finish that that said religion
[1:15:32] of in that day scholarship far beyond
[1:15:35] what we got now even a little man had to
[1:15:37] be so holy he had to be born in a
[1:15:40] certain tribe where he couldn't even be
[1:15:42] a minister
[1:15:44] boy that's pretty strict when you think
[1:15:46] about it and everything like that and
[1:15:48] yet when they come Jesus said you got
[1:15:51] the devil
[1:15:52] now what's harsh of him wasn't it I mean
[1:15:55] these are some of the finest men of the
[1:15:57] day they knew exactly how to robe
[1:16:01] themselves they knew how to present
[1:16:03] themselves they knew exactly the
[1:16:05] etiquette you know I just uh I thought
[1:16:08] this was funny I've seen a little deal
[1:16:10] on the computer and
[1:16:12] um I I was looking up some stuff about
[1:16:15] welding and this little deal popped up
[1:16:17] as a sidebar you know how they are and
[1:16:19] it said seven things not to do in a good
[1:16:21] in a nice restaurant and I thought you
[1:16:23] know I've been to a couple nice
[1:16:24] restaurants I'll read that and you know
[1:16:26] they tell you how don't and they I won't
[1:16:28] go into it but they say don't do this I
[1:16:30] do it don't do this I do it don't do
[1:16:32] this I do it but you know what they took
[1:16:34] my money
[1:16:35] and they told me come back
[1:16:38] sounds like church
[1:16:43] come on
[1:16:45] church is good business I was sharing
[1:16:47] this with brother Chris in the back my
[1:16:49] brother and sister all these things that
[1:16:50] happen out here the church is saying
[1:16:52] don't this and don't that and they just
[1:16:54] do it and do it and do it and my brother
[1:16:56] and sister what does it all come down to
[1:16:58] give us your money and come back
[1:17:01] just like a fine restaurant
[1:17:04] a business everything the prophet of God
[1:17:06] said about that has come to pass
[1:17:09] it is a business
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:13] and brother Isaac showed me how in the
[1:17:15] world we live in today the best business
[1:17:17] model there is in the world today is I
[1:17:20] don't I won't have the right word but
[1:17:22] it's just reoccurring right it's where
[1:17:24] the people come back to you you don't
[1:17:26] get a lot of money out of them at once
[1:17:27] but they got to come back all the time
[1:17:29] that's why when you buy a computer now
[1:17:31] that you have a use of a program uh
[1:17:34] whatever word or whatever that's called
[1:17:36] for a year and after that you got to
[1:17:38] subscribe and then for the rest of your
[1:17:40] life you send them
[1:17:42] x amount dollars every year
[1:17:45] hmm
[1:17:46] sounds like church
[1:17:53] they had to be holy had to be born
[1:17:55] certain family even to be a minister it
[1:17:57] had everything like that and yet when
[1:17:58] they come Jesus said you got a devil
[1:18:00] said you're of your father the devil is
[1:18:02] that right yes sir polish Scholars so
[1:18:05] therefore religious Spirits now remember
[1:18:08] my brother and sister it's not all
[1:18:10] spirits of alcohol and spirits of
[1:18:13] cigarettes and spirits of dancing and
[1:18:15] spirits of vulgarity and and uh crude
[1:18:19] languages and whatever it's not always
[1:18:22] sometimes they're religious spirits
[1:18:25] and the prophet of God actually said
[1:18:27] religious Spirits are one of the worst
[1:18:29] that there is
[1:18:31] instead of making cutting a man and
[1:18:33] making him be a maniac he can be a
[1:18:36] shrewd scholar
[1:18:38] wow
[1:18:40] so that man amongst the tombs has made
[1:18:42] got the same spirit manifested in a
[1:18:45] different fashion
[1:18:46] as the man
[1:18:49] oh my
[1:18:51] scholar
[1:18:53] crazy man in the tombs
[1:18:56] how can that be
[1:18:58] a devil
[1:19:01] a devil
[1:19:06] see it was easy to see the spirit on the
[1:19:08] maniac wasn't it I mean he's running
[1:19:10] around naked in the tombs killing people
[1:19:14] that traveled the road
[1:19:16] but my brother and sister this rude
[1:19:18] scholar just kills him spiritually
[1:19:21] nobody really even notices in fact it's
[1:19:23] a nice Church they're going to go there
[1:19:25] they've just everything is cultured see
[1:19:27] how these spirits come my brother and
[1:19:29] sister and they do but I'm telling you
[1:19:31] there is a purpose that God called you
[1:19:34] and I and it started from the beginning
[1:19:36] and when he placed us here as you would
[1:19:39] say at our birth natural or spiritual
[1:19:41] all of that was intended to take us home
[1:19:45] it has no other purpose my brother and
[1:19:48] sister than to take us home and when
[1:19:50] Jesus crossed over the Sea of Galilee
[1:19:52] and come to that Shore he already knew
[1:19:55] that he was going to be speaking the
[1:19:57] word to that man and telling him go back
[1:20:00] to your home amen and I'll get ahead of
[1:20:03] myself but you look at this and see the
[1:20:05] plan of god is perfect God does not do
[1:20:08] ad hoc
[1:20:11] we do ad hoc
[1:20:13] yeah
[1:20:14] what do we do now we just broke this
[1:20:16] bolt off well okay what we'll do is
[1:20:18] grind the head off of it we just
[1:20:20] destroyed a thousand dollar Hub but hey
[1:20:22] we with the other part is worth more
[1:20:24] than a thousand so we grind the head off
[1:20:26] if it ruined that one we weld a nut on
[1:20:29] top of that bolt we heat it burning red
[1:20:31] hot and apply as much force as we can
[1:20:34] and the bolt comes out and we're so
[1:20:36] happy with ourselves
[1:20:38] if we'd applied heat in the very
[1:20:40] beginning the bolt probably would have
[1:20:42] come out and we just saved all the
[1:20:44] pieces
[1:20:45] but we're ad hoc
[1:20:47] we jump in
[1:20:48] make a problem fix the problem Pat
[1:20:51] ourselves on the back make a problem fix
[1:20:53] a problem Pat ourselves on the back
[1:20:54] again
[1:20:56] God says this what's going to happen
[1:21:02] hmm
[1:21:04] and you and I getting cold on God
[1:21:07] he doesn't have to go ad hoc
[1:21:11] he already knew
[1:21:13] what would happen
[1:21:15] he already knew
[1:21:17] I'm going to take him home
[1:21:19] they're going home
[1:21:21] I'm not worried about one single thing
[1:21:23] they're going home
[1:21:25] amen when I look up from my Throne
[1:21:28] they'll be there
[1:21:29] oh that makes me excited my brother and
[1:21:31] sister amen
[1:21:33] so it's there those men now that saw
[1:21:37] this going on in the scripture amen uh
[1:21:40] verse 34 these men that saw what
[1:21:43] happened they just saw a crazy man
[1:21:45] delivered of spirits and they saw the
[1:21:48] outward appearance uh effect of those
[1:21:52] spirits and that herd of hogs and how it
[1:21:54] rumbled down the hill now we drove
[1:21:56] through that area and they said the only
[1:21:58] place that we can find on the Sea of
[1:22:00] Galilee that would fit that is this no
[1:22:03] Highway here nothing built up it would
[1:22:06] be right in this area here it went up it
[1:22:08] was kind of a flat area before it went
[1:22:10] up in the hills and there that's about
[1:22:12] the only place they said it's been
[1:22:14] researched it's been studied
[1:22:16] everything's there here is all the
[1:22:18] landmarks this will be and you're
[1:22:20] looking there and of course now mankind
[1:22:22] has built things and there's highway
[1:22:24] there and all this stuff but you realize
[1:22:26] my brother and sister wide open it
[1:22:28] wouldn't have been something that
[1:22:29] happened in some little Gully somewhere
[1:22:31] and only one guy said I think I saw it
[1:22:33] happened it would have been right out in
[1:22:36] the open it was right there for everyone
[1:22:37] present to see this man crumpled to his
[1:22:41] fall to the ground in front of Jesus and
[1:22:45] these Hogs suddenly
[1:22:46] bow and down the hill they go and into
[1:22:49] the sea and I'm telling you those
[1:22:51] Shepherds whose whole living they had
[1:22:53] just invested everything they had put a
[1:22:56] mortgage on everything you go look it up
[1:22:58] the prophet of God says that that was
[1:23:00] hard on the hog business
[1:23:04] how is hard in the hog business in in
[1:23:07] gadera and Gatherings how that went
[1:23:10] through it shook them all up our pigs
[1:23:12] all caught something and round and
[1:23:14] browned themselves and they get afraid
[1:23:17] and they go off to town and they're
[1:23:19] going to town and what are they doing
[1:23:21] are they telling Jesus version no
[1:23:24] they're telling their version they saw
[1:23:27] this Jesus guy caused the pigs to go in
[1:23:30] an uproar and run down the hill and
[1:23:34] drown themselves and they start to tell
[1:23:36] that and everybody's like we don't want
[1:23:39] that in our neighborhood we got a lot of
[1:23:41] hogs here
[1:23:43] in Israel
[1:23:45] amongst youths
[1:23:48] so they already were a resistant people
[1:23:51] shouldering out
[1:23:53] this is what we believe
[1:23:56] the prophet said this
[1:23:58] and this is what he meant
[1:24:02] hmm
[1:24:04] willing
[1:24:06] to eat their Pig
[1:24:08] hope you catch what I'm saying
[1:24:11] right in the midst
[1:24:14] of God's commandment
[1:24:16] they didn't care
[1:24:19] we raise pigs
[1:24:23] some of them serve on the Deacon board
[1:24:25] some of them are trustees some of them
[1:24:27] even are preachers
[1:24:30] but the spirit on them is a spirit
[1:24:33] of a pig
[1:24:36] kind of horse
[1:24:37] especially when I'm a preacher
[1:24:40] but you see
[1:24:42] if it doesn't apply to you it doesn't
[1:24:44] apply to you
[1:24:46] so there's no need to dig the Pitchfork
[1:24:48] out even just let it go where God
[1:24:51] intended it to go
[1:24:55] we've heard the old phrase Pitchfork you
[1:24:58] know well praise God
[1:25:03] yeah you
[1:25:06] come on
[1:25:07] it's time for us to say Amen praise God
[1:25:10] I've been delivered my chains have been
[1:25:12] broken amen that Spirit left me I have
[1:25:15] nothing to do with that amen that's not
[1:25:18] my issue and if it applies to anyone in
[1:25:20] this church then Lord touch their heart
[1:25:23] and their soul that they would fall at
[1:25:25] your feet and be delivered
[1:25:28] and sure go a long ways for churches our
[1:25:31] church included Amen to get rid of the
[1:25:34] Pitchfork amen may we ought to hang a
[1:25:36] sign up on the board no pitchforks
[1:25:38] allowed
[1:25:39] hmm
[1:25:41] so look
[1:25:43] what happens is they go and they tell
[1:25:45] their side of the story
[1:25:47] that Jesus called me speaking there and
[1:25:49] some things were said and next thing you
[1:25:51] know the pigs run down there and
[1:25:53] tremendous Financial loss in other words
[1:25:55] this preacher was a tremendous Financial
[1:25:58] loss just so he could cast a spirit out
[1:26:02] of that guy it cost us finances well the
[1:26:05] prophet of God says this the church is
[1:26:07] not willing to pay the price for a
[1:26:10] Revival
[1:26:11] brother Branham times that directly to
[1:26:13] this scripture they're not willing to
[1:26:15] pay a price amen look what could have
[1:26:18] happened if them men had run in the city
[1:26:20] brother Trevor and said we have just saw
[1:26:23] the Spirit of almighty god Jehovah has
[1:26:26] come down and delivered that crazy man
[1:26:29] out there in the graveyard and gets
[1:26:31] powerful and if the whole city run out
[1:26:33] there and said we have needs we have
[1:26:36] healings we need deliverances I got a
[1:26:38] husband needs saved I got a wife and
[1:26:40] he's saved I got children at least say
[1:26:42] would you come all the Revival in our
[1:26:44] city in the town of gadera could have a
[1:26:47] great move of God but instead they went
[1:26:49] in there and said oh my goodness he's
[1:26:50] going to ruin
[1:26:52] it's going to ruin everything we've got
[1:26:55] and what do they do if you look in the
[1:26:57] scripture there they come together and
[1:26:59] they come to him and ask him leaf
[1:27:02] oh my goodness my brother and sister the
[1:27:04] very thing they needed the most
[1:27:07] and they had ample evidence right side
[1:27:09] right outside of town in the tombs they
[1:27:12] had evidence of what Satan was doing but
[1:27:14] they were so anointed in a religious
[1:27:16] realm that we are just fine and you know
[1:27:19] what these spirits on these people these
[1:27:22] things that happen oh they're there this
[1:27:25] and that and that and this and that it's
[1:27:27] just we're human
[1:27:29] how about it's time we come and say I'm
[1:27:31] a Son of God I've got his blood flowing
[1:27:34] through my veins I am not just a human
[1:27:37] but I am a Son of God I am a daughter of
[1:27:42] God and I won't claim some Earthly
[1:27:45] Covenant when God's holding out a
[1:27:48] Heavenly Covenant for me I'm going to
[1:27:51] claim that Heavenly Covenant
[1:27:54] oh Lord help me I want to live that to
[1:27:56] the fullest
[1:27:57] oh my so they were telling their side of
[1:28:00] the story
[1:28:01] and it's there that they see
[1:28:03] you know
[1:28:06] have to admit
[1:28:08] it would have been
[1:28:09] shocking
[1:28:12] would have been shocking if it just been
[1:28:13] normal
[1:28:15] you know that's how new highways are
[1:28:16] built
[1:28:17] the one by the graveyard would have had
[1:28:19] a detour sign on it and it would have
[1:28:21] went up and around this and
[1:28:23] I'm taking this in kind of a
[1:28:26] in context but in kind of roundabout way
[1:28:30] brother Brown's talking about why
[1:28:32] there's no power in the church
[1:28:34] you know why there's no power in the
[1:28:35] church
[1:28:36] instead of dealing with the demon in the
[1:28:38] graveyard
[1:28:40] we built the detour
[1:28:44] we took and took our children
[1:28:47] and our young families and everybody and
[1:28:49] we took them out here
[1:28:50] and told them
[1:28:52] if you feel good
[1:28:53] you've got it
[1:28:58] some and I'm not saying this lightly
[1:29:00] breaks my heart
[1:29:02] some even to this moment are promoting
[1:29:05] if you just acknowledge
[1:29:07] that God sent a prophet
[1:29:10] you've got it
[1:29:15] go look no don't
[1:29:18] mount
[1:29:20] there's a man wrote a book called God's
[1:29:22] generals
[1:29:24] he promotes women preachers
[1:29:27] he promotes all kinds of stuff
[1:29:31] comes to brother Branham
[1:29:33] and says
[1:29:34] went off
[1:29:36] if it had just stayed healing people
[1:29:40] if he'd just stood at the edge of the
[1:29:43] graveyard
[1:29:45] and said
[1:29:46] do you need anything in there
[1:30:00] because we don't want to upset the
[1:30:01] balance
[1:30:07] a lot of people
[1:30:09] pay a lot of money
[1:30:13] seeking answers
[1:30:16] from the church
[1:30:23] yeah look kind of serious
[1:30:30] but there was one said I have an
[1:30:32] appointment with that man I'm not here
[1:30:34] to welfare him I'm not here to to do any
[1:30:37] of this and that leave food offerings
[1:30:39] for him I'm here to deliver him
[1:30:43] and when that one come our lord Jesus
[1:30:46] and stood right there in the appointment
[1:30:47] time to come what happened the religious
[1:30:51] people said we need you to leave town
[1:30:53] you are disrupting the balance of
[1:30:56] everything now I want to close in just
[1:30:58] the next couple minutes now look what
[1:31:00] happens here he's delivered he's now
[1:31:03] there at the feet of Jesus now Jesus is
[1:31:06] invited by all the religious people and
[1:31:09] the businessmen to leave town so he's
[1:31:11] going and this man who's just been
[1:31:14] delivered from something now I don't
[1:31:16] believe God erased his memory he knew
[1:31:18] where he came from and I'm going to say
[1:31:20] there's a lot of us need to be reminded
[1:31:23] every once in a while when we get
[1:31:24] sanctimonious and super religious we
[1:31:27] need a little reminder of where we come
[1:31:29] from because without him we are nothing
[1:31:33] amen but with him we are more than
[1:31:37] conquerors amen and it does us well to
[1:31:40] remember that without Jesus in our our
[1:31:43] midst amen that we are just common flesh
[1:31:47] Amen in fact horse flesh might have more
[1:31:50] value
[1:31:53] well sorry to speak out a turn like that
[1:31:56] see you look at this and their fear
[1:32:00] Jesus hindered their program
[1:32:02] but you look at the scripture and you'll
[1:32:03] realize they hindered Jesus's program or
[1:32:06] did they
[1:32:08] One Soul scripture talks about it one
[1:32:12] soul
[1:32:13] um
[1:32:14] oh my now we look here I want to just
[1:32:17] hurry right along
[1:32:18] so that they would go my brother and
[1:32:20] sister and and uh
[1:32:23] Jesus is like fine you invite me to
[1:32:25] leave if I'm not welcome here I'm not
[1:32:27] staying here he goes to get in the boat
[1:32:29] and now this man comes and verse 38 he
[1:32:32] says now the man out of whom the Devils
[1:32:34] were departed besought him that he might
[1:32:36] be with him but Jesus sent him away now
[1:32:39] imagine this this young man just now
[1:32:41] been delivered from you might say the
[1:32:44] worst thing and then to experience the
[1:32:47] greatest thing he would experience in
[1:32:49] his life and he wants to go with Jesus
[1:32:51] and Jesus says Nope this this ministry
[1:32:53] here come on let me just put this in
[1:32:55] here like this this ministry here is not
[1:32:58] your calling your ministry is right down
[1:33:01] there in your town in fact your ministry
[1:33:04] oh God help us for all of our thoughts
[1:33:07] to travel the world and preach to the
[1:33:09] thousands in the far away places maybe
[1:33:12] our ministry is in our own house
[1:33:16] Jesus doesn't say cast everything away
[1:33:19] and follow me he tells them no what I
[1:33:22] want you to do is go down to your city I
[1:33:26] want you to go down there and there's a
[1:33:28] story surrounding the city about how I'm
[1:33:30] a lunatic and I cause the pigs to go but
[1:33:33] when they see you in your clothes in
[1:33:36] your right mind with your wife and with
[1:33:39] your children and they see that you'll
[1:33:42] have a Ministry greater than any
[1:33:44] Pharisee because people love a
[1:33:48] first-hand witness
[1:33:52] reminds me one time I was a young man
[1:33:54] had no clue what was going on I was
[1:33:57] stopping at the bank to to uh uh cash my
[1:34:00] paycheck from uh oh I say paycheck from
[1:34:03] a construction job I just finished and
[1:34:05] the people paid me and I pull up in
[1:34:08] there not really paying attention I
[1:34:10] signed the check I jump out of the
[1:34:11] pickups start to go and there's there's
[1:34:12] ribbons
[1:34:13] I'm like
[1:34:15] what's going on here
[1:34:16] the bank got robbed
[1:34:18] oh
[1:34:19] cool
[1:34:21] they didn't think so
[1:34:24] but almost like you know turn around
[1:34:26] here we are in the scene firsthand
[1:34:29] only I wasn't firsthand
[1:34:31] the police
[1:34:32] had all these people about five feet
[1:34:35] apart six feet apart
[1:34:40] and I got to be kind of a witness of
[1:34:41] this
[1:34:44] in a little bit
[1:34:46] they I just set my pickup I'm like wow
[1:34:49] what's happening
[1:34:51] they took away witness number one
[1:34:55] they turned him loose he goes they take
[1:34:58] witness number two
[1:34:59] and you know why they did none
[1:35:02] because part of the old-fashioned way
[1:35:06] oh God God delivered me
[1:35:09] pretty soon everybody in the church is
[1:35:11] delivered
[1:35:17] whether they were or not
[1:35:19] they're delivered
[1:35:22] the police are smart enough to realize
[1:35:24] that if they hear someone say he's
[1:35:25] wearing white tennis shoes they're all
[1:35:27] going to say he's wearing white tennis
[1:35:28] shoes
[1:35:29] he's got a blue t-shirt on everybody's
[1:35:31] going to think it was a blue t-shirt
[1:35:33] but when they
[1:35:35] when they single them out
[1:35:40] you know the man that was out in the
[1:35:42] tombs
[1:35:46] saw him in the marker
[1:35:48] with his wife and his children
[1:35:51] and you know how they used to go
[1:35:53] their heads down
[1:35:55] trodden shuffling along ashamed
[1:35:59] they look so happy
[1:36:02] they look so happy as children holding
[1:36:04] on to his hands looking up with eyes of
[1:36:07] adoration
[1:36:09] his wife
[1:36:10] turning
[1:36:17] something happened to that guy
[1:36:19] well we heard that crazy Jesus guy went
[1:36:23] out there and something about spirits
[1:36:25] and pigs and I don't know it's just too
[1:36:27] weird
[1:36:30] sooner or later their day in the market
[1:36:31] there he stands
[1:36:33] hey
[1:36:37] bill
[1:36:39] how you doing
[1:36:41] good
[1:36:43] oh everybody wants to know what happened
[1:36:48] Jesus came amen
[1:36:51] Jesus came
[1:36:54] no crazy stuff
[1:36:56] no sir he spoke to that demon on me
[1:37:00] cast it out
[1:37:03] where'd it go
[1:37:04] them pigs everybody's talking about
[1:37:07] them demons have no power unless they
[1:37:11] have an abode
[1:37:14] wow
