[46:00] experts that may be used in any other
[46:02] book of literature father but what we're
[46:04] believing tonight is that you will come
[46:06] and inhabit these words father with your
[46:09] thought
[46:09] but and and minister to us and and you
[46:13] can take one thing that's said here and
[46:15] minister to every person in this
[46:17] congregation because you have a
[46:19] supernatural word and you are a
[46:20] supernatural God and we commit ourselves
[46:23] into your hands right now in the name of
[46:25] the Lord Jesus amen God bless you and be
[46:28] seated
[46:31] it seems like a like maybe a strange
[46:34] scripture to
[46:36] to take as a text but uh we have a
[46:39] method to our Madness so to speak
[46:42] uh brother Branham when he preached
[46:44] invisible union he took this as as his
[46:47] text
[46:48] and he said he said now he says he says
[46:51] most people when they look at this
[46:53] scripture they think it's a scripture
[46:55] about marriage and divorce right but he
[46:58] said it's not
[46:59] right he said this is a prophecy of the
[47:01] church in the end time
[47:03] and so and so I chose this scripture
[47:06] because well I mean as a as a minister
[47:09] you always want to use your opening
[47:12] scripture you want this to best reflect
[47:14] the thought that you want to bring
[47:17] you know you want to people because some
[47:20] people drift into their own thoughts and
[47:21] even and even while a minister is
[47:24] speaking you're thinking about something
[47:27] that was just said and then you missed
[47:28] the other thing
[47:30] yeah you know and and and yet we can
[47:33] always go back to this open in scripture
[47:35] and if we catch the thought if we catch
[47:37] the idea of what's being ministered then
[47:39] this scripture will Minister volumes to
[47:42] us
[47:43] and so this this scripture is is very
[47:47] special because brother because uh Paul
[47:50] is is drawing a a comparison between law
[47:55] and Grace
[47:57] okay because he's saying that the law
[48:00] has dominion over a man as long as he
[48:04] liveth now I want you to to notice and
[48:07] this is a very very very important point
[48:10] in this scripture the law doesn't die
[48:13] you died
[48:15] because there was a man that you were
[48:17] bound to that's right that you were
[48:20] married to
[48:21] that the law
[48:23] caused you to be in bondage
[48:26] okay see the law was good because the
[48:29] law although there's ordinances that we
[48:31] could we could look at and we could say
[48:33] you know don't eat an eagle you know I
[48:36] mean things like that we can understand
[48:37] ordinances but really the law was given
[48:41] because
[48:42] because uh Israel wanted
[48:46] something that they could do to match
[48:49] God's thought
[48:51] and so when they turned down a speaking
[48:54] a direct speaking of God at the mountain
[48:56] he said okay we don't want to hear they
[48:59] said we don't want to hear you speak
[49:02] because if we hear you speak listen this
[49:05] is I think this is an important thing
[49:07] that they said if we hear you speak
[49:09] we're going to die but see that's the
[49:12] whole object
[49:14] you know they would have died
[49:17] but they say we don't we don't want that
[49:19] so do you just you just tell us what we
[49:21] need to do
[49:23] and then we'll keep so God gave them a
[49:26] written form of his will
[49:30] and they couldn't keep it
[49:32] right so they became bound to that
[49:35] written form of God's of of God's own
[49:39] mind
[49:40] see but Paul is telling you here
[49:43] that God had something else in mind
[49:46] that he had a he had something that he
[49:49] wanted to give them and we're going to
[49:50] and we're going to get into it here in a
[49:52] minute into the book of Hebrews he had
[49:54] something he wanted to give them
[49:56] he wanted to give them a position back
[50:00] before sin happened
[50:03] because because the law is what caused
[50:06] or the the sin is what caused there to
[50:10] be a law the the sin is what caused
[50:13] there to be a form of God's interaction
[50:16] with people
[50:18] that would make us say okay all you have
[50:21] to do God is tell us what we need to do
[50:23] and we'll do it and yet we couldn't do
[50:25] it because we weren't in that original
[50:28] ought to be conditioned
[50:30] right so so then even the law that was a
[50:34] foreshadowing of the coming of Christ it
[50:37] could not do anything to the heart
[50:41] and so the foreshadowing the law coming
[50:44] and the sacrifices that run the law
[50:46] foreshadowed that something was going to
[50:48] happen now we understand this is very
[50:51] basic but Paul is fixing to tell you
[50:54] something here that is that is profound
[50:58] because he says so in verse 3 so then if
[51:01] while her husband live if she be married
[51:03] to another man she shall be called an
[51:06] adulteress okay so so let's what I want
[51:09] to do tonight because we're going to see
[51:11] it in the book of Hebrews here in a
[51:12] minute
[51:13] I want you to see
[51:15] that
[51:17] I I I can only say what I see
[51:20] right I can only tell you what I see I
[51:22] can't I can't say I can't I was telling
[51:24] brother Paul the other day I said I
[51:26] can't say I'm right and somebody else is
[51:28] wrong or somebody else is right or you
[51:30] know all I can do is say what I see
[51:33] and so I've I'm I'm viewing something
[51:35] because of the message that has come in
[51:37] this hour I'm viewing something
[51:40] that happened
[51:41] at Calvary that God confirmed in this
[51:45] hour under this message and that's that
[51:48] there are two realms
[51:51] there's a realm of time
[51:53] that we were trapped under and then
[51:56] there's an eternal Realm
[51:58] okay and and you know eternity in I
[52:02] think in in our human view of things
[52:04] which we're trying to move away from
[52:06] that human view but in our human view of
[52:08] things
[52:09] well eternity was back here
[52:12] and was interrupted by the fall and then
[52:14] at some point it's going to pick back up
[52:17] and start being eternity but eternity is
[52:19] going on right it's going on
[52:22] eternity is is going on right now in
[52:25] fact you studied the word eternity means
[52:27] now that's right it doesn't mean
[52:29] yesterday it doesn't mean tomorrow it
[52:31] means right now and that God himself is
[52:34] standing outside here's time here's the
[52:37] beginning of time here's the end of time
[52:38] and God's standing out here
[52:40] he's standing outside of that
[52:43] and so Paul is telling you right here he
[52:46] said as long as you're married to your
[52:48] first husband which is this Human
[52:51] Condition
[52:52] right you can't be married to an eternal
[52:55] condition
[52:58] right and so what happens when we're
[53:00] born again that's that's the absolute
[53:04] life of the creator
[53:07] that's born in US
[53:09] and we the prophet said we go from being
[53:12] time beings to Eternal beings so how
[53:16] should how should that affect us
[53:19] what kind of effect should that have on
[53:21] us if we step into this eternal
[53:24] perspective
[53:25] it should make us completely different
[53:27] people
[53:28] it should make us completely different
[53:30] we look at things different we see
[53:32] things with the eyes of God Amen amen
[53:35] okay so we're going we're in a study at
[53:37] home
[53:38] we're in a study at home and and have
[53:40] been for several several months on the
[53:43] book of Hebrews
[53:45] okay because I love the book of Hebrews
[53:47] and and and and you know the book of
[53:50] Hebrews is a is a special book
[53:52] because it's like the prophet said about
[53:55] the book of Ephesians or he said the
[53:57] book of Ephesians is not an Evangelical
[53:59] book
[54:01] all right this is for believers
[54:03] that's right this is something that you
[54:04] that you you dive into this book because
[54:07] you you are already have taken on a
[54:09] perspective of something you know you've
[54:12] already been changed he's not dealing
[54:14] with them like he did with the Romans
[54:15] and the Corinthians he's dealing with a
[54:18] people that are here and he needs to
[54:21] take them on to maturity well he's doing
[54:23] the same thing in the book of Hebrews
[54:25] and it's really interesting because the
[54:28] word Hebrew all right
[54:31] Abraham was first called to Hebrew in
[54:33] Genesis 15 I believe or 14 14 or 15. it
[54:37] was right before he met Melchizedek
[54:39] all right it was after Genesis 13 where
[54:42] God had taken I'm getting a mom except
[54:45] but it doesn't matter you got you could
[54:46] God had taken Abraham up on the mountain
[54:50] after he had separated from lot
[54:53] he took him up on the mountain he said
[54:55] now look north south east west look at
[54:58] every direction It All Belongs to You
[55:02] okay so then in the next chapter
[55:05] lot gets gets kidnapped right
[55:10] and then it declares that that Abraham
[55:13] is it says Abraham the Hebrew
[55:18] okay because something had happened to
[55:21] Abraham when he was caught up on that
[55:23] mountain
[55:25] all right now listen God is dealing with
[55:27] the father of our faith
[55:29] all right because we are Abraham's Royal
[55:31] Sea so he is so he did something to
[55:35] Abraham
[55:36] and Abraham in the in the strength of
[55:40] what God had done taking him up on the
[55:42] mountain he looked everywhere and he saw
[55:45] a lot
[55:47] and he said well God said everything I
[55:49] see is mine
[55:51] so he knew lot belonged to him
[55:55] and so it was in the strength of that
[55:57] Revelation that lot that Abraham took a
[56:00] bunch of farmers and went out and
[56:02] defeated these Kings and took lot and
[56:05] brought lot back
[56:06] but he's called a Hebrew and he's not
[56:09] called to Hebrew I don't care what
[56:11] theologians say I don't care what
[56:12] anybody says because I got a bell see I
[56:16] got a bell
[56:17] and when I read something and somebody
[56:19] says oh this is why Abraham was called a
[56:21] Hebrew
[56:22] that didn't strike the Bell
[56:25] so I looked up the word Hebrew and the
[56:27] word Hebrew means one who was crossed
[56:30] over
[56:32] okay and so Abraham
[56:34] was called a Hebrew because he had come
[56:37] out of Babylon and had crossed over the
[56:40] river into the Promised Land
[56:43] and so when when God is dealing with
[56:46] Paul about this book of Hebrews we can
[56:49] say that Paul is dealing with the Jews
[56:52] and he is that's one perspective
[56:54] but this book of Hebrews is written to a
[56:57] group of people who have crossed over
[57:01] and so you're able to understand you're
[57:04] able now Paul said I'm able to take you
[57:06] someplace
[57:08] because you already have this experience
[57:11] and I'm going to the prophet said I'm
[57:13] now I'm going to separate law From Grace
[57:17] because that's what he said the book of
[57:19] Hebrews was separating law From Grace so
[57:21] so let's let's just take let's just say
[57:24] that I'm right
[57:26] and the perspective is law represents
[57:30] time
[57:31] a Time perspective but Grace represents
[57:36] an eternal perspective
[57:38] okay because you know and maybe people
[57:42] are free to believe I just say what I
[57:43] see the difference between grace and
[57:46] mercy is Grace total unmerited favor
[57:50] right we get that
[57:52] Adam had Grace in the garden
[57:56] right because God had created him he
[57:59] said you're my son you know don't eat of
[58:01] that tree and we'll walk together and
[58:03] you'll live forever
[58:06] Adam did not earn that that was perfect
[58:08] total unmerited favor
[58:11] yet when time came
[58:14] now
[58:16] Adam needed Mercy
[58:19] and so when the prophet says for us that
[58:22] whenever the lamb takes the book Mercy
[58:24] is over oh no God we don't want Mercy to
[58:27] be over
[58:28] the reason that that is such a wonderful
[58:30] thing for the bride is that it means
[58:33] that time is over for the bride because
[58:36] she has stepped into her condition
[58:39] as if sin never happened
[58:42] right right and so and so that's what
[58:46] we're looking at in the book of Hebrews
[58:48] and let's go let's just turn over there
[58:50] and we'll read a few scriptures and
[58:51] there's no way that we can obviously
[58:53] cover but if I can give you like a
[58:56] little outline of the first several
[58:57] chapters and we can we can dig into this
[59:00] a little bit and show you that Paul is
[59:03] giving us a perspective
[59:06] this may be different than the way we
[59:08] think
[59:09] okay because I have I have human
[59:12] thoughts up here
[59:13] I have ways it's it's like a it's like I
[59:16] explained it this way
[59:18] all right the other day I said and I'll
[59:20] use Brother David again I say the word
[59:22] cat
[59:23] all right everybody in here
[59:26] has a perspective of what cat means
[59:29] right but me and David already have this
[59:31] deal because I'm not thinking of a
[59:34] Siamese cat or a tabby cat or a white
[59:37] cat or a black cat I'm thinking of a
[59:38] Caterpillar tractor
[59:41] yeah
[59:43] and so in order for you to understand
[59:46] what I'm saying
[59:48] you have to have my thought
[59:50] [Music]
[59:51] s but until you have my thought you're
[59:54] going to interpret what I'm saying by
[59:56] your own perspective
[59:58] by your own experience and so what
[1:00:01] happens when we're born again is that
[1:00:04] God gives us his Spirit actually his
[1:00:06] spirit is born in us from a from a gene
[1:00:09] of God that was there before the
[1:00:11] foundation of the world and so what is
[1:00:14] happening now you're you have the
[1:00:16] thoughts of God
[1:00:18] you have the mind of and that's what
[1:00:20] that's what II Peter that's what Peter
[1:00:22] is telling us that we're that we're
[1:00:24] partakers of the divine nature right and
[1:00:28] this and this life is born in us and it
[1:00:30] grows into US it grows in us and as we
[1:00:34] and it's not it's not Stan price putting
[1:00:37] on patience
[1:00:39] it's it's me recognizing that my life is
[1:00:42] Christ's life and I have the patience of
[1:00:44] Christ whether I see it in the mirror or
[1:00:46] not but I have a revelation to who I am
[1:00:49] and I'm going to declare what the word
[1:00:50] says
[1:00:52] and so watch this perspective because
[1:00:55] this is you know I've been preaching out
[1:00:57] of the book of Hebrews for years and of
[1:00:59] course we've read it but you know I just
[1:01:01] felt led this year every it seemed like
[1:01:03] every New Year's meeting we have a like
[1:01:06] a lot of churches we'll have a little
[1:01:08] watch Night Service and and I chose it I
[1:01:10] said this is going to be the theme for
[1:01:12] this year the theme for our church this
[1:01:14] year is perfection
[1:01:15] amen now Perfection is not moral
[1:01:18] perfection or Perfection is completion
[1:01:20] maturity
[1:01:22] and so and so we chose Perfection and it
[1:01:26] seemed like that I started getting into
[1:01:28] the book of Hebrews in a in a verse by
[1:01:31] verse way
[1:01:33] in my own personal study and it just
[1:01:35] bled over and now we've been in the book
[1:01:37] of Hebrews for months
[1:01:39] but but I want you to see some let's
[1:01:41] just read the first three verses here in
[1:01:44] the book of Hebrews the first chapter of
[1:01:46] God who at Sunbury times and in diverse
[1:01:48] manner spake in time pass
[1:01:51] unto the fathers by the prophets hath in
[1:01:54] these last days spoken unto us and it
[1:01:57] says by here but it's in Sun that's
[1:02:00] right he has spoken to us in Sun that's
[1:02:02] right
[1:02:03] okay now I want you to think because
[1:02:05] we're gonna we're gonna kind of Jump
[1:02:07] Ahead a little bit
[1:02:08] but if we're in Christ we're part of
[1:02:12] this speaking too
[1:02:14] we're part of the speaking too so so now
[1:02:18] because Paul is not talking to new
[1:02:20] Believers you can't talk about this to
[1:02:22] to somebody on the street but we're
[1:02:24] people that have we claim the seals are
[1:02:27] open we claim to be eating this book of
[1:02:31] Eternal Redemption and it should be
[1:02:33] doing something in us that changes the
[1:02:36] way we look at things so now Paul is now
[1:02:39] we're we're able to go back to this with
[1:02:41] a a better perspective and start digging
[1:02:44] into it and finding out what God wants
[1:02:46] to say to us so he said he hath in these
[1:02:48] last days spoken unto us and Son whom he
[1:02:52] at the pointed heir of All Things by
[1:02:53] whom also he made the worlds who being
[1:02:56] the brightness
[1:02:57] of his glory and the expressed image of
[1:03:00] his person and and back to our original
[1:03:03] scripture that we read Because if we are
[1:03:06] if if our old man has died and we are
[1:03:10] married to Christ and we are going to
[1:03:12] bring forth fruit
[1:03:14] right and so that's what Paul is to me
[1:03:17] it's it's tying it together it ties it
[1:03:21] together with with John the 15th chapter
[1:03:23] where he says I am the vine you are the
[1:03:25] branches you bear the fruit and in this
[1:03:29] bearing of the fruit that's how my
[1:03:31] father is glorified you want to glorify
[1:03:33] God you want to magnify God it's not
[1:03:36] praise God praise God it's bearing his
[1:03:38] fruits
[1:03:40] that's how you magnify God
[1:03:42] and so he says who being the brightness
[1:03:44] of his glory and express image of his
[1:03:47] person and upholding All Things by the
[1:03:49] word of his power when he had by himself
[1:03:52] purged our sin he sat down at the right
[1:03:55] hand of the Majesty on high now if you
[1:03:59] dig into this if you and we're going to
[1:04:01] look at one scripture just of just to
[1:04:03] kind of illustrate it but if you dig
[1:04:05] into this
[1:04:07] Paul is going to begin to show he's
[1:04:09] going to talk to you about Christ
[1:04:12] but he's not
[1:04:14] necessarily I'm not saying that he
[1:04:16] doesn't deal with it but he's not
[1:04:19] necessarily talking to you about the
[1:04:22] Christ that was crucified
[1:04:24] because in Romans the seventh chapter he
[1:04:27] says this the Christ you're married to
[1:04:30] the Christ that rose from the dead
[1:04:33] okay so what so what happened here's
[1:04:35] here's here's my synopsis
[1:04:38] God in the beginning he makes a creation
[1:04:42] now why did he make a creation
[1:04:45] because he was so full of love that he
[1:04:48] wanted to express himself to a creation
[1:04:51] right and so what does he do he makes it
[1:04:54] he makes a universe he makes a planet
[1:04:57] Isaiah says that that this world was
[1:04:59] created to be inhabited
[1:05:02] all right so it didn't just put a planet
[1:05:04] out there and said what am I going to do
[1:05:06] with that
[1:05:07] this whole thing was about man yes
[1:05:09] the whole thing was about man so God
[1:05:11] made the mountains he made the he made
[1:05:13] the planes he made botany life he made
[1:05:16] he made animals and then he put man on
[1:05:19] here
[1:05:20] he put man on the earth and it wasn't
[1:05:22] just man
[1:05:24] but it was he stood back and here's the
[1:05:27] whole thing here's the whole here's his
[1:05:29] whole creation right there and he stands
[1:05:31] back and he said this is very good
[1:05:35] because this fulfills my heart's desire
[1:05:39] because I want to fellowship and I want
[1:05:42] to serve God is the servant
[1:05:45] I want to serve and take care of this
[1:05:48] loving creation
[1:05:50] so he would come down and we'll deal
[1:05:52] with it maybe tomorrow with Melchizedek
[1:05:54] and theophany and all but he would come
[1:05:56] down Genesis 3 verse 8 says
[1:05:58] they heard the voice of God walking in
[1:06:01] the garden
[1:06:03] so it's theophany theophany would come
[1:06:06] down Adam was created in the form of
[1:06:09] theophany and that theophany was put
[1:06:11] into a human flesh but God would
[1:06:13] fellowship with that theophany
[1:06:16] that was the thing it wasn't the
[1:06:18] humanity
[1:06:20] because the prophet said that when Adam
[1:06:22] sinned
[1:06:24] he broke fellowship with God
[1:06:27] and we'll deal with this more tomorrow
[1:06:28] Lord willing but he broke fellowship
[1:06:30] with God
[1:06:31] but he continued to talk with Adam
[1:06:34] he continued he'd talk with Cain yeah
[1:06:37] right and so Fellowship is something
[1:06:41] more than just talking
[1:06:44] There's an actual blending and so when
[1:06:47] Adam sinned he fell from that place so
[1:06:50] now what happened
[1:06:51] this beautiful plan of God and it was
[1:06:55] all God's purpose okay I'm not saying it
[1:06:57] was an accident but this beautiful plan
[1:06:59] of God that God said this is very good
[1:07:02] sin dropped over it
[1:07:05] and now it became about Redemption
[1:07:08] the whole the whole plan it went from
[1:07:11] this place of fellowship with the focus
[1:07:14] of of of this plan of God in time being
[1:07:17] about how do we get back to this place
[1:07:21] how do we get back to this original
[1:07:22] place and so Christ came
[1:07:27] Christ came God he said I can't let
[1:07:31] somebody else pay the price because no
[1:07:33] every person is trapped under this realm
[1:07:36] of sin there's nobody worthy to do it so
[1:07:39] I must form myself into a human
[1:07:42] condition in order to come down and pay
[1:07:45] the price
[1:07:46] and so that's what he did he paid the
[1:07:49] price of redemption and he bowed his
[1:07:52] head we were preaching the other day at
[1:07:53] brother riches he bowed his head and
[1:07:55] said it is finished
[1:07:57] it's done it's complete yeah
[1:07:59] yeah so what else do we need to have
[1:08:01] done
[1:08:03] because we have
[1:08:05] even in the message with the opening of
[1:08:07] the seals and God confirming that this
[1:08:10] is what happened
[1:08:11] a restoration back to an original
[1:08:13] condition and yet we're oh man if I
[1:08:17] could only get a new body
[1:08:20] if I could only and I'm going to tell
[1:08:22] you
[1:08:23] that that new body has no qualities that
[1:08:27] make you anything
[1:08:30] it's not going to make you a better
[1:08:32] person
[1:08:34] all it is is a robe
[1:08:37] that you wear
[1:08:39] and so we're looking for a new body as
[1:08:41] if that's the savior
[1:08:43] and it's not because I'll tell you what
[1:08:45] watch this and we'll talk maybe deal
[1:08:48] with it more but Melchizedek who was
[1:08:52] logos theophany right but he had a human
[1:08:56] body
[1:08:57] right because God couldn't deal with
[1:09:00] Abraham in theophany he had to have a
[1:09:03] human condition to interact with Abraham
[1:09:06] because Abraham although he was Abraham
[1:09:08] he still didn't have access to his
[1:09:10] theophany because he wasn't born again
[1:09:13] so God had to put on a flesh to walk
[1:09:16] with Abraham and to talk with Abraham
[1:09:19] and to confirm the promises with Abraham
[1:09:21] and so what he did the prophet's the
[1:09:23] only one that says
[1:09:25] he says he picked up elements
[1:09:28] blue honor
[1:09:30] said step into that Michael step into
[1:09:32] that you know
[1:09:34] and and God stepped into a human body
[1:09:37] amen
[1:09:38] all right think about this where'd that
[1:09:40] body come from
[1:09:42] came from the earth right those were
[1:09:45] cursed elements
[1:09:47] God inhabited a body of cursed elements
[1:09:51] and brought forth his word amen
[1:09:54] so when we use our human condition as an
[1:09:57] excuse
[1:09:59] waiting for something new to come
[1:10:02] then we're breaking the word of God
[1:10:05] because even in who was this Melchizedek
[1:10:07] brother Branham said this body comes
[1:10:10] subject to the word
[1:10:11] yeah right so it's the word of God and
[1:10:15] so the problem the problem I see
[1:10:17] sometimes and I've been through it
[1:10:18] brother I've been through it myself
[1:10:20] sister I I mean I because you can ask my
[1:10:23] wife for years man I can't wait to get
[1:10:25] out of here
[1:10:26] yeah like I'm like I'm you know a woman
[1:10:29] you know that needs to be rescued
[1:10:32] right
[1:10:33] and we can have that perspective
[1:10:36] but what God has done in this hour is he
[1:10:38] confirmed his word
[1:10:41] that we are the ones that are bringing
[1:10:42] forth the word that's right he has
[1:10:45] empowered his bride to bring forth the
[1:10:48] word
[1:10:48] amen so so watch watch what he says and
[1:10:52] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
[1:10:53] because I'm gonna summarize this I don't
[1:10:56] want to get out of time but we're going
[1:10:57] to we're going to summarize this and
[1:10:58] we're going to go back and look at a
[1:10:59] scripture because he said here let me
[1:11:02] see if I can pick up because he deals
[1:11:04] with he deals with several scriptures
[1:11:05] here and what and what I did in the
[1:11:08] study
[1:11:09] if you'll take these Paul didn't have a
[1:11:12] new testament
[1:11:13] and he's dealing with Jews that know the
[1:11:15] Old Testament so he's going back and
[1:11:17] he's comparing okay these angels He said
[1:11:20] this Christ that came was not an angel
[1:11:24] this Christ that now we're fixing to
[1:11:28] tell you more about that but this Christ
[1:11:31] is not dealing with the Christ for
[1:11:35] Redemption he's dealing with the
[1:11:37] resurrected Christ
[1:11:40] every scripture that Paul references
[1:11:42] here goes back to the Victorious Messiah
[1:11:48] right not the not the Messiah for
[1:11:51] sacrifice
[1:11:52] but the Messiah that rose from the dead
[1:11:54] now watch this okay we see but under the
[1:11:57] sun he saith thy Throne of God verse 8
[1:12:00] but under the sun he saith thy Throne o
[1:12:02] God is forever and ever accept her
[1:12:04] righteousness is a deceptor of thy
[1:12:05] kingdom thouest love righteousness and
[1:12:07] hated iniquity and so forth let's go
[1:12:10] back to Psalms 45 because that's where
[1:12:12] that comes from and let's read the
[1:12:14] context because this is just one example
[1:12:16] but if you'll if you'll go to every one
[1:12:19] of those scriptures you're going to find
[1:12:20] a similar thing so Psalms 45
[1:12:24] and the first and the first I think six
[1:12:27] verses here seven verses
[1:12:29] watch the context of the scripture that
[1:12:32] Paul used to illustrate the Messiah that
[1:12:36] he's trying to introduce to these Jews
[1:12:39] not the Messiah that came as the
[1:12:41] sacrifice necessarily
[1:12:43] but as the Messiah who rose from the
[1:12:46] dead having fulfilled the sacrificial
[1:12:49] need
[1:12:52] so Paul is telling us something here
[1:12:55] because we're going from a position of
[1:12:57] law into an eternal position
[1:13:02] all right watch this all right my heart
[1:13:04] verse 1 for Psalms 44 my heart is
[1:13:07] indicting a good matter I speak of the
[1:13:10] things which I have made touching the
[1:13:12] king my tongue is a pen of a ready
[1:13:15] writer and I love that because David is
[1:13:17] saying or whoever it is that wrote this
[1:13:19] Psalm I don't think this was Osama David
[1:13:21] but he's but he's saying it may have
[1:13:23] been but he's saying I'm ready to speak
[1:13:27] I'm ready to I'm ready to speak because
[1:13:29] my heart is so excited about what I'm
[1:13:32] seeing here he said thou oh God Thou Art
[1:13:36] fairer than the children of men Grace is
[1:13:38] poured unto thy lips therefore God
[1:13:40] excuse me hath blessed the forever gerd
[1:13:44] thy sword upon thy
[1:13:48] that's not the Messiah dying on the
[1:13:50] cross
[1:13:51] that's the one who rose from the dead
[1:13:55] you see uh
[1:13:58] you know Jesus
[1:13:59] and and I hope you understand hi because
[1:14:01] it's no disrespect to the Cross because
[1:14:04] but the prophet said we look through the
[1:14:06] cross
[1:14:08] okay it's it's it's
[1:14:13] I lost my thought if you ever do that
[1:14:15] brother Paul yes yes
[1:14:18] amen it's it's not
[1:14:21] look if if we step into Redemption okay
[1:14:26] here's what it is all right Jesus Jesus
[1:14:30] died for our sins no question
[1:14:33] did Jesus have to rise from the dead to
[1:14:37] forgive our sins
[1:14:39] the answer is no
[1:14:41] because it was finished right there when
[1:14:43] Jesus bowed his head it was finished it
[1:14:46] was done everything that needed to be
[1:14:48] done to restore us back to an original
[1:14:50] condition
[1:14:52] was accomplished when he bowed his head
[1:14:54] when he died when he gave up the ghost
[1:14:55] it was done the sacrifice was made
[1:14:58] but why did he raise from the dead
[1:15:01] because he wanted to prove that his
[1:15:04] death had accomplished exactly what he
[1:15:06] said it would do and so when he rose
[1:15:09] from the dead he was the mighty
[1:15:12] conqueror
[1:15:13] he had conquered already he had
[1:15:15] conquered death and in his resurrection
[1:15:17] he gird the sword
[1:15:20] and now he has prepared
[1:15:23] for the restoration of all things amen
[1:15:26] so watch this so he said gerd thy sword
[1:15:29] upon thy Almighty o most Mighty with thy
[1:15:33] glory and thy majesty and in the Majesty
[1:15:35] I'd prosperously because of Truth and
[1:15:38] meekness and righteousness and thy right
[1:15:41] hand shall teach the Terrible Things
[1:15:43] thine ears are sharp in the heart of the
[1:15:46] king's enemies this is this is the
[1:15:48] accomplices what was accomplished at the
[1:15:50] cross
[1:15:51] he is dealing in in what Paul is telling
[1:15:55] you in the book of Hebrews is we're not
[1:15:58] dealing with the Jesus perspective of
[1:16:01] redemption
[1:16:03] we're dealing with law
[1:16:06] versus eternity
[1:16:09] if we're going to live look the prophet
[1:16:11] said it this way
[1:16:12] if we're gonna I was in I was in a
[1:16:15] church and my daughter lives in my
[1:16:16] youngest daughter lives in Canada and I
[1:16:18] was sitting in a church and brother
[1:16:19] Steve prasan he's preaching on
[1:16:21] perfection
[1:16:23] and he's and he's talking about some of
[1:16:25] the things we're talking about here
[1:16:26] maybe not but he's he's dealing with
[1:16:28] perfection he's dealing with the word
[1:16:30] being full maturity you know the word
[1:16:32] Perfection meaning maturity and he's
[1:16:33] showing going through the scripture and
[1:16:35] then he begins reading some quotes
[1:16:38] and he was reading quotes about uh you
[1:16:40] know if the prophet and how we're how
[1:16:42] our sins are forgiven
[1:16:44] Hallelujah everybody's praising God and
[1:16:46] he even says and look this is what
[1:16:48] happened he said when the when the when
[1:16:50] the person that needed the offering
[1:16:52] would bring the offering
[1:16:54] the priest wouldn't even look at the
[1:16:56] person he's looking at the offering
[1:16:59] see you know oh Hallelujah brother Steve
[1:17:01] this is the greatest thing that's ever
[1:17:03] happened our sins are forgiven
[1:17:05] and then he begins reading quotes from
[1:17:07] invisible Union where it says it's as
[1:17:10] though we never did it and everybody's
[1:17:13] sitting there
[1:17:14] like
[1:17:16] and he says well I can tell I need to
[1:17:19] preach this and again
[1:17:21] because we're not getting something
[1:17:22] happened amen
[1:17:25] something happened where we go from a
[1:17:27] Time perspective of our sins are
[1:17:29] forgiven
[1:17:31] to an eternal perspective of living the
[1:17:34] life of Christ and I never did it
[1:17:37] so how was how is God going to speak the
[1:17:41] word through a bride because she must
[1:17:43] come to a place where her life never did
[1:17:47] it yeah
[1:17:48] right but as long as we're standing over
[1:17:51] here we have a perspective that well my
[1:17:53] sins are forgiven
[1:17:55] and brother Branham gives a good
[1:17:57] illustration an invisible Union it's one
[1:17:59] of my favorite quotes out of there he's
[1:18:01] talking about he said a woman has
[1:18:04] certain virtues that she must protect
[1:18:06] all right we're mostly adults we know
[1:18:08] what he's talking about she has to
[1:18:10] protect these virtues but if she were to
[1:18:12] make a mistake
[1:18:15] she can be forgiven
[1:18:17] but she can't be justified in this life
[1:18:21] that's what he says endless life so she
[1:18:25] could be forgiven if she's going to
[1:18:27] stand right here
[1:18:28] but she's forgiven because there is a
[1:18:30] testimony against her she did it
[1:18:33] and there's a forgiveness for her
[1:18:36] but the only place where she can enter
[1:18:39] into a condition
[1:18:41] where it never happened is over here
[1:18:43] that's it
[1:18:49] people in this hour is a perspective
[1:18:52] that it never happened and I can't help
[1:18:55] I was talking with brother Paul today
[1:18:58] that this
[1:18:59] even the thought of this has become a
[1:19:01] scarecrow in the message because you
[1:19:03] have people that are taking the quotes
[1:19:04] of the prophet and they're using that as
[1:19:07] an excuse for their continued sin that's
[1:19:09] right and Paul says should we sin that
[1:19:12] Grace May abound he says God forbid this
[1:19:15] is not about that but it's about
[1:19:17] recognizing that I have a life that the
[1:19:19] word says that I have and that's the
[1:19:22] life I'm going to live by and I don't
[1:19:24] care what the mirror says I don't care
[1:19:26] how many mistakes I made but I know as
[1:19:30] far as I know my heart my heart is this
[1:19:32] word this is my source this is where it
[1:19:35] came from John 14 it says
[1:19:38] it said Jesus says I will not leave you
[1:19:41] comfortless
[1:19:43] I will come to you the word comfortless
[1:19:45] is orphans
[1:19:47] I will not leave you orphans
[1:19:51] I'm going to show you where you came
[1:19:54] from
[1:19:55] and and when you know where you came
[1:19:58] from you know where you're going
[1:20:00] you see
[1:20:02] that's what God has done
[1:20:04] and so he says here he says here verse 6
[1:20:07] thy Throne oh God is forever and ever
[1:20:10] the scepter of thy kingdom is the right
[1:20:12] scepter thou lovest righteousness and
[1:20:14] hate us and wickedness therefore God
[1:20:16] even thy God hath anointed thee with oil
[1:20:19] gladness above thy fellows and so this
[1:20:21] is the scripture but the context of it
[1:20:24] was the mighty conqueror yes
[1:20:26] it's the resurrected Christ and so
[1:20:30] that's what Paul is giving us a picture
[1:20:32] of in the book of Hebrews the difference
[1:20:33] between a law perspective that the law
[1:20:37] was sent to us so that we can be good
[1:20:39] people and the perspective here
[1:20:43] that we have the Resurrection Life of
[1:20:45] Christ
[1:20:48] and so we should be changed by this
[1:20:51] amen and then in this and then in the
[1:20:53] second chapter we're running out of time
[1:20:54] but in the second chapter then Paul
[1:20:56] let's go back to Hebrews now let's just
[1:20:58] read a scripture or two
[1:21:00] here
[1:21:02] all right because this is this is
[1:21:03] beautiful I mean
[1:21:05] Paul is because the the objective in in
[1:21:08] the book of Hebrews to me is right in
[1:21:11] the middle
[1:21:12] I remember my wife and I know there was
[1:21:14] a brother John Kaufman that preached at
[1:21:16] our church and he said you look at the
[1:21:18] you look at the Old Testament and he
[1:21:21] said you'll see scriptures that lead up
[1:21:24] to a they lead up to a crescendo and
[1:21:28] that's the important thing and then it
[1:21:30] leads to knock down on the other side
[1:21:32] the the crescendo of the book of Hebrews
[1:21:35] has let us go on to perfection
[1:21:37] but you have to understand what Paul is
[1:21:41] the foundation that Paul is laying
[1:21:43] coming up to that Perfection to know
[1:21:46] what Paul is talking about
[1:21:49] because as long as we're in our human
[1:21:51] thinking
[1:21:52] we're not going to understand we're not
[1:21:54] going to get the benefit of what let's
[1:21:57] go on to Perfection means or even the
[1:22:00] availability of the Perfection unless we
[1:22:02] understand what he's saying here so in
[1:22:04] the second chapter Paul is very careful
[1:22:07] and you can take the time to look at it
[1:22:09] but let's just read let's just read
[1:22:11] verse well let's let's start it at verse
[1:22:14] 7 because Paul is dealing with man and
[1:22:17] the promise that man was given that he
[1:22:19] would be have dominion over everything
[1:22:21] but watch this he says and now mate is
[1:22:24] him talking about man he's quoting the
[1:22:26] scripture Thou made us him a little
[1:22:28] lower than the Angels thou Crown as him
[1:22:30] with glory and honor and and to set him
[1:22:32] over the works of thy hands he's talking
[1:22:34] this is a direct scripture out of the
[1:22:37] Old Testament and talking about the
[1:22:38] promise of man thou has put all things
[1:22:40] in subjection under his feet for him
[1:22:43] that he put all in subjection under him
[1:22:44] he left nothing that is not put in
[1:22:47] subject put under him but watch this but
[1:22:50] now
[1:22:51] we don't see all things put under him
[1:22:54] that's
[1:22:56] but
[1:22:57] we see Jesus
[1:23:00] because Jesus was the Fulfillment
[1:23:03] of that
[1:23:05] and the ones that her part of him watch
[1:23:07] he says but we see Jesus who was made a
[1:23:09] little lower than the angels for the
[1:23:11] suffering of death crown with Glory and
[1:23:12] Honor that he by the grace of God should
[1:23:15] taste death for every man for it became
[1:23:18] him for whom are all things and by whom
[1:23:21] are all things and bringing many sons
[1:23:25] bringing many sons into the same
[1:23:29] condition that was produced in his
[1:23:32] resurrection
[1:23:34] not our goal is not to walk the shores
[1:23:38] of Galilee like Jesus
[1:23:40] our goal is the Resurrection Life that
[1:23:45] he expressed amen amen amen and so he
[1:23:48] says in bringing many sons in the glory
[1:23:50] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:23:51] perfect through sufferings for both he
[1:23:54] that sanctifieth and they who are
[1:23:56] Sanctified are all of One
[1:23:59] we're all the same
[1:24:03] it is it sometimes it breaks my heart
[1:24:06] I was at a Minister's meeting and a
[1:24:08] brother stood up and and I and I and I
[1:24:11] don't you know I'm just again I'm saying
[1:24:14] what I see but her brother stood up
[1:24:16] ministers
[1:24:18] and he says our goal is Adam
[1:24:21] well I'm sorry my goal is not Adam
[1:24:25] I didn't come from Adam I came from God
[1:24:28] right I am part of the logos word that
[1:24:31] made to Creation
[1:24:32] I'm not part of the creation I am part
[1:24:35] of the one who made the creation
[1:24:38] and so you go back to you go back and
[1:24:40] and it's interesting because the prophet
[1:24:42] in Christ the mystery God revealed 34
[1:24:44] times he said we're going back to Eden
[1:24:48] so the question for the bride is what
[1:24:51] part of the Eden relationship are you
[1:24:54] because that's that's where we'll get
[1:24:56] into it tomorrow the Melchizedek thought
[1:24:59] who is this Melchizedek because you
[1:25:01] can't have
[1:25:02] I wish I could just go but what we're
[1:25:04] not we're gonna we're gonna hold it back
[1:25:06] we're gonna we're gonna hold it back but
[1:25:07] in the in the garden
[1:25:10] well I know the serpent was there let's
[1:25:12] forget about that okay for a minute
[1:25:14] here's God here's Adam
[1:25:17] all right the question is is who are you
[1:25:20] what what part of this relationship are
[1:25:23] you
[1:25:23] because you know our goal is New
[1:25:27] Jerusalem so we're all the way over here
[1:25:29] New Jerusalem and now we see a city
[1:25:32] and we see Kings of the Earth
[1:25:34] that's it
[1:25:35] and the kings of the Earth come and
[1:25:37] bring their Glory
[1:25:39] to the city
[1:25:41] and Adam
[1:25:43] would bring his glory
[1:25:45] to God in the garden
[1:25:49] so Adam's race is outside the city
[1:25:53] the bride is not Adam's race
[1:25:57] so think if we if we had a real
[1:25:59] revelation of our source think what that
[1:26:02] would do to us
[1:26:05] a real genuine revelation of who we are
[1:26:08] what it would do to us because
[1:26:10] Revelations 5 would say I am a king and
[1:26:13] a priest
[1:26:14] and I'm not a king and a priest when
[1:26:16] brother Paul preached on Sunday and then
[1:26:18] the next day I go out and say oh no what
[1:26:20] am I going to do I don't even know what
[1:26:21] to do I have the money the Son of God
[1:26:23] you're not even you don't have a
[1:26:24] revelation
[1:26:26] you're just amending something that was
[1:26:28] said in the word
[1:26:29] but you don't have a real revelation
[1:26:32] you're just you're just saying okay the
[1:26:34] seals are open but they're not open to
[1:26:36] you
[1:26:37] right you may have doctrines you may
[1:26:40] have thoughts of horse riders you may
[1:26:42] have you may have everything completely
[1:26:44] perfectly right in your Doctrine
[1:26:47] and Paul says you can have all knowledge
[1:26:50] and if you don't have the person of
[1:26:52] Christ that's it it doesn't it doesn't
[1:26:54] matter
[1:26:56] and so what Paul is doing in this second
[1:26:58] chapter he's he's identifying this he's
[1:27:02] identifying this Resurrection Life and
[1:27:05] now he's tying us right into that amen
[1:27:08] and so whatever he is you are
[1:27:12] and you look at these scriptures in the
[1:27:14] Old Testament especially you know where
[1:27:15] it's dealing with Messiah it's dealing
[1:27:18] with God and how he dealt with and you
[1:27:20] think oh that's God that's God way out
[1:27:22] here
[1:27:23] but you're the habitation of God
[1:27:27] and so you did those things you were
[1:27:30] there amen the prophet said you know he
[1:27:34] asked job were you where were you when
[1:27:36] the sons of God shouted the Morning Star
[1:27:38] Shadow for joy and the prophet said I
[1:27:41] was there
[1:27:43] I was there I'm part of that not
[1:27:45] pre-existence of sold but pre-existence
[1:27:47] of life
[1:27:49] right we're part of him
[1:27:52] and you know what you know what you know
[1:27:54] what Brother David I'll use this example
[1:27:56] and I know you don't even know me that
[1:27:58] well but I know you love me because I
[1:27:59] love you Dave
[1:28:01] David you and I grew up in different
[1:28:04] backgrounds I don't even know your
[1:28:05] background
[1:28:06] right I grew up in Florida but I have a
[1:28:09] memory I I like to use this one I don't
[1:28:11] know why this one just but I was like
[1:28:13] three or four years old and I'm in
[1:28:15] Wappinger Falls New York
[1:28:17] anybody ever been there
[1:28:20] and we lived in a trailer park my dad
[1:28:22] was going to IBM School
[1:28:24] and and and I was remember I remember
[1:28:26] there was a big giant field of grass
[1:28:29] behind our you know and and they had
[1:28:32] just mowed it and I can remember running
[1:28:34] out there you know it's smelling that
[1:28:35] grass and every time just about every
[1:28:38] time I smoke cut grass I think of that
[1:28:40] memory well now I can say Brother David
[1:28:42] I'm telling you this memory and then
[1:28:44] you'll say well that's that's pretty
[1:28:46] cool because I have a similar memory to
[1:28:48] that you know I mean I had something
[1:28:49] that happened when but that's your
[1:28:51] memory
[1:28:53] see you don't really have my memory
[1:28:55] you're just using your memory to try to
[1:28:57] identify with me but what would happen
[1:28:59] if I gave you my spirit
[1:29:02] then you would have my memory
[1:29:06] and God has what what kind of limit can
[1:29:10] spirit of God in us
[1:29:12] because he experienced he he formed
[1:29:15] himself into word and he's forming
[1:29:17] himself into word again in this hour
[1:29:20] amen amen
[1:29:22] amen so so let's let's move on just just
[1:29:25] give me
[1:29:27] give me give me another hour okay
[1:29:31] not but but let's let's get over to
[1:29:34] let's get over to chapter four now watch
[1:29:36] this progression now because he's he's
[1:29:39] he's identified that we are dealing with
[1:29:43] the resurrected Life of Christ amen okay
[1:29:45] that is a life that is not has nothing
[1:29:48] to do with sin that is the life that was
[1:29:51] revealed by the removal of sin that's
[1:29:54] right and so now he's going to get into
[1:29:57] something very interesting which is
[1:29:58] almost I can't even hardly preach a
[1:30:01] message without talking about the rest
[1:30:03] of God
[1:30:05] because because God's rest we have this
[1:30:09] view okay God created everything and
[1:30:11] we'll go back to our illustration here
[1:30:13] he created everything and he looked at
[1:30:16] all of this and he said this is very
[1:30:18] good
[1:30:19] and then we have the image that he sat
[1:30:22] down
[1:30:23] oh that's really nice said
[1:30:26] I'm going to rest up because I'm really
[1:30:28] tired I made the whole universe it's 93
[1:30:30] billion light years across I'm a little
[1:30:33] wore out
[1:30:34] but that wasn't God's rest
[1:30:36] because God's rest
[1:30:39] was when he stepped into this creation
[1:30:43] and he walked without him
[1:30:45] and so when Paul says in verse 1 let us
[1:30:49] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[1:30:52] us of entering into his rest
[1:30:56] that's it okay this this word rest
[1:30:59] taking it back to the Old Testament it's
[1:31:02] not Sabbath Sabbath okay we think rest
[1:31:05] Sabbath rest Sabbath but this word rest
[1:31:07] and if you follow that word through the
[1:31:09] through the Old Testament even the
[1:31:11] scripture brother Branham uses for the
[1:31:13] rest that was distributed on the day of
[1:31:16] Pentecost where it says with stammering
[1:31:17] lips in another tongue will I speak to
[1:31:19] the people and this is the rest that
[1:31:22] word is not Sabbath that word is not now
[1:31:26] look at the word that's what the prophet
[1:31:28] said in future homes sometimes you have
[1:31:30] to follow these words
[1:31:32] the Sabbath means to cease from works
[1:31:35] the Sabbath means God would sit down but
[1:31:38] God's rest is the word Manuka is
[1:31:42] actually you know in this in in Psalms
[1:31:44] 22 where it said he leave me beside the
[1:31:47] Still Waters the word still there is the
[1:31:50] same word as rest
[1:31:51] okay and so rest is actually that Psalms
[1:31:56] 23 I think it is Psalms 23 and verse 2
[1:31:59] describes what that rest is because it's
[1:32:02] actually the word means that the
[1:32:04] shepherd has taken the flock to a place
[1:32:08] where they can feed and be satisfied
[1:32:11] that's the rest so the rest for God is
[1:32:15] the satisfaction
[1:32:17] of his own stepping into creation and
[1:32:21] taking care of his own creation and so
[1:32:24] Paul is telling you because he started
[1:32:26] in the in the first chapter
[1:32:28] laying the foundation of this and and
[1:32:31] and tying our life in with the life of
[1:32:34] the resurrected Christ now he's saying
[1:32:36] don't fail
[1:32:39] to enter into God's rest
[1:32:42] okay because God's rest listen God's
[1:32:46] rest
[1:32:47] look let's put it this way all creation
[1:32:50] is groaning and travailing waiting for
[1:32:53] God's rest
[1:32:55] they're waiting for a manifestation of
[1:32:58] sons because you are the outlet of God
[1:33:03] you are the branches of the tree of life
[1:33:06] if if anybody comes oh wow if anybody
[1:33:11] comes to God they're going to come to
[1:33:14] you
[1:33:16] and you're going to bear fruit for them
[1:33:19] amen not for yourself
[1:33:22] for them but you know the good thing the
[1:33:24] wonderful thing is we get to eat at
[1:33:27] first
[1:33:28] because the life flows through us and
[1:33:31] it's wonderful Fellowship that we have
[1:33:33] with the with the Life of Christ but
[1:33:37] it's
[1:33:37] living for others
[1:33:40] your life is for others
[1:33:45] that's what we'll get into tomorrow in
[1:33:46] this priesthood so Paul is telling you
[1:33:48] let us therefore fear lest the promise
[1:33:51] being left us if any of of of any of us
[1:33:54] being left us of entering into his rest
[1:33:57] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:33:59] it
[1:34:00] so whatever you do
[1:34:02] look I and we preached on it somewhere I
[1:34:06] remember I think it was it at brother
[1:34:08] David's on on Sunday morning but my
[1:34:11] favorite scripture in the entire Bible
[1:34:13] is first Timothy 1 and verse 5.
[1:34:16] and it says the end of the Commandment
[1:34:17] is Charity out of a pure heart
[1:34:21] okay the end of all the teaching
[1:34:23] the end of all the exposure
[1:34:26] of the word of God to us
[1:34:29] should produce the Life of Christ amen
[1:34:32] and if it doesn't I don't care how about
[1:34:34] your doctrines
[1:34:36] because it's the Life of Christ and now
[1:34:40] that in the book of Hebrews is becoming
[1:34:43] the focus whatever God's desire is
[1:34:48] that is reflected in you because you
[1:34:51] have the spirit of God and if God's
[1:34:54] desire is to fellowship with his
[1:34:56] creation
[1:34:57] then guess what
[1:34:59] you're not about condemning people
[1:35:02] you're about offering them fruit
[1:35:05] s and you and you don't have no choice
[1:35:07] of what they do with it
[1:35:09] you know I've been in I've been a lot of
[1:35:12] apple orchards and things and those
[1:35:14] trees are like here take the fruit
[1:35:16] here I got some low hanging stuff that's
[1:35:18] pretty good you know and it and and
[1:35:21] maybe you take that apple or maybe you
[1:35:24] don't take that apple and that's what
[1:35:25] people do
[1:35:27] but we're so results driven oh well God
[1:35:29] didn't amuse me because nobody took my
[1:35:31] apples today it don't matter
[1:35:34] it doesn't matter all your
[1:35:36] responsibility is to Bear the fruit
[1:35:39] and God will take care of the results he
[1:35:41] wants to do and so this whole thing and
[1:35:44] we'll and we'll just close with this
[1:35:45] statement
[1:35:46] and we'll pick it up tomorrow morning
[1:35:48] but this whole thing is a foundation the
[1:35:52] whole rest the whole Resurrection Life
[1:35:54] of Christ Paul's Association of us with
[1:35:58] that Resurrection life because we came
[1:36:01] from that we're a part of that and then
[1:36:03] he talks about God's rest which is a
[1:36:05] beautiful subject and would take hours
[1:36:07] to go through it ourself and then he
[1:36:09] comes therefore leaving the principles
[1:36:12] of the doctrines of Christ
[1:36:14] let's go on to Perfection and you know
[1:36:17] what I got I got a quote here that we'll
[1:36:20] read Because listen to what brother
[1:36:21] Branham says
[1:36:24] I think if this is the one
[1:36:27] yeah he says he said now watch what he
[1:36:29] says this is from Hebrews chapter 5 and
[1:36:31] 6 part one he says he says we have now
[1:36:36] you the Branham Tabernacle oh I know
[1:36:38] does anybody ever tape any quotes in
[1:36:40] their Bibles
[1:36:41] I mean I got them all over my Bible
[1:36:44] you know I mean but he says now you're
[1:36:47] at the Branham Tabernacle oh I know we
[1:36:49] have healings that's wonderful
[1:36:51] we have visions that's fine you have
[1:36:54] spiritual dreams sometimes they're not
[1:36:55] spiritual dreams and sometimes you we
[1:36:58] try to help the poor and we do what we
[1:37:01] can oh that's all right but that's not
[1:37:04] what we're talking about now
[1:37:06] he said we're entering into another
[1:37:09] phase
[1:37:11] we're entering into another phase
[1:37:12] leaving the doctrine oh yes we got
[1:37:15] Doctrine under Christ we believe he was
[1:37:16] the son of God virgin born we believe
[1:37:18] that with all these things that's just
[1:37:20] wonderful but leaving let's go on to
[1:37:22] Perfection oh my I wish I had the voice
[1:37:24] of an archangel to bring this to a place
[1:37:27] where you could see it now he says
[1:37:28] leaving all the doctrine of Christ all
[1:37:31] the theolog the theologians all the
[1:37:33] theology that we know listen to this all
[1:37:37] about the deity of Christ how he was God
[1:37:39] made flesh all these other things we're
[1:37:41] leaving that amen
[1:37:43] okay because we're coming to a different
[1:37:46] perspective
[1:37:47] we're not now for a new believer for
[1:37:50] people out on the street we preach the
[1:37:52] cross we have to preach the cross but
[1:37:55] we're dealing with the people that are
[1:37:57] eating the book let's take a different
[1:37:59] perspective let's look at something
[1:38:01] different let's let this let's not okay
[1:38:04] I'm redeemed hallelujah what does that
[1:38:06] mean
[1:38:07] it means that you have been put put back
[1:38:10] on an original condition before sin ever
[1:38:13] happened and although we still make
[1:38:16] mistakes and I'm not saying any but our
[1:38:19] Revelation says that is not me
[1:38:24] we have a different perspective and
[1:38:26] that's what that's what let me finish
[1:38:28] reading this let's see Paul goes on he
[1:38:31] said he said Paul goes on to explain it
[1:38:33] all just in a few minutes let's read it
[1:38:34] just a little bit we have laying again
[1:38:36] the foundation repentance from dead
[1:38:38] works now we believe that Faith toward
[1:38:40] God we believe that doctrine of baptism
[1:38:42] now we just must be baptized we believe
[1:38:44] that and if laying on our hands we
[1:38:46] believe in in laying on hands don't we
[1:38:49] all that sure the Resurrection The Dead
[1:38:51] all that
[1:38:52] but he said we're leaving that
[1:38:55] now it was necessary
[1:38:57] if you give me a minute I'm going to
[1:38:58] share that analogy I use with the with
[1:39:01] the because in in First Corinthians 13
[1:39:04] it says it says when that which is
[1:39:07] perfect just comes that which is in part
[1:39:09] is done away and I had a and I had a man
[1:39:11] that I know he's not a message believer
[1:39:14] but I believe in him he's got an
[1:39:16] election
[1:39:17] all right we have amazing Fellowship
[1:39:20] you know and I've told him about the
[1:39:21] prophet and he's not really interested
[1:39:23] in embracing that but we still have
[1:39:25] Fellowship
[1:39:26] and What attracted me to this man he
[1:39:29] sent he sent an email to the church and
[1:39:31] he says I want to preach the gospel in
[1:39:33] places where it's never been
[1:39:36] how many people sitting here
[1:39:38] have that because you the places where
[1:39:40] it's never been you may not want to go
[1:39:44] but this man did and so what attracted
[1:39:46] me to him and and he began calling me
[1:39:49] and we would have prayer together so he
[1:39:51] sends me a text one day a couple of
[1:39:53] months ago
[1:39:54] and he says from the stand he says I'm
[1:39:56] reading here in First Corinthians 13.
[1:39:59] and it says were there prophecies they
[1:40:01] shall fail whether there's knowledge it
[1:40:03] shall vanish away
[1:40:05] and he says brother he says I study all
[1:40:07] the time
[1:40:08] he said what
[1:40:10] why am I studying if it's all going to
[1:40:12] vanish away
[1:40:14] and it said his name's Ricky and I don't
[1:40:16] hold that against him
[1:40:17] but when I said brother Ricky it's just
[1:40:19] like it's like this
[1:40:21] I said let's say let's say that you're
[1:40:23] that you want to build this church
[1:40:25] okay and you and and you you buy this
[1:40:28] piece of property
[1:40:29] and you get a set of plans on it and the
[1:40:31] plan is say Grace Church
[1:40:33] on there so you know okay this is going
[1:40:35] to be a church this is cool this is
[1:40:36] where we're gonna you know and we all
[1:40:38] helped design the church and everything
[1:40:40] it's going to be just right so we're
[1:40:41] going to put the walls up we're going to
[1:40:43] pour the floor first to put the plumbing
[1:40:45] in you know and all the stuff and then
[1:40:46] you I was in construction you know I was
[1:40:48] involved in all that stuff you put the
[1:40:50] walls up and then you you put the roof
[1:40:52] on and then you dry it in and you put
[1:40:54] the finishes on the inside and
[1:40:56] everything and then you
[1:40:58] and then you move in
[1:41:01] and now it's the are we are we like
[1:41:05] tonight are we saying
[1:41:07] those are nice looking walls
[1:41:11] man that floor look it's man it's a
[1:41:14] solid good floor no we're using the
[1:41:18] building for its purpose
[1:41:20] and so the purpose
