[43:18] families that your parents are not
[43:20] Believers one of the greatest
[43:23] testimonies that can ever be projected
[43:26] about what God has done in your life is
[43:29] your love and respect to your parents

[43:35] revealed to you we just live it and let
[43:38] that light shine you know and we don't

[43:43] bulb we want to be that thousand watt
[43:47] hogen amen that lights up everything
[43:50] around us amen remember our sister Sue
[43:54] today you know sister Sue just just so
[43:57] Faithful driving traveling those miles
[44:00] the weather is not always conducive and
[44:03] and uh sister Sue won't like me for
[44:05] saying this but she is getting older and
[44:08] we know as you get older um we just get
[44:13] smarter remember that sister Sue I said
[44:16] you're
[44:16] smarter uh and to be that we would drive
[44:20] through a a blizzard for a
[44:24] pizza and can't get out of the house
[44:26] when we get older for a skiff and uh so
[44:29] just remember sister Sue sister April
[44:32] she's been uh you know Saints and I hope
[44:35] sister April don't mind that I say this
[44:37] I just feel compelled to
[44:41] um sister April if God would just open
[44:45] the door as it were would be sitting in
[44:47] church this morning it's not for lack of
[44:49] Desire it's not for uh lack of
[44:52] sincerity um I haven't heard the full
[44:55] report I don't know some may have heard
[44:57] some of the report but um she just has
[45:00] incredible burden and uh her job is
[45:03] demanding and when she takes the time
[45:06] they demand it returned and so those
[45:10] schedules you know uh I have many a time
[45:13] in the past been irrigating on a Sunday
[45:17] morning and when I got the point of no
[45:19] return you might say I just walked away
[45:23] from it but I don't think somebody
[45:25] laying on the op printing table want
[45:26] sister April just to say church starts
[45:29] in 20 minutes I'll catch you when church
[45:31] is out so just remember our sister April
[45:34] you know if the devil would put any
[45:36] question in your heart just remember I
[45:38] stand as a witness of her sincerity of
[45:41] this message and of the gospel and the
[45:43] life that she lives my sister Susan
[45:45] please remember her back and brother
[45:48] Titus not here today uh not feeling well
[45:51] amen so we want to remember all those
[45:54] that wouldn't be here today and I I'm
[45:56] going to this is a very broad thing and
[45:58] and I I I just need to put this out in
[46:00] such a way that sometimes respecting the
[46:04] individual but wanting to acknowledge
[46:07] the need leaves us you know we kind of
[46:10] sometimes have this joke about uh what's
[46:12] so
[46:13] special spoken but sometimes Saints um
[46:17] for the respect of the
[46:19] individuals uh we need to especially in
[46:23] in you might say delicate situations
[46:26] we need to just lift it up we don't
[46:28] always have to know the issue we don't
[46:30] always have to know the name what we do
[46:32] know is that we serve a god that is a
[46:35] prayer answering God that is a god that
[46:38] is here and says I will shake heaven and
[46:42] Earth for you and if he'll do it for you
[46:45] he will do it for them amen and he knows
[46:48] the need and we have several very very
[46:53] uh unspoken but very special needs and
[46:58] it's not just uh it is in our young
[47:00] people my brother and sister uh we want
[47:03] to see our young people saved can we say
[47:05] amen and we want to see our families
[47:08] saved we want to see restoration come in
[47:10] our families we want to see rebellious
[47:13] Spirits broken amen and we want to see
[47:16] the spirit of Christ filled in amen and
[47:19] and we should be standing there and
[47:21] holding fervent to that that Lord I want
[47:24] to see you come on the scene and I'm
[47:26] willing to do my part and lift them to
[47:28] the
[47:29] throne and just remember there's young
[47:32] families that have very very dire needs
[47:34] and young people with many very dire
[47:37] needs amen and let's remember those in
[47:41] prayer amen that we not just become
[47:45] slack uh that we don't become just like
[47:48] well I I don't know what's going on but
[47:50] we need to just hold them up let's just
[47:53] take a moment and lift a hand and just
[47:55] ask the Lord to come down Heavenly
[47:58] Father Lord you know every unspoken need
[48:02] father you know the needs of my life my
[48:05] insecurities Lord you know the needs and
[48:08] insecurities of every individual and
[48:11] Lord we just want to send your Holy
[48:13] Spirit out today Father Lord for those
[48:16] you know the ones on our hearts Lord
[48:18] Jesus and we're asking you to go out to
[48:20] young men and young women father
[48:23] confirming yourself in their hearts Lord
[48:26] confirming father who they are and where
[48:29] they stand in your economy Lord just ask
[48:32] you to come and deal mightily father
[48:35] there's churches father that have been
[48:37] slipping in the rung and we ask you
[48:39] father to go out and give them Father a
[48:42] backbone to stand for the word Lord let
[48:45] them not find off fence but let them
[48:46] find you father Lord we just ask you for
[48:50] guidance today in the name of Jesus
[48:52] Christ amen and amen Hallelujah we'll
[48:56] turn I want to talk to you once again
[48:58] amen kind of the contrast of two Natures
[49:02] if we would just turn in our Bibles
[49:04] today uh we want to talk on the power of
[49:07] Prophecy now my brother and sister we
[49:10] must
[49:12] realize that prophecy holds the key to
[49:16] every one of our lives every aspect of
[49:18] every one of our lives and you say
[49:20] brother Paul uh how do you mean that
[49:22] prophecy holds that well I want you to
[49:25] understand that every word that come
[49:27] from the mouth of God is prophecy he's
[49:30] actually declaring what is and what will
[49:33] to uh come amen what is to be and so as
[49:38] he speaks that my brother and sister we
[49:40] realize that this is God declaring this
[49:44] is not a hope God's not saying I hope
[49:47] this happens that would not be prophecy
[49:50] but when God declares right now what we
[49:53] have to do is understand and
[49:57] under never
[50:00] underestimate the context of the words
[50:02] that's being
[50:05] spoken amen we read it and we read right
[50:10] on to the next verse and we don't
[50:11] realize contained in that verse right
[50:13] there is such power to shake heaven and
[50:18] earth power to rest as in wrestle rest
[50:23] those Souls that the devil thought he
[50:26] had put his mark on and to pull them
[50:29] right back to the position I remember
[50:32] one time brother Tim puit sharing a
[50:34] testimony of they were having a service
[50:37] and there was a young young sister I
[50:40] think about 15 years old 16 years old
[50:43] and she comes in the prayer line and her
[50:46] prayer was I want to see my brother
[50:53] saved now my brother and sister this
[50:55] young young lady was sincere she she had
[50:58] come into a state of desperation for her
[51:04] brother she didn't sit back and say well
[51:06] if it be God's
[51:08] will she stepped forward and said I want
[51:12] to see my brother saved and her brother
[51:15] who had got caught up in alcohol and
[51:17] drugs was in living in the parents home
[51:19] I believe I could be mistaken on that
[51:21] but anyway wherever he called home he
[51:23] was in bed and he was stirred out of bed
[51:28] and he got up and he shows up at the
[51:31] altar at the church in his
[51:35] pajamas come on don't tell me God don't
[51:38] move God's got power to shake heaven and
[51:41] earth amen and that young man repented
[51:44] gave his heart to the Lord amen God
[51:46] healed him from his addictions and put
[51:49] it and as brother Tim shares that
[51:51] testimony he still serving God today
[51:56] not a temporary
[51:57] salvation amen I like how brother Danny
[52:00] steeman says we don't need to save them
[52:03] again just get them saved the first time
[52:06] we don't need to try and save them again
[52:07] and again hallelujah hallelujah excuse
[52:11] me if I get excited today Isaiah 55: 6
[52:18] through1
[52:20] 13 is it good to be in the house of the
[52:22] Lord
[52:23] today you know you can't even go into a
[52:26] store already the Christmas music is
[52:30] playing and uh one of them I just heard
[52:33] yesterday when we were in Home Depot the
[52:36] weather outside is
[52:39] frightful well I don't care how
[52:40] frightful it is the Sun's shining on the
[52:43] inside
[52:45] hallelujah
[52:47] amen seek ye the Lord while he may be
[52:52] found call ye upon him while he is near
[52:55] here now if we believe the word of
[52:57] Isaiah is present T my brother and
[53:00] sister that means he's here this morning
[53:03] amen yes and he can be found this
[53:06] morning let the wicked forsake his way
[53:09] and the unrighteous man his thoughts
[53:12] because remember the thoughts become
[53:14] Deeds that's right amen and let him
[53:17] return unto the Lord and He will have
[53:19] mercy upon him and to our God for he
[53:22] will abundantly pardon amen for my
[53:25] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[53:28] are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord
[53:32] for as the heavens are higher than the
[53:34] earth so are my ways higher than your
[53:37] ways and my thoughts than your
[53:40] thoughts now I want to just interject
[53:43] this right here your thoughts might be
[53:44] good thoughts your thoughts may be
[53:47] thoughts on the goodness of God of all
[53:50] the virtues that he's poured out and his
[53:53] thoughts still higher
[53:56] than your
[53:57] thought we are the limiting factor I
[54:01] lift a hand and say Lord don't let me be
[54:03] the limiting factor let my faith rise up
[54:06] not to be my faith see often times we
[54:09] talk about my faith oh I have faith I'm
[54:12] sorry you really don't have faith we
[54:15] don't want our faith we want God's faith
[54:18] so what we got to do is say Lord I do
[54:21] believe and in my heart I do but I'm
[54:24] going to let go of how I view this and
[54:27] I'm going to reach up Lord and by your
[54:30] grace take a hold of your thoughts am
[54:34] it'll change our world it will change
[54:37] our world Amen that's right for as the
[54:40] rain cometh down in the snow from heaven
[54:43] and returneth not thither but WTH the
[54:46] Earth and make it bring forth in Bud
[54:48] that it may give seed to the S and bread
[54:52] to the
[54:54] eater so shall my word be now this is a
[54:57] very key scripture this morning so shall
[55:02] my word be that goeth forth out of my
[55:04] mouth this is God
[55:06] speaking it shall not can we say that it
[55:10] shall not return unto me void but it
[55:15] shall accomplish that which I please and
[55:18] it shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[55:21] sented amen you see now my brother and
[55:24] sister Isaiah 55 And1 just took it out
[55:27] of your hands
[55:29] amen
[55:30] amen you don't need to say well if I and
[55:33] if I can and if it should be or if it be
[55:37] God's
[55:38] will God said it it can not return void
[55:50] amen hallelujah got a lot of things I
[55:53] want to say here but I got too much to
[55:54] say so amen for ye shall go out with joy
[56:00] yes sir not sadness not
[56:02] sorrow not your head hanging down your
[56:04] shoulders
[56:07] slumped and be led forth with peace and
[56:09] the mountains and the hills shall Break
[56:11] Forth before you into singing and all
[56:14] the trees of the field shall clap their
[56:15] hands hallu I just want to put it this
[56:18] way I know this applies to many more but
[56:21] I'll tell you what I just want to ask
[56:23] Sister Sarah
[56:26] just want to ask you a question Sister
[56:29] Sarah do the hills Break Forth in
[56:35] singing I know they do because she has
[56:39] shared the beauty there's something
[56:42] there oh Lord my God amen
[56:47] amen when I in awesome Wonder
[56:52] yes consider all yes
[56:56] The Works the worlds thy hands have
[57:02] made and all the trees of the field
[57:04] shall clap their hands instead of the
[57:06] thorn shall come up the fur tree and
[57:08] instead of the Brier shall come up the
[57:10] Myrtle tree and as shall be to the Lord
[57:13] for a name for an everlasting sign that
[57:16] shall not be cut off amen Heavenly
[57:20] Father we ask you to bless the word
[57:22] today lead us guide us strengthen us
[57:25] father Lord for you are our substance
[57:28] and you are our very life and we thank
[57:30] you for that Lord guide us I pray in the
[57:33] name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[57:36] seated
[57:45] Saints somebody about now say a prayer
[57:48] Lord keep brother Paul
[57:51] focused
[57:53] amen
[57:55] the Lord speaking through Isaiah isn't
[57:57] Isaiah such a
[57:59] wonderful prophecy that has been given
[58:01] to us it's just so incredible everything
[58:04] that God dealt through Isaiah uh I
[58:07] believe is just applicable right to our
[58:10] day it is such a a a very deep uh
[58:16] uh word that that come forth amen and as
[58:21] he's speaking sharing these things that
[58:23] God's dealing with him he lays out all
[58:25] through the book of Isaiah uh he lays
[58:28] out very clear and understandable
[58:32] guidelines you might say guidance to us
[58:34] and amen I love this it's very clear
[58:38] that the word cannot return void that's
[58:41] right and if we had no other Revelation
[58:44] or something to take home today if we
[58:47] just took home the simple fact that the
[58:50] word cannot return void then as we are
[58:53] living life day by day we would realize
[58:57] that what God has spoken is applicable
[59:00] in this moment right here the word for
[59:03] this moment is not going to return void
[59:06] so whatever is happening in my life if
[59:09] I'm in the word and the word is in me
[59:11] I'm holding on for dear life it can't
[59:14] return void there's no scribbling across
[59:16] the fa face Return to Sender my brother
[59:20] and sister so it's there that we have to
[59:23] catch that revelation yes amen that what
[59:26] God said about us and and I'll get ahead
[59:28] of myself but let me just throw this
[59:30] little quip out here that it is my
[59:33] brother and sister that we are coming
[59:35] these certain signs that we see in the
[59:38] world we live in today uh these certain
[59:41] things that somebody the other day just
[59:43] voiced how is it that all of a sudden
[59:45] one day it's not there the next day we
[59:48] wake up and we have Identity or gender
[59:50] problems and we have all kinds of these
[59:53] problems and that problems and suddenly
[59:55] it's though as it rose out of nowhere
[59:58] well I'll tell you why it rose out of
[1:00:00] nowhere the devil looked down and saw a
[1:00:03] bride who identity is being revealed and
[1:00:08] he said wait I need to confuse identity
[1:00:12] and so it's here that if he can't
[1:00:14] confuse a bride in her identity then
[1:00:17] he's just going to confuse a world in
[1:00:19] their identity because after all he
[1:00:21] doesn't know out there who is seed and
[1:00:23] not and so he just wants to confuse
[1:00:25] identity we could go on down that
[1:00:28] channel naming many things that are
[1:00:30] relevant of the day that we live in and
[1:00:32] how these things coming up my brother
[1:00:34] and sister are not just random this is
[1:00:37] Satan I like this can someone say Amen
[1:00:40] before you even hear it hallelujah amen
[1:00:43] I like this the devil is responding to
[1:00:47] us we are not responding to the devil
[1:00:51] amen as it is said we have the answer to
[1:00:54] the Devil's question and the devil's out
[1:00:56] here saying I got to preempt this
[1:00:58] because these people are starting to
[1:01:01] recognize who they are and I need to
[1:01:05] confuse the water because if the world
[1:01:07] catches a revelation that Christ is back
[1:01:10] in human flesh again then I've lost and
[1:01:14] he's a sore loser he doesn't give up
[1:01:16] easy he keeps fighting but what he
[1:01:19] doesn't like oh is the fact he's
[1:01:21] responding brother Trevor to Christ in
[1:01:24] you
[1:01:25] amen not you responding to him in you
[1:01:28] but it's Christ in you and he feels like
[1:01:31] he's got to put up a defense and the
[1:01:34] prophet of God showed us clearly you
[1:01:36] don't let yourself try to defend you
[1:01:39] don't stand up and say well praise God
[1:01:40] I'm a Christian I'm going to defend
[1:01:42] myself we run under the blood he's our
[1:01:45] defense he's what we need and without
[1:01:48] him we're
[1:01:50] defenseless oh we can't live a day
[1:01:52] without him Saints and I'm just going to
[1:01:55] speak this a little bold maybe a little
[1:01:56] blunt you know the days you walked out
[1:01:59] the door without him that's right you
[1:02:01] can't forget them very quickly because
[1:02:04] the devil slaps you around throws things
[1:02:07] in your mind throws things in your way
[1:02:09] our patience just gets dropped on a
[1:02:11] sidewalk somewhere all kinds of little
[1:02:13] factors and we know I've got to stop
[1:02:16] I've got to get back in his presence
[1:02:18] I've got to get back under that blood
[1:02:20] because the devil's
[1:02:21] Relentless and he wouldn't be relentless
[1:02:24] and L he saw something in you
[1:02:27] amen that's it he's brutal
[1:02:29] though the man
[1:02:32] addicted
[1:02:34] alcoholic Satan doesn't just tear his
[1:02:36] life
[1:02:38] down he keeps him tore
[1:02:42] down come on Amen
[1:02:47] right
[1:02:48] Bankers in New
[1:02:51] York on Skid
[1:02:53] Row
[1:02:54] once had everything they desired to lay
[1:02:57] their hands
[1:02:58] on and in a short while find themselves
[1:03:01] sleeping over a radiator vent in an
[1:03:05] alley
[1:03:08] skidrow how can that happen because
[1:03:11] money and influence and power is not our
[1:03:14] answer the blood is
[1:03:18] hallelujah amen so this word spoken must
[1:03:21] come to pass now if we was to take the
[1:03:23] time I I I don't know if In Our Lifetime
[1:03:26] we could actually digest the whole Bible
[1:03:28] to digest every scripture of every word
[1:03:31] of God that's been spoken concerning the
[1:03:33] bride of Christ I've heard people say
[1:03:36] well I I you know I'm going to live
[1:03:38] every word in this Bible Well they ought
[1:03:40] to put some clarity because not every
[1:03:42] word in this Bible is for you amen some
[1:03:45] of that is giving what it is my brother
[1:03:48] and sister the Judgment or the warning
[1:03:51] to judgment for another people the
[1:03:53] contrast of the two Natures amen God is
[1:03:57] is here and we're not here going to
[1:03:59] spend our life in this church as long as
[1:04:01] I guess I'm Pastor uh uh talking about
[1:04:04] how ugly and mean and watch out for the
[1:04:06] devil no my brother and sister I'm not
[1:04:08] called to watch out for the devil I'm
[1:04:09] called to watch out for Christ amen it
[1:04:12] doesn't give us anywhere that you know
[1:04:14] at the at the coming behold the
[1:04:16] bridegroom cometh to look and Beware of
[1:04:19] the devil amen this is a people no let
[1:04:21] me change that you are a people that has
[1:04:24] already judged yourself and already
[1:04:27] filled amen by the grace of God Amen the
[1:04:31] lamp is full of oil and you're not
[1:04:34] sitting here saying now I'm going to run
[1:04:35] real quick I know where someone's a
[1:04:37] merchant over here you know I can call
[1:04:40] him in any hour of the day and night and
[1:04:42] he'll pray for me that I'll get the Holy
[1:04:44] Ghost no my brother and sister that's
[1:04:45] not how this bride Works she read the
[1:04:47] word and it said something to her heart
[1:04:51] amen not to her intellect but to her
[1:04:52] heart and she said okay if the Lord's
[1:04:55] telling me to get oil I'm going to go
[1:04:56] get oil amen don't you like that
[1:04:59] hallelujah amen uh there's a story just
[1:05:03] popped in my mind it's pretty funny but
[1:05:05] I'll just leave with that but I'll tell
[1:05:07] you just a little word of everyday
[1:05:09] advice if it's winter time you're better
[1:05:11] off to make sure thatth the car is full
[1:05:13] of
[1:05:14] gas yeah you don't need to be out there
[1:05:17] driving around in a
[1:05:19] blizzard with no
[1:05:21] gas makes perfect sense doesn't it yeah
[1:05:25] now we're going to have a little pole
[1:05:27] whose gas tank is below a quarter tank
[1:05:29] this
[1:05:32] morning natural types the
[1:05:38] spiritual I won't go there let me just
[1:05:41] I'm backing
[1:05:43] up I'll move over here get back into my
[1:05:45] thought
[1:05:48] heyen only let me say this if you ever
[1:05:51] run out of gas you've got no one to to
[1:05:54] blame but
[1:05:57] yourself yeah okay it just begs to be
[1:06:00] how many of you ever run out of
[1:06:04] gas wow okay we'll go on to a different
[1:06:07] subject here I I honestly was like no
[1:06:11] nobody's going to raise their hand amen
[1:06:14] so look at this my brother and sister
[1:06:17] every word that is spoken according to
[1:06:20] the word of God must come to pass now
[1:06:24] did he put a quantifier of big prophecy
[1:06:27] medium prophecy or little prophecy
[1:06:30] little issue in your life or big issue
[1:06:32] in your life no every word that is
[1:06:36] spoken must come to pass and so it
[1:06:41] doesn't matter what position you're in
[1:06:43] life is good life is hard you have
[1:06:46] health or you don't have health you have
[1:06:48] money or you don't have money the word
[1:06:50] is the word and it cannot return turn
[1:06:54] void amen people say if my circumstance
[1:06:57] it'd be easier to serve God if my
[1:07:00] circumstance was
[1:07:02] better let me tell you usually
[1:07:05] Prosperity is a hindrance to serving God
[1:07:08] that's right am
[1:07:11] amen yes it is that's right but the
[1:07:16] revealed and if you don't mind I want to
[1:07:17] use the word
[1:07:19] revelated I don't think it's even in the
[1:07:21] dictionary might be maybe I didn't spell
[1:07:24] it
[1:07:25] correctly young people they laugh at me
[1:07:28] when I write on the
[1:07:29] board because they just when they start
[1:07:32] snickering I know I've misspelled it but
[1:07:35] my brother and sister this revealed word
[1:07:38] that has come now a word that is
[1:07:41] revealed I could hold something behind a
[1:07:44] cloth or a veil and open that up and say
[1:07:47] this is now
[1:07:48] revealed but there is a slight
[1:07:52] difference between something revealed
[1:07:55] and something that has been
[1:07:57] revelated revelated is a revelation
[1:08:00] brought to life amen and what we need is
[1:08:03] not just a revelation of a seventh seal
[1:08:05] we hear it all the seventh seal the
[1:08:07] seventh seal seventh seal and I believe
[1:08:09] the seven seal but there's life behind
[1:08:12] the seven seal and what we need is the
[1:08:15] life behind it not just that the seven
[1:08:17] seal had some importance but we need the
[1:08:20] Revelation that comes out of that seal
[1:08:24] amen and when we have that Revelation
[1:08:27] been revelated to us that is the very
[1:08:30] life to a Believer can you say Amen to
[1:08:32] that amen if we just want religion my
[1:08:34] brother and sisters sorry to put it this
[1:08:36] way you want religion let's go be
[1:08:38] Mormons they have baseball teams and
[1:08:39] basketball teams and they have all kinds
[1:08:41] of help programs and they have this and
[1:08:43] they have that and and my brother and
[1:08:45] sister it's wonderful they have their
[1:08:47] own bank they'll loan you
[1:08:49] money want to buy a farm they'll finance
[1:08:52] a farm for youen they
[1:08:54] will sounds like a great religion
[1:08:57] doesn't it but where does it
[1:09:00] fit where does it fit and I'm not being
[1:09:03] CTIC but we have family amen lineage
[1:09:07] that goes back of men relatives now
[1:09:10] becoming more and more distant but
[1:09:12] relatives who hold High positions in the
[1:09:14] Mormon church amen I have no doubt I
[1:09:16] could have piggybacked right on that and
[1:09:18] be somewhat
[1:09:21] important
[1:09:22] wow
[1:09:24] but
[1:09:26] lost does that make us importantly
[1:09:30] lost my brother and sister I don't want
[1:09:32] to be important I don't want to be lost
[1:09:35] I want revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[1:09:37] I want the word to come alive amen so
[1:09:40] look if this word has been spoken can
[1:09:42] can you interact with me today preach
[1:09:44] with me Saints is this word been
[1:09:47] spoken amen if it's been spoken let's
[1:09:50] look for the result that's right not
[1:09:53] even to say is it Vindicated or not it's
[1:09:55] the spoken word let's look for the
[1:09:59] result there's going to be something
[1:10:01] tangible that comes from this spoken
[1:10:03] word and I'm looking out today on some
[1:10:06] people who are the tangible evidence of
[1:10:08] a spoken word not returning
[1:10:11] void oh does that mean you'll never make
[1:10:13] a mistake no we will make a mistake amen
[1:10:17] we get baptized we repent get baptized
[1:10:20] we still make mistakes but what it is is
[1:10:24] as you have now handed the title amen of
[1:10:27] who you are to Jesus Christ and said
[1:10:30] here hold the title of who I
[1:10:34] am you sinned or you had a bad thought
[1:10:37] or a bad reaction or a bad word here's a
[1:10:40] title back tore up don't want you no sir
[1:10:43] he took the title he says you are
[1:10:47] mine and furthermore I can't even see
[1:10:50] what are you talking about what sin are
[1:10:52] you talking talking
[1:10:55] about amen his thoughts much higher than
[1:10:58] our thoughts amen his vision much
[1:11:02] greater than our vision his life is our
[1:11:06] life in an elevated position being
[1:11:09] called to right amen I like I you know
[1:11:14] this is just a denominational preacher a
[1:11:16] little quip thing I saw he saidou notice
[1:11:18] there's a Stairway to Heaven instead of
[1:11:20] an
[1:11:20] elevator that's right it was an elevator
[1:11:25] just any old bu would push the button
[1:11:26] and get that free
[1:11:28] ride but God makes you climb step amen
[1:11:32] by amen step
[1:11:39] amen there's been times in years
[1:11:43] past sister Jerry and I may be
[1:11:46] in somewhat midlife it's fading
[1:11:50] now we'd be somewhere at a building and
[1:11:53] walk walk in and Jerry with a wild look
[1:11:56] in her eye would say let's take the
[1:11:57] stairs and you know it's a bad
[1:12:01] idea but you get this yes let's do it
[1:12:05] and there's people standing at the
[1:12:07] elevator and we beat them to the fifth
[1:12:11] floor only when they stepped out of the
[1:12:13] elevator they saw these two people all
[1:12:20] bedraggled and they thought no doubt
[1:12:23] these people are
[1:12:27] crazy but you see if all we had to do is
[1:12:31] push a button to get to
[1:12:33] heaven everyone would make
[1:12:38] it they would find enough
[1:12:46] energy but God's going to make you
[1:12:49] nobody start crying okay God's going to
[1:12:52] make you
[1:12:54] oh this goes so contrary to our thinking
[1:12:56] so you guys are going to be just like
[1:12:57] wait brother Paul but God's going to
[1:13:00] make you work for it yes sir and we
[1:13:02] don't have a wor gospel that's right but
[1:13:05] he's still going to make you work for it
[1:13:07] he's still going to make you face the
[1:13:09] devil every single day and make the
[1:13:12] decision and as you would say promote
[1:13:15] the action of stepping into the blood
[1:13:18] into the presence of God because there's
[1:13:21] two Natures there and Satan has the
[1:13:24] opportunity to woo you every single day
[1:13:28] and you have the opportunity to reject
[1:13:31] him every single day amen and look at
[1:13:36] this here's the devil offering Jesus
[1:13:39] from the Pinnacle of the temple oh just
[1:13:42] fall down and serve me and all of this
[1:13:44] will be yours and Jesus never voiced
[1:13:47] these thoughts he never said it out loud
[1:13:50] it's already mine amen amen so the devil
[1:13:54] was coming under a false pretense to
[1:13:57] offer something that he couldn't offer
[1:13:59] and what is Satan offering today I'll
[1:14:01] give you life I'll give you life he
[1:14:04] blows up pictures my brother and sister
[1:14:06] I read a very in-depth deal about
[1:14:07] advertising and the subtle demonic
[1:14:11] undercurrent of advertising because they
[1:14:14] understand in an advertisement about
[1:14:16] things that don't even have anything
[1:14:18] relevance they throw in some girl or
[1:14:20] some car or some kind of this or or you
[1:14:23] know images of money and all of these
[1:14:25] things and it's not some accident they
[1:14:28] know the subliminal message and Satan's
[1:14:30] here offering subliminal messages to a
[1:14:33] bride that's already received a message
[1:14:35] she don't need the devil's message she's
[1:14:38] got a message amen and so she is holding
[1:14:41] on to it and she knows by Revelation
[1:14:44] this message will not return void this
[1:14:47] message is going back where it came from
[1:14:50] that's right but the other one is too
[1:14:52] that's exactly right right yes sir I've
[1:14:54] never had an urge to visit
[1:14:57] hell I think about heaven all the
[1:15:00] time amen quite a difference amen quite
[1:15:04] a difference sir amen the word's been
[1:15:06] spoken so why don't we look for the
[1:15:08] prophesied result that's exactly why are
[1:15:10] we looking at the negative I'm preaching
[1:15:12] to myself this morning why are we
[1:15:14] looking at the negative when we've got
[1:15:16] prophecy that has promised us eternal
[1:15:18] life it's promised us Health it's
[1:15:21] promised us security it's promised us
[1:15:23] strength wisdom Revelation it's promised
[1:15:27] all of it and we get anointed by the old
[1:15:30] devil come on preach with me we get
[1:15:32] anointed by the devil and we first thing
[1:15:34] start speaking negative
[1:15:36] things last night now I'm telling you I
[1:15:39] felt the physical symptom of this and
[1:15:41] and but I think it'll make a good
[1:15:43] example last night I almost picked up
[1:15:45] the phone and called a brother to say I
[1:15:47] will not be preaching
[1:15:50] tomorrow my stomach all in a turmoil
[1:15:54] I just started a few days ago this
[1:15:57] turmoil just going and and I I just so
[1:16:01] tired of it I just I can't even eat but
[1:16:03] what I keep beling it back and H this
[1:16:06] just it's terrible I'm sorry to I'm
[1:16:08] trying to I'm trying to be
[1:16:12] kosher and I was sitting there in my
[1:16:14] office and I was looking at this thought
[1:16:18] by God's grace trying to put it together
[1:16:20] and I'm sitting there and next thing I
[1:16:23] know Jerry's like Paul it's bedtime it's
[1:16:28] time you see that thought if I can't do
[1:16:31] this almost brought me to the place just
[1:16:34] to push a key on a phone and say I'm
[1:16:40] done but something keeps holding me
[1:16:42] that's right
[1:16:45] Hallelujah and I thought this has been
[1:16:47] on my heart a little too long to leave
[1:16:50] it on the plate another day or week or
[1:16:52] month or whatever
[1:16:54] you see my brother and sister we have to
[1:16:55] react to the influence that's right and
[1:16:58] when we know by Revelation that this
[1:17:01] word that has come to us cannot fail us
[1:17:04] then we can step forward and say I'm
[1:17:07] just going to claim my healing tonight
[1:17:10] I'm just going to claim that God I will
[1:17:12] wake up in the morning and I will feel
[1:17:14] good right amen not I hope so amen
[1:17:18] that's not my faith that's it but God
[1:17:21] said I'm your healer Paul just accept
[1:17:24] your healing Paul and you got to say
[1:17:27] Lord I accept my healing amen cuz
[1:17:30] without that portion my brother and
[1:17:32] sister we can read that scripture and
[1:17:34] declare it day after day year after year
[1:17:38] decade after decade and nothing happens
[1:17:40] without us reaching out and saying
[1:17:43] that's the word that was prophesied over
[1:17:47] this flesh and I receive it and it
[1:17:49] cannot return void amen oh Hallelujah
[1:17:54] yes sir
[1:17:56] amen not a hoping that's it but Faith
[1:17:59] that's exactly right that declares it
[1:18:01] already done
[1:18:04] hallelujah already
[1:18:07] accomplished yeah there it is my brother
[1:18:10] now look at the definition of accomplish
[1:18:13] Amen to succeed in
[1:18:16] doing
[1:18:19] yeah let me tell you about how
[1:18:21] successful my God is
[1:18:24] every business venture I hope you don't
[1:18:27] mind me calling you a business
[1:18:30] venture every business
[1:18:33] venture is successful amen amen Every
[1:18:39] Soul that he spoke before the foundation
[1:18:43] of the
[1:18:44] world Amen every son every daughter
[1:18:48] every little boy every little girl every
[1:18:51] teenager my brother and sister he spoke
[1:18:54] it and we can sit here today and say I
[1:18:58] declare my God is going to be successful
[1:19:01] in the lives of our
[1:19:03] teenagers amen he spoke it he gave it we
[1:19:07] gave them back we made the commitment
[1:19:09] but our commitment is only a reflection
[1:19:12] of his commitment that's right amen if
[1:19:14] he had no commitment we would have no
[1:19:16] commitment but he has commitment Amen to
[1:19:21] bring about a result
[1:19:23] here we go again my goodness you'd think
[1:19:25] brother Paul turned into a
[1:19:27] worksman but bring
[1:19:32] about a result by effort amen that's
[1:19:36] right
[1:19:38] Amen to bring to completion Amen to S
[1:19:43] succeed in reaching a stage of
[1:19:46] progression that's right Amen to equip
[1:19:51] thoroughly that's right that's it I want
[1:19:54] to know is anybody equipped thoroughly
[1:19:56] today amen has God come and laid the
[1:19:58] word down in our lives so strong
[1:20:02] anchored it so deep and made a
[1:20:04] revelation revelated it to us that I can
[1:20:07] sit here today and say I believe with
[1:20:09] all of my heart I'm making the Rapture
[1:20:12] because I'm already equipped for the
[1:20:15] faith for everything I need to make that
[1:20:18] Rapture already within me that was what
[1:20:20] the prophet was saying amen everything
[1:20:22] you need is already in you
[1:20:26] equipped oh
[1:20:29] hallelujah amen that's right now that
[1:20:31] doesn't mean that God's not going to
[1:20:33] make you climb the stairs that's right
[1:20:36] amen
[1:20:38] hallelujah amen perfect that's it a
[1:20:42] cinnamon a
[1:20:44] cinnamon
[1:20:46] cinnamon sorry I said
[1:20:49] that somebody say it for me synony
[1:20:52] synonym
[1:20:53] amen you know sometimes my brain is
[1:20:58] well I bought a truck one time
[1:21:01] Saints and when I took it to the dealer
[1:21:03] to get some work done on it the mechanic
[1:21:05] said I am thoroughly
[1:21:07] confused and I said why are you
[1:21:09] thoroughly confused he says the VIN
[1:21:12] number and the model year and everything
[1:21:16] your pickup should have this parts and
[1:21:18] this
[1:21:19] Parts but it's got Parts on it from
[1:21:21] Pickups that Chevrolet did didn't
[1:21:23] produce they quit producing that
[1:21:25] particular thing two years ago was I
[1:21:28] blessed or
[1:21:30] what somebody at the chevret factory
[1:21:32] started sweeping off shelves and goes oh
[1:21:35] look at this this alternator will
[1:21:38] fit oh look at this water pump still the
[1:21:41] same bolt holes but an old style put it
[1:21:44] on there oh this will work and he says
[1:21:47] look I'm sorry to tell you but you've
[1:21:48] got a lemon that
[1:21:50] runs now my brother and sister that's
[1:21:53] not who we are amen God didn't just drag
[1:21:55] something here and drag something there
[1:21:57] he said that we were thoroughly equipped
[1:22:01] amen so everything we need to make the
[1:22:05] Rapture is already in
[1:22:08] USL amen it's not the
[1:22:11] law but neither is it
[1:22:14] entirely just a New
[1:22:17] Covenant that's why the prophet of God
[1:22:19] said see these guys went this way too
[1:22:21] far these guys went this way too far you
[1:22:24] got to come back to the center of the
[1:22:25] lord it's law and Grace is the whole
[1:22:28] balance of what it is God gave the Ten
[1:22:30] Commandments didn't put an expiration
[1:22:32] date on them amen but then he turned
[1:22:34] around and told me my told us that our
[1:22:36] Grace is his grace is sufficient so we
[1:22:39] can look at that and realize okay we
[1:22:41] still don't want to lost and covet and
[1:22:43] murder and do all of these things but
[1:22:46] when the flesh trips us up there's Grace
[1:22:49] to cover it can someone say thank you
[1:22:51] Lord today
[1:22:54] amen
[1:22:55] hallelujah but we I I say this just
[1:22:59] rhetorically but do you believe this is
[1:23:01] the age of the coming of the Lord amen
[1:23:03] we're coming to the Fulfillment my
[1:23:05] brother and sister of This Promise of
[1:23:08] Isaiah that God spoke through Isaiah
[1:23:10] we're coming to the Fulfillment of that
[1:23:12] and it's not going to be a partial
[1:23:15] fulfillment amen it's going to be a
[1:23:18] complete fulfillment amen amen so if the
[1:23:21] word's coming to a complete fulfillment
[1:23:24] it must be something similar in this way
[1:23:26] of a perfect God can we say amen amen a
[1:23:30] perfect God speaking
[1:23:35] amen a perfect word that's it I believe
[1:23:39] the message of the hour but amen no no
[1:23:42] no don't let the devil trick you on that
[1:23:43] one my brother and sister there's no
[1:23:45] butts in this if God's word it's either
[1:23:49] perfect or it's not and if it's not it's
[1:23:52] not God's
[1:23:54] word h wow well I believe everything the
[1:23:59] prophet said
[1:24:01] but
[1:24:03] Ser you know what it
[1:24:06] is the devil got into their
[1:24:11] message with another language amen
[1:24:16] another ideology that's another
[1:24:19] version another voice another writing
[1:24:25] amen cuz you see sorry to be redundant
[1:24:28] but if we believe this is God's anointed
[1:24:32] word it simply can't return void amen
[1:24:37] amen you know a recent situation of
[1:24:41] someone because of certain circumstances
[1:24:42] said we've missed the Rapture this is
[1:24:45] all this is all done this is all a lie
[1:24:48] we've been
[1:24:50] deceived and I'm going to to just speak
[1:24:52] really blunt might sound like a a little
[1:24:54] hostile to this
[1:24:56] individual all they this is how
[1:24:58] delusional Satan can be all they had to
[1:25:00] do is rewind their own life a little
[1:25:05] ways and they'll see the supernatural
[1:25:08] hand of God come into their
[1:25:12] life but the
[1:25:14] devil
[1:25:16] well they've got Superior look back
[1:25:20] abilities the prophet said says this
[1:25:23] this and this and it never come to
[1:25:25] pass of course this is after they have
[1:25:28] researched every newspaper every
[1:25:32] database went to every village and went
[1:25:35] to every spot on earth and interviewed
[1:25:39] every single
[1:25:41] person that's doable isn't
[1:25:46] it if we Rec recruited 100,000 people we
[1:25:50] could not go touch every
[1:25:54] testimony of God on this
[1:26:00] Earth but let's face it you and I have
[1:26:03] had our
[1:26:10] disappointments I think I'll leave that
[1:26:12] one
[1:26:13] alone let me just put it this
[1:26:16] way the devil will anoint you to only
[1:26:19] look as far back as your last
[1:26:25] disappointment
[1:26:26] Hallelujah imagine sister Carrie coming
[1:26:29] out of Egypt and you've got all the way
[1:26:32] down close to the Red Sea and realize
[1:26:34] you left your favorite stew pot in the
[1:26:37] house in
[1:26:44] Goa if I was really supposed to have
[1:26:46] left the house I would not have forgot
[1:26:50] that I what am I doing here I'm out here
[1:26:55] in the dirt I'm out here in all of this
[1:26:58] and Pharaoh's up there wants to kill
[1:27:01] me what am I doing
[1:27:05] here totally forgetting 400 years in
[1:27:08] their family
[1:27:10] history totally forgetting every prayer
[1:27:13] that they cried Lord Deliver
[1:27:17] Us totally forgetting that God came with
[1:27:19] a powerful hand and touch their lives to
[1:27:23] take them from the oppressor and totally
[1:27:29] forgetting Devil's Sly old Fox but let
[1:27:32] me remind
[1:27:34] you the bride of Christ he's responding
[1:27:37] to you not you to
[1:27:41] him
[1:27:43] amen amen so that's right a perfect God
[1:27:48] speaking a perfect word bringing a
[1:27:50] perfect accomplishment to the spoken
[1:27:53] word amen so what's God's prophecy of
[1:27:57] you feel free if you want to speak out
[1:27:59] what's God's prophecy of you amen what's
[1:28:02] he got to say about you amen what did he
[1:28:06] testify of you amen come on all we got
[1:28:09] to do is just go a rudimentary Bible
[1:28:11] study and if you don't have a good grasp
[1:28:13] of the Bible use
[1:28:18] Google because Google will even show you
[1:28:20] the scripture yeah you know I've done
[1:28:24] that before literally have a scripture
[1:28:25] on my mind and I'm like man where is
[1:28:27] that
[1:28:30] okay yep there it is Philippians okay
[1:28:34] thank you
[1:28:36] devil well I don't know that Google is
[1:28:38] the
[1:28:38] devil it was just created probably by
[1:28:41] the
[1:28:44] devil so you look at this my brother and
[1:28:46] sister see he's bringing this but what
[1:28:49] is God's prophecy Brother David spoke
[1:28:51] out there said you're perfect he said
[1:28:53] you're righteous he said You Are Holy
[1:28:56] said you have his nature you are not a
[1:29:00] people but now you are a people amen he
[1:29:05] says all of these things that once you
[1:29:07] were lost but now you are redeemed amen
[1:29:10] and it said that our hearts would be
[1:29:12] turned back anybody's heart turned back
[1:29:14] today amen he said that we would eat the
[1:29:17] book anybody eating the book today oh
[1:29:21] praise God
[1:29:22] amen he said that this bride would be
[1:29:25] righteous and she would be holy and
[1:29:28] that's where the devil slips in and says
[1:29:30] I don't think that applies to you but
[1:29:32] devil I'm not asking your definition I
[1:29:36] ask God's definition he said I can't
[1:29:39] even see your sin I can't see your
[1:29:41] unbelief your unbelief at this moment
[1:29:44] will not stop the word from coming to
[1:29:47] pass hallu and then God will bring a
[1:29:49] revelation and the veil opens and we
[1:29:52] look back and say oh Lord how could I
[1:29:54] ever have thought that I could never be
[1:29:56] saved how could I ever have thought this
[1:29:59] and thought that and God says it's all
[1:30:01] right cuz I knew who you was you've got
[1:30:04] identity that's
[1:30:07] amen
[1:30:09] hallelujah now look at this first Peter
[1:30:12] I got to hurry along
[1:30:14] here amen first Peter
[1:30:16] 1:15 but as he which hath called you
[1:30:20] that's it is Holy
[1:30:22] so be ye holy in all manner of
[1:30:25] conversation because it is written be ye
[1:30:28] holy for I am Holy amen now I can't be
[1:30:32] holy that's it but God in Me that's it
[1:30:35] God in you the word amen that's coming
[1:30:39] to an
[1:30:41] accomplishment Hallelujah that's it
[1:30:44] that's
[1:30:47] right you know my son was getting his
[1:30:50] contractor's license in
[1:30:53] Arizona and it's actually quite an
[1:30:56] extensive thing and it's open
[1:30:58] book so when he called me and told me
[1:31:00] dad I failed it at first I was
[1:31:04] like what you took an open book
[1:31:10] test and failed
[1:31:13] it and I think there must have been
[1:31:15] something in my
[1:31:19] voice and says Dad I wonder how you
[1:31:21] would answering 400
[1:31:26] questions they gave you two hours to
[1:31:29] answer
[1:31:31] 400
[1:31:36] questions I hope you see where I'm
[1:31:45] going I've been given you've been given
[1:31:48] an open book test amen that's
[1:31:54] right can we be honest amen we failed
[1:31:58] yes
[1:32:03] sir but what you learned in this part of
[1:32:07] the
[1:32:07] book by real
[1:32:10] experience next time the devil's got a
[1:32:13] question you don't have to go look it
[1:32:16] up and when my son took the test the
[1:32:19] next time he's going through he got
[1:32:22] about 90% through the test and was well
[1:32:25] on his way would have passed the test
[1:32:27] but they hold you to the time literally
[1:32:29] when the timer goes D they come take
[1:32:33] your
[1:32:35] stuff the screen that you were typing it
[1:32:37] all in shuts
[1:32:40] down are you with
[1:32:42] me this is why this battle that we're
[1:32:46] in as I learn here that just shall live
[1:32:50] by faith am I going to have have to go
[1:32:52] back and find that again no I'm going to
[1:32:54] stand before God and be able to say I am
[1:32:56] just I will live by faith amen and then
[1:32:59] we move into another aspect of our life
[1:33:01] and something happens there and the
[1:33:03] Devil comes and throws it in your face
[1:33:05] and you say Lord forgive me and by faith
[1:33:07] in the word of God God's faith in God's
[1:33:10] word amen you come and pretty soon come
[1:33:12] on Saints preach with me today when we
[1:33:15] get far enough through the book we've
[1:33:18] got the answer to the devil's question
[1:33:20] without to go find something we're there
[1:33:24] every day learning learning learning
[1:33:27] what are we doing fulfilling the
[1:33:29] accomplishment of the word amen
[1:33:32] otherwise God would just go and I don't
[1:33:34] know maybe the port would be behind your
[1:33:36] ear and he'd just slip a little whatever
[1:33:39] you call
[1:33:41] them what do you call those dve thumb
[1:33:45] drive wake up one morning drunk
[1:33:48] yesterday wake up this morning a saint
[1:33:52] no
[1:33:53] sir you got to get on the first rung
[1:33:56] first step and then the next step then
[1:33:59] the next step then the next step Page by
[1:34:04] Page line upon line God changing us and
[1:34:10] the whole time the devil wants to say
[1:34:11] you're failure you're failure and you
[1:34:13] can look at that and say yeah but Satan
[1:34:16] time's not finished
[1:34:19] yet Hallelujah
[1:34:22] amen hallelujah let me get on let me get
[1:34:26] on somebody keep praying about Paul
[1:34:28] being
[1:34:29] focused amen what are we doing we're
[1:34:31] fulfilling these words that's right amen
[1:34:34] they were spoken of us can you say Amen
[1:34:36] to that this morning these words were
[1:34:39] spoken of us amen now there's a whole
[1:34:42] another category of language and words
[1:34:44] and whatever that applies to the devil
[1:34:47] right those that would fall under that
[1:34:49] year of your father the devil my brother
[1:34:50] and sister but we're not of the devil
[1:34:53] never was of the devil never will be of
[1:34:55] the devil we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:34:57] God from the foundation before the
[1:35:00] foundation of the world where names were
[1:35:02] written in that book and God verified
[1:35:05] that and said that's my
[1:35:07] handwriting amen you know you get a real
[1:35:09] good forger he can do such a good job
[1:35:13] but you get a real good investigative uh
[1:35:16] handwriting individual and he can take
[1:35:19] those signatures have the original
[1:35:21] and he can come and say now you'll see
[1:35:24] how this loop on the H or the I or the G
[1:35:28] or the J is this way and they don't
[1:35:31] match you wouldn't know it I wouldn't
[1:35:33] know it most people wouldn't know it God
[1:35:35] knows it am amen God knows who you are
[1:35:39] sir
[1:35:41] hallelujah amen now look at this in
[1:35:43] Mary's belief I just like this so we
[1:35:47] find out today that the message is a
[1:35:50] true Bible
[1:35:53] message I find I find this a little bit
[1:35:55] sorry my warped humor I find this a
[1:35:57] little bit
[1:36:00] humorous that the prophet who's speaking
[1:36:03] these
[1:36:03] words is turning around speaking to you
[1:36:07] saying so we find out that this message
[1:36:10] he's referring to the message he's
[1:36:13] bringing well the message he
[1:36:16] carried the message um he
[1:36:20] delivered
[1:36:23] amen yeah it's not claiming ownership
[1:36:26] it's not claiming
[1:36:29] originality so we find out today that
[1:36:32] the message is a true bible message can
[1:36:34] we say amen amen back to the baptism of
[1:36:36] the Holy Ghost back to the power of God
[1:36:39] back to Pentecost again now let's
[1:36:41] remember my brother and sister Pentecost
[1:36:43] was not necessarily what we reflected to
[1:36:45] be right they they were as under the
[1:36:48] influence of new wine they were under
[1:36:51] this they spoke in tongues they praise
[1:36:53] God but we'll look at this and realize
[1:36:55] this was not my brother and sister let
[1:36:57] me just give you an idea of modern
[1:36:59] Pentecost how the devil gets into it I I
[1:37:01] do my homework I please don't go there
[1:37:04] but I'm telling you my brother and
[1:37:05] sister that a bunch of women in pencil
[1:37:08] skirts with heels that are so tall up
[1:37:11] there
[1:37:18] singing is that Pentecost sir
[1:37:21] Pentecost was a cleansing
[1:37:25] fire it was not just an anointing on
[1:37:29] flesh Pentecost was a cleansing fire
[1:37:34] that come down and went right to the
[1:37:36] depths of hearts and souls and right to
[1:37:39] the depth of the Flesh and cleansed it
[1:37:42] and once it's been cleansed it can't
[1:37:44] look like anything but
[1:37:48] God it is God am amen so we're not
[1:37:51] talking about Pentecost of today not
[1:37:54] even Pentecost of the 50s or 60s we're
[1:37:56] talking about Pentecost of a cleansing
[1:37:58] fire that fell on that day and souls
[1:38:02] were
[1:38:03] burnt
[1:38:07] purified restoring the hearts of the
[1:38:09] fathers back to the children or the
[1:38:11] children back to the fathers rather in
[1:38:13] this last days we're looking for a
[1:38:15] Heavenly messenger and I believe he's
[1:38:18] here tonight that's it I don't want to
[1:38:21] change the prophet's words if you don't
[1:38:22] mind but I believe he's here today yes
[1:38:25] sir Hallelujah I believe he's here today
[1:38:28] my brother and sister we're not having
[1:38:30] to look back way way back oh you know
[1:38:33] people think that don't know the message
[1:38:34] they think it's a little weird we're
[1:38:35] quoting something from the 60s my
[1:38:37] brother and sister but let's go back
[1:38:40] here okay I I don't want to have to
[1:38:42] explain this but
[1:38:43] um it's the true
[1:38:48] Bible I don't really want to have to
[1:38:50] quote something that uh um 2500 years
[1:38:54] old really it's God's word and it's not
[1:38:58] 2500 years old it's before the
[1:39:00] foundation old that's it amen because
[1:39:04] God's worda has never changed that's
[1:39:06] right it is the original amen that's
[1:39:08] right amen so there is a restoring back
[1:39:12] to the fathers amen and he's here
[1:39:16] tonight that's exactly amen amen amen I
[1:39:19] believe he's here that's right amen what
[1:39:21] does he do that's it he Bears record
[1:39:23] amen so what does he do God offers up
[1:39:26] his own evidence amen right he doesn't
[1:39:29] go over here and ask this man now you'll
[1:39:30] hear men offer up evidence right but God
[1:39:33] himself says to get this started off
[1:39:34] right I'm going to offer up my evidence
[1:39:37] first now you'll notice in a court of
[1:39:40] law that the prosecutor offers his
[1:39:44] evidence and then he moves on to the
[1:39:47] witness over here's evidence and this
[1:39:49] policeman over here's evidence and that
[1:39:51] is but the prosecutor has to declare the
[1:39:54] foundation of the evidence
[1:39:56] first so everybody knows where they're
[1:40:00] going so what does he do he Bears record
[1:40:02] now some of you aren't praying hard
[1:40:05] enough amen amen now look at this what
[1:40:09] do he bear a record
[1:40:11] of his own
[1:40:13] word the only thing he could bear record
[1:40:16] of was his own word speaking of the
[1:40:19] future amen
[1:40:21] so he's bearing record of the word are
[1:40:26] you with me when Jesus was on the earth
[1:40:29] he says I can do nothing except the
[1:40:31] father shows me what was he doing he was
[1:40:33] bearing record of the word if we can use
[1:40:36] modern terms that was already
[1:40:41] archived that's it not make it up on the
[1:40:44] Fly already
[1:40:48] archived and what was this record he was
[1:40:52] sparing you that's
[1:40:55] it that's what it was all about that's
[1:40:58] exactly amen it wasn't about fire
[1:41:01] consuming uh sacrifices it wasn't about
[1:41:03] these things and about those things it
[1:41:05] wasn't about ishmail it wasn't about
[1:41:07] none of this it was about
[1:41:09] you
[1:41:11] Hallelujah Christ in you the hope of
[1:41:13] glory that's it am now now prophecy very
[1:41:17] simple for us to understand that it's a
[1:41:20] a statement
[1:41:21] that something will happen in the future
[1:41:22] a power ability to know what will happen
[1:41:24] in the future inspired
[1:41:27] utterance that's it the function of a
[1:41:30] prophet that's
[1:41:32] it prediction of something to come
[1:41:35] that's right you realize that you are a
[1:41:38] supernatural prediction that's exactly
[1:41:41] now have Grace on what we view the word
[1:41:43] prediction right because predictions can
[1:41:45] have
[1:41:49] error but you you
[1:41:51] understand
[1:41:54] Supernatural you huh brother Trevor
[1:41:57] you're close my Victim of the
[1:41:59] day you growing up where you grew up we
[1:42:02] won't go into the details you grew where
[1:42:04] you were at and you were here and there
[1:42:06] was a time let's see wait there's things
[1:42:10] we don't even want to discuss in public
[1:42:12] right and you were there yeah what did
[1:42:16] the prediction
[1:42:18] say Amen the pred addiction
[1:42:22] said Son God you are a son of God all of
[1:42:26] this the devil said you're a drummer
[1:42:29] you're a rock band person you're an
[1:42:31] alcoholic you're going to do some drugs
[1:42:33] you're going to be angry you're going to
[1:42:35] be that's the devil's language my
[1:42:36] brother and sister but before the
[1:42:38] foundation of the world God said he's my
[1:42:41] son and he is going to be my son and
[1:42:45] there's nothing can change the fact I
[1:42:47] said he will be my son come on apply
[1:42:50] that that to your lives today Saints
[1:42:52] don't be looking at your circumstance
[1:42:54] don't be looking at your failure don't
[1:42:56] be looking at anything around you look
[1:42:58] to the word and the word said by
[1:43:01] prophecy that we would be Sons and
[1:43:03] Daughters of God hallelujah boy I tell
[1:43:07] you what my brother and sister let's
[1:43:08] look for a moment at the contrast and
[1:43:10] I'll tell you the contrast every day is
[1:43:13] getting
[1:43:14] broader it's spreading out broader and
[1:43:18] broader amen amen in home Depot I see a
[1:43:22] man I'm sorry I'm just I'm a kind of
[1:43:24] observant that way I see a man and a
[1:43:26] woman walking down the aisle towards me
[1:43:28] in Home Depot he looked like just a
[1:43:31] normal everyday guy and and I looked and
[1:43:34] they both had a ring on and I'm assuming
[1:43:36] the Rings belong to each other amen but
[1:43:38] it's there and she's got spiky purple
[1:43:41] hair with hot pink laced in it and H
[1:43:44] well anyway I don't want to be too
[1:43:47] judgmental and I'm like man that just
[1:43:49] don't seem to make sense
[1:43:55] but was she
[1:43:57] always like
[1:44:00] that I'll put it this
[1:44:02] way I anchor this back just I know it's
[1:44:05] probably been said by a lot of people
[1:44:06] but many many many years
[1:44:08] ago brother Donnie rean and it got
[1:44:11] anchored in my brain and I Associated it
[1:44:13] back to brother Donnie Reagan you are
[1:44:15] either going forward that's it or you
[1:44:19] are going back
[1:44:21] backwards amen now we know the society
[1:44:25] we live in maybe in 6 weeks her hair
[1:44:28] will be brown
[1:44:31] again but see how tricky the devil
[1:44:34] is you get a little
[1:44:37] taste and sin will take you further than
[1:44:42] you want to go that's right yeah the
[1:44:45] Holy Ghost will take you further than
[1:44:49] this old flesh
[1:44:51] thinks it wants to
[1:44:53] go let go and let God let go and let God
[1:44:58] Amen let him take us into Heavenly
[1:45:00] places let him take us into the
[1:45:02] supernatural let him take us into the
[1:45:04] liberty of the word amen hallelujah
[1:45:07] let's not just get so hunkered down amen
[1:45:09] it's like a little cartoon I seen once
[1:45:12] you know Bob was an unwilling Christian
[1:45:14] it was almost like a far side car
[1:45:16] cartoon I hope you guys don't mind me
[1:45:17] being demonstrative and uh and it said
[1:45:20] says you know Bob was kind of an
[1:45:21] unwilling Christian and the Rapture is
[1:45:24] taking place and it shows Bob holding on
[1:45:26] to his chair going to
[1:45:29] heaven
[1:45:31] no
[1:45:33] no no no unwilling Christians but you
[1:45:37] see that's pervaded mentality enough
[1:45:41] that somebody even saw fit to mock it
[1:45:44] yeah that's it I'm going to take my boat
[1:45:46] my car my train my plane my house in
[1:45:48] heaven is going to be just like my 7,000
[1:45:50] square foot house here on Earth no no no
[1:45:53] no no no no no you know I'm got a
[1:45:56] revelation amen your Mansion over there
[1:45:59] is not going to be some well
[1:46:03] anyway amen
[1:46:07] now okay can I at least get through this
[1:46:10] 42 Page
[1:46:15] quote here we are seven Church age book
[1:46:19] now I want you I want to skewer your
[1:46:21] thinking on this okay is it okay for me
[1:46:23] just to put a little twist on your
[1:46:24] thinking there to just cause you to make
[1:46:27] sure you look at this in a certain
[1:46:28] fashion usually we don't like that but I
[1:46:31] want you to understand this quote is
[1:46:34] dealing with
[1:46:37] contrast this is where it's
[1:46:40] at it's not who's right and who's wrong
[1:46:44] it's what contrast we
[1:46:47] are you're blind or naked is is that
[1:46:53] you
[1:46:55] no now this is really desperate how can
[1:46:58] anyone be blind and naked not know it
[1:47:00] yet it says that they were are blind and
[1:47:02] naked and can't perceive it the answer
[1:47:05] is they are spiritually blind and
[1:47:07] spiritually naked do you remember when
[1:47:09] Elisha and Gesa were surrounded by the
[1:47:11] army of the syrians and you recall that
[1:47:13] Elisha smoked them Blind by the power of
[1:47:16] God yet their eyes were wide open they
[1:47:18] could see where they were going the
[1:47:20] blindness was peculiar in that they
[1:47:23] could see certain things but other
[1:47:25] certain things such as Elisha and the
[1:47:28] servant and the camp of Israel they
[1:47:30] could not
[1:47:31] see you catch the full depth of that yes
[1:47:34] sir they can see certain things they see
[1:47:37] Jesus on a cross at
[1:47:41] Calvary but they don't see him living
[1:47:46] entirely in them amen they don't see
[1:47:51] them as actually the sacrifice that was
[1:47:55] on the
[1:47:56] cross are you with me they don't see
[1:47:59] themselves there but the word says he
[1:48:02] became sin so that we could become
[1:48:05] righteousness and so that was my sin
[1:48:08] hanging on that cross amen that's right
[1:48:11] and they talk about that but they don't
[1:48:13] see the real depth of it right they
[1:48:16] don't see that a holy God expects them
[1:48:18] to be
[1:48:19] holy now I'm going to just say this as a
[1:48:21] reference point not judgmentally but you
[1:48:23] know people have lost their respect for
[1:48:25] the word of God when you see them in the
[1:48:27] summertime parked in their church
[1:48:29] parking lot flip-flops shorts now this
[1:48:32] is going to be a little direct forgive
[1:48:34] me but Tops on that are so limited that
[1:48:40] you they might as well just be wearing
[1:48:41] their bikini
[1:48:43] Tong baggy arms cut out all this walking
[1:48:47] with their Bible into the house of God
[1:48:50] yeah I don't say that is a criticism
[1:48:53] those people I'm saying my brother and
[1:48:55] sister the word of God is coming to pass
[1:48:57] in our day it's happening that people
[1:49:01] being spiritually blind and spiritually
[1:49:04] naked amen they don't see a holy God
[1:49:07] they believe they're acceptable in the
[1:49:09] presence of a holy God that when the
[1:49:11] priests used to walk into the holiest of
[1:49:13] holies and everything wasn't perfect
[1:49:16] they pulled him out with a rope that's
[1:49:18] right my brother and sister I don't mean
[1:49:20] to be crashed today but I tell you what
[1:49:22] they'd be the mortuaries would be clear
[1:49:24] full of
[1:49:26] preachers yeah and there'd be some
[1:49:29] scared people of why are our preachers
[1:49:31] all dying that's right because they've
[1:49:34] lost their respect for the word of God
[1:49:36] and they don't see that it's important
[1:49:38] anymore so they just do what feels
[1:49:43] right you know I tell this as a joke I'm
[1:49:45] getting sidetracked forgive me but back
[1:49:47] in the days when we didn't have a pastor
[1:49:49] here and sister Jerry and I used to
[1:49:51] receive the VHS tapes of brother Donnie
[1:49:54] rean they they mail them to us real
[1:49:56] regular and and this is back a few years
[1:49:58] so I I put the VHS tapes in there so
[1:50:00] you'll recognize this back a few years
[1:50:03] and I'm telling you Saints hope you have
[1:50:05] a sense of humor this
[1:50:09] morning push play
[1:50:12] recliner feed up bowl of
[1:50:17] popcorn amen I believe that brother
[1:50:19] Donnie and some of you
[1:50:22] people won't even be in the house of God
[1:50:25] you sit there in your home with your
[1:50:26] bunny slippers on watching the preaching
[1:50:30] aren't even in the house of God sitting
[1:50:32] there in your
[1:50:36] jamas that's right but I believed what
[1:50:40] he said enough I've never watched
[1:50:43] preaching in my jamas
[1:50:48] again come on the word ought to change
[1:50:51] us that strong yes amen so he sploded
[1:50:54] him blind forgive me for that digression
[1:50:57] there it was particular they see certain
[1:50:59] things right they see certain things
[1:51:01] they see God sent a prophet
[1:51:05] yeah they can't see the part where he
[1:51:07] said you ought to be in a church with a
[1:51:09] pastor with the Holy Ghost I'm not
[1:51:10] promoting preachers I'm promoting what
[1:51:12] God told the prophet to speak that's
[1:51:15] exactly right amen cuz I'll tell you
[1:51:17] what there's a lot of rotten preachers
[1:51:18] out here amen amen and let's just face
[1:51:20] it there's a lot of rotten preachers out
[1:51:22] here but the word says amen the word
[1:51:25] says a prophet
[1:51:29] said see certain things anyway his army
[1:51:34] could not see was did not Avail for them
[1:51:37] what they did not see brought on their
[1:51:39] captivity now does uh what does this
[1:51:42] mean to us H it means exactly what it
[1:51:46] meant back there in the Earthly Ministry
[1:51:48] of Jesus he tried to to teach them truth
[1:51:51] but they would not listen John 9:40 and
[1:51:54] 41 and some of the Pharisees which were
[1:51:56] with him heard these words and said unto
[1:51:58] him are we blind also Jesus said to them
[1:52:01] if ye were blind you should have no
[1:52:04] sin come on I want you to see where this
[1:52:06] is going he's not talking about flesh
[1:52:09] he's talking about spiritual eyes to see
[1:52:12] a spiritual word and my brother and
[1:52:15] sister I can say hallelujah this morning
[1:52:18] that God has not allowed you and I to be
[1:52:20] blind he has taken the scales from our
[1:52:22] eyes he's taken this away from us that
[1:52:25] we can see the word amen and Jesus
[1:52:29] speaking to them says no if you were
[1:52:31] blind you wouldn't have no
[1:52:34] accountability that's right you should
[1:52:37] have no sin but now you say we see
[1:52:39] Therefore your sin remaineth the
[1:52:41] attitude of this age is exactly what it
[1:52:43] was then people have it all they know it
[1:52:46] all they cannot be taught and if a point
[1:52:48] of truth from the word word comes up and
[1:52:50] a man tries to explain his view to one
[1:52:53] with an opposing view The Listener is
[1:52:55] not at all listening then he might learn
[1:52:58] but is listening only to refute what is
[1:53:01] being said I couldn't tell you how many
[1:53:03] times I've encountered that amen you can
[1:53:06] quote it from the Bible and they'll
[1:53:08] argue that that's not what it
[1:53:12] means come on my brother and sister
[1:53:14] that's not a Believer that's right I
[1:53:16] know I'm preaching a little straight but
[1:53:18] that's not a believer that's right h no
[1:53:21] the Bible they must have wrote that
[1:53:24] wrong when the prophet said it 101 times
[1:53:27] and they say that's not what it means he
[1:53:30] must have wrote it wrong no I'm telling
[1:53:32] you something's wrong your hard drives
[1:53:33] what's writing it
[1:53:36] wrong is it
[1:53:38] okay
[1:53:40] amen
[1:53:43] oh it cannot be taught point of Truth
[1:53:45] the word comes up man tries to explain
[1:53:47] his view one to another listeners and a
[1:53:49] at all listening might learn but
[1:53:51] listening only to refute now I want to
[1:53:54] ask a fair question can scripture fight
[1:53:58] scripture does the bible contradict the
[1:54:02] Bible can there be two doctrines of
[1:54:05] Truth in the word that say the opposite
[1:54:08] or opposed to the other no no
[1:54:12] no I don't want to I don't want to go
[1:54:15] too far into these
[1:54:17] things I have literally set in the
[1:54:20] presence of men that would tell you this
[1:54:23] brother was with the prophet and brother
[1:54:25] Brenham told him this directly opposed
[1:54:30] that's right to the word of God that's
[1:54:32] exactly right and
[1:54:35] expect you to believe
[1:54:39] it but they have churches full of
[1:54:42] hundreds of
[1:54:44] people amen who are able to accept
[1:54:48] something directly opposed to
[1:54:54] scripture you say why are you bringing
[1:54:56] that up brother Paul no I'm not bringing
[1:54:57] it up to criticize them if you think
[1:54:59] that you've missed the point I'm here to
[1:55:02] tell you the veil's been lifted for you
[1:55:04] I'm here to tell you that God and His
[1:55:07] Sovereign Grace has come and has
[1:55:09] revealed himself to you that the word is
[1:55:12] alive and the word is all important to
[1:55:15] you and it doesn't matter if brother
[1:55:16] Paul starts a venture to the right or to
[1:55:18] the left you guys here listen to me
[1:55:21] saying you guys are going to be
[1:55:22] courageous enough to say brother Paul
[1:55:24] you're off repent come back to the word
[1:55:28] that's the kind of men I want to serve
[1:55:31] god with that's the kind of sisters I
[1:55:33] want to serve god with that's going to
[1:55:35] stand and say look we're going to have
[1:55:36] to vote you out if you can't change the
[1:55:38] way you're going if you're going to keep
[1:55:40] going that way we maybe won't have to
[1:55:42] vote you out maybe God will bring
[1:55:44] judgment or bring you to correction or
[1:55:46] bring something but you see my brother
[1:55:48] and sister
[1:55:50] the immature tree is the one that can be
[1:55:54] blown flat to the
[1:55:57] ground
[1:55:59] amen you know the rule of Rome in the
[1:56:02] Dark Ages was bend them till they
[1:56:06] break then you know why they chose
[1:56:09] that because very few in that under that
[1:56:12] anointing would
[1:56:15] bend
[1:56:17] imagine some big
[1:56:20] tattooed mean looking guy with a mask
[1:56:23] with spikes on
[1:56:25] it big Rippling
[1:56:28] muscles a wicked look in his eye and

[1:57:30] they're good
[1:57:32] people and out of respect we're going to
[1:57:34] let them preach here in the
[1:57:38] church because we don't want to offend
[1:57:45] anyone you realize it's not just
[1:57:47] individuals that God's putting or
[1:57:49] allowing ing the rack to be applied
[1:57:51] to it's whole

[1:58:20] to the full truth but I can't make them
[1:58:23] and you can't make them only God can
[1:58:25] make them and if there's no light
[1:58:27] shining in their life then where are
[1:58:30] they going to go that's it that's why
[1:58:32] you're there that's right it might be a
[1:58:34] son it might be a daughter it might be a
[1:58:36] parent it might be whatever it is you've

[1:58:41] happening Hallelujah I'm getting
[1:58:43] sidetracked forgive me amen where was I
[1:58:49] amen
[1:58:51] amen they couldn't see certain things
[1:58:53] but was certain things such as Elisha
[1:58:55] the servant Camp of Israel they could
[1:58:57] not see what this Army could see did not
[1:59:00] Avail for them I was already here wasn't
[1:59:05] I well let me get down
[1:59:08] here um man where was I scripture
[1:59:12] fighting scripture Bible contradicting
[1:59:15] Bible it cannot be so oh thank you
[1:59:18] brother I was looking at that screen and
[1:59:20] I come back to this one and I realize
[1:59:22] I'm lost yeah how many of God's people
[1:59:25] have their eyes open to that truth not
[1:59:28] even 1% you thought I was hard brother
[1:59:31] brandham preached to tens of thousands
[1:59:33] and he says not even
[1:59:35] 1% I come across like a PTY
[1:59:38] cat right soft here have a sugar cube be
[1:59:44] happy
[1:59:45] lollipop amen come
[1:59:48] on Prophet wasn't no wimp he didn't
[1:59:51] water it
[1:59:53] down I in fact I'll tell you what my
[1:59:55] brother and sister if prophet of God
[1:59:56] come and preach to us today many people
[1:59:59] many many people would say man he's too
[2:00:02] harsh
[2:00:03] yeah
[2:00:09] yeah not even 1% as far as I know have
[2:00:12] learned that all scripture is given by
[2:00:14] God and all is profitable for Doctrine
[2:00:17] Repro correction Etc amen if all
[2:00:20] scripture is thus a given then every
[2:00:23] verse will dub tail if given a
[2:00:26] chance now yes sir but how many believe
[2:00:30] in predestination unto election and
[2:00:32] reprobation unto destruction those who
[2:00:35] don't will they listen no they will not
[2:00:38] ye are both uh you both yet both are in
[2:00:42] the word and nothing will change it
[2:00:44] that's
[2:00:46] it but to learn about it reconcile the
[2:00:49] truth of those doctrines with other
[2:00:51] truths that seem to oppose they will not
[2:00:54] take the time but they stop their ears
[2:00:58] Nash with their teeth and they lose out
[2:01:02] at the end of this age a prophet will
[2:01:04] come and they will be blind to all that
[2:01:07] he is doing and saying they are so sure
[2:01:09] they are right and in their blindness
[2:01:11] they will lose it all
[2:01:14] amen I tell you we should be coming Lord
[2:01:18] open my eyes open my heart open my ears
[2:01:21] Lord I if I'm wrong if I am wrong Lord
[2:01:25] move me over here to what is right I
[2:01:28] don't care if I'm even just a one
[2:01:29] footstep out of line amen The Prophet's
[2:01:33] vision of that bride going forward is
[2:01:35] telling her to get back in line get back
[2:01:37] in
[2:01:38] step now imagine in the modern version
[2:01:40] of the church they'd stop and pull out
[2:01:42] all kinds of
[2:01:43] references well brother brandham you
[2:01:45] even said over here in this sermon no
[2:01:48] sir what is the the bride do gets in
[2:01:50] Step
[2:01:52] amen she doesn't argue she doesn't argue
[2:01:56] that that I I I I think brother Brown
[2:01:58] must have must have plagiarized this
[2:02:00] from Arthur
[2:02:02] pink well so Arthur pink had a
[2:02:04] revelation of the word what's wrong with
[2:02:07] that what's wrong with Arthur pink or
[2:02:10] Martin Luther or or uh any of these
[2:02:13] others my brain just went dead on me any
[2:02:15] of these others that are quoted today so
[2:02:17] much
[2:02:19] John Wesley
[2:02:21] um Char
[2:02:25] Spurgeon oh brother Brown plagiarize no
[2:02:27] I'm sorry that was a word before Charles
[2:02:29] Spurgeon ever spoke it right it was a
[2:02:31] word before Arthur Pink ever spoke it or
[2:02:33] John Wesley over spoke it or Martin
[2:02:34] Luther ever spoke it's God's word
[2:02:35] there's no plagiarizing it shows you the
[2:02:38] carnal mind that they are approaching
[2:02:39] this from that those words belong to
[2:02:41] that man and that man alone no it's
[2:02:43] God's word amen hallelujah yes sir kind
[2:02:46] of like copyrighting the message that's

[2:04:49] to know that God is
[2:04:52] real to know that he is
[2:04:54] powerful that his blood washes
