[25:39] hand
[25:44] amen wherever he is the word says we
[25:47] shall be also hallelujah how beautiful
[25:50] that is amen well we just want to
[25:53] remember each and every one that's not
[25:55] here tonight many needs in the body many
[25:58] circumstances that we all face in our
[26:01] lives and we just want to remember our
[26:03] brothers and sisters strengthen them
[26:06] amen just reading the prophet of God
[26:10] referring back to the scripture that we
[26:12] are one body amen and so we should never
[26:16] let the devil divide us never let him
[26:19] put something in the way you know he'll
[26:22] always throw some kind of stumbling
[26:24] block if he can Amen to cause us to look
[26:27] and say well they don't like me or they
[26:29] don't care for us or whatever but uh
[26:33] just remember that that's just the devil
[26:35] and he's just throwing that trash out
[26:37] you might say and if we'll just step
[26:40] over it and say well maybe my brother's
[26:42] having a hard time my sister's
[26:43] struggling something uh stress or
[26:46] whatever it might be maybe the devil's
[26:48] throwing trash in front of them also
[26:51] we'll just step over and claim a high
[26:53] position in Christ Jesus amen I want to
[26:56] speak to you once again on preparation
[26:58] of the inner man amen uh just uh Lord
[27:02] just keep working on us that's all I can
[27:05] say Lord just keep working on us I want
[27:08] to speak on the topic uh uh the title
[27:12] the part or the partial or the perfect
[27:15] amen uh so we can accept uh something
[27:19] that is less than all God's got for us
[27:22] or we can settle for the perfect amen
[27:25] and I believe that uh as we look at this
[27:28] we realize that accepting or being in
[27:30] the partial is actually a part of God's
[27:33] plan that we go for season we go for a
[27:36] time and God uses that time uh to
[27:40] condition us uh some people are
[27:43] conditioned to quit that's right some
[27:46] people are conditioned to settle for for
[27:48] just a a portion a small portion and
[27:51] call that enough uh but as God's working
[27:54] on the bride of Christ he he brings her
[27:56] he's continually moving moving her he's
[27:59] he's shaping her and she's growing amen
[28:03] and as she grows in the word the prophet
[28:06] of God said when she sees who she is
[28:09] right so she see who she was from the
[28:11] very beginning he said when she sees so
[28:15] there's a there's a movement of time and
[28:18] when she sees who she is I believe she's
[28:21] already received the word and said amen
[28:23] to it but God's opening her eyes and
[28:26] we'll have it if we can get to all of it
[28:27] tonight there's a portion where God
[28:29] brings it to a season and that is the
[28:32] completion or the Fulfillment amen let's
[28:35] just stand and go right to the word this
[28:37] evening in Matthew the 5th chapter
[28:39] starting with the 43rd verse amen uh and
[28:44] uh we just want to uh use this as a
[28:47] little groundwork Matthew
[28:49] 5:43 ye have heard that it hath been
[28:53] said Thou shalt love thine neighbor and
[28:56] hate thine enemy but I say unto you love
[29:00] your enemies now Saints you know God's
[29:03] working on you you know God has got a
[29:06] hold of you when you can come to that
[29:09] place you can love your enemies bless
[29:12] them that curse you do good to them that
[29:16] hate you and pray for them which
[29:19] despitefully use you and persecute you
[29:23] now I want to just throw this in real
[29:25] quick the prayer time we know in the day
[29:27] that we live in Satan's doing everything
[29:29] he can to bind our prayer life that's
[29:31] right and you see this anointing here
[29:35] when in an age that your prayer life is
[29:37] being bound it would only make sense
[29:40] that we pray for those we
[29:44] love but you see God said I want you to
[29:46] take some of this precious prayer time
[29:49] and I want you to pray for those that
[29:51] have despitefully used you I don't care
[29:55] what they did might have been Grievous
[29:58] amen we are compelled by the word that's
[30:01] right to pray for their
[30:03] Redemption pray for them to be able to
[30:06] come and recognize amen much easier In
[30:09] the Flesh though just to condemn them
[30:12] right you're in the pit that's right but
[30:15] that's not the word amen
[30:20] amen that you may be the children of
[30:23] your father which is in heaven for he
[30:26] maketh his son to rise on the E evil and
[30:29] on the good and sendeth rain on the just
[30:32] and on the unjust for if you love them
[30:35] which love you what reward have ye do
[30:38] not even the publicans the same and if
[30:41] you salute your brethren only what do
[30:44] you more than others do not even the
[30:47] Publican so be ye therefore perfect even
[30:50] as your father which is in heaven is
[30:54] perfect Heavenly Father we ask for your
[30:56] blessings upon the word tonight
[30:58] father reveal it father in the way that
[31:01] you desire to Lord we speak this desire
[31:05] this in the precious name of Jesus
[31:07] Christ amen you may be seated now as
[31:11] we'll get along tonight we'll be
[31:13] touching on things that are perfect and
[31:15] the partial here as we are drawing this
[31:17] out of the message now my brother and
[31:21] sister uh we are cognizant and that you
[31:25] know might not be a common word uh it
[31:27] just simply means have knowledge or
[31:29] aware of we are cognizant that the
[31:32] things that the Lord ask us to do isn't
[31:35] always easy to do amen he calls us to
[31:39] make a sacrifice of this flesh he calls
[31:42] us to Die daily he calls us to uh uh not
[31:47] only to help others but to give as it
[31:49] were of a great portion amen not to be
[31:52] stingy not to be stubborn not to be
[31:56] rebellious but simply stand on that and
[31:59] as I brought up the other day I think
[32:01] God does not want us to go into the
[32:03] excuse trap of this person did something
[32:06] for me uh against me I mean you know I I
[32:09] I just there's no way I could pray for
[32:11] them no way I could this they've done
[32:13] this they've done that get away from the
[32:15] excuse trap and just simply say Lord
[32:17] your word says that I should pray for
[32:19] those who despitefully use me and make
[32:22] that a priority in your life not only as
[32:24] I've said before will it keep you soft
[32:27] but Prayer Changes Things amen and so as
[32:30] we stay away from the excuse trap uh and
[32:34] if we'll just trust and Obey he he said
[32:37] that he would make a way is that not the
[32:39] word amen he said he would make a way
[32:42] not we would make a way or we could make
[32:44] this happen but if we will allow God to
[32:47] work in our life and we trust and Obey
[32:50] he said he would make a away so it's not
[32:53] really Saints ex what we are capable of
[32:57] that's often times one of the factors
[32:59] that we weigh into is Lord I'm not
[33:02] capable of forgiving I'm not capable my
[33:05] brother and sister it's just Plum uh
[33:07] plain in the word of God that if you
[33:09] don't forgive you're not forgiven amen
[33:12] amen and people struggle with that they
[33:13] live good Godly lives but they hold on
[33:16] to something against someone and they
[33:19] justify that in their mind and and make
[33:21] statements I I could never forgive them
[33:24] well I'll tell you what you knew you
[33:25] need to eliminate that out of your
[33:27] vocabulary and say you know what Lord I
[33:30] I I'm not really I got such a bitter
[33:32] hurt but I'm going to allow you Lord to
[33:35] come in and keep tender washing me and
[33:38] doing you know uh sometimes you know you
[33:40] just have to put a little bit of Sav On
[33:43] that soore and and you got to keep after
[33:45] it you know to to get it to heal so we
[33:48] put the sav of the Holy Spirit of the
[33:50] word of God on our heart amen we put it
[33:53] down there and we just yield that to the
[33:55] Lord because you see it's not that we
[33:59] can do this but he through us can do it
[34:02] so it's not what we think we're capable
[34:04] of it's all about what he's capable of
[34:08] and when we deny God's ability to move
[34:12] in our life we're denying the very
[34:14] promised word of God for our day amen so
[34:18] we can't come and say Lord I I just
[34:20] never did that Lord because I wasn't
[34:23] capable what you're really saying is is
[34:26] Lord I couldn't do that because because
[34:27] I never trusted
[34:29] you because if you will trust him amen
[34:33] he'll come in well my brother and sister
[34:36] sometime he has to rip the scab off he
[34:39] got a I was talking with a brother about
[34:41] this and H sometime back sometimes you
[34:43] got you got a sword that won't heal you
[34:46] have to rip the scab off Let it bleed
[34:49] and then as it heals Let It Be purified
[34:52] and cleansed and it will heal as long as
[34:55] there's some kind of contamination in
[34:57] the healing process it will always be
[35:00] all all uh sorry for the word it's a
[35:02] little crude but all kind of and
[35:05] and whatever be oozing and and you know
[35:08] it recognize any nurse or doctor would
[35:10] look at a wound and they can recognize a
[35:12] wound that is contaminated simply
[35:15] because it is producing something that's
[35:18] not part of the healing
[35:20] process imagine that so sometimes people
[35:23] say well you know nobody sees my issue I
[35:27] guess I'm okay okay no really the issue
[35:29] is more obvious than we believe because
[35:32] it's producing something that's not part
[35:34] of the healing process amen so sometimes
[35:38] God just has to send someone in and
[35:40] they'll come and they'll preach or
[35:42] something will be said and it kind of
[35:44] rips the scab off and nobody shouts
[35:46] Hallelujah they just rip the scab
[35:50] off but you see it's part of the process
[35:53] amen so when we stop and and tonight we
[35:57] won't focus on this but we stop and look
[36:00] and we would literally start to write a
[36:02] list of what God is capable
[36:05] of I think we will find that everything
[36:08] in our life will be encompassed in that
[36:10] list we will not come to something that
[36:13] we would say well there was this need in
[36:15] my life and God was not capable my
[36:17] brother and sister he's capable of
[36:20] everything amen The Great I Am The King
[36:23] of Kings the Lord of lords the one who
[36:25] created this body knows exactly what is
[36:29] necessary to bring this body into a
[36:31] complete healing natural and spiritual
[36:35] amen so it's not about what we are
[36:37] capable hallelujah look right here in
[36:39] Jehovah Gyra now look Saints once again
[36:43] uh there is been some folks that thought
[36:44] I clipped quotes and whatever else to
[36:47] make it say what I wanted to say I'm
[36:49] sorry they feel that way I believe you
[36:51] know my heart I'm not here to play some
[36:53] kind of game or some kind of oneup thing
[36:56] but I just want this so you know
[36:58] sometimes you just pull something right
[37:00] out of something cuz you like what it
[37:01] says and this is what I did right here
[37:04] with this quote I liked what it said
[37:06] Jehovah Gyra now notice Abraham just an
[37:10] ordinary man is there any Ordinary
[37:13] People here tonight amen so we are on an
[37:16] even plane right now with Abraham oh
[37:19] think about it just an ordinary man but
[37:22] God by um anybody elected here tonight
[37:26] amen by election H anybody experience
[37:30] Sovereign Grace Hallelujah now what I'm
[37:33] trying to tell you is is Abraham wasn't
[37:36] something that was Out Of Reach for you
[37:40] now God didn't call you and I to be
[37:42] Abraham but he didn't call Abraham to be
[37:45] you either that's right think about that
[37:49] hallelujah amen Hebrews amen that they
[37:53] without us oh
[37:56] Hallelujah think about it you see
[37:59] they're waiting there's the cheering
[38:01] section you can do it brother you can do
[38:03] it sister stand on the word We need
[38:08] youen oh hallelujah we're down here Le
[38:11] to see a poor us of all the ages that we
[38:15] could have been in why' we have to be in
[38:16] this wicked
[38:18] time well every age recognize the
[38:21] wickedness of their day amen Sons and
[38:24] Daughters of God every age recognize the
[38:26] wickedness of their day it's really no
[38:29] different God equipped them God has
[38:32] equipped us
[38:34] hallelujah so by Sovereign Grace he
[38:37] called amen I put the he in there
[38:39] because we're talking about God he
[38:41] called Abraham nobody else
[38:44] did when there's many young men in the
[38:47] land in that day that was probably some
[38:50] more capable of doing the
[38:53] job why Abraham Lord I just can't do
[38:57] this
[38:58] I I want to be part of the Bride of this
[39:00] age Lord I Want To Live an overcoming
[39:03] life but Lord I mean look there's so
[39:06] many
[39:08] H H let's go on a capable
[39:12] hunt you're going to find people that
[39:15] are stronger smarter faster more
[39:19] intelligent come on Saints you'll find a
[39:22] list of people that will outshine you in
[39:25] fact the prophet of God said that in
[39:28] Zeal in this last hour in Zeal the uh uh
[39:31] make believe bride I'll put it that way
[39:34] will show a more abundant Zeal than the
[39:37] bride of Christ it's a quote that's
[39:39] right they'll have more Zeal so you're
[39:41] looking at us saying well you know look
[39:43] at them they're so excited they're doing
[39:45] this they're doing this they're doing
[39:46] this doing this I don't mean one single
[39:49] thing
[39:52] amen there was probably some more
[39:54] capable of doing the job as the world
[39:56] would think than Abraham was but God
[40:00] knows the man's intelligence his
[40:03] strength
[40:04] his
[40:06] Hallelujah he knows the heart and the
[40:10] heart that's here saying Lord I want
[40:12] your word Lord I Want to Be Like You
[40:15] Lord mold me make me Lord Wash Me
[40:19] prepare me Lord fill me with oil amen
[40:23] hallelujah he's looking for that kind of
[40:25] heart he can take any old kind of person
[40:27] to do the job reminds me of a friend of
[40:30] mine when I was growing up his
[40:32] grandfather this friend of mine was a
[40:34] quite strong kid we were very close in
[40:36] age so there was no difference there but
[40:39] I I think in my childhood he had to been
[40:41] at least twice as strong as I was
[40:43] everything I could do he could do it
[40:45] just twice as good but I remember you
[40:47] know sometimes this is just an
[40:49] intellectual thing so please don't
[40:50] misunder understand me but one time uh I
[40:53] I I was helping my friend uh do some
[40:56] stuff for his Grand father his
[40:58] grandfather was quite I don't know what
[41:00] you call a a a small man I mean I would
[41:02] say petite but I think of that as as uh
[41:05] you know to a lady but he was quite a
[41:07] small man just not great physical
[41:09] strength and one day we were doing this
[41:11] work and my my friend was doing this
[41:13] stuff and finally the grandfather
[41:15] stopped him and he says you know he said
[41:18] you ought to think about using your mind
[41:20] and not just your
[41:26] back yeah
[41:28] amen so my brother and sister when God
[41:32] come along he says what I want you to do
[41:36] is I want you to give me your heart not
[41:39] your mind see he wasn't he wasn't asking
[41:41] for I don't want your physical strength
[41:44] I don't want your
[41:46] mind I want your
[41:50] heart oh Lord that's right Lord wash me
[41:54] make my heart tender make it soft make
[41:57] it yield to you Lord I I want my heart
[41:59] to be the kind of Heart Right David was
[42:01] a man after God's own
[42:05] mind no after God's Own Heart amen that
[42:11] was the identifier that God used he said
[42:14] he's after my own Heart Lord hallelujah
[42:18] so you know I just put this in here
[42:20] because you see I think that puts it
[42:22] there's a lot more capable out here but
[42:25] that's not what God's looking for
[42:27] Hallelujah now we're going to start into
[42:29] a unique uh thought here be and we'll go
[42:31] as far as we can tonight uh because I
[42:34] have just this incredible amount of
[42:36] stuff out of the church age book that
[42:38] just has really struck me so we're going
[42:40] to kind of skip pretty fast through it
[42:42] uh if you don't mind till we come to
[42:44] some key points amen so Revelations 3:7
[42:47] to the angel of the Church of
[42:48] Philadelphia right these things saith he
[42:51] that is Holy he that is true he that is
[42:53] the Key of David he that openeth and no
[42:55] man shutteth and shutteth and no man
[42:57] openeth oh how beautiful are those words
[43:00] How Majestic is even the sound of them
[43:03] how thrilling to think that all those
[43:05] attributes can be applied to one person
[43:08] who would dare to say such things about
[43:11] himself but Jesus Christ the lord of
[43:13] Glory yet we see in the day that we're
[43:15] living there's men who actually boast of
[43:17] these kind of attributes and things of
[43:20] their own tell you what I have done amen
[43:23] I believe the key to interpreting
[43:25] exactly what each of these wonderfully
[43:26] descripted phrases mean is found in
[43:29] verse 9 behold I will make them of the
[43:31] synagogue of Satan which say they are
[43:34] Jews and are not but do lie behold I
[43:36] will make them to come and worship
[43:38] before thy feet to know that I have
[43:41] loved thee amen I say this verse is key
[43:44] because it deals with the Jews who have
[43:46] always called themselves the children of
[43:48] God to the exclusion of everyone else
[43:51] they crucified and killed the Lord Jesus
[43:54] their terrible deed brought their own
[43:56] blood upon on their own heads for
[43:59] centuries all because they refused Jesus
[44:02] as their Messiah which indeed he was to
[44:05] them he was not the coming one or the
[44:07] son of David to them he was be elub or
[44:10] some unrighteous one fit only for
[44:13] Destruction but not so now I want you to
[44:16] just insert here Saints isn't this
[44:18] beautiful how the plan of God said I
[44:21] want to open the door to those who were
[44:25] not but now
[44:28] are how wonderfully God opened that door
[44:31] for you and I amen look at The Strife
[44:35] that come to the Apostle Paul because he
[44:38] asserted against the will of even uh uh
[44:41] other Apostles that we are going to go
[44:44] preach this gospel to the
[44:47] Gentiles not just convert amongst the
[44:49] Jews but this is a gospel that belongs
[44:53] to every man woman boy and girl you see
[44:57] so if you want to take the backstory
[44:59] it's much deeper than we would recognize
[45:01] because see he's proving amen not only
[45:04] to the Jews will it come and one day
[45:06] they will come and look Saints this is
[45:08] just the way it is this is the word we
[45:10] won't go into the explanation tonight
[45:12] but you look at this my brother and
[45:14] sister the Jews when that comes those
[45:16] two prophets stand in their presence and
[45:19] are speaking the word to them and that
[45:21] day and they recognize and they ask him
[45:24] uh how did you get those scars and he
[45:26] tells them I got them in the house of my
[45:28] friends they're going to be preaching
[45:31] this same message it is not another
[45:34] message to the Jews it is the same
[45:38] message amen that is why my brother and
[45:40] sister I stand so firm that we need to
[45:43] identify the message as not a message of
[45:46] a certain man of a certain age but we
[45:49] need to identify the message as Jesus
[45:52] Christ because this message is going to
[45:55] go back to the Jews
[45:57] won't be about even a prophet to the
[46:00] Gentiles or a prophet to the age it will
[46:02] be about identifying Jesus Christ in
[46:06] their midst amen now you know where I
[46:09] stand on that there'll be some if they
[46:10] go ahead and listen will say whoa I
[46:12] don't like what he's saying but my
[46:14] brother and sister it quite simply this
[46:16] has to be the great as it were sign that
[46:20] is pointing to Jesus Christ hallelujah
[46:25] amen
[46:29] but not so he was indeed Emmanuel God
[46:32] manifest In the Flesh he is indeed
[46:34] Messiah surely he was exactly as he now
[46:37] sets himself forth to be there he is the
[46:42] same Jesus Jesus Christ the same
[46:45] yesterday today and forever a holy one
[46:48] in the midst of the Lamb stands is the
[46:51] very same Jesus who walked the shores of
[46:54] Galilee do you see we get this that some
[46:57] people get confused it's like you know
[46:59] here's the thing well no no you you you
[47:02] you're making a mistake Paul because um
[47:05] no you're saying God is in us but that's
[47:07] the Holy Spirit but the prophet of God
[47:10] shows us clearly through the word it's
[47:12] all God so if you are talking about
[47:15] Jesus Christ you are talking about Lord
[47:18] Christ Alone however you want to word
[47:20] this holy spirit it's all God Amen and
[47:25] he come right down to to express himself
[47:28] in US brother Jason Watkins used this
[47:31] little phrase the other day amen he said
[47:33] God wants to get in your car amen
[47:37] hallelujah he wasn't talking about a
[47:39] literal automobile he was talking about
[47:42] you and I he wants to get in your car
[47:45] and go do the work that he needs done he
[47:48] needs someone to go over here and share
[47:50] the gospel he gets in your car
[47:53] Hallelujah I used it with a zipper and
[47:55] stepping inside however you want to
[47:58] express it it's all God hallelujah we're
[48:01] not here trying to chop him up and
[48:03] identify which part of him did this and
[48:05] which part did that and you got to have
[48:07] this pronoun and this adjective and
[48:09] whatever nonsense my brother and sister
[48:12] let's recognize it's Jesus Christ the
[48:14] same yesterday today and forever that
[48:17] Holy One in the midst of the land stamps
[48:19] is the very same Jesus who walked on the
[48:23] shores of Galilee who healed the sick
[48:25] who raised the Dead and in spite of the
[48:28] irrefutable proof was crucified and
[48:30] killed but he rose again and is Seated
[48:33] on the right hand of the Majesty on
[48:35] highs the Jews did not call him holy
[48:38] then they do not call him holy now but
[48:42] he is the Holy One psalm 16:10 for Thou
[48:47] shalt not leave my soul in Hell neither
[48:48] will thou suffer thine Holy One to see
[48:51] corruption now you look at that my
[48:53] brother and sister I just want to bring
[48:55] this about there's some things here Lord
[48:57] help me to get to them tonight amen they
[48:59] sought their righteousness after the law
[49:03] and fail
[49:04] miserably have any of you been
[49:07] successful no we can't live it out under
[49:10] the law because what happens when we try
[49:12] to live it under the law we live it in
[49:15] such a strictness that when we come face
[49:18] to face with that our Humanity fails us
[49:21] and then all we can do is look in the
[49:22] mirror of our interpretation of the word
[49:25] and say I'm a failure
[49:27] Hallelujah that's a conclusion I don't
[49:29] care how bias anyone is amen look at
[49:32] some of these monks and some of these
[49:34] people they sleep on Stone
[49:37] beds because they're going to make that
[49:39] kind of sacrifice for
[49:41] God I read uh the writings of a man who
[49:45] had spent many many years as a monk and
[49:47] it wasn't until he was dying of
[49:50] something that was quite easy to fix and
[49:52] he had done a little secret research and
[49:54] realized he was dying and would die uh
[49:58] because he simply was what he was taught
[50:00] to refuse any other kind of help and
[50:03] something in him was crying out and so
[50:06] he he left the monastery went and went
[50:10] to a clinic they said you're a very sick
[50:13] man they sent him off to a hospital well
[50:15] at that moment right there they had
[50:17] kicked him out he was no longer part of
[50:19] the program you didn't line up to our
[50:22] law you're
[50:24] out but it was in the hospital or the
[50:27] recovery of that that somebody witnessed
[50:28] to him of Jesus
[50:30] Christ and we're not into this my heart
[50:32] said my heart felt but something inside
[50:35] of him said this is real oh my and we
[50:41] would say oh the poor man got sick no
[50:43] his sickness was actually you might say
[50:46] his
[50:47] salvation Hallelujah now salvation as we
[50:50] know was Jesus Christ but that's what
[50:53] put him in the position for someone to
[50:55] tell him what you're doing
[50:57] is
[50:58] works and it's failing right that's
[51:03] right 1 Corinthians
[51:06] 1:30 oh by the law no man can be made
[51:11] holy let me jump back they sought their
[51:13] righteousness after the law and failed
[51:15] miserably for by the law can no flesh be
[51:18] justified by the law can no man be made
[51:20] holy Holiness is of the Lord 1
[51:23] Corinthians 1:30 but of him are ye in
[51:26] Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us
[51:29] wisdom and righteousness and
[51:31] sanctification and Redemption am now
[51:34] look when we look into this and here
[51:36] again it's just one of these things I'm
[51:37] going to hang out here my brother and
[51:39] sister the whole plan of the seventh
[51:42] seal can be boiled down if you had no
[51:44] other simple words or no other words to
[51:46] put it it is the manifested Plan of
[51:50] Redemption amen it was the whole
[51:52] Redemption that God had planned brought
[51:54] forth in this hour coming to a
[51:57] completeness or a fullness the prophet
[51:59] hid it in these simple words when he
[52:01] said everything you need for the Rapture
[52:05] is already in you Hallelujah he just
[52:09] gave you the seven seal in a nutshell
[52:12] everything you need amen God's already
[52:15] gave it to you just let it be manifested
[52:18] let the word come forth let it come to
[52:20] life Give It Room to Grow amen remind me
[52:24] one time we was at some people's house
[52:26] and and there was a tree there and there
[52:28] was other believers there and one of
[52:30] them said this is really weird this
[52:32] looks like an oak tree and and here's a
[52:35] tree in this in this pot and it's all
[52:38] nicely groomed and whatever but it's
[52:39] this little small tree and he said this
[52:42] looks like an oak tree but you know um
[52:44] it it can't be an oak tree and they said
[52:46] no it is an oak tree and it'll never
[52:48] grow any bigger than that because it has
[52:50] no place for its roots to
[52:53] go hallelujah amen want you to think
[52:56] about it God's opening the word what's
[52:59] he doing brother Trevor he's giv Our
[53:01] Roots a place to go amen he's opening
[53:04] more word and our roots are just growing
[53:07] and the wind is blowing and unbelief is
[53:09] shaking and darkness is on the Earth but
[53:11] God get us and he's letting Our Roots
[53:13] grow and all the word is being open to
[53:16] the bride and what's already in her is
[53:19] now being manifested and coming forth if
[53:21] she'd have been locked in that little
[53:23] pot she would have never have got it but
[53:26] God said I'll put you in a place by the
[53:28] rivers oh of Living Water and in that
[53:32] your roots are going to chop into that
[53:34] and you're going to grow grow grow and
[53:36] drink drink drink and push out push out
[53:38] push out hallelujah oh yeah oh wait I
[53:42] I'm not preaching deep enough am I
[53:45] hallelujah oh
[53:47] my 2 Corinthians 5:21 second part he
[53:50] said that we might be made the
[53:51] righteousness of God in him it was
[53:53] Christ or perish and they perish for
[53:56] their ref used him and Men of that age
[53:58] as even today were making the same
[54:00] mistake as the Jews took refuge in the
[54:03] synagogue form of worship so in the
[54:05] Philadelphian age they were taking
[54:07] refuge in the church and it is not
[54:09] joining a church that counts right oh
[54:13] come on Saints that thing is creeping
[54:14] right back in the message you need to
[54:17] belong to this movement if you're going
[54:18] to make a Rapture I'll tell you what I
[54:21] got an answer for that I need to belong
[54:23] to Jesus Christ and Christ Alone amen no
[54:27] building no name no identification but
[54:30] Christ alone and any other idea that is
[54:33] being pedal my brother and sister is a
[54:35] deception because it's not in the church
[54:38] we go to church the word says not to
[54:41] forsake the assembling of ourselves
[54:43] together but our real true assembling is
[54:46] not in a body and saying our refuge is
[54:50] this body it's the body of Jesus Christ
[54:53] that has become our refuge Hallelujah
[54:57] amen so we're not going to go back to a
[54:59] synagogue form of worship so in the
[55:02] Philadelphian age they were taking
[55:03] refuge in the church it's not joining a
[55:06] church that counts the life is not in
[55:08] the church the life is in Christ but
[55:13] I'll tell you what we can put Christ
[55:14] right here in this building we can make
[55:17] him welcome welcome the door can be open
[55:19] and we can come to the house of God and
[55:21] go home and say I felt the presence of
[55:24] God Amen but you come into into this
[55:26] building angry you come into this
[55:28] building backslid you come into this
[55:30] building you might not feel a single
[55:32] thing amen hallelujah this building
[55:34] won't do it for you that's
[55:39] right the life is in Christ this is the
[55:42] record that God hath given us to us
[55:45] eternal life and this life is in his son
[55:48] he that hath the son hath life and he
[55:50] that hath not the son hath not life man
[55:55] is made holy by the spirit it is the
[55:57] spirit of Holiness that raised Jesus
[55:59] from the dead that indwells us and makes
[56:02] us holy with his Holiness oh my look at
[56:05] that do we believe these words were
[56:08] anointed Spirit of Holiness yes oh my my
[56:14] brother and sister Humanity's got a lot
[56:16] of things that influences it Holiness is
[56:19] a spirit we can say I believe the
[56:23] message and not have the spirit of
[56:26] Holiness that's right that's the
[56:29] difference of people borderline dressing
[56:32] borderline living amen right the spirit
[56:37] of Holiness
[56:38] missing right I'll just be a little more
[56:40] blunt that's what would cause a
[56:42] sister to step in front of the mirror
[56:45] before she walks out the door of her
[56:46] house and to say what image am I
[56:50] presenting that's right not the preacher
[56:53] yeah the preacher is talking about it
[56:54] right now but I'm here to encourage you
[56:56] not the preacher saying well you can't
[56:58] do this you can't do that it's Christ in
[57:00] you putting you in front of the mirror
[57:03] saying Lord I want to present myself a
[57:05] certain way now brothers are not exempt
[57:07] brothers and sisters I I'll just be
[57:09] blunt with you I I'm just not much for
[57:11] brothers running around with their
[57:12] buttons all undone and and part of their
[57:14] chest that's just as exciting to a woman
[57:17] as it is a a woman is to a man I I'm
[57:20] sorry to be that blunt but that's just
[57:22] the truth of it and when people come and
[57:24] they think that it's a one-sided thing I
[57:26] want my wife to look like this and like
[57:28] this and then they're running around in
[57:29] a certain fashion that the world finds
[57:31] attractive oh my brother and sister come
[57:34] on what's good for goose is good for
[57:36] Gander Hallelujah we want to be holy
[57:39] amen so it's a spirit that is on us it's
[57:41] not a
[57:43] law
[57:45] amen just like we want the Holy Spirit I
[57:48] think the spirit of
[57:50] Holiness is Right tied
[57:55] together
[57:57] okay I didn't offend the church did
[57:59] I
[58:01] okay well that's right the word cannot
[58:04] offend a son or daughter of God but
[58:07] sometimes our presentation of it can be
[58:09] a little rough God help us amen this is
[58:12] the record God has given us eternal life
[58:14] and his life is in his son he that hath
[58:16] the son hath life he that hath not the
[58:18] Son of God hath not life man is made
[58:21] Holy by the spirit it is the spirit of
[58:24] Holiness that raised Jesus from the dead
[58:25] that indwell
[58:26] and makes us holy with his
[58:30] Holiness now look as I told you a lot of
[58:32] reading here but this is stuff that just
[58:34] inspired me and I believe it's got a lot
[58:36] of nuggets H just tucked right in here
[58:39] and sometimes it's good for us to just
[58:41] get down to the creek get our shoes off
[58:43] and get our toes in the sand and start
[58:45] looking for nuggets that's right I met a
[58:47] man one time he said well I I took my
[58:50] family to this certain place that you
[58:51] know they used to mine for gold and and
[58:54] we're out walking through there and one
[58:56] of his kids says Daddy can we keep what
[58:58] we find and he said well honey I I guess
[59:01] that' be
[59:02] okay and his little girl says well I
[59:05] found this big fat Golden
[59:08] Rock hey sweetie give me no Daddy it's
[59:12] mine she found a gold nugget how'd she
[59:15] find it it appeared you might say
[59:18] between her toes and she squished her
[59:20] toes on it and like what is this my wife
[59:23] could do that pretty good I I would
[59:25] never be able to get get that nugget out
[59:26] of the sand and be like come on toes
[59:28] pick it up pick come on toes pay
[59:30] attention pick it up Sister Jerry she
[59:33] just I don't know there might be some of
[59:35] you like that but we're nugget digging
[59:37] it's what we're doing Saints amen we're
[59:40] not trying to find something that's just
[59:42] fits our idea but we're just through
[59:44] this word and we're finding the nuggets
[59:46] and I don't care whether it's between
[59:47] your toes or in your hand or however you
[59:48] find it just lay claim to it sir amen
[59:51] there he stands the Holy One and we will
[59:53] stand with him clothed in his right
[59:56] rightousness holy with his Holiness oh
[1:00:00] Hallelujah not our interpretation of it
[1:00:02] their terrible deed brought their own
[1:00:04] blood upon their own heads for centuries
[1:00:06] all because they refused Jesus as their
[1:00:08] Messiah which indeed he was to them he
[1:00:11] was not the coming one or the son of
[1:00:12] David to do we already read
[1:00:16] this seems like yeah seems like
[1:00:21] it yeah we
[1:00:25] did oh
[1:00:32] somehow
[1:00:34] okay okay excuse
[1:00:37] me
[1:00:39] Electronics but Jesus is a true bread
[1:00:42] from Heaven whereof Mana was just a type
[1:00:45] I think we're missing something
[1:00:47] Brothers let me go right back through
[1:00:55] here
[1:01:03] yeah I think we might have actually
[1:01:04] missed a little chunk
[1:01:07] here holy with his Holiness now in this
[1:01:09] sixth now this age is the sixth age in
[1:01:12] the eyes of God time is drawing to a
[1:01:15] close he will soon be coming back soon
[1:01:18] the cry will go forth as he comes and he
[1:01:21] which is filthy let him be filthy still
[1:01:24] and he that is righteous let him be
[1:01:26] righteous still and he that is Holy let
[1:01:28] him be holy still 11 Revelations
[1:01:32] 2211 oh I'm so glad that my Holiness is
[1:01:36] not of myself I'm glad that I'm in
[1:01:38] Christ and all his wonderful attributes
[1:01:41] of righteousness imputed yeah imparted
[1:01:44] unto me blessed be God forever these
[1:01:47] things saith he that is true now this
[1:01:50] word true is a very wonderful word it
[1:01:54] does not mean true in just the sense
[1:01:56] that it is the opposite to false it
[1:02:00] expresses the perfect realization of an
[1:02:04] idea as contrasted with the partial
[1:02:09] realization you get that Hallelujah a uh
[1:02:13] perfect realization as contrasted with a
[1:02:17] partial realization now my brother and
[1:02:19] sister want to just speak this real
[1:02:21] blunt to those that might hear this
[1:02:22] otherwise I'm not here to offend anyone
[1:02:24] but my brother and sister a lot of
[1:02:26] people say I got a revelation of the
[1:02:28] message well if you have a partial
[1:02:31] Revelation and you decide that is the
[1:02:34] full Revelation you're not looking for
[1:02:36] more but if you come and say Lord I want
[1:02:39] all that you would choose to reveal to
[1:02:42] me Lord please I want to be in a
[1:02:45] position that you would choose amen the
[1:02:48] atmosphere that kind of uh approach to
[1:02:51] the word of God which means as a prophet
[1:02:53] I read you this quote the other day when
[1:02:55] God is going to ask you to do something
[1:02:58] special God wants a complete surrender
[1:03:02] amen amen he's not going to use you to
[1:03:04] do something special if you're still
[1:03:06] operating on your own operating system
[1:03:10] amen he wants you to operate on his amen
[1:03:14] expresses a perfect realization of an
[1:03:16] idea as contrasted with its partial
[1:03:20] realization for example recall that
[1:03:22] Jesus said in John 6:32 Moses gave you
[1:03:26] not that bread from heaven but my father
[1:03:28] giveth you the true bread from Heaven
[1:03:30] amen so you look at that Moses gave them
[1:03:33] bread but we want the god that is in
[1:03:37] heaven Jehovah Gyra the provider to
[1:03:41] bring us this bread from heaven we are
[1:03:44] not looking for a substitute we're not
[1:03:47] looking for bread as it were Mana in the
[1:03:49] wilderness we're wanting the bread of
[1:03:51] Revelation for this hour hallelujah
[1:03:55] we're not looking back see people get
[1:03:56] upset my brother and sister I'll just
[1:03:58] tell you right now not prophesying but
[1:04:00] I'm telling you there'll come a Great
[1:04:02] Divide in the message I believe myself
[1:04:05] that there will be two great divides in
[1:04:07] the message one of them will surround
[1:04:09] marriage and
[1:04:14] divorce and one of them will surround
[1:04:18] Revelation in the
[1:04:23] message now revelation in the message my
[1:04:26] brother and
[1:04:27] sister will be where this
[1:04:30] bread comes
[1:04:36] from one side is saying if you're not in
[1:04:39] the tapes the tapes only so becoming
[1:04:42] very strong
[1:04:43] voice if you're not just playing the
[1:04:45] tapes if you are listening to five-fold
[1:04:47] Ministry they're the ones that are the
[1:04:52] problem it's not what my Bible
[1:04:54] says
[1:04:56] no I'm not I'm not boosting the preacher
[1:04:58] Saints I think the preachers need
[1:05:00] scrutinize with a 10,000 power
[1:05:02] microscope and they better be able to
[1:05:04] back up what they got to say but to come
[1:05:06] along and make a statement that if
[1:05:08] you're going to make the Rapture you got
[1:05:10] to get away from the preacher is
[1:05:12] contrary to the book of Ephesians and
[1:05:15] when you go contrary to the word of God
[1:05:17] it don't matter who you are and to what
[1:05:19] degree you go
[1:05:21] contrary amen it's not just what well I
[1:05:25] they didn't go very very far my brother
[1:05:27] and sister it says one
[1:05:29] word let them be
[1:05:31] accursed well Hallelujah I'm brother so
[1:05:34] and so and I'm cursed as a minister but
[1:05:35] I want to preach to you
[1:05:37] tonight no none of us would said for
[1:05:39] that but I believe you're going to see
[1:05:41] this you say why did you say marriage
[1:05:43] and divorce brother Paul because that is
[1:05:45] a sign when marriage and divorce becomes
[1:05:47] a common just uh uh uh uh bantered
[1:05:50] around no big deal we can circumvent it
[1:05:53] thing in the message that means that
[1:05:54] it's been comp rised on the word and so
[1:05:57] it isn't confined just to marriage and
[1:05:59] divorce but it's a very very prominent
[1:06:02] indicator of someone who says uh we can
[1:06:05] change the message we can change the
[1:06:07] gospel and everything is still all right
[1:06:10] oh come on I know that's kind of
[1:06:12] straight preaching Saints but I'm
[1:06:13] telling you that the deceiving of the
[1:06:15] elect is not possible because the
[1:06:18] Prophet come all the way back in the
[1:06:20] beginning that was right there in his
[1:06:22] message and carried all the way through
[1:06:24] when he said take get back to the word
[1:06:28] don't settle for anything but the word
[1:06:31] why you take it back to the word it has
[1:06:33] nothing about confirming brother
[1:06:35] brandham as a prophet it's all about you
[1:06:38] and I looking at the road map reading
[1:06:41] the road map following the road map and
[1:06:44] the road map says this Lord I'm not
[1:06:46] going to come over here and say but you
[1:06:48] really must have meant
[1:06:50] this amen I don't care whose fingers it
[1:06:53] slaps in the door I don't care whose
[1:06:56] face gets hit in the door my brother and
[1:06:59] sister we step off the word of God and
[1:07:01] we'll if I can get myself going here
[1:07:03] we'll touch on that in just a minute
[1:07:04] they do not call him holy now but he is
[1:07:06] a Holy One amen I just want to make that
[1:07:08] point you see what is it my brother and
[1:07:10] sister he is the Holy One there's
[1:07:13] nothing else now look in this contrast
[1:07:16] as brother Brown's bringing out of
[1:07:17] perfect realization so we're looking at
[1:07:20] this he's saying uh Moses gave you this
[1:07:22] bread but my father gives you this bread
[1:07:24] and then in John 151 said I am the True
[1:07:28] Vine he's standing right there making a
[1:07:30] declaration open your eyes look I am the
[1:07:33] True Vine amen Hebrews 9:24 for Christ
[1:07:38] is not entered into the holy places made
[1:07:40] with hands which are the figures of the
[1:07:43] true but into heaven itself now to
[1:07:45] appear in the presence of God for us
[1:07:48] amen look at this it's becoming clear
[1:07:52] it's becoming clear it's no longer a a
[1:07:55] partial
[1:07:56] understanding no longer a partial Vision
[1:07:58] no longer a partial seeing what this
[1:08:00] message is we're starting to see that
[1:08:03] that glass that was dark is clearing up
[1:08:06] for the bride of Christ amen it's not
[1:08:09] going to remain dark where the bride is
[1:08:11] just hoping she's just trying she's just
[1:08:14] dreaming of my brother and sister it's a
[1:08:17] vision that's opening before her and she
[1:08:20] realized she's part of the
[1:08:23] vision in fact she is the vision because
[1:08:27] the vision come from Heaven come from
[1:08:28] our Lord Jesus Christ amen and the bride
[1:08:31] is the manifestation of that
[1:08:35] wife oh
[1:08:38] Hallelujah the manifestation of
[1:08:40] Revelations 196 and 7 is sitting some of
[1:08:44] it right here in this church tonight the
[1:08:47] Fulfillment of that word we can reach
[1:08:49] out take a hold of that and say Lord
[1:08:51] there I am I'm identified your wife
[1:08:54] that's me Lord
[1:08:56] is making herself
[1:08:57] ready hallelujah oh what do we got to do
[1:09:01] brother Paul dig real deep in the word
[1:09:02] no you got to stay soft and tender you
[1:09:05] got to stay when the holy spirit says
[1:09:07] move you can move when he says stop he
[1:09:10] can stop when he says pray for that or
[1:09:12] talk to that person you can say Lord I'm
[1:09:14] out of my comfort zone but
[1:09:17] nevertheless nevertheless Lord I'm
[1:09:19] throwing the net in cuz that might be a
[1:09:22] Son of God might be a daughter of God
[1:09:25] I'll I'll just do what you ask Lord
[1:09:27] people look at you like you weirdo no
[1:09:30] problem there's weirdos
[1:09:32] everywhere Allelujah if you want to know
[1:09:35] about that just go look it up in the
[1:09:37] message search what brother Brown says
[1:09:38] about
[1:09:39] nuts Hallelujah everybody's a nut for
[1:09:42] something Hallelujah so we can be a nut
[1:09:45] for this world Amen oh
[1:09:48] Hallelujah yeah or a nut for the word
[1:09:51] that's right now going on here 1 John
[1:09:54] 2:8 also another representation of that
[1:09:57] because the
[1:10:00] darkness the darkness is passed and the
[1:10:06] True Light now shineth look at that
[1:10:09] Saints we can stand right on that that
[1:10:11] ought to just I'm just speaking this
[1:10:13] figuratively ought to just Propel us to
[1:10:15] our feet and we ought to be able to
[1:10:16] shout hallelujah the darkness is past
[1:10:19] I've been brought the light is shining
[1:10:22] on me oh Hallelujah when Millions are
[1:10:25] still in Gross darkness and God gives
[1:10:27] you light that is something to get
[1:10:29] excited about oh
[1:10:32] hallelujah oh since this word indeed
[1:10:35] expresses perfect realization as against
[1:10:38] the idea of partial realization as
[1:10:40] Illustrated in these verses we can Now
[1:10:43] understand as never before anti-type
[1:10:46] contrasted with type and the substance
[1:10:49] with Shadow take the example now of Mana
[1:10:53] from Heaven God sent down Angel bread
[1:10:55] from Heaven to Israel but that bread did
[1:10:57] not satisfy it it was only good for a
[1:10:59] day that's sometimes the way preaching
[1:11:01] is when the devil gets on us that's
[1:11:02] right I say this jokingly but serious
[1:11:06] walk out of church did the pastor preach
[1:11:08] about I don't know I can't
[1:11:12] remember just Mana for a
[1:11:16] day but not to be
[1:11:19] harsh sometimes the very next morning
[1:11:22] you wake up and it's like you you've
[1:11:25] been taken back in time and the word
[1:11:28] speaks to you and you say praise the
[1:11:31] Lord or maybe the very next day or two
[1:11:33] or three you're at work and something
[1:11:35] happens God's already fortified you and
[1:11:38] right then you felt bad because somebody
[1:11:40] said what' your pastor preach on um the
[1:11:45] Bible but it might be on Tuesday at work
[1:11:49] that word comes back alive to you and
[1:11:51] speaks to you Rises right up and you say
[1:11:53] oh praise the Lord
[1:11:55] praise the lord we are just
[1:11:58] human but sometimes our attention span
[1:12:01] you know I can remember years ago you
[1:12:02] might find this kind of sad but
[1:12:05] funny I was sitting in church I wasn't
[1:12:08] really serving the
[1:12:09] lord I just started
[1:12:12] farming a lot of lot of sacrifice a lot
[1:12:15] of old equipment one time I had a
[1:12:18] machine that just wouldn't work right
[1:12:21] and I remember I was sitting in church
[1:12:24] one Sunday morning
[1:12:26] I wasn't listening to the preacher I'm
[1:12:27] sad to admit that now that doesn't give
[1:12:30] you an excuse to pull revenge on
[1:12:34] me but the solution to my problem came
[1:12:37] to me right in
[1:12:38] church Hallelujah and somebody thought
[1:12:41] well maybe God's working on
[1:12:44] Paul it wasn't until years later I
[1:12:46] realized that was God just giv a little
[1:12:49] gift to me I was awall in church but he
[1:12:52] still gave me a little gift and said I
[1:12:55] I'm here for you buddy I'm here for you
[1:12:58] Lord H
[1:13:00] Hallelujah I would recommend though that
[1:13:02] when we go to church we think about
[1:13:04] church amen not about the barbecue and
[1:13:07] not about time at the park not about
[1:13:09] time here and time there and what we did
[1:13:11] wrong and what we're going to do right
[1:13:14] just kind of focus amen create the
[1:13:16] atmosphere
[1:13:18] amen it was all good for a day and those
[1:13:21] who ate it were hungry again the next
[1:13:23] day it was left around it become
[1:13:25] contaminated but Jesus is the true bread
[1:13:28] from Heaven whereof the Mana was just a
[1:13:31] type and if any man eats of that bread
[1:13:33] that came from Heaven he will never
[1:13:35] hunger again he does not need to come
[1:13:38] back and eat again the moment he partake
[1:13:40] he had eternal life here indeed was
[1:13:44] reality not no need any longer for a
[1:13:48] shadow oh my brother and sister you know
[1:13:50] brother brandom preached you know that
[1:13:52] he's a type and Shadow preacher now I
[1:13:54] want you to to take this right here you
[1:13:56] may say brother Paul you're walking way
[1:13:57] out on that limb but I want you to take
[1:13:58] this my brother and sister brother brand
[1:14:00] I'm talking about being a type and
[1:14:02] Shadow preacher there Comes a Day the
[1:14:05] shadow went away because we saw what he
[1:14:10] was pointing to that became real to us
[1:14:15] what he had to do is take this that was
[1:14:17] such a great nugget a great treasure but
[1:14:20] we couldn't understand it and he had to
[1:14:22] bring it back in an element where we
[1:14:23] could look at it and say you know what
[1:14:25] he's talking about is how my life is
[1:14:27] what he's talking about is my
[1:14:29] relationship with God he's talking about
[1:14:31] something that's down in my heart that I
[1:14:33] can't really figure out how to what to
[1:14:34] do with
[1:14:37] this and then all of a sudden the
[1:14:40] reality of the Shadow come to life and
[1:14:44] we went wow I believe that and I'm going
[1:14:47] to make a statement I I hope this isn't
[1:14:52] incorrect but did you know that the
[1:14:54] seven seal was revealed in you before
[1:14:58] your mind understood the concept of
[1:15:04] it and then people come along and say
[1:15:07] the seventh seal is
[1:15:10] closed you know what it's saying you
[1:15:12] know what the anointing is I don't have
[1:15:15] a revelation of my Redemption
[1:15:19] amen but to the bride of Christ she has
[1:15:22] that Revelation because she's been
[1:15:24] living The Plan of Redemption she's been
[1:15:27] living it it's not something she stored
[1:15:30] up here it's something that have come
[1:15:32] down in the heart and God says oh I'm
[1:15:37] not going to choose you because you're
[1:15:39] capable of the seventh seal
[1:15:43] exactly I'm going to choose you because
[1:15:47] your heart will receive it and manifest
[1:15:51] it oh
[1:15:53] Hallelujah yeah
[1:15:55] yes
[1:15:58] amen if a man eats that bread and came
[1:16:00] from Heaven he'll never hunger again he
[1:16:02] does not need to come back and eat again
[1:16:04] the moment he partook he had eternal
[1:16:06] life here indeed was reality no need any
[1:16:09] longer for a shadow no need for partial
[1:16:13] salvation here is the whole of it oh my
[1:16:17] brother and sister I'm afraid I'm going
[1:16:19] to speak a little blunt tonight we got a
[1:16:21] lot of people around the message that
[1:16:22] got a partial Revelation a partial
[1:16:25] salvation of it I'm not looking for
[1:16:27] partial I'm looking for the fullness
[1:16:30] amen I'm looking for every bit of this
[1:16:33] word for this hour that God ordained for
[1:16:36] me Hallelujah and I'm going to tell you
[1:16:38] it's probably a lot more than I
[1:16:40] understand right now and just like Jesus
[1:16:43] isn't a part of
[1:16:45] God he is
[1:16:47] God hallelujah ain't that good now I
[1:16:51] need to hurry because I'm quickly
[1:16:53] running out of time but we're going to
[1:16:55] go right here and jump right into this
[1:16:57] this is okay tonight amen I know this is
[1:17:00] a little different but uh just these
[1:17:02] things went together and I just had to I
[1:17:04] had to do my best of time together he is
[1:17:06] a sovereign God we can say Amen by his
[1:17:09] own counsel he purposed The Plan of
[1:17:11] Salvation of his own elect which he
[1:17:14] fornew the son died upon the cross to
[1:17:16] establish the means of Salvation and the
[1:17:19] Holy Spirit carefully executes the will
[1:17:21] of the father I like that I love it when
[1:17:24] when you have a business plan that you
[1:17:27] come and it starts out and as you
[1:17:30] execute this and you do you see this has
[1:17:33] already provided for this this provides
[1:17:35] for this this provides for this this
[1:17:38] provides for this
[1:17:41] Hallelujah you can build a house without
[1:17:43] a
[1:17:45] foundation come
[1:17:47] on but you're not doing it right that's
[1:17:50] right you need a foundation amen you
[1:17:52] need a rim seal you need floor joist
[1:17:55] you need decking you need two fours or
[1:17:57] two sixes for the walls amen hallelujah
[1:18:01] have a beautiful house it's a big house
[1:18:02] open air housee I have no
[1:18:04] sighting I don't want to live in your
[1:18:07] house January I don't want to visit your
[1:18:09] house Hallelujah so we got to have
[1:18:12] everything in its proper place
[1:18:14] Hallelujah and you can do a most
[1:18:16] beautiful house I I had a friend uh a
[1:18:19] guy I'd call a friend one time made this
[1:18:20] mistake Saints and it was it was sad it
[1:18:22] was very costly and it was very sad and
[1:18:25] and he was doing a lot of the work
[1:18:26] himself and he got all excited got the
[1:18:28] house all sheeted all framed in put the
[1:18:30] windows on it uh put the siding on it
[1:18:33] had tar paper this back in the days when
[1:18:35] there wasn't all these nice synthetic
[1:18:36] Felts that that are tougher than tough
[1:18:39] and he had tar paper on the roof and
[1:18:41] then he got all focused and he got
[1:18:42] inside the house and wired it and
[1:18:44] insulated it and drywalled it and taped
[1:18:46] it and textured it and painted it and
[1:18:48] then he thought well we're this far did
[1:18:50] the kitchen did the bathrooms did the
[1:18:52] carpet and then a storm come that ripped
[1:18:55] all of the tar paper off of the roof and
[1:18:58] rained and rained and rained and rained
[1:19:02] and rained and all of that run right
[1:19:06] down through the cracks and destroyed
[1:19:09] all of his
[1:19:12] labor and the insurance said no we won't
[1:19:15] cover it because it was not an act of
[1:19:19] God it was basically a failure to do the
[1:19:25] correct things amen
[1:19:28] H by his own he purposed a plan which he
[1:19:32] forne son died upon the cross to
[1:19:35] establish the
[1:19:36] means God got it all in order he didn't
[1:19:40] come along and say okay now I got these
[1:19:41] people over here I got this whole group
[1:19:43] of people I I've never redeemed them no
[1:19:47] he
[1:19:49] established the Holy Spirit carefully
[1:19:51] executes the will of the father he's
[1:19:52] working all things at this moment
[1:19:54] according to to the purpose of his own
[1:19:55] will amen I don't care what kind of day
[1:19:57] you had I want you to read that again
[1:19:59] and again and again right here he is
[1:20:01] working all things amen all means just a
[1:20:05] couple right all means every single
[1:20:10] thing big and
[1:20:16] little now I want to quantify this if
[1:20:19] you fail to put the roof on it's not
[1:20:21] God's fault that's
[1:20:23] right
[1:20:25] Hallelujah that's right want you to
[1:20:27] think about it well God let this happen
[1:20:30] no putting the roof on was just as
[1:20:31] important as anything
[1:20:34] else he's right in the midst of it all
[1:20:38] you know Saints I'm sorry vent a little
[1:20:41] bit here had people tell me that if you
[1:20:44] believe that God's here that you believe
[1:20:46] peria and that you messed up but you
[1:20:49] know as I look through the message I
[1:20:51] don't know what their understanding of
[1:20:52] God being here is I honestly don't I I
[1:20:55] don't I can't see where they're coming
[1:20:56] from but the prophet says right here we
[1:20:59] believe he's a prophet
[1:21:01] right he is right in the midst of it all
[1:21:05] that's you know outside the
[1:21:09] church sorry I'm being a little
[1:21:12] factious in the midst of it all that
[1:21:14] means he's at your house not
[1:21:19] here he's in the midst of his
[1:21:22] church he
[1:21:25] amen they'd argue with you and say well
[1:21:28] that's the Holy Spirit right
[1:21:32] God come
[1:21:34] on come on he's in the midst of his
[1:21:37] church this great Creator saviorgod is
[1:21:41] Faithfully working amongst his
[1:21:44] own right now amen as a great Shepherd
[1:21:48] of the sheep his very existence is for
[1:21:52] his own that's why I made that statement
[1:21:54] earlier on that this Vision my brother
[1:21:56] and sister is the bride it's you not not
[1:21:59] anything else it's you amen because
[1:22:03] right here his very existence is for his
[1:22:06] own he loves them and cares for them His
[1:22:09] Eye Is ever upon them when the word says
[1:22:12] that your lives are HID with Christ in
[1:22:15] God it means exactly what it says I
[1:22:19] don't know about you this gets me
[1:22:21] excited when I read it it's no longer
[1:22:23] just a pagebook amen this is a beautiful
[1:22:27] broke down to my level understanding of
[1:22:30] what God is doing oh I am so glad that
[1:22:33] my God abides faithful he is true to
[1:22:35] himself he won't lie he is true to the
[1:22:38] word he will back it up he is true to us
[1:22:42] he will lose none of us but raise us up
[1:22:44] in the last day I'm glad that I'm
[1:22:47] resting in his faithfulness amen not
[1:22:50] resting Upon Our s not resting upon our
[1:22:52] strength not resting upon what we're
[1:22:55] capable
[1:22:56] of oh Hallelujah imagine if it took a
[1:22:59] SAT score to make the
[1:23:02] Rapture I'd probably just find a big
[1:23:04] bridge and jump off of
[1:23:07] it they say well you know I I looked at
[1:23:09] some deals one time and somebody said
[1:23:11] you know this is the only question I
[1:23:13] missed on the SAT test and I I I they
[1:23:16] posted the question and they can't take
[1:23:18] papers you can't take notes so they just
[1:23:20] memorized the question and wrote it down
[1:23:22] afterwards hm me and my 30 second memory
[1:23:26] that's been reduced lately to about 19
[1:23:29] seconds and I looked at it and I was
[1:23:31] like I don't even know what they're
[1:23:32] talking
[1:23:35] about I I I don't even have a
[1:23:37] clue some quantum physics logic reverse
[1:23:43] under
[1:23:46] this
[1:23:48] sorry but you know what God's SAT test
[1:23:53] for the rapture
[1:23:55] is only belief amen right it's not what
[1:23:59] you can explain that's right it's not
[1:24:01] how many people you can argue with and
[1:24:03] overcome them with your words it's not
[1:24:05] even how much scripture you can uh
[1:24:08] remember and quote how many message
[1:24:12] quotes you can quote right Hallelujah
[1:24:15] that's right Philippians 1:6 mean
[1:24:18] confidence of this very thing that he
[1:24:20] which hath begun a good work in you will
[1:24:23] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[1:24:25] he started it Hallelujah he'll finish it
[1:24:28] he is a true witness now this word true
[1:24:31] is the same word we saw back there in
[1:24:33] Revelations 3:7 remember that you will
[1:24:36] recall that it does not mean true as in
[1:24:38] contrast with false it has a richer
[1:24:41] deeper meaning by far expresses perfect
[1:24:43] realization
[1:24:48] amen H come
[1:24:53] on now back back in the Philadelphia age
[1:24:55] the coming of the Lord was drawing nigh
[1:24:57] what great love that age manifested for
[1:24:59] him it reminds me of those beautiful
[1:25:00] words of Peter 1 18 1 Peter 1 18 whom
[1:25:04] having not seen ye
[1:25:06] love in whom though now you see him not
[1:25:11] yet
[1:25:12] believing you rejoice with joy
[1:25:14] unspeakable and full of Glory oh
[1:25:17] hallelujah look at that that there
[1:25:20] there's the SAT test right there there's
[1:25:22] the SAT test Saints amen that we could
[1:25:24] take a haltz of that and say you know
[1:25:26] what God you said it I believe it and
[1:25:29] Lord you love me that's why you come I'm
[1:25:31] yours I'm already yours I'm already
[1:25:34] redeemed I may as well you know a
[1:25:35] brother one time preached made a
[1:25:37] statement over this pulpit and people
[1:25:39] just had a backfire over it and and when
[1:25:41] the brother said I'm already in the
[1:25:43] Rapture that's right whoa that's a false
[1:25:46] Doctrine oh no it isn't Saints oh
[1:25:50] hallelujah what is it Sons and Daughters
[1:25:52] of God they're a part of that great
[1:25:55] unfolding of the word and as the word is
[1:25:59] unfolding it comes to the day that it's
[1:26:01] no longer a partial realization but it
[1:26:05] becomes a complete or full realization a
[1:26:11] perfect
[1:26:13] realization and with that Revelation in
[1:26:15] our heart we know that as we live the
[1:26:18] word today and we stand on the word of
[1:26:21] God today we confess our love to our
[1:26:23] Lord Jesus Christ our bridegroom today
[1:26:26] that the Rapture is not something we
[1:26:28] look in fear of but we just know it's
[1:26:32] coming we just know as we believe and
[1:26:34] live this word that Rapture is a natural
[1:26:38] part of this word coming into a fullness
[1:26:42] or a
[1:26:43] completion Hallelujah we don't have to
[1:26:45] like oh I hope I hope I I no just have
[1:26:49] confidence in God this work I began in
[1:26:53] you is going to take you to a
[1:26:57] Rapture oh
[1:26:59] hallelujah oh I'll tell you what it
[1:27:02] ought to give a little bit of confidence
[1:27:04] in our life when we make mistakes just
[1:27:07] to say Lord I'm sorry but I'm pressing
[1:27:10] on
[1:27:11] Hallelujah perfect realization in
[1:27:14] contrast to partial realization amen oh
[1:27:18] Hallelujah I'm lost
[1:27:21] amen and whom you see not see him not
[1:27:24] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[1:27:26] unspeakable and full of Glory with them
[1:27:28] we Rejoice also we haven't seen him but
[1:27:32] we have felt him we know him now as much
[1:27:36] as our limited senses can let us but one
[1:27:40] day it will be face to face that is for
[1:27:43] this age his coming at the end of he is
[1:27:47] coming at the end of this age oh
[1:27:51] Hallelujah I I don't know if this gets
[1:27:53] you as excited as I did when I was
[1:27:54] reading it I was just like whoa thank
[1:27:56] you Lord amen just a little jolt of
[1:27:59] electricity that we realize you know
[1:28:01] what my goodness we're laboring we're
[1:28:04] struggling and the devil's pounding on
[1:28:06] us and we make mistakes and we're like
[1:28:08] Lord can I be yours and then you read
[1:28:10] something like this and realize
[1:28:12] hallelujah amen this word of God is
[1:28:15] breaking every shackle it breaks every
[1:28:19] chain we ought to be holding any chain
[1:28:21] we might possess tonight we ought to be
[1:28:23] holding it up and say Lord here's
[1:28:25] another one break it yes
[1:28:27] sir Hallelujah partial realization will
[1:28:31] be made perfect realization hallu look
[1:28:35] read those next
[1:28:37] words
[1:28:41] completed now something that's left to
[1:28:43] be done cannot be considered completed
[1:28:45] that's right right well we're working
[1:28:48] our way just hoping you know not by
[1:28:50] works but by faith we're hoping to make
[1:28:52] the rapture
[1:28:54] that's
[1:28:56] partial but when you can come to the
[1:28:57] place that you look at the word of God
[1:28:59] like the prophet of God said and you see
[1:29:00] yourself in the word you look at that
[1:29:02] and you say praise the Lord he was
[1:29:04] talking about me 2,000 years ago these
[1:29:08] words were written about me Hallelujah
[1:29:11] you talk about being
[1:29:12] important partial realization made
[1:29:15] perfect realization completed
[1:29:17] realization now that inspired a prophet
[1:29:19] enough he put a Hallelujah on the end of
[1:29:21] it hey I tell you what I say hallelujah
[1:29:24] also amen we have been looking through a
[1:29:26] glass Darkly but soon it will be face to
[1:29:29] face we have been going from glory to
[1:29:31] glory but soon it will be right in the
[1:29:33] glory and in his glory will'll shine
[1:29:36] whoa Hallelujah we'll shine we shall be
[1:29:39] like him wondrously like him Jesus our
[1:29:43] savior Divine isn't that wonderful yes
[1:29:46] amen we're partially made in
[1:29:52] him Hal
[1:29:55] Hallelujah we are complete in him
[1:29:57] everything I need to make the Rapture is
[1:29:59] already inside me Hallelujah I'm
[1:30:03] complete you say brother Paul you're
[1:30:04] still manifesting out you're still
[1:30:06] growing spiritually you're still that's
[1:30:08] right but it's in me that's right it's
[1:30:10] not coming from the church it's not
[1:30:12] coming from this guy and that guy over
[1:30:13] there whatever God is releasing it by
[1:30:17] faith in me
[1:30:19] amen we are complete in him that is true
[1:30:23] he would not lie to us about that but
[1:30:25] one day we will be changed in the atoms
[1:30:28] we will put on immortality we shall be
[1:30:31] swallowed
[1:30:32] up you know what that means this isn't
[1:30:36] life this right here is not even life
[1:30:39] for a son or daughter of God this is not
[1:30:41] life that's right amen exactly yes
[1:30:44] sir this is a 2,000 year prototype
[1:30:49] testing ground yes it and one day
[1:30:53] they're going to come up with with that
[1:30:54] perfect
[1:30:55] prototype of realization
[1:30:58] realization and they're going to say
[1:31:01] Lord it sure looks like this bride down
[1:31:03] here on the earth is ready and he says I
[1:31:09] I see that are you guys ready we'll go
[1:31:13] call them
[1:31:15] home oh

[1:31:20] partial but it will be a bride of Christ
[1:31:23] going through her life every single
[1:31:28] day but you see the
[1:31:33] picture has been getting
[1:31:37] clearer it's no longer this fuzzy thing
[1:31:40] of who am I and what is happening what
[1:31:44] does God's word mean it's getting clear
[1:31:49] I need to hurry right along cuz I got to

[1:32:04] just now someone has been many has been
[1:32:07] saying to me and theologians said
[1:32:10] brother brandom if the Lord God said if
[1:32:12] W with your experience that the Lord has
[1:32:14] given you for his people humbly saying
[1:32:17] this said you would be eligible to write
[1:32:19] a Bible yourself your word if if God has
[1:32:23] man manifested I said that might be true
[1:32:26] see he was trying to catch me see I said
[1:32:29] but you see I couldn't do that he said
[1:32:31] why couldn't you you have all the
[1:32:37] qualifications all the
[1:32:39] qualifications
[1:32:42] yeah I said but you look one word cannot
[1:32:46] be added or taken away see and he said
[1:32:51] well then them seven Thunders you see
[1:32:53] with would them seven Thunders blasting
[1:32:55] out wouldn't that be a revelation be
[1:32:56] given to some man I said no sir it would
[1:32:59] be adding something to it or taking
[1:33:01] something from it it's all revealed in
[1:33:05] there and the seventh seals opened up
[1:33:07] the revelation of what that was and

[1:37:11] ignorant and unlearned they had no
[1:37:12] education but they taken notice that

[1:37:23] had been with Jesus cuz Jesus was
[1:37:26] manifesting himself through them right

[1:37:43] best for last oh Hallelujah Jesus was
[1:37:48] manifesting himself through them Christ
[1:37:51] veiled in their flesh
[1:37:56] manifested Made Alive like he was in
[1:37:59] Moses when the word was in Moses he was
[1:38:02] God in flesh when it was in Jesus it was
[1:38:05] God in flesh see the only thing he done
[1:38:07] was change his m not his word not his
[1:38:09] nature he is the same yesterday today
[1:38:11] and forever he only changed his form he
[1:38:14] changed from Noah to Moses he changed
[1:38:16] from Moses to David from David Joseph on
[1:38:19] down till he come into the fullness of
[1:38:21] the godhead bodily see oh oh hallelujah
[1:38:24] we're almost there Saints he's still the
[1:38:27] same
[1:38:28] God he's still in the veiling
[1:38:31] business amen amen I hope that gets
[1:38:34] through see it is the same God but he
[1:38:36] just takes on another Veil see he put on
[1:38:38] another Veil I want to slow down now he
[1:38:41] put on another Veil he did it in the
[1:38:44] reformers taking on a veil taking on a
[1:38:47] veil until finally it came down through
[1:38:49] the Lutheran Age come down through the
[1:38:51] other age then finally comes down
[1:38:54] into the
[1:38:56] complete what were we looking at earlier
[1:38:59] amen that perfect realization amen was
[1:39:03] complete amen right amen just before it
[1:39:07] come a prophet rises again what it does
[1:39:11] it foreshadows the word showing back
[1:39:13] there revealing what's been done what's
[1:39:15] been left off that the church will be
[1:39:17] without not without understanding then
[1:39:20] when this Fades out like John said I
[1:39:22] must de increase he must increase then
[1:39:26] all and all comes into him he is fully
[1:39:31] manifested through
[1:39:33] Luther Wesley Pentecostal age on down on
[1:39:38] down he is fully manifested you see come
[1:39:41] down just the manifestation God
[1:39:45] unfolding see him now notice fulfilled
[1:39:48] in his promise for this day as they had
[1:39:51] now Moses was the word to that day
[1:39:53] because the word was given to him for
[1:39:55] that day Moses Joseph was the word for
[1:39:57] his days betraying Christ exactly see
[1:39:59] each one of them was the word
[1:40:03] hallelujah and when Jesus came he was
[1:40:05] the word in its
[1:40:08] fullness amen do you know when he
[1:40:12] comes and undoes that zipper that's it
[1:40:16] and he grabs you and he steps
[1:40:21] inside right
[1:40:25] he doesn't zip that up and say now a few
[1:40:28] years from now I'll come and give you
[1:40:33] something
[1:40:34] more no sir he was a fullness that's
[1:40:37] when he unzipped your life and stepped
[1:40:39] into it you had everything you needed
[1:40:43] for the Rapture right right there oh
[1:40:46] hallelujah amen oh amen because the
[1:40:51] whole Plan of Redemption laid in him the
[1:40:53] whole Plan of Redemption didn't lay in
[1:40:55] Moses didn't lay in Joseph didn't lay in
[1:40:57] Elijah see they were only part of the
[1:40:59] word pointing to it see now notice keep
[1:41:02] your thought here it comes as I say see
[1:41:04] the whole plan wasn't in them they were
[1:41:07] pointing to
[1:41:09] it therefore after him the fullness we
[1:41:11] cannot point to something else it points
[1:41:14] back to him the word brother Brown picks
[1:41:16] up his Bible Hallelujah I I'm just going
[1:41:18] to go right
