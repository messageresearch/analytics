[29:05] keep listening for a different
[29:08] sound

[29:17] the sound of the bride being united with
[29:22] the groove
[29:24] i keep listening
[29:28] i
[29:29] keep listening
[29:31] i
[29:32] keep listening for a different
[29:38] sound i remember the preacher saying

[29:46] there will come a generation
[29:50] that will be the last i can't believe
[29:55] i'm standing here
[29:57] seeing the end of time
[30:00] and the preacher's voice he's echoing in
[30:03] my mind
[30:06] but
[30:07] i keep listening for a different sound
[30:13] the sound of the city that
[30:16] jumps are coming down
[30:19] the sound of the bride being united with
[30:24] the groove
[30:26] the sound of the chorus singing glory to
[30:31] the lamb
[30:32] well i
[30:34] keep listening
[30:36] yes i
[30:37] keep listening
[30:40] i
[30:41] keep listening for a different sound
[30:45] scene again
[30:46] oh
[30:47] but i
[30:49] keep listening for a different sound
[30:54] the sound of the city that
[30:57] john saw coming down
[31:00] the sound of the bride
[31:05] [Music]
[31:10] singing glory
[31:11] the lamb will i

[31:23] [Music]
[31:27] hallelujah aren't you glad that your
[31:29] ears have been
[31:30] tuned to catch a different sound
[31:34] amen
[31:36] you know we look in the world around us
[31:37] my brother and sister and oftentimes
[31:39] i've mentioned how satan loves to use
[31:42] distractions
[31:43] just look
[31:45] there's as much chaos on the earth right
[31:47] now to catch our attention as there has
[31:49] ever been in history
[31:51] everything happening
[31:53] amen
[31:55] but the bride
[31:57] is listening for a different sound
[32:00] hallelujah
[32:01] the stirring the moving of the holy
[32:03] spirit is in her midst
[32:05] it's not a voice that's going to come on
[32:07] cnn or fox or something like that it's a
[32:11] voice that's coming right here
[32:14] amen and have you ever experienced this
[32:16] where you almost felt like you heard it
[32:18] here
[32:19] but the real reality of it saints was
[32:21] you were hearing it here right but
[32:23] because of the human element and the way
[32:25] we relate to sound and hearing and
[32:28] learning and all this thing we're
[32:29] convinced it's like did a voice just
[32:32] speak to me yes it did
[32:34] but it wasn't speaking here
[32:36] it was speaking here and it echoed
[32:39] through the very fiber of your being
[32:42] and you knew it was the lord
[32:44] you know it was god speaking to you god
[32:47] bless you this morning so happy to be
[32:49] here i just want to
[32:53] just remind all of you
[32:55] uh that communion will be next saturday
[32:57] evening september the fourth at six pm
[33:00] so let's just uh let's remember that and
[33:03] uh encourage all of you and while
[33:06] today
[33:07] i realized
[33:09] some of my notes come back and tie into
[33:11] communion but you know it's interesting
[33:14] because
[33:15] i had
[33:17] kind of forgotten the communions this
[33:18] coming saturday and just as we dig into
[33:22] these things and with the lord speaking
[33:24] to us then i realized oh
[33:26] how beautifully how well this ties
[33:28] together and god is great amen let's
[33:30] always remember our brother prashant and
[33:32] sister koncha
[33:34] in a world of identifying
[33:37] i hope you can see a tad bit of humor in
[33:39] this and world uh identifying they
[33:41] identify as being here
[33:44] and so let's not forget them amen just
[33:46] as we could envision they were sitting
[33:48] on a pew here uh they our brother our
[33:51] sister
[33:52] very dear we love them so much
[33:54] i just pray the lord will open the door
[33:57] but we have to always as as the word of
[34:00] god tells us shows us uh we must close
[34:03] everything out with lord thy will be
[34:05] done lord willing amen let's just stand
[34:08] today and want to speak to you
[34:11] on um i i didn't know that sister jerry
[34:13] was even singing a song and the song fit
[34:16] and brother jason's last song here just
[34:19] struck my heart
[34:21] walking the road to our glorious
[34:23] redemption amen and
[34:26] just to make sure that you understand
[34:29] sister jerry didn't know i was preaching
[34:30] on this topic so
[34:33] the revelation of the song she chose was
[34:35] her revelation and uh so we're just
[34:38] turning our bibles to the book of luke
[34:40] uh and uh here we want to just visit
[34:44] the uh
[34:45] scriptures concerning uh cleopas and his
[34:49] friend walking on the road to emmaus
[34:52] and to
[34:54] lord willing bring that back into our
[34:56] day to realize this is happening once
[34:58] again
[34:59] and the power of god
[35:01] amen is that eternal circle uh god said
[35:05] i am god and i change not
[35:07] and i'm happy because when he said i was
[35:10] saved amen i don't ever have to stop and
[35:13] question that again i don't have to say
[35:14] well i made a mistake i did something
[35:17] here or there did god change his mind
[35:19] nope his thoughts are eternal amen and
[35:22] he said i redeemed you i sprinkled my
[35:24] blood uh over you and not only that
[35:27] because between the ark and you would be
[35:30] judgment and so therefore i will cover
[35:33] the mercy seat with my blood
[35:35] and i will cover the ark with my blood
[35:39] that judgment cannot come and that
[35:41] beautiful i just reading it this morning
[35:43] early this morning amen the brother
[35:45] branham putting it this way he said the
[35:47] believer will never come to judgment
[35:49] because she's already been judged
[35:53] and i'm glad today that the lord judged
[35:55] us worthy to receive his word worthy to
[35:57] receive the life amen that we're not
[36:00] here as it were vying to do great deeds
[36:03] so we might find ourselves acceptable
[36:06] but we find ourselves accepted in the
[36:08] beloved because the beloved claimed us
[36:11] and that is so beautiful luke 24
[36:14] starting with the 13th verse
[36:17] amen
[36:18] and behold two of them went that same
[36:20] day to a village called emmaus which was
[36:23] from jerusalem about three score
[36:25] furlongs
[36:26] and they talked together of all these
[36:28] things which had happened and it came to
[36:31] pass
[36:32] that while they communed
[36:36] not
[36:37] a casual
[36:39] conversation
[36:41] can you believe what the president just
[36:43] did can you believe what's happened here
[36:45] can you believe but they were actually
[36:47] in communion
[36:50] so while they didn't realize the very
[36:52] atmosphere that was around them
[36:55] was setting them up
[36:58] for this incredible
[37:00] you might say event
[37:02] whatever words you understand what i'm
[37:04] saying the atmosphere that was already
[37:06] around them they didn't say come in the
[37:07] presence of jesus and go oh wait we need
[37:09] to change our atmosphere
[37:13] they were walking they were living they
[37:14] were communing in an atmosphere that
[37:18] jesus christ said i'll come down in
[37:20] their midst isn't that beautiful
[37:22] just stirs my heart lord help us to
[37:24] create atmospheres amen hallelujah
[37:29] and they talked together of all the
[37:30] things which had happened and it came to
[37:32] pass that while they communed together
[37:34] and reasoned jesus himself drew near and
[37:38] went with them
[37:39] but their eyes were holden that they
[37:41] should not know him and he said unto
[37:43] them what manner of communications are
[37:46] these that ye have one to another as ye
[37:49] walk
[37:54] and are sat
[37:58] and the one of them whose name was
[37:59] gleopas answered and said unto him art
[38:02] thou only a stranger in jerusalem and
[38:04] hast not known the things which are come
[38:06] to pass therein these days and he said
[38:09] unto them
[38:11] what things
[38:12] you notice he doesn't
[38:14] affirm or deny
[38:16] he just asked them i want to hear it
[38:18] from
[38:20] your lips
[38:21] i want to hear your testimony
[38:25] what things and they said unto him
[38:26] concerning jesus of nazareth
[38:30] which was a prophet mighty indeed and
[38:32] word before god and all the people and
[38:35] how the chief priests and our rulers
[38:37] delivered him to be condemned to death
[38:39] and have crucified him but we trusted
[38:43] that it had been he which should have
[38:45] redeemed israel and beside all this
[38:47] today is the third day since these
[38:49] things were done yey and certain women
[38:52] also of our company made us astonished
[38:55] which were early at the sepulcher and
[38:57] when they found not his body they come
[39:00] saying that they have also seen a vision
[39:02] of angels which said that he was alive
[39:05] and certain of them which were with us
[39:07] went to the sepulcher and found it even
[39:10] so as the women had said
[39:13] but him they saw not
[39:14] then he said in them
[39:20] oh fools
[39:25] wonder
[39:26] how we have the message would receive
[39:29] jesus christ in our midst today
[39:36] o fools and soul of heart to believe all
[39:38] that the prophets have spoken
[39:43] ought not christ to have suffered these
[39:45] things and to enter into his glory and
[39:48] beginning at moses and all the prophets
[39:51] he expounded unto them in all the
[39:53] scripture the things concerning himself
[39:56] and they drew nyan to the village
[39:58] whether they went and he made as though
[40:02] now i want you to catch these words
[40:05] he made as though he would have gone
[40:08] further
[40:09] but they constrained him saying abide
[40:11] with us for it is toward evening and the
[40:13] day is for spent and he went in to tarry
[40:16] with them and it came to pass as he said
[40:18] it meet with them he took bread and
[40:20] blessed it and break and gave to them
[40:24] and their eyes were
[40:26] opened
[40:27] and they knew him and he vanished out of
[40:30] their sight
[40:32] and they said one to another
[40:36] did our heart not burn within us
[40:39] while he talked with us by the way and
[40:41] while he opened to us
[40:43] the scriptures
[40:45] heavenly father we just ask you lord
[40:47] open the scripture to us today
[40:49] father
[40:50] lord there's so many thoughts so great
[40:53] upon our heart as we look at the
[40:55] condition of the world and
[40:57] truly father we see this scripture
[40:59] fulfilled and
[41:01] lord yet we
[41:03] must also take the
[41:05] thought lord that it could be today
[41:08] tomorrow next week next month
[41:11] next year
[41:14] in one place lord the prophet said it
[41:16] might even be a hundred
[41:19] but one thing we know father
[41:22] we are walking in the way
[41:24] and you are walking with us
[41:26] father that's all that matters lord
[41:29] is that you are walking with us
[41:32] we ask you lord to lead us and guide us
[41:34] today be with those that are not here
[41:37] father those that are
[41:39] gone lord
[41:41] just father every brother and sister
[41:44] father that
[41:45] you would just come and encourage hearts
[41:47] and strengthen
[41:49] we thank you father for the opportunity
[41:51] to serve you today
[41:52] lord to walk in your glorious light and
[41:55] walk in the very privilege
[41:57] of sons and daughters of god
[41:59] we thank you now in your name amen
[42:02] you may be seated saints
[42:13] i won't bother to explain to you how
[42:15] that the mercy seat has led us to this
[42:18] place but i will make this statement
[42:21] that any time
[42:23] that the word of god is opened or
[42:25] revealed to you and i
[42:27] that is god's mercy
[42:29] it would not ever be an intellectual
[42:31] ability it would never be something we
[42:33] could find or figure out but it's god's
[42:36] mercy as he opens his word to us and
[42:39] makes it alive and
[42:41] you know we look at this and see cleopas
[42:44] and this unnamed brother and how that um
[42:47] they were coming along and they were
[42:49] recounting and speaking to one another
[42:51] no doubt my brother and sister they were
[42:54] saying you know as the scripture says we
[42:56] we thought that this jesus of nazareth
[42:58] was going to come and rise up you see my
[43:01] brother and sister it was no different
[43:03] in that day than it is in this day there
[43:05] were many doctrines about the coming of
[43:08] jesus christ there was many ideas and
[43:10] ideologies and little groups and issues
[43:13] and schisms and some say he's going to
[43:15] come here and some this and and we'll
[43:17] find that it is there that many thought
[43:20] in that day that he was actually going
[43:22] to come as the mighty conqueror and that
[43:25] meaning that he was going to rally great
[43:28] armies and deliver israel from their
[43:30] oppressors but my brother and sister he
[43:32] came as a mighty conqueror
[43:34] standing right in their midst and he
[43:37] delivered amen he uh broke the bondage
[43:40] of the bond of the mighty oppressor but
[43:43] the people because they were not looking
[43:45] correctly they they missed it entirely
[43:48] and we even see cleopas and his friend
[43:51] walking down the road to emmaus
[43:53] discussing these things and we'll see
[43:56] that it is actually god's great mercy
[43:58] that come down and chose to speak to
[44:01] them because you see they had this idea
[44:04] that he was going to be that mighty
[44:05] deliverer just like many others did and
[44:08] they had missed the real true revelation
[44:10] of what had happened in their day and as
[44:13] they reasoned together we see in verse
[44:15] 16 it says that their eyes were blinded
[44:18] their eyes were holded that they they
[44:20] simply had a man you know we can
[44:22] envision that they're walking along and
[44:24] a man just seems to come out of nowhere
[44:26] kind of drift right in and to the
[44:28] conversation walking with them and and
[44:31] he's listening and then he starts to
[44:33] communicate with them and so we see uh
[44:36] this in verse 17 uh that uh jesus even
[44:40] comments on the fact that they are sad
[44:43] and so they are there you know my
[44:45] brother and sister you realize now we
[44:47] all are human and we have our different
[44:49] things that we we struggle with but
[44:51] being the bride of jesus christ with the
[44:54] revealed word in our day we should be
[44:57] able to stop and say lord break a spirit
[45:00] that might be upon me lord the spirit of
[45:02] depression a spirit of of whatever that
[45:05] might be holding you back because you
[45:07] see my brother and sister the greatest
[45:10] thing that could ever happen on earth
[45:12] has happened
[45:13] you say well we we haven't went in a
[45:15] rapture yet my brother and sister the
[45:17] rapture is nothing more than another
[45:20] portion of the unfolding of a word of
[45:23] god that was spoken it has to come to
[45:25] pass it will come to pass and so
[45:28] therefore don't get all fretted up about
[45:31] uh uh you know what is happening when is
[45:33] it going to happen you know it's like oh
[45:36] my you know this i'll give you something
[45:38] to fret about did you know that if you
[45:40] go spend the time waste the time in a
[45:42] way i'd say it this way and look through
[45:44] the hierarchy of our american government
[45:47] and you will find that almost everybody
[45:49] in a high position has went and kissed
[45:51] the pope's ring
[45:53] that should be confidence inspiring
[45:56] but it's prophecy
[45:58] it's the word coming to pass
[46:01] so you see my brother and sister that
[46:03] that uh the majority of our high courts
[46:05] are catholic
[46:07] majority of our high authorities
[46:10] ambassadors etc etc are catholic look
[46:13] what's coming to pass everybody's
[46:14] worried about what is china going to do
[46:16] i don't care what china is going to do
[46:17] they're going to keep producing cheap
[46:19] plastic whatever
[46:22] there's no prophecy of china taking
[46:26] over so we see how this is and
[46:30] they're sad
[46:32] they just had the greatest message
[46:34] preached to them
[46:36] in their midst they're walking down the
[46:38] road but i want you to understand you
[46:40] see my brother and sister
[46:42] it's there because they had a certain
[46:44] mindset they had a certain uh thought
[46:47] process that was determining in their
[46:50] mind how that uh the redeemer the
[46:52] messiah
[46:54] was going to come and what was going to
[46:56] happen and they were looking around
[46:58] expecting to see a certain result and
[47:00] when they didn't see that they they knew
[47:03] my brother and sister down in their
[47:04] heart that he was the messiah but they
[47:06] could not reconcile what was happening
[47:09] around them and i have to admit there's
[47:11] times that it's hard to reconcile what
[47:13] is happening around us we have men that
[47:16] carry the message for so long so
[47:18] stalwart and they're laying it down and
[47:20] turning and walking away that is
[47:22] mind-boggling to me but you see my
[47:24] brother and sister we can type this into
[47:27] into the scriptures joshua et cetera but
[47:29] you look at this so there's things that
[47:31] are taking place that that just baffle
[47:34] us and and it's there but that doesn't
[47:36] take away from the promise that was
[47:38] given and so as they're walking because
[47:40] they do not realize they're walking in
[47:42] the presence of jesus christ they are
[47:44] there and this man seems to have said
[47:46] the right words and approach them in the
[47:48] right fashion and so they start to pour
[47:51] their hearts out and they start to tell
[47:53] them uh tell him all of the reasons why
[47:56] that they are discouraged why they're
[47:58] walking sad down the road to emmaus he
[48:01] was crucified and now the tomb is empty
[48:04] and we don't really have answers but you
[48:06] see if you go back in the word he
[48:07] documented everything that he was going
[48:10] to do
[48:12] but because we have a preconceived
[48:14] notion of even what the word means
[48:17] we miss it
[48:27] but you know what they were doing
[48:30] they might have been discouraged they
[48:31] might have been a little confused
[48:34] but they were testifying
[48:36] of jesus christ
[48:38] they weren't walking along talking about
[48:40] what president biden is doing
[48:44] and what's happening here and what's
[48:45] happening there
[48:47] they were focused
[48:49] on jesus christ
[48:51] and even in our times that we don't
[48:54] understand
[48:55] when our thoughts are on him and our
[48:57] heart is upon him
[49:00] his word says he's present with us
[49:03] and so they are there discouraged and
[49:05] they're testifying of jesus christ but
[49:08] they go on to stay to state or to say
[49:11] what they thought from their perspective
[49:14] certain that he was the one going to
[49:15] come as a mighty general going to come
[49:18] and rally israel together and rise up
[49:20] once again as they had all through the
[49:22] ages and and defeat their conquerors but
[49:25] you see god had another path he was
[49:27] moving it from as it were a nation
[49:30] warring against a nation to a people
[49:33] warring against a spirit or a realm that
[49:36] was there moving it from something here
[49:38] a natural kingdom into a spiritual
[49:42] kingdom coming into a transition of time
[49:44] that he says i'm not going to empower
[49:46] great armies to overcome i'm going to
[49:49] empower you the army of god sons and
[49:51] daughters of god i'm going to empower
[49:53] you to be the overcomer you are now
[49:55] going to be able to stand up and claim
[49:57] the position i am a conqueror
[50:00] amen i have i am not afraid of death i'm
[50:03] not afraid of hell not afraid of the
[50:06] grave and while we don't say mocking
[50:08] words about satan because the word tells
[50:10] us not to my brother and sister we
[50:12] should be coming to a place that we
[50:14] recognize the word says in my deepest
[50:17] hour my darkest hour i can call on the
[50:20] lord and he will come and he is the
[50:23] mighty conqueror
[50:25] and we can stand upon that
[50:27] amen no longer a time that we have to
[50:30] rally and as i've said in this church
[50:31] and i'll say it again as a reminder it
[50:33] doesn't have to be a mother with a baby
[50:36] a sick baby or hurt baby or whatever it
[50:38] might be a mother trying to frantically
[50:40] dial someone else that they might pray
[50:43] for the child but they recognizing who
[50:45] they are in jesus christ can lay their
[50:48] hands upon the child upon the husband
[50:51] upon the neighbor whatever it is and
[50:53] pray the prayer of faith and god will
[50:55] honor that
[50:56] amen it's time for us to recognize who
[50:58] we are
[51:00] amen so they're telling them of the one
[51:02] that they had sought for
[51:04] he's telling the one that they sought
[51:06] for the one they were looking to and
[51:09] they don't seem
[51:11] to really realize
[51:14] they're just talking about things that
[51:16] they thought should come to pass
[51:20] but never did
[51:22] does that kind of remind us sometimes of
[51:24] some people
[51:27] maybe
[51:28] people that look like us
[51:30] maybe people that are us
[51:34] that we sometimes say well i prayed and
[51:36] i expected god to do this
[51:38] and i expected god to answer my prayer
[51:40] like this
[51:43] and people get disappointed
[51:46] people even get so far that they get
[51:48] angry with god
[51:51] or the lack of his concern for the
[51:54] prayer that they pray
[52:00] not realizing as the scripture says
[52:02] their prayer is actually a prayer that
[52:04] is amiss
[52:05] they're missing the mark with their
[52:07] prayer they're not seeing the picture
[52:09] but they expect god to answer it in that
[52:11] fashion
[52:13] so they were stating what they thought
[52:15] what they saw from their perspective and
[52:17] i i think that's good my brother and
[52:19] sister god's not going to chastise you
[52:21] as it were just because your perspective
[52:24] is off but uh well we'll touch on that
[52:26] in a minute amen so they were certain as
[52:29] i said that he was the one to redeem
[52:31] israel
[52:32] so they're telling the one that they
[52:33] were that they sought for about the
[52:36] things that seemed to be but never
[52:37] happened of uncertainty and of unmet
[52:40] expectations can we be honest this
[52:41] morning and lift a hand and say i have
[52:44] unmet expectations in my life
[52:46] i have things i thought were going to
[52:48] happen a certain way of things i thought
[52:50] i might accomplish in life you know it's
[52:52] kind of scary when you're my age and you
[52:54] read research and they talk about you
[52:56] know that you know i forget the numbers
[52:58] forgive me if i'm got them skewered but
[53:00] it's 67 percent or 77 percent
[53:04] of adults never achieve the goals they
[53:07] set
[53:09] in their teen years
[53:12] there's a lot of unmet expectations out
[53:14] there
[53:21] so the uncertainty
[53:23] and the unmet expectations now come
[53:25] pouring out of them
[53:28] but you know what i have to say i love
[53:30] this
[53:32] i i've i've been in this position i'm
[53:34] sorry to say i've been in this position
[53:36] and and i can from my own heart say i've
[53:39] been there but you know what jesus
[53:41] didn't come along and say oh
[53:44] i'm so sorry to hear this
[53:47] i'm sorry that your expectations were
[53:50] not met
[53:51] what does he do
[53:53] he says o fools
[53:55] and slow of heart
[53:58] to believe
[54:01] thank you brother trevor
[54:04] i i was pausing for emphasis and i got
[54:07] it
[54:08] amen that's just fine that's just fine
[54:10] brother trevor
[54:11] all that the prophet said
[54:14] see not our favorite quotes my brother
[54:16] and sister not the ones that kind of put
[54:18] me in a superior position to you or vice
[54:20] versa or the one that makes them look in
[54:22] a bad light and me in a good light know
[54:25] all that the prophet said
[54:27] come on we apply that in this age it
[54:29] would change them if people could truly
[54:31] apply it it would change the mentality
[54:34] of a lot of people if they could apply
[54:36] that because they're like well the
[54:37] reason we this is because of this and
[54:39] the reason that was of this and this is
[54:41] that and that is this and that's why i
[54:42] stand on my position i have quotes
[54:46] sorry i've got another 101 quotes
[54:50] that kind of counter your quote because
[54:53] you somehow got yours out of context
[54:59] never let this message become a battle
[55:01] of quotes saints
[55:02] the prophet of god told us what we
[55:04] should be doing is praying for
[55:06] revelation
[55:07] let's let these quotes be the
[55:09] foundational building stones of a
[55:11] complete revelation of what god sent a
[55:14] prophet for
[55:15] not to be a contest of i do this and i
[55:18] do that and we do this and we worship
[55:20] this way my brother and sister that's
[55:22] not what it was there for that is a
[55:24] contrarian
[55:26] devil spirit coming in to create warfare
[55:30] in the body of christ
[55:32] amen to be that we wouldn't darken the
[55:34] door of that church because of this
[55:36] wouldn't do this because of that now my
[55:38] brother and sister i will clarify this i
[55:41] will as a pastor as long as god and you
[55:43] allow me to be the pastor of this church
[55:45] we're not going to sit here and let
[55:46] someone preach some warped doctrine of
[55:48] the message of the bible just because we
[55:51] need to be kind and loving sorry it
[55:53] don't work that way
[55:54] amen we're going to let them know you're
[55:56] wrong and if you care to here is the
[56:00] ream of information that you can see
[56:04] where it is
[56:07] some people think well if you really
[56:08] love them you would just let them
[56:15] where i read this was supposedly a old
[56:18] russian story so if it's not a russian
[56:21] story forgive me for blaming it on the
[56:22] russians
[56:28] was that a smirk sister vika
[56:32] it was
[56:35] but the russian story is is
[56:38] the boy is in the snow and one day finds
[56:41] a little wolf
[56:42] puppy
[56:44] and it's so cute
[56:46] and he takes it home and begs his
[56:48] parents
[56:50] let me keep it let me keep it
[56:54] and the parents relented and the little
[56:56] wolf puppy was growing and growing and
[56:59] growing
[57:00] and one day the parents come home and
[57:03] there's a very
[57:05] contented wolf laying there
[57:07] and no child
[57:11] that's what
[57:13] false doctrine evil spirits that's what
[57:15] they do they rest until the day comes
[57:18] that they realize
[57:19] i can devour
[57:22] i can do this
[57:23] that's why we as ministers that's why
[57:27] we're not called to compromise saints we
[57:29] have to stand solid on these things
[57:31] and sometimes you don't seem very loving
[57:34] when you're standing solid
[57:36] i mean it'd be hard to say that david
[57:38] looked loving when he chopped goliath's
[57:40] head off
[57:42] but it was necessary
[57:45] so
[57:46] they're they're pouring out all these
[57:48] things and jesus doesn't give them oh
[57:50] i'm so sorry but you see the word always
[57:53] corrects the air let's never ever forget
[57:55] that saints when god is dealing with you
[57:58] never forget that the word will correct
[58:01] the air and if god loves you
[58:04] he will correct you
[58:08] so you know if life is just such peaches
[58:10] and cream as it were my brother and
[58:12] sister
[58:13] you know you might want to stop and just
[58:15] kind of question because we're soldiers
[58:17] we're in a great fight we're we're not
[58:19] here just to enjoy a time and and just
[58:22] to cruise along
[58:24] in verse 25 he said i'm the old fools
[58:26] and slow of heart to believe all that
[58:29] the prophets have spoken and my brother
[58:31] and sister i i think this day and age
[58:33] that strong of talk would be enough to
[58:36] cause many people to be offended and
[58:38] walk away if jesus was standing right
[58:40] here in our midst and we we didn't
[58:42] recognize it was jesus right at this
[58:44] point they don't know this is jesus
[58:46] christ it's just a man standing there
[58:48] and he's telling them oh fools
[58:51] and soul of heart to believe
[58:54] many people would be like i don't have
[58:56] to take that from you
[58:58] oh can we say thank you lord for the
[59:00] anointing to accept the word
[59:02] amen as hard as it is to be able to
[59:05] accept the correction of the word my
[59:07] brother and sister that's because god is
[59:09] rich in mercy
[59:11] amen
[59:12] amen i say this morning i say this with
[59:14] all my heart lord anoint us with a
[59:16] spirit to receive correction
[59:18] let us never buck up against this you
[59:20] know we see this i'll just throw this in
[59:22] as a little additional counterpart i
[59:24] won't name names dates places whatever
[59:27] but my brother and sister when you see
[59:28] people that push up against something
[59:31] that is preached
[59:33] until it's confirmed that brother
[59:35] branham said it
[59:37] so one minute they're pushing back with
[59:40] all their strength
[59:41] i can't accept that
[59:45] well brother branham said it oh praise
[59:47] god
[59:48] see something's wrong because the nature
[59:50] in them the spirit in them
[59:53] is then being as it were respecter of
[59:55] person because brother branham said it
[59:57] now now i will agree with it but what
[1:00:00] about the nature or the spirit that's in
[1:00:02] us to be the nature of christ and i will
[1:00:05] share a quote here after a while
[1:00:07] you can't you can't fight against this
[1:00:10] the nature of god that's in you cannot
[1:00:13] fight against the word of god until oh i
[1:00:16] realized that
[1:00:17] it was no see something's wrong
[1:00:19] we need to recognize that the spirit of
[1:00:21] christ now that doesn't say that you
[1:00:23] wouldn't go well i don't know about that
[1:00:26] then the holy spirit deals with you and
[1:00:28] you say lord forgive me
[1:00:30] but i'm talking about wholesale
[1:00:32] pull the sword raise the shield
[1:00:35] i disagree with you
[1:00:39] see there's a spirit that's there
[1:00:45] because you see he's
[1:00:47] kind of telling them that
[1:00:50] you believe the prophets
[1:00:53] you've read what they spoke you've heard
[1:00:54] what they spoke
[1:00:56] but they couldn't receive all of it
[1:01:00] now
[1:01:00] we'll look at this
[1:01:02] he says you know ought not christ he's
[1:01:04] laying this out to have suffered these
[1:01:06] things to enter into his glory is this
[1:01:08] not the word that's what he's telling
[1:01:10] them saints i don't mean to interpret
[1:01:11] the scripture but he's saying is this
[1:01:13] not the word that this is what was
[1:01:15] happened this was prophesied by isaiah
[1:01:18] by zachariah these things were all laid
[1:01:21] out here was all presented before you
[1:01:23] that says this must come and it must be
[1:01:26] as it were we preached on that about the
[1:01:28] the testator and and the testimony all
[1:01:31] of this must come he must die for this
[1:01:34] to go into effect because if there's no
[1:01:36] death then there's no
[1:01:39] will to be tested
[1:01:42] nothing to be fulfilled
[1:01:44] and he lays this all out in the word and
[1:01:46] he's laying it out to these men and
[1:01:48] because they were godly men they were
[1:01:51] men that god had had desire to reveal
[1:01:53] this you know he come and he he's
[1:01:56] expounded unto them the scripture and
[1:01:58] the things concerning himself and i say
[1:02:00] my brother and sister we need to hear
[1:02:02] those words again we actually need as
[1:02:04] believers of a message we need to
[1:02:06] actually come to the place that the word
[1:02:09] would be strong enough to look us in the
[1:02:10] face and say oh fools and slow of heart
[1:02:13] let's get over all of the pettiness of
[1:02:15] this message and all of the politics of
[1:02:17] this message and all of that we lift up
[1:02:20] this man and put that man down we bring
[1:02:22] this one in fellowship and that one out
[1:02:24] of fellowship and we have our group and
[1:02:26] they're not part of our group and we
[1:02:28] this and we that how about we get back
[1:02:30] to what the prophet said how about we
[1:02:32] get back into the word of god and let
[1:02:35] the word become a living testament in
[1:02:37] our life again
[1:02:38] instead of a political instrument
[1:02:44] you see
[1:02:46] this whole journey and i'll cut through
[1:02:47] this you know this scripture certainly
[1:02:49] can read and study it
[1:02:51] you see
[1:02:52] acting as though he would go on he's
[1:02:54] walked with them they still see him as
[1:02:56] just a man that they are probably no
[1:02:58] doubt marveling
[1:03:00] look at what he's doing he's talking
[1:03:02] about the messiah he's talking about uh
[1:03:04] this man jesus of nazareth and he's
[1:03:07] sharing to us the scripture and how that
[1:03:10] the reasons this must be is here and
[1:03:12] here and testified here and prophesied
[1:03:15] here and they're there and their memory
[1:03:17] see this is why it's important that our
[1:03:19] pure minds be stirred up
[1:03:22] he wasn't preaching them something new
[1:03:23] he wasn't having to prove to them moses
[1:03:26] said this they knew
[1:03:28] he didn't have to prove to them that
[1:03:30] these was the prophecies of scripture on
[1:03:32] days gone by they knew but he was
[1:03:34] stirring up their pure mind and as it
[1:03:36] was being stirred up they were starting
[1:03:38] to say oh i see i see i don't know why i
[1:03:42] never saw that this was connected to
[1:03:43] this and these must come to pass before
[1:03:46] this can happen and oh it's not about a
[1:03:49] military might it's about a power of god
[1:03:52] in our midst
[1:03:54] and they started to respond to this they
[1:03:56] were they were thinking oh yes this is
[1:03:58] so good and you see what it is is he
[1:04:01] starts
[1:04:02] as they're coming and he acts as though
[1:04:05] he is going to go on you know my brother
[1:04:08] and sister you can look in the word
[1:04:09] especially take what the prophet of god
[1:04:10] said he never intended to go on
[1:04:13] he was just presenting them with the
[1:04:15] opportunity let me put it like this he
[1:04:18] gave them the opportunity to invite him
[1:04:23] to sup with him
[1:04:25] in other words god coming down sometimes
[1:04:27] stirring you and i to give us an
[1:04:29] opportunity to come and enter into
[1:04:32] worship to enter into prayer to pour our
[1:04:35] heart out to him he creates an
[1:04:37] atmosphere that makes us want to
[1:04:44] he gives them the opportunity invite to
[1:04:47] sup with them
[1:04:48] now let's look at this when their eyes
[1:04:50] were open they knew him notice they
[1:04:52] invited him in
[1:04:54] now they couldn't explain it they it's
[1:04:56] just he just they didn't understand what
[1:04:58] he was talking about it was all mixed up
[1:05:01] to them they couldn't understand it but
[1:05:03] yet they
[1:05:04] they said invite constrained him you
[1:05:06] must come in he said no i got to be
[1:05:09] going on oh the lord you must come in
[1:05:13] you must come in and constrained him
[1:05:15] until he called upon him until he had to
[1:05:17] go in that's the way you do and when he
[1:05:21] gets inside that's when he can reveal
[1:05:24] himself and can make himself known when
[1:05:28] inside
[1:05:31] you see if they have just come to the
[1:05:33] place my brother and sister i hope you
[1:05:35] see the big picture if they had just
[1:05:37] walked with him and they come and they
[1:05:38] said we're going to spend the evening
[1:05:40] here and he said i'm going to go on and
[1:05:42] they just said well it was nice visiting
[1:05:44] with you they would have never had the
[1:05:47] face-to-face encounter with jesus christ
[1:05:50] they would have never had that
[1:05:51] experience but there was something
[1:05:53] within their hearts an atmosphere that
[1:05:56] was there with them even before jesus
[1:05:59] started walking in their presence that
[1:06:01] they were there speaking it was the
[1:06:03] topic of their mind was they confused
[1:06:05] brother brown was talking about they
[1:06:06] didn't how to explain this they didn't
[1:06:08] know why these things were happening
[1:06:10] they thought this this and this but god
[1:06:12] had created an atmosphere a time
[1:06:16] space in eternity where he said i will
[1:06:20] come and walk with you uh cleopas and
[1:06:23] walk with you brother whatever his name
[1:06:25] was and it is it's there what was it
[1:06:28] creating a personal testimony
[1:06:36] people around
[1:06:38] they say well i i got saved in this
[1:06:40] church i was this age i was that
[1:06:43] um yeah i believe
[1:06:47] what i like to hear is the personal
[1:06:48] testimony
[1:06:50] no not the one like i was the worst
[1:06:52] drunk in town i was the worst drug
[1:06:55] addict i was the worst woman i don't
[1:06:57] like them testimonies i'm sorry to tell
[1:06:59] you
[1:06:59] because usually they prefigure anything
[1:07:01] god did with what the devil had already
[1:07:03] done
[1:07:04] but what i'm interested in is how that a
[1:07:06] man who could be angry and violent and
[1:07:09] god start to break him down and find
[1:07:12] himself sitting on a park bench in a
[1:07:14] park
[1:07:17] crying out to a god he never knew
[1:07:18] existed
[1:07:22] and him to be able to tell you
[1:07:24] that's where i met christ
[1:07:26] it was a midnight hour sitting in a
[1:07:28] public park
[1:07:31] so broken inside everything that i
[1:07:34] represented on the outside strength and
[1:07:36] virality and all of these things was all
[1:07:39] a charade because down inside i was a
[1:07:41] broken person
[1:07:43] and god come
[1:07:44] and he filled that void
[1:07:46] that's the kind of testimonies i like to
[1:07:48] hear
[1:07:49] what i pray that god allows to happen as
[1:07:51] time carries on right here amongst our
[1:07:53] young people i want to hear testimonies
[1:07:55] that the lord just allows me to grow old
[1:07:58] with you if he tarries i want to hear
[1:07:59] testimonies that when i was a young
[1:08:01] person in the world was wooing hey you
[1:08:04] young man come
[1:08:06] young woman come
[1:08:11] that heard a difference out
[1:08:13] heard the sound of a city coming down
[1:08:17] i heard a sound of the whisper of
[1:08:19] angel's wings
[1:08:21] and something
[1:08:23] embraced me and wrapped around me and
[1:08:25] held me steady
[1:08:28] hallelujah
[1:08:29] nothing better
[1:08:31] for the rebellious spirit of a teenager
[1:08:34] than a good dose of the holy ghost
[1:08:38] that'll break the rebellious spirit of
[1:08:40] the teenager
[1:08:41] every time
[1:08:44] amen so he invites him in
[1:08:46] you know
[1:08:48] and he can reveal himself once he's gone
[1:08:50] inside you see saints he never revealed
[1:08:52] himself on the road
[1:08:54] but when that atmosphere was such they
[1:08:56] said we haven't heard enough
[1:08:58] that's why it always bothers me when i
[1:08:59] hear people around the message say well
[1:09:01] you know we've been listening the
[1:09:02] message for 45 years and we've heard
[1:09:04] enough
[1:09:06] i'm sorry never
[1:09:08] never
[1:09:10] never
[1:09:11] come on something's wrong when somebody
[1:09:13] would use the words i've heard enough
[1:09:19] heartbreaking
[1:09:22] so we look at this and see now
[1:09:24] invites them to sup with them comes in
[1:09:27] there and it's when they're there
[1:09:28] that they recognize
[1:09:30] amen
[1:09:31] at what
[1:09:33] when are their eyes open saints
[1:09:37] at the breaking
[1:09:38] of the bread
[1:09:40] not sitting down in fellowship knee to
[1:09:43] knee
[1:09:44] not sitting there in that lovely
[1:09:46] presence which would have to be because
[1:09:48] there was the lamb of god in their midst
[1:09:51] but it was at the breaking
[1:09:54] of the bread
[1:10:01] i can only
[1:10:02] envision
[1:10:04] the very breaking natural of a loaf of
[1:10:06] bread
[1:10:08] and as the bread was broken
[1:10:10] they looked
[1:10:14] in
[1:10:14] revelation there wasn't lightning and
[1:10:17] thunder on the horizon
[1:10:19] there wasn't a shaking of earth
[1:10:21] but revelations swept over their minds
[1:10:24] and their heart and soul
[1:10:25] and they looked up and said
[1:10:30] this is our lord this is him
[1:10:33] and then he was gone but you see he
[1:10:35] didn't have to stay there and hold their
[1:10:36] hand any longer they were now empowered
[1:10:39] from within in the spirit to say you
[1:10:41] know what i've met him face to face he's
[1:10:44] real and the power of the word and not
[1:10:46] only that he come and revealed the word
[1:10:49] all the way through showed me who i am
[1:10:52] in jesus christ and what my purpose is
[1:10:54] here and why god put me down in the to
[1:10:57] see an age my brother and sister do you
[1:10:59] understand i forget which one of the old
[1:11:02] men of age has gone by made this
[1:11:04] statement he said uh uh something of the
[1:11:06] nature of uh
[1:11:09] we view the other ages in a different
[1:11:12] light
[1:11:14] but if we had been there as sons of god
[1:11:17] we would have walked in the light
[1:11:21] oh if i i just labored a sea is too hard
[1:11:23] for me we have electronics and we have
[1:11:25] all kinds of filth and garbage of the
[1:11:27] world and we're trying to keep our
[1:11:28] children from this and we try to do this
[1:11:30] and we're trying to do that and we live
[1:11:32] in such a horrible age and look at the
[1:11:33] condition of our nation my brother and
[1:11:35] sister if you were in the dark ages you
[1:11:36] would have been going my goodness what's
[1:11:38] happening to our country and look what's
[1:11:39] going on with the young people and look
[1:11:41] at the music that they're doing and
[1:11:42] looking at it matter what age it was
[1:11:45] but we live amen under the anointing of
[1:11:47] the holy spirit that god said the age i
[1:11:50] chose to place you in i made you capable
[1:11:54] i made you strong
[1:11:56] i made you victorious
[1:11:59] don't be looking for another age look to
[1:12:01] the promise that was given to you for
[1:12:04] this day and stand on that and say lord
[1:12:06] i'm your instrument in this day and i
[1:12:09] will fulfill the word
[1:12:11] i will bring forth what i was called to
[1:12:14] be i don't need a softer age i don't
[1:12:17] need a more this or more that i need to
[1:12:20] just know who i am and when i recognize
[1:12:23] who i am i will look at this age and say
[1:12:25] you know what satan i've overcome your
[1:12:27] music your clothes your worldliness your
[1:12:30] perversion i've overcome it by the blood
[1:12:33] of the lamb
[1:12:35] hallelujah
[1:12:37] at the breaking of the bread now let's
[1:12:38] just look real quick here in john 6 35
[1:12:41] jesus said unto them i am the bread of
[1:12:44] life
[1:12:46] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[1:12:48] he that believeth on me shall never
[1:12:50] thirst
[1:12:51] you see my brother and sister i i want
[1:12:54] to give you a different perspective and
[1:12:55] please don't if if i somehow don't have
[1:12:58] the right perspective on this forgive me
[1:13:00] correct me whatever but you see
[1:13:03] it wasn't the literal loaf of bread
[1:13:07] that he broke that opened their eyes
[1:13:10] it was the word that he was laying in
[1:13:12] their hearts
[1:13:14] as he is walking along the way with them
[1:13:16] it is this this tutoring as it were
[1:13:20] through the word
[1:13:21] showing them showing them it was
[1:13:24] preparing them and preparing them and
[1:13:26] when the natural event of the breaking
[1:13:29] of the bread took place
[1:13:36] it's like there it is
[1:13:38] there it is
[1:13:40] you see it wasn't
[1:13:42] literal breaking of a loaf
[1:13:44] that opened their eyes
[1:13:46] it was the word
[1:13:48] that had been being broken to them
[1:13:50] opened to them as they walked along this
[1:13:54] journey
[1:13:57] it's not just a one-day tutorial now we
[1:13:59] see this happening on the road to emmaus
[1:14:01] is is something taking place in one day
[1:14:04] but my brother and sister we're living
[1:14:06] as it is in the day by day by day by day
[1:14:09] the word being placed in us lying upon
[1:14:11] line precept upon precept the word
[1:14:13] constantly reminding us how many of you
[1:14:15] had to be reminded more than once that
[1:14:17] you as the son of god before it soaked
[1:14:18] in
[1:14:23] come on it took years
[1:14:25] of god dealing with me
[1:14:28] now maybe i'm a little slower than most
[1:14:30] of you forgive me for that
[1:14:33] but it took years
[1:14:37] and one day when the light come on
[1:14:40] at the breaking
[1:14:42] of the bread
[1:14:45] i wept
[1:14:48] did i have no more challenges
[1:14:50] no sir it seemed like there got to be
[1:14:52] more of them
[1:14:54] seemed like a whole bunch of challenges
[1:14:55] got dumped on me
[1:14:57] but one thing i recognized
[1:14:59] i know who i am now
[1:15:01] it don't matter what happens here i know
[1:15:03] who i am
[1:15:05] i want to tell you my brother and sister
[1:15:06] i don't know what the future will hold
[1:15:08] but those believers that are in
[1:15:09] afghanistan
[1:15:10] and in those parts of the world whatever
[1:15:12] might befall them they might become the
[1:15:14] martyrs of this age
[1:15:17] but i can assure you this one thing that
[1:15:19] the anointing of almighty god will fall
[1:15:21] upon them and they will know that's what
[1:15:23] they were called to
[1:15:25] they won't be begging
[1:15:26] you won't see the real believer trying
[1:15:28] to become a muslim
[1:15:30] you won't see them trying to denounce
[1:15:34] you will see them declaring if this is
[1:15:36] what god called me for i will stand up
[1:15:39] and be found testifying of jesus christ
[1:15:42] that's hard for us in the western world
[1:15:44] to fathom
[1:15:45] it's hard for us to live in our nice
[1:15:46] cushy lives oh it's so horrible i can't
[1:15:49] afford a new car
[1:15:51] my life is so bad
[1:15:52] i'm wearing the same dress shoes that
[1:15:54] i've wore for five years now
[1:15:56] come on saints
[1:15:58] there's an anointing out there that's
[1:15:59] coming down upon the people that are
[1:16:01] saying you know what i don't care take
[1:16:03] this whole world amen give me jesus
[1:16:07] give me jesus that's all that matters to
[1:16:09] me give me jesus
[1:16:14] amen
[1:16:16] and it wasn't just because they were
[1:16:18] there
[1:16:20] it wasn't just because they walked down
[1:16:21] the road to emmaus with jesus christ
[1:16:23] that this all happened my brother and
[1:16:25] sister
[1:16:26] they'd enter in to communion with him
[1:16:29] they've been communing one to another
[1:16:31] but now they entered into a communion
[1:16:33] with him and let me just throw this out
[1:16:35] that's why i believe every believer in
[1:16:37] this church should be taking communion i
[1:16:40] don't know what your reasons are i don't
[1:16:42] know why some of you don't come i don't
[1:16:43] know if it's work if it's whatever but
[1:16:45] my brother and sister you've got to
[1:16:47] understand that the commandment that god
[1:16:49] gave us the prophet reiterated is that
[1:16:51] we take communion until his coming
[1:16:54] this is not something that we just
[1:16:56] decided it's not convenient for me it
[1:16:58] ought to be something that we press into
[1:17:01] amen so they were having true fellowship
[1:17:03] with him
[1:17:04] you see christ on the inside my brother
[1:17:06] and sister is what makes a true
[1:17:08] relationship
[1:17:09] now i want to just
[1:17:10] as well just move forward right here
[1:17:16] who is your little queen in the home
[1:17:22] i like this quote
[1:17:27] i like food
[1:17:30] so when my little queen
[1:17:31] ministers food to me
[1:17:34] i'm especially happy
[1:17:39] who is the little queen in the home
[1:17:41] she ministers food to you is that right
[1:17:44] what you're late on now i don't know
[1:17:46] what that was about but when do you
[1:17:49] that's
[1:17:50] what the bride ministers to christ the
[1:17:52] word
[1:17:53] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:17:56] every word see she ministers the word to
[1:17:59] the king
[1:18:00] manifesting his promised word in the age
[1:18:03] that she's living in amen and i said
[1:18:06] something then
[1:18:08] you didn't get it
[1:18:12] something deeper
[1:18:14] now imagine
[1:18:18] how hard it is i know what it's like as
[1:18:19] a pastor you say things and then later
[1:18:22] you feel like i didn't say it right
[1:18:24] something how did the people not get
[1:18:26] this
[1:18:28] wasn't there a response to this
[1:18:31] brother branham is making a declaration
[1:18:34] here speaking these words and he's
[1:18:35] saying you didn't you didn't get it
[1:18:38] he recognized there was an inspiration
[1:18:40] and anointing
[1:18:42] that should have stirred rippled through
[1:18:44] the people
[1:18:45] bringing a reaction a response
[1:18:49] but you know the beautiful thing about
[1:18:50] it
[1:18:54] stirred my greater compliment that can
[1:18:56] be given by you to your lord jesus
[1:18:58] christ than for you to stand up and as
[1:19:01] it were live the word out showing him i
[1:19:04] believed you
[1:19:05] i believed you i applied your word to my
[1:19:08] life because i believed you
[1:19:12] were ministering and sometimes we don't
[1:19:14] even know
[1:19:15] that we're ministering it doesn't always
[1:19:17] have to have a title a headline a
[1:19:20] whatever sometimes look sisters i'll
[1:19:22] just put it this way
[1:19:24] men are just bears to live with aren't
[1:19:26] they sisters
[1:19:27] go ahead and lift your hands so we can
[1:19:29] see it on camera
[1:19:39] do you know you're ministering to jesus
[1:19:41] christ when you minister to your natural
[1:19:43] husband
[1:19:46] it's that simple
[1:19:48] that's the word right
[1:19:51] now if you're doing a poor job of
[1:19:52] ministering to your husband
[1:19:54] well don't feel brow beaten and don't
[1:19:56] feel judged just go pray about it
[1:19:59] let god stir your heart
[1:20:01] but when you cook for your children you
[1:20:03] clean for them you present a a
[1:20:06] presentable house for them you say well
[1:20:08] you know my husband he just doesn't do
[1:20:10] his part well don't worry about what
[1:20:11] your husband's doing do your part
[1:20:13] right
[1:20:15] natural spirit
[1:20:17] don't worry about the other just do your
[1:20:19] part
[1:20:19] do what you know you should be doing and
[1:20:22] let god take care of the rest
[1:20:24] because sometimes what we know we should
[1:20:26] be doing is we should be praying and we
[1:20:27] don't
[1:20:28] because it's a lot easier to blame the
[1:20:30] wife blame the husband blame the
[1:20:31] children
[1:20:33] blame whoever
[1:20:35] then actually do something about it
[1:20:38] now what did the prophet of god say was
[1:20:39] the greatest weapon that we have formed
[1:20:41] against the devil
[1:20:43] our prayer life
[1:20:47] now when asked
[1:20:48] are any of us really satisfied with our
[1:20:50] prayer life
[1:20:53] don't be ashamed of that
[1:20:56] just do
[1:20:58] what you should do
[1:21:02] just step up and say lord i want to
[1:21:04] before i start blaming the wife start
[1:21:06] blaming the husband start blaming the
[1:21:07] kids start blaming dad start blaming mom
[1:21:11] yeah teenagers
[1:21:13] you can have a prayer life
[1:21:16] young people you can have a prayer life
[1:21:19] you can have communion with jesus christ
[1:21:23] you don't got to be 20 years old you
[1:21:24] don't got to be married have children
[1:21:26] you don't got to have some thing you you
[1:21:28] can be
[1:21:29] 6 7 8 9 10 12 whatever 14 16 18 whatever
[1:21:33] it is
[1:21:34] and have a prayer life
[1:21:36] you can have a powerful
[1:21:40] force i feel some pushback here well
[1:21:44] here just a second
[1:21:48] we don't need an excuse
[1:21:50] we need to do what god called us to do
[1:21:53] we don't need a scapegoat
[1:21:55] we need to be
[1:21:56] acceptance of the chastisement of god in
[1:21:59] our own life
[1:22:00] and say lord
[1:22:02] it seemed like he was looking at me
[1:22:04] well if this will help
[1:22:06] defeat any spirit about he was looking
[1:22:09] at me when he said that i will just
[1:22:21] you all been looked
[1:22:23] so y'all can go home and say he was
[1:22:25] looking at me when he said that
[1:22:27] no it's the holy spirit wanting us
[1:22:29] saints
[1:22:30] to break through these barriers
[1:22:33] break through it because you see we're
[1:22:35] walking our own road
[1:22:37] to emmaus
[1:22:38] and we are walking along saying i
[1:22:40] thought it should be this and i thought
[1:22:41] it was going to be that and i thought
[1:22:43] this and i thought that
[1:22:45] but you know what
[1:22:47] the word says
[1:22:49] when we call on his name he draws nigh
[1:22:51] we draw nigh unto him he draws an eye
[1:22:53] unto us
[1:22:55] you're walking your own journey it's not
[1:22:56] emmaus it's laodicea
[1:22:59] but you can be walking with jesus christ
[1:23:01] you don't have to be we're looking back
[1:23:03] to 1965. we're looking forward to a
[1:23:06] rapture it can be right now
[1:23:09] right now
[1:23:11] hallelujah
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:13] now look
[1:23:16] this little queen
[1:23:18] see what she's doing she was called to
[1:23:21] manifest his promised word in the age
[1:23:23] she's living we're living right now
[1:23:25] we can manifest this word
[1:23:28] right to you play once i thought it's
[1:23:30] pretty funny i never bothered i'm not
[1:23:32] too schooled on furlongs and this and
[1:23:34] that but this brother put it this way he
[1:23:37] said now with so many feet
[1:23:39] uh that they come to get to emmaus and
[1:23:41] it took him all day to get there and
[1:23:42] took him about an hour to get back
[1:23:47] you know what was it they was anointed
[1:23:50] there was no more of this wandering
[1:23:52] along scuffing the rock in the dirt i
[1:23:55] don't know what god's got for my life
[1:23:57] i don't know what god's gonna do i'm so
[1:23:59] afraid
[1:24:00] because my children and they're in
[1:24:02] public school and they have phones now
[1:24:04] and they have friends that aren't
[1:24:06] christians and i just don't know what
[1:24:09] is going to happen and
[1:24:11] um you know and
[1:24:12] we thought it should have been i mean
[1:24:14] brother branham said you know in 1204 65
[1:24:17] he he said the lord will just be coming
[1:24:20] any day now
[1:24:24] how is it we're in
[1:24:25] 2021 i
[1:24:27] i just don't
[1:24:29] understand
[1:24:32] when god comes down and says you know
[1:24:33] what i gave you your children
[1:24:35] i gave a promised word i filled them
[1:24:37] with the holy ghost i wrote their name
[1:24:38] in the lamb's book of life and you now
[1:24:41] have a job to do as a mother as a father
[1:24:44] to stand on my word and manifest it you
[1:24:46] don't worry about what i'm going to do
[1:24:47] for them why don't you worry about what
[1:24:49] i said i would do for you
[1:24:51] amen
[1:24:52] and when that happens we can make it all
[1:24:54] the way from emmaus back in an hour
[1:24:56] why because we know
[1:24:59] that we know that we know
[1:25:01] god is present walking with us
[1:25:05] hallelujah none of this oh what are we
[1:25:07] gonna do what are we gonna do
[1:25:09] you see my brother and sister we've been
[1:25:11] called to minister the word to the king
[1:25:15] now look at this
[1:25:16] this bride hearing this spoken word can
[1:25:18] someone say amen
[1:25:20] and this spoken word has been anointed
[1:25:21] by the holy ghost my brother and sister
[1:25:23] we're not just we're not just dealing
[1:25:24] with a message that is just another
[1:25:26] something that you know uh could have
[1:25:28] been started by this person or that
[1:25:30] person this is the revealed word of the
[1:25:31] hour this is god coming down and proving
[1:25:33] this is what i meant for this day and i
[1:25:36] can tell you right now saints the bread
[1:25:38] has been broken
[1:25:40] the word has been opened the bread is
[1:25:43] broken and christ is right here in our
[1:25:45] midst the prophet of god preaches this
[1:25:47] over and over again yes there's
[1:25:49] naysayers that as i've been preaching to
[1:25:51] you and i will beat against that spirit
[1:25:53] until i have no breath when they are
[1:25:55] there saying well this can't be
[1:25:56] happening because the way we understand
[1:25:59] it is if he is with us in us here today
[1:26:03] he's not on the mercy seat so you're
[1:26:05] wrong well my brother and sister they
[1:26:07] could interpret that all they want that
[1:26:09] way but the word says that he's here on
[1:26:12] the mercy seat which is in the heart of
[1:26:15] man amen and he's here giving mercy to
[1:26:19] you and i and part of that mercy is he
[1:26:21] said this work i have begun in you oh
[1:26:24] come on somebody get excited this work i
[1:26:27] have begun in you
[1:26:29] i'm going to have so much mercy on you
[1:26:32] in this day that the work i begin i will
[1:26:35] be right there with you and it will get
[1:26:37] finished

[1:26:40] failed you again i failed you again lord

[1:26:45] been a message believer for 20 years and
[1:26:48] i'm still falling down lord help me and
[1:26:52] he's like don't worry about it my mercy
[1:26:54] my grace is sufficient for you
[1:26:57] i will finish this war stand up and say
[1:27:00] lord forgive me and start going on the
[1:27:03] road to emmaus again
[1:27:05] hallelujah
[1:27:07] amen the devil would like you to stop
[1:27:09] and build you a pity party camp right
[1:27:12] there but i'm telling you i'm going to
[1:27:14] walk on this road right into a rapture
[1:27:17] right into eternity and i'm not gonna
[1:27:20] stop for a lion devil
[1:27:23] hallelujah
[1:27:24] because the bread has been broken
[1:27:27] and the word says our eyes of
[1:27:29] understanding are now opened amen now
[1:27:32] are you going to deny the word and say
[1:27:34] no
[1:27:35] no
[1:27:36] we've got a message of the hour but we
[1:27:38] have just many questions today this is a
[1:27:40] quote actually an individual said
[1:27:42] i just don't know
[1:27:44] i don't know whether i believe the
[1:27:45] message or not anymore
[1:27:46] because we've been following this
[1:27:48] message for so long and we have just as
[1:27:50] many questions today
[1:27:52] as we did when we started
[1:27:58] okay
[1:28:00] when he was on the road to emmaus
[1:28:04] with jesus
[1:28:06] was he talking
[1:28:09] or was you
[1:28:12] you know it's a problem we have

[1:28:18] house i need new clothes i need my kids
[1:28:20] oh they're all this and i need that and
[1:28:21] i need that and i need the preacher not
[1:28:22] to preach so long on sundays because

[1:28:30] put it here nope can't fit
[1:28:32] oh can't get a word in there can't get a
[1:28:34] word in here

[1:28:43] or
[1:28:44] no go on
[1:28:46] come on saints
[1:28:48] we're on the road to emmaus is he
[1:28:50] talking or are we
[1:28:52] it's one thing to pour our heart out to
[1:28:53] him but we've got to stop and let him
[1:28:55] speak
[1:28:56] we got to stop
[1:28:58] look at look at kilo hero
[1:29:02] cleopas
[1:29:04] and his friend
[1:29:08] that our hearts not burn within us
[1:29:10] as he opened the word to us on the way
[1:29:14] i can see them just walking along
[1:29:17] and maybe a little comment like lord
[1:29:19] but what about this
[1:29:21] and he opens it
[1:29:23] and they're speaking
[1:29:25] they didn't go away and said hey guys
[1:29:26] you know what i
[1:29:28] i was telling
[1:29:29] jesus christ all about how
[1:29:31] this should be
[1:29:33] no sir
[1:29:38] maybe present company not included
[1:29:39] except for myself
[1:29:41] sometimes we just
[1:29:44] have so much we want to share
[1:29:47] don't you just i'll put it this way
[1:29:49] don't you dislike it when you're talking
[1:29:51] to somebody somebody's going to say you
[1:29:53] do that paul
[1:29:55] but don't you dislike it when you're
[1:29:57] talking to somebody
[1:29:59] and you realize that really all they're
[1:30:01] doing is waiting
[1:30:03] to tell you what they're thinking
[1:30:06] they're not listening to you
[1:30:10] i'm sure glad cleopas and his friend
[1:30:12] didn't do that
[1:30:15] they just said okay
[1:30:17] i don't know who this man is see they
[1:30:19] didn't have respect of person saints
[1:30:21] they didn't know this was jesus christ
[1:30:23] they were just listening and he
[1:30:25] chastised him right off the bat
[1:30:28] fools
[1:30:32] nobody mess is going to talk to me that
[1:30:34] way brother trevor i'm out of here
[1:30:37] just i ain't putting up with it
[1:30:39] 40 years in this message and somebody's
[1:30:40] going to call me a fool
[1:30:42] i'm done
[1:30:45] maybe you just confirmed their words
[1:30:51] look at this
[1:30:53] the bride has a ministry though let's
[1:30:55] look here i want to hurry up
[1:30:57] the members of the virgin bride will
[1:30:59] love him
[1:31:00] they will have
[1:31:02] his potentials
[1:31:05] for he is their head and all power
[1:31:07] belongs to him they are subject to him
[1:31:10] as
[1:31:10] the members of our bodies are subject to
[1:31:13] our heads notice the harmony of father
[1:31:15] and the son jesus never did anything
[1:31:17] until it was first showed him by the
[1:31:19] father john 5 19. this harmony now
[1:31:22] exists between the groom and his bride
[1:31:25] he shows her his word of life
[1:31:29] i want you to catch these things i hope
[1:31:30] you are
[1:31:32] he doesn't just show the word of life to
[1:31:33] anyone
[1:31:34] he didn't you didn't see in that whole
[1:31:36] story you didn't see jesus keep turning
[1:31:39] off here and breaking bread with this
[1:31:40] man and turn and go over here and break
[1:31:42] bread with this council and go down here
[1:31:44] and sit in this public square and break
[1:31:46] bread he walked with them two men
[1:31:49] two men two men called of god
[1:31:53] to a people called of god he's come down
[1:31:56] and he says i'm going to break bread
[1:31:57] with you
[1:31:59] i'm going to reveal myself i'm going to
[1:32:01] do the very things that stirs something
[1:32:03] now i hope you catch this i'm trying to
[1:32:05] condense this down you know the prophet
[1:32:07] of god remember he said everything this
[1:32:09] just paraphrased everything you need to
[1:32:12] make the rapture
[1:32:14] is at this church over here
[1:32:16] it's down over here
[1:32:18] it was back here no
[1:32:21] no he said it's already in you
[1:32:23] you realize what was happening cleopas
[1:32:25] and his friend are walking down the road
[1:32:27] amen it wasn't that jesus christ was
[1:32:30] giving them something new my brother and
[1:32:32] sister he was stirring up their pure
[1:32:34] minds in remembrance of what was already
[1:32:36] in them because they were called the
[1:32:38] very ingredient of your name being on
[1:32:41] the lamb's book of life place that seed
[1:32:43] in you and he's there revealing and
[1:32:46] watering that seed and it's it's there
[1:32:49] and at the moment he breaks the natural
[1:32:51] bread it comes to life in them and they
[1:32:52] said that's it
[1:32:57] because you see there's a harmony that
[1:32:59] exists between the groom and his bride
[1:33:01] he shows her his word of life
[1:33:04] she receives it she never doubts it
[1:33:06] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:33:08] death for if the seed be planted the
[1:33:10] water will raise it up again and here's
[1:33:12] the secret of this the word is in the
[1:33:16] bride
[1:33:18] hallelujah saints this isn't just
[1:33:20] something hey i stumbled onto it and
[1:33:22] coming to the message sorry that word is
[1:33:25] in you
[1:33:28] as it was in mary the bride has the mind
[1:33:30] of christ for she knows what he wants
[1:33:32] done with the word
[1:33:35] oh hallelujah i know what needs to be
[1:33:37] done with the word i'm going to preach
[1:33:39] it and you're going to listen
[1:33:41] no sir what does he want done with
[1:33:46] take the book
[1:33:48] eat it
[1:33:50] let it come
[1:33:51] is it bitter in your belly
[1:33:54] it sure can be
[1:33:56] when you find yourself
[1:33:58] being chastised by the word of god
[1:34:03] lord i just can't do this any longer
[1:34:06] then you pick your bible up
[1:34:08] and you read
[1:34:10] and the word of god tells you
[1:34:13] you can do all things through christ
[1:34:15] jesus
[1:34:16] now you have to decide listen your voice
[1:34:18] that says i can't do it
[1:34:21] or listen to the word that says you can
[1:34:23] do all things that's right you say but
[1:34:25] but looking at the big things that's so
[1:34:27] simple brother paul no no it's a lot of
[1:34:29] simple things
[1:34:31] now brother isaac could come up here and
[1:34:32] explain blockchain to us
[1:34:35] i know it's a word that starts with b
[1:34:37] and the second word starts with a c
[1:34:39] blockchain right very complicated
[1:34:43] but it's quite complicated
[1:34:46] but blockchain doesn't work
[1:34:49] if you start leaving out
[1:34:51] the simple things
[1:34:53] because
[1:34:54] it's made up of a series
[1:34:56] of simple things connected together
[1:34:59] producing a desired transport or effect
[1:35:04] would that be fair to say that
[1:35:07] so we start leaving out the little
[1:35:08] things
[1:35:10] i just can't overcome i can't overcome
[1:35:12] i'm gonna go to church i believe the
[1:35:13] message i can't overcome
[1:35:15] you're denying
[1:35:17] you're actually denying the word
[1:35:20] don't let the devil cause you to deny it
[1:35:23] you might feel that you're lower than
[1:35:25] the carpet
[1:35:27] but it needs to come from your mouth and
[1:35:28] say i can do all things
[1:35:31] i can do all things i can do all things
[1:35:33] i can do all things i can do all things
[1:35:35] why because he showed her that's you
[1:35:38] the word of life did you receive
[1:35:41] come on if you haven't received it
[1:35:43] you're in a whole different category now
[1:35:45] but if you said i believe this word and
[1:35:47] i believe jesus christ is my lord and
[1:35:48] savior and i believe that god has called
[1:35:50] me amen then you have received the word
[1:35:53] and don't doubt it therefore nothing can
[1:35:55] harm you not even death people are so
[1:35:56] worried about this body
[1:36:00] so worried about this body we so worried
[1:36:02] about this body
[1:36:04] millions
[1:36:06] living lives that will take them
[1:36:07] straight to hell
[1:36:08] but we need to vaccinate them because we
[1:36:10] got to keep that body alive
[1:36:12] no care for the soul
[1:36:14] no care for the soul there is no care
[1:36:16] for the soul
[1:36:19] the word is in the bride the bride has
[1:36:21] the mind of christ for he knows what's
[1:36:22] what done with the word she performs the
[1:36:25] command of the word in his name for she
[1:36:27] has thus saith the lord then the word is
[1:36:29] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[1:36:31] pass have any of you ever experienced
[1:36:33] that
[1:36:34] hallelujah i'll tell you i've
[1:36:36] experienced in everything from lost
[1:36:38] wallets lost car keys amen amen i i love
[1:36:42] that brother jason you know it's like oh
[1:36:45] we lost the keys we lost keys what are
[1:36:47] we going to do what are we going to do
[1:36:48] what are we going to do sister amy comes
[1:36:49] driving up in the driveway right in
[1:36:50] front of our farm shop and go out there
[1:36:53] and i don't remember who it was was it
[1:36:54] you brother jason who was it there's the
[1:36:56] keys now how did the keys get on the
[1:36:58] cowling right by the
[1:36:59] the wiper and how did sister emmy drive
[1:37:01] all the way to boise on the freeway and
[1:37:03] all the way back and do everything that
[1:37:04] she did and the keys are just perched on
[1:37:06] the corner of the car don't tell me
[1:37:07] there's not a supernatural god
[1:37:10] hallelujah and just bring this closer to
[1:37:12] home our little fellowship up in the
[1:37:13] mountains paul you know unlocked the
[1:37:15] hitch and changed the hitch and locked
[1:37:17] it back up and left the keys laying
[1:37:19] right on the very edge of the tail of
[1:37:20] the pickup and it rode 130 40 miles up
[1:37:24] there over not the most smooth roads in
[1:37:25] the world and my wife picks up the key
[1:37:27] off the back of the truck right there
[1:37:29] tell me how that would happen
[1:37:31] under a normal circumstance you wouldn't
[1:37:33] get out of the driveway and the keys
[1:37:34] would have fallen off
[1:37:37] this little things come on you've got
[1:37:38] your own stories to tell
[1:37:40] amen little things answers
[1:37:45] young people you're going to school
[1:37:46] you've got tests
[1:37:48] if you just have faith in god and commit
[1:37:50] the tests that you're taking and you're
[1:37:52] learning to the lord he'll come right
[1:37:54] down imagine jesus christ himself
[1:37:56] sitting right there in the corner of
[1:37:58] your death saying now on that one right
[1:38:00] there it would be this
[1:38:04] or you can use the method brother paul
[1:38:06] used in school and it'd be like eenie
[1:38:08] meenie miney mo
[1:38:10] the last one was c this one has to be d
[1:38:13] and the next one is a and that one is b
[1:38:15] and this one is c
[1:38:18] or you could actually take time and
[1:38:19] believe and say lord
[1:38:21] i'm a daughter of god i'm a son of god
[1:38:24] and lord i
[1:38:27] i'm not going to get all nervous and
[1:38:28] shook up about this i'm going to commit
[1:38:30] this to you and i'm going to trust you
[1:38:31] that you would give me wisdom to do this
[1:38:35] i mean
[1:38:36] just saying
[1:38:37] just say it
[1:38:39] because he said now
[1:38:45] i'll move on
[1:38:47] like a seed that's planted water it
[1:38:48] comes full harvest serving its purpose
[1:38:50] those in the bride do only his will now
[1:38:53] look i'm going to say a very pointed
[1:38:54] statement to you because we're almost
[1:38:55] done in fact sister emmy wants to come
[1:38:57] the piano
[1:38:58] those in the bride will do only his will
[1:39:00] my brother and sister
[1:39:02] you cannot step out of the word
[1:39:04] call it revelation expect the people to
[1:39:07] digest it and have god put an
[1:39:09] endorsement on
[1:39:11] it won't happen god won't accept that
[1:39:14] you know why
[1:39:15] well i'll get ahead of myself the bride
[1:39:17] only do his will no one can make them do
[1:39:19] otherwise they have thus saith the lord
[1:39:20] or they keep still they know that it has
[1:39:22] to be god in them doing the works
[1:39:24] fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:39:27] complete all his work while in his
[1:39:29] earthly ministry so now he works in and
[1:39:33] what
[1:39:34] god actually trusts you
[1:39:37] amen
[1:39:38] to take his word and put it to work
[1:39:42] oh my that's not according to a lot of
[1:39:44] these people
[1:39:45] you can't you can't you're not going to
[1:39:47] make the rapture without me your pastor
[1:39:48] giving you all the spiritual discernment
[1:39:50] that you need that's not what the
[1:39:52] prophet of god says he says this bride
[1:39:54] is going to be so filled with the holy
[1:39:56] ghost having the mind of god that she
[1:39:59] will be able to take the word and go
[1:40:02] start fulfilling manifesting this word
[1:40:05] to complete the plan of god he did not
[1:40:08] complete all his work with earthly
[1:40:10] ministry so now he works in and through
[1:40:12] the bride
[1:40:14] look at that she knows that
[1:40:17] we're not guessing we're not hoping we
[1:40:19] know
[1:40:20] for it was not yet time for him to do
[1:40:22] certain things that he must now do but
[1:40:24] he will now fulfill
[1:40:28] man i'll tell you what
[1:40:31] hallelujah
[1:40:33] i'm trying to restrain saints and get
[1:40:36] over this punching back and all these
[1:40:37] spirits and voices that have worded this
[1:40:40] and said that
[1:40:41] whatever
[1:40:42] voices that say things like without an
[1:40:44] apostle in your church you'll never get
[1:40:46] the word right
[1:40:49] which apostle are you talking about
[1:40:52] the one with the shiny cadillac or the
[1:40:53] one with the big house or the one over
[1:40:55] here or the one down there which one are
[1:40:57] you talking about
[1:40:59] because you see a real apostle of god
[1:41:01] is going to go to the word and then he's
[1:41:03] going to go out there and he's going to
[1:41:04] say look saints here's the word
[1:41:06] here's the word go to the word saints
[1:41:08] come to the word come to the word you
[1:41:10] don't have to come to me to go to the
[1:41:12] word just come to the word
[1:41:14] [Music]
[1:41:18] she knows that
[1:41:19] there is not yet time for him do certain
[1:41:21] things he must now do but he will now
[1:41:23] fulfill through the bride that work
[1:41:26] which he left for this specific time you
[1:41:28] know what that work is saints
[1:41:30] it's not for us to go stand on top of
[1:41:32] the building do many mighty miracles
[1:41:35] it's for the word
[1:41:37] to be lived out
[1:41:38] from the youngest
[1:41:40] to the oldest
[1:41:42] satan in battle
[1:41:44] pounding against trying to deceive
[1:41:46] trying to trip up trying to discourage
[1:41:49] and this little bride
[1:41:50] is simply saying
[1:41:52] thus saith the lord
[1:41:54] he said i'm the word
[1:41:56] the word is in me
[1:41:58] i will fulfill the word
[1:42:00] it's my heart's desire it's all i ever
[1:42:02] wanted to be
[1:42:03] is just the word manifested in this day
[1:42:06] that he called me to and i'll do it do i
[1:42:09] make mistakes well you want quote on
[1:42:11] that you can find it in the message
[1:42:12] brother brahm said you will make
[1:42:14] mistakes
[1:42:16] the focus is not on the mistake
[1:42:19] the focus
[1:42:20] is on your ministry
[1:42:22] of the word
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:24] there is what he's speaking
[1:42:28] oh my
[1:42:29] hallelujah
[1:42:31] you see
[1:42:32] this bride saints
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:36] she will only
[1:42:38] minister the pure word back
[1:42:41] to the bridegroom
[1:42:46] says revelation
[1:42:48] the only thing my bridegroom
[1:42:50] will hear
[1:42:53] is the pure word
[1:42:54] because he is the word
[1:42:57] so any wife that loves her husband
[1:43:01] she's not going to make
[1:43:03] i don't know sorry for the silly example
[1:43:06] if he loves apple pie
[1:43:08] she's not going to go make him some
[1:43:10] black chocolate something truffle
[1:43:13] whatever pudding pie
[1:43:17] you can tell i'm a little prejudiced
[1:43:21] she's gonna make him an apple pie
[1:43:22] because she loves them
[1:43:26] she's not going to make up a pie not
[1:43:28] just take this tongue-in-cheek brother
[1:43:30] george comes to our house
[1:43:32] i look around there
[1:43:33] i've joked this before and i'm just
[1:43:35] being transparent with you i want to
[1:43:36] drive the point home to you i was like
[1:43:38] wife
[1:43:40] jerry
[1:43:42] there's two cream pies here on the
[1:43:44] counter do you love brother george more
[1:43:45] than me
[1:43:49] where's the where's an apple pie where's
[1:43:50] the cherry pie where where is that
[1:43:54] she's like you shouldn't be eating them
[1:43:59] brother george comes in there
[1:44:01] oh god bless you sister jerry she just
[1:44:03] beams she just beams thank you
[1:44:08] now look my brother and sister i hope
[1:44:09] you catch this point i use that very
[1:44:11] direct point
[1:44:12] that's not how the bride's gonna treat
[1:44:14] christ
[1:44:16] well our
[1:44:17] pastor prefers this our church prefers
[1:44:19] that you guys quit laughing
[1:44:23] no lord we're going to do it this way
[1:44:26] no what's this bride going to do
[1:44:28] he wants me to worship him he wants me
[1:44:30] to give praise to him he wants me to
[1:44:32] live a righteous and holy and glorified
[1:44:36] life singing praises to his name saying
[1:44:39] lord we love you lord you're so
[1:44:41] beautiful to me lord i can live without
[1:44:44] you thank you for everything
[1:44:46] it's not going to give praise oh it's
[1:44:48] all about our pastor it's all about our
[1:44:50] pastor it's all about a pastor it's all
[1:44:51] god knows her
[1:44:53] no sir
[1:44:54] [Music]
[1:44:56] so you guys will have a conclusion from
[1:44:58] my little statement brother george come
[1:45:00] along and says sister jerry where's
[1:45:01] brother paul's pie
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:06] yeah
[1:45:08] yeah
[1:45:09] [Music]
[1:45:10] he left to work for a specific time
[1:45:15] you see
[1:45:17] he can't receive any other word and this
[1:45:19] bribe can't receive any other word
[1:45:20] because the original
[1:45:23] that original life is in you and i
[1:45:26] we are
[1:45:27] that original life
[1:45:29] now look first john 2 27
[1:45:32] but the anointing which you have
[1:45:33] received of him abideth in you and ye
[1:45:35] not that any man teach you but as the
[1:45:37] same anointing teaches you of all things
[1:45:40] and his truth and is no lie in even as
[1:45:43] it hath taught you you shall abide in
[1:45:46] him what is that that's the holy ghost
[1:45:49] that's the holy ghost saints leading you
[1:45:52] guiding you strengthening you bringing
[1:45:54] you into his presence
[1:45:56] hallelujah okay one last little quote i
[1:45:58] want to share with you
[1:46:00] amen
[1:46:01] oh hallelujah
[1:46:04] i was four years old when this was
[1:46:05] preached right on the dot
[1:46:08] jesus alone can lead you to that eternal
[1:46:10] life there's no church no denomination
[1:46:13] no preacher no priest
[1:46:15] no nothing else can lead you to it
[1:46:17] you must be led by him
[1:46:20] the only one that can lead you could you
[1:46:22] imagine him leading you out of his word
[1:46:25] which that's him and if he is the word
[1:46:28] and you're part of him
[1:46:30] won't you
[1:46:31] be a part of the word
[1:46:33] the word that god wants to pour the
[1:46:35] waters of salvation upon today to
[1:46:37] identify him today like the apostles
[1:46:40] identified him like luther like wesley
[1:46:42] like people in them days identified him
[1:46:44] this is another age it's the word the
[1:46:47] word said these things we're seeing
[1:46:48] taking place now is predicted to take
[1:46:51] place in this hour so accept jesus
[1:46:54] christ and let him lead you
[1:46:56] to eternal life and so here we are
[1:46:58] saints on this little journey going down
[1:47:00] this road coming to this place we're
[1:47:03] walking
[1:47:04] down the road to our glorious redemption
[1:47:07] we're walking and he's right there and
[1:47:09] he's saying you know what just let him
[1:47:10] lead you
[1:47:12] let him lead you
[1:47:13] can we just let him lead us and we just
[1:47:15] trust him that much
[1:47:17] day by day
[1:47:18] you know my heart i just didn't sleep
[1:47:21] very good last night awake in the middle
[1:47:22] of the night it was just heavy upon my
[1:47:24] heart
[1:47:26] now many of these people might not be
[1:47:27] christians even but just thinking of a
[1:47:29] whole generation of young people raised
[1:47:31] in afghanistan
[1:47:33] from their birth to 18 20 years old here
[1:47:37] they've known a form of liberty and
[1:47:38] stability
[1:47:41] and it looks like hell on earth has
[1:47:43] descended upon them
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:47] but i serve a
[1:47:48] god that he
[1:47:51] will perform his word
[1:47:53] no matter what we think
[1:47:58] do you know when you look at something
[1:48:00] like afghanistan you're seeing a
[1:48:02] physical element taking place right
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:06] but that spiritual warfare right here is
[1:48:08] just as violent
[1:48:10] and just as prevalent and just as
[1:48:13] dominating as it is in the physical form
[1:48:16] mary
[1:48:19] god that will deliver you will deliver
[1:48:21] them pray for them
[1:48:24] this is something sister jerry and i and
[1:48:26] just you might say our devotions or
[1:48:27] whatever something been convicting our
[1:48:29] hearts
[1:48:31] listening to the prophet of god say
[1:48:33] god's going to come for those
[1:48:36] who sigh and cry for the abominations in
[1:48:39] the city
[1:48:40] saints i encourage you
[1:48:42] don't just sit back and pray for your
[1:48:44] family and your friends in your church
[1:48:47] be crying out
[1:48:49] sighing and crying of the abominations
[1:48:51] done in the city
[1:48:53] make a difference
[1:48:54] hallelujah your prayers will reach out
[1:48:56] god hears you you are his bride he's
[1:48:59] given you his word trusted you to
[1:49:01] manifest that word
[1:49:04] let go and let god
[1:49:06] hallelujah
[1:49:07] you know it just sometimes you just get
[1:49:10] a little inspiration of something comes
[1:49:12] upon you and you know sometimes you just
[1:49:15] don't even know what god is doing and
[1:49:17] why you're doing it how the things would
[1:49:19] just
[1:49:20] strike you so strongly and you start to
[1:49:22] lean or look a different way
[1:49:24] start to understand and you know i just
[1:49:29] oh my
[1:49:31] we never fret
[1:49:34] we never feared
[1:49:36] for the pure word of god is here
[1:49:39] that pure word is near walking with us
