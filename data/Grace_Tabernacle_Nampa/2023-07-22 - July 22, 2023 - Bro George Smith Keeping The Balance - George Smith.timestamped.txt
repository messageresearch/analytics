[30:02] here
[30:03] and
[30:05] been to many other places but we're just
[30:07] glad to be back in the house of the Lord
[30:09] with you this evening
[30:12] are you going to sing again okay
[30:14] and um
[30:15] we had a nice evening last night with
[30:17] some refreshments downstairs
[30:20] and I always appreciate the good music
[30:22] here
[30:24] this evening if you have your Bibles
[30:26] with you let's stand and read from
[30:28] Ephesians chapter 4.
[30:30] and um
[30:35] you probably I hope you've heard many of
[30:37] these things before we're just here to
[30:39] remind you we're not here to bring any
[30:40] great New Revelations any shortcuts or
[30:42] anything like that
[30:44] and I haven't discussed any dark secrets
[30:47] with your pastor we talk about once a
[30:49] month or so
[30:50] and he complains about a few things but
[30:53] I try to raise your spirits
[30:56] well you know him
[30:57] but
[30:59] we're here to to encourage you
[31:01] if you bring into the middle of the road
[31:04] where the light is okay Ephesians
[31:07] chapter four we're going to read two
[31:08] sentences
[31:10] one sentence starts with chapter on
[31:12] verse one
[31:14] uh I therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[31:16] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[31:19] vocation wherewith you are called
[31:22] with all Holiness and meekness with
[31:24] long-suffering forbearing one another in
[31:26] love endure endeavoring to keep the
[31:28] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[31:31] it's one sentence
[31:33] the next one starts on verse 11.
[31:36] where it says and he gave some Apostles
[31:40] some prophets some evangelists some
[31:43] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[31:46] of the Saints
[31:49] for the work of the ministry for the
[31:50] edifying of the body of Christ till we
[31:52] all come in the unity and the faith and
[31:56] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[31:58] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[32:00] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[32:02] we henceforth be no more like we used to
[32:05] be no more uh children tossed to and fro
[32:09] and carried about with every wind of
[32:10] Doctrine by the slight of man and
[32:13] cunning craft ends whereby they lie and
[32:14] wait to deceive but speaking the truth
[32:16] in love may grow up unto him in all
[32:20] things which is the head even Christ
[32:22] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[32:26] together and compacted by that whichever
[32:28] rejoice applyeth
[32:30] according to the effectual working in
[32:33] the measure of every part making maketh
[32:36] increase unto the body
[32:37] of the body and to the edifying of
[32:40] itself in love and if you were paying
[32:42] attention three different times in love
[32:46] the word isn't meant to be a club to
[32:48] beat both people over the head because
[32:49] they're not living right the spirit will
[32:51] take care of that that's right you know
[32:53] the church is like a hospital
[32:55] everybody's welcome amen a lot of people
[32:57] don't want to come because so it hurts
[32:59] or they don't serve enough Donuts or
[33:01] whatever but it's like a hospital
[33:04] nobody's checking papers at the door and
[33:06] we come here to see what God has to say
[33:09] to us now look over a few pages to the
[33:11] right in Colossians chapter 4
[33:15] see your Colossians chapter 4
[33:18] right before Thessalonians
[33:21] where Paul is also writing in chapter 4
[33:24] and verse 16. and when this Epistle of
[33:26] the to the Colossians is read among you
[33:29] cause that it be read also in the Church
[33:31] of the Leo seions and the e-like wise
[33:34] read the epistle
[33:36] from laodicea amen amen so it's all the
[33:38] word it all fits together you know
[33:41] let us pray father we thank you for this
[33:43] day you've brought us together we thank
[33:45] you Lord that you have ordained that we
[33:48] could be here and we can share your word
[33:50] with your people bless those that have
[33:52] come blessed those that are watching may
[33:54] you also Inspire them and Lord may you
[33:57] bring your word to pass in each one help
[33:59] us now in Jesus name amen you may be
[34:02] seated
[34:04] and before we get into the
[34:07] preaching them the word I just want to
[34:09] give you a little bit of a report I know
[34:10] that you people are very faithful in
[34:12] helping us with missionary work and some
[34:14] of that work is waiting for you
[34:15] downstairs in the form of the new seal
[34:18] book it's a new book new paragraphs yes
[34:22] we sanded it a little bit
[34:25] uh don't get scared we didn't change any
[34:28] meaning that's right but brother Branham
[34:31] knew his limitations he knew how far and
[34:35] how much he lacked in you know polish
[34:37] and everything
[34:38] while he was here he didn't allow
[34:41] anything to be printed verbatim you know
[34:44] the the at at and no he didn't he never
[34:48] let that happen
[34:49] uh if that would have been the case when
[34:52] he preached the seven Church ages
[34:55] um
[34:56] he said at the beginning now I'm going
[34:58] to write a book and you know all about
[35:00] the Revelation and so forth
[35:03] and he said I could have set up at the
[35:04] house and done it but I wanted to come
[35:06] down here and preach to you people and
[35:07] get the inspiration okay so you preached
[35:09] that whole series
[35:10] mentioned more than once about the book
[35:13] well when he got done life went on
[35:15] nobody lifted a finger
[35:18] and so
[35:20] um a little sister down in Georgia took
[35:22] it upon herself well you said books so I
[35:24] guess I'll do this and so she didn't
[35:26] have the fancy equipment we have today
[35:28] she had a real tape recorder a lot of
[35:31] work go forwards and backwards and
[35:33] backwards and forwards and type off
[35:35] everything he said
[35:37] okay so she comes up one day with a
[35:40] stack of papers so you said your book
[35:41] and so I did my little part now if he
[35:44] wanted to verbatim he could have took
[35:46] that to the printer and then I had a
[35:47] book in two weeks that wasn't what he
[35:49] wanted
[35:51] I knew him okay and so he worked at it
[35:54] worked at it five years later we have
[35:56] the church age book
[35:58] and three weeks later he's gone
[36:00] okay so
[36:03] um he wanted his work to be understood
[36:05] you know what he said you know what he
[36:08] meant to say and so uh just simple
[36:11] things like I come down today no I came
[36:14] down today
[36:15] now we speak English you don't speak
[36:17] some of you speak Russian or other
[36:18] things but you've got to have it in a
[36:20] word that that makes sense
[36:22] you can't translate a wrong verb
[36:24] anyway so I've taken the Liberty to go
[36:27] through the seal book with a fine-tooth
[36:29] comb and change those little things
[36:33] he came down today cause is because and
[36:36] so forth so anyway those are downstairs
[36:37] and you order them if you need more we
[36:40] have more okay
[36:42] um it was printed first in Spanish now
[36:45] these books are printed in China they do
[36:47] good work they have no idea what they're
[36:49] printing they just get the check print
[36:51] the book so
[36:53] um it was printed in Spanish first I
[36:55] think we printed forty thousand they
[36:57] went through all Latin America and
[36:59] um they're you know distributed here in
[37:01] America also
[37:02] and now we're going to print more of the
[37:05] English these are just the ones we sell
[37:06] here in America and Canada but our
[37:09] brother wants to print 40 uh like a
[37:11] hundred thousand to go to Africa and all
[37:13] these places that some of these people
[37:14] haven't even seen a book in years well
[37:16] let's give them something they can
[37:17] understand you know in their language
[37:19] and that's why I appreciate the
[37:21] scriptures that we have for over 500
[37:22] years it's in our language it's in a
[37:25] words that you're going to understand we
[37:27] don't have to argue about it this is
[37:29] what it says okay so what we've read
[37:32] here is brother Paul
[37:34] the messenger first messenger he's
[37:37] setting truth into the church he's
[37:38] planting the seeds you see and it's all
[37:41] by Revelation he wasn't there at the
[37:43] Last Supper he wasn't there he was still
[37:45] small he was you know training as a
[37:48] Pharisee but he wrote these words from a
[37:51] very dark dinsy dirty prison in Rome it
[37:54] wasn't a jail like we have today with
[37:55] three meals in color TV no very very uh
[37:59] bad and um
[38:01] what he's written for us here in
[38:03] Ephesians is the the program for the
[38:07] Church of the Living God people like you
[38:10] that want to follow the truth now we've
[38:12] got big churches all of them down the
[38:13] same road big churches
[38:15] I don't know how they even pay the
[38:16] lights but you know
[38:19] um uh they're not they're not getting
[38:21] the Revelation they're reading the same
[38:23] Bible
[38:23] but it's it's just you know kind of
[38:26] plastic but the word is written for
[38:28] elect it's written for believers you see
[38:30] and so many uh read the word they
[38:34] memorize so forth but it's only for the
[38:37] elect of God you see and so
[38:41] um the uh we could actually say these
[38:43] are our marching orders you know it's
[38:45] our model it's our rules now I did bring
[38:47] the level again because you know I don't
[38:49] know if you had an earthquake or
[38:50] anything while I was gone that's pretty
[38:53] good uh I guess the carpet makes a
[38:55] little difference
[38:56] but um
[38:58] it's just a simple reminder it you know
[39:01] you got to stay balanced doesn't matter
[39:03] what you eat or how you drive your car
[39:05] or whatever you got to stay balanced you
[39:08] see and um
[39:11] uh these words that Paul wrote back here
[39:14] are important to us he said let this be
[39:16] read with the letter sins also that's us
[39:19] and so it was written to us also and so
[39:22] we're not just another church down the
[39:24] road we are connected to the original
[39:26] you see God has his word divided into
[39:30] portions we're in the seventh age and he
[39:33] sent us a message to return us back to
[39:36] the original amen connect us with the
[39:38] original now uh some of you been to
[39:42] Israel with us and a lot of times over
[39:44] there people ask us who are you people
[39:46] because we don't look like Baptists we
[39:48] don't look like Pentecostals but we look
[39:50] like the Orthodox women over there with
[39:52] the nice dresses and the nice hair
[39:55] and so if we're talking to Jewish people
[39:57] I tell them look we are the Orthodox of
[40:00] the Protestants
[40:02] they can kind of understand that you
[40:05] know and if we're talking to so-called
[40:07] Christians I tell them look we are the
[40:09] original Catholics we follow the
[40:11] teachings of Paul and Peter and Jesus
[40:13] and that shuts them up you know because
[40:15] they're not
[40:17] so what we have is important to us
[40:20] because when brother Brown had the
[40:22] experience of beyond the curtain of time
[40:24] uh you've read it all and you've heard
[40:27] it but the angel said and um and you're
[40:30] going to be judged for what you preached
[40:32] well if the angel comes and tells
[40:34] brother Paul that tonight he's going to
[40:36] want to go back there and race a few
[40:38] things because we're human we make
[40:40] mistakes uh brother Branham admitted to
[40:43] making some mistakes but anyway he said
[40:45] will Paul have to stand with his people
[40:46] well he'd be just yep sure will he says
[40:49] I preached the same word that he did
[40:51] exactly stayed with the same gospel
[40:55] now Paul didn't preach English don't get
[40:57] so critical Paul preached to all kinds
[41:00] of people brother Brian was way over
[41:02] here 2000 years later preaching the same
[41:05] thing but when he's when he said those
[41:07] words us and many more he said millions
[41:10] threw up their hands were resting on
[41:12] that that you preached you know there's
[41:14] a straight line all through this
[41:16] and so
[41:18] we have a lot of people today that are
[41:20] saying different things in different
[41:22] times but you see in in Paul's Ministry
[41:26] he um he traveled maybe 10 000 miles
[41:29] over 30 years walked a lot maybe wrote
[41:32] on an animal but he had been in an area
[41:35] called galatia and he had preached and
[41:38] been people baptized and he came back a
[41:41] few months later and some some guys that
[41:45] come along trying to twist people's
[41:47] minds yeah he said that but over here
[41:49] you got to do this and that and so he
[41:51] says over here in chapter one of
[41:53] Galatians verse 6 I Marvel I'm surprised
[41:56] that you're so soon removed from him
[41:59] that called you unto Grace of Christ
[42:02] unto the you know unto another gospel
[42:05] which is not another but there would be
[42:07] something that trouble you and would
[42:09] pervert the gospel of Christ
[42:12] we have seen that this isn't some
[42:14] mystery
[42:16] he says but the we or an angel even if
[42:19] an angel comes out of heaven and
[42:21] preaches any other gospel unto you than
[42:23] that which we have preached you know by
[42:25] Revelation let him be accursed as I just
[42:28] said I'm going to repeat for those who
[42:29] aren't paying attention I say again if
[42:32] any man preach that's any man that's not
[42:35] just me or Silas that concludes Paul and
[42:37] me and William Brown and everybody else
[42:38] if any man you see
[42:42] um
[42:43] it comes and preaches any other gospel
[42:45] unto you than that which we have than
[42:46] what you have received let him be
[42:48] accursed that means throw him out he's
[42:51] going to the hot place so we got to draw
[42:53] some lines
[42:55] okay and it's not always about drawing
[42:57] people into the big circle they keep
[42:59] jumping out okay there's a limit you
[43:01] know and so we have this filter here to
[43:05] go by yes if it doesn't match scripture
[43:08] out of here that's right brother Brown
[43:10] says the same thing and so if it's not
[43:13] scripture it's heresy it's just that
[43:15] simple and if that hair lifts you well
[43:17] that's just the way it is but brother
[43:19] Ram says over here in the church age
[43:21] book in every age we have exactly the
[43:23] same pattern I wasn't just back there
[43:26] it's today also
[43:28] that is why the light comes through some
[43:30] god-given messenger in a certain area
[43:32] and then from that messenger there
[43:34] spreads of light through the ministry of
[43:36] others
[43:37] who have been Faithfully taught oh
[43:39] that's the catch right there Faithfully
[43:42] taught Faithfully paid attention and so
[43:44] forth
[43:45] but of course not all those who go out
[43:47] always learn how necessary it is to
[43:49] speak only what the messenger has spoken
[43:51] remember Paul warned the people back
[43:54] then to say only what he said First
[43:57] Corinthians 14 37 If any man thinking
[43:59] himself to be Prophet or spiritual let
[44:01] him acknowledge that the things that I
[44:03] write unto you are the Commandments of
[44:05] the Lord not just a good idea not just
[44:07] because I felt like it what's
[44:09] Commandments of the Lord mean Authority
[44:11] authoritative worth following and
[44:14] absolute and that's what we're resting
[44:16] on
[44:17] That's the basis we're on the same basis
[44:19] so he says they add here they take away
[44:22] their
[44:23] and soon the message is no longer pure
[44:25] and the Revival dies down how careful we
[44:28] must be to hear one voice for the spirit
[44:30] has but one voice which is the voice of
[44:33] God Paul warned them to say what he said
[44:35] even as Peter did likewise he warned
[44:37] them that even he could not change one
[44:40] word of what he'd already given by
[44:42] revelation
[44:43] how important it is to hear the voice of
[44:44] God by way of his Messengers and then
[44:47] say what has been given to them to say
[44:48] to the churches
[44:50] so as long as we're all preaching the
[44:52] same word it works fine but we get these
[44:55] things that are you know going across
[44:57] and no it doesn't work
[44:59] so what we're speaking about tonight I
[45:01] forgot to tell you Christians on the
[45:03] side roads
[45:05] if we were all on the on the same
[45:07] Highway it wouldn't be a problem but
[45:08] we've got some of these Christians are
[45:10] out there you know wandering out looking
[45:12] for something else you see and so over
[45:15] here in the seventh age do we still
[45:16] qualify for these words that we just
[45:18] read you see are we following the
[45:21] instructions or are we just coming to
[45:22] church to do Paula favor are we coming
[45:24] here to soak up the free air
[45:26] conditioning
[45:27] there's no free food tonight sorry
[45:29] that's tomorrow
[45:31] you missed it last night
[45:33] but um everyone has a place in the word
[45:36] okay God is in charge of the whole
[45:38] program
[45:40] so we've been called away from our
[45:41] hedonistic ways that we had as Gentiles
[45:44] and we are blood-bought children who are
[45:47] purchased with a price
[45:48] and when we leave the blood out of our
[45:50] message then we we don't have much okay
[45:52] so he has called us to adoption
[45:56] from our ways to his ways okay and I
[45:59] hope some of this will make sense to you
[46:00] and God will interpret it to you
[46:02] correctly but um we don't deserve it but
[46:05] it's God's grace that he's provided
[46:07] along the way
[46:08] that's the sign out front
[46:10] Grace Tabernacle
[46:12] we should be
[46:13] you know uh people that show that Grace
[46:16] to others we're forgiven we know how to
[46:19] forgive others okay in Romans 9 16 so
[46:23] then it is not of him that willeth nor
[46:25] of him that runeth but of God that
[46:27] showeth Mercy you see
[46:29] and God rich and mercy has made a way
[46:32] for me and you to be hooked into the
[46:33] truth not just because we you know like
[46:36] it and um
[46:38] when we get to the other side one of the
[46:41] things to me of course would be all
[46:42] kinds of things to enjoy but one thing
[46:44] will be I want to hear how you made it
[46:46] over how did you Russian people get here
[46:49] all places and enjoy the word you know I
[46:53] mean all those stories yeah this won't
[46:55] be no clock we can enjoy those stories
[46:57] you know and
[46:59] um uh the Living Word has made us and
[47:02] brought us into Focus uh because God has
[47:06] a photo album God made a photo album at
[47:09] your best amen
[47:10] when we had hair
[47:14] I was over to see your dad today
[47:17] yeah
[47:18] and I sat there for about 15 minutes now
[47:21] who's that guy over there
[47:24] and he kept looking at me
[47:26] well you don't look like George
[47:30] anyway we had a good time but um yeah he
[47:33] made a photo album of us at our best
[47:35] and that's where we're going back to
[47:37] we're following towards that Vision you
[47:39] see and um
[47:41] he has um uh called us to adopt us into
[47:45] full position as Sons and Daughters not
[47:47] cousins not Beggars but children with
[47:50] full rights and access to his Bounty and
[47:53] so the light came to a specific
[47:55] messenger in our age in our language
[47:58] even
[47:59] you don't have to worry about a
[48:00] translation
[48:01] like everybody else it's right there in
[48:04] Kentucky language everybody can
[48:05] understand and so he said in message
[48:07] perfect strength here's something to
[48:09] console us here's something that
[48:11] encourages out of weakness and humility
[48:13] God chooses the people to build his
[48:15] kingdom
[48:17] no he doesn't look for the best he uses
[48:19] all kinds of people you see if we ever
[48:22] get to heaven now you'd think that the
[48:24] prophet of God could be a little more
[48:25] encouraging wouldn't you and when you
[48:27] all get to heaven you know no he said if
[48:29] we ever get to heaven if we ever stand
[48:32] in the presence of God with his church
[48:34] we'll stand with a bunch of people
[48:36] that's been weak and rejected and cast
[48:39] out by the world and know it nothing
[48:42] amen well people don't know anything
[48:45] that's
[48:47] you know you don't have to know a bunch
[48:48] of just that just believe you see and so
[48:51] he says isn't it strange that God
[48:53] likened us to sheep a sheep is the most
[48:55] helpless thing there is
[48:57] nothing so insufficient of Defense as a
[49:00] sheep a rabbit can run a squirrel can
[49:03] get in a tree a dog can bite a lion can
[49:06] tear a horse can kick a bird can fly but
[49:09] a sheep is helpless
[49:11] now the this isn't real deep stuff but
[49:14] it's stuff that you need to understand
[49:15] because God is revealing himself in
[49:17] Simplicity you see that's the way God
[49:20] wants us realize that we are totally
[49:22] insufficient then God takes that person
[49:25] and begins to mold himself into that
[49:27] person make his hands do what God would
[49:29] have hands to do make his lips speak
[49:32] what God's lips would speak because
[49:34] they're not his it's not mine they're
[49:37] Gods he begins to build character begins
[49:39] to take this weakness and to make his
[49:42] own self
[49:44] now it was easy to see when brother
[49:46] Brandon was here
[49:48] that oh yeah Hebrews 13 8 that's right
[49:50] Jesus Christ same yesterday today
[49:52] forever okay well I got news for you
[49:54] that was 70 years ago
[49:55] we're the tomorrow
[49:57] we're we're the today now so it should
[50:00] show like we said the other day after
[50:03] where I was that
[50:05] we are what we eat amen I tell you that
[50:08] but you know if you if you lead KFC
[50:10] every day it's going to show
[50:13] right Paul
[50:14] yeah so we need a balanced diet that's
[50:17] why God gives five Ministries that we
[50:19] just read about okay so let's keep going
[50:22] here
[50:23] um so um we're talking about God
[50:26] manifested in human flesh 2023.
[50:29] we can look back at 2 000 years of
[50:32] History everybody and you know boys
[50:34] should understand in Nampa oh yeah God's
[50:37] truth no they're not all cut out for
[50:39] that the Bride is a special people you
[50:42] see and so it wasn't only in the for the
[50:45] scriptural Prophet but for members of
[50:47] his bride that Christ died for that's
[50:49] the ones they're going to reveal him
[50:50] today now Satan's not impressed of how
[50:53] many books and tapes and everything that
[50:55] you've got on the Shelf everybody's got
[50:57] some nice books I've been to homes where
[50:58] they got you know five different
[51:00] versions and 16 Bibles God Satan's not
[51:03] impressed with that
[51:04] but when your soul is fed and nourished
[51:07] on the word and you begin to manifest
[51:10] yeah right you see it I mean you you can
[51:13] talk all day about a certain diet but if
[51:16] it's not showing what your faults are
[51:18] advertisement you know but so
[51:21] um when when your soul is fed and
[51:22] nourished by the word and you manifest
[51:24] the word
[51:25] that's when Satan gets out of bed you
[51:28] know so the body of Christ is edified by
[51:30] the true Ministry of the word
[51:32] Under the Umbrella of the anointing of
[51:34] Malachi 4 and these five five Ministries
[51:37] are for variety and for a balanced diet
[51:39] and you can thank God that you have a
[51:42] pastor that's not afraid to have
[51:43] somebody else come in and say it
[51:45] differently but of a similar spirit
[51:48] you see okay
[51:50] so Saints are perfected by the word okay
[51:54] then we become more closely identified
[51:55] with Christ and Hebrews 13 8 shows so we
[51:59] come right into his very image by
[52:01] feeding on the body word the message of
[52:04] the messenger that God sent and we have
[52:06] a saying in Spanish that when you're
[52:07] hungry I mean when you're thirsty really
[52:10] thirsty
[52:12] you don't care what color the faucet is
[52:14] you just got to have the water
[52:17] so Jesus Christ is reflected in his
[52:20] bride across the world we look like him
[52:23] and um if we if we have his spirit
[52:26] because people they Wonder where's the
[52:30] Christians well when you walk by it
[52:31] people ought to notice that you're
[52:34] different oh where do you go to church
[52:36] what do you believe what we believe the
[52:38] scripture you know we don't have to have
[52:40] a sign on our chest like the people over
[52:42] here at the big church I mean they were
[52:44] on the plane the other day yeah Elder so
[52:46] and so they're 23 years old they're no
[52:48] Elder you know
[52:51] it should show in the way you treat
[52:53] people the way you react to things then
[52:56] they will ask the question see oh you
[52:58] believe the word yeah right here there's
[53:00] five comings of Elijah oh I don't know
[53:02] that a lot of people don't know that
[53:03] that's right they heard about Elijah in
[53:05] Elijah they don't know anything after
[53:07] that so
[53:09] we were not looking for God God is
[53:11] looking for us you see
[53:13] and by his Spirit that's how we respond
[53:16] to the call The Eagle was already an
[53:19] eagle right now I've Got Friends that'll
[53:21] argue all day that only when the eagle
[53:24] came flying over that's when the little
[53:26] bird converted to be an eagle
[53:28] that's not true we have something in us
[53:31] that responds to the word
[53:33] he was already an eagle you see and um
[53:36] so in the Scripture it shows what we
[53:39] should be especially here at the top of
[53:41] the right being of the tree you know and
[53:43] the top of the pyramid and so we've come
[53:46] tonight only to you know hold up the
[53:48] mirror of the word that you can see
[53:51] yourself in the word amen this mirror
[53:53] doesn't need cleaning like the one at
[53:55] you know the house or the hotel it's
[53:57] it's already clean it's got to get in
[53:59] the right position with the right light
[54:01] that you can see yourself oh that's me
[54:04] exactly right and so um
[54:07] we were forgiven and we're on our way to
[54:10] Perfection okay so what makes us
[54:13] different because we have a revelation
[54:15] that we're aiming at amen see Abraham
[54:18] was a natural guy and God said you're
[54:20] going to have a son by Sarah
[54:22] he thought it's the next month no time
[54:25] walked on went on
[54:27] 25 years later
[54:30] and if you study that real close Ishmael
[54:33] was born because Sarah got impatient
[54:37] she had this bright idea
[54:39] and um so when Isaac is born Ishmael is
[54:43] already 13 years old he's been telling
[54:46] everybody my son my son no this is your
[54:48] son over here and they're fighting until
[54:50] this day that's what the big fuss is
[54:52] about they're both children of Abraham
[54:53] and um as we've pointed out when we go
[54:56] over there
[54:57] when when God divided the land
[55:00] he gave so many square miles to Israel
[55:04] and his twelve sons and he gave so many
[55:06] square miles to Isaac and his 12th cents
[55:09] okay but because of the wars and because
[55:12] of all the corruption and all the
[55:13] confusion Israel today is living on 17
[55:16] of the original Grant
[55:19] and the Arabs want to push him into the
[55:21] sea
[55:22] and America is making some wrong
[55:23] decisions and every time we tell them
[55:25] how to run their business we get natural
[55:27] disasters every time
[55:30] so
[55:31] that's all I have to say about that
[55:33] um
[55:34] so anyway yeah Abraham was going towards
[55:36] a vision it wasn't his imagination it
[55:40] was a revelation and it matched God's
[55:42] word okay so by faith Abraham he
[55:45] persevered he stayed with the original
[55:47] vision and after 25 years he was turned
[55:50] back now some of you might be hearing
[55:51] this for the same first time but Abraham
[55:54] and Sarah were already close to 100
[55:58] not like your dad close to 100. but he
[56:01] was turned back young that they could
[56:03] have the son that was promised because
[56:04] God said so you see so it is with the
[56:07] Rapture it's right out in front of us we
[56:09] can we can feel the the anointing you
[56:12] see and um the scripture says he that
[56:14] shall endure unto the end the same shall
[56:16] be saved
[56:18] so we must get beyond what we call what
[56:21] brother Brown calls sense-bound
[56:23] existence that's right we're totally
[56:25] captivated by sense-bound existence the
[56:28] reason you're sitting there comfortable
[56:29] is because somebody is back there
[56:32] messing with the thermostat got it right
[56:34] about you know average Some People Want
[56:37] it colder Some People Want it hotter got
[56:40] to bring a blanket sometimes but we feel
[56:43] comfortable because of the thermostat
[56:45] and when people get married when they're
[56:47] over 25 or 30 that's the first argument
[56:51] the thermostat
[56:53] right
[56:56] I want it this way
[56:58] so we we got to get beyond our
[57:00] sense-bound existence brother Brenham
[57:03] used at four places in prayer and may we
[57:06] lay our tired weary Souls at your feet
[57:08] tonight and drink until we bathe into
[57:10] the beauty of God until we forget all
[57:12] about this sense-bound existence
[57:15] and move out yonder into a place in the
[57:18] Spheres beyond the stars where we can
[57:20] find favor with God find healing for our
[57:22] bodies and rest for our souls
[57:24] so it's not an imagination it's real
[57:26] another place God take us away from this
[57:29] sense-bound existence carry us out there
[57:32] in those Realms where all things are
[57:34] possible yes it is a place that we can
[57:37] attain to now come near to me father and
[57:40] anoint thy servant and pack me from this
[57:43] sense-bound existence into the Spheres
[57:45] where you live and may this be done
[57:48] through Jesus Christ's name that I might
[57:51] know the diseases and the thoughts of
[57:52] the people's minds
[57:54] he was human he lived in two dimensions
[57:57] and that was his prayer May every person
[57:59] in here that's Bound by sense-bound
[58:01] existence only trusting in what they can
[58:04] see here takes feel of smell may they
[58:07] fall away from that tonight and go into
[58:09] the Heavenly realms
[58:11] it is possible and that's why we're
[58:14] trying to say something here that will
[58:16] encourage you to get off of the side
[58:18] roads back to the original okay
[58:22] so we got we have to get beyond our
[58:24] comfort zone see that's comfortable what
[58:27] we're if everything is comfortable yeah
[58:29] nice who wants to go to heaven we've got
[58:32] heaven right here
[58:33] now it's going to get tough you don't
[58:35] have to look very far it's going to get
[58:37] really tough we're going to be out of
[58:38] our comfort zone and you know we depend
[58:40] on our surroundings but we've got to
[58:42] find our identity in the word of God you
[58:44] see and not with just good personalities
[58:47] and religious opinions and message camps
[58:50] message camps served their purpose
[58:54] and you don't have to try to you know
[58:55] smile and pretend like it's not true I
[58:57] know that every one of you came from
[58:58] some place where it was a certain way
[59:00] and we were right and they're all wrong
[59:04] we have that idea right I I knew that as
[59:07] a Baptist we were right all those guys
[59:09] are wrong Pentecost so forget it you
[59:11] know but God's word says a little
[59:14] different
[59:15] it brings us into a reality where we
[59:17] live the grace of God we love these
[59:20] people knowing that not everybody's
[59:22] going but God's the judge you see
[59:25] and so God has sent his word and he's
[59:29] declared us to be free we're not bound
[59:32] by these things you see in October of 63
[59:35] Brethren preached a message pardoned but
[59:38] it's now coming into effect
[59:40] most of us were ignorant of God's plan
[59:42] back then most were only listening they
[59:46] weren't you know they were they were
[59:47] watching they weren't listening he was
[59:49] preaching he's going over their head
[59:50] they're watching but now it's when it's
[59:52] coming into effect and so what happened
[59:54] down through the years
[59:56] yeah because I I've been in this over 50
[59:59] years that's right I'm not the young guy
[1:00:00] I look like and so we built fences okay
[1:00:04] fences with the best of intentions
[1:00:07] to secure our pet doctrines to secure
[1:00:11] our opinions of those that we thought
[1:00:14] were smarter than us that's right but it
[1:00:16] wasn't God's plan see
[1:00:19] and um
[1:00:20] people helped us to build defenses
[1:00:24] and um
[1:00:25] but now it's time to tear down the
[1:00:27] fences
[1:00:29] rise above the fanaticism rise above the
[1:00:31] barriers because we're free the
[1:00:33] scripture says if the son shall make you
[1:00:35] free you are free indeed
[1:00:39] and so
[1:00:41] we're pardoned we can fly into Heavenly
[1:00:43] places we can get back Beyond this
[1:00:45] sense-bound existence get out of our our
[1:00:48] comfort zone you see
[1:00:50] um you remember the story about Johnny
[1:00:51] Crowe somebody you know I don't know the
[1:00:54] whole story but but somebody captured a
[1:00:57] crow put a wire on him and had him in a
[1:01:00] little house had his little bowl of food
[1:01:01] a little bowl of water well that's all
[1:01:03] he could do go out there you know that
[1:01:05] half half moon existence
[1:01:08] and and that's the only farther he could
[1:01:10] go couldn't Fly Away
[1:01:12] but somebody come along and cut the wire
[1:01:14] one day
[1:01:15] but that's all he knew that that's all
[1:01:17] he could do he he didn't know that he
[1:01:18] was free well the other crows flew
[1:01:20] across Johnny you're free to come fly
[1:01:22] with us no I gotta stay right here this
[1:01:24] is my it's my little world no we're free
[1:01:26] yeah go beyond this nonsense you see
[1:01:31] so we can fly into Highway holiness
[1:01:36] but our journey begins at the foot of
[1:01:38] the cross amen and if you haven't been
[1:01:40] there you're not going anywhere you're
[1:01:41] going to hell you got to start at the
[1:01:43] foot of the cross very simple
[1:01:46] right and that's where Jesus Paid It All
[1:01:48] not just a portion you know and we
[1:01:51] continue with the payment plan the way
[1:01:52] the big church
[1:01:54] uh about you know they teach that but
[1:01:56] Calvary was a full payment amen and so
[1:02:00] if we fully repent baptized according to
[1:02:02] the scriptures
[1:02:04] then we proceed to receive the baptism
[1:02:06] the Holy Ghost like they did in the
[1:02:09] early church
[1:02:10] if you don't don't remember the book of
[1:02:12] Acts next time I come we'll start the
[1:02:14] book of Acts again
[1:02:16] yeah we need a review you know but um
[1:02:21] our goal we're not just going around
[1:02:23] circles oh we're going towards the Gate
[1:02:25] of the Resurrection we're headed
[1:02:27] someplace you see and our foundational
[1:02:29] scriptures Matthew or in Malachi 4
[1:02:33] Matthew 17 and some of these places
[1:02:36] um this very Ministry that William
[1:02:38] Branham had is still going on is the
[1:02:41] Fulfillment of scriptures this day these
[1:02:44] scriptures are being fulfilled amen now
[1:02:46] I know that some of you got relatives
[1:02:48] and I got friends
[1:02:49] they don't think this is the Fulfillment
[1:02:51] of God's word
[1:02:53] well then go find him because Jesus said
[1:02:55] Elijah will come restore all things if
[1:02:58] that wasn't this ministry go search
[1:03:01] somewhere you know leave us alone
[1:03:05] okay so we have been turned and we are
[1:03:10] the message of the hour today it's not
[1:03:12] just tapes and books in Bible no we are
[1:03:15] the expression of God today you see it
[1:03:17] uh we are the Fulfillment of the
[1:03:20] ministry and so um the um
[1:03:24] the truth is that uh
[1:03:28] uh the message the word is for believers
[1:03:30] all those people going down the road
[1:03:32] they don't care
[1:03:33] yeah people you see at Walmart they
[1:03:35] don't care
[1:03:35] passing out tracks isn't going to solve
[1:03:37] too many problems no they have to come
[1:03:39] under the anointing of the word but they
[1:03:41] don't care they don't want to be under
[1:03:42] the word you see so it's for believers
[1:03:45] believers who have stayed with the
[1:03:47] original
[1:03:48] and not out on some tantrum amen
[1:03:52] new word right you haven't heard that
[1:03:53] lately but see Tantrums are when you go
[1:03:56] off on side roads well Paul who cares
[1:03:59] now we're going to go this way okay
[1:04:00] you're going to pay a price you see it
[1:04:02] and you're on a side road you're
[1:04:04] wandering away from Christ so we have to
[1:04:06] return to the faith of the founding
[1:04:09] fathers the way it was at its Inception
[1:04:13] and unadulterated and pure back to
[1:04:16] Paul's teaching because we're resting on
[1:04:19] that those aren't just good ideas you
[1:04:21] see
[1:04:22] so if we look back to the foundation
[1:04:23] acts 4 they took knowledge uh of them
[1:04:27] that they had been with Jesus
[1:04:30] as anybody even hinted
[1:04:33] that wow you're a Christian I'd like to
[1:04:35] I'd like to know what you believe I like
[1:04:36] to go to church with you
[1:04:37] did anybody think that you were an angel
[1:04:39] or that you were Jesus Christ people
[1:04:42] thought about William Branham that way
[1:04:43] because he lived such a life he lived a
[1:04:46] life that exemplified the word and they
[1:04:49] should be seeing that in US you see so
[1:04:52] um can they see it of us can they say it
[1:04:54] of us in Acts 11 when the Gospel of
[1:04:56] Jesus Christ was beginning they first
[1:04:58] called the disciples Christians at
[1:05:01] Antioch there was a city that's now up
[1:05:04] in turkey and uh and so um because there
[1:05:08] was a noticeable difference in the way
[1:05:09] they acted they they handled their
[1:05:11] problems differently than the other
[1:05:13] people they didn't gripe and gossip and
[1:05:15] everything they were Christians you see
[1:05:17] so can that be said of us we sing the
[1:05:20] song praise God there's been a change in
[1:05:21] me
[1:05:23] really
[1:05:24] yeah I mean if you don't believe these
[1:05:25] songs you shouldn't be singing them
[1:05:27] because it's it's it's it's prayer you
[1:05:29] know put to music and so um or are you
[1:05:33] comfortable here in dark laodicea
[1:05:35] because it's very dark amen now it
[1:05:37] doesn't look dark because you know we
[1:05:39] got this nice computer we got air
[1:05:41] conditioning everybody's got a you know
[1:05:43] forty thousand dollar car we got watches
[1:05:45] we've got cell phones
[1:05:46] what are you talking about dark we're
[1:05:48] talking spiritually because a long time
[1:05:51] ago 1959 brother brand was preaching in
[1:05:54] the islands of the Caribbean
[1:05:57] and a brother uh that was with him had a
[1:06:01] four-hour interview with him one day and
[1:06:04] he asked brother Branham why do you say
[1:06:06] so much about 1977
[1:06:09] . I both stay with me this is going to
[1:06:10] make sense here in a little bit and so
[1:06:12] that's 18 years in the future who cares
[1:06:15] but brother I said what I said because
[1:06:18] as I was looking down through the stream
[1:06:20] of time which only a prophet can do he
[1:06:23] said when I saw 1977 it was so dark
[1:06:27] spiritually how could any believer live
[1:06:29] in such Darkness
[1:06:31] now we're 40 plus years the other side
[1:06:35] we're living in dark laodicea you better
[1:06:38] Shake yourself and get with the program
[1:06:40] okay
[1:06:42] so
[1:06:44] um there's many Overcomers and I know
[1:06:46] there's some here real Faith Warriors
[1:06:49] Prayer Warriors but my burden is for
[1:06:54] those that are defeated deceived
[1:06:56] children of God that are living below
[1:06:58] their potential living below their
[1:07:00] privileges those that are struggling
[1:07:04] they're not on the main road they're not
[1:07:05] they're not balanced they're off on
[1:07:07] these side roads because so-and-so said
[1:07:09] so and so because of this whatever they
[1:07:12] got all kinds of excuses we got to get
[1:07:14] back to the main road
[1:07:16] okay
[1:07:17] and all they need is for somebody to
[1:07:19] hold up the mirror of the word just just
[1:07:21] hold up Jesus said
[1:07:23] Paul said
[1:07:25] there's no other gospel this is the only
[1:07:27] gospel
[1:07:29] and there will be those that come along
[1:07:30] to deceive yes
[1:07:32] there's a lot of positive promises in
[1:07:35] the word and there's negative promises I
[1:07:38] tell you that but they're in there
[1:07:40] the one that is evident today is in
[1:07:43] Matthew 24 24 where Jesus said in the
[1:07:46] red letters that there's going to be
[1:07:48] something come along that's going to be
[1:07:50] so similar to the truth
[1:07:53] right there it looks exactly like it but
[1:07:57] it will be deceiving and it's going to
[1:08:00] deceive everything except the elect of
[1:08:02] God so there's a number that's elect we
[1:08:05] don't know how many with the Jews we
[1:08:06] know there's 144 000 which is a drop in
[1:08:10] the bucket to the millions that are on
[1:08:11] the planet but we know that number only
[1:08:14] God knows where they are they've lost
[1:08:16] the records now he also says there's
[1:08:18] this number it's going to be deceived
[1:08:20] now we don't know how many
[1:08:23] but it's coming to pass so be careful
[1:08:25] okay
[1:08:27] let's see where we're at
[1:08:28] um
[1:08:30] so the mirror has to be properly put up
[1:08:33] so the question is why are we not in
[1:08:36] position to totally reflect Ephesians 4
[1:08:39] so that it may be said of us there goes
[1:08:42] a real Christian
[1:08:43] a lot of girls have long hair a lot of
[1:08:45] girls have long dresses that's right
[1:08:47] some of them got long tongues
[1:08:49] and some don't know how to dress and
[1:08:52] some of them don't know how to dress and
[1:08:54] carrying Bibles how are we going to tell
[1:08:55] the difference in the life and how they
[1:08:58] react to the word you see oh I wish I
[1:09:01] could live in over a coming life like
[1:09:02] them they remind me of Christ I see the
[1:09:05] spirit of the Bible in your life where
[1:09:07] do you go to church is anybody asking
[1:09:09] those questions lately yeah you see
[1:09:11] Ephesians 4 13 is a promise for us you
[1:09:14] see and so what keeps us from reflecting
[1:09:17] Christ and being the Fulfillment of
[1:09:20] scripture in the 21st century
[1:09:22] we've all been in this church a while we
[1:09:24] all know the truth we all got at least
[1:09:26] one Bible at home
[1:09:28] what keeps us from showing Christianity
[1:09:32] to the world God's Prophet says it's
[1:09:34] because we've gone off on Tantrums
[1:09:37] tantrum is a willful Outburst of
[1:09:39] annoyance or rage a fit a bad temper
[1:09:43] now you've seen those little kids in
[1:09:45] Walmart
[1:09:46] and other places you've seen adults on
[1:09:49] Tantrums sometimes they're on the
[1:09:51] airplane you know
[1:09:52] and so what we can do is calm down
[1:09:55] listen God might be trying to tell you
[1:09:58] something in a simple way I didn't
[1:10:00] invite you here tonight God did God
[1:10:03] brought you here you see can you people
[1:10:05] watch on the internet it's for you too
[1:10:08] so Tantrums are the cause of physical
[1:10:10] ills
[1:10:12] the prophet says God does not want you
[1:10:14] to be sad
[1:10:15] that's right it's okay to laugh in
[1:10:17] church
[1:10:18] that's right you know this is not a
[1:10:18] funeral
[1:10:20] so God doesn't want you to be sad you
[1:10:22] know what ill-temper does that old
[1:10:24] temporal that's one of the awfullest
[1:10:27] things
[1:10:28] it is about 60 percent of the cause of
[1:10:31] all sickness temper
[1:10:34] you better be careful yes sir them
[1:10:37] Tantrums when you fly loose remember
[1:10:39] you're only developing a cancer an ulcer
[1:10:42] or something when you do that
[1:10:44] when you get all stewed up I won't go
[1:10:47] back there anymore wait till I give them
[1:10:48] peace of my mind all right just remember
[1:10:51] you're the one that's going to pay for
[1:10:52] it that's right stay happy
[1:10:56] what did I tell you before make your
[1:10:58] wife laugh every day if he's only
[1:11:00] laughing at your stupidity make her
[1:11:02] laugh
[1:11:06] you know make him laugh that's your job
[1:11:09] so if you're sad it's only a small step
[1:11:11] to ill-temper then it's all downhill
[1:11:14] straight to sickness and death so stay
[1:11:17] happy Christians can laugh
[1:11:20] Tantrums are the cause of spiritual ills
[1:11:24] then the devil looked down and he said I
[1:11:26] got up now because see they they were
[1:11:29] over there on the Sea of Galilee which
[1:11:30] is only a lake about smaller than when
[1:11:33] you got out here the lake which it's
[1:11:35] called a lake but it's called Sea of
[1:11:37] Galilee is eight miles wide 13 miles
[1:11:39] long
[1:11:41] still there same Lake and so
[1:11:44] they got in the boat and they were
[1:11:45] headed out with Jesus up on the mountain
[1:11:47] praying so the devil says I've got a
[1:11:49] chance now they've gone off without him
[1:11:52] um and so he says if I can just get
[1:11:54] brother man says if I can just if he
[1:11:57] Satan can just get the Pentecostal
[1:11:59] church or whatever Church you know to
[1:12:02] start thinking more about their
[1:12:03] buildings and their well-dressed
[1:12:05] congregations than they do of an
[1:12:08] old-fashioned prayer meeting
[1:12:09] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and a
[1:12:12] Godly life and clean up their women and
[1:12:14] clean up the men make them live holy and
[1:12:17] either tow the Mark or get out
[1:12:19] and not put up with so much emphasis on
[1:12:21] money the first thing you know you're
[1:12:23] going to find yourself going off without
[1:12:25] Christ because you've got all these
[1:12:27] plans and you know Boise for Christ and
[1:12:31] oh just get ready to go that's all yeah
[1:12:33] he says brother sister you remember this
[1:12:36] thus saith the Lord the church better
[1:12:38] clean up you're drifting too far out
[1:12:40] come back to the Lord come back to real
[1:12:43] prayer meetings amen we don't have to we
[1:12:46] don't have to get preaching every day
[1:12:47] you can hear tapes every day everywhere
[1:12:49] but we need real prayer meetings amen
[1:12:52] okay
[1:12:53] the devil looked down and said I've got
[1:12:54] them now he began to blow his poisonous
[1:12:57] breath the sea looked like the bottom is
[1:12:59] coming out of it I imagine his devils
[1:13:01] are sitting on every wave oh we've got
[1:13:03] them now we've got them to a sinking
[1:13:04] place and when the Pentecostal people
[1:13:07] or Grace Tabernacle or Tucson Tabernacle
[1:13:09] whatever Tabernacle when they begin to
[1:13:13] act up and their churches begin to act
[1:13:15] the way you're doing get in a little
[1:13:18] group of organizations ah we're against
[1:13:19] that group The Church of God against the
[1:13:21] assemblies assembly against the Church
[1:13:22] of God the Oneness against the tune is
[1:13:24] Tunis gets threeness on and on and on
[1:13:26] it's just the devil and he says I've got
[1:13:29] them separated
[1:13:30] I got them away from him
[1:13:32] it happens we better start paying
[1:13:35] attention
[1:13:38] on the side roads
[1:13:40] he says you did run well what happened
[1:13:42] what happened here your women begin to
[1:13:44] cut their hair
[1:13:46] and that's the first thing people do
[1:13:47] when they turn their back on the Lord
[1:13:50] just watch and then they don't know how
[1:13:52] to dress right and then they do this and
[1:13:54] they do that
[1:13:55] so
[1:13:56] your women begin to cut their hair use
[1:13:58] manicure paint on their face wear all
[1:14:01] kinds you know clothes what did your men
[1:14:03] do begin to carry on like everything you
[1:14:05] know loose living telling jokes some of
[1:14:08] them very not very clean you begin
[1:14:10] taking deacons with two or three wives
[1:14:12] all these kind of things he went off on
[1:14:15] a tantrum without him
[1:14:18] there it is that's why you see so in
[1:14:22] other words not following the rules
[1:14:25] now I travel a lot by car and I noticed
[1:14:28] it on the on the interstate and your
[1:14:31] brother that drives the truck
[1:14:32] the rules are only for certain people
[1:14:36] we drive amongst a lot of important
[1:14:39] people the rules aren't for them
[1:14:41] 70. I want to go 90. there they go
[1:14:45] and they turn left when they sure to
[1:14:47] turn right and all kinds of things going
[1:14:48] on but if you don't follow the rules
[1:14:50] you're going to have problems see so we
[1:14:53] get off on these side roads and that's
[1:14:55] as good as Satan wants it
[1:14:57] you know he's sitting there grinning yep
[1:15:00] got him separated got him not following
[1:15:02] the rules and we end up sad and defeated
[1:15:05] blindly off on some tantrum
[1:15:08] because many times we only go as far as
[1:15:10] to repeat when we should be doing it
[1:15:14] you see
[1:15:15] James 1 22 but he be doers of the word
[1:15:18] not hearers only deceiving your own
[1:15:21] selves you're not fooling God that's
[1:15:23] right you know
[1:15:25] so the prophet says the church has gone
[1:15:28] off without him see you've gone off on
[1:15:30] Tantrums my brother as long as Sin is in
[1:15:33] there I'm going to pound it as hard as I
[1:15:35] can with the gospel till we see the
[1:15:37] drops beat out until I can see God's
[1:15:39] great church with our arms around one
[1:15:41] another forgetting their differences
[1:15:43] bearing the sins behind them and going
[1:15:46] on to Perfection rooting out the
[1:15:48] Thomases the doubters
[1:15:50] yeah I don't care who they are that's
[1:15:52] right oil and water don't mix so when
[1:15:55] you get all the unbelief away God will
[1:15:59] come in and go to working amongst you
[1:16:01] but until you do that he won't do it
[1:16:03] you're drifting off Amen on Tantrums
[1:16:06] individually as groups or whatever
[1:16:09] so
[1:16:10] what are some of the results of drifting
[1:16:12] out
[1:16:13] and going off without him
[1:16:15] see if it see if you qualify it might be
[1:16:18] your problem one is fence building
[1:16:20] but we're so zealous to protect our
[1:16:22] religious ideas and our opinions and our
[1:16:25] favorite quotes we draw lines draw
[1:16:27] everybody out that doesn't do things our
[1:16:29] particular way the man of God says this
[1:16:32] great Pillar of Fire the angel of God
[1:16:35] the logos that went out of God that led
[1:16:37] the children of Israel through the
[1:16:39] Wilderness when it came amongst the
[1:16:41] people the day of Pentecost it separated
[1:16:43] itself and great looks of fire began to
[1:16:46] come up on each one of them
[1:16:48] um
[1:16:49] uh and God dividing himself amongst his
[1:16:51] people that ought to tear the heart out
[1:16:53] of anybody God tearing himself apart
[1:16:56] that he might divide himself a little
[1:16:58] bit with each one of us you see what it
[1:17:00] means can you see why I'm standing for
[1:17:02] the unity of every Church comma every
[1:17:04] Full Gospel Church every believer yeah
[1:17:07] well that narrows down real quick
[1:17:10] standing for the unity of every believer
[1:17:12] of the word we ought to we have one
[1:17:14] heart one mind one Accord no matter how
[1:17:17] much we differ in Scripture that might
[1:17:19] be
[1:17:20] look I love Paul and and Sharia but if I
[1:17:24] lived in a you know in the garage next
[1:17:26] to him we'd find something to argue
[1:17:28] about
[1:17:29] we're individuals we're going to see
[1:17:31] this scripture differently than that he
[1:17:33] says it no matter how much we differ in
[1:17:35] the scriptures one might see it this way
[1:17:37] has nothing to do with it but in
[1:17:39] principle we understand is one Great
[1:17:42] Mighty Army of God marching on
[1:17:45] because each one of you in your
[1:17:47] peculiarity we are peculiar
[1:17:51] I can't preach like Paul he can't speak
[1:17:53] Spanish but we work pretty good together
[1:17:55] you know
[1:17:57] I can't speak Russian either
[1:17:59] but I got friends that do
[1:18:01] so
[1:18:02] he says because each one of you in your
[1:18:04] peculiarity God has proved that he's
[1:18:07] ignoring your Doctrine because he gave
[1:18:09] you the Holy Ghost and the Bible said he
[1:18:10] gave them the holy ghost that obeyed him
[1:18:13] we put so much emphasis on perfecting
[1:18:15] the doctrine and we don't have anybody
[1:18:18] to fellowship with her because nobody
[1:18:19] sees it my way
[1:18:21] yeah
[1:18:22] so if I obey him in my peculiar way you
[1:18:25] obey him in your peculiar way he gave us
[1:18:27] both the Holy Ghost so we have to be
[1:18:29] Christian and Brethren and sisters
[1:18:31] enough arm up together that's not single
[1:18:33] file that's a cross arm up together
[1:18:37] um and March on for one great purpose
[1:18:40] the gospel that others can see that
[1:18:43] Hebrews 13 8 is still true today there
[1:18:46] is a people that's living the gospel so
[1:18:49] we need to put the arguments aside
[1:18:52] draw a line in the sand and go forward
[1:18:54] this stuff everything that happened
[1:18:57] yesterday and last week forget it
[1:19:00] it's back there you got pictures you got
[1:19:02] your cell phone but you can't change
[1:19:04] that that's right and you don't know if
[1:19:06] you're going to live to see sun come up
[1:19:08] tomorrow we hope we do you know we want
[1:19:10] to be back in church and I'm going to
[1:19:12] count heads and see who's missing
[1:19:13] tomorrow
[1:19:14] but uh
[1:19:16] we're living right now we're living in
[1:19:18] this section of time let's take
[1:19:20] advantage of the time we have you see
[1:19:22] and so
[1:19:25] um you know the the neighbors are
[1:19:26] watching your life
[1:19:28] they're watching very closely see how
[1:19:30] you live with all this inflation all you
[1:19:33] think we have problems we we it makes
[1:19:35] news when we have inflation up 0.2
[1:19:39] percent
[1:19:40] one percent oh my area goes crazy well
[1:19:42] Venezuela has
[1:19:44] um inflation of four thousand percent
[1:19:48] those are the people we're trying to
[1:19:49] help
[1:19:50] because they don't have the money to eat
[1:19:53] much less to go to the doctor they've
[1:19:55] got hospitals that are total wrecks if
[1:19:58] you have if you have to have a baby or a
[1:20:01] gallbladder or whatever reason to be in
[1:20:03] the hospital they give you a list now
[1:20:06] here's all stuff you need to bring
[1:20:08] and there will be alcohol and bandages
[1:20:10] and all this stuff that we take for
[1:20:12] granted you've got to bring that with
[1:20:13] you
[1:20:14] and then pay the doctor no it's crazy
[1:20:16] this one sister we'll get back to this
[1:20:19] in just a minute here
[1:20:20] uh one sister I know is a good Chef okay
[1:20:24] she's probably 45 or so but anyway she's
[1:20:28] had a job in a restaurant and people
[1:20:30] liked her cooking when she made her
[1:20:33] special soup people would wait in line
[1:20:35] is to get her soup
[1:20:36] so she would work six days a week 10
[1:20:40] hours a day
[1:20:41] and for that she was paid 35 dollars
[1:20:46] it's in it's just insane
[1:20:48] and so then they had a they contracted
[1:20:51] her for a wedding one day
[1:20:54] and uh
[1:20:55] I'm gonna feed 100 people
[1:20:58] at a wedding they supplied the food but
[1:21:00] she had to do all the cooking and the
[1:21:01] serving her and a Helper and when it's
[1:21:04] all over
[1:21:05] they gave her 15 dollars
[1:21:08] now she was glad to have the job
[1:21:10] but guess what she finally got smart and
[1:21:12] her son that lives by other part of
[1:21:14] South America sent her a ticket she got
[1:21:16] out of there she's got a lives in
[1:21:18] another country now so
[1:21:21] um people are watching how you react all
[1:21:24] this stuff we're living with you see and
[1:21:27] they they don't care what they don't
[1:21:29] really care what the Bible said they
[1:21:30] don't care what William Branham says
[1:21:31] they want to see a life they want to see
[1:21:33] somebody that actually shows it you see
[1:21:36] the message blind Bartimaeus brother REM
[1:21:39] says but we've taken another road he
[1:21:41] never did save Roman to have a seminary
[1:21:43] he did say preach the gospel heal the
[1:21:45] sick raise the Dead cast out Devil's
[1:21:46] freely you have received freely give and
[1:21:48] we've done everything else except that
[1:21:51] we've adopted schools education emotions
[1:21:54] and nomination and we put up barriers
[1:21:57] the methodists we have nothing to do
[1:21:59] with the Baptists Presbyterians have
[1:22:01] nothing to do with you two and the
[1:22:02] Catholics were over the whole thing
[1:22:05] yeah they want the whole thing
[1:22:08] because that's the spirit on them you
[1:22:10] see so
[1:22:12] um no wonder you can't believe he says
[1:22:14] so see we've got too much religious
[1:22:16] fanaticism
[1:22:18] yeah it's crazy right here in our range
[1:22:21] don't worry about how divided the
[1:22:22] Baptists are and all those people no in
[1:22:25] our ranks people carrying these same
[1:22:26] books and bibles
[1:22:28] right Victorious Christians can live
[1:22:31] above fanaticism when they take the word
[1:22:34] seriously and not just carry it around I
[1:22:37] don't care if you're carrying a tablet
[1:22:38] or books or whatever you're carrying
[1:22:40] show the life amen
[1:22:43] don't tell me how great something is if
[1:22:45] you can't live it see so this message is
[1:22:50] our life and people are watching to see
[1:22:52] our testimonies see if we match up
[1:22:56] Philippians 4 7 says the peace of God
[1:22:58] which passes all understanding all
[1:23:00] things you can understand
[1:23:01] I don't know how these cars work I don't
[1:23:03] understand I've got a car I've never
[1:23:05] lifted the hood we pay people to change
[1:23:07] the oil
[1:23:08] you know I don't understand how it works
[1:23:10] I just know you push the button and we
[1:23:11] can go so the peace of God which passes
[1:23:14] all understanding shall keep your hearts
[1:23:16] and Minds through Christ Jesus
[1:23:18] Prophet says and no matter what the
[1:23:21] world has to say about you work to
[1:23:23] please God do everything you can to
[1:23:25] build the kingdom of God never to
[1:23:27] separate it build it together
[1:23:30] he says and if we need to build fences
[1:23:32] it ought to never be a denominational
[1:23:34] type fence it ought to be a love fence
[1:23:37] to keep out the insects to keep out the
[1:23:39] Palmer word he is the devil's number one
[1:23:42] Destroyer
[1:23:43] and as you demonstrate the love of God
[1:23:45] the enemy will have no commonplace to
[1:23:48] come in and we've got to keep the bugs
[1:23:50] out
[1:23:51] in the message rejected King the Holy
[1:23:53] Spirit wants us to have no fences no
[1:23:56] boundary lines he wants us to be one in
[1:23:58] him we are children brothers sisters God
[1:24:01] doesn't separate his children say I'll
[1:24:03] give this one cornbread and beans and
[1:24:04] I'll give this one ice cream and Pie he
[1:24:07] doesn't do that I'll give this one over
[1:24:08] here and I'll let him starve to death he
[1:24:10] feeds them all at the same table
[1:24:12] and the Holy Spirit should lead the
[1:24:14] church so if the holy spirit is leading
[1:24:16] the church we all get fed properly we
[1:24:18] all go away happy but if you come just
[1:24:20] to warm up the bench and stare at the
[1:24:22] preacher well you're not going to get
[1:24:24] much you know
[1:24:26] so with the Holy Spirit leading us
[1:24:28] not some favorite personality or
[1:24:31] favorite preacher he leads us and
[1:24:33] there's no respect of persons you see
[1:24:35] the scripture forbids respected persons
[1:24:38] there's only one worldwide Ministry not
[1:24:40] mine
[1:24:41] Ministry of William Branham okay that's
[1:24:43] where the bride feeds Prophet says what
[1:24:46] the church needs today is the opening up
[1:24:48] of these barriers that's holding them
[1:24:50] back and some Pentecostal Holy Ghost
[1:24:52] vitamins poured back in the church then
[1:24:55] it will change the atmosphere
[1:24:58] so if we turn off the air conditioner
[1:25:00] the atmosphere is going to change
[1:25:02] some people are going to fall asleep
[1:25:03] others can be oh I wish you guys do
[1:25:05] something you know but if we change the
[1:25:07] atmosphere to 72 degrees
[1:25:10] Smile everybody wakes up
[1:25:13] it's true
[1:25:15] okay
[1:25:16] so yeah we um we know that God is
[1:25:19] leading us so in the correct atmosphere
[1:25:21] love fences go up and Satan is
[1:25:24] uncomfortable he moves away and one
[1:25:27] reason we have these barriers is we've
[1:25:29] been focusing on our differences
[1:25:33] now I wouldn't want to be a policeman
[1:25:35] because where are you going to start all
[1:25:37] these people committing crimes crazy
[1:25:40] they have to focus on the difference
[1:25:41] that focus on the wrong things that's
[1:25:43] not our job you see we don't focus on
[1:25:46] the differences
[1:25:48] and
[1:25:49] we we always see why everybody else is
[1:25:53] wrong no you get yourself right and
[1:25:56] everything will look right you see so we
[1:25:59] tend to look over the ministry that God
[1:26:01] has provided in the body what's God if
[1:26:03] he doesn't see it exactly my way I'm not
[1:26:05] going back there fine
[1:26:07] go bother somebody else you know yeah so
[1:26:11] we must have mutual respect for each
[1:26:13] other and the measure of faith that God
[1:26:15] has placed in the other individual we're
[1:26:17] not all the same we don't understand
[1:26:19] things the same you know you notice that
[1:26:23] tomorrow at lunch
[1:26:25] so you know nobody's going to take it
[1:26:27] all I don't like that well that's not
[1:26:29] the case here this is the word you take
[1:26:31] it all that's right so
[1:26:34] um
[1:26:36] you know respective persons and
[1:26:37] arrogance are not fruit of the spirit
[1:26:41] another result of going off without him
[1:26:44] is Gossip oh I wish we could jump over
[1:26:47] this part
[1:26:49] gossip is Idle talk about the Affairs of
[1:26:52] others that has nothing to do with you
[1:26:53] it's none of your business stick with
[1:26:56] your problems
[1:26:58] see when you open a book you know your
[1:27:00] life is an open book you've heard that
[1:27:01] okay so when you have an open book on
[1:27:03] this page my problems on this page not
[1:27:06] my problems
[1:27:07] so when something happens you quickly
[1:27:09] put it on the page it belongs on and
[1:27:11] then you don't have to worry about it
[1:27:13] don't worry about other people's
[1:27:15] problems I got that problem too
[1:27:17] so you might think we're getting off the
[1:27:18] subject but it's like David duplicis A
[1:27:21] friend of brother randoms once said yes
[1:27:22] I get off the highway sometimes because
[1:27:25] all the people I preach to don't all
[1:27:27] live on the highway we go to go up in
[1:27:29] the alleys and find them bring them back
[1:27:31] you see so the spirit of God is always
[1:27:34] out searching for his own
[1:27:37] and so we're addressing gossip and um uh
[1:27:41] brother James over here in the in the
[1:27:43] Bible had a few
[1:27:45] nice things to say about that let's look
[1:27:47] over here in James chapter three
[1:27:50] and
[1:27:52] let's see here it's back here before
[1:27:54] Peter
[1:27:56] James chapter 3 and verse 5. where it
[1:28:00] says
[1:28:02] even so the tongue is a little member
[1:28:06] and boasts great things
[1:28:09] behold how great a matter a little fire
[1:28:12] Candles now I don't know about you but I
[1:28:14] have found people that at 20 years older
[1:28:17] tell me so many stories I said you
[1:28:19] haven't lived long enough to do all that
[1:28:21] yeah I'll just boast all kinds of things
[1:28:23] you know verse six
[1:28:24] and the tongue is a fire and a world of
[1:28:27] iniquity so is the tongue among our
[1:28:29] members that it defileth the whole body
[1:28:32] and setteth on fire the course of Nature
[1:28:35] and is set on fire of Hell sounds pretty
[1:28:38] bad for every kind of beasts and birds
[1:28:40] and serpents and things of the sea is
[1:28:42] tamed and have been tamed by mankind but
[1:28:45] the tongue can no maintain it is unruly
[1:28:49] evil full of deadly poison there with we
[1:28:52] bless God you know on Sunday the father
[1:28:55] and there with we curse men which are
[1:28:58] made after the similitude of God out of
[1:29:00] the same mouth proceedeth blessing and
[1:29:02] cursing my brethren these things ought
[1:29:04] not to be so be careful mind your
[1:29:09] business take care of your children and
[1:29:11] we won't have a problem
[1:29:14] if you can't say something good about
[1:29:16] somebody
[1:29:18] just don't say anything
[1:29:19] your opinion is not work you know it's
[1:29:21] not needed I've been guilty and so the
[1:29:25] prophet says you see the reason he
[1:29:26] couldn't abide you were a lamb but when
[1:29:30] you became a wolf he had to take his
[1:29:32] flight nothing wrong with the dove it's
[1:29:34] you and when you let that Spirit come on
[1:29:36] you oh did I do that brother Brown yes
[1:29:39] when you went to listening to that
[1:29:40] gossip when you listen to that lie when
[1:29:43] you went to saying well I've got a right
[1:29:45] to come back and be a lamb come back and
[1:29:48] be gentle come back and know nothing
[1:29:50] come back and just submit yourself to
[1:29:53] Christ yes Lord
[1:29:54] walk meekly humbly I know that's against
[1:29:57] a lot of people's nature meekly humbly
[1:30:00] but that's the way Christians walk we
[1:30:03] don't join politics because we're not
[1:30:04] into the devil's stuff you know
[1:30:07] live quietly humbly gently and the dove
[1:30:10] will lead you but whenever you get to
[1:30:12] listening to gossip whenever you go to
[1:30:14] getting that temper up whenever you go
[1:30:16] to thinking you have a right to do this
[1:30:18] and that the dove just takes his flight
[1:30:20] then you don't have it anymore now she's
[1:30:22] not too far away she's sitting out there
[1:30:24] on the limb of Peace waiting for your
[1:30:26] nature to be changed
[1:30:29] another place he says now you may have
[1:30:31] tried to get rid of that ill-temper that
[1:30:33] slandering tongue that gossip on the
[1:30:36] telephone you might have tried every
[1:30:38] remedy you know of but you'll just but
[1:30:41] if you'll just let Jesus Christ come
[1:30:42] into you tonight he will operate on your
[1:30:45] faith and give you a faith that will
[1:30:47] climb beyond anything the world can
[1:30:50] produce
[1:30:51] because Faith or Revelation is the
[1:30:53] victory that overcomes the world
[1:30:56] first John 5 4.
[1:30:59] so we've said several times here about
[1:31:01] know nothing
[1:31:02] listen to what the prophet says about
[1:31:03] that he says oh you think I know a whole
[1:31:07] lot yeah you get your brain all worked
[1:31:09] up and it can't even work itself
[1:31:12] yeah
[1:31:13] in the computer world that's when it
[1:31:15] crashes you know because you put too
[1:31:16] much stuff in
[1:31:18] you know all the books you know the
[1:31:19] answers you know the Greek the Hebrew
[1:31:21] you got no place for the dove to roost
[1:31:24] but you know it all then the dove can't
[1:31:26] lead because you know too much the lamb
[1:31:28] don't claim to know anything it's got to
[1:31:30] have somebody else to lead it that's it
[1:31:33] don't know nothing
[1:31:35] I know we don't usually have a double
[1:31:37] negative in the sentence but that's why
[1:31:39] you talk
[1:31:40] only thing I know is Christ Jesus died
[1:31:43] to save me
[1:31:44] see that's God and simplicity that comes
[1:31:46] back to the very core so we're not
[1:31:49] supporting ignorance we're just teaching
[1:31:52] submission to the Holy Ghost
[1:31:54] you can know all kinds of things how to
[1:31:55] run your job how to operate the computer
[1:31:57] and all these things but submit yourself
[1:32:00] to Christ received
[1:32:02] so would God be uh welcome in all our
[1:32:05] conversations
[1:32:07] let's see brother Brown preached a
[1:32:09] message three kinds of Believers he
[1:32:11] could have had yellow and blue and white
[1:32:14] hats up here and give orders of the
[1:32:16] deacons to put hats on certain people
[1:32:17] then we'd all know who the three kinds
[1:32:18] of Believers are
[1:32:20] that's not what he did he preached the
[1:32:22] sermon painted the big picture okay now
[1:32:24] you decide which one you are and when
[1:32:27] you get over here eating pie
[1:32:29] coffee tonight and criticizing they
[1:32:32] won't know which one you are
[1:32:33] but God already knows so be careful
[1:32:37] okay
[1:32:38] so moving along we're almost done here
[1:32:41] um would God be you know welcome at our
[1:32:43] conversations are you honest are you
[1:32:45] sincere
[1:32:46] brother Brown says I don't want to be
[1:32:47] famous I want to be honest
[1:32:50] oh we look over that one we made him
[1:32:53] famous oh yeah around the world well
[1:32:55] yeah we're just sharing the message but
[1:32:57] we're not into big stuff we just want
[1:33:00] honest people you see
[1:33:02] so the first messenger Saint Paul over
[1:33:05] in Philippians 4 8 rejoice in the lord
[1:33:08] always and again I say rejoice and
[1:33:10] finally brother whatever things are true
[1:33:12] whatever things are honest whatever
[1:33:13] things are just whatever things are pure
[1:33:15] whatever things are lovely whatever
[1:33:17] things are a good report if they're be
[1:33:20] any virtue
[1:33:21] and if there be any praise think on
[1:33:23] these things
[1:33:25] remember we're resting on that amen did
[1:33:27] he preach what Paul preached
[1:33:30] so
[1:33:32] that's another qualifier for our words
[1:33:34] and our experiences so don't waste your
[1:33:37] time on things that don't fit these
[1:33:38] categories right here the rest of it's
[1:33:40] not important you see
[1:33:43] if we can't say amen and follow the
[1:33:45] Scriptures it reflects badly on our
[1:33:48] experience you see
[1:33:50] but your actions speak louder than your
[1:33:52] words because your life is the only
[1:33:55] Bible that some people are going to read
[1:33:56] that's right they're watching you they
[1:33:59] know where you go to church you've made
[1:34:01] you know a little something about profit
[1:34:02] they're watching it's the only Bible
[1:34:04] they will read so repeating gossip is
[1:34:07] like feeding garbage to your family at
[1:34:09] the evening meal
[1:34:11] oh I never do that well listening to
[1:34:14] gossip makes your head a garbage can
[1:34:17] that stuff's going in eventually it's
[1:34:20] got to come out you know
[1:34:22] so stay away from Gossip if you can't
[1:34:24] say something nice about a person don't
[1:34:27] say anything at all
[1:34:29] keep your thoughts clean and guess what
[1:34:32] silence cannot be misquoted
[1:34:36] put that on your dashboard yeah
[1:34:39] so these are just a couple of the
[1:34:41] effects of going off without him
[1:34:44] we venture off into make-believe land
[1:34:46] presuming but we're on our own when
[1:34:49] you're all when you're off on a tangent
[1:34:51] without Christ you're on your own
[1:34:52] there's no backup you see
[1:34:54] and so come back to the Highway of
[1:34:57] Holiness if you remember back in the New
[1:34:59] Testament Mary and Joseph lived in
[1:35:02] Nazareth and they've gone down to
[1:35:04] Jerusalem they went down there once a
[1:35:05] year for the feast and everything and
[1:35:07] they went went down one time when she's
[1:35:09] about 12 they could have been down there
[1:35:10] for his bar mitzvah because he was
[1:35:12] raised Jewish that was the only religion
[1:35:14] there was at the time
[1:35:15] so anyway they're down there with all
[1:35:17] the family
[1:35:19] and they get ready and they're going
[1:35:20] home 60 miles away and they come to the
[1:35:23] evening of the first day and Mary says
[1:35:27] uh Joseph
[1:35:29] where's the boy
[1:35:30] well I don't know I thought it was your
[1:35:32] day to watch him
[1:35:33] and they went off without him they had
[1:35:36] left the promise of God back there you
[1:35:39] know and of course the interesting thing
[1:35:41] is that when they finally got back there
[1:35:43] and found him
[1:35:44] they didn't say like a normal mother
[1:35:47] especially a Jewish mother oh honey have
[1:35:49] you had anything to eat can I get you
[1:35:51] something and did you get some rest no
[1:35:53] her first thing according to scripture
[1:35:55] he made me look bad poor me what about
[1:35:58] the child
[1:36:00] it's right there
[1:36:02] so anyway
[1:36:04] the thing is they had started without
[1:36:06] him they had to go back and start over
[1:36:07] so God has not called us to build fences
[1:36:10] okay
[1:36:11] only fences of love to keep the bugs
[1:36:13] keep Satan out and they won't be welcome
[1:36:16] but God has called us to be worshipers
[1:36:19] not gossipers okay and I know you you
[1:36:22] might be bored but I'm just giving you
[1:36:24] some truth here that God can can do
[1:36:26] something and you'll remember what we
[1:36:28] said
[1:36:29] gossipers have a lot of free time
[1:36:31] you know have you read your Bible cover
[1:36:33] to cover
[1:36:36] but you know on your phone there's a
[1:36:38] schedule if you start tonight and read
[1:36:41] certain by you know certain chapters by
[1:36:43] this time next year you read the whole
[1:36:45] Bible it only took a few minutes each
[1:36:47] day
[1:36:48] so if you have free time that's what you
[1:36:50] do
[1:36:51] um
[1:36:52] have you prayed for the needs of the
[1:36:54] church and we come here and here's the
[1:36:56] prayer request somebody prays you go out
[1:36:57] and you forget it you talk about the car
[1:36:59] and the Nascar or whatever but have you
[1:37:02] prayed for the needs does the pastor
[1:37:04] need any help with anything
[1:37:07] yes he's got a job
[1:37:09] but he might need some help you know
[1:37:11] vacuuming or something
[1:37:13] you might volunteer piano needs dusting
[1:37:16] all kinds of things
[1:37:17] so if he has some needs but see God has
[1:37:21] called us to adoption sons and daughters
[1:37:23] that he can be proud of that's my son
[1:37:25] that's my daughter yeah
[1:37:28] prophecies the church was not
[1:37:30] to be raised on intellectuals but it was
[1:37:33] be tutored not by denomination but it'd
[1:37:35] be tutored by the Holy Ghost that's
[1:37:37] God's tutor so Holy Ghost will tutors
[1:37:41] children by this book
[1:37:43] we have a choice every day it's either
[1:37:45] scripture or it's heresy
[1:37:48] and I'm here to tell you what William
[1:37:51] random preached is scripture it's
[1:37:53] bible-based it wasn't his ideas didn't
[1:37:55] find out a Time Magazine he preached the
[1:37:58] truth so yeah scripture you have a
[1:38:00] choice of scripture or heresy you see
[1:38:03] and the church will be raised by the
[1:38:05] word and the Holy Spirit will teach the
[1:38:07] word not the catechism not the rules of
[1:38:10] the church but the power of the Living
[1:38:12] God Amen man shall not live by bread
[1:38:13] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:38:16] out of the mouth of God and if we want
[1:38:20] to say what he said okay over 200 places
[1:38:22] brother M says back to the word amen so
[1:38:25] it's not a suggestion you do it okay so
[1:38:29] Christians on the side roads are off on
[1:38:31] Tantrums without Jesus Christ but the
[1:38:34] word goes on a rescue mission bring them
[1:38:36] back
[1:38:38] we draw the circle a little a little
[1:38:39] bigger
[1:38:40] but then there's a limit my spirit will
[1:38:43] not always strive with man
[1:38:45] you want to keep jumping out fine you're
[1:38:47] on your own
[1:38:48] so
[1:38:50] um and the word looks everywhere goes
[1:38:52] over every Rock everywhere and like the
[1:38:55] mother Eagle she kept looking till she
[1:38:57] found him you know so when we're away
[1:39:00] from Christ we build fences and um we
[1:39:03] got to tear down those fences
[1:39:06] nobody else billed and we did we got to
[1:39:07] tear them down and when we're away from
[1:39:10] Christ gossip comes easy the tongue is
[1:39:12] untameable and that's where our problems
[1:39:15] began so those are our
[1:39:18] rough words for tonight and I hope that
[1:39:21] you got something
[1:39:23] yeah I'm not Paul I Don't Preach like
[1:39:25] Paul
[1:39:26] I don't run all over the place like
[1:39:27] these other guys we just give you the
[1:39:29] word amen and so
[1:39:32] some reason he keeps calling me back so
[1:39:34] may God bless you it's good to be here
[1:39:36] and Lord teres will be back tomorrow
[1:39:39] with something else
[1:39:41] for the poem
[1:39:43] amen
[1:39:51] God bless you brother George
[1:39:55] oh good to be in the house of the Lord
[1:39:58] tonight amen you know
[1:40:01] um
[1:40:02] it's just
[1:40:05] I kind of liken this if I could just put
[1:40:07] it this way
[1:40:09] I like to go out and eat brother George
[1:40:11] and I had the privilege of going out
[1:40:13] eating together
[1:40:16] um when he arrived on Friday
[1:40:18] and it was really good food
[1:40:21] but there's nothing like home
[1:40:24] there's nothing like eating
[1:40:26] at home and I you know I just really
[1:40:29] enjoyed that tonight the very Simplicity
[1:40:31] of it just reminding us just speaking to
[1:40:34] us and you know it is one of those
[1:40:37] things that you know it just reminds you
[1:40:39] you know let's just be a little
[1:40:41] transparent tonight I think every one of
[1:40:44] us need a little reminder not to talk
[1:40:46] about others amen we need a little
[1:40:48] reminder that if it's not really our
[1:40:51] business then we shouldn't make it our
[1:40:53] business and you know I don't think it
[1:40:55] hurts us to admit that sometimes we say
[1:40:58] things that we should have kept to
[1:41:01] ourself or not even thought about amen
[1:41:03] the scripture says you know of the
[1:41:06] things that God does not like he doesn't
[1:41:07] even like that evil imaginations where
[1:41:11] people taken reach out and fabricate
[1:41:13] something and Lord help us amen I just
[1:41:16] want to take what I heard tonight and I
[1:41:19] just want to apply it to my life and I
[1:41:21] want to be able to walk out of here and
[1:41:23] say it was good to be in the house of
[1:41:26] the Lord I want to invite brother Alex

[1:41:31] would just like to have us maybe sing
