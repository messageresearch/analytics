[32:28] thankful for revelation but the
[32:29] revelation will be digested amen then it

[32:56] you really Chris I'm glad we have one
[32:59] place of worship one place where he

[33:03] not worshiping Christ unless you're in
[33:05] that place you've got to be in that
[33:07] place and that's by God's grace through
[33:09] faith he brings us into that place so
[33:12] thankful that he ordained that to the
[33:13] elect there's nothing we can do we can
[33:15] boast of nothing as humans we have no
[33:18] ability we have nothing we can do to
[33:20] serve the Lord nor service people
[33:21] outside of Christ in you amen so we're
[33:25] thankful for this amen I want to read a
[33:27] couple things here before thank you the
[33:29] musicians god bless you I wonder you a
[33:32] couple things here and I won't try to be
[33:33] long this morning just I want to start
[33:35] kind of a if it's the lord's will Sal
[33:37] ittle bit of a series I'll give you my
[33:39] title but I'm not gonna give you my
[33:40] subject yet but I want to title this
[33:43] here we stand I started the title it
[33:45] here I stand but it is I stand if you
[33:48] can take it and it is an individual
[33:50] affair so you just apply it to yourself
[33:52] that here we the broad eov Christ the
[33:54] bride who is Christ who has not divided
[33:57] but one under the blood we are one under
[34:00] the token we have the same life we have
[34:03] the same position I say position in
[34:05] Christ but different positions in that
[34:08] body
[34:09] amen so we know that God is among us we
[34:12] know that Christ is among us
[34:13] so I title this here we stand that's
[34:15] maybe part one I have several parts to
[34:19] that I'd like to take but but so we will
[34:22] just give you my subject here in just a
[34:25] moment but in the message ashamed
[34:29] brother Branham says he starts at
[34:31] paragraph 235 if you want to look at it
[34:34] you can look at that but in the message
[34:37] that shamed he said he started to sing
[34:40] that song you know where he leads me
[34:42] I'll follow and he starts to sing that
[34:45] portion where he said I'll go with him
[34:47] through the judgement and and the
[34:50] Prophet said as he said that he says in
[34:53] the I'll go with him through the
[34:55] judgment he says now he said that's
[34:58] what's going on right now he says now
[35:02] that's what's going on right now he is
[35:05] judging us now this isn't the white
[35:10] throne judgment although he justice from
[35:12] the throne hallelujah but this isn't the
[35:15] white throne and we know that the bride
[35:18] will won't be stood standing at the
[35:20] white throne being judged
[35:21] she has no judgment at the white throne
[35:23] judgment she is in the throne judging
[35:25] she's a part of the throne she's in God
[35:27] he's in Christ she's now been in fact
[35:30] st. John 5:24 said we've already been
[35:33] judged in him there is no condemnation
[35:36] to them that are in Christ Jesus amen
[35:38] Romans 8:1 so and then st. John 5:24 we
[35:42] can you know what I'm referring to there
[35:44] and Ephesians already one one said were
[35:47] already accepted in the beloved that
[35:51] that's he elected were already accepted
[35:53] chosen in him before the foundation of
[35:55] the world
[35:56] who's going to confirm that how do you
[35:57] know that is confirmed by the token is
[35:59] confirmed by the Holy Ghost the person
[36:02] of Christ in you not being necessary the
[36:06] anointing we have to have the anointing
[36:07] the anointing has to fall upon that seed
[36:09] but that brings forth a person because
[36:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way
[36:14] for the Holy Ghost himself to come right
[36:16] down and perfection again back to the
[36:18] word amen the word itself so so the life
[36:22] in you will man
[36:23] fess the promise word for the season and
[36:25] the hour and the time you're gonna have
[36:28] an ear you do have an ear to receive
[36:30] that word to hear that word amen so we
[36:33] thank God for the mercy that he's given
[36:35] us amen
[36:36] so then in the message in the message
[36:40] invisible Union now I have you probably
[36:42] saw me I don't you saw me it doesn't
[36:43] really matter if you did or not but I
[36:45] have several books with me that's
[36:46] because my printer is dead and and then
[36:50] I'm going back to the old school brother

[39:16] the book all right so he says it's
[39:18] already read you can't add one word to
[39:20] it or take one word from it and dare
[39:22] anyone to do it better not all right
[39:25] don't add your thinking no and add your
[39:27] intellectual thinking don't try to
[39:28] figure things out just open up to God
[39:30] let him God reveal it to you as you have
[39:32] need of it that's what he said he would
[39:34] do not leaving his bride without
[39:36] revelation he said you'd the just shall
[39:38] live by faith and faith is a revelation
[39:41] he said it's already in there it's just
[39:43] got thoughts what he said it's already
[39:45] in there hid it's just got to be
[39:47] revealed in the last day amen all right

[40:41] sailed this I'll save time here let me
[40:43] just get we're entering the rapture age
[40:44] he said it's got to get worse

[40:50] for a church can't go like this he said
[40:52] all right he said it's got to be
[40:54] something and it's moving right now
[40:55] friend not it will it is it's moving
[40:59] right now friend it's on the move is on
[41:02] for the any bride here it moves on for
[41:09] the bride all right
[41:11] not another how many believe this and
[41:14] we're entering into another age not
[41:15] another not us not an eighth Church age
[41:17] another age he's called that the
[41:20] dispensational change
[41:21] it's a bride age Amen all right he's
[41:27] what they do he's come forth to do
[41:29] something this a child ate the the
[41:35] Seventh Seal opened for nothing he's
[41:37] doing something and it's happening and
[41:40] it's being revealed and the end of the
[41:43] move is on for the bride that's the
[41:46] truth he said that's thus saith the Lord
[41:48] move up now you consecrated Christians
[41:51] and want your record to find out your
[41:54] record move up now all right all right
[41:57] we'll just set that aside for a few
[41:59] moments all right now in the message
[42:02] that I know I'm getting to my scripture
[42:05] just hold on and the message serves is
[42:06] this the time I'm laying this foundation
[42:08] for you here serves is this the time he
[42:11] said now no I'll read my scripture first
[42:17] pardon me okay I want you to turn me to
[42:20] revelations chapter 1 and then
[42:23] revelations 10 those only two things if
[42:25] you'll stand with me and then I've got
[42:28] some other scriptures Lord willing to
[42:30] pass on amen and I appreciated the
[42:32] message Wednesday night brother Chris I
[42:34] mean that wasn't really Chris that was
[42:36] the Lord amen
[42:38] I believe that with all my heart God has
[42:40] by mercy by grace bridged a chasm that
[42:45] we couldn't get across is that right and
[42:48] he's asked you to walk it and the move
[42:50] is on for the bride all right so he's
[42:54] did that already
[42:55] our kinsman paid the price took the
[42:57] penalty of sin took it in his body
[42:58] redeemed his bride
[43:01] then he brought out a great thing which
[43:03] I want to bring out this morning there
[43:05] had to be a final stage of redemption
[43:07] there had to be a finished redemption
[43:09] and that was the claiming of the book
[43:11] what was in the book amen
[43:14] so let me just say to you revelation
[43:16] 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice for the
[43:18] marriage of the lamb has come amen
[43:22] all right now so we just will have to go
[43:25] to Revelation chapter 1 let's just start
[43:28] with verse 10 quite a bit of reading
[43:29] here but I was in the spirit and brother
[43:32] Paul has been speaking of this I'm it
[43:34] was in the spirit in the spirit are we
[43:37] in the spirit brother brought the
[43:40] scripture said he that has joined into
[43:41] the unto the joined unto the Lord is one
[43:44] spirit amen that's right that's right
[43:49] it's one thing to have that but to be in
[43:52] it's another thing
[43:56] amen we're talking with the little
[43:58] spirit we're talking about something in
[43:59] the soul you didn't put there it's
[44:02] quickened I was in the spirit John
[44:04] speaking type of the bride I was in the
[44:06] spirit on the Lord's Day and we've had
[44:10] that we've had absolutely a sign in the
[44:12] heavens announcing this dispensational
[44:15] change here alright I was in the spirit
[44:18] on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a
[44:20] great voice as of a trumpet not trumpets
[44:24] trumpet saying I was alpha I am Alpha
[44:27] and Omega the first and last you know
[44:30] the Prophet said a masterpiece they said
[44:31] she the bride is also Alpha and Omega
[44:33] why because she was in him before the
[44:36] foundation of the world to be manifested
[44:39] in her age this is the time bride moves
[44:43] on I may know we're entering the bride
[44:46] this is bride age he said the rapture
[44:48] age is the bride age all right so he
[44:51] said I often Omega the first to last
[44:53] what they'll see us write in a book a
[44:55] record and send it unto the seven
[44:57] churches which are in Asia and Ephesus
[44:59] Smyrna Pergamum and unto Thyatira Sardis
[45:02] unto Philadelphia and unto Laodicea now
[45:05] remember this book right here the book
[45:07] of Revelation were taught is the
[45:08] complete revelation of Jesus Christ the
[45:13] whole Bible is a complete revelation
[45:14] but this book here completes the
[45:16] revelation without the written the
[45:18] writing of this book there'd be no
[45:20] completion without the revealing of this
[45:22] book there's no completion so it's the
[45:25] revelation of Jesus Christ
[45:28] all right now he said and I didn't say
[45:31] that brother Branham said it was a
[45:32] complete revelation of Jesus Christ and
[45:36] I turned to see the boys here was the
[45:38] sound of a device the sound of a trumpet
[45:40] and I turned to see it you mean you
[45:44] could see a voice the bride can and I
[45:48] turned to see the voice to speak with me
[45:49] and being turned I saw seven golden
[45:51] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[45:54] seven candlesticks one like unto the Son
[45:56] of Man clothed with a garment down to
[45:58] the foot and a Girt about the paps like
[46:01] a like a woman with a girdle a golden
[46:04] girdle that also is a type of Judge all
[46:07] right he said and and he said and his
[46:13] hips Kuzmin out and his gird golden girl
[46:17] his head and his hairs were white like
[46:20] snow and we know what that means
[46:24] judges down to white wig when they with
[46:28] the judgment and his hairs were white so
[46:30] I said in some other age we're living
[46:32] here in this hour he said his head and
[46:35] his hairs were white like wool white as
[46:37] snow his eyes were as a flame of fire
[46:39] and his feet like unto fine brass that
[46:41] burned in the furnace and his voice was
[46:43] as a sound of many waters brother Brown
[46:47] prayed that there would be thousands of
[46:48] lived voices thundering out the voice of
[46:55] God amen and there is and he had NC and
[47:00] he had in his right hand seven stars and
[47:02] out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[47:05] sword amen brother Brown said like out
[47:09] of God's mouth to Moses mouth amen he
[47:15] said and we know that the that says the
[47:17] Kings sword fit the hand of the prophet
[47:19] he said it fit my hand perfectly a sharp
[47:21] two-edged sword this countenance was
[47:23] like at the Sun the Sun you know
[47:25] revelations a book of symbols we have
[47:27] the Sun
[47:28] shining in its strength what was shining
[47:31] in his strength his face his countenance
[47:34] amen
[47:35] all right and said and his right any
[47:38] late and when I saw him Oh hallelujah
[47:41] hallelujah wonder how many have seen him
[47:44] brother Branham says our Lord up there
[47:46] and quickening power lets us see his
[47:48] coming he said he said I'd when I seen
[47:51] him I fell at his feet as dead good
[47:56] place to start
[47:57] it's the only place to start Jesus had
[47:59] to start there before he went to Calvary
[48:01] he started it in Gethsemane and there
[48:04] that was appointed unto me I was in him
[48:07] then I died right there
[48:12] hallelujah too old man why because I
[48:15] died to him today I couldn't have done
[48:17] that unless I was in him dying right
[48:18] then those counted to leave I to pay
[48:21] tithes in Abraham it's accounted to you
[48:23] and I to have died in Gethsemane I was
[48:27] identified right there what would I do
[48:30] if I come down here in this day I'd have
[48:31] to fulfill in manifestation what was
[48:33] done then I would die out complete
[48:35] itself so when I saw him I laid on the I
[48:38] laid John said when I saw him I fell at
[48:41] his feet is dead
[48:42] and he laid his right hand upon me
[48:47] saying unto me fear not Oh hallelujah
[48:48] fear not I am the first and the last I
[48:55] am he that liveth and was dead and
[48:57] behold I am Alive for evermore amen and
[49:01] have the keys of hell and of death and I
[49:04] went with him I died I was pierced with
[49:07] him I went with him I went with him to
[49:09] hell and my sin was put on the head of
[49:11] that devil and right there I conquered
[49:13] that death hell in the grave and took it
[49:16] off the side right there and raised up
[49:18] victorious and how do I know I have the
[49:20] very life of that blood living in me now
[49:22] showing like resurrected when he
[49:24] resurrected showing that I have a body
[49:27] waiting and I don't care where this body
[49:29] goes
[49:30] I've already dead to this old man and no
[49:32] matter what happens to this I will rise
[49:34] again hallelujah Amen all right so he
[49:40] said he said so I
[49:42] the keys of hell and death now at
[49:43] revelation 10 I know it's a lot of
[49:45] reading but you'll understand
[49:47] revelations 10 verse 1 and I saw another
[49:56] mighty angel come down from heaven
[49:59] clothed with a cloud here we find him in
[50:02] Revelations one here is revelations 10
[50:05] clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was
[50:08] upon his head and his face as it were
[50:11] the Sun I wonder if it could be the S Oh
[50:14] N I wonder if revelations 1 if that
[50:18] wasn't his countenance was as the Sun
[50:19] som all right he said sun shining in his
[50:23] strength
[50:24] we don't have strength is his strength
[50:26] all right so he said his face is aware
[50:29] the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire
[50:31] and he had in his hand glory you ever
[50:37] get the revelation of who you are and he
[50:39] had in his hand a little book open not
[50:44] closed open romance said it was closing
[50:46] in the fifth chapter open in the 10th
[50:49] all right he said any and he had in his
[50:53] little in his hand a little book a
[50:54] little book open and I wonder well we'll
[51:01] see what he said and he set his right
[51:02] foot upon the sea his left foot on the
[51:04] earth and crowd with a loud voice as
[51:06] when a lion roared a brother Ram said
[51:08] when the lion roars everything shuts up
[51:12] heaven was silenced is that right but
[51:17] brother Ram said those seven thunders
[51:18] didn't utter from heaven they under the
[51:20] earth Amen all right all right and he
[51:26] said and he added with a loud voice as
[51:28] when a lion roars Amen ewa beetles
[51:33] stopped everything the giraffe quit
[51:35] winning and all this you know everything
[51:37] shuts up he said I ought to because the
[51:40] lion spoke all right he said now he said
[51:44] other and he the lion roar and when he
[51:46] had cried seven thunders brother Ram
[51:50] said those seven thunders uttered their
[51:52] voices with this revelation contained in
[51:54] those seals
[51:55] is that right and it would absolutely
[51:58] turn the heart of the bride to the
[51:59] original faith it literally he said turn
[52:02] the heart of the bride to the faith that
[52:04] revelation so something in this that
[52:09] pertains to you and I and it couldn't be
[52:11] opened unless he thundered or he roared
[52:13] one thunder prophet said and seven
[52:16] messages and then you question it about
[52:19] the seventh seal being opened allelujah
[52:24] are with me I don't want to lose you
[52:26] here all right he said he said now he
[52:30] said and what is the seventh it's him
[52:33] it's him he brings us to himself we
[52:38] don't come on her own he comes to
[52:41] receive us we don't come on her own amen
[52:44] something's happening and the Prophet
[52:46] said the seven seals the mystery of his
[52:48] coming and the Prophet said the moves on
[52:52] for the bride so what's happening he saw
[52:57] her marching he saw her in step with the
[52:59] word and every step got a little higher
[53:01] just like inna who it's who is Enoch
[53:04] walking with she was the seventh from
[53:07] Adam who's the bride walking with then
[53:10] we'll have to take rapture because this
[53:12] is the rapture age and the raptures are
[53:14] to begun in US and if he begun in you he
[53:16] that has begun a good work will finish
[53:18] it so there you go and the rapture is
[53:21] begun it's already opened up if you're
[53:24] sealed in Christ and win at that little
[53:26] room you've already done raptured you
[53:28] just Scout your body's got to catch up
[53:30] with it and it'll take the revelation on
[53:32] top of Revelation faith on top of faith
[53:34] word on top of word to bring you there
[53:38] because this message that promised said
[53:40] it's for the going home of the bride
[53:42] it's not for another person it's for the
[53:44] going home of the bride because the
[53:49] bride is that person they are the same
[53:51] self person so what is the bride here in
[53:54] her in her manifesting her glory which
[53:57] is his glory what's she doing she's
[53:58] revealing the son of man again it's not
[54:01] here he her
[54:02] it's here ye him
[54:04] right hallelujah all right you may be
[54:07] seated
[54:08] sorry I get to preach and I love you
[54:10] Sandin but that's all right you can
[54:12] stand you want to stand listen to the
[54:15] word sand all right in the message
[54:17] services this a time now if I don't
[54:20] preach the way you like it then you just
[54:22] you just listen for a while and give me
[54:24] grace all right
[54:29] all right now we're gonna see something
[54:32] in this services it's the time I want to
[54:34] make this mention now there's only one
[54:37] thing left that's the seven thunders
[54:39] that we don't know and it would have not
[54:41] thundered in vain God don't do something
[54:46] just to be playing we play an act silly
[54:49] but not God everything with God is J&A
[54:52] it
[54:52] he doesn't just fool he doesn't kid he
[54:56] means what he says and he says nothing
[54:58] unless there's something meaning to it
[55:00] the seven thunders now notice he said
[55:02] and seven thunders right in the
[55:05] revelation here of Jesus Christ is some
[55:08] mystery the seven thunders here right in
[55:12] the revelation of Jesus Christ he's
[55:15] referring to this right here this book
[55:16] of revelations because it's the
[55:18] revelation of Jesus Christ given to his
[55:21] servant John to write is that right
[55:24] okay he said there's something he said
[55:27] he said there's this he said let me read
[55:31] it again and seven thunders right in the
[55:33] revelation here of Jesus Christ as some
[55:36] mystery does not the Bible say this is
[55:39] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[55:41] well there is some hidden mystery then
[55:43] of it some hidden mystery of what the
[55:48] revelation of Jesus Christ
[55:50] remember the Prophet said he's not
[55:53] complete without you not Co MP le te
[56:00] complete without you now Jesus when he
[56:08] come to this earth was the fullness of
[56:10] the Godhead bodily in one man is that
[56:12] right then you and I were in him then if
[56:14] we're bride we are in him then
[56:17] are you with me
[56:19] but that portion had there was still a
[56:22] mystery just like Eve was an atom a
[56:26] mystery until revealed a man she was a
[56:32] hidden mystery in the revelation of Adam
[56:35] she was a midden mystery of that
[56:37] revelation and Adam was not completely
[56:41] manifested until that time that she was
[56:48] revealed that was the capping of the
[56:53] creation and where did it happen not
[56:57] under the sixth day it happened under
[57:00] the seventh day that right there she was
[57:05] revealing Adam the full complete
[57:08] revelation of Adam it was a hidden
[57:10] mystery and Adam there's something
[57:14] hidden in this revelation of Jesus
[57:16] Christ that he said a hidden mystery of
[57:19] it what is it the seven thunders have it
[57:23] hallelujah the seven thunders have it
[57:27] something the seven thunders uttered was
[57:30] uttered and John heard it and he
[57:32] understood what it said and he was going
[57:34] to write about it but the word said seal
[57:37] up those things which the seven thunders
[57:39] uttered and write them not but in the
[57:41] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[57:44] that mystery would be finished then
[57:47] there's a hidden mystery of that
[57:49] revelation and here we are and the
[57:54] Prophet said Christ revealed in you
[57:58] makes you the complete revelation of the
[58:02] whole thing and if it's complete then
[58:07] what's to follow a body change glory to
[58:11] God that's what takes us there without
[58:14] that brother Brown said but at John wept
[58:17] because if he hadn't have taken that
[58:19] book
[58:20] if he hadn't revealed those names if he
[58:23] hadn't have showed what he redeemed and
[58:26] claimed what he redeemed there's no
[58:28] marriage
[58:30] there's no wedding supper there's that
[58:32] the whole creations lost he had to take
[58:34] that book because he already our kinsman
[58:37] redeemed it are you with me he redeemed
[58:41] it he paid the penalty for it he went to
[58:43] Calvary for it
[58:44] he bridge the chasm for you and I and
[58:46] it's through the blood but unless you
[58:48] come through the blood and if you've
[58:49] come to the blood you're in the spirit
[58:51] if you come to the blood you're in
[58:53] Christ and if you come to the blood
[58:55] you've identified to be his seed you are
[58:57] identified to be his germ of life you
[58:59] are identified to be his own you're
[59:04] identified you're identified by that
[59:06] confirmation you're identified by Christ
[59:08] himself
[59:11] now Abraham's say well Abraham believe
[59:13] by faith yes but he had to have a
[59:14] confirmation of his faith and the token
[59:17] is that confirmation brother Branham
[59:19] said God expects us to display the token
[59:22] God expects us he said when you must
[59:25] have the token on display God's
[59:27] requirement is the token and the token
[59:32] and you identifies that you and Christ
[59:34] are one it's not like me and my wife I
[59:39] could be in one room see me in another
[59:41] you say you're one with your wife I see
[59:43] you but I'll see my wife but that's not
[59:44] so with Jesus Christ and his bride if
[59:47] you see her you see your husband if you
[59:49] see the husband you're gonna see the
[59:51] bride today hallelujah praise the Lord I
[59:56] get a little excited forgive me but this
[59:58] is something excited about those seven
[1:00:00] thunders hold that mystery something a
[1:00:04] hidden mystery in the revelation of
[1:00:06] Jesus Christ was kept secret sealed up
[1:00:09] concealed until this hour when is
[1:00:13] something sealed is kept silent
[1:00:16] that's what revelations 8:1 denoted what
[1:00:20] was coming forth and revelation was that
[1:00:22] mystery no wonder the devil so I I add
[1:00:28] now I'm gonna say it
[1:00:29] no wonder is because it's the spirit
[1:00:31] we're not dealing with people no wonder
[1:00:32] the devil hates that revelation of the
[1:00:34] seventh seal because it cats the bride
[1:00:37] off hallelujah without that we're be no
[1:00:40] rapture
[1:00:42] because he had it himself he had to take
[1:00:45] the book himself he had to lay claim to
[1:00:48] what he redeemed himself glory to God
[1:00:52] this is some old man's ideas this is
[1:00:56] what separates the bride from the rest
[1:00:57] this is what separates the bride from
[1:00:59] foolish virgin they're all good people
[1:01:01] we're not talking about good people
[1:01:03] we're talking about revelation of the
[1:01:05] word which is the evidence that you're
[1:01:07] in there and if you have a true
[1:01:10] revelation it's going to be vindicated
[1:01:11] by this word the thing that God will say
[1:01:14] seed will never do is deny this or
[1:01:17] unbeliev this word but they will see the
[1:01:20] word foolish virgin had enough oil to
[1:01:25] make sanctification but they didn't have
[1:01:28] enough oil to go in the rapture they
[1:01:30] didn't have any oil to go in the rapture
[1:01:33] they missed the wedding they missed the
[1:01:36] marriage the brides gone into the
[1:01:38] marriage and here she is and the foolish
[1:01:41] virgins still wondered whether it's
[1:01:42] opened or not we're in an invisible
[1:01:48] union people and there's a you there's a
[1:01:50] there's a maturing under that Union
[1:01:53] because this arising of the Sun it's
[1:01:55] delaying in the presence of the Sun it's
[1:01:58] a marriage and that marriage brings
[1:02:01] conception the purpose of that union was
[1:02:04] conception and the conception is the
[1:02:07] original life the original seed the
[1:02:09] original life is what the bride bearing
[1:02:11] she's revealing Christ to the people
[1:02:14] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:16] and that wasn't a public show that's not
[1:02:18] known to the public that's inside of a
[1:02:21] little room but it's declared outwardly
[1:02:25] by a lived life for the aged this is not
[1:02:30] the Pentecostal message that's good we
[1:02:33] believe that you had to come through the
[1:02:34] Pentecost
[1:02:35] but brother Branham said this isn't the
[1:02:37] Pentecostal message any cost represented
[1:02:40] that again he said this is for the bride
[1:02:42] this is where they going home of the
[1:02:44] bride how many believe that we've
[1:02:46] entered a raptured age hallelujah seven
[1:02:54] thunders have it for
[1:02:55] John was about to write the voice came
[1:02:57] from heaven said don't write it but seal
[1:02:59] it up but it's got to be revealed glory
[1:03:06] to God hallelujah and that's what the
[1:03:11] union's about it's revealed but God kept
[1:03:15] it a secret why because he would reveal
[1:03:17] it to his children his own and anything
[1:03:21] that come by revelation doesn't
[1:03:22] vindicate this word is not of God it has
[1:03:26] to be line up with the word I don't care
[1:03:29] how anointed you are okay how much you
[1:03:30] can shout how much you can prophesy if
[1:03:33] that thing's off the word it's not of
[1:03:35] God you say that's party powerful
[1:03:41] brother yeah it's powerful but it
[1:03:43] separates the tear from the wheat
[1:03:47] because this this little bride won't
[1:03:49] leave the word she can't leave the word
[1:03:52] she is the word
[1:03:53] she can't be to see because she is the
[1:03:55] word and anything that comes outside of
[1:03:59] that word is not of God I don't care if
[1:04:01] it's 99.99% truth listen the terror and
[1:04:06] the we can both be anointed in their
[1:04:08] spirit the spirit controls the body but
[1:04:11] the soul controls the spirit are you
[1:04:13] with me they can be anointed and that
[1:04:16] insight and that soul can use that
[1:04:17] spirit to cast out devils speak in
[1:04:20] tongues and prophesy are you with me
[1:04:23] beylin prophesy wasn't wrong Balaam's
[1:04:24] teaching was wrong he said we're all one
[1:04:29] we're not all one we're all the same
[1:04:31] people we ought to just come together
[1:04:32] where we're all invited to a feast you
[1:04:34] oughta just all assemble together and
[1:04:36] brother Graham said God hated that and
[1:04:38] he never did forgive Israel for that
[1:04:40] because you're a separated people unto
[1:04:42] Christ himself what separates the word
[1:04:45] the people we're not separating the word
[1:04:48] separates God has bride has one husband
[1:04:52] and that focus her husband is his her
[1:04:55] focus she only has one focus one person
[1:04:59] to please in this hour
[1:05:05] are you with me I'm talking about the
[1:05:06] bride the whole male and female but then
[1:05:09] God wrote in his word that a woman will
[1:05:11] be subject to her husband under
[1:05:13] obedience not a ruler not a knot of like
[1:05:17] a doormat but under the word what for
[1:05:19] all of you husbands that can't rule your
[1:05:20] homes by the word bring it out of the
[1:05:26] word and sweetness bring it of the word
[1:05:27] and love bring it out of the word on
[1:05:29] token bring your house under the word
[1:05:31] and quit bowing to these idols of fear
[1:05:34] afraid of what she's gonna do afraid of
[1:05:37] her actions ah
[1:05:41] I kind of hit a sore point but that's
[1:05:45] the truth
[1:05:47] you bout anything outside of that word
[1:05:50] and come between you and that word as an
[1:05:51] idol and Satan uses fear to get you to
[1:05:54] do it
[1:05:54] boy oh boy if that's isn't his one of
[1:05:58] his greatest tactics if fear but we just
[1:06:03] read here when I saw him I fell at his
[1:06:05] feet is dead I lost sight of myself and
[1:06:07] raced up under his power said fear not
[1:06:09] I'm the first and the last and I'm right
[1:06:11] here right now and I'm gonna take you
[1:06:13] all the way in I'm gonna take you all
[1:06:17] the way to that body change because
[1:06:19] you've got the you've got the reality
[1:06:21] you've got the confirmation you have the
[1:06:23] very assuring since I'd of you right now
[1:06:24] that what I'd begun I will finish what
[1:06:28] are you afraid about I don't know how
[1:06:33] far I won't get very far here this
[1:06:34] morning all right let's go to
[1:06:36] revelations five hey men my subject
[1:06:45] brides judgment my subject is the
[1:06:52] bride's judgment well you say brother
[1:06:55] Davis she doesn't stand B I'm not
[1:06:56] talking about the white throne I'm
[1:06:57] talking about judgment now I want you to
[1:07:02] look into the open book and see how God
[1:07:04] judges the bride because we've had a
[1:07:09] judge come forth that wasn't just some
[1:07:12] make-believe thing as some storing we
[1:07:14] found out in 63 there was the divine
[1:07:17] happening
[1:07:20] and it was identified Amen we'll get
[1:07:23] into that as we go right through here as
[1:07:25] the Lord will help us alright
[1:07:30] revelations five and I saw in the right
[1:07:33] hand of him that sat on the throne a
[1:07:35] book written within and the backside
[1:07:38] sealed with seven seals and I saw a
[1:07:41] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:07:42] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[1:07:45] who to loose loose means to free or set
[1:07:48] free the seals thereof and no man in
[1:07:52] heaven or in earth neither under the
[1:07:54] earth was able to open the book neither
[1:07:56] to look thereon and I went much because
[1:07:59] no man was found worthy to open to read
[1:08:01] the book and neither to look thereon and
[1:08:03] one of the elders which said to me weep
[1:08:05] not behold the Lion of the tribe of
[1:08:07] Judah the root of David he's both root
[1:08:12] and offspring remember are you with me
[1:08:15] alright the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:08:18] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[1:08:21] loose open and loose other words there's
[1:08:24] something behind those seals that have
[1:08:27] to be revealed and in order to do it
[1:08:29] those seals have got to be loosed and
[1:08:32] brother Graham said he is those seals
[1:08:33] then what are the revelation of those
[1:08:35] seals but the revelation of Christ there
[1:08:38] you are
[1:08:39] you talk about the bride being free
[1:08:42] you're talking about brides judgment you
[1:08:45] talk about where we stand
[1:08:48] amen brother Brown said this Christ the
[1:08:51] mystery of God revealed let me just go
[1:08:54] there real quick on paragraph 503 in
[1:08:58] Christ's a mystery I'll just read this
[1:09:03] one a little portion first don't know
[1:09:05] how far we'll get but all this mystery
[1:09:07] is revealed only as he promised to his
[1:09:10] bride hell is against this truth you
[1:09:15] think you you think you have problems
[1:09:16] wait till it gets with you it's a little
[1:09:19] more maturity about it a little more
[1:09:21] open a little more open
[1:09:23] watch the devil raised up against the
[1:09:27] revelation well who do you think you are
[1:09:30] you're some special person yes I
[1:09:32] no I am but I'm special in his sight not
[1:09:38] special as a human special in him it's
[1:09:41] not my working it's his working
[1:09:43] it's his revealing it's the unveiling of
[1:09:45] himself the headstone in me that began
[1:09:48] as a cornerstone that he would build
[1:09:51] this church on but here in the end it's
[1:10:00] a headstone amen are you with me it's a
[1:10:04] stumbling stone to what is the
[1:10:06] revelation the stone the rock because he
[1:10:13] said behold I lay in Zion a cornerstone
[1:10:15] brother Branham was coming out of that
[1:10:17] vision and on the message serves this
[1:10:20] the time member he referred to the
[1:10:21] vision he had of those angels and he
[1:10:24] said I come out of that vision and and
[1:10:25] it kept referring to me look at look it
[1:10:27] and then behold he lay in Zion a chief
[1:10:31] Cornerstone is that right I lay in Zion
[1:10:36] I lay who laid it jesus said to Peter
[1:10:38] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[1:10:40] the gates of hell can't prevail against
[1:10:42] it and the cornerstone becomes the head
[1:10:46] of the corner and it's all the doing of
[1:10:48] the Lord and it's glorious in whose eyes
[1:10:52] amen whose it's our eyes the bride's
[1:10:55] eyes is glorious because now he comes
[1:10:58] forth revealing the head which is the
[1:11:01] same as the corner but I'll build my
[1:11:03] church upon the revelation of myself and
[1:11:06] the gates of hell and Satan makes him so
[1:11:10] mad because the gates of Hell can't
[1:11:12] prevail against it amen so he kept it as
[1:11:18] mystery sealed up and where was a sealed
[1:11:23] in John he said he would lay it there is
[1:11:29] that right he would lay it in his bride
[1:11:32] is that right okay then where was the
[1:11:34] seal where is it sealed today you tell
[1:11:36] me where it's unveiled and I'll tell you
[1:11:38] where it's sealed
[1:11:44] because the seals been broken
[1:11:46] Christ has identified himself in you you
[1:11:50] are identified in him that isn't
[1:11:52] everybody that's to you here I stand
[1:11:58] here we the bride stand in that
[1:12:03] revelation he said it's this mysteries
[1:12:05] only revealed as he promised to his
[1:12:07] bride held us against the truth of the
[1:12:09] revelation of this mystery but the bride
[1:12:11] standing on it that's her stand
[1:12:16] hallelujah
[1:12:18] why do you hunger thirst Church why do
[1:12:20] you thirst it's a father trying to
[1:12:22] reveal this hidden secret to you but you
[1:12:25] let so many things get it out of you you
[1:12:28] let your job you let your wife you let
[1:12:31] your husband you let your children you
[1:12:33] let the cares in the world you let some
[1:12:34] pastor you let somebody else get it out
[1:12:37] of you when you know way down in your
[1:12:39] heart you better thank God that it's way
[1:12:41] down in your heart that you want that
[1:12:45] more than anything it ought to mean more
[1:12:46] and everything to you than houses lands
[1:12:48] money's jobs whatever it may be if
[1:12:51] you're still little down and wrong that
[1:12:54] you just need to die and Paul said I die
[1:12:55] daily we have to die we have to die to
[1:12:58] that we have to die to what people think
[1:13:00] we have to die to ourselves and that's
[1:13:02] the greatest thing you have to overcome
[1:13:04] is yourself and Jesus overcame himself
[1:13:07] father fit me please if you let this cup
[1:13:09] pass but nevertheless not my will but
[1:13:13] thy will be done and there he reconciled
[1:13:17] himself and gave himself over and there
[1:13:19] he died hallelujah my what's that mean
[1:13:27] to you and I I was with him then if
[1:13:33] brother Branham in Van Daan se Jun
[1:13:35] Bailey who God mighty God unveiled and
[1:13:37] all those message could say I was
[1:13:38] identified in Moses and to be a be a be
[1:13:41] a United States citizen I was identified
[1:13:43] with Washington when he went across to
[1:13:46] be a Christian I had to be identified
[1:13:48] I was identified with Enoch I was
[1:13:51] identified with Abel when he offered
[1:13:53] that
[1:13:53] rifice my revelation and God made a
[1:13:55] chain made the difference and he said
[1:13:57] it's Revelation that's the evidence not
[1:14:01] your religion not your feeling
[1:14:03] it's the revelation of the word and that
[1:14:06] expresses itself through flesh and stays
[1:14:09] with the word and will seed and receive
[1:14:12] the word for the season and that's not a
[1:14:16] thing you do about it
[1:14:18] despite yourself God does that why
[1:14:24] because our kinsman redeemer took our
[1:14:26] sin in his body and paid the penalty of
[1:14:30] sin and bridged away from there to
[1:14:32] Calcutta to rapture right into the
[1:14:37] Millennium right into the new city and
[1:14:39] said he'd come in this hour and reveal
[1:14:42] it and cap the whole revelation of
[1:14:44] himself off now we see the promise being
[1:14:49] fulfilled Christ the true headship
[1:14:51] coming in his bride going in her do we
[1:14:59] see it or don't we see it he said you
[1:15:02] see it he said he did he see he's now
[1:15:05] you see the seals when he was in his
[1:15:07] media Tara work back there redeeming
[1:15:09] through the ages but what was the
[1:15:12] message of the hour the seventh seal
[1:15:14] what was the seventh seal to do unveil
[1:15:17] that hidden word amen are you with me
[1:15:21] there had to be a hidden self hidden
[1:15:23] thing hidden in the revelation of
[1:15:25] himself here that had become expressed
[1:15:27] and had to be manifested you see why
[1:15:31] Satan had to hates this message for the
[1:15:33] hour for the time do you realize we're
[1:15:36] recognizing our day and it's message
[1:15:41] what's this we're waiting on us to get
[1:15:44] out of the way so two witnesses can come
[1:15:47] there under that seventh trumpet which
[1:15:51] is the same as the seventh seal and
[1:15:52] unveil to them what they missed and
[1:15:55] bring them right up to date and show
[1:15:57] them there that nation just it's a
[1:16:02] perfect type of Ruth and Naomi
[1:16:06] perfectly brother Chris perfectly here's
[1:16:09] a redeemer made a public that I read
[1:16:13] email me and I read it
[1:16:15] Ruth is my bride through that shoe Don
[1:16:18] among those elders and said it's done
[1:16:20] and you're witnesses and they said let
[1:16:24] his blood be upon us is that right
[1:16:29] but there was a few there about nine
[1:16:32] brother Bram said they caught the
[1:16:33] message 12 besides them see and a few
[1:16:37] other people about 120 that were in the
[1:16:39] upper room but 3,000 hurt them speak the
[1:16:43] truth in a new tongue what they have an
[1:16:50] ear to hear was that the promised word
[1:16:55] for the day who was speaking it war was
[1:17:00] he hid Paul Saul why are you persecuting
[1:17:03] me
[1:17:07] all right what does he do down here
[1:17:09] today the brides the word that's why she
[1:17:14] can't be deceived you say you're just

[1:18:07] misunderstood is it gonna be bring
[1:18:09] persecution you better believe it
[1:18:10] you ought to thank God for that because
[1:18:11] you're able to bear in your own body the
[1:18:14] sufferings every day but you need to die
[1:18:16] daily we need to deny yourself daily you
[1:18:19] need
[1:18:19] to take up your cross and daily you've
[1:18:22] got to keep yourself dead you've got to
[1:18:24] keep yourself off a high horse you've
[1:18:26] just got you have one purpose live the
[1:18:29] promise for the hour a man is that right
[1:18:33] and who's living it yeah well it isn't
[1:18:35] David that's for sure
[1:18:37] David's always arguing against this
[1:18:39] every day against what against the
[1:18:44] revelation he has his opinion but I'm
[1:18:48] taking his opinion because when you're
[1:18:51] dead to yourself then why listen to a
[1:18:53] dead man and you every one of you if
[1:18:57] you're believers in Christ are facing
[1:18:59] that every single day you trying to
[1:19:00] reason you away from the word cast down
[1:19:03] reasoning we don't let reasoning become
[1:19:05] an idol we don't reason with nothing if
[1:19:07] God said if that settles it you believe
[1:19:09] it you take him at his word and you just
[1:19:11] give it a right mental attitude and
[1:19:13] place it like that and God will reveal
[1:19:15] it and right when he does it that's it
[1:19:17] speak the revelation and go forward we
[1:19:22] speak faith and go forward let's speak
[1:19:27] our own thoughts we speak the mind of
[1:19:29] God and go forward amen
[1:19:33] so now take it back to Ruth now Ruth for
[1:19:40] and we'll just see how far we can go
[1:19:43] here I don't have chronic kind of not
[1:19:45] running out yet but we'll be long Ruth
[1:19:50] he did the work of the kinsman he said
[1:19:55] he performed he said formed that he
[1:19:58] performed the part of a kinsman I may
[1:20:01] believe it formed that part you don't
[1:20:04] believe that you got to start at the
[1:20:06] beginning yet you got to believe that
[1:20:08] amen amen is that right but we're
[1:20:12] talking about what the kinsman performed
[1:20:15] it for hallelujah you'd realize that
[1:20:18] that right there at Calvary right there
[1:20:21] the works were finished the work brother
[1:20:23] Bram said the work was finished work of
[1:20:25] what salvation the work of healing there
[1:20:29] it was worked you don't have
[1:20:33] produce something to get anything to
[1:20:34] work just accept it brother Bram said
[1:20:36] concerning healing he said you don't
[1:20:37] even have to pray just believe what God
[1:20:39] did for you
[1:20:40] just give it a right mental attitude by
[1:20:44] the end then the revelation of the word
[1:20:46] in your soul just give it a right place
[1:20:47] a right mental attitude in the spirit
[1:20:50] realm hold that word before you and what
[1:20:55] does it have to be your creation has to
[1:20:57] obey the create or see the battle we get
[1:21:02] so taken up and thinking the battle
[1:21:04] between me and somebody else listen the
[1:21:07] battle between God and Satan not between
[1:21:11] this man that man this woman that woman
[1:21:12] me me me no no that's not it at all if
[1:21:15] we can separate the individual from the
[1:21:18] problem it's not the individual I'm no
[1:21:21] different than anyone else I'm a man but
[1:21:23] that revelation determines the
[1:21:25] difference that revelation of what the
[1:21:29] word for the season amen that's what
[1:21:32] Satan's against but what do we recognize
[1:21:34] it as is that gonna stop us is that
[1:21:37] gonna let us compromise with the word no
[1:21:39] we're gonna keep walking right on walk
[1:21:41] in the truth doesn't matter what well
[1:21:44] this one don't like it and this one
[1:21:45] don't like it and I didn't get praise
[1:21:46] from this one and nobody said thank you
[1:21:48] and you're not dead yet we need to die
[1:21:53] well you may be dead but you need to die
[1:21:55] too that don't give it place because you
[1:22:02] have a word for it
[1:22:03] where's your absolute it's your head
[1:22:06] where's your husband in the little room
[1:22:13] where's your husband manifested inside
[1:22:16] and the inside of the inside you wonder
[1:22:19] why brother Bram said bolt at the inside
[1:22:21] of the inside after those seals open the
[1:22:23] inside of the inside because you can lay
[1:22:29] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:22:30] in your spirit and do the and if you're
[1:22:32] a cocklebur on the inside of the inside
[1:22:34] you'll live a cocklebur life anointed by
[1:22:37] the spirit the true Holy Spirit you'll
[1:22:41] live from that life you say that's not
[1:22:43] right then you haven't gotten the
[1:22:44] message
[1:22:46] because that profit tells it more than
[1:22:49] one place but you watch how that loosen
[1:22:51] was controlled after you say I don't
[1:22:53] believe in dates well does something
[1:22:55] happened in 63 that turned the corner I
[1:22:58] believe everything the Prophet said but
[1:23:01] watch it mature watch what he said
[1:23:03] mature I'll take what he said back here
[1:23:07] I can't take what he says appear watch
[1:23:09] out amen see because watch it mature
[1:23:15] things change because loose ends were
[1:23:17] taken care of loose ends in serpents eat
[1:23:20] loose ends and who's miss Kenzi loose
[1:23:22] ends and marriage and divorce loose and
[1:23:25] internal security brought it to a full
[1:23:29] revelation what for the taking home of
[1:23:35] his bride hey all I just love the Lord
[1:23:39] he just kept that so secret he that I'll
[1:23:42] just I'll I'll show my bride my love
[1:23:44] I'll just keep it away from the world I
[1:23:46] would even make it publicly known I'll
[1:23:48] just come in the time I come she'll know
[1:23:50] it and she'll come in union with me
[1:23:56] that sounds pretty radical it's not
[1:23:58] radical it's a love affair this is not a
[1:24:01] duty affair this isn't preaching the
[1:24:03] word I'm not telling up preaching cuz I
[1:24:04] got duty I'm called yes but I love him
[1:24:08] and I'd love to tell about him
[1:24:12] well you say don't you know that you
[1:24:14] offended the Pharisees Jesus when you
[1:24:16] said those words says let me say some
[1:24:21] more don't you realize you offended the
[1:24:25] seventy when you said let me offend Oh
[1:24:28] are you gonna go are you gonna go also
[1:24:30] don't you think that brother branham
[1:24:31] don't you think that the Lord spoke
[1:24:34] through him and things to make people
[1:24:37] wonder and ponder wonder about it well
[1:24:44] he said this over here even I've even
[1:24:45] gave a quote about two or three sermons
[1:24:47] back he even makes it look a little
[1:24:49] shady the Lord does his works will make
[1:24:51] it he said the Lord will make things a
[1:24:53] little shady so that people can't get it
[1:24:59] see our God
[1:25:01] who's he making himself known to there's
[1:25:03] no question inside the inside that the
[1:25:06] little bride you're born of the Spirit
[1:25:08] of God you're one with him
[1:25:11] and you're not gonna go out here and try
[1:25:13] to produce some made-up works affair
[1:25:15] you're not gonna have some
[1:25:16] denominational spirit hanging around you
[1:25:18] you're not gonna have all this stuff out
[1:25:19] here it's the work of God and he's in
[1:25:22] our presence and we see him praise the
[1:25:27] Lord all right now all right let's see
[1:25:29] how far we can go Ruth chapter 4:13 and
[1:25:35] so boaz took ruth now i've started on
[1:25:39] verse chapter 5 I'm gonna come back to
[1:25:41] that right here so boaz took ruth hold
[1:25:45] that place go back to revelations 5 and
[1:25:52] we know the marriage if you have any
[1:25:54] questions about the marriage come go
[1:25:56] back to proving his word right before
[1:26:01] his leaving the earth he placed that
[1:26:04] marriage perfectly in its order brother
[1:26:07] Bram did God did through that prophet
[1:26:11] we're not going to a marriage he said
[1:26:13] we're going to a wedding supper the son
[1:26:16] of man unites the revealing of the son
[1:26:18] of man not the sign of the son of man
[1:26:21] the revealing of himself himself not
[1:26:24] pointing to it but himself there's your
[1:26:27] third pull the opening of himself in you
[1:26:32] amen all right revelations chapter 5 now
[1:26:36] where'd we stop her okay we oh yeah
[1:26:39] verse five okay and he saith unto me
[1:26:44] weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of
[1:26:45] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[1:26:47] to open the book and loosed the seven
[1:26:49] not six seven seals thereof I don't
[1:26:54] believe they're open well they are no
[1:26:57] matter what you believe or not I'm apart
[1:27:00] I'm the mystery of the seventh seal
[1:27:03] if that seventh seal wasn't opened we
[1:27:06] wouldn't know our position that book
[1:27:10] wouldn't have been open that mystery
[1:27:12] would have been sealed up yet because
[1:27:16] unless God thundered out you and I
[1:27:19] missed it
[1:27:20] Amen now that's a very broad statement
[1:27:24] but that's still the truth amen
[1:27:29] God spoke God revealed God opened our
[1:27:34] Savior opened but income as a corner now
[1:27:37] it came as a head it's this revelation
[1:27:42] that caps the bride it seals it alright
[1:27:48] because it's a revelation of himself not
[1:27:50] another and it's not just a partial it
[1:27:52] is a complete revelation of himself
[1:27:58] hallelujah alright so now this say you
[1:28:02] say brother David you're just too deep
[1:28:03] no you're just not you just need to get
[1:28:05] some revelation because the simplicity
[1:28:06] lays in Revelation not in your mental
[1:28:09] conception of it let God reveal that
[1:28:13] word to you and you'll see it's so
[1:28:15] simple you wonder how you missed it you
[1:28:16] missed it because you're trying to
[1:28:17] figure it out intellectually and you'll
[1:28:19] never get it that's how simple God
[1:28:22] becomes all right
[1:28:25] revelations 5 again now I get so caught
[1:28:28] up on these little topics I got it I'm
[1:28:30] spreading my time real thin right now
[1:28:32] all right behold the Lion of the tribe
[1:28:35] of Judah the lion had prevailed hath
[1:28:37] prevailed that means he overcame he
[1:28:40] wrestled and overcome all right to open
[1:28:44] the book and loose the seven seals
[1:28:45] thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst
[1:28:48] of the throne and what what was the
[1:28:50] seventh seal sealing the book
[1:28:59] so when he judges his bride remember
[1:29:03] that remember the white throne judgment
[1:29:05] the books were opened and another book
[1:29:07] that's the white throne where's the
[1:29:10] third one right here
[1:29:16] revelations 10 they're not going out to
[1:29:20] be judged God's already identified us in
[1:29:24] him the book he took the book he loosed
[1:29:29] the record and what is his judgment you
[1:29:32] are me I wish I could say that the way I
[1:29:40] feel it way I know it
[1:29:41] she is him same person he said same word
[1:29:53] I'm husband your bride we're facing Eden
[1:29:57] now with a masterpiece family time to go
[1:29:59] right back to Eden glory to God we broke
[1:30:06] the cycle brother Paul
[1:30:08] this cycle been broken all right watch
[1:30:12] what he says here he said I he said and
[1:30:15] beheld and lo in the midst as roll in
[1:30:17] the four beasts and the myths the elders
[1:30:18] stood a lamb the Word made flesh it had
[1:30:20] been slain having seven horns and seven
[1:30:22] eyes and are the seven spirits of God
[1:30:25] sent forth and all the earth and he came
[1:30:28] oh let me read it again and he came
[1:30:39] and he came what the sign tell us on
[1:30:43] sunset Mountain the fulfilling of
[1:30:46] prophecy brother Graham said it's a
[1:30:48] fulfilling a prophecy he came to forerun
[1:30:54] that under the under the commission like
[1:30:59] John the Baptist he was sent to forerun
[1:31:01] that then the corner was turned and he
[1:31:05] positioned us in the land then Joshua
[1:31:13] there right hallelujah amen what did
[1:31:20] Moses for run you could say he took all
[1:31:22] that way he formed the very opening of
[1:31:24] the word they came back with the
[1:31:25] evidence that spirit never left went
[1:31:30] right over to Joshua and Joshua type of
[1:31:32] the Holy Ghost absolutely come forth and
[1:31:34] began to reveal what Moses said and what
[1:31:37] Moses sent and and Wade signed it you're
[1:31:39] going in you're going in this land is
[1:31:41] given to you it's already promised
[1:31:43] Joshua and Caleb said we're more than
[1:31:44] conquerors let it go up at once and
[1:31:46] possess it because God gave it to us
[1:31:50] booyah hallelujah all right so he said
[1:31:54] and again stood a lamb it had been slain
[1:31:57] having seven horns seven eyes and he
[1:32:01] came and he came and took the book ruth
[1:32:08] 4:13 and boaz took ruth
[1:32:14] and she was his wife you say where do
[1:32:18] you get that from because brother
[1:32:19] Branham said that little book was the
[1:32:21] bride book and the bride book is the
[1:32:25] record of eternal life this is the only
[1:32:29] record first John five ten through 12
[1:32:32] he that hath the son and this is the
[1:32:35] record that he have given to us eternal
[1:32:37] life and this record is in his son and
[1:32:42] he that hath the son
[1:32:47] half life he that hath not the son hath
[1:32:52] not life so what's the record revealing
[1:32:55] his own life bride you're judged glory
[1:33:02] eat the book then what are you afraid of
[1:33:05] it for eat it go to the Angels said give
[1:33:13] me the book I have a right to that book
[1:33:15] it's a marriage certificate I'm his wife
[1:33:22] give me the book
[1:33:25] eat it up and I mouth will be sweet as
[1:33:29] honey in Revelation always is you've
[1:33:31] said hear me in the church right now get
[1:33:33] revelation to say praise the Lord yeah
[1:33:35] that's right sweet but then when you go
[1:33:40] to eat it and it has to drop into the
[1:33:42] belly and it begins to be digested
[1:33:45] then you're gonna prophesy again when it
[1:33:51] gets down to that digestion that's rough
[1:33:54] because now it's against your flesh
[1:33:57] now it's against your reasoning now it's
[1:33:59] against what others think now it's this
[1:34:01] now that reproach and persecution but
[1:34:04] you'll have to bear the same thing he
[1:34:05] did because you and him are one unless
[1:34:09] it gets into that belly then you're
[1:34:12] really one hallelujah you think troubles
[1:34:15] and struggles and all this what would be
[1:34:17] what would mean oh praise the Lord for
[1:34:19] it cuz without that you can't know him
[1:34:22] you can't manifest him you're you're up
[1:34:24] at night and you're struggling you're
[1:34:26] this you're that you're tore up why
[1:34:27] because you heard something that just oh
[1:34:29] Lord I wish I could see that oh god help
[1:34:31] me to see that why do I did this way why
[1:34:37] do I speak it this way Oh Lord this and
[1:34:39] that you know what I mean you're just
[1:34:42] digesting the food is all that was
[1:34:46] another message I titled it's got to be
[1:34:49] digested now you got portion of it
[1:34:51] alright okay I have a lot of portions
[1:34:55] when I preach any may he took the book
[1:34:57] can we gather that in and he took Ruth
[1:35:01] took Ruth and he and she was his wife
[1:35:04] not like a union to me and he went in
[1:35:10] done to her I hope you're reading and he
[1:35:16] went in done to her and she did what
[1:35:20] conceived what did the prophets say go
[1:35:23] back to Christ the mystery of God
[1:35:25] revealed I don't have time to read it go
[1:35:26] back there and see what he said she's
[1:35:28] pregnant
[1:35:29] her womb was had predestinated womb only
[1:35:32] to receive the german life because that
[1:35:34] seed was planted in there to receive
[1:35:36] that germ and that germ was you before
[1:35:38] the foundation of the world and that
[1:35:39] German that was you before the
[1:35:40] foundation world finds you today praise
[1:35:47] the Lord praise the Lord amen and he
[1:35:53] took the book and when it conceived and
[1:35:56] she Barisan what is the conception his
[1:35:58] own life you have no other identity that
[1:36:04] makes you become the very Church of the
[1:36:05] Living God the very body of himself in
[1:36:07] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[1:36:10] how does this flesh become his flesh
[1:36:13] brother Branham asked that question in
[1:36:15] in the rising of the Sun and he answered
[1:36:19] it he said go back to Romans 8:11 how
[1:36:21] does this flesh become his flesh when
[1:36:23] the spirit that raised Jesus from the
[1:36:25] dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:36:28] Christ shall also quicken your mortal
[1:36:29] body
[1:36:30] in other words bring it subject to the
[1:36:32] word subject to the word not something
[1:36:35] to some mental idea not subject to
[1:36:37] another spirit subject to the word if
[1:36:39] that seems down inside of you he will
[1:36:42] quicken you and bring your spirit and
[1:36:44] your body subject to the world amen all
[1:36:52] right so he took and when he had taken
[1:36:55] the book eighth verse the four beasts
[1:36:58] and and elders fell down you know John
[1:37:00] saw himself there that's why he could
[1:37:03] shout John looked to pass the curtain of
[1:37:06] time and said well there's John I'm one
[1:37:08] of those elders I see myself in the book
[1:37:11] I see myself bowing down here
[1:37:15] and here he was that he fell down before
[1:37:17] the lamb every one of them having said
[1:37:19] harps and golden vials full of odours
[1:37:22] which are the prayers of the Saints
[1:37:23] prayers of the Saints hallelujah and
[1:37:30] they sang the new song he couldn't take
[1:37:36] they couldn't sing it until the book was
[1:37:38] taken amen
[1:37:42] right not gonna sing this new song until
[1:37:44] the books taken that's what separates
[1:37:47] the bride from the rest and they sang a
[1:37:53] new song
[1:37:53] thou art worthy to take the book and to
[1:37:56] open the seals thereof for thou was
[1:37:58] slain and redeemed us to God and by thy
[1:38:01] blood out of every kindred tongue people
[1:38:02] a nation and has made us to our God made
[1:38:05] us unto our God kings and priests and we
[1:38:08] shall reign on this earth much could be
[1:38:10] read further I think you're getting the
[1:38:12] picture
[1:38:14] amen when he took that book he was
[1:38:17] mediating but when he took that book and
[1:38:19] claimed his redeem then he went he still
[1:38:20] interceded till that last one realizes
[1:38:22] who they are in the book and matured in
[1:38:25] that word then he doesn't take an
[1:38:27] immature pride home but he's honest but
[1:38:30] he is here receiving her home he is
[1:38:33] receiving her ready to meet her in the
[1:38:35] air don't place all the coming in the
[1:38:37] meeting in the air that portion of the
[1:38:39] greatest mystery of that coming is right
[1:38:41] now if you don't get it right now you
[1:38:47] won't meet him in the air that's all
[1:38:50] there is to it
[1:38:50] that's what's being unveiled the pastor
[1:38:53] knows how to bring it to the church I
[1:38:55] just got a preach what's on my heart I
[1:38:56] just got to lay it out he can pick up
[1:38:58] the pieces amen
[1:39:04] I put him together other words as the
[1:39:07] Holy Spirit leads him for the Sheep amen
[1:39:11] Chris can't preach any other way than he
[1:39:13] preaches I got a preach like I preach
[1:39:15] and bless God he's a God variety I kind
[1:39:18] of like that I kind of like that really
[1:39:20] well that I like it very very well takes
[1:39:24] all the fear about Who I am
[1:39:27] what how I act and what I do it's gone
[1:39:31] brother BAM said when the token comes in
[1:39:34] no fear what do you have to fear it's he
[1:39:37] that worketh in you both to will and to
[1:39:39] do of his good pleasure your crucified
[1:39:41] with Christ nevertheless you live
[1:39:43] brother Ram said there's the token it's
[1:39:46] not you living anymore it's Christ
[1:39:47] living in you so where is your
[1:39:49] confidence it's in that word in you
[1:39:52] that's what God said I wanted you to
[1:39:55] have confidence in that's why you got to
[1:39:56] deny yourself daily and take up your
[1:39:58] cross put yourself on that cross and
[1:40:00] follow me who is he
[1:40:02] he's the word of promise for the season
[1:40:06] he's the whole word what's in season the
[1:40:10] full word okay so it's hidden mystery
[1:40:17] now I'm gonna drop these things in I
[1:40:19] have time to look it up let me just tell
[1:40:20] you church age book he talked about that
[1:40:23] remember he said in the invisible union
[1:40:25] it's like two books but it isn't he said
[1:40:29] it's it's it's one book brother Brown
[1:40:32] then the church age started in church
[1:40:34] age he said it's one book there's no
[1:40:36] difference between the Lambs book the
[1:40:37] book of life the ride book whatever he
[1:40:40] book written in heaven I don't have time
[1:40:44] on this but I but I will tell you this
[1:40:46] in the church age book he typed it right
[1:40:49] out and said he said but there's a
[1:40:51] section in that book that's a little
[1:40:54] record a section that's the Bride
[1:40:57] section it's the eternal life record
[1:40:59] section and that section is written of
[1:41:01] her Amen well maybe I should let's see
[1:41:08] I've got about five ten minutes I have
[1:41:12] couple hours actually
[1:41:17] but when Christ who is our life shall
[1:41:19] appear where do we appear at Scripture
[1:41:25] we're hidden Christ sealed there brother
[1:41:27] brems that always hid in Christ brother
[1:41:29] branham always referred to it then
[1:41:30] sealed and sealed in him to the day of
[1:41:33] redemption is that right sealed what a
[1:41:35] great thing it is to know you're sealed
[1:41:39] then how in the world are you going to
[1:41:41] come out here and do contrary to the
[1:41:44] word and say you're sealed and how in
[1:41:49] the world well I will go any further
[1:41:53] with that all right let me just let me
[1:42:01] just refer what I mean here but what
[1:42:03] brother Brown said here in church age
[1:42:05] book page 280 if you want to put these
[1:42:07] down you can read page 282 82 to 83 to
[1:42:12] 84 and you'll find exactly where we're
[1:42:14] talking if you haven't read the Sardis
[1:42:15] in church age go back and read it get
[1:42:18] into it because it identifies that book
[1:42:21] and how he judges the people all right
[1:42:25] now watch he says here on paragraph 2
[1:42:29] I'm in Somerton I can't look at summer
[1:42:32] in church age yeah here it is 280 first
[1:42:38] off blessed is the man to whom God will
[1:42:42] not impute sin and indeed she shall be
[1:42:45] with him speaking of the bride in his
[1:42:47] throne of judgment judging the world and
[1:42:49] even angels her name each of her members
[1:42:52] was written in a section of the Lamb's
[1:42:54] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:42:59] the world he says and goes on to say
[1:43:02] that those names could never be removed
[1:43:04] they can be be said out of the regular
[1:43:06] book of life but he said not out of that
[1:43:08] section a bride's judgment I'm not
[1:43:14] finished yet so just hold the token I
[1:43:16] mean hold still hold the token to
[1:43:20] crucify yourself now for a little bit
[1:43:23] we're gonna I wish he would shut up and
[1:43:26] all I didn't mean that
[1:43:27] I wish he'd be quiet so we could go get
[1:43:28] a lunch anymore all right
[1:43:34] you really want me to okay on page 282
[1:43:38] he said he said being predestinated
[1:43:41] according to the purpose of him who
[1:43:42] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:43:44] his own will he chose us in himself he
[1:43:47] said thus God has so designed that those
[1:43:49] whose names are placed in a section of
[1:43:51] the Lamb's Book of
[1:43:51] life and cannot be a race for they are
[1:43:53] the names of his bride all right
[1:43:58] you go down here to 283 now the record
[1:44:00] of this wheat plant whose the whole
[1:44:02] wheat plant he's talking about whose end
[1:44:04] is to be reproduced the original the
[1:44:07] original seed and multiplied whose scuse
[1:44:09] me let me read again but then now then
[1:44:11] the record of this wheat plant whose end
[1:44:14] is to reproduce the original seed in a
[1:44:16] multiplied form is the book of life the
[1:44:21] wheat plant is this is page 283 283 I'm
[1:44:26] reading from I repeat he said the
[1:44:27] history or record of this wheat plant is
[1:44:30] the book of life of which a part of the
[1:44:33] book of life is the record of eternal
[1:44:35] life see even you can see that that life
[1:44:38] that record comes up through every one
[1:44:40] of those sections every one I mean of
[1:44:42] those carriers right through Pentecost
[1:44:46] amen this message of the seventh angel
[1:44:50] the third pole is not Pentecostal
[1:44:52] message and yet we have to come but
[1:44:55] brother I just let me just say something
[1:44:56] to you what are we talking about this
[1:44:58] morning things that are to be brother
[1:45:00] Brown said the the baptism of the Holy
[1:45:02] Ghost is a temporal gift for you do we
[1:45:04] have it every day are we baptized afresh
[1:45:06] yes but it's a temporal gift it's there
[1:45:10] to water the seed amen
[1:45:12] you better stander the spouts thend
[1:45:14] better start opening reading the book
[1:45:17] alright let the Holy Ghost water at then
[1:45:19] see alright but he said it's a temporal
[1:45:22] gift for you to you but he said the real
[1:45:26] gift is that soul down in there that
[1:45:28] born of God there it is there's the
[1:45:32] inside of the inside there's what God
[1:45:34] recognizes that'll live the word for the
[1:45:37] season if that's not the if that's not
[1:45:39] the wheat if that's not the true word
[1:45:41] seed laying in there ready for the germ
[1:45:44] ready for life to strike that see it'll
[1:45:47] never reproduce Christ
[1:45:48] but whatever the seed is it's going to
[1:45:50] reproduce what it is by the anointing of
[1:45:52] the Holy Ghost because it can fall on
[1:45:55] your spirit the Holy Ghost can and bear
[1:46:00] a cockle burr life if that's cocklebur
[1:46:02] see down in that soul
[1:46:05] but if it's real word seed what are you
[1:46:07] gonna bear it's gonna bear the promise
[1:46:09] of the hour it's gonna bear the word for
[1:46:11] the season it's going to bear Jesus
[1:46:13] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[1:46:15] forever that's what it'll bear
[1:46:17] it'll believe in the supernatural
[1:46:19] because it is supernatural it is the
[1:46:22] original faith it is the original Christ
[1:46:25] it is Christ in head form and brother
[1:46:28] Ram said the head is now uniting with
[1:46:30] the body now let me just go a little bit
[1:46:34] further he says now a part of that life
[1:46:38] is the record of eternal life a section
[1:46:40] of the book of life this is convincingly
[1:46:43] seen by examining the wheat plant all
[1:46:45] right he goes on to tell about the wheat
[1:46:47] plant I'll just let you read it but he
[1:46:49] said the record of eternal life is a
[1:46:51] section again all right it's a little
[1:46:54] section a little book like brother
[1:46:56] Mannis it's a book within a book
[1:46:57] he said one place that's exactly right
[1:47:01] and then he said then he turned around
[1:47:03] in invisible Union and said this Lamb's
[1:47:06] Book of Life then he said isn't is
[1:47:08] different from there from there from the
[1:47:11] the I've got it right here
[1:47:16] I better just read it let me just read
[1:47:19] it here in the rising I think it's no
[1:47:22] let me think now invisible Union yeah
[1:47:27] paragraph invisible Union 303 let me
[1:47:30] just read something to you so you'd say
[1:47:31] you'd get what I'm saying here what he
[1:47:34] said about it
[1:47:34] invisible Union paragraph 303 God had to
[1:47:40] open those seven seals not in the
[1:47:42] denomination I've always been against it
[1:47:43] but out of the denomination that he
[1:47:45] might take a bride not a denominational
[1:47:47] bride he couldn't do it it's against his
[1:47:49] own word he opened those seven mysteries
[1:47:52] in there that shows forth brings forth
[1:47:54] those things that's been hid since the
[1:47:57] foundation of the world might be
[1:47:58] revealed in the last days two sons of
[1:48:00] God now brought he said they brought
[1:48:03] they they that forth they brought that
[1:48:07] forth now before the people that they
[1:48:09] see it they're you you you now in now
[1:48:14] see it there see it see it there you now
[1:48:18] to this under
[1:48:19] nominal bride there is your two books
[1:48:22] one of them is the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:48:24] your name on theirs predestinated on
[1:48:26] there you can't go because no no more
[1:48:29] than you can take away nothing else it
[1:48:31] can't go because you can't you can take
[1:48:33] mmm you can no more take that away than
[1:48:36] anything than nothing see because it was
[1:48:39] foreordained to be on there but the
[1:48:41] regular that's what I wanted to work but
[1:48:43] the regular book of life he said can
[1:48:47] take that off at any time so see now it
[1:48:50] takes what he said in the church age
[1:48:51] brings it out as a section he brings it
[1:48:54] out and divides the regular book of life
[1:48:56] from the Lamb's Book so the Lamb's Book
[1:48:58] in that in that what he just said here
[1:49:00] is that section of the record of his own
[1:49:04] life oh brother sister what are we
[1:49:07] trying to say what's God judging us
[1:49:12] there you are himself
[1:49:15] you are himself you are just himself in
[1:49:18] another form
[1:49:20] it's the revelation of the Son of Man
[1:49:23] it's more than just succumbing they key
[1:49:25] came in every age but this coming is
[1:49:27] different this is seat again it's the
[1:49:31] same time this is bride time
[1:49:34] this is bride age how many ever heard
[1:49:39] prophets say that bride times seed time
[1:49:41] bride age and what's he said when he
[1:49:46] unites with the bride he said then what
[1:49:48] is it it's the revelation of the son of
[1:49:50] man again see we're further down the
[1:49:54] line
[1:49:56] you wonder why these things are
[1:49:58] happening the way they are because it's
[1:50:00] just preparing for that Confederation to
[1:50:02] step in of churches see see is going to
[1:50:05] make it look so reasonable start getting
[1:50:07] money from the government doing all
[1:50:08] these things you know just make it so
[1:50:09] comfortable and then make stipulations
[1:50:11] with it it's contrary to the word be
[1:50:15] careful it'll look so reasonable and so
[1:50:17] light you'll want to stay in it that's
[1:50:21] why we that's why I thank God for a
[1:50:23] godly pastor thank God for godly
[1:50:25] ministry that can identify that thing
[1:50:27] though it looks reasonably right and say
[1:50:30] no it's not of God
[1:50:31] it's
[1:50:32] that spirit and the two spirits would be
[1:50:34] so close it would deceive the elected
[1:50:36] possible all right so see what we're
[1:50:40] seeing what was happening here says you
[1:50:43] don't he said if you don't repent the
[1:50:45] regular book of life it's off of that
[1:50:46] regular book you're going to stand
[1:50:48] judgment the bride don't even stand the
[1:50:49] judgment but goes in the rapture you see
[1:50:51] brother sister you see you've done
[1:50:53] things you've done things you know you
[1:50:54] need to go to those individuals and make
[1:50:56] that thing right that'll hang on you for
[1:50:58] the rest of your life unless you make it
[1:50:59] right you'll not go any further
[1:51:02] yeah well I may die I ask God to forgive
[1:51:05] me but when you got to go to individuals
[1:51:07] that you spoke evil of and you lied
[1:51:09] about and you think you just get by with
[1:51:14] it I Got News for You you better make it
[1:51:18] right or you're not going anywhere
[1:51:23] amen
[1:51:24] call the ministry a certain thing and
[1:51:26] all these other things about it and
[1:51:28] think you get by with that you can't I
[1:51:31] might as well say it I'm a minister I'm
[1:51:33] gonna point that thing and unveil that
[1:51:35] spirit right there because if you don't
[1:51:37] make it right you're not going anywhere
[1:51:39] else forward with God till you get it
[1:51:42] right I don't care how much we how much
[1:51:49] we can read how much we can dance and
[1:51:52] sing the cocklebur does that just as
[1:51:55] strong as the wheat does are you with me
[1:51:59] I know this is rough I didn't come here
[1:52:02] to pity party I come here to patch you
[1:52:04] ain't covered pad anybody but the Lord
[1:52:08] lays this in my heart I'm gonna say it
[1:52:11] judgment begins at the house of God you
[1:52:14] better thankful that God puts his finger
[1:52:16] on something because He loves you and
[1:52:17] it's for your deliverance not to demean
[1:52:19] you so be careful how you take what's
[1:52:21] being said it's not a man speaking to
[1:52:24] you it's the Word of God speaking to you
[1:52:29] you may not like the way it's said but
[1:52:31] you better judge it by the word I don't
[1:52:36] know why I'm saying this but God wants
[1:52:39] it said I'm just going to have to close
[1:52:40] because I got so much here but remember
[1:52:45] we got a bride's book you want to know
[1:52:47] where he said about to be in bride's
[1:52:48] book right here on gods only provided
[1:52:55] place of worship paragraph 260
[1:52:57] he said he forward named them placing
[1:52:59] their names in this bride book now you
[1:53:02] tell me if that's not the little book if
[1:53:04] that's not a section of the book what
[1:53:06] did he come to unveil himself
[1:53:08] what's the bride's judgement let me get
[1:53:11] that let me finish right here let me
[1:53:13] just finish it right here I'm leaving a
[1:53:15] lot but let me just finish it right here
[1:53:18] is visible Union we'll just finish it we
[1:53:21] could say a lot Christ some mystery we
[1:53:23] always said a lot I've referred to you
[1:53:25] just search it out it's too much like
[1:53:27] brother Paul said of course I've never
[1:53:29] said that before
[1:53:30] but it's so much I can't get it all out
[1:53:34] I just have to break it down to several
[1:53:39] parts but sometimes you get caught up
[1:53:43] and you're going on something else you
[1:53:44] forget the part you before because it
[1:53:49] keeps unfolding unfolding everyday and
[1:53:50] unfolds I don't know about you but every
[1:53:52] day is something new I can't write down
[1:53:55] fast enough it is the truth absolutely

[1:57:15] something right I said I didn't have the
[1:57:18] right attitude done and you know what I
[1:57:20] walked back in there and nobody around
[1:57:22] she was the one taking the money and on
[1:57:23] the helping out and she why she had
[1:57:25] walked out right if I had just met her
[1:57:27] right there I thought Lord how perfect

[1:58:34] in Camp Verde Arizona I followed that
[1:58:36] man all the way in to where he stopped
[1:58:39] at a post office I caught out and I said

[1:58:44] I said I won't apologize to you I had a
[1:58:47] wrong attitude and you pulled out in
[1:58:49] front of me over there because God spoke
[1:58:51] to me and said I allowed that man to
[1:58:54] pull out in front of you I had control
[1:58:58] of that matter what are you murmuring
[1:59:01] about now eat on that one awhile
[1:59:05] murmuring complaining how many things do
[1:59:08] we murmur about every day I decided that

[1:59:45] to you and say I'm sorry I shouldn't
[1:59:46] have thought of that what do you do say

[2:00:03] every man his trespass how Jesus said

[2:02:40] manifest there is no fault in her I
[2:02:44] didn't even hear an Amen there is no
[2:02:47] fault in her
[2:02:49] that's not my judgment if I was to look
[2:02:53] at you as a man and judge you what would
[2:02:55] I judge but if I look at the word of
[2:02:57] Judge you what am I going to judge

[2:04:09] control just like the man pulled out in
[2:04:12] front of you who loved him to do it

[2:06:17] husband that you were married to to the
[2:06:19] world in the anointed bridegroom which
[2:06:21] foreordained you has washed you by the
[2:06:23] washing of the word that old husband is

[2:07:16] that you are married to the anointed
[2:07:18] bridegroom which foreign aid you has
[2:07:20] washed you by the washing of the water

[2:08:01] pastor separates isn't that right
[2:08:05] separates everything that isn't seed
[2:08:07] separates out and goes out the back end

[2:08:39] separating there's a difference between
[2:08:45] the seed and the shuck the seed shall
[2:08:49] not be heir with the shuck and when you
[2:08:53] begin to say I am my father 1 and these
[2:08:55] other things the shuck pulls away there
[2:08:59] it is the shuck pulls away you didn't
[2:09:02] pull away from them the shuck pulls away
[2:09:05] from the word because the word separates

[2:12:49] difference aren't the brides teaching is
[2:12:52] the word for the season that's right the
[2:12:57] prophets teaching was the word for the
[2:12:59] season where's the voice under her

[2:13:19] start raising up politically naturally
[2:13:21] churches everything else we see it
[2:13:23] forming what's it coming against trying
[2:13:25] to stop this bride he tried to stop me
[2:13:28] in that office this morning made me
[2:13:30] whole spill a hole most a bunch of water
[2:13:31] on the desk but Paul I'm sorry I got it
[2:13:34] wiped up and it went everywhere else but
[2:13:37] on my books I did I see the supernatural
[2:13:43] yes I'm trying to open one of those
[2:13:46] bottles in there and I that thing opened
[2:13:48] up but I couldn't get it undone from the
[2:13:49] the lid caught caught and well those
[2:13:51] little thingamajig trying to do a thing

[2:14:09] of wiping everything up lift the glass
[2:14:11] up all won't notice doesn't matter
[2:14:21] I just want to testify though the devil
[2:14:25] don't like it you don't like it when you
[2:14:27] preach like this because it uncovers sin
[2:14:31] and you know what we expect to come in
[2:14:33] this Tabernacle if you've got sin in
[2:14:36] your life if you've got things hidden
[2:14:38] didn't think nobody knows about it I
[2:14:39] want you to tell you something where two
[2:14:41] or three are gathered together the
[2:14:42] deserters here and he's gonna uncover
[2:14:44] that thing don't you come walking in
[2:14:47] here because you don't want that word
[2:14:49] doesn't cover you why is it being
[2:14:52] uncovered so you can be set free that's
[2:14:57] what light sent for you know the Bible
[2:14:59] said light doth make manifest sin
[2:15:02] alright I'm sorry I get tarried away
[2:15:05] when I eat but watch when I get carried
[2:15:06] away
[2:15:08] you think I'm carried away now wait till
[2:15:11] then I can't wait till then
[2:15:13] but I have to wait till then if I was
[2:15:15] supposed to die in the morning and a man
[2:15:18] took my place I cannot die for that sin
[2:15:20] somebody took my place Jesus a word took
[2:15:22] my place he became me and that a sinner
[2:15:26] that I might become him the word the
[2:15:29] word let me hold true to it not the
[2:15:31] church let me hold true to the word all
[2:15:34] that spiritual union of Christ in His
[2:15:37] Church now when the flesh is becoming
[2:15:39] word and the word is becoming flesh
[2:15:41] manifested vindicated just what the
[2:15:43] Bible said would happen in this day it's
[2:15:46] happening day by day all right why it's
[2:15:51] called meeting so fast out there and
[2:15:53] those desert sand things taking place I
[2:15:54] couldn't even keep up with it and you
[2:15:56] know what I can say I can say it's doing
[2:15:57] the same thing to me individually it's
[2:15:59] happening so fast now brother Paul I'm
[2:16:02] sure it's just all of a sudden it's just
[2:16:03] here it's here it's here it's here it's
[2:16:04] here it just ties together ties together
[2:16:06] ties together
[2:16:07] one message over here right back over
[2:16:09] here ties together ties together and
[2:16:12] then tried to bring it in 30 minutes try
[2:16:20] to bring it to hours 510 no listen he
[2:16:28] said watch the word becomes the word
[2:16:31] we're near the coming of Jesus meeting
[2:16:34] United with this church when the word
[2:16:36] becomes the word Amen when the word
[2:16:39] becomes a word well that's all brother
[2:16:41] David see we still have to having come
[2:16:42] to do that no it's happening the words
[2:16:45] becoming the word but the flesh will
[2:16:47] become the word then will be changed we
[2:16:50] have to first be changed like Abraham
[2:16:53] was changed to see the son you say that
[2:16:57] again we've got to have our change
[2:17:00] before we can meet him in the air and
[2:17:04] we've got to be changed or we're not
[2:17:07] going to meet him physically changed but
[2:17:10] what is it it's a inside change first
[2:17:13] and it's happening and it's happening
[2:17:16] it's a mystery of a secret coming that
[2:17:21] the public doesn't know nothing about
[2:17:24] but it's lived right out before but
[2:17:27] thanks be to God for that because if
[2:17:29] there happened to be a predestinated
[2:17:30] seed down to one of those little lives
[2:17:32] that light strike that seed they're
[2:17:35] gonna say why are you so different
[2:17:37] what's wrong what's happened to you why
[2:17:41] do you speak differently you're like
[2:17:44] you're speaking in another language now
[2:17:48] their tongue that's right we were
[2:17:53] discussing that the other day another
[2:17:55] tongue a new tongue amen what it is a
[2:18:01] new tongue
[2:18:06] oh I'm not done yet you're standing
[2:18:08] completely you never sinned in the first
[2:18:10] place Chloe that's me too how many say
[2:18:18] it's you you never sinned in the first
[2:18:22] place
[2:18:23] god bless you my brother all these raise
[2:18:25] your hand god bless you
[2:18:26] you'd be an honest amen I'd never sinned
