[24:59] do we have sound

[25:04] so let me repeat myself
[25:08] if you don't love church don't go to
[25:09] heaven
[25:11] because it's going to be church for
[25:12] eternity
[25:14] amen
[25:16] praise the lord we stand tonight
[25:24] amen praise the lord
[25:28] i didn't mean that to sound negative in
[25:29] the in that in that way but
[25:33] amen acts chapter seven
[25:35] if you have your bibles you know i was
[25:36] sitting in the back thinking
[25:39] take this coat off now before i get
[25:40] started
[25:51] and i was praying for for different
[25:53] needs in our body and just praying that
[25:55] the lord would speak to our hearts
[25:57] tonight and i began to think you know
[26:00] we're we as humans we say and i won't
[26:03] keep you standing for long we say sunday
[26:06] is a greater service than wednesday
[26:08] night
[26:09] and meetings greater than sunday morning
[26:12] and camp meetings greater than meetings
[26:16] but that's what we say
[26:20] and the reason that is is because we
[26:22] ourselves
[26:23] don't live in a place
[26:27] that we don't live in that place of
[26:29] close connection with the lord
[26:31] in close connection with the lord you
[26:32] don't need your flesh worked up
[26:35] because your spirit's already on fire
[26:38] so tonight in in you know wednesday
[26:41] night this is no different
[26:43] than any other service you've ever been
[26:45] in the most powerful service you can
[26:47] think of guess what the word is still
[26:48] being spoken tonight
[26:50] the same word that god designed that god
[26:53] spoke from the beginning
[26:55] amen
[26:56] so have faith
[26:58] whatever your need is it doesn't matter
[27:00] that it's wednesday night doesn't matter
[27:01] that it's brother chris
[27:04] it's god's word being spoken
[27:06] acts chapter seven
[27:18] acts chapter seven
[27:21] verse 18.
[27:31] 7 18. so here we have um
[27:36] stephen
[27:37] he was called by the church
[27:41] by by god
[27:43] through the the
[27:44] vote to be one of the first deacons and
[27:50] he was out preaching the word of god
[27:52] excuse me
[28:05] i know it's goofy but if i leave that
[28:06] it's going to drive me crazy because
[28:08] it's not being used
[28:10] so he's out preaching
[28:12] and they arrested stephen and he begins
[28:14] to
[28:15] i call it stephen's rebuke he begins to
[28:17] to minister
[28:19] and his title was ye stiff neck
[28:21] uncircumcised
[28:22] people
[28:24] and uh about a portion of his way
[28:26] through the sermon he starts with
[28:28] abraham he starts at the beginning of
[28:30] the church of israel and he gets through
[28:33] abraham and joseph
[28:35] and he gets down to begin the story of
[28:37] moses verse 18 acts 7 18 tell another
[28:40] king rose which knew not joseph the same
[28:43] dealt subtly with our kindred and evil
[28:46] entreated our fathers so that they cast
[28:48] out their young children to the end they
[28:50] might not live i was reading this and i
[28:52] thought you know what the pharaoh didn't
[28:54] just come and say okay y'all are slaves
[28:56] now
[28:58] it says they dealt subtly so a little
[29:01] bit here a little bit there a little bit
[29:03] here tell at the end of the of the end
[29:06] of of of the the program
[29:08] they found themselves completely in
[29:10] bondage it wasn't just
[29:12] overnight
[29:14] and the devil does a thing same thing
[29:15] it's a slow fade
[29:18] um
[29:19] verse 20 in which most in which time
[29:21] moses was born and was exceeding fair
[29:23] and nourished up in his father's house
[29:25] three months and when he was cast out
[29:27] pharaoh's daughter took him up and
[29:29] nourished him for her own son and moses
[29:32] was learned in all the wisdom of the
[29:34] egyptians and was mighty in words
[29:37] and deeds
[29:38] and when he was full 40 years old it
[29:41] came into his heart to visit his
[29:43] brethren the children of israel
[29:45] and seeing one of them suffer wrong he
[29:47] defended him and avenged him that he
[29:50] that was oppressed and smote the
[29:52] egyptian i'm going to pause there and
[29:53] we're going to pray because i don't want
[29:54] to keep you standing for too long
[29:56] heavenly father lord jesus we thank you
[29:58] for your word tonight we ask that you
[29:59] would speak to us lord father by the
[30:01] power given to us lord as your children
[30:03] as your bride we bind every hindering
[30:05] spirit in the name of jesus christ lord
[30:07] that your word would have preeminence
[30:09] lord that you would have full control of
[30:10] the service full control of our thoughts
[30:12] our hearts lord and father you would
[30:14] increase our revelation increase our
[30:17] strength inspire us lord give us that
[30:19] touch that deliverance and healing we
[30:21] ask lord we commit these things into
[30:23] your hands in the name of jesus christ
[30:25] we pray amen you may be seated tonight
[30:34] so we have moses here who's 40 years old
[30:39] and
[30:40] my my title
[30:42] tonight
[30:43] is appointment with destiny
[30:47] and my subtitle is it happened on holy
[30:49] ground
[30:50] appointment with destiny
[30:52] i have quotes to back up
[30:54] the word destiny in case you're thinking
[30:55] i'm getting carnal on you
[30:58] so moses here in in the scripture is 40
[31:01] years old
[31:02] and before we read the next verse so
[31:04] don't skip ahead
[31:06] this is a man
[31:08] a very intelligent man
[31:10] there wasn't a law in the land he didn't
[31:12] know he could tell you paragraph 365
[31:15] subject a
[31:17] and uh this is the the law he knew he
[31:19] was he was he was mighty in words and in
[31:21] deeds
[31:23] okay so think think about that as we
[31:25] read uh 24 and seeing one of them suffer
[31:28] wrong he defended him and avenged him
[31:30] that was oppressed and smote the
[31:32] egyptian he knew he was breaking the law
[31:35] he wasn't just caught up in the moment
[31:37] and and no he knew what he was doing
[31:40] he was a smart man but you see he had it
[31:43] figured out
[31:44] he talked to any criminal they had it
[31:46] figured out
[31:48] uh until they got caught
[31:50] but you see here he moses had it figured
[31:52] out he'd gone over the details in his
[31:54] head and his and he thought about it and
[31:56] and he went out if you go and you read
[31:58] in exodus he went out among his brethren
[32:00] so he was walking around seeing what was
[32:03] happening taking into account he began
[32:04] to formulate because he felt that
[32:06] calling in his life he felt that that
[32:08] poll in his life that he wanted to
[32:10] rescue his his brethren and we we take
[32:12] that that type sometimes it many times
[32:15] just say
[32:16] you know he he thought of uh uh
[32:19] he would just go ahead and do it his own
[32:21] thing
[32:22] um and and moses was was trying to take
[32:25] the
[32:26] the word of god the promise the promise
[32:28] was they would go into bondage but that
[32:29] they would be free he was trying to take
[32:31] that promise into his own hands and
[32:34] whenever whenever a man or a church or a
[32:37] system begins to take god's word
[32:40] destiny your destiny in their own hands
[32:42] they begin to play with that that is a
[32:44] religious spirit
[32:46] a religious spirit says we look we see
[32:48] the promise of god you see it's it's
[32:50] religious it looks like the real thing
[32:52] it's close but they say we want to take
[32:54] this and we want to put it in our time
[32:58] we want to set it into our into motion
[33:00] at this time and we want it to look like
[33:02] this a certain way but but it it's so
[33:05] close it would deceive the very elect
[33:07] but there's one thing with the religious
[33:09] spirit it relax
[33:11] lacks excuse me the authority of christ
[33:14] so so moses here he goes out verse 25
[33:17] for he supposed his brethren would have
[33:19] understood how that god by his hand
[33:21] would deliver them but they understood
[33:23] not so there went his plan his plan was
[33:26] hey they're going to understand and the
[33:27] rebellion's going to rise up and i'm not
[33:29] going to have to worry about pharaoh but
[33:31] his plan disappeared it vaporized and
[33:33] the next day he showed himself unto them
[33:35] as they strove so two israelites
[33:37] fighting and would have set them at one
[33:39] again saying sergi our brethren why do
[33:42] you wrong one to another but he that did
[33:44] his neighbor wrong thrust him away
[33:46] saying who made thee a ruler and a judge
[33:48] over us will thou kill me as thou didst
[33:51] the egyptian yesterday
[33:53] you know one thing about a church news
[33:55] travels fast
[33:56] then fled moses at this saying and was a
[33:58] stranger in the land of midian where he
[34:01] begot two sons and when 40 years were
[34:03] expired another 40 years i haven't even
[34:06] lived 40 years
[34:08] i'm not even ready to leave egypt if i
[34:11] was moses it's a long that's a lot of
[34:13] time to be sitting on something to be
[34:15] sitting on a calling to be to feeling
[34:17] this way and then to run no doubt moses
[34:20] beat himself up for 40 years thinking i
[34:22] made a mistake i've ruined it
[34:26] but he had an appointment with destiny
[34:29] and moses at this saying okay excuse me
[34:31] when 40 years were expired verse 30
[34:32] there appeared to him in the wilderness
[34:34] of mount sinai an angel of the lord in a
[34:36] flame of fire in a bush
[34:39] which was christ
[34:40] tell them i am that i am
[34:43] and when moses saw it he wandered at the
[34:45] sight and as he drew near he stepped
[34:47] aside to go look at this bush that
[34:48] burned
[34:50] but but then it wasn't consumed behold
[34:52] to behold it the voice of the lord came
[34:55] unto him
[34:56] saying i am the god of thy fathers the
[34:58] god of abraham and the god of isaac and
[35:01] the god of jacob then moses trembled and
[35:04] durst not behold then said the lord to
[35:06] him put off thy shoes from thy feet
[35:09] for the place where thou standest is
[35:11] holy ground now i took a little bit of
[35:13] time to kind of figure out you know in
[35:15] my in my engineer brain i like to over
[35:17] complicate things and and by god's grace
[35:20] and his simplicity and his spirit he
[35:22] helps me overcome that and i began to
[35:24] think about shoes and and the simple
[35:26] fact of it is is that people are very
[35:28] proud of their shoes
[35:33] these aren't these are just you know
[35:34] whatever's but these are oxfords
[35:39] status
[35:41] gucci if you're into that
[35:43] or genuine leather handmade in the
[35:46] united states
[35:48] or genuine leather handmade in in italy
[35:51] people feel important with their shoes
[35:54] and you feel a little bit less
[35:56] uh confident when you're barefoot
[36:00] let me tell you something
[36:02] do you think if you went do you feel
[36:04] confident going into an interview
[36:06] with a full suit barefoot
[36:08] absolutely not
[36:11] so here is moses and the first thing
[36:12] that god requires of him is
[36:15] put aside your pride
[36:19] and show respect
[36:21] but it says respect to take his shoes
[36:23] off you're standing on holy ground moses
[36:25] take off your shoes
[36:27] these are probably special boots
[36:28] handcrafted in egypt
[36:31] that had lasted 40 years he'd always
[36:33] taken good care of them these are his
[36:35] egyptian boots
[36:36] and the lord said look you can't meet me
[36:38] walking on a other a man's religion
[36:42] i want you to stand and come into
[36:44] contact
[36:45] nothing between i want full contact
[36:47] moses so he says take off your shoes for
[36:50] the place where thou standest is holy
[36:52] ground
[36:53] i have seen i have seen the affliction
[36:55] of my people which is in egypt and i
[36:56] have heard their groaning and then come
[36:58] down to deliver them now come i will
[37:01] send thee into egypt this moses whom
[37:04] they refused saying who made thee a
[37:05] ruler and a judge the same did god send
[37:08] to be a ruler
[37:10] and a deliverer by the hand of the angel
[37:13] which appeared to him in the bush you
[37:15] see the first time around it was moses
[37:18] on his own but the second time around
[37:20] there was a change of ownership
[37:23] now it wasn't moses going back
[37:26] it was god in moses going back but you
[37:30] see god likes to make sure you have
[37:33] faith so he sent the same man that
[37:35] everyone's been gossiping about for 40
[37:37] years you remember that guy that thought
[37:39] he could deliver us and he ran into the
[37:40] wilderness and we hadn't seen him in 40
[37:42] years you remember that guy wow you know
[37:43] people talk about him at the potlucks
[37:45] the sunday paul remember that guy yeah
[37:46] that preacher you know whatever he he
[37:49] lost his revelation he ran off into the
[37:51] wilderness and and he's probably dead by
[37:53] now that same guy god sent back and
[37:55] everyone had to swallow their pride
[37:57] not only moses had us all his pride but
[37:59] the rest of israel had to swallow their
[38:00] pride and then to make it worse the
[38:02] first meeting moses had with with
[38:04] pharaoh caused everyone to have more
[38:07] work
[38:07] make bricks without straw
[38:09] this moses guy has me convinced
[38:15] no
[38:16] the flesh man would say this moses guy
[38:18] has done lost it he was at 40 years too
[38:20] long in the desert and now he's going to
[38:22] come back and tell me how to have church
[38:25] i'm an israelite
[38:27] he's what
[38:29] the the news is his parent wasn't hebrew
[38:31] but he was raised by egyptians
[38:34] you see the rest of israel had to lay
[38:35] down their pride so that god could use
[38:38] them because israel was coming to the
[38:40] time of a fulfillment of a promise
[38:43] they had an appointment with destiny and
[38:44] you can see the test of this generation
[38:47] in
[38:48] of israel when they come for the river
[38:50] jordan 10 out of the 12 spy says we
[38:52] can't do it in other words there was
[38:54] something in them
[38:56] that was crafted those years in bondage
[38:59] that they never found deliverance
[39:02] oh they were out of egypt they were in
[39:04] the desert they walked through the red
[39:06] sea they they walked through the
[39:08] revivals they walked through the camps
[39:10] they walked in the message for years and
[39:12] years but when it came time for adoption
[39:14] when it came time to make their move to
[39:16] step into their position they couldn't
[39:19] do it
[39:23] in the great shining light 1957 brother
[39:25] battle says but it gives us consolation
[39:27] to know this
[39:28] that we do not hold our destiny
[39:31] god holds our destiny and he has
[39:34] ordained it to be so
[39:36] there is nothing will ever interrupt the
[39:39] program of god even a man taking matters
[39:43] into his own hands and killing another
[39:45] person
[39:46] 40 years in the desert moses thought he
[39:49] had made a mistake and that was the end
[39:51] of it 40 years later god
[39:54] moved in him because you cannot corrupt
[39:56] the program of god
[39:59] we are bound he says he says if there is
[40:02] nothing will ever interrupt the program
[40:03] of god we are bound to arrive
[40:08] you just stop right there and preach a
[40:10] whole other message we are bound to
[40:12] arrive
[40:13] and don't steal that
[40:14] adoption number one election looks back
[40:17] to foreknowledge and predestination
[40:19] looks to destiny
[40:21] so election looks to foreknowledge
[40:23] predestin foreign knowledge looks to
[40:25] predestiny excuse me
[40:27] election looks to foreknowledge
[40:29] foreknowledge looks to predestination
[40:31] and predestination looks to destiny if
[40:33] you go back and you listen to this
[40:34] portion of the sermon that's what he
[40:36] says he says don't forget that that
[40:38] election looks back here here it is i
[40:40] was a cuckleberry i was born in sin
[40:42] shaped an iniquity come to the world
[40:44] speaking lies born agai among sinners
[40:47] father and mother and all my whole
[40:48] family sinners i was a cuckleber but all
[40:51] of a sudden i become a wheat grain what
[40:53] did how did it happen
[40:55] what is that election god before the
[40:58] foundation of the world elected that the
[41:01] cocoa border was to become a grain of
[41:03] wheat now i know i'm a grain of wheat
[41:05] because i'm saved how do i do it look
[41:08] back and see that he predestinated it
[41:11] long time ago by foreknowledge he seen
[41:13] that i would love him so he made a
[41:15] propitiation through his own son that
[41:18] through him i might become from a
[41:20] cocklebur to a grain of wheat
[41:23] now where am i at now i'm saved i'm
[41:25] walking in the grace of god
[41:27] what does predestination look to destiny
[41:30] where will he take me to it where am i
[41:32] going amen that's got you there you are
[41:35] now i i i i have a quite a few quotes
[41:38] here and i'll try to to cut them in
[41:41] and and cut the splice
[41:43] not in that way um
[41:45] that's just to stumble those make
[41:48] believers
[41:53] but you see we read this quote so the
[41:55] election looks to foreknowledge foreign
[41:57] looks to predestination and
[41:59] predestination looks to destiny
[42:02] we want to pick up we want to turn to to
[42:05] actually before we do that we'll read
[42:06] these these other quotes here in the
[42:08] first seal 1963
[42:10] now the lamb is standing
[42:13] now tonight as we enter into the sixth
[42:15] chapter he's got the book in his hand
[42:18] and standing to starting to reveal it
[42:20] and no i would have absolutely today had
[42:23] and and i hope that people are spiritual
[42:25] so he says think about he says be
[42:27] spiritual please
[42:28] he says i would have had a horrible
[42:30] mistake on that what's that he he goes
[42:33] before this and he explains what that is
[42:35] the seal the sixth seal on the preaching
[42:37] of the seals
[42:38] that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock
[42:40] today when the holy spirit came in the
[42:42] room and corrected me on something that
[42:44] i was writing down to say
[42:46] i was taking it from an old context i
[42:48] had nothing on it
[42:51] i don't know what the second seal is no
[42:53] more than nothing but i had got some old
[42:55] context of something that i had spoke on
[42:57] several years ago so he goes on to say
[42:58] without reading the rest of the quote
[43:00] that he had some some information some
[43:02] other things that you know other people
[43:04] had said of the men had said and he was
[43:06] like he said you know intellectually put
[43:08] it all together this is how i'm going to
[43:10] speak this seal and so on and so forth
[43:13] and um
[43:14] i'll try to slow down here for our
[43:15] brother alex
[43:16] um and and so he he had this this
[43:19] context and he and he was about to set
[43:21] things in order but then the whole the
[43:23] angel of the lord came down and set him
[43:26] straight
[43:31] you see
[43:32] it was brother branham like it was moses
[43:35] but then
[43:36] on holy ground
[43:39] at at the appointed time
[43:43] god came down into the room
[43:48] and he came under new ownership
[43:50] the word he was going to speak came
[43:53] under new ownership how can this be a
[43:56] message that we follow of a man
[44:00] it can't be
[44:04] so
[44:05] now
[44:06] that was just was just a little nugget
[44:08] in there
[44:09] so in in uh in the uh adoption number
[44:12] four if you haven't realized it by now
[44:14] i've been listening to the adoption
[44:17] series recommend it
[44:19] um seal what is a seal what is a seal a
[44:22] seal is first thing it shows
[44:25] is a work that has been completed amen a
[44:29] completed work
[44:30] the next thing it shows is ownership you
[44:33] know one of my one of my subtitles at
[44:36] first was was change of ownership
[44:39] but you can take this it started on it
[44:41] happened on holy ground
[44:44] as that transition
[44:46] where you go from what you were doing of
[44:49] your own strength
[44:51] and you take off your shoes of religion
[44:54] and you step on god's holy ground full
[44:57] contact with god
[44:59] and then now you come underneath a new
[45:02] ownership
[45:03] because then your thoughts are not your
[45:06] thoughts your desires are not your
[45:08] desires they are the desires that god
[45:10] has given you and placed within you but
[45:13] but the only way you can have this
[45:15] position
[45:17] is when you're in your position standing
[45:19] on holy ground
[45:21] now okay so the next thing it shows is
[45:23] ownership and the next thing it shows is
[45:25] security keeping it
[45:27] safe for instance i used to work for the
[45:29] pennsylvania railroad i used to work
[45:31] with my father on the railroad so he
[45:32] goes on to say they worked and and the
[45:34] inspector would come and and i like this
[45:36] part he says
[45:38] and but before that car was ever sealed
[45:40] the inspector come through there and he
[45:42] pushed on it he shoved on this one he
[45:44] shook that one i'll condemn it they'll
[45:46] break all the pieces before they get
[45:48] there condemn it take them out do it
[45:50] over the inspector condemned the car why
[45:52] because he put some pressure on it and
[45:54] it fell apart
[45:56] like god likes to put the pressure on
[45:58] you god put the pressure on abraham god
[46:00] put the pressure on the children of
[46:02] israel before they stepped over into
[46:04] their destiny they had an appointment to
[46:06] meet but you see before you can meet
[46:07] your appointment you have to be prepared
[46:11] god's going to do surgery on you before
[46:13] you go into the or the operating room
[46:15] you have to be prepared
[46:17] maybe you have to make sure you haven't
[46:19] consumed anything for 24 hours no
[46:21] liquids no solids so they can operate on
[46:23] you there's certain things that have to
[46:25] be done to prepare you for your
[46:27] appointment
[46:28] now you see so so so god comes along and
[46:31] people say oh you know i got the holy
[46:32] ghost and and everything's gonna be all
[46:35] good now or
[46:37] they come to church and they repent and
[46:39] they're baptized and they have yet to be
[46:41] sealed excuse me i jumped ahead there
[46:43] they're yet to be sealed and god begins
[46:45] to put the shake on them god begins to
[46:48] push them around
[46:49] they say well i thought god was a god of
[46:51] love you see people for people don't
[46:53] understand why is there a misconception
[46:56] or a misunderstanding of god's love
[46:59] because there's only two things we
[47:00] either have the the true or the
[47:03] perverted
[47:04] and what does the devil want to do he
[47:06] wants to pervert that divine love
[47:08] why because it is divine love that gives
[47:10] you revelation of christ in your life
[47:13] because god is love
[47:16] agape something that we're that
[47:18] perfection of love that we are striving
[47:21] for so so he comes along and he shakes
[47:23] and he pushes things around and and
[47:26] rattles things and if it rattles he says
[47:28] hey it's not ready to go yet
[47:30] and he says the holy ghost is the
[47:32] inspector he shake you a little bit and
[47:34] you rattle do you believe all the word
[47:36] of god i don't believe that old jesus
[47:37] name stuff condemn it you rattle i don't
[47:39] believe in divine healing or no such
[47:41] thing still rattle take them out so you
[47:43] see god begins to work and to push and
[47:46] to press on you
[47:47] and everything down forth but then
[47:50] once everything's packed good in good
[47:52] and tight full of the gospel oh every
[47:55] word of god is good everything is
[47:57] perfect i believe every word
[47:59] skip on down to paragraph 149 then the
[48:01] inspector closes the door what does he
[48:04] do he puts a seal on it then he gets
[48:06] down there and gets a hold of these
[48:08] little
[48:09] okay so he he puts a seal on it once
[48:11] he's done the rattling and the shaking
[48:13] god took moses now we know
[48:16] this was this is the old testament
[48:20] but it's god's word coming to life
[48:23] and so god took moses and he went ahead
[48:25] and put him through the back side of the
[48:27] desert you see moses took his action to
[48:30] took the what god was was calling him to
[48:32] do into his own hands and he began to
[48:35] begin to try to bring his destiny to
[48:37] pass
[48:38] he began to try to to to set things in
[48:40] order for himself he was doing it
[48:42] underneath the wrong anointing he had
[48:44] yet to have he had yet to meet christ on
[48:47] the backside of the desert he had yet to
[48:49] meet christ on mount sinai in the
[48:51] burning bush he needed to meet the i am
[48:53] he had not yet met him but then moses
[48:56] goes out and he runs off and he's in the
[48:58] wilderness for 40 years
[49:00] and then he still hasn't met him
[49:02] but 40 years later amen he steps aside
[49:05] and he and he meets
[49:07] christ but you see
[49:08] what i want to do is i'm kind of got off
[49:10] my topic there
[49:13] what i want to focus on tonight tonight
[49:15] is that is that moses in his mistake
[49:19] in his in his own thinking and what he
[49:22] was trying to do and how he he
[49:25] if you will messed it up
[49:27] did not break the plan of god
[49:30] he did not break the program
[49:32] moses had an appointment with destiny
[49:36] nothing on earth can keep you from that
[49:39] appointment
[49:40] not even yourself
[49:43] he was a baby in a basket on the river
[49:46] preserved
[49:48] by the enemy
[49:51] taken up by an egyptian woman
[49:53] you see god you say god sent him into
[49:56] the world
[49:57] yes
[49:59] for 40 years
[50:00] you could say 80
[50:03] because you didn't meet god until
[50:04] another 40 years later
[50:06] but you see
[50:08] we look at present
[50:10] circumstances and we try to come to a
[50:14] an end result
[50:16] by but we leave god out of the picture
[50:22] i i've god's been dealing with my heart
[50:24] and on this thing nothing can happen to
[50:28] you as long as you're living under the
[50:29] blood nothing can happen to you unless
[50:32] god says so
[50:34] and if god says so isn't that his
[50:36] perfect will
[50:38] i don't care what it is
[50:41] i don't care what what what circumstance
[50:44] or what's wrong
[50:46] you're not there
[50:48] outside of god's will
[50:51] it's god's perfect will he will not take
[50:54] you from this earth
[50:56] until he is done with you
[50:58] we were driving today and kind of took a
[51:01] little drive this morning we do it
[51:02] sometimes and and we we were going to
[51:05] pull off of indiana onto karcher and
[51:08] there was a car in front of us with the
[51:09] car behind it and as the car
[51:12] was going straight across karcher
[51:16] they go the car over here goes to turn
[51:18] and this
[51:20] dump truck
[51:21] loaded dump truck full speed which is
[51:23] about about 55 goes right through the
[51:25] stop sign
[51:26] eight feet from the front bumper of both
[51:28] the cars
[51:30] we almost witnessed the death
[51:34] and the guy was freaked out
[51:36] but you see even those people
[51:39] god wasn't done with them
[51:44] it doesn't matter what happens
[51:46] so and you know i i can say this because
[51:50] i uh a good friend of of mine who was a
[51:53] good friend of of charlie collins
[51:55] charlie and rachel collins the ones that
[51:56] passed away in the explosion
[51:58] he was it was his buddy
[52:01] and we spent some time with uh brother
[52:03] troy and his and his family and when we
[52:05] were in ohio we stayed with them for a
[52:07] few days and lovely family our kids just
[52:09] got along real great together we got
[52:10] along great together and he said he
[52:12] shared with me this that the day after
[52:14] the funeral brother danny steeman was
[52:17] ministering and he preached on job god
[52:19] giveth and god taketh away blessed be
[52:22] the name of the lord and you would think
[52:23] in your call of mine how dare he preach
[52:26] that
[52:28] but troy was there troy was a good
[52:29] friend it was a tragedy for him and he
[52:32] said it was one of the most powerful
[52:34] services he could have ever been in
[52:36] you see nothing happens to you there was
[52:39] two different people that were supposed
[52:40] to be there for that explosion that
[52:41] weren't a whole family and then
[52:43] charlie's brother seven minutes after
[52:45] his brother left that house exploded
[52:47] another family was supposed to be there
[52:48] they got held up by different
[52:50] circumstances they had to eat dinner and
[52:51] the brother got held up by the cop they
[52:53] got pulled over and the cop just
[52:54] happened to talk to him for 30 minutes
[52:56] and they should have been there
[52:58] you see god will not take you from the
[53:01] scene
[53:02] until you've had your opponent with
[53:04] destiny in other words god has a plan
[53:06] for you now i say that that's the
[53:07] extreme side of the situation life or
[53:09] death but no matter what you're
[53:10] struggling with no matter what addiction
[53:12] you're struggling with no matter what
[53:14] sickness you're struggling with god has
[53:16] an appointment with destiny for you and
[53:19] there is nothing you can do nor the
[53:21] devil to keep you from that appointment
[53:27] moses life was threatened after killing
[53:29] the egyptian but god preserved him by
[53:31] sending him into the desert
[53:36] moses thought he was running for his
[53:37] life because he'd made a mistake but god
[53:39] was guiding his footsteps because he had
[53:42] a wife to me on the other side of that
[53:43] desert in midian
[53:45] and the sun
[53:46] god wasn't on this side of the desert
[53:48] you see saying that god god god is on
[53:51] the other side of the desert
[53:53] god was on the other side of the desert
[53:54] for paul he spent three and a half years
[53:58] undoing god was undoing all the false
[54:00] doctrine he had been living underneath
[54:02] through the purging of the word paul
[54:04] didn't go hang out with peter for three
[54:06] and a half years and have seminary no
[54:08] paul onto the backside of the desert he
[54:10] went to the desert of arabia and he
[54:12] spent here and and and his revelation
[54:15] was on the other side of that desert
[54:17] you're in a desert right now let me tell
[54:19] you this by thus saith the lord that's
[54:21] the word of god that's not my my own
[54:23] thing god is on the other side of your
[54:24] desert no matter what it is you're going
[54:26] through i do not care the best thing
[54:28] that you i care
[54:30] okay the best thing that you can do
[54:33] instead of focusing on the desert and
[54:35] the sand and the lack of water the best
[54:37] thing that you can do is focus on christ
[54:40] because when you get to the other side
[54:41] of the desert you don't want to wander
[54:42] for another 40 years
[54:45] you see what happened they did their
[54:46] desert time
[54:49] the children of israel did their desert
[54:50] time but when they got to the end they
[54:52] didn't use that desert time to be
[54:54] prepared to meet christ so they wanted
[54:57] another 40 years
[54:59] but i'm gonna i'm gonna bring in a twist
[55:03] twist to that
[55:04] a little later
[55:10] but deliverance didn't come for the
[55:12] children of israel though it was a
[55:14] promise of the word
[55:17] it was a promise of the word that the
[55:19] children of israel would be delivered
[55:21] but it had to come at god's appointed
[55:24] time
[55:26] moses had an appointment the children of
[55:28] israel had an appointment
[55:30] nothing could break that it had to be at
[55:32] that 80-year mark of moses's life
[55:35] because god said
[55:36] god had a number of years
[55:40] and and we know that once once moses
[55:43] went back underneath the ownership once
[55:45] moses went back after he after he had
[55:49] had his experience on holy ground then
[55:51] god brought deliverance
[55:56] if we look in the book of joshua chapter
[55:58] 5
[56:00] we'll see here another example if you go
[56:02] and you look and you search in the bible
[56:05] and uh i i i depended upon just a bible
[56:09] application on my computer and i
[56:10] searched it there's only two times where
[56:12] it says take off your shoes you're
[56:14] standing on holy ground with joshua and
[56:16] moses
[56:17] joshua chapter 5. but you know what we
[56:19] can look through the word and see that
[56:21] the the the priest was had to walk into
[56:24] that holy ground a certain way so this
[56:27] isn't the only two scriptures but in the
[56:29] context of taking off your shoes and it
[56:30] was interesting if you think about moses
[56:33] had to take his shoes off to step in
[56:35] onto the holy ground to talk to
[56:37] christ
[56:39] and when john the baptist is baptizing
[56:41] jesus he says i am not worthy to
[56:43] unbuckle his shoes
[56:47] that one's just there for you to chew on
[56:51] mo uh joshua chapter 5 13. and it came
[56:54] to pass when joshua was joshua was by
[56:57] jericho now joshua and the children of
[56:58] israel are eating the old corn of the
[57:00] land manna has ceased to fall from
[57:02] heaven and now they're eating the
[57:04] sustenance of the promise
[57:06] see manna was a
[57:08] a manna was food to get them to the
[57:11] promise
[57:13] manna was the temporary food but it was
[57:16] not the food of the promise it was a
[57:18] shadow but once they crossed into the
[57:20] new land they began to eat the old corn
[57:21] in other words the word restored we know
[57:24] that today we're in the old corner
[57:25] because it's the word of god restored
[57:27] back
[57:28] and it came to pass when joshua was by
[57:30] jericho that he lifted up his eyes and
[57:32] looked and behold there stood a man over
[57:34] against him with his sword so now joshua
[57:37] for some reason i always picture it this
[57:39] way the children of israel are back at
[57:41] camp rejoicing enjoying the delicious
[57:44] food
[57:46] i heard tell manna wasn't very good
[57:47] tasting it was it provided sustenance
[57:50] but
[57:50] uh the open word just it just gives you
[57:53] a lot more
[57:54] and uh so
[57:56] you know they're out there rejoicing
[57:57] having a big old feast and i i just
[57:59] always picture it this way so this is
[58:01] this is completely my opinion and joshua
[58:04] kind of walks away from the party and he
[58:06] he goes down walks a mile or two down
[58:09] down to look over at jericho
[58:12] the quiet of the evening and night that
[58:14] night and he and he's looking and he's
[58:16] thinking lord i don't know what we're
[58:18] going to do we're in the land of promise
[58:20] this is the first obstacle but as yet
[58:22] all joshua knew was god said i will give
[58:24] you the land but god hadn't said how
[58:28] joshua's a man of war he wants a plan
[58:30] he needs a plan laid out a plan of
[58:32] attack how many soldiers are going to go
[58:34] here how many what artillery are we
[58:36] going to use are we going to sneak
[58:38] attack are we going to are we going to
[58:39] do a siege what are we going to do to
[58:41] take on jericho so joshua is standing
[58:43] there formulating his a plan and his
[58:46] mind but you see before he can even come
[58:48] even come to a decision on how to attack
[58:51] he looks up and he sees this man
[58:54] over against him with his sword drawn in
[58:56] his hand
[58:57] and joshua went unto him and said unto
[58:59] him art thou for us or for our
[59:02] adversaries
[59:03] and he said nay but as captain of the
[59:05] host of the lord am i now come and
[59:08] joshua fell on his face excuse me face
[59:11] to the earth and did worship and said
[59:13] unto him what saith my lord unto his
[59:15] servant
[59:17] and the captain of the lord's host said
[59:18] unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy
[59:22] foot
[59:22] for the place were on thou standest is
[59:24] holy and joshua did so
[59:28] joshua says what's the plan lord the
[59:29] lord says hang on a second take off your
[59:31] shoes
[59:34] we get in a hurry
[59:38] god's on a hurry
[59:41] he knows everything
[59:45] and if you're going to read and then he
[59:47] tell he gives him specific instructions
[59:49] on how to take
[59:51] jericho
[59:52] but you see joshua was standing on holy
[59:54] ground joshua had an appointment with
[59:56] destiny
[59:57] and it happened on holy ground
[1:00:03] now in this in the same context of this
[1:00:06] of the scripture of the story of jericho
[1:00:09] there we bring up another character
[1:00:11] and i bring this character up often but
[1:00:13] you see i was thinking about it the word
[1:00:14] of god is alive
[1:00:18] and and every time you look at it
[1:00:20] through the lens of a situation through
[1:00:22] the lens of an of a different anointing
[1:00:24] all the same all the anointing of christ
[1:00:26] but a different situation circumstances
[1:00:28] that you're looking in a thought that
[1:00:30] you have in your heart you see things a
[1:00:32] little bit differently and but it's all
[1:00:34] the same true word of god
[1:00:37] so we have the character rahab
[1:00:39] now we want to talk about the children
[1:00:41] of israel we say oh they they wandered
[1:00:42] in the desert for 40 years and they made
[1:00:44] a mistake and they did
[1:00:46] they didn't take the word of god bc but
[1:00:47] everything that god does he has a
[1:00:50] program and everything is going
[1:00:51] according to his program the fall in the
[1:00:54] garden of eden was according to his
[1:00:56] program
[1:00:59] god doesn't lose time
[1:01:02] for one he can he's eternal
[1:01:04] but god doesn't go oops i have to put
[1:01:06] things on pause no no god's program is
[1:01:10] perfect
[1:01:12] now
[1:01:13] i want to read this in in um
[1:01:16] the story of rahab sometimes you'll find
[1:01:18] a quote and it's and it's maybe a few
[1:01:21] paragraphs long but brother branham had
[1:01:22] a way of telling a story
[1:01:24] and this is in um why little bethlehem
[1:01:28] and and we find out that
[1:01:30] it was also also became the home of the
[1:01:32] harlot rahab talking about bethlehem
[1:01:34] when israel had passed over the
[1:01:36] borderline of the jordan river into
[1:01:38] palestine we are acquainted with the
[1:01:40] story of rahab the harlot let's picture
[1:01:42] her this morning for a few minutes now
[1:01:44] as a young lady
[1:01:46] a beautiful young woman now here's where
[1:01:48] i'm going to take liberty
[1:01:50] a beautiful young woman let me ask you
[1:01:52] 40 years ago
[1:01:54] was rahab in position for her
[1:01:56] appointment with destiny
[1:01:59] no
[1:02:00] so when the children of israel came to
[1:02:02] the river jordan to cross over now you
[1:02:04] think you messed up your life i'm going
[1:02:05] to tell you something when they came up
[1:02:07] to the river jordan to cross over god
[1:02:09] said no no no rahab's not ready
[1:02:13] you see what god does god's program is
[1:02:15] perfect
[1:02:17] you say oh the children made a mistake
[1:02:19] and they did everyone
[1:02:21] answers for the decision that they make
[1:02:24] but rahab wasn't ready for her
[1:02:26] appointment with destiny but says a
[1:02:28] young a beautiful woman who's whose some
[1:02:31] misfortune in life had been forced in
[1:02:33] being a pagan had been forced into the
[1:02:35] life that she was living yes
[1:02:38] she was forced
[1:02:39] by god's program
[1:02:41] because god said i want a gentile a
[1:02:43] woman
[1:02:44] and i want her to be a harlot
[1:02:46] so no one has any questions in their
[1:02:48] mind of how far
[1:02:50] can i go to save
[1:02:52] somebody that i have called
[1:02:55] the day and age that we live in we have
[1:02:56] a lot of harlots
[1:02:59] there's
[1:03:00] it's just something unfortunately kids
[1:03:02] do
[1:03:03] in high school and younger sometimes
[1:03:06] in the world that we're living in but
[1:03:08] god said look i can take this and make
[1:03:11] her my bride
[1:03:14] showing the power of the blood of christ
[1:03:17] you see rahab was not ready for her
[1:03:19] appointment with destiny now i was
[1:03:22] listening to adoption number two and
[1:03:23] brotherhood said this and i just i
[1:03:25] rejoiced
[1:03:26] because i began to realize because i
[1:03:28] always stumbled at the scripture god
[1:03:31] god jacob have i love esau have i hated
[1:03:34] and i thought well esau never even got a
[1:03:36] chance
[1:03:37] but in this quote god revealed this to
[1:03:39] me he says and now i want to stop on
[1:03:41] that word of predestination
[1:03:43] now predestinated isn't say i'll choose
[1:03:46] brother neville and i won't choose
[1:03:48] brother bueller that isn't it
[1:03:50] it's the foreknowledge of god that
[1:03:52] knowed which one would be right and
[1:03:55] which one wasn't right in other words
[1:03:57] god knew
[1:04:00] esau would not choose
[1:04:03] the birthright
[1:04:05] esau didn't choose the birth
[1:04:07] let me lord help me say this now esau
[1:04:10] didn't not
[1:04:11] did not choose the birthright
[1:04:17] praise the lord
[1:04:20] esau did not choose the birthright
[1:04:22] because god said esau i hated
[1:04:24] esau choose the birth didn't choose the
[1:04:26] birthright because he didn't want it and
[1:04:29] god saw that when god was predestination
[1:04:32] predestinating
[1:04:34] there was a time in heaven where god
[1:04:36] laid out the books and began to write
[1:04:38] down the names and when he got to esau
[1:04:41] he looked ahead and he said no he won't
[1:04:42] he won't even choose the birthright
[1:04:45] so he was given a chance
[1:04:47] but god saw he won't choose it
[1:04:51] so he wasn't predestinated so it wasn't
[1:04:53] that god said
[1:04:55] i think we got that so by foreign
[1:04:57] knowledge god knowing what he was going
[1:04:59] to do he predestinated by his
[1:05:01] foreknowledge to make all things work
[1:05:03] together for the good to them that love
[1:05:05] god that he might in the age that is to
[1:05:07] come call all things together in one
[1:05:09] which is christ jesus remember election
[1:05:12] looks to foreknowledge foreign knowledge
[1:05:14] looks to predestination predestination
[1:05:16] looks to destiny jacob had an
[1:05:19] appointment with destiny do you realize
[1:05:20] you can take this idea this thought down
[1:05:23] through every person in the bible down
[1:05:25] through every person in history amen
[1:05:27] everyone has an appointment with destiny
[1:05:29] and the world wants to take destiny and
[1:05:31] they want to construe it all around and
[1:05:33] say oh just live any old life you want
[1:05:35] well
[1:05:37] that's a perversion
[1:05:39] of what is the truth
[1:05:43] so rahab was a young woman
[1:05:46] a young lady
[1:05:47] and it was it was time for her
[1:05:49] appointment with destiny and many times
[1:05:51] people are forced into the life that
[1:05:53] they live now i'm back in the rahab
[1:05:54] quote paragraph 50. i was in the prisons
[1:05:57] the other night to see a man who was
[1:05:58] taking a sentence so he talked about a
[1:06:00] man kind of forced into it by drinking
[1:06:02] different things uh 51 and this young
[1:06:05] woman after she had got her first
[1:06:07] hearing of israel
[1:06:09] of a god who was a god that answered
[1:06:11] prayer
[1:06:12] not only a god to pray to but a god that
[1:06:14] answered back you see free moral agency
[1:06:16] god knew when rahab heard the words of
[1:06:19] israel she would believe
[1:06:20] so he predestinated her
[1:06:23] and he set an appointment in the books
[1:06:24] of time that rahab would come to meet
[1:06:27] her destiny on holy ground he said holy
[1:06:30] grail excuse me she was uh the the the
[1:06:33] the spies were in the house of a harlot
[1:06:36] how can that be holy ground wherever you
[1:06:38] go as a child of god
[1:06:40] you are on holy ground
[1:06:43] now
[1:06:44] unless you walk out from underneath the
[1:06:45] blood and go into a bar
[1:06:48] but you
[1:06:49] have possession of the atmosphere around
[1:06:52] you when you are harnessed to the will
[1:06:54] of christ
[1:06:56] it was that atmosphere set in place that
[1:06:58] rahab experienced and and and so it goes
[1:07:01] on to say here he says
[1:07:04] but a god not only a god to pray to but
[1:07:06] a god that answered back she was looking
[1:07:08] for a god that answered back not not an
[1:07:11] idol where it just sits there
[1:07:12] dumb when she heard that there was a god
[1:07:15] of miracles who could perform miracles
[1:07:17] who dried up the seas and rained bread
[1:07:19] out of the heavens her heart began to
[1:07:21] tremble not in not not in the tremble of
[1:07:24] i'm afraid for my life but in a fear
[1:07:26] that this is god see the rest of the
[1:07:29] world was looking for a way to escape
[1:07:31] israel but rehab was looking for a way
[1:07:33] to get into israel
[1:07:35] and her heart began to triple and she
[1:07:37] got the first message from two preachers
[1:07:39] that went over there quickly she
[1:07:40] accepted it with all her heart
[1:07:43] that debunks the tape thing and there
[1:07:45] was a scarlet cord
[1:07:47] abound at her window for a protection of
[1:07:49] her house because that she had received
[1:07:52] the message where do you think she got
[1:07:54] that scarlet material and what do you
[1:07:55] think it was used for
[1:07:57] god will take the the the addiction in
[1:08:00] your life the the struggle in your life
[1:08:02] and brother man says well take that and
[1:08:03] turn it into your testimony for others
[1:08:06] to experience
[1:08:08] so god took her bondage
[1:08:11] and used that to represent his token
[1:08:14] the power of god to deliver
[1:08:17] amen praise the lord and so
[1:08:19] uh that and so he says and i might add
[1:08:22] here
[1:08:23] did you know that she typed the gentile
[1:08:25] church she was a gentile she was a type
[1:08:27] of the gentile church when they heard
[1:08:29] the message we were all out in spiritual
[1:08:31] prostitution committing spiritual
[1:08:33] fornications against the god of heaven
[1:08:35] and all kinds of stuff all kinds of
[1:08:37] denominations and religions you see
[1:08:40] another thing another reason rahab had
[1:08:42] to be a harlot was because god's showing
[1:08:44] that today he would call people out of
[1:08:46] denomination
[1:08:48] call people out of the daughter of the
[1:08:50] of the daughters of the
[1:08:52] that committing spiritual fornication
[1:08:55] and make them virgins
[1:08:57] we were all out in spiritual
[1:08:58] prostitution committing spiritual
[1:09:00] fornications against the god of heaven
[1:09:01] and all kinds of stuff all kinds of
[1:09:03] denominations and religions but when we
[1:09:05] heard that there was a god that still
[1:09:07] lived that could perform miracles
[1:09:09] quickly we received the message
[1:09:12] there was there was applied the blood of
[1:09:14] the lord jesus which made the scarlet
[1:09:16] cord and to keep from going into detail
[1:09:18] you know how she hung it from her window
[1:09:20] publicly the blood was displayed
[1:09:23] publicly that's the way the blood has
[1:09:24] got to be displayed
[1:09:28] hanging on the outside to show there's
[1:09:30] something taking place inside
[1:09:33] amen
[1:09:41] praise the lord
[1:09:44] and paragraph 55 and then when she and
[1:09:47] then we see her when she was taken in as
[1:09:49] one of the israelites she fell in love
[1:09:51] with the man who was a captain and a
[1:09:53] prince of judah he was the captain of
[1:09:55] the israelite armies his name was salmon
[1:09:57] and we know the rest of the story there
[1:09:59] that god took her and and and and and
[1:10:03] gave her to the prince which with
[1:10:05] brother brown says
[1:10:07] well anyways
[1:10:09] uh
[1:10:10] you can go you can go listen to that
[1:10:11] tape while bethlehem
[1:10:13] so rahab had an appointment with destiny
[1:10:15] just just to back up and just go over
[1:10:17] this again real quick so when the
[1:10:18] children of israel got to the river
[1:10:19] jordan rahab was not ready so now what
[1:10:21] can god do in history
[1:10:24] what can god do with time
[1:10:26] what can god do with your life to make
[1:10:28] sure you're ready for your appointment
[1:10:32] now we can have multiple appointments
[1:10:34] yes
[1:10:36] it doesn't stop until we graduate into
[1:10:38] glory
[1:10:40] we have appointments after appointments
[1:10:42] you wrestle with something maybe you
[1:10:44] need revelation of a scripture or or
[1:10:46] something in the message you don't quite
[1:10:47] see
[1:10:48] i'm telling you tonight and i'm telling
[1:10:50] to myself there's an appointment with
[1:10:51] destiny
[1:10:52] there's a time when god will say you'll
[1:10:54] turn to the to the to open your book and
[1:10:57] you'll open psalms 23
[1:10:59] and you'll read verse 4 and you'll
[1:11:00] understand revelations
[1:11:02] whatever 18 2.
[1:11:04] i don't know if those are connected i'm
[1:11:06] just making this up
[1:11:08] right well they are connected because
[1:11:09] it's all over god
[1:11:11] you see it doesn't matter god god god
[1:11:13] god's not worried about the material
[1:11:15] things we say oh we need this in place
[1:11:18] it has to be done this way
[1:11:20] god that's not god's not worried about
[1:11:22] that god's not worried about that it's
[1:11:24] wednesday night
[1:11:25] it's his word
[1:11:27] and his word brings life
[1:11:34] christ knew
[1:11:36] that rahab would accept his invitation
[1:11:41] as a child of god with his seed within
[1:11:43] you there is nothing you can do to stop
[1:11:45] your appointment
[1:11:47] that could be your appointment to
[1:11:48] receive the holy spirit
[1:11:50] and become
[1:11:51] into the kingdom of god i could you be
[1:11:54] your appointment of healing
[1:11:56] it could be your appointment of
[1:11:57] deliverance it could be your appointment
[1:11:59] of of revelation of the god's word a
[1:12:02] revelation of a scripture it could be
[1:12:04] anything but there's nothing that can
[1:12:06] keep you from that not this is what i
[1:12:07] really want to drive home tonight is not
[1:12:09] even you
[1:12:11] can stop the program of god
[1:12:13] stop the program of god in your life you
[1:12:15] can't do it
[1:12:18] no matter how many times you stumble and
[1:12:19] you fall as long as you're a child of
[1:12:21] god which i believe every one of you is
[1:12:24] you can do nothing to stop it
[1:12:26] you can't look at your present
[1:12:27] circumstances and say no i've done
[1:12:29] messed it all up i've tried it and over
[1:12:32] and over and over again and this thing
[1:12:34] and the other and you well maybe you
[1:12:35] gotta no i'm not gonna say that you
[1:12:37] can't stop it
[1:12:39] god has an appointment and god always
[1:12:41] keeps his appointments
[1:12:43] your day is coming how long did gideon
[1:12:46] hold out within his bondage before his
[1:12:48] appointment with destiny
[1:12:50] how long did gideon hide behind the wine
[1:12:52] press and and to thresh the wheat and to
[1:12:56] provide food to eat how long did he sit
[1:12:58] there and do that before his appointment
[1:13:00] with destiny
[1:13:01] but you see gideon was there when the
[1:13:04] appointment came
[1:13:05] gideon a mighty man of valor who was
[1:13:07] living in a state of weakness
[1:13:11] still in his if you want to say mistake
[1:13:14] by hiding he met his appointment right
[1:13:17] on time
[1:13:22] how long did shamgar beat himself down
[1:13:25] for being weak in faith
[1:13:27] before his appointment with destiny
[1:13:30] how many seasons passed where shamgar
[1:13:32] said i should have done something i'm an
[1:13:34] israelite why didn't i do something why
[1:13:36] didn't i take up and defend my family i
[1:13:38] love them i would i would give my life
[1:13:40] for them
[1:13:41] why did i not do anything shamgar
[1:13:44] beating himself down saying he's weak in
[1:13:45] faith
[1:13:46] how long did that happen before
[1:13:49] shamgar's appointment with destiny and
[1:13:51] do you read about that time no
[1:13:53] yeah
[1:13:55] in the annals of history in the book of
[1:13:57] god's history
[1:13:59] you know what you're going to read at
[1:14:00] the end of time you're not going to read
[1:14:02] how you fell
[1:14:03] you're not going to read how you messed
[1:14:05] up you're going to read and shamgar by
[1:14:07] faith to canoxico
[1:14:09] sean by faith took an oxco
[1:14:12] brother david by faith took an ox kill
[1:14:14] that's all you're going to read because
[1:14:16] the rest has been wiped out by the blood
[1:14:18] of jesus christ
[1:14:21] did samson fail his calling
[1:14:26] go ahead
[1:14:30] no he didn't
[1:14:32] he was called to give his life between
[1:14:35] those pillars
[1:14:36] in doing so slew more in his death than
[1:14:39] he did in his entire life
[1:14:42] samson had an appointment with destiny
[1:14:44] and the only way to get there was to
[1:14:46] fall in the lap of delilah have his eyes
[1:14:48] pulled out from him set in the chains of
[1:14:51] bondage of the enemy and then brought up
[1:14:53] to sport for the enemy
[1:14:56] then he was ready for his appointment
[1:14:58] with destiny
[1:15:00] saints of god you cannot do anything
[1:15:02] to miss that appointment
[1:15:07] christ sees a desire in your heart he
[1:15:09] testifies you look at somebody from the
[1:15:12] outside
[1:15:13] and you say how can they be so callous
[1:15:16] you do not know what's going on inside
[1:15:18] their heart
[1:15:19] and you do not know
[1:15:21] when their appointment with destiny is
[1:15:23] going to happen
[1:15:25] the only thing you know is that it will
[1:15:28] happen on holy ground
[1:15:30] that's all you know so why don't you
[1:15:33] condition yourself to be ready to
[1:15:35] receive them when they walk out of the
[1:15:37] cave having talked face to face with the
[1:15:39] burning bush
[1:15:41] that's what we need to be god's dealing
[1:15:43] with harder situation and i begin to
[1:15:45] think we need to be prepared for when
[1:15:47] god brings them into deliverance because
[1:15:50] how dare we face their deliverance and
[1:15:52] have to swallow our anger
[1:15:55] we want to be ready to say we know what
[1:15:57] was coming praise god
[1:15:59] we want to be in a position of
[1:16:00] forgiveness before they're even worthy
[1:16:03] of it
[1:16:04] because they have an appointment with
[1:16:06] destiny and your bitterness
[1:16:08] cannot keep you from that i heard a
[1:16:10] story this could have been from our
[1:16:11] pastor
[1:16:13] there was a man and a woman in a message
[1:16:15] church
[1:16:16] they married i don't know if they had
[1:16:18] kids i'm not quite sure i don't think
[1:16:19] they did and she turned her back on the
[1:16:21] message and she left her husband
[1:16:23] and he prayed for years that she would
[1:16:25] come back and she he believed she would
[1:16:27] come back well she goes out into the
[1:16:28] world and she marries a worldly man
[1:16:31] sometime goes by they get a couch from
[1:16:34] her parents who are message believers
[1:16:35] and her worldly husband who's never
[1:16:37] heard of the message he lays down on the
[1:16:39] couch one afternoon to take a nap and
[1:16:41] sticks his arm in between the cushions
[1:16:42] and pulls out a sermon
[1:16:46] you talk about an appointment with
[1:16:47] destiny
[1:16:49] and he starts to read that and then he
[1:16:51] asks his wife well what is this
[1:16:54] and says oh you don't know part of that
[1:16:56] and he says no i want more of these so
[1:16:58] he gets more books from her parents and
[1:16:59] he reads it
[1:17:01] long story short they both end up back
[1:17:03] in the same church she left
[1:17:06] sanctified and filled with the holy
[1:17:07] spirit serving god and there's that man
[1:17:10] her own her first husband sitting there
[1:17:12] and he takes them to the office and he
[1:17:14] tells the pastor you need to command
[1:17:15] them to separate because i prayed for my
[1:17:18] wife she's back and she's living in
[1:17:20] adultery
[1:17:21] and the pastor you know i believe on the
[1:17:23] anointing of the spirit of god in wisdom
[1:17:25] says
[1:17:26] but two wrongs don't make it right
[1:17:29] something to that effect
[1:17:30] and that man standing before his
[1:17:33] answered prayer storms out of the church
[1:17:37] i don't know where he is today i don't
[1:17:38] know the rest of the story but i do know
[1:17:39] that that couple is still serving god
[1:17:42] so what is it what why did i tell that
[1:17:44] story
[1:17:45] because god sometimes answers our prayer
[1:17:47] differently
[1:17:49] than we think he should
[1:17:51] but we want to be prepared in our hearts
[1:17:54] to receive it regardless of how it might
[1:17:57] be different than we thought it would be
[1:17:59] amen but in in that in doing that you
[1:18:02] can't mess it up still
[1:18:04] because if you are destined to receive
[1:18:07] that you will
[1:18:09] amen but i don't want to i don't want to
[1:18:10] i you know i just felt checked there i
[1:18:12] don't wanna take i don't wanna take any
[1:18:13] of your responsibility away because you
[1:18:15] have responsibility yeah it was rehab
[1:18:17] had to put that cord out the window yes
[1:18:22] you have a responsibility
[1:18:24] to turn your back on sin you have your
[1:18:27] responsibility to stand and do what god
[1:18:29] calls you to do to rid yourself of that
[1:18:31] sin
[1:18:34] so take your shoes of pride off
[1:18:38] no matter how fancy they are
[1:18:43] gucci don't save you
[1:18:55] the key is to keep standing on holy
[1:18:57] ground
[1:18:59] living under the blood
[1:19:02] standing in god's presence
[1:19:04] doesn't have to be in church
[1:19:06] it's just when you are keeping yourself
[1:19:08] sanctified and lined up with the word of
[1:19:11] god and in fellowship with christ
[1:19:14] you keep standing there
[1:19:16] and now you say well i'm standing
[1:19:18] here but i'm in the midst of the fiery
[1:19:21] furnace
[1:19:23] the world is burning down
[1:19:25] all around me
[1:19:29] excuse me show us the father and it
[1:19:31] suffices our picture looks pretty dark
[1:19:33] right now for believers doesn't it let's
[1:19:35] just turn our camera or our binoculars
[1:19:37] and look up you know all the time
[1:19:38] there's something going on on earth
[1:19:40] there's something going on in heaven i

[1:20:36] conversation

[1:24:30] man standing by their side
[1:24:33] with a palm fanning away
[1:24:36] even with hot breezes down talking with
[1:24:38] them
[1:24:39] fellowshipping with them saying you see
[1:24:42] what god does after a great battle he
[1:24:44] begins to have fellowship
[1:24:46] abraham faced the kings and he fought a
[1:24:48] great battle and he turned aside the
[1:24:50] desire and the lust for the spoils of of
[1:24:53] that battle and he walked back into the
[1:24:55] desert and then he had fellowship with
[1:24:58] god
[1:25:00] god gives you a great battle so kingdom
[1:25:02] he can open the doors he says how many
[1:25:04] did you put in said three there's four
[1:25:07] one looks like the son of god all
[1:25:09] creation will testify
[1:25:12] every knee will bow nebuchadnezzar in
[1:25:15] his state of hedonism stood and
[1:25:18] testified that is the son of god as
[1:25:21] christ died on the cross that that
[1:25:23] centurion looked up and said this is the
[1:25:25] son of god
[1:25:28] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:25:29] forever his powers cannot fail he cannot
[1:25:32] god is in his son yes he believed that
[1:25:35] god is in his people

[1:25:47] is here tonight no matter what it is
[1:25:49] you're facing no matter if you're
[1:25:50] walking in the fiery furnace if the door
[1:25:52] is creaking open and the men around you
[1:25:54] have died from the heat and you're
[1:25:56] stepping in don't worry god's coming
[1:25:59] down into babylon
[1:26:01] he's taking the molecules god can bend
[1:26:03] atoms to his will
[1:26:06] because he created them everything was
[1:26:08] designed with one no matter what it was
[1:26:11] that god created the human body the
[1:26:13] elements of the atmosphere no matter
[1:26:15] what it was he created that everything
[1:26:17] has one baseline

[1:26:58] for the kingdom of god with that stuff
[1:27:01] he got into his own head
[1:27:04] and he took the spoils of babylon
[1:27:07] excuse me the spoils of jericho
[1:27:10] which is also
[1:27:11] let me know

[1:27:51] victory

[1:27:54] bills

[1:27:58] something is presented god allows the
[1:28:01] devil to tempt you
[1:28:02] something is presented
[1:28:05] don't be aching

[1:28:20] a testimony what happens when you stand
[1:28:23] on holy ground and god keeps his
[1:28:25] appointment and you meet your

[1:30:16] regardless of what it is regardless of
[1:30:18] how lofty it might seem we're the ones
[1:30:20] who put limits on god
[1:30:23] god is a limitless god but we in our
[1:30:26] finite in our flesh we put a cap on god
[1:30:30] but we have no authority to do so
[1:30:34] god can't god's program cannot be
[1:30:38] hindered

[1:30:41] heavenly father lord jesus
[1:30:43] i pray tonight lord that you would
[1:30:45] energize the faith of your people
[1:30:48] perhaps they've come through an episode
[1:30:50] with aiken a battle with a religious
[1:30:53] spirit
[1:30:55] they faced false doctrine
[1:30:57] toe-to-toe
[1:30:59] they're weak in body but god may you
[1:31:02] give them strength to fight against ai
[1:31:06] lord and may they look past the present
[1:31:09] circumstances look past the walls of the
[1:31:11] city and look to all the promises that
[1:31:14] you have in store for them
[1:31:17] god we know that none of this can be
[1:31:18] attained except that we stand on holy
[1:31:21] ground
[1:31:23] our appointment happens on holy ground
[1:31:26] lord i am i thank you for your word i
[1:31:29] thank you lord jesus

[1:31:44] we have sicknesses in our body
[1:31:46] spirits of aiken trying to infiltrate
[1:31:49] the rings
[1:31:50] but god
[1:31:51] we serve you and we know your spirit is
[1:31:54] more powerful
[1:31:56] than anything the devil can conjure up
[1:32:00] the father feeling anointed to do so
[1:32:03] i claim our victory over that spirit of
[1:32:06] religion
[1:32:08] we are not called to live underneath a
[1:32:10] man's idea we are called to live
[1:32:13] underneath the anointing and the
[1:32:15] revelation of who you are to us
[1:32:17] so in the name of jesus christ i call
[1:32:20] for deliverance lord
[1:32:22] that that spirit would not come inside
[1:32:24] this church lord a spirit would not
[1:32:26] infiltrate the hearts of the people here
[1:32:28] tonight but we would find true freedom
[1:32:31] in your word
[1:32:32] father we cannot find freedom and we
[1:32:35] cannot find deliverance we cannot find
[1:32:37] these things outside of your word
[1:32:41] and lord
[1:32:42] aiken is outside of your word
[1:32:46] father i didn't expect it to turn this
[1:32:48] direction
[1:32:49] but god
[1:32:51] i pray lord jesus that you would just
[1:32:53] bring that touch father
[1:32:55] lord if
[1:32:57] no matter where it comes the devil will
[1:33:00] try to sneak in the corner and come in
[1:33:02] the crack and hide it underneath the
[1:33:03] ground
[1:33:04] may you just expose him 100 percent
[1:33:09] father that we as a people we as the
[1:33:11] people of grace tabernacle could stand
[1:33:14] under the word
[1:33:15] and maintain
[1:33:18] our position
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:23] and in doing so lord maintain our
[1:33:25] freedom not by our own works although

[1:33:30] spirit
[1:33:31] we're the spirit of the lord
[1:33:33] there is freedom may there be so much
[1:33:36] spirit of god in our hearts if there'd
[1:33:38] be so much anointing in this church that
[1:33:41] that religious spirit could find no room
[1:33:43] to sit down
