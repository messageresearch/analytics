doubt praise his name praise His name he's in the house we were like that little girl dead in all our sins Jesus heart of mine and gave me life again I am just a house of clay ever since that blessed

Jesus Lord the words arise all we as your bride father have heard the words arise and we obeyed and we say thank you tonight Lord Jesus for the words that have changed our life changed everything in our world Lord Jesus or once it was Darkness there's now light where there was death there's now life oh Lord we thank you tonight we bless your Holy Name we ask for your your mercy your kindness Lord upon us tonight speak to our hearts I pray in the name of Jesus Amen Hallelujah good to see our brother David Nash amen glad you're back again amen each and every one of you tonight amen I think this is a wonderful time tonight I'm already excited I uh speaking on our journey uh you know sometimes you have a hard time uh putting a title to things and uh taking from what the prophet had said I had titled this tonight a true expression of faith and then as brother Trevor was just speaking there and he spoke out the word interrupt just struck me that maybe was a title that should have been interrupted on the road amen Hallelujah let's turn to mark five you know the Book of Mark thank you musicians is wonderful Amen brother Alex amen the fifth chapter of Mark is such a power pack it's such just got so much in it that I think uh sometimes maybe Overlook it a lot of stories as it were if you want to use those words but we're going to just go to the 22nd verse and we're going to talk about gyrus for a few minutes uh this evening by God's grace amen Mark 5 22. and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live that is a strong statement of faith amen and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him Heavenly Father we just ask you to come and help us father as we just go through your scripture your word tonight let it speak to our hearts we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated we see here that Jesus as Jairus comes to him we recognize that there was something that compelled Jairus now my brother and sister you'd say well it was maybe the sickness or illness incurable that his daughter had but my brother and sister there's many people on the Earth today who's had family members even children that were to the point of death that never sought the face of God so we recognize that there was something even greater that was moving Jairus and it even caused Jairus to come to a place that he he had to move against even the tenets of his own church of his own teaching but there was a desire there was something down in his soul and so he speaks to Jesus these very positive words and declares that if you'll just come and you lay the hands he isn't even asking for prayer just lay your hands on her and she will be healed and will live and and so Jesus is moved by this and I believe this was just a Divine appointment that was a a place you might say in time that God Blocked out to even come into the religious world and to reach out to one in that world and and and still something in them to just show my brother and sister as we were speaking on Sunday the Great and the small uh or the small and the greatest how the scripture placed it you see God is going to reach now the intellectual as the scripture says is is going to have a hard time seeing the Revelation and they they look into it so deep they actually look past the very move of God but it's there that God is going to call those men of great intelligence of great positions for the small and the great amen and so it's there that as Jairus starts and he's going down the road now towards as Jesus starts down the road to jairus's house you know sometimes my brother and sister we have to recognize distractions are part of God's plan we sometimes think oh I was started in a certain way and got distracted but you know sometimes distractions are are in God's plan amen but we need to know the difference amen because Satan's distraction turns our Focus away God's distraction just puts things in God's time amen sometimes we get ahead of God's plan a little bit and God allows us to be distracted a little bit my brother and sister look at how it was brother branham's there the plane is grounded the Holy Spirit starts to deal with him he goes and now the holy spirit's telling him turn here walk down this street and here's Aunt Jemima leaning on the gate post with the Dew upon her now you might say well brother Branham had places to go he had things to do you know this plane being grounded for the moment was a distraction was it or was it just part of God's plan to put brother Branham at the sidewalk at Aunt Jemima's house amen and to see years later a young man as a bell there in the railroad station to say you know what that was a time and thank you I gave my heart to God and life is good and so we can sometimes get so caught up in the moment of time to not really see the leadership that God is bringing and so you know as we'll look now into going back to the scripture verse 25 and going down we're we're going to leave this for another time but you'll see 25 through 34 is a story of the woman with a blood issue and and we're not going to touch on that other than to say here was another or a distraction amen that come and and I didn't State the first one and the first one is the scripture says that the crowds were thronging Jesus and so there was this distraction of all of this going on all these things around him and there was that distraction yet the door was open for Jairus to come and pour out his heart to our lord Jesus and it's there as he starts to gyrus's house we see the woman the sister we we would type it I guess that has a blood issue and then this becomes as a another you might say distraction but is there anyone coming to be touched by our God a distraction amen my brother and sister it never is God's plan is perfect he places each one of us you and I in the right place at the right time amen you know you read stories so Through the Ages and and you kind of Wonder are stories like there was a time of an altar call in a church an on message church but an altar calling a church and there was a young man in a great struggle of life and and he was struggling when you when you share that brother Trevor it it touches on me to this story and here was here was a young man sitting in the back of the church and and he in his heart saying I know I need to go up and give my life to Christ but this and but that and you know relatives in the church and all kinds of things and it was when God finally moves upon him and he comes to the front the preacher was done never prays for him when the young man got up from the altar that day the only thought he had because of some wrong teaching was God failed to meet me here because he believed the preacher needed to come and lay hands on him to make it all worthwhile but with the right teaching to realize that it was God Amen the Holy Spirit was who is meeting him here and it's there that we need to have that understanding how that anchored that God always keeps his appointments amen and it was many years the reason the story is a story it was many years ago before the young man no longer a young man was moved again of the Holy Spirit to give his heart to God years were wasted because a preacher decided the service was finished and he gives his heart that time God put someone in his life that said if we have to stay here all night God will meet you here if we have to stay all night my God keeps his appointments so as we look at that we realize in the story the Lord needed to meet her also amen amen now let's move on to verse 35. while he yet spake in other words telling this daughter thy faith had made the whole go in peace and be whole of that plague amen so it's there that as while he yet spake there come from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said that daughter is dead why trouble is thou the master any further well they certainly had the dialogue correct to call him Master amen and you know my brother and sister it seems like in every move of God there's always a messenger that shows up that just has to throw the wet blanket on what God is doing amen so no doubt this messenger that come from the house had good intentions but was not very spiritual still maybe trained up in the church as he's coming from jairus's house and the church really didn't look for the supernatural the church had its mind already made up what God was going to do and how the Messiah was going to come and everything had to fit in its little box now my brother and sister putting things in boxes is good that's called organization amen not in the sense of men over men but organization outside of chaos or disorganization so it's nice to put things in a box right we can in a sense say well we've come and by God's grace we recognize baptism and we can figuratively put it in the box that we by God's grace see baptism we get to see the deity of Christ we're going to put that in the Box do you follow me amen so to be organized in our thinking instead of chaotic is wonderful but here comes a messenger from the house and and he has I believe probably good intentions of hey she's dead it's it's finished we we're we're done here you might as well just let Jesus go off and and and uh you know deal with other things or rest or whatever so why bother him but my brother and sister you know sometimes God works in spite of our lack of spiritual understanding in fact of our lack of Revelation in fact our lack of reverence a lack of attention we could go through several of those adjectives that would describe our lack but my brother and sisters will look at this God would be in this situation and he's in control can you say amen I don't care what your day was today God was in control amen so you know I would just put this as we would go to move on here Lord help us to be the right kind of messenger amen even if a day is tough a situation is tough Lord let the words that come from my mouth let the words that pass from my lips be the kind of words that will not be negative I tell you I have to work on that Saints it's not an easy thing sometimes to to just be able to speak the positive all the time I just read a deal I won't go in it because I'll butcher it but it was talking about how the the pessimists and The Optimist are common and I think I'll go ahead and say it the pessimist says things couldn't get worse and the Optimus says oh yes they can oh my God but The Optimist wasn't really giving an optimistic message he thought he was oh no don't worry it can get worse my brother and sister Lord help us to be the right kind of messenger now in the sermon amen that we look here real quick uh in message law amen we'll come go ahead and bounce that forward their brothers amen right there now Paul speaking here of the valley or the shadow rather the law being the shadow of good things to come and could never make the worshiper perfect then he goes on to show what Perfection is aren't you glad that it's been revealed to us what Perfection is amen otherwise we would hear by works be trying to be perfect not not by just simple uh uh uh service to the Lord but literally by works I must do this and I must do that and I must do that my brother and sister that's why you can go to Nepal and you've got people sleeping on Stone beds with no window in the window in the winter time and freezing and suffering in their 40s and already stove up completely because they believe they must suffer like that to be perfect in Christ but Jesus says suffer the little children to come a whole different kind of suffering give opportunity for Make Way for them bring them amen so it's there that God has a different idea Jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered many trials my brother and sister many things that he suffered but the bride of Christ today we are here tonight as Believers Suffering amen amen now we might go home and climb at a very comfortable bed with plenty of blankets to pull up and and sleep nice and cozy tonight but we find my brother and sister met with the day that we are living in this laodicean age with a constant bombardment from Satan trying to deceive and turn and discourage that the bride of Christ also is learning amen character by suffering she's also learning what it is to be a follower of Christ amen he goes to show what Perfection is now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian oh have we ever said that amen that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then see you mustn't never say that now I don't care my brother and sister were the emotion of the struggle and the battle is and the strain and the weariness and all of these things let's obey the prophet's words and keep those things from our lips Amen to be able to say I I know I failed the Lord today and I know that I can do better but by God's grace I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God and I will overcome amen don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart do you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart amen and I put that quote because I wanted to counter as it is the negative aspect of a servant who probably with good intentions come but said you know what your daughter's dead just leave him be let him go we'll just go home and we'll mourn and we'll do what we must do and I'm here and your other servants and those from the church are here to comfort you but my brother and sister wasn't looking for Comfort was looking for a supernatural Deliverance the supernatural visitation in my house in your house amen not to be comforted but a divine intervention of almighty God to come down that's what we're looking for Hallelujah amen now look at this if we're turned to verse 36 brother Gideon take us back to verse 36. amen now an interruption on the road right there but we're back now amen as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken you get that as soon as he didn't say well we'll just let this all shake out and we'll show them otherwise but the point that the prophet of God was speaking in that sermon is right here and the moment amen as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue Jairus Be not Afraid only belief what was he doing that spirit that come unwittingly may be out of the mouth of that messenger Jesus was there and he stopped it he put a halt to it right there and he declared to them amen Be not Afraid why my brother and sister it wasn't mourning that come into his heart first thought it was a fear my daughter is actually dead and Jesus says Be not Afraid stop the spirit of fear have you ever noticed how fear comes in many forms and Fashions into our life the man whose paycheck is not big enough is afraid of dealing with the reality of what he has to set down to and so then he becomes wasteful and frivolous because he can't deal with the stress and so he finds himself doing something silly and we find people in all kinds of situations unable to face the fear of a coming or pending event Jesus is here be not afraid only believe oh don't sit there and say but but but take the fear bind it in the name of Jesus Christ believe the promise of God believe that word that God has given amen I say it was relevant then how much more it is relevant to the Bride of Jesus Christ today amen now look my brother and sister you can find I just gonna paraphrase off of this there's lots and lots of quotes where brother branham's talking along this line but I'm telling you my brother and sister we've seen it over and over Through The Years amen that Satan always comes and tries to quench the moving of the spirit we'll have a supernatural service we'll have the moving of God and it's like it don't have to be Monday it can be Wednesday or whatever it be and Satan always comes in and tries to quench that moving of the spirit because if the fire ever gets burning Satan is not a very good fireman hmm he's not at all no he does not know how to put the fire out or there would be no fire in hell if Satan knew how to put the fire out and there would be no lick of fire stirring the hearts of Sons and Daughters of God if Satan knew how to put the fire out but he tries we have to give him some credit he tries to quench the moving of the spirit but look what Jesus is doing Jesus doesn't sort into a dialogue about teaching and this and that what Jesus does is quenches the negative thought he cuts it off when it comes out of the lips of that messenger he quenched the anointing that was on those words he quenched it right there amen a fiery Dart of the enemy amen quenched it right on this spot thank you Lord Hallelujah why only belief only believe he doesn't give him a dialogue of who I am what is happening what the prophet said what this is here what is that and it all speaks of me in this day and no he just speaks to something I hope you catch this something that was already in jairus's heart it was already inside there something that was believing that's what got him out of the chair that's what got him out of the door that's what got him on the road and to come down to find where Jesus was at is because it was already something in there that believed and Jesus was just reminding him of what he had already placed in him oh it was there from the foundation in the world can someone say thank you Lord and he's just reminding us don't let that fiery Dart get you yes it might strike you but I'm here to quench it only believe and the devil's there going no if you can't believe but something inside of you says Jesus said it I believe it I will believe I hope you don't mind if I get excited tonight Hallelujah now look what happens here my brother and sister we look in these next verses 37 38 39. and if you just read that you might say in a sense from a carnal point of view you'd think that Jesus was going to just exclude right he's he's only going to just take his his disciples take some men that were of Faith take them with him to the house but what we realize is when he gets to the house he's in the house death has to fleece yeah amen so he takes Peter and James and John might as well have a power packed group when you go somewhere hmm and he comes to jairus's house and what does he come he comes to chaos something that's loud it's it's a a Brazen sound it's it's just chaos is taking place there and and no doubt my brother and sister the grief the mother is there and and friends and families aunts and uncles and whatever and they were they were weeping and and they were wailing I have been there my brother and sister in the very presence of people when a loved one unexpected as it were you know you look at this and now don't misunderstand me when someone's 95 years old we realize they're living on God's time on Grace but you know a child 12 years old we we do not expect that and and how the shock of that I've been there when a person or a young person has died and to see the utter shock of it slamming into the emotion of a mother and of a father and it's no small thing and we won't speak lightly of that but my brother and sister when Jesus walks into this chaos we would be thinking oh my what will he do she's already dead now we get to look at it from hindsight we see what God chose to do but if we had been standing there on the threshold of the door and seeing Jesus come up and the door being open and see a mother maybe other siblings and aunts and uncles in their grief of oh Lord she died they went to get the master nothing happened but I'll tell you what it is it's times like that that reveals what's really inside of you and I amen could we say I hope I never face that I hope you never face that but I would say by God's grace could we stand and say the lord giveth and the lord taketh away the way of the Lord is perfect our heart may be breaking but we know God's in control but when you've been taught by the church and there's no real anchor that grief is overwhelmed there's no way to just accept I remember many years ago I've shared it here in the church here a young man in Chile he come to the front of the church during the service their port is heart out to the Lord we were praying for him I could not have even told you the words that I spoke over him but we were vocal and there were others close around deacons other ministers some say it was a prophecy to me it was nothing more than just a prayer for a young teenager that was caught up with you know tons and tons of bracelets and rings on his fingers and necklaces raised in a house amen a grandpa who is a pastor a father who is a minister and my heart's breaking for this young man and I just poured my heart out and only a short time later this young man is there in the streets of Santiago and gets hit by a city bus and he's laying there on the street blood coming out of his eyes out of his nose out of his ears and he's not breathing and the Supernatural is going to take place because God cannot fail hey man he had an appointment with a boy that Witnesses said he's dead but the young man that was with him dialed the phone called the Deacon and said Pedro has been hit by a boss and he's dead and that brother being a man of God says put the phone to his ear and he put the phone to his ear and he said in the name of Jesus Christ rise up then all of a sudden his body created a great he and he set up and he says what happened had no realization of what happened my brother and sister they later said oh it was a prophecy well my brother and sister we won't never put ourselves or insert ourself in there but it wasn't anyone remembered but that young man did when God restored him up and said there was something spoke over me and they searched back through their Church tapes until they came to that service and it was there plainly caught on a microphone and what was it my brother and sister as those brothers were there were recognizing that was not brother Paul that was God speaking Paul couldn't even know my brother and sister and I want you to catch this tonight that when it comes God has the right words at the right time and he'll use the right Messenger to give a message of Hope to you a message of life to you a message of strength to you God chooses a messenger a man cannot make himself that messenger god does the choosing and it might be as the prophet of God said one time in that man's life that God would use him like that it's up to God but I tell you what God's got the word my brother and sister amen he's got the things that he wants to speak at that time and I hope you follow my train of thought there and when Jesus came in amen verse 39 when he came in he saith to them will I make ye this Ado and weep they bustle thought he was crazy here's the bed here's a little girl 12 years old she's laying there she's dead what do you mean weeping and making it a do you must be out of your mind a daughter a granddaughter a niece whatever she might have been she's dead but I tell you what they didn't understand my brother and sister the power of the word that had come in their hour and I wonder sometimes if we understand the power of the word that has come in our hour the prophet of God encouraging a mother a housewife you lay your hands on them and pray the prayer of faith do we understand that power Amen to be consecrated and stand on the promise of God and speak it out and declare it my brothers do we understand the power God has given us the damsels Not Dead but sleepeth I can tell you what those waning moments of her life must have been life for those people Once Upon a Time in the wee hours of a morning come across the car wreck out in the desert out here in Oregon I got their three little children into my truck I couldn't convince the man and his wife they said no help will come quickly and I'm thinking where do you think you're at the lady went into shock her eyes rolling up in her head breathing become very ragged I had to go out in the cold myself cross a barbed wire fence and climb up a hill and stand at the top up there on my cell phone where's the ambulance after I called this lady so many times she would answer the phone it's going to be all right Paul 9-1-1 operator yeah no call of 9-1-1 what can we do for you she recognized the number This Guy's in the middle of nowhere my brother and sister as I watched life ebb from that woman's body I myself became frantic I told the 911 operator if she dies in my truck I'll never forgive you four hours for an ambulance to show up and I watched her slowly fade and I can assure you you can't hold your breath long enough to match her breathing here's my little girl my little niece my granddaughter she's fading it's dying gyro said he was going to get the master where is the master stress building chaos starting to ensue in the house no doubt there were voices crying out to God but my brother and sister they had never laid the right foundation to cry out to God they never laid the right foundation their faith was in their Church it wasn't in God it was in their Church now the prophet encourages us we should belong to a church that's what the word says but our faith can't be in the church amen unless you're talking about you brought your faith tonight with you and it's in this building here tonight but to have it just in the church we cannot place our faith in that church right and so there it is when Jesus speaks these words and says you know what uh she's not dead but sleepeth there's much it's much deeper than what we read on the surface here amen we know that there would been some in the house would not have received this is not according to what our church teaches what we need to go now is start mixing up the herbs and all of the oils and we need to get the swaddling cloth and we need to wrap her up and we we got to do this because she's dead they totally missed the supernatural event my brother and sister when the prophet of God's talking about the second indictment on the church my brother and sister he is already talking to a people that have a mentality that we're embalmed already we are this is what we are this is all the hope there is just go to church your name on the book everything is fine that's all God expects there were some that were ready to bury that little girl because their expectation ended right there but I'm telling you my brother and sister when you look at this scripture right here I hope I can bring it out correctly amen because some wouldn't have received it anyhow but there was some that had a desire amen they had a desire to believe but when you've got somebody saying don't bother the master any longer it was something that quenched that little bit of faith that they had that maybe we are just bothering the master maybe this is just all done this is the Lord's will whatever it might be amen but they had a desire to believe but too much negative influence yeah too many Messengers had come to them now how many times I I didn't even bother to try and put the quotes together because it's it's just all through the message brother Branham talking about that uh son or daughter of God will say Amen to the word now when the word stood there in their midst and said don't worry she's only sleeping see if they'd had a revelation of who was speaking the word they would have said amen to it but he's already been identified and they couldn't accept the identification look at the world we live in today my brother and sister if I had come out here in a giant stiff robe with gold gilding and a stick and a hat on my head and I would have come out here and tapped it and done all whatever some people would say that is a sign of a real minister where is that my brother and sister the word of God says a real Minister knows rightly divide the word of God that's God's sign of a real minister is one that can get into the word and actually see the mind of God and speak it out not what kind of deal we're wearing whether our cross we have around our neck is solid gold the unbeliever the make-believer my brother and sister they will find themselves at times able to say Amen to the word but many times and as the pressure gets greater more and more they're actually unable to say Amen to the word come on I have a dozen examples in my head but they're pretty blunt and straightforward and I'm trying to curb that blunt straightforward thing amen but they find themselves unable to say Amen to the word there are certain times and certain words they just simply cannot acknowledge and in that realm my brother and sister you'll find that what's really down in the heart when the word says Christ in you that's it the hope of glory and someone's response is if God's in me where's he at you realize there's some false teaching some poor teaching some misdirection maybe lack of teaching altogether no revelation do you believe saints that we is more or less focused to adults could take our Bible and literally sit down and show that God intended for us to recognize that he's in US shouldn't be too hard for us amen right I don't want to get distracted that's not my main thought but see I want you to understand that people in the house weren't able to accept what was taking place because they had no Foundation to accept it from they had no place to go that's why and I I certainly not like promote myself don't misunderstand me tonight but my brother and sister I believe that's why we just need some good old-fashioned fundamental it don't need to be great flowery preaching it needs to hit on these points that we recognize who we are and what God intended for you and I amen what is it the prophet of God chose us clearly example after example that God intends for you and I in the time of trouble to cry out for life people are like well I didn't know what to pay I've been told this to my faith I I didn't pray because I didn't know what to pray maybe God was taking them the word shows us God wants you you and I to cry out for life God will make the final decision and we need to accept that decision but our first impulse should be lay hands on that little girl and we start praying for her and God will raise her up because God is a supernatural God and he is the creator of Heaven and Earth and he's the one that spoke it all in existence and he can do anything he wants and I'm going to claim life amen amen but instead chaos reigned have you ever noticed I said I didn't want to be blunt but I'm just going to speak this out have you ever noticed that religious Spirits get angry when you don't agree with them religious spirits a believer is tolerant you know that in an age where tolerance is abused and we get spooked about being tolerant but did you know a real believer is tolerant yes if you don't agree amen what does a real believer do praise for you that's what a real believer does they don't slam doors they don't call names they don't say that you're lost if they really believe you're wrong they'll go home they'll pray for you and we believe they're not in the right position we pray for them and if you say brother Paul where do you get that well just go read that simple little silly story where the prophet of God talked about drawing this circle bigger he never once stopped and said you're now outside of my circle he drew this circle bigger because he didn't need you the force of personality to conquer someone he let the Holy Spirit do the Conquering amen before I get off on the wrong subject we'll just move away amen so you know uh oh I will throw this out I did have a little footnote here religious spiritual argue my brother and sister when it's black and white in the word that's right that's right they'll argue with you of what it means [Music] and they laughed him to scorn have any of you ever been laughed out to the level that it would be called left to scorn where it is so derisive so anointed that they literally by their laughter by their Persona presentation is telling you that your intelligence your integrity everything is just less than dirt here's a little girl this might shock you I would never refuse the prayers of a man who was sincere who did not agree with me when you agree with me come back and pray for me no no I didn't really want to identify anybody but when you got a friend that you got friends that are Baptist and they say we pray for you I don't say well I don't know if I can accept thank you thank you for your prayers why weren't these people inside the house saying Jesus is here we don't know what he's going to do maybe he's just going to pray over her get back everyone give him opportunity to eat but it threw them for a loop because their faith was limited catch this o message people catch this their faith was limited to the ritual they had been taught they could approach God from let's be real careful we don't put ritual in front of a relationship we have a method we have a program yeah yeah my brother and sister we need to be careful but you know there there's always going to be the scoffer isn't that correct come on Saints this is going to be blunt and forgive me if it's too blunt but we've had them pass right through this church scoffers are going to be present amen will the scoffer stop the bride no hmm well the one that scorns when he stopped the bride oh so what do you do he put them all out now this is not in context that you're now kicked out of the church and you're kicked out of the church and you're kicked out of the church not talking about that kind of putting them out he just simply said I'm not gonna I'm not gonna let the atmosphere be contaminated by your unbelief but I'm going to read a quote to you in a minute that might or might not change your point of view because you see the reason Jesus put them out of there was not so that Faith could raise up the little girl amen he didn't put them out because they were a hindrance to her coming back to life he put them out I believe just simply because he wanted to change the atmosphere and he didn't need those openly doubting openly scorning it was almost as though they were a nuisance to him are you following me we get the idea that he put them out maybe because they're unbelief and I got to get them out here for something to happen and I could take you back in the message where the prophet of God preaching Iowa is a perfect example Des Moines Iowa the prophet of God said it was hard for Faith to rise in the building because there was so much unbelief but people walked out of that Coliseum that night delivered and healed so as the prophet of God dealing with getting the unbelief out of the way so that God could work no you see the unbelief or the spirit of unbelief did not affect God it affects you and I so Jesus kicks them all out to create an atmosphere in the room now look at this my brother and sister the only people that it is he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him amen his disciples and inereth where the damsel was lying amen so what was it my brother and sister he's going in there now with Jairus and his wife mother of the child and now we already I believe addressed the fact that Jairus was a believer his whole prestige remember the prophet of God talks about those those uh those priests those uh uh that there there they have um their their retirement their whole life is tied up in the church Jairus would have been no different he's there walking out there getting Jesus bringing Jesus in the public to his house may have well just done away with his whole church-funded retirement might have done away with his whole uh prestige in the community just done all this but something down in his heart I can see Jairus if you just pardon me just a moment I can see Jairus and his wife sitting there saying our little girls getting sicker and sicker we've had the best doctors in this city and she's getting sicker and sicker and we hear look at this over here remember the lady that had the little deal down there in the market she was healed and did you hear the man running down the street saying so and so was delivered there's something going on Jairus you know you and I have prayed we've been devoted to God you know something's happening we believe and their little girl gets sick my brother and sister it was not a time that they decided to be Believers because of desperation they were already Believers the seed was down in the heart and it was there it may have took a time of desperation to scrape the dirt off the top and let the sun shine on it but they believed and it's there that Jesus Takes the disciples with him and takes Jairus and his wife in there and it's there my brother and sister I believe sometimes just as the prophet of God talks about this that God in this end time here it's not going to be a public work it's a private work it's a secret War it's a opening of the seals my brother and sister the personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you and I it's not on public display and Jesus is in there and they have a big rumpus and he shouts and kicks some chairs around he says arise amen arise oh my brothers look what the prophet said that spirit of fear Saints these are my words that spirit of fear hit him I believe that I'm on the right track because it says he joined himself with the unbelievers he went from having enough Faith to go out of the chair out the door down the road get Jesus my girl's dead but all the time I don't know about you tonight Saints I've had my ups and downs in life I've had my times I've said under the stars and said Lord what is wrong why Lord but down inside I have all the time of my life wanted to believe amen Jesus from my very youth there was something that always cried out Lord I need you I've got to serve you Hallelujah amen so there it is he's moving forward the prophet of God says in another sermon Jairus had true faith that's quite a statement see in spite of his position he believed amen amen the mother believed also and they got to see the fruit let me make this emphasis right here before we move on real quick got to see the fruit of their believing that's what God intends for you and I my brother and sister for us to see the fruit of believing his word we don't have a Barren tree this gospel that we call the message is not a Barren tree my brother and sister it's producing fruit Hallelujah oh my let me go on here in the sermon proving his word but in the face of all these I believe he's probably going to say unbelievers but uh unbelief or doubting ages and things that we have went through and live in today the worst of all in the face of all this doubt God does go right on proving his words to be right as he does in every age as he has in every age he unbelief doesn't stop God it doesn't hinder him I don't care how much the world unbelieves it's still going to happen unbelief doesn't do nothing but condemns the unbeliever the unbelief will send the unbeliever to Hell it'll Rob him of Every Blessing God has promised to him but it doesn't hinder God from going right on with the believer see unbelief doesn't stop God it only stops the unbeliever oh thank God we can stand at the door come in come in speak my Lord speak we've got the dead talking spiritually that need raised back to life Lord just speak the word tell them rise amen and claim their position my brother and sister amen Hebrews 11 is not considered the faith chapter because it's presumptuous my brother and sister it is the faith chapter because it is reality in print my now look at this I gotta close here verse 41 he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha Kumar which is being interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise you know what that voice was the same voice of creation that was the voice of creation was she dead yes she was dead but when he told her to arise that vessel of creation had to respond to the voice of creation and produce what the voice of creation declared and it had to rise up there was not a chance that she could not rise up when the voice spoke oh I say my brother and sister if you'll go through your Bible you and I go through our Bible we will see all through the word come come come arise speak go believe all of these words that are commands and they come from the one who is the voice of creation and it's not speaking to you if you feel like it if it's convenient if that nothing opposes it it's speaking directly to you to come and believe and live and overcome and possess ever everything my brother and sister and is coming from the voice of creation oh hallelujah look at this he tells her arise and I want to ask you this question whose vessel is this anyhow is it Jairus in his wife's vessel no sir is it their daughter's vessel no this was God's chosen vessel that he chose to manifest and live in oh my God what is it in the scripture a vessel is a temple of the Holy Ghost amen that little girl my brother and sister God was not speaking to flesh I hope you follow me here he wasn't speaking to flesh for flesh to obey he was speaking to the spirit for the spirit is what is the life he spoke to the spirit in that little girl and told the spirit in her arrives and you and I my brother and sister the word is speaking to the spirit in you and I not for us to the be the letter of the law for the law amen the book killeth but the spirit giveth life and he's speaking to the spirit telling you and I rise up and possess the land amen he's not talking to Old tired flesh he's not talking to those that we're weary and the things of this law he's speaking to the spirit if he was speaking to flesh my brother and sister there'd be a time our flesh could not respond but I'm telling you as long as there's breath in these bodies the spirit will respond to the voice of creation oh Hallelujah I'm sorry I'm getting excited tonight amen it shouldn't have been a surprise God said it we should expect it to come to pass oh my what was happening you know what Spooks us is we're getting a glimpse of another dimension and I'll just say on my behalf so that no one will feel offended I have a hard time grasping this dimension much less stepping into another dimension but as it was once it was death to go behind the veil now it's death to not go behind the veil did he say you'd always feel comfortable did he say it would be easy no he just said you'll go and I will meet you there amen oh isn't that beautiful Saints that is so beautiful he invited us and then he promised I'll meet you right there inside the Veil oh my amen sister vika will you come Hallelujah Isaiah Isaiah 60. you know I believe Saints Justice sure as Jesus speaking to the damsel the little girl I believe these words spoken by the prophet Isaiah contain the same power of The Voice of creation arise oh my God [Music] when your debt's low enough you have enough time off when life's comfortable your children are the most obedient in church when your prayer life is just Supreme [Music] I don't see any quantifiers other than it's telling us to arise and shine for our light amen our light has walked through the door and come we had to go to him Jairus had to go to him that's how God ordained it when all hope was gone for Jairus and he didn't have to come he'd already been given me out let the master go she's dead and when he didn't have to come to you and I because we were dead and trespass he come in he didn't have to grab us he didn't have to shake us he didn't have to quote all the scripture to us something spoke down in the depths of our soul said arise can we just stand up ourselves and just praise the Lord tonight for your lightest come in the glory of the Lord is risen upon there I say we ought to have something to just Worship the Lord amen because when there was no way we could go to him he came to us oh Lord we thank you tonight oh Father when we look at Jairus is life hard decisions Lord Jesus a public a public witness Lord I pray that you're just calm and speak to our hearts Lord to get the unbelief out to get the other voices out to get the interruptions unless they're your interruptions Lord get them out of our lives get all the distractions [Music] that we can create an atmosphere Lord [Music] that the word would come in our house your word your voice and we could hear it to the depths of our soul and respond to it not just talk about it but respond to it [Music] Lord I want to arise for the light has come and I can claim that as my light for that portion was allotted to me we claim that tonight Lord I just pray Lord for every need Lord for lost loved ones for children and grandchildren sons and daughters friends maybe mother father whatever it might be Lord we put the unbelief and the distractions out of our life that we can change the atmosphere that the voice of creation can speak to sons and daughters the voice of creation can change the atmosphere because it's not speaking to our flesh but it's speaking to our souls I will love you tonight I say thank you for your word Lord forgive us Lord of our shortcomings Lord forgive us for the Times Lord that we've joined the ranks of the unbelievers forgive us father for that but I say thank you Lord Jesus when you said be not afraid don't be dismayed don't be discouraged just believe Lord
