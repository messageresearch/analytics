[12:00] I'm a pilgrim
[12:02] and a stranger
[12:06] wandering through this world of sin.
[12:11] On my way to that fair city.
[12:17] When the saints go maring in.
[12:22] Oh, when the saints
[12:25] go marching in.
[12:28] When the saints go marching in,
[12:34] Lord, I want to be in that number

[15:20] Amen. Number 472. Let's go up to key of
[15:23] E.
[15:26] This world is not my home. I'm just a
[15:30] passing through. My treasures are laid
[15:34] up somewhere beyond the blue. The angels
[15:40] beckon me from heaven's open door. And I
[15:45] can't feel at home in this world
[15:49] anymore.
[15:51] Lord, you know I have no friend like
[15:55] you. If heaven's not my home, that Lord,
[16:00] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[16:05] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[16:09] feel at home in this world anymore.
[16:14] They're all expecting me. And that's one
[16:18] thing I know. I fixed it up with Jesus
[16:23] many years ago. I know he'll see me
[16:27] through. Though I am weak and poor and I
[16:32] can't feel at home in this world
[16:36] anymore.
[16:37] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[16:42] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[16:47] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[16:52] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[16:56] feel at home in this world anymore.
[17:01] Just over in the glory land. We'll live
[17:05] eternally.
[17:06] The saints on every hand are shouting
[17:10] victory.
[17:12] The songs of sweetest praise drift back
[17:16] from heaven's shore. And I can't feel at
[17:20] home in this world anymore.
[17:24] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[17:28] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[17:33] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[17:38] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[17:42] feel at home in this world anymore.
[17:48] Amen.
[17:50] Um,
[17:52] I skipped one song, but we'll sing it
[17:54] now, I guess. Come and dine, KFG.

[20:49] to it. Number 235, please. As we get

[23:33] Amen. Heavenly Father, as we bow our
[23:35] heads before you and in your presence we

[23:43] of the King.

[25:44] these things in Jesus Christ's name.
[25:47] Amen.
[25:51] You may be seated
[25:55] for the Paul. Would you like to sing
[25:56] right now or
[25:59] as you come? Okay.
[26:09] Brother Isaac, if you could put up the
[26:11] lily of the valley.
[26:13] So I'll just be real forward of the
[26:16] reason I'm standing here today at youth
[26:20] group. I was challenged by a certain
[26:22] little sister that if I would sing a
[26:24] special that they would reciprocate and
[26:28] sing a special at a near date. And so um
[26:33] it was an uncction I actually here just
[26:35] um right after we got home from Europe
[26:38] felt like singing I love
[26:42] I love this song.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Because you can go through life and they
[26:47] say that if you have one good friend in
[26:49] your life you're blessed. And we for
[26:52] certain have our one good friend. Amen.
[26:59] I have found a friend in Jesus. He's
[27:03] everything to me. He's a fairest of
[27:07] 10,000 to my soul.
[27:11] The lily of the valley. In him alone I
[27:17] see all I need to cleanse and make me
[27:20] fully whole.
[27:24] In sorrow, he's my comfort. In trouble,
[27:28] he's my stay. He tells me every care on
[27:32] him to roll. Hallelujah. He's a lily of
[27:37] the valley, the bright and morning star.
[27:41] He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul.
[27:47] He all my grief has taken and all my
[27:52] sorrows borne. In temptation he's my
[27:55] strong and mighty tower.
[27:59] I have all for him forsaken
[28:03] and all my idols torn from my heart. And
[28:07] now he keeps me by his power.
[28:11] Though all the world forsake me and
[28:15] Satan tent me soar, through Jesus I
[28:19] shall safely reach the goal. Praise the
[28:22] Lord. He's the lily of the valley, the
[28:27] bright and morning star. He's the
[28:30] fairest of 10,000 to my soul.
[28:36] Never never leave me nor yet forsake me
[28:40] here. While I live by faith and do his
[28:44] blessed will.
[28:46] There's a wall of fire about me. I'm
[28:50] nothing now to fear. With his mana he my
[28:55] hungry soul shall fill.
[28:58] Then sweeping up to glory I'll see his
[29:03] blessed face where rivers of delight
[29:07] shall ever roll. Hallelujah. He's a lily
[29:12] of my valley, my bright and morning
[29:15] star. He's a fairest
[29:19] &gt;&gt; to my soul. Sing it with me. He's a lily
[29:24] of the valley, the bright and morning
[29:27] star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my
[29:32] soul.
[29:34] He's the lily of our valley, our bright
[29:38] and morning star. He's the fairest of
[29:42] 10,000 to my soul.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, SISTER.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Can you find that song, Joel's Army?
[30:04] I think it's 7:17.
[30:11] Oh, morning stars
[30:14] together sing.
[30:18] Sons of God,
[30:20] his praises ring.
[30:23] Arise and shine.
[30:26] Thy Lord and King
[30:29] comes full redemption
[30:32] now to bring.
[30:35] Joel's army
[30:38] comes in view.
[30:41] Stalward men
[30:43] and women true
[30:46] in perfect step.
[30:49] We are God's best,
[30:52] invincible.
[30:55] Through the great word test,
[30:58] the son of righteousness
[31:01] shall shine
[31:04] with healing in
[31:06] his wings. He'll rise.
[31:09] Shake this whole world
[31:12] in one more ride.
[31:15] Then take his bride
[31:18] into the skies.
[31:21] You considered
[31:24] my little bride.
[31:27] Off to deceive
[31:30] her. You have tried.
[31:32] No fairer one.
[31:35] From east to west,
[31:38] ordained to stand
[31:41] in the great word test.
[31:44] The line of Judah
[31:47] has prevailed.
[31:50] Almighty God
[31:53] and flesh was veiled.
[31:56] He comes forth now
[31:58] to conquer all.
[32:01] The kingdoms of
[32:04] this world shall fall.
[32:07] Oh bridegroom, come.
[32:10] Our hearts do pine
[32:13] upon thy bows.
[32:16] I'm to recline.
[32:19] My lovely bride,
[32:22] you are my own.
[32:25] Come sit with me
[32:28] upon thy throne. My lovely bride, my
[32:31] lovely bride,
[32:33] you are my own.
[32:36] Now come sit with me
[32:39] upon my throne.
[32:43] Amen. Praise the Lord.

[37:23] And I trust that this morning each one
[37:25] of us will come with an open heart to
[37:28] just receive what God would give,
[37:31] &gt;&gt; what you've been needing. Amen. You
[37:33] know, it's interesting. It's not always
[37:36] what we think we need.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; But it's what God knows that we need.
[37:40] And we just come this morning just
[37:42] desiring for the Lord to speak to us. I
[37:45] know even as a minister, as a pastor,
[37:48] there's many times in the preaching of
[37:50] the word that the Lord pricks my own
[37:53] heart from the very words that I speak
[37:55] to realize I need change. I need things
[37:59] in my life. And we just trust
[38:03] that the Lord will come and speak to us
[38:05] today. Want to greet Doug. Amen. We've
[38:09] been communicating just a little bit.
[38:11] He's come to visit the church today. And
[38:13] so we just uh pray that you're blessed
[38:16] today, my friend. Amen. Um, so I want to
[38:22] announce uh it's been a too long of a
[38:26] span, but I want to announce a grace
[38:27] kids at our house this Friday evening at
[38:31] 700 p.m. And uh so we just uh want to
[38:35] invite all of those that would qualify
[38:37] at the age of grace kids and I think
[38:40] what is that 12 down something of that
[38:43] nature. Amen. And uh is there any
[38:48] interest in next Sunday
[38:51] afternoon evening just having a song
[38:54] service?
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; That'd be good. So, okay. I'm going to
[39:00] be bold. Does that mean Sister Carrie
[39:02] singing a special for us?
[39:04] And then right behind you, Sister
[39:06] Carrie,
[39:07] &gt;&gt; what a great idea.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Sister Mel was right behind you. So
[39:13] anyway, so we want to do that. Would
[39:15] that be something we'd love to do? Just
[39:16] get together, sing some songs as a
[39:18] group, and if the Lord lays it on your
[39:21] heart, not Paul, uh sing a special or
[39:24] two maybe in our midst. So let's just
[39:26] plan on that. Next Sunday, 5:00 p.m.
[39:30] that'd be a good time and we could just
[39:32] uh have a a lovely time of worship.
[39:35] Amen. So let's just uh I want to speak
[39:39] to you today on the thought of finding
[39:41] glory. Thank you wonderful song service.
[39:45] Say thank you sister Vika for playing
[39:47] that song for me and um for the birthday
[39:51] wishes. I'm not really a a birthday fan
[39:54] but um uh thank you for the birthday
[39:58] wishes and God bless each and every one
[40:00] of you. Amen. And um I think brother
[40:03] David um instigated a little bit.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; It was pure inspiration. Okay. What can
[40:09] I say?
[40:10] &gt;&gt; What can I say? So pure inspiration. So
[40:14] uh finding glory in God's plan. If we
[40:17] would turn in our Bibles to Isaiah the
[40:20] 40th chapter and uh we'll read verses
[40:24] 3-5.
[40:25] Uh I find it to be a very inspiring the
[40:28] whole chapter of Isaiah 40 is a very
[40:30] inspiring chapter
[40:35] and uh
[40:37] so
[40:38] we'll just take these three verses. The
[40:41] voice of him that crith in the
[40:43] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[40:46] Lord. Make straight in the desert a
[40:48] highway for our God. Every valley shall
[40:52] be exalted. Every mountain and hill
[40:54] shall be made low, and the crooked shall
[40:56] be made straight, and the rough places
[40:59] plain, and the glory of the Lord shall
[41:02] be revealed. All flesh shall see it
[41:05] together, for the mouth of the Lord hath
[41:08] spoken it. Heavenly Father, we just come
[41:11] this morning asking you, Lord, just to
[41:14] come, walk in the aisles of this
[41:17] assembly, walk in the aisles of our
[41:19] hearts. For Father, we have come and we
[41:22] realize the time is short. We see all
[41:24] the signs of the times, Father, that
[41:27] your word has declared and we see it
[41:29] coming to pass before us. And Lord,
[41:32] we're living in the very midst of the
[41:34] revelation. And Lord, let us not miss
[41:36] it, Father. Not looking back, for you
[41:40] are the same yesterday, today, and
[41:43] forever. And we can just see the word
[41:45] unfolding. Not even out in the world,
[41:47] Father, but we can see it unfolding in
[41:50] our lives. And Father, I say thank you
[41:52] that you would shine. Let your glory be
[41:55] revealed in us in this hour. For you
[41:58] said there would be a people, a chosen
[42:00] people, a called out people. And we
[42:02] believe according to the word, Lord,
[42:03] that we are those people. And Lord, we
[42:06] long in our heart, Father, to be those
[42:09] that hear the words, "Well done, my good
[42:11] and faithful servant." Lord, we believe
[42:14] that. We stand upon it today. Now Lord,
[42:16] we want to just not hear the word today,
[42:19] but Lord, we want to claim the word,
[42:22] receive the word, and live the word
[42:24] forth. Lord, we thank you in your
[42:26] precious name. Amen. You may be seated,
[42:30] saints. Hallelujah.
[42:32] And uh
[42:35] so as we would as we would um just move
[42:41] forward in our thought today, I I think
[42:44] that we should be able to say thank you
[42:46] Lord that his glory, your glory is being
[42:49] revealed in us. Amen. That's what the
[42:52] word said would happen in the day that
[42:53] we're living in. That God would have a
[42:55] people that he would pour himself into.
[42:58] My brother and sister, it's not
[43:00] anointing just upon the flesh, but he's
[43:02] live literally living in you and I. And
[43:05] and I I thank the Lord for that. And to
[43:07] go back and revisit verse five for just
[43:09] a moment. And the glory of the Lord
[43:11] shall be revealed. Can we say amen? It
[43:14] has been revealed. Amen. And flesh shall
[43:17] see it together for the mouth of the
[43:20] Lord has spoken it. And we know that
[43:22] every word that our Lord Jesus Christ
[43:24] ever placed, ever was placed in the
[43:26] Bible, every word that's there must come
[43:29] to pass. There's not one word that will
[43:31] be laid aside, put on the shelf,
[43:33] forgotten or deemed unnecessary. But it
[43:37] is here for our benefit, to uplift us,
[43:40] to help us. Sometimes it's here to
[43:42] chasen us, to uh bring us to a place
[43:44] that we can actually receive correction.
[43:47] And I would lift my hand even before I
[43:49] would ask you, do we desire for the Lord
[43:51] to chasen us? Amen. That's what we want.
[43:54] We want him to come and to just correct
[43:57] us and keep us on course of our lives.
[44:00] Amen. For there's a lot of distraction
[44:02] in the world we live in today. A lot of
[44:04] things that Satan would like to use to
[44:07] get us off course. And uh sometimes it
[44:10] is in sickness, sometimes it is in
[44:12] trouble, sometimes it is just simply our
[44:15] self. And we look at that and realize
[44:17] how gracious the Lord is that he comes
[44:20] and when we start to get off course in
[44:22] our life, he always comes and speaks to
[44:24] us and uh sets us back on the right
[44:28] course. Now we look back in the Bible,
[44:31] we can see that through the ages, man
[44:34] has thought he could improve on God's
[44:36] plan. And it's there that we would be
[44:38] able to start right in the very
[44:40] beginning with Cain. uh and uh on the
[44:42] natural side, we could actually
[44:44] literally go back a little further. But
[44:47] starting with Cain, he thought that the
[44:49] beauty of his worship was going to be
[44:51] what God really wanted. That's that was
[44:53] the understanding he got that it's going
[44:55] to be in the beauty of the worship.
[44:58] Therefore, we'll see that spirit has not
[45:00] died in the day we live in. We can have
[45:02] great choirs in great big churches and
[45:05] all finely trained, finely clothed and
[45:07] robed and prosperity is everywhere. And
[45:10] man would say that is good, that is
[45:12] better. But that's not where the word
[45:15] says. Amen. God's got a chosen place of
[45:18] worship for the bride of Christ. The
[45:20] place that he calls beautiful. And
[45:22] that's always in his word. That's in his
[45:24] word to say, Lord, I believe this. I'm
[45:27] going to live this. I want to live for
[45:29] you. I'll pay the price. Whatever man
[45:31] might say, I'll pay that price. And God
[45:34] sees beauty in that simplicity. He's not
[45:37] looking for the great robed choir
[45:40] because as examples have given many
[45:42] times the robe of the choir covers up
[45:44] many impurities in many things and this
[45:48] is not even coming from our belief but
[45:50] coming from a different source and a man
[45:52] said I was visiting he tells a story I
[45:54] was visiting a church once and he said
[45:57] the choir they sang so beautifully and
[45:59] and uh it was such a fine sound but he
[46:03] said as they were there and many sat
[46:05] down he said I realized that many of the
[46:08] choir members underneath that beautiful
[46:10] gown, they were dressed horribly. They
[46:13] did not look like Christians. They were
[46:15] dressed like the world. And he said,
[46:17] "But that that robe covered over that
[46:20] and you couldn't tell." But my brother
[46:22] and sister, that's not all false in a
[46:25] sense because Christ in the uh story of
[46:28] the wedding supper there, you know,
[46:30] being invited to that wedding, Amen.
[46:32] that robe covered up our filthiness.
[46:34] that covered up our our discrepancy, our
[46:37] shortcoming. But it needed to be a robe
[46:40] that we wanted, a robe that we embraced,
[46:43] a robe that became a permanent part of
[46:46] who we are. And it's not just a covering
[46:48] for a Sunday. It's not just covering for
[46:50] a moment, but it would become our very
[46:52] life. Amen. And so we'll look and you
[46:56] look at Cain, he thought that the beauty
[46:58] of his worship would be better. And even
[47:00] when Jesus or God, however you want to
[47:03] put at it, uh corrects him, he he he
[47:07] won't accept that correction, he still
[47:09] believes he's right. And and and you
[47:11] know, he was given that opportunity to
[47:13] repent from that that point. And it it
[47:17] started a bitterness or root in him that
[47:20] caused him to even go as far as to slay
[47:22] his own brother over just a form of
[47:24] worship. And it was there because he
[47:27] wanted to have the most beautiful
[47:28] preeminent worship. And you'll see that
[47:31] the glory that he was there, he was not
[47:34] wanting to glorify God or his heart
[47:36] would have been repentance and he would
[47:37] have changed how he was worshiping. But
[47:40] he wanted the glory to actually come to
[47:42] himself. He wanted it to be recognized
[47:45] that that I have the most beautiful
[47:47] worship. I have the best offering. I
[47:49] have the best that there is to give. And
[47:52] we'll see how that uh every age man has
[47:56] had a revelation on how he could make it
[47:58] better. And uh it's there that we'll see
[48:01] that uh you know as though God's plan
[48:05] needed our help as though God's plan
[48:08] needed our opinion. God's not looking
[48:11] for our help other than a complete
[48:14] surrender.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; He's not looking for our opinion. He's
[48:18] looking for us to look at the word and
[48:19] say, "I believe that and that's what I'm
[48:21] going to do now." Lord, if you would
[48:23] change this, it'll be a little better.
[48:26] If you would change that, it'll be a
[48:27] little better. But you see, my brother
[48:29] and sister, man has nothing he can offer
[48:31] to God.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; God has everything to offer to you and
[48:35] I, but we have literally nothing but our
[48:37] life to offer to him. And so as we'll
[48:41] look at this, we see that uh when when
[48:44] man comes to the idea that God's plan
[48:46] needs our help, then we need to stop and
[48:49] we need to find an altar. We need to
[48:51] come back and say, "Lord, forgive me. I
[48:53] I'm getting off track here." It's not
[48:56] for us to decide how to do it. I
[48:58] couldn't tell you. Maybe brother David
[49:01] uh would be able to help put it in
[49:02] words.
[49:04] But
[49:06] often times we come to the pulpit and
[49:09] you have a thought
[49:11] that that I've studied this certain
[49:13] thought. I've studied it in a certain
[49:15] fashion and this is how I'll deliver it.
[49:18] Now the Lord allowed us to study that
[49:20] spend many times hours upon hours and
[49:23] you study that and you believe that's uh
[49:25] what you're supposed to deliver. But God
[49:28] comes and takes the foundation of what
[49:30] you have studied and then God takes it
[49:32] over where he wants it to be and he's
[49:35] not concerned about how many hours we
[49:37] studied in in a certain fashion. He's
[49:40] concerned with presenting it the way he
[49:42] wants it to be presented. Now if you
[49:44] have the wrong attitude, you'll say,
[49:46] "Lord, I just wasted maybe hours or days
[49:50] studying it in a certain fashion." But
[49:52] the Lord did not waste our time.
[49:55] Everything that we have studied turns
[49:57] out to be a relevant factor. Now I'm not
[49:59] like making demonstration as to be a
[50:02] certain person. But maybe the Lord knew
[50:04] that a certain thing was needed here and
[50:06] a certain thing was needed there and he
[50:09] takes us in our own studies to cover
[50:11] those bases. But in the end he presents
[50:13] it the way he wants to present it and he
[50:16] lets it come down and rain down where he
[50:19] wants it to rain down. You see sometimes
[50:21] in the natural little things that'll
[50:23] speak to your heart. I have many times
[50:26] uh out in the country on the farm there
[50:28] literally the rain falls on this side of
[50:31] the road and this side of the road is
[50:33] dry. Amen. And that's how God presents
[50:35] his word. Sometime it'll come and just
[50:38] rain down on one person or multiple
[50:41] persons and everybody else is Sarah
[50:44] saying you know what that really didn't
[50:45] apply to me today. It didn't need to
[50:48] apply to you today because God was
[50:50] raining down on someone else. Amen. And
[50:53] but we got to be willing to recognize
[50:54] that the word that is coming is for
[50:57] every one of us. The word will never
[50:59] return void. Correct? And so it's there
[51:02] that when we just come to the house of
[51:04] God, we hear the word of God ministered.
[51:06] We believe the word and we come, it
[51:09] changes us. We walk out. Now you say,
[51:11] "Well, I I don't know that I really see
[51:13] or feel this change." You don't need to.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; God is changing you.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's doing his work.
[51:22] He's raining his glory down on you and
[51:25] you need to be able to understand or
[51:28] receive that this is raining down to
[51:31] you. Now, as I said, every age has had
[51:36] its revelation. Now, my brother and
[51:38] sister, what we want to do is find the
[51:40] revelation that God's pouring down in
[51:42] our age. In other words, what he's
[51:43] pouring down to you and I. Amen. Now,
[51:46] you'll find that the word, now this is
[51:48] just a life experience. You'll find that
[51:50] we're here, Grace Tabernacle. We have
[51:53] certain events that take place in our
[51:55] lives, things good and bad, you know,
[51:57] and things that are uh feel like a
[51:59] blessing and things that don't feel like
[52:01] a blessing. But God in the whole time
[52:04] has said that I would come in the midst
[52:05] of my people and I will bless them. I
[52:08] will pour out my blessings in abundance
[52:11] upon them. And so whether we're sitting
[52:13] here today saying this applies to me or
[52:15] it doesn't apply to me, you can sit back
[52:17] and lift a hand and say, "God's blessing
[52:19] me today. I'm in the house of God. I'm
[52:22] worshiping him. I'm giving him praise
[52:24] and honor today." And he promised that
[52:27] when he would have the praise of his
[52:29] people that he would come down. Amen. Do
[52:32] you believe he's here this morning?
[52:33] Amen. So as God is dealing with you and
[52:36] I, he's not dealing with us so that we
[52:38] can devise a better way to serve him.
[52:42] But he has a way, a chosen way to serve
[52:46] him, a chosen place to meet him at. And
[52:48] that is not in a church because as it
[52:50] is, it could be what church and you
[52:53] start naming it. There's so many
[52:54] churches that are so diverse in their
[52:57] behaviors and attitudes and what they
[52:58] believe. Which church will it be? The
[53:01] chosen place of worship is in the word.
[53:05] Amen. And when you're in the word,
[53:07] you're in his presence, which is his
[53:10] chosen place of worship. We have no
[53:13] Mecca.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Nor should we be looking for one
[53:18] &gt;&gt; because our place is in him.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; That's where our worship should be. Now,
[53:24] we'll see that um
[53:27] we'll never find glory in our plans.
[53:32] You just think about it. We make all
[53:34] kinds of plans as humans. So much so
[53:36] that on the farm
[53:39] we often times in dealing with the hired
[53:41] help, we start off this is plan A.
[53:44] Usually it don't take very long. We're
[53:46] on plan B. And just a hop, skip, and a
[53:48] jump past that we're on plan C, D, E, F.
[53:52] And sometimes you need to start we're on
[53:54] plan A
[53:56] because things shift so much. So, we try
[54:00] to set a certain plan. This is what
[54:02] we're going to do. I'm going to go to
[54:05] church today and I'm going to hear the
[54:09] most beautiful singing on earth.
[54:12] There's going to be a brother sing a
[54:13] special that sings it so good
[54:17] until he doesn't.
[54:20] And then we're going to hear some
[54:21] preaching that's just going to be out of
[54:23] this world until it's not.
[54:28] Remember,
[54:30] steak is just as good as caviar.
[54:37] But we want the best.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; But what we do do as believers, we come
[54:43] to the house of God and you say, "Lord,
[54:47] I want to meet you there today.
[54:50] My highest expectation today is to meet
[54:54] the Lord Jesus Christ in the house of
[54:56] God today. And if somebody sings well,
[54:59] they do. If they clap too loud, they do.
[55:02] If this is this, if a baby cries, if
[55:04] there's a distraction, it doesn't
[55:06] matter. I've met God in the house of God
[55:08] today. And that's the only thing that
[55:10] really matters to me because he said
[55:13] whenever I would meet you kind of taking
[55:15] this out of the Old Testament whenever I
[55:17] will meet you I will bless you.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so as we come our expectation
[55:22] should be Lord I'm here to meet you
[55:24] today because I'm going to be blessed.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we'll never find glory in our
[55:30] plans but we'll find the glory we're
[55:33] looking for in God's plan for us. And
[55:36] how often, now this might get a little
[55:38] personal, but how often do we get
[55:42] stumbled and and just quit moving
[55:44] forward because things don't go
[55:46] according to our plan,
[55:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:48] &gt;&gt; We we feel like things should be just
[55:51] like this. People should be just like
[55:53] this. Our family should be just like
[55:55] this. The church should be just like
[55:57] this. And then none of that lines up.
[56:00] And we go into Paul's mode. We we put it
[56:03] in park and we sit there waiting cuz
[56:05] something's got to change. And that's
[56:06] true. We need to change. We need to
[56:10] change because God's plan for us, my
[56:12] brother and sister, is often so
[56:15] different
[56:16] &gt;&gt; than our plan for ourself.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I shared with you here recently,
[56:22] that only between five and 8% of people
[56:25] actually totally fulfill what they
[56:27] thought their life would be. So they get
[56:30] down the road and their life has taken
[56:32] different turns, different
[56:34] circumstances. Things have changed. Now
[56:37] I can remember as a young man thinking
[56:39] how wonderful it be to to be a
[56:41] millionaire to that that that would just
[56:43] solve everyone's problem. You know, if
[56:46] you had a million dollars, you wouldn't
[56:48] have any problems. And then, you know,
[56:50] you read research
[56:53] that says there's as much or more mental
[56:56] illness and addictions, etc.
[56:59] in rich people
[57:01] &gt;&gt; as there is poor people. So our money
[57:04] didn't fix a single thing.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; In fact, it exaggerates
[57:11] our deficiency.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; So we look at this and realize that
[57:19] we need to look for God's plan. We need
[57:22] to follow God's plan and say, you know
[57:24] what, Lord, let your will be done in my
[57:27] life. That's why the scripture says we
[57:29] should never say, "I'm going to rise in
[57:31] the morning and I'm going to do this and
[57:32] this and this." You should always temper
[57:34] it with Lord willing. Amen. Because your
[57:37] plan might not match God's plan.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm just dehydrated today.
[57:43] Forgive me, saints.
[57:51] in Romans 8:27-31.
[57:54] Now, as we'll look at that, it says,
[57:57] "And he that searches the hearts knoweth
[57:59] what is the mind of the spirit, because
[58:01] he make intercession for the saints
[58:04] according to their plans."
[58:06] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; No. According to the will of God. Aren't
[58:10] you glad that uh the petition placed
[58:12] before the throne is not us trying to
[58:15] plan out tomorrow, us trying to lay this
[58:18] perfect plan out. Amen. You know, I I
[58:20] listened to a little sermon here
[58:22] recently and and uh the brother put it
[58:25] like this. He says, "Now imagine God
[58:27] comes in church and offers you a
[58:29] bitcoin."
[58:31] Now that sounds good if God would come
[58:33] down and offer you a Bitcoin,
[58:36] but you don't know what that Bitcoin
[58:38] will do tomorrow. It may be worth
[58:40] nothing tomorrow. It may be worth more.
[58:42] So, it actually takes faith to receive
[58:45] the Bitcoin, but we as humans can easily
[58:48] receive the Bitcoin because it's
[58:51] something tangible that we think we can
[58:54] move forward with. And now look at this
[58:56] Bible which is clear full of all these
[58:58] promises of God which are in reality
[59:01] much more tangible than a Bitcoin is.
[59:04] And God's offering them to us and we
[59:06] hesitate. We hold back. We don't know
[59:09] whether we should or shouldn't. Do I
[59:11] fully commit to this or do I not? And
[59:13] God is here making an offer. My brother
[59:15] and sister, I tell you what, we got to
[59:18] start recognizing that God's plan for
[59:20] our life is just as solid as solid is of
[59:24] anything on this earth that would be
[59:25] considered solid. God's plan for you,
[59:28] his promise to you is there. It's
[59:31] tangible. Anybody received a promise and
[59:33] saw it manifested in your life and
[59:36] completely come forward and you realize,
[59:38] "Thank you, Lord. I actually reached out
[59:40] and accepted and took a hold of that
[59:42] promise."
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] Because he makes intercession for the
[59:48] saints according to the will of God. And
[59:51] we know that all things work together
[59:53] for good to them that love God. Now, my
[59:56] brother and sister, God knows the heart.
[59:58] So, he knows what is love and what is
[1:00:00] words. That's right.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can hear the words, "I love
[1:00:04] you," but if they're harsh and mean and
[1:00:06] empty, we we can't place value on that.
[1:00:08] But when you hear the words, "I love
[1:00:10] you," and there's sincerity and there's
[1:00:12] depth and there's a foundation to that,
[1:00:14] we hold on to that and say, "There's
[1:00:16] value." Amen. So, it's there he maketh
[1:00:19] intercession and we know that work
[1:00:22] together that love the love of God to
[1:00:24] them who are called according to his
[1:00:25] purpose. See this one scripture ver
[1:00:28] verse 28 is so loaded.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; It is so loaded my brother and sister
[1:00:33] because you see when you recognize that
[1:00:36] everything works together because you
[1:00:38] love God.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; It's not me deciding you love God. It's
[1:00:43] God recognizing you love him. Amen. And
[1:00:46] so it says these things are going to
[1:00:48] work together because you love him. So
[1:00:50] there's a foundational step that is
[1:00:52] going forward just simply because you
[1:00:54] love the Lord. He is starting to put
[1:00:57] everything in order. Amen. He's a master
[1:01:00] at arranging our lives even though we
[1:01:03] sometimes don't think that it is what we
[1:01:06] wanted or is going the way we thought it
[1:01:08] should. But we look see and to them who
[1:01:10] are called according to his purpose.
[1:01:12] Now, I don't know why I'm going to say
[1:01:14] this, but I'll just put it out there. I
[1:01:16] can't fathom how you can have recognized
[1:01:20] ministries in the world today that don't
[1:01:22] believe in predestination. Yeah.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; I I I don't know how they can skip over
[1:01:27] the word. Amen. Just like right here. To
[1:01:30] them who are called according to that
[1:01:34] person's own feelings. No, their own
[1:01:37] motivations.
[1:01:39] No, my brother and sister, they're
[1:01:41] called according to God's purpose. In
[1:01:43] other words, God has said, "I called you
[1:01:45] to fulfill a certain purpose." And it
[1:01:48] wasn't to fill the pew on a church. It
[1:01:50] wasn't to walk down the street and tell
[1:01:52] everybody I'm a Christian with nothing
[1:01:53] to back it up. But to be able to live
[1:01:55] the word day by day, step by step, and
[1:01:58] just do that and be Christ in the flesh
[1:02:00] on the earth today. Not packing a
[1:02:02] billboard, although there's nothing
[1:02:04] wrong with that. Not boasting, my
[1:02:06] brother and sister, although it's good
[1:02:08] to tell the world of what God has done
[1:02:09] for you, but to be able to every day
[1:02:12] just simply live the word according to
[1:02:15] the purpose of the word. Amen.
[1:02:18] Somebody's got to live the truth. Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not all just a story tale. It
[1:02:23] is, my brother and sister, a reality
[1:02:25] that there is humanity living today that
[1:02:28] will live for the Lord and will take a
[1:02:30] rapture.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; A calling, a catching away
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; because they're fulfilling his purpose.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; For who he did forno, that's to know
[1:02:43] previously if you want to use the Paul's
[1:02:46] simplified dictionary. those he did
[1:02:49] previously know. Now, my Bible tells me
[1:02:52] he knew us, you and I, before there was
[1:02:55] even an earth hanging here.
[1:02:58] That's a long time friendship. That's a
[1:03:01] long time relationship.
[1:03:03] Amen. Cuz after all, the earth is
[1:03:05] hundreds of millions of years old, they
[1:03:08] say.
[1:03:10] I don't really care how long how old it
[1:03:12] is. Does it really matter to your
[1:03:14] salvation how old the earth is?
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; No. What it is is the devil is coming in
[1:03:18] there getting people stirred up about
[1:03:20] these details that have nothing to do
[1:03:22] with their salvation. You're not saved
[1:03:25] because the earth is 7,000, 10,000,
[1:03:28] 20,000,
[1:03:30] 50,000 years old. You're not saved
[1:03:32] because of that. You're saved because
[1:03:34] you were chosen him before the
[1:03:36] foundation of the world. Amen. So, it's
[1:03:40] there. He did forno. He did predestinate
[1:03:43] to be. Now, we don't usually like to use
[1:03:46] the word conformed in the way that the
[1:03:48] world sometimes it's like God's making
[1:03:50] me do this. But I want you to understand
[1:03:53] you are actually Sister Carrie, you're
[1:03:55] fair game today. I already got you once.
[1:03:57] Twice won't hurt. God's already coming
[1:04:00] down
[1:04:02] and forming.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; We say conformed. We're not not being
[1:04:07] Yes, we really are.
[1:04:10] As a daughter of God, God's going to
[1:04:12] make circumstance out here,
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; come and form us into who God wants us
[1:04:19] to be.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; We're not going to decide, I'm going to
[1:04:21] be this form. I'm going to be this. I'm
[1:04:23] going to be that. It's God who's
[1:04:25] deciding. And so, he takes our
[1:04:27] circumstances, good and bad, and uses
[1:04:29] them to form us into what he saw us as
[1:04:33] before the foundation of the world.
[1:04:36] Amen. And we were created in his image.
[1:04:39] So we can't be another image.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; We can't for be formed into another
[1:04:44] image. There's only one image that we
[1:04:47] can be formed into. And that's the image
[1:04:49] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he's not making every one of
[1:04:53] us look alike like we were pressed in a
[1:04:55] mold and come out. But he's looking at
[1:04:57] the spirit man. And he's looking on the
[1:04:59] inside. And the inside can only have one
[1:05:02] image, my brother and sister. And we're
[1:05:04] being molded into that image.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Doesn't that make you excited? I get
[1:05:08] excited just thinking about that.
[1:05:11] Be conformed to the image of his son
[1:05:13] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:05:15] many brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[1:05:17] predestinate, them he also called.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And whom he called, he justified.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; And whom he justified
[1:05:29] them,
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; he also glorified.
[1:05:34] Amen. There's not a human on earth that
[1:05:36] doesn't like a little bit of attention,
[1:05:38] doesn't like a little recognition for,
[1:05:40] you know, who they are and maybe
[1:05:41] something they accomplished, right? Come
[1:05:44] on, let's be let's be honest.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; You know, we we we just that's a human
[1:05:48] nature.
[1:05:50] But who do we want to glorify us?
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Do we want the world to glorify us? My
[1:05:57] brother and sister, if you are, you're
[1:05:59] being molded into the image of Lucifer.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the simple truth of it.
[1:06:03] If that the world is where you find your
[1:06:05] glory, there's a molding and it's called
[1:06:08] Lucifer. Now you look at this. See, to
[1:06:11] be glorified,
[1:06:14] God is molding you and I to this place.
[1:06:16] We've just seen that in the scripture.
[1:06:18] And he's bringing us to a place that
[1:06:20] when he pours himself, being glorified,
[1:06:23] it's not all what we think it is. It's
[1:06:24] not our name in the marquee. It's not
[1:06:26] our name announced to the whole world,
[1:06:29] but it's when he comes down and puts
[1:06:32] himself into us and gives us that stamp
[1:06:35] of acceptance. Amen. Well done, my good
[1:06:38] and faithful servant. There's your
[1:06:39] glorification right there. There's where
[1:06:41] God is glorifying you is when he finds
[1:06:43] you accepted in the beloved. There's the
[1:06:46] glory that we're looking for. Amen. Now,
[1:06:49] just as a side note, the rich young
[1:06:51] ruler had everything on earth that he
[1:06:54] possibly could have wanted,
[1:06:56] and he ends up in a state that all he
[1:06:58] wants is a finger dipped in some water.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Like I said, I feel dehydrated or
[1:07:08] something today,
[1:07:10] but I want something more than my finger
[1:07:13] dipped in this to satisfy my thirst.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:18] And the rich young ruler, see, when he
[1:07:20] thought he had it all, he had nothing.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; And Lazarus, who had nothing,
[1:07:27] had it all.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; You see, my brother and sister, we need
[1:07:31] to make sure that the one priority we
[1:07:33] have on this earth is Jesus Christ.
[1:07:36] Amen. Is his word in our life being
[1:07:38] manifested out? Not to boast. Amen. It
[1:07:42] doesn't matter rich or poor, my brother
[1:07:44] and sister. It's there. You know, I
[1:07:46] always thought the joke about the man
[1:07:47] showing up to heaven carrying his
[1:07:49] wheelbarrow of of gold and St. Peter
[1:07:52] asked him, "Why are you bringing
[1:07:53] pavement?"
[1:07:55] You see, we got this idea that gold is
[1:07:57] so important, but it's not anything of
[1:08:00] value in the kingdom of God.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has the riches. He has the
[1:08:05] cattle on a thousand hills. Amen. 10,000
[1:08:08] hills, a 100,000 hills, a million hills.
[1:08:11] He's the one who controls it all. And
[1:08:13] yet we feel like we've achieved
[1:08:15] something
[1:08:17] if we just actually have one cow on the
[1:08:19] hill.
[1:08:23] But he glorifies.
[1:08:25] And what shall we then say to these
[1:08:27] things? We can sum it up in verse 31.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; If God be for us,
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; who can be against us?
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. to be able to sit here today and
[1:08:38] say that we know as a matter of fact in
[1:08:41] our hearts God is with us. Amen. That's
[1:08:44] what really matters. It's not to say
[1:08:46] we've been here, we've done that,
[1:08:48] accomplish this. My brother and sister,
[1:08:50] we never want to come to the place that
[1:08:52] we think our works will ever get us
[1:08:54] there. Yet God asks us to take action on
[1:08:57] the word which can be misconstrued as
[1:08:59] works.
[1:09:10] I feel embarrassed here, but
[1:09:20] absolutely no other place to be
[1:09:22] glorified than in the will of God.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we have to come down.
[1:09:26] Whether you're happy with your
[1:09:28] circumstance right now or not, you have
[1:09:31] to recognize if you're a son or daughter
[1:09:33] of God, God's plan is perfect.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; In the invisible union of the bride.
[1:09:48] Oh God, knowing seeing how fragile we
[1:09:50] are, knowing that we're walking on the
[1:09:52] brittle threads of life of this mortal
[1:09:54] life, not knowing what time that we're
[1:09:56] going to be summoned to answer on high,
[1:09:58] let us, oh Lord, lay aside everything in
[1:10:01] our heart, everything in our mind, and
[1:10:04] look straight to your word tonight
[1:10:07] for you to come and interpret it with
[1:10:10] living oracles. Granted, may your spirit
[1:10:14] fall upon us and anoint the word to our
[1:10:16] heart that we might go from here this
[1:10:19] evening, I say this morning, better
[1:10:21] people than we are now, that we might
[1:10:24] have a closer insight on Jesus Christ.
[1:10:27] Grant it, Lord, that we might understand
[1:10:29] the day that we're living in. Now, I
[1:10:32] want to stop right here and insert a
[1:10:33] little bit of a thought. My brother and
[1:10:35] sister, when we say we recognize the day
[1:10:37] we're living in, do you realize that
[1:10:39] every demon spirit that has been down
[1:10:42] through the history of mankind is
[1:10:44] present today against you? Every spirit
[1:10:47] that ever opposed it, that gerra uh of
[1:10:50] the Pharisee spirits, all of those
[1:10:53] spirits have come right down and they
[1:10:56] are facing you today. Not oh, one over
[1:10:59] here and one over there, but every
[1:11:01] spirit present to torment you. And we
[1:11:04] wonder sometimes why we struggle, why we
[1:11:07] feel maybe I I hate to even use the word
[1:11:09] in the house of God, but we feel
[1:11:11] depressed and we feel overwhelmed and we
[1:11:13] feel anxiety and we have a tinge of fear
[1:11:17] is because every spirit that's out here
[1:11:19] is opposed to you now because the word
[1:11:22] of God shows that we have come down to
[1:11:24] the end of time and he's here and he's
[1:11:27] putting it out just like a team would
[1:11:29] get desperate coming as a clock winds
[1:11:31] down. We've got to score. And there's
[1:11:34] one more out here somewhere that I can
[1:11:36] pull out of the hand of God. There's one
[1:11:39] more out here that I can deceive.
[1:11:41] There's one more out here that I can
[1:11:44] cause them to be distracted long enough.
[1:11:46] And there's one more, my brother and
[1:11:48] sister. As the word shows us very
[1:11:50] clearly, the foolish virgin. My brother
[1:11:52] and sister, you could not touch their
[1:11:54] life. Don't get an idea that the people
[1:11:56] were living on the edge of the will of
[1:11:58] God. The only thing they were missing
[1:12:00] was a desperation to be filled with the
[1:12:03] Holy Ghost.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; That was the thing that they missed. So
[1:12:06] the distraction come and took them away
[1:12:08] from that. This come family problems,
[1:12:11] financial problems, a social problem,
[1:12:14] whatever that might be. And all of these
[1:12:16] things were nothing but distractions.
[1:12:18] They were not mountains to stop you.
[1:12:20] They were distractions that Satan put in
[1:12:22] your path.
[1:12:24] And we as humans
[1:12:26] squirrel
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; and we never come back to our original
[1:12:32] thought.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; How many times have you been talking to
[1:12:34] somebody? I find it humorous because I
[1:12:36] do it all the time. Yeah. Da da da da da
[1:12:39] da da da da da. And somebody says
[1:12:43] something and you're like, yeah. And you
[1:12:46] go to come back to your thought.
[1:12:49] What was I talking about?
[1:12:52] I see some of you are too young to be
[1:12:54] nodding your head,
[1:12:56] but as you get older, it becomes more
[1:12:59] more obvious. Maybe maybe the young
[1:13:02] people can push rewind and research and
[1:13:06] again and catch it, but you can
[1:13:08] literally come to a point you can't
[1:13:10] remember what you were talking about.
[1:13:11] Now, I'm telling you, let me bring this
[1:13:13] down. Here you are. Your thoughts going
[1:13:15] through your mind. You are you are
[1:13:17] praying. You're thinking about the
[1:13:18] things of God. you're you're do and and
[1:13:21] something distracts you
[1:13:23] and Satan will throw another one and
[1:13:25] another one because he doesn't want you
[1:13:26] coming back to these thoughts that will
[1:13:29] deliver you.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Coming back to these thoughts that bring
[1:13:32] liberty to you, bring joy to you. He'll
[1:13:35] just keep bombarding you. If you don't
[1:13:37] think so, just start recording it. Go to
[1:13:39] pray and see how many times your phone
[1:13:41] rings. Amen. You got a guy trying to
[1:13:43] sell you carpet. How do you even know I
[1:13:46] need carpet? I don't need carpet.
[1:13:48] Goodbye. You try to get down and pray
[1:13:50] again. Somebody calls you up. This guy
[1:13:52] calls me from California all the time.
[1:13:54] Hi Paul. Like he's my friend. Hi Paul.
[1:13:57] You need any tools yet? Now I told you
[1:14:00] last time don't call me. Oh, I didn't
[1:14:02] take you serious.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Well, take me serious this time.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; 30 days later. Hi Paul. Do you need any
[1:14:12] tools? That's the devil.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; He's going to sell you something. He's
[1:14:17] going to keep trying, keep trying, keep
[1:14:19] trying cuz he's convinced he can sell
[1:14:21] you something.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; And we got to keep just sweeping him out
[1:14:29] the door,
[1:14:31] beating him off the screen door.
[1:14:34] Amen. Now look, my brother and sister,
[1:14:37] what Satan is doing is a tried andrue
[1:14:40] method.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; He's seen it bring results so many
[1:14:45] times. He's not going to stop.
[1:14:50] So what do you have to do?
[1:14:53] You have to learn his ways.
[1:14:58] You know, I was doing some reading the
[1:15:00] other day.
[1:15:02] And uh they were talking about target
[1:15:04] points. Everybody's got their own
[1:15:06] wording on this.
[1:15:08] And the man is uh was they used anam
[1:15:11] example was a manager and he had some
[1:15:14] employees that just infuriated him
[1:15:19] and he realized it was undermining his
[1:15:21] position as a manager and he went and
[1:15:23] said how can I deal with this went to
[1:15:26] talk to I don't know what they were
[1:15:29] counselor
[1:15:32] and the counselor said it's very simple
[1:15:36] you just look for the target points
[1:15:39] cuz the same or they use the word
[1:15:41] trigger points cuz the devil
[1:15:44] you notice I didn't say your husband
[1:15:46] your wife your children your boss your
[1:15:49] it's the devil
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; knows your trigger point
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; better than you do
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; and he'll come right down at the right
[1:16:00] time and he just reaches over there
[1:16:05] and there it goes
[1:16:08] You know how we deal with Satan? Oh no,
[1:16:12] we're not going to throw ourselves down,
[1:16:13] start screaming, "SATAN, GET BEHIND ME.
[1:16:15] I'M A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD."
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; That won't do a thing. He'll listen to
[1:16:20] you squall all day long,
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; but be able to recognize that's just
[1:16:26] Satan.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Now, we believe we have authority to
[1:16:35] bind Satan, right?
[1:16:37] We should, every one of us here should
[1:16:39] believe we have the authority to bind
[1:16:40] Satan.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Do you do a better job of binding him if
[1:16:44] you scream?
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Can you bind him from the words coming
[1:16:52] from your heart?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Because you see, this is not flesh and
[1:17:02] blood warfare.
[1:17:04] is his principalities and powers of
[1:17:06] darkness.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Satan, get behind me.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; And he'll ask you, "Why do I need to get
[1:17:13] behind you?"
[1:17:16] And all you need to do is use the very
[1:17:18] tried and true.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; That's been through the ages.
[1:17:22] It is written.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; You don't need to explain the vials, the
[1:17:27] seals, the thunders. You don't need to
[1:17:28] be able to take it from Genesis to
[1:17:30] Revelation. You just be able to come as
[1:17:32] a son of God and say, "Daughter of God,
[1:17:34] it's written."
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; And you know the word just as well as I
[1:17:37] do, Satan, you're bound. So when we'll
[1:17:40] do that, we'll find, amen, that when his
[1:17:43] spirit falls and anoints the word to our
[1:17:45] heart, we might go from here this
[1:17:47] evening better people because we have a
[1:17:50] promise and we have the reassurance of
[1:17:52] what he's already promised us to do. And
[1:17:55] so we can understand the day that we're
[1:17:57] living in. It's a age of spiritual
[1:18:00] warfare, my brother and sister. You're
[1:18:02] seeing it brought out a clash all
[1:18:04] physical, all this realm, all of that.
[1:18:07] You say, "Well, well, you know, Israel,
[1:18:08] are they right or wrong in Gaza?" I
[1:18:10] don't know. But there's a promise in the
[1:18:12] word that come from way, way, way back,
[1:18:15] my brother and sister. That will never
[1:18:17] be satisfied till the end time of the
[1:18:20] warfare that is there. Amen. And it's
[1:18:22] going to happen. It will happen. And the
[1:18:25] warfare, now let me just take this as an
[1:18:27] example. The warfare you're facing as a
[1:18:30] Christian today is not going to stop.
[1:18:34] In fact, Satan's going to get his
[1:18:36] toenails dug in and it's going to
[1:18:38] intensify every opportunity he gets
[1:18:40] because as there's still time, he still
[1:18:43] knows he has time.
[1:18:47] So, you're going to have to just kind of
[1:18:49] get used to that and confident in that.
[1:18:52] I rebuke you, Satan.
[1:18:54] get thee behind me because there's your
[1:18:57] warfare. It is written
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; now. It work for Jesus. You say that's
[1:19:01] too simple. Well, it worked for our Lord
[1:19:02] Jesus. And if it worked for him, it'll
[1:19:04] work for you. Amen. So that we might
[1:19:08] understand the day we're living.
[1:19:10] Preparation
[1:19:11] of God for his people in this hour. In
[1:19:15] my notes, it's very bold, like three
[1:19:18] times the size of the print. The
[1:19:19] preparation of God for this hour. God
[1:19:22] didn't leave us here unprepared.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; God has a word. He's been bringing that
[1:19:28] word to us through the years. Laying it
[1:19:30] in, laying it in, laying it in. And it's
[1:19:33] a preparation for the warfare and the
[1:19:35] circumstances that we face today. You
[1:19:37] say, "I don't feel prepared." Let me
[1:19:39] tell you, you are. Amen. As a son or
[1:19:41] daughter of God, you've been studying
[1:19:43] the word. You've been praying. You've
[1:19:44] been living it. God is filling a
[1:19:46] preparation. And you say, "But it feels
[1:19:48] like I'm in a battle and onslaught." You
[1:19:50] are, but you're going to come out of
[1:19:52] that battle victorious. You are not
[1:19:54] going to suck because Satan said so. No,
[1:19:58] God said so first.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, God anointed us not only be
[1:20:05] speaker but hear together. Make our
[1:20:07] hearts tremble at your word. For the
[1:20:08] fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[1:20:10] Grant these things, Father, for we ask
[1:20:12] it in Jesus name. Amen. Part of a
[1:20:14] prayer. Now you look at that and realize
[1:20:16] my brother and sister that this
[1:20:18] preparation that the word is talking
[1:20:20] about that has been presented to us, it
[1:20:24] is the word living in you. Amen. It's
[1:20:27] not whether you are a theologian. It
[1:20:29] doesn't matter how much scripture you
[1:20:31] can quote. Amen. I I've personally
[1:20:33] experienced many people that could quote
[1:20:36] scripture to you and then they would rip
[1:20:38] you off right on the heels of that with
[1:20:41] a brother deal. Amen. Anybody interested
[1:20:43] in the brother deal?
[1:20:50] Praise God. We're brothers
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; and
[1:20:55] all things in common, right?
[1:20:58] So, I would like to have your common
[1:21:00] part of your wallet,
[1:21:02] my brother and sister, that No. Come on.
[1:21:06] Come on. The word is not here for us to
[1:21:09] be caught up in a carnal anointing of a
[1:21:12] carnal uh multi-level marketing of a
[1:21:14] carnal get-richqu, a carnal blah blah
[1:21:17] blah. We are here as sons and daughters
[1:21:20] of God to be filled up. Yes, we are
[1:21:23] brothers. And you know what that really
[1:21:24] means, brothers and sisters? That means
[1:21:26] in the battlefield, I've got your back
[1:21:28] and you've got my back. Amen. It's not
[1:21:30] I've got your wallet. Amen. I've got
[1:21:33] your back. My prayers will surround you
[1:21:35] and I have confidence that you your
[1:21:37] prayers will surround me. I didn't put
[1:21:39] the quote in but it was there that when
[1:21:41] a people come to the place that they do
[1:21:43] not trust one another, brother Random
[1:21:45] says that church is finished.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; And call it any relationship you want.
[1:21:52] When we can no longer trust that is
[1:21:54] brother Brandham doesn't say so just let
[1:21:56] that be. He says no let God come in and
[1:21:59] reestablish that trust. Let him fortify
[1:22:02] that and bring us to where we're one
[1:22:04] happy family in the Lord once again.
[1:22:07] That we can stand together and have our
[1:22:09] sword and our shield and be there
[1:22:11] faithful to battle for one another,
[1:22:13] praying for each other's needs. My
[1:22:16] brother and sister, this is what we're
[1:22:17] doing. We don't give up that easy. I
[1:22:20] tell you, if we're going to give up that
[1:22:21] easy, we might as well just quit right
[1:22:23] now. Amen. Because it'll only be a
[1:22:25] matter of a point on the calendar that
[1:22:26] you decide to quit. We're not quitters.
[1:22:29] We're here. We believe the word. We're
[1:22:31] standing on the word and we are going to
[1:22:32] have trust in one another. Fiery trials,
[1:22:35] we'll have them too, but we will have
[1:22:37] trust in one another. Amen. This is the
[1:22:40] body of Christ that has been prepared
[1:22:42] for us. Amen. Now, the Lord's
[1:22:45] preparation.
[1:22:47] I want to ask you straight up.
[1:22:50] I want you to look at your plans
[1:22:53] and I want to ask you, do they fit God's
[1:22:55] plans? Right?
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; That's really a key that we need to
[1:22:59] solve or settle in our lives. Is the
[1:23:02] direction I'm going in my life. Does
[1:23:04] that fit what God wants me to do?
[1:23:08] Because we can be almost anything
[1:23:10] without the Lord, but you won't be
[1:23:13] blessed.
[1:23:15] He's not going to glorify our work
[1:23:17] that's outside of his word. So, we need
[1:23:20] to know what we're doing. Amen. Just as
[1:23:24] we are taught to pray for revelation, we
[1:23:27] should pray to know the will of God in
[1:23:30] our life.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And maybe we could tuck that right
[1:23:34] under the title or the heading of
[1:23:36] Revelation. Let it be revealed to you
[1:23:38] God's perfect will for your life. Amen.
[1:23:44] Because once again, without being
[1:23:45] redundant, I want to say, can we realize
[1:23:48] that we'll never find the glory in our
[1:23:51] plans that we'll find in God's plans?
[1:23:56] Be glorified, my brother and sister, in
[1:23:59] oursel.
[1:24:00] Yes, we'll pick on some of those guys
[1:24:03] that have done quite well in their life.
[1:24:05] We could we could look at these guys
[1:24:07] that are in the headlines.
[1:24:10] They they created computers. They own
[1:24:13] multitudes of real estate. Uh they have
[1:24:17] mass marketing under their belt and and
[1:24:20] people glorify them. They talk about how
[1:24:22] big their yacht is. They talk about how
[1:24:24] big their airplane is, how big their
[1:24:26] house is. People look at that and they
[1:24:29] idolize that. But my brother and sister,
[1:24:31] there's a whole another group of people
[1:24:33] that come over here. And this might you
[1:24:35] might think I'm being harsh here, but
[1:24:37] you'll find in the religious world the
[1:24:39] very same attributes. Oh, their church
[1:24:42] is so big. They have tens of thousands
[1:24:45] of followings. They have a jet airplane.
[1:24:47] They have all of this. And then on the
[1:24:49] back side of the desert is a little man,
[1:24:51] a little woman, a son, or a daughter
[1:24:53] that is consecrated to God doing their
[1:24:55] best to live for the Lord. And I want to
[1:24:57] ask you if you can solve the riddle this
[1:24:59] morning of which one of those God's
[1:25:01] going to glorify.
[1:25:03] Amen. It's not going to be what we
[1:25:05] glorify in the human element, but it's
[1:25:07] going to be what God glorifies. And I
[1:25:09] say, Lord, if I need to be poor to be
[1:25:11] glorified, then let me be poor. If I
[1:25:14] need to be sick, Lord, to you be
[1:25:16] glorified, then let me be sick, Lord.
[1:25:19] Whatever it takes for you to be
[1:25:20] glorified in me is what I long for. And
[1:25:23] you say, "Do you really want to be
[1:25:25] sick?" No, I don't really want to be
[1:25:26] sick, but I want to be glorified more
[1:25:29] than I care about what this life is. I
[1:25:31] want to please God. I want to hear those
[1:25:33] words, well done.
[1:25:36] Because after all, if the scripture is
[1:25:39] true,
[1:25:41] did I just say that?
[1:25:44] If the scripture is true,
[1:25:47] let me finish it.
[1:25:50] It's all going to burn anyhow.
[1:25:54] And we care so much for this stuff that
[1:25:57] a scientific matter would be called
[1:25:59] carbon displacement.
[1:26:03] We care so much for it
[1:26:06] and your soul is worth 10,000 worlds. I
[1:26:09] give you young people a challenge. Maybe
[1:26:10] you own a better calculator than I do. I
[1:26:13] literally sat down one day with
[1:26:15] encyclopedia that we have is a few years
[1:26:17] old, but I figured that was close
[1:26:18] enough. It listed all the nations on the
[1:26:22] earth at that particular time. And it
[1:26:25] listed the gross national product of
[1:26:28] every nation on earth at that time.
[1:26:32] I didn't make it through like 10
[1:26:35] nations before my calculator said it was
[1:26:38] too large to compute.
[1:26:41] 10 out of 200 and some.
[1:26:45] And the calculator can't calculate.
[1:26:48] And your soul is worth 10,000
[1:26:52] times the total.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; And we think so little of ourselves.
[1:26:59] Lord, I'm not able. Lord, I'm not
[1:27:02] capable. Lord, I can't.
[1:27:05] You see where we're putting ourselves,
[1:27:07] saints? Come on, somebody smile at me so
[1:27:10] I I won't think you're all okay. Thank
[1:27:12] you.
[1:27:16] Now, just think about this. Now, we
[1:27:19] realize God knew Lucifer's heart from
[1:27:21] the very beginning. It wasn't a shock,
[1:27:28] but just humor me for a moment.
[1:27:32] Lucifer is sitting there.
[1:27:35] He's got his glory calculator out
[1:27:39] and he's like, you know, if I was the
[1:27:42] head of all of this,
[1:27:44] I would receive all this glory.
[1:27:48] But if I was just a faithful servant to
[1:27:51] Almighty God, he gets the glory.
[1:27:57] Let's have a coup.
[1:28:00] Let's overthrow the angels cuz I want
[1:28:03] the glory.
[1:28:05] Now you look at the short term. I think
[1:28:07] right now you don't have to look very
[1:28:10] far to see Satan is glorified right and
[1:28:12] left. I mean from A to Z he is glorified
[1:28:18] but let's remember God always looks at
[1:28:20] the finished work right that's why you
[1:28:22] don't look at this outer flesh you look
[1:28:24] at the heart and God looks at your heart
[1:28:26] so don't judge yourself because your
[1:28:28] flesh maybe has suffered but judge the
[1:28:31] finished work so if Lucifer had moved on
[1:28:35] down and saw that if under serving God
[1:28:40] that he would receive glory
[1:28:43] by being a part of God's plan.
[1:28:48] But let's look at the end. Is there any
[1:28:50] glory being cast in the pit?
[1:28:53] There's nothing glorious about that.
[1:28:56] See, he looks so shortterm. I am trying
[1:28:59] to make a point. You look so shortterm,
[1:29:04] you don't feel glorified.
[1:29:07] You feel like you're a failure. You feel
[1:29:09] like you're too weak. you you feel a lot
[1:29:11] of things. I want you to stop looking
[1:29:15] over the end of the hood and look off
[1:29:17] down into eternity what God promised.
[1:29:20] Amen. He promised that you and I would
[1:29:22] be glorified and we're going to be
[1:29:24] living in his presence, the King of
[1:29:26] Kings, the Lord of Lords, Almighty.
[1:29:29] Amen. And if the Almighty is in us, then
[1:29:32] we're going to be living there in the
[1:29:34] realm of the Almighty. And we're going
[1:29:36] to be glorified in that realm. and
[1:29:38] everything you ever desired in your
[1:29:40] heart will be manifested then at that
[1:29:43] time and you'll look at this and see so
[1:29:45] Satan thought I I'll get more glory by
[1:29:48] making myself preeminent but he couldn't
[1:29:50] see the glory of being part of God's
[1:29:52] plan and I tell you my brother and
[1:29:54] sister we'll come here today and we'll
[1:29:57] look at this now perfect strength
[1:29:59] perfect weakness amen you look how this
[1:30:01] is now and we would see brother Isaac
[1:30:04] perfect strength perfect weakness amen
[1:30:07] We try to make our weakness excuses.
[1:30:11] Anybody here guilty? Feel free to lift a
[1:30:14] hand. Amen. We use our weakness as an
[1:30:19] excuse.
[1:30:21] How many times I can't.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. Excuses should no longer be
[1:30:28] accepted. We want to tell how big we
[1:30:31] are, how great we are. I think it that's
[1:30:34] one of the things that God gave me the
[1:30:36] text for was to get that out of your
[1:30:38] mind. Out of our mind. See, there's
[1:30:40] little things that we do. That's what we
[1:30:42] come to church for is to find out where
[1:30:45] our fault is. Oh man, it's going to
[1:30:48] change my preaching forever. Let's see.
[1:30:49] I'm going to have to I don't know.
[1:30:53] Yeah. Turn on my fault finder.
[1:30:57] Oh, this is for electricity. We'll see
[1:30:59] if it works anyway.
[1:31:14] But that's what we come for. Not to find
[1:31:18] fault with you,
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; but for our faults to be revealed to us.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; That we could realize
[1:31:26] there's little things in my life that
[1:31:29] don't quite line up. The little things
[1:31:33] that we do, that's what we come to
[1:31:35] church for, is to find out where our
[1:31:37] faults is. The things that we might
[1:31:38] better ourselves by. Now, this is not
[1:31:41] self-help making oursel better. Amen. If
[1:31:44] we come to church for any other
[1:31:46] objective than this, I'm afraid we won't
[1:31:48] get too much out of coming to church. We
[1:31:50] must come to find our weaknesses, to
[1:31:52] find our bad places, and see how little
[1:31:55] we are, and put our trust in somebody
[1:31:58] that's strong. But when we have
[1:32:00] weaknesses, there's so many of us likes
[1:32:03] to testify or likes to think that we're
[1:32:06] insufficient and therefore we make that
[1:32:08] an excuse. I have no education. I have
[1:32:10] no ability. I love it when we were over
[1:32:13] there in the conference there in the
[1:32:14] Netherlands. I loved it when they got up
[1:32:16] and sang that song that God does not
[1:32:18] call the qualified. He qualifies the
[1:32:21] called.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't care whether you're
[1:32:24] qualified or not. He'll qualify you
[1:32:27] after he calls you. Amen. He's not
[1:32:30] looking for the greatest of talent, but
[1:32:32] he's looking at the voice that is
[1:32:34] sincere, sung from the heart. He's
[1:32:36] looking at the one who says, "Lord, my
[1:32:38] whole objective is you." Amen. We have
[1:32:41] our weakness. So many testify or likes
[1:32:44] to think we're insufficient. I like how
[1:32:46] he puts that in. We like to think we are
[1:32:49] insufficient.
[1:32:51] Now, I don't mean to be too personal.
[1:33:00] Maybe you lift a hand, maybe you won't.
[1:33:03] I'm not worthy.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Comes right out of our mouth.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; As though God didn't know that,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; but he called you anyhow.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't call you because you was
[1:33:22] worthy.
[1:33:23] He called you because he's going to make
[1:33:26] you worthy. He's going to manifest his
[1:33:29] life in you and make you worthy. So, we
[1:33:31] need to get the idea in our head that I
[1:33:33] I can't do this because I'm not worthy.
[1:33:36] I can't Well, let me just focus on this.
[1:33:38] I can't sing a special I don't have a
[1:33:39] good voice. Did God say there was a
[1:33:41] certain qualification for a voice?
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; No. Only sincerity.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[1:33:49] have you ever been around Oh, why I'm on
[1:33:51] this one? I might as well just go ahead
[1:33:53] and stomp on a little. Ever been around
[1:33:55] somebody, I'm not talking about real
[1:33:57] legit. You know, you got things you want
[1:33:59] prayer requests. I've been around some
[1:34:00] folks that you can't hold the
[1:34:02] conversation with them. If you're around
[1:34:04] them for eight hours, you have eight
[1:34:06] hours of what is wrong in their life.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, I'd rather have
[1:34:13] eight hours worth of wrong in my life
[1:34:15] and take five minutes and testify my
[1:34:17] God's in control.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which one's going to bring you a
[1:34:21] result? Which one's going to bless you?
[1:34:25] Because after all, your body's going to
[1:34:26] obey your confession.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; It's all wrong. It's all wrong. It's all
[1:34:30] wrong. It's all wrong. How about my
[1:34:32] God's in control?
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; There's a few hiccups, a few potholes, a
[1:34:35] few things here. Amen. The old car is
[1:34:38] only running on five cylinders out of
[1:34:40] eight. You know, the tires are bald, but
[1:34:42] praise God, I'm going to glory.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[1:34:48] I have no education. I have no ability.
[1:34:50] I'm unable to do this. If you keep that
[1:34:53] up and do it that way, keep going like
[1:34:55] that, then you can't amount to anything.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; You talk about self-fulfilling prophecy.
[1:35:04] I can't live an overcoming life. You
[1:35:06] won't.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; I can't help in the church. You won't.
[1:35:16] Boy, this might be a good time. Praise
[1:35:19] God.
[1:35:21] Who wants to go pick up all the leaves?
[1:35:24] I'm sorry. I got a cow in the ditch.
[1:35:31] Don't have enough time. I'm so busy.
[1:35:34] I can suggest a couple books in the
[1:35:36] bookstore for you if you don't have
[1:35:37] enough time in your life. And the end of
[1:35:40] it all says, "If you don't recognize how
[1:35:43] much time you waste, you don't recognize
[1:35:46] how much time you have."
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. Where's Paul at? I'm out in the
[1:35:52] bushes here. I'm out in the bushes.
[1:35:55] Amen.
[1:35:57] God uses that very thing to tackle the
[1:36:02] job with.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; In other words, he didn't need your
[1:36:06] ability. He just needed you.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; See, he waits for us to get to that
[1:36:12] condition so he can use us. We take the
[1:36:15] excuse and say, "Well, I I I'm I'm can't
[1:36:18] do this. I'm insufficient. I can't do
[1:36:20] it." God takes that very thing to do the
[1:36:22] job with. That's true. That's the reason
[1:36:25] why he chooses us because we're in that
[1:36:28] condition.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you were so perfect, Amen.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't be able to use you.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now
[1:36:44] I've kind of preached 2 Corinthians 12
[1:36:46] there. We'll move on. Now
[1:36:50] I want to close up with this
[1:36:54] in the token.
[1:36:56] We'll see right here. Notice then the
[1:36:58] preparation
[1:37:00] for his promised land people.
[1:37:04] Now, not a preparation for just anybody.
[1:37:08] There'll be many people, and this come
[1:37:09] across very pointed. I'm sorry if it
[1:37:11] does. Not anybody's going to walk in and
[1:37:14] accept these words,
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; but you do.
[1:37:19] And God has made it very clear that you
[1:37:22] were chosen, that you were called
[1:37:24] according to scripture, not according to
[1:37:26] some man out here, but according to the
[1:37:28] word, that you were chosen and called.
[1:37:30] And so God is doing a preparation for
[1:37:33] his promised land people. Amen. God
[1:37:37] knows who are his own. Amen. If he
[1:37:39] doesn't, then he's not God.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; But he does. Notice what he did. First,
[1:37:43] he had a people that he had made a land
[1:37:46] for them.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; There's a land beyond the river that we
[1:37:52] call the sweet forever.
[1:37:55] You've got a land. It's been made for
[1:37:57] you. You're not going to get there. and
[1:38:00] see all the heathens running around the
[1:38:03] land. You're not going to ever have to,
[1:38:06] brothers, come into a place, a store or
[1:38:09] a a shopping uh center or something and
[1:38:12] and walk and look at the floor tiles.
[1:38:15] Amen. It reminds me of a brother one
[1:38:17] time. He says, "This where we live is so
[1:38:19] bad." He said, "I know. I don't even
[1:38:21] have to look up. I can walk in the door
[1:38:23] of the store and it's 41 tiles. Turn
[1:38:26] left. It's 27 tiles. Look at the shelf.
[1:38:29] Get the loaf of bread. Turn around and
[1:38:32] repeat. Go over this so many steps. Turn
[1:38:34] here in the cash register cuz it's so
[1:38:37] bad you can't even raise your head. The
[1:38:41] indecency is everywhere.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; That's not going to be in this land that
[1:38:45] is our promised land. Amen. We're going
[1:38:48] to go there. We're going to rejoice
[1:38:49] amongst the saints, amongst the
[1:38:51] believers, the presence of God. Going to
[1:38:53] have such liberty. Who's looking forward
[1:38:55] to that? Amen. We should with all of our
[1:38:58] heart be saying that's what I'm looking
[1:39:00] for. I'm looking for that land.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; First he had a people. He made a land
[1:39:06] for them. And he prepared a land for
[1:39:08] them. And now he sent down their
[1:39:10] preparation for it for the promised land
[1:39:13] people. It was only for those who were
[1:39:15] predestinated to that promised land.
[1:39:18] Bride day.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Who's looking for bride day? I tell you,
[1:39:21] I'm looking for bride day. I'm looking
[1:39:23] for when the Lord comes and wraps
[1:39:25] himself around it and said, "My
[1:39:26] beloved." I'm not talking about in a
[1:39:28] spiritual sense, but to be right there
[1:39:30] in the presence of our Lord. Amen. And
[1:39:33] how he done it, he sent a prophet with a
[1:39:35] message identified by a pillar of fire.
[1:39:37] Gave a token that they could rest
[1:39:39] assured that it was right. It was her
[1:39:42] consolation.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love that. I tell you, it's
[1:39:45] coming a time we got a consolation of
[1:39:47] what God has called us to. We've got
[1:39:49] that consolation that God gives a
[1:39:51] promise and he keeps his promise. His
[1:39:53] word cannot fall to the ground. It never
[1:39:56] will. Amen. And you look through the
[1:39:59] scripture and you'll find the scripture
[1:40:01] actually talks about that of those whose
[1:40:03] words never fell to the earth. Prophets
[1:40:06] that words never fell to the earth. Men
[1:40:09] who spoke and their word never fell to
[1:40:11] the earth. If a man could live that way
[1:40:13] and be recorded in scripture, how so the
[1:40:16] bride of Jesus Christ can live in this
[1:40:18] day and our words will never fall to the
[1:40:21] earth. It might look like we come short.
[1:40:23] It might look like we fail, but we're
[1:40:25] looking through our eyes. Why don't we
[1:40:27] stop and look through God's eyes? And
[1:40:29] God's eyes says, "My word can't return
[1:40:30] void." That means what he deposited in
[1:40:33] you cannot fail. It cannot fall to the
[1:40:35] earth. And it cannot be abolished or
[1:40:37] done away with. But that word has to
[1:40:40] return because it's God's word.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We'll close with this.
[1:40:46] Amen.
[1:40:50] Revelations 19 1-9. Some of my favorite
[1:40:54] scripture.
[1:40:56] After these things, I heard a great
[1:40:58] voice of much people in heaven.
[1:41:05] Much people.
[1:41:07] You realize if you have the correct
[1:41:08] revelation, you see yourself
[1:41:12] in that verse right there.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; You are amongst that multitude
[1:41:18] that have a voice in heaven.
[1:41:22] Allelujah. Salvation, glory, and honor,
[1:41:24] and power unto the Lord our God. For
[1:41:27] true and righteous are his judgments.
[1:41:30] For he has judged the great which
[1:41:32] did corrupt the earth with her
[1:41:34] fornication, and hath avenged the blood
[1:41:36] of his servants at her hand." Now, I
[1:41:39] want to just throw something out very
[1:41:40] pointed. I'm sorry to make it this
[1:41:41] pointed, but I'm telling you, it's been
[1:41:43] brought to my attention several people.
[1:41:45] Amen. They want to know what what do you
[1:41:47] think of the fact that the new pope has
[1:41:49] said that there's only one way to
[1:41:51] salvation, and that's through Jesus
[1:41:52] Christ. It's no longer through Mary.
[1:41:57] What do you think about that?
[1:42:04] Have you ever heard
[1:42:06] of the story of the young man who
[1:42:09] wanting to win the girl's heart
[1:42:13] told her what she wanted to hear?
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; That's it. Exactly.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Then after he had his hands on her,
[1:42:21] married her, took possession of her.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Those are old archaic words that are not
[1:42:26] accepted in this day.
[1:42:29] But scripturally, Jerry is my
[1:42:31] possession.
[1:42:33] Yes, sir.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Quite lively possession if you ask me,
[1:42:36] but um still my possession.
[1:42:42] I told her words that even just
[1:42:45] yesterday
[1:42:47] she reminded me. She's going to kill me
[1:42:49] for this, but I'm going to die sooner or
[1:42:51] later anyway. So
[1:42:54] yesterday she just reminded me,
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; why can't you keep your promises?
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, foolishly, at one time I
[1:43:05] told her I would buy. Now, if I ever own
[1:43:07] one, you'll know it's her fault, not
[1:43:08] mine. I told her at one time I'd buy her
[1:43:11] a Mercedes 450 SL convertible, cuz
[1:43:14] that's what she wanted to hear.
[1:43:20] I bought her a Mercedes truck with a
[1:43:22] sunroof.
[1:43:25] That wasn't close enough.
[1:43:28] Now, I made a silly analogy there. But
[1:43:31] you have a pope saying, "No,
[1:43:34] it's not through Mary any longer. It
[1:43:37] only comes through Jesus Christ."
[1:43:42] Can you see what he's doing?
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:45] He's telling them what they want to
[1:43:47] hear.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly right.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Come back.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; There's some Pentecostals already.
[1:43:53] There's a video out there if you look. I
[1:43:55] can't tell you just exactly how to find
[1:43:56] it, but there's Pentecostals went kiss
[1:43:59] the ring and they've stood there and
[1:44:02] said, "Oh, praise God. Such a glorious
[1:44:05] day. We're coming back to mama."
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; You see what's happening?
[1:44:14] telling them what they want to hear.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; sir. That's right.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Can one pope change 2,000 years of
[1:44:25] dogma?
[1:44:27] No.
[1:44:29] No, he can't. You'll find in the fine
[1:44:32] print somewhere,
[1:44:35] you know,
[1:44:37] take this drug. The doctor says it'll
[1:44:40] make you healthy and make you better,
[1:44:41] make you run, jump, make you happy.
[1:44:42] They'll show all these smiling people.
[1:44:44] Then it comes to side effects,
[1:44:48] heart disease,
[1:44:50] kidney problem, liver.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you, you'll find in the
[1:44:55] fine print,
[1:44:57] what the real intent of it is.
[1:45:00] And I want you to look at this because I
[1:45:03] don't play games. I will not be called
[1:45:05] the deceiver.
[1:45:07] You tell me if you can't find yourself
[1:45:10] in those words right there.
[1:45:12] the same words that have been in
[1:45:15] scripture for all these years. And it's
[1:45:20] right there. Amen.
[1:45:23] He's judged them. They corrupted the
[1:45:25] earth. Their fornication, venge the
[1:45:26] blood of his servants. And again, this
[1:45:29] little bride is there saying,
[1:45:31] "Hallelujah." And her smoke rose up. And
[1:45:34] the four and 20 elders and the four
[1:45:36] beasts fell down and worshiped God that
[1:45:37] sat on the throne, saying, "Amen and
[1:45:39] allelujah." And a voice came out of the
[1:45:41] throne saying, "Praise our God."
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Whose voice is that?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; It's you and I, my brother and sister.
[1:45:50] We are there in the throne, not sitting
[1:45:53] around somewhere, not far. We're a part
[1:45:56] of Jesus Christ. That's what the word
[1:45:58] shows us. We're a part of him. We're in
[1:46:00] him. We have his very name. We have his
[1:46:02] very DNA, his very life. And it's there
[1:46:05] that this voice comes out of the throne.
[1:46:07] Praise our God all ye servants and all
[1:46:09] ye that fear both strength and the
[1:46:11] marriage of supper of the lamb. Amen. It
[1:46:15] has come. It's here right here now. My
[1:46:19] brother and sister, look at this. We are
[1:46:21] a part of this whole place. The voice
[1:46:23] that's in the throne and us being there
[1:46:26] to worship before the throne. It's all a
[1:46:28] manifestation of God in his word coming
[1:46:31] forth in this day to declare to you and
[1:46:33] I, keep coming. Keep coming. Come on a
[1:46:36] little higher. Come on a little higher.
[1:46:38] Come a little closer. Come on up. Rise
[1:46:41] up. Amen. Because God sitting there
[1:46:44] putting that th voice in the throne was
[1:46:46] to declare the very word that's in the
[1:46:48] heart of sons and daughters of God. It's
[1:46:50] not another voice. It's not another
[1:46:52] people. It's not another age. It's God
[1:46:54] himself speaking to the bride of Christ.
[1:46:57] Amen. For the marriage. And I heard as
[1:46:59] it were a voice of a great multitude,
[1:47:01] and as a voice of many waters, and as a
[1:47:04] voice of mighty thundering, saying,
[1:47:05] "Hallelujah! For the Lord God omnipotent
[1:47:08] reignth." Let us, oh my brother and
[1:47:11] sister, come on, let's lift our voices
[1:47:13] today. Amen. Let us be glad and rejoice
[1:47:16] and give honor to him.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give honor to him. For the
[1:47:20] marriage of the lamb is come and his
[1:47:23] wife hath made herself ready. Oh,
[1:47:26] hallelujah. Let's not be here. I'm a
[1:47:28] defeated Christian. I hope I make the
[1:47:30] rapture. I'm going to try. I don't know.
[1:47:33] I'm not good enough. I'm not worthy.
[1:47:35] Forget that nonsense. The word of God
[1:47:37] clearly shows us that we as sons and
[1:47:39] daughters of God will come to that
[1:47:41] throne and we will come with prayer and
[1:47:44] praise and thanksgiving in our hearts.
[1:47:46] We will not come as a defeated people.
[1:47:48] We will not come as the cast outs. This
[1:47:50] is not a B team.
[1:47:54] This is not second string. This is God's
[1:47:57] called. This is God's chosen. This is
[1:47:59] the word made manifest right here. Amen.
[1:48:02] The voice that come from the throne was
[1:48:05] encouraging you and I to come closer.
[1:48:08] Come on, keep coming. Lift your voice
[1:48:11] and praise. Amen. And it said that she's
[1:48:14] made herself ready.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Whose plan was that?
[1:48:28] Was it our plan?
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Can we make ourselves ready?
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; It's certainly not Lucifer's plan.
[1:48:38] Where do we find our glory?
[1:48:40] In God's plan.
[1:48:43] In God's plan is where we find our
[1:48:44] glory.
[1:48:46] From start to finish. From the beginning
[1:48:49] to the end. The Alpha and the Omega. God
[1:48:53] in control of it all. Now, if he can
[1:48:56] make this plan work so perfect, do you
[1:48:59] not think he can take the little things
[1:49:02] of our lives that seem so out of kilter,
[1:49:05] seem so out of place? Do we not think he
[1:49:08] can take those
[1:49:10] and set them back in order?
[1:49:16] Is there anything unfixable
[1:49:19] to our God?
[1:49:22] Is there anything that he cannot
[1:49:25] overcome?
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Let's let go.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; And let God have his way.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Let's let him come. If I spoke too
[1:49:35] direct, forgive me. But I have to speak
[1:49:38] what God lays on my heart.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; It's time for us to quit trying to live
[1:49:44] by our plan
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; and start trusting God in his plan.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. and his plan is perfect.
[1:49:53] Hallelujah. Sister Vikica, would you
[1:49:55] come?
[1:49:58] Blessed are they. Who's blessed today?
[1:50:02] Hallelujah. We've been called to the
[1:50:03] marriage supper of the lamb.
[1:50:06] I think it's time for us.
[1:50:09] As we read earlier
[1:50:12] to get rid of the words, I can't.
[1:50:17] I'm not worthy.
[1:50:21] Can't happen.
[1:50:23] We need to throw those out and say,
[1:50:25] "Lord,
[1:50:27] I want your perfect plan.
[1:50:30] I want it to come to pass in me."
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, he didn't call you cuz you
[1:50:35] qualified.
[1:50:37] He said after he called you,
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; he would qualify you.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just stand.
[1:50:53] Let's not have a voice of failure.
[1:50:55] Let's have a voice of victory.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; A voice of worship.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; A voice
[1:51:03] that some people in the world would say
[1:51:04] it's kind of arrogant
[1:51:06] for a person to stand and say, "I am an
[1:51:09] overcomer,
[1:51:10] but I'm just repeating what my Lord said
[1:51:12] about me."
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. It wasn't my That wasn't
[1:51:15] my conclusion. For one, if you know me
[1:51:18] very well, you'll realize I wasn't
[1:51:19] bright enough to come up to that
[1:51:20] conclusion. I'm just repeating what he
[1:51:24] said.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you like that when you have
[1:51:27] something worth repeating? Amen. We
[1:51:30] don't have to come up with a new
[1:51:31] message. We don't need to come up with a
[1:51:33] new Bible, a new interpretation of the
[1:51:35] Bible, a new view on what it is to be a
[1:51:37] Christian. We can just take the word of
[1:51:39] God and we can look at that and by
[1:51:40] grace, God reveals that to us. Amen.
[1:51:43] This what the prophet is talking about
[1:51:45] when he said reading between the lines.
[1:51:47] It doesn't leave us, my brother and
[1:51:48] sister, as repeaters. He leaves us as
[1:51:52] the word speaking today.
[1:51:56] Amen. The bride has a voice.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirit and the bride say,
[1:52:01] "Come."
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm so glad.
[1:52:06] I might need some help, Brother Alex.
[1:52:09] Hallelujah. Just had this song on my
[1:52:11] heart.
[1:52:13] Amen.
[1:52:16] In fact,
[1:52:17] why don't you just
[1:52:20] Why don't you just
[1:52:31] begin?
[1:52:33] You shall love the Lord with all your
[1:52:37] heart.
[1:52:40] You shall love the Lord with all your
[1:52:44] soul.
[1:52:48] You shall love the Lord with all your
[1:52:52] mind,
[1:52:54] with all your heart, with all your soul,
[1:52:58] with all your mind.
[1:53:02] Lord, I love
[1:53:04] you
[1:53:06] for all the things you are. Lord, I love
[1:53:12] you
[1:53:13] for all the things you do. Lord, I love
[1:53:19] you.
[1:53:21] Help me love you more with all my heart,
[1:53:25] with all my soul, with all my mind.
[1:53:32] I shall love the Lord with all my heart.
[1:53:40] I shall love the Lord with all my soul.
[1:53:47] I shall love the Lord with all my mind,
[1:53:53] with all my heart, with all my soul,
[1:53:57] with all my mind.
[1:54:00] Lord, I love
[1:54:03] you
[1:54:05] for all the things you are. Lord, I love
[1:54:10] you
[1:54:12] for all the things you do. Lord, I love
[1:54:18] you.
[1:54:20] Help me love you more with all my heart,
[1:54:24] with all my soul, with all my mind.
[1:54:28] Lord, I love you. Oh Lord, I love
[1:54:33] you
[1:54:35] for all the things you are. Lord, I love
[1:54:40] you
[1:54:42] for all the things you do. Lord, I love
[1:54:48] you.
[1:54:50] Help me love you more with all my heart,
[1:54:54] with all my soul, with all my mind.
[1:55:00] You can go up to the key of F.
[1:55:06] There is none like you.
[1:55:14] No one else can touch my heart like you
[1:55:18] do.
[1:55:22] I have searched for all eternity,
[1:55:26] Lord,
[1:55:28] and find there is none like you.
[1:55:37] There is none like you.
[1:55:45] No one else can touch my heart like you
[1:55:49] do.
[1:55:52] I could search for all eternity,
[1:55:57] Lord,
[1:55:58] and find there is none like you. One
[1:56:04] more time.
[1:56:07] Oh, there is none like you.
[1:56:15] No one else can touch my heart like you
[1:56:19] do.
[1:56:23] And I could search for all eternity,
[1:56:27] Lord,
[1:56:29] and find there is none like you.
[1:56:38] I have a maker.
[1:56:46] He formed
[1:56:48] my heart.
[1:56:53] And before even time began,
[1:56:59] my life was in his hand.
[1:57:08] He knows my name.
[1:57:15] He knows
[1:57:17] my every thought.
[1:57:22] He sees each tear that falls
[1:57:28] and hears me when I call.
[1:57:37] I have a father.
[1:57:44] He calls me his own.
[1:57:51] And he'll never
[1:57:54] leave me,
[1:57:57] no matter
[1:57:59] where I go.
[1:58:05] And he knows my name.
[1:58:13] He knows
[1:58:15] my every thought.
[1:58:20] He sees each tear that falls
[1:58:26] and hears me when I call. I have a
[1:58:31] maker.
[1:58:34] Oh, I have a maker.
[1:58:42] He formed
[1:58:44] my heart.
[1:58:49] And before even time began,
[1:58:54] my life was in his hands.
[1:59:02] And he knows my name.
[1:59:10] He knows my every thought.
[1:59:17] He sees each tear that falls
[1:59:22] and hears me when I call. He knows my
[1:59:27] name.
[1:59:29] M
[1:59:31] He knows my name.
[1:59:38] He knows my every thought.
[1:59:45] He sees each tear that falls
[1:59:50] and hears me when I call.
[1:59:57] Amen.
[2:00:04] Let's go to number 223.
[2:00:14] At night I lay in bed.
[2:00:22] At night, I lay in bed and I
[2:00:29] begin to cry.
[2:00:36] And my mind just fails to know
[2:00:43] exactly
[2:00:45] why.
[2:00:50] Oh, I can't explain
[2:00:54] with tongue or pen.
[2:00:57] The spirit's groaning
[2:01:01] deep within.
[2:01:04] It must be God
[2:01:08] here in my soul.
[2:01:11] Cuz I feel the pull.
[2:01:18] I feel the pole.
[2:01:25] I hear the call.
[2:01:33] And I know his spirit's
[2:01:36] moving
[2:01:38] me to give my all.
[2:01:46] He speaks to me
[2:01:54] and I
[2:01:57] agree.
[2:02:02] Lord, please come and take control.
[2:02:08] I feel the pull.
[2:02:16] I went to hear the word
[2:02:21] and with each line
[2:02:25] and phrase
[2:02:30] he was drawing
[2:02:34] me to give
[2:02:37] a higher
[2:02:40] praise.
[2:02:45] There's a deep
[2:02:48] call to the deep
[2:02:52] like a great magnet
[2:02:55] pulling
[2:02:57] me.
[2:02:59] I know for sure
[2:03:03] I'll reach the goal cuz I feel the pull.
[2:03:12] Oh, I feel the pole.
[2:03:19] I hear the call
[2:03:27] and I know his spirit's
[2:03:31] moving me
[2:03:34] to give my all.
[2:03:40] He speaks to me
[2:03:48] and I
[2:03:56] Lord please come and take control.
[2:04:02] I feel the pull. I feel the pull once
[2:04:07] again.
[2:04:08] Oh, I feel the pull.
[2:04:16] I hear the call.
[2:04:24] And I know his spirit's
[2:04:27] moving
[2:04:29] me
[2:04:31] to give my all.
[2:04:37] He speaks to me
[2:04:44] and I agree.
[2:04:52] Oh Lord, please come and take control.
[2:04:59] I feel the pull.
[2:05:05] Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed.
