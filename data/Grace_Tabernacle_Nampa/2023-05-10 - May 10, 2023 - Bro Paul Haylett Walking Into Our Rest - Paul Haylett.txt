Jesus I must [Music] I cannot bear sauce I must tell Jesus Jesus can help me Jesus alone amen I I just really appreciate the leadership of the Holy Spirit to just put that I I believe that fits right with what the Lord has led us to speak tonight and and uh so I just want to cover just a couple little things um so that everyone will know I know that there probably are some who did not get a chance to say about ordering seals books so we just ordered some extras but that order has now been placed but there will be opportunity uh for more in the future but I believe we have the body of Believers here covered and maybe an extra eight or ten books something in that range and if not we can always leverage our friendship with brother George to to get more so some of you I hope you don't mind but I took Liberty to order seals book for your children some of you maybe didn't do that but I know in the future you'll forgive me for being presumptuous and uh so uh we're just very happy to see our brother David his travels to to Central America uh and uh go down there where almost any place you would eat could make you sick but he saved it till he got home and uh and we actually thanked the Lord for that because I tell you there's nothing like being in a foreign country and finding yourself sick and you're there to do the work of God to perform the will of God and the devil trying to keep you from it and uh I have before been in a case where literally went to bed at night so sick I couldn't stay on my feet and have services in the morning and wake up in the morning feeling literally like a brand new man and knowing that the Lord is mindful of us and touches us amen so God bless you Sister April God bless you and please take greetings to the family amen we love and appreciate them very much okay let's go right into the thought tonight I want to thank you musicians uh God's blessing us more and more amen if the Lord tarries we we are going to really see what our blessings are amen I want to speak once again on our journey as we parallel we'll type these things as it is when Jesus was walking through the land and we know that he is walking through the land right now amen he is right here tonight with us amen walking right in our midst and it's all just for us to stop put the busyness of life to the side all the noise and and just to be able to stop and hear that still Small Voice and and uh by God's grace we hear that still small voice and I look up and uh we're happy you had a good trip glad to see you back safe glad that you know where you belong amen Luke the 17th chapter you know just in case nobody told you I was describing you sister Gabriella the other day as this little very cute very sweet little girl and I don't know where the time has gone I'm not saying that went away but um the time has went away and I was stunned the other day you know that sister Gabriella took a little trip all by herself out on the highway navigated herself made it there made it back of course my prayers were in the car the angel was hanging over the car in front of the car behind the car beside the car amen but it is a little shocking to see our children growing up so quickly and uh amen Luke 17 11-19 and it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he entered into a certain Village there met him 10 men that were lepers which stood afar off and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them you must have sinned there must be a reason this has come on you he didn't tow them to a mark he gave them Grace and he gave them Mercy because you see it's the devil that tries to put that every little thing that comes in your life must have been that yesterday you got frustrated over this and that's why this is happening no I'm sorry the scripture tells us these afflictions of life happen to the rich and to the poor and the righteous and the unrighteous and so it's in that realm my brother and sister that we know that the word of God is here to come and anoint you and I every step of this way it's not about how this must have been this or it must have been that it's God who's in control the devil is bound by the word of God Amen and we have been loosed by the word of God Amen Hallelujah Jesus Master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priest and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan which would not normally be looked on as being a religious person amen Jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine they are not found that return to give glory to God save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole Heavenly Father we ask Lord to blessings upon the service tonight just speak to our hearts Lord Make It Real to us Lord we love you and adore you and bless the bride of Christ Lord we pray amen you may be seated 9th I want to speak to you this evening on walking into our rest amen so there is a position that God has given and we'll touch on that I don't want to get ahead of myself but walking into our rest my brother and sister and I think there's nothing greater in an everyday blessing that God I say an everyday blessing that God gives us that the fact that he put us in a position or allowed us to come into a position that we can find rest from the world that we live in from the cares the songs that brother Alex was led to sing tonight I felt went along with this amen we're in mountaintops we're in valleys but he reaches down his hand amen and so it's there that God by his grace and mercy when he said that you know I'll never leave you nor forsake you that was not just conversation my brother and sister that was a a vow if you would that God committed himself to you and I now I've used this scripture and preached it many times and and I just trust tonight and just along in the thoughts of a journey here it just so struck me a few days ago oh more like a few weeks ago as it is to just see how that God has has uh hidden in his word uh so many stories so many things that we could see in our day and and be able to relate to amen now we look at this and you know brother Chris preached a few Wednesdays ago on our humanity and you know if we're not careful we put such a high pedestal uh to to uh or standard to reach and I don't believe we should set that standard low my brother and sister I don't believe that we should settle for just a half-hearted uh uh uh uh personal relationship with the Lord but we just have to understand in our human Humanity that that God knows where we stand and knows our circumstance and these uh lepers you know lepers in that day were are set aside or cast aside from the rest of humanity and in public they had to give the Cry of unclean unclean and so this Cry of unclean could be heard any time that they were in the midst of the people and it's there my brother and sister we find how remarkable it is that that God allowed them it wasn't in the Heart of the City it wasn't on the steps of the temple as it were it wasn't in a face of a great crowd but it was there outside coming in as it were that they are there and as though they knew he was coming and they are there and my brother and sister you can hear this voice being raised now we have to understand and think about this we can just look in life and find it you know when when you are in a certain position in life there are spirits that would attract us or pull us and so my brother and sister these ten lepers being together is of no surprise because they had something in common and it was there that will uh the Lord will remind me we'll touch on a little something more in common now it's there that they are now traveling as a group because they are outcasts and it's there that we'll find in the world today that the spirits of the age tend to draw people of the Same Spirit together so when you find someone that has a certain peculiar thing that controls their life you will no doubt find around them more people that have a very similar deal because those Spirits as we see when brother Branham was casting out demons in service he's there speaking to a woman with cancer and then he stops there's a little pause in the tape and he is seeing this Spirit on this woman crying out to a woman with the same health issue with the same cancer and so what it was is as as uh you know uh brother Ron Spencer says poor dumb devil he was there crying for help but all he did is expose his friend amen and what happened is they both got cast out but you see that they were looking for that continuity of support to go together that's why it's important that we as Sons and Daughters of God hang out with sons and daughters of God Amen and even among Sons and Daughters of God sometimes my brother and sister we would look and say well I don't really personality wise find myself real compatible with this family or with this individual but you need to put that aside and recognize that our position in the family of God is more important than personality amen because because while that personality grates on you maybe your personality is actually grading on them at the same time and by grace of God there'll be a pile of sawdust where you're both got brought smooth amen or Rock savings or metal filings or whatever you want to account to yourself amen you know that's why God does that you know he kind of puts you in a position sometimes to just work the rough edges off of us amen and I tell you sometimes as a pastor you know you just feel like that you are being rubbed every which way and you know we'd like to say Well it must be brother Trevor and sister Kerry's fault it must be sister April's fault it must be sister Ruth's fault but what it is is actually God knows what this man needs and I need more than I thought I needed my oh my so when you get around to complaining about what's happening just recognize that God knows you needed more than you thought you needed oh my say thank you Lord amen how Hallelujah my nose is tickling me um so they're standing afar off and they're raising their voice my brother and sister they were not bashful they didn't in a very timid well if he hears us maybe something will happen they came to him or in that time frame and they had a need oh can someone lift a hand and say Lord tonight I have a need amen and if they would lift their voice and cry out Jesus master oh what would be hindering us the bride of Christ tonight be able to lift our voice and say Jesus Master have mercy on me and I lift my hands and I and say Lord have mercy on me amen I need you Lord It's the songs tonight that we sung Give us a very clear picture I need you Lord my brother and sister they have the identity correct they didn't say oh you know uh important man or spiritual man or whatever they knew who they were talking to and aren't you glad tonight that by God's grace and mercy we're not sitting here trying to chop God up into pieces we're not trying to understand these relationships and put these things to the fact that we have deities and PDS and all kinds of whatever to our name and we just stop and say well it's too complicated to explain I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ I didn't go to my father as it was and say I'm not sure what to call you I don't stand in front of a mirror and look at myself and say I don't know how to identify you God's given us a clear picture this is our lord Jesus he's the master he's a master of the wind Master of the Waves Master of the heaven he's a Healer he's the provider he's everything we need we know his position he's not just a holy man he is the man as brother George would say he is the man oh my Hallelujah amen his name Jesus his position Master they had that correct amen and I'm just going to say this tonight if you don't mind me putting it this way if we came hungry tonight can somebody say I'm hungry amen if we came hungry tonight and we have needs tonight we should be following their example and lift our voice amen and cry out to the master and say have a need tonight Lord and I need you to come on this scene and I need you to touch that need and Lord you know what the need is I don't have to post it to the heavens I don't have to declare it to the whole world you know my need and Lord I'm asking you you are my Lord You're my master and I'm asking you Lord come touch my need amen I tell you my brother and sister it's there it's in the word it's in the message it's all over in front of us sometimes we need to find it if you're a little bashful you're a little shy you're not comfortable being real public about it then you will find you a corner you go find you a room you go find the back corner of the yard or whatever it might be and lift your voice and talk to him amen if you say well I just couldn't publicly I just I freeze up and then find you a place then you're comfortable with and cry out to him and say Lord You're my master and I have a need today it might be Daniel it might be Christian Demi it might be you know uh uh I forgot your Elder son every time anyway whatever it might be that might be the burden Sydney Mason it might be the burden that's on us but come to a place Saints don't offer yourself an excuse and say I would but just find the place and cry out amen he's here to hear our voice amen it makes me think of of a brother sergey's friend amen after years here just some things have brought about some uh contact my brother and sister God knows what he's doing we don't always understand all of the pieces amen of the deal I watched a little video recently this young man is from over there in Europe somewhere uh one of the Slovakian countries he's he's considered one of the new Geniuses at chess and and here he is playing chess and he's playing against very experienced people and he he moves into such a fashion that the commentators are saying that was ridiculous what is he doing but he laid the consummate trap for the opponent and the opponent thought this guy's not nearly as good as he said he is look at this ridiculous move he's made and it's over well I'll tell you my brother and sister we ought to come with a kind of a confidence that we can step out regardless of where God leads you and I what step he asks you to take we ought to step out in that knowing he's not putting us in the Trap he's putting Satan in the Trap he's not springing it on you and I he's springing it on the devil amen and we would kind of feel like we feel the furnace from here we kind of feel like we feel the cold from here but I'm telling you he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you and I never put you out to be prey to the enemy oh Hallelujah my Lord help me to trust you I'll tell you what so what happens Jesus does not give them a speech about why are you here or what brought you to this place but he simply tells them he says to them go show yourselves unto the priest my brother and sister they were there and we know that obedience brings results can someone say Amen to that obedience we are not legalists this is the problem that many people have they believe if you're obedient to the word of God there must be some kind of legalist Foundation behind it to force you to do it but I if I could tear my chest open tonight and expose it to you you would see that God has written something on the fleshly table of this heart it's not my brother and sister the will of man it is not the force of man it's not the pressure of tears but it is a desire to fulfill because it was by God's grace he wrote on our hearts amen it wasn't by force of nature but it was Grace that he said I'm going to write on you and that indelible writing that's placed in our hearts my brother and sister is what causes us to have such a desire to serve him the world cannot comprehend this and we'll get into it my my sermon might seem a little pointed here in a little bit but I want you to catch the point that there's a reason my brother and sister that you're different there's a reason we're not just strange people attracted to what the world thinks is a strange religion but there's something down inside of you that you look into the word because if we couldn't find it in the word we'd be gone I know that's kind of a blunt way to put it but if it wasn't in the word I would be gone amen because as brother George says I love this sorry to throw you under the bus brother George but brother George puts it this way if this is not that that the scripture spoke of let's go find it we're not going to just sit and say well it's close it might do it it's kind of doing it no sir there's something in us such a desire for truth that if this is not it let's search out what is it and there is nothing my brother and sister they have nothing to offer and if you don't think of that sister April made me think of this I'll send it to you article talking about how the coronation of Charles they pulled them all together Hindus and Buddhists Catholics and write down the list and he makes a statement back here a little bit in time he's going to be a defender of the faith and at that time people thought oh Charles gonna rise up I mean the guy's got a very checkered history you know we're not even followers of royalty my brother and sister and it's hard to miss all of the anyway and uh so he says I'm a defender of the faith and everybody thought he's going to stand up and defend the Anglican Church no sir his idea of faith is everything mixed together but we know my brother and sister that when you mix all of this together there's one that comes out on top like oil and water so they think they're all coming back to blend their faith together but what they don't know it's upon their faith that the foundation that that is going to be built upon that takes over or tries to take over the world Amen so what they're doing is they're actually submitting while they think they're cooperating and it's always uh pardon me for putting it this way but I always read with interest of financial papers because it's like so and so and so and so merged and they always make it sound like it's two friends deciding let's do business together but the merge usually has one company's foot on top of the forehead of the other one amen it's like either merge or we'll put you out of business my brother and sister so they're merging huh imagine that sign of the time coming together as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be the coming of Son of Man my brother and sister as far as the human interpretation of that scripture goes that could be this very second you realize in England there was a child that was being forced to participate with some kind of sordid Adventure at school and the parents protested in the high court of England said the child will participate or we'll take the child from you court ordered what is a word that's publicly that is so strong to find shocking I I don't know what that word is I'll let you conjure in your own mind so I don't have to say it out loud absolutely agree it is my brother and sister you don't own your child anymore we do I'm sorry devil our children were given to the Lord Jesus Christ they are already going to title they're already identified there's already a personal possession it's not up to you to decide that you get to claim them because they're already been placed under the blood and not just a little dab on a forehead as it was but a cleansing of the blood of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah my so look at this one of them when he saw that he was healed turns back isn't that amazing it's only one out of ten there's some significance but we won't go into all that tonight or we'll be here for a long time you see I want to focus for a moment this one my brother and sister that is there he is different but we're going to step away from him for just a moment okay because he's the minority and we never focus on minorities do we we always want to listen to the voice of the majority because the majority must be right hmm you see my brother and sister these nine were obedient are you with me Jesus said go show yourself to the priest they didn't say well I didn't I want to tie this earlier I said remind me Lord you see they didn't say I haven't been in church in years because I'm a leper I don't even really believe no what did they do and he said go show you the priest they were like okay that's what we're gonna do you know what's going to happen here we are going to go show ourselves to the priests and we don't really know what's going but we're going to do what he told him they start walking they're headed into town to show themselves they're going back to church my brother and sister they've been away for a while they're going back to church and all of a sudden they look out and there there's no leprosy and they start looking at each other and there's no leprosy my brother and sister they became first-hand witnesses to the power of the Majesty of almighty God but you see the difference it was between them and the one was they went back to where they came from without a question and you say where are you going with this brother Paul well I tell you my brother and sister early and brother branham's Ministry when there was no message churches brother Branham sent them back go back to your church go back to your church go back to your church and I have met and personally set and visited with these people now elderly some of them many of them passed away now but you see they were there and they went back to their church and they sat there on the Pew and they were there and they starved to death and they were getting spiritually skinny getting spiritually skinny and they remembered also that they were Witnesses and they rose up from that position because they could not stay there they knew something in their life had changed and they had to go find what that change was but these nine they never reappear but I'll tell you what they did do they went showed themselves to the priest the priest by the law had to examine them in an intimate fashion in other words they had to be stripped of their clothing and every portion of their Anatomy as it were given the visual that it's just not the leprosy left your arm or your face or your ears or your nose but you're clean and when they were clean by purification they were even a time period before they can enter into the congregation but they did but they sit in church I hope this is not offensive to anyone they sit in church we were with the prophet we saw the supernatural I saw the healing power I saw people delivered I saw this I am a witness I myself was healed of leprosy I saw this but it never moved them out of their position they never changed they went right back to the same church the same Pew the same priest and that is a priest that had held them under the law never let them out from underneath the law controlled them by the law my brother and sister never come to the Fulfillment of the law but preached to them every Wednesday and every Sunday this is how it is this is how it is and they were there and they were able to set under that anointing and say oh I saw the supernatural I've saw this I've saw God move praise the Lord and I'm going to heal and that's the evidence that I've got it but never left their Church that the very one that healed them desired to deliver them but they were happy to go back I tried to be very politically correct saying that I hope I achieved that my brother and sister the prophet of God told us the word never stops do you realize if those men a month later would have had a little flash now just take this for very Simplicity and got up and walked back to the very place that they had met Jesus would they find him the word keeps moving we can go back we can say what we want is services like this remember when Brothers so-and-so preached and the altar was full and we were also my brother and sister you can't go back he said I'll be right here we want a supernatural event in our life our family our church find it right here find it now not yesterday not looking back somewhere my brother and sister it's there that God is moving in our midst and he's waiting for you and I to trust him he said I will lead you and guide you I'll never forsake you we don't need to be afraid that God's going to let us get out there so far and we're just going to drift off into nothing we can't do it the word of God cannot let you and I the prophet of God said you cannot be deceived because you are the word oh that ought to get somebody excited I am the word amen and I'm not talking about just run off and chase after this that and the other my brother and sister don't misunderstand me you should know be my now amen but look at this they were there and at their word amen they would be able to say we personally got the word I'll be just a little Bolder I'll be a little more blunt I've encountered many a person That by The Virtue of saying I was with the prophet expected you to believe what they were saying I was there don't tell me about what you think you understand I was there well I'll tell you you want the testimony of nine or do you want to go find this one brother who's now no longer in their fellowship and ask him what it was amen not only did he there he got what was there it's not enough just to be there but we've got to get what was there did that make sense amen so it's there what their personal witness of the words of the master and look at this lovely defense you see God will never judge us without already revealing or showing us look at this defense we went back said under the same old priests same old message same old sermon went right to act to the same old life but we did exactly what we were told well if I told you to jump off the roof today would you say well Brother Paul's our pastor I'm obligated to jump off this roof no sir you would say brother Paul take me back to the word show me where you hmm but people he said so I'm going to do exactly what I was told why are you in the hospital I jumped off a roof imagine you see they could say by this ministry our lives were completely changed we've been healed I've been a leper for years completely changed my brother and sister but I'll tell you the prophet of God speaks about this and they were not drawn to Jesus himself you notice how easily they walked away they were not drawn to Jesus himself they were actually drawn to the miracle they were drawn to the story that had been told that he has prayed for this one he's prayed for that when they were healed and they knew that he was a Healer and so they come for the supernatural Miracle of healing they didn't come for any other reason now look some of us I'm not going to speak derogatory but some of us are a little slow on the uptake right and this other leper here was just a tad bit slow on the uptake amen he was there just like them he's with his friends and when he says go show yourself to the priest he starts to walk down the road he he's headed to the priest now but he gets down the road just a little ways just like you and I did after we were introduced to the word of the hour we got down the road a little ways and we realized I can't live without this the everything that means anything to me is not here it's here and he got down the road a little ways and he looked down and saw the leprosy falling away from him and I want to put it another time and he'll start walking down the road a little ways and we start to see the uncleanness we start to see the filthiness we start to see that we're once we walked and said unclean all we could say about ourselves unclean unclean unclean but we saw it Falling Away we saw the desires loss of the flesh pride of life all of this starting to fall away and something the scales come off of his eyes it wasn't just leprosy that left him Saint it was a scale that was on his eyes come off and that was binding his ears come off and he was there and said he told me to go to the priest and he turns around and he starts heading back why he had just had a revelation of who his priest was his preach that's not down there in the temple his priest was standing out here in a dirty Dusty Old Road in the middle of nowhere and he turns around and he goes back and he kneels before and submits himself to the priest now my brother and sister each one of those the one or the nine could say I did exactly as I was told but the same words yielded a different revelation you wonder why that you're different you wonder the devil tries to make you say you know why are you out here where you're at but I'm telling you when Jesus speaks not everyone hears what you hear no one my brother and sister can control that it's a gift from almighty God it's a blessing that God has given but you see there's some as a scripture says some come for the fishes and the loaves my brother and sister but look how this is this priesthood that they were going to go show themselves too no doubt had had years maybe Generations to change their lives but it held them to the law but even that priesthood was unable to fulfill the law because what's up here has got to make it down here do you realize how big a roadblock that is I'll tell you how big that roadblock is God said that roadblock getting it from our mind to our heart is so big that instead of trying to do this I'm just going to come and pardon me for doing this I'm just going to put it this way I'm gonna come down here and I'm just going to write it on you and I'm going to ride it on you you you you you you I'm going to do that for you to get it out of the mind and get it down in the heart because once you recognize there's something down in your heart you turn around and you go right back to the one priest that matters to you and I the one priest that makes a difference the one priest that is more than just a Healer amen you can be healed in this flesh my brother and sister and be tormented in your mind the rest of your life you can be healed in this flesh and have all kinds of other issues in your life that are never dealt with and I say oh God help us to be like this one that come and he fell down verse 16 fell down on his feet and given him thanks and he was a Samaritan amen what is it by Revelation he saw aren't you glad today the prophet of God said the first and foremost you ought to pray for is revelation amen not be praying that I can explain explain all the doctrine and that I can do all of this and I can do all of that be a scholar in this message no my brother and sister the Revelation the word of God shows us so clearly Prophet elaborates on it you cannot explain this to someone we get so caught up amen we get so caught up trying to explain it but the prophet said you can't explain it it's a revelation of the Holy Ghost to you oh somebody give him thanks amen it's a revelation of the Holy Ghost to you my brother and sister that cannot be explained if they have a seed Gene just like this one had a c Gene something Sparks inside there and they say this is different but everything else I've ever tried didn't work I'll try it oh at least that's how they think it in their mind little do they know God's turned them around and they're walking back to their priest my thank you Lord amen well I'll tell you what I'm glad tonight we've got a high priest of our profession amen the prophet of God says that profession there in Hebrews is confession amen and it's not confessed or it comes out of your lips amen you can have somebody that's killed somebody or robbed somebody and the policeman's air interrogating them and you know says okay did you kill this person and if the person just sits there they know he did it they're not guessing they know but unless it comes from their lips it's not a confession did you kill him uh it's not confession oh you know that's been to court because people they'd say well I'll give an answer it just won't be legible intelligible I just give the court comes along later says no that wasn't an answer it's got to come from their lips it's got to be intelligent it's got to be an utterance that can be understood or it's not a confession are you with me oh he's the high priest of our confession profession come on Saints let's make sure whether it's the quiet time I was talking to you about earlier or whatever it is out loud or inquired make sure it comes from your lips make sure you say those words Lord you are my Lord and Savior My Healer my provider you're my everything let it come from your lips amen Hebrews 3 1 amen fits that I don't know dear brothers did you put Hebrews 3 1 up wherefore holy Brethren amen not a bunch of unbelievers holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus stop my brother and sister consider what he done and let's follow his example after all carnally I was a leper I could have through many years of my life walked and said unclean unclean unclean in fact many of you know my testimony enough to know there was a time that something inside of me would hurt so bad I would go to church whether it was in Denver or whether it was in Arizona Phoenix or Flagstaff wherever I'd go to church trying to take away that pain but little did I know that God would allow that to move so strongly in my life that I had to respond to it just like a person with a heart attack my brother and sister have they got any sense at all they don't sit there and say well I guess if I live I live and if I die I die no at that point in time when their chest feels like it's on fire and blowing up they are dialing 9-1-1 they're looking for an aspirin they're looking for someone to help them and that's what God allows to happen sometimes amen he moves us into a position we say well I don't know how I got here how did I get cold enough I enjoyed the comment about the Ember the fire blowing the wind blowing upon that ember bring that ember back to life let it become a roaring flame because we can sometimes good people like brother Tony Reagan said one time many years ago he said that time when mothers have children and up until those children kind of reach age of accountability or Beyond he said a lot of mothers are basically backslid because they're pouring all their energy and everything into their children and the things of God they're doing it almost by Instinct amen they pray by Instinct there's not a real Revelation as it were they're doing all of these things and God looks down and says that's fine I laid the foundation I put the seed there I put the muscle memory as it would be there and they'll come out of this just fine oh thank God for that and we come to places like that in our lives well we are just literally just walking along amen but Jesus he speaks and says you know uh were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine I'll tell you what when I was studying this it struck me so strongly amen I'm in that number I'm in that number I am number one hope you don't mind that amen I am the one amen can you say that I am the one that came back Oh by God's grace and mercy amen given the ear to hear and I'll tell you what my brother and sister personal Witnesses pretty hard to argue with somebody who is a personal Witness but did they hear what they heard they heard with an ear but God called you to hear with your soul with your heart you ever wonder why people they know their Bible better than you they can quote they can do all this stuff but you don't see you don't see the effect you don't see the reality they're hearing but they're not hearing and that's scriptural it's a word for this day and we've got nine lepers to prove it they were absolutely obedient to the word but it's not producing a life that brought them back to Jesus Christ personally they can tell the world I met Jesus on the road he healed me he is all they said he is he's a Healer he's a provider he's everything but there was no change now you say they were healed of leprosy but I want to bring out a very key point when this man comes back into the presence of Jesus he doesn't just say hey you're healed but he was made every wit hole you know what that is that's the mind that's emotion that's the heart that's the body that is the soul amen everything about this man was set in order amen the others had an experience with Jesus Christ but went away and went back and we're happy to stay there but one man by Revelation was magnetized as the prophet of God talks about that and pulled right back into the presence and stood there and knelt before him and give him praise and glorified him because God had more for him oh I hope this sounds doesn't sound too judgmental I don't mean it that way but it's simply the word of God there was more for that man than there was for nine other lepers he didn't choose to be the man but it was in him to respond because he heard a different call he heard a different word he understood a different Revelation there was something affected him differently than the rest he can't oh he should not apologize or neither should you that God would call you in a fashion different than the 90 of the world amen but we get a little bit of a complex that we are just the odd man out all the time well I'll tell you my brother and sister when that young man I think he was young and when he went into the City and they said where you been he said I turned around and I went back and had a conversation with Jesus and he started talking about all the supernatural that had happened in his life with Jesus and they would be there amen amen amen it happened to me too no no you don't get it you don't get it this was personal you never got close to him oh do you see the type my brother and sister they were at shouting distance with God they were at a distance with God speaking to him Jesus Master but this man fell at his feet he was here in a personal relationship but when the conversation took place and he's saying I had a personal experience with Jesus Christ me too all right he's my healer me too he changed my life me too you see they couldn't separate that they never had experience and all they could do is respond I almost titled the sermon me too amen because all they could do because you see they never caught that intrinsic value of what Jesus said they heard it in Gross words in vocabulary in verbiage and they were there and all they could the rest of their life I don't know what he thinks we were there experienced the same thing he did no you never know you never you got healed God touched you you were brought back into Fellowship in your church with your family that was wonderful things happened in your life amazing Supernatural things happened in your life but you didn't have that kind of experience and you will think you will but you didn't and you can't separate that how do you separate that I'll just move off of that before I go to that next page as it were amen we have to admit they received healing and a personal testimony to share the rest of their lives but one I know I'm going back over this again but just bear with me one received his healing you know that really that was on the lowest rung you realize that healing's on the law are strong being healed doesn't prove anything as far as your salvation see people we're not careful we Elevate these things because literally to make my point what was the whole Foundation of what the nine had to testify to the priest I've been healed nothing other now that in their consideration as lepers that's a huge change but spiritually nothing changed whatever they were before they got leprosy is what they would be after Deliverance from leprosy come out of denomination and denomination don't come out of you you still are in a denomination put any title you want over the door it's still a spirit of denomination Lord help us amen people ask how can a church turn into a nicolaitan church because the people see we always blame the preacher but it's actually the people allow it to take place because they came from a root or a background that they had always been rooted in them than in church you submit to man's Authority they got the message now they never got rid of the root Lord help us to root the root out we have one leadership and it's the Lord Jesus Christ amen so you see how these things get so intertwined and rooted into lives that people think it's normal to go to church and be dominated by man and wonder why after 10 15 20 years the church has drifted off and it's cold and it's formal and they look back and say where did we miss this at you missed it when you quit personally seeking the leadership of the Holy Ghost and you let your backbone get dissolved by kind words hmm that wasn't in my notes excuse me amen now let's go calling Jesus on the scene amen now remember every Redemptive blessing has already been purchased Can someone say Amen the price is paid there's only one way that you'll ever be able to receive it is to believe it and to accept it he's the high priest of our confession the Hebrew says there the Hebrew letter says he's a high priest of our profession to profess and confess is the same thing of course so we he's the high priest of our confession therefore he cannot do anything for us until we first confess that he's done it amen has God given us revelation amen that's going to heal us amen has he given us uh just oh my to save the time of quoting all those he has given all that to us and we say amen amen hallelujah and and when we confess it then he's a high priest or mediator to go to work on that and make it right so we pray trusting in God tonight in his kindness and mercy that he will give to us his abundance of Grace tonight and now remember you must accept it amen what happened I I bring this out in this fashion to tell you my brother and sister that little voice amen the presence of God was there with those ten lepers now I might be stepping a little on a limb forgive me if but I believe I'm on the right track that's still small voice because God has it just God we're speaking to all ten lepers as they walked down the road one listened and one accepted God did not come I believe he would be an unjust God to just come and put his finger on one and say the rest of your trash no sir that's still Small Voice with speaking but it was not in them to pause long enough to hear that voice and I hope this isn't a bombshell they had been trained so diligently do what the priest tells you do what the priest tells you do what the priest tells you where Revelation to come in as he said wait that's my priest that's not my priest this is my priest and I'm going to go just like he said and go and present myself to the priest amen so it was by Revelation that he recognized not oh hey I'm more important I got more spiritual no sir the Revelation was he recognized the priest oh Hallelujah my brother and sister there's God's grace to recognize the priest tonight amen God help us that's still Small Voice is speaking to you and to I what we got to do is stop and listen to what the voice is amen and then take it back the prophet of God didn't say just blindly he said no you take every one of those things run through the filter of the word Hallelujah well I didn't have time I don't know I had to make a snap decision do I believe or not God's not unjust God God will give you time to run it through the filter of the word or Lord help Paul also okay is it okay if the preacher preaches to himself maybe we should know the word better so when we hear it we'll know whether it fits through the filter of the word we wouldn't have to go home and do an exhaustive study to figure out if the preacher said the right thing on Sunday because we were in the word and we would say yep I just heard that I just read that praise God me and the preacher on the same mind well really what it is is praise God me and God are on the same mind amen I've got his mind oh is it okay to be excited tonight amen sometimes you know that's the problem sitting around tractor does all the work Amen brother Sergey you know kind of cut me to the Bone he looks at me Smiles real big and goes oh so that's your toy no no it's a tractor I do this for work no it's a toy yeah well the toy is pretty smart toy it does the work for me I get a lot of time drive up and down the rows quote scripture quote notes quote scripture quote notes notes notes notes notes oh beep beep gotta turn around go back to work you see that's a my real job that's just a sight line the luck my brother and sister you see God is wanting you and I to see this he wants us to see this and he's speaking open your eyes open your ears pause for a moment let it get quiet enough you can hear my voice the scripture doesn't say giant booming voice says still small voice ever you noticed that great big strong people they usually speak a little quieter and they hardly ever really shake your hand I know a couple guys that are so incredibly strong it just I'm amazed that one man can be that strong Tom Kelly when he shakes your hand you think what in the world because he's like one day I got to know Tom well enough Tom why do you shake hands like that because I'm afraid to tear yours off my brother and sister the power of the Majesty of almighty God he comes to us Softly and Tenderly he comes in meekness and humbleness because he knows his power and His Majesty but he wants you and I to know that power and Majesty to recognize that we are directly connected into that amen we just got to learn to not use it against one another and use it on the devil amen there's the key right there it's not for you and I to use this to to damage and hurt and prove it's for us to put the devil underneath our feet amen and when we learn that in total total total uh uh uh cognitive awareness my brother and sister men will realize just what Authority we have over the devil amen you see what it is it's one thing to accept the gift you realize you can accept a gift from almost anyone but it's quite another to accept the giver nine lepers accepted the gift they did not accept The Giver only one accepted the giver God help us Lord to accept you whatever you have for us Lord let us accept it amen let's accept the gift tonight amen now my brother and sister if the giver is Desiring Our Praise then let's give a gift back to The Giver of Our Praise amen now I went way over time and so I'm just going to give you literally the overview of this Hebrews 4 1-11 homework homework it's talking about entering into rest we've read this scripture many times the prophet of God's preached on it my brother and sister I want to just balance this amen now look real quick verse 6 seeing therefore remaineth it some must enter therein amen so those who has first preached to enter not in because of unbelief so it was unbelief that held them out and it was there but the word of God says there's got to be some enter in and now I am very much an equal opportunity the Old Testament is nothing more the New Testament is nothing more than the Old Testament explained amen that's what Jesus told us he didn't come to do away with it amen he come to open it up to fulfill it to make it alive to us and so here it is that there's a promise that there's some that must enter in if you was with Israel coming through the Wilderness and saw all that you would have saw young people I want you to think about this you would have saw all that you would have saw you would have saw brother Paul now I'm going to step a negative picture here you would have saw brother Paul come to a place I know God said we were going to take the land but young people I know that there's going to be a Rapture take place but and then the time would go on and you would see brother Paul turn old and feeble and you would see brother Paul pass on and you would look at that and something would be lodged in your mind and you would be saying now God said and he used to say the pastor used to say but he quit saying and he softened it up and basically started talking like everybody was going to heaven and uh now God's back again saying you would stop and you'd ponder that which one of these was right was my pastor right well if you choose to follow your pastor and your pastor's not on the word you'll die in a wilderness it'll just be a different Wilderness than they died in amen this one's called laodicea amen they died in the wilderness of sin aptly named isn't it I even as a kid I marveled at that my God's got a sense of humor they got out there in the desert and they didn't believe God it's the Wilderness of sin they should have known that when they saw the sign beside the road welcome to the Wilderness of sin they should have said whoa whoa we're we're in a Wilderness one but we're in the wilderness of sin stop everybody somewhere in the book what does it say historically people die out here what are we gonna do stick with the word talk about the original inoculation okay look at this so seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter and young people I want you to know I don't care what you see in your life I don't care what happens around you what people would say of coming and going and doing and quitting some are going to enter in there's going to be some that take a Rapture there's going to be some that are around the Throne of almighty God there's going to be some that set at the wedding supper in the marriage of the Lamb there's going to be some that are going to be there just commit it in your heart I'm gonna be that one I'm going to be of the sum that's going to be there and fulfill that Hallelujah you know what this is just such a big topic it's totally an injustice sister vika will you come amen you know what I mean that's kind of like I've done it before Jerry and I did it not all that long ago you ordered dessert like six minutes before the restaurant closes and then you're sitting there as they're cleaning everything up and putting the chairs on the table and you've got this great big piece of dessert in front of you this is back quite a waste in time and uh actually it was the night we ate at goodwoods a block from Brother Ivan and sister Nadia's house but brother Ivan was off far Blue Yonder doing something we felt Justified eating that close to your house and we ordered their warm carrot cake it was so good except for the fact that they were closing and we were eating at about this fast you see we have to be careful so I'm not going to go racing off through this word because it's just an injustice something so good to just be flown through so Lord willing we'll pick it up again amen please as homework read Hebrews 4. and in the Patmos vision you'll find a portion there my little quote on the iPad doesn't show up uh page or a quote number but you'll find it there brother Brian I'm talking about the Bible teaches us about the Sabbath rest you see it's not a day Saints it's not a day it's a relationship there's our rest not one man I'll close it out here if you'll just start playing sister beaker who truly got rest of those 10 all ten can say our lives have been changed and that have to say Amen they could do that but one truly and as I explained earlier I want to just reinforce this everything he said they could have said me too don't get discouraged when they say me too because you see it is so close together [Music] the life-changing event they experienced they believe that's it but the word says it was by obedience that they moved into the rest from cover this is our manual on how to enter and to rest everything we need to find rest is right here amen God bless you Saints I trust tonight that maybe made a little sense I pray it bless you a little bit I'll tell you what I want to do I want to hear that voice all the time I want God to speak to me and if I'm not going the right direction I want him to turn me around and when I find him I don't want to just want to have a conversation with him I want to fall down and worship Him amen if he wants to talk to me as it were most the time we think we've got some input you know why people say I really need to talk to the Lord what we really need to do is say I really need to get and listen to the Lord I need to get to a place I listen to the Lord because he already knows before you ever voiced it you know that you know I'm telling you my brother and sister I won't go into it but this world spiritual world we live in Satan's tapped in there you'd be just shocked to what your communication what's connecting it everybody's worried about a cell tower listening here my phone's listening to me who cares about your phone the devil's listening to you but more important than that our Lord Jesus Christ is listening to you oh Lord hallelujah let's stand up and Worship the Lord for just a few minutes amen just take a moment amen Hallelujah 6.99 brother Gideon has the deer panteth for the water amen aren't you glad we serve a risen savior amen he loves

transformed and changed lives that have raised Godly families lives that have stood hard tests of the transition of time lives that stand like pillars this very day amen just because as it is scripturally to take that type a new or younger generation crossing over into the land don't take that as a type that cuts off all those who have walked before us and left The Godly example to us let's not misconstrue that point amen hallelujah I'd like to sing I'm in that number 330 brother get in I just come to me as I was studying this and I just had real I don't know how you'd say it real tears you know is realize how blessed I am I'm in that number that God could have could have just that still small voice something could have the devil clap his hands at that time trying to keep you
