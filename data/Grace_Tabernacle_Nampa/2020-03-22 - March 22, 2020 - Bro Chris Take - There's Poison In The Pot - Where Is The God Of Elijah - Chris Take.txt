wrapped up I'm tired [Music] I'm tangled all up in Jesus tangled all up in yeah well long long time ago I did not know the Lord so I start out singing salvation to help my situation I never never knew Judas what it meant to be free when I got down on my knees praised our Jesus God [Music] wrapped up [Music] after I got foundation I needed so much [Music] wrapped up in Jesus and wrapped up I'm up [Music] [Music] [Music] well I want to just take a moment before brother Chris would come to the preaching of the word and just talk to you for a moment Church I believe we all kind of understand what's going on in the world around us and well I'm not going to directly reference those quotes and stuff this morning to not take up that time we understand the age that we're living in the prophet of God you can go look and the message he says they'll be in the end times germ warfare and we realized my brother and sister regardless of what circumstance or what is the condition out here we are in a warfare we are not as Christians just getting a pass you know go by go or whatever and collector $200 this is a warfare from the beginning to the end and in this we can take a position and say well we're simply not going to do this or do that but the scripture clearly teaches us that we must use wisdom you know we can there's many types it's interesting to see believers across the nations they're different points of view some are saying you know you're being foolish by not following the guidelines lock yourself in your house others are saying the prophet of God said that as it was in Goshen you put the blood over the door and the death angel will not come to your house and so we want to find the correct balance of wisdom you know the scripture tells us when the doors are open to come to the house of the Lord yet we don't want to open the doors foolishly if it will be detrimental to two sons and daughters of God I'm going to speak plainly they say that brothers and sisters like brother Bob and sister Joanne are very susceptible and so we don't want to put them at risk about we want to also recognize here again where the Holy Ghost is God is in control and you look at this you can go back in the message brother Branham talks about viruses he talks about epidemics he talks about these things it's covered my brother and sister and so what we want is to have wisdom not fear we do not want to be controlled by fear concerning coming to the house of God but we want God's wisdom and at this time in the state of Idaho because we are to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's be obedient to the law because we're a believer doesn't mean we set our own speed limit all right so it was where we're subject to these things and at this time the state of Idaho has a recommendation that when you read that it would tell us that we should not meet so that's the state of Idaho's recommendation is that if there's more than ten people we do not come together do not meet but by the same token it's not the law that's a recommendation amen are you with me so we don't want to push against these things but we want to also recognize that if we and we're still praying about this if we continue to meet if you're sick please don't come to church we have the ability to stream the service you have the ability to go on a computer and be a part of this service and I saw a lovely recommendation on how to go to church when you are quarantined or in your home and just a beautiful deal get out of bed get dressed eat your breakfast don't think you can show up late for church and when they pray you pray when they sing you sing and when they worship you worship and when the word is preached and it touches you you say Amen and so if that's where we end up going I just encouraged each one of you to approach it that way not to sit in our recliner in our bunny slippers for the bowl of Cheerios in our lap thinking we're going to church amen are you with me yes you know in the Dark Ages a very very difficult time but the prophet of God showed us that spiritually we are in the dark ages again and there was plagues but my brother and sister we also see that many mighty miracles took place in those times and and like I said I don't want to deviate and get too deep into this but some lovely quotes and things that brother Branham brings out that my brother and sister this is the time viruses brother Branham says now viruses the doctors don't even know what they are they can't even give them a name so what do they do we have coronavirus what did that come from they just gave it a name there's all these things they're just trying to cope then the Prophet goes on and says you know they can give you and brother branham actually speaks positively about well they can give you something for that virus they can give you something but it won't heal you gods our healer [Music] the prophet of God also in another place speaks up and says that the Holy Ghost in you is what seals you from this world so I need to find a balance we need to find a balance because we realize whether we're talking children sometimes older not everyone has the Holy Ghost so we don't want to say we're going to just do what we're going to do because the Holy Ghost seals us because we don't want to put those who do not have the Holy Ghost in a position where it might come back to them so believing that the Word of God says that we should come to the house of God when the doors are open I need you to pray with me that we'll have wisdom to keep the doors open or to close them and stream services I'll just be honest with you I have a tendency to say my life is in the Lord's hands it's not my hands but I don't want to put that upon you an obligation that I should not put upon you so each and every one of you if we go to streaming I would ask you please be faithful to go to church even if it's on the computer in your house if we continue to have services here in the sanctuary I would ask you to have wisdom as I said don't come to church sick if you realize you've been you know exposed now when I say expose my brother and sister I think it was my grandchildren that gave me these sniffles and I I woke up Monday morning with a sore throat and I said Lord I refused to accept this I woke up Tuesday morning with a sore throat I said Lord I refuse to accept this all week long I've had a sore throat and I continually say Lord I refuse to accept this I woke up Sunday morning I don't have a sore throat amen now did that was the passing of whatever virus that was well we can all take our position but I've confessed it I refuse to accept it right this is what the prophet of God said about our healing just proclaim your healing and refuse to accept any other verdict Amen well I want to say this morning Saints let's as believers make our confession this morning that we are sealed by the Holy Ghost and this epidemic just as the the Death Angel was in Goshen is to pass over us we refuse to accept the fear amen even the world is acknowledging fear how fear is controlling it now we as believers if the world out there recognizes the power of fear how much more we as believers should recognize that we have been delivered and are no longer subject to that yoke of bondage but we can claim our liberty in Jesus Christ so will you pray with me we were seriously considering not having church this Wednesday till we decide exactly what is happening supposedly the state of Idaho is on the very verge of saying that there would be no meetings like this and so we haven't made a decision we will be interacting with the brothers officers of the church and we'll make these decisions in the meantime I want you to get up in the morning and say he who is free is free indeed and walk through your day declaring that the Holy Ghost is in me and has surrounded me it's above me below me and I've run into the refuge amen which is Jesus Christ god bless you once again please remember us in prayer and our brother David Dean Hart I believe we'll be travelling home a brother David sister Diane Ruth this coming week brother David is in Dewey Arizona preaching at the church there with her brother Ted miss Sedley today and of course we want to remember brother Ken Curtis we don't see our brother Steve's sister Emily today hopefully and they're not sick but just be mindful of those around you the body of believers and pray for them god bless you thanks Paul's like now you can get them all excited again well I do remember when brother rich was here we took him to jump Creek and we were hiking all through there and everybody was out enjoying the sunshine and he says you know they have us all being locked up in our houses and he says the number one thing that kills virus is UV rays sunshine and we have plenty of sunshine in Idaho so we shouldn't be too bad but I do want to sing as we get ready to see brother Chris 339 these are troubled times my friend but God is in his people once again these are troubled times my friend so we must be faithful keep it perfectly with our law and that my gall is commanded Roddick Tillery terrible beep a troubled time my friend recorded things before once again oh god is it is before one again [Music] all the promises ESS the lie man a fast one the wall ran again it preparing for the day when you see longer through this blast and felt Darby people once again a faithful God is able God and let it steep for once again we call the promises yes and a bath aurilla get implants prepared for the day be honest before once again the bridge the Lord now on don't ya man I think I'll sing a song I wasn't sure if I I told him I was going to but I wasn't sure but I think I will that's alright I get that will they reach up here well it was battered and scarred in the auction or film was hardly worth his while to waste much time on the old violin but he held it up with a smile it sure ain't much but it's all we got yes we oughta sell it to now who'll start the bid on this old violin so one more and we'll be through then he cried out one gave me $1 who make it to only $2 it will make it three $3 twice now that's a good price but who's got a bid for me raise up your hand now wait any longer the auctions about to end who's got for just $1 more to bid on this old violin the air was hot and the people stood round as the Sun was setting low from the back of the crowd of a head man came forward and picks up the phone he wiped the dust from the old island and tied know the string he played out a melody pure and sweet sweeter than the angels sing and the music stopped and the auktioner or the voice that was quiet and low he said what am I bid for this old violin then he held it up with the boy and he cried out one gave me one thousand who make it to only two thousand it will make it free three thousand plus you know that's a good price who's got a bid for me people cried out what made the change we don't understand the auction you're stopped and he said with a smile it was a touch of the master's hand I know many a man with a life attitude he's battered and scarred with sin and he's auction cheap to a thankless world much like a toverland and the master comes and the foolish crown they never understand worth of a soul and the change at his Rock is by one touch of the master's hand and he cried out one gave me 1,000 who make it to only 2,000 and make it free 3,000 twice you know that's a good price but who's got a bid for me and the people cried out but made the change we don't understand the auction they're stopped and he said with a smile it was a touch of the Masters it was it of the master race over why don't we stand this morning a man was the touch of the master's hand we're ready to have a meeting this morning the Lord might be our last one here so you better get all you can't out of it scrape the bottom of the bowl amen second Kings chapter 2 verse 13 that's pray first suddenly father Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for this opportunity to come into your midst or drew this morning father we are very thankful Lord Jesus father Church back home in Phoenix Lourdes close the doors temporarily Lord and father you have given us this opportunity to come into your house once again in many other believers across the nation and done so as well or father but you've given us the privilege to gather just maybe one more time father would I pray that you would just Lord speak to your people this morning or may you take the word sword and drive it into the heart ear of your children Lord Jesus fathers we Lord are so excited that we can serve you Lord that we can Lord be known of you Lord Jesus father be considered your sheep Lord your children Lord what an honor and a privilege in the day that we live in Lord Father in this morning we just say Shalom the Lord a peace of God would cover us this morning Lord Jesus and that your word would minister Lord father the hearts that are feared this morning God that you would overwhelm them with a peace that surpasses understanding father because we know that any peace right now in this world surpasses understanding because everyone will tell you that it should be afraid but but Lord your word promised that you would give us a piece that goes beyond what the world can see father faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seeing Lord father truly your people this morning our Blessed people may you come down Lord anoint the word soul to Northeast lives we commit this into your hands and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen second Kings chapter 2 verse 13 he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah when he had also smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and Elijah went over 2nd Kings chapter 4 just turn the page verse 38 one more page and Elijah came again to Gilgal and there was a dearth in the land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he said unto his servant set set on the great pot and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild fine and gathered there of wild gourds his lap full and came and shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not so they poured out for the men to eat and it came to pass as they were eating out of eating of the Potters that they cried out and said o thou man of God there is death in the pot and they could not eat thereof but he said then bring meal and they and he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people that they may eat and there was no harm in the pot 2nd Timothy chapter 2 take a Timothy chapter 2 verse 15 study to show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as death a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection has passed already and overthrow the faith of some nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his let everyone that name was the name of Christ depart from iniquity amen president would make the Lord out of blessing the reading of his words may be seated this morning praise the Lord what title this morning is there's poison in the pot and my subtitle is where is the god of Elijah Amen praise the Lord so coat off here when we talk about poison in the pot and we talk about the meal that Elijah thrown in the meal was flour and that is that meal is a type of Christ false doctrine is the death in the pot the man went out and gathered gourds when he shouldn't have any and instead of peas we'll read a quote here in a minute and he had no revelation of what to put in the pot and throwing the meal in the pot to heal the pot was Elijah's revelation of Christ and you don't have to throw the pot out just throw Christ in the pot amen and the bride's ministry is to preach Christ to this generation and you can't preach Christ if you don't know him but the balance says in the message the power of decision he says eating what living alone Israel didn't go out and try to get some Wild Oats and break them up and make some core case though he's referring to the man that they ate in the wilderness he says that's what's the matter with the church tonight got too many Wild Oats that's your diet you need a good old-fashioned Bible diet is what you need the pastor will tell you the truth about the Bible thank God we got plenty of them but notice the wild oat diet you know there was a bunch of preachers one time who was in the seminary and there was a prophet come up to see them and you know they went out to get some peas to make some pottage and they put on a great big pot to cook it up and one of them preachers went out and you know what he done he picked a lap full of gourds and put it in there and thought it was Peas this is now a guy that didn't know the difference between gourds and peas is pretty bad shape another spot pot he says then another message brother mom says boy a man that doesn't know the difference between a peas and the gourd is some preacher he's on to say says I'm telling you some people tonight in the ministry don't know any better than that that's right don't know the difference between the power of the Holy Ghost and fanaticism skip on down a couple lines in paragraph 48 says but there happened to be a man there that had a double portion you know what he done he just went out and got a handful of meal and thrown into the pot he never destroyed the pot he never destroyed the pottage that was in the pot he just took a handful of handful of meal and throwed it in there and said eat there's life in the pot he says what did that meal present meal come through a meal offering which was a sacrifice which come from the meal offering speaking of Christ the little birds they grounded they had to grind every grain just the same showing that the grinding of the meal in the sack showed that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever and if Christ in that day in a mess of poison could bring life the same thing today put Christ in a mess of poison doctrine will bring forth life divine healing and the resurrection and the power the Holy Ghost just like it was on the beginning what we need today is past Christ into the church get away from a lot of these long-nosed theologic doctors that we got hallelujah you think I'm crazy because maybe I am but let me alone I feel good crazy you feel good crazy this morning a man he says let me lose myself and find it Lord Indy I'm a lot happier this way and 49 he says all right notice the meal made the difference said don't dump it all out now just take the same material it'll give you life that's what Christ does when you realize him to be the same yesterday today and forever it changes death to life it changed death to life with these people and I grabbed a couple pictures so you can see this is a wild pea and the next one is a wild gourd the very big difference between the two so when brother Brennan says a man that doesn't know the difference well it's some kind of man he wasn't he wasn't far off so it wasn't the flower itself that Elisha threw enough into the pot it was the anointing behind the flower amen just like your flesh man there's nothing special about your body it's the anointing that Christ has put upon it you can use it's the instruments there's nothing wrong with the piano whether it's anointing that the piano is played it's the anointing on your life that the song and the music that you sing out in your life to Christ as you live your life day to day that song the way you sing that song and portray yourself to the world is through the anointing it has nothing to do your body is no different than the man out there on the streets maybe you have a few less holes if you have a few less tattoos or no tattoos there are some superficial differences but you still have a head hair eyes nose mouth hands feet you go on but the difference is the anointing that Christ has placed in your life and that anointing comes from the Holy Spirit so when the pot had there was death in the pot a man a preacher brother madam says went out to gather the food for the pot now what is the food and as Christians of food is the Word of God and when someone without the right anointing goes out and gets and gleans from the Word of God and leans and comes back and makes some part some pottage he's gonna put wild gourds instead of the word of God otherwise he's gonna miss his opinions with the pot and what happens is it produces a pot with death in it but then people want to go and throw the whole message out they want to throw the pot out with the pottage they want to throw all of it out and say you know what none of that's no good but what happened was somebody put wild gourds in the pot somebody mixed their revelation with the word of God and he seemed all all Elijah's dippers throw a handful of meal in there the message as a whole amen there is things that people come and they say this that or the other and they have their false doctrine and stuff with that they still those from the message it's just that they took their idea and mixed it in so it's the same message but when you mix that same message with Christ you get the correct interpretation and that feeding on that brings forth the life of Christ in your body in your life so it's not the message books and your Bible for say it's the anointing bring revelation through those words this Bible itself excuse me for being so plain this thing itself will not save you the Word of God in it the words won't save you a revelation of what God is trying to say through those words is what saves you because we have people across the world today some of them maybe they're streaming they're still having services and they're reading this Bible but there are a thousand a million miles away from Christ because there's not the word the actual English word that saves you it's the anointing the revelation of who Christ it to you to people can read the same scripture and disagree on the meaning two people can read the same quotes and disagree on the meaning amen but it takes the anoying of Christ the best of God it takes the anointing the revelation to give you that sustaining power to bring life into the pot amen so that meal is a type of Christ and brother Brown says in spiritual food in due season this this message came up over and over again in my search so if you had I recommend you all of us should have plenty of time being selected home now go listen to this one it's a three hour I think but a three or four hour but it's it's really good Alliance weather but this morning so he says in he says you remember when Elijah later on had called down after that meal offering that he had Christ and sustained the widow's house with it so for the man if you are student of the message he confuses Elijah with Elijah all the time so when he says the widow's house he's thinking about Elijah but he says notice later on when he called fire and out of the heavens and so forth and proved his sinning of prophets spirit he says so he's speaking of Elijah in this quote notice in the wilderness when he was laying down there under the juniper tree and the angel came down with the same kind of meal and baked some cakes and fed him and a little later on he put him to sleep again and woke him up and he had some more meal cakes baked there for him and he went in the strength of those cakes for 40 days glory to God he's the same yesterday today and forever oh how we love him spiritual food in its season what brother but I'm saying is this the same meal that that Luo woman had in her pot it's the barrel that never went ran dry and when you see there at the beginning of Elijah's ministry what does he throw in the pot he throws the meal but they had the same revelation that spirit of Elijah God takes a man but doesn't take his spirit and Elijah as he says when the light was off he said I want a double portion of your spirit and so he was given a double portion of his spirit and weaned on it and he did double the miracles and everything that Elijah did but that meal that type of Christ that's the food that's going to carry you through he says spiritual food in it sees it and this morning I'm here to tell you that we are in the season everything that brother Branham has talked about and the two kind of things he considered to come amen we are in that time that people are crazy they're not going to go crazy the world is going to continue to get worse and worse as we go on but we are there and we have arrived in the times that we have heard about and talked about and preached about the next thing we're waiting for amen is to get out to get out of here praise the Lord but the only thing that's going to keep you but the barrel says the rapture is a revelation the only way you're going to get that's that's the same way as you caught a revelation of the opening of the seven seals you've got a revelation that water baptism is in the name of Jesus Christ those revelations this is good the same revelation but let us as a rapture is a revelation how do you get revelation you get revelation when you feed on the word underneath the anointing of Christ the Christ of God you have to have that anointing you have to be Holy Ghost filled you have to have that double portion but the venom says when Christ went up and a and was left the earth after his ministry Jesus hehe sent the Holy Spirit down upon the apostles he sent them a double portion the Bible says these works you should you should do greater works but the venom seen in the early part of this ministry he said well we can't do greater works it'll just be more but as his revelation unfolded to the Prophet what yes the Prophet had to grow and had a great gain revelation and understanding that's why you have to take an idea from 47 all the way through 65 because you can't just take it here and if it doesn't line up with the rest say that it's the truth amen and so I feel like I'm stepping on some toes this morning so I'm not trying to amen praise the Lord so what what you need I'm getting back into my train of thought here what you need is maybe I'm not supposed to stay in my train of thought we'll just Lille to the Lord and so praise the Lord I'm gonna have to go back him out I can't remember where I was we are in the season amen we are at our caitiff I left a loose in I'm sorry I cannot remember what I was saying when I said I was stepping on toes Oh have you forgive me if you remember shout it out so we are as though as the bride of Jesus Christ that the grip thank you thank you the greater works oh brother branham he said he said they know that means more works but then later on as his revelation expounded he understood that no it is greater works because God Jesus when he was here on earth he didn't take air he didn't he he created water wine from water but brother branham out hunting he spoke something into existence he spoke a squirrel into existence and he said that that's the third pool the saints of God we were living under the third poem even that's why our pastor brother Paul he got up every morning and said I refused to accept this what was he doing he was speaking amen his healing into existence and that's what you have to do to speak the salvation of your children in to exist and speak the healing of your body into existence and speak the revelation of Christ into existence if you know that there are things that you're missing you have questions in your heart and you haven't had them answered they're getting to speak that into existence and God through His grace and His mercy because he is true and he has promised that will give you that revelation he will come along and he will make it plain to you Amen to sow it as he has done to many others praise the Lord but saints of God we are in the season we are at our Kadish Barnea the Bride of Christ has come to the River Jordan so to say Amen and Joshua and Caleb have gone over and I've seen the land and said hey the fruits are good we can go in and take the land but there are many people who don't yet have that revelation that they can be victorious do you know what you know what someone that doesn't want to accept you know things well there has to be something more to come there has to be something else to happen they're afraid to say this is the day they're afraid to say it is here they're afraid to stay why because it's going to call them up to a higher calling and their lives aren't ready to step up a little bit higher but you get your life in tune with the law of the earth with the word of the hour you get your life in tune with the message God begins to call you up a little higher and a little higher and instead of being afraid to step up to that next step that step up in faith into the higher calling in Christ you are excited because you know that with that with that higher living without higher calling God's going to reveal himself to you in a greater way so if you have something in your life that you need a revelation that you need to have a question about look around on the outside look around at what's going on around you and how you're living your day-to-day life and maybe there's something you need to get rid of amen for God to come in and expound your revelation amen with revelation comes a humble confidence we're missing that mentioned that last Sunday morning with revelation comes a humble confidence Joshua and Caleb stood for the people confident not arrogant and said we can take the land don't be afraid we can take the land even they had a revelation of the promise that God had given to them you think they were the only ones who heard the promise that the promised land was theirs no everyone else heard the same thing including 10 other spies and if I'm I can have the liberty this morning I'm gonna call these spies preachers these 12 preachers went across the Jordan amen the preachers are called to go into the word and find and glean the things from deep in the word not that they have to be deep as in over your head but there's a special anointing that comes with with a preacher and he can find these things that that the lay men in the end Kent can't always find and and and God that's what God brings and uses the fivefold ministry and so these Moses said all right you preachers go over there go find out go find us the revelation go find us excuse me the revelation go find us what it is the word says about the promised land can we do this can we overcome it and they go and they heard the same word they were preaching the same word they were both all twelve were preaching about the promised land but only two said it's ours 10 said that you know the Bible says they said that it was they couldn't take it but you know what they were saying it's not ours I stand here today before you every promise in the word is yours what does the devil want to do he wants to convince you the promise isn't yours because it's too hard to attain did God say we would stand here and be just be you know pushed and guided and and and and carried through life no he said hey all right son you've accepted me as your Savior you've been filled with the Holy Ghost time to put your armor on and it's not like David trying on Saul's armor this fits perfectly you have everything you need to overcome the enemy in your life you just have to be careful who you're listening to Caleb and Joshua knew beyond a shadow of doubt they could take back their land take back their land it's already yours every proper you need a promise of maybe there's a promise in the word maybe you know the healing of a sickness and you say well I'm perfectly whole it doesn't matter if you need it now it's still yours there's countless promises in the Word of God that you have not needing today but you may need at some point but it doesn't matter all of it is yours Joshua and Caleb knew they were taking back their when they crossed over Jordan you know if the difference between them and the other guys was they said Wow doesn't it just feel like home here these are the preachers they start you start bringing up this the open Word and these things and and then they start getting really really tense and afraid why because that spirit that they're anointed with is afraid of the anointing of Christ because that anointing of Christ is what exposes those spirits in their life that are preaching the false doctrine um but you get into the presence of God for long enough that's why you have to humble yourself what what keeps you holding on to something in your life that you need deliverance from you need to overcome is pride you're not willing to humble yourself because you say well I can figure this out I can do this but saints of God I stand here they say you need God you cannot do it yourself you cannot overcome in yourself you cannot overcome this world this virus you can't overcome doubt in your life without Christ amen we believe that Elijah amen is a type of the bride and brother says in it is the rising of the Sun that's actually one of my favorite messages he says that same quickening power of God represented in both of these prophets look at their names are almost the same Elijah Elisha see the bride and the groom one of them is mr. Jesus the other one is mrs. Jesus you see almost the same just between the he and sheep see so the bride Amen Elijah is a type of the bride and what did Elijah do Elijah took a handful of meal and threw it in the pot amen chew on that for a second and the bride has a double portion of the Spirit of Christ it's in the message that's not my words if I read if I took everything that I said this morning and I found a quote for it we would just stand here and read quote that's why you have to know the message of the hour you say oh well that's brother Chris's idea I'm telling you this morning it's not my idea nothing that I preached by the grace of God I pray every time I speak Lord let me not mix my words in with yours but let it be all yours and when you go on the message and you begin to read the message and God begins to inspire you my guess they give you revelation then you hear stuff that's not verbatim the quote but it fits in perfectly because Bella perhaps that you got to read between the lines that doesn't mean you roll in there and say you make up your own doctrine that's not what it is you can read the message of the hour read the word and begin to see the thought of God expressed you begin to see the heart of God expressed to you you can only put so much heart into physical words but you can put all your heart into the anointing of Christ God it says you want he said I know you there's no way you'll be able to make it by the words that's how I went from the law to grace he says so I'm gonna give myself I'm gonna give my life and I'm gonna give you a double portion of my spirit you are anointed you are filled with the Spirit of Christ you know what that means you've already overcome the world because he's how to overcome the world you already have eternal life because he is eternal praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord Luke 9 verse 20 he says he said unto them but whom say ye that I am Peter answering said the Christ of God the anointing of God Christ is an anointing your soul is the holiest of holies in your earthly temple there is nothing special about your body like I said there was nothing special about the Ark of the Covenant itself the box with the gold plates and the cherubims that was just a physical office an object but God chose that object to anoint with his spirit just like your body there's nothing special about your body but God has chosen to anoint it with his power and his presence praise the Lord brother man I'm Nessen the message chooses your body is worth about 84 cents it's your flesh praise Lauren it is the anointing of God the Christ of God upon the vessel that makes the difference for his Lord he says why Christ speak 1959 Nicodemus well expressed it when he came by night he said good master we know that thou art a teacher come from God amen they couldn't hide it we know that you're a teacher come from God for no man can do the things that you do the work that you do let's go Appa was with him they realized that he was approved of God anointed of God he was God servant the Pharisees and the Sadducees the ones who came to tempt him the ones who who preached against him knew in their heart he was the anointed of God now watch her brother Branham says here in the square I found this just incredible he says the church had to recognize it though they hated him they called him a devil that tried to find all kinds of excuses but when it come to face the facts they believed that he was the Anointed One but they thought more of their tradition than they did the anointing of God God have mercy that we never put our tradition above the anointing I've got oh so well the song yer didn't sing exactly 30 minutes and he didn't take up the offering at 45 if you started 10 30 you know 15 he didn't take the offering up 15 minutes in between and halfway through the song service am I gonna set preach only preached an hour and preach an hour that preacher preached half an hour that preacher preached an hour and a half that preached two hours don't say no conduct or in doctrine putting your traditions oh I can't stand up and praise God in the middle of the preaching because I don't want to be out of order I don't wanna I don't want to lift my hands and lift my voice in in church because because I don't want everyone to look at me I don't want to be out of order what so we're gonna tradition is to come in you you praise God you worship God in the song sirs but then you sit and you fall asleep in the preaching oh you you you you you you you can go to you can go to these things that are just singing and my goodness then people are all fired but you put it you can put a preacher up there they're falling asleep why because they need the anointing of the music to get anything started in your life but I tell you today if you Christ inside of you and then you begin to hear the word and something begins to rise within you because there's a deep responding to the deep there's a deeper spawning through the call it's something begins to move inside of you since I've been in churches been in services well the inside of me is just bubbling up and go while on the outside I'm just bouncing the kid you don't always know you don't always know but I'm telling you the Word of God the anointing of God the Christ of God in your life it will spawn when the word comes across the pulpit that's why a lot of times you see you know you can go on you can watch the services and then forgive me God for for saying this plainly in jeffersonville know people are all hyped up and they're all shouting and saying this things but they're shouting so loud they're not listening they're hearing that they're hearing these pop phrases and these familiar words come across in there yeah amen amen amen but they're never sitting down and saying does this line up with the word and then we can try to get your emotions all worked up and try to get you all excited but if we don't preach the Word of God that excitements gonna die as soon as you walk out the church doors not that excitements not gonna carry you Monday morning Tuesday morning amen that's why you have such a low success rate but nothing against youth camps that because the kids just get all hyped up and that's all it is then that you got to take the time to find Christ we as preachers I'm getting all excited right now too but we as preachers we have to take the time to say do you get it are you getting it and preach the word preach the word across the not not to not to just get you all excited and say the things you know a lot of preachers you hear they just they just they're preaching but all they're saying is these these phrases that they know will get the people excited and get everyone shouting and everyone making all this noise but do their life bear the fruits praise the Lord Wow amen don't let your traditions win over the anointing of God don't let tradition stop you from moving oh brother Chris that's your idea is it a paragraph well the number is not there the hand of the Lord came upon him 1954 and Elijah done eight miracles in his life Elijah done sixteen miracles in his life and you people who claim to have the Holy Spirit then afraid to trust God for the supernatural I don't understand him I cannot understand it but a double portion of the blessing is on the church and we're afraid to move what's the matter with you friend I'm kind of wondering 19:54 the handle or came upon him it can pull the quote in the table and I can show you I didn't splurge my words in there he says I can't understand how a double portion that the blessing is on the church and we're afraid to move oh brother I'm just waiting on the Lord how long are you gonna wait before you stand up and cross over Jordan with Caleb and Joshua oh you say you say well brother Chris that they had the Promised Land that was a promise that God had given to them it was according to the word did God transport them across the river Jordan no Joshua and Caleb and the guys they had to get their feet wet they had to get themselves all muddy the Jordan River was muddy we know that because of the story of name and I don't want to go wash myself myself in the Jordan perfect transition right there naman had to go down to the river say oh I accept my healing and naman was expecting just the flowery words be healed O king or he wasn't a king captain naman be healed he was gonna feel all sensation on his body and he was gonna be transformed no huh he had a walk through the muddy banks of Jordan climbing that dirty nasty muddy river wasn't polluted it was just dirty and gross you ever seen him oh you guys have-have him all around here to tank a water tank you ever seen a water tank with the cows drink it's a nasty little pond that's probably what the jordan river looked like if brush enough the the the the well it would have been a river so there wouldn't have been algae on top but you know what I'm saying brushing aside the muddy weeds and climbing through the mud why he hadn't make that step forward yes God had given him his healing but God said first you need to wash in the river children amen Josh when Caleb had to get their feet wet to go and claim their promise sometimes you have to move to claim your promise that can be manifested in many different ways we're moving to a different Church from moving spiritually and and then putting things Amen when you smooth Psalms you have to get rid of stuff and the natural man you do get rid of stuff sometimes when you need to move spiritually you need to let go let go of well that's how I was taught you know what that is that's tradition when you say why I can't let go of this and you constable is this true because I heard this all my life when even though you know that doesn't line up with the word but you accept it anyways because well it's it's it's a comfortable you know tradition is comfortable tradition is very comfortable that's why what sometimes you go to another country god bless my sister coming over here she understands it everything is different you're not as comfortable it takes time to say it takes five years to readjust the living in another country everything is different it's not traditional you know in America we do things different than then over in Ukraine and Russia but you know they do stuff different than we do over here it's the same way if I went over there I'd be Wow okay where's you know where's the pizza shop you know what I'm saying praise the Lord Amen so here we have Elijah a type of the bride some time along here this morning I'll get to my sermon Elijah the type of the bride and he Elijah receives a double portion from Elijah and Elijah he said is presented with a part of pottage a hat that is full of poison that's poison in the pot and he says under the anointing of that double portion which we're calling the Holy Spirit he takes the meal which is Christ and puts it in the pot the Bride of Christ isn't called to go about spreading their ideas they're not called did you know the bride has a ministry I was in question and answers by the man was asked does the bride have a ministry and he says yes the bride has a ministry that's the time that we're in now whether you get up and preach has nothing to do with it did you know that you can be a well respected person in a group of fellowship and you say something contrary to the Word of God you plant doubt in those people's heart because they respect you for who you are on the contrary you you recognize you have that position of respect and you you preach the Word of God you're gonna lift the people higher you don't have to get behind the pulpit to preach a message you don't have to get a pope buying the hope it's a to be part of the McBride's ministry so here it is Elijah says hey there's death in the pot you recognize another brother and sister that there's death in the pot you begin to speak Christ to them you throw a little me a handful of meal in their pot and watch God you don't have to go get a new person you use the same pot in the same pottage you just throw a little bit of Christ in you watch God bring that death and make it into life amen but I just felt the need to throw this in here when I was now studying it up because so many times a lot of the faults and and the issues we have are on the message now amen ever since believe the sign which that's not the only instance but that's the big one right now is people have fallen away because they lifted up a man higher than God and then they saw that man's faults but Elijah a type of the bride had a double portion of cry of the holy spirit of Elijah but he's walking through one day and the 42 children come out laughing at him calling him old bald head your brother man says the message he said he wasn't old he went bald young I have a good friend of mine and back home who's bald young and there's hope and so he got offended he turned around Elijah was a double portion let me tell you something if you knew Elijah and you saw him receded of a portion the the flesh Manion you would want to lift him up this is a man this is a godly man and which is nothing wrong with that but you lift him up so high you think he's perfect and he has no faults and then you see the backside of Elijah and now you turn and say well the whole thing's bad throw the pot with the pottage out what does it lie to do he calls she-bears out of the woods to kill 42 children as your pastor ever called murder down upon children but he speaks the word across the pulpit and you become offended you say well I'm gonna throw the whole thing out because I can't accept that when it's God's speaking truth under the anointing of Christ trying to bring your life into a higher position as you say oh you you if you were to saw Lysa or seated up a portion and you were to saw him do that how would you have felt don't sit there with your sunday tie and your dresser on and say oh well I wouldn't have cared you would have who would have been questioning this man Elijah you see even a prophet we get mad and kicked the dog and you want to say that brother needs the Holy Ghost or we get upset that's why it's such a such a bad thing to talk to I mean it can work it can work and there is instances I an example of one instance there's a lot of us that work together are believers but there is a lot of situations where you know though believers work with one another and you see though you see the flesh man coming in Monday morning just tired and grumpy you go this man don't even have those ghosts you see him yelling or smash his hand with a thumb up his ham his thumb with a hammer and you he starts yelling and hollering no not cussing because then you would be questioning him amen praise the Lord amen but that's what happens people lift men up and that until God actually brings those men down to sure that people hey you don't need a man to serve me you need me amen amen um but LeBaron says in the Prophet Elisha in 1954 he says now could you imagine after that blessing being promised this young preacher how he kept his eyes right on Elisha I tell you if somebody said look over here Elisha or some noise happened over here Elisha kept his eyes right on Elisha he wanted that double portion and if you want that double portion tonight keep your eyes on Jesus don't pay any attention to what the devil says what the critic says what the unbeliever says keep your eyes set on calvary saying lord you promised it amen if you want a double portion you got to keep your eyes on Christ just like the story of the boy that rode his bike across to the other two before whatever was he won all the other guys that were you know good riders fell off and they said well how'd you do and he said I just kept my eyes on the goal amen as Christians we have to keep her eyes on the goal because guess what the outside noise is going to get louder and louder and now when you're trying to record say trying to record a song they have a they have a way to them to bring the and forgive I don't know the technical term to bring the the input into the mic to bring and cancel out the noise on around the around the outside it's called the noise gate you know however long however much you you said it as soon as you close off of the mic it picks up your voice but doesn't pick up the voices around you I mean you got to get right into Christ that noise gate 100% closed so you don't you don't hear after you got your headphones on and and you're singing into the mic you're singing your song for Christ you're singing your life for Christ and the rest of the world you can't hear the noise all you have is a direct communication a dialog with Christ it's not a monologue it's a dialogue because he doesn't have to speak back with an audible voice but he can feel it's anointing in your heart I was I was really I read I don't know if any of you do the our daily strength it's an app the devotional app and I read it one day and he was talking about you know you know ask for revival in your life and I was walking along where I was driving along and what I was doing and and I said lord I pray I was thinking about I said lord I pray you were a revival in my life that's all I said and all of a sudden there was just sweet anointing and I said you know what the Lord was pretty pleased with that request that was dialogue that was dialogue you constantly say Lord I need this I need that I need this I need that that's monologue you begin to say thank you Lord there's a visible there's a there's a there's an obvious difference when you pray and you say you know you begin to to testify of who Christ is you begin to say thank you begin to praise him you don't never once have to ask for the healing of your sore throat because when you get done praising him guess what your heal why because what brings the healing the anointing of president Lauren and your faith in that atmosphere amen um the bride's ministry there called the throne meal in the pot sometimes well distr up the waters to Elijah took the mantle of Elijah said where's the god of Elijah and struck the water that's why I said you have being Christ and have a humble confidence because sometimes there's too many people there too she she pinched the to afraid to speak up you're too afraid to say where's the god of Elijah it's too afraid to stand up and say you know what that's not what the word says yes be careful there okay you don't want to start arguments but you know what I'm saying this morning prophet Elijah in 1850 Elijah in 1954 again just number couple paragraphs down he says notice now as Elijah went up Jesus promised a double portion of his spirit to the believers the things that I do show you also even greater and on the day of Pentecost when he went up on the day of the Ascension on the day of Pentecost the same Holy Ghost was upon him come again upon the church and I wanted today people who claim to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and claim that they have kissed the rims of the cup of blessings of God how can we hold our peace when we see things going on the way it is it's time to take this holy spirit that we're anointing with and say where is the God that was upon Jesus Christ where is the God of Abraham Isaac and of Jacob where is the God that was on our Lord Jesus Christ that's the blessings and as in this that great crisis there you had someone to turn back to this quote is so fitting for this morning as in the great crisis out there you have someone to turn back to he says although Elijah was gone here was the one that poured water on his hand that had a double portion of his spirit so is this sick in sinful world today looking to a real Church of the Living God that's you in this crisis who possesses a double portion of his spirit what can you do in this time brother our answer shouldn't be who's going to be the next president or some theology we should give to the limb give to them the Living God the resurrected Lord Jesus cuz he goes down to find out in this great crisis your call as a bride of Jesus Christ underneath the bride's ministry to go out into the sick and sinful world today and see and give to them the Living God the resurrected Lord Jesus you talk to somebody and you see the fear in their eyes you begin to say you know what those are scripture in Psalms 46 first one the Lord is our strength and a very present help in a time of trouble but also our refuge and strength a very present help in a time of trouble because I tell you what when there's a crisis people's hearts are softened towards God because they're afraid and they know because they were created by God whether or not they confess that God is alive and God is real they were created by God there's something in their heart that identifies you know what God can solve this and then but you have been given the ministry to go along and say you know uh you don't have to have a spirit of fear if you get the Spirit of Christ he will give you peace he will give you confidence he will give you sound mind I mean we are not called to bring a Ministry of confusion people go around and they have their own ideas and all they do is cause problems I mean I think it was in back in Thanksgiving when I was here I read the court brother said brother Branham says don't run with this doctrine and get all weird don't get all weird if you think it sounds weird it probably does don't repeat it don't go beyond I've had a brother Ronnie and then he's told me that you know as a as a young preacher I got so much to learn and he said you know preach what you know you as an individual as a Christian preached what you know what you know that you know that you know that's a brother around says don't try to preach these great doctrines to them just preach to them what Christ did for you because you know and there's a big difference in the anointing when you're preaching something that has directly affected you and that's directly spoken to you and has directly affected your life and your heart that your anointing there is powerful then you get out here then you start getting you know into all these other doctrines and stuff that that this person did you know they're just afraid to the coronavirus they don't care about serpent seed you understand what I'm saying then it gets gets all intellectual and then you find yourself in an argument and then you both go away and happy and afraid for his dolorous we're not called again bring a Ministry of confusion even amongst mother well did you so did you hear you know I read this quote I thought it was interesting oh you know it contradicted with what father Graham said over here what keep your mouth shut all you're doing is spreading doubt if you have a doubt about it take it to Christ take it to your pastor take it to another preacher I'll take it to your pastor if you go to this church because you take it to another preacher you might be talking to one of those ten that won't overdrawn and said we can't take the land so don't come to me for advice go to your pastor not that I'm one of those tears my goodness I'm just getting all I'm taking a lot but it's not in Jesus right now praise Lord amen a testimony you will testify of the revelation of Christ because that's what's going to carry you through you can can't preach Christ if you don't know him if I didn't know my uncle Paul there's no way I could describe what it look like or what his behavior is or how he has to have eggs and bacon in the morning got to have me in the morning it has to have breakfast if I don't know him I can't tell you that stuff right I can't tell you about Christ if I haven't met Christ amen there's death in that pot because preachers and people don't know Christ Christ so they pick gourds instead of peas and you saw what you saw the pictures of how obvious the two are now when you have a revelation of Christ false doctors and doctrines I haven't need to get up here and preach to you all of the false doctrines and I don't need to get up here I don't need to name them all for you with the revelation of Christ if I'll ever let revelation you see those two pictures out obvious and plain of this it's the same thing with Christ when you have a revelation it's obvious to you and sometimes we can become carnal we can become indifferent because to us it's so obvious but to them it's not because they what's wrong with you well they just need revelation and if you just go in you blast some out of the water and you say what's wrong with you why can't you figure this out why can't you get this all you're gonna do is chase them away and that as we know isn't gonna get you anywhere you need revelation to rightly divide the word of truth we read that scripture in the beginning it's in 2nd Timothy chapter 2 verse I think it's 18 7 or 15 as Lord I'm closing here we need we don't need your revelation you might have had the same revelation as me if you're a believer you have the Holy Ghost but I don't need your revelation I need my own revelation of Christ to me we need the Christ of God producing within us a revelation that's why believers don't read the Bible like a newspaper what does that mean that means reading the Bible outside of the anointing and you don't have to go in and and and and fast for a day and pray for 36 hours together the anointing you say Lord I'm about to open your word speak to my heart the Bride of Christ is coming into maturity and the times that we're living in they're getting away from all these this hypes and this worked up stuff - nope they have they have a humble confidence they know who they are in it when they know when they speak God's obligated to answer it so they open their Bible and they say Lord speak to my heart that's all they have to do and Christ will Scott will speak to them yeah something that that you know we can stand with conference excuse me before the enemy we can say Satan get lost you know why those those are the devil says if we don't know who you are and they beat up those guys and they some running naked they didn't know them because there was no Christ inside of them but you have Christ inside of you the devil knows who you are and he trembles he trembles he's scared he's scared to death this morning in this building he's got his virus spread all over the world he's causing panic and frustration and fright but you guess what hit you think his the guns are trained on them no he's got his gun trained on us today he's got guns trained on every believer in the world right now because he's trying to bring fear into your life and if you accept that fear you've just given victory to the enemy you say Lord I don't want to accept this for you not giving me a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind praise the Lord fear is a powerful thing but Christ the love of God is far more powerful it's the most powerful force on the planet amen of the musicians will come I don't know how long I've preached hopefully I preached long enough and then preach too long so stop going around adding gourds to the pot and then if you don't know which ones to go order which the P don't even bring them to the table get across the river Jordan in the presence of the Lord and get your double portion Jordan is death to self Elijah had to cross the river Jordan with Elijah to receive the double portion just like you as a Christian you have to cross over death to self the River Jordan you have to confess your your your false your weaknesses your and you have to say Lord I can't do anything I surrender all to you and when you surrender then God can come and do his work within you go across River Jordan surrender to Christ get your double portion then come back out here and start spreading the meal starts gonna start going around and spreading Christ not your own ideas not your opinion not your distrust in this person or your or your or what you think this person is or the problems this person is causing gossip don't go around spreading all that go around talking about Christ someone says you know what did you hear about this pastor just announced the message oh that's crazy did you know Christ has given me an overcoming power there's always a way to turn the conversation back into Christ and if and there's always a way to turn the conversation back into Christ if you I don't know if I if you if that person is a godly person and they've just gotten their eyes off of that they'll agree with you and you'll start having good fellowship but if it's press if someone if it's someone you shouldn't be fellowshiping with fellowshipping with and you keep speaking Christ speaking Christ and they keep you know getting weird and turn the conversation back until they finally go well just have a nice day man and they walk away you just need to go back and pray for them there's something down in their heart man that needs to be changed stand in humble confidence you read you know what there's nothing wrong with keeping up to date don't start going reading reading people's opinions about the pandemic reading people's opinions about the virus it's fine knowing what does the governor say to do that's fine you know you'd be foolish if you just kept your head stuck in the sand but don't feed on that because that's the that right now that's the devil's gospel he's preaching you know he started out in February I'm opening a new series called coronavirus and the thing he's preaching it in in his church Satan's Eden called Kovan 19 in part 19 he's spreading the gospel of fear but do you realize that you have an incredible part to play as a son and daughter of God God is calling you to rise up and begin to spread the gospel of peace blessed are the feet of those Amen however it goes that spread the gospel the good news for the gospel of peace our feet are sha our feet are shod with peace what does that mean why is it your feet because you have to walk around you have to go spread it out when someone comes with you to fear and they want to talk about even though even believers they need encouragement say well God has not given us the spirit but a power and of love and of a sound mind and you pray listen you got to trust God the the crazier the world gets the more and more and more stuff like this is gonna cause us to look into only one place and that's to Christ we have to stop looking at a be profane and we have this up looking to advil nothing wrong with those but you can't put your faith in them because they didn't heal you Christ healed you through the ibuprofen we heard that from our pastor praise the Lord so where is the God that was upon Jesus Christ it is within you now strike the water and cross over where is the god of Elijah where's the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob where is the God the anointing of Jesus Christ stay with me it's in me it's in me say it again it's in me the state the Spirit of Christ is within me a the devil comes and says you need to be afraid you can't even go to church anymore you need to be afraid you need to be scared put you find a cozy corner with your bunny slippers in here full of Cheerios Union you need to you need a counter in the corner to be afraid say now I don't accept that Satan but I accept the power of Christ I just I feel so noted right now thank you God accept the power of Christ there is nothing in this world you have to fear except the power of Christ it's right here it's it's it's it's it's in my hand if you will all you have to do is get off your seat and come and take it from me accept the power of Christ it's a free gift to you you say Oh those words are so familiar I always hear the preachers say it that's it still truth today you have to accept the power of Christ you turn it down you maybe you you only have two options except the power of Christ or accept the spirit of fear you did not want you accept the other period there is no middle of the road there is no fence to set upon we heard that you know the story devil comes back says well I own the fence get in get safe and then don't spread chick-fil-a sauce on your doorpost it's not gonna save you nobody's none of you saw that okay amen praise the Lord it's god it's Christ in you the hope of glory praise the Lord what are we playing amen let's sing that and then we'll have brother Paul or brother Jason come shine Oh shine whoa let the light on the lighthouse Shyne I know me oh sure I know me wool or shine on me let the light from the light Shyne and on me hey man we'll sing it again but what gives you what gives you

we don't throw the porridge out we put Christ in it amen thank you lord thank you lord Alleluia you know I I just was inspired a little bit this morning brother Chris the quote traditions I just kind of got me kind of fired up a little bit because you see if we're not careful we'll build our own tradition you know and when our tradition gets messed up we go to church and our tradition got tweaked and we go home it's like it was a terrible day at church because nobody honored my tradition oh my lord help us oh it was good brother Chris I really like that amen now I don't like to normally digest somebody's sermon for him I just go ahead and preach my own at the end but look look at this I was thinking about this you know one time you know a person you might call him a critic or whatever they said well you know these message people got their blinders on amen they got cognitive dissonance well my brother and sister the cognitive dissonance if you don't know the definition of it look it up in the dictionary later but you know it's kind of like ignoring the facts that are before you well who dictates the facts amen the world's got one set of facts if you don't lock yourself in your house you're gonna die well I've got a set of facts and we will sing that song here in just a minute my set of facts says the name of the Lord is a strong tower that I hide in amen you know when they start dying inside their houses my brother and sister go back to go back to Egypt they didn't have to be hanging out in the street the death angel went and found them in their house hallelujah well we got the Holy Ghost in our house amen we got the blood over the doorpost and we don't have to be afraid of anything amen hallelujah so thank you lord but they say you know you've got cognitive dissonance you're ignoring the facts well I'll tell you the fact is I never belonged on this I don't belong here now and I'm not claiming it in Satan's Eden as my home I'm claiming it after it's burnt over the Holy Ghost and fire is what is keeping me alive hallelujah anyway this same person's like well always message people got blinders on thank you brother Chris hallelujah I'm glad this morning I got blinders on all I can see is the end of the goal amen I see the finish line I see Christ I don't see what's going on over here I don't see what's going on over here but I'm riding my bicycle hallelujah down that little narrow gospel plank and I'm gonna ride it because I'm not looking at this side or this side I'm gonna ride it right to the end and I'm gonna be successful and as it were I'm gonna get my own bicycle and that's the one I'm gonna ride on the streets of glory hallelujah hallelujah I said all right if I preach for just a second Amen I was just reading and and I'll probably bring this back up again in a message but I was just studying and brother branham says here now you know they they talk about viruses and they talk about all of these things and brother branham says you know they say that the biggest killer is heart disease but brother branham said I'll just paraphrase it here brother branham says no they're not right the biggest killer is sin disease hallelujah see I'm not afraid of this virus and how many it'll kill amen I'm not afraid of any of these things out here my brother and sister I'm afraid of the sin disease and I don't say that as in a fear but you know I look at that and say you know what I'm more concerned about the sin disease so I just want to make a little announcement my brother Chris was preaching I felt like the Lord laid on my heart we will have church Wednesday night because I'm more afraid of the sin disease than I am of the disease out here I'm more desirous to be in the presence of the Lord than I am in the fear of the devil hallelujah so Wednesday night 7:30 in case' any of you amen as I said earlier I don't take that back we want to use wisdom we want God's guidance we want to be good stewards and but I believe we also follow the leadership of the Lord amen so you know what you know you think about that sin disease well just take the whole world a couple of blinders on take the whole world just give me Jesus that's what I want to see I want to see Jesus hallelujah well Alleluia know there's something brother Chris sadness I got to get it off my chest here you know reminds me of a little story I read in history I believe it was World War one between the French and the Germans and the Germans were sending soldiers and they were creeping and crawling in the darkness of night and the fog and they were I hate to bring this up in church this way but they were slipping into the lines and they were killing these French soldiers so a buddy might wake up in the morning maybe had fallen asleep at his post of duty and his friend beside him had been mandated to death in the darkness of the night and it instilled a fear into the heart of these soldiers their testimony become the enemy is behind our lines in other words we're completely the enemy is everywhere we don't know where the enemy is at in the very earliest hours this was a time at there that that the fog a season the weather the fog would settle in you couldn't hardly see and the Germans after having done this for many days creeping into the lines and killing these French soldiers and one morning in the darkness and the fog of the early morning the Germans started clamoring and blowing their their horns they still use them in those days many times they blew their horns and the the French understood that was the horn that said charge attack and the French because fear had permeated their lives they didn't rise up out of the trench and fight they rose up out of the trench and ran my brother and sister you might say well we've we've had some tough times brother Paul maybe in my life my family circumstance my brother and sister just because the devil's blowing his trumpet doesn't mean we turn and run it

happened in our nation that my brother and sister will turn heaven and earth will plow the highways will do everything for some social events some sporting event or whatever and I'm just amazed at the condition of our country when they say that a minister going to preach the gospel it's not essential but that's where they stand and brother Dwayne won't be able to come because they won't let him across the border so I kind of you know sometimes I won't call it the spirit of fear but you kind of like well we'll pull back so that's what I'd like to announce we won't have young people's again on
