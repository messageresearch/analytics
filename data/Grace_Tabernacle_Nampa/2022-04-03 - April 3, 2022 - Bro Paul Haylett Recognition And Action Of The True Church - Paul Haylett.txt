once again i want to welcome everyone this morning greet you in the name of jesus christ and those joining us on the internet god bless you and again to our visiting good to have you amen uh brother chris has some announcements to make before he does i just quick one myself and that's next sunday we'll be having communion at five o'clock of course regular service sunday morning and then at five o'clock we'll be having communion good to have everyone here for that amen brother chris if you'd come like i'm doing this a lot lately but at that time of year things are things are happening so it's exciting um so a few announcements um first there's a youth meeting this friday at 7 pm at our house and then grace kids i'm assuming at uh for the surgeon sister julius so seven o'clock at our house um and they want to pull the picture up here we went my family and i went out yesterday to look at the campground this is just the only picture i really have of the pavilion where we'll be holding services it was very nice facility good atmosphere i know it seems like a little thing but when we pulled in there was a cross right there on the back of this and so just very um comfortable for a church camp they have lots of church functions there um that's always nice to have and it's a nice atmosphere it's very beautiful hasn't budded yet right like the rest of of things but you can it's it's a gorgeous location there's plenty of room for everybody we have enough spots for everybody's trailer and we have room for one more guest trailer so there's a couple of people on our but the terry t catch was mentioning coming down whether jose maybe so we're going to send out the form um either later today or tomorrow a couple of things i needed to finalize on that and if you had someone who asked express the desire to come if you could send that to them everyone filled that out by may 31st so but there's plenty of room for tents and if there's if we're fully booked up um i think we can have room for an additional four three or four tenths if people still want to come and enjoy um things during the day and the services and things there's lodging nearby in idaho city it's close but the roads kind of windy so it doesn't feel as close but it is close enough to drive there and back but that is not an invitation for any of you to do that if you belong to grace tabernacle you stay in the campground so just making sure i got everything there's hiking trails right off the camp there's some steps that go out of the campground and access to the public land so we'll probably attentively do a hike on the saturday so we're looking forward to that that's in july um 14th through the 17th we'll send out the form have that filled out anybody who wants to come send it to them we need to to know ahead of time so the other thing is tomorrow our registration for the health camp uh median life fellowship camp opens at one o'clock so tomorrow registration for the camp in june opens at 1pm last year um it opened at one o'clock by 1 15 or later or earlier it was overbooked by six six or so people so i most of you probably remember everyone was ready to go before one o'clock we're hitting the refresh button and as soon as it opened filled out the form so if you plan to go you need to be online we'll send the link on the youth chat you need to be online by 1250 right i mean ready to go make sure you hit the refresh button because if it's not wired a certain way won't refresh for you it'll open and you'll sit in there staring at it closed until you refresh it then you could could possibly miss it so at 12 50 get on there and be ready to sign up because it's going to go fast it went fast last year you think oh well this year covid's been gone but everybody's remembering how fast it went last year so it's just going to keep doing that every year it's a popular uh camp with the low amount of allowed campers so tomorrow one o'clock it opens up the fee is around two hundred dollars and we'll be flying the group down there we're not going to drive this year we're going to fly the lord will watch out for for all of us flying is safer than driving actually it's june 1st through the 6th that's the dates for the trip the campus starts the second and goes through the sixth so we'll come down one day earlier and fly out the sixth which is wednesday through monday tickets are around three hundred dollars give or take depending so keep an eye on that because with the way the world is right now they're getting expensive fast so i talked with our pastor if you need assistance if you need assistance it's not like you'd rather buy a new exhaust for your bike or that 150 louis vuitton purse it's a need we want to know either talk to me or our pastor um because if you there's no way for you to go we want to help you go because we think it's important to go um so there's a situation where you can't make it you know talk to either me or or a pastor so tomorrow the most important thing for you to remember right now is tomorrow at one o'clock is a camp registration so i'm gonna say i'm gonna stop saying one o'clock tomorrow at 12 50 p.m is the camp registration you will have to pay when you sign up so it's around two hundred dollars give or take so if you need assistance if you need assistance underlying bold talk to us so that's all i have looking forward to what we have coming up this year and praying that the lord will just bless everything lord bless you amen as brother paul comes let's sing number 888 i keep listening for a different sound [Music] we hear about the wars see famine in the land there's questions in the children's eyes trouble in the east again the whole world is shaking there's no sure place to stand and mournful sounds are heard throughout the land but i keep listening for a different sound the sound of the city that john saw coming down the sound of the bride being united with the grill i keep listening i keep listening i keep listening for a different sound i remember the preacher saying son it shall come to pass there will come a generation that will be the last i can't believe i'm standing here seeing the end of time and the preacher's voice still echoing in my mind [Music] listening for a different sound sound on the city that john saw coming down the sound on the bride being united with the groom i keep listening i keep listening i keep listening for a different sound scene again well i keep listening for a different sound sound of the city that john's all coming down the sound on the bride being united with the groom but i keep listening i keep listening i keep listening for a different sound can we say amen to that this morning amen lots of voices in the land but by god's grace our ear has been turned to his voice he says my sheep hear my voice and just thankful today that we can stand and say thank you lord that my ear has been tuned to your voice amen hallelujah well i just want to reiterate what brother chris had said to our young people we want to see you go to camp we're not trying to dictate a camp to you but i believe it's good uh i can look back in my own youth and uh you know there comes a time if we're not careful we feel very disconnected like well we're just this little nothing's here and you know don't feel like we belong like we fit in and we don't the lord never intended for us to fit into this world and uh but there is a whole group of youth around this world that are serving god with their whole heart mind body and soul and um it is our desire not only for you to hear the preaching of the word and take place with that but to have a connection with the body of believers to realize that there are young people that have been called of the lord just like you have been that god has a desire for you to build these friendships to to have these peers my brother and sister and young people please hear me if you view the world out here as your peer you will be sadly disappointed because they're anointed by an entirely different anointing our peers whether we're young or old are sons and daughters of god the bride of christ is our peers amen hallelujah well i just want to uh just come this morning i trust that i can preach this it's quite lengthy i one short scripture and just hours of quotes but um you know it's just um you know things that been stirring my heart i i confess to you and and i i hope you can see the humor in it i went around the house and collected up all the books that i've got one by this chair one by that chair one in the library one in the bedroom and i collected them all up and i put them away in the library and i'm just trying to now if i want to sit down in the easy chair i go find the book that i'm reading and take it back to the easy chair with me and having done that i can actually now say wow my sermon was based the real thought the heart of it come from one sermon amen and one message amen broke up in many parts but one message anyway thank you so much brother jason once again i just have to say not to lift my brother jason up but the songs that lord laid upon his heart today once again uh are in continuity with just the very things that we've been looking at i just want to speak to you this morning once again over the overall topic of the two sides of obedience and i want to speak to you on recognition and action of the true church and if we'll just stand and turn in our bibles to the book of acts the first chapter verses one through eight and uh so in this we will uh take our our thought today and tying it directly back to uh the message that i had been reading and studying out of and um just believe it's very beautiful acts 1 1 the former treaties have i made o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach i'm going to make a whole list i'm going to bring a whole discourse to you of the things that jesus began both to do and to teach now we want to take this out of this the reason the word began is there luke didn't use this by accident you see this teaching and this doing have never ended so if we would think okay jesus ministry was finished you hear phrases and i i give the benefit that is verbiage but you see people say well you know jesus ministry ended i'm sorry his ministry will never end amen it's eternal and there is a part of this that i i want to focus today to bring to you that it's fine that we have the teaching but we have to have the doing also so if we just have teaching but no doing we become theologians we become we become educated but by the opening of the word and it's striking the heart the true seed something has to happen amen until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost has given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen now i want to and then we'll just go on and read the scripture in its entirety i want you to remember as we go on now in the book of acts here you'll see that as they go to choose a replacement for judas man's choosing never yielded anything for the kingdom bethes was a good man he would be our brother he would be but you see he was chosen of man and the scripture says here see the apostles whom jesus had chosen so there's a difference between the choosing of a man and god choosing the man and i just wanted to make that point amen certainly nothing against him he was faithful he desired to serve but we definitely want the lord to be in control amen tomb also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence and i love that right there because you see he's giving them a timeline of expectancy he didn't say someday this will happen but wait he did say someday this will happen but he told them it's it's going to happen soon but remember this is the mind of god speaking amen and in this case it did happen soon but the word says that he's coming for you and i quickly yes sir and yet we see the years pass by and many people say well brother brown said this and it didn't happen well for every quote that you can say brother branham said he believed it would happen within the year or within this time frame we forget to mention the one where he said it might be 100 years so our urgency my brother and sister is not an urgency that's lost by the passing of time but it's an urgency as we see the passing of time does that make sense so the closer as we see the day of proaching there's an urgency amen and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he you have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they ask of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom of israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his have put in his own uh power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in all of judea and samaria and to the outermost part of the earth emily father we just ask for your blessings on the word today father we thank you for your grace lord your unending father eternal grace lord that you so freely give to us father it humbles our hearts lord to realize that lord in the very creation of flesh you knew the element that father we needed you place that element within us lord you give us an ability oh father i thank you lord as i studied this thought the inspiration it gave to my own heart my own soul and we just say thank you today father for the ability we love you i ask you to bless your word today in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you and of course as the body of believers there is no visitors and so we always just come together as a part of the body of christ amen you know sometimes as we look in the word power as it is in verse 8 here he says but ye shall receive power and you know sometimes i think we really misunderstand what god was laying out there and you know some believe and and i'm just going to speak just for a moment as it were vaguely out of the history of my own life some believe that the power that was given was all placed into the ministry and everyone else was subservient to that but the prophet of god did not teach that and the word of god does not teach that there's only one power that we become subservient to and that is jesus christ himself amen the holy ghost we yield ourselves to that so as we uh would look at this it is not a power my brother and sister to boss everyone around it's not a power for the preacher to boss the church around it's not even a power given for us to tell the devil what to do now i want you to think about that some people boldly i told the devil well my brother and sister if the verbiage is correct well i i don't criticize the words but you see my brother and sister it's not in us to have the ability to tell the devil what to do if you need a scriptural example example we look at the seven sons of siva who looked out and said well we just saw what they have done they have spoke to these demons so spoke to these servants they uh uh demons the servants of the devil and and we're going to just bind them like that now it would have been embarrassing to come running back out the door with your clothes tore off and scratches and no doubt maybe even bites or whatever it would be all over you terrified my brother and sister proving that manning himself is no match for the devil but it's there that when we come sometimes in the religious realm people say well because i'm a christian i can tell the devil what to do but let's look what brother branham says here just in a glimpse out of awakening jesus he said that life that's within us is not only a creative life but it's part of his own life that's the reason we have the authority to speak to a devil because it's god's own creative life if you're anointed you so it's not even for us just to say because god sent a prophet and i can read this quote i'm going to tell the devil what to do now because the life is in us this creative life when you speak it's not you speaking but it is your father that is in you that is speaking and so it's there we have to have the right approach to see brother branham tempered this with saying if you're anointed so a man could be reading this quote and say i'm going to speak to the devil i'm going to deal with this i'm going to do this but if he doesn't have the holy ghost it's still a man speaking but if we've got the holy ghost my brother and sister we don't have to sit back and watch the devil kick the windows out of our house we can stand firmly upon the word and we can speak those things and bind the devil in the name of jesus christ so our real goal ultimately i guess you would say is that we live in the presence of god but we see the priests lived in the presence of god and god had to choose samuel to speak to them so it's not even just living in the presence but it's being filled with the presence of god it's having christ in the position of headship amen we have these jokes and i i kind of laugh at them they're kind of getting old when people talk about well my husband might be my head but i'm the neck that turns it well my brother and sister that's that might make good family humor but in the end of the day there ought to be one where the wife is praying that the only thing that can turn the husband's head is the holy ghost not the spirits of the age not the whim or will now i'm not anybody that's ever spoken that i'm not criticizing you i'm just making a point you see it's not us we can't do that the devil's not the least bit afraid of you but it is this life that is in you and this is why it's so important that we grasp in the godhead that it is not only christ above us and with us he has to be in us and so without that portion we could and i i don't mean to be negative but we can go to a message church we can confess the message is true we can be baptized we can do all of these things without that coming to fruition we will be as powerful as any other person but when we get everything in the right order according to the teaching of the word amen then we can come as we've been speaking on wednesdays look when jesus was there and he was with all the priests and everything and joseph and mary come and mary speaks and says oh your father and i well my brother and sister you see jesus couldn't have said i don't want to embarrass my mama i don't want to leave anything confusing out here as it were and do this and so i'll just ignore it but no my brother and sister the holy ghost will not uh ignore the air and that's why any minister that's worth his salt wheel we'll look at this a little bit any minister worth his toll would rather have you angry at him now than you angry at him on the day of judgment he'd rather take the flock as it were now that you don't like what he's preaching because you see the true word can't ignore the air nor do we want it to you know there's nothing more frustrating than to be working on a piece of equipment and you know it's easy to tear things apart you know it's easy to tear up at church do you know it takes quite a bit of effort to build up a church real easy to criticize and talk about how you're not believers and you're not applying yourself and you're not this but what does it take then to take and this this assembly let's just speak to ourselves and build this up to where you know hey uh i don't know i mean not you but people like you got upset yesterday that's good emphasis bro brother trevor but you see it's not about getting upset it's about what we did after we got upset and so god's given us the answer to our question to the sin question we have the answer we don't have to say i hope to find this answer we have the answer amen so by god's grace we can move forward and be strengthened so you see this life that's within us is not only creative life and that's what i want grace tabernacle to be i want the atmosphere of the holy ghost in this assembly to be a creative life to create an atmosphere our young people want to serve god because they know he's real oh mom and dad they're not perfect i saw them arguing but look a little closer you'll see god correct mom and dad you'll see god correct the preacher you'll see god take control of these things if we'll look a little closer but to catch the atmosphere and our young people realize that this life that's in them is a creative life and they want to express themselves they want to be who i was called to be you know the marine corps used to say be all you can be and i remember some cynical people years ago bought a billboard back in the midwest somewhere and it had part half of it was the marine corps be all the you can be and on the other side be the best cannon fodder you can be they were anti-war but you see as sons and daughters of god we are not cannon fodder for the devil when we get christ on the inside we have every right to take every redemptive promise of god and apply it to our life and move forward with confidence the devil's the one that wants to get you to use a little pitchfork religion we always talk about pitchfork religion being well okay there's somebody in this church this and that and we're like oh i think that belongs to them i think it belongs to them but you see god wants us to use a little pitchfork religion amen hallelujah lord just keep shoveling it in here keep throwing it in here lord because this is the very life that is giving us life hallelujah the very creative life amen hallelujah once again a reminder it's not us but it's him in us amen now what is this power that he's talking about in context here the definition many definitions for power but i love this one the best the ability to do or to act in a certain way now let's go right back and read that scripture again amen because i want you to to catch this this morning if i can but ye shall receive the ability [Music] come on saints to do and act in a certain way you can just give a bible my brother and sister i just come across the deal and i'm not faulting it i believe in giving out bibles um and and doing these things but see there's like you know we need you know a thousand bibles for a certain place what we need is the holy ghost to anoint that word because there's millions of people reading their bible and it's not changed them at all but there's life contained in the word of god that is life-changing and so as we'll look at this but ye shall receive power or the ability to do the word the ability to act in a certain way and my brother and sister you know one of the signs of a cult is conformity you know why that's why they want to call you a cult that's right because they look at you and see conformity but they think that conformity is coming through a man-made leadership that's coming down causing you to dress walk and talk a certain way but they've missed the leadership of the holy ghost that's the thing they have totally totally missed is the leadership of the holy ghost because we cannot be non-conformist and say that this word is important to us god expects us to live the word to align to the word to receive the revelation of this word and so in that realm my brother and sister the devil's always the one right stood up called jesus beals above a devil telling the religious world that this revealed word is of the devil it's almost ironic maybe even could go to the far those of you have warped humor to say that's humorous a devil so in the tradition of man that man relates to it yes sir a devil saying this word that is trying to change your life is going against our tradition and the people said whoa we have tradition and they rejected the cornerstone because their hearts were smitten in them and those who were not studied in the word of god were deluded they were drawn away they were deceived because they had no foundation in the word it's pretty funny how the devil can come right back use that same pattern millions of people have a bible and he's using the same exact pattern that he used with jesus once again and saying this is of the devil this is of the devil this is of the devil and the people by their tradition are looking at all they know look this is my grandfather just come across the deal in my readings the other day this is back in the midwest and uh these these people they were it was like a little uh oh i don't know how would you call a little bio of a farm family that's been farming in the midwest forever and ever and and this church i won't name the name of the church but this church my great-grandfather helped establish this church and every one of our family has always gone to this church praise the lord tradition had nothing to do with the preaching of the word in fact that particular farmer i thought it was funny because you get a read between the lines that particular farmer was actually the interim pastor of that church because the previous pastor had taught things that they disagreed with same denomination but things he disagreed with so they got rid of him and now this man just steps in because he's got to carry on the tradition and if you go against our tradition we got to go against you and that's exactly what happened in the days when jesus was on the earth and it's exactly what is happening in the day that we're living in you see my brother and sister what was absent and i don't say this judgmental but what was absent was the power because the power is there to give you the ability to do the word and act in a certain way which would be the way that the word would cause you to act the life that the word brought to you is what god wants you to live out amen so we've been given an ability to be sons and daughters of god can we say amen to that we've been given the ability to trust the word as unerring we've been given the ability to act in a certain way in other words to come and to actively seek the holy ghost in a life-changing experience you've been given that ability to lay a hold on that right to lay hold on eternal life you've been given that ability it is not something that the whole world has been given amen but you know we can have ability without having action and so if we have an ability that's been given to us and we don't use it for what it was meant for and now because i don't you know have any other example i i i would use myself in this case and quite a few years ago there was all kinds of activity going on at the county level concerning what they were going to do and allow to be done with farmland and i kind of got involved with that it had some impact on our life at that time and uh so i went down there and i was testifying as a farmer from our area there because at one point in time they had a grandus idea that all of that out there should just turn into a giant housing development and maybe if i'd have been smart and really saw i could be retired right now but i missed that part of it and one night after testifying in a hearing i come out and this lady walks up to me very nice lady and she introduces herself and she says paul i'm actually the canyon county republican chairman and we've been noting in these meetings how you're able to articulate and and to present an idea and get it across to the commission and uh we would like for you to join the republican party and we have a space that we believe paul that we could get you into a political office and you could make a difference and i could feel my head growing and after the next meeting once again this lady comes says i just want to tell you paul that no one tonight expressed that the way that you did with clarity and i felt my head growing and i got to praying and just as distinct as my voice is to you god's voice was to me this is not what i gave you this gift for i called the lady up i mean she went so far as to give me papers on how to sign up to line up with the party line to line up with these things to basically i agree with what what the republican party in kenyan county stands for and i will support this and i and i'm not interested and you know in their world they're just like you don't realize what you're turning down but little do they know that i do know when i'm turning down because you see god didn't put ability in us to embrace this world one of her arguments is you can make a difference and i said you're absolutely right by god's grace i'm going to make a difference by god's grace i'm going to take the ability that has been given to me to act in a certain way to be who i am but you see we can have ability without having action and then we'll just go with the brothers of just brother mason go to the very next one what it is that in my hand amen yes nope there you go um and the first thing you know he's talking my brother and sister in a slightly different subject but i believe you'll catch what i'm talking about and the first thing you know he happened to hear something come up the road trump trump trump trump here comes 600 armed men big old brass helmets on they're big old iron shoes and there's spears in their hand they're big swords hanging at their side coming up the road to take his crop away from him and i want to introduce right here again okay i'm not trying to change what the prophet said but i just want you to know this was again just like you and i have had victory we've had times where pray through we feel the power of god but shamgar had to face the enemy again and we can't say well praise the lord devil you can't touch me he will touch you your words of saying you can't mean nothing to him oh look at this and i can see little shamgar say oh my look at their here it comes again lord they did it last year i sweated i harvested i thrashed i put it in the grainery and i'm thinking i can take some of this to town and i can buy good clothes for my family i can buy some new things and the rest will save feed our livestock feed my family it's happening again he looked over at his poor little wife and there she was elbows of her dress out there's the little children look real skinny because they hadn't had nothing to eat the philistines took it away had took it away that's about like some of the christians tonight come on saints i'm going to speak direct to you today it's like some of the people in this church a puny thing to be called a believer a born-again christian amen not enough faith to deny if it was inc i don't mean to preach hard to you saints i just want you to know there's something better for us god's got something better for us he has given us now we know what the prophet of god taught he said that we don't really have power we have authority but my brother and sister i'm not trying to turn it because you could say well brother brown said hear power we're not here to get all scrappy about some little well you didn't say that quite right i run into people here and there if you quote a quote and don't literally give the pause for the comma but they feel like you've somehow violated it well i'm sorry my brother and sister life is more important than your comma the life is in the word not in your grammar i think that might be why some people struggle with the prophet so bad but it's right there but it don't fit their grammar they they need to restructure this they gotta you know no he didn't mean it that way he meant this i'm sorry this is what he said he didn't say that he said this even though you believe he meant that or should have said that i'm sorry this is how he put it he put it down at paul's level and to those of you are the more intellectual you'll just have to come down to my level to grasp it yeah yeah so he looks at this now that's about like some of the christians look tonight a puny looking thing to be called a believer a born-again christian amen not enough faith to dot an eye if it was inc that's right oh my don't let the devil come over and take the glory of god out of the church come on saints let somebody say amen to this today we are not going to give the devil the opportunity to take the glory of god out of this church you can get sophisticated and the prophet said this and the prophet said that and we're not going to do this and we're not going to do that well my brother and sister i say as it is that we are going to do what the holy ghost leads us to do and if we are there have you ever noticed now i'm not insulting my wife i just want to make the point she happens to just be in the crosshair now when i remember when jerry and i first got married we would sit down at the table just two of us no children we might be in a cafe a restaurant at home and i would just look down at my food and look up and she was finished eating she grew up in a house full of a lot of siblings if you wanted your share you dove in you got your share that's the way it is with christians some people are going to stop and think about this a while should i apply that quote to my life or not do you think the fact that brother branham said that 132 times that he meant it i'm going to think about this a while you look across the table pardon me no reference back to my my wife here but you look across the table and somebody else is over there and the others say i just don't like the way they eat they should eat like i eat and should study these quotes out for at least six months or until they forgot why they were studying them come on saints we got way too many of those people around come on as brother stephen berson from canada says if you are a believer of this message you should know what i'm talking about i shouldn't have to defend you know well if we took this heading off of here would you still say amen to this i hope so i hope so come on don't let the devil come over and take the glory of god out of the church send your pastor away and let him get all of these here dd's and come back and stand up and say a man like a dying calf come on come on saints what you need and and you know i almost didn't use this quote because it's like maybe maybe it'd be sound like i'm i'm promoting something but i'm telling you so just so you'll know in advance i went ahead and used this quote because lord i want to be that kind of pastor i want to be that kind of preacher i want to be that kind of brother not because i think i am but it's because that's what i want to be what you need is an old-fashioned backwards sky-blue sin killing religion of a preacher that will preach the truth and stand on what god said that that is the truth and liberate the people hallelujah amen this is not about a man promotion this is not about a man worship this is about you and i getting the pure word of god that takes us when we drift off the path and puts us back to the center it leads us when we come to the bridge out to not think that the message that god has given supernaturally to you has come to an end but in the bridge out to look and realize yes there it is down in the stream this bridge of ease of being a christian has been torn down but down here in the stream god provided a rock i hope you're with me he provided a rock and we can stretch you've done it in your youth amen we get older it's harder but you've done it in your youth look what's happening bridge out you're not for 48 years i i guess i just realized this isn't true after 48 years you should be so anchored to realize revelation revelation revelation revelation revelation and sometimes you have to give all you've got to get to the next one but lord help me if it's the truth i want to believe it and you make that leap of faith and you land on that rock of revelation and god confirms it in your life and then the people look over and say didn't you get the memo the bridge is out no i didn't no i didn't because i have a provided way that god gave me and it was revelation that he gave me in his word i'm not important i just took the leap of faith and i'll tell you saints because this is the truth sometimes in that leap of faith you're in the air and you're stretched out and you're looking at the rock and the closer you get to the rock you realize there's moss on the rock and the devil says this is the end of you but god comes down and supernaturally lets your foot land right between the moss and whatever would be there to stumble you amen reminds me of a friend of mine preached one time he said the problem we have in the stream of life is as people move from the rock of revelation to the rock of revelation they fell off the rock sounds terrible doesn't except for the fact if we'd all be honest we'd have to say we've fallen off the rock his point was when you've fallen off the rock now comes another decision are you going to go that way to the shore or that way to the shore well praise the lord you know we'd actually make really good people out here good people saints if we just all walked away and we just devoted ourselves to careers and raising our families good you'll meet them great people don't know if there's a god or not they got polite children well-ordered family you think we'll do okay we'll do okay but the scripture shows us there's a great chasm that separates heaven and hell there's no way to get across that one so remember when you fall off the rock you get back on the rock or you have to choose between which shore you're going for go to the one you were headed to in the beginning you know i i know a man i consider him a friend had a great you might say breach in his life a great struggle in his life and he come to a place he had a choice believe it or not a lot of people would said i could totally understand if he'd walked away but this brother bore his shame of this breach in his life bore the shame and come straight back to the cross because he said even though i failed in my flesh where could i go where could i go what could i do yes i failed i failed miserably but what could i do where could i go and he bore the shame of this breach in his life and he's pressing forward because he said i would rather bear the shame and stand before the lord repented than to run from myself amazing so we want some sin killing religion that will preach the truth and stand on what god said that is the truth and liberate the people amen i'm not rude i don't mean to be but brother it's time we brought or made black black and white white come on let's get that out of the message it's creeping in did you know that you just let those vines just go and you know it's amazing you know house there on the farm we're working on and there's rose bushes on the outside of the house and you go down in the basement and there's rose bushes on the inside of the house because given time they work their way in and so you look at this it's time saints it's grace tabernacle in a position we would lift a hand and say lord we want black to be black and white to be white we don't want some hybrid religion we don't want to gloss this over we want some sin killing preaching and sin killing preaching isn't to shame or insult or to beat down it is the liberty in christ jesus amen that brings us to this thing right now look i'm not rude i mean but brothers it's time we brought made black black white white yes sir you get god in your camp and you'll hear the shout again in the camp of the king when you get the thing fixed up i'll tell you as a preacher i'm not wanting to just hear shouting for shouting's sake but i want to hear a shout of victory all the way from our little ones to the oldest in ole miss i want to hear a shout in the camp that we can say my god is real my god is real i don't have a doubt of who it is that i serve hallelujah i'm telling you my brother and sister it's time sometimes you know we can we can get to a place you know we're so afraid we're so afraid around the message people are so afraid to just say well i feel weak i feel discouraged won't be long before they're gone where did that spirit come from didn't come from god in fact it said that we should actually share our burdens with one another now some of that maybe need to be age sensitive right not gonna come over and spill your heart about some very deep thing that would just blow some young person right out of the water and they'd be like what but at the same time we've become so proud can we say that word proud is that okay to say in a message church we become so proud that we're ready to go down in flames and we're not going to let a single soul know about it because what if they know about it what will they think of me okay let's just this is off the track but i just feel led to do this let's just diagnose that for a moment they know you're struggling they know you have doubts you have fears you feel worthless you've made mistake after mistake after mistake and what am i going to do if they know about it well praise the lord there's only two sides of that aisle there's going to be those that look of you and you know what have you ever worked with someone who waited until you put it all back together and right when you put the last bolt in they go [Laughter] told you so what are you going to do with this piece it goes on the inside behind this this this this and this and this i told you so hmm lock the door on the shop i don't need friends like that right or you tell them i made a mistake in my life and all of a sudden with this youth brothers all of a sudden there's a whole band of brothers wrapped around this man lord this is a sinner no this is my brother amen and we're gonna take on a musk ox anointing you know what i'm talking about hallelujah the enemies out there the enemy's not in here come on are you with me enemies not in here the enemies out there so we don't turn and face one another we turn and face out and say you know what devil this is my brother and i'm gonna stand on the word and maybe he's not anointed to take the word as we have just read those quotes maybe he's not in a position to speak from authority but we are and devil we will fight with you to the bitter end hallelujah oh hallelujah i could just go off and preach on that i even have a couple quotes that would go with that thought hallelujah see what look what happened we put our god-given ability to action now look we want to do this here uh in just a nice way because this is just part of a sermon ongoing uh now he promised of a coming church a coming kingdom now turn right over in acts 1 8 and remember he spoke also in matthew 16 18 upon this rock now look my brother and sister this promise of a coming church this was not for us to say oh none of those other ages had anything we and laodicea have it all no no no prophet himself says that i'm here to correct some of the air of ages gone by to remind you of the truth of ages gone by and to reveal the last revelation as it were and the ra last revelations not new gospel see that's where the critics i just read a deal the other day oh they think they got something new no i'm sorry don't have one thing new everything i believe is right here contained in this bible but not all of it's in order now i'll tell you i've offered a job to my granddaughter elia i've got collection through the years of abandoned message books people quit they do have enough respect not to throw them in a dumpster and they say here paul take the books i've got anointed and last a little while and i've just been putting all of this together and i have 65 64. you know you see what i'm saying and going on now the thing is is i consider myself a busy man except for when i'm too lazy to be busy but um you know i offered my granddaughter i i i'm gonna pay you sweetie to take these books out because there's duplicates and it's just a big mess and i want you to go through and sort this out for me now my brother and sister when we look at the ages god said i'm going to provide some men that are going to come they're going to sort this out and put it in order for you aaliyah is not going to start printing books she's going to set it in order the prophet didn't come and try to print a new bible he just said it in order and regardless of what critics might say saints just remember the prophet of god was here to set the word of god in order for our life so that we could follow that we could find the correct order of it and so he says here in matthew 16 upon this rock he would build his church and the gates of hell should not prevail against it we're going to get to that just a few minutes as we go on down to the other subject acts 1 8 but you sell you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem judea samaria and to the utmost parts of the world a coming kingdom of witnesses i like how brother branham puts that it's just very simplistic but it's very deep amen not a coming a witness of theologians or a coming you know time where we have to learn i have no problem with people learning other languages that's fine some are just very gifted but if we think we got to go learn hebrew before we can read our bible then we got the wrong anointing yeah oh and by the way all the hebrew historians are arguing about which sub dialect you know kind of like down the south have you ever drove up to a wendy's in the south yeah why are we wall what was that why we wanna uh i think the speaker's got a problem i i don't know what you're saying somebody else comes to the deal would you like to order i don't know what he said my brother and sister you take all these minds that have approached the gospel from theology and to the bride of christ it's won but he said my sheep hear my voice hallelujah we had a time like that we actually drove away it's a it's a lovely time and uh we drove away and pulled just up the street we're in happy valley tennessee and we wanted to make the wednesday night service and and so we're going to eat something really fast and drive straight to church and be there on time and and so we pulled up the street pulled over prayed started pulling food out and it's like nobody ordered a baconator where's our french fries who ordered a triple cheeseburger well imagine on the inside our perfect northwest no accent voice was wa and that's why when you witness to many people the devil tries to say you blew it i just heard one of you i wouldn't even mention who it was in the last i'm gonna i'm gonna stretch it out so you won't even wrack your brain on this in the last few months i heard one of you say to me well i witnessed the sky and i said this and said that i just really blew it did you you can't help it if what they heard was why we but if you ever have the opportunity to witness to one of gods they are just like now you said in the bible i've never read that before well let me show you they read it and they go oh my god but as long as you're talking to that other spirit it comes out while we wa anyway we had quite a laugh but i tell you we were all hungry enough like a good believer would be if he went to church first thing was we ought to take this back and make him fix it second thing was we'll be late for church if we make them fix this so i think i'll eat a baconator and i'll eat this and i'll eat a soggy fish sandwich and i'll eat some chicken toasted whatever but you see if you can't have the same language there's no matter we could have walked inside we might have had to stood on the counter and pointed at their board this one that you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses and unto me both in jerusalem judea samaria and the utmost parts of the world a coming kingdom of witnesses witnesses of what his resurrection you realize my brother and sister now look at this witnesses of his resurrection witnesses of his power witnesses of his being alive we're just speaking to you the other night what what is the vindication of this message the prophet's own words not my words the prophet's own words is he declared you are the vindication of this message he didn't say i am the vindication and so all the rest of you just live like a bunch of alley rats because it's already been proven to be true he turned that right around and said you're gonna vindicate that this word of god is true in this hour you're gonna be the one that lives the life and the gospel of christ in the day that we live in i say thank you lord for such a promotion hallelujah hallelujah witnesses of his resurrection witness of his power witness of his of being alive you're my witnesses acts 1 8. now you look at that my brother and sister and we also find oh where are we at here you're my witnesses okay five definite identifications now look at this let's go to the next one then we also find the ephesians the first chapter 22nd verse that uh you that's putting that down this is plenty of it to put down now just to nail it down to make sure that that you see it all right see brother brown's not just worried about how much he can preach he wants you to see it yes if you have to be labor you know i've taught this to the church i i say todd i've expressed it as an opinion of what i do and i'd hoped somehow it would grab some of you my brother and sister reading the bible in the year means nothing if you didn't get one thing out of your bible in that year oh praise the lord i read you know especially those ones that have you read three verses out of this and two verses here and four verses there you'll be like me and my message books well i believe it was i don't know where it was in the bible i read it why don't we just stop and let's just focus on one thing till we understand it till we get it come on yeah i could elaborate on that but it's times fleeting you see it all right 22nd verse of ephesians the first chapter has put all things under his feet that's christ and gave him to be the head over the things to the church that's us which is his body oh he's only talking theologically okay and the fullness of him that filleth all in all who set this church up jesus christ now i'm not promoting myself for defending myself saints don't misunderstand me but you see now the foundation of why paul doesn't like you to call this paul's church i go to paul haylett's church i'm sorry i don't know where you go then because paul haley didn't go to church jesus christ has got a church on midland boulevard paul haylett doesn't at all no bishop no group of men no pope no man-made powers at all but jesus christ spoke of it being his kingdom that was coming in power you know what this is that's me i'm going to tell you right now i'm coming in power sister jerry and i was just talking just casually husband wife believer brother sister however you want to look at it you know and we're talking about maturity and i'm telling you what we say thank you lord we are coming in maturity until we are not very mature and then we're suddenly like oh yes i didn't have a get out of jail i didn't have an exemption card and there's things about me that are not very mature shocking isn't it don't feel condemned lift a hand up and say thank you lord you showed me a portion of my life that i've been so focused over here i had a friend i hope you don't mind me sharing this this kind of silly comment i had a friend in school he was actually quite good as an artist and he liked to draw these deals and he had all these quirky things and so he would have the cartoon of the man working out only his right arm and he would draw this cartoon and it would show this guy screen skinny skinny old body and over here was this shoulder that bulged out in a huge bicep and ripple of muscles but the rest of him was this little wimpy thing and then he would draw the man who only worked at his left arm and guy that only worked out from the waist up and all these comics were funny little pencil legs you know in this big huge upper body like whoa or the guy who only worked out his legs and his upper body was like sunken chest and pencil arms and i remember that later as i become a minister just as i'm recounting it to you you see it's not about well praise the lord i got into this part of the word and now i can tell you every comma and whatever blah blah blah that the prophet said about this right here and they got all these skinny little legs intellectually worked out great big head great big ears and eyes nose nothing else god wants a balanced message god wants us to say lord what is it but you see he's doing that when he roots up in us something that we go oh my that response that behavior wasn't very mature of course there's always some husbands and wives and friends that'd be like told you so forget about them listen to god amen he's working on you saints he's building you into what he wants you to be amen now let me get back on track where was i i've got lost no no bishop no group of men no pope no man-made powers at all but jesus spoke of it being his kingdom that was coming in power some stands here 16th chapter of matthew verily i say unto you some stands here shall not see death until we see the kingdom of god coming in power you know how we've always interpreted that there are some they're going to be alive they're not going to see death until they see the coming of the lord in power that's the way it's interpreted i want to throw a curveball at you some of you called the bride are not going to see death until god has opened up the power of his word and the kingdom of god is going to come into you in power satan can't take you until all the revelation of jesus christ has been manifested in you as a son or daughter of god so don't worry about oh i'm afraid i might die here or what would happen here whatever as sons and daughters of god you will be filled with the fullness of the gospel of jesus christ before he will take you home he's not going to get you up to heaven and give you a personal tutor to get you ready to go on in you are going to be filled with the word right here amen now i'm not trying to pervert the word so nobody misunderstand that but you look at this my brother and sister have confidence that the kingdom of god is going to come to maturity in you oh i need more patience pray for patience i can't bring myself to pray for patience then just hold on god will give you patience coming just a few days after that he was crucified and the holy ghost fell some stands here shall not see death until they see the kingdom of god amen now look at this my brother and sister how beautiful this is will thou restore the kingdom at this time the jews ask him and he said it's not for you to know the time or the season that the father has put in his own mind but you shall receive power you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you you shall receive power after you are made a bishop after you are made a preacher after you're made a pope after you're made a priest you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you oh i want to be able to weld the power of almighty god i don't want to just walk through this life being buffeted to the right and to the left but here is a secret my brother and sister we got to die to ourselves i got up early this morning and i'm sitting in the office in there a little tired in the body and i'm just sitting there and i was just thinking about these things and i thought oh lord look lord i don't want to go through this life right here and find out i missed an opportunity here and i missed an opportunity here and i missed an opportunity here and there was a time that i by dying to myself and then the lord spoke to me and said it's really hard it's really hard paul to die to yourself half-hearted commitment will not bring death to self amen come on now i don't want this to be depressing actually it has a good ending it's a man one time in san francisco tried to commit suicide with a gun he didn't have the courage to pull the trigger he's going to poison himself but he had read about how painful that was so he poured it down the drain and he done all of these things tried to play chicken on the freeway got pulled over cop thought he was drunk walks out in the middle of the golden gate bridge and he says now will be the time that i'll end my life and there'll be not one thing i can do to turn it around and he stood like a tourist looking over the rail and when there was no cars close to him he climbed over the rail and just pushed off now you catch something from this he says the minute he pushed off he had regrets kind of tells you a little of the story doesn't it you're going to find this amazing there's a man getting the deck of a freighter large ship ready to go into the harbor to unload and he was the chief you might say of all the workers on the boat and he looks out and he sees this pile of rags laying on the deck of the ship and he thought which one of my lazy guys left this and he goes over there to pick it up and here the pile of rags is moaning they call they get medical help for him you know if god doesn't want it to happen it can't happen this was a large ship with a huge crane mounted on it and he fell from the bridge and he hit the cable and he went sliding down the cable and he shot off the end of the cable and he bounced off of some deal and ricocheted off of this and come to rest on the deck and only had a couple broken bones in the hospital when he got healthy they had him under suicide watch one day he told the doctor he said after that kind of experience you don't have to worry about me trying again you see god is in control god is in control sense amen but we want to have the power right here without having to go through that kind of experience to realize life is precious amen you shall receive power if the holy ghost has come upon you that's the witness that god was looking for a witness after amen come on if i can drive this home a witness after the holy ghost has come upon them amen not a witness that i'm a bishop not a witness that i'm a pastor but a witness of what of the resurrected king that's the true church of the living god all right hallelujah amen we're preaching today saints to you and this thought i never really spoke on it but the recognition and the action of the true church amen this church is going to recognize the word of god she's going to see what god has chose to do in her amen so it's there that we want to come to this place and can i have just a couple more minutes amen it's a time that we come to the place to real right we're not a witness of a church we're not witness of a pastor i go to brother so-and-so's church i've never heard of him in their mind you must be living under a rock in my mind god brought me the message amen and he used great men to bring the message to me i know this is going to be a little graphic some of you might not like my example but you didn't see rebecca jump off a camel and run over to the camel caretaker oh my thank you go over here to the cook thank you go over here to this one thank you go over here oh i think i've got far enough on that no sir she had one love she knew all of them had helped her get here but this was the reason he's the reason he's the one of why i have traveled through the desert why have been dirty and sweaty and why we have been concerned about the bandits with false message he's the one amen hallelujah hallelujah i hope that wasn't too graphic forgive me hallelujah what is the church the mystic body of christ who set it up the lord jesus himself it wasn't set up at rome neither was it set up in england by john wesley and it was set up by calvin or in america the baptist by john smith neither was it set up in california by the pentecostals it was set up by jesus christ the king of the messianic kingdom that's who it was set up by he is the king he wants to be king he wants to rule us oh now look at this hang on put your seat belt on amen those he read ahead not he naughty he wants to be king he wants to rule us he wants to be lord people let him let him in say i'll let him be savior but they won't let him be lord lord means ownership i believe the message are you owned by the one who wrote it ownership rulership come into my heart lord save me from hell but don't tell me what to do my that's the attitude of the people that's rough saints that's rough but it's truth amen lord help us to die to ourself amen i believe it's the reason the lord just spoke to my heart this morning it's one thing to say i believe that it is hard to die to self and let's not act like the preacher must have it together and we're the only one that struggles with this every one of us that is living breathing human beings has to struggle to die to ourself that's why we should not turn in and cannibalize our own but we should stand and say i don't care what happened in your life we're going to turn like the musk ox and we're gonna face the devil and tell them devil you're gonna have to go through this whole church if you want my brother or you want my sister you're gonna have to go through the whole church because you know that old phrase divide and conquer didn't just come from nowhere no that's that's the devil he said that was such a good idea i'll just let the whole world share that one but thank the lord that's not our attitude is it okay i want to close sister will you come and been musicians now brother brown says right here and i think it's only fair you know i i have brothers tell me that you're true too transparent paul i'm working on hiding things from you i'm i'm kind of struggling with that but i'll work on i'll get better hiding things from you but for the moment being transparent this is a quote my wife sent to me it wasn't even my own studies and i pruned it down because i knew it was right here at the end and i knew that i would have preached too long but i want you to catch this right here christ is the mystery of god revealed i think the title says it all who we you know listen to it read it but look just in the title it says it all now look at this see what i mean he has begun to give life into his body no longer religion he's not given religion to his body he's not given a theology or a doctorate or oh my i was with so and so i knew so and so i've traveled with so-and-so okay that's good some of that's really neat but he's begin to give life into his body why why the one he's redeemed it's not how much of the message we can quote it's not how big our church is [Music] it's not how however you want to measure it this is what he's doing to his redeemed he's pouring life into her the mediatorial work is done amen people are like you can't believe this or that because if you believe this or that that means christ off the mercy seat they forgot to go and study it it's and it's sad because we live in a day i remember an old message preacher good good old brother he's passed on to the to his reward he looked me in the face one day and he says paul you guys are spoiled okay he said when i started preaching this message he said i had every message book i could get ahold of and then i had almost an equal amount of books that were references where to find it in those books i want to know about baptism he said i had under b under baptism every uh this message right here this page this one this page just he says now you guys just go [Music] and read it he said you're not better off than we were [Music] you know why without one drop of anointing one drop of the supernatural we can find a quote condemning you and speaking good of me building you up and putting them down but it's the same holy ghost saints same holy ghost and i'm going to explain the whole thing to you that you'll have a thought on your mind and i'll be thinking i ought to look that up ought to look that up and sit down in a chair in the family room and open a message and it opens up on the binder the center you know and there's the very quote i wanted to look up no tell me if that's not the lord oh it was how they made the book no it was the lord because the lord cares about you and i amen now look at this the mediatorial work is done he's bringing life his life to body not to a body and you could even take it as not to the body because it's individual the body here is body in a vindication remember what i preached to you the other day god's using you vindicate this word in a vindication for the rapture hallelujah we are going to vindicate this work this word this work until we walk right into a rapture because this life matches the life that was poured into this life oh isn't that make you happy makes my heart so happy we didn't get the word poured into us to come to another conclusion we didn't get the word porn in us to come up with another idea of what it is to believe the message to live the message to do the message out will all come how brother paul how's the rapture going to take place i don't know but i'm going to be there hallelujah that's the one thing i know as god has put in my heart i'm going to be part of that rapture amen how does this work brother paul i don't know i know a brother my brother and sister just scares me no scares that's not the right part i know a brother i love very much and it's so amazing he will pray and god will answer those prayers and it is such a clockwork that it happens and then you ask the brother brother i've heard it and ask you this brother brother how did you know i've stood in a prayer line with him and people say i i told myself i would never confess this and then they turn right in the prayer line to their own wife so i'm faithful to you hit it for 20 years sent through supernatural meetings but this brother stand there and say i bind every spirit for the deliverance of the saints and you get to witness a spirit that was bound so this brother could then express this sin to his wife and then see that brother turn i mean this just makes my hair stand up i'm telling you i was standing there that night and that service i'm just like wow and turn and bind her you in the name of jesus christ will forgive him well he didn't have any right except for it wasn't his voice it was speaking to her [Music] god's stirring the heart so much they have a breakdown revival right there in the center of a church and not one person i can say by the grace of god in that church went oh my that's why they've been having marital problems for 20 years i knew there had to be something wrong now sir a whole church erupted in prayer crying out to the lord the power of god you ask that brother how it happens he says i don't know i just tried to pray a lot [Music] yeah you want something to happen pray a lot hallelujah amen let's just stand sing that little song if you don't mind saints i don't even know if i made sense this morning but i'm just going to stand on this is what the lord laid on my heart amen hallelujah i'd like to sing that song he's my lord amen i don't want him to just be my savior i want him to be able to say yep i own this guy this guy is my property i paid for him with my own precious blood hallelujah and i'm not the least bit ashamed the fact that i pray i saved his saved his o wretched hide hallelujah hallelujah he's my lord he has risen from the dead and he is my lord hallelujah he is lord okay [Music] he has risen just claiming this today saints just let the lord know that you're just surrendering completely you're giving yourself over to every need we don't even want to take ourselves back lord we just give ourselves every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord oh he's my lord he's my lord he has risen from the dead and he's my lord [Music] d is [Music] my [Music] the first verse [Music] thou art exalted far above all god for though [Music] thou art exalted far away [Music] oh [Music] you love the lord today hallelujah aren't you glad hallelujah let's just sing as we close my redeemer is faithful and true hallelujah it's wonderful my brother and sister just to realize god knew that stop that rock you would stumble over he knew that little thing that would be a thorn in your flesh we say well if the lord loved me he would have removed that thorn he will he will right after he's brought you into the nature and the character that stalwart faithful determined not stubborn determined believer and then you're to find one day that thorn is gone and then let's be faithful to give him praise and say thank you lord you delivered me from thus and thus i wouldn't raise my hand because i wouldn't want to have you raise your hand it wouldn't want to embarrass anybody but i can assure you there's sons of god here today that been delivered from alcohol been delivered from the cigarette been delivered from the pornography been delivered from lying and delivered from all kinds of angry spirits [Music] just make sure you say thank you lord let him know how much you appreciate them because you see one by one he's removing those sins that so easily beset us and i can say thank you lord thank you lord your grace your mercy hallelujah [Music] as i look back [Music] this [Music] me morning and if there's one thing i've learned in this life my redeemer is faithful and true my redeemer is faithful land lord we thank you today lord jesus everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and true my heart rejoices when i read the promise there is a place that i'm preparing for you and if there's one thing i've learned in this life my redeemer is faithful and true oh my redeemer is faithful and true everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies are new redeemer is faithful and true one more song in the morning when i rise hallelujah just on my heart hallelujah that's where it all starts saints amen oh god bless you we love you today just pray the lord just deal with your heart still kindly strengthen us [Music] hey the only way you can die [Music] is just to give up only time only thing in your life god wants you only time he wants you to just give up because when you die to yourself you're going to die to everything that satan had hung on you amen you die to yourself right i want to just remind you see it struck me it struck me so poignant the other night wednesday when i was sharing see see paul and silas didn't rebuke that little girl he didn't go out there and say you know what you got an evil spirit on you and you're this and you're that and you need to go home back to mommy and that no sir he looked right over what the real issue was and he says hey spirit i bind you [Music] leave even the men that were responsible didn't get rebuked because you see they were intertwined with that spirit so paul was speaking to the spirit on the little girl he spoke to the spirit it was on those men did you hear the little girl get angry no but those men sure did they knew what they were doing the little girl was innocent paul set her free but you notice in their anger they took him to the magistrate they could have been set free also but they chose to be angry at the word oh lord help us help us [Music] in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise give me jesus give me jesus give me [Music] jesus you can have all this world but give me and when i am alone oh when i am alone when i am alone give me jesus [Music] as you can have all this world but give me jesus and when i am afraid when i am afraid when i am afraid give me jesus give me jesus us give me jesus you can have all this world but give me jesus [Music] and when i am in prayer oh when i am impressed when i am in prayer give me jesus give me jesus his eyes you can have all this world but give me jesus bless you saints you're dismissed we forgot just pray for the nash children little ones are sick and whatnot so we forgot to list that god bless each and every one of you need a touch from the lord just remember he hears your prayers amen god bless you [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
