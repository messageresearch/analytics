[31:21] father lord as we come before you this
[31:23] morning lord be
[31:24] we are unworthy lord but father who is

[31:30] that you would speak to our hearts this
[31:31] morning
[31:32] lord that you would take your word lord
[31:34] jesus the living breathing word of god
[31:36] though it is pinned upon pages and bound
[31:38] in leather father it is still alive lord
[31:40] jesus because it's not the form it takes
[31:43] on the page but it's the life it brings
[31:45] within our hearts lord jesus and
[31:47] father we're so grateful lord for it
[31:50] we're so grateful to know you lord
[31:52] grateful is such a little word lord
[31:54] compared to what you've done for us
[31:56] father
[31:57] lord just speak to us this morning may
[31:59] your presence be felt by each heart hear
[32:01] lord jesus may your word just touch us
[32:03] we ask
[32:03] you in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[32:07] praise the lord may lord bless you to
[32:08] the reading of his word you may be
[32:10] seated this morning
[32:13] yeah so we we uh
[32:17] heard wednesday night uh there in the
[32:20] service
[32:21] and our pastor touched upon boaz and
[32:24] ruth
[32:25] and i begin to think about boaz and how
[32:28] he was the son
[32:29] of rehab i think that he even mentioned
[32:32] whether paul even even might have
[32:34] mentioned that and begin to think about
[32:36] that and i thought you know
[32:41] there's others similar with a similar
[32:44] story
[32:44] and so my title this morning um
[32:48] is predestinated sons of redemption
[32:51] and my subtitle is called by name
[32:54] boaz was a son of redemption
[32:57] amen so before we get into it we're just
[33:00] going to read a couple of quotes here
[33:01] from brother branham
[33:03] and the message the breach between the
[33:05] seven church ages and the seven seals
[33:09] it's the same message for these few
[33:11] quotes here so
[33:12] now it's wrote mysterious because no man
[33:15] nowhere knows it
[33:16] god alone jesus christ see now but
[33:19] it is a book a mysterious book it's the
[33:22] book of redemption
[33:24] we'll get into that in a little while
[33:26] and now we know that this book of
[33:27] redemption will not be thoroughly
[33:30] understood it's probe that through six
[33:33] church ages but at the end when the
[33:34] seventh angel begins to sound his
[33:36] mystery he winds up all
[33:38] of the loose ends that these fellows
[33:39] probed at and the mystery
[33:42] com mysteries comes down from god as the
[33:44] word of god and reveals the entire
[33:46] revelation of god
[33:48] amen then the godhead and everything
[33:50] else is settled all the mysteries
[33:52] serpent seed and
[33:53] whatever more is to be revealed so they
[33:55] couldn't figure it out
[33:56] in the first six church ages they
[33:58] couldn't because it wasn't opened yet
[34:01] john saw but the angel said seal it up
[34:04] he goes on to say he says now you see
[34:05] i'm just not making that
[34:07] up that's right maybe somebody in the
[34:10] congregation thought that when he said
[34:11] that
[34:12] it's thus saith the lord i'll read it to
[34:14] you out of the book the sounding of the
[34:16] seventh angel's message the mystery of
[34:18] god should be finished that's been
[34:20] declared by his holy prophets
[34:22] that's the prophets who has wrote the
[34:24] word
[34:26] at the sounding of the seventh church
[34:28] age the last church age all the loose
[34:30] sins that through these church ages has
[34:32] been probed at will be wound up together
[34:34] and when the seals are broke and the
[34:36] mystery is
[34:37] revealed down comes the angel the
[34:39] messenger of christ
[34:41] setting his foot upon the land and upon
[34:44] the sea
[34:45] with the rainbow over his head now
[34:46] remember this now this is where many
[34:49] people fall off right
[34:50] now remember the seventh angel is on
[34:52] earth at the time of this coming
[34:55] praise god how could you marry him
[34:57] unless he came
[34:59] just as john was giving his message the
[35:01] same time that
[35:02] the that messiah came in the days john
[35:04] knew he would see him
[35:06] because he was going to introduce him
[35:10] amen catch that this morning again in
[35:13] the same message now we see that this
[35:15] seventh seal book now
[35:16] is the mystery of redemption it's a book
[35:19] of redemption from god
[35:22] again later on but with the divine
[35:24] promise that this book of redemption
[35:26] will be perfectly opened
[35:27] by the lamb and the seals thereof will
[35:30] be loosed by the lamb in the last days
[35:33] in which we're living now
[35:35] it's not made known until the lamb takes
[35:37] the book and breaks the seals because
[35:39] remember the book was being holded
[35:41] in the hands of him that sat upon the
[35:43] throne and the lamb comes to him that
[35:46] sits upon the throne and takes the book
[35:48] out of his right hand
[35:49] takes the book oh that's deep we'll try
[35:51] to solve it out if we can
[35:53] by the help of the holy spirit now we're
[35:55] depending on him and we will see later
[35:58] it is at the end time when time has run
[35:59] out but the mystery later on but the
[36:02] mystery of the whole book
[36:04] is in them seals from genesis to
[36:06] revelation
[36:07] the complete plan of redemption is
[36:09] revealed in these seven seals
[36:12] oh it's an important time if you study
[36:14] it out even more
[36:15] the book the book of redemption was
[36:18] sealed
[36:18] with seven seals so um redemption
[36:23] the cross is just a portion of their
[36:26] story of redemption
[36:27] the secular or sorry not the secular
[36:30] world the denominational world
[36:32] puts
[36:35] they tell the story of the cross and
[36:37] that's where they stop
[36:38] when it comes to redemption that's when
[36:40] you say redemption story to someone
[36:42] that's what they think of the life of
[36:44] christ when he was here on earth and his
[36:46] death and resurrection not discrediting
[36:48] that at all
[36:49] that is a portion of the story the bride
[36:52] needed redemption so
[36:54] christ could marry her the cross just
[36:57] opened the door the cross opened the
[36:59] door
[37:01] without redemption we can have no part
[37:03] with him
[37:05] but he really wanted us to have
[37:08] fellowship with him
[37:09] so he redeemed us i was sitting in my
[37:11] office yesterday studying and
[37:13] you know sometimes i i will uh strip
[37:16] away everything and just think about
[37:18] something and with no preconceived or no
[37:21] previous
[37:21] understanding and i and i was sitting
[37:24] there and i was contemplating and
[37:26] and meditating about why redemption is
[37:30] so important
[37:31] and why why is it the is it is it a
[37:34] mystery
[37:34] why is it a book of redemption that
[37:36] needed to be revealed and what was
[37:38] what was this was i missing something
[37:41] and the lord just began to deal with my
[37:43] heart and i realized that
[37:45] the book of redemption amen lord help me
[37:48] this morning
[37:50] christ cannot defy his laws
[37:54] we'll read the quote same message
[37:57] paragraph 166 but
[37:59] john wept here is what i think he went
[38:02] for because if no one was
[38:04] worthy and could open this book of
[38:05] redemption the whole
[38:07] creation was lost here is the book here
[38:11] is the title deed and it will be offered
[38:13] to the kinsmen redeemer that can meet
[38:15] the qualifications
[38:17] so before before if you will now all
[38:20] things are preordained and set in order
[38:22] before time began but if you will
[38:24] um before christ was ten to take the
[38:27] book a law was set
[38:29] a kinsman redeemer was the only one who
[38:31] could do it
[38:33] now christ in his in in his
[38:36] infinite wisdom knew he was that
[38:39] sacrifice
[38:40] but the law was set in place had to be a
[38:43] kinsmen redeemer
[38:45] and so the story of redemption is christ
[38:48] it's about you but it's about christ and
[38:51] this is what just
[38:52] broke me down is i realized it was about
[38:55] him he wanted you so bad his law said
[39:00] his law said no fellowship at all his
[39:04] law
[39:04] it was broken in the fall of the guard
[39:05] needed it was broken there was no
[39:07] fellowship
[39:08] but he needed you he wanted to be with
[39:11] you
[39:12] so much that he said in play in in
[39:15] in plan the plan of redemption and the
[39:18] only way
[39:19] you can come into fellowship with christ
[39:22] is
[39:22] through redemption the only way you can
[39:25] be redeemed is if you catch a revelation
[39:27] of christ to you
[39:29] amen that is why that is why it is the
[39:32] book of redemption that was sealed
[39:34] so you can't even be a part of christ
[39:37] unless you have revelation of redemption
[39:39] amen
[39:40] because that's christ he goes on to say
[39:43] here is the book here is a title deed
[39:44] and it will be offered to the kinsmen
[39:46] redeemer that can meet the
[39:47] qualifications
[39:49] i underline this here that's god's own
[39:52] law
[39:53] and he can't defile his law get defile
[39:56] defy his law rather so he meant to say
[39:58] defy his law god required a kinsman
[40:01] redeemer who was worthy who was able to
[40:03] do it who had the substance
[40:06] to do it god's law required a kinsmen
[40:09] redeemer to take the book
[40:11] taking the book saying to god is what
[40:14] redeemed you
[40:16] revealing that book is what gave you a
[40:18] revelation of
[40:19] redemption to redeem you so unless the
[40:23] seven seal book of redemption was open
[40:25] all creation would be lost christ had to
[40:29] take the book
[40:30] amen he had to take it he had to reveal
[40:32] himself
[40:33] to you and i am and for us to be in
[40:37] fellowship with him because the purpose
[40:38] of redemption was so that he could marry
[40:40] you
[40:41] amen amen if you want to turn with me to
[40:44] genesis chapter 38
[40:46] so we read in the beginning isaiah and
[40:49] we read the
[40:51] matthew chapter 1 about the lineages of
[40:53] christ and we mentioned a few people
[40:55] there we didn't read the entire thing
[40:57] but we mentioned a few important people
[40:58] that we're going to
[41:00] my god's grace look at today genesis
[41:03] chapter 38 remember our title is the
[41:05] sun's
[41:06] predestinated sons of redemption
[41:10] or just the sons of prevention uh
[41:13] redemption excuse me tripping over my
[41:15] tongue
[41:16] genesis chapter 38 verse 6 if you
[41:20] verses here to read but bear with me and
[41:22] judah took a wife from
[41:24] her his firstborn
[41:28] whose name was tamar so same person we
[41:30] read in the genealogy
[41:32] his firstborn son he gives the wife his
[41:35] wife
[41:36] this girl tamar and ur judah's
[41:39] firstborn was wicked in the sight of the
[41:40] lord and the lord slew him
[41:42] and judah said unto onan the next down
[41:45] the line go in unto thy brother's wife
[41:46] and marry her and raise up seed to thy
[41:48] brother and onan knew that the seed
[41:50] should not be his
[41:51] and it came to pass that he went in unto
[41:53] his brother's wife and then
[41:54] that he spilled it on the ground lest
[41:56] that he should give seed to his brother
[41:58] and the thing which he did displease the
[42:00] lord wherefore he slew
[42:02] him also amen there was somebody else
[42:04] who couldn't
[42:05] take on the redeeming of our inheritance
[42:07] lest that mourn his
[42:10] he wasn't willing to take to make the
[42:12] sacrifice
[42:14] and the thing which he did displease the
[42:15] lord wherefore he slew him also
[42:18] then said judah to tamar his
[42:19] daughter-in-law remain a widow at thy
[42:21] father's house
[42:22] tell sheila be my son be groaned for he
[42:25] said
[42:25] lest per adventure he died also as his
[42:28] brethren did
[42:30] so out of fear judah withholds
[42:33] tamar's inheritance and tamar went and
[42:36] dwelt in her father's house
[42:39] and in the process of time the daughter
[42:41] of yeshua
[42:42] judah's wife died and judah was
[42:44] comforted and went
[42:45] up unto his sheep shearers to timnath he
[42:48] had his friend hira the adulamay
[42:51] and it was told tamar saying behold thy
[42:52] father-in-law goeth up to tim that to
[42:55] shear his sheep
[42:56] and she put her widow's garments off
[42:58] from her and covered her with a veil and
[43:00] wrapped herself and sat in an open place
[43:02] which is by the way of timnath for she
[43:04] shot she saw that sheila was grown
[43:07] and she was not given unto him to wife
[43:10] when judah saw her he thought her to be
[43:12] a harlot because she had covered her
[43:14] face
[43:15] and he turned unto her by the way and
[43:17] said go to i pray thee let me come
[43:19] in unto thee for he knew not that she
[43:21] was his daughter-in-law and she said
[43:22] what will thou give me that thou mayest
[43:24] come in unto me
[43:26] and he said i will send thee a kid from
[43:27] the flock and she said look thou give me
[43:29] a pledge till thou s
[43:30] thou send it so he gives her
[43:34] his signet his bracelets and his staff
[43:38] his identification and uh
[43:41] she takes those things and she goes away
[43:43] and she goes
[43:45] puts her garments of widowhood back on
[43:46] and goes home
[43:48] and then three months later
[43:51] uh so then and then then uh judah sent
[43:54] the
[43:55] sheep back she wasn't there couldn't
[43:57] find her verse 24.
[43:59] and it came to pass about three months
[44:00] after that it was told judah saying
[44:02] tamar thy daughter-in-law had played the
[44:04] harlot
[44:04] and also behold she is with child by
[44:06] whoredom and judah said bring her forth
[44:08] and let her be burnt when she was
[44:11] brought forth she sent to her
[44:13] father-in-law saying by the man who's
[44:14] these are i am with child and she said
[44:16] dessert and i pray thee whose
[44:17] are these the signet and bracelets and
[44:20] staff
[44:21] and judah acknowledged them and said she
[44:23] had been more righteous than i because
[44:25] of that i gave her not to sheila
[44:26] my son and he knew her again no more
[44:30] in other words he withheld her
[44:31] inheritance but she by
[44:34] took an act of faith took a risk to
[44:37] preserve that inheritance
[44:40] and it came to pass in the time of her
[44:42] trail that behold twins
[44:43] were in her womb and it came to pass
[44:45] when she derailed that the one put
[44:47] out his hand and the midwest took and
[44:49] bound upon his hand a scarlet thread
[44:51] saying this came out first and it came
[44:53] to pass as he drew back his hand that
[44:55] behold his brother came out
[44:57] and she said thou how hast thou broken
[45:00] forth
[45:00] this breach be upon thee therefore his
[45:02] name was called pharas
[45:04] which is breach afterward came out his
[45:06] brother that he
[45:07] had the scarlet thread upon his hand his
[45:08] name was zara
[45:10] so contrary to the way things should be
[45:14] the lineage continued
[45:15] with pharez not zara zara was considered
[45:19] the firstborn
[45:20] but just as joseph he crossed his
[45:24] ear jacob israel crossed his hands and
[45:27] blessed
[45:28] amen the younger of the twins manasseh
[45:32] or ephraim i can't remember which one
[45:34] and so the same thing happens here and
[45:36] and uh
[45:37] we could take it fairest was a type of
[45:40] christ who
[45:42] did took the breach amen he breached the
[45:45] gap
[45:46] for us amen but tamar she she took a
[45:49] risk to preserve her inheritance
[45:52] because judah was bound by the law to
[45:54] give her his next son but he didn't
[45:57] he held it back and the line had to
[45:59] continue through judah
[46:01] what she did whether or not we leave
[46:03] that god to judge how she did it but god
[46:06] needed that line to continue through
[46:08] judah and so she was
[46:10] sentenced to be burnt but because of the
[46:13] seed she carried because of what she
[46:17] identified as amen she was redeemed
[46:20] and she was allowed to bring forth her
[46:22] children and through that god continued
[46:24] the lineage of christ
[46:26] so so pharas excuse me
[46:30] carried on the line a son of redemption
[46:33] an act of faith on tamar's part
[46:36] to preserve redemption amen and so now
[46:40] we see that that sort of
[46:42] of of these and you can look and you can
[46:44] see how close and maybe if
[46:46] these people these men in the lineage
[46:48] knew their great great grandfather or so
[46:51] on and so forth but this
[46:52] is the story carried down through these
[46:54] generations
[46:56] the sons of redemption and so we come to
[46:58] a place in scripture where
[47:01] the israelites have have made an exodus
[47:04] from egypt they've been in the desert
[47:06] and then they wandered the desert for 40
[47:08] years they uh refused
[47:10] to act upon faith and uh
[47:14] claimed their inheritance now there was
[47:15] a man named caleb
[47:17] and caleb amen is people
[47:21] grow up and and and the way they are
[47:24] who they are says a lot about how they
[47:26] were raised and the family they came
[47:27] from and here we have caleb
[47:29] standing firmly upon his promise
[47:33] and his desire to go over and take the
[47:36] land
[47:37] and um he had a brother named um
[47:41] well his name flips my mind now but
[47:44] praise the lord but he had a brother and
[47:46] through his brother
[47:47] we have the general solomon came from
[47:51] so um praise the lord so here we have
[47:55] the israelites at the river
[47:56] jordan now again there now they've come
[47:59] under the ministry of joshua and they
[48:00] have the
[48:01] opportunity to go over and take their
[48:04] promise
[48:04] amen take what their inheritance amen to
[48:08] redeem their inheritance and so in
[48:10] in joshua chapter two uh we'll we'll go
[48:12] over there
[48:13] real quickly here um praise the lord
[48:17] joshua chapter two
[48:31] and so joshua the first thing he does is
[48:33] he sends out these two spies
[48:36] he says hey we're going to cross over
[48:37] jordan i want you to go
[48:39] give me a description now perhaps within
[48:43] these uh
[48:44] within these spies was the remembrance
[48:46] that joshua
[48:48] takes the inheritance very seriously
[48:51] so they didn't want to come back with oh
[48:53] the walls are too big
[48:56] amen and joshua the son of none sent out
[49:00] of shedding two men to spy secretly
[49:03] saying go view the land even jericho
[49:06] and they went and came into a harlot's
[49:08] house named rahab and lodged there
[49:11] and it was told the king of jericho
[49:12] saying behold there came men
[49:14] in hither tonight of the children of
[49:16] israel to search
[49:17] out the country so
[49:22] and the woman took the two men and hid
[49:24] them and said thus there came men unto
[49:25] me but i wish not once they were
[49:27] and they came to pass about the time of
[49:29] the shedding of the gate when it was
[49:30] dark that the men went out whether the
[49:32] men
[49:32] went i won't not pursue after them
[49:36] quickly for ye shall overtake them
[49:39] so she hid them in her house and then
[49:42] she begins to testify
[49:44] that she says in verse 9 i know that the
[49:47] lord hath given you the land
[49:50] amen faith already speaking in faith
[49:53] living in sin a harlot but she receives
[49:56] these messengers and she begins to speak
[49:57] in
[49:58] faith look i know that you
[50:01] that the lord has given you the land i
[50:03] know the inheritance belongs to you
[50:06] now she steps out in faith a gentile
[50:10] and says i want to lay claim to the same
[50:14] inheritance given to you
[50:16] what was anointing her to speak those
[50:19] words
[50:20] the very fact that god had set in motion
[50:22] before time began rahab
[50:25] you belong in my lineage rahab i
[50:28] need you to carry the seed to bring
[50:32] forth the promised son
[50:33] does it matter that you're a gentile
[50:35] doesn't matter that you're a heathen
[50:36] that's your
[50:37] harlot it doesn't matter what your
[50:38] family or your parents i'm
[50:40] giving you the opportunity to lay claim
[50:42] to an inheritance
[50:44] that shouldn't be yours
[50:47] but before the foundation of the world
[50:49] god said rahab this is yours so
[50:51] faith moves within her heart a deep
[50:55] calling to the deep she had something
[50:57] within her to respond
[50:59] to that inheritance so she speaks out in
[51:03] faith and she begins to testify doesn't
[51:05] our lord
[51:06] love to hear us testify about his
[51:09] goodness
[51:09] even before it's come to pass and she
[51:12] says your terror has fallen upon us all
[51:14] the inhabitants of the land
[51:15] faint because of you for we have heard
[51:18] how the lord
[51:19] dried up the red sea how the the you
[51:21] salute the two kings of the amorites how
[51:24] god give you strength here and god gave
[51:25] you strength there
[51:26] god made a way here and um we're
[51:30] we're done you have the land already
[51:32] amen
[51:33] amen now therefore i pray you swear unto
[51:37] me by the lord since i have shown you
[51:39] kindness
[51:40] that ye will also show kindness under my
[51:42] father's house
[51:43] and give me a true token that you will
[51:46] save alive my father my mother my
[51:48] brethren and her family
[51:49] so they say put the scarlet thread rope
[51:52] whatever out the window
[51:54] and by that testimony of the token
[51:59] what was it was the was the rope special
[52:02] no no did the rope if you got that rope
[52:05] would you be saved
[52:07] no the rope oh praise god
[52:10] testified of the faith that rahab had
[52:14] in her inheritance and had the faith and
[52:16] that red type
[52:18] redemption amen redemption for for rahab
[52:21] so she was laying
[52:22] claim to her redemption before it even
[52:25] happened
[52:26] he said you put this out your window you
[52:29] make this testament you make this
[52:31] testimony that
[52:32] god is going to redeem you you believe
[52:35] it
[52:35] yes sir that's it and god will spare you
[52:38] and same thing happened
[52:40] amen it was by the testimony of
[52:43] abraham's faith
[52:45] that was imputed to him for
[52:46] righteousness
[52:48] amen so amen she hit the hebrew spies
[52:53] she turns from prostitution and she
[52:56] marries
[52:57] a general in the army of israel amen
[53:00] that is
[53:00] a redemption story matthew 1 5 and
[53:03] salmon begot boaz
[53:05] of rahab
[53:09] rahab wasn't righteous but she accepted
[53:14] god's righteousness well the banham says
[53:16] in why little bethlehem
[53:18] 1958 and i might add here did you know
[53:21] she rahab typed the gentile church
[53:25] she was a gentile she was a type of the
[53:27] gentile
[53:28] church when they heard the message we
[53:30] were all out in spiritual prostitution
[53:33] committing spiritual fornications
[53:34] against the god of heaven
[53:36] and all kinds of stuff all kinds of
[53:38] denominations and religions
[53:40] but when we heard that there was a god
[53:42] that still lived
[53:43] that could perform miracles quickly
[53:46] receive the message
[53:48] quickly amen she didn't even give them a
[53:51] chance to speak
[53:52] she testified that she said no no hold
[53:54] on listen i want the token
[53:56] i'm going to read this next quote so i
[53:58] don't get ahead of myself ray have the
[53:59] harlot that we're all familiar with she
[54:02] uh this is uh god's rap gift 1960 ray
[54:05] have the harlot that we're all families
[54:06] with
[54:07] she being a young girl that was turned
[54:09] on the street by
[54:10] a heathen father and mother that put her
[54:12] on the street because she was beautiful
[54:14] and she was to bring an income to them
[54:16] on prostitution
[54:17] and yet down in this immoral girl that
[54:19] was turned on the street she had heard
[54:21] that there was a god who answered prayer
[54:24] and the first opportunity that she got
[54:26] to accept that god or do something for
[54:28] him
[54:28] she did it and god spared her life and
[54:31] saved her father and mother
[54:33] and her family she the bible says that
[54:35] they they went and came into
[54:37] harlot's house but doesn't tell you how
[54:39] they got there you know what i believe
[54:40] she went looking for them
[54:43] she went looking for her opportunity and
[54:45] then she heard about this and then she
[54:47] heard a rumor of
[54:48] she was a street girl word travels on
[54:51] the streets quickly
[54:53] the king found out after she found out
[54:56] she heard she said hey guys come i'll
[54:58] save you i'll protect you
[55:00] and then she was she was laying hold
[55:02] upon her inheritance and
[55:04] an active face he was stepping out in
[55:06] faith saying look i'll hide you guys
[55:08] risking her own life taking a risk and
[55:11] then by stepping out of faith that god
[55:12] recognized that faith in her heart
[55:14] she fell in love with the general in the
[55:16] army of israel he goes on to say we find
[55:18] in history and married this general
[55:20] and their courtship was wonderful and
[55:22] finally they settled down and lived
[55:23] at bethlehem oh i'm sure them women were
[55:26] gossiping

[55:31] he's courting
[55:33] people can talk
[55:36] but yeah let them talk you're always
[55:40] going to talk

[55:47] the world a son
[55:50] i can't think of the general's name just
[55:51] now but i have it
[55:53] salman i was trying to thought i had his
[55:55] name down here but i don't i have her
[55:57] son's name but it was rahab's
[55:59] son to this general his name was salman
[56:02] not the solomon that's built the temple
[56:04] the son of david but another solomon and
[56:06] this salmon brought forth a son whose
[56:08] name was boaz
[56:10] and boaz oh we are all well acquainted
[56:12] with that wonderful story of boaz and
[56:14] ruth
[56:15] so salman's uh south salmon's great
[56:18] grandfather was
[56:19] caleb's brother um
[56:22] and salman means garment and we heard
[56:26] wednesday night that he uncovered us
[56:31] to reveal our sin and then he covered us
[56:34] amen salmon a garment covered rahab
[56:37] amen marriage redemption
[56:41] and marriage amen an act of faith on
[56:44] rahab's
[56:45] part to preserve redemption this is the
[56:48] household that brought forth boaz
[56:50] a son of redemption amen james 2
[56:54] 25-26 you want to see the grace of god
[56:57] read it right here set into the hall of
[56:58] fame of hebrews
[57:00] or excuse me said into the hall of fame
[57:02] in the new testament likewise also was
[57:04] not rahab the harlot justified by works
[57:07] when she had received the messengers and
[57:09] had set them out another way for as the
[57:12] body without the spirit is dead so faith
[57:14] without works is dead
[57:15] also she's also mentioned in hebrews
[57:18] chapter 11 by faith rahab
[57:20] see it was her faith that testified you
[57:23] think
[57:23] she just accidentally ended up in
[57:25] hebrews chapter 11. no god's showing you
[57:27] the power of his redemption
[57:29] taken from a harlot on the street amen
[57:32] to a by faith in the new testament
[57:36] oh you think you think about your past
[57:39] and the devil likes to bring it up and
[57:41] remind you
[57:42] amen but god has another story that he's
[57:44] written
[57:45] amen god i saw today a quote that a bad
[57:48] chapter is a bad chapter in your life is
[57:52] not the whole book
[57:54] and ain't that the truth for the
[57:55] believers we have chapters in our past
[57:57] amen
[57:58] that testify of a different person amen
[58:00] but you have been justified you have
[58:02] been sanctified you have been redeemed
[58:04] by the power of the holy ghost
[58:06] that is not who you are that is a
[58:09] different book
[58:10] that is a book of of lies that is
[58:13] not you at all because justified means
[58:15] you never did it
[58:17] in the first place amen praise god
[58:20] so we step from this into the boaz and
[58:23] boaz and ruth and we could go
[58:24] read it um and uh
[58:28] praise the lord we will rule chapter
[58:30] four
[58:31] i wasn't going to but
[58:35] ruth chapter four
[58:47] verse one
[58:50] actually now let's back up
[58:57] verse chapter three
[59:02] so naomi tells ruth listen uh he's
[59:06] winnowing
[59:06] barley tonight in the threshing floor go
[59:09] down there
[59:10] for six and she went down onto the floor
[59:12] and did according to all that her
[59:14] mother-in-law bade her
[59:15] and when boaz had eaten and drunk
[59:18] now who brought the gentiles message the
[59:21] jews
[59:22] that's right and the gentiles did all
[59:25] that they made
[59:26] her to do praise the lord and it came to
[59:29] pass verse 8 at midnight that the man
[59:31] was
[59:32] afraid and turned himself and behold a
[59:34] woman
[59:35] lay at his feet and he said who art thou
[59:38] and she answered i am ruth i am handmade
[59:40] spread therefore thy skirt over that
[59:41] hand me
[59:42] handmade for thou art a near kinsman
[59:47] stepping out in faith
[59:50] stepping out in faith that boaz could
[59:52] redeem her
[59:54] stepping on her faith because she
[59:56] recognized him as her kinsman
[59:58] from the message she received so she
[1:00:00] stepped out in faith they have heard
[1:00:02] good things about you
[1:00:04] i've heard you are the kinsmen redeemer
[1:00:07] will you redeem me 11 verse 11 and now
[1:00:11] verse 10 and he said blessed be thou of
[1:00:14] the lord my daughter for thou
[1:00:15] hast showed more kindness in the latter
[1:00:18] and then at the beginning and as much as
[1:00:20] thou
[1:00:20] followers not young men whether poor or
[1:00:23] rich
[1:00:24] and now my daughter fear not i will do
[1:00:26] thee due to the all that thou require us
[1:00:29] for all the city
[1:00:32] of my of my people doth know that thou
[1:00:35] art a virtuous woman
[1:00:37] and now it is true that i am thy near
[1:00:39] kinsman how be it there is a kinsman
[1:00:41] nearer than i tarry this night and it
[1:00:44] shall be
[1:00:45] in the morning chapter 4
[1:00:50] and then when boaz up to the gate and
[1:00:52] sat him down there and behold the
[1:00:54] kinsmen of whom boaz spake
[1:00:56] came by unto him he said ho such a one
[1:00:58] turn aside sit down here
[1:01:00] and he turned aside and sat down and he
[1:01:03] took ten men of the elders of the city
[1:01:05] and said sit you down here
[1:01:06] and they sat down they said under the
[1:01:08] kids men naomi
[1:01:10] that has come again out of the country
[1:01:13] of moab
[1:01:14] selleth a parcel of land which was our
[1:01:16] brother emelex
[1:01:18] and i thought to advertise thee saying
[1:01:21] buy it before the inhabitants
[1:01:23] and before the elders of my people if
[1:01:25] thou wilt redeem it redeem it see you
[1:01:27] couldn't nobody could just buy it
[1:01:29] had to be a kinsman that was the law
[1:01:33] so he's like man yeah i'll take more
[1:01:36] land
[1:01:37] and then boaz says oh but you've got to
[1:01:39] take ruth
[1:01:40] and the kids miss out in verse six i
[1:01:42] cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar
[1:01:44] mine own inheritance redeem thou my
[1:01:47] right to thyself for i
[1:01:48] cannot redeem it for this was the manner
[1:01:51] in former time in israel concerning
[1:01:53] redeeming and concerning changing for to
[1:01:55] confirm
[1:01:55] all things a man plucked off his shoe
[1:01:58] and gave it to his neighbor
[1:01:59] and this was a testimony in israel
[1:02:02] therefore the kinsmen said unto boaz
[1:02:04] buy it for thee so he drew off his shoe
[1:02:07] so boaz
[1:02:09] redeems naomi's inheritance taking
[1:02:12] ruth to wife
[1:02:22] i wish we knew more of of the the jews
[1:02:27] as as a whole you know preachers can
[1:02:30] study that
[1:02:31] to realize just how significant that
[1:02:33] exchange was
[1:02:36] this man wanted this inheritance
[1:02:39] but see the very thing
[1:02:44] ruth was the reason
[1:02:47] this first person could not make
[1:02:50] that redemption
[1:02:54] but that's what ruth needed
[1:02:58] ruth needed boaz to redeem her
[1:03:03] amen we were we would mar
[1:03:07] the inheritance of our nearest kinsmen
[1:03:11] but god put that little caveat in there
[1:03:15] because he wanted us see it's about
[1:03:18] god's desire for
[1:03:20] fellowship with you you sons of
[1:03:22] redemption
[1:03:23] you predestinated sons and daughters of
[1:03:26] redemption god
[1:03:27] had a desire so he called you thy
[1:03:31] name i have redeemed thee oh israel and
[1:03:34] i have called you
[1:03:35] by name and then he knew your name
[1:03:39] he knew the name to speak to catch your
[1:03:42] attention
[1:03:43] and then he knew what to do to catch
[1:03:46] your attention because he had a desire
[1:03:48] in his
[1:03:49] heart he loved you he loves you
[1:03:52] amen i drew on my board i have a
[1:03:54] blackboard in my office i used for work
[1:03:57] and i
[1:03:57] i ruined it i didn't ruin it i wrote all
[1:03:59] over it yesterday
[1:04:01] amen the the book of redemption was
[1:04:04] sealed and we had to have an
[1:04:05] understanding of the book of redemption
[1:04:08] the seven seals sealed the book of
[1:04:10] redemption inside
[1:04:11] amen but god came and revealed that book
[1:04:14] of redemption because he loves us amen
[1:04:18] that's the whole reason that's the whole
[1:04:21] thing amen that's all of it right there
[1:04:23] you sons of redemption
[1:04:25] oh no you're not a son of the world
[1:04:27] you're not a son of of i'm not a son of
[1:04:29] foot in the hand of take i'm a son of
[1:04:30] redemption
[1:04:31] amen i'm a son of jesus christ amen i
[1:04:34] was taken from this world
[1:04:36] and i was redeemed amen i was from moab
[1:04:40] amen look at the time of boaz uh salman
[1:04:43] is boaz's father so we're gonna just
[1:04:46] assume bo
[1:04:47] salman's still alive in his in
[1:04:50] his lifetime jericho was taken so israel
[1:04:53] is still a young
[1:04:54] country so is israel still very much
[1:04:56] aware of what happened in moab
[1:05:00] everybody knows they had they heard the
[1:05:01] stories of balaam and
[1:05:03] and then the the the uh all those
[1:05:06] men committing fornication with the
[1:05:08] daughters of moab and
[1:05:09] and um all that transpired in that story
[1:05:12] and yet
[1:05:13] you have a family of israel go and move
[1:05:15] to moab
[1:05:17] fresh in their minds it just happened
[1:05:19] they were very good at preserving
[1:05:20] history anyways
[1:05:21] but this just just happened a couple
[1:05:23] generations ago
[1:05:25] a few generations back you know their
[1:05:26] great great grandfather or their
[1:05:28] grandfather
[1:05:30] it could have been elimelech's
[1:05:33] you know great grandfather could have
[1:05:35] been one of the
[1:05:36] ones i don't know but they go to moab
[1:05:38] and so you have ruth
[1:05:40] a moabitus what was the talk of the town
[1:05:43] do you hate
[1:05:44] boaz is redeeming a moabite
[1:05:49] you remember what god did to those other
[1:05:51] ones that married those moabites
[1:05:53] he's what he burned in fire or something
[1:05:56] like that he killed him
[1:05:57] dealt with them and here boaz is how can
[1:06:00] that be a god
[1:06:02] if you're deeming of a moabite
[1:06:09] oh god this is because it's not about
[1:06:13] what we think it's not about what we say
[1:06:15] it's not about the laws that we bind god
[1:06:18] into we like to shove him in a box
[1:06:20] because we think we understand how he
[1:06:22] works
[1:06:23] but he says i'm sorry at this point in
[1:06:26] time
[1:06:28] he was giving them a foretaste of
[1:06:29] redemption amen praise god
[1:06:32] so boaz a man his his his his
[1:06:36] mother was rahab
[1:06:39] and look out look how blessed boaz was
[1:06:45] it appears he has a very wealthy and
[1:06:47] he's doing good with his
[1:06:49] his um land and everything
[1:06:52] god blessed him because of the
[1:06:54] sacrifices
[1:06:56] man god blessed him because rahab
[1:06:57] stepped out in faith
[1:06:59] amen salman took her to wife and then
[1:07:01] god was was
[1:07:02] was blessing that and so but ruth with
[1:07:04] an act of faith
[1:07:06] laying at the feet of boaz requesting
[1:07:09] him to redeem the lost inheritance of
[1:07:11] naomi
[1:07:12] amen it was an act of faith to preserve
[1:07:14] redemption
[1:07:16] but boaz and here's where we're starting
[1:07:18] to get to it when i
[1:07:19] when i was on my heart this morning boaz
[1:07:23] a son of redemption
[1:07:26] could catch the revelation of redemption
[1:07:30] he understood he heard the story of
[1:07:33] rahab
[1:07:34] shared her testimony of how she was
[1:07:36] redeemed
[1:07:37] boaz understood he didn't turn his nose
[1:07:40] up
[1:07:40] when god said when god said implant
[1:07:42] redemption
[1:07:44] he didn't turn like some people they
[1:07:45] want to turn their nose up because oh
[1:07:46] they're
[1:07:47] they're not good enough for it they
[1:07:49] don't understand it they don't have a
[1:07:50] revelation of redemption
[1:07:52] but boaz a predestinated son of
[1:07:55] redemption
[1:07:56] had a revelation and took ruth to wife
[1:08:00] that was foreordained of god to type
[1:08:02] christ
[1:08:03] and the bride boaz was acting on the
[1:08:06] will of god because of
[1:08:07] revelation that's the only way you can
[1:08:09] act upon god's will
[1:08:11] is if you have revelation and how can
[1:08:14] you have that revelation unless
[1:08:16] you are a son of redemption
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:20] amen we we can read of a scandalous
[1:08:24] story in ii
[1:08:25] samuel 12 7
[1:08:28] a and nathan said to david
[1:08:32] you are that man
[1:08:37] the judgment stood up and said brother
[1:08:39] david you are that man
[1:08:41] the judgment stood up and said brother
[1:08:43] silas you are that man
[1:08:45] amen but god had a plan of redemption
[1:08:49] amen and god came and david comforted
[1:08:52] bathsheba his wife and went in under her
[1:08:54] and lay with her and she
[1:08:56] bear a son and he called his name
[1:08:59] solomon
[1:09:00] and the lord loved him god through
[1:09:03] that union that started out amen that
[1:09:06] started out as a harlot relationship
[1:09:09] much like rahab started out as adultery
[1:09:13] contrary to god's word god said i have a
[1:09:16] plan
[1:09:17] of redemption through that
[1:09:20] god gave them solomon another son of
[1:09:24] redemption
[1:09:26] amen anointed king of israel the wisest
[1:09:29] man
[1:09:30] david's repentance amen david's
[1:09:34] repentance to god
[1:09:35] amen brought forth a promised son in the
[1:09:38] plan of redemption
[1:09:39] a son of redemption and just like
[1:09:42] through christ the promised son
[1:09:44] just like through christ the son of
[1:09:46] redemption solomon did
[1:09:48] what restored worship to israel amen god
[1:09:51] brought solomon along he built the
[1:09:53] temple
[1:09:53] he he told faced the temple and he
[1:09:56] prayed and god's presence came down and
[1:09:58] that
[1:09:59] avenue of worship was restored amen so
[1:10:02] what does a revelation of redemption
[1:10:04] come from a son of redemption amen
[1:10:07] brings a restoration
[1:10:09] of worship amen amen god had a plan from
[1:10:13] the very beginning
[1:10:14] god likes to oh i'm raising my voice
[1:10:17] because i'm excited
[1:10:18] amen god likes to send examples for us
[1:10:22] to see
[1:10:23] and in his own lineage saints of god he
[1:10:26] showed an example of redemption
[1:10:28] to bring the true provided place of
[1:10:30] worship for you and i
[1:10:32] amen it is because we are predestinated
[1:10:36] sons of redemption
[1:10:37] that we can have a revelation of
[1:10:39] redemption
[1:10:41] amen god restores worship with us
[1:10:44] through that amen he gives us a promise
[1:10:47] if you'll turn
[1:10:48] and humble your heart and seek my faith
[1:10:51] and face this place
[1:10:53] amen god will forgive you your sins
[1:10:56] and then because he knew we would be
[1:10:57] living in a fallen tabernacle
[1:10:59] amen so he restored worship but he gave
[1:11:02] us the ability to continually
[1:11:04] wash us amen and wash us to stand
[1:11:07] and walk in his grace and his purity
[1:11:11] amen praise the lord it takes the son of
[1:11:14] redemption or predestinated it's not a
[1:11:15] redemption to capture revelation
[1:11:17] of redemption he got to revelation amen
[1:11:20] and you can only
[1:11:21] he'll only call you by name amen if
[1:11:24] there's that seed within your
[1:11:26] heart amen we can read in ezra chapter 3
[1:11:29] verse 8 i'm just going to turn there
[1:11:32] really quickly here
[1:11:35] i usually mark in my bible
[1:11:50] sort of quickly now in the second year
[1:11:53] of their coming under the house of god
[1:11:55] at jerusalem in the second month begins
[1:11:57] aruba
[1:11:57] the son of shaltil and yeshua the son of
[1:12:01] jose and the remnant of their brethren
[1:12:04] the priests and the levites and all that
[1:12:05] they
[1:12:06] they that were come out
[1:12:09] of the captivity unto jerusalem and
[1:12:11] appointed levites from 20 years old and
[1:12:13] upward
[1:12:14] to set forward the work of the house of
[1:12:16] the lord
[1:12:18] so zerubbabel was anointed of god to
[1:12:22] return to jerusalem from babylon
[1:12:25] jerubal was in the lineage of christ you
[1:12:27] think that was an accident
[1:12:30] what was the thing that zerubbabel did
[1:12:32] he went back
[1:12:35] and begin to restore worship amen an act
[1:12:39] of
[1:12:39] faith on his part there was enemies
[1:12:42] there
[1:12:43] they wanted to destroy them in an act of
[1:12:45] faith
[1:12:46] amen to preserve redemption reservable
[1:12:49] another son of redemption amen again
[1:12:53] through a son of redemption
[1:12:54] true worship was restored typing the
[1:12:57] restoration of worship
[1:12:58] amen coming through christ praise the
[1:13:01] lord so now we have restored worship
[1:13:07] amen amen
[1:13:11] praise the lord we have one last example
[1:13:14] in the scriptures
[1:13:16] amen the last man in the lineage of
[1:13:19] christ
[1:13:19] joseph now here we have
[1:13:22] joseph is a man
[1:13:26] of integrity a man a carpenter
[1:13:30] a man who understood the law understood
[1:13:33] what was right
[1:13:34] and what was wrong yet
[1:13:38] he knew the story of rahab he knew the
[1:13:41] story of tamar he knew the story of ruth
[1:13:45] these were his lineage these were his
[1:13:47] ancestors
[1:13:48] and he is a spouse to a young girl named
[1:13:51] mary
[1:13:53] all things are going well and
[1:13:57] he's a this beautiful girl he's going to
[1:14:00] marry her he's betrothed to her
[1:14:04] everyone is happy then mary goes on a
[1:14:07] little trip
[1:14:09] and she comes back she's obviously
[1:14:11] pregnant
[1:14:13] now joseph is is torn now joseph doesn't
[1:14:16] know what to do he's a man of integrity
[1:14:18] this is
[1:14:19] the law says
[1:14:23] oh there's so much states of god the law
[1:14:25] said
[1:14:26] but grace the law said
[1:14:29] put her away but see
[1:14:32] joseph was the son of redemption amen
[1:14:35] joseph understood the power of
[1:14:37] redemption
[1:14:38] how could he not you know the story of
[1:14:40] your grandfathers and great-grandfathers
[1:14:42] that fought in the war and you can tell
[1:14:43] their stories he could tell the story of
[1:14:45] rahab and
[1:14:46] salmon he could tell the story of ruth
[1:14:48] and boaz he understood redemption he
[1:14:50] could tell the story of david and
[1:14:52] bathsheba
[1:14:52] amen and the the solomon and he could
[1:14:55] tell these stories and he knew and
[1:14:57] perhaps
[1:14:57] will take the liberty to say so he was
[1:14:59] thinking upon these things
[1:15:01] when he found out when she got over the
[1:15:03] initial shock
[1:15:04] that his betrothed was pregnant out of
[1:15:07] wedlock
[1:15:08] wedlock and you can read it in matthew
[1:15:10] chapter 1
[1:15:11] verse 18 amen
[1:15:14] and now the birth of jesus christ was on
[1:15:16] this wise when as his mother mary was
[1:15:18] espoused to joseph before they came
[1:15:19] together she was found the child of the
[1:15:21] holy ghost
[1:15:22] then joseph her husband being a just man
[1:15:25] see just
[1:15:26] just and not willing to make
[1:15:30] what willing to make her a public
[1:15:32] example was minded to put her away
[1:15:34] privily but while he thought on these
[1:15:37] things
[1:15:38] while he was thinking about this he
[1:15:40] hadn't made the decision yet he was
[1:15:41] giving it careful meditation and thought
[1:15:44] thinking i'm taking the liberties this
[1:15:45] morning to god thinking about rahab
[1:15:48] thinking about ruth wow
[1:15:51] he knew these stories of redemption he
[1:15:53] understood it
[1:15:55] he was a son of redemption he he thought
[1:15:58] i i
[1:15:58] probably wouldn't be here if it wasn't
[1:16:00] for rahab i probably wouldn't be here if
[1:16:02] it wasn't for ruth
[1:16:03] i am i'm part gentile
[1:16:09] and while he thought on these things the
[1:16:10] angel of the lord appeared unto him in a
[1:16:12] dream saying joseph thou
[1:16:13] son of david fear not to take unto thee
[1:16:17] mary thy wife for that which is
[1:16:19] conceived in her is of the holy ghost
[1:16:22] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[1:16:24] shalt call his name
[1:16:25] jesus for he shall save his people from
[1:16:28] their sins now all this was done that it
[1:16:30] might be fulfilled which was spoken of
[1:16:31] the lord by the prophet
[1:16:32] saying behold a virgin shall be with
[1:16:34] child and shall bring forth a son and
[1:16:36] they shall call his name emmanuel which
[1:16:38] is being interpreted is god with us then
[1:16:41] joseph being raised from sleep dead as
[1:16:43] the angel of the lord
[1:16:44] had bitten him and took unto him his
[1:16:47] wife and knew her
[1:16:48] not till she had brought forth her
[1:16:49] firstborn son and he called his name
[1:16:51] jesus you do you really do you think
[1:16:54] that dream could have gone to any man in
[1:16:56] the same situation and they
[1:16:57] have done the same thing joseph does no
[1:17:00] no
[1:17:00] he had to have a revelation because you
[1:17:03] can read these scriptures point blank to
[1:17:05] somebody
[1:17:05] about the major things that we believe
[1:17:07] in the doctrines that we believe in the
[1:17:08] revelations that we have the mysteries
[1:17:10] that were tied up
[1:17:11] and they will look you in the face and
[1:17:13] say so it's a hat
[1:17:17] and it's as plain as day
[1:17:20] it took revelation on joseph's part to
[1:17:24] accept the message from the angel
[1:17:27] amen he came to him in a dream but
[1:17:29] because joseph was a
[1:17:31] son of redemption amen he had a
[1:17:33] revelation of redemption and he redeemed
[1:17:36] mary
[1:17:36] to be his wife and what did that bring
[1:17:38] forth the promised son
[1:17:40] jesus christ when you heard christ
[1:17:44] call your name amen because you're a
[1:17:47] son of redemption amen you caught a
[1:17:50] revelation of that message
[1:17:52] amen and god gave you seed to bring
[1:17:55] forth the promised son
[1:17:56] in your life amen do not think it by
[1:18:00] accident
[1:18:00] that these people were in the lineage of
[1:18:03] christ amen
[1:18:04] he caught the revelation and accepted
[1:18:06] mary in an
[1:18:07] act of redemption she says of god it
[1:18:09] goes much
[1:18:10] further than the cross amen it's all
[1:18:13] about
[1:18:14] you realizing christ as
[1:18:17] your husband amen it's you realizing
[1:18:20] christ
[1:18:20] as your friend because he really really
[1:18:23] really
[1:18:24] wanted to know you he really really
[1:18:26] really wanted to have fellowship with
[1:18:27] you but he could not
[1:18:29] do it hallelujah until you were redeemed
[1:18:33] amen and you could not be redeemed
[1:18:36] unless you were a
[1:18:37] son of redemption hallelujah
[1:18:40] praise god amen
[1:18:43] every one of these men were a part of
[1:18:45] the lineage of christ and what
[1:18:47] have you become amen by your redemption
[1:18:51] you become a part of the lineage of
[1:18:53] christ you
[1:18:54] are the sons and daughters of abraham
[1:18:58] amen the sons of redemption amen typing
[1:19:02] out the redemption story this is true
[1:19:05] restoration amen you have to be a son
[1:19:09] of redemption to catch a revelation of
[1:19:12] redemption amen oh john wept
[1:19:16] because john understood what i've said
[1:19:18] this morning
[1:19:20] john understood it took revelation from
[1:19:22] a son of redemption
[1:19:24] but he understood unless that was loose
[1:19:26] unless those were opened up we didn't
[1:19:28] have a chance
[1:19:29] those aren't my words saints it's in the
[1:19:31] bible all creation would be lost if it
[1:19:33] was not opened up but that book was not
[1:19:35] taken by the land
[1:19:37] amen how can we be redeemed in this last
[1:19:40] day and age unless
[1:19:42] it's open unless god has revealed it to
[1:19:45] us it's a love story saints of god
[1:19:47] it's god's desire it's god's heart
[1:19:50] desire to
[1:19:51] fellowship with you amen and when people
[1:19:54] shut the door
[1:19:55] they turn their back on god amen and god
[1:19:57] can have no fellowship with them their
[1:19:59] life cannot manifest
[1:20:01] amen what god desires for it to manifest
[1:20:03] because they cannot come
[1:20:05] and receive from christ amen the
[1:20:08] promised
[1:20:09] seed amen amen praise the lord it cannot
[1:20:13] be revealed to you
[1:20:14] unless you are a predestinated son of
[1:20:16] redemption you caught a revelation when
[1:20:18] he called you by name
[1:20:19] but you also caught a revelation of
[1:20:21] christ that's
[1:20:22] it you can't catch revelation of jesus
[1:20:25] christ to you
[1:20:26] unless you're a son of redemption next
[1:20:29] time the devil comes up
[1:20:31] and says hey you remember what you did
[1:20:34] sorry that wasn't me i'm a son of
[1:20:37] redemption
[1:20:41] sister you remember what you did sorry
[1:20:43] that wasn't me i'm a daughter of
[1:20:44] redemption
[1:20:47] amen who the son sets free
[1:20:51] is free indeed amen i have come to bring
[1:20:55] truth amen jesus met a woman in samaria
[1:20:59] he said listen our plans were to go to
[1:21:00] this city but
[1:21:02] i gotta stop by samaria for a little
[1:21:04] appointment you guys go in town and get
[1:21:06] the food i'm gonna sit here for a little
[1:21:08] bit
[1:21:08] and up comes a woman
[1:21:12] little did she know that day little did
[1:21:15] she know that day when she got up
[1:21:17] and she put her head down and she went
[1:21:19] in the heat of the day to get her water
[1:21:22] amen in pain and torment of the life she
[1:21:24] led that she would meet
[1:21:26] the son of redemption and then he would
[1:21:29] tell her
[1:21:29] everything she ever did
[1:21:34] and testify to her welcome to the
[1:21:36] lineage of christ
[1:21:38] welcome because you are predestinated
[1:21:40] daughter of redemption
[1:21:42] and then she caught a revelation you're
[1:21:45] the messiah
[1:21:46] he spoke to her he called her by name
[1:21:49] and she accepted the invitation because
[1:21:52] she was foreign before the foundation of
[1:21:56] the world
[1:21:56] to accept it as much amen
[1:22:00] you see these ain't so god it's a big
[1:22:03] picture
[1:22:05] but it's simple amen jesus christ
[1:22:08] loves you
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:12] and he wants you to understand that amen
[1:22:15] he wants you to receive that love
[1:22:18] so he went to the cross then he loosed
[1:22:21] the seven seal book of
[1:22:23] day that's right because he wants
[1:22:26] you to be with him you're his wife
[1:22:29] a man and a woman in a true god-ordained
[1:22:32] relationship
[1:22:34] are inseparable amen because there's a
[1:22:36] love
[1:22:37] in their heart for one another god
[1:22:39] doesn't want god is
[1:22:40] asking us to stop following him in fear
[1:22:43] and start following him in love let him
[1:22:46] know
[1:22:46] amen let him know how much you love him
[1:22:48] next time a fear will come upon you
[1:22:51] or you would want to you will be tempted
[1:22:52] to do wrong remember you don't do it
[1:22:54] because you're in love with him
[1:22:57] you would it would hurt him for you to
[1:22:59] fall amen that's the relationship
[1:23:01] christ is looking for amen praise god
[1:23:04] but guess what you will
[1:23:06] do the right thing because you are amen
[1:23:08] a predestinated son of redemption
[1:23:11] called by name amen praise god
[1:23:14] if the musicians want to come this
[1:23:16] morning amen

[1:23:21] god has given us the gift of redemption
[1:23:25] amen he didn't he didn't have to

[1:23:30] pick you

[1:23:51] when i worked in phoenix
[1:23:52] you come in and you give someone some
[1:23:54] help or something you'd sit on the side
[1:23:55] of their desk and just talk to them

[1:23:58] my desk share this moment with me

[1:24:19] true because you are my redeemer
[1:24:21] and and looking through this and

[1:24:54] push him aside but we get caught up in
[1:24:56] life
[1:24:56] we get caught up focusing on the wrong
[1:24:58] things things of god
[1:25:00] and when we forget to ask him will you

[1:25:44] we have it figured out thanks to god
[1:25:47] that
[1:25:47] we can point the finger out the world
[1:25:50] but when we're too busy for god
[1:25:53] we do the same thing we leave it sitting
[1:25:56] there on the shelf
