[30:49] praise the Lord
[30:50] let's stand tonight if we could turn in
[30:53] Jeremiah chapter 8
[31:14] and it's good to be in the house of God
[31:16] tonight yes it's good to be a Christian
[31:20] you know I was laying in bed last night
[31:24] thinking about the grace of God and how
[31:28] someone can be an absolute mess and that
[31:34] no one would have any respect for them
[31:37] no one would have any desire of a
[31:39] friendship with them but God can come
[31:43] down and in the matter of one evening
[31:47] turn a compersion completely around so
[31:52] they're respected by those around them
[31:54] till they hold true to their word and
[31:58] become someone that you can look up to
[32:03] that's that's the power of God's grace
[32:06] and it's just it's incredible when you
[32:12] stop you think about it
[32:14] Jeremiah chapter 8 verse 22 the Bible
[32:18] says is there no balm in Gilead is there
[32:21] no physician there why then is not the
[32:24] health of the daughter of my people
[32:26] recovered a title tonight is when God
[32:32] asks the question why and my subtitle is
[32:36] the balm in Gilead Bauer heads
[32:38] Heavenly Father Lord we know that we
[32:41] have nothing to bring but our hearts
[32:43] before you father we have nothing to say
[32:47] father but your praises we have nothing
[32:50] to do but worship you tonight father we
[32:54] have praised you in song we have
[32:56] worshiped you in song father now Lord
[32:59] Jesus we worship you with our attention
[33:01] tonight
[33:01] father's we desire to hear Lord from you
[33:05] and father that the devil will come even
[33:08] in the service father and try to take
[33:10] our attention with a stirring hear or a
[33:13] thought of what we have to do tomorrow
[33:16] what we did today
[33:17] father take our attention away for a
[33:19] split second when you have something to
[33:21] say Lord I pray that you would just come
[33:24] down on each heart Lord and take every
[33:27] thought captive
[33:28] to the glory of God Lord that we would
[33:31] be attentive to you tonight Lord Jesus
[33:33] father this is quality time with our
[33:36] bridegroom this is quality time with our
[33:39] husband Jesus Christ and Lord we so
[33:42] desire to hear from you Lord Jesus we so
[33:45] desire that Lord nothing would come
[33:47] between us tonight but they would be
[33:48] open father whether it hurts we would be
[33:52] open with you Lord we thank you Father
[33:54] and commit these words and this service
[33:56] into your hands in Jesus Christ's name
[33:58] we pray amen
[34:00] you may be seated tonight when God asks
[34:05] the question why amen praise Lord I saw
[34:13] this the other day says people pray for
[34:17] the Lord to send them bread then when he
[34:19] gives them the ingredients to take to
[34:21] bake the bread they storm out of the
[34:23] kitchen it's amazing how we have an are
[34:28] we get an idea in our head about
[34:33] anything really
[34:34] and we're so stubborn I need to do
[34:41] something different let me know we're so
[34:43] stubborn that no matter what happens no
[34:47] matter what proof I can show you you
[34:50] won't change your mind because you know
[34:54] you know you're right and to change the
[34:58] mind of a man is something that I
[35:00] believe only God can do you know
[35:04] sometimes we come even the little things
[35:05] we come and we have something and we
[35:07] print it prevent it to some to somebody
[35:09] but God provides the atmosphere that
[35:12] atmosphere for that person to to let
[35:15] their pride down and accept a change of
[35:18] mind there's a lot of things in in life
[35:23] where we as believers we come to a place
[35:26] where we realize that God is asking us
[35:28] to change our mind and God is asking us
[35:30] to look at a situation a different way
[35:33] or God is asking us to accept what he
[35:35] has for us but because it's contrary to
[35:38] what we thought it should be because
[35:40] it's contrary to
[35:41] you think it was or we were taught what
[35:43] it was our entire life we storm out of
[35:45] the kitchen sometimes we have a need in
[35:48] our life
[35:48] maybe we need $500 and we got to have it
[35:51] by Sunday and somebody calls you up
[35:54] Thursday and says hey if you come out
[35:56] and pull the weeds and clean up my yard
[35:58] in the back and in the front I've got
[36:00] three or four rentals that need this
[36:02] done you do that I'll give you five
[36:04] hundred dollars and we return it down
[36:07] because that's work but God answered
[36:10] your prayer he provided a way for you to
[36:12] receive about five hundred dollars and
[36:14] so it's I believe we have to be aware
[36:16] that insensitive to what God is doing in
[36:20] our lives and we have to be aware and
[36:22] sensitive to what God is doing around us
[36:25] and praise Lord sometimes God has to ask
[36:35] the question why and we're gonna get to
[36:39] that but we're also talking about the
[36:41] balm in Gilead tonight and we read the
[36:43] scripture in Jeremiah 822 says is there
[36:45] no balm in Gilead is there no physician
[36:48] there
[36:48] why then is not the health of the
[36:51] daughter my people recovered in other
[36:52] words Jeremiah Jeremiah says asses
[36:54] question but the answer is yes there is
[36:58] a balm in Gilead and so then he says
[37:01] that the answer is yes why are you sick
[37:03] why aren't you healing and the balm of
[37:06] Gilead is the Holy Ghost it's the rock
[37:09] amen the rock in the wilderness the rock
[37:11] that Gideon sacrificed his doubts on and
[37:14] it's the revelation of who Christ is the
[37:19] balm in Gilead changes and gives you the
[37:21] right view of God a lot of people that
[37:25] view God through say their father or the
[37:30] pastor they thought the church they went
[37:32] to or a figure in their lament or in
[37:36] their life and they get a skewed view of
[37:38] God and they think well God is out to
[37:42] get me they think that God is is hanging
[37:46] over them with a hammer ready to strike
[37:48] in and denounce them to a
[37:52] sentence to sentence them away but God
[37:55] is in and where we live the day we live
[37:58] in here on earth God desires our
[38:01] relationship with you and when when
[38:05] sometimes we we we we have healing that
[38:09] we need in our life and and someone has
[38:11] done us wrong and God
[38:13] God that that is not what you would call
[38:17] a sin but that can come between you and
[38:20] God and God says I had there's a balm in
[38:24] Gilead
[38:24] the Lord says there is a salve to apply
[38:27] to this wound to begin the healing but
[38:30] first but why don't you accept it you
[38:33] know saying we don't want God to ask us
[38:37] the question why we want to stay away
[38:40] from that because if he has to ask us
[38:43] why which I believe as human beings we
[38:45] will come to that now did and we will
[38:49] probably in the future because this
[38:50] flesh man is that out of control
[38:53] actually he's not over control if you
[38:55] have the Holy Ghost he's under the
[38:56] control you understand what I'm saying
[38:58] and so he if he's asking you the
[39:01] question why there's something you're
[39:02] missing there's something that that
[39:04] that's you're overlooking and instead of
[39:06] getting mad and storming out of the
[39:08] kitchen stop and say look around and say
[39:10] you know what what do I have here what
[39:13] is God trying to show me and and and we
[39:16] many times we can think of the balm in
[39:18] Gilead as simply a healing the physician
[39:21] and that is true for the outward body
[39:23] that is true for sicknesses but I
[39:25] believe it goes even deeper than that
[39:27] and it can be healing for your soul
[39:29] healing for your spirit here healing for
[39:32] your heart and sometimes we miss God in
[39:37] his moving we miss him in his moving and
[39:41] then he has to turn around and ask us
[39:43] why do you still hurt why are you
[39:46] holding on to this pain when there's a
[39:48] balm in Gilead and the amazing thing
[39:52] about this is if you're gonna cut on
[39:53] your hand and you put neosporin or you
[39:58] put an ointment on there it'll heal that
[40:01] cut it will provide a to chase away the
[40:03] bacteria keep it clean and they will
[40:05] heal it but it doesn't make your thumb
[40:07] or your finger any stronger but the
[40:10] incredible thing about the balm in
[40:12] Gilead is it is an eternal anointment
[40:15] and so what happens is God lays that
[40:17] salve upon you and now you have to be
[40:21] willing to lay down because if if I have
[40:24] a card on my hand and I need stitches
[40:25] and I need some salve and I'm waving it
[40:28] all over the place yelling at the doctor
[40:29] he's not gonna be able to do anything I
[40:31] have to submit my hand to the doctors
[40:33] hand the doctors work and you have to
[40:35] submit your heart to the hand of the
[40:38] surgeon Christ and it's going to hurt
[40:41] there when you go into surgery that
[40:44] surgery is there to save your life if
[40:46] you will but they're still going to come
[40:49] pain from that surgery but that is the
[40:52] process of healing but what the poem
[40:55] does is it is it do I need a swap
[41:37] nice lord
[41:43] all righty hopefully it stays on there
[41:47] okay
[41:48] praise the Lord are we on amen The
[41:56] Devil's fighting us tonight one way or
[41:58] the other he'll come in try to turn your
[42:02] your attention then that's not what I
[42:06] prayed for the Lord keep our attention
[42:08] on you and now we're all thinking about
[42:10] a microphone but that's okay
[42:13] so what the balm in Gilead does is it
[42:15] comes and it heals but then it also
[42:18] strengthens you it when that healing
[42:23] comes you now move and and the next time
[42:28] you face a similar situation there's a
[42:31] strength that wasn't there before
[42:34] because God provides for what we need
[42:38] God prepares us for the future if we
[42:42] submit to him praise the Lord and
[42:45] there's a couple examples here in the
[42:46] scripture and there's more where we're
[42:49] brother Branham talks about or and
[42:52] listen this first one talks about God
[42:53] asking the question why and he says in
[42:56] the balm in Gilead 1959 he says Jeremiah
[42:59] many hundreds of years ago was commanded
[43:02] of Jehovah to stand in the gates of the
[43:04] city and ask this question is there no
[43:07] balm in Gilead or is there no physician
[43:11] there the question is why then he said
[43:15] is the daughter of my people not
[43:16] recovered he says the word why God asked
[43:20] that question when God has made a way
[43:23] for people to escape danger or to escape
[43:25] sickness or troubles or disaster
[43:28] provides a way of escape and the people
[43:30] turn it down and refuse it then God
[43:32] asked why what's the reason that you
[43:35] don't accept it
[43:36] see Oh God did this God took my father
[43:40] and he passed away God allow this this
[43:44] this person to hurt me God allowed this
[43:47] to happen why did God allow that to
[43:49] happen and God doesn't answer those kind
[43:52] of questions God just turns around and
[43:53] says why having
[43:54] accepted the balm in Gilead why have you
[43:56] not accepted my invitation I know you're
[43:58] hurt and I know you're trouble but here
[44:02] take my hand
[44:03] but people don't want that they storm
[44:06] out of the kitchen second Kings chapter
[44:09] 1 you can turn there if you if he would
[44:12] like I'm just gonna read it right out
[44:15] second Kings chapter 1 verse verse 1 and
[44:18] it came to pass when the Lord would take
[44:20] up nope first Kings oh oh maybe its
[44:27] first oh that's because that's chapter 2
[44:36] okay chapter 1 like I said first King
[44:40] second Kings chapter 1 then Moab
[44:43] rebelled against Israel after the death
[44:45] of Ahab and a haze I fell down through a
[44:48] lattice in his upper chamber that was in
[44:52] Samaria and was sick and he sent
[44:54] messengers and said unto them go inquire
[44:56] of Beelzebub the God of Ekron whether I
[44:59] shall recover of this disease but the
[45:02] angel of the Lord said said to Elijah
[45:05] the Tishbite arise go up to meet the
[45:07] messengers of the king of samaria and
[45:09] saying to them is it not because there
[45:11] is not a god in israel that you go to
[45:13] inquire Beelzebub the god of Ekron now
[45:16] therefore thus saith the Lord thou shall
[45:18] come down from that bed on which thou
[45:21] shalt not come down from that bed on
[45:22] which thou art gone up but shall surely
[45:24] die and Elijah departed
[45:26] well the venom says in the same message
[45:28] little further down he says it wasn't
[45:31] because there wasn't a God in Israel
[45:32] neither was it speaking of a haze I
[45:35] neither was it because there wasn't a
[45:37] prophet in Israel but it was the King's
[45:39] stubbornness his hatred for the true
[45:42] prophet prophet of Israel it wasn't
[45:45] because that God hadn't supplied the
[45:47] remedy it was because that he was too
[45:49] stubborn and he didn't like Elisha well
[45:52] I don't like that preacher I don't like
[45:55] that pastor Ike and so what happens is
[45:59] sometimes that's the very person God's
[46:01] going to bring the message of
[46:03] deliverance through but because of your
[46:05] stubbornness you
[46:07] out into the world looking for a remedy
[46:10] he says it was because he was too
[46:12] stubborn and he didn't like Elijah
[46:13] because Elijah had predicted all the
[46:16] evil that happened to his father
[46:17] therefore he had created by the habits
[46:20] of his home to hate the man of God to
[46:23] despise him and reject him lord help us
[46:28] to uplift one another in front of our
[46:33] kids in uplift one another in front of
[46:35] our friends uplift one another in the
[46:37] eyes of God because you never know what
[46:40] your words will do to someone's
[46:42] influence on another person here is a
[46:48] haze I if he would have sent his men to
[46:53] Elijah the story would have been very
[46:55] different but instead he went looking
[46:59] for a remedy even though he knew because
[47:04] he asked them in the further down and he
[47:08] says unto them in verse 7 what manner of
[47:09] man was he which came out to meet you
[47:11] had told you these words and they
[47:12] answered him he was in a head he was a
[47:14] hairy man gert was the girdle of leather
[47:16] about his loins and he said it is Elijah
[47:17] the Tishbite so he knew about it latch
[47:20] and he knew in his heart he should go
[47:22] ask Elijah but he knew that Elijah would
[47:27] say yes you'll come off the bed if you
[47:30] surrender and you do this
[47:32] and you get rid of this and you allow
[47:34] your life to be washed out so there was
[47:39] going to be two applications if you will
[47:41] of the balm of Gilead the first to heal
[47:43] him from falling through the last and
[47:45] the second to heal his heart and his
[47:47] relationship with Christ but he was too
[47:49] stubborn because he didn't like Elijah
[47:52] he was too stubborn and the thing of it
[47:54] is is that we you have to ask Christians
[47:57] we have to look past the the the the we
[48:00] have to look past this earth and we have
[48:03] to look past what we see around us and
[48:06] we have to remember that that that
[48:08] though God is asking us to do something
[48:10] that would be painful because because
[48:13] his I would have to submit his pride and
[48:16] and openly confess that he believed
[48:20] Elijah to be a pro
[48:21] which would go against everything he had
[48:23] said everything his dad had said and so
[48:27] he would have to humble himself and this
[48:30] was just too hard for him to do but what
[48:33] you felt what he failed to realize was
[48:36] nothing is too hard to sacrifice on this
[48:39] side for a chance and a relationship
[48:42] with God for eternity much less your
[48:46] relationship with God here I would much
[48:49] rather be a Christian serving God going
[48:52] and making things right that are
[48:54] difficult to do and have peace in my
[48:56] heart and have rest and enjoy the pieces
[49:00] of this planet that I can while I'm here
[49:03] and have a confidence in God have a
[49:07] confidence of what he's done in me amen
[49:11] to reach out and take as many people
[49:14] with me as I can cuz I'm going
[49:19] amen Matthew nothing wrong with
[49:21] confessing that I thought arrogant at
[49:25] all Matthew chapter 25
[49:27] but the RAM says you know use you to
[49:30] confess that perfect body that healed
[49:33] body in front of you and you step into
[49:35] it well I'm confessing Matthew step into
[49:39] hit into that portion and go to glory
[49:42] you know I loved it I loved to think
[49:45] about that I I don't know I feel like I
[49:47] feel like people sometimes they
[49:49] believers good good god-fearing people
[49:54] should - don't stop often enough to
[49:57] think and imagine themselves I have a
[50:00] very vivid imagination imagine
[50:01] themselves walking on gold and then and
[50:09] then you know you you think about the
[50:11] most beautiful place you've been at and
[50:13] as far as out in the wilderness or the
[50:15] now nature times that by a million and
[50:21] you think about it and then you then
[50:23] then snot to think about think about how
[50:26] you feel right now there's a little ache
[50:28] in your back maybe maybe you have a
[50:31] small headache maybe you have
[50:33] anxiousness none of that's going
[50:35] be there there is so much we go a lot
[50:38] around in life carrying because of the
[50:41] Fallen nature of man that we won't we
[50:44] don't even think about it
[50:45] but it won't even be there do you
[50:49] realize how like sometimes you know when
[50:51] is when it's come time to pay the bills
[50:53] and you're like oh goodness and stresses
[50:55] you out imagine having all the money you
[50:57] could in the world to pay anything you
[50:58] wanted to
[50:58] there'd be no stress about money you
[51:01] wouldn't be worried about it well it
[51:05] does bring grief sometimes though but on
[51:07] the other side all of that taken care of
[51:09] and none of that exists amen
[51:12] I don't know praise the Lord Matthew
[51:14] chapter 25 so we saw his eye and how he
[51:18] turned down he denied the balm and it
[51:22] brought separation it brought death
[51:26] Matthew chapter 25 verse 1 we all know
[51:29] the scripture if you know where I'm
[51:31] going stop let me get there first then
[51:35] shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened
[51:36] unto ten virgins which took their lamps
[51:39] and went forth to meet the bridegroom
[51:40] and five of them were wise and five were
[51:42] foolish they were that were foolish took
[51:44] their lamps and took no oil with them
[51:47] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[51:49] with their lamps while the bridegroom
[51:50] tarried they all slumbered and slept the
[51:56] foolish virgins slept out of laziness
[51:58] the wise virgins slept out of peace with
[52:01] God and that midnight there was a cry
[52:04] made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye
[52:06] out to meet him then all those virgins
[52:09] arose and trimmed their lamps and the
[52:12] foolish that under the wise give us of
[52:13] your oil for our lamps are gone out but
[52:16] the wise answered saying not so lest
[52:18] there be not enough for us and you but
[52:21] go ye rather to them that sell and buy
[52:24] for yourselves some people might think
[52:27] you know that was pretty selfish of the
[52:29] wise well those aren't the Bible say
[52:34] give your cloak and don't expect it back
[52:36] or lend to your neighbor and not expect
[52:39] it back there's not what the Bible says
[52:47] what you don't understand is the
[52:51] relationship between you and God is
[52:55] entirely your responsibility
[52:59] sometimes lending someone cash is
[53:01] detrimental to their growth and maturity
[53:05] you say why won't you help them well
[53:07] because if I do they're just gonna get
[53:09] worse they say well you're supposed to
[53:11] to lend and you're supposed to give and
[53:13] know you're supposed to care for the
[53:15] other person sometimes you know your
[53:18] relationship is between you and God and
[53:21] you are in charge of that and that is
[53:23] your responsibility and if you fail
[53:25] there as the fluence version it in this
[53:30] case that was your fault
[53:35] that was your burden I got really quiet
[53:38] in here right cuz that's the sobering
[53:40] thought I can't save brother David I can
[53:45] pray for him I can extend the hand of
[53:47] mercy but sometimes not brother David in
[53:50] this example but sometimes some people
[53:52] turn you away then what can you do you
[53:55] just step aside and you pray but you
[54:00] don't want to be over there and they say
[54:02] well you're my neighbor and I never
[54:03] heard it from you so don't forget to
[54:06] spread the good news of Christ praise
[54:10] the Lord verse 10 and while they would
[54:13] to buy the bridegroom came and they that
[54:15] were ready went in with him to the
[54:17] marriage and the door was shut afterward
[54:20] came also the other virgin saying Lord
[54:22] Lord open to us but he answered and said
[54:24] verily I say unto you I know you not
[54:26] watch therefore for you know neither the
[54:28] day nor the hour wherein the Son of man
[54:30] cometh you know this reminds me
[54:32] sometimes people say well I just don't
[54:34] have the time I can't do that because I
[54:36] don't have the time but then if you were
[54:38] to accompany them throughout the day and
[54:41] you saw how much time they wasted you'd
[54:44] be able to say you know you had the time
[54:46] if you would not do this or you would or
[54:49] you would monitor this more closely and
[54:51] and you would you and you would have you
[54:53] would have instead of stopping here and
[54:55] here and here and here you didn't need
[54:56] to you could have done it this way
[54:58] look you actually have two hours extra
[55:01] in your day the foolish version said
[55:04] they maybe got to a place where they say
[55:06] well I just don't have the time I'm just
[55:07] too busy with things like I don't have
[55:09] the time to do that I don't have the
[55:11] time to take care of that and they let
[55:13] it go they never had a desire in their
[55:15] heart for that closeness of relationship
[55:18] that the wise version had amen and and
[55:21] so you see them and they're they're good
[55:23] people and they're falling by the
[55:24] wayside because they just don't have
[55:27] enough time if you will but at the same
[55:29] time see they wanted to partake of the
[55:32] rest that the wise version was
[55:34] experiencing but they are partaking of
[55:36] that too soon they had not yet taken
[55:40] care of their lamp and taking care of
[55:41] the the oil and made sure everything was
[55:43] good so that they then could rest so
[55:46] they tried to enter into and then
[55:48] sometimes believers they move past this
[55:50] and well no they know serpents eat and
[55:52] all this stuff and and I need to hear
[55:54] how to raise my kids I need to hear
[55:55] about the deep things of the word but
[55:57] what they do is they're moving past
[55:59] they're moving past that lamp they're
[56:01] moving past making sure and looking in
[56:03] early at their lives and instead going
[56:05] for an intellectual conception of the
[56:08] message and into a conception of the
[56:10] Word of God and they try to enter into
[56:12] this rest but what that rest is is a
[56:14] laziness because they know they they
[56:16] there's something they're not doing to
[56:18] make everything right make sure
[56:19] everything's good and so and so they
[56:22] miss their opportunity to further that
[56:24] relationship with God to apply the balm
[56:27] in Gilead now God is asking the question
[56:29] why were your lamps not filled you had
[56:32] time to sleep but you didn't have time
[56:34] to fill your lamps why they denied the
[56:39] balm and these two things in these two
[56:40] examples they had son as uh as I said
[56:43] and which brought separation which
[56:45] brought death amen
[56:48] Jesus said you know the bridegroom said
[56:51] depart I know you not
[56:55] there was no rillette out of that there
[56:58] is I know you in an intimate way a
[57:00] relationship you can only get that you
[57:04] know you as whenever I went to court my
[57:06] wife I couldn't just walk up and to her
[57:08] when I met her and say marry me I had to
[57:12] to move and I had to work right I had to
[57:15] say the right words I had to get her the
[57:18] flowers I had to spend time with her I
[57:20] had to to woo her right you don't just
[57:27] you have to go through the same process
[57:29] with God he's your lover right you can't
[57:33] just you can't just just there's there's
[57:36] a relationship that you what I'm trying
[57:37] to say is there something you have to
[57:38] work on there's a part you have to do
[57:40] and it's not that that that that there's
[57:43] something you need to go out and do
[57:44] physically it's the fact that you have
[57:46] to write in in order for a relationship
[57:48] to become intimate my wife over time had
[57:51] to open up to me herself who she is what
[57:55] she likes what she likes to do how she
[57:58] feels about certain things how things
[58:00] this bothers her or that makes her happy
[58:03] she has to open up in order for her to
[58:05] open up she has to first trust me with
[58:07] that right and so you have to trust God
[58:10] you have to put your faith in God then
[58:12] you have to open the parts of your heart
[58:14] that you have closed tightly shut
[58:16] because there have been hurt you have to
[58:19] allow that balm in Gilead to come and
[58:21] wash over that soul and bring openness
[58:24] in your heart there was a man that had
[58:27] this problem similar in the Bible in
[58:29] psalms chapter 73 amen i spoke this to
[58:32] the youth a few weeks ago amen his name
[58:34] was Asaph and ACF had a problem if you
[58:39] go back and you read it i encourage you
[58:41] to read it tonight he had it he was
[58:44] looking at the people of the world and
[58:46] this the the chapter starts off with my
[58:49] steps were where I was I was almost
[58:52] backslidden basically because I looked
[58:54] at the wicked and I saw the prosperity
[58:56] of the foolish and I saw how these you
[58:59] know they they they walk basically what
[59:01] he's saying is they walk and they've
[59:03] cursed God yet they are rich they have
[59:06] everything they have all this stuff and
[59:08] I was envious at the scripture the verse
[59:12] says I was envious at the foolish when I
[59:14] saw the prosperity of the wicked his
[59:16] eyes were on the world and he says when
[59:19] I thought to know this it was too
[59:20] painful for me he says I couldn't tell
[59:23] the other Israelites because what would
[59:25] they think about me
[59:26] couldn't express to them what I was what
[59:28] I was going through I couldn't express
[59:30] them how I wanted to be them but then in
[59:33] 7 verse 17 he says until I went into the
[59:36] sanctuary of God then understood I there
[59:40] in the sanctuary of God or the balm in
[59:43] Gilead until he went in with God into
[59:46] the sanctuary with God into the secret
[59:48] place with God then he began to
[59:50] understand and sometimes you know that
[59:53] takes that takes work and so we want to
[59:56] assume things we want to try to guess
[59:58] what it is we want to try to make up
[1:00:00] something that sounds good that fits
[1:00:02] and-and-and-and-and in sand and try to
[1:00:05] formulate an idea and just talk about it
[1:00:09] and man it's fun to talk right it's fun
[1:00:11] to just go what about this and what
[1:00:14] about that and he just he's just a bunch
[1:00:15] of talk but to actually go in and see
[1:00:18] for yourself what God thinks about it
[1:00:21] you have to open yourself up you have to
[1:00:24] surrender and then and in this case
[1:00:26] Asaph did so and now God doesn't ask
[1:00:28] have to ask him the question why it
[1:00:31] opened a staffs eyes to the truth and
[1:00:34] set his heart free then where the Spirit
[1:00:37] of the Lord is there is freedom I mean
[1:00:39] know the truth and the truth shall set
[1:00:41] you free
[1:00:42] and when that truth set you free and
[1:00:44] when it brought you into Christ and that
[1:00:46] truth will continue to set you free
[1:00:48] amen if you open yourself up to the Holy
[1:00:51] Ghost and allow him to bring the healing
[1:00:53] upon your life because the truth of what
[1:00:56] how God see this is the truth of what
[1:00:59] how God sees you not how that person
[1:01:02] sees you that truth will set you free
[1:01:05] from a spirit of inferiority from a
[1:01:08] complex of inferiority because you begin
[1:01:10] to see well how God views you amen that
[1:01:14] is truth that is the absolute truth that
[1:01:19] will set you free the balm in Gilead it
[1:01:22] brings healing from false doctrine they
[1:01:25] say well I I'm out of that church I'm
[1:01:27] out of that false doctrine yeah but
[1:01:29] there's things that linger in your life
[1:01:31] maybe you ask yourself you know how dare
[1:01:33] they why did they do that they they took
[1:01:36] away some of my years and and and now I
[1:01:38] you know he
[1:01:39] during all this false doctrine and how
[1:01:41] could they blatantly speak these words
[1:01:43] without first making sure and and and
[1:01:46] and and and you become wounded and then
[1:01:48] you become offended and if you're not
[1:01:50] careful that offense will take root in
[1:01:52] bitterness and bitterness will drive the
[1:01:54] holy spirit right out of your life but
[1:01:56] God has brought you from that situation
[1:01:59] and placed you here to begin to mend you
[1:02:02] to begin to apply the balm in Gilead so
[1:02:05] if you sit there and you hold that
[1:02:07] bitterness in there in your heart God is
[1:02:10] asking you the question why why do you
[1:02:13] hold on to that when I've set you free
[1:02:15] why do you hold on to that when I have
[1:02:18] given you a healing you say well they're
[1:02:20] not healed yet it doesn't matter for the
[1:02:22] foundation of the world God healed you
[1:02:24] before the foundation of the world God
[1:02:26] set you free
[1:02:28] amen it just takes time for that word to
[1:02:30] catch up and manifest in your life and
[1:02:33] God spoke out and said let there be
[1:02:35] light
[1:02:35] his words went out as you if you would
[1:02:38] they stretched out across the the
[1:02:40] blackness amen they came together they
[1:02:42] brought everything that needed to get
[1:02:44] out the ingredients together that they
[1:02:46] produced the ingredients however it
[1:02:48] happened and out came the Sun God spoke
[1:02:51] the word and rested on that because he
[1:02:53] knows his word will come to pass and God
[1:02:56] has spoken the word to you
[1:02:58] amen never fear God will bring it to
[1:03:00] pass amen the God the balm in Gilead
[1:03:03] provides healing from parental abuse
[1:03:06] those people have been hurt and offended
[1:03:09] by by their parents and sometimes in
[1:03:12] extreme situations sometimes not as
[1:03:15] extreme and they'll carry that with him
[1:03:17] and they begin to view themselves as
[1:03:20] less than what God wants them to see
[1:03:22] themselves and and then they'll live a
[1:03:24] life underprivileged for the Branham
[1:03:27] says I was just reading him sermon total
[1:03:30] deliverance he says there's too many
[1:03:33] underprivileged Christians he said if
[1:03:36] you're living under privileged a mentor
[1:03:39] that's not going to bring total
[1:03:40] deliverance you have to or something
[1:03:42] it's along those lines I can't remember
[1:03:45] the quote but what happens is you begin
[1:03:48] to live under privilege now it begins to
[1:03:50] affect other areas of your life
[1:03:52] and you begin to live a life of defeat
[1:03:55] simply because you accepted somebody's
[1:03:57] opinion about you rather than the truth
[1:04:00] from God amen the balm in Gilead can
[1:04:03] heal past their abuse that's a big
[1:04:07] problem because what happens is abusive
[1:04:11] pastors lift themselves up to a position
[1:04:15] that is untouchable if you will you have
[1:04:19] no right to speak to them to correct
[1:04:22] them not that they ever say that because
[1:04:26] they'll say you know they'll say oh you
[1:04:28] come you come and you show when you
[1:04:29] correct me but the way they push you
[1:04:31] down beneath them to remain control over
[1:04:35] you prevents that open feedback that
[1:04:38] open communication but that is not God
[1:04:41] and that is not how God loves you then
[1:04:45] God doesn't love you because of what you
[1:04:47] do God loves you because of who you are
[1:04:51] you are his child you are his son you
[1:04:55] are his daughter and he loves you not
[1:04:57] because you go and you do this for him
[1:04:59] and you serve and you do this and you
[1:05:03] you all this stuff and you give him
[1:05:05] these praises no he loves you because of
[1:05:07] who you are he wants you to worship Him
[1:05:10] and wants you to praise Him but when you
[1:05:14] do something he doesn't brush you off no
[1:05:18] he's standing there waiting like a
[1:05:19] gentleman saying I love you well just
[1:05:22] come on just come on come over here to
[1:05:25] the balm of Gilead amen
[1:05:27] the balm in Gilead heals from brother
[1:05:30] abuse brother offending brother sister
[1:05:34] offending sister
[1:05:35] sometimes those can't those things can
[1:05:36] just really get to you and they can they
[1:05:39] can cause you to look at somebody I
[1:05:42] think well there's no way in any in any
[1:05:44] way that that person has the Holy Ghost
[1:05:46] what do you know what do you know
[1:05:50] so they offended you there's a balm in
[1:05:53] Gilead get over it
[1:05:55] and you know I say that lovingly right
[1:05:59] there's to you you can't become brother
[1:06:02] Brown says you know that it's often
[1:06:04] quoted there's weak characters built in
[1:06:06] the things that we suffer from suffering
[1:06:10] so people feel have to walk around
[1:06:11] suffering but the Bible says character
[1:06:13] comes through victory you're not called
[1:06:16] us to suffer there's there's a portion
[1:06:19] there's a time of mourning there's a
[1:06:21] time or you you you you go through a
[1:06:24] process and you mourn but God has
[1:06:27] provided a way for you to have victory
[1:06:28] over that and if you if you go beyond
[1:06:31] that and you hold on to it you're doing
[1:06:34] yourself a disservice and God is asking
[1:06:36] me the question why why why do you want
[1:06:39] to hold on to that wouldn't you rather
[1:06:40] hold on to the Holy Spirit
[1:06:43] wouldn't you rather because if you're
[1:06:44] listen as it were we only have room for
[1:06:47] one thing in our hands if you will right
[1:06:51] cuz you're we're not good at juggling
[1:06:53] sorry you might be good in the flesh but
[1:06:55] spiritually you're not good at juggling
[1:06:57] I'm just here to say that for you okay
[1:06:59] it can't juggle there's got to be one
[1:07:01] focus now because of this world and what
[1:07:04] we live in and we have to make money God
[1:07:05] says if you put your focus in me I'll
[1:07:08] take care of everything else around you
[1:07:10] but when we say well you know I got a I
[1:07:12] have to hold on to my job I have to hold
[1:07:17] on to my job my job is really important
[1:07:19] right if I'm holding this where's my
[1:07:21] focus my Hocus is on this okay I'm
[1:07:24] holding on this is my job I gotta keep
[1:07:25] my job a job well where's the Holy Ghost
[1:07:28] where's your word well it's over there
[1:07:30] on the shelf
[1:07:30] yeah it's not doing you any good and all
[1:07:33] this is doing is this bringing
[1:07:35] destruction to everything around you but
[1:07:37] if you hold on to the Word of God
[1:07:40] take it as as it were in front of you
[1:07:42] hold on to it everything else around you
[1:07:46] prospers everything else around you does
[1:07:49] good because you're a child of God and
[1:07:53] God's not gonna let you misbehave thank
[1:07:57] you lord
[1:07:57] that's the grace of God that is the
[1:07:58] grace of God that's why you can't that's
[1:08:00] why when you hold on to your job oh my
[1:08:02] goodness you get drug through the mud
[1:08:04] face-first because you're a child of God
[1:08:07] God says no
[1:08:08] you can't do that you need to be holding
[1:08:11] onto the Word of God in front of you and
[1:08:13] then you do a man then you realize
[1:08:15] everything just starts falling into
[1:08:17] place right and sometimes it falls out
[1:08:20] of place but that's cuz God's teaching
[1:08:21] you something but it's always it's
[1:08:25] always well with your soul because you
[1:08:28] know you know in your heart when you're
[1:08:30] holding on to your job you know in your
[1:08:31] heart when you got something else in
[1:08:32] front of you right you got some other
[1:08:33] Beelzebub or some Beelzebub something of
[1:08:37] the world something some anything that
[1:08:39] you hold above the Word of God you have
[1:08:41] created an idol out of that thing and
[1:08:43] that can be any number of things it can
[1:08:46] be your bitterness it can be the offense
[1:08:48] that someone did to you
[1:08:50] don't be a hater I don't don't don't
[1:08:52] don't go in and try to solve the problem
[1:08:55] some other way go to God and say this
[1:08:57] I'm holding this offense before me but I
[1:08:59] need you to apply the balm and Gillian
[1:09:03] razor Lorne being a Christian is messy
[1:09:14] it was messy when you were born and it's
[1:09:19] messy every day of your life
[1:09:21] but messy in a good way messianic good
[1:09:25] way brother Branham says in in why 1960
[1:09:28] and then every one of us going to school
[1:09:31] he's talking about as a kid had to take
[1:09:33] a dose of castor oil so we'd feel all
[1:09:36] right for school Monday morning our
[1:09:38] systems all of that food we had to eat
[1:09:40] and I got I can't stand to stand to
[1:09:44] smell of the stuff yet and I every time
[1:09:46] I come on hold my nose I'd say mama I
[1:09:48] was the oldest I had to take it first
[1:09:50] I'd say oh mama I just gags me I just
[1:09:52] can't do it
[1:09:53] and she'd say if it doesn't make you
[1:09:54] sick it doesn't do you any good and
[1:09:56] that's the same way with the preaching
[1:09:58] of the gospel if it doesn't stir you up
[1:10:01] to make you sick enough it'll do you
[1:10:04] good
[1:10:04] it's a doctor's prescription it's what
[1:10:06] the doctor ordered
[1:10:08] hold your nose and take it that's the
[1:10:10] best thing it'll take starch out of you
[1:10:12] it'll do that it'll wilt you down it'll
[1:10:15] make you do things that you didn't think
[1:10:16] you would do it might make you a little
[1:10:18] messy but it'll certainly straighten you
[1:10:21] out
[1:10:23] sometimes we have to do things that are
[1:10:25] as children of God we have to take that
[1:10:28] caste royal sometimes and it gets a
[1:10:30] little messy but you know what that's
[1:10:31] alright because God is in it amen and
[1:10:34] God will bless you the balm in Gilead
[1:10:36] amen it always leaves a mark on you but
[1:10:41] the man says when you meet God you go
[1:10:43] away different you either go away worse
[1:10:45] or you go away better sometimes you have
[1:10:49] a cut or something that that's bad
[1:10:51] enough that you apply the ointment and
[1:10:52] it heals but there's still evidence of
[1:10:54] that cut on your arm or on your hand
[1:10:57] it's a scar but that scar doesn't mean
[1:11:00] that scar on your heart doesn't mean God
[1:11:02] doesn't love you it means God healed you
[1:11:04] and man it means God came and he applied
[1:11:07] the balm in Gilead to your heart and he
[1:11:10] gave you healing a scarves testified to
[1:11:13] healing and once a wound has become a
[1:11:19] scar and then I'm stealing this it
[1:11:22] becomes history the the the the I our
[1:11:28] brother preached one time he's talking
[1:11:30] about the earth and how deep down in the
[1:11:32] earth there's these these and sometimes
[1:11:34] on the outer layer of the earth your
[1:11:37] fossils scars of what happened in the
[1:11:40] past scars from the flood when the flood
[1:11:42] swept over the earth man but then though
[1:11:45] the earth grew up the earth Bluegreen
[1:11:48] over it but deep in under the layers of
[1:11:50] the earth is scars of that that happened
[1:11:55] but it's a it's a it's a history that
[1:11:57] that the earth has been through and has
[1:12:00] recovered if you will there's there's
[1:12:02] history there's marks in your life and
[1:12:04] in your heart that you had that you have
[1:12:06] overcome that God has healed that God
[1:12:08] has brought and now you can turn around
[1:12:09] and testify you see this you see this
[1:12:12] scar here yeah I almost lost my hand
[1:12:14] yeah but it's good to go now right God
[1:12:19] came along and He healed you now buh-bam
[1:12:21] says you want something that you have a
[1:12:23] hard time with are you struggle with the
[1:12:24] feeling wrong in your life God watch God
[1:12:26] turned that around and turned it into a
[1:12:27] testimony to go out and help someone
[1:12:29] else
[1:12:30] you never know if what you're going
[1:12:32] through you say I don't understand why
[1:12:34] I'm going through this maybe God is
[1:12:36] sending you through it so that you can
[1:12:37] turn around and help somebody else down
[1:12:39] the road you never know so instead of
[1:12:41] feeling sorry for yourself and wondering
[1:12:43] why you're the one always going through
[1:12:44] problems amen stand up and confess it
[1:12:48] and have faith and and go to God and say
[1:12:50] maybe there's something that you're
[1:12:52] trying to teach me here maybe this is
[1:12:53] for somebody down the road and stop
[1:12:55] feeling sorry for yourself
[1:12:57] praise the Lord help us lord I got you
[1:13:00] no fingers pointing back at me amen the
[1:13:04] balm in Gilead gives revelation which is
[1:13:08] the power to overcome you know that
[1:13:12] that's why brother never says revelation
[1:13:14] is more important to you than perhaps
[1:13:15] you realize because if you have
[1:13:16] revelation of something nobody can talk
[1:13:19] you out of it and that gives you the
[1:13:23] power to overcome feel the revelation of
[1:13:25] who you are in Christ and the devil
[1:13:27] comes along says no you're not you're
[1:13:29] this person who you used to be you can
[1:13:31] say no sorry get lost that looks I have
[1:13:33] a revelation of Who I am today if you
[1:13:36] have a revelation of and this is the one
[1:13:38] we use all the time the open word no one
[1:13:41] can come along and talk you out of who
[1:13:42] Christ is because you've met Christ no
[1:13:45] one can tell me that's not Isaac Nash
[1:13:47] I've met Isaac Nash I have revelation of
[1:13:51] who Isaac Nash is you can't come a long
[1:13:56] time no that's not Isaac now session
[1:13:57] Walter sorry yeah I don't know who you
[1:14:01] are or what you're talking about you're
[1:14:02] wrong right nothing can change that it's
[1:14:08] revelation that brings you the power to
[1:14:10] overcome the balm in Gilead brings
[1:14:13] justification in your life I heard on
[1:14:15] the radio appreciated a he was talking
[1:14:16] about they were talking about just or
[1:14:17] Naaman was a preacher but no
[1:14:19] justification they read some new new
[1:14:22] translation and and the way it sounded
[1:14:24] and he tried to explain stood
[1:14:25] justification as you know that means
[1:14:27] that you're forgiving completely and I
[1:14:29] thought oh what a shame justification
[1:14:31] means you never even did it in the first
[1:14:33] place
[1:14:34] god justifies you that means you God
[1:14:37] can't look in your past and see that
[1:14:40] thing because you've been justified it's
[1:14:43] not even there it's not even there it's
[1:14:47] empty you go back and you thinking where
[1:14:50] was that again it's not there Amen that
[1:14:54] balm in Gilead brings eternal life amen
[1:15:00] but the revelation brings power to
[1:15:02] overcome revelation brings eternal life
[1:15:05] see it all goes hand in hand I'd love
[1:15:08] the continuity of the scripture one
[1:15:10] thing leads to another which leads to
[1:15:12] another which then loops back and leads
[1:15:14] back to that again eternity right goes
[1:15:16] into continuous loop so the Word of God
[1:15:19] and I I preached a sermon one time and
[1:15:21] and I don't know I think it went over
[1:15:23] everyone's head and I might put that one
[1:15:25] to the shelf but you know if any of you
[1:15:29] like geometry in in school you had to do
[1:15:32] theorems basically this proved that
[1:15:36] proved that proved that right and that's
[1:15:39] that to me I see that in the Word of God
[1:15:41] this leads to that leaves and brother
[1:15:44] Brando said God's in math you know that
[1:15:46] and so so you look at that and you see
[1:15:49] well well I know this is true because
[1:15:51] this is true anyways I find that super
[1:15:55] fascinating it's just a little that was
[1:15:57] free that one was free so the revelation
[1:15:59] your faith and your trust in God brings
[1:16:02] a revelation that revelation brings the
[1:16:06] power to overcome that power to overcome
[1:16:09] amen what brings you into eternal life
[1:16:12] brings you to the other side brings you
[1:16:14] but it also brings you that power over
[1:16:17] come brings you into a relationship with
[1:16:19] God bridge into a closeness with God
[1:16:23] amen and then that closest with God
[1:16:25] plants the seed in your womb then God
[1:16:27] begins to grow and what are you bringing
[1:16:29] forth thank you for hurting that you're
[1:16:32] bringing forth Christ
[1:16:34] you say oh that kid looks just like his
[1:16:36] dad right you're bringing forward the
[1:16:39] attributes of Christ within you and
[1:16:42] revelation restores your soul because
[1:16:45] you you you fellows that you can have
[1:16:47] the
[1:16:48] who goes on your spirit every day of
[1:16:49] your life and go to hell but you get
[1:16:51] that Holy Spirit on your soul that's a
[1:16:54] revelation because God says I see his
[1:16:57] faith and so I'm going to circumcise him
[1:16:59] as a testimony of his faith and give him
[1:17:02] the Holy Ghost that's what God did with
[1:17:03] Abraham amen and so now that revelation
[1:17:07] of God that revelation of who he is
[1:17:09] brought restoration to your soul amen
[1:17:15] the early apostles had to have a
[1:17:18] revelation of Christ to move from the
[1:17:21] dispensation of the law to the
[1:17:24] dispensation of grace this all goes back
[1:17:27] to the balm in Gilead so if you think I
[1:17:28] just took this hard right we'll just
[1:17:31] hang on believers today have to have a
[1:17:34] revelation of who Christ is to move into
[1:17:36] the marriage of the Lamb you you cannot
[1:17:42] overcome this world without a revelation
[1:17:45] of who Christ is I'm sorry you can
[1:17:49] confess with your mouth you can talk
[1:17:51] about it you can discuss who you think
[1:17:53] God is but unless you have a revelation
[1:17:56] of who Christ is you will not overcome
[1:18:00] the world
[1:18:04] God sent His only Son to die for us I'm
[1:18:09] going to bachcha the scripture that we
[1:18:12] might have eternal life we read that
[1:18:15] Scripture we hear that scripture is it
[1:18:17] is read but do you realize that that was
[1:18:19] part of the opening of the word because
[1:18:23] the opening of the word is redemptions
[1:18:24] plan how can you accept the blood of
[1:18:28] Christ when you can't accept the
[1:18:30] redemption plan how can you accept a god
[1:18:34] and desire to live with somebody to live
[1:18:37] with Christ in this instance without
[1:18:40] knowing him and who he is you know you
[1:18:44] never how do I had our Lord help me you
[1:18:47] never want to open yourself up to
[1:18:49] someone in confidence unless you have
[1:18:51] trust in them
[1:18:53] but but you're never going to get
[1:18:56] anywhere in that relationship unless you
[1:18:58] find trust at some point and if you
[1:19:01] can't trust that person then you need to
[1:19:02] move on or or if you know they're the
[1:19:06] right one and you just have trust issues
[1:19:07] and you need to pray that God gives you
[1:19:09] the ability to trust so if you never
[1:19:12] desire to open yourself up people that
[1:19:14] they that they want they want the
[1:19:16] message this is goes back to the foolish
[1:19:18] version they want they wanted that rest
[1:19:20] they wanted that sleep they wanted they
[1:19:22] wanted that benefits that the fwice
[1:19:24] virgin had but they didn't want to go
[1:19:27] through the blood if you will and they
[1:19:31] didn't want to they didn't want to go in
[1:19:32] and receive the seed because praise the
[1:19:36] Lord and so so they will that they
[1:19:39] wanted to partake of that so you see
[1:19:40] these people their lives display to you
[1:19:45] not Christ but when you talk about the
[1:19:50] word their lips speak Christ's right you
[1:19:56] know sound I'm saying the concept the
[1:19:58] intellectual side of it and if you're
[1:20:00] not careful you'll become baffled by
[1:20:02] that but what it is is it's a lip
[1:20:04] service they have it in their head but
[1:20:08] they've never opened up their heart
[1:20:09] because Lord take it from my head down
[1:20:11] to my heart or their song right in order
[1:20:13] for me to go from your head to your
[1:20:15] heart you have to open your heart and
[1:20:20] you'll meet these people sometimes
[1:20:21] they're very hard they're hard why
[1:20:24] because the sphere of Christ the Spirit
[1:20:26] of Christ is not hard the Spirit of
[1:20:28] Christ is gentle and loving and humble
[1:20:31] not like home bless you brother

[1:20:42] not arrogant but these people go around
[1:20:45] there's a hardness why is there a
[1:20:46] hardness because they don't have the
[1:20:47] Holy Ghost so their heart is hard
[1:20:50] where's Laura Wow okay they need the
[1:20:53] balm in Gilead we need it
[1:20:58] how Wow the how dare we point a finger
[1:21:01] we don't have the right to point a
[1:21:02] finger or forgive me I wasn't trying to
[1:21:04] put the finger but it's amen so the
[1:21:16] believer has to catch a revelation of
[1:21:18] who Christ is to move into the marriage
[1:21:19] of the lamb and the invitation has been
[1:21:22] extended cool you go go out into the

[1:21:46] even lies excuses because they're too
[1:21:50] afraid of what going accepting the
[1:21:53] invitation will require of them God
[1:21:57] wants it all
[1:21:58] he doesn't want partial he wants it all
[1:22:04] at the at the judgment God will be
[1:22:08] asking the question why as a judge ready
[1:22:12] to administer punishment or or life or
[1:22:16] death on this here now were we in this
[1:22:20] in this day and age and on earth he asks
