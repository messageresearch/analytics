[35:15] at uh winco was a hundred percent
[35:18] and uh
[35:19] you know sometimes you know you just do
[35:21] that but god's good and it's not just
[35:23] about finding something but it's time
[35:25] together and fellowship in the great
[35:27] outdoors god's creation
[35:30] and how beautiful that is amen and let's
[35:33] not forget this coming sunday five

[35:41] this evening i just want to

[35:50] always more you know saints i i if you
[35:53] guys could just see my heart
[35:54] i'm just like lord i just want to bring
[35:56] something profound simple and short to
[35:59] the saints
[36:00] and it always turns into something that
[36:03] is convoluted
[36:05] deluded and long
[36:07] and i'm like lord help me but i just
[36:10] pray saints as we press to the mark of
[36:12] the high calling that the lord just
[36:14] takes the word that's preached
[36:16] ministered from this pulpit and just
[36:18] makes it real in our hearts we don't
[36:20] need a great man with great words we
[36:22] need a great god in our midst and a
[36:24] great spirit to move upon us and so we
[36:27] just thank the lord for that i want to
[36:28] turn to matthew the fifth chapter
[36:31] amen
[36:32] brothers did we turn this screen off or
[36:34] is it not working or
[36:37] no
[36:38] okay well that's good i want to preach
[36:40] to you go backwards here i want to do
[36:42] this i want to preach to you this very
[36:46] very simple little thought
[36:48] of this little light
[36:51] of mine
[36:53] you see we can get all excited saints
[36:55] and and uh
[36:57] i don't want to be rude about it but we
[36:59] can get all excited and look at the
[37:00] great men in our lives great ministers
[37:03] profit etc and we can focus and say they
[37:07] this happened and this happened and this
[37:09] happened
[37:10] but let's stop tonight take a little bit
[37:12] of time
[37:14] and look at this little of mine
[37:17] amen the little light that god has given
[37:20] to you and i
[37:21] amen he didn't want us now you can find
[37:24] the the foundation or fundamentals of
[37:26] this in the message not brother brown's
[37:28] exact words
[37:30] but we're not looking to live in the
[37:32] glow
[37:34] of someone else
[37:37] we want to live in the light
[37:40] and so as we press to the mark of the
[37:42] high calling
[37:44] god loves you and i so much that he sent
[37:47] that little beam of light
[37:49] wherever we were on the face of the
[37:52] earth
[37:53] it didn't matter north south east west
[37:55] what caught
[37:56] none of that matter god says i have as
[38:00] it were a ray or a beam of light for you
[38:03] and to me it just stirs my heart very
[38:05] shall be called the children of god
[38:07] blessed are they which
[38:09] are persecuted for righteousness sake
[38:11] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[38:14] now
[38:16] see it moves from
[38:18] somewhat impersonal
[38:21] look how this suddenly now takes a
[38:22] little shift
[38:24] blessed are ye
[38:27] no longer vague
[38:29] not just one of the crowd but god wanted
[38:32] to single you
[38:33] out
[38:35] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[38:39] and persecute you and shall say all
[38:41] manner of evil against you falsely for
[38:44] my name's sake
[38:47] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[38:50] is your reward in heaven for so
[38:52] persecuted they the prophets which were
[38:55] before you ye are the salt of the earth
[38:58] but if the salt has lost his savor
[39:01] wherewith shall it be salted it is
[39:03] thenceforth good for nothing but to be
[39:06] cast out and be trodden under foot of
[39:08] men
[39:09] now i want you to
[39:11] i want you to catch this saints i think
[39:14] if we catch the real essence of verse 13
[39:17] it'll be very enlightening
[39:19] to us
[39:21] when we catch that
[39:23] when i
[39:25] lose my feeling
[39:27] you use lose your feeling
[39:30] for the saints
[39:32] when we no longer care about the little
[39:34] blanket native when we no longer care
[39:37] about the drunk
[39:39] or the
[39:40] ill-famed dressed woman on the street
[39:42] when we no longer care
[39:44] about the one down the pew from us
[39:47] when we no longer do i need to go any
[39:49] further
[39:51] you see when we have lost
[39:54] that
[39:55] where the prophet of god sees he stops
[39:57] and he says you know what i lost my
[39:59] feeling for the people you see my
[40:02] brother and sister some would say how
[40:03] dare you you're going to judge the
[40:05] prophet by this scripture he judged
[40:07] himself i don't have to judge him he
[40:09] judged himself he said i lost my feeling
[40:12] for the people and i had to get away
[40:14] from them
[40:16] imagine
[40:18] us preachers of just a little assembly
[40:20] like this and we just feel like we have
[40:21] it so
[40:22] rough and the prophet dealt with the
[40:25] spirits of the age dealt with all this
[40:27] ecumenical spirit satan poured
[40:30] everything against him
[40:32] and in his flesh he got battered down
[40:34] just like
[40:35] david said in the psalms
[40:38] though my enemy cast me to the dirt
[40:42] but you see god knows what he's doing so
[40:45] if we've lost
[40:47] that
[40:48] our effectiveness as a christian
[40:50] diminishes right with that loss of
[40:52] feeling for the people
[40:57] ye i love this see it's now becoming
[41:00] more of this scripture here chapter five
[41:02] more and more personal ye are the light
[41:05] of the world a city that is set on a
[41:07] hill cannot be hid neither do you light
[41:10] a candle and put it under a bushel but
[41:13] on a candlestick and it giveth light
[41:15] unto all that are in the house
[41:18] let your light so shine before men that
[41:20] they may see your good works and glorify
[41:23] your father which is in heaven can we
[41:26] say amen to the word tonight heavenly
[41:28] father just ask for your blessings lord
[41:30] give us wisdom and leadership tonight we
[41:32] pray in your name amen you may be seated
[41:38] as i read these scriptures one of the
[41:40] first things that it speaks to my heart
[41:42] is this beautiful
[41:44] oh i don't know if i can express it
[41:46] quite
[41:47] but this absolutely gorgeous opportunity
[41:50] that god gives
[41:51] for us
[41:52] to to
[41:54] show the world our lord jesus christ
[41:56] this opportunity to uh
[41:59] for the world to see christ in us see
[42:02] christ in you and you know it is just uh
[42:05] often times if we're not careful satan
[42:07] will try to just uh by the cares of life
[42:10] rob
[42:11] uh this victory that we have in our joy
[42:13] of who we are in jesus christ and so as
[42:16] satan just batters us and and the things
[42:18] of life just where and where and where
[42:20] uh you know we find ourselves we start
[42:23] to take things inwardly into ourself and
[42:26] we find ourselves uh you might say in a
[42:28] sense offended by the things of life and
[42:31] we find ourselves struggling to enter
[42:33] into the word or or feel the uplifting
[42:36] power of the word and we realize that
[42:38] that is just satan trying to as we spoke
[42:41] on sunday satan trying to take you
[42:43] hostage and so as it is if he can take
[42:46] your mind hostage your heart
[42:48] or your body then you know he's
[42:50] accomplished a great thing but uh we
[42:53] look here in this and we see these words
[42:56] if you have a red letter bible you see
[42:57] these words spoken by our lord jesus and
[43:00] it's there if you go to the beginning of
[43:02] that scripture verse one
[43:05] you'll see that this my brother and
[43:07] sister was actually uh it tells us that
[43:10] jesus when he saw the multitude he then
[43:13] turned and went up into the mountain but
[43:16] you know look at this god sometimes just
[43:18] lets little things turn us one way or
[43:20] the other and it's still god in control
[43:22] right and jesus sees this uh this great
[43:26] multitude and he turns goes up into the
[43:28] mountain the apostles go with him and
[43:30] what a lovely time my brother and sister
[43:32] that god grants to them because they now
[43:34] get a mountaintop experience with the
[43:36] lord jesus christ i'll tell you what i
[43:39] would love to have a mountaintop
[43:41] experience with the lord jesus christ to
[43:43] sit there and have him speak to me and
[43:45] just to pour out his word to us but you
[43:48] know what
[43:50] if we look correctly at the word we
[43:52] have every opportunity to have our
[43:54] mountaintop experience
[43:56] because he is the word and the word is
[43:58] present with us and we take the word
[44:00] with us and we literally in the right
[44:02] spirit the right attitude the right
[44:04] approach can sit on the mountaintop and
[44:07] have our lord jesus christ speak to us
[44:09] amen isn't that beautiful you know so
[44:11] many people will you know i would have
[44:13] loved to been there you know if i had
[44:15] been there i would have i would have
[44:17] been a faithful follower of jesus christ
[44:20] well if you would have been a faithful
[44:22] follower there you'll be a faithful
[44:23] follower here amen so we just thank the
[44:27] lord for his grace and mercy so this
[44:29] mountaintop experience he starts to
[44:31] speak to the apostles and and my brother
[44:34] and sister truly well i just have to
[44:36] admit that would be such an incredible
[44:38] experience amen but you know jesus
[44:41] didn't come and just ra raw them and pat
[44:44] them on the back he actually spoke the
[44:46] words that was necessary to if you don't
[44:49] mind me using this phrase to trim the
[44:51] fat
[44:52] he was there to cut away those things
[44:54] that were unnecessary to
[44:56] lay he was laying in a food for due
[45:00] season my brother and sister and imagine
[45:02] now these apostles as time goes on how
[45:06] uh some good right uh and uh experiences
[45:09] that they're like yep this is what he
[45:11] was talking about but think about how it
[45:13] is that god knowing what is necessary in
[45:15] her life he sometimes speaks words like
[45:18] peter heard
[45:20] now you know in your heart
[45:22] you don't even need an imagination that
[45:24] peter
[45:25] actually thought our lord jesus christ
[45:27] was wrong
[45:30] he literally in his heart was like
[45:32] there's no way
[45:34] i would do that
[45:36] but look how strong the spirits are
[45:37] really it is just let's look at the
[45:39] picture look how strong the spirits are
[45:41] but look it's not just that he was
[45:44] overcome with a spirit but i want you to
[45:46] know that everything happened so quickly
[45:49] and in such a fashion take this to your
[45:52] heart in such a fashion that we can be
[45:55] shouting on the rooftop one day and the
[45:57] next day doubting our experience because
[45:59] we get battered and it's just too much
[46:02] it overwhelms us in the human element
[46:04] and and we're there and so here's peter
[46:07] there ain't no way i'll deny my lord
[46:09] jesus christ now imagine how crushing it
[46:12] must have been in his heart when that
[46:14] crowed
[46:17] he would have been a man that was just
[46:18] so broken in his spirit that he
[46:21] literally i can just see it my brother
[46:23] and sister him declaring i am of no
[46:26] value to my lord jesus christ
[46:28] but you see there was a little something
[46:30] i hope you don't take this too personal
[46:32] tonight but little something in our
[46:34] spirit sometimes that we hold on to so
[46:36] desperately it is somehow we claim it in
[46:39] our identity and that is actually what's
[46:42] keeping us from a complete surrender to
[46:44] the lord jesus christ and god has
[46:47] promised that he would lead us and guide
[46:49] us into all truth and so he's going to
[46:52] come put you in a situation that breaks
[46:55] that little thing you hold so tight
[46:58] but was peter worse off or better off
[47:03] come on saints
[47:05] amen he was better off to have that
[47:07] broken in his life
[47:10] and we would be better off if we would
[47:12] let the lord break things in our lives
[47:15] see he's not here just to crush us my
[47:17] brother and sister he's here
[47:19] the fragrance
[47:21] the essence of the fragrance is not
[47:24] released or revealed
[47:26] until the crushing
[47:28] of the flower
[47:31] and god says you know what i know what's
[47:33] in you the prophet of god said
[47:34] everything you need to make the rapture
[47:35] is in you now my brother and sister if
[47:37] that's bottled up in something in our
[47:40] life then god has promised he's going to
[47:42] come he's going to crush that to release
[47:44] the fragrance of faith
[47:48] the essence of who we are in jesus
[47:50] christ must be released
[47:53] and he will do what is necessary i hope
[47:55] that we can lift our hands on that day
[47:57] and say oh lord thank you
[47:59] instead of oh pitiful man that i am
[48:03] amen
[48:05] so we see these words this mountaintop
[48:07] experience
[48:08] they were admonished they were
[48:10] encouraged
[48:11] now
[48:12] i want you to catch this and and i hope
[48:14] that i can really express this in the
[48:16] way that i felt like the lord laid it
[48:18] upon my heart you see my brother and
[48:20] sister i believe tonight
[48:23] yes the naysayers say that you're a
[48:25] bunch of crackpots
[48:27] is it okay to talk straight
[48:30] the naysayers say you're a bunch of
[48:31] crackpots right that you're whatever but
[48:34] you know what i can sit here tonight and
[48:36] i can seriously look not just picking
[48:38] one man or woman or family or something
[48:41] but i can say i don't see any other
[48:43] position on the earth that i would like
[48:46] to trade mine for
[48:49] this is nothing about this person or
[48:51] that person that church that church that
[48:53] pastor that pastor
[48:55] but looking at our own life
[48:58] i trust that you can say amen to this
[49:01] oh you know
[49:04] i was talking with hired man today
[49:08] and he brought up something about
[49:10] somebody he knew that won a lottery
[49:14] and he's like hmm
[49:20] that means very bad
[49:23] totally messed him up
[49:26] and then i got to joking with him
[49:27] because he's that kind of man i said
[49:28] come on tell me jesus
[49:30] surely
[49:31] surely you could use a little more money
[49:34] and he was like
[49:35] of course i could use more money just
[49:37] like you
[49:38] but not if it does that to me
[49:42] and he says it causes me to think
[49:45] what is good for me
[49:47] and what is bad for me
[49:49] and i want what is good for me
[49:55] can we say tonight we're blessed
[49:58] i mean really truly from the depths of
[50:00] our heart
[50:02] put everything out and just look at that
[50:04] and say is my life blessed or not
[50:06] is god dealing with me is god hearing my
[50:09] prayers is my my life oh but brother
[50:13] paul
[50:14] yeah i know
[50:16] tires go flat
[50:17] cars run out of gas
[50:19] power bills have to be paid
[50:22] all of that goes on
[50:24] but the scripture says it happens to the
[50:26] rich
[50:27] and the poor
[50:28] and it happens to the righteous
[50:31] and the unrighteous
[50:33] wait so if we give up our righteousness
[50:36] we still got these
[50:38] problems and if we inherited millions
[50:43] we would still have
[50:45] these problems
[50:49] so god through his word has declared
[50:51] that we are truly a blessed people now i
[50:53] want to lay a foundation for you here
[50:56] let's go brothers to uh luke the first
[50:58] chapter uh we're going back now is
[51:01] luke's account of uh what happened with
[51:04] uh mary and in the sixth month the angel
[51:06] gabriel was sent from god into the city
[51:09] of galilee named nazareth to a virgin
[51:12] that's me
[51:13] can someone say amen
[51:15] amen
[51:17] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[51:19] was joseph of the house of david the
[51:21] virgin's name was mary and the angel
[51:24] came in unto her and said hail thou art
[51:28] highly favored
[51:30] the lord is with thee blessed art thou
[51:33] among women and when she saw him she was
[51:35] troubled at his saying and cast in her
[51:37] mind what matter of salutation this
[51:40] should be
[51:41] and the angel said unto her fear not
[51:43] mary for thou hast found favor with god
[51:46] do you realize my brother and sister if
[51:48] you'll take this into the word of god
[51:50] and if we were going to stay here all
[51:52] night i could lay this out bit by bit
[51:54] for you but i believe as established
[51:56] believers you can put this in place as
[51:59] we look tonight this scripture is
[52:01] actually speaking of you and i amen it
[52:04] is not something uh 2 000 plus years ago
[52:08] but this is a living scripture tonight
[52:10] because god sent an angel right that's
[52:12] what prophets are defined in the word a
[52:15] god sent an angel and come and said that
[52:18] you are highly favored you are blessed
[52:23] to be of those of this generation that
[52:27] names are in the lamb's book of life
[52:30] you talk about a blessing my brother and
[52:32] sister you talk about being highly
[52:35] favored now the definition of blessed
[52:38] or it's a second part definition of
[52:40] blessed is highly favored
[52:44] now can i just remind you a bit here it
[52:47] would be if we kind of feel bad for
[52:49] ourselves uh highly favored are the poor
[52:52] in spirit
[52:54] highly favored are those that mourn
[52:56] highly favored are the meek highly
[52:58] favored are those who hunger and thirst
[53:00] after righteousness are you with me
[53:02] highly favored my brother and sister to
[53:04] the merciful
[53:06] highly favored to those pure of heart
[53:08] highly favored to the peacemakers
[53:13] highly favored
[53:16] those that are persecuted
[53:20] we often look at this and say well okay
[53:22] that's wonderful that's wonderful but it
[53:23] doesn't feel but my brother and sister
[53:25] you see mary didn't get off with just
[53:28] having a child and walking away with no
[53:31] pain and travail mary became an object
[53:34] of ridicule
[53:35] she became an outcast and she bore that
[53:40] her whole life it never diminished it
[53:43] never went away it was never explained
[53:45] away because how are you going to
[53:48] convince someone now pardon we have
[53:50] children here so i just want to express
[53:52] this correct how are you going to claim
[53:54] or express that i now am having a child
[53:58] i have never known a man
[54:00] no one is going to accept that as an
[54:02] explanation and how would you feel as
[54:05] you have went from a charmed young lady
[54:08] into someone that is looked with
[54:09] ridicule and scorn and be able to say i
[54:12] am blessed
[54:15] but you see to bring this into our day
[54:17] because i want to keep this short not
[54:19] draw it out my brother and sister this
[54:21] that has come an angel speaking you have
[54:25] found favor
[54:26] with god
[54:28] well i tell you my brother and sister
[54:29] found it before the foundation of the
[54:31] world when he wrote my name and wrote
[54:33] your name in the lamb's book of life he
[54:35] was bestowing favor upon us he was
[54:39] pouring out blessing upon us and what we
[54:42] see and feeling here all of this today
[54:45] is the devil trying to explain it away
[54:48] trying to rob you of it trying to
[54:50] camouflage it trying to hold it hostage
[54:54] all of that is just what we see and yet
[54:56] we can look and what seems so great and
[54:59] what satan is doing
[55:01] let's go back
[55:02] to what the angel said
[55:08] without mary
[55:10] filled with the holy ghost because she
[55:12] had god in her right so we can take this
[55:14] in that natural she had the holy ghost
[55:18] john would have been born stillborn
[55:24] john would have had
[55:26] follow me
[55:28] a denominational experience
[55:30] and would have been sending all these
[55:32] people
[55:33] to the temple
[55:35] to sign up
[55:38] just like they had for generations
[55:41] a stillborn spirit
[55:46] but at the name of jesus
[55:49] at the name of jesus
[55:52] it filled him with the holy ghost right
[55:54] there in the womb
[55:56] and i want to tell you tonight saints i
[55:58] hope you catch this and correlate it my
[56:00] brother and sister that as the word come
[56:02] forth we were filled with the holy ghost
[56:05] in the womb of god's word
[56:08] we were brought to a place that we were
[56:10] now birthed as a living word in a
[56:13] generation to be expressed of the life
[56:16] of jesus christ and that word had to
[56:18] come through that name
[56:20] amen it's no other way can we come
[56:23] hallelujah so here it is we see now that
[56:26] she is troubled by the salutation but i
[56:29] want to focus tonight so i can move on
[56:31] quickly that we'll look at this and
[56:33] realize that being all of this that he
[56:36] is here in the scripture as we're
[56:38] looking in matthew to realize all of
[56:41] that is us truly finding favor with god
[56:45] just as mary did
[56:49] brother paul mary's experience was
[56:51] supernatural
[56:54] what is yours
[56:56] what is your experience if it's not
[56:58] supernatural saints we can go to any
[57:00] church in this city and get it
[57:07] hallelujah
[57:09] so we look at this and see
[57:11] blessed art thou among women sisters
[57:15] all the way from
[57:16] our children
[57:18] sisters
[57:19] blessed art thou
[57:21] among women
[57:22] we live in a world today and this might
[57:25] come across a little harsh
[57:27] women with dangling earrings and hair is
[57:29] short as mine painted up
[57:32] like a road sign
[57:34] look your face and say i have the holy
[57:36] ghost
[57:38] see how satan has convoluted this
[57:40] no reference no foundation back to word
[57:44] we're not criticizing them i hope that
[57:45] tomorrow they would wake up or maybe
[57:47] tonight when they would go to bed that
[57:49] the spirit of god would speak to them
[57:52] but remember of all the young virgins
[57:57] god chose
[57:58] mary
[58:00] god's choice
[58:05] hallelujah
[58:08] now the word said here
[58:10] that ye
[58:11] are the light of the world i want to
[58:14] drive that home to you so you'll
[58:16] understand where i'm coming from in some
[58:18] of these statements that i will make in
[58:20] a little bit ye are the light of the
[58:22] world the city that is set on a hill and
[58:24] cannot be hid
[58:26] and we see now men don't light a candle
[58:28] and put it under a bushel but on a
[58:30] candlestick and it giveth light unto all
[58:32] that are in my house that i have applied
[58:35] the token to
[58:41] you know i spoke on that the other day i
[58:43] believe there was a little
[58:44] misunderstanding by some
[58:46] you see my brother and sister we never
[58:48] stop we never stop applying the token i
[58:51] don't care if your kids are drunk i
[58:54] don't care if your kids slept with every
[58:56] human on the face of the earth
[58:58] you never stop i know that's blunt but
[59:00] we don't like to talk about that we like
[59:02] to keep everything all flowery and all
[59:05] just my brother and sister the plying of
[59:07] the token in the house starts with the
[59:09] head of the house
[59:11] and it moves down through the proper
[59:12] course
[59:14] amen we can't skip that we can't do that
[59:16] and if we don't have the house in order
[59:19] what does the word say about a minister
[59:21] his house has to be in order right we
[59:23] can't skip around that we have to get
[59:25] the house in order and i trust that we
[59:28] as priests of our home would recognize
[59:30] we have to get our house in order if we
[59:32] want god to come down here we can't be
[59:36] hypocrites
[59:38] we have to be original we have to do
[59:41] that to present that and i don't mean to
[59:43] skin no one over this but this is the
[59:44] things that the lord laid on my heart
[59:46] and so you see as we come now we apply
[59:50] this to the whole house and as we apply
[59:52] it to the house my brother and sister
[59:55] let me just use it as a simple
[59:57] paraphrase
[59:58] our children our husband our wife
[1:00:00] whatever it might be breathes the same
[1:00:03] air
[1:00:04] in that house
[1:00:07] and they dwell
[1:00:08] in the spirit
[1:00:10] of the house
[1:00:13] if this spirit's a contrary spirit then
[1:00:15] you wonder why your kids are rebellious
[1:00:17] right
[1:00:18] if we dwell in a house of a submitted
[1:00:20] spirit yielded to the holy ghost then we
[1:00:23] will see and say oh isn't god moving
[1:00:25] amongst our children if this is so
[1:00:27] beautiful you see we are the one who's
[1:00:29] setting the atmosphere and applying that
[1:00:32] so there it is now it giveth light unto
[1:00:34] all that are in the house and i tell you
[1:00:37] i'm not the best example i hate to admit
[1:00:39] that in front of you church then i've
[1:00:40] got children that could tell you stories
[1:00:42] that you guys would go oh my i don't
[1:00:44] know if i even want that guy for my
[1:00:45] pastor
[1:00:47] amen
[1:00:52] reminds me of a little prank i pulled
[1:00:54] today and i won't mention it here but
[1:00:56] it uh you know we got to be careful
[1:00:59] because sometimes the little things we
[1:01:01] do can become believable because of the
[1:01:03] actual
[1:01:04] view that we've left in people's hearts
[1:01:07] in their minds in their eyes
[1:01:12] let me move on before i get this too
[1:01:14] complicated
[1:01:17] you see
[1:01:18] we look at this and realize now is
[1:01:21] for me either that or i don't need a
[1:01:23] wagon at all
[1:01:24] hallelujah whatever it is it's god's
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:28] so the word declaring that we are the
[1:01:31] light of the world
[1:01:33] can someone say amen to that
[1:01:35] now look john one through five you're
[1:01:38] you're very familiar with this but i
[1:01:40] just wanna just lay this as a foundation
[1:01:42] we move forward
[1:01:44] hopefully a little quicker here
[1:01:46] john one through five one one through
[1:01:48] five in the beginning was the word and
[1:01:50] the word was with god and the word was
[1:01:52] god i think we all say amen we can agree
[1:01:54] with that the same was in the beginning
[1:01:56] with god all things were made by him and
[1:01:58] without him was not anything made that
[1:02:00] was made
[1:02:01] in him was life
[1:02:04] hallelujah we know the life is in him
[1:02:06] certainly not in this world
[1:02:08] and the life
[1:02:10] was the light of men
[1:02:12] so now if we are going to be that light
[1:02:15] that is lit and placed on the hill
[1:02:18] we have to have
[1:02:21] jesus christ almighty god
[1:02:23] in us
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:26] but yet there's spirits in the land
[1:02:28] today my brother and sister just as it
[1:02:30] was let me just just jump back here just
[1:02:32] as it was and and i preached this enough
[1:02:34] i think brother david's preached on it
[1:02:36] but go back in the beginning and you'll
[1:02:38] see that that the serpent depersonalized
[1:02:41] god and it went in the scripture for a
[1:02:43] brief period of time till the
[1:02:44] transgression took place
[1:02:46] that he took him from being the lord god
[1:02:49] to just god
[1:02:52] and that's what's happening in the day
[1:02:54] that we're living in
[1:02:56] people not making the connection or the
[1:02:58] correlation between the fact that who
[1:03:00] they are is because god has taken
[1:03:02] residence
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:05] now brother donnie reagan used it for
[1:03:06] talking about how a wolf would be in
[1:03:08] sheep's clothing if any of you ever
[1:03:10] actually saw him preach that and he does
[1:03:12] it so well he got that wolf there and
[1:03:14] he's just putting a leg on
[1:03:21] arm in arm in
[1:03:24] zip
[1:03:27] but a wolf has to talk like a wolf
[1:03:31] there
[1:03:34] now i want to take a little different
[1:03:36] angle
[1:03:38] if we could grasp this and i know that
[1:03:40] people would say he's lost his mind and
[1:03:42] that's cool i have
[1:03:43] and i'm so glad i've lost my mind
[1:03:49] but almighty god come down in this hour
[1:03:52] and he took you brother trevor
[1:03:55] and he put you on
[1:03:58] almighty god himself
[1:04:00] stepped right
[1:04:02] inside
[1:04:04] and said trevor
[1:04:06] as a man
[1:04:07] could never do it
[1:04:10] but me
[1:04:14] he uses it in first person i
[1:04:17] in you
[1:04:20] hallelujah
[1:04:21] all of a sudden this man we know is
[1:04:24] trevor that could if we ever buried his
[1:04:26] heart which i have had you know those
[1:04:29] experiences to have very deep
[1:04:31] conversation and i don't make light of
[1:04:33] that i believe it's just an absolute
[1:04:35] beautiful example and so in that
[1:04:38] the devil says there's trevor
[1:04:40] and god says there's me
[1:04:44] a whole different approach
[1:04:46] the devil's looking at the weakness and
[1:04:48] god says i'm looking at the vessel
[1:04:51] and the vessel is mine
[1:04:54] that's all he's looking for my brother
[1:04:56] and sister he was looking for the vessel
[1:04:58] that he could occupy
[1:05:00] so
[1:05:01] it was there in him was life and the
[1:05:04] life was the light of men
[1:05:06] and the light shineth in darkness now we
[1:05:09] could not fulfill this scripture my
[1:05:11] brother and sister unless this wicked
[1:05:14] dark world was just exactly what it is
[1:05:16] right now we could not in our day
[1:05:19] manifest this very light that god is
[1:05:22] wanting to be manifested if it wasn't a
[1:05:25] complete darkness in this world today
[1:05:28] amen so it's the life that is the light
[1:05:31] and this light is shining in darkness
[1:05:33] and the darkness out here doesn't
[1:05:34] comprehend it at all
[1:05:36] they don't get it they don't get one
[1:05:38] thing
[1:05:39] out of this they just like think you're
[1:05:40] religious that's the way they look at it
[1:05:42] you're religious you go to church they
[1:05:44] don't make a connection of the word that
[1:05:47] god said i would be walking on the war
[1:05:50] on the earth in the world in the last
[1:05:52] days showing myself
[1:05:57] oh my my brother and sister they're
[1:05:58] they're literally many people believe
[1:06:00] there's got to be as it is the same
[1:06:02] spirit muhammad's got to come back we've
[1:06:03] got to see mohammed now that spirits
[1:06:06] come over in the message and people are
[1:06:07] saying we've got to see
[1:06:10] but they fail to see
[1:06:12] the light is here
[1:06:14] it's on the hill it's shining it's being
[1:06:16] made manifest it is right here in the
[1:06:19] world we live in today
[1:06:22] amen this blessing of life that is in
[1:06:25] you
[1:06:26] can someone say amen for that this
[1:06:28] blessing of life that is in you is the
[1:06:30] very life of jesus christ manifested
[1:06:35] it's no longer on the page it is now
[1:06:38] walking on the earth once again shining
[1:06:42] the living word amen that's what the
[1:06:44] gospel is my brother and sister it's not
[1:06:47] just a dead letter it's a living word a
[1:06:49] life and the life is now shining into
[1:06:52] the world because god has come in his
[1:06:54] dwelling in you and manifested himself
[1:06:57] through you
[1:06:59] now sometimes we say kind of hard things
[1:07:01] and i don't mean to hurt anybody my
[1:07:03] brother and sister but you see we have
[1:07:05] to be careful that we don't deviate from
[1:07:08] the word amen we can't make the word
[1:07:11] more than it is we can't make it less
[1:07:13] than it is
[1:07:14] hallelujah so what is this
[1:07:18] christ in you
[1:07:20] the hope of glory
[1:07:21] right this is christ in you the
[1:07:24] manifested light
[1:07:27] this is the light for the day my brother
[1:07:28] and sister
[1:07:29] now when we get to the closing if i can
[1:07:31] make it there we'll go now in to whom
[1:07:34] would we go if they'll put that up now
[1:07:36] you can go ahead and join church it's a
[1:07:39] good thing
[1:07:40] or you can serve your creed a good thing
[1:07:43] oh and by the way for those of you that
[1:07:45] might choke on creed we actually have
[1:07:48] quite a few of them in the message
[1:07:50] because it's not all
[1:07:53] bad
[1:07:55] it's just what's outside the word
[1:07:57] the remnant
[1:07:59] of the creed is what is the problem
[1:08:04] go look it up dig deep
[1:08:08] yep you might belong to lodges you might
[1:08:12] do these these things i have nothing to
[1:08:15] say against them
[1:08:17] but what i'm trying to say this is
[1:08:19] you need light
[1:08:21] see none of the rest of this matters my
[1:08:23] brother and sister because we can go
[1:08:24] right back to john 1 and that's why we
[1:08:26] have that as a reference tonight you can
[1:08:28] go back to john 1 and realize there is
[1:08:31] the very very very fundamental of it all
[1:08:34] that god is light
[1:08:36] and so if we're going to have light in
[1:08:38] this generation to fulfill this
[1:08:39] scripture we've got to have him in us
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:44] you need light and the light is christ
[1:08:46] and he's the only one that can give
[1:08:48] light and you might turn that light on a
[1:08:51] bunch of dirt down here with ever so
[1:08:53] many grains of corn in it that light
[1:08:54] will never produce life no sir that
[1:08:57] artificial light won't produce life it
[1:09:00] takes the sunlight the rays of the
[1:09:02] sunlight you say what difference is it
[1:09:04] if it's just as light as the sun it
[1:09:06] hasn't got the power of the ray in it to
[1:09:08] bring forth life and neither has the
[1:09:11] light of any creed or anything else
[1:09:13] outside of jesus christ he's god's light
[1:09:20] beautiful huh
[1:09:22] now look i'm going to drive this home to
[1:09:24] you so there's just uh we'll we'll
[1:09:25] clinch it here in a few minutes but my
[1:09:27] brother and sister you have to have an
[1:09:29] understanding of the godhead
[1:09:31] you cannot have a convoluted
[1:09:34] a messed up kind of think i know what
[1:09:36] the godhead is to understand this
[1:09:39] because then this is where in the whole
[1:09:41] world of the trinity they get all mixed
[1:09:43] up and then you're sitting there and i
[1:09:45] like to study and look into these kind
[1:09:47] of things and you have a very well-known
[1:09:49] name in the religious world explaining
[1:09:52] the trinity and then he makes a
[1:09:54] reference to a certain uh deal and and
[1:09:56] then you know they even have a trinity
[1:09:58] institute you know and they're the ones
[1:10:00] that print the stuff and make it all
[1:10:01] very clear and got all the explanations
[1:10:03] and he's counter-addicting
[1:10:08] and then when they know they're
[1:10:09] counter-addicting they say well it's
[1:10:10] just
[1:10:11] so confusing it's really hard to explain
[1:10:15] we shouldn't have that problem
[1:10:17] amen we can go back to the word of god
[1:10:19] and god promised to reveal that word to
[1:10:21] us we shouldn't have a problem
[1:10:23] understanding the godhead
[1:10:25] amen we shouldn't have a problem trying
[1:10:27] to put this all together of who stands
[1:10:29] where and in what position this is
[1:10:32] now if you've ever seen the official
[1:10:34] circle of the trinity and i won't go
[1:10:36] into explaining it
[1:10:37] they have that you know laid down very
[1:10:39] clearly
[1:10:42] of what is and what isn't
[1:10:44] and then they used scripture to defend
[1:10:46] it but they forgot to use the scriptures
[1:10:49] that rebut it
[1:10:50] isn't that interesting when you get in a
[1:10:52] a situation like that i have all kinds
[1:10:55] of evidence
[1:10:56] what about this empirical evidence that
[1:10:58] says your evidence is wrong
[1:11:00] i get to choose the evidence it's my
[1:11:02] story
[1:11:03] you've all heard that phrase it's my
[1:11:05] story i'll tell it like i want to
[1:11:07] it's irrelevant whether truth or not is
[1:11:09] in the story it's my story so this uh in
[1:11:14] artificial light's not going to produce
[1:11:15] life it takes a real sunlight you say
[1:11:19] what difference if it's just as light it
[1:11:20] hasn't got the power of the ray in it to
[1:11:24] bring forth light now my brother and
[1:11:26] sister if you go back and study the age
[1:11:28] of the greenhouse
[1:11:32] wasn't a hundred years ago
[1:11:35] it took science
[1:11:37] delving into the right kind of light
[1:11:41] and they've done all kinds of research
[1:11:43] they literally have
[1:11:45] sequenced lights
[1:11:47] and they can study the behavior of
[1:11:50] plants
[1:11:51] you'll never eat another head of lettuce
[1:11:53] after you watch this
[1:11:55] because you can hear it
[1:11:57] and you'll think it's breathing and
[1:11:59] thinking and
[1:12:02] flowers
[1:12:04] under the emphasis of rock and roll
[1:12:06] wilt
[1:12:08] flowers with sequenced lights
[1:12:11] following
[1:12:13] the light
[1:12:14] because they want light
[1:12:17] look at the lives
[1:12:19] of men and women
[1:12:21] always seeking
[1:12:23] something
[1:12:25] to enlighten the soul
[1:12:28] always
[1:12:29] my brother and sister now this sounds a
[1:12:31] little crass forgive me
[1:12:33] but one of the original founders that
[1:12:34] was doing them squirrel suits and flying
[1:12:36] suits
[1:12:41] they asked him
[1:12:42] how could you take such a risk
[1:12:44] he he drilled his head into a rock in a
[1:12:46] canyon he no longer exists
[1:12:49] how can you take a risk and his answer
[1:12:52] was
[1:12:54] i've done everything else every
[1:12:56] thrill that there is
[1:12:59] and this is where i'm at
[1:13:02] tries to fly between two spires in a
[1:13:04] canyon and misjudges it and his life is
[1:13:06] over
[1:13:07] what was he doing
[1:13:10] looking for something
[1:13:12] i'll equate it to you tonight he was
[1:13:14] looking for light
[1:13:15] he was looking for something that would
[1:13:17] actually bring something into his soul
[1:13:19] that he would be able to declare life is
[1:13:21] fulfilled
[1:13:23] but he was unable to to bring it to that
[1:13:25] place of life is fulfilled
[1:13:28] see so it doesn't have the power of the
[1:13:29] ray no matter what we do my brother and
[1:13:31] sister doesn't have the power of the ray
[1:13:33] to bring forth light neither has the
[1:13:35] light of any creed or anything else
[1:13:37] outside of jesus christ he's god's light
[1:13:40] and he's the one that give us the holy
[1:13:42] spirit and when we live in his presence
[1:13:45] it makes us act different look different
[1:13:47] talk different be different because
[1:13:49] we're walking in the light
[1:13:52] and now earlier i made those statements
[1:13:53] about people and i i this way you know i
[1:13:56] hope you understand me it's never
[1:13:58] personal to me a god has like scorched
[1:14:00] that out of me it's never personal my
[1:14:02] brother and sister you want to see those
[1:14:04] people have a good life you want to see
[1:14:06] them know jesus christ you want to see
[1:14:08] this but you see we get to see because
[1:14:11] of what god has showed us because we're
[1:14:13] blessed to see in the word we get to see
[1:14:15] what the absence of light
[1:14:17] does to humanity
[1:14:20] and so without that light there to turn
[1:14:22] them are you with me it takes the light
[1:14:25] to turn them
[1:14:27] and without that
[1:14:29] they're walking in darkness
[1:14:31] see and we're blessed today and should
[1:14:33] be able to lift a hand in the heart and
[1:14:35] say thank you lord i am blessed i have
[1:14:37] found favor because there's something in
[1:14:40] our hearts that desires to serve god
[1:14:43] there's something in us amen as i've
[1:14:45] said before under free moral agency
[1:14:48] aren't you glad for free moral agency
[1:14:50] i'm in the house of god tonight not
[1:14:52] because i'm the speaker i'm not here
[1:14:54] tonight because i'm pastor i'm here
[1:14:57] tonight because there's something in my
[1:14:59] heart that says this is who you are
[1:15:03] and the only thirst that there can be to
[1:15:05] satisfy it is right there in the perfect
[1:15:08] word of god
[1:15:09] hallelujah amen
[1:15:12] now i want to move right on here real
[1:15:14] quick brothers let's bring up this um
[1:15:16] paragraph 20.
[1:15:18] amen
[1:15:19] now don't you see the great picture we
[1:15:22] in flesh
[1:15:24] are different
[1:15:25] now i'm not tootin no one's horn but it
[1:15:26] was sister
[1:15:28] kerry's
[1:15:29] absolute if i could just express it to
[1:15:31] you it was sister carrie in the
[1:15:33] restaurant
[1:15:34] paul
[1:15:35] i was just reading
[1:15:37] and it's like anything that generates
[1:15:39] that kind of excitement needs to be read
[1:15:42] amen
[1:15:43] hallelujah
[1:15:45] sister jerry's filled my phone up with
[1:15:47] quotes out of the oneness
[1:15:49] but it's good
[1:15:50] because i'm going to quote a couple of
[1:15:52] them to you tonight i read them already
[1:15:54] but she was excited like sister kerry to
[1:15:56] share them and that that
[1:15:58] but look at this now
[1:15:59] we in flash okay everybody reach up
[1:16:02] pinch yourself
[1:16:03] we're like a byproduct a created being
[1:16:07] by holy wedlock
[1:16:10] yeah
[1:16:11] but in this but in spirit we are sons
[1:16:14] and daughters not some other spirit but
[1:16:17] the spirit of the living god see this is
[1:16:19] what separates this old flesh and our
[1:16:22] problems we have with this old flesh
[1:16:24] amen it's what separates us my brother
[1:16:26] and sister from it controlling our life
[1:16:29] to realizing that this flesh is this
[1:16:32] flesh and it's a byproduct
[1:16:36] hallelujah
[1:16:38] amen
[1:16:40] not some other spirit the spirit of
[1:16:42] living god we're in his likeness in his
[1:16:44] unity in the perfect image of the living
[1:16:48] god because we become sons and daughters
[1:16:51] not separated but the same spirit the
[1:16:54] same god the same person joined in
[1:16:57] wedlock to the eternal
[1:17:01] see how god planned it that we should
[1:17:02] not uh we should be not a different but
[1:17:06] him
[1:17:07] amen we are not my brother and sister we
[1:17:09] say well how are we going to be like him
[1:17:11] well if god's looking on the heart what
[1:17:12] does our heart look like
[1:17:16] flesh isn't going to do it
[1:17:18] unfortunately my brother and sister i
[1:17:20] hope you can take this with little humor
[1:17:21] tonight
[1:17:22] if we're going to all look the same in
[1:17:24] the flesh which one are we going to be
[1:17:27] you all want to look like
[1:17:28] me no there's a lot of heads shaking no
[1:17:31] and some are very verbal
[1:17:34] so who do we choose
[1:17:37] but look what god's producing
[1:17:40] in the heart and soul of sons and
[1:17:41] daughters of god
[1:17:43] a perfect
[1:17:45] image of the original word
[1:17:49] being molded informed
[1:17:51] have you ever been around brother jason
[1:17:53] will you ever been around cnc machines i
[1:17:56] think whether isaac has too you can take
[1:17:58] a modern day cnc machine and you can
[1:18:01] program the computer on that and if
[1:18:03] you're cutting something out of aluminum
[1:18:05] you can feed 10
[1:18:06] 000 blocks of aluminum in that machine
[1:18:09] and every one of them will come out
[1:18:11] exactly the same and it's not the
[1:18:14] machine that's doing it
[1:18:19] the machine is only producing
[1:18:22] what was placed in it
[1:18:24] to produce
[1:18:28] so you can look at this machine and say
[1:18:30] praise god we're going to be in the
[1:18:31] perfect likeness of god no sir it's what
[1:18:34] god loaded
[1:18:35] in this right here that's going to
[1:18:37] produce that it will never be us take
[1:18:40] that program out of that cnc machine and
[1:18:43] it won't have any idea on how to produce
[1:18:46] what you wanted to produce you can take
[1:18:48] that completely over here and put it in
[1:18:50] another machine and produce exactly and
[1:18:52] my brother and sister if you can catch
[1:18:54] my thought tonight that's why you will
[1:18:56] find that this message is producing the
[1:18:58] exact same heart and desire and life all
[1:19:01] the way around the backside of the earth
[1:19:04] and no man ever produced that because
[1:19:06] it's what god loaded as it were into the
[1:19:08] hearts of sons and daughters of god that
[1:19:11] is producing that word
[1:19:13] hallelujah
[1:19:14] but not some other being of some other
[1:19:16] tribe
[1:19:19] the real union an offspring of the
[1:19:21] almighty done by the holy union now the
[1:19:24] body comes from mother and father but
[1:19:26] the spirit come from god god separating
[1:19:28] himself as adam was separated i hope you
[1:19:31] caught the essence of that
[1:19:33] amen look it's his spirit his life
[1:19:37] his light
[1:19:39] the only light we have to walk in my
[1:19:40] brother and sister is not a light of
[1:19:42] this message
[1:19:44] unless you define this message as jesus
[1:19:46] christ
[1:19:47] and when you define this message is
[1:19:49] jesus christ it takes all the little
[1:19:51] shadows and the little doubts and all
[1:19:52] the confusing things and takes them away
[1:20:01] let's go back to oneness again paragraph
[1:20:03] 171
[1:20:10] we're coming down to the end now watch
[1:20:12] god sent the holy ghost
[1:20:15] somebody read the next line for me
[1:20:25] is that not powerful
[1:20:28] does that not wipe away a few shadows
[1:20:30] that little confusion that comes
[1:20:35] got the holy ghost
[1:20:37] i can take myself right back and i hope
[1:20:39] you don't think i've stepped too far
[1:20:42] but i'm gonna go right back
[1:20:44] and i'm gonna peel back the pages as it
[1:20:46] were of john 1.
[1:20:50] come on saints
[1:20:51] and i'm going to step
[1:20:54] right into john 1
[1:20:57] and i
[1:20:58] am now
[1:21:00] the light
[1:21:01] to this world
[1:21:04] whoa you sir took a lot on yourself paul
[1:21:08] no i didn't i took the word
[1:21:10] and the word is clearly showing us that
[1:21:13] we are the light to this generation
[1:21:17] we are the light in this day god could
[1:21:20] have come put himself right back just as
[1:21:22] he did in that day if he had chose but
[1:21:25] he said i've got some people on the
[1:21:27] earth and i'm going to be inside them
[1:21:29] but oh get this now
[1:21:33] when a man and a woman are one
[1:21:35] right
[1:21:36] truly in love
[1:21:38] truly married
[1:21:40] not just as a man said once under the
[1:21:42] rules of engagement
[1:21:46] really married
[1:21:49] in other words a man scripturally
[1:21:52] is completely submitted to his wife
[1:21:55] oh no around the message we don't talk
[1:21:57] like that
[1:21:59] no sir never talk like we are fully
[1:22:01] submitted to our wife go read your bible
[1:22:04] go study the word of god
[1:22:06] husbands
[1:22:07] love your wives as christ loved the
[1:22:11] church
[1:22:12] what was it
[1:22:13] fully
[1:22:14] submitted
[1:22:18] god didn't say i'll save you up to a
[1:22:19] point
[1:22:21] i'll save you up to the philadelphia
[1:22:22] church age those of you in laodicea
[1:22:25] you're on your own
[1:22:27] no sir fully submitted
[1:22:29] to the salvation of the body that he
[1:22:32] calls bride
[1:22:34] fully submitted
[1:22:35] and the wife
[1:22:37] according to the word
[1:22:38] fully
[1:22:39] submitted to her husband
[1:22:45] remind me one time
[1:22:47] maybe i shouldn't even go there
[1:22:49] i won't go
[1:22:50] there sometimes memories are not good
[1:23:00] i'm going to tell you it's
[1:23:01] i'll tell you part of it
[1:23:03] the humorous part
[1:23:05] i knew a brother years ago just terrible
[1:23:07] the way he treated his wife
[1:23:09] just terrible he treated her even as a
[1:23:12] teenager i thought my goodness he treats
[1:23:13] her like she was a slave not a wife
[1:23:16] but i was around him long enough
[1:23:19] to see a metamorphosis taking place in
[1:23:21] this sister
[1:23:23] we're sitting in a fellowship somewhere
[1:23:25] in a table and these brothers all
[1:23:26] sprawled out i mean
[1:23:29] you can't really get up and do much
[1:23:30] after
[1:23:31] 25 000 calories
[1:23:34] and uh
[1:23:36] he'd be sitting there in the chair and
[1:23:38] he'd say
[1:23:39] wife woman
[1:23:41] get me some coffee
[1:23:45] and you used to see her she just
[1:23:51] more metamorphosis taking place
[1:23:54] she started realizing as the word was
[1:23:56] being preached
[1:23:58] she started changing she changed before
[1:24:00] he did
[1:24:02] maybe she made him change
[1:24:05] probably not
[1:24:08] it got to a point he'd be like wife
[1:24:11] woman get me some coffee
[1:24:13] and she'd be in the other room
[1:24:15] i can't hear you
[1:24:21] sounds rebellious doesn't it
[1:24:26] until one day a brother sitting at that
[1:24:27] same table says
[1:24:31] you know
[1:24:32] why don't you just get up and get your
[1:24:34] own coffee
[1:24:37] maybe brother shaming ain't bad i don't
[1:24:40] know
[1:24:41] but my point i'm saying my brother and
[1:24:43] sister
[1:24:44] the balance
[1:24:46] the balance this sister wasn't
[1:24:48] rebellious
[1:24:49] she was looking for balance she wasn't a
[1:24:51] slave she wanted to serve him
[1:24:54] and sometimes lord help us
[1:24:57] is this a confession booth
[1:25:00] sometimes we should put please
[1:25:04] but we take it for granted
[1:25:10] sometimes we just take it for granted
[1:25:13] this belongs to us
[1:25:16] when the word of god said come boldly to
[1:25:18] the throne of god
[1:25:19] god did not
[1:25:21] want us
[1:25:22] to walk up there
[1:25:24] and say lord you owe this to me
[1:25:29] he wanted us to come boldly and say lord
[1:25:32] you promised
[1:25:34] you said
[1:25:36] and i'm asking in your name and your
[1:25:38] precious name and your powerful and
[1:25:39] glorious name
[1:25:41] what a difference
[1:25:44] when this same brother before he moved
[1:25:46] away from idaho
[1:25:47] caught a revelation of that
[1:25:50] even as a teenager i marvel what a
[1:25:52] response it would be honey
[1:25:55] would you please get me a cup of coffee
[1:25:59] and i think before the words got out of
[1:26:01] his mouth because she had a discernment
[1:26:02] that after he had eaten he wanted some
[1:26:04] coffee she was right there with a cup of
[1:26:06] coffee
[1:26:09] isn't that beautiful
[1:26:11] lord help me
[1:26:14] amen
[1:26:15] you see
[1:26:16] he's the one that will make the oneness
[1:26:18] between god and man
[1:26:20] you see it's a holy ghost and you and i
[1:26:24] the light saints
[1:26:26] the light
[1:26:27] when the scripture i hope this forever
[1:26:29] changes in this positive fashion i hope
[1:26:32] this forever changes how you look at
[1:26:33] this scripture because it's no longer
[1:26:35] just us trying to follow some light
[1:26:37] moving the light is moving the gospel
[1:26:39] light is moving keep following the light
[1:26:41] we are the light
[1:26:43] it is the holy ghost god himself in you
[1:26:46] and i are the light to this world that
[1:26:50] we live in
[1:26:51] hallelujah and i'll quickly close here
[1:26:54] sister emmy will you come
[1:26:56] amen now look at this so these words i
[1:26:59] want to put out to you god is life amen
[1:27:02] god is light god is in me
[1:27:05] i have become god's light to this
[1:27:07] generation
[1:27:09] now let's turn to revelations 22
[1:27:11] brothers and we are we are closed
[1:27:13] here
[1:27:14] and behold i come quickly and my reward
[1:27:17] is with me to give every man according
[1:27:19] as his work shall be i'm alpha and omega
[1:27:22] the beginning in the end the first and
[1:27:23] the last so god is clearly in his word
[1:27:26] defining who he is in his position one
[1:27:29] of full complete control and authority
[1:27:32] there's no other above behind underneath
[1:27:35] or anything he is it
[1:27:44] highly favored
[1:27:48] highly favored are they that do his
[1:27:50] commandments
[1:27:51] some people are like
[1:27:53] i'm just
[1:27:54] under this more
[1:27:56] this is all
[1:27:58] i'm sorry you're highly favored that god
[1:28:01] placed something in you
[1:28:03] to say lord i want to live your word i
[1:28:05] want to do your word i want i want to i
[1:28:07] want to be a participant
[1:28:11] blessed are they that do his
[1:28:12] commandments that they may have right
[1:28:15] to the tree of life
[1:28:16] and may end
[1:28:18] through the gates into the city
[1:28:22] do you understand my brother and sister
[1:28:23] the difference i hope you catch this
[1:28:26] go study it out
[1:28:29] to have rights
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:34] we have it in our mind
[1:28:36] everybody comes before saint peter and
[1:28:38] he thumbs through a book
[1:28:41] looking for her name
[1:28:45] do you recognize
[1:28:46] the name
[1:28:47] oh here you are there's all kinds of
[1:28:50] jokes through the years all kinds of
[1:28:52] jokes you know people
[1:28:53] but my brother and sister it's not
[1:28:54] really that way
[1:28:57] because you see
[1:28:58] the word in us
[1:29:00] has given us full authority
[1:29:03] to the tree of life
[1:29:05] who is that what is the tree of life
[1:29:07] saints
[1:29:08] christ himself
[1:29:10] full access
[1:29:12] to our lord jesus christ
[1:29:15] and we have the right to enter into the
[1:29:17] gates of the city and it says without
[1:29:20] our dogs and sorcerers whoremongers
[1:29:21] murderers idolaters whosoever loveth and
[1:29:24] maketh a lie
[1:29:26] i jesus has sent my angel to testify
[1:29:28] unto you these things in the churches
[1:29:32] once again we're looking i want you to
[1:29:34] take this we're not going to trace it
[1:29:36] all out for you tonight i want you to
[1:29:38] take this once again god chooses to
[1:29:40] bring the word through an angel
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:49] mine angel to testify unto you these
[1:29:51] things in the churches
[1:29:53] once again restoring us back to an
[1:29:55] understanding
[1:29:56] it's all about him
[1:29:58] it's not about how big our church is not
[1:30:00] about how much money it's got not about
[1:30:02] who knows who but it's all about him i'm
[1:30:04] the root in the offspring of david the
[1:30:06] bright morning star and look we've
[1:30:08] quoted this scripture so many times my
[1:30:10] brother and sister
[1:30:11] but i want you to catch this i pray you
[1:30:13] catch this tonight
[1:30:15] and the spirit
[1:30:17] and the bride say come
[1:30:19] and let him that heareth say come and
[1:30:21] let him that is a thirst come and
[1:30:23] whosoever will let him take the water of
[1:30:25] life freely
[1:30:28] now this might come as a little jarring
[1:30:30] thing to you
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:33] the holy ghost
[1:30:36] speaking to a generation
[1:30:38] [Music]
[1:30:40] but they can't hear the truth
[1:30:42] scriptural they can't hear
[1:30:44] they can't hear that
[1:30:48] and jesus the messiah
[1:30:50] the sought after one
[1:30:53] they have words in the hebrew for that
[1:30:54] the sought after one
[1:30:57] stood right in their midst
[1:30:59] and they repudiated him and rejected him
[1:31:02] and god says you know what
[1:31:05] i could come down and i could move in
[1:31:06] the miraculous and they did in brother
[1:31:08] brown's ministry look my brother and
[1:31:09] sister there was voices that echoed in
[1:31:11] the rafters
[1:31:14] not man-made
[1:31:16] god spoke audible
[1:31:20] but do you know where really god is
[1:31:21] speaking of this generation
[1:31:24] the spirit
[1:31:27] holy ghost
[1:31:30] and this bride
[1:31:32] are they two separate
[1:31:34] no sir
[1:31:36] no there's one
[1:31:37] the spirit and the bride
[1:31:40] god using this shell as we would call it
[1:31:43] this vessel
[1:31:45] and his anointed spirit to speak through
[1:31:47] us
[1:31:48] to a world
[1:31:50] to our children
[1:31:51] to those we work with those around us
[1:31:54] you see
[1:31:56] i
[1:31:58] and you
[1:32:00] have become the light
[1:32:02] oh i'm not making a doctrine we're not
[1:32:04] going to come up with another part about
[1:32:05] how whoo look at us
[1:32:08] we're just looking at the word
[1:32:10] and if god is in me hmm they're the
[1:32:12] prophet of god that i wouldn't quote did
[1:32:14] it did it say what i thought it said
[1:32:16] or did i get confused
[1:32:18] that the holy ghost and god are one
[1:32:21] [Music]
[1:32:24] and if the holy ghost and god are one
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:28] and it's christ in you
[1:32:31] the holy ghost and god and christ
[1:32:34] obviously have to be the same i give you
[1:32:36] a quote for that if you struggle with
[1:32:38] that one
[1:32:40] you see my brother and sister this holy
[1:32:42] spirit that's speaking
[1:32:44] look how important it is
[1:32:46] look i i know this kind of comes and
[1:32:48] maybe grates on some people i'm sorry i
[1:32:50] don't mean to
[1:32:51] but there's spirits moving in the age
[1:32:53] that are trying to separate once again
[1:32:56] and put bishops
[1:32:58] over men
[1:32:59] over people
[1:33:01] over the commoner
[1:33:03] on the pew
[1:33:04] [Music]
[1:33:05] and i'm here to tell you
[1:33:07] that the only thing that will separate
[1:33:09] us
[1:33:11] is either we're light
[1:33:13] or we're not
[1:33:15] that's all that matters
[1:33:18] everyone else
[1:33:19] has to be filled with the holy ghost go
[1:33:22] look what brother branham said about
[1:33:23] mary
[1:33:25] amen
[1:33:26] she was highly favored but brother brown
[1:33:29] said she had to have the holy ghost
[1:33:31] be filled with god just like the rest of
[1:33:33] them
[1:33:34] amen no exemption because the
[1:33:36] supernatural took flicked and hurt
[1:33:38] oh praise god i don't want i preached
[1:33:40] too long amen we need a big buzzer
[1:33:43] hallelujah i don't want the distraction
[1:33:46] please don't give me one of them things
[1:33:47] up here that goes tick tick tick maybe
[1:33:50] flashing on the screen or something
[1:33:53] hallelujah
[1:33:54] you know brother david's like no no no
[1:33:57] no no
[1:33:59] no way
[1:34:01] but look at this i i just tonight i
[1:34:03] wanted to bring this to you in this
[1:34:05] fashion my brother and sister that we
[1:34:07] could just stop and recognize
[1:34:09] who we truly are in jesus christ
[1:34:13] we are not just some people trying to
[1:34:15] live a godly life
[1:34:17] we have been
[1:34:20] a completely integrated system
[1:34:25] now in the farm world my brother and
[1:34:27] sister that's a big catch word now we we
[1:34:29] need to be a fully
[1:34:30] integrated well hallelujah
[1:34:34] i am fully integrated
[1:34:37] my name was on a book
[1:34:40] i was birthed
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:43] i was brought forth into maturity
[1:34:46] that was part of it i cut out of this
[1:34:48] brother brown talking about the church
[1:34:49] coming in her maturity
[1:34:52] and in that maturity i saw who i was
[1:34:55] and in a further stage of maturity i was
[1:34:58] able to act on
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:01] who i really was
