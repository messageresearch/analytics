[25:11] but i can put all confidence in the word
[25:13] amen
[25:13] amen
[25:15] amen if you've got your confidence in
[25:16] your abilities or your
[25:18] your human element your knowledge
[25:23] it's vain it's vanity
[25:26] you weren't called
[25:29] you weren't called to bring that to
[25:30] people
[25:31] you were called to bring life
[25:34] your ministry in this earth the bride's
[25:37] ministry in this earth is to impart life
[25:39] to believers
[25:41] you know that
[25:43] that day on calvary the prophet said the
[25:45] greater works
[25:47] you do the works of god but the greater
[25:49] works was to impart life
[25:51] you can't do that through psychology
[25:56] amen
[25:57] you can't do that through a mental
[25:59] understanding
[26:02] so we need to refocus what we're here
[26:04] for
[26:07] and what we are bringing our spirit
[26:09] realm our our pastor spoke of it sunday
[26:12] the thought
[26:14] the realm of the spirit
[26:16] you have a realm of the soul the realm
[26:18] of the spirit's the second realm
[26:20] but what is controlling that second
[26:22] realm
[26:24] jesus god said cast all your burden upon
[26:27] me cast all your cares upon me for i
[26:29] care for you
[26:30] if we try to do that some other way
[26:32] we're out of order
[26:35] amen so we must understand
[26:38] what we're here for god bless you thank
[26:41] you
[26:42] amen so
[26:44] let's stand together and let's have a
[26:46] word of prayer
[26:49] i don't think we're here in vain
[26:51] we're here assembled in the name of the
[26:53] lord jesus we've got a ministry in this
[26:56] hour
[26:57] and a message in this hour which should
[26:59] be our absolute
[27:02] because the message and the word are the
[27:04] same
[27:05] we have a perfect interpretation of the
[27:07] word
[27:08] we never had a prophet whom the word
[27:10] comes to come with any other thing but
[27:12] the word of god for our day and god had
[27:15] to interpret the word for our day we'd
[27:17] never see it in this bible
[27:20] amen so we must understand
[27:23] that
[27:24] we don't use
[27:26] we aren't using a carnal
[27:32] the weapons of our warfare are not
[27:33] carnal to bring our thoughts under
[27:35] obedience we are to bring them under
[27:37] obedience to christ
[27:39] we're bringing our spirit realm under
[27:41] obedience to christ
[27:43] if we're not doing that even for others
[27:46] we're not pointing them to christ what
[27:48] are you pointing them to
[27:52] amen
[27:53] prophet said the bride of christ lives
[27:55] by the word
[27:58] amen and it lives by faith in that word
[28:01] and faith in that faith there's only one
[28:03] thing that can completely deliver we
[28:06] don't want a band-aid
[28:08] we don't want a
[28:10] a just a
[28:11] a
[28:12] relief
[28:13] we want a remedy god's given us a remedy
[28:17] we want
[28:19] complete deliverance god's given us
[28:20] deliverance so who are we pointing the
[28:23] people to
[28:24] because your soul is going to control
[28:26] your spirit
[28:28] and your spirit will control your body
[28:32] so we don't want to give something to
[28:34] the spirit just as a relief a band-aid
[28:36] we want to see deliverance
[28:38] and we are here to impart life to those
[28:40] that can believe in their soul
[28:46] amen if we try to bring our mind and our
[28:48] thoughts under obedience to anything
[28:49] else you're out of order
[28:53] amen
[28:54] that's exactly right we are to bring our
[28:57] thoughts every thought under obedience
[28:59] to christ
[29:05] all right first timothy
[29:08] let's have a word of prayer
[29:10] turn to first timothy
[29:12] let's have a word of prayer heavenly
[29:13] father
[29:15] we know that we're not in the presence
[29:18] of just feelings
[29:21] imagination reasoning memory conscience
[29:23] we're in the presence of almighty god
[29:26] we're in the presence of the king of
[29:27] kings
[29:28] and we ought to reverence him every day
[29:30] not just in church but every day we live
[29:32] it ought to be a worship and a bowing
[29:34] down
[29:36] to the absolute
[29:38] the word
[29:41] and lord we ask that you would help us
[29:43] not to give ourselves over to anything
[29:45] but the word anything else lord that
[29:47] would take its position above that word
[29:49] is idolatrous
[29:51] and father we just thank you now for
[29:53] victory over sin over the enemy we thank
[29:56] you for victory over the flesh
[30:00] and lord let us point the people to the
[30:02] victory
[30:03] over the flesh let us point the people
[30:05] to the victory that will give
[30:07] deliverance
[30:08] to the things of this of their spirit
[30:11] bondage
[30:12] lord for because we we not using lord
[30:15] the weapons of our warfare not carnal
[30:17] when we when we we fight the good fight
[30:21] or bring under obedience lord our spirit
[30:26] but bringing it under the word
[30:29] and lord jesus
[30:31] we thank you for this lord and we give
[30:33] you praise because these
[30:35] we cast down everything and even
[30:36] knowledge that would exalt itself
[30:39] against the word of god
[30:41] and lord we're we're fighting
[30:44] against the strongholds of the enemy
[30:46] and it takes the word to break it
[30:49] and we thank you father because he
[30:51] stronghold satan wants to put
[30:52] strongholds in our spirit
[30:55] but lord no other way no other thing was
[30:57] it god given and given us to do but
[30:59] bring the truth to the people
[31:03] to deliver
[31:05] now father we ask you to bring
[31:06] deliverance through your word
[31:09] as we continue on this little subject of
[31:11] in her alone lord we just ask you to
[31:14] open it up and lord have your way
[31:16] tonight i am your servant
[31:18] these lips are your lips
[31:20] my mouth is your mouth
[31:22] and lord i expect and
[31:24] do
[31:26] and will bring forth your words your
[31:29] thoughts in word for your glory and
[31:31] honor and by your power
[31:33] not by anything i can do or think or say
[31:36] but lord give revelation to your people
[31:39] give revelation to your bride let us
[31:41] walk in that faith
[31:43] because that's the only thing that's
[31:45] going to be received by god nothing else
[31:48] faith in your promise in your word in
[31:50] jesus name we pray amen
[31:53] first timothy 3
[31:55] 16.
[31:57] i want to continue with
[31:59] the subject in her alone and that's
[32:02] course the bride in her alone part two
[32:06] and god's great mystery secret
[32:08] beyond the curtain of time
[32:11] revealed it's quite a subject but i'll
[32:14] probably go beyond that subject but my
[32:16] title is in her alone i'm part two
[32:19] and
[32:21] god's great mystery seek it secret god's
[32:24] great mystery secret
[32:26] beyond the curtain of time
[32:29] has been and is being revealed to his
[32:31] bride
[32:34] and
[32:34] to do this we are not looking at the
[32:37] things that are seen we are looking at
[32:38] the unseen
[32:41] we are seeing
[32:42] what god sees
[32:45] we are seeing
[32:46] and should be seeing what god sees
[32:50] amen amen
[32:52] so we want to be careful where we're
[32:54] feeding
[32:57] if we're not feeding on the things of
[32:58] god what are you feeding on in this day
[33:01] an hour
[33:02] we're not bringing the word to the
[33:03] people what is our position
[33:06] we should be a living epistle
[33:09] known and read of all men a living
[33:11] epistle a written word made manifest in
[33:14] this hour
[33:17] people don't take the message
[33:19] serious enough
[33:20] they don't realize who's among us
[33:23] we've had we have the son of man among
[33:25] us
[33:26] and we had the son of man we saw the son
[33:28] of man manifesting itself through a son
[33:30] of man we saw the word made flesh and
[33:33] this message in this hour will bring the
[33:35] word made flesh to his bride
[33:39] and again it's the son of man revealed
[33:43] she's not another
[33:45] she is him
[33:47] so what are we bringing
[33:50] what are we doing
[33:52] bringing knowledge or bringing
[33:54] revelation to the people
[34:00] and without controversy verse 16 and
[34:02] without controversy that's argument
[34:05] great is the mystery of godliness
[34:09] god was manifested in was manifest in
[34:12] the flesh how many say amen god was
[34:14] manifest in the flesh
[34:18] and i trust by the time this service
[34:19] ends you'll see that god is
[34:21] manifested in the flesh
[34:26] and without controversy great is the
[34:28] mystery of godliness or god likeness
[34:31] being like god
[34:33] god was manifest in the flesh justified
[34:36] in the spirit that's capital s
[34:41] justified in the spirit not
[34:46] not but notice in the spirit scene of
[34:49] angels preached unto the gentiles
[34:52] believed on in the world received up
[34:57] into glory
[35:00] amen you may be seated
[35:04] i'd like you to turn with me to
[35:05] ephesians chapter one and we'll move in
[35:07] that just a moment
[35:08] ephesians chapter one
[35:14] notice brother branham i'm quoting from
[35:16] the message unveiling of god notice like
[35:18] the sculpture
[35:20] he hides
[35:22] with a mask over it
[35:24] now i want to
[35:27] i want to say this also before i go
[35:29] there
[35:30] revelation 10 7 remember what it said
[35:34] we realize that the ministry of the
[35:35] seventh angel
[35:37] which should be our ministry
[35:40] because the ministry of jesus christ and
[35:42] the ministry of the bride is the same
[35:44] ministry
[35:47] it's not another ministry so what are we
[35:49] ministering
[35:53] amen
[35:55] we need to get our focus right
[36:00] so the ministry of the bride and the
[36:01] ministry of jesus christ will be
[36:03] absolutely the same because they can't
[36:06] be different they are different
[36:08] physically but they're not different
[36:10] spiritually
[36:14] amen they are one
[36:16] all right they are the same person in
[36:19] fact it's coming right down to where
[36:21] where the bride and the groom are the
[36:23] same person
[36:25] it's the same person
[36:27] all right
[36:28] okay
[36:29] now
[36:31] revelation 10 7 said this mystery of
[36:33] revelations 10.
[36:36] there's a great mystery here that god
[36:37] kept secret in the back part of his mind
[36:39] since before the foundation of the world
[36:42] and would not have let it be revealed
[36:44] until this day
[36:46] and it was the mystery of his coming
[36:50] because there's there's a mystery that's
[36:52] been sealed in those seven seals
[36:54] and there's a mystery in every one of
[36:56] those ages
[36:58] that had been revealed but they were
[36:59] kept hid
[37:02] in fact god from the beginning of time
[37:04] in genesis he he showed it in his
[37:06] original creation what the mystery was
[37:09] and then he hid it
[37:13] amen he wouldn't let it out he wouldn't
[37:15] let it out he showed it he just
[37:17] gradually he kept showing it but it was
[37:19] hid from the people
[37:20] until this hour
[37:22] until these seals were taken off of this
[37:24] book off of the complete revelation of
[37:27] jesus christ this could not be known
[37:31] amen
[37:33] amen we got quite a message
[37:36] the devil will do everything he can to
[37:37] get you away from that message you'll
[37:39] get your focus on something else away
[37:41] from this message
[37:43] but the bride is a special called people
[37:45] who are called to a special placing and
[37:48] position
[37:49] and that position
[37:50] is
[37:51] in heavenly places in christ
[37:58] and we ought not to be flirting with
[38:00] other things
[38:02] the devil the devil will reason with you
[38:05] he'll make things look reasonable
[38:07] but god doesn't do things down your
[38:09] reasoning alley
[38:11] god does things by his word he works
[38:14] through faith in his word amen
[38:17] amen
[38:19] so
[38:21] the revelation 10 message is the seventh
[38:25] seal
[38:26] and it's the complete revelation of
[38:27] jesus christ it's a complete it's the
[38:30] mystery of his coming which lays
[38:33] in
[38:35] this book
[38:38] amen
[38:39] that has been opened
[38:43] the mystery of god mis the mystery at
[38:45] the day of the sev the day of the voice
[38:47] of the seventh angel the mystery of god
[38:50] should be finished
[38:52] that finish means completed
[38:55] and it wouldn't be until the end in fact
[38:57] the opening of that of that seventh seal
[39:00] was the sign that we have arrived the
[39:03] end is here
[39:07] and there's a mystery coming through the
[39:09] people that's not known
[39:11] the mystery we're talking about here is
[39:13] not and cannot be known
[39:15] to the public
[39:19] brother branham said and i quote this
[39:20] seventh seal
[39:22] is not to be known to the public
[39:25] until
[39:27] she leaves the bride leaves
[39:30] we've come as far as the sixth seal and
[39:31] brother brown said this seventh seal
[39:33] cannot be known to the public until that
[39:35] time what time the sixth seal opens
[39:39] and that's to israel
[39:42] and that's during the tribulation period
[39:44] she gets their message of
[39:46] his coming
[39:49] and it seals away a hundred and forty
[39:51] four thousand
[39:52] amen
[39:54] you see
[39:55] you see we we this situation this
[39:58] mystery that that the bride holds
[40:02] by revelation
[40:04] is not something you can mentally
[40:06] conceive
[40:08] you don't figure it out you don't study
[40:09] it it doesn't come that way it comes by
[40:12] revelation
[40:13] and then it lives that revelation out of
[40:15] you
[40:18] amen
[40:19] all right so
[40:21] but this mystery should be completed the
[40:23] mystery notice it's the mystery of god
[40:26] the mystery of god
[40:29] should be completed
[40:33] and it is and it will be
[40:36] the seventh seal not known to the public
[40:38] brother bram said the seventh seal is
[40:40] not known to the public what is now his
[40:43] coming and the hour of his coming is not
[40:45] known to the public
[40:47] his coming and the hour of his coming is
[40:49] not known the public because what's
[40:51] revealed is the thing jesus said i don't
[40:54] know only my father
[40:56] but when he was glorified and went up
[40:58] and the book of revelation become
[40:59] written and john wrote what he here here
[41:02] he begins to unveil that mystery
[41:05] that was a sealed mystery
[41:08] you say well it can never be known no
[41:10] yes it is brother branham said the
[41:12] christ the mystery god revealed i'm
[41:13] going to preach it and by the end of
[41:15] this sermon
[41:17] you will understand the mystery
[41:20] that i
[41:21] have been able now able to re to make
[41:24] known to you
[41:26] he said on the seventh seal he said he
[41:28] said all of you know i know what that is
[41:33] but i got to stop right here
[41:37] amen but in christ the mystery if you go
[41:39] back and look at it christ's mystery
[41:41] said how he would come would be revealed
[41:46] amen it was a secret
[41:48] but it can't be known to the public who
[41:50] is it known in her alone
[41:55] this is the thing that excites the bride
[41:58] because when they see that and realize
[42:00] that they are that predestinated seed
[42:04] for this hour and time in this complete
[42:07] revelation
[42:08] jesus christ is his the seed
[42:11] but he had to complete the revelation of
[42:14] himself
[42:15] how by becoming his bride he had to
[42:18] become bride
[42:23] there was a revealing that it was a
[42:25] revealing of himself that had to be
[42:27] known
[42:28] that was a mystery that was a secret
[42:31] but now he steps forth and makes it
[42:33] known and he comes forth in the bride
[42:36] form but it couldn't be done until the
[42:37] end of the ages
[42:40] because now this mystery can be made
[42:42] known and by making it known we come out
[42:46] of that dark denominationalism and
[42:49] fulfill the the bride coming of christ
[42:55] it's christ in bright form and that
[42:58] purpose of that is to bring us together
[43:00] as one family is to bring us together
[43:03] under the full under the under the under
[43:05] the manifestation i'm gonna get i'm
[43:07] getting ahead of myself here for sunday
[43:09] but under the manifestation because
[43:12] something had to manifest his generation
[43:20] who would make known his generation
[43:23] he was cut off from the land of living
[43:26] for the transgression of my people was
[43:27] he slain
[43:30] what for
[43:31] the seed
[43:36] all right
[43:37] now i'll believe that all right now so
[43:40] the now his coming and the hour is
[43:42] coming and not known to the public
[43:47] let me finish here now what we're
[43:48] looking into now the sculpture he hides
[43:50] with a mask over it the sculpture
[43:53] that's what god has done to this age
[43:55] it's been hid all these things has been
[43:57] hid and is supposed to be he said to the
[44:00] age but is supposed to be revealed in
[44:03] this age
[44:06] who would hold the mystery
[44:08] a prophet
[44:10] because these things could not be known
[44:12] without it coming to a prophet
[44:15] because the prophet would be the
[44:16] revealer
[44:17] god's word comes to his prophets
[44:20] so the interpretation coming through a
[44:22] prophet is not a private interpretation
[44:24] it's god's interpretation and let me go
[44:26] a little further than that every seed of
[44:28] god son of god is the interpretation of
[44:31] the word for this hour
[44:34] not the interpreter the interpretation
[44:36] of it
[44:37] see you're fulfilling prophecy
[44:40] you're fulfilling the word for this age
[44:43] amen
[44:45] all right so it's got to be manifest in
[44:48] someone
[44:53] because because this
[44:55] it had to come to a full complete
[44:57] revelation
[45:00] the
[45:01] the
[45:02] the seal had to be broken
[45:09] that was sealed
[45:11] in an earthen vessel
[45:16] the mystery was in the earth and vessel
[45:19] we find that portrayed in genesis 2.
[45:24] amen what about
[45:26] revelations
[45:31] of the revelation of jesus christ
[45:35] where
[45:36] is that
[45:38] vessel had to be broken
[45:41] and it was
[45:42] the smiting of christ was for a purpose
[45:44] brother brown masterpiece
[45:46] 1963 he said the smiting of crier 64. i
[45:49] don't remember
[45:50] the smiting of christ was for a purpose
[45:52] that he might take one
[45:54] to be his bride
[45:57] amen where was that sealed
[46:02] where was that coming from
[46:06] but he still kept it a mystery
[46:08] full mystery until the revelation of
[46:10] this seven seals he couldn't let it out
[46:14] amen but now satan can't do anything
[46:17] about it it's too late
[46:20] now these things are revealed to the
[46:22] bride
[46:24] and there's multitudes upon malta i'm
[46:26] not saying who is and who is it that
[46:27] will miss it
[46:31] they miss this revelation why they're
[46:33] not born again
[46:36] so let me continue on with this here
[46:40] i'm not saying who is and who isn't but
[46:42] there's a definite reality to the new
[46:44] birth
[46:48] he said
[46:49] and it's to be revealed these things
[46:51] have been masked over and hid now is to
[46:52] be revealed in this age he's speaking
[46:55] here in the unveiling of god
[46:58] how many know he said god has come in
[47:01] full view of you little ones
[47:06] full view
[47:07] not a partial view the full view god has
[47:10] come in full view of you
[47:12] bride
[47:15] but still hid
[47:19] one sees a man brother bam said the
[47:21] other sees god
[47:23] one saw man but the other saw the son of
[47:26] man revealing himself through a son of
[47:28] man to get into the bride himself to be
[47:31] in that form that then again would be
[47:34] what the revealing of the son of man
[47:36] what's happening today it's the
[47:38] revealing of the son of man
[47:44] amen
[47:46] all right
[47:47] so he said it's now the bible says they
[47:49] will be revealed in the latter times
[47:52] it's like a sculpture keeping his piece
[47:54] of work all covered over until the time
[47:56] he takes the mask off of it and there it
[47:58] is
[48:01] amen
[48:03] all right now that's what the bible has
[48:06] been it's been a work of god that's been
[48:08] covered up brother branham said in the
[48:10] in these seven ages he's been forming
[48:13] his bride making her
[48:17] amen the smiting of christ was for a
[48:19] purpose is that right that he may bring
[48:21] one
[48:22] a bride
[48:24] the full what full maturity full
[48:26] headship to the revelation that we're
[48:29] not two separate people the head and the
[48:32] body have become one unit
[48:35] they're no longer twain they're one
[48:40] amen
[48:43] i know these are pretty strong
[48:44] statements but this is the message
[48:47] all right
[48:48] now he said that's what the bible's been
[48:51] it's been a work of god
[48:53] it's been covered over covered up until
[48:56] it's revealed
[48:58] and god promised in this day the age of
[49:00] the will see in church he would take the
[49:02] mask off the whole thing and we could
[49:04] see it he said what a glorious thing i
[49:07] say what a glorious view
[49:11] amen it's the whole thing's removed
[49:16] and he said and it's not a partial
[49:18] revelation
[49:19] we have the complete revelation
[49:22] and everything we need to make a rapture
[49:26] is in those that have the holy ghost
[49:28] living in them because everything you
[49:30] need in this journey is in you
[49:33] so where's your confidence laying
[49:35] in theology of a man in a code of rules
[49:38] or code of ethics or in the word
[49:45] amen
[49:47] all right
[49:48] don't let sidetrack don't you let the
[49:50] devil sidetrack you let god open your
[49:52] eyes and take authority over these
[49:53] things and place the word in its
[49:55] position where it belongs
[49:58] amen
[50:00] over your life over your home over these
[50:02] things
[50:09] god in morphy you know what a morphe
[50:11] means god in morphe changes his mask
[50:15] same god
[50:17] not another one it's the same person
[50:19] there isn't two or three gods it's one
[50:21] god one person christ
[50:25] god above us
[50:26] god with us in the form of son
[50:29] god in us
[50:30] bride form
[50:34] amen
[50:36] same god
[50:38] all right he said
[50:41] oh god a morphe mask in the pillar of
[50:44] fire god and morphy in a man he see
[50:46] here's god above us god and morphy and a
[50:49] man called jesus god with us
[50:54] god and morphy and his church
[50:57] god above us
[50:59] god with us
[51:00] god in us
[51:03] the condescending
[51:06] of god
[51:08] amen
[51:09] think of it god would become that simple
[51:12] come down here
[51:14] and live in
[51:16] this old
[51:17] 70 year old lump of clay
[51:19] called
[51:20] david and reveal his name reveal his
[51:24] seed reveal himself
[51:28] showing that before the foundation of
[51:30] the world i was in the thinking of
[51:31] himself
[51:34] amen
[51:35] he said how do you know because i have a
[51:37] token that identifies itself with the
[51:39] word
[51:41] amen that's it
[51:45] the assurance the identification
[51:47] his own literal life acting out living
[51:50] out
[51:51] holding keeping us straight in the word
[51:56] amen amen amen
[51:59] all right
[52:01] god and morphy
[52:03] all right up there holy no one could
[52:05] touch him god with us are above us
[52:08] he settled upon the mountain and even an
[52:10] animal touched the mountain had to die
[52:12] and then god came down and changed his
[52:14] tent and came down and lived with us
[52:16] become one of us brother branham said
[52:19] the whole revelation
[52:21] from genesis to revelation is god
[52:23] becoming materialized
[52:26] another place he said god becoming
[52:28] tangible
[52:31] god becoming tangible god becoming among
[52:33] us
[52:35] how could he do that by the cleansing
[52:37] power of the blood which carries the
[52:39] life
[52:41] he could sanctify a people that he could
[52:43] come and live in
[52:46] and quicken that seed in the soul the
[52:48] seed is in the soul
[52:53] not in the spirit
[52:55] it's in the soul
[52:56] a person can be anointed in the spirit
[52:59] cast out devils just like judas and move
[53:01] by the power of god and work by the
[53:03] power of god and be a devil
[53:06] in his soul
[53:10] that's exactly right
[53:13] how do you know you're in god because
[53:14] this word of this hour is revealed to
[53:16] you
[53:19] you have an ear to hear what the
[53:21] spirit's saying you're not driven over
[53:23] here to one side amen
[53:25] you know what the devil did to eve he
[53:27] reasoned with her got off of that one
[53:29] word instead of accepting it he reasoned
[53:31] why god would not do what he said he
[53:33] would do
[53:34] and gave her a reason why
[53:37] and she bit off the tree of knowledge
[53:40] and people have been biting every sense
[53:42] he never asked us to figure out anything
[53:44] he asked us to take that word and accept
[53:46] it and live with it
[53:50] what are we presenting to anyone else
[53:54] we need to get our priority right what
[53:57] the bible say to do
[53:59] he said
[54:00] he said well in habakkuk
[54:04] i had that other words just search
[54:06] yourselves
[54:09] consider your ways that's it
[54:15] and then god came down and changed his
[54:17] tent
[54:19] and become one of us
[54:21] he lived with us became one of us we
[54:23] beheld him first timothy 3 16 without
[54:25] controversy great is a mystery of
[54:27] godliness for god was manifested in the
[54:29] flesh handled with hands god eat meat
[54:32] god drank water god slept god eat meats
[54:35] today god drinks water god sleeps god
[54:38] cried he was one of us beautiful typed
[54:40] in the bible that was god above us that
[54:43] was god with us now he said it's god in
[54:46] us
[54:50] no i am not
[54:52] myself
[54:53] all of god
[54:55] i'm a measure
[54:57] you're a measure
[54:59] you're a spoonful i'm a spoonful
[55:02] but without your spoonful i'm not
[55:04] complete without my spoonful you're not
[55:06] complete so god is manifested in a many
[55:09] member body which is his dwelling place
[55:12] in my father's house are many mansions
[55:14] if it were not so i would have told you
[55:16] but i go prepare a place for you and i
[55:19] will come again just what he's been
[55:21] doing just write what he's been doing
[55:23] all along he's been coming again
[55:25] receiving you unto himself by the
[55:26] revealing of the word
[55:29] the revealing of himself
[55:32] that you may be where he is
[55:35] amen
[55:37] without this
[55:38] without the bible being revealed
[55:41] without these mysteries being opened
[55:45] amen in you
[55:50] how are you going to make a rapture
[55:55] amen it's got to be opened in you
[55:57] this message just come out to flow down
[55:59] the air it's got to have somebody to
[56:01] manifest it
[56:04] it's got to be manifested
[56:08] amen you're not just some little
[56:10] something here it's jesus christ in the
[56:12] formation of the bride today
[56:15] you want the quote on that i've got it
[56:18] amen
[56:19] okay
[56:20] but that's the word
[56:22] all right so great is that mystery of
[56:24] godliness today
[56:26] for god is manifested in the flesh today
[56:31] who is god
[56:32] a book of rules and regulations
[56:36] no he's the word
[56:38] amen
[56:42] amen and the word the bible the word is
[56:45] the complete revelation of jesus christ
[56:47] and brother branham said which is his
[56:49] body

[57:27] the believer's position

[57:49] he has blessed us with all spiritual
[57:52] blessings in heavenly places in christ
[57:55] according as he has chosen us in him
[57:59] how did he choose us in him
[58:03] by foreknowledge
[58:06] first peter 1 2 said the elect according
[58:09] to foreknowledge
[58:12] amen
[58:13] there's a lot of others in the fore
[58:14] knowledge of god too that were elect but
[58:17] we're talking about the bride tonight
[58:20] you may not know that but there is
[58:23] and we're going to go into that lord
[58:24] willing sunday and monday wednesday
[58:28] all right now
[58:34] let's read recording as he had chosen us
[58:36] in him before the foundation of the
[58:38] world that we should be holy and without
[58:40] blame before him in love
[58:43] having predestinated us unto the
[58:46] adoption of children placing of children
[58:49] by jesus christ to himself according to
[58:51] the good pleasure of his will to the
[58:54] praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[58:56] he hath made us accepted
[58:59] in the beloved
[59:01] already accepted in whom we have
[59:04] redemption through the blood the
[59:05] forgiveness of sins according to the
[59:08] riches of his grace
[59:10] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[59:12] all wisdom and prudence
[59:15] having made known unto us the mystery of
[59:18] his will
[59:19] according to the good pleasure which he
[59:22] hath purposed
[59:25] in himself
[59:28] now watch this that in the dispensation
[59:31] of the fullness of times
[59:33] we have arrived
[59:35] that is our dispensation
[59:39] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[59:41] times he might gather together in one
[59:45] all things in christ both which are in
[59:48] heaven and which are on earth even in
[59:52] him
[59:53] if you hold your place there and go to
[59:55] galatians chapter 4.
[1:00:00] and let's look at something here
[1:00:04] just back a few pages here
[1:00:07] chapter four and verse
[1:00:11] five or four
[1:00:13] it also says
[1:00:14] jesus coming forth
[1:00:17] here to redeem his people he said but
[1:00:20] when the fullness of time was come
[1:00:22] notice
[1:00:26] when verse 10 it said the dispensation
[1:00:28] of the fullness of times
[1:00:31] over here it says
[1:00:33] when the fullness and when the fullness
[1:00:35] of time was come god sent forth his son
[1:00:39] made of a woman made after the law now
[1:00:42] that's exactly what we just read god
[1:00:43] with us
[1:00:46] he come through a woman
[1:00:48] so as the bride come through carriers
[1:00:51] as the life in the wheat plant she was
[1:00:53] the seed that went in the ground she's
[1:00:55] the seed here that has come out of the
[1:00:57] carrier the shack which the shuck has
[1:00:59] dried up and it's dead
[1:01:05] we don't have a shock message today
[1:01:08] we have the message of the seed this is
[1:01:10] seed time life is in the grain again
[1:01:14] what life the same life the same word
[1:01:17] the same christ the same jesus the
[1:01:19] revealed word in the bride form
[1:01:25] amen
[1:01:26] life is in the grain
[1:01:31] what is the word life
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:35] life and death are coming to their final
[1:01:37] struggle too
[1:01:39] amen that's right
[1:01:41] all right but you see the fullness of
[1:01:43] time now we have come here to the
[1:01:45] fullness of times what is it now god's
[1:01:47] here in another form not another person
[1:01:50] the same person brother branham said not
[1:01:52] another person not a third person god in
[1:01:55] us not a third person the same person
[1:02:01] amen
[1:02:02] all right
[1:02:03] now
[1:02:06] so we see then in verse if we go further
[1:02:09] here
[1:02:12] okay i just think i'll stop right there
[1:02:15] now the new birth
[1:02:18] let's read you know colossians just a
[1:02:20] moment colossians 1.
[1:02:27] 127 very familiar scripture 127-28
[1:02:30] to whom god even the mystery which god
[1:02:33] has been hid from ages and from
[1:02:35] generations
[1:02:36] now we're talking about a mystery we're
[1:02:38] talking about a secret that god has hid
[1:02:44] that hath been hid from ages and from
[1:02:46] generations but now
[1:02:48] is made manifest to his saints
[1:02:51] to whom now see
[1:02:53] they saw that mystery revealed
[1:02:56] they saw god come down in
[1:02:58] human form they saw him step forth and
[1:03:02] paul catching the further revelation
[1:03:03] knew that that god was in him
[1:03:06] that's the origin that's original faith
[1:03:08] that's the faith of the fathers
[1:03:11] amen
[1:03:13] all right he said now but
[1:03:15] he said even the mystery which had been
[1:03:17] hid from ages and from from ages past
[1:03:20] and their ages in time
[1:03:22] because even paul said i could speak of
[1:03:24] bear rack and
[1:03:25] jephthy and samson and all these and he
[1:03:28] said go on down who the world's not
[1:03:29] worthy and he said and without us
[1:03:34] paul's saying without us they can't be
[1:03:36] made perfect now we're standing here in
[1:03:37] this age and saying without us they
[1:03:39] can't be made perfect in fact the whole
[1:03:42] perfection of perfection came in this
[1:03:44] day
[1:03:47] and paul was looking for that to come
[1:03:49] peter the prophets were looking for this
[1:03:51] day that when perfection of the
[1:03:53] perfection of himself they knew
[1:03:55] something more was coming they didn't
[1:03:57] have revelation the book of revelations
[1:03:59] written at that time but we have the
[1:04:01] book of revelations we have a little
[1:04:03] book called the book the revelation of
[1:04:05] jesus christ
[1:04:08] and he had that book in his hand
[1:04:12] in revelation 10 2
[1:04:13] and it was a sealed book
[1:04:19] not anymore
[1:04:23] there's a mystery revealed here
[1:04:27] all right
[1:04:30] the new birth
[1:04:34] the new birth
[1:04:36] is christ
[1:04:39] is a revelation
[1:04:43] god has revealed to you this great
[1:04:45] mystery it isn't because you shouted it
[1:04:48] isn't because you cast out devils a
[1:04:50] devil can you the holy spirit can use
[1:04:53] that devil to do that did you know that
[1:04:55] he did judas
[1:04:58] judas by the holy spirit cast out devil
[1:05:01] now say that isn't right
[1:05:06] anointed to do it brother brown said the
[1:05:08] same anointing he said the holy spirit
[1:05:10] can anoint your spirit
[1:05:12] to do those works and be as smutty as
[1:05:14] black as dark in your soul
[1:05:19] amen see that's one of the mysteries
[1:05:21] that had to be opened in this day
[1:05:27] but that holy ghost ever falls upon a
[1:05:29] predestinated seed that's been planted
[1:05:31] by predestination and that soul falls on
[1:05:33] good ground it's going to bring forth a
[1:05:34] hundredfold and fiftyfold and thirtyfold
[1:05:37] amen it's gonna do it
[1:05:41] and it'll recognize the word for their
[1:05:43] dour and time
[1:05:45] and it won't feed on any nonsense of the
[1:05:47] world
[1:05:52] because they recognize their position an
[1:05:54] hour
[1:05:57] listen
[1:06:00] i'm not going to pet that devil
[1:06:05] amen
[1:06:06] he's always been reasoning against the
[1:06:08] word and any and knowledge against the
[1:06:09] word
[1:06:10] and his ways are against the word and
[1:06:12] ever so subtle but looks so reasonable
[1:06:14] and beautiful
[1:06:16] but notice his altar of worship was
[1:06:19] refused
[1:06:22] cain was refused
[1:06:24] and cain was wroth
[1:06:25] with god
[1:06:27] he said who do you think you are a
[1:06:28] little two bit by two by four brother of
[1:06:31] mine i'm the firstborn
[1:06:33] so he thought
[1:06:34] but he wasn't the firstborn of abel or
[1:06:36] adam
[1:06:38] amen is that right
[1:06:40] but i'm firstborn i come through the
[1:06:42] same mother you come from
[1:06:47] hello that's what they say today i got
[1:06:49] the same mother
[1:06:50] you know my pentecost is my mother
[1:06:55] but that old pentecost went off to
[1:06:57] denomination as a shock
[1:06:59] and the real pentecost which is the
[1:07:01] baptism of the holy ghost upon a word
[1:07:03] seed and that soul is the new birth
[1:07:06] and that's a divine revelation and that
[1:07:09] will continue right on into the
[1:07:11] revelation of the word of this hour
[1:07:14] and if you can't discern what you're
[1:07:16] doing that's off the word then you need
[1:07:17] the holy ghost
[1:07:22] the holy ghost isn't going to turn away
[1:07:23] from this word
[1:07:25] it's not going to try to do something
[1:07:27] contrary to the word
[1:07:30] i don't care how nice the knowledge
[1:07:32] looks
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:37] now
[1:07:39] check it with a word the problem is we
[1:07:40] aren't going back to the word
[1:07:43] and why not you say it's right before me
[1:07:45] why can't you see that then why can't
[1:07:46] you discern it
[1:07:50] the holy ghost in you will be a
[1:07:52] discerner of those spirits i don't care
[1:07:54] how close they are they're not going to
[1:07:56] be able to seduce they would try to
[1:07:58] seduce the bride if it was possible but
[1:08:00] that's not possible
[1:08:06] amen
[1:08:10] quit your flirting with the other man
[1:08:14] brother brahm said you if you come with
[1:08:16] any kind of reasoning contrary to god's
[1:08:19] word you're flirting with another man
[1:08:21] your flirt no he said you're flirting
[1:08:22] with the devil
[1:08:24] amen third seal you'll see
[1:08:30] you're trying to use something that god
[1:08:31] hasn't provided to bring deliverance to
[1:08:33] spirit
[1:08:37] to that spirit realm i'm talking about
[1:08:38] the holy spirit i'm talking about your
[1:08:40] spirit realm
[1:08:42] bondage is not delivered all you're
[1:08:44] doing is bringing a little feeling but
[1:08:46] you're not bringing the word for
[1:08:47] deliverance
[1:08:56] all right
[1:09:02] brother brown here here's the new birth
[1:09:03] christ in revelation god has revealed to
[1:09:05] you this great mystery amen
[1:09:09] god has revealed to you this great
[1:09:11] mystery and that's the new birth what
[1:09:13] are we what are you going to do when you
[1:09:15] get all that group together
[1:09:18] where the revelation is perfectly in
[1:09:20] harmony and god expressing it through
[1:09:22] his word through his word through his
[1:09:25] word by the same actions the same things
[1:09:27] he did he did making the word manifest
[1:09:31] or if the church only knew its position
[1:09:35] brother baum said i've introduced you to
[1:09:37] him oh he said if the church could only
[1:09:39] get her positive position
[1:09:43] another place positive position
[1:09:49] or if the church only knew its position
[1:09:51] it will one day
[1:09:54] then the rapture will go when it knows
[1:09:57] what it is
[1:10:00] amen when it knows what it is
[1:10:05] where's the thing you're using leading
[1:10:07] you down
[1:10:08] what trail what what what way is it
[1:10:10] going here
[1:10:13] what's the fruit of it
[1:10:22] but the revelation
[1:10:24] come through the blood
[1:10:26] see through jesus christ who is the
[1:10:29] blood of god created blood in the womb
[1:10:31] of mary and paul knew him by revelation
[1:10:34] that's how we know him today the only
[1:10:36] way you know him is by revelation
[1:10:39] that god has revealed the word to you it
[1:10:41] is the word it is he is the word and the
[1:10:45] word how
[1:10:46] how you know it's revealed it lives it
[1:10:49] and expresses itself through you
[1:10:52] that word does
[1:10:58] the only way you're saved
[1:11:02] is
[1:11:03] by revelation
[1:11:05] the only way you're saved is know him
[1:11:09] know him
[1:11:11] by revelation
[1:11:14] only way
[1:11:30] is by revelation his church
[1:11:32] is
[1:11:34] himself
[1:11:36] revealed
[1:11:39] his church is himself
[1:11:44] revealed
[1:11:45] do you see it and expressed by the word
[1:11:48] itself
[1:11:50] and expressed by the word itself that he
[1:11:52] is god
[1:11:56] these who are the royal seed are the
[1:11:58] elect of god these who are the royal
[1:12:00] seed are the elect of god are they
[1:12:03] predestinated for known of god and we're
[1:12:06] in the mind of god and his thoughts
[1:12:11] in very plain language the true bride of
[1:12:13] christ was in the mind of god eternally
[1:12:17] though not expressed until each came
[1:12:19] forth in the decreed in their designated
[1:12:22] decreed season
[1:12:24] they couldn't be expressed but they were
[1:12:26] the word they were in the word they were
[1:12:28] a part of eternal life they were in the
[1:12:30] word himself but not expressed
[1:12:33] other words they're a thought what is a
[1:12:35] word it's a thought expressed but not
[1:12:37] expressed until their designated decreed
[1:12:40] season this is your designated season
[1:12:48] this is your decreed season
[1:12:56] as each member came forth it became
[1:12:58] expressed and took its place
[1:13:01] in the body remember the body is himself
[1:13:04] revealed the body is the word revealed
[1:13:07] do you think that body then is going to
[1:13:09] express him and then leave off a little
[1:13:11] part and just take everything else but
[1:13:13] one little section and go out there
[1:13:15] contrary to the word
[1:13:35] thus this bride
[1:13:38] is the literal
[1:13:40] spoken
[1:13:41] word
[1:13:43] seed
[1:13:44] bride
[1:13:46] this bride the spoken word is the
[1:13:49] original seed this bride is the original
[1:13:52] seed it's the spoken word bride
[1:14:00] and though she is feminine in
[1:14:02] designation brother paul brought that
[1:14:03] out here i think it was last sunday or
[1:14:04] sunday before or something wednesday
[1:14:07] though she is feminine in designation
[1:14:09] she is also called the body of christ
[1:14:14] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:14:17] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:14:19] him
[1:14:21] and she came from the same source
[1:14:25] every seed shall bring forth of its kind
[1:14:29] the only way that that seed can come and
[1:14:32] be manifest jesus christ it had to come
[1:14:34] from the source he came from
[1:14:40] you come from the same source was
[1:14:42] eternal with him
[1:14:45] and now manifesting god and now you're
[1:14:48] manifesting god or the bride is
[1:14:50] manifesting god in a many many membered
[1:14:54] body whereas once god was manifested in
[1:14:56] one member even our lord jesus christ
[1:15:00] amen
[1:15:02] now i i just to save time
[1:15:13] abraham or excuse me adam
[1:15:18] there was a sealed mystery in himself
[1:15:21] god expressing himself because the image
[1:15:23] of god was male and female
[1:15:26] the image of god was man which was male
[1:15:28] and female when god when jesus christ
[1:15:30] went to calvary on the cross he was both
[1:15:32] masculine and feminine
[1:15:36] then what was it that he was smitten for
[1:15:38] that she that the she that is in him
[1:15:42] amen
[1:15:44] that same life would produce itself in a
[1:15:47] bright form
[1:15:48] which would be him it's not another it's
[1:15:51] him
[1:15:54] eve was him mrs adam was expressing mr
[1:15:58] adam mrs adam was revealing mr adam
[1:16:02] in another form
[1:16:06] that was the culmination that was the
[1:16:08] capping of creation that was the
[1:16:10] capstone of god of god's work and
[1:16:14] creative act
[1:16:16] when he brought man was both male and
[1:16:18] female and then took out of that man
[1:16:22] the mystery
[1:16:23] of adam
[1:16:25] mrs adam was the mystery of mr adam
[1:16:28] revealed
[1:16:30] so is it today
[1:16:33] we can't fall because he didn't fail
[1:16:36] that first adam fell
[1:16:38] this second adam won't fall
[1:16:40] and therefore we can't fail being in him
[1:16:43] and a part of him always were in eternal
[1:16:45] life we never were a part of eternal
[1:16:47] life and then taken out of eternal life
[1:16:49] we'll get into that more on sunday
[1:16:54] there's a reason for that you say well
[1:16:56] how can some have eternal life and then
[1:16:58] be re well how can some excuse me be in
[1:17:00] the book of life written and then
[1:17:02] removed their name removed
[1:17:04] the mystery isn't it
[1:17:09] lord willing i want to get there
[1:17:13] that's something had been in my heart
[1:17:14] probably four years or better
[1:17:16] so we'll just see how the lord i would
[1:17:18] desire you pray for me
[1:17:22] upon this rock of revelation of who
[1:17:24] jesus christ is he's the full he is the
[1:17:27] full manifested god
[1:17:31] upon this rock
[1:17:32] revelation i'll build my church and the
[1:17:34] gates of hell shall never shake it down
[1:17:37] never prevail against it you think about
[1:17:40] those in ukraine
[1:17:42] psalm 91 said the thousands shall fallen
[1:17:44] i forget the left to right hand and ten
[1:17:46] thousand on the other but it shall not
[1:17:48] come nigh them
[1:17:51] just think about that there's nothing
[1:17:53] there's no devils in hell can take the
[1:17:55] bride out of her position
[1:17:59] nothing
[1:18:00] the war should rise against me psalm 27
[1:18:03] and this will i be confident
[1:18:05] one thing i've desired see
[1:18:07] the war should rise against me
[1:18:10] what does that mean anything to the
[1:18:11] bride
[1:18:12] just start rejoicing anyway say well we
[1:18:15] don't have food and water well are you
[1:18:17] limiting the creator that created your
[1:18:19] body to provide food and water
[1:18:23] you say you're not in it no but i pray
[1:18:26] that god's grace and mercy by the
[1:18:28] revealing of that word would place us
[1:18:30] right if we have to be put in it
[1:18:33] we know the bride's going is very close
[1:18:38] amen
[1:18:40] then let's get down to business with
[1:18:42] this word this book and start eating the
[1:18:44] book if you want to study something
[1:18:46] starting the book start eating the book
[1:18:51] quit running from the presents and run
[1:18:53] into the presence of god
[1:19:00] start eating
[1:19:01] the open word

[1:19:07] was told by the angel take the book
[1:19:09] the little book
[1:19:11] and eat it up take that bride book take
[1:19:14] that take that marriage certificate take
[1:19:16] that word that full revelation of myself
[1:19:20] which you are john
[1:19:23] john heard it thunder he knew what it
[1:19:25] said
[1:19:27] amen
[1:19:29] oh you say well the seven things seventh
[1:19:30] seal will never be known i beg your
[1:19:32] pardon john knew what it said
[1:19:34] it was revealed in those seven thunders
[1:19:37] and the brother brown said it's the
[1:19:39] thing that jesus said no man but the
[1:19:41] father knew
[1:19:43] that's his coming he said so see
[1:19:45] those seven thunders hold that mystery
[1:19:49] and it's connected together
[1:19:52] amen
[1:19:53] all right
[1:19:55] now
[1:19:57] so why do you put so much emphasis on
[1:19:58] that because that's our time
[1:20:01] that's where we're at the seed again the
[1:20:04] seed again
[1:20:11] it's jesus christ again
[1:20:13] do we recognize i don't think people
[1:20:16] i know there's not many recognize that
[1:20:20] they'd be more serious about what
[1:20:22] they're
[1:20:23] believing
[1:20:25] amen
[1:20:29] okay i know i've got to hurry i want to
[1:20:31] get to a spot here
[1:20:33] i'm not going to make it and everything
[1:20:36] look
[1:20:37] christ in you
[1:20:38] makes him the center of life of that
[1:20:41] revelation
[1:20:45] amen
[1:20:47] he said see christ's life in you makes
[1:20:49] him the center of that revelation he's
[1:20:52] the center is he the center
[1:20:54] everything will revolve around the
[1:20:56] center everything the wheel outside
[1:20:58] wheel will revolve around the little
[1:20:59] wheel
[1:21:01] so if you see your life revolving around
[1:21:03] a little wheel and it happens to be the
[1:21:05] word what's taking you away from it then
[1:21:13] because you if that word's down in your
[1:21:15] soul it's going to hold you
[1:21:18] straight and it's going to reveal to
[1:21:19] your air and you're going to make it
[1:21:21] right and you'll lose your fear of what
[1:21:23] anybody else thinks and bring these
[1:21:26] things under headship
[1:21:30] amen
[1:21:34] all right now
[1:21:37] so christ in the bible makes the bible
[1:21:39] what
[1:21:40] the complete revelation of christ
[1:21:44] is that right
[1:21:46] christ in the bible would make the bible
[1:21:47] the complete revelation of christ
[1:21:51] and that's his body
[1:21:54] okay christ in you
[1:21:58] i didn't read colossians 1 27 to whom
[1:22:00] god would make known this mystery
[1:22:03] but is now made manifest to his saints
[1:22:05] how god what god to whom god would make
[1:22:08] known what is the riches of the myth
[1:22:10] glory of this mystery among the gentiles
[1:22:12] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:22:14] whom we preach
[1:22:19] amen warning every man and teaching
[1:22:21] every man and all wisdom that we may
[1:22:23] present every man perfect in christ
[1:22:26] jesus you can't do that without the
[1:22:29] revelation of the word of this hour
[1:22:34] we're preaching
[1:22:36] to others to the little bride you're
[1:22:38] perfect in christ
[1:22:41] the devil said oh you can't be perfect
[1:22:43] he's not pointing to the right correct
[1:22:44] side
[1:22:47] he'll take you away from the revelation
[1:22:49] in your soul and give you something to
[1:22:51] reason over
[1:22:53] make it feel good we don't believe in a
[1:22:55] feel-good religion
[1:22:56] quit petting the devil
[1:22:59] we've got to go through struggles and
[1:23:00] trials we have to go through testings
[1:23:02] but there's only one thing that's going
[1:23:04] to deliver you from that stronghold and
[1:23:06] that's the word of god not a carnal
[1:23:09] warfare
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:14] casting down strongholds how you going
[1:23:16] to cast them down
[1:23:18] by the way the word said to do it then
[1:23:20] why are you trying to do it another way
[1:23:27] you say brother david
[1:23:30] would you preach like that
[1:23:32] i would certainly preach like this
[1:23:34] because it's not david
[1:23:42] amen
[1:23:43] abel just simply come up by revelation
[1:23:45] and offered the lamb
[1:23:47] don't you see brother how much i've
[1:23:48] labored and how much i brought and how
[1:23:50] much beautiful this altar and this
[1:23:52] church is i put all this time in it i've
[1:23:55] grown the plants and and i've grown
[1:23:56] these things and i've labored and i've
[1:23:58] labored and i've worked and i've worked
[1:23:59] and here you come along and just by you
[1:24:02] say oh by revelation you had and brought
[1:24:04] the lamb and put a few stones together
[1:24:06] and laid him on it and gave the life
[1:24:08] god accepted it
[1:24:12] by revelation
[1:24:15] don't you see how hard i've worked and
[1:24:18] how much i've studied and how much i've
[1:24:20] done to learn this you don't learn the
[1:24:22] word of god it's revealed to you
[1:24:30] and turn right around there and and and
[1:24:33] roth and jealous because his brother was
[1:24:35] accepted and god said you'll do good if
[1:24:37] you just do what your brother does i'll
[1:24:39] receive you could he do it no why
[1:24:42] wrong seed
[1:24:45] wouldn't receive the word it was all by
[1:24:47] works it was a works it was a knowledge
[1:24:49] affair the devil's been good at that
[1:24:51] ever since he got eve over
[1:24:55] amen
[1:24:57] god hasn't asked us to do any of those
[1:24:59] things what he asked you to do was
[1:25:01] believe what he said
[1:25:03] and spread the gospel
[1:25:10] all right
[1:25:14] amen

[1:26:31] word had to be opened

[1:26:41] he was a living god
[1:26:43] that god had to be opened he had to open
[1:26:45] himself
[1:26:46] in order for the bride to be manifested

[1:27:27] what are you seeing
[1:27:30] the son of man revealed again

[1:27:35] mistakes and your heirs

[1:27:40] way

[1:27:49] has to be on display
[1:27:51] you can't do that through your
[1:27:52] intellects
[1:27:54] you can't do that through your works
[1:27:56] you can't do that by pumping up and
[1:27:58] pressing in and studying something you
[1:28:00] can't do it that way
[1:28:03] it's sovereignly and divinely given to
[1:28:05] you by grace
[1:28:09] amen
[1:28:10] if there's that in your heart to receive
[1:28:13] it

[1:28:33] so but what is the bride not a creed or
[1:28:36] denomination
[1:28:39] not a living but a living oracle of god
[1:28:41] a living attribute of god displaying to
[1:28:44] the world the attributes of god
[1:28:46] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:28:48] of god in the formation of the bride

[1:29:26] inside of that flesh man is a man called
[1:29:28] spirit
[1:29:30] amen
[1:29:32] inside of that spirit is a is a realm
[1:29:35] called the soul
[1:29:40] and that soul if it's not the word it
[1:29:42] never will be
[1:29:45] amen god had to be had
[1:29:48] god had to place that there
[1:29:51] the word's not there
[1:29:55] you may do all kinds of signs and
[1:29:57] miracles
[1:29:58] and you'll lean towards your knowledge
[1:30:00] but you'll never get a true revelation
[1:30:02] of the word for the hour
[1:30:08] you see we don't like the way you preach
[1:30:10] it's okay
[1:30:12] you don't have to like the way i preach
[1:30:16] i'm going to tell you the truth
[1:30:17] regardless

[1:30:33] i planted it i put their names on the
[1:30:35] book before the foundation of the world
[1:30:37] by predestination i'll water it
[1:30:40] and just keep moving i'll furnish the
[1:30:42] water you keep moving i'll you just
[1:30:44] spray it out
[1:30:48] i'll water it day and night unless one
[1:30:49] of them gets plucked out of my hand
[1:30:51] there you are
[1:30:54] i believe god has to plant the word
[1:30:58] amen
[1:31:01] the bride is part of her husband the
[1:31:03] church is a part of the word the
[1:31:04] manifest
[1:31:06] the manifestation god's manifested word
[1:31:09] of god today is his bride he that
[1:31:11] believeth in me not believe believe on
[1:31:13] me but believeth in me the works that i
[1:31:15] do shall he do also
[1:31:17] why it's his life it's his dynamics in
[1:31:20] his mechanics that's in you fires it off
[1:31:24] see the mechanics is the word see i
[1:31:26] believe the word i believe the word
[1:31:27] where's the dynamics to fire the word

[1:31:31] then live the word for another day
[1:31:35] oh you're going to live if that seeds
[1:31:36] here you're going to live the word for
[1:31:37] this day
[1:31:39] it's got to
[1:31:44] amen
[1:31:45] your spiritual your physical contacts
[1:31:47] the spirit physical your spiritual
[1:31:50] contacts are spiritual
[1:31:52] your spiritual realm your spirit realm
[1:31:54] has five senses imagination memory
[1:31:57] reason conscience and memory
[1:31:59] and imagination is that right
[1:32:03] contacts the spiritual
[1:32:05] there's only one thing that contacts the
[1:32:07] spiritual in your soul
[1:32:09] it's either god or satan
[1:32:11] and if it's of god there's only one
[1:32:13] thing
[1:32:15] that's faith
[1:32:17] in that word
[1:32:22] amen
[1:32:23] all right
[1:32:27] and if that
[1:32:28] spirit's not controlled by the word
[1:32:31] it won't last it won't do it it won't do
[1:32:33] a big good
[1:32:35] because you're going to do what's in
[1:32:36] your soul regardless of what that spirit
[1:32:39] whatever that spirit does it can be
[1:32:40] anointed to do it
[1:32:42] but unless that soul is right with the
[1:32:44] word you'll always come back to what
[1:32:45] that soul is because who you really are
[1:32:48] is your soul
[1:32:50] that's who you are
[1:32:53] amen
[1:32:54] amen
[1:32:56] all right
[1:32:57] so your spiritual context is spiritual
[1:32:58] but the inside of that spiritual you've
[1:33:01] got a soul and that soul is the gene
[1:33:03] that come from god
[1:33:06] amen
[1:33:08] there you are
[1:33:11] gene is a part of generations
[1:33:14] all right
[1:33:15] now i gotta i'm trying to rush through
[1:33:17] this
[1:33:18] because i gotta quit
[1:33:26] now when we see god makes his promise
[1:33:28] live before us and see what it's what it
[1:33:31] is in us his spirit is living in us
[1:33:34] this spirit is living in us that is the
[1:33:37] only way to worship and that's the only
[1:33:39] place of worship
[1:33:45] you try to bring any other means to
[1:33:48] relieve the cares or release the cares
[1:33:50] of an individual outside of this word
[1:33:52] you're contrary to the word
[1:33:55] you're working against the word
[1:34:01] amen
[1:34:02] because he already said
[1:34:04] he's the one that you cast your cares on
[1:34:08] amen
[1:34:10] all right
[1:34:13] okay
[1:34:15] the invisible union of the bride of
[1:34:17] christ if you're married to christ
[1:34:19] christ is the word of god
[1:34:24] any son
[1:34:25] natural son is the attribute of his
[1:34:27] father and just as you were the genes of
[1:34:30] your father in the body of your father
[1:34:32] when he was a young boy
[1:34:34] you were in him
[1:34:36] yet he could not have fellowship with
[1:34:38] you because he didn't know you but then
[1:34:41] through the betting grounds
[1:34:43] of a church of the church spiritually
[1:34:45] i'm thinking of but the betting grounds
[1:34:47] of your mother natural you were brought
[1:34:49] into the earth and become in the image
[1:34:51] of your father then he could fellowship
[1:34:54] with you
[1:34:56] so were you sons of god and daughters of
[1:34:59] god
[1:35:01] before there was even a moon stars or a
[1:35:03] molecule you were sons and daughters of
[1:35:06] god you were you are the only you are
[1:35:10] for you are only
[1:35:12] the physical manifestation of the
[1:35:14] attributes that was in god in the
[1:35:17] beginning
[1:35:19] for there's only one form of eternal
[1:35:21] life and that was you
[1:35:25] why because you were in eternal life you
[1:35:28] if i'm in my father
[1:35:30] then i come in the form image of my
[1:35:31] father but you're in your father god
[1:35:34] then there's only one form of eternal
[1:35:36] life we know that's god and if there's
[1:35:37] only one form of eternal life that was
[1:35:39] you
[1:35:42] okay before
[1:35:44] you don't know nothing about it neither
[1:35:46] did you know when he was in your earthly
[1:35:48] father but you are manifested in his
[1:35:51] image in the image of god you were made
[1:35:53] and you were manifested for the glory
[1:35:55] and fellowship of god and therefore as
[1:35:57] sure as your gene had to be in your
[1:36:00] father before your natural birth your
[1:36:03] spiritual gene had to be in god because
[1:36:06] your expression of the attributes of his
[1:36:08] thoughts do you realize your have
[1:36:10] thoughts expressed today
[1:36:16] when he when he showed when when
[1:36:19] melchizedek met abraham you were in him
[1:36:21] right there
[1:36:24] when the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:36:26] among us in the beginning was the word
[1:36:27] and the word is with god you were there
[1:36:32] the only thing you did is personally
[1:36:33] bypass that theophany but you were in
[1:36:35] that theophany you were in melchizedek
[1:36:38] when he appeared abraham
[1:36:40] because everything you are was in christ
[1:36:42] and all that you are is him and all that
[1:36:44] he all that you are is him and all that
[1:36:46] he is you are
[1:36:49] that's a brother brah made that
[1:36:51] statement unveiling of god
[1:36:55] i was there when moses did this i was
[1:36:58] there when jesus i was there when
[1:37:00] melchizedek made abraham i was there if
[1:37:03] levi was there
[1:37:05] paying tithes where was i
[1:37:10] where were you
[1:37:13] amen
[1:37:16] and he was in the loins of abraham when
[1:37:19] melchizedek met him you being a part of
[1:37:21] god before the foundation of the world
[1:37:23] when god became a man stepped forth in a
[1:37:26] theophany you were there in that right
[1:37:28] there
[1:37:31] and now in this day the word's been
[1:37:33] opened up and you've heard from your
[1:37:34] theophany
[1:37:36] and you're about ready to go into it
[1:37:39] at least i am
[1:37:41] and maybe one of you others may leave
[1:37:43] before i do
[1:37:45] we don't know do we
[1:37:49] let's be prepared
[1:37:52] what if a man gains a whole world and
[1:37:53] loses his soul what does it profit him
[1:37:58] amen
[1:38:02] let's make sure that our desires and our
[1:38:04] ambitions are centered on the word
[1:38:08] our focus is on the word
[1:38:11] and we're bringing forth the fruit
[1:38:14] of the word
[1:38:16] amen
[1:38:17] that's exactly right you're a branch
[1:38:20] he's the vine you bear the fruit of the
[1:38:22] vine
[1:38:23] now if what you're bearing and what
[1:38:25] you're doing isn't bearing that fruit
[1:38:27] because that vine is a certain
[1:38:30] quality
[1:38:32] if it isn't doing it i'd say i'd run
[1:38:34] away from it as fast as you can
[1:38:37] amen
[1:38:38] all right move right down here and i'll
[1:38:40] close here just a second
[1:38:43] well not a second but
[1:38:45] two or three minutes

[1:38:50] its kind amen
[1:38:56] amen the church bride

[1:39:07] right now that that headstone that
[1:39:09] capstone this message brother braham

[1:39:14] it caps the whole thing off he said
[1:39:16] we've we've come to the place he said
[1:39:18] where bride and and the head have become
[1:39:20] one he's uniting with his body
[1:39:23] they are becoming one

[1:39:40] seed of the word
[1:39:43] god will present christ a beloved bride
[1:39:46] a virgin of his word
[1:39:49] you know who the bride is she's a virgin

[1:40:04] manifest who is she jesus christ the
[1:40:07] same yesterday
[1:40:08] and today and forever

[1:40:15] if you're doing what you're doing
[1:40:24] all right
[1:40:28] through them he's a virgin they're a
[1:40:30] virgin of his word and through them and
[1:40:32] by them will be fulfilled all that has
[1:40:34] been promised for his word in the virgin
[1:40:37] who knows no man made creeds or dogmas
[1:40:44] through them and by them will be
[1:40:46] fulfilled all that's been promised for
[1:40:48] his word
[1:40:49] in the virgin brother brown said there
[1:40:52] are certain things he could not fulfill
[1:40:54] when he was here on earth so now he
[1:40:55] works in and through his bride
[1:40:58] it wasn't time for him to work then in
[1:41:00] that
[1:41:01] but now it is
[1:41:04] amen
[1:41:05] okay
[1:41:06] okay let's go just just a little further
[1:41:08] here
[1:41:09] the word of promise now listen to this i
[1:41:12] want you not to catch this i mean i want
[1:41:14] you to catch this
[1:41:17] watch what he says here
[1:41:21] this what spurred me actually to take
[1:41:24] part two here
[1:41:26] the word of promise who is he he's the
[1:41:28] word of promise isn't he
[1:41:30] the word of promise watch how the
[1:41:32] prophet words this the word of that
[1:41:34] member that's pick up your pen and write
[1:41:36] this wasn't brother brown's writing
[1:41:38] this was god writing through his pen
[1:41:41] this is god speaking in a love letter to
[1:41:43] his bride
[1:41:46] i don't believe god minced the words
[1:41:47] here
[1:41:48] he said the word of promise in himself
[1:41:53] that a strange statement the word of
[1:41:55] promise in himself
[1:41:58] well who would be
[1:42:00] himself
[1:42:03] the bride
[1:42:05] the word of promise in his bride
[1:42:10] god himself made manifest
[1:42:15] amen
[1:42:17] god himself made manifest
[1:42:21] he will act himself
[1:42:24] by his own word of promise so the word
[1:42:26] of promise is in himself
[1:42:30] and god then comes and quickens himself
[1:42:32] to manifest himself
[1:42:35] reveals quickens his word of himself
[1:42:37] because his bride is himself
[1:42:40] the word of promise comes in himself
[1:42:44] amen
[1:42:47] god himself made manifest he will act
[1:42:49] himself by his own word of promise as to
[1:42:52] fulfill all that's been written of him
[1:42:55] as he did when he came from the virgin
[1:42:57] womb which is a type of the spirit womb
[1:42:59] now so will the virgin now accepting his
[1:43:02] word be it unto me
[1:43:04] see so will the virgin now accepting his
[1:43:07] word
[1:43:08] amen be it unto me as thou hast said
[1:43:12] though was said by an angel yet while it
[1:43:14] was while it yet was written in the word
[1:43:17] there you are that's exactly what we've
[1:43:19] received
[1:43:21] by an angel
[1:43:25] they will love him and love his and have
[1:43:27] his potentials for he is their head he
[1:43:29] is their head
[1:43:31] nothing else is their head make sure who
[1:43:33] your head is
[1:43:36] he is their head
[1:43:40] and they are his subjects
[1:43:43] subject to his head
[1:43:45] headship of christ was his
[1:43:48] all right
[1:43:52] here is the secret
[1:43:54] the word is in the bride
[1:43:57] and the mind of christ
[1:44:00] to know what he wants done
[1:44:02] with what
[1:44:04] the word
[1:44:07] and she does it in his name
[1:44:10] she has thus saith the lord
[1:44:14] amen
[1:44:16] for it is himself in them
[1:44:19] continuing
[1:44:20] to fulfill
[1:44:23] his word
[1:44:25] amen
[1:44:36] when
[1:44:38] now see now
[1:44:40] god's word is embodied in the bride just
[1:44:42] like it was embodied in jesus christ
[1:44:44] brother and said now it's embodied in
[1:44:46] the body of his bride it should throw us
[1:44:50] to desperation
[1:44:55] that eternal great mystery that god had
[1:44:57] as a mystery has now been unfolded in
[1:44:59] jesus christ and given right down to his
[1:45:01] church
[1:45:02] first fold

[1:45:07] of the threefold purpose
[1:45:09] of the seventh seal that's god unfolding
[1:45:12] his purpose he kept that a mystery
[1:45:14] but all that god was he poured into
[1:45:16] jesus christ all that jesus christ was
[1:45:18] he poured down into his church and once
[1:45:20] what was once in god's mind is now in
[1:45:22] the body of christ
