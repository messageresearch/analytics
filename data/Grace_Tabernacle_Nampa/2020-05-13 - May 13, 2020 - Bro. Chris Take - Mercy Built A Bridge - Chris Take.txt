thank you Jesus mercy said no [Music] amen are you glad that mercy said no praise the Lord let's tanzanite let's turn to the Book of Ruth in chapter 4 Ruth chapter 4 and verse 13 so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto her the Lord gave her conception and she bare a son and the women said unto Naomi blessed be the Lord which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famous in Israel and he shall be under the ever store of thy life in the nurture of thine old age for the daughter-in-law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons have borne him Galatians chapter 3 3 verse 13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessings of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's covenant edit fit be confirmed no man listen knoweth or added thereto now to Abraham and his seed where the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ Revelation chapter 5 one last scripture and then we'll pray Revelation chapter 5 and verse 1 and I saw the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we come before you tonight Lord asking father that she would speak to us Lord father we are humanity Lord Jesus and father we have false lore but father we come into your presence Lord Jesus and and father we were reminded once again that we are not of this world father but we are children Lord of the kingdom of God that father we are Lord priests Lord Jesus and kings and queens father and father destined to rule Lord Jesus one of these days on the other side father and Lord here in this world that we live in Lord that we see death around us father yet we within us Lord the life father there is eternal life Lord Jesus and that is what's carrying us through father that is what's giving us Lord strength and courage Lord Jesus in the face of adversity Father glory asset tonight you would Lord has come down father orders you already feel your presence here Lord Jesus and you would connect with each one tonight father Lord those that are needy those that have desires of their heart or Jesus father I pray you'd come and meet those needs oh Jesus Lord give those desires or Jesus and father the cold father made you warm them Lord Jesus and father but you said he'd sew on fire tonight orotate pray that you take these words though Jesus now father and then bring them down to our hearts we pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen praise the Lord may be seated tonight amen so my title tonight his mercy built a bridge and my subtitle is not left without a kinsman Lord are you thankful tonight you were not left without a kinsman you know it I used to sometimes sometimes I have sermons where the title doesn't make sense they live variated and sometimes you have titles that give away your whole sermon raise the Lord but amen we read here in Ruth we read the end of the story Ruth is giving birth to Obed and the story of Ruth as we know is a is an example of the kinsman redeemer and then then Galatians I've short-term memory so I'm going to flip back to Galatians in Galatians uh I shouldn't confess that I don't have short-term memory loss I'm not gonna claim that Galatians chapter 3 we read that Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law and we know that when Christ came and he died on Calvary and he had his ministry here on earth that that was the cross we went from the dispensation of the law the dispensation of grace and so there was a crossing over and God Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law because no man can can live by the law Paul said that you can't and he even had comfort conflict with Jews who were saying you know we we must stick by the law and and these Gentiles you can't bring them to church and they you know if they're gonna calm you know they they're trying to make you think it was Titus be circumcised and he's like look then none of that matters anymore because Christ has come and it's interesting and I just just because it's kind of the same thing that we have today we have people who are trying to to hold up and wait for brother Branham to come back and and they've lifted brother Branham up into a position like the Jews had lifted up the law and then they were putting the law above the working of Christ and but what the law did was the law was Christ's desire that for us to follow but he knew that there was no way any way that this could be met because it had to be a shed blood of an innocent I'm an innocent man and the blood of bulls and goats cannot save a man and so it had to be a kinsman redeemer had to be a another person but that person had to be born of a virgin he had to be pure and so God knew you you couldn't live the law but it was a type of what was to come and I'm the the Ministry of brother Branham it brought us to Christ and now that we've come to Christ the law brought the Jews to Christ but there it was now time to step into Christ and step into following Christ and not that you would step away from that because there's many things in the law that carried over but we eat bacon in the morning the Jews couldn't eat bacon right there are certain things that didn't follow over but the dispensation of grace of Christ coming down he was what was he doing he was introducing a relationship that we didn't have prior to that and when brother in the ministry brother Branham he came and introduced Christ to us and renewed that relationship that we have as mrs. Jesus Christ before that we had there was confusion but he was sent to tie up the loose ends as we know and so if we can go all the way back to the beginning in the Garden of Eden and begin to look at this this picture of the kinsman redeemer and we see that there a relationship was broken there was a relationship that God had between Adam and Eve and God would come down in the cool of the evening and he would he would fellowship with Adam and Eve one-on-one they would be standing in the presence of God after the fall in the Garden of Eden you could not come into the presence of God except for the high priest could once a year but if he didn't have his steps in his bells and and everything just right God struck him dead there was no mercy there amen this relationship was broken by the fall of humanity amen we know that Eve she she took the word of the serpent over the Word of God and cause sin to be introduced into the human race and as Adam and Eve walked from the Garden of Eden all seemed lost and brother branham he kind of gives a good picture of it and it's a kind of a couple of paragraphs and I could probably say what he says here but I just love the way he describes what happens and it's in the cruelty of sin then penalty that it costs to rid sin from our lives 1953 he says so there I can imagine seeing that poor little Eve when she looked at Adam her long blonde hair hanging down her back those big bright blue eyes that looked like the skies where God had made them the tears pouring down mixing with the blood and the garments and flapping down around her body Eve Adam with his strong body caught her and leaned her over all on his bosom and there the tears mingling falling as it run through the sheep skins blood dripping down blood all the way there now he says you have to depart out of my presence amen I cannot imagine the grief that Adam and Eve must have been experiencing they hear the words of God say you must depart from my presence and then we have a hard enough time leaving sometimes the real Prestone presence of God in the church amen and we're sitting here and rejoining it and we know that presence is with us wherever we go but we have such a hard time leaving that imagine God coming down and saying you need to leave amen that's what they were experiencing and he says I if he goes on the stage as I can see even Adam with their arms around one another going moving out like this them old sheepskins flopping against their leg bloody beating on their leg then I can select space which was God God had no beginning of days ending of years he is forever and forever I can see all that great space begin to move together like this coming down to a funnel shape like that and it moved right down as he began to I that little couple going down through the Garden of Eden bloody skins flopping against their leg I guess you don't have the whole quote I'm sorry flopping against their leg he says he couldn't stand it God couldn't stand it and it moved down I'll move down to the very heart of God spelt l.o.v.e God so loved he just couldn't see them go he called him back he said I'm going to put enmity between your seed and Satan's seed then when that was done was that Calvary when God Himself came down through a woman born of a virgin so here's Adam and Eve walking from the Garden of Eden and then the relationship has been broken off but before they go God says wait I have a promise this we had in the Garden of Eden will return amen you caused the fall I will cause the resurrection and because even though it was our fault he didn't just cast it upon us and say now you need to fix the problem no we pay the price for that but God came along said you know what there's no party way it's impossible for them to bring themselves back to my through a relationship with me I have to go and rescue them I have to go and be their kinsman redeemer so as a deliverer walking from the garden Amen God gets in this promise says hey listen here I'm going to come back and put enmity between your seed and Satan's seed in other words you know bruise the head of the serpent and so we know that that was a promise given and no doubt Adam preached this to his kids as he as he grew older and to his grandchildren and then his great grandchildren and his great great grandchildren and perhaps when it came down to the time of the end of Adam's life and he was there and and he lived you know close to the time of I might get my math here wrong Noah or Enoch somewhere he died just before that Noah was young boy when Adam passed away but when he left he said he said it hasn't come yet but there's coming a time when God will restore what we lost in the Garden of Eden but at this time there was a split between Earth and heaven an uncrossable canyon had formed there was no way for us to cross over it but God gave a promise and only one person could bridge that gap you say well how was this set in place well from the beginning of time well before the beginning of time because God is eternal the price for sin has been always been blood of an innocent and so that is the price and God and when we see you John and he has the he has the vision and he sees that the the the I wish I had that scripture he sees John's looking and he's having the vision and he sees that that there's that there's no way help me out somebody know what that is that's top there in oh I read it Wow okay forgive me I thought I did praise the Lord and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and I wept much because no man was found worthy why because it had to be a virgin born man but John is standing there like that's impossible that's an impossible thing who can do this who can be worthy and he said and the Bible says that that he says before the Lion of the tribe of Judah and he says in the behave in the midst of it he saw a lamb as it had been slain a man that lamb was the Lion of the tribe of Judah and so but here is John and he's weeping because it's impossible for this gap to be bridged amen mercy built a bridge and he's seeing Hey look at this we need this Redemption plan notice it was sealed with seven seals which is the book of redemption we need this Redemption plan but who is worthy who can come and open the book and so the says do not weep John the Lion of the tribe of Judah in other words crowd God came down born of a virgin born perfect spotless lamb and gave His life on Calvary and I I degress I'm repeating myself tonight this stuff we already know but brother now says in 1960 the kinsman redeemer he says all the law of redemption is this that before a man could redeem of lost property he had to be the nearest kinsman and the next thing he had to be an upright man a just man to do it and then he had to be worth enough money to do it and then he had to make a public testimony that he had done it and from then on it was his property amen praise the Lord here's the catch though you were already his property before the foundation of the world the redemption plan had been had been acted upon and what does that mean that means that he was already set up so no matter what Adam and Eve did God had to come back in and bring his word to pass just like the fact that you will overcome Laodicea and you will stand upon the other side and walk their streets of gold as a promise set before you were born set before the world was born set before God put a little Hickey in in eternity the hill hickey of time brother BAM says before that was ever happened your story was already written so there's nothing that devil can do because guess what the devil knows your story and he's trying to bluff to you and say there's no way that you can make this there's no way you can do it you need to feed on the world you need to enjoy the world while you're here because you're going to die one of these days and you're not going to have the opportunity but the thing of it is is your story's already being written and tonight I'm going to tell you that the ending is better than you can imagine better than anything this world can offer our end our end on this world is just the beginning amen praise the Lord so now we have we have this Redemption plan set in place here tonight and and we have our title mercy built a bridge and so we look at the story of Ruth now Ruth was a type of the bride and Boaz was a type of Christ and just a little tidbit Boaz was actually part Gentile because his mother was Rahab the harlot and so he was half Jew half Gentile and so we see that we you can read the Book of Ruth and you go home tonight or tomorrow morning read it in your devotions and you see that that at the very beginning we see the fault of humanity and once again this is the story of redemption but the redemption and the rescue me needed was done they were they were put in that position because of their own fault just like Adam and Eve and so it's just incredible and it's the grace of God that we put ourselves in their situations and God comes along and he brings us out of him amen he doesn't say oh you know you fell down you pick yourself up and you knock it off and knock us around no he says let me he extends a hand down into the miry clay and pulls us up because he knows amen that there's no way you can do it of yourself amen you need Christ and that's because the the weapons and the onion or the wet excuse me the warfare that we are caught up in Amen is beyond what we as humans can do they are what the flesh man can do that's why we needed the kinsman redeemer Amen it's the only way for us to fight that evil of this age is with the blood of Jesus Christ and so Naomi goes with her husband and Roo and her two sons and they go to Moab and her son's married to Moabite his women Ruth and Opa Opa Opa or fuh whatever and we know the story the husband and the Naomi's husband and her sons died and she says she tells orbits us to stay behind and Ruth to stay behind Ruth says no I must go with you so Ruth goes with Naomi now the thing here is that Naomi now has no access to her inheritance she has an inheritance with without someone to carry on the name to carry on the line amen she has she she has no she has lost her claim on her inheritance and so she has to have seed to raise up to her inheritance otherwise when she passed away it would be the end of it and so um she says hey Ruth she says hey there's this guy his name's Boaz and he's got a nice farm he's an older man but he's single sometimes you older ones are well-established you marry make me my wife we got married we were young we both had a lot of growing up to do we still do we still do but my goodness you should have seen this then but we should have a lot to do a lot of growing up to do but anyways here's Boaz man we don't know boys his story perhaps he he you know he just never found himself a girl but he's got a farm and he's got people that work for him so he's has to be a little bit older and so he says no it says Ruth listen go on down to the field and I'm going glean and so when the when it was harvest time and they would harvest the grain there would be pieces that fell down and by the wayside and they didn't go back and pick them up at it was part of the tradition in the law I think you can read it in there where I had to be left so that it could be gleaned by the people that were poor and so she says go glean and so boys sees this young beautiful girl Ruth and he says hey um he asks his guys he said who is this this girl over here and it's oh that's Naomi's daughter-in-law and he says oh wow cheating you because Boaz was related to the homie and um he says drop a little extra for her and so um now Ruth comes back and then she says look Naomi I've got you know look how much grain I got and she goes wow how you know how how you know Boaz has shown them favor towards you so here's what you do tonight go lay at his feet go sneak in to the threshing floor and lay at his feet and so boys sneaks it excuse me Ruth sneaks in there and she lays down she pulls a little cover over her about his feet and boys wakes up and he goes who's there she does its Ruth and it was okay she says I need you to play the kinsman Naomi's your is your cousin or your relation and she needs we need you to play the kinsman redeemer or the the for the inheritance and so he says hey I'll take care of this matter just rest amen and so um Boaz says well okay look there's one person that's closer and I'll go and talk to talk to him now the catch was the guy was like sure I'll take you know all of the the property and everything of Naomi and this inheritance and he says well but you have to take Ruth and he says well I can't take Ruth because it'll Mar my own testimony and because he already had perhaps a wife and stuffer or whatever reason it was going to Moorish testimony says I can't take the Ruth with that and so he boys says okay then I'll be the kinsman I'll be the Redeemer and the near kinsman and I will do the act of of claiming this inheritance and so Boaz takes Ruth to to his to be his wife and mm-hmm and prayers Lord and so while he is doing his part in the army tells Ruth she says look rest sit still for for he will not rest until he has done this thing today and amen you are called to rest rest that that that God will come and and he will do this thing today well God Christ has already done it he's already given that been their kinsman redeemer and I'm but but still God says NAIP rest I am your Redeemer I have taken care of this for you now rest and that is what you know the Sabbath before the disposition of the law was it was a day but now once Christ has come we have an internal Sabbath we have eternal rest in Christ because why he's taking care of that part for us he said he can care of the restoration and so Boaz does the part of the kinsman men but before there could be a relationship between Boaz and Ruth first he had to be her kinsman redeemer redeeming the inheritor of Naomi now once the part of the kinsman redeemer was played once Boaz took care of that then they could become husband and wife amen Christ had to be your kinsman redeemer before you could become mrs. Jesus Christ but we know that that God came amen and he brought me the word and he he became our kinsman redeemer amen and now with the that's why we need the full word manifested in our day because the seven seals is the full book of redemption and without the fullness of redemption you cannot have a fullness of relationship with Christ amen that's why it's so important and that's why the devil fights it so much because without the full plan of redemption there is no relationship no wife and husband relationship with Christ and without that without that relationship you cannot receive seed you have to receive the word seat a man without the seed even the foolish version has the seed did you know that for the band says she has the sea but not the moisture to make it grow so even the fullest version says they the seven seals and believes the opening of the word and receives the seed amen but there's something that happens along the way there they let the oil go out of their lamps praise the Lord but once there was restoration then she could receive seed of her Redeemer amen and through that we see the manifestation of that relationship in Obed and Obed means a worshiper and so once that once you come into a relationship with Christ God says I want to be worshipped he says we before those before the dawn of time God had a desire in his heart that he wanted to be worshiped Amen but true worship true worship can only come when you have back when you have that relationship with Christ and that promise that is born of the seed received from Christ that brings worship to God you say well I come to church and I lift my hands and I sing that's praise and there's nothing wrong with praise but when you connect with your Redeemer when you connect with your kinsman that is when real worship comes from your heart why because you have a revelation of who Christ is to you it's like when you have been between a husband and a wife when you know she loves you amen though there's the worship there there's a praise you you just saw you're so beautiful and you're not just saying those words you mean it down in your heart and you're just like I gotta say it cuz it's spilling out from inside of me and when you connect with Christ it's the same thing and that's what he's looking for he doesn't want or it was lip praise he doesn't want lip service he wants worship of your heart and the only way that can come as if you've gone into that secret place with Christ amen Boaz and Ruth did not did not come together as husband and wife in the open they came together suppose even wife in the secret place amen the secret place and that's where you that's where the full redemption plan that's why the Seventh Seal the third pool it's a secret it's a secret because it's Christ its Christ revealing himself to you amen not nothing not just of the Bible and scriptures and the message as words and quotes but but but something it's between the lines amen when you connect you know when you have a love for your wife but the brand uses an example you know you get a letter from her oh I put the kids to bed and I you know I did this and I clean the house and everything and we miss you you just read I love you I love you I love you I love you I can't wait to see you I can't wait to hold you and give you a hug give you a kiss and that's what you and you were when you that's why devotions it can't just be like reading a newspaper you say I am you know as a young kid I so you know what's how do you relieve the Bible without reading it like a newspaper and then you know as you get older and you grow up you begin to understand things and hopefully and and you realize that that when you read it and you're connected you're in his presence then he's speaking to you through his word now the same thing happened you UVI as a as me as chris i can't preach about the kinsman redeemer without bringing up abraham and sarah because it's such a perfect story amen that they have been to give been given a promised son amen you as children of Abraham have been given a promise son amen and that promise was was Christ and so so once Abraham and Sarah received a body change you received the body change you're not the same person you were before so Saul became Paul he had a body change now with that body change then it was then but then Christ comes he introduces himself to to Abraham as on the backside of the desert and he says hey I will visit you according to the time of life and you shall receive a son you are introduced to Christ you receive your body change then you're introduced to Christ excuse me and then God comes down and he says and then he gives you the seed and then he gives you that that that promise son and then you bring what do you bring forth what do you bear forth what's growing inside of you what you a woman can't be pregnant without everyone noticing right because that belly just grows on out there right you can't receive the seed of Christ Old Glory tonight you can't receive this feet of Christ without some kind of physical physical manifestation and then people are gonna know you've been with Christ people are gonna know there's something changed inside of you and then there's something working inside of you and guess what you don't go from from zero from one week to twenty week overnight you don't show that fast it's a process it's a process but guess what amen my wife she can't speed the process along and she might want to but she can't speed it along Amen she's got a bear sometimes you have to bear the pain of bearing Christ sometimes you have to go through hard shift and you wake up in the morning and you're sick and you don't feel like a Christian and you feel pregnant but you just said what's wrong with me amen you become pregnant with the Word of God and then you start to have problems you start to have you start to get sick what and I'm not sick and in the natural body and not sick in the spiritual body but things aren't going well it's harder to move around amen and the closer you get amen praise the Lord the closer you get or the full manifestation amen the full manifestation of what you have received the harder it gets to move around the harder it gets to - to do your daily duties in man the harder it gets for Christian to keep the house clean and the kitchen clean the harder it gets for you to get up in the morning and commit time the devotion but God says I need that of you I need you to keep that relationship amen I need you to hold on to that because guess what you're experiencing growing birth pains because you're getting closer and closer to the full manifestation sons of God amen the earth groaneth and travaileth for the manifestation of the sons of God amen as you see the coronavirus and and and the fires in Australia and the world growing what is getting closer and closer what - the manifestation of the sons of God praise the Lord praise the Lord Amen well what happened there was a chasm between this you needed this to become a true worshiper of Christ you need this seed if in you in order for you to become a son of God and the daughter of God but there was a chasm an uncrossable kratom chasm but tonight Amen I'm here to tell you mercy built a bridge across that chasm amen it was in God's grace and God's mercy that he returned and became our Redeemer praise the Lord amen and this see that you're receiving Amen this seed is the original seed originals means meaning nothing came before it praise the Lord and the first atom in the first Eve amen the receive the seed she received of Adam was not original he said something came before it but God says that will not happen again I will give her the original seed so the second Adam comes and before anything can get to that God comes down and gives that seed so now she has now you have this seed and you are sealed the room is sealed Amen once that mm-hmm there's just there's just a small space of time amen were if a woman were to take it you know the story of the babies she had two babies one was black on his white she you know had was with her husband in the morning with some other guy that night but once you get past that period of time no matter what you what you tried to do I mean you cannot give that pregnant woman another child because she's her womb has been sealed and so God comes and he seals you now you're sealed unto the day of your redemption in other words you can't receive any other idea Amen there's a sister out in Alaska she is in in a village all by herself and she received a mess of the hour and God really set her on fire I think it's Quinta Hawk is where she's at and um her family was really concerned you know she became this Brandon mite so they go online and they search up all the bad stuff about brother Branham they bring her you know all these pages says you need to read this you need to look and she goes I don't need to look it's already too late she's like I can read it but it's not gonna do anything because I've already been sealed amen and that's what's going to get you there and so if you have not yet gone into that secret place praise the Lord you need to do something whether Branham says in spoken word is original see in 1962 he says what time did I start I feel like I'm going too fast Bray's Lauren he says um he says them before they came together Adam and Eve she was pregnant with the corrupt seed from the serpent and when Adam come to his wife he found her pregnant it to death see death how spiritually and physically dead but when Joseph the human come to his wife glory says can't hardly hold her she was pregnant with life I mean it's harder to get your arms around your wife when she's full of pretty fully pregnant where's Lauren the Word of God and flesh in her womb bring back that spoken word bring back that Word of God which was word here come through a human's womb amen God will do it anyhow he spoke it and it's got to be so amen that's our God all that's rich brethren if you can dissolve in if you can hit it that's where he found when Adam come to his wife she was pregnant with the wrong seed when Joseph that's he died but Joseph come to his wife she was pregnant now what caused the different preparation because that Adams wife doubted the word that's why Joseph's bride believed the word that's the difference to read Amen if you read when when Mary was was given the word you will bear a child and then she's like how I have been with no man the Holy Spirit overshadow of you and then she had a chance to reject it Eve was given the word don't go speak to the don't go over to the street don't go talk to them Eve had a choice as well do I accept this this this um do I accept this or do I reject this and and Mary had the same choice do I accept it or do I reject it and you see Eve made the wrong choice and she accepted the wrong seed and but Mary accepted the right seed amen and because of that Amen we were a God was able to bridge the gap amen praise the Lord and we see that he comes down amen on the day of Pentecost and now you have people running around talking like crazy people to the rest of the the city you know these guys are full of new wine and he says Peter gets up and says you know we're not we've received the Holy Ghost and the power from on high listen that shook the world at the time men we we we in this day and age you know that the anointing of the Holy Ghost and then the moving of the Spirit of God has been so given a bad name across the world over because of religion but in this in that time in that age had never been known before Amen they didn't know what this spirit was what this Holy Spirit was amen and God giving that gift to them prison Lord and then he came back in our days and he gives us that same gift again and he brings back all these things together so that we now with the Holy Ghost can go into the holiest of Holies because prior to that day man it had to be the high priest had to be someone else going for you in animat but now Christ is our high priest praise the Lord but with God all things are possible and the same God that built a bridge across to what seemed an uncrossable Canyon to restore the bride of Jesus Christ so can his mercy build a bridge over the canyon you face and the Lord's been dealing with my heart and I've been I've been saying Laura you know I just I just really and we always desire to draw closer to God but lately I've just been yearning and desiring though I just want to I just want to you know wrap myself in I just want to crawl inside of you and I I want to get as much as I can of you and so in the office tonight I was praying and that burden was on my heart Lord I desire to be closer to you I desire a relationship with you amen and God spoke to my heart I said well Mercy's built a bridge so if you have that gap that can form Amen let's be real tonight the cares of life come in things happen and sometimes a little gap forms between you and God but God but mercy has built the bridge and so Gus as God came down and bridge the gap between humanity and himself and so even that same mercy can restore and bring you back amen across that relationship across that chasm that's formed in your relationship with Christ and you can be really reunited with that amen but you see but you see it always comes down to this as Christians it always comes down to a choice free moral agency and it always comes down to steps um foot steps is possessions there's a bridge for you to cross but you have to walk across it amen you have to go across then you know what I've been thinking about the children of Israel and how when when when they all crossed over the river Jordan underneath the Ministry of Joshua God parted the waters amen but when Joshua and Caleb and the other 10 spies when they went to seek out the land and they went to go on to the promised land they had to wade through the waters amen not there's a song and and perhaps I'll sing it sometime but it says sometimes when I asked you to part the waters you asked me to wade through them and sometimes when I asked you to move the mountains you asked me to climb over them and many times we just expect God to move everything out of her way but sometimes sometimes he says look I want you to walk over this one right now I want you to cross this river right now he says but mercy has built a bridge and so even though you have to cross the water God's gonna give you everything you need to move across the water even if he calls you to climb the mountain and when God's gonna give you the strength you need to climb the mountain so even in the hard times Amen God always provides what you need to overcome even what's in front of you amen and nothing can waiver you nothing can move you aside and maybe because of the seed that's down in your heart amen when the Bible says the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it it's speaking of that seed in your heart as soon as you think you can walk up as a human and take the gates of Hell and rattled him and then you have another thing coming but as soon as you identify say as a child of God and meant a seed of Christ in me they managed through the true Christ that I walk and I stay stay stay the course praise the Lord amen amen the power of Christ's life that lives in that seed you have been pregnant with will overcome amen and the hour of need you will not be left without a kinsman amen mercy built a bridge amen not left with out of kinsman in your hour of need whatever it would be a man you have a kinsman you have a redeemer every promise amen every promise in the book is mine listen God wouldn't give a promise well God wouldn't give a promise and not keep it but God wouldn't give a promise that you would never need how could God manifest himself you know the age-old question well if if if there's a God why does evil happen a God needed needed to express himself he says you know I want to be a savior well you can't be a savior unless you have someone to save God says I want to be a healer but he can't be a healer unless there's someone sick God says I want to be your strength giver but he can't give strength unless there's someone that is weak and when you're always walking down a rosy path you don't need strength so God can manifest his attributes in you so God says you know what I want to I want to draw from my child some more worship I want to draw from them a greater relationship so I'm gonna have them cross the water I'm gonna have them climb the mountain and when you when you go through those things it breaks you down I mean God loveth a spirit SATA or broke a broken spirit and or broken heart and I can't remember the scripture contract spirit you man God love God loves it when you're broke down and your humble because something in you changes something you changes you you realize that you realize that you can't do this you realize that you have no ability and and and the thing this is when you think you have ability we're just we're going tonight I mean we're walk we're we're moved past our notes we're just going with this tonight and then if it's all over the place you just pick them up it you want it's a buffet good night and so and so and you can overeat and so um God says you know um you're going through these things and yeah and you broke down on your I have to find out where I was praise the Lord amen and God's been dealing with your heart and and your broken and your engine your humble then something changed within you and you when you begin to realize you can't do it on your own then you allow God to come and work because what does brother Branham say throughout the message he says he says you have to deal with your self we'll God won't come and just take yourself well out of the way your pride just gets in the way constantly and you think well I'm not a prideful person or pride manifests in many different ways amen and um and pride can come from bitterness but the Bible says bitterness is the root of all evil and if you study out complexes and stuff that people get you'll be amazed at how almost all of them go back to Pride and bitterness well they have you know they they they they have that you know this person they have they're scared at that that people don't like them all the time because because you know they're maybe there was a situation and someone didn't like him anymore and now they're there they're afraid to to put themselves out there and to be a friend because they don't want to be hurt again amen they're not willing to sacrifice and people with pride aren't willing to sacrifice you know a man that's proud of his of his his um his Beamer or his his Ferrari I mean he's not gonna throw it on the line to save somebody generally speaking a man he's not gonna throw it on the line to do something but someone who has a him who is without pride he says and there's good pride as I if I can say that tonight I mean you can be proud to be a Christian and then in the right way right context a humble peace humble confidence amen which isn't pride it's confidence but praise the Lord and so and so you you don't have pride then then you're willing to go down and get in the mud with your brother and get in the mud with your sister and you say you know what I they need my help but I'm gonna just swallow my pride I'm not gonna worry about my suit I'm gonna get it muddy because it can be replaced and that's a natural example and sometimes people you know they they shy away from being used by God because they're afraid to get a little bit of mud on their jeans a little bit of mud on their knees amen but sometimes you know you have that person in line at Starbucks or you have that person in line at the grocery store and they look like they came from the pit of hell and the last thing you want to do is talk to them but God sometimes those are the people who know what they are and know they need God but think there's no hope for them but you got to get dirty you have to hear you know you got to talk to them and you know what you can shy away sometimes because you have too much pride in your life that was a super tangent praise the Lord amen well that was for somebody a shot in the dark my brother Dale Smith he said some one time and he says almost be a shot at dark whoever else someone on the Internet praise the Lord Amen will close here tonight the sister II mean musician is gonna come praise the Lord so Mercy's built a bridge any situation you face in life amen a mirror I mention I mentioned it before but in any day you get up and you have nothing else to be thankful for you can be thankful Amen that that you have a kinsman redeemer you can be thankful that God has called you and God has filled you with the Holy Ghost and anytime you face a problem instead of instead of trying to build your own bridge remember there's already one there you just have to walk across you just have to walk across it Bible says foot steps is possessions amen every promise of God is there for you to take but you have to take it you have to stand up God said the job he said gird yourself stand up like a man I'm going to speak to you and just because God reaches down and helps us up sometimes that reaching hand is hey boy stand up kick in the pants if I had can have the liberty to say that sometimes that's what God doesn't and that that does doesn't always feel good and that doesn't you know but don't get upset just stand up and say yes sir I'm listening praise the Lord and um amen wow the president of lupus is so nice here tonight and you get a preacher and anointed and in the presence you know he'll talk all night and that jabber on but I don't want to I don't want to get lost in tangents and but if if I could just say one more thing tonight I mean why don't you book her head like this God is here and and I'm not one to put anything on God will do that God is sovereign and and when he comes he comes sovereignly and you can't fake it you can be caught up in emotion sometimes and and read the Rev every Rev your self up and Rev the people up but but then they walk away and they that there's an emptiness because it was emotions but I believe tonight and in just and sovereignty God is common and perhaps there's a gap between you and Christ you and your relationship I'm not talking about well it could be anything I know in my heart I say Lord I I let work get me caught up and and and and lord I wanna I want a close relationship with you and so if you're with me tonight my eyes are cold I lift my hands and I just saved Lord father I want to rededicate my life to you tonight or Jesus father the crazy age that we live in Laura you forgive me if I'm being too real tonight Lord father but fall we are brothers and sisters in a battle tonight and lord I ask that
