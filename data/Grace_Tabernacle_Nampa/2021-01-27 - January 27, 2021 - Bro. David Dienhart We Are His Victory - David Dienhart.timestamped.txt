[28:24] in prayer and out in the morning in the
[28:27] word where i didn't see his mercy new
[28:30] every every morning something it just
[28:32] quickens
[28:33] quickens quickens how many say and
[28:35] realize that's the walk of a believer
[28:38] is that word being quickened quickened
[28:40] again
[28:41] and again and again from glory to glory
[28:44] to glory to glory he's changing me
[28:47] where am i being changed what am i being
[28:49] changed into his very image for what
[28:51] purpose
[28:52] to meet him in the air there has to be a
[28:55] bride there has to be a full bride come
[28:57] into full manifestation
[29:00] there has to be a bride coming of christ
[29:03] before we are able to meet him in the
[29:04] air there has to be that
[29:06] union invisible union which is taking
[29:09] place
[29:10] now why you say brother david if it's
[29:13] taking place now you ought to be able to
[29:14] explain it to us i can't explain faith
[29:18] but i know it's happening i see it in
[29:20] the word i see it
[29:21] happening in my life i see it happening
[29:24] through this word and it's through his
[29:26] word amen
[29:29] he has made us and we are whatever he
[29:31] conquered
[29:34] he said this is my victory and he
[29:36] pointed to the bride
[29:38] this is this is what i this is my
[29:40] victory
[29:42] here she is amen
[29:45] hallelujah being born again
[29:48] chapter 1 verse 23 being born again of
[29:52] not of corruptible seed but of
[29:54] incorruptible
[29:56] seed by the word and the word of god is
[29:59] the seed of god being born again not of
[30:01] corruptible seed
[30:03] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[30:06] so we see here is a word birth
[30:10] which liveth and abideth forever for
[30:13] all flesh all flesh now i'm thankful
[30:16] that god sent a message
[30:18] to tell us who we are where we've come
[30:21] from who we
[30:22] are and where we're going it took the
[30:24] word the open
[30:25] word took the very mystery of god that
[30:28] was in the back part of his mind kept it
[30:29] until here at the end
[30:31] so the devil doesn't have a chance we
[30:34] have we have come into the complete full
[30:36] revelation of jesus christ
[30:39] amen and you know who that is
[30:42] his bride amen without his bride is not
[30:46] complete
[30:48] amen he's not complete
[30:52] take it right back to genesis what
[30:54] completed adam
[30:55] what was the revelation of adam
[30:59] eve was the revelation the hidden
[31:01] mystery of adam
[31:02] revealed amen
[31:06] amen so we see here for all flesh and
[31:10] i'm thankful he sent his word because
[31:12] his word divided asunder between the
[31:14] spirit and the soul
[31:18] this open word this third pull this
[31:21] revelation this
[31:22] message that god has sent us
[31:25] is absolutely showing us who we are
[31:31] and we mature he sent a word to mature
[31:34] his bride the opening of those seals was
[31:38] set to mature his bride into full
[31:41] maturity of himself
[31:44] amen so we see here but for all flesh
[31:49] for all fleshes as grass and all the
[31:52] glory of man is the flower of grass the
[31:54] grass withereth and the flower
[31:56] fadeth away
[32:00] but you're not born of flesh you are
[32:02] born of flesh but not born again of
[32:04] flesh
[32:05] because it says here being born again
[32:08] what is the new birth what is it
[32:12] and who is it
[32:16] and then you'll see who you are
[32:19] all right so in in verse 25 the flesh
[32:22] you just said what the flesh was
[32:26] but the word of the lord
[32:29] but the flesh is grass but you're born
[32:33] of the word
[32:33] and the flesh is grass and it's a
[32:35] weakling
[32:37] you can't put any trust in it
[32:41] it's your enemy it's enmity
[32:44] to the nature revealed of god in you
[32:49] all right but the word of the lord but
[32:51] the word of the lord endureth forever
[32:55] and this is the word which by the gospel
[32:58] is preached
[32:59] unto you i'm glad today
[33:03] that we have a spoken word light
[33:07] sent to quicken the bride to quicken the
[33:10] seed
[33:12] amen to its maturity for what
[33:15] a body change amen
[33:19] let's bow our heads heavenly father we
[33:21] thank you for the opportunity that we
[33:23] have
[33:24] to be assembled here tonight in thy name
[33:28] not a name i was not a name that will be

[33:50] by you
[33:51] you you called your name forth
[33:54] and we responded now lord we are not
[33:58] under a man's
[34:00] headship we are under the very headship
[34:03] of our lord
[34:05] under the administration of the son of
[34:07] man
[34:08] for lord we are your bride the very the
[34:11] very manifestation the very revelation
[34:14] of yourself
[34:15] in this hour being manifested being
[34:18] brought forth into a full
[34:20] complete oneness with you we thank you
[34:23] for this
[34:24] union taking place now father we just
[34:27] ask you to bless the word speak through
[34:31] these lips of clay lord
[34:33] and lord open the word to your people
[34:36] individually by revelation for it's the
[34:38] only way that we are saved
[34:40] is by revelation in jesus christ's name
[34:44] we pray
[34:46] amen we're saved by revelation and that
[34:49] by what
[34:50] grace you may be seated
[34:57] i want you to remember something as we
[34:59] go through here that abraham's
[35:01] seed not abraham's seed
[35:05] natural but abraham's seed
[35:08] spiritual brother branham said that seed
[35:11] was the faith
[35:12] abraham had amen
[35:16] i want you to lay that into your heart
[35:19] because we have the evidence
[35:23] when you have the when you are born
[35:26] again
[35:28] and we're going to come into what this
[35:29] is here and i just read it to you it's a
[35:32] word birth
[35:35] amen to be born again is a word birth
[35:38] it's a spoken word birth
[35:42] you have your season to be here you
[35:43] weren't called in
[35:45] we've come here in an end time season
[35:48] with an end time message
[35:49] amen with a final
[35:53] full revelation of jesus christ
[35:57] to take us out of here amen
[36:01] we are on our way homily believe the
[36:04] bride is marching
[36:06] in step being the word
[36:09] in step with the word amen
[36:13] she's very few but that's none of my
[36:15] business how few
[36:17] amen i'm just called to preach who she
[36:20] is
[36:22] and what she is amen and that's our
[36:25] revelation in this hour
[36:27] the prophet said those seals were open
[36:29] for that very purpose to show the bride
[36:31] how she was in the beginning and how
[36:33] she'd be here in the end and who she was
[36:35] right in the middle
[36:38] amen the whole revelation if the bible
[36:40] the word is the complete revelation of
[36:42] jesus christ
[36:43] it is so with the bride because she
[36:46] cannot be a word born bride and be
[36:49] something different than who he is
[36:52] hallelujah let me just say this that the
[36:55] word birth
[36:56] the word birth is jesus christ
[37:02] amen it's not another you can't have the
[37:04] word born and not be jesus christ the
[37:06] word
[37:07] born the word birthed amen the word for
[37:11] the season
[37:12] birthed is jesus christ
[37:16] it's not another amen
[37:19] it's not another that i just read it to
[37:22] you we're born by the word
[37:24] amen the word that birth there is
[37:27] jesus christ
[37:31] amen amen
[37:34] amen we are his victory
[37:37] we are his word living
[37:42] and operative now read
[37:45] i'll read as i well let's go to hebrews
[37:48] right now let's just go over there just
[37:49] at the moment i was going to read it
[37:51] towards the end it's amazing how
[37:52] sometimes the lord
[37:53] takes what's at the end and puts it at
[37:55] the beginning
[37:57] we know that as ministers we know that i
[37:59] have to just follow how the lord leads
[38:03] in hebrews 4 12 for the word of god this
[38:05] is what we're speaking of tonight
[38:07] the word of god amen
[38:11] the word of god is quick
[38:14] and powerful if you have a school field
[38:16] that quick and powerful means
[38:18] living and operative it's the same thing
[38:21] the prophet said he says who is this
[38:23] bride
[38:24] she is the word living and in action
[38:28] amen she's not just not just a word you
[38:31] can't have the word living and not be an
[38:33] action the word living is the very
[38:34] literal life of jesus christ
[38:37] living amen
[38:41] and it's got to be active it'll follow
[38:44] the word
[38:45] it'll act the word it won't be you it
[38:48] won't be david trying to act it out
[38:51] it'll be the word acting it out that's
[38:54] quite a difference
[38:55] it's not gonna be the flesh man trying
[38:57] to figure out how to do it
[38:59] it'll be a revelation to you to do it
[39:02] amen we live and walk by faith we don't
[39:06] we don't live by our
[39:07] own thinking we we we're not here to
[39:10] express our own thinking
[39:11] we're here to live by faith now faith is
[39:14] the substance of things hoped for
[39:17] and we know faith is a revelation so the
[39:19] revelation is the substance of things
[39:21] hoped for
[39:22] the revelation of the word it's the
[39:24] substance of things hoped for and the
[39:26] evidence
[39:29] it's the evidence you want to know what
[39:31] the evidence of a
[39:32] spirit-filled believer is it's that
[39:36] faith seed inside of you it's christ
[39:39] revealed in you
[39:41] amen is the evidence of things
[39:45] not seen in other words everything you
[39:49] when the holy spirit fills you with
[39:50] himself everything you have need of in
[39:52] this journey
[39:53] is in you amen
[39:57] you always in fact you always you always
[40:01] had the token but you didn't know what
[40:03] to do with it
[40:05] you didn't know what to do with it it
[40:07] was always there
[40:08] i wasn't just become a believer i was a
[40:10] believer before the foundation of the
[40:11] world
[40:13] i was in jesus christ the token before
[40:16] the foundation of the world
[40:17] but it's got to come to manifestation in
[40:19] a season
[40:21] amen is that right and just like you
[40:24] know just like
[40:25] uh rahab she had the token there she had
[40:28] the
[40:28] she had the the red red rope or the red
[40:31] twine or the red
[40:33] she had it she just didn't know what to
[40:35] do with it
[40:36] but until its predestinated season and
[40:39] time
[40:40] when it would come in the manifestation
[40:42] then it went into action
[40:45] hallelujah now we we have caught we've
[40:49] got a message beyond pentecost here
[40:51] we're not doing away with pentecost
[40:54] we've got to come through our pentecost
[40:55] but we've got a message that pentecost
[40:57] makes way for
[41:00] amen and the baptism of the holy ghost
[41:02] made way for what the holy ghost himself
[41:05] the token himself jesus christ himself
[41:09] the very literal life of christ himself
[41:11] to come right down
[41:13] in perfection or maturity again back to
[41:16] the word itself
[41:19] amen amen you see this is where we're at
[41:23] and that's why the devil's upset and
[41:25] that's why he's trying to get you every
[41:27] day to get your thoughts off of that
[41:29] word
[41:30] that's why he's trying to trying to get
[41:31] you to look at look at your
[41:33] how you feel and how you what you reason
[41:36] with and this and that and pull you this
[41:38] way and pull you that way
[41:40] and it's getting hotter and hotter this
[41:42] battle getting hotter and hotter all the
[41:43] time
[41:44] but so is the word getting more perfect
[41:47] and more perfect and more perfect
[41:49] in maturity all the time
[41:53] amen amen so
[41:56] so we see his we are his word living we
[41:59] just read it here the word of god
[42:00] the word of god is quick and powerful
[42:02] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[42:05] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[42:08] who you are and who you're not
[42:13] amen that's what is sent to do what else
[42:16] is going to unveil to you who you are
[42:18] it'll have to come through the word
[42:22] amen amen the spirit always the holy
[42:25] ghost travels through the word
[42:28] amen but if that word is not in the soul
[42:30] to meet it
[42:31] amen then it won't it that holy spirit
[42:34] can be there it can be anointed
[42:36] you can be anointed but if the word
[42:38] isn't in your soul to meet that word
[42:41] it'll never produce jesus christ because
[42:44] the dynamics
[42:45] of the word must come on the word amen
[42:48] are you with me
[42:52] because the bride's got to be both
[42:53] dynamics and mechanics
[42:57] you say well i i'm a good person i have
[42:59] let me just read to you what the prophet
[43:01] said here
[43:04] he said satan doesn't care how religious
[43:07] you are
[43:09] this is in this is the this is in the
[43:11] arising of the sun
[43:13] paragraph 30. satan doesn't care how
[43:15] religious you are or how right you are
[43:17] in your doctrine
[43:21] well brother david doesn't matter you
[43:23] can have an intellectual conception of
[43:25] the doctrine
[43:29] and if satan can get you just on your
[43:31] intellectual side with that
[43:34] and make you feel like you're a right
[43:36] smart boy you know the doctrine
[43:38] but that isn't enough amen are you with
[43:42] me
[43:42] okay he said he said i if you
[43:45] miss he said he don't care how right you
[43:48] are in your doctrine
[43:49] if you miss that life
[43:53] you won't come up anyhow no matter how
[43:56] religious
[43:59] how good
[44:02] how many churches you belong to and
[44:04] we're talking about
[44:05] message churches because that's where
[44:08] we're at today
[44:12] or will belong to
[44:16] it doesn't matter
[44:21] one thing it only it doesn't matter one
[44:24] thing unless you have been
[44:26] born again
[44:30] the new birth is who you
[44:33] are this is my what i'm wanting to deal
[44:36] with tonight
[44:37] this new birth this word birth
[44:43] is who you are
[44:46] you say no brother david you just said
[44:48] it's jesus christ you're getting the
[44:49] message
[44:54] because that's who the bride is
[45:01] amen you start bringing the word you
[45:03] start bringing you start living the word
[45:05] as a word test
[45:09] just let just let it live out of you
[45:13] just go to acting out of you you're
[45:14] coming back to the word coming back to
[45:16] the word
[45:16] satan doesn't like that but jesus
[45:20] took who he was the word and defeated
[45:23] the devil
[45:25] by the word he took his father's word he
[45:28] took the word he knew his position he
[45:30] knew he was the word
[45:32] living he went back to the word he went
[45:35] back to the very scriptures
[45:36] wrote of him and took the word
[45:41] and defeated the devil
[45:44] are you with me amen amen
[45:48] he knew where his victory laid he knew
[45:52] he was sent amen
[45:55] as god's own victory over all
[45:58] sin sickness amen
[46:02] he defeated it
[46:05] amen that's his victory
[46:09] what he when he went for he got it
[46:11] because he's a conqueror
[46:13] amen all right
[46:17] he said so by one spirit we're only born
[46:20] again
[46:20] by one spirit we'll come down to that in
[46:23] just a moment
[46:24] more brother branham said as the end
[46:27] time
[46:28] prophecies will repeat repeat what
[46:31] you'll get in this next statement i
[46:33] believe
[46:33] as the first forerunner came from the
[46:37] wilderness and cried behold the lamb of
[46:40] god
[46:43] that was john first forerunner
[46:46] 1933 on the river the star that pillar
[46:49] of fire
[46:51] come down told the prophet look up and
[46:54] he looked up
[46:56] and and voiced the voice out that people
[46:58] heard people were standing right there
[47:00] they saw it come down
[47:02] pictures of it taken went on the
[47:04] associated press
[47:06] he says that john the baptist was sent
[47:08] to forerun the first coming
[47:09] of christ your message
[47:12] your message
[47:16] amen your message will forerun the
[47:20] second
[47:20] coming of christ
[47:26] amen all right so as the end time
[47:30] prophecies will repeat
[47:31] he said i believe as the first
[47:33] forerunner came from the wilderness now
[47:35] this is pick up your pen and write this
[47:38] is not
[47:38] this is brother brown this is god taking
[47:40] his pen
[47:42] and writing through him this is god
[47:44] speaking right here writing
[47:45] writing right just pick up your pen and
[47:47] write he started writing what was coming
[47:49] to him
[47:50] god was given him to write this to us
[47:54] as a part of this love letter
[47:58] remember we said you know god god just
[48:01] said it in such a way
[48:02] he said i pray that you would have
[48:04] revelation and come have a spiritual
[48:06] understanding of what god's saying
[48:08] what god is doing without coming right
[48:10] out and
[48:12] saying it oh no brother david we have to
[48:15] have it just the way it was said
[48:17] well i'll have you know he said it in
[48:19] such a way to thin down his crowd
[48:21] and he said it in such a way that it
[48:22] would stumble some and some would hear
[48:24] it
[48:26] and god still does it that way amen
[48:29] now that's his way that's not my i'm not
[48:32] telling you that
[48:33] that's his way some are going to receive
[48:37] some are going to hear
[48:38] but he said it in such a way that that
[48:40] seed will hear that word
[48:42] amen okay he does it
[48:46] all right thank god for the word
[48:50] that was laying here in us ready to be
[48:53] quickened
[48:54] in the hour that we're here he had to
[48:57] speak it
[48:59] amen for we are his spoken word
[49:04] bride
[49:08] all right so he said as those end time
[49:10] prophecies will repeat i believe as the
[49:12] first forerunner came from the
[49:14] wilderness and cried behold the lamb of
[49:15] god
[49:16] the second forerunner who's the second
[49:18] forerunner
[49:22] malachi 4
[49:25] our prophet is that right he said
[49:28] he said i've i've introduced you to him
[49:33] i've introduced you to him he said
[49:35] what's my purpose of coming on earth
[49:37] spoken words original seeds what my
[49:38] purpose of coming on earth
[49:40] is to forerun that coming word
[49:46] remember my subject is who you are
[49:51] he said he said that's who i've come to
[49:55] forerun now watch what he says the
[49:56] second forerunner
[49:58] will probably do the same as these
[50:00] things repeat will do the same
[50:02] by pointing the people to a word
[50:06] born bride
[50:09] who is who himself
[50:14] is that right it's himself
[50:17] remember how brother brown said he come
[50:19] in three sons names son of david
[50:21] son of god i'm excuse me son of man
[50:25] son of david son of god son of david
[50:28] is that right he said to begin with it
[50:31] was son of man
[50:33] then son of god through the ages and
[50:35] then right here just before
[50:37] the millennium steps in or the rapture
[50:40] he's got to come again as son of man
[50:44] is that right how many know that's right
[50:47] according to the message he said it's
[50:49] got to be son of man again
[50:52] and he said the son of man and his
[50:54] coming would unite these two together
[50:57] him and his body as one because the son
[51:00] of man's return is the head
[51:02] he was the corner now he's the head of
[51:05] the corner
[51:08] amen if there was a first
[51:11] in order to have the first adam he had
[51:14] and he fell he had to
[51:15] restore a man that couldn't fall is that
[51:17] right it wouldn't fall
[51:20] that was the second adam but the second
[51:22] adam come up
[51:23] had in himself when he went to calvary
[51:25] both male and female and out of him come
[51:28] a bride
[51:29] is that right he was smitten just like
[51:31] adam was in the beginning
[51:33] and out of him come a bride and that
[51:36] bride
[51:37] started out as that bride she was
[51:39] original brother branham
[51:41] saw her in the preview of the bride
[51:46] saw her marching then he saw the worldly
[51:48] church
[51:49] and it got worse and worse and worse
[51:51] come to the the church of the us
[51:53] and it was filthy vulgar low down
[51:56] he said he didn't have words describe it
[51:58] but then again
[52:02] here come that little bride brother
[52:04] branham said masterpiece she is alpha
[52:06] and omega
[52:08] he is alpha and omega there had to be a
[52:11] first bride went into the ground there
[52:13] had to be a restoration of that bride
[52:17] i will restore my message and my end
[52:20] time messenger
[52:21] i will restore all that the palmer room
[52:24] the cankerworm the caterpillar the
[52:26] locusts had
[52:26] eaten right down to a stump but he
[52:30] couldn't get to the root
[52:32] because out of the middle of that tree
[52:35] brother brahm said out of the heart of
[52:37] it out of the middle of it he would
[52:38] produce another bride
[52:41] amen he would produce himself
[52:45] which she was in the beginning she'll
[52:47] produce himself in bright form
[52:49] you say how do you mean that because he
[52:51] told paul why are you persecuting me
[52:56] is that right he told he said paul saul
[53:00] saul
[53:01] light struck him down he said why are
[53:04] you persecuting me what do you mean i'm
[53:06] persecuting you lord
[53:07] he knew that was the lord why is it hard
[53:11] for you to kick against the pricks
[53:12] you're persecuting me because i'm here
[53:14] in bride form
[53:17] is that right okay what about at the end
[53:20] when the bride's supposed to
[53:21] return again
[53:24] amen it would have to be the bright
[53:26] coming of christ
[53:29] amen and it would have to mature to the
[53:32] complete oneness with himself
[53:34] so the head and the body are uniting
[53:37] we're not waiting for it to unite we are
[53:40] uniting
[53:44] hallelujah and so here we are in this
[53:47] end time
[53:49] and he's and then we're being put people
[53:51] are pointed not to another not to
[53:53] something else
[53:54] to himself in bride form
[53:59] and she's pointed and said here's the
[54:01] lamb here's your husband
[54:03] here is the one that you come out of
[54:06] here's the one you're married to
[54:10] amen amen all right now
[54:16] in john 1 13 let's go over there just a
[54:19] minute
[54:23] now that word will discern what's in
[54:25] your heart that word brings out what's
[54:27] in you
[54:29] because remember we're what we're what
[54:31] we're dealing with here tonight is the
[54:33] very
[54:35] is eternity unfolding
[54:38] behind badger skins
[54:42] only men on that one
[54:45] but that's what it is
[54:48] what were you what was laying inside
[54:51] your heart
[54:52] you didn't have anything to do that with
[54:55] it god put it there
[54:57] so he comes he unveils himself
[55:00] when he unveiled himself brother branham
[55:02] said when he unveils himself
[55:04] he said you come to yourself
[55:08] he has to unveil himself for you to be
[55:11] come to yourself
[55:13] that's what the seventh seal was all
[55:15] about it's his coming again
[55:17] as he promised he would for the rapture
[55:20] for the meeting in the air there has to
[55:22] be
[55:23] that unfolding there has to be the
[55:25] unfolding of himself
[55:27] in the bride form in order for it to be
[55:30] complete that's why the prophet
[55:31] said christ in you christ
[55:35] revealed in you which is the new birth
[55:38] christ revealed in you
[55:40] is the new birth christ revealed in you
[55:43] is who you are
[55:45] christ revealed in you identifies the
[55:47] evidence
[55:48] and how is it evidence by you being able
[55:51] to hear
[55:51] and receive the word for your season
[55:54] to receive revelation of that word is
[55:57] the evidence
[55:58] that you always were in him because the
[56:01] seed is that
[56:02] faith that was in him is now in you
[56:07] how did he know who he was how did jesus
[56:09] know it it was revealed to him
[56:15] that's right he was he was he come in
[56:17] this earth
[56:18] he was to say but he was the word yes he
[56:20] was but he had the re he had to go to
[56:22] jordan and receive the holy spirit
[56:26] and become both mechanics and dynamics
[56:28] or dynamics and mechanics are you with
[56:30] me
[56:33] that word as long as it's laying there
[56:36] without the dynamics
[56:37] it's good mechanics but it won't go
[56:39] anywhere without the dynamics upon it
[56:44] amen all right so he became
[56:48] he was the full complete he was
[56:52] he was our masterpiece
[56:55] but out of him was taking a portion
[56:59] apart
[57:02] now he's got to bring that part back
[57:03] into himself to make it complete
[57:07] all right are we getting the picture
[57:11] you didn't come this word birth you're
[57:13] born by the word you can be nothing else
[57:15] but him
[57:20] amen that word birthed in you will
[57:22] identify itself by hearing
[57:24] and receiving the word for your season
[57:30] and it's always a true revelation is
[57:32] going to be identified
[57:34] back in this word it will never leave
[57:37] this word
[57:37] if you have the word truly open to you
[57:39] it's going to dump it's going to speak
[57:41] through genesis to revelation
[57:44] got to come together amen
[57:51] all right now
[57:54] so she is him she must be restored now
[57:58] okay now let's john 1
[58:02] john 1.
[58:08] back to john chapter 1. i just want to
[58:10] drop this in as i read
[58:12] first peter 1 23. let's see what john 1
[58:20] says
[58:22] 1 13.
[58:25] let's take verse 12. but as many now he
[58:28] came to his own his own creation
[58:30] his own his own that he made and his own
[58:33] received him not but as many
[58:35] as received him
[58:38] there was always an elect few wasn't
[58:40] there but as many as received him to
[58:43] them gave he
[58:44] power or authority to become the sons of
[58:47] god
[58:48] even to them that believe on his name
[58:52] which were born not of blood
[58:55] all you had your first birth was a blood
[58:58] sexual
[58:59] not of blood and i'm talking about
[59:02] sexual now natural
[59:04] because we are born by the blood of god
[59:06] how many know that
[59:08] all right but he's talking about now
[59:10] he's talking about
[59:11] not of blood nor of the will of the
[59:13] flesh
[59:15] nor of the will of man but you were born
[59:18] of god
[59:21] you were born of god the gift
[59:25] of god is eternal life
[59:29] are you with me you were set by grace
[59:32] through faith
[59:33] and that not of yourselves it is the
[59:35] gift
[59:36] of god not from god of god
[59:42] you had your very portion in him to
[59:44] begin with
[59:47] amen to be expressed in this hour what
[59:49] is the expression of himself
[59:53] amen all right let's go to first john
[59:57] 5 first john 5.
[1:00:01] i don't know how far i'm going here
[1:00:03] tonight so just only go so far
[1:00:07] as far as the lord wants first john 5
[1:00:12] whosoever believeth
[1:00:16] now that's the key right there believeth
[1:00:20] brother branham said the holy ghost
[1:00:24] the holy ghost the token the token
[1:00:28] in you identifies
[1:00:31] the believer recognizes
[1:00:35] the believer what is the believer
[1:00:37] brother bam said in perfect faith the
[1:00:39] believer is the faith
[1:00:42] that is in you
[1:00:45] he said that's the believer he said oh i
[1:00:48] like that don't you he said
[1:00:50] he said the faith in you is the believer
[1:00:53] what's god recognized what do you
[1:00:55] recognize in adam or excuse me abraham
[1:00:58] by giving him the circumcision
[1:01:02] natural it was it was a token that
[1:01:06] he was that his faith had been received
[1:01:10] he was in the covenant unconditionally
[1:01:14] all right now the token
[1:01:18] is our seal is our recognition
[1:01:21] see why the token is a must you must
[1:01:23] have the token
[1:01:26] if you don't have the token you haven't
[1:01:28] even been recognized a believer
[1:01:32] your faith has not been recognized
[1:01:35] by god
[1:01:39] he says a strong statement but that's
[1:01:41] the truth
[1:01:44] brother brahms said that that
[1:01:46] circumcision of the spirit
[1:01:50] identifies and recognizes you
[1:01:54] in christ and that faith that you have
[1:01:57] is that that you are genuine seed of god
[1:02:02] and that faith is his and that faith is
[1:02:05] recognized
[1:02:06] and it is recognized
[1:02:12] as his own faith
[1:02:16] and by that
[1:02:20] abraham by that was i'm trying to find
[1:02:22] that word
[1:02:24] um let me just get back here
[1:02:28] what he said there i've just got to find
[1:02:30] that word i'm wanting
[1:02:32] in the fourth chapter
[1:02:35] oh yeah
[1:02:38] accounted to him for righteousness that
[1:02:41] faith was counted to him for
[1:02:43] righteousness
[1:02:45] then that faith was recognized to be his
[1:02:47] own
[1:02:49] are you with me it identified it
[1:02:52] you see you say well i believe in the
[1:02:53] blood but have you come through the
[1:03:00] blood
[1:03:02] you can't see have you come through it
[1:03:04] yet that's the thing
[1:03:06] you come through it what's on the other
[1:03:08] side of it
[1:03:09] if you genuinely come through it life is
[1:03:11] there
[1:03:12] to identify
[1:03:16] amen you've got to enter all the way in
[1:03:21] you've got to come all the way into the
[1:03:22] inside of the inside
[1:03:24] we've got to enter in all the way into
[1:03:26] the very presence of himself you come
[1:03:28] face to face with him
[1:03:30] then you realize that he is your
[1:03:33] revelation
[1:03:36] he is then you come face to face with
[1:03:39] who you are
[1:03:42] brother brown said he's he's pouring
[1:03:44] himself into you
[1:03:46] he said he he manifesting himself
[1:03:49] pouring himself out pouring himself into
[1:03:51] you
[1:03:51] and he said he's becoming you're he's
[1:03:53] becoming personalized
[1:03:56] to you he's becoming personalized
[1:04:01] brother braham said another place he
[1:04:02] said the revelation of this message
[1:04:04] would unite the so to two together until
[1:04:06] they're both the same self person
[1:04:09] the revealing of the son of man
[1:04:13] would so unite the bride in him as one
[1:04:16] that they're the same self-person
[1:04:22] amen first john
[1:04:26] 5 whosoever believeth that jesus
[1:04:29] is the christ is born of god
[1:04:35] didn't say whosoever believeth that
[1:04:37] jesus was the christ
[1:04:41] is the christ and no man can call jesus
[1:04:45] the christ
[1:04:46] only by the holy spirit so it's got to
[1:04:50] be revealed to you
[1:04:55] that he is the christ and if it's a
[1:04:57] revelation to you that he is the christ
[1:05:00] that's he that's born again that's he
[1:05:03] that's born of god
[1:05:07] amen without brother bram said without
[1:05:09] being born again how can you say he is
[1:05:11] the christ or he is lord
[1:05:15] right that's first corinth that's first
[1:05:17] corinthians
[1:05:18] 12 3 if you want to look that scripture
[1:05:20] up
[1:05:23] no man can call jesus the lord except by
[1:05:25] the holy ghost
[1:05:28] amen he can't say he's lord
[1:05:31] without having the holy ghost he's
[1:05:35] amen are you with me a lot of people a
[1:05:37] lot of people have a title
[1:05:40] the title i believe the message it's a
[1:05:42] message title but they don't have the
[1:05:44] abstract to it
[1:05:47] are you with me it's not having just the
[1:05:50] title
[1:05:51] you need to have the abstract that
[1:05:53] identifies that title
[1:05:55] that that title is genuine and you're
[1:05:57] cleared and there's nothing behind you
[1:05:59] that can stand your way and nothing
[1:06:01] ahead of you your future is clear
[1:06:05] every trial every test you have to go
[1:06:07] through your future is clear
[1:06:12] those that he foreknew he called and
[1:06:14] those that he called he justified
[1:06:16] and those that he had justified he's
[1:06:18] already glorified
[1:06:22] amen your future
[1:06:26] can you realize what the token is
[1:06:29] it's the birth of the word in you and
[1:06:31] that's got to grow
[1:06:33] and how's it going to grow if that
[1:06:35] word's living in you you can't stay out
[1:06:37] of this message
[1:06:40] you've got to feed on it you've got to
[1:06:42] eat on it you've got to
[1:06:43] you've got to drink in the light living
[1:06:45] water and as you drink it in you mature
[1:06:48] you mature
[1:06:49] you grow you grow the path of the
[1:06:51] justice as a shining light
[1:06:53] that grows more and more

[1:07:06] perfect

[1:08:13] right
[1:08:14] but believeth substance faith

[1:09:36] amen i am that revelation i
[1:09:39] am the victory i am the revelation
[1:09:43] in you that makes you my victory
[1:09:51] all right first john 5 1 again he says
[1:09:54] and everyone that loveth him that begat
[1:09:57] what identifies you love him
[1:10:01] and everyone that loveth him that begat
[1:10:04] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[1:10:08] amen all right
[1:10:11] see by this we know we love the children
[1:10:14] of god by this by this
[1:10:16] by this we know we love the children of
[1:10:19] god
[1:10:21] when we love god and keep his
[1:10:23] commandments for this is the love of god
[1:10:25] that we keep his commandments
[1:10:27] and his commandments are not grievous
[1:10:28] the love of god is to keep his
[1:10:30] commandments
[1:10:31] this is the love of god that you keep
[1:10:34] his word you keep his command
[1:10:39] how can he birth then you do anything
[1:10:41] different
[1:10:42] he won't do anything different you're
[1:10:44] identified a believer you're identified
[1:10:46] you're
[1:10:46] it's your faith identified but oh
[1:10:48] brother you don't know what god did
[1:10:50] yesterday and i did this
[1:10:51] who did it you did it
[1:10:56] or you the man did it
[1:11:02] it must have been because that word
[1:11:05] inside of you birth and i'm not i'm not
[1:11:07] talking about something you hope it
[1:11:08] happens
[1:11:09] i'm talking about a divine revelation of
[1:11:11] himself in you
[1:11:12] you know you pass from death unto life
[1:11:14] the new birth is christ
[1:11:16] revealed in you the new birth is jesus
[1:11:20] christ revealed personally to you
[1:11:22] individually to you
[1:11:27] and you walk after spirit brother the
[1:11:29] prophet said pick up your pen and write
[1:11:31] he said
[1:11:31] you can't make her disbelieve the word
[1:11:34] then who failed it wasn't the word
[1:11:38] this failed but that's not counted to
[1:11:41] you
[1:11:41] because it's already been counted to you
[1:11:43] who you are
[1:11:44] then you rise right back up and say lord
[1:11:46] i didn't mean to do that
[1:11:50] is that right
[1:11:54] you never did anything to merit this
[1:11:58] revelation in you you didn't do one
[1:12:01] thing to merit it
[1:12:02] you didn't do one thing it was by grace
[1:12:05] through revelation
[1:12:08] that you're saved and not of works lest
[1:12:11] any man boast
[1:12:14] you can do all kinds of works you can
[1:12:16] and i'm not against good works
[1:12:18] but you can have all these good works
[1:12:20] and never have the love of god in you
[1:12:27] why you can you can have faith to move
[1:12:29] mountains and never have the love of god
[1:12:31] in you
[1:12:32] hello because you'll move mountains by
[1:12:34] the holy ghost
[1:12:37] but that doesn't mean he's living inside
[1:12:39] of you without having the evidence of
[1:12:41] receiving and hearing the word for your
[1:12:43] season
[1:12:46] you can be anointed and still not have
[1:12:48] it
[1:12:50] in your spirit it's the seed
[1:12:54] brother sister that makes the difference
[1:13:01] i'm talking about a word birth i'm
[1:13:03] talking about a seed birth
[1:13:05] i'm talking about that seed being
[1:13:06] quickened he sent the holy spirit to
[1:13:09] quicken the seed
[1:13:12] all right we're talking about as i said
[1:13:15] eternity unveiled unfolding in you
[1:13:18] maturing
[1:13:20] onward marching forward
[1:13:26] amen all right so we come down here to
[1:13:29] verse 4 what i want to get to for
[1:13:31] whatsoever
[1:13:33] for whatsoever is born of god
[1:13:38] overcometh the world
[1:13:42] and this is the victory
[1:13:45] that overcometh the world the revelation
[1:13:48] of who we are
[1:13:51] our faith
[1:13:55] which is what his faith
[1:14:00] whatsoever is born of god overcometh the
[1:14:02] world and this is the victory
[1:14:05] that overcometh the world even our
[1:14:08] faith

[1:14:14] world that
[1:14:15] seed
[1:14:18] faith seed
[1:14:21] christ in you makes you
[1:14:26] his victory
[1:14:30] amen amen all right
[1:14:35] galatians 3 29 if you'd like to turn
[1:14:37] over there just a moment
[1:14:39] let's look at this a minute and i've got
[1:14:41] some quotes if i can get to a few of
[1:14:43] them we'll try
[1:14:43] before we close here um
[1:14:47] galatians
[1:14:53] 3 and verse 29
[1:14:56] and if you be christ if ye be christ
[1:15:00] then are ye abraham's seed
[1:15:03] faith
[1:15:06] and heirs according to
[1:15:10] the promise
[1:15:15] according to the promise
[1:15:19] now as i said you know when the fullness
[1:15:21] of time was come god sent forth his son
[1:15:24] made of a woman made under the law
[1:15:26] galatians 4 4 the fullness of time came
[1:15:30] he sent his son
[1:15:33] to redeem them that were under the law
[1:15:35] that they might receive the adoption of
[1:15:36] sons
[1:15:39] amen so he came out of him was what
[1:15:42] his bride them
[1:15:47] then she fell and what and in the dark
[1:15:51] ages she went in the ground
[1:15:52] what what came up
[1:15:56] you can't keep life down don't touch my
[1:16:00] oil and wine
[1:16:02] keep your hands off of it see
[1:16:06] and she sprang back up luther
[1:16:09] denominated god pruned it off wesley
[1:16:12] denominated
[1:16:13] i mean is they messy they denominated
[1:16:15] after his message wesley and luther
[1:16:17] didn't
[1:16:18] but those that followed and god just
[1:16:19] pruned it
[1:16:21] off the vine is that right long come
[1:16:24] pentecost
[1:16:26] all under the man age
[1:16:30] luther wesley pentecost was all under
[1:16:32] the man anointing
[1:16:36] amen but now when the seven seals were
[1:16:39] opened
[1:16:41] we've come under an eagle anointing now
[1:16:44] we've come under a word
[1:16:45] for maturity
[1:16:49] amen no longer a man anointing now it's
[1:16:52] under the anointing of the eagle
[1:16:55] revelation of the word amen
[1:16:58] prophetic are you with me
[1:17:03] amen now
[1:17:07] pentecost come out they denominated
[1:17:10] god pruned it off but i'll come the
[1:17:13] eagle
[1:17:14] and i will restore saith the lord
[1:17:17] i'll bring this thing right back to what
[1:17:19] she was in the beginning i will restore
[1:17:21] the original
[1:17:22] faith i will restore that original word
[1:17:26] i will restore that original
[1:17:28] seed will bring it right back to his
[1:17:30] position
[1:17:32] and i've kept this full revelation a
[1:17:34] mystery until this day
[1:17:36] now i'm gonna pull back the seventh seal
[1:17:38] and let you see
[1:17:41] who you are fully
[1:17:44] i'm going to let you come into the full
[1:17:46] revelation of jesus christ
[1:17:48] now let's just go into some of the
[1:17:50] things he said if we can just get into
[1:17:52] this some of this
[1:17:55] he said and the church age you'll
[1:17:57] recognize what i'm saying here
[1:18:00] he said it's the seed
[1:18:04] he said be careful here and see this
[1:18:07] it is not the person that comes
[1:18:09] predestinated eternally from god
[1:18:18] he said it is the word
[1:18:23] or seed
[1:18:27] amen what's a word it's god's thought
[1:18:30] expressed
[1:18:33] but that word first was in him before it
[1:18:36] was expressed it was
[1:18:37] thought is that right god had in his
[1:18:40] own mind eternally his eternal thoughts
[1:18:44] but it had to be expressed
[1:18:48] in order for it to become creation it
[1:18:50] had to be expressed
[1:18:51] so what came eternally from god was
[1:18:54] his own seed
[1:19:01] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:19:04] and that's god if you have eternal life
[1:19:07] dwelling in you
[1:19:07] it showed that you were in god to begin
[1:19:09] with you were a believer to begin with
[1:19:12] you never sinned to begin with
[1:19:16] you were always his to begin with
[1:19:20] amen amen and because you're his
[1:19:24] to begin with and you come down here and
[1:19:26] you are his now
[1:19:27] you're going to live the word for its
[1:19:29] day and hour and
[1:19:34] time
[1:19:37] amen see so here we are he said it is
[1:19:40] the word or the seed that comes
[1:19:41] predestinated eternally from god
[1:19:44] that is it he said that is it
[1:19:48] way back too far way back there
[1:19:51] too far for the human mind to grasp the
[1:19:54] eternal god
[1:19:55] with eternal thoughts
[1:19:59] thought and decreed
[1:20:03] jacob i have levi loved and esau
[1:20:07] have i hated
[1:20:10] other words esau god eternally hated him
[1:20:18] esau didn't have eternal life
[1:20:25] esau was eternally separated from god
[1:20:30] can you say amen all right but
[1:20:34] jacob i loved now how many knows
[1:20:39] that he loved you you can't have the
[1:20:43] love of god in you
[1:20:45] to love him without him first loving you
[1:20:52] and when you go around saying well i
[1:20:53] guess i did this i guess i don't have
[1:20:55] this and i
[1:20:56] be careful you're speaking the flesh
[1:21:00] language the language he wants you to
[1:21:03] speak is what you do have i have his
[1:21:05] perfect will
[1:21:06] i have his life i am him manifested i'm
[1:21:09] the message manifested
[1:21:16] the world doesn't want to hear that and
[1:21:18] neither do a lot of message believers
[1:21:22] but to the saints that's their
[1:21:26] confession
[1:21:28] i know who i am i know that i'm one with
[1:21:32] him
[1:21:33] i know that i am the i am
[1:21:36] i know he said brother david you're just

[1:27:53] they will
[1:27:53] hear what the messenger has already
[1:27:56] received from god and they'll receive it
[1:27:59] and by that they will become the final
[1:28:01] voice

[1:41:38] is his very victory
[1:41:42] and the reason of his death see the
[1:41:44] death
[1:41:45] not in the spirit when he died he only
[1:41:47] died in the flesh
[1:41:48] his spirit went to hell preached to the
[1:41:50] souls in prison that's right
[1:41:52] his flesh only died then he raised it up
[1:41:55] again and quickened it
[1:41:56] quickened means to be made alive his
[1:41:58] fled because i live he said you live
[1:42:00] also
[1:42:02] his flesh which was his body and that's
[1:42:04] the word it's been laying dead for years
[1:42:07] his flesh quickened made alive now watch
[1:42:10] carefully what he says his
[1:42:11] flesh which was his body
[1:42:15] who is the bride brother brown said to
[1:42:17] be his body
[1:42:18] she had to be flesh of his flesh and
[1:42:19] bone of his bone
[1:42:21] she is he said that's the bride
[1:42:25] what makes this mortal flesh his flesh
[1:42:29] because the same spirit that raised up
[1:42:31] jesus christ from the dead dwell in you
[1:42:33] it'll also quicken your mortal body
[1:42:35] identifying that he's redeemed it
[1:42:37] and it's his and he'll bring it subject
[1:42:40] to the word
[1:42:43] if you see that say you have the spirit
[1:42:45] and it quickens you away from that word
[1:42:47] it's not the spirit of god
[1:42:50] he said i'll quicken them to the word if
[1:42:51] that same spirit dwells in you
[1:42:53] then it's then your body's recognized to
[1:42:56] be his
[1:42:57] and he'll raise it up again amen
[1:43:05] all right and
[1:43:08] he said that's the word his body the
[1:43:10] bride
[1:43:11] is that's the word he said she's the
[1:43:13] word it's being
[1:43:15] it's been laying dead for years but it
[1:43:17] gradually began to come in
[1:43:19] in the reformation and now she is
[1:43:22] standing
[1:43:23] upon her feet
[1:43:27] can these bones live again referring to

[1:47:54] of god a living attribute of god
[1:47:56] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:47:58] of god
[1:47:59] in the formation of the bride
