I've Got The Power name of the Lord so Saint and great I shall not be defeated for I've got the power in the name of the Lord he can't defeat the word amen who is this bride anyway she's the word living you know what the Bible said the word living and operative you know the Bible said the word is living is is quick and Powerful that word is living and operative you know what the prophet said he said the bride is the word living and in action amen so you see you see where it is hallelujah so Satan can't defeat the word and that's our standard that's what we stand on that is our standard when the enemy shall come in like a flood you know every day and it it's getting hotter and heavier the battle amen but we have the standardise we have a absolute and that's the word of God let's stand together let's have a word of prayer before we go to the word God bless you brother Jason sister Emmy God bless the songs special and we just thank the Lord for the opportunity to be here and so we greet each other and greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen what a name given among men not another name in among men given whereby we may be saved amen that's his name we live in that name we're abide in that name amen and Satan can't subate that name amen so we're just thankful for it amen let's bow our heads heavenly father as we bow before your presence before you that's present here with us even in us we know that our headship is a kingdom and the kingdom of God is within us and you said seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things Lord shall be added and so father we thank you for life and breath and strength and healing and peace and victory and Lord and refuge and everything that is ours that's promised to us has been purchased for us at Calvary and we have the token of that and Assurance of that that it's our property and Lord we are so thankful for your goodness and bringing us together once again tonight and Lord You've laid a message on My Heart Lord and you know that I've I've I've battled through today with this but Lord believing it's your will to bring it and I pray that you would bless your word and open my mouth and speak things that David dehart knows nothing about but that you would bring forth the word by your quickening power of your spirit that it would Quicken and speak to every individual heart as you see fit to do so and For Your Glory we're not here in vain we've come here Lord by the leadership of your spirit we are here as you've appointed us and thank you for the faith to come we thank you for this now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I'd like you to turn with me to the song of Solomon I want to title this brother Alex if you can get this it's very simple little foxes I want to title this little foxes and I I I I I can subtitle it maybe like this uh consider our ways consider our ways let's consider our ways or consider your way amen this is what we want to do and feeling like the Lord laid this on my heart for this tonight and I I really was heading towards the part two of what we took a Sunday before uh concerning my Revelation and it's not mine obviously I mean individually it's it's the brides but I just felt that I just didn't feel directed that way and and some things come to my heart that were very very much look like that way but the Lord seemed to let lay this in my heart for about 2 months I've had the little message here on my heart and so we just felt like it was the right time maybe the end of the year that we should consider our ways because we don't know what's going out here in the future and we I believe it's going to the battle is going to get hotter and heavier but we remember the victory is greater and so we just we just re believe that some things may happen that you don't understand why and don't have any reason for it but we have an absolute and that's the word of God so let's let's consider our ways through the word of the Lord Jesus and take heed to what's been spoken and by a Vindicated Prophet at our day and and and follow it because it's been proven right and it'll bring if you feed upon it it's going to bring this word to life to you it's going to it's going to bring Quicken it I mean not the message I'm talking about not William ROM but the spirit of that message will bring this word to life because he brought it the Lord brought it amen so in Song of Solomon in in Chapter 2 and reading verse 15 take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the Vines for our Vines have tender grapes how many know this is what those grapes are the little tender grapes are the fruit for the Seas season and so we've got to realize that we have fruit for the season and we've got to stay very Vigilant over the enemy's power and deception amen so you may be seated I have some other scriptures here will read we should consider our ways are we pleasing the Lord by obeying his word you know there's only one way to please him that's through faith and Faith God's faith takes this resting place in the unmovable un unending not defeatable and Eternal Word of God Amen it's going to stand right there and it won't leave that word faith in God will not leave the word so he wants us to believe it and take it and not put our opinion to it not add what we think to it and reason with it don't add to or take away from it amen but Satan will do everything he can if he can to spoil that vine you're the branch on the vine you're the branch if he can get to the vine he'll spoil the branch is that right if he can get if the fox can get to the vine amen the vine what is the vine to you your life yes your Source of Life the vine to you is the quickening spirit you can do nothing without being in that Vine right the vine is the word the vine is the manifested fullness of the root and and you and you can't be complete without the branch and you can't bring the tender grapes without the branch amen so so we want to understand that if the devil can get to that root or to get to that vine and and and work that vine and spoil the vine he can stop fruit from coming and that's what he hates is the fruit for the season but the Bible said in Matthew 4:4 that man shall not live by bread alone is that right but by every word that proceeded from the mouth of God that's what man lives by amen so he gave you and what and man was was meant God made mad in the beginning he created him to be dependent upon God Amen but because we were born and brought into these bodies of sin and come in a in in an under a nature yeah we were come under a nature of sin and until we're born again you'd live under that nature you'd be everything that nature is and that's a sinful nature not to deviate here a little bit but you ever wonder why the badger skin was between the holy and the holiest of holiest is because that old Badger is just like a carnal sin born man arrogant yeah he can he's he can he's has his own way and he wants his own way you know a prophet said that tide of that Badger it laid between the two was your self-will and you had to come through that will you got to die out to that will and and the only way you can die out to it is die out to yourself take the blood amen the only way can go into there into that Holiness of holies is through the blood amen so God God's given us his word and his word is perfect yes and and I was going to come with part two because there's an unfolding behind the badger skin of the word yeah and that's the bride's Revelation yes and so but I've just stop that right now and we'll just not try to go there but the word is perfect yes now in our word of perfect you know we can look at word perfect and say yeah perfect but our our condition our interpretation of perfect is an ending man's interpretation because he can't speak it like God would speak perfect because God's word is eternal amen that's how perfect God is and he's absolutely Flawless there's no shadow of turning with him right there's no darkness in him amen if we're in the light then we're can't walk in darkness and be in light at the same time so every day we have choices in fighting a battle on the battlefield that's right and Satan can you know if you give an if you give the devil an inch he'll take a mile but he comes in inch by inch if you give him an inch you'll take another inch you give one inch you'll take another inch and pretty soon there's several inches and you're out here wondering what happened so I just just Lord just laid in my heart here to just be aware and be attentive to the these little foxes and so there's mandates that God Commandments or directives that God has laid in his word and he expects us to keep it not reason with it not not put our ideas to it don't let the devil bring reasoning and Imagination because he will if he can get you to flirt with him and that's and that that's a spirit of rebellion because the word is perfect right you don't have to wonder about the word the word is absolutely completely Eternal and perfect it'll never fail amen so so we need we should consider our ways are we pleasing the Lord by obeying his word and we obey his word why how just well it's my duty No it should be a love affair between you and God it needs to be it needs to be uh obeyed because you love him and obeyed because it's his word word right you have no other desire in your heart but to believe his word and serve him and you serve him by faith in the word because without faith it's impossible to please him right so we want to obey the word because it's the word we obey it because it's his word and we love him and we will keep his word true love will not go against the word true love can't fail because why it holds the word it rejoices is in the truth amen and so so we want to obey and keep his Commandments because we love him and because we're part of him and we have it in our heart to do so amen and so and so we obey his Commandments and his directives or his mandates because his word is our absolute yesen and we and and when we know that God is the word then we're certain that he's got to keep his word amen there's no failing in God no such a thing as of failing and if and if you're in him how you going to fail if he's in you how can you how can I'm talking about the inward man now how can you fail the outward man will fail every day of fails but see God has made a decision and we talked about this two Sundays ago that by his word he is he is absolutely um uh separated and divided yes I forget that word yeah brought uh divided a Sunder between Soul and Spirit he's showing you who you are and who you're not because you're the spirit of God that's been brought alive in you that's your Revelation that's the bride's Revelation that's the rock that we're on now that rock is offensive to many people yes it but it's not offensive to the bride it's a stumbling to a lot of people because we live by revelation we live by faith we don't live by sight or feelings we live by faith and when we stumble out here if you really know who you are and by the word see who you are and see your name in that book then this outside man they can stumble all want you didn't stumble the outside man May stumble but that was ever your heart's desire or intention to stumble you never had the desire in the first place you're born again you're the word living amen amen and so and so but getting all I don't want to get off my my focus here but it is part of my focus here all right so we we read here don't let those foxes brother brandom said that that every little jot everything you must be faithful in and he said here always the little it's the the the little the little fox that spoils the vine right he said sometimes you leave he said it's not the big things you do it's the little things you leave undone right and Satan is a Master with trying to come in here and just make you just we'll just reason this out a little bit what difference does it make if you do this or you do that the difference it makes is whether the word said to do it or not you see that's one thing he's got to do he's get you off the word he's got you defeated that's what he does he tries to anoint with unbelief that's why he'll try to get you look at what you've done or haven't done or what you said or shouldn't have said but if you ever realize who you really are then you realize this man fails but that inward man is not a weakling right and it can't fail this outside man is a is a failure it's a weakling because Paul even said I glory in my weakness I take pleasure in it because when I'm weak he's strong but when the Bible said when the prophet said don't call yourself weak he was talking about that inside man who you are if not a weakling see we have to we're living by faith not in what we feel not in what we see but who we are praise the Lord Liv so if you live by that you're going to live by the word amen amen because the word is complete and perfect and you're complete in him being in the word you're complete in Him in all things see he can't see you when you come through the blood he only sees one thing he see what the blood produced the life's in the blood and so the token is our message and the token is who we are and everything must come through that blood that's that is that life is our absolute when you come through that life when you come through the blood amen and you receive and you receive the life of that blood or the revelation of Jesus Christ in you yes then that is identifying you as his seed Gene because you couldn't have that Revelation in you without being that seed because he's come to Quicken his word yes and it shows it with laying there ready to be quickened amen amen and so everything he promised you is yours amen you youve come through that so that faith we live by that faith that faith is the substance of the things hoped for amen that faith is the evidence yes that you're in the Rapture you're going to have a body change amen that's exactly what it is because that Faith God's whose Faith remember the Bible said have faith have the Fai have faith in God or other have the faith of God where will the faith of God rest right there in the word he believed his word he spoke it and believed what he said and here we are because we were a part of that word now so don't let the little foxes chase you off of that amen because you're you're are you are the word living yes amen amen so so when you have that that evidence laying in you see God promised a Rapture and everything you have need of when the Holy Spirit comes in and dwells in you everything you have need of for this journey is in you now including the Rapture because the holy spirit in you is the token and that's the faith amen we draw everything through that life right there we have to draw every every little thing comes through the filter right amen that's right so when God said we need to place the token in our households and do what he said to do and get rid of this and get rid of these things clean it up oh well we don't have to do that watch out the little fox reasoning with you amen are you with me yes that's right it's going to be a little fox trying to spoil the vine yes if he can just get at that vine get at that word see the word is where we're standing man shall not live by bread alone but by every word we've got to lay that word we got to hold that word that's our defense yes amen amen is the word when you know you're the word how you going to deny the word care how many mistakes you make out here that is not you in here inside remember there's an outside and an inside man yes remember the word has divided that as yes between spirit and soul brother brandom said you are what's in your soul amen and it declared the real you is the holy spirit in you amen amen there's the word living see Satan can't fight that amen because when you're sealed in he's sealed out yeah amen he can't find you he has to come through the blood to get to you so when you know your position now seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you're going to take every word and make it positive present tense yes I have my healing now how why because he he said so said so yes amen that's right and you be you hold it and you begin to confess what you believe because when the Holy Spirit comes in you have faith when holy spirit's living in you you have the faith of God Amen is that right and you confess what you believe then not what you hope for you're confessing what you believe right amen and what do you believe what has he identified you believe you believe the word all right so don't let that little those it's not the big things you do it's the little things you leave undone remember remember a chain is only strongest at its weakest link so there's things in our lives and brother sister I'm not talking you alone I'm talking to myself also because every we are human and we do and we we allow things to come and we make decisions amen and and Satan he's he's subtle but remember how the Holy Spirit Works he shines the light he exposes something amen and that gives you opportunity to make the correction right right amen are you with me because see people take offense at the light because the light many times comes on their on their on the on the scene it uncover light always uncovers darkness and the Bible said the light of the Lord does make manifest it'll make manifest error it'll make manifest sin something in your life you know something like brother Brown said you hear something creeping along in the darkness to flip the light on yeah and they scatter the light comes comes on the scene for your deliverance right that's what we want to see we want light on the subject yes we put light on the subject we can see we can see we we can be set free and that's what God does he brings light many take offense to that you know and say well he offended me by what what offended you light coming forth to expose Darkness offend you why would it offend you it's for your deliverance it's to expose something that you can see now and walk in this light he doesn't want if you refus to walk in the light you know they had no sin until holy the Jesus said you had no sin until the light come on the scene right right and now exposed your sin and now you have the opportunity to be free but you don't want to be free you want to continue in the darkness and take offense to the light be careful we're not doing that amen cuz when the word comes forth it it brings conviction a real conviction right and shows you where your Heir is yes it didn't come to condemn you it come to free you prise the Lord now the condemnation isn't when you reject it the condemnation is when you turn it down right because he that doeth knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him is sin so when the correction of the word comes and you take offense to that word What Spirit would take offense to the word of God right right well there's only two Powers so I think you can answer that yourself amen because the because the Holy Ghost in you will never will always receive correction of the word always all right amen amen so so we don't want those little foxes at work blessed are they and I was going to read that Revelation 224 and let's turn over there right now Revelations 22 22:14 because the Lord doesn't want us as I said we but we take him at his word because he is the word we take it because it's his command and that's the bride that's the bride's joy and that's her Delight is to follow the word to obey the word right because the Jesus said himself he that loves me will keep my word yes amen Love Will Keep the word amen amen amen so so you just here it says right here Matthew or excuse me Revelation 22:4 blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city blessed is he that keeps his Commandments that do excuse me that do his Commandments yes amen so so you see brother brandom referring to this blessed are they he said after he said that the chain is only strongest that his weakest link he said blessed are they that do that do all the his Commandments of God of God do the Commandments of God that they might have a right to enter in do all God said amen so we want to go in some of the things that kind of people and including myself because I've been there I've done that but thank God for the light on the subject yes amen aren't you happy when God corrects you yes praise the Lord yes correction is not to demean you it's not a condemnation it's Deliverance it's correction God's correction is for your deliverance he'll bring you home see we have to be corrected we have to be trained we're trained we're taught by him and trained by him like a father uh like you you would train your children it's a training not just so much teaching but training I mean I remember when I when I went through my training in flight to to be a pilot my instructor would put me under situations where I learned by training he'd let me make a mistake yeah just to teach me let me go so far and corrected amen and I learned by that I mean I was taught amen and I believe that's the way it is God's Not Afraid for you to make mistakes he already sees you and know knows who you are you're already a part of him the Lord he's not afraid of mistakes and failures because his word is not going to make a mistake and failure but he's going to teach you how to lean on him yesen and so so we want to Let's and I've I've let's be let's go to 1 Samuel we don't want to let down the bars brother sister of anything you know the old poem that brother brandom refers to he said we let down the bars we let down the bars the Sheep got out but how' the goats get in yeah we let down the bars the bar of what the word so we need to sometimes we need to just put the bars back up Let the bar be raised back up amen and so but God has the word for you to to follow to do right and and you don't have to worry about how it's going to be or what it's going to be or how it's going to be fixed or how it's going to work out just do what he said do yes and accept it believe it walk in it he'll take care of the rest of it you take your stand for him and he'll stand for you amen I'm glad we don't have to live here concerned and fearful of what others think it's not what others think what's God think that's right our brother said here that Satan may have the have all your mistakes and errors in record but God doesn't have a record yeah praise the Lord is that right our our attorney our judge our attorneys become our judge our judge and attorney said case is dismissed yes sir he just said Satan said look at this record he says I don't have a record what record yeah see the blood has completely wiped that out amen right amen amen and you stand perfectly before him and your Future's clear you say well you don't make any more I'm not talking about mistakes I'm talking about the future yeah your future is clear in the word yeah all the way clear on to the to the the Rapture it's all clear because you're in Christ you're going to be you're going to be tested and tried God loves to test his children but the testing and trials isn't for the the evil or bad it's to get you home yes sir amen right Hallelujah so 1st Samuel 15 1 Samuel well I got to find 1 Samuel here I know it's there all right 1 Samuel 15 and I'd like this is where this is where of course he the Lord commanded Saul to go out and kill was an Amic I think it was let me see here but the point I want to make here um no AAG king of am amalekites right the amalekites destroy them completely destroy them don't leave child nothing left just go out and slay them all and of course Saul in his reasoning now that was the word of the Lord yes are you with me that was the Mandate God made right there that was his command that was his directive yes but the king reasoned with it and because of the fear of the people because he wanted to please the people over and above the word that become an idol that's idolatry that's an idolatry Spirit which is stubbornness let's read it here in verse 23 for Rebellion is the sin of Witchcraft Rebellion now these are strong words yes but they apply as much today as they did yesterday probably even more so today because Rebellion is the sin is is as as the sin of Witchcraft a witchcraft is listening to the devil yes a witch will will be in have intercourse with Satan yeah I'm talking about communion with him listening to him he's being directed by the devil and so he's he's divining but God doesn't want us divining our way right and Rebellion Rebellion is open resistance to lawful Authority that's what Rebellion is an open resistance to lawful Authority and there's only one true lawful Authority that we need to hear and receive and that's God's word that's a word of our Lord and he didn't do that did he you know the story you know how it goes he he he reasoned with it and yet told told Samuel I've done what God Said then why do I hear the Lo of animals and why this and why that and how come I see this King still alive well we kept the better for sacrifice does god require sacrifice over obedience to his word right see no he doesn't it's better to obey isn't that right so let that come down to our hearts tonight it's better to obey then put an idol up there of what you think and what people think and what you reason with because when you begin to reason against the word you're flirting with the devil if begin to reason with the word watch I I've got a quote here if you want me to read it Christ wants his wife pure with the word the that's the way she must be this is the third seal okay that's the way she must be because nothing not one jot or one TT will pass from that law that book till it's all finished Jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away Matthew 24:35 my word shall never pass away don't put any interpretation to it don't put any interpretation to it God knows how to lead you and direct you yesen amen he knows how to keep you and he's given you his word you say well I love the Lord and I will obey him then what about the scripture here yeah because the fruit you're living is not bearing out that scripture the Holy Ghost will bear witness to his word yes amen now I'm not condemning anyone please understand I'm just talking about a little fox that wants to come into real Believers lives and try to get you off the word even to simple things like keeping the speed limit I'm going to come on home now I listen I you say well that doesn't make any difference but it doesn't I've got some word here that makes a difference right amen because we've got a mandate by God you're to obey those in authority over you as long as it agrees with the word are you with me then if you don't and you reason about it then it's a little fox he watch these little foxes it's these little things you let go undone okay so he said now he want he said don't you put no interpretation to he wants the pure unadulterated not even he wants you pure he wants his bride pure and unadulterated not even a flirt yes I wouldn't want my wife flirting with some other man right wives submit yourselves to your husbands I I'm going to amen it regardless whether you do or not why submit yourselves to your own husbands that's the word of God well I'll have you know my husband just doesn't believe like I do or this or that or some other reason you can give it didn't say whether you had a reason wives submit yourselves to your own husbands all right husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it is that right now what about that that's as much the word of God as the other ones we're coming down home this morning tonight and I I don't like to preach like this praise Lord I've got to though you've got to I I'm looking we're looking at the New Year we're not turning a new Leaf we're saying Lord help me I will not compromise with your word I don't care how bad it gets I don't care how much it looks radical to my way of thinking right I'm going to keep your word because it's your word amen and I love you and I know you love me and I have one desire Lord search me try me if you find anything in my life that's outside of your word I want to be corrected and Lord help me to quickly ask you to forgive me and turn around and go the way of the word and leave it there in the word and God will take care of it do you believe he'll take care of his word amen he's testing you to see if you'll believe him amen amen all right he said I wouldn't want my wife flirting with some other other other man and when you go to listening to any kind of reasoning beyond that word you're listening you're flirting with Satan amen Rebellion is as a sin of Witchcraft we don't want that Spirit around us we don't want that rebellious Spirit around I I'm not saying you do it intentionally but oh how the devil likes to come in and reason with us on things and you know good and well this is what the word said about it but because of your reasoning and the appearance of what it may be to your thinking and what others may think about it you turn to that instead of the word you've added your own thinking to it and you created your own Idol anything that stands between you and that word is an idol amen that's right you build your little image and this is what you'll walk in here's the word saying don't do it right or the word saying do it and used to be a reason why it shouldn't be done and why you shouldn't do it you have no reasoning to add to that amen amen amen all right consider our ways tonight let us all consider our ways am I obeying you fully Lord am I have I done all that you have asked me to do am I following and obeying every word that comes out of the mouth of God man shall not live by bread alone but every word amen all right so stubborn Rebellion is the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as the as is as iniquity and idolatry you see he wouldn't he just was stubborn Saul was stubborn then I'm going to have my own way you say well he might not come right out and said that but that's the fruit he was bearing I'm going to have my own way no matter what the word says I heard what Samuel said but I'm King how many times have we lifted up our own self as an idol put our own self there put our own self there in front of it and bow to that instead of bowing to the word God help us we bow to our feelings we bow to our reasoning we bow to our imagination we bow to anything the devil can get you to believe through your senses contrary to the word right and we bow to that thing and that becomes idolatry yes a spirit of idolatry I'm not calling you an idolatrous but it's the spirit of idolatry if you continue with that what's going to happen little by little you've gone off the path you got out of step and he screamed get back in Step yes stay in step with the word amen now there's many many things that we could talk about tonight that little foxes will come in and keep you away from I'm going to mention a few that okay I'm going to mention a few as we go along here now but you're flirting with Satan when you you go any kind of reasonings beyond that word beyond that simple straightforward perfect Flawless yes word there's nothing as perfect as it that's right as I said in our human capacity of what's perfect can't touch it it's perfect eternally perfect you can't get any clearer perfect than that all right okay and though I'll just let you know Satan knows good and well the word is what created him yeah and the word is what will destroy him that's why he hates the word that's why he'll do everything against the word if he can get you from believing that word simply simply simply believing and taking God at his word as long as you stay behind that word Satan can't touch it right can't touch you he can't touch anything but if you can bust a hole through the word like he did Eve through is the reasoning and what she saw and what she feel what she seen and here let me tell you what he meant and need look up big beautiful creature to him and had more knowledge than what her husband did hello all right and if we ever have a day we have today that's Back to Eden again yes and that's just how subtle he is and he tries to tries to get you to disbelieve and he said why you're a Believer you're a Christian but he then injects his religious knowledge in and above the word yes okay I think you get the part of that let's go on you stay right with the word you he want you to stay unadulterated you stay right with that word unadulterated don't you commit adultery with that Spirit fornication and adultery with another man another Spirit you have one Spirit to obey and one to follow and that's the word of God it's not just a letter to you it is the Spirit of the Living God in you and that spirit will obey that word so go back to what you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so what are you thinking in your heart is who you are Satan not coming there he's coming out here to this man of reasoning and you've got either accept it or reject it you the word has to accept it or reject it that inside man's got to accepted or rejected it's not the outside man rejecting or accepting right you either give a channel for it and you close the door how you going to close the door resist the devil and he won't just walk away he'll get away quickly just resist him turn him down this is what the word said this is what I believe this is my absolute get away from me Satan I'm not going there I'm not accepting those thoughts you must cha you must challenge the devil on the battlefield and take the word over him amen all right so now nobody's lifting thems up and say one I'm you know I David Dean Hart's bigger than somebody else no way shape or form we're all in the same boat but if you're born again we are too also in the same ship we have Fellowship yes amen I'm wanting you to see what you are who you are and that you have authority over anything that's contrary to the word is your enemy I don't care what form it comes in it's your enemy anything contrary to that word any flirting around with something contrary to the word oh how the devil's a master and say well you know if you don't if you don't do this you don't love them and you're flirting with the word contrary to the word letting a Spirit come in that would lead you away from that word either you're not born again or you need to wake up because the Holy Spirit Will discern that that's right the Holy Spirit Will discern what's the right spirit and not the right spirit and you will correct yourself because he'll keep it corrected but if you don't see that Spirit there's something wrong but there's others that do and when it's brought to you and puts light on the pathway you take offense to it why because there's a devil in there rebelling against the word boy that was strong but that's what it is it's the same as witchcraft all right all right now you just can I'm not just reading the word to you here it's a sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is Iniquity and idolatry because you're accepting what you think over and above what the word said all right because thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord he hath also rejected thee from being King don't compromise with the word the spirit today is compromised yeah you can live between the two Realms you can't you're either going to live in the word live in the light walk in the light or you're walking in darkness you can't be a double-minded man you either have the mind of Christ or you don't have the mind of Christ that's right amen yes sir amen either it's the word or it isn't the word there's no in between no compromise amen and Satan does not want you compromising with a a a a denominational spirit I don't care how much of the message they claim to believe if it's denominational if it's a wrong spirit and it's not leading you it's leading you to a a system of man instead of the word revealed for the hour and season the fruit of the Season get away from it as quick as you can amen and let me just come right back and say the holy spirit in you will discern that amen you see brother and sister I wish I could explain to you what I believe don't we all how many would say I wish everybody could I wish I could explain to you you can't explain this no more than nothing you can't give it to anybody you can't give Revelation to somebody else amen that's right you can't do it right oh I won't I just something I was going to say but I'll just go I'll go off in the other message if I do that so anyway let's let's stop right here stubbornness okay witchcraft okay listening to the devil Mark 12:13 let's go over there just a moment before we go any further as I've already I've already quoted this but I want to see it I want you to see it there's many places in the scripture this is Mark there's places in in Matthew Mark 12 but they came to Jesus and this is Mark chap 12 and I want verse 13 and they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words Bo the devil likes to do that yeah doesn't he though I I'd like to catch him in his words and when they were come and you know there's good people that do that sad good people don't even realize what SP they're walking by catch him in his words and when they were come they say unto him Master we know that thou art true no they didn't they didn't know that they didn't believe that right Thou Art true and regardest and regardest not the person of men and teach us the way of God and truth and why didn't they believe it why didn't they walk in it here they're confessing something that why Jesus said you my Hypocrites yeah you don't believe that no more than nothing you don't believe my words are truth you'd follow it right well we be not be of adultery John 8 he said you are because you can't hear my word if God were your father you'd hear my word you'd receive it that's right the evidence of the Holy Ghost is have an ability by God to receive and hear the word for the season yes and we've turned a corner this is bride time this is seed time yes this is Rapture hour Rapture raptured age moves on for the bride not the church the bride amen hallelujah all right so he said now you don't care about the person of men but teaches the way of God and Truth is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not or we could even say is it lawful now that was tribute cuz when when Rome or a country would defeat another one they they made him pay tribute to them okay but the same things are applying to taxes is it lawful to pay taxes or not well I don't I believe that I believe the Constitution says it's against the Constitution for them to even charge us taxes I say Amen to that but Caesar said whether you understand it or not all right Caesar says to pay certain certain amount can you imagine Joseph with Mary knowing she was Buri and and about to deliver had to make a trip to Bethlehem on the part cause of taxes because they required taxes but they gave Caesar what Caesars right cuz it wasn't against God's word for them to go down to Bethlehem and pay taxes amen all right are you with me see because Luke told us the story I won't go there but he it told us the story and here's what he here's what he said but all things are for ordained of God that work together for good to them love him do you believe that tonight all things work together for good to them that love God do you not know he knew beforehand I'd be running out of ink and I would all these other things see do you not know that he knew that yeah do you not know that he knew you'd be sitting here tonight what your thoughts are in your mind right now do you not know that the attitude you take toward the word right here Will May determine you're Eternal Destiny attitude's a big thing at atude creates atmosphere a right mental attitude is a powerful powerful thing because just the attitude can judge you the Judgment whether you get eternal life or no what attitude you take toward the word of God and bride form boy that's right all right see so here they are God knew all about it was and brother brother said it was ordained of God that there should be a heartless King in that day and a blood thirsty Herod God knew all about it God knew about the taxes and how brutal government did not have no thoughts of Mercy on that poor mother and was just ready about about ready ready to about to deliver her firstborn son in a few days but he commanded that they should come to the native their native birthplace and pay taxes no matter what condition she's in she's got to come anyhow God knew all about that he fornew all things and he knew all things see and he makes everything work together together for good so what' they do they went because it was God's command now we're going to come to that you say Where's that in the Scripture it was God's command that they obey that King oh I've got the scripture amen because God has put powers in place and if you don't obey those Powers now I'm not talking about anything contrary to the word because the Bible said and I just read it to oh I didn't read it to you did I I didn't finish it but the Bible said to give Caesar what Caesars give God what's God is that right if you don't listen to those powers and do what they say and you want to rebel against it you are rebelling against God's word himself because he put that power over you to see what you'd do and he said obey it so I want to get to these scriptures before we get a finish here and so so let's just hurry now let's go back to Mark so they tested him they were trying him is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not shall we give or shall we not give but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why tempt ye me why tempt the word yeah bring me a penny that I may see it and they brought it and he saith to them who is this inscription who is this image excuse me and superscription and they said unto him Caesars and Jesus answered and said un them render to Caesar the things that are Caesars and to Gods the things that are gods and they marveled at him regardless of what you think about it regardless of what I think about it and the Holy Ghost if he's in you will know what's the word and not the word and when he said to obey it he means for you to obey it if you don't obey it you've disobeyed him boy that's powerful I know but we're talking about little foxes because I don't know what this year is going to bring and there may be some very strange things happen that they may up and mandate and up and and and make law I don't know a mandate is a command or directive whether it be by a governor or this or that it's a mandate it's not a suggestion it's a mandate that's right and you are under the word under the authority of the word to obey that as long as it's not going against the word amen now I can give you instances where it did go against the word the four Hebrew children refused to Bow before the Idol because it was against the word but it was the command of a king but it was against the word and so they refused to Bow before the idol of William brandham well you say William Brown yeah it was it was Daniel that time but what is it today instead of looking in on what he what the word unsealed and look in a white stone that had no writing and he said look in on this they decided to follow the prophet that was their image that was who they were following instead of looking in on what was be revealed to them what was to be opened and he said I've got to go west to get the interpretation of this Unwritten word in Revelations 10 and I met that Mighty Angel up there and he told me and he had the seven seal and I had to go there to get it and I had to come back and I had that open that word had to be open that John knew what it said think of that and where was it hidden it was hidden in the mountain the stone cut out of the mountain it was hid in the mountain this is what the bride you see what I'm saying is this they didn't look in on it right they didn't keep their eye on it they kept their eye on a man and today that spirit's just as strong and it's an idolatrous Spirit that's exactly what it is I'll tell you what it is you want me to tell you what it is it's a dominating Catholic spirit it's a dominating female Spirit to dominate over the word amen and the bride won't give into that spirit because she has discernment of what that spirit is she has one thing to let dominate her and that's her headship which is a kingdom and the kingdom of God in you will not leave this word amen because it'll receive it by Revelation that's why God hid it from others and would receive it reveal it to babes that was God's dividing Point Abel probably said I can't explain Cain why God did this and Cain came to him and said don't you know the seventh seal is not opened oh my and don't you understand you say Brother David you shouldn't have said that I am exposing a spirit you're meeting the same thing today the same thing I don't know those people or what they do or what they don't do that's none of my business but what was said is contrary to the word it's contrary to the word that doesn't mean I don't like the person it don't mean I don't pray for the person but what they said right amen contrary to the word because it has been opened and if it hadn't been open we couldn't see who we are behind that Veil we would never come to the full complete revelation of Jesus Christ this is the hour for the complete revelation of himself to be finished and it's the unveiling of all these loose ends that brought the mystery to Revelation and we can enter in now and see who we are fully that's right amen amen now if that offends you it wasn't me that did that because I'm speaking truth amen it's not that it's that word that light then you need to search the scriptures the Bible Jesus even said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me and if it testified of him it's got to testify of the Bride for you're in the same Revelation that's right amen search the scriptures you want to know who Jesus Christ isday you want to see the son of man search the scriptures you're going to find him in Bride form praise the Lord Brother I tell you that's getting pretty stiff but that's the truth it amen I wouldn't flirt with it at all in fact the opposite the word says the opposite right the word says for you to get away from it not keep flirting with it because be careful it can be little foxes that's exactly right amen now you say you have no right I have every right to say this I'm a servant of Jesus Christ I am here to give his thoughts in a word and it's for the purpose of delivering and setting a bride free every Minister that ministers the word for this season will put a bride in the Rapture we're not preaching our own thinking we are not giving our own thoughts we're saying what's already been said because the bride is the final voice to this final age whether you like it or don't like it that's right that's right that's none of my business how you want to react to it's none of my business whether you can even receive it or not is not my business my business is to give it to you absolutely to preach it amen amen we need to get their eyes off of how people react to it realize we don't have any responsibility of that or they accept it or not it's God that has to quick it to them but we are commanded by God to preach the truth so let's go on can you give me just a little bit more just a little bit all right watch let's be sober be vigilant okay so he said you give Caesar what's Caesar brother brandom said the same thing and we'll come into it real quick here be sober be vigilant that's first Peter 58:7 be sober be vigilant for your for the for your the devil goeth about as a roaring lion seeking whom may may devour is that right right all right he said be sober then be vigilant be on guard be very active be very every moment Vigilant all right now Philippians 4:6 and in verse 7 of that same chapter said casting all your care upon him for he carth for you all right then you come down to the scripture in in in Philippians 4:6 says be careful for nothing what's that word careful mean anxious yeah anxious nervous fearful be careful be anxious for nothing but by prayer and supplication make your request known unto God with Thanksgiving how's that yeah I think I just dis qued that just a little bit let me go over there just a minute Philippians 4:6 all right right here no oh Philippians I'm in Colossians okay just a minute here I'm nervous thinking we're just late and I got to get hurry and I watch this be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God and the and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus amen cast all your care don't give an inch to the enemy as we already said amen how do I get rid of a stubborn Spirit he said one thing stubbornness is not of God Amen I I just it's not of God and the only way you can get away from that is you have to have faith to overcome that that's if you are a Christian you are a son or daughter of God whichever you may be and you will never be able to stand and just rebuke it rebuke it and rebuke it it's just like tantalizing a rattlesnake just laying there ready to bite you if you just ignore him and walk away from him he can't hurt you amen and we have these things in our lives usually comes my grandparent mother father he said it's usually caused by a complex but you're fighting against it you're battling it but you're Victorious brother sister this word bride is his very Victory amen he we have Victory do you realize you are Victory yourself you are living in Victory amen yeah this person that you are that birth word on the inside of you is the revelation of Jesus Christ and there no failure in him amen who are you you're that person you see the baptism made way for that person to come into manifestation full manifestation back to the word again and that's what he's trying to say tonight back to the word again he's brought us back we had a message in this hour to bring us back to the word again all right let's go a little quicker I'll bypass some of this now we know what 2 Corinthians 10:5 said the Warfare is not carnal but spiritual right casting down of imaginations and any High thing that exalts itself against the word of God you bring in subjection to the word you're bringing every thought under obedience to Christ amen that's your absolute to Christ yes amen don't and you say well how I can do that you have the absolute ability to bring every thought under obedience to Christ if you're born again believer you've been given the ability by God to do that that's your mandate that's your Authority amen and the word is in your mouth amen you will know that the word in the mouth of believing Christians never failed you know that do you realize that when a born again man takes that word and puts it upon his lips it's the same as deity speaking Yeah do you realize that he gave you that Authority you speak the word and I'll perform it where's the sword I'm glad he showed us who we are we realize we're that Living Word here in this Soul we've got two Natures out here in the same body and they're fighting one another but that one Nature has already come to overcome the other nature and the other nature of the flesh is your enemy but he's a defeated enemy amen and the Bible said he would bring this word inside of me this this word this Living Word will bring my body under obedience to that word and bring it subject to the word amen all right don't let down the bars don't let down the bars now don't compromise with unbelief don't reason with it do what the word says and God will take care of the rest you stand for him he'll stand for you don't take away or add to the word it's perfect let's go to Titus I want to get through these scriptures and I'm going to close I just may have to read through them Titus Chapter 3 Verse one put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to to every good work what did it just say to do put them in mind Titus is saying you put them in mind to obey to be sub to principalities and powers and Obey magistrates well amen amen all right and to be ready to every good work how do you have a good work by Believing on him whom God has sent the word the Son of God the never failing Lord our Lord yes receiveing amen all right all right let's go to another scripture if that's not enough let's go to another one Romans 13 Romans the 13th chapter and the first verse let's start reading let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of God yes yes okay now that just settles it right there okay let's he put the Power there he knew what you'd come under today he knew what struggles you'd go through with those Powers yes is that right it may work against your your feelings it may work against your I don't like to do that therefore I'm not going to do it be careful that you're not disobeying the higher power that God put there because if you turn that down and disobey you've disobeyed the word of God as long as that thing doesn't take you in a contrary to the word you are under mandate by God's Own word to obey it and do it whether you like it or whether you don't like it you say you're just making fun of our feeling no I'm not making fun of your feelings I'm showing you the word God's concerned about this because if you don't little foxes are somewhere okay let's go a little further he said I'm reading on whosoever therefore resisteth the power that he's put ordained resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation because what about judgment when it's taken before you and say you had the you had the order there and you just willfully went against my word how's he going to be judged right he's going to ask you why why didn't you obey it it was my word well you could give him every reason you wanted to you think that's going to stand you think that's going to hold up under the white Throne God expects his people you say well we don't believe in just rituals and on we don't make this message a book of rules and regulations I'm not I've already said this is a love affair and this is our husband's word wives bride who are we subject to are you with me yes all right I got got to hurry now watch let's go a little 13 verse three for rulers are not a terror to Good Works see rulers are not a teror to good works but to the evil wil thou then be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have Praise of the same all right for he is the minister watch what this power that God's ordained here he is the Minister of God to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the Minister of God can you imagine God telling you that this ungodly magistrate out here that he's put in power over you and this policeman or this author of this mayor or this Governor or president or is a minister of God to you and I let me say it again well Brother David I have better judgment than he does I know better I don't care what you know better the word said obey him now you can sit here and reason all you want with what I'm saying not going to do you a bit of good because here's the word why put your own thinking in it just do it as long as it do against the word yes I'm I'm making what do you call that brother Paul when he when you say he makes a something for it you know here it is but as long as it doesn't leave the word because the word what is your absolute yes this this power is not your absolute but it is your absolute as long as it don't disagree with the word you better obey it because God's told you if you don't you're disobeying me all right I know I I told you it's could to be a little straight I didn't tell you but I'm telling you now all right so he's a minister of God a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil wherefore you must needs to be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake for this cause for for this cause pay ye tribute also and they are God's ministers attending continually upon this very thing do you not believe God has so much full control that he knows what to put before you and give power over you what is our place do good render good well somebody's back there and say if I was you I would just do what I have a right to do why are you obeying that I wonder where the little fox is there be careful that we don't Rebel because of our own reasoning because of God Satan trying to use our reasoning right stay with the word stay with the word all right now watch he's just goes on here render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom Fear To whom fear honor to whom honor all right first Peter two I better just get quickly here quick I got to read quick you listen fast okay 1 Peter 2 13 submit yourself to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be the king as supreme or as unto Governors or unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well for so is it the will of God that in well-doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your Liberty as a cloak of maliciousness but as a Servants of God honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God honor the king said if you speak if you speak evil of those that he put above you spoke evil of him be careful we don't speak evil of those that God put in Authority we may not like Trump we may not like Biden but be careful you don't speak evil we may not like the mayor we may not like the governor we may not like what they do who said we didn't say not said you didn't have to like it or dislike it but there's one thing you have to do obey God yes now if they make a suggestion okay I don't have to I can or I can't but when they say you've got to do it when they make a command or when they make a decree and say that everybody's got to do this and we're putting it under law you may disagree or agree but are you in agreement with the word right that's the line we've got that's where we told brother sister yeah because otherwise you're putting your own thinking to it right okay now let's just I'll by bypass here if I can you know even act even even Paul over in the book of Acts he the high priest commanded he was standing judgment before him and and the high priest commanded somebody to Smite Paul in the face and he and he's commanded him to do it and Paul said God smite thee thou whed wall this is where I said about speaking evil of your rulers he said God smite thee thou Whited wall you tell him to smite me contrary to the law and you say you obey the law and he and you told him this might be contrary to the law boy Paul Paul believed keeping the law too in fact his own words said us to do it see but then they said how ralst thou the high priest he said sir I'm sorry I didn't realize he was high priest because the Bible said not to speak evil of the governor of your people or those in authority over you see see see oh I feel like just telling him like it is what right does he have to do this and make me wear this and do that and this and he has every right as long as he doesn't leave the word oh my it's quiet in here all right that's all right you're thinking now we could go to Titus we could go to acts we did 1 Timothy 6 one now it goes down into servants obey your masters Colossians 3: 17 it says servants obey your masters not just to the not just to the kind ones I just got to stop but you know where that scriptures are you obey your masters Masters don't you mistreat your servant CU God watching is a master you can go back in there it's in Colossians it's in it's in Timothy servants obey you got a problem with your job just start obeying your master I don't care you just do your job and do it as unto the Lord and all you do do it as unto the Lord and give your very best and your fullest to the Lord and do it as unto the Lord and God will honor you working for that employer your servant is an employee amen are you with me yes if you want to find that I believe it in 1 Timothy in 1 Timothy 6 1 yeah many of servants that are under the Yoke Count Their Own Masters worthy of all honor that the name of God and his Doctrine be not blasphemed amen and they that have believing Masters let them not despise them because they are Brethren other words don't try to get by with things see but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit and if any teach otherwise and sent not to Wholesome words even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the doctrine which is according to Godliness see he is proud and knows nothing and he's doting about questions and strives of words wherefore cometh Envy Strife railings evil surmisings perverse disputings of men corrupt Minds destitute of truth supposing that gain is godliness from such turn away on and on we could read read Colossians when you get home Matthew 17:24 said Peter Go cast your hook you got a hook in your pocket Go cast it in and let lest we offend this government not paying tribute you go cast the hook in I've got a fish ordained with a coin in his mouth I put it there and you're going to catch him and you go pay the tax and you pay the tribute for us brother Braham said see God makes a way he didn't want to have to pay those taxes he said I don't believe those taxes I owe were Caesars it was God's money but nevertheless he said God had a way and showed me a way to do it and he said nevertheless lest we offend them he took him right back to that scripture Matthew 17 lest we offend them we cause struggle we try to have Strife Les we do that go pay it I provided the money go pay it brother sister I've been a witness to that over the years once twice many times amen you just do what God says do he'll take care of the rest of it now okay I've got to I've got to stop I've really gone over time no I haven't because who determines long man or God all right okay let's just go on here I'm going to say this to a person this person looking at a person he looking at right at him in his congregation I was asked by a fine boy the other day was hunting squirrels that morning I got five I left one of them for the afternoon you can only get six in the state of Kentucky that's the limit so this person said I got nine Christian boy said I got nine fine kid I said you done wrong you did wrong he said well I said I had five that morning saved the one the afternoon but I got the one squirrel looked up the tree counted five I said I walked through there and not and not long ago and there was 15 or 20 sitting there I just took l walked away and left the rest of them I said if you come to this country preaching if I come to this country preaching to you boys and you people here the thing that's right I've got to live that example Christianity what you say it's what you live what you do it's an example you're the salt of the earth I said the law said Jesus said you give Caesar them things that belong to Caesar you break that speed law there what are you doing you're doing wrong you sin now your reasoning says well they allow five or 10 over but that's not the law the law is 55 45 35 65 7085 80 and who are you to go over it I'm L what he said about the speed law I got some more I said okay he said well the law is wrong I can't help how wrong it is it's wrong to break Jesus commandment if you don't give Caesar things that Caesar you did what Jesus told you not to do and transgression of the law is sin when you know to do right and do good to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not is sin we're all guilty we do it when you see you're wrong stop it people are are watching you people won't go to church but they'll read you and see what you do your written epistle right yesterday coming in a car and drove for two days from Tucson here right 2,000 miles Billy and I and so we that that wasn't breaking any speed laws we stayed right I sat there if he's driving I have my fist rolled back like a shotgun and a hammer back I see him go over I said wait a minute boy give Caesar what Caesars let the wall get built back up Daniel kep it you can't pray to nobody but the king for this one month did he stop no no he prayed to his Lord why command of God what about taking communion what about the three Commandments outward physical Commandments at you're to keep you say you're a Believer and a Christian why don't I don't know who I'm talking to I don't think anybody's here doesn't take it there are those that don't I say why not it's God's command if you love the Lord and you know he's in your heart it's an outward manifestation that you're a part of God you love God and you're a part of the body to take it any other wise with that word being in you you're taking it unworthily and if you don't take it it shows that you don't accept what God Said and if you do take it unworthily you bring damnation to yourself now go back into communion 1965 and see what he said you're taking it because it's a genuine Revelation to you that you're a part of him and you're I'm a part of you and you're a part of me and we take it together as a revelation of that in our hearts showing forth that we were went with him through death went with him and went with him and raised with him in Resurrection we are partakers and you say you believe this hour and believe the message then you say what about foot washing can and communion amen is that right what's the third one water baptism yeah and you're taking water baptism because the Revelation to you that Christ died for you and bore your infirmities on Calvary and your and your sin and you're showing to the world you believe that and willing to die with him and and and show resurrect with him is that right and it works righteousness you'll do that sincerely and see what same thing with communion I'm not going to go there I could say a lot I could read some quotes out of there but I'm not going to do it now we're told give Caesar what Caesar I'm closing and I've closed stand with me Hallelujah I can say a lot more there's a lot more to be said but you know what I think the message has got through I think so amen is that right I believe it's got through what are you going to do when the Bible said don't wear those pants what are you going to do when the Bible said don't cut your hair not brother Bram said not even a lock of it you cut it you might as well shave it off that's another one of his Commandments we could go a lot of his Commandments don't you let that fox come in and turn you away from those Commandments because you're afraid of what somebody's going to feel like and say you're wearing those ungodly clothes that draw men's attention to your frame and by doing so you're committing adultery because they're going to lust for you I don't care how much of the message you say you believe right amen that's that's the word of God now what are you going to do about it so tight like you're poured into them and they can't they see every shape you make I know I'm speaking very clear might as well speak clearer than trying to hide behind the wall that's right Holiness is more than just a saying Holiness is a life amen and it's not ungodly the Holiness of God is not ungodly you walk down this these aisles and you come out there like you're trying to live between two Realms compromising with the world you are flirting with the devil wake up turn to the word there's where your Liberty lays there's where your life is yes Lord Jesus you know this message is the truth I know it's the truth you know it's the truth I spoke your word just as you gave it to me Lord I will have to stand at judgment someday and answer for what I've said and I believe with all my heart it's absolutely the truth may you open their hearts to receive and to hear it and to take and change their way and change and move and just repent sorrowful what they have allowed to come in for they allowed it your word gives them victory over it Lord forgive us all how we've let that fox many times Lord but father you're rich in Mercy and you keep bringing the word to us and bringing it to us and enlightening us enlightening put your finger on this put your finger on that just put your finger on these things Lord and thankful for the inside of us say Lord forgive me I don't want to do that brother Brown said that's your Prophet said that's the real Holy Ghost that'll line up with the word that will ask forgiveness one forgiveness seek forgiveness and forgive those that trespassed against them and they won't hold grudges against one another Lord we're not out here to play around we're not here to play Church we're not here to compromise and see how close we can live to the world and still believe we say claim to believe the message I don't care whether it's in clothes we wear or any any other way Lord father who we are is really coming out in private and where's these husband that'll let their wives do those things Lord touch their life let them see surely they can see if they have any discernment at all and Lord what about the forsaking of ourselves and our assembling together what about this Idol of our jobs and our thing we think we have to be away from the word we've just created an idol we're bowing to it Lord let us take our stand and take and say no I'm not going to do this anymore I'm taking God at his word I'm putting the word first let the consequences be what they are but you'll honor your word father you will honor
