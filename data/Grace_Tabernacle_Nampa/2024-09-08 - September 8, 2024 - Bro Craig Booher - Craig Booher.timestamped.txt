[30:18] see them making fun of each other and um

[1:00:20] liberty but we all with an open face

[1:00:27] Lord are changed into the same image
[1:00:31] from glory to glory amen even as by the
[1:00:37] spirit of the Lord amen Exodus chapter
[1:00:41] 23 brother if you could I I don't want
[1:00:44] to hurt the congregation that'll be
[1:00:46] counterproductive but if you can give me
[1:00:48] a little more here I'm one of those
[1:00:50] preachers that like the monitors hot it

[1:01:23] 23:20 everybody there amen amen
[1:01:27] behold I send an angel before thee to
[1:01:30] keep thee in the
[1:01:32] way and to bring thee into the place
[1:01:35] which I have prepared yes thank you Lord
[1:01:39] I want to speak this morning on changed
[1:01:42] from glory to glory amen anyone have a
[1:01:46] need you'd like to lift before the Lord
[1:01:49] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:01:51] Lord for this atmosphere that we step
[1:01:53] into knowing Lord that you are the the
[1:01:56] one to be glorified in our midst and the
[1:01:58] only provided place of worship is in
[1:02:01] Christ Jesus so Lord we are asking Lord
[1:02:04] you take us up into Heavenly places and
[1:02:07] Lord May the spirit of God have
[1:02:08] preeminence and may there be Liberty for
[1:02:11] you to speak to every heart Lord we are
[1:02:13] like human beings like magnets Lord that
[1:02:16] would pull mistakes our way and pull
[1:02:20] trouble our way but Lord you are the one
[1:02:22] that guides us through this world so we
[1:02:25] pray wash Us in the blood of Jesus
[1:02:27] Christ and may we walk in the spirit of
[1:02:30] God Lord give us Mana from heaven we
[1:02:32] pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[1:02:36] God bless you you can have your seats
[1:02:37] thank
[1:02:44] you here in Exodus 23: 20 it says behold
[1:02:49] I send an angel before thee to keep thee
[1:02:53] in the way and to bring bring thee into
[1:02:57] the place that I have prepared amen
[1:03:02] praise the Lord God has not left us
[1:03:05] alone but he sent an angel to lead us
[1:03:08] into the promises of God and we know
[1:03:11] that there is a direct parallel between
[1:03:14] the Old Testament and the New Testament
[1:03:17] we know that God did not send an angel
[1:03:20] to the old and withhold from the new but
[1:03:23] that actually that angel as we
[1:03:25] understand in the scriptures we can
[1:03:27] follow from Genesis to
[1:03:29] revelations in Nehemiah 9:12 just to get
[1:03:33] our footing here Nehemiah 9:12 says
[1:03:37] moreover thou lest them in the day by a
[1:03:41] cloudy pillar and in the Night by a
[1:03:44] pillar of fire to give them light in the
[1:03:48] way wherein they should go isn't that
[1:03:51] wonderful in verse 19 of the same
[1:03:54] chapter it says yet thou was in thy
[1:03:57] manifold mercies yet thou in thy
[1:04:00] manifold mercies forsook us them not in
[1:04:03] the wilderness and the pillar of cloud
[1:04:06] departed not from them by day to lead
[1:04:09] them in the way neither the pillar of
[1:04:12] Fire by night to show them light and the
[1:04:16] way that they should go so if they
[1:04:20] wanted to make it to Canaan they had to
[1:04:23] follow the angel of the Lord
[1:04:26] and if they were following the angel of
[1:04:29] the Lord they were sure to make Canaan
[1:04:32] everybody love the Lord now if you will
[1:04:35] turn with me as I get my footing Numbers
[1:04:37] Chapter N9 turn there and we'll start
[1:04:41] with verse 15
[1:04:57] numbers
[1:04:59] 9 verse
[1:05:01] 15 everybody
[1:05:04] there listen now on the day that the
[1:05:08] Tabernacle was reared up the cloud
[1:05:10] covered the
[1:05:12] Tabernacle namely the tent of the
[1:05:15] testimony and at evening there was upon
[1:05:18] the Tabernacle as it were the appearance
[1:05:22] of fire until
[1:05:24] morning and then the cloud was I'm sorry
[1:05:27] so sorry verse
[1:05:29] 16 and so it was always the cloud
[1:05:32] covered it by day and the appearance of
[1:05:36] Fire by Night both was the angel of the
[1:05:39] Lord verse 17 and when the cloud was
[1:05:42] taken up from the
[1:05:44] Tabernacle then after that the children
[1:05:46] of Israel
[1:05:47] journeyed and in the place where the
[1:05:50] cloud Abode the children of Israel
[1:05:52] pitched their tents and at the command
[1:05:55] commment of the Lord the children of
[1:05:56] Israel journeyed at the Commandment of
[1:05:58] the Lord they pitched and as long as the
[1:06:01] cloud Abode upon the Tabernacle they
[1:06:04] rested in their tents and when the cloud
[1:06:07] carried long upon the Tabernacle many
[1:06:10] days then the children of Israel kept
[1:06:13] the charge of the Lord and journeyed not
[1:06:16] verse 20 and so it was when the cloud
[1:06:19] was a few days upon the Tabernacle
[1:06:21] according to the Commandment of the Lord
[1:06:23] they Abode in their tents and according
[1:06:25] to the Commandment of the Lord they
[1:06:27] journeyed and so it was when the cloud
[1:06:30] Abode from evening to morning that the
[1:06:34] cloud was taken up in the morning then
[1:06:37] they journeyed whether it was by day or
[1:06:40] by Night the cloud was taken up they
[1:06:43] journeyed amen hallelujah or whether it
[1:06:47] was two days or a month or a year that
[1:06:50] the cloud carried upon the Tabernacle
[1:06:53] remaining thereon the children of Israel
[1:06:55] above in their tents and they journeyed
[1:06:57] not but when it was taken up they
[1:07:01] journeyed and at the Commandment of the
[1:07:03] Lord they rested in their tents and at
[1:07:06] the Commandment of the Lord they
[1:07:07] journeyed and they kept charge of the
[1:07:09] Lord at the Commandment of the Lord
[1:07:12] praise the Lord amen and by the hand of
[1:07:16] Moses this is a wonderful thing
[1:07:19] because the Church of the Living God
[1:07:21] moved as God moved
[1:07:24] them and the priest God commanded them
[1:07:27] to make two silver trumpets and the
[1:07:30] priest's job was to study the pillar of
[1:07:33] fire and when the pillar of fire moved
[1:07:36] then the priest would begin to sound to
[1:07:39] Israel it's time to pack your tents it's
[1:07:42] time to pull your Stakes it's time to go
[1:07:45] whether it was two in the morning or 3
[1:07:48] in the morning or 4 in the morning when
[1:07:50] when God moved the church moved praise
[1:07:54] the Lord and the pillar of fire
[1:07:57] moved and the church moved with it am
[1:08:01] the trumpets would blast and the people
[1:08:05] would move are you with me because God
[1:08:08] said I will bring you to the place that
[1:08:11] I have prepared God made the promise God
[1:08:16] promised to guide us to that promise if
[1:08:19] you want healing the spirit will guide
[1:08:22] you to Healing if you want salvation God
[1:08:25] will need you to Salvation if you want
[1:08:28] the Holy Ghost God will guide you to the
[1:08:31] Holy Ghost how many believe that and
[1:08:34] brother brandom said the angel of the
[1:08:36] Lord accompanies the message
[1:08:40] always are we preaching the message this
[1:08:43] morning the angel of the Lord is with us
[1:08:46] how many believe that that the angel of
[1:08:48] the Lord is among his
[1:08:51] people now brother brandham said the
[1:08:54] true church would follow follow the
[1:08:56] pillar of fire day or night at any time
[1:08:59] and he said Luther saw the pillar of
[1:09:02] fire moving out of the Dark Ages and he
[1:09:05] sounded a gospel trumpet it's time to
[1:09:09] move and the elect of that day heard the
[1:09:13] gospel trumpet and they Rose and they
[1:09:16] moved with
[1:09:19] Luther praise the Lord amen we find the
[1:09:22] same thing with Wesley we find the same
[1:09:25] thing with
[1:09:26] Pentecost and he said now when God moves
[1:09:31] you cannot organize it that's it we
[1:09:34] cannot put offense around the message
[1:09:37] the message came to set us free from
[1:09:39] organization not to make another one and
[1:09:42] we are not bound by Doctrine we're not
[1:09:44] bound by Ministry we are a free people
[1:09:47] in Christ that are followers of the
[1:09:49] pillar of
[1:09:52] fire we move as God moves as a church
[1:09:56] and as
[1:09:58] individuals and brother bham said now we
[1:10:00] are to follow every day every hour of
[1:10:04] the day every step of the way we must be
[1:10:07] led by Jesus
[1:10:09] Christ and the Lord went before them
[1:10:12] amen Marching In The Light of the pillar
[1:10:15] of fire do you know that as we journey
[1:10:18] we're walking towards a
[1:10:21] destination and that we are moving
[1:10:23] towards a millennium and we are walking
[1:10:26] not just with Doctrine but we're walking
[1:10:29] in the Glorious light of the pillar of
[1:10:31] fire hallu we are a free people a
[1:10:34] different people that is not bound but
[1:10:37] we're a living moving Christ the the
[1:10:40] shakana the presence of godallah that
[1:10:44] accompanies his message always is with
[1:10:47] us amen
[1:10:50] amen praise the
[1:10:53] Lord says the Exodus 3:1 if you want to
[1:10:57] pull that up the Lord tells Moses come
[1:11:00] now therefore and I will send thee unto
[1:11:04] Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my
[1:11:07] people the children of Israel out of
[1:11:09] Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I
[1:11:13] that I should go un Pharaoh that I
[1:11:16] should bring forth the children of
[1:11:18] Israel out of Egypt and God said
[1:11:22] certainly I will be with thee
[1:11:25] amen right so Moses certainly was not
[1:11:29] confident in his
[1:11:31] own
[1:11:34] ability he was not resting upon his own
[1:11:38] ability to navigate a
[1:11:41] people moses' job was to follow the
[1:11:44] pillar of fire it was God leading his
[1:11:48] people not
[1:11:50] Moses Moses was used of God the people
[1:11:53] saw Moses and Moes Moses was following
[1:11:56] the pillar of fire now Moses how am I
[1:11:59] going to feed two million people how am
[1:12:03] I going to give first aid to every cut
[1:12:06] and every broken bone and and every you
[1:12:09] know anxiety how many babies are born in
[1:12:13] a night how am I going to handle this
[1:12:15] but it wasn't Moses God said I will be
[1:12:18] with thee that's an encouragement to
[1:12:22] preachers that it isn't us that can bear
[1:12:25] the people's burden but it is the word
[1:12:27] that'll bear the burden and we're only
[1:12:30] pointing you to the pillar of fire amen
[1:12:35] amen
[1:12:36] hallelujah it was a CO it was a comfort
[1:12:39] to
[1:12:40] Moses now when they came to the Red Sea
[1:12:43] God made the way because he is the way
[1:12:47] maker Hallelujah when Moses came to the
[1:12:50] Red Sea he goes Lord what do I do he
[1:12:53] said speak and go forward so when Moses
[1:12:57] couldn't go any further God could take
[1:13:00] him
[1:13:01] on that's how we are sometimes we're
[1:13:04] discouraged because life is real Church
[1:13:07] problems are real we have problems
[1:13:10] everywhere wherever the devil is there
[1:13:12] is problems but God gives us a word that
[1:13:15] will bring us
[1:13:17] forward
[1:13:19] hallelujah
[1:13:20] hallelujah how many believe that speak
[1:13:24] tell them to go forward forward brother
[1:13:26] bham said there is no retreat in God God
[1:13:29] don't retreat it isn't God that Retreats
[1:13:32] from cancer it isn't God that Retreats
[1:13:35] from church problems it is God that goes
[1:13:39] forward God help us to come under the
[1:13:42] influence of the Holy Spirit we try many
[1:13:45] times in our own strength and we fail
[1:13:48] that's it and brother brandham was
[1:13:51] prophet enough man enough to show us
[1:13:54] that men fail he told us he didn't have
[1:13:57] to he told us he told a lie Under
[1:14:01] Pressure amen we can't relate to 30 to
[1:14:04] 40 Visions a
[1:14:06] day but we can relate to a man under
[1:14:09] pressure telling a
[1:14:11] lie and God dealing with him not
[1:14:15] condemning you ain't even fit to use but
[1:14:17] God turned him around and he used it to
[1:14:19] help us that's right ain't that
[1:14:22] wonderful that's it don't condemn
[1:14:25] yourself for your mistakes use them as
[1:14:26] stepping stones to help the young
[1:14:30] people praise the Lord but another
[1:14:33] lesson this teaches us is we are not to
[1:14:36] stay on the same ground that's it I
[1:14:40] don't care how big the wall is how big
[1:14:42] the mountain is how big Jericho is the
[1:14:44] word will take you
[1:14:46] forward if you wanted to open up speak
[1:14:49] the word and go
[1:14:52] forward how many want to go forward in
[1:14:54] Christ
[1:14:56] take God at his word and God will take
[1:14:59] you forward whether it be Devils or
[1:15:02] sickness or it just circumstances that
[1:15:05] are too big for you that's right amen
[1:15:08] speak and go
[1:15:09] forward have you ever been to a place
[1:15:12] that you think I can't make it another
[1:15:14] day yes sir but you do make it another
[1:15:17] day how did you make it it wasn't
[1:15:21] you did you ever come to a place you
[1:15:24] said how will I never get out of this
[1:15:27] and then a year later you have forgotten
[1:15:30] and God took you right through
[1:15:32] it and you did make it sir you're still
[1:15:35] serving God won't he take care of every
[1:15:40] giant won't he take care of every
[1:15:42] sickness and every Church problem and
[1:15:45] every discouragement hasn't he brought
[1:15:47] you this
[1:15:48] far speak and go forward hallelujah
[1:15:53] hallelujah
[1:15:55] now the Bible tells us in numbers
[1:15:58] 21:4 if you'll pull that up numbers
[1:16:03] 21:4 says and they journeyed from Mount
[1:16:06] by the way of the Red Sea to
[1:16:10] Compass the land of Edom and the soul of
[1:16:14] the people was much
[1:16:17] discouraged because of the
[1:16:22] way so the way that God God LED them was
[1:16:26] a very difficult place right and let me
[1:16:30] I want this to sound loud and clear many
[1:16:32] times we say why am I battling the devil
[1:16:34] said well the reason you're battling is
[1:16:36] your serpent
[1:16:38] seed oh the preacher pray for the
[1:16:40] preacher he's the only one having
[1:16:42] this wait waiting on us to come to
[1:16:45] Perfection brother you pray for
[1:16:47] us no we all go through that the devil
[1:16:51] come and say the reason you're not
[1:16:52] blessed is your serpent seed
[1:16:58] but according to this these weren't
[1:16:59] serpent seed that's right but he led the
[1:17:04] predestinated because they had some
[1:17:06] maturing to do before they took the land
[1:17:09] that's right remember the Bible said
[1:17:10] don't give your inheritance to a fool
[1:17:13] he'll squander it and then all your
[1:17:16] life's labors will just go down the
[1:17:17] drain so God didn't want that God wanted
[1:17:19] to train them before he gave them their
[1:17:22] inheritance amen it's just the same for
[1:17:26] us but notice now the Lord the pillar of
[1:17:29] fire is leading through rough paths
[1:17:33] bitter Waters and deserts and Howling
[1:17:36] Wilderness sometimes God will do it and
[1:17:39] we're all right in our own minds but God
[1:17:42] knows what we need he knows what our
[1:17:44] mothers need what our daddies need what
[1:17:47] our young people need what our church
[1:17:50] needs God knows how to make real gold
[1:17:53] out of us
[1:17:55] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:17:57] right put your hat
[1:18:00] upen quit being in the Molly grubs stand
[1:18:04] like a son and a daughter of God
[1:18:06] hallelujah sing like a daughter of God
[1:18:10] hallelujah possess yourself like a child
[1:18:13] of
[1:18:14] God hallelujah he said I will make a way
[1:18:19] in the wilderness that's right I when
[1:18:22] they needed bread God gave them bread
[1:18:24] when they needed water God gave them
[1:18:27] water Hallelujah and they needed rest
[1:18:31] God gave them
[1:18:33] rest the holy spirit will put the devil
[1:18:35] out yes
[1:18:38] sir the devil isn't dealing with flesh
[1:18:41] and blood only if we allow it that's
[1:18:43] right but if we stay under the anointing
[1:18:45] of the pillar of fire he's dealing with
[1:18:47] God Amen he'll Bluff and snort and cry
[1:18:51] he'll stand there like Goliath but every
[1:18:53] giant will fall
[1:18:55] every sea will move every mountain will
[1:18:58] crumble hallu how many believe
[1:19:01] that amen right that was what Joshua did
[1:19:05] Joshua had passed through the Jordan God
[1:19:07] opened it just like the Red Sea but Jo
[1:19:10] Joshua didn't run just Reckless into
[1:19:13] Jericho brother brandham said he was
[1:19:14] pacing saying Lord how do I take Jericho
[1:19:18] and he met the captain of The Lord of
[1:19:21] hosts did you ever catch what brother
[1:19:23] brandham said he said the pillar of fire
[1:19:25] that led them through the Wilderness for
[1:19:26] 40 years the pillar of fire became a man
[1:19:30] there you are he said he became
[1:19:33] incarnate in a man a prefigure of Jesus
[1:19:36] Christ he said are you with us or on the
[1:19:39] Lord's Side he said I'm the one that's
[1:19:41] been leading you the whole time God
[1:19:44] becoming flesh leading us to God in
[1:19:50] flesh Hallelujah speak and go forward
[1:19:56] amen
[1:19:58] hallelujah God will make the way clear
[1:20:01] sir I'm preaching myself I feel myself
[1:20:04] preaching to myself this morning amen
[1:20:07] when the church stops marching it starts
[1:20:10] wondering that's right what am I doing
[1:20:13] here wondering and wondering yeah what
[1:20:17] am I doing here has God left me am I an
[1:20:22] orphan why does everything go right for
[1:20:25] brother
[1:20:26] Paul I always get the short end of the
[1:20:30] stick oh we
[1:20:33] all what what's brother juel say wowy
[1:20:36] wowy
[1:20:37] woo I heard that for a long time hav't
[1:20:41] many heard that before brother juel Wy
[1:20:43] Wy wo brother Bram said when Pentecost
[1:20:47] stopped marching they organized that's
[1:20:51] right the Holy Spirit teaches us Satan
[1:20:55] in the framework of the church and when
[1:20:57] we stop we become formal and when we
[1:21:00] stop we
[1:21:02] organize to keep ourselves right on the
[1:21:05] outside but are we right on the inside
[1:21:08] that's it in order to be right on the
[1:21:11] inside we must follow the leading of the
[1:21:14] Lord day by
[1:21:16] day we must pray through every day
[1:21:20] amen amen
[1:21:22] hallelujah yes you don't have to turn
[1:21:25] there you'll remember in Ezekiel chapter
[1:21:28] 1 you'll find that Ezekiel is caught up
[1:21:31] in the
[1:21:32] spirit and he
[1:21:34] sees a fire a cloud infolding itself
[1:21:39] everybody with
[1:21:40] me and he said it was the color of amber
[1:21:44] or the midst of fire and he said out of
[1:21:47] the midst come four living creatures
[1:21:50] amen we know about the four living
[1:21:52] creatures and he said every one of them
[1:21:55] a face of a man a face of an ox a face
[1:21:57] of an eagle a face of a lion and he said
[1:22:02] there was four on each side so brother
[1:22:04] brandom said whatever direction that
[1:22:06] they went they always went forward
[1:22:11] brother brandom said this was a type of
[1:22:14] the Ark of the Covenant he said as it
[1:22:17] was on the earth it was rolling on
[1:22:20] wheels how many remember the wheel in
[1:22:22] the middle of the wheel the four Beast
[1:22:25] was rolling on Wheels he said it was the
[1:22:29] ark in its Journey he said it was
[1:22:32] rolling on its Earthly journey and then
[1:22:35] when John saw it it was stationary but
[1:22:39] what I want to show you is that the ark
[1:22:42] is never stationary The Mercy Seat
[1:22:45] traveled with the church and the church
[1:22:49] is not going backward the church is not
[1:22:53] stationary the church moves with the
[1:22:56] spirit of God every individual moves
[1:22:59] with the spirit of God as many are led
[1:23:02] by the spirit of God they are the sons
[1:23:04] of
[1:23:06] God the nature of the Beast could not go
[1:23:10] backward they could only go in One
[1:23:14] Direction you are anointed to go in a
[1:23:17] forward momentum your prayer life must
[1:23:21] go forward your church services must go
[1:23:24] forward
[1:23:25] forward we're
[1:23:28] anointed to go
[1:23:30] forward sir the church responds to the
[1:23:33] anointing amen hallelujah that's how in
[1:23:37] the Dark Ages that they were not
[1:23:39] overcome by the devil and and the
[1:23:42] military arm of Rome she went forward
[1:23:46] anyhow amen and when the church broke
[1:23:49] into Babylon in this day how do we
[1:23:51] survive not our own wisdom it is an an
[1:23:54] anointing of an eagle anointing that
[1:23:57] allows us to go forward when everything
[1:24:00] else is falling
[1:24:02] away
[1:24:03] hallu advance means to go forward to the
[1:24:08] objective sir do we have a vision do you
[1:24:11] have a vision for your home do you have
[1:24:14] a vision as an individual of what you
[1:24:17] are reaching for what you are contending
[1:24:19] for amen amen that's right we all must
[1:24:23] have a vision you will perish yes sir
[1:24:26] The Church Must Have A Vision amen
[1:24:29] forward means to
[1:24:33] proceed Amen to move forward in a
[1:24:35] purposeful way yes
[1:24:38] sir that's right do you have purpose in
[1:24:40] your
[1:24:42] life how how many thank God that he has
[1:24:46] taken you to where you are now amen amen
[1:24:49] amen how many of you seen Fall
[1:24:51] Away how many of you seen just but
[1:24:54] you're standing against the grace of
[1:24:56] almighty
[1:24:57] God God give us purpose yes sir as
[1:25:01] mothers give us purpose for our children
[1:25:04] and for the future of our household amen
[1:25:08] men
[1:25:10] Brethren husbands let us have purpose
[1:25:13] yes sir of life and vision what do I
[1:25:16] want for my
[1:25:17] household that's
[1:25:19] it amen
[1:25:22] amen now forward think of
[1:25:25] forward so Ezekiel Saw the Ark of the
[1:25:28] Covenant moving and when he saw it it
[1:25:31] went from the Tabernacle to the temple
[1:25:35] to God in flesh amen amen it was
[1:25:38] advancing all the time it went from
[1:25:41] Badger skins to Solomon's
[1:25:44] Temple then to the greatest Glory Jesus
[1:25:47] Christ amen I want you to think of this
[1:25:50] the law foreshadowed the New Testament
[1:25:54] and and Christ is our Perfection and if
[1:25:57] you think of the victories of the Old
[1:25:59] Testament the Bible said now he has
[1:26:01] blessed us with a more excellent
[1:26:03] Ministry and that he has based a better
[1:26:07] Covenant with better promises this is a
[1:26:10] better Covenant we ought to be more
[1:26:13] Victorious than they were of the old
[1:26:16] because we are coming to higher places
[1:26:19] if they had Divine Healing in the old we
[1:26:21] certainly have Divine Healing now amen
[1:26:25] amen because we're advancing
[1:26:28] amen every Ministry ought to be
[1:26:31] advancing amen remember
[1:26:35] Nathaniel uh Philip come said come and
[1:26:38] see Nathaniel Nathaniel steps into the
[1:26:41] presence and I I doubt there was just
[1:26:43] two people I'm sure there were throngs
[1:26:46] of people somehow some way Jesus
[1:26:50] recognizes him he recognizes he's
[1:26:53] recognized and the spirit of the Lord
[1:26:55] said behold an Israelite whom there is
[1:26:58] no G amen it must have shocked
[1:27:08] him Master how did
[1:27:11] you how did you ever know
[1:27:13] me Hallelujah before philli called thee
[1:27:17] Hallelujah when you're under the tree I
[1:27:19] saw
[1:27:20] thee Pastor hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:24] the king of
[1:27:27] Israel and Jesus said you believe
[1:27:30] because I told you I saw you under the
[1:27:33] tree you will see greater things than
[1:27:38] this you'll see a greater Ministry God
[1:27:40] has taking you to a higher realm of
[1:27:44] faith you'll see Angels ascending and
[1:27:47] descending upon the son of
[1:27:50] man because God always moves forward
[1:27:54] we're not just moving but we're moving
[1:27:57] forward to an objective and to a goal
[1:28:01] that's right amen otherwise we're
[1:28:03] wandering that's it in the
[1:28:06] wilderness the spirit of the Lord Moved
[1:28:08] Through the Ages because the church is
[1:28:11] not
[1:28:12] stationary and every message opens up a
[1:28:16] new message that's
[1:28:18] right not an old one
[1:28:21] amen John the Baptist was a man man sent
[1:28:24] from
[1:28:26] God the Bible said I love the way
[1:28:28] brother brandham took that he said John
[1:28:31] had no Fellowship right because he was a
[1:28:34] man sent from God he said he had no
[1:28:37] backing or no cooperation because he was
[1:28:40] a man sent from God there was no
[1:28:44] politics in John because he was a man
[1:28:46] sent from God brother brandom said he
[1:28:48] called it what it was because he was a
[1:28:50] man sent from God brother brandom called
[1:28:53] it what it was because he was a man sent
[1:28:56] from God organization is Antichrist
[1:28:58] thank the Lord he has told us that he
[1:29:01] was a man sent from
[1:29:03] God now brother brandham said John was
[1:29:06] bringing something
[1:29:08] new the dispensation was closing and
[1:29:12] John was bringing forth a new
[1:29:15] dispensation and he was preparing the
[1:29:17] way of the Lord so John's daddy was a
[1:29:21] priest but he did not follow the old
[1:29:24] order of the priesthood because he was a
[1:29:28] man sent from
[1:29:30] God and something new was coming forth
[1:29:33] that did not even
[1:29:35] resemble right amen that's right the old
[1:29:39] order
[1:29:41] amen praise the Lord amen Jesus Christ
[1:29:45] came forth which was the fullness of the
[1:29:48] word bodily that's it that's right and
[1:29:51] God had called John
[1:29:54] to introduce him the
[1:29:56] word and brother bham said those blinded
[1:29:59] Pharisees could not see the word made
[1:30:02] manifest because they were wrapped up in
[1:30:04] their priesthood that's
[1:30:06] it listen to this he said the old system
[1:30:09] had to give
[1:30:11] way it was the word that had been
[1:30:15] promised he said now like the seed that
[1:30:18] goes in the ground the seed must rot I
[1:30:23] want you to catch the spirit of what I'm
[1:30:26] saying the seed must
[1:30:28] rot and out of the rotten mess 400 years
[1:30:32] without a prophet listen closely out of
[1:30:35] that rotten religious mess came forth
[1:30:38] the word made
[1:30:40] flesh you wonder why we have such
[1:30:44] problems don't let it discourage you it
[1:30:47] the word seed must
[1:30:49] rot in order for life to come forth and
[1:30:53] we're in Wicked age like Jesus had but
[1:30:56] the word made flashh is coming forth
[1:31:01] amen four 400 years without a
[1:31:05] message John's father was a part of the
[1:31:07] old order Jesus was of the New Order he
[1:31:11] was bringing forth the new Faith yes sir
[1:31:14] hallelujah amen the old system was done
[1:31:18] at the
[1:31:19] crucifixion the old lamb was done the
[1:31:21] feast days were done the old orders were
[1:31:24] done God was bringing forth life and a
[1:31:27] new
[1:31:28] covenant Amen brother brandham said now
[1:31:32] he
[1:31:34] said that Jesus came he was the new and
[1:31:37] the living way not the old way of the
[1:31:41] law but Grace how many appreciate
[1:31:45] Grace he said now the old seed before
[1:31:49] the new seed can come out it must rot
[1:31:53] not just but it must
[1:31:56] rot and the same thing is in
[1:31:59] birth we'll never go
[1:32:04] forward when you're born
[1:32:07] again he said notice the
[1:32:10] person they don't want to rot from the
[1:32:13] old system right that's it they don't
[1:32:15] want to come out of it they want to stay
[1:32:17] in the old and claim the new birth or
[1:32:20] the message of the age amen if you want
[1:32:24] the Holy Ghost it's very simple yes sir
[1:32:28] you must die to the old order of the old
[1:32:31] man and be born again completely you
[1:32:34] cannot hold to both when you pull the
[1:32:38] world into the church it's a perversion
[1:32:42] God will not bless it and neither will
[1:32:44] God bring denominationalism into the
[1:32:47] message the old order must die in order
[1:32:52] for the life of God to come out of it
[1:32:55] the bride's Revival to come out of it he
[1:32:58] said you cannot cling to the old system
[1:33:01] you must come out of it that's why John
[1:33:05] said I saw a new heavens and a new Earth
[1:33:10] because the old has passed away how many
[1:33:14] say Lord let me die to my thinking die
[1:33:17] to my former years let me die to the
[1:33:20] system to be born of God's system
[1:33:24] two orders cannot exist at the same
[1:33:27] time and there must become a
[1:33:31] transformation from old to new If any
[1:33:35] man be in Christ he is a new creature
[1:33:38] old things are passed away behold all
[1:33:41] things are made
[1:33:43] new you don't bring your denomination
[1:33:46] into the message no sir that's right
[1:33:49] that's why Paul said Brethren I count
[1:33:51] myself to apprehended this one thing
[1:33:53] forgetting those things that are behind
[1:33:56] me I reach forward to the mark of the
[1:33:59] high calling in
[1:34:01] Christ many of people are trying to
[1:34:04] manufacture yesterday or hold on to
[1:34:07] yesterday you can't do it you must
[1:34:09] follow the pillar of
[1:34:11] fire good Wonder brother brandham said
[1:34:15] the churches they say this is it and
[1:34:17] they walk in the glare of
[1:34:19] yesterday he said now a man when he's
[1:34:22] driving down the road if he looks
[1:34:25] through his real ve mirror he'll get
[1:34:27] wrecked you're to look forward to where
[1:34:30] you're going and that applies to us
[1:34:34] we're not looking back to
[1:34:36] 1965 we're building upon 1965 that's
[1:34:40] right that's right and if we look back
[1:34:42] and try to hallow yesterday we become
[1:34:45] Idol worshippers and we miss what the
[1:34:48] spirit is doing with the word right
[1:34:51] now the word is a brother Brandon went
[1:34:55] away but the word is still here the
[1:34:58] spirit is still here Christ is still
[1:35:01] here and he's lifting us into a higher
[1:35:04] Place Hallelujah that's right amen
[1:35:09] hallelujah and he said
[1:35:12] now he said watch this he said looking
[1:35:16] not looking back but pressing forward he
[1:35:18] said this in
[1:35:20] Shalom we're not placing the message as
[1:35:23] looking back backwards that's what he
[1:35:25] said he said we're looking forward he
[1:35:28] said now many times he said women are
[1:35:31] lean this way nothing wrong with it we
[1:35:33] know the makeup of a woman he said
[1:35:35] they'll try to stay a
[1:35:39] teenager yeah no matter how hard you
[1:35:42] try just a matter of
[1:35:44] time we're all old we're all getting
[1:35:47] older just some are ahead of the others
[1:35:51] but we're all going to the same place
[1:35:53] amen and brother brandom said you'll see
[1:35:56] it and it's okay it's the nature of a
[1:35:58] woman to be pretty that's fine pretty's
[1:36:00] fine but you can't hold to yesterday
[1:36:04] that's delusional that's right you must
[1:36:07] walk in what God gives you Amen brother
[1:36:10] bam said if you lose your teeth if they
[1:36:12] make your teeth get you some if they
[1:36:14] make you some
[1:36:16] right thank the Lord amen helps us cope
[1:36:20] that's right don't be looking back look
[1:36:22] to the new body body
[1:36:25] amen your faith will take you to your
[1:36:28] new body let me tell you this is a pest
[1:36:31] house
[1:36:33] anyway brother bam said do not be
[1:36:36] satisfied where you are that's right am
[1:36:39] that's it bless God I've been a message
[1:36:42] believer since I was 23 years
[1:36:46] old amen how far have you come that's it
[1:36:50] that's right that's it
[1:36:53] because as long as the scripture remains
[1:36:56] be perfect as my Father in Heaven is
[1:36:58] perfect we're still reaching that's
[1:37:00] right that's right well at least the
[1:37:04] preachers are pray for the
[1:37:08] preachers Paul said I'm pressing forward
[1:37:11] that's right Paul Paul was caught up to
[1:37:14] the third heaven Paul was used that
[1:37:17] seldom any men were used in the way of
[1:37:20] Paul and Paul said forgetting the the
[1:37:23] mistakes of the past pressing forward to
[1:37:26] the mark of the high calling if if Paul
[1:37:29] had to press forward then we got to
[1:37:32] press forward when brother brandham had
[1:37:34] went beyond the curtain of time the
[1:37:36] voice said keep pressing if you only
[1:37:38] knew keep
[1:37:41] pressing if he was close to the Finish
[1:37:43] Line we're getting vitally close yes sir
[1:37:46] yes sir Hallelujah brother bam said you
[1:37:49] never put a period on your Revelation
[1:37:52] that's right good bless God we know it
[1:37:54] all let me tell you God gave us a
[1:37:56] revelation brother brandom said it was
[1:37:58] culminating in the desert so quickly I
[1:38:00] couldn't keep up with
[1:38:01] it and I'll assure you after all of
[1:38:05] these years of studying giving myself to
[1:38:07] the word of God I feel like I haven't
[1:38:09] even scratched the surface it's not it's
[1:38:12] coming to the revelation of what God is
[1:38:15] doing in our lives that's it amen it
[1:38:19] ain't a bunch of head
[1:38:21] knowledge right it's a
[1:38:24] life brother Bram said we have powers
[1:38:28] unlimited how many believe that I
[1:38:31] believe that the church could get
[1:38:33] together and start praying for a 12year
[1:38:35] old boy and God Chang the circumstance
[1:38:38] from a life FL to being on his feet and
[1:38:40] playing with the kids by evening time
[1:38:43] God can defeat every sickness that is in
[1:38:46] this
[1:38:47] church and we have untapped resources
[1:38:51] that's right hallelujah amen he is God
[1:38:55] this is not a man message it's a god
[1:38:58] message Hallelujah let us be man sent
[1:39:01] from God believe everything God showed
[1:39:04] you and cry out Lord show me more that's
[1:39:07] it how many are hungry for more I want
[1:39:10] to see you Lord I want to see what your
[1:39:12] love is I want to see what the cross
[1:39:16] really
[1:39:17] means let me see the depth the width the
[1:39:21] breadth that's right said we can't even
[1:39:24] comprehend the love of
[1:39:27] God brother bham said we're living in
[1:39:29] the last days we're living in the time
[1:39:32] where God's Great beautiful Church ought
[1:39:34] to be standing on its feet shining like
[1:39:37] the lily of the valley he said we're
[1:39:40] back
[1:39:41] here we're back here as a
[1:39:43] Methodist back here as a
[1:39:46] presbyterian Pentecostal that's right
[1:39:49] amen he said oh what a disgrace that's
[1:39:52] right we should be
[1:39:54] unfolding God's spirit pouring out not a
[1:39:58] little gusher not one baptism but
[1:40:01] baptism after baptism the just shall
[1:40:03] live by faith sanctification or gifts of
[1:40:06] the Spirit he said but revelation after
[1:40:09] Revelation power after power glory after
[1:40:13] Glory we ought to be way up the road
[1:40:16] ready for the translation
[1:40:23] yes he said we're lingering way back in
[1:40:26] the old things let's go
[1:40:31] forward every place you put the souls of
[1:40:34] your feet shall be your
[1:40:38] possession brother brandom said now
[1:40:41] let's move from glory to glory from
[1:40:44] Bible experience to Bible experience
[1:40:48] let's unfold open our hearts raise up
[1:40:51] our hands keep saying keep in the
[1:40:56] Bible praise the
[1:40:59] Lorden you know brother brandham said
[1:41:02] there is no end to the tree of Faith
[1:41:05] that's
[1:41:08] it amen how many like climbing
[1:41:12] trees if we could go back to when we
[1:41:14] were 10 years old we all like to climb
[1:41:16] trees girl or
[1:41:18] boy but this tree of faith we ought to
[1:41:20] be climbing into the all things are
[1:41:23] possible in Christ untapped resources of
[1:41:27] God
[1:41:29] amen amen let's look at that scripture
[1:41:33] again 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse1 17
[1:41:37] and 18 this is our opening
[1:41:40] scripture every everybody
[1:41:43] okay I don't know what time it is that's
[1:41:46] all right
[1:41:48] you thank
[1:41:50] you thank you I appreciate it
[1:41:54] 2 Corinthians chapter 3:1
[1:41:58] 17 now the spirit of the
[1:42:00] Lord is that
[1:42:03] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[1:42:07] is there is
[1:42:10] Liberty but we all with an open face
[1:42:13] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:42:16] Lord are changed listen to this into the
[1:42:20] same image from glory to Glory
[1:42:26] Hallelujah even as by the
[1:42:30] spirit of the
[1:42:32] Lord now that word changed into is the
[1:42:36] same word transfigured yes it is
[1:42:40] transformed is to be changed amen not to
[1:42:44] be patched up but to be made new so when
[1:42:48] our faith goes from glory to glory and
[1:42:51] our faith is trans formed it's literally
[1:42:55] changing into something and it's coming
[1:42:58] closer to the glory and the image of the
[1:43:01] Lord which is the word but it takes the
[1:43:05] power of God to transform us and make us
[1:43:10] something different God will transform
[1:43:13] our nature our attitude our views our
[1:43:17] perspective our ambition God will change
[1:43:21] our thinking amen let the mind that was
[1:43:24] in Christ be in new he'll change our
[1:43:27] nature our makeup he'll make us a new
[1:43:30] creature and he won't change us once
[1:43:33] when we're baptized but he'll change us
[1:43:36] from glory to glory to
[1:43:40] glory when you came to the Lord your
[1:43:42] change only
[1:43:44] began you ought to be changing every
[1:43:49] day brought into the perfect will of God
[1:43:53] that's right right brother brandom said
[1:43:55] transformation is to change from one
[1:43:59] thing to another he said like a tadpole
[1:44:02] being changed into a different creature
[1:44:06] he said now God sends his transforming
[1:44:10] power for one
[1:44:12] reason to fulfill his own word that's
[1:44:17] it if we didn't have a change we would
[1:44:20] never fulfill God's word
[1:44:26] I want you to think of this the word is
[1:44:30] creative every word of God Is Creative
[1:44:33] God said let there be amen and I want
[1:44:36] you to see Abraham and
[1:44:38] Sarah now Abraham could believe God but
[1:44:42] he needed a change in order to bring
[1:44:45] forth the promise of God Sarah could
[1:44:48] believe God but no matter how much they
[1:44:51] believe God had to change them to bring
[1:44:54] the promise to pass do you know that
[1:44:58] Sarah was a type of us yes sir old Sarah
[1:45:03] sir dried up womb years couldn't have a
[1:45:07] baby every day goes by how you feeling
[1:45:11] honey huh yeah feeling any better what
[1:45:15] say feeling any better nah praise God
[1:45:19] we're going to have it
[1:45:20] anyhow and tomorrow's worse
[1:45:24] and she's getting feebler and Abraham
[1:45:27] how you
[1:45:28] feeling ah never
[1:45:31] mind this body is going to bring forth
[1:45:35] the nation of Israel amen this body I'm
[1:45:39] not I'm not making fun of elderly this
[1:45:42] is the
[1:45:43] church the womb is Barren right the milk
[1:45:47] veins are dried up there is no possible
[1:45:51] way
[1:45:53] that Mary that Sarah can bring forth the
[1:45:57] promise
[1:45:59] amen one morning they got up the Sun was
[1:46:02] shining that's it it's
[1:46:05] early looks over Abraham's looking she
[1:46:09] goes what are you looking at what
[1:46:12] happened to
[1:46:13] you what honey you're you're
[1:46:17] beautiful Am I Dreaming pinch me
[1:46:21] ow that's
[1:46:23] right honey your hair is dark again
[1:46:28] amen you don't whistle through your
[1:46:30] missing to the tooth came back
[1:46:35] amen
[1:46:38] Sarah
[1:46:40] Abraham amen one morning was different
[1:46:44] yes sir yes sir that's I know we come
[1:46:46] into
[1:46:47] church hear sermons and we go home but
[1:46:51] you are Sarah that's it
[1:46:53] and you're not
[1:46:55] holding Dr Seuss or Chicken Soup for the
[1:47:00] Soul this is the creative word of God
[1:47:04] that is in your
[1:47:05] heart and there is a change that changed
[1:47:08] you from the world to the present but
[1:47:11] what I'm trying to express is the change
[1:47:13] does not stop it keeps going and it
[1:47:17] keeps going and you ought to climb
[1:47:19] higher and higher in Christ that's right
[1:47:22] hallah exactly right and God brings the
[1:47:25] change to bring his word to pass that's
[1:47:27] it right there that's it praise the Lord
[1:47:30] exactly right it's just like I'm not
[1:47:32] what I used to be I'm not what I want to
[1:47:35] be that's right I ain't what I used to
[1:47:38] be that was what he was saying now
[1:47:40] Amen brother brandham said God keeps
[1:47:43] revealing himself to
[1:47:46] you and you're growing in Grace to Grace
[1:47:50] from power to power from glory to to
[1:47:53] Glory that's right so we're only as
[1:47:55] strong is our Revelation and adherence
[1:47:57] to the word of God that's it that's
[1:48:00] right and so God's revelation to you as
[1:48:04] an individual ought to be daily that's
[1:48:07] right right that's why when we read the
[1:48:09] Bible we should read it with Earnest
[1:48:12] Lord what will you show me today
[1:48:15] am don't let that you stay with your
[1:48:18] devotions that's right you read your
[1:48:20] Bible take time amen nothing's more
[1:48:23] important take time to have your time
[1:48:25] with God Amen young people say God
[1:48:29] reveal yourself to me amen what does
[1:48:32] this message mean what does Malachi 4
[1:48:35] mean what does revelation 10 mean to
[1:48:41] me Hallelujah brother ROM said the sun
[1:48:45] changes the seed from glory to glory so
[1:48:49] it don't stay a seed and become a
[1:48:51] reproduction it goes through stages and
[1:48:54] sometimes it don't even look like the
[1:48:55] seed but it will end up
[1:48:58] there you are am I wearing you are you
[1:49:01] getting
[1:49:03] tired brother brandham said now the corn
[1:49:05] of wheat that falls in the ground Must
[1:49:07] Die amen and he said the church comes
[1:49:11] from Luther and Wesley and it comes back
[1:49:14] to the original glory and back to the
[1:49:17] glory that was at the beginning back to
[1:49:20] the original seed whom God God has
[1:49:23] Justified he hath already glorified he
[1:49:27] is bringing us back he said we have been
[1:49:30] looking through the glass Darkly but
[1:49:32] soon it will be face to face we have
[1:49:35] been going glory to glory but soon it
[1:49:38] will be right in
[1:49:40] glory we are complete in him and God who
[1:49:45] has brought you out of the world you
[1:49:48] feel the call let me encourage you
[1:49:51] answer the call if there is a pull in
[1:49:53] your heart say yes and take one step let
[1:49:57] no nothing hinder you and watch God meet
[1:50:00] you
[1:50:01] there amen I don't care where you've
[1:50:03] been how backing you are have faith in
[1:50:09] God lord and then it will take you on
[1:50:14] until you're standing in a glorified
[1:50:16] body that's right praise the Lord
[1:50:19] Brother bam said just like Enoch he kept
[1:50:21] walking I was preaching on that
[1:50:23] Wednesday he kept rising in the power of
[1:50:26] the Rapture
[1:50:28] amen right I say Lord let me get to
[1:50:30] Higher
[1:50:32] Ground leave the Earthbound senses
[1:50:35] that's right quit reasoning let your
[1:50:38] mind be dominated by the word of God I
[1:50:42] know I know what I speak of there was a
[1:50:44] day when tapes were playing tapes were
[1:50:46] playing we got away from that we focus
[1:50:50] on other ministers but there is no voice
[1:50:52] in the the land that is more important
[1:50:54] to hear than the voice of Malachi 4 the
[1:50:57] pure word of God saying come up hither
[1:51:01] amen that's right that's right it washes
[1:51:04] us it is a creative power that's why
[1:51:06] brother Brandon speak and there were
[1:51:08] squirrels because they were showing the
[1:51:10] creative power in the word of God that's
[1:51:13] right Vindicated by God
[1:51:21] himself my brother bom said now God has
[1:51:23] revealed more to me and he keeps
[1:51:26] bringing it on he never takes away what
[1:51:29] has been he just keeps adding on that's
[1:51:32] why his ministry went first pole second
[1:51:35] pole third pole and notice the messages
[1:51:38] the pyramid is a growing message
[1:51:42] everything is moving to the Capstone the
[1:51:45] Masterpiece was a growing message the
[1:51:47] wheat plant the bride tree the church
[1:51:50] ages the Roman Candle everything is a
[1:51:53] continual work exactly right never
[1:51:59] stationary amen and brother bandam said
[1:52:02] if I could live in any age it would be
[1:52:04] this one right
[1:52:06] now this is a hard age but we have been
[1:52:10] given a word that'll take us above it
[1:52:12] they've never been given anything like
[1:52:14] this we are a blessed
[1:52:16] people but we're living in an age hear
[1:52:19] me I won't hold you long hear me we're
[1:52:22] living in an age that says I have need
[1:52:27] of that's the battle but brother bandam
[1:52:31] said you should never be satisfied
[1:52:33] that's right with where you are that's
[1:52:36] right Paul was Reaching Forward the
[1:52:38] apostles was Reaching Forward that's
[1:52:40] good and right now we're battling
[1:52:42] complacency that's right especially when
[1:52:45] you I got the baptis got the godhead
[1:52:47] yeah predes yeah serp got that but it's

[1:53:09] but you can go no higher than what you
[1:53:10] believe that's right that's right that's
[1:53:14] right how many want to go higher yes

[1:53:50] prayer life a deep de ER devotion a
[1:53:54] higher Faith Lord let me have a greater
[1:53:58] testimony that means I need a greater
[1:54:00] Revelation that's because you can only
[1:54:03] go as high as you believe and so we need
[1:54:06] the spirit to take us
[1:54:08] higher brother brandham said this when
[1:54:10] he saw the third pole he the Angels
[1:54:12] teaching him how to fish and then he
[1:54:15] said I went higher in the vision that's
[1:54:18] right amen and he saw the tent
[1:54:25] and it was dealing with the ministry the
[1:54:27] third
[1:54:28] poll and every one of you have a
[1:54:31] Ministry yes sir it ain't just the
[1:54:34] preacher every one of us in the body of

[1:54:41] our
[1:54:42] ministry I want to come higher that's my
[1:54:45] passion Lord use me this year like never

[1:55:03] the presence of God to encourage the
[1:55:05] body right
[1:55:07] amen how many say Lord take my Ministry
[1:55:10] higher popularity does not vindicate
[1:55:13] that God's blessing vindicates that
[1:55:17] amen Amen brother Brandon was losing
[1:55:20] popularity but God was blessing it
[1:55:22] Greater as the word came Hallelujah
[1:55:25] that's right that's right that's
[1:55:29] right
[1:55:32] Hallelujah just a can I have just a few
[1:55:34] more minutes maybe 15 I should never try
[1:55:37] to
[1:55:39] prophesy you got think I'm a false
[1:55:44] prophet you know brother brandom made
[1:55:46] the
[1:55:48] statement he took Natural Science and he
[1:55:51] said Natural Science is a forerunner of
[1:55:54] God's spiritual
[1:55:55] achievement so he took Martin Luther and
[1:55:58] he said Luther had pulled the church out
[1:56:01] of the Dark Ages by divine revelation
[1:56:04] that just shall live by faith and it was
[1:56:06] enough to crush the system in the day
[1:56:08] and to overcome the powers of church and
[1:56:11] state and bring them into the light of
[1:56:13] the Gospel the beginning of the
[1:56:15] restoration now brother brandham said
[1:56:17] that science
[1:56:19] forerun the true achievement of God
[1:56:23] so he said first he said was Luther the
[1:56:26] horse and buggy and I went into a study
[1:56:28] and I was looking and I don't know if it
[1:56:30] was uh chariots or not chariots but uh
[1:56:34] what kind of buggy that it was but it
[1:56:37] says that they trace it back to the
[1:56:40] 1400s and turkey I think it
[1:56:44] was and brother bams in the 1500s Here
[1:56:47] Comes Luther it was a
[1:56:50] power it was a greater horse
[1:56:53] horsepower and he said then the
[1:56:55] automobile and I looked up in the
[1:56:57] history and it said first was the steam
[1:56:59] power automobile in the 1600s then there
[1:57:02] was a combustion chamber made in the S I
[1:57:07] think it was the 1700s and then Wesley
[1:57:10] came forth go back and look you'll find
[1:57:13] it and he said the natural was showing
[1:57:17] the progression of what God was trying
[1:57:20] to achieve he said then God brought
[1:57:24] forth tongues and restoration of gifts
[1:57:28] he said God was taking them off the
[1:57:31] earth and the plane was made I think it
[1:57:34] was for flown for like 30 seconds so
[1:57:36] 1903 and 1906 God brought the gifts back
[1:57:40] into the church he said it was just
[1:57:43] adding more
[1:57:47] power and then brother brandham said in
[1:57:50] 1962 John Glenn went to the moon exactly
[1:57:55] 1963 God opened the word and the power
[1:57:58] of God fell upon the church and he said
[1:58:01] they'll never go any
[1:58:03] higher
[1:58:05] amen because God is opening a channel
[1:58:08] for us to have a body change amen do you
[1:58:11] believe that and brother Brenham said
[1:58:14] right now God just keeps adding power
[1:58:17] adding power Revelation gives you
[1:58:20] authority over the devil
[1:58:22] amen hallelujah and he said now we are
[1:58:25] in the astronaut age now we're in the
[1:58:28] eagle age we're not Earthly we're
[1:58:31] Heavenly and we're waiting on the
[1:58:33] countdown God is taking us into the
[1:58:37] heavenlies that's right that ought to
[1:58:39] make you shout that's right for the
[1:58:41] rapturing grace that's right right
[1:58:45] remember Revelations chapter 1 2 and 3
[1:58:50] chapter 4 he heard a voice
[1:58:53] the same voice that turned him around
[1:58:56] was the same voice that said John come
[1:58:58] up high that's right right God is
[1:59:01] calling us a high he said John saw what
[1:59:05] Paul saw when he was caught to the third
[1:59:07] heaven he said but Paul couldn't speak
[1:59:10] of it he said but John wrote it and sent
[1:59:12] it to the church that ought to make you
[1:59:15] shout there is no Summit to God's power
[1:59:20] in our lives I don't care if you're a
[1:59:22] widow Hallelujah I don't care if nobody
[1:59:26] recognizes you you there is no
[1:59:31] Summit to what God can do in your
[1:59:34] life how many say Lord add power to my
[1:59:37] life that power comes by Revelation amen
[1:59:41] that'll take you from glory to glory to
[1:59:44] glory you know you have a right to claim
[1:59:47] your kids you know you have a right to
[1:59:50] cast Devils out Hallelujah there's an
[1:59:53] authority and a power behind Revelation
[1:59:56] and it's not just the preacher it's them
[1:59:59] that believe these signs shall follow
[2:00:03] them that believe where are we going
[2:00:06] we're advancing from glory to glory
[2:00:09] until we change our bodies and become
[2:00:13] one with the
[2:00:15] word how many want to become one with
[2:00:17] the word me too the next great SE season
[2:00:22] is the Millennium
[2:00:25] amen we'll build
[2:00:27] houses we'll eat the fruits of our
[2:00:31] labor we will live there the ox and the
[2:00:33] lamb Lion and the lamb that lay down
[2:00:36] together yes sir how many are going to
[2:00:38] be there one of these days we'll be
[2:00:40] walking in eternity or in the Millennium
[2:00:43] we'll be walking and we will look and we
[2:00:45] will see the lion laying down by the
[2:00:47] lamb and we'll nudge each other and say
[2:00:49] this is what we fought for thank you
[2:00:52] Jesus amen
[2:00:54] hallelujah how many looking forward to
[2:00:56] that
[2:00:57] day this message is taking us there
[2:01:01] because the pillar of fire accompanies
[2:01:03] the message
[2:01:05] always and we are not complete we are
[2:01:08] not
[2:01:10] stationary until we go to Glory remember
[2:01:12] brother bandam said when John saw the
[2:01:15] ark it was stationary amen that's what
[2:01:18] he said he said because they went
[2:01:20] through the church ages and he said then
[2:01:22] John saw it
[2:01:24] stationary brother Braham said in the
[2:01:26] name of the
[2:01:28] Lord that God who came out in the old
[2:01:32] days as the musicians will come and led
[2:01:35] the Church of God out of Egypt out of
[2:01:40] bondage into
[2:01:42] Freedom has come down again in the same
[2:01:45] manner to lead his church spiritual out
[2:01:49] of bondage of sin first
[2:01:52] by the Holy Spirit sickness next and the
[2:01:57] third step is to go into glory and to
[2:02:01] take this Mortal and make it
[2:02:04] immortality and to the Transfiguration
[2:02:06] of our human bod to transform them into
[2:02:11] the perfect
[2:02:13] image of the Son of God amen amen this
[2:02:18] is what happens next amen this word that
[2:02:21] beats in your heart

[2:02:39] troubles grandchildren troubles it might
[2:02:42] be a day just like
[2:02:45] this one day was different because God
[2:02:48] said so amen
[2:02:52] I feel a change amen I feel like my
[2:02:55] faith is
[2:02:56] unlimited amen dear God I feel like I'm

[2:03:00] [Music]
[2:03:02] vision God will begin to take us to a
[2:03:05] glorified
[2:03:07] body and God has called us to do it
[2:03:11] Amen brother Bram said God will do
[2:03:14] nothing but he uses Believers to fulfill
[2:03:16] his
[2:03:17] word how many believe you need to create
[2:03:21] that atmosphere around you I am a
[2:03:23] believer I believe this
