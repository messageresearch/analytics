[26:44] considering jesus
[26:54] [Applause]
[26:59] i tell you what i i'm sometimes can be
[27:04] just a little bit
[27:06] abrupt with people and not too
[27:09] far back in time i had a conversation

[27:12] young man and he was saying well i don't
[27:15] know about god

[27:18] think of this i i just
[27:20] i'm not even sure there is a god he said
[27:22] i'm just not sure there's really
[27:24] anything we just live and die and i said
[27:28] so have you ever
[27:29] ever even considered being a christian

[27:39] don't knock it till you try it that's
[27:41] right
[27:43] hallelujah i want to finish the last of
[27:46] this

[28:48] when he wraps his
[28:49] arms around her father we're asking you
[28:53] lord just to let
[28:54] just a little trickle father if it would
[28:57] be to start
[28:58] but just let faith touch her lord let
[29:00] something touch her life lord that she
[29:02] would recognize
[29:03] that something in her life is not
[29:06] complete and
[29:07] father i believe that's what's happening
[29:09] even now as we speak that she
[29:12] recognizing something is missing
[29:14] now lord we were all in this case so
[29:17] father we are not judgmental
[29:18] but lord we have come oh lord
[29:23] we have come in compassion lord

[29:37] preached lord
[29:38] we now send your holy spirit out after
[29:41] demi
[29:43] lord father we could talk lord for days
[29:46] weeks months and years and not convince
[29:48] her
[29:49] the lord your holy spirit lord we ask
[29:52] you to surround her morning noon and
[29:54] night may she know a piece like she has
[29:56] never known in her life and father made

[30:30] father that is our hearts desire we also
[30:32] send our love father
[30:34] lord strength strengthen faith in the
[30:36] name of jesus christ
[30:52] hallelujah thank you lord amen
[30:57] well we already cracked my emotional
[30:59] veneer this morning
[31:02] amen
[31:12] well saints i want to preach to you once
[31:14] again brother alex will you start by
[31:16] putting up the graph
[31:18] as it were you know i don't always make
[31:21] things easy for brother alex and
[31:24] he keeps meeting the expectations and
[31:28] telling me hey i'm i'm prepared for you
[31:30] next time so
[31:32] amen as we look at this saints as i've
[31:34] said before we'll say again
[31:36] as long as we are preaching on this uh
[31:39] these
[31:39] topics here kind of going down through
[31:41] this
[31:42] we we realize that the very
[31:46] plan of god the will of god is already
[31:48] worked out and we'll touch on that in
[31:50] in a little further in the service that
[31:52] it really doesn't matter what man's
[31:54] ideas or what man's thoughts are
[31:57] that god's will will be done amen god
[32:00] will bring his word to pass he will
[32:03] do what he said he would do amen
[32:07] so we see as the word has said about our
[32:10] lord jesus christ
[32:12] we know that um he is our all in
[32:16] all he is everything to you and i and
[32:19] satan being a part of creation
[32:22] amen tried to assert his part as
[32:25] dominion
[32:27] of eternity but has failed because uh
[32:30] something that is created is subject to
[32:33] the creator
[32:35] and uh so we see satan coming down
[32:38] and while we at least not today we'll be
[32:41] talking about those that are the
[32:44] completely
[32:45] sold out to the devil that would be
[32:47] those that
[32:48] would be into all kinds of absolute
[32:50] satanic worship
[32:52] and and uh those kind of things you know
[32:56] uh you'll see you know i remember it
[32:59] come from my generation you know the
[33:01] world was shocked when ozzy osbourne
[33:04] stood up in front of the world and
[33:06] and said i i worship satan every day
[33:09] you know his music his behavior
[33:12] everything was already way out there
[33:13] people thought he was strange
[33:15] but he was one of the first to stand up
[33:18] and what scared the people was and they
[33:22] realized that their children
[33:24] adored aussie osborne so they were
[33:28] adoring the music of a man who was
[33:30] openly satanic and it shocked the world
[33:34] my brother and sister and they tried to
[33:36] censor him
[33:38] but it didn't work because the devil
[33:41] won't be quieted
[33:42] until he lands in the pit amen so
[33:46] there there are those that are sold out
[33:48] there
[33:49] and we'll just run a brief rundown on
[33:51] this because i'm probably really not
[33:53] going to preach much on them i don't
[33:54] find much interest in preaching on the
[33:56] devil
[33:58] but you'll see those people are
[34:00] completely sold out they're the ones
[34:02] now sometimes saints i think that we
[34:04] ought to catch the revelation
[34:06] that these people sold out to the devil
[34:08] have because they're not afraid to tell
[34:10] anybody anywhere anyplace anytime that
[34:12] they worship the devil
[34:14] amen and yet as christians sometimes we
[34:16] find now i'm not scraping no knees here
[34:18] but
[34:19] sometimes we find ourselves apprehensive
[34:21] about speaking up
[34:23] i i don't want to ruin this fragile
[34:25] relationship
[34:26] or this new friendship or this uh no my
[34:29] brother and sister come on if we just
[34:30] get anointed
[34:31] in the correct effect amen we can stand
[34:34] and we can project christ to the world
[34:36] anytime or any place
[34:37] and so we look at this middle wall of
[34:40] partition my brother and sister
[34:42] this is the place that these humans as
[34:45] it were
[34:46] will come down and they have uh uh
[34:50] had the uh opening of the anointing
[34:53] of the devil has come upon them i won't
[34:56] mention a name because it's not our
[34:58] focus today but i remember a story of a
[35:00] young man he tells how that as a young
[35:03] man he was quite a good musician had a
[35:05] good voice
[35:06] wrote songs and and he has such a desire
[35:10] to be successful one time he went out in
[35:12] the woods and
[35:13] and he went out there and uh bellard and
[35:16] actually got down on his hands and knees
[35:18] like a bull and threw dirt in the air
[35:20] and
[35:21] told the devil i'll do anything you want
[35:24] if you'll make me successful
[35:25] and after that he become wildly
[35:27] successful
[35:28] as an opening to many of the great names
[35:31] in that in that world
[35:33] and uh but there was something wrong and
[35:35] he knew
[35:36] something was wrong and one night
[35:38] traveling down the highway
[35:40] he said a demon come into the the
[35:43] back of the motor coach that he was
[35:45] riding in
[35:46] and stood right there and said it is
[35:49] time
[35:49] to redeem your soul
[35:56] whoa and an angel come in that same room
[35:59] and said it is time
[36:01] to redeem your soul
[36:05] and he cried out to god
[36:08] now he has a different view than we do
[36:11] he still does what they call christian
[36:13] rock and etc
[36:14] but the man stands as a witness even in
[36:17] that world right
[36:20] that you can serve god you don't have to
[36:23] serve the devil
[36:24] and so we see my brother and sister in
[36:26] the middle wall of partition being torn
[36:28] down
[36:29] demons come right into these people's
[36:31] presence
[36:33] demons come and speak to them demons
[36:36] give suggestions and guidelines and
[36:38] demons give them business advice and
[36:41] demons talk to them
[36:44] and quite honestly if all you wanted was
[36:46] earthly
[36:48] success satan could provide it
[36:51] all remember he told jesus if you'll
[36:53] just bow down and worship me
[36:56] i'll give all of this to you
[36:59] bill gates just become the largest
[37:01] landholder in the united states
[37:03] according to the news
[37:05] and um my brother and sister i'm not
[37:07] throwing bill gates to the devil
[37:10] but you see just because you have
[37:12] acquired
[37:13] mass wealth doesn't mean you have
[37:16] anything more than
[37:18] mass wealth i tell you i'd rather have
[37:22] jesus
[37:23] amen all of that won't do him a bit when
[37:26] the devil shows up one day
[37:28] or even if the angel shows up and says
[37:30] it's time to redeem your soul
[37:32] hallelujah so we see this what does it
[37:34] do it causes people that are cold enough
[37:38] we won't even go there today leave me
[37:40] depressed but the carnage
[37:42] they leave behind them right here in the
[37:44] natural shows up in the news
[37:46] constantly amen
[37:50] but you know there's something about
[37:52] that
[37:53] in the end they got exactly what they
[37:56] expected
[37:58] so they have no disappointment they have
[38:00] no
[38:01] no tears to shed they've made their
[38:04] declaration that
[38:06] all i'm searching for is right here
[38:09] right now amen aren't you glad because
[38:12] the scripture tells us if
[38:14] in this life this is our hope
[38:18] i'm going to just paraphrase it then
[38:21] we're men most miserable
[38:24] if all we have is this right here we are
[38:27] men
[38:27] most miserable i'm glad for eternal life
[38:31] hallelujah
[38:32] i want to talk to you today as we look
[38:35] at this what's happening in the carnal
[38:37] and religious blendings
[38:38] coming together and the reason that we
[38:41] graph this out i explained it before but
[38:42] i want to just bring it
[38:43] you see my brother and sister what
[38:45] happens is is
[38:47] we don't have the religious over here
[38:49] with the religious
[38:50] because these anointings are coming
[38:52] because there is a religious
[38:54] spirit that comes from here and
[38:57] the prophet of god talks about how uh in
[39:00] this quote today if we
[39:01] get in gear and get going you'll see
[39:03] that sometimes even real believers get a
[39:06] carnal anointing
[39:08] and so we have to deal with our own
[39:10] flesh i know none of you
[39:12] have that problem but it's people like
[39:13] you amen
[39:15] that have that problem sometimes we just
[39:17] get carnal
[39:19] amen and and we have to we have to deal
[39:21] with that but i'm glad see the holy
[39:23] spirit comes
[39:24] and um you know brings us to a place
[39:27] that we realize man i'm not where i
[39:29] should be
[39:30] amen you know and the thing is is um you
[39:33] know everywhere you go
[39:34] not everywhere you go but a lot of
[39:35] places you go especially in healthcare
[39:37] doctor's office etc
[39:38] you got to have your temperature taken
[39:40] before you go in the door
[39:42] and uh you know i was thinking about
[39:43] just buying one going down here to
[39:45] walgreens one of these places taking one
[39:47] of these health
[39:48] temperature checkers just so that we um
[39:51] as believers could have one at the door
[39:53] and when we come to church amen we don't
[39:56] want anybody
[39:57] usurping any authority or condemn
[39:59] condemnation over you so you could just
[40:01] stop take your own temperature
[40:03] amen but it won't register the
[40:06] temperature we need to take
[40:08] amen but we should be every day taking
[40:11] that temperature lord what is happening
[40:13] saints i'm not ashamed i am ashamed but
[40:16] not ashamed to admit to you
[40:18] i find myself sometimes you know just
[40:20] wavering a little bit
[40:22] on the chilled side just the stress of
[40:24] life
[40:25] uh the cares of life all these things
[40:28] just
[40:29] find myself but god is gracious
[40:32] see we don't have to look down on
[40:33] herself and we don't have to you know
[40:35] just like oh man
[40:36] if i even twitch they're going to think
[40:38] he's talking about me
[40:41] but it's the reality we live in right
[40:44] because in the hot side
[40:45] satan's got only one direction to take
[40:48] you and he's trying hard
[40:51] but god said i'll keep you on fire you
[40:53] just stay in me
[40:54] i'll keep you on fire hallelujah so
[40:57] let's just go into our service today
[41:00] uh once again redemption's manifestation
[41:02] i want to speak to you on tested
[41:04] by word and deed let's just stand as we
[41:08] would go into the scriptures
[41:10] amen
[41:15] i think we forgot a important
[41:18] part today um
[41:23] so good to have brother prashant and
[41:24] sister contra with us
[41:26] amen just a part of the part of the body
[41:30] of christ amen and
[41:32] you know i have to be real careful how i
[41:34] word this so it doesn't come out wrong
[41:36] but
[41:36] i think that um they've been kidnapped
[41:40] uh drug away to a far-off land
[41:44] held hostage there um and uh
[41:48] i i believe that uh god's got his swat
[41:51] team on the way
[41:52] to uh release them from that sometime
[41:55] soon and
[41:56] good to see our brother adam amen
[41:59] hallelujah now the god of hope
[42:03] fill you with all joy and peace in
[42:06] believing
[42:08] that you may abound in hope through the
[42:10] power
[42:11] of the holy ghost don't you love that
[42:13] verse
[42:14] i want to read it again i love it so
[42:16] much now the god of hope
[42:18] amen that's my god fill you with all joy
[42:22] and peace in believing
[42:23] that you may abound in hope through the
[42:25] power of the holy ghost
[42:27] and i myself also am persuaded of you
[42:31] my brethren that ye also are full of
[42:33] goodness filled with all knowledge
[42:36] able also to admonish one another
[42:39] nevertheless brethren i have written
[42:42] them more boldly unto you and some sort
[42:45] as putting you in mind because of the
[42:47] grace that it's given to me of god
[42:51] i've said many times i'll say it again
[42:54] if the apostle paul was here preaching
[42:56] in laodicea
[42:58] they would shout him down as being
[43:00] boastful and arrogant
[43:05] couldn't wouldn't accept a man
[43:08] that could speak with such confidence of
[43:10] his position
[43:12] in the word praise the lord you realize
[43:15] the same
[43:16] confidence that paul spoke of himself
[43:19] in the plan of god should be the same
[43:21] confidence you and i
[43:23] are speaking of ourself in the plan of
[43:26] god
[43:29] so paul wasn't so far out there that it
[43:31] just borders on some kind of crazy thing
[43:35] we're actually according to the prophet
[43:37] of god
[43:39] how did he say that
[43:44] we're living under our privilege
[43:50] we're not being assumptive
[43:54] we're not arrogant we're not presumptive
[43:57] we're living under
[44:00] our privilege i want that to really soak
[44:04] in saints
[44:04] the next time it's time to say i got the
[44:07] victory or to say all is well i guess
[44:11] amen i want you to stop and say am i
[44:14] living
[44:15] at my privilege or am i living under
[44:18] my privilege
[44:27] we could turn a whole nother way and
[44:29] preach a whole sermon right there
[44:35] that i should be the minister of jesus
[44:37] christ to the gentiles ministering the
[44:40] gospel of god that the offering up of
[44:42] the gentiles might be acceptable
[44:44] being sanctified by the holy ghost
[44:48] i have therefore whereof
[44:51] i may glory through jesus christ in
[44:54] those things
[44:55] which pertain to god for i will not dare
[44:58] to speak
[44:59] of anything of those things which christ
[45:02] hath not
[45:03] wrought by me
[45:06] i think my mic is something's happening
[45:09] here
[45:10] i want to interpret that paul is not
[45:13] saying i have exclusive
[45:15] rights but paul's also saying here
[45:19] i'm not going to preach theory to you
[45:25] come on saints we don't need a theory
[45:29] about if we're good people we go to
[45:30] heaven
[45:32] we need the power of the resurrection of
[45:35] jesus christ the very
[45:37] life in us amen not a theory about if
[45:41] everything
[45:41] falls in place and we're good children
[45:44] but the true
[45:46] down to the bedrock facts that we
[45:49] as sons and daughters of god were born
[45:51] in him
[45:52] before the foundation of the world amen
[45:55] we were birthed
[45:56] out of the word amen hallelujah
[46:00] and so paul is telling you i'm not going
[46:02] to preach anything
[46:04] christ has not wrought by me to make the
[46:06] gentiles
[46:07] obedient by word
[46:11] through mighty signs and wonders by the
[46:13] power of the spirit of god so that from
[46:15] jerusalem and round about
[46:17] into i tried to even find a
[46:19] pronunciation on this word i looked it
[46:21] up like five different ways
[46:24] anybody got a guess a lyricum
[46:27] sounds good to me i have fully preached
[46:30] the gospel
[46:30] of christ heavenly father we just ask
[46:33] you lord today
[46:34] come and move in our midst speak to our
[46:36] hearts lord how we love you
[46:39] thank you for this time lord my heart is
[46:42] still moved lord by
[46:44] my brother christian's desire
[46:47] father just ask you to move in their
[46:49] midst father
[46:50] lord let your holy spirit come with such
[46:52] authority bind them
[46:54] closer together as husband and wife than
[46:56] they've ever been in their life
[46:58] bring forth and manifest the life of
[47:00] christ so visible so powerful
[47:03] that it is undeniable we ask in the name
[47:06] of jesus
[47:06] amen you may be seated
[47:22] want to look back into last sunday for
[47:24] just a moment and
[47:26] we remember the great conflict between
[47:29] jephthah
[47:30] the uh you know if you guys ever feel
[47:34] the need to criticize me don't bother i
[47:36] got a wife and a daughter
[47:43] dad you kept saying gideonites
[47:46] gideonites gideonites
[47:49] and other people were like yeah we know
[47:50] what you were talking about i love you
[47:55] no i wasn't throwing jerry under the bus
[47:57] i was just trying to be funny
[48:04] anyway the gileadites
[48:07] and the ephraimites amen that all
[48:10] culminated
[48:11] in a word test we see them now brother
[48:14] chris i was going to actually make a
[48:16] sermon out of the comment brother chris
[48:17] made to me in the four year last sunday
[48:19] and i might still drag it into a sermon
[48:21] but i believe it was brother chris one
[48:24] of you made a comment to me about isn't
[48:26] that interesting
[48:27] that it was at the crossing of the
[48:29] jordan
[48:32] it wasn't some other stream somewhere
[48:34] this all took place at a crossing over
[48:38] the word test can't get to the other
[48:40] side without the word test
[48:43] hallelujah and i thank the lord my
[48:45] because he's prepared us when it comes
[48:47] to that crossing time
[48:49] that the word test will not be something
[48:52] we have to stop
[48:53] reminds me sister sue shared a couple
[48:56] gave me a couple books his presence and
[48:58] and one of them was talking about d-day
[49:00] and how this man was there
[49:02] and and they parachuted into uh normandy
[49:05] and
[49:05] and uh they were consolidating a a a a
[49:09] bridge area and uh they had a little
[49:12] clicker thing and when they clicked that
[49:14] and they got an
[49:14] answer uh clicks back they were supposed
[49:17] to speak the code word and
[49:19] the guy that they were commenting he
[49:21] said you know my friend so and so
[49:23] he said i don't know him how he survived
[49:25] the war
[49:26] because there they are clicking their
[49:28] little thing and only a few feet away
[49:30] is another man clicking it and finally
[49:33] the other man said what's the password
[49:36] and he said i don't know i'm from
[49:37] baltimore though
[49:41] he didn't know the word amen that's not
[49:43] going to happen to the bride the word's
[49:45] going to become her she is the word
[49:47] right
[49:48] we don't have to have some special code
[49:50] word as it were
[49:51] to make it over jordan on that day
[49:53] because we are the word and the word
[49:55] will speak out what it takes for us to
[49:57] go
[49:58] and you know he said later on that same
[50:00] man was in another situation where he
[50:02] needed to remember a word
[50:04] and um actually got shot by the century
[50:06] because
[50:07] it come time to give the code word he
[50:09] couldn't he's speaking in english he
[50:11] goes i don't remember i don't remember
[50:12] the guard just shot him
[50:14] and the guard didn't get in trouble
[50:15] right because that's his job if you
[50:17] don't know the code word you get shot
[50:19] amen so as we look at this we realize
[50:21] how that
[50:22] this culminated in a word test and
[50:25] actually come
[50:26] to life and death in that word test and
[50:28] we see
[50:29] how my brother and sister that satan the
[50:31] great impersonator
[50:32] he he knows how to speak uh he is so
[50:35] clever
[50:36] you know we look at this just taking a
[50:38] quick glimpse of eve
[50:40] we realize how he was so capable
[50:43] of uh forming these sentences forming
[50:46] these phrases
[50:48] putting this in such a way that as he's
[50:50] speaking to eve
[50:52] while he is speaking so much truth he
[50:54] was lying to her
[50:56] and so in that so cleverly doing that he
[50:59] was able to frame the words
[51:01] in such a way my brother and sister he's
[51:04] still in that business today he is
[51:06] saying one thing but leaves the
[51:08] image of something else amen so while
[51:11] he's speaking
[51:12] actually speaking death people believe
[51:15] that they have life
[51:16] and we'll touch on that just a little
[51:19] bit further down
[51:20] just to bring this out how this is
[51:23] but i want to make the point to you this
[51:25] morning
[51:26] that satan's deeds do not match his
[51:29] words
[51:31] so when one would find himself
[51:35] being convinced the words
[51:38] are presenting an image look beyond the
[51:42] words
[51:45] come on saints when the devil starts to
[51:47] to coax people
[51:49] away from serving god don't look at his
[51:53] words
[51:54] look at his deeds
[51:58] you see anyone that would say well i do
[52:00] this for you because i love you
[52:03] then love ought to be what is being
[52:04] produced
[52:06] and satan does not love you
[52:10] the word brings about a love right
[52:13] the word says love is corrective the
[52:16] word
[52:16] says that god loved you before the
[52:18] foundation of the world
[52:20] the word shows us very clearly that
[52:22] redemption
[52:23] is the full manifestation of jesus
[52:25] christ
[52:28] not the manifestation of the mystery of
[52:30] christ it's the manifestation of christ
[52:33] his whole plan is to redeem a bride
[52:36] see he doesn't have to put doctrine he
[52:39] doesn't have to put tenants of faith he
[52:40] doesn't have to put all of those things
[52:42] in there
[52:43] because he could encapsulate that in the
[52:45] simple plan of redemption
[52:47] and that included all of these things
[52:50] that were necessary
[52:51] to redeem you and i amen you see we get
[52:54] it down and say well it's doctrine we
[52:56] must believe this we must believe that
[52:58] that's good we must but my brother and
[53:00] sister god encapsulated that all
[53:02] and could put a title on that and say
[53:04] redemption
[53:06] and you will find yourself in there
[53:09] you'll find yourself a part of the plan
[53:11] of god
[53:12] because redemption is what it was all
[53:14] about it wasn't about practicing
[53:16] creation otherwise he went
[53:20] let there be cool
[53:24] done let's see if i can make humans
[53:27] let there be wow
[53:30] good done light
[53:34] whatever it might be but you see god put
[53:37] together the whole plan my brother and
[53:39] sister so that we could come
[53:40] and i hope my closing quote today will
[53:43] will tie a little of this together with
[53:45] you
[53:46] if we ever get there so we look at this
[53:48] and realize what god is doing but see
[53:50] satan's deeds
[53:51] never match his words
[53:55] now i want to go into romans the second
[53:57] chapter and
[53:58] look at this real quick therefore thou
[54:02] art inexcusable o man whosoever
[54:05] thou art that judges for when
[54:08] wherein thou judges another thou
[54:11] condemnest thyself
[54:13] for thou that judges does the same
[54:16] things
[54:19] my brother and sister that's why i'm
[54:21] just going to put it in blunt terms
[54:23] that's why i tend to shy away from
[54:25] judgmental people because the scripture
[54:29] says that they're actually
[54:31] judging themselves so what they're
[54:33] pressing down on you
[54:34] about they have the same problems
[54:42] much the better that i could stand as a
[54:45] minister and tell you
[54:47] i'm only here by god's grace
[54:50] i'm only serving god because god loves
[54:53] me so much
[54:55] amen i'm only here because he was
[54:57] willing to pay the price for me
[54:59] but not only pay the price for me he has
[55:02] continued
[55:03] in figurative sense continued to pay the
[55:06] price
[55:09] and young people god's grace is greater
[55:11] all of us god's grace is greater than
[55:13] our problems
[55:15] hallelujah so let's just all keep
[55:17] marching together let's not judge one
[55:19] another let's not
[55:20] be harsh to one another let's pray for
[55:22] one another let's lift one another up
[55:24] amen and let the word of faith come and
[55:26] raise us all up into heavenly places
[55:29] because otherwise we find ourselves then
[55:31] subject to the word
[55:33] but we are sure now look don't
[55:35] misunderstand
[55:37] strong preaching doesn't mean it's
[55:40] judging you let me just put that out
[55:43] there
[55:44] strong preaching amen the word of god
[55:48] the holy ghost will tear the hide off of
[55:50] a believer
[55:51] to get him into the right place okay so
[55:54] if you hear
[55:54] somebody preaching strong don't say well
[55:57] he's judging me
[55:58] maybe you ought to judge yourself say
[56:01] well did what he just say apply to me
[56:04] i don't believe in pitchfork religion
[56:06] either right
[56:07] but did you know that in some sense or
[56:10] essence of that it's acceptable
[56:13] you bunch a lion no good rascals
[56:17] i'm not lying and i'm not a rascal
[56:20] what the preacher just said doesn't
[56:22] apply to me
[56:24] what about you
[56:24] [Laughter]
[56:29] so so we don't have to take it to heart
[56:30] right the preacher hammers down on
[56:32] something
[56:33] that doesn't apply to you don't be
[56:35] offended about that like why is he
[56:37] uh i think he was looking at me he said
[56:39] that
[56:40] if it doesn't apply to you just let it
[56:41] go just just let it go
[56:44] hallelujah but when it does apply to you
[56:48] amen no problem
[56:52] just put the shoe on wear it
[56:56] now let me get serious about preaching
[56:58] here we're going to be here a long time
[57:00] my goodness
[57:03] yeah we might be here shorter than you
[57:06] think because i have to dice this thing
[57:07] up
[57:08] amen but we are sure that the judgment
[57:10] of god is according to truth against
[57:12] them which commits such things
[57:14] and thinketh thou this o man that judges
[57:17] them which do such things
[57:18] and doeth the same that thou shalt
[57:20] escape the judgment of god
[57:23] or despiseth thou the riches of his
[57:25] goodness and forbearance and
[57:27] long-suffering not knowing that the
[57:28] goodness of god leadeth thee
[57:30] to repentance aren't you glad this is uh
[57:33] uh encapsulated right here in verse four
[57:36] my brother and sister
[57:37] this is what brings you and i to
[57:39] repentance can i go back
[57:40] and look at this it is the riches of his
[57:43] goodness
[57:44] his forbearance his long
[57:47] suffering the goodness of god
[57:51] is what leads us to repentance oh my
[57:54] it's not just a whim it's not just a
[57:56] little
[57:56] something fluttered through the air and
[57:58] we felt like repenting
[57:59] it's god moving in our midst on our
[58:02] behalf
[58:03] wooing us amen but after thy hardness
[58:07] an impending heart treasureth up unto
[58:09] thyself wrath against the day of wrath
[58:12] and revelation of the righteous judgment
[58:14] of god
[58:15] who will render to every man according
[58:18] to
[58:18] his deeds which is also where i pulled
[58:21] portion of my
[58:22] title today to them who by patient
[58:25] continuance in well-doing seek for glory
[58:28] and honor and immortality and internal
[58:30] life
[58:31] look at this patient continuance
[58:36] but unto them that are contentious do
[58:38] not obey the truth but obey
[58:40] unrighteousness
[58:41] indignation and wrath
[58:44] tribulation and anguish upon every soul
[58:47] of man that doeth evil of the jew first
[58:49] and also
[58:50] the gentile of the gentile but glory and
[58:52] honor and peace to every man that
[58:54] worketh good
[58:56] to the jew first and also to the gentile
[58:59] for there is no respect of persons with
[59:02] god
[59:03] i like that hallelujah
[59:07] for as many as have sinned without law
[59:09] shall also perish without law
[59:12] and as many as have sinned in the law
[59:14] shall be judged by the law
[59:16] for not the hearers of the law are just
[59:19] before god
[59:20] but the doers of the law shall be
[59:22] justified
[59:23] amen blessings upon the word of god
[59:27] now saints i'm going to take into this a
[59:30] quite
[59:31] long lengthy uh excerpts
[59:34] out of the resume of the ages of the
[59:36] church age book
[59:38] and i want you as we would come here to
[59:40] just look at we're looking at these
[59:42] spirits and
[59:43] we're looking at this high breeding and
[59:45] how that these spirits could come
[59:47] it just sometimes doesn't seem practical
[59:49] that a carnal spirit would be
[59:51] upon a godly person uh but it doesn't
[59:54] seem
[59:55] uh realistic when you look at that that
[59:57] a incredibly religious spirit would be
[1:00:00] on someone
[1:00:01] that uh really isn't fully committed to
[1:00:04] serving god
[1:00:05] so he says right here he said what was
[1:00:07] planted in the first age
[1:00:09] will develop in the second age in all
[1:00:12] other ages until it comes to maturity
[1:00:14] and harvest we're in that season thus in
[1:00:17] the sumerian age we expect an
[1:00:19] enlargement
[1:00:20] enlightenment of the church corporates
[1:00:22] history through revelation of the spirit
[1:00:25] so we're just expecting growth right
[1:00:27] saints i tell you as a pastor
[1:00:29] i just fully expect that we week after
[1:00:32] week after week as the
[1:00:34] brothers and sisters of grace uh that we
[1:00:36] grow spiritually
[1:00:38] we don't want to find ourselves as a
[1:00:40] church becoming more and more carnal
[1:00:42] we don't want to find ourselves becoming
[1:00:44] more and more loose about what we
[1:00:45] believe and
[1:00:46] and loosening the standards because we
[1:00:48] don't want our children to leave
[1:00:50] and we don't want this family or that
[1:00:51] family or those to leave
[1:00:53] so we got to loosen it up brother and
[1:00:55] sister i fully have expectation
[1:00:57] that we ourselves now not the minister
[1:01:01] coming out here and putting out you know
[1:01:03] as it were like a pole vault or a high
[1:01:05] jump and putting the bar up and saying
[1:01:07] here's a standard you need to meet but
[1:01:10] my brother and sister
[1:01:11] honestly from my heart i tell you this i
[1:01:13] have full expectation
[1:01:14] in the word of god that the bride of
[1:01:17] christ
[1:01:18] grace tabernacle would be coming up here
[1:01:20] maybe you know and even around and if it
[1:01:22] was figurative here
[1:01:24] i just be out here going well okay
[1:01:27] we'll just raise the standard for myself
[1:01:31] i don't need someone to raise the
[1:01:33] standard for me i
[1:01:35] i love the lord i want to serve him with
[1:01:37] all of my heart there's something inside
[1:01:39] of me
[1:01:39] i would come to this figurative standard
[1:01:41] here and i would be
[1:01:43] not not telling the whole church hey
[1:01:44] church i decided this sunday to raise my
[1:01:47] standard
[1:01:49] no we we do it it's personal
[1:01:54] it's who we are we raise the standard
[1:01:57] sometimes we'll stay at that level for a
[1:01:59] while
[1:01:59] go through some hard battles some hard
[1:02:01] trials and then we'll come
[1:02:03] another day and we'll raise that
[1:02:04] standard a little higher you see that's
[1:02:06] what my full expectation is that's what
[1:02:08] i desire to see
[1:02:09] and so here it is thus in this morning
[1:02:12] age we expect an enlargement and
[1:02:13] enlightenment
[1:02:14] of the church corporates history through
[1:02:16] the revelation of the spirit
[1:02:17] in this age the hatred of the false vine
[1:02:20] increases
[1:02:21] so actually they face instead of a a
[1:02:24] lovely
[1:02:25] time to worship god and a liberty that
[1:02:27] the hate is building up the pressure
[1:02:29] pushing back
[1:02:31] is building up now saints i want to just
[1:02:33] throw this into you
[1:02:34] that was five church ages ago
[1:02:38] now imagine what this uh
[1:02:41] uh apostasy spirit
[1:02:44] is pushing back how it's pushing back
[1:02:46] today how much it's trying to
[1:02:49] hinder the real sons and daughters of
[1:02:51] god in the day that we live in
[1:02:53] amen so just take that as a mental note
[1:02:56] to realize
[1:02:56] it's had all these ages of building up
[1:02:59] building up building up
[1:03:00] and this is what you're facing today is
[1:03:02] the build
[1:03:03] up of every one of those ages now you
[1:03:05] say well brother paul
[1:03:06] are we are we more important or more
[1:03:09] spiritual
[1:03:10] or or anything like that than those
[1:03:12] saints
[1:03:13] absolutely not my brother and sister god
[1:03:15] just poured more grace in
[1:03:17] amen he didn't make us more spiritual we
[1:03:19] don't have more holy ghost
[1:03:22] you understand what i'm saying like
[1:03:24] we'll get to heaven and
[1:03:25] they'll all be just like oh if we could
[1:03:27] have been like you
[1:03:30] but god's pouring grace in pouring more
[1:03:33] grace in
[1:03:34] and we're going to finish hallelujah
[1:03:38] so this age of hatred is a false mind
[1:03:41] increases
[1:03:42] so they have verse nine separated
[1:03:44] themselves from the company of the true
[1:03:46] they went out from them they were liars
[1:03:48] they called themselves what they were
[1:03:49] not
[1:03:50] now i want to focus right here my
[1:03:52] brother and sister uh on this
[1:03:54] they called themselves what they were
[1:03:56] not you see we're going to come into a
[1:03:57] time in this part of my title what
[1:03:59] what focused me to this title there's
[1:04:01] coming a time my brother and sister
[1:04:04] that god is going to judge you and i by
[1:04:06] the words we speak
[1:04:08] of ourself it won't be what we claim
[1:04:12] someone else is there's some people that
[1:04:14] i i encounter
[1:04:16] they're just they're so worried about
[1:04:18] what someone else is going to say
[1:04:20] about them as a believer uh you know do
[1:04:23] they have faith are they this or they
[1:04:25] that
[1:04:25] forget about that nonsense my brother
[1:04:27] and sister what they say about you
[1:04:29] will not matter but what will happen is
[1:04:32] is what you say about yourself
[1:04:34] so as the prophet of god is showing us
[1:04:36] here in the resume of the ages you see
[1:04:38] they said they were real believers and
[1:04:41] they weren't
[1:04:42] so god said i'm going to take you at
[1:04:44] your word
[1:04:46] and i will judge you on what you said
[1:04:49] you were that's why it's important
[1:04:52] saints now i don't want to scuff any
[1:04:53] knees here
[1:04:54] but that's why it's important when we
[1:04:56] say we're believers
[1:04:57] let's be believers let's not just say
[1:05:00] we're believers and just kind of skin
[1:05:02] along on the surface of this
[1:05:04] because there come a day god will judge
[1:05:06] us for what we
[1:05:08] say we are so what we need to do is say
[1:05:11] lord i'm just
[1:05:12] a sinner saved by grace but i believe
[1:05:15] your word
[1:05:16] amen don't now don't go below your
[1:05:20] privilege
[1:05:22] are you with me don't go below your
[1:05:24] privilege i'm a son of god i'm a
[1:05:26] daughter of god
[1:05:28] amen but let's not take a position like
[1:05:32] we are it
[1:05:33] when we're not because without god's
[1:05:37] grace
[1:05:39] we wouldn't have got past the first
[1:05:40] church age
[1:05:43] amen they called themselves
[1:05:46] what they are not but did god destroy
[1:05:50] them it's just interesting see so
[1:05:52] they're walking around
[1:05:54] in the churches of the day in the
[1:05:55] temples of the day
[1:05:57] in the religious circles of the day
[1:05:59] declaring
[1:06:00] that they are god's mouthpiece
[1:06:04] you would almost think i i i know that
[1:06:07] it's a good deal i'm not god
[1:06:10] because it would be just okay done with
[1:06:12] them
[1:06:14] no god says you know what i'm going to
[1:06:16] leave them in place
[1:06:17] because it's going to all come to the
[1:06:18] harvest so the full
[1:06:21] fruition of the word my brother and
[1:06:23] sister wasn't
[1:06:24] fast forward six church ages come to the
[1:06:27] seventh give the word to you and i and
[1:06:28] we go into rapture
[1:06:30] it took all seven church ages it took
[1:06:33] all of the word of all of that time to
[1:06:35] bring to us
[1:06:36] to come to a place that we come to
[1:06:38] fruition and maturity
[1:06:40] the same is with the vine amen with that
[1:06:43] false mind
[1:06:44] so they have to come so when it come
[1:06:47] there they called themselves what they
[1:06:48] weren't but god didn't destroy them
[1:06:50] he let him alone and both will go to the
[1:06:52] harvest
[1:06:53] but lord they should be destroyed for
[1:06:56] they
[1:06:56] are destroying thy people
[1:07:00] they are killing them now you guys that
[1:07:02] read ahead
[1:07:07] see what's happening you know what
[1:07:09] nothing i i would almost put it this way
[1:07:12] almost nothing's more grievous to a
[1:07:15] sincere son or daughter of god
[1:07:18] than to see someone inserting something
[1:07:21] else into the message
[1:07:23] and convincing people to take that
[1:07:26] because you're looking upon that and
[1:07:28] realizing that they're actually
[1:07:30] killing them people oh
[1:07:34] you talk about something that just gets
[1:07:35] you grievous and i'm sorry after i get
[1:07:38] over grieving
[1:07:39] grieving i get angry amen and it seems
[1:07:42] like you guys don't see me grieving
[1:07:44] what you see is me angry and it doesn't
[1:07:46] present a good image but the reason is
[1:07:48] is i would be their calling lord they're
[1:07:51] destroying thy people they're killing
[1:07:53] them lord
[1:07:53] do away with him but you know look what
[1:07:56] god's answer was
[1:07:57] he says no let them alone but to my
[1:08:00] bride
[1:08:01] he didn't go down there to the one
[1:08:02] that's injecting uh
[1:08:04] denominational ideas and injecting man's
[1:08:07] ideas
[1:08:08] and twisting the word and perverting it
[1:08:10] and cutting it off and forming it into a
[1:08:12] whole other thing
[1:08:12] he didn't go to them and say whoa you
[1:08:14] guys stop that he comes to his
[1:08:17] bride amen and because he knows they've
[1:08:20] got to come to the harvest
[1:08:22] and so he comes to his bride here and he
[1:08:25] says now
[1:08:26] be thou faithful unto death he doesn't
[1:08:29] tell him
[1:08:30] he's already warned him about the false
[1:08:31] vine but now being persecuted
[1:08:33] he tells them hey hey look what i want
[1:08:35] you to do
[1:08:36] is not spend all your time uh fighting
[1:08:39] against this finding it i guess
[1:08:41] just be faithful unto death love me even
[1:08:45] more
[1:08:46] the more pressure the more that they're
[1:08:48] trying to twist this word of god
[1:08:51] we just love him right to the very end
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:54] and be more faithful and love him even
[1:08:57] more than ever before
[1:08:59] amen we learn in no uncertain terms that
[1:09:02] this false vine is the vine of satan
[1:09:05] my brother and sister
[1:09:12] do you realize what the prophet is
[1:09:13] really saying there
[1:09:20] he is calling people
[1:09:25] sitting right in church the
[1:09:32] antichrist
[1:09:34] see how god puts it in the word so
[1:09:37] careful
[1:09:38] in such a fashion people will read that
[1:09:43] now you're going to think i've caught
[1:09:45] myself but
[1:09:47] that's not us that's someone else
[1:09:51] so every let me put it in this context
[1:09:54] every sanctuary
[1:09:56] every church that's looked at that right
[1:09:59] there's thought
[1:10:00] that's not us that's someone else
[1:10:05] but you see the word will come and prove
[1:10:10] whether you and i
[1:10:13] stand on one side or the other of this
[1:10:18] it gets blunt saints it comes right down
[1:10:21] to a
[1:10:22] narrow edge where we can't play
[1:10:25] games any longer it's not about we go to
[1:10:29] church because it's fun
[1:10:31] it should be fun i hope people are happy
[1:10:33] when they leave church
[1:10:36] but you see my brother and sister
[1:10:39] he closes this right here their
[1:10:41] gathering is of him satan
[1:10:45] see it's so clever but you know what i
[1:10:48] want to put this to you
[1:10:50] amen that it's
[1:10:53] not even the so close it would deceive
[1:10:56] the very elect that's not
[1:10:58] what that is
[1:11:03] i can make some statements that probably
[1:11:05] wouldn't be good
[1:11:06] but they're true and i can back them up
[1:11:09] a hundred percent
[1:11:11] my brother and sister hundred percent
[1:11:14] you know
[1:11:15] let me just inject this this you'll
[1:11:16] catch where i'm thinking
[1:11:18] the prophet of god said i want to come
[1:11:20] back to jeffersonville
[1:11:21] and preach the trail of the serpent
[1:11:25] you know why i think god didn't allow
[1:11:27] him to preach the trail of the serpent
[1:11:30] because that would have exposed the
[1:11:32] spirits
[1:11:33] that are just now being exposed
[1:11:37] and it was before its time it would have
[1:11:38] been out of season it would have just
[1:11:40] flattened a lot of things when it was
[1:11:42] pointed out
[1:11:43] where those spirits came from and god
[1:11:46] says nope you're not going to preach
[1:11:47] that
[1:11:48] i'm going to let it come to fruition
[1:11:51] that's right
[1:11:52] nobody has to preach it amen
[1:11:55] nobody has to preach it it will come to
[1:11:57] pass do you know i don't have to preach
[1:11:59] you brother trevor into the rapture
[1:12:01] i don't have to preach you brother jason
[1:12:03] brother william amen i have to preach
[1:12:05] you
[1:12:05] into the rapture amen the word of god
[1:12:08] will take you
[1:12:09] there amen because the word is in you
[1:12:12] the word will take you there
[1:12:13] so we don't have to befriend and lift up
[1:12:16] and cajole
[1:12:17] and all of these things to get people to
[1:12:19] serve god because it's in them
[1:12:23] hallelujah and you cannot turn that away
[1:12:26] because i was created or born into them
[1:12:29] of almighty god
[1:12:31] amen now he says now be faithful be thou
[1:12:34] faithful unto death love me even more
[1:12:36] now look don't you love how satan plays
[1:12:38] the love game
[1:12:41] amen or should i say it how the satan
[1:12:44] plays the
[1:12:45] god don't love you game now i know none
[1:12:48] of you ever suffer from that symptom
[1:12:51] but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:12:52] sister satan just knows right when to
[1:12:54] wait
[1:12:55] to come and whisper in your ear see if
[1:12:57] god loved you
[1:12:59] if god loved you this situation would
[1:13:01] have never
[1:13:02] ever happened yeah well you wouldn't got
[1:13:05] thrown the lions then if god had loved
[1:13:07] you you wouldn't have been thrown in the
[1:13:08] colosseum if god had loved you you
[1:13:09] wouldn't have been thrown off the cliff
[1:13:11] or dipped in the oil
[1:13:12] you wouldn't have been a lot of things
[1:13:13] if god loved you no my brother and
[1:13:15] sister satan is a good liar
[1:13:16] amen he's able to say these things in
[1:13:19] such a way
[1:13:20] and the worst thing my brother and
[1:13:21] sister that's way worse than the devil
[1:13:23] saying god don't love you is when you
[1:13:25] say
[1:13:25] god don't love you amen that's a way
[1:13:28] worse thing because
[1:13:30] we should be proven by now right amen
[1:13:32] we're not last week converts to the word
[1:13:34] of god
[1:13:35] we should know god loves us because if
[1:13:37] not we'd be in an alley somewhere or
[1:13:39] live in a rotten life amen
[1:13:41] okay now let me just go on here i i kind
[1:13:44] of question myself to preach this
[1:13:46] this way but i just couldn't help myself
[1:13:48] amen
[1:13:49] they meet in the name of god now
[1:13:51] remember saints we're
[1:13:53] preaching off of our our little graph
[1:13:55] here we're we're over on what i call the
[1:13:57] negative side so this is going to have a
[1:13:59] little
[1:14:00] bit of that but i'll give you something
[1:14:01] to clean your palate before we leave
[1:14:03] church today
[1:14:04] amen they meet in the name of god and
[1:14:06] lie that they are christ
[1:14:08] they preach they teach they baptize they
[1:14:11] worship
[1:14:12] they partake of various rights given by
[1:14:14] christ to the church
[1:14:16] yet they are not of god now i want to
[1:14:19] throw out i don't remember i believe
[1:14:20] that spurgeon
[1:14:21] says this you know that it's not fair
[1:14:24] that god would save some and
[1:14:26] not save others but if we got what was
[1:14:28] fair we'd all be in hell
[1:14:31] so we have to keep that in mind right
[1:14:33] this isn't about what's fair
[1:14:34] this about what god decided to do amen
[1:14:41] various rights christ came to church but
[1:14:43] they're not of god
[1:14:44] but since they say they are god will
[1:14:48] hold them responsible and in each age he
[1:14:50] speaks of them and to them
[1:14:52] they remind us exactly of balaam he had
[1:14:56] a prophetic office the prophetic
[1:14:58] office he knew the proper approach unto
[1:15:00] god as demonstrated in the sacrifice of
[1:15:02] the clean beast
[1:15:04] yet he was not a true word prophet for
[1:15:06] when god told him not to go honor balak
[1:15:09] with his presence he sought to go anyhow
[1:15:12] amen for he was motivated by his lust
[1:15:14] for gold and prestige
[1:15:16] so god let him go now you know as god
[1:15:20] under this you know aspect here we look
[1:15:23] at this does god ever change his mind
[1:15:25] no no god no so god let him go
[1:15:29] the perfect will of god gave way to the
[1:15:31] permissible will of god
[1:15:32] because of the heart desire of balaam
[1:15:36] god actually said go ahead
[1:15:39] now look at this i want to focus for
[1:15:41] just a minute my brother and sister
[1:15:42] of the things that we have to judge now
[1:15:45] we have to
[1:15:46] anything in life i i just uh i'll be
[1:15:49] open with you whatever you know in
[1:15:51] in my farming and business in life uh we
[1:15:53] make some decisions that have pretty
[1:15:55] hefty price tags attached to them
[1:15:57] i i tell you i actually sometimes i i
[1:16:01] don't sleep at night
[1:16:02] i i don't know whether i should or i
[1:16:05] shouldn't i don't know what to do
[1:16:07] and uh ultimately you come to a place
[1:16:10] that you you just have to do what you
[1:16:12] believe
[1:16:12] god wants you to do
[1:16:19] so it ultimately comes down to unless
[1:16:21] there's an absolute green light or a red
[1:16:23] light
[1:16:26] to your heart
[1:16:34] has anyone looked at the 2021
[1:16:37] gmc sierra duramax pickups
[1:16:45] did you know that if a man
[1:16:49] continually looked at them drove by
[1:16:52] said in drove it he
[1:16:56] got on his computer he pulled up
[1:16:58] wallpaper for his screen
[1:17:02] he got their calendar and hung it in his
[1:17:05] house
[1:17:06] had a picture on his phone wouldn't be
[1:17:09] very long he'd be driving it
[1:17:12] because that would dominate him and
[1:17:14] pretty soon his heart would convince him
[1:17:16] he had to have this
[1:17:19] you see if we
[1:17:23] in the flesh the scripture
[1:17:26] says lust after the flesh the
[1:17:29] fulfillment
[1:17:30] of the lust of the flesh will be the
[1:17:32] culmination
[1:17:33] of that lust
[1:17:39] so if our heart desires in the flesh
[1:17:44] it will ultimately manifest
[1:17:48] in the flesh
[1:17:52] and here was balaam known through the
[1:17:55] region as a prophet
[1:17:57] but you see had an opportunity to expand
[1:17:59] the borders
[1:18:02] of his garment his influence
[1:18:05] brother branham says that he knew all
[1:18:08] the right ways to approach
[1:18:09] god right he knew the proper approach
[1:18:11] unto god was demonstrating the sacrifice
[1:18:14] of the clean beast
[1:18:15] yet he was not a true word prophet for
[1:18:18] when
[1:18:19] god spoke his heart spoke louder
[1:18:25] and it's one thing for your heart to
[1:18:27] speak loud i tell you my heart speaks
[1:18:29] loud
[1:18:29] but oh i tell you it speaks really loud
[1:18:31] and really confident when god says
[1:18:33] that's right that's what you can do
[1:18:34] do this amen then you can stand up and
[1:18:37] say praise the lord i can
[1:18:38] i'm moving forward with confidence but
[1:18:41] you see when he got to this place god
[1:18:43] says no
[1:18:44] but his heart was greater he wanted this
[1:18:46] so bad
[1:18:47] that he just kept coming back oh lord i
[1:18:49] i want to go
[1:18:50] lord i need to go lord i want to be part
[1:18:52] of that lord i could do some good for
[1:18:54] you i could i could and god finally says
[1:18:56] go
[1:18:57] go go for he's motivated by his
[1:19:01] lust for golden prestige so god let him
[1:19:03] go the perfect will of god gave way to
[1:19:06] the permissible will of god
[1:19:07] because of the heart desire now saints
[1:19:10] let me circle this back around to this
[1:19:13] take your heart's desire what your heart
[1:19:15] is telling you you need to do want to do
[1:19:17] desire to do
[1:19:18] and then run it through the filter of
[1:19:21] the word
[1:19:22] and if what you want to do gets filtered
[1:19:24] out please i ask you in the name of the
[1:19:26] lord
[1:19:27] don't keep trying to run it back through
[1:19:29] the filter amen just
[1:19:31] accept it might not be god let's use the
[1:19:33] pickup that i chose for an example
[1:19:35] it might not be that god doesn't want
[1:19:37] you to to have a nice pickup
[1:19:39] but god's got one waiting for you god's
[1:19:42] got something in the season
[1:19:43] uh something's gonna come your way
[1:19:45] something's gonna change
[1:19:47] it's gonna sit on a lot and sit there
[1:19:49] forever and ever and ever and ever
[1:19:50] and one day it turns into a close-out
[1:19:52] and they knocked tens and
[1:19:54] thousands of dollars off of the price
[1:19:56] from what you would have paid for it
[1:19:58] and it's still there waiting for you
[1:20:00] i've seen these things happen
[1:20:02] i've seen god move in this fashion my
[1:20:04] brother and sister
[1:20:05] and you look at that and if we will
[1:20:06] submit our heart
[1:20:08] amen we can submit flash you know cut
[1:20:12] our hair
[1:20:12] dress correct brothers right speak right
[1:20:14] treat our wives right
[1:20:16] all of this saying sisters tame you know
[1:20:18] all this we
[1:20:19] we can submit our flesh but if we never
[1:20:21] submit our hearts that's right
[1:20:23] i'll tell you i i just a little bunt but
[1:20:26] i'm going to go ahead and say it
[1:20:27] hey man i had a sister one time just in
[1:20:30] so many words tell me she never gave her
[1:20:32] heart to her husband
[1:20:33] i'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:20:34] there's a family that's going to have
[1:20:36] nothing but pain and sorrow
[1:20:38] they're going to have nothing but
[1:20:39] troubles and rebellion in their
[1:20:41] household
[1:20:41] nothing but friction there's not going
[1:20:43] to be any kind of leadership in there
[1:20:45] it's going to be i'm going to do what
[1:20:46] i'm going to do and you do what you want
[1:20:48] to do kind of thing
[1:20:49] my brother and sister we've got to come
[1:20:51] to the place our hearts desire is to our
[1:20:53] husband
[1:20:54] and our husband is jesus christ amen and
[1:20:57] without that heart's desire to him we'll
[1:20:59] find ourselves led off into many many
[1:21:02] different trails
[1:21:03] and find ourselves in all kinds of
[1:21:05] trouble and travail
[1:21:06] hallelujah amen
[1:21:10] oh you know look at this as we go
[1:21:12] forward here
[1:21:14] he comes on he tells them now the
[1:21:16] perfect will gave way to permissible
[1:21:18] will
[1:21:19] because of the heart's desire god
[1:21:20] actually said go ahead
[1:21:23] now forgive me for sounding this way
[1:21:30] but when he went forth and said
[1:21:34] the lord told me to do this
[1:21:39] i don't know if you've ever been in a
[1:21:41] situation where someone says
[1:21:44] yeah the lord told me to do this
[1:21:50] saints i want you to be careful now i
[1:21:52] don't want you to turn into
[1:21:54] sherlock holmes to see if everybody's
[1:21:56] got you know the real word from the lord
[1:21:58] you know
[1:21:59] we're going to buy a car are you sure
[1:22:01] now let's just analyze
[1:22:02] no i'm sorry you don't do that but i
[1:22:04] also when it comes to spiritual things
[1:22:06] want you church
[1:22:07] to be careful about when people say well
[1:22:10] the lord told me to do this
[1:22:12] you have a right to inspect the word
[1:22:16] and especially it's going to influence
[1:22:18] you
[1:22:20] oh i'm not turning friend against friend
[1:22:22] and family against family
[1:22:24] but don't you just sit back and take
[1:22:26] somebody's word for it when they say
[1:22:28] god said it's going to line up
[1:22:31] and prove that god's head
[1:22:36] sometimes you know as a preacher i wish
[1:22:37] i could go into details because some of
[1:22:39] you guys i'd have to furnish fire
[1:22:41] extinguishers for you you'd just be like
[1:22:44] what
[1:22:48] but have somebody come to you
[1:22:51] and say the lord told me
[1:22:55] to do this
[1:22:58] i learned from a couple brothers that
[1:23:00] are pastors
[1:23:02] they've helped me with my impetuous
[1:23:04] responses
[1:23:07] just to say the lord told you
[1:23:10] okay just want to clarify that
[1:23:14] you see there's no need to argue with
[1:23:15] them they've made their mind up
[1:23:17] you don't know how many times they went
[1:23:19] back to god and said lord i want to do
[1:23:21] this i want to do this i want to do this
[1:23:23] until they
[1:23:24] got to do this but you see
[1:23:27] when you're standing there and someone
[1:23:28] says the lord told me to do this
[1:23:31] and you can think of a half a dozen
[1:23:32] scriptures that that counter dicks
[1:23:35] right there god didn't tell them to do
[1:23:38] that
[1:23:39] i'm sorry that's why reason preachers
[1:23:40] sometimes get cynical saints
[1:23:43] it's because they hear people not just
[1:23:45] people but you know preachers and
[1:23:46] whatever else saying well god told us to
[1:23:48] do this wait it's against the word
[1:23:50] god told me to do it after a while
[1:23:52] you're like well i guess you can do
[1:23:54] anything
[1:23:55] you can do anything you please but i
[1:23:58] want to encourage you saints
[1:24:01] put your heart's desire through the
[1:24:04] filter of the word
[1:24:06] and if it won't go through it then just
[1:24:09] stop right there
[1:24:10] don't force it through it don't force it
[1:24:13] through it don't stand on it you
[1:24:15] remember a colander
[1:24:16] you know don't stand on top of the
[1:24:18] colander and pound on that until
[1:24:20] it goes through it amen praise the lord
[1:24:24] hallelujah well there's just a lot here
[1:24:26] and if we don't make it very far here
[1:24:28] we'll be fine saints
[1:24:31] mean less studying for next week
[1:24:34] [Laughter]
[1:24:37] okay did god change his mind
[1:24:41] no sir god had his way regardless of
[1:24:44] balaam going
[1:24:44] balaam did not annul the will of god
[1:24:48] god had his way regardless it was balaam
[1:24:50] who was a loser
[1:24:52] for he bypassed the word
[1:24:55] you see ultimately we can cut down all
[1:24:57] kinds of detail saints
[1:24:59] when we're looking at this negative side
[1:25:01] of this you can bypass
[1:25:03] all kinds of details and all kinds of
[1:25:06] back story
[1:25:07] if you just look and see whether or not
[1:25:09] they're
[1:25:10] bypassing the word anything that's
[1:25:13] bypassing the word
[1:25:15] you bypass it you know because it's just
[1:25:19] it's headed to trouble of some kind amen
[1:25:22] you know some something's got to give
[1:25:23] way sooner or later amen it was balaam
[1:25:27] who's the
[1:25:27] loser for he bypassed the word and today
[1:25:29] we have that very same thing
[1:25:31] women preachers organizations false
[1:25:33] doctrines etc people
[1:25:34] worshiping god manifesting in the spirit
[1:25:36] and going right on as did balaam
[1:25:38] claiming that god spoke to them even
[1:25:40] when the commission
[1:25:42] received is opposite to the revealed
[1:25:44] word
[1:25:46] amen and i will not deny that god spoke
[1:25:50] to them
[1:25:51] see this is where it gets complicated
[1:25:53] church
[1:25:54] that's where it gets really complicated
[1:25:57] because there's no
[1:25:58] denying
[1:26:01] but i'm sorry whether god said yes or
[1:26:03] not
[1:26:04] what was the original word
[1:26:08] anything contrary to that in original
[1:26:10] word we've got to just say no
[1:26:12] no no sorry i can't accept it
[1:26:15] but this minister was with the prophet
[1:26:19] the prophet told them this and they
[1:26:22] wrote it down
[1:26:23] and that's why we do what we do
[1:26:27] my brother and sister i'm sorry i will
[1:26:29] not call anyone a liar
[1:26:31] i simply refuse to call anyone a liar
[1:26:34] but that
[1:26:36] doesn't fit this therefore
[1:26:39] it's valueless let's
[1:26:42] be real didn't the prophet of god say i
[1:26:44] come here to point you back to the word
[1:26:46] of god
[1:26:47] amen so we can't you know got the quote
[1:26:49] where brother branham says the holy
[1:26:51] ghost
[1:26:52] will never take you away from the word
[1:26:56] he always brings you into the word
[1:27:00] right so he's not going to take us away
[1:27:02] so recognize these spirits
[1:27:04] that's why the prophet of god brought it
[1:27:06] down for you and i
[1:27:07] my revelation can give everything in
[1:27:10] life
[1:27:11] a word test not for me to run out you
[1:27:13] know to a young man or
[1:27:15] somebody and say now do you this and
[1:27:16] this can you tell me where brother brown
[1:27:18] said this and if you can't quote what
[1:27:19] quote and when it was
[1:27:20] you're not a message believer i'm sorry
[1:27:22] some of us can't hardly remember our
[1:27:24] phone number
[1:27:25] i'm glad that my phone number's on the
[1:27:26] very top of the list in my phone
[1:27:28] amen so you look at that you guys don't
[1:27:31] have your own phone number in your phone
[1:27:35] okay thank you i feel better already
[1:27:39] so you look at this see claiming that
[1:27:42] it's spoken and brother brown says and i
[1:27:44] i don't even deny that god
[1:27:46] spoke to them but it was just like when
[1:27:47] he spoke to baylor that second time
[1:27:49] as he knew what balaam wanted his own
[1:27:51] hearts desire
[1:27:53] above the word
[1:27:57] wouldn't it be much simpler if god just
[1:27:58] give us a little litmus test
[1:28:01] like as in i open the bottle
[1:28:04] lick the strip
[1:28:09] but what it would do it would just
[1:28:10] circumvent the word right
[1:28:12] because the word says it's got to all
[1:28:14] stay into the harvest
[1:28:16] you imagine i've done this saints i hope
[1:28:19] you don't mind me just
[1:28:20] this liberty i've done this try to get
[1:28:22] the weed out of the field before
[1:28:24] before the harvest you know what you end
[1:28:26] up having to do you end up having to put
[1:28:28] your boots around the base of the weed
[1:28:32] and pulling to try and pull the weed out
[1:28:36] without ripping out
[1:28:37] the wheat and did you know it's
[1:28:41] virtually impossible
[1:28:44] because that weed's roots
[1:28:49] have went out and i'm just saying this
[1:28:52] figuratively okay nobody get upset and
[1:28:54] they went to your house
[1:28:56] and they went to your house went to your
[1:28:58] house your house right
[1:29:00] they went out they're feeding on the
[1:29:01] same
[1:29:03] and you just can't rip it out without
[1:29:05] affecting everything around it
[1:29:13] he wanted his own heart's desire by the
[1:29:15] word and he gave it to him
[1:29:17] now tell me my god's not good that's
[1:29:19] right
[1:29:20] my god so good you want it more than the
[1:29:21] word i'll even just go ahead and give
[1:29:23] you what you want more than the word
[1:29:26] yeah scary but yet all the while in the
[1:29:29] end having his own
[1:29:30] way even so today god tells folks to go
[1:29:33] ahead in their own hearts desire for
[1:29:35] they have
[1:29:36] already rejected the word
[1:29:40] my brother and sister this might come
[1:29:42] across a little strong forgive me
[1:29:44] but when people come trying to reinvent
[1:29:48] this message to you i want you to
[1:29:52] read the resume of the ages again we
[1:29:55] don't need the message reinvented to us
[1:29:58] we need god to fully reveal it to our
[1:30:01] heart
[1:30:02] amen not our mind
[1:30:07] you know i got on one of those things
[1:30:09] you know it was in a foyer of a building
[1:30:10] one time put my 50 cents in there
[1:30:13] you stand on the deal you put two
[1:30:15] fingers on the thing and you speak
[1:30:17] answers into a speaker
[1:30:18] and it tells you what your iq is and i
[1:30:20] did that and it said my iq
[1:30:22] is like 147. and i thought well that's
[1:30:25] not bad
[1:30:26] i got off i put another 50 cents in
[1:30:28] there climbed back on and did it again
[1:30:30] and it said i had iq of like 83.
[1:30:34] so if we take
[1:30:37] too much outside input
[1:30:42] i walk away there being very smart
[1:30:46] or walk away from their dumb as dirt
[1:30:49] all because what something else said or
[1:30:52] someone else said or someone else's
[1:30:54] preaching
[1:30:54] said that's why it's got to be a
[1:30:56] personal revelation
[1:30:58] that i got in the word and the word was
[1:31:00] in christ and i said lord whatever
[1:31:03] you want i want isn't that just as easy
[1:31:06] as saying lord give me what i want
[1:31:08] is to say lord give me what you want
[1:31:11] amen
[1:31:11] and to step into that and when god comes
[1:31:14] back and says you're my son you're my
[1:31:16] daughter
[1:31:16] just keep on believing keep on pressing
[1:31:18] amen
[1:31:20] hold on to the end and then we've got
[1:31:22] something to stand on
[1:31:23] because he's not going to come back and
[1:31:24] tell you you put your next 50 cents you
[1:31:26] know i think i'll put it more like this
[1:31:29] you put somebody else's two cents in
[1:31:31] there it's not going to come back and
[1:31:32] say you're a loser
[1:31:34] it's going to come back and tell your
[1:31:35] son or daughter of god every single
[1:31:38] time hallelujah
[1:31:42] amen can i have just a few short more
[1:31:44] minutes
[1:31:49] you see when we look at this i want to
[1:31:51] just reiterate here
[1:31:53] remember brother brown says balaam held
[1:31:57] a prophetic office so it's not
[1:32:00] even that the prophetic is taking place
[1:32:03] around you
[1:32:04] because things can be prophesied and
[1:32:06] come to pass
[1:32:07] and not lead us to christ hallelujah
[1:32:12] yes yes
[1:32:16] my oh my but the will of god
[1:32:20] will be done regardless see this doesn't
[1:32:23] depress me this doesn't you know make me
[1:32:26] feel bummed out you know we're talking
[1:32:27] about balaam and all these
[1:32:29] bad things but the will of god will be
[1:32:32] done
[1:32:32] regardless that means amen that when
[1:32:36] one turns their heart sorry brother
[1:32:39] christian to to go this way
[1:32:41] for just a moment but when one starts to
[1:32:43] turn their heart
[1:32:44] and says you know i'm i might go ahead
[1:32:46] and see about jesus christ
[1:32:48] amen you see what we're looking at is
[1:32:50] not our ideas or
[1:32:52] any other man's ideas or the
[1:32:53] disappointments of life
[1:32:55] we're looking at god's will being done
[1:32:58] regardless regardless of the
[1:33:02] environment one is raised in the kind of
[1:33:05] friends one was raised when
[1:33:06] whatever all this stuff regardless of
[1:33:08] that there was a church next door and
[1:33:10] that's how i come to the lord that's
[1:33:12] beautiful
[1:33:12] but some amen i remember down chaloy
[1:33:14] island young lady down there gives her
[1:33:17] heart to the lord
[1:33:18] she lived in the middle of nowhere but
[1:33:20] she come to get a dress made for a
[1:33:22] wedding i think it was wasn't it
[1:33:24] and the dressmaker was a believer so
[1:33:27] this little girl travels this
[1:33:28] just incredible distance to get a dress
[1:33:31] made
[1:33:32] and the dressmaker is a believer and the
[1:33:35] sister admitted right in front of the
[1:33:36] young lady after she gave her heart to
[1:33:38] the lord
[1:33:38] she said i i never sewed a dress so slow
[1:33:41] in my life
[1:33:47] and she's just talking to this young
[1:33:48] lady the young lady expressed this story
[1:33:51] how my life feels empty
[1:33:54] i just you know i don't i don't know it
[1:33:56] just doesn't seem like there's much
[1:33:59] she starts talking to her you see my
[1:34:02] brother and sister it don't matter you
[1:34:03] can
[1:34:04] live in a rural route nowhere that's
[1:34:06] right
[1:34:07] god will come because his will will be
[1:34:09] done regardless
[1:34:10] i hope you see this it will not only
[1:34:13] clear up much of what is seen in all the
[1:34:14] ages but it will especially help in this
[1:34:16] last age
[1:34:17] which has so much manifestation and
[1:34:20] external
[1:34:21] blessing when the whole period is so
[1:34:24] against the word revealed will of god
[1:34:27] if an age ever received a message loud
[1:34:29] and clear
[1:34:30] this age did it was and is that
[1:34:33] old testament truth the son of the bond
[1:34:36] woman will distress the son of the free
[1:34:38] woman
[1:34:38] until the son of the bondwoman be cast
[1:34:41] out we're seeing it happen
[1:34:42] saints it's coming to pass right before
[1:34:46] our eyes that lets us know that the
[1:34:49] hatred
[1:34:50] and the blasphemy of satan against the
[1:34:52] true christian will be vented
[1:34:54] through a group who is who are nominal
[1:34:57] false
[1:34:57] christians and this will increase until
[1:35:00] god uproots that false vine at the end
[1:35:02] of the laodicean age
[1:35:05] feel any pressure
[1:35:10] i don't know about you guys but some
[1:35:12] days my days are so pressurized i feel
[1:35:14] like my head's going to blow off
[1:35:17] poor sister jerry pray for her
[1:35:22] figuratively i gnaw on her right and
[1:35:24] left i come home
[1:35:26] i'm so uptight she bears the brunt
[1:35:31] why maybe it's a phone call
[1:35:34] maybe it's a little something here maybe
[1:35:36] it's something that you know about
[1:35:38] and you just are in travail over these
[1:35:41] things
[1:35:43] some of it's just the cares of life but
[1:35:45] we're living in a
[1:35:46] pressurized age amen and we don't have
[1:35:50] to blow up under this pressure because
[1:35:52] we've got a place to let it off
[1:35:54] and that beautiful got a lovely place to
[1:35:56] let off the pressure
[1:35:58] hallelujah and so it's going to increase
[1:36:00] let me just let me just
[1:36:01] you know knock the smile off your face
[1:36:06] trials ain't going away the troubles
[1:36:08] ain't going away the struggle ain't
[1:36:09] going
[1:36:10] away but your faith
[1:36:13] is increasing hallelujah
[1:36:17] and you say well i i do we have
[1:36:19] rapturing faith i'm here to tell you
[1:36:20] this morning
[1:36:21] i have rapturing faith amen i'm gonna
[1:36:25] take the
[1:36:26] position the apostle paul had and i'm
[1:36:28] here to tell you rapturing faith
[1:36:30] is boiling out of the bride of jesus
[1:36:32] christ but
[1:36:33] she's not living to her potential to put
[1:36:36] it to work yet
[1:36:38] so god's bringing rapturing faith and
[1:36:41] us right together and when that day
[1:36:44] is necessary you imagine if god just
[1:36:46] said okay here's all the faith right
[1:36:48] here and
[1:36:49] right before your eyes to take a rapture
[1:36:51] right now most of you would be ripping
[1:36:53] the wrappings off of that thing and god
[1:36:54] be saying wait
[1:36:55] whoa stop no i'm out of here
[1:36:58] we wouldn't be hanging out here but you
[1:37:01] see it's got to come to the season
[1:37:03] when the terror has to be tore up we're
[1:37:06] getting close
[1:37:08] we're getting close amen god's fixing to
[1:37:11] uproot them
[1:37:12] you know there's some really cool really
[1:37:14] cool quotes you know
[1:37:16] talking about the times and the seasons
[1:37:19] and
[1:37:19] and uh disrupting of those things uh
[1:37:23] brother branham uses the word uh
[1:37:26] oh
[1:37:29] not just pandemic it had had something
[1:37:32] on the back of it
[1:37:34] oh i don't remember brother barry coffey
[1:37:36] just shared that quote
[1:37:38] uh i thought wow that is incredible
[1:37:42] because he's talking uses the root word
[1:37:44] pandemic but it's some
[1:37:46] you know addition to it coming right
[1:37:48] into those times yep that's the times
[1:37:49] we're coming in
[1:37:50] right into those times of the pandemic
[1:37:52] yeah right into the time when everything
[1:37:54] seems to be chaos
[1:37:56] amen i'm sorry i can't i thought i could
[1:37:58] remember those words but
[1:38:00] the third age revealed by the spirit of
[1:38:01] prophecy that the worldly church
[1:38:03] would adopt nicolaitis as a doctrine a
[1:38:06] separation of the clergy from the laity
[1:38:08] grew from the biblical truth of the
[1:38:10] elder
[1:38:10] shepherds of local flocks ruling the
[1:38:13] flock by the word
[1:38:17] that's so old-fashioned
[1:38:22] really leading the church
[1:38:26] by the bible i mean
[1:38:29] that has to be like a first century
[1:38:31] thing
[1:38:35] the genesis thing yeah
[1:38:39] rooting the flock by the word to the
[1:38:41] deeds of the nicolaitan see here's some
[1:38:43] more of these deeds that they're going
[1:38:44] to be judged by
[1:38:45] because one of the deeds my brother and
[1:38:47] sister now i tell you this actually
[1:38:49] makes me kind of a little nervous
[1:38:51] because one of the deeds i would be
[1:38:52] judged by is the deed of how i led this
[1:38:56] church
[1:38:58] i said i'm a message pastor i said i'm a
[1:39:00] believer
[1:39:02] i get judged by those words i'll get
[1:39:04] judged by the deed
[1:39:05] of how i lead the church my you know
[1:39:08] what
[1:39:09] i think i'm going to do this right not
[1:39:10] so much for your sake
[1:39:12] as for my own but wait if i can make a
[1:39:15] rapture
[1:39:16] you can make rapture and worry feeding
[1:39:18] on the same thing
[1:39:19] i'm safe amen i'm going to be all right
[1:39:24] wherein the clergy set themselves in
[1:39:26] ranks one over the other
[1:39:28] which unscriptural formula then evolved
[1:39:30] into a priesthood
[1:39:32] that placed the courage of clergy
[1:39:33] between man and god
[1:39:35] given the clergy certain rights all the
[1:39:37] while denying the laity their god-given
[1:39:39] rights
[1:39:40] that was a serpent or however you say
[1:39:43] that
[1:39:44] in this age it become a doctrine it was
[1:39:47] established in the church as the assured
[1:39:49] word of god which indeed it was
[1:39:51] not look i i'm just
[1:39:54] i feel like tearing a little rubber on
[1:39:55] the road
[1:39:58] in the last year year and a half
[1:40:02] in several situations i've had people
[1:40:05] tell me
[1:40:07] brother branham said
[1:40:10] this
[1:40:16] i have searched the message
[1:40:20] up down around
[1:40:23] sideways at an angle
[1:40:28] from far away from close
[1:40:31] and found either the complete opposite
[1:40:36] or not at all that's right
[1:40:40] and men by email text
[1:40:45] whatever tell you this is what the
[1:40:47] prophet said
[1:40:50] really i'm sure glad they made more than
[1:40:54] one
[1:40:55] ego computing program
[1:41:00] you see we're not exempt from this
[1:41:01] spirit
[1:41:03] of saying no no now this
[1:41:07] is the word
[1:41:10] no i'm sorry i've got the word i've got
[1:41:12] the word the prophet came to me too
[1:41:15] prophet came to you too we've got the
[1:41:17] word
[1:41:18] amen that's why we have to have a
[1:41:21] personal time of digging into the word
[1:41:23] of god
[1:41:23] don't trust brother paul trust me please
[1:41:28] but don't trust me that's right what do
[1:41:30] they say that um
[1:41:32] trust but verify that's that's what i
[1:41:34] mean
[1:41:35] trust but verify don't hang your soul
[1:41:39] as it would be over hell on some man's
[1:41:41] words of his interpretation of the
[1:41:43] message
[1:41:44] amen it was established in the church as
[1:41:47] the assured word of god now some of
[1:41:49] these things that people have sent me by
[1:41:50] brother and sister
[1:41:51] and said well brother brown said this
[1:41:53] and this and you can't find it or he
[1:41:55] says exactly the opposite
[1:41:56] what if we held that as the assured word
[1:42:00] we would be believing something that's
[1:42:01] not even in the word of god
[1:42:03] not even in the message of the hour see
[1:42:06] this is how close
[1:42:07] these spirits are coming they're coming
[1:42:10] in and they are bold enough to declare
[1:42:14] this is the message it might be your
[1:42:17] message
[1:42:19] but it's not our message because our
[1:42:21] message lines up with the word of god
[1:42:24] but the clergy called it the word of god
[1:42:26] and therefore doctrine
[1:42:28] was antichrist now that's pretty harsh
[1:42:31] isn't it brother paul can be pretty
[1:42:32] harsh because he actually believes this
[1:42:36] when people come and start pitching
[1:42:38] stuff in the middle
[1:42:40] of my carcass are you with me they're
[1:42:42] pitching stuff in the middle of my
[1:42:44] carcass that i'm
[1:42:46] feeding on and saying this is the
[1:42:49] message
[1:42:50] and then when brother paul says no it
[1:42:52] ain't they get very harsh on me
[1:42:55] but i don't think i'm quite as harsh as
[1:42:57] brother branham is right there because
[1:42:58] he says they're doctrines antichrist
[1:43:08] you know i'm just going to kind of skip
[1:43:10] forward saints there is just
[1:43:13] there's that and then there's that
[1:43:16] and then there's that we'll stop right
[1:43:19] here sister amy would you come
[1:43:21] musicians please don't read
[1:43:28] just a little bit look i'm telling you
[1:43:31] saints
[1:43:32] preaching about the negative side of
[1:43:34] things is necessary i believe
[1:43:37] right we need to mark where we stand so
[1:43:39] that someone doesn't keep moving the
[1:43:41] boundaries
[1:43:42] that's why surveyors amen they have a
[1:43:45] job a never-ending job is to complete
[1:43:48] or continue to mark the boundaries
[1:43:52] but preaching about that ain't no fun so
[1:43:56] i wanted to close the service out today
[1:43:58] on this quote right here because
[1:44:00] this is what i really get excited about
[1:44:02] this is what i really like
[1:44:05] you say well if i get baptized
[1:44:08] the holy ghost then well maybe the lord
[1:44:11] will take me
[1:44:12] meaning like i get baptized i'd be ready
[1:44:14] to go to heaven is god going to kill me
[1:44:18] no not only that you're just getting
[1:44:20] ready to live
[1:44:23] oh think about this saints amen you get
[1:44:26] you get baptized get the holy ghost then
[1:44:29] well maybe the lord will take me no not
[1:44:31] on that you're just getting ready to
[1:44:32] live
[1:44:33] you ain't ready to live till you got the
[1:44:35] holy you get the holy ghost
[1:44:37] and then when you get the holy ghost
[1:44:40] then you're
[1:44:41] just fit to live he wasn't fit to live
[1:44:44] before that but now you're just fit to
[1:44:47] live after
[1:44:48] you've got the holy ghost see just
[1:44:50] getting you ready see
[1:44:52] people say well i i gotta get ready to
[1:44:54] die
[1:44:55] oh my i'm getting ready to live
[1:44:58] hallelujah not getting ready to die i'm
[1:45:01] getting
[1:45:02] ready to live amen there's nothing more
[1:45:05] so in me i
[1:45:06] i figured out saints uh i may be a
[1:45:08] little transparent here
[1:45:09] but i figured out one of the things
[1:45:11] about little paul here
[1:45:13] as a boy little paul never wanted to go
[1:45:15] to bed at night
[1:45:19] got a lot of psychological things of why
[1:45:21] kids don't want to go to bed at night
[1:45:24] maybe they believe there's monsters
[1:45:26] under their bed
[1:45:28] maybe they don't like their room because
[1:45:30] the tree branch scratches
[1:45:32] on the eve
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:36] or maybe they're afraid to die
[1:45:41] as long as i'm awake
[1:45:44] i'm all right as a little kid i
[1:45:47] struggled with that
[1:45:49] i don't know why either grandma grandpa
[1:45:53] a few people passed away but that's
[1:45:54] normal
[1:45:55] you know what i mean nothing different
[1:45:57] than you experienced
[1:45:58] i just never wanted to go to bed sister
[1:46:01] jerry still lives with the after effect
[1:46:03] of that it's become a habit
[1:46:06] when i pass out in the chair it's
[1:46:07] bedtime till then i've got
[1:46:10] something to do but look at this
[1:46:14] people say well i've got to get ready to
[1:46:16] die
[1:46:18] oh my i'm just getting ready to live
[1:46:23] amen the thing it is get ready to live
[1:46:25] live in christ
[1:46:27] this getting right down here is what i
[1:46:28] loved on this victorious
[1:46:30] life over sin over death right because
[1:46:34] i'm going to read this
[1:46:35] as the english language it would
[1:46:37] actually place it a victorious life over
[1:46:40] sin victorious life over death
[1:46:42] victorious life over hell
[1:46:46] right amen i already have the victory
[1:46:50] he's my victory and i'm
[1:46:54] his evidence hallelujah
[1:46:57] you want to know if christ has got the
[1:46:59] victory look around there'll be evidence
[1:47:02] you know for years i've made that
[1:47:03] statement that i believe
[1:47:05] that the vindication of brother
[1:47:07] branham's ministry did not take place it
[1:47:09] did in a sense saying
[1:47:11] i'm not trying to backtrack against that
[1:47:12] but i believe the vindication of brother
[1:47:15] branham's ministry
[1:47:16] is sitting in this church this morning
[1:47:19] hallelujah because the word he preached
[1:47:22] is producing
[1:47:23] a bride that is living the very word he
[1:47:26] preached
[1:47:26] amen so if it produced nothing then his
[1:47:29] ministry
[1:47:29] in essence would have been nothing but
[1:47:31] he preached the word and the
[1:47:33] supernatural come
[1:47:34] and in laodicea where the demons are
[1:47:36] hanging off the rafters
[1:47:38] they're still a bride that's an
[1:47:39] overcomer she's the one that's there and
[1:47:42] she recognizes
[1:47:43] i've got victory because he's my victory
[1:47:46] he already had the victory
[1:47:47] so i've got victory and wait if there's
[1:47:50] victory
[1:47:51] and i'm part of this then i'm the
