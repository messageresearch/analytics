TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and hear the message. I don't mean you personally, I mean anyone else, but but um and maybe you did. I don't know. But um let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer. Glad to be here. Amen. Lord Jesus, we just release ourselves now to you, these few here. Lord, we just ask your blessing upon your word. Lord, as we've said before, for us to live as Christ, we haven't come here to meet anyone but you. And we will meet you, Lord. That's our expectation. We're expecting you to speak through mortal clay, the vocal cords of a man. I can't do that, Lord. I'm asking you to speak what David knows nothing about. But Lord, the revelation of this hour, the word for the season, I'm asking you to minister that word to our hearts tonight. As we're assembled here, gathered in your name, we know that you are here. That's all that matters. You are here. May our thoughts now lay be laid aside of today, the thoughts of tomorrow. And may you open our hearts to receive your engrafted word. your embodied word in your body, your bride. We pray for thy name and by thy name and for your glory and honor that we leave here raised to a higher plane in you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray and we give you praise because we believe that we receive what we ask for. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we believe we receive what we ask for, it'll be manifested. Amen. I'd like you to turn me to the book of Solomon, Song of Solomon. I'm going to this is my title tonight is the voice of our beloved or voice of my beloved mine meaning yours too personal the voice of my beloved and I wanted this is a part two I'm not going to try to say what we said Sunday if like I said I can't go back and preach that sermon again and then add to it so I just want to finish up what what has been written here I mean what has been spoken already and the Lord dropped back to this. So in verse chapter 2 of the Song of Solomon and we'll starting with verse 10, my beloved spake. We can take verse eight. The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh, leaping upon the mountain, skipping upon the hills. Verse 10, my beloved spake. Now we're talking about the voice. Now the Now the beloved is speaking his thought in a word. my beloved spake and said unto me, "Rise up." Who did he speak to? Is there any me here? &gt;&gt; He's speaking to you tonight. &gt;&gt; He's speaking to me tonight. Even though I I'm you I'm letting I'm I'm giving myself to him to use this vessel. He still speaks to me. &gt;&gt; I could say something right now. How I was caught up in that in my office way back many years ago. I'd read the message. First thing I' I was an insurance agent and I would read I would be in there to take the morning and reading the word and I was having a time of my life and I would read one one one part of it and and uh I mean the message book and and I would just oh my the revelation just strike me and I'd get up and I would preach to myself and I had a man come running in I had big windows you know farmers insurance group you know and come in he says he said are you okay is everything all right I said yes I'm having the time of my life. He said, "Well, well," he says, "Amen." He was my insured. So, yes, we can. God speaks right out of the fountain and the the artisian comes out, Brother David, and comes right back in again. That Amen. That's right. So, we just drink. It just keeps pressing out, doesn't it? Amen. So anyway, verse 10 again, my beloved spake and said unto me, rise up. He's speaking to you tonight. Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, and I want you to notice now we're going to read. For lo, the winter is passed. Now watch how he's speaking here. Lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. There's a time period has passed by. &gt;&gt; That's right. We've been through seven ages and we come to the end of the seventh age and the and there's a message that turned the corner out of that into the things that were secret and held in the word, sealed in the word. Amen. So he said the the winter has passed, the rain is over and gone. The flowers appear. See another season. There's a turning of the corner here. The flowers appear on the earth. The time of the singing of birds has come. And the voice of the turtle, that's a turtle dove. The voice of the dove is heard in our land. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. The fig tree puteth forth her green figs. The vines with tender grapes give a good smell. Other words, the gra the vines got grapes. The birds are singing. They're building their nests. The spring has come. It's resurrection. But he but he's speaking. What is he speaking? The voice of the resurrection. Amen. He He speaks this. Rise up, my love. Rise. Isaiah 60. Rise. Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. This message isn't some idea of a thought of a man. This is eternal life. This is the voice of your beloved. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just a some some idea some man presented to us. It's not a man's thought. The word of the Lord comes to his prophets. I the Lord will do nothing until I reveal my secrets to my servants, the prophets. So the prophet had the interpretation of the word for their day and hour. Amen. Is that right? It wasn't the prophet's mind. It was God speaking through that prophet. And if he speaks through that prophet, those that didn't hear the prophets in the past were not were lost. Amen. Is that right? Moses said, "God will raise up a prophet like unto me." And he that won't hear that prophet is rejected. So, it's nothing to take it lightly when the voice of God is spoken in our day for the going home of the bride. I don't know who she is, but it's our going home message. We're at the end. We've arrived. &gt;&gt; We see it in the earth. We see it in politics. We see it in Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everywhere we turn, we see it. We see American pope now governing the government, moving the government, moving President Trump. He doesn't know what's influencing him. Amen. But he but it's happening. We're seeing it happen. &gt;&gt; And our time of departure is any day, any moment. Amen. All right. So the let's say it again now. So we our grapes are on the vine. The fig tree put forth her green figs. Other words, Israel's in her homeland. And she begins to bear fruit. The vines are on the tender grape. Gives a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. Why? Thy light is come. It's an awakening. Amen. The message of the hour is the awakening of the bride because in her is a mystery to be unveiled. Amen. You may be seated. I want you to turn with me to Revelations chapter 10. Now, we're going to speak. This is the voice of our beloved. This is the message. Revelations 10 is the message of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; It is the message. We ought to listen to it then. Don't you think? &gt;&gt; His message was opened word. His message was our beloved speaking to us to rise. The time has come. I The mystery is being unveiled. And you Okay, I won't go that far because I'm going ahead of myself. Let's just back up here. All right. Now, so Revelations 10 and verse 7, I'll get to it here. Okay. Now, we know that verse I'm just going to read verse 10, but I or seven, but I took a lot of this all the way down to verse four. We know that this message comes when there's time no longer time no longer delayed. This is the end. And the message that se the seal being opened is a is a sign that we've arrived at the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. How much longer this time? But there's not going to be another message. There not going to be another time. The bride is going home. She's got the message to be changed. &gt;&gt; Rapture has been preached to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that? Rapture has been preached to her. Amen. So what is the revelation of the rapture to you personally? is the substance of that body change. Brother Bam said the bride will be looking for the revelation of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So So we see here then and it comes in the end of the time. It comes in the end and and John the voice was uttered. The seven thunders uttered their voices. Seven mysteries uttered one mystery. Amen. Those are words of the prophet. I'll read in a minute. But seven mysteries uttered one mystery. Amen. So, so we see right here, John was about to write. He heard it at being a type of a bride, but he was commanded to seal up what he what he heard. Seal it up. &gt;&gt; But showing that the bride will receive it. It's coming down now in verse 107. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, this mystery, this mystery, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God. So what mystery is it? It's the mystery of God. The mystery of God should be finished. &gt;&gt; Completed. Finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. It should be completed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. To whom? Who the message is going to? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. It should be completed as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. So the message sounded and he sounded the revelation. &gt;&gt; All can hear that sounding. &gt;&gt; I'm going to come to that in a minute. But not everybody can receive or hear the sounding. Now that sounds like a contradiction, doesn't it? They hear it, but they don't hear it. You can hear it and still not receive the logos underneath what you hear, &gt;&gt; which is the word. We've covered that Sunday. I can't go back and cover that again. All right? Because and you know, and I can tell you right here what the logos is. Let me just read it to you real quick. We read it Sunday. But here's here's the definition, the prophet's definition of logos. He said he said the word logos which means the thought or concept has the double meaning of thought and speech. So what is the what is the what is the word the translation of the word in the beginning verse John 1:1 in the beginning was the logos &gt;&gt; God spoke his words the original seed was the word the thought spoken into word God's thought spoken is that right he created by his word &gt;&gt; amen because it was his thoughts expressed now where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy and and where were you you were we covered all that in the church age we you were in God's thought to begin with. &gt;&gt; See, you don't realize that you were in the thought of God. The thought of God being revealed in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, what is opened up under that is the mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's only a certain people that can hear the voice &gt;&gt; under the voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Other words, there's only a certain people could they can read it. We all must read it. We all hear it. Yes. &gt;&gt; But there's only a certain ones that can receive it, understand it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to show you scripturally where that is in just a moment. &gt;&gt; All right. So, the logos double meaning of thought and speech. Now, a thought expressed is a word or words. So, he expressed his thought in a word. The word was in the beginning was the word and the word was with God. How was it with God? Okay. So the word was with God and the word was God and the same was with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. So now that gives you I can't like I say I can't go on that because we covered that pretty thoroughly on Sunday. And so this thought of God, the concept of God was expressed in Jesus. He was the concept of God expressed. Where was it expressed? The Godhead bodily was expressed in one man. Amen. &gt;&gt; That man was virgin born. He didn't come by sex. He came by a spoken word. &gt;&gt; So his blood was pure and and the blood is sent for you and I to loose us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when it looses us and your faith rests in that finished work, then what is it? The loosing is complete and perfect. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's still some part of redemption still to happen. And that's when he comes forth as he and we'll find out in this day and claims what he had paid the price for. Amen. There you are. So, you're in that thought. You're in this word. &gt;&gt; You're written here, but it's a hidden mystery. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, if you if you're listening, you caught something right there. All right. So, we go back here and and to where we were here. And my subtitle to this tonight is this. Christ in you, the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ in you is the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Revealed, &gt;&gt; unveiled. &gt;&gt; And that's the secret. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the secret. What' the prophet say? The secret was the word, the logos, the word, the thought revealed is in the bride. &gt;&gt; She was to be the word living and in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. living and in action. Not just faith without works. Works and faith are husband and wife. They're together. She was the word living and in action. &gt;&gt; She's the word living and operative. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That for all the words back, brother David, for me to live is Christ and die is gain. So our ministry, our ministry that we hold is this revelation, this mystery unveiled. That's the bride's ministry. Will she have a ministry? a great ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? She'll have a ministry. She see the voice this this revelation is now in the bride. Not another voice. The same voice. The spirit and the bride say come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what the prophet said, the spirit said, the prophet said, what the spirit through the prophet said is what we say. &gt;&gt; We can't be someone different. We are him. And his glory he shared with us. He wouldn't share it with another, but he shared it with us because we're not another. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Okay. So, so we we go here now and and so we turn here and we turn to and we could go on 8 through nine and and the voice was take he bride the bride said give me the book. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The voice was in the book. Give me the book. It's been unveiled. Give me the book. And it said take it. Eat it up. Okay. And then it said in verse 11, "And he said unto me, thou must prophesy again." Other words, I'll ride it this trail again. You must prophesy again. Prophesy again before many peoples, nations, and tongues, and kings. I don't know if it swept the world completely yet or not. I don't think so because Japan's still struggling over there, you see. So, uh, there's still seed to come in. Amen. We don't know when that last one comes in, &gt;&gt; but the last trump is sounded. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "The last trump sounds." At the time of the angels giving, the last message. The last trump sounds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, when is it going to end? When the last one recognizes her position in Christ. &gt;&gt; He doesn't take an immature bride. He takes a matured one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So let's continue on here. And so we read Revelation 10:7. Let's go to Revelations 8:1. And so here's the message of the seventh angel. Here's the message that he brings. Prophet said feast the trumpets. The message of the seventh angel. Revelations 10 is the seventh seal. Amen. So we know that the seventh seal was revealed through those seals. It was the mystery. &gt;&gt; Right? All right. So we come down here and we see here in verse 8 verse one and when he he who the lamb the lamb all right the lamb but what is he now what does he how's he coming now it's still the same person but now the lion &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; are you with me all right now the lion is voicing why because he voices at the end the lion the king and the king was sword was placed in the hand of his prophet. Brother Brandham said it like this and he said these mysteries are laying there and he said he put it he he sends it down puts it in the hands of the seventh angel and he said there it is to reveal it to the people because God will do nothing but he reveals himself. So here's the lion coming, the lamb. Now the end here and turn, John turned to see the lion. He saw a lamb, bloody, wounded, paid the price, paid a great price for yours and mine's redemption. &gt;&gt; But the redemption goes on until and it's not finished until he takes this book. Now he's got to reveal what he did pay for. Now he's got to reveal. He's got to make known to those that are hearing can hear the word calling them because they're the mystery in the book. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see what the prophet See what this message is bringing us to our position. &gt;&gt; The opening of the seals, the voice of God is positionally placing his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness, brother David. I about like to come off unglued on that. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; It's positionally placing the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what's this voice still doing? Saying, "Come. &gt;&gt; Come." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What's she The spirit of the bride say, "Come." &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to go quickly this. I look can look up a lot of these scriptures, but second Corinthians, we read it. We have not come here to minister the letter. Amen. He's not. He see how the message said. Let me let me just turn over there just a minute now. You don't have to turn over there. Just let me get the words right on it. Second Corinthians chapter 4 or chapter 3, excuse me, verse or six. Who also we're not sufficient of ourselves. Verse 5. No, we're not. We're the living word made manifest, but we're not sufficient. David's not sufficient in himself. You're not sufficient in yourself. There's no sufficiency in us &gt;&gt; to think anything of as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God. &gt;&gt; Verse six, who also hath made us. Now, there it is. Who also hath made us. We didn't make ourselves. Who also hath made us. Other words, there's an ability given to his bride to hear his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Okay. Many hear the voice, but not many understand the voice. Many hear the voice. Many can read the scriptures. Many see the scripture, &gt;&gt; but they can't understand what's hid in that scripture &gt;&gt; because he's hid it from the wise and prudent would reveal it to babe. Seed of God &gt;&gt; that here can hear the word. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're not ministers of the letter because the letter kaleth. We're ministers of the New Testament. Yes. The new covenant, the blood covenant, but not of the letter. That's remma. Not of the letter. See, God hid himself in a letter. God hid himself in word in letter form. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But underneath that letter is logos. That's hid. Only ones that can receive that are those that are born again. You cannot know this message without being born again. You cannot see it. No man can see the kingdom of God except he's born again. &gt;&gt; You cannot understand the kingdom of God unless you're born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And so it's you can't there's no way to receive it. But to those that are born and only the bride can be truly born again, &gt;&gt; that's who's going in the rapture. Who they are, I don't know. I preach the truth. God reveals the truth. What's pulling on your heart? Why are you sitting here tonight? What's drawing you? &gt;&gt; Right? There's something beyond yourself. Something that sounds right in your soul. Even though everything around you is speaking contrary to it. Even your own thinking, &gt;&gt; even your own feelings are speaking. But there's something drawing me. Something inside of me. Something is there that I didn't put there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see? See, there's something in me. I was looking. I had that quote here, but something is drawing me. Something Oh, yeah. Here it is. See, he that heareth my words. It just isn't set and listen to it. He's talking about John 5:24. He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life. And he goes to the to to the the the the prostitute and say, "Do you hear the word?" Yeah, we heard the word. They all heard the word. &gt;&gt; But who could receive it? &gt;&gt; Amen. He that heareth my word and believeth? Who can believe it? &gt;&gt; Who's going to believe the report? Who's going to believe this report? Who's going to who's going to who's going to believe the voice of the beloved here? &gt;&gt; Amen. Those that were in him to begin with, those that were his children. He said, "I'll reveal it to babes. I'll hide myself in simplicity and reveal myself through simplicity." It isn't how much educated you have. You can't figure out what he's saying. It takes the Holy Ghost birthing you to hear this word. &gt;&gt; That's why the new birth, you must you must be born again. Not just have a a feeling. Oh, I I felt feelings. I sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh shivered. I I was I I I repented. I was baptized his name. Then why'd you stop? &gt;&gt; Why did you not go on? Did not he promise you would receive the Holy Ghost, the gift of the Holy Spirit, if you truly have repented and took and by faith accepted what he said and outwardly proved it by a baptism in his name as an outward expression of your faith in the finished work of God. &gt;&gt; Then why' you slow why' you stop? &gt;&gt; Go on. &gt;&gt; Receive it. Receive him. &gt;&gt; He promised it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Brother Bram said they were they aimed at that's what Ephesians did. They were aiming but then they relaxed. &gt;&gt; They didn't go on. Many of them go on think, "Well, I'm okay now. I was baptized in his name." And you find yourself out here in the world. You said, "Why am I doing this? I thought I was saved." &gt;&gt; Satan coming to you and say, "I thought you said you were a believer." &gt;&gt; Who is the believer? &gt;&gt; Is David the man the believer? Am I the man? The person is not what comes predestinated. Eternal life from God. It's the seed &gt;&gt; that comes predestinated. Jacob I loved. Esau I hated. Well, that sounds cruel, doesn't it? But God knew Jacob &gt;&gt; and he was a shyer. He was a deceiver. But yet God said, "I've chosen him." &gt;&gt; Because the seed of God was in Jacob. So it's not And before either boy was born, before they did either good or bad works, God already chose them. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not what you do. It's not how you produce it. It's not your works. God put Satan turning you around a pole. Round a pole. Look at the mistakes you made. Look at this. You can't receive this. You can't have this. No. I beg your pardon. It's for you. Because in your heart, that eagle believed the voice of that eagle. I don't care if he was in a barnyard. &gt;&gt; It's not what you do. It's what God already did for you already. &gt;&gt; He already chose you in himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've already been chosen in him. Why would he be pulling you? Why would you have a pull in your heart if you weren't him? Is there a deep calling? Then there's a deep right here tonight to respond to that call. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch that deep. Just respond to it. That's all God said. Do you believe me or don't you believe me? He didn't ask you to figure it out. He didn't say, "Do do he said he didn't say do this work, do that." He said, "Believe what I'm saying. Just believe it. Accept it." Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what Satan doesn't want you to do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Is accept the truth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because he can't fight the truth. He can only come on the battlefield of your ground of your mind and say, "Oh, well, you thought." That's what he told Eve. Let me explain it to you. You thought if you ate of this tree, you would die. Oh, now you know that's God's too good a God to do that. Why? Why, you pretty little thing. You know, you were made for this purpose and and why God wouldn't kill you. Well, he wouldn't. Did he say he would? Did he say you would die? &gt;&gt; Okay. Then why did he pay the price for you? If you weren't valued enough, why would he pay the price for your redemption and your salvation? And then here tonight telling you, I bought you. I paid the price of you. And now I'm calling you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All you need to do is surrender your life to me. &gt;&gt; Accept it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't try to figure it out. There's not enough works you can do. I don't care how radical you were. I don't care how dirty you were. I don't care anything about that. &gt;&gt; Paul was a murderer. Paul was a deceiver. Paul b took Christians and beat them and everything else. And yet God said, "I've chose him. He's going to be a messenger to my and and did God look at that?" No. The blood covered that. I said, "I'm I love him. I first loved him when he was unlovable." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not anything you can do or ever will do. &gt;&gt; It's grace of God to you through the revelation of himself living in you. He's drawing you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're his own. You always were his own. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He can't come to him unless he calls you. And if he's calling you, you can come to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, I've got off the little about off the track here. Let's go back. All right. Now, so Christ in you is the mystery, the secret revealed, the secret revelation that she is him. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Now, so we we go back over here. I Okay. So, we see that when this when the seventh seal Oh, okay. Now, I Yeah, we're not ministers of the letter, but we're ministers of the spirit of the letter. For the for the letter kleth, but the spirit giveth life. Amen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; There's your voice. &gt;&gt; There's what we're preaching. That's our ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Okay. So, we're ministering the thought, the faith. Now, as I said, who is this believer in you? It's not David. You put your name in. It isn't David. The believer is Christ revealed in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the believer. The believer is the faith of God. His own faith revealed in you, &gt;&gt; revealed to you. God is my rock. So what is the believer? The believer is the faith of God moving in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. So, we're ministers of the spirit. Now, Matthew 13. Matthew 13 verse 9, who hath ears to hear, let him hear. He just got done speaking of the ser and some fell on this ground wayside, some in stony places, etc., etc. And then in verse 9, he said, "Who hath ears? Who hath? Who hath ears?" When were you given ears to hear? &gt;&gt; You didn't learn it through theology. You didn't learn it yourself. You can't know it anyway. In fact, his his thoughts are higher than your thoughts. His ways are higher than your ways. But as I said, something inside of me, see, it isn't just sitting listening to the word. That's receiving it. See, receiving it. You believe it. Something inside of you tells you it's right. You've accepted it. You believe it. It's yours. &gt;&gt; How do you hear the word? You hear it with your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. That's right. You may hear the rema coming through here, but what's your heart saying? What's your heart receiving? &gt;&gt; So, you hear the voice with your heart? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, so we see in Matthew 13, he said that and then verse and then the disciples asked him said, "Why?" He said unto him, "Why speakest thou unto them in parables?" &gt;&gt; We've heard you speak. You're speaking in parables. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he gave the reason why. He answered and said unto them, "Because it is given unto you." They heard the parable, but he said, "Because it's given unto you." Other words, I know you're going to hear beyond &gt;&gt; the rema. &gt;&gt; You're going to be able to hear what I'm saying &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost will open it to you. When the Holy Ghost has come, he will lead you. The spirit of truth will lead you into all truth. You don't have to worry about how you're going to receive it. You don't have to worry. All you need to do is feed on the opened word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The message was sent for your deliverance. The message was sent for your going home. The message was sent for you to be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the message is revealed in you, it's your evidence. It's your identification. &gt;&gt; Because the evidence is hearing this word. &gt;&gt; The evidence is hearing the voice. That's the evidence of the true Holy Spirit in you. So when you hear that and can receive that, that's the evidence that you're already in the resurrection, you're already headed toward a rapture. That's the evidence. It's not your works. It's not whether you failed today or tomorrow. The Bible even said the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord. Though he fall, wait a minute. I thought you said the order of the Lord ordered my steps. And now he's saying though he fall &gt;&gt; he shall not be utterly cast down &gt;&gt; because who's he falling into God's hand. &gt;&gt; He'll fall into my hand and not going to be utterly cast down. My grace will pick him back up because I was the one that led him to fall. I was the one that knew he would fall. I was the one that did it for a purpose that I might fulfill my purpose through them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through him. through the individual. So, so mistakes and failures has nothing to do with it. When you come under the blood and identified to be under that blood, Satan cannot break through that blood and get to you &gt;&gt; because the real you is what's been alive and brought to life on the inside. You were his seed or you would never hear his call. God's trying to show you, I'm calling you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, that's right. And because that eagle was in the barnyard and amongst the chickens, I heard the voice of God when I was 12 years old sitting in a barnyard of chickens. &gt;&gt; But I heard the word and it spoke to me and it reverberated inside of me. The eagle did because he was an eagle to begin with. Do you realize you were his to begin with? You were chosen to begin with and you can't do enough works right now to merit him. No way, no way, no shape, no form. For by grace are you saved through faith. That's his faith. For by grace are you saved through faith. And that is the gift of God. It wasn't what you got. He gave it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so you see here to know him is life. See, it's something inside of you that tells you it's some he said my I know my sheep and I am known of them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When did he know me? And when did I know him? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm known of him. Amen. So he that believeth and heareth my word and believeth on him sent me has passed from death unto life and shall not come into the judgment but has passed judgment because God on Calvary, our Lord on Calvary took all of your judgment. So when you receive that, receive him. There is no judgment. Satan cannot bring judgment. Your judgment is dismissed. the the that your judges said case is dismissed. I can't find one thing against you. &gt;&gt; You're free. &gt;&gt; And who he sets free is free indeed. Therefore, there's can't be no condemnation. No more judgment. You stood your judgment in Christ. That's it. That's it. The end of the story. That's it. When he comes in, he seals you with his spirit. You're sealed to the day of your body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're going to grow up into his very image. You're going to grow up into his stature. Amen. And what is that? The capstone is the female of himself. Other words, that capstone, he caps it with himself revealed in bride form. &gt;&gt; Brother David, that's it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, so something inside of you says it's right. You've accepted it. You believe it. It's yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; How can he give you a gift and you receive it and not be yours? &gt;&gt; How can he give you invite you to come to him and then and then give you his life and then and and say, "Here, it's yours." What do you have to do to get it? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Take it. &gt;&gt; Just take it. &gt;&gt; It's yours. Take it. &gt;&gt; Quit trying to figure it out. Quit trying to listen to the devil to tell you you can't do it. That's that only proves to me that you can &gt;&gt; because God's put it in you to do it, to receive him. &gt;&gt; The devil is a liar and he's a father of lies. There's only one thing that's truth and that's God's word. And he said he said you're free. He said you have no there's no sin against you. He that's born of God cannot commit sin for the seed of God remains in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at that. Yes, you were born in sin. Yes, you were shaped in iniquity. But when God calls you, he's received you. &gt;&gt; You just have to accept it. &gt;&gt; I've already chosen you. Will you receive what I'm telling you? Yes, Lord. I've got There's only two powers at work here. There's the power of Satan and the power of the word. The power of the word, the power of God is his word. And the power of Satan is deception and unbelief. Satan cannot create. Amen. He cannot. He's can only pervert and add to or take away what God has already said in his word. His word is eternal life. God's word, God's logos, God's voice is eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The rema, the letter will pass away. &gt;&gt; Hello. But not that logos. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word before it was ever written. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? God expressed the thoughts of himself and you were in those thoughts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you're a part of the word. You always were a part of the word from the very foundation of the world. You're a part of the word. And you're here in this hour, your day, in your decreed day. And God said, I'm going to come down and I'm going to call you and make it known that you're mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what? I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; He's already gave me the proper identification to say that I am. Now, who's going to break that seal? That's right. &gt;&gt; He said the package, the thing is packed, right? &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to birth you. I'm going to give a new birth. I'm going to fill you with the Holy Ghost. Amen. By one spirit are we birthed into one body. &gt;&gt; How are you born? From above. I don't care what your past is. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; What about the woman at the well? &gt;&gt; What about Paul? &gt;&gt; What about all these? What was their past? That's right. &gt;&gt; They didn't do anything to merit God's word, God's grace. &gt;&gt; If it's grace, you don't merit grace. &gt;&gt; Not by works, lest any man should boast. &gt;&gt; And he loved you. The Bible said he loved you when you were unlovable. &gt;&gt; He loved you. All right. Go back to I I Colossians. I keep coming back to this. Go back to Ephesians 2 and read it. You are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which he has already for ordained you would walk in them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Whose works is it his &gt;&gt; working through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. All right. Now, let's try to get back on track here. So, he Matthew, we're in Matthew. Okay. 11 because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. Why do you speak in parables? Because to you it's given to know &gt;&gt; to them it's not given. &gt;&gt; You're going to hear my voice. &gt;&gt; I'm hiding it. Other words, I'm hiding I'm hiding this truth. I'm hiding this voice behind a parable. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you the word. I've come here fulfilling the scripture. I'm hiding this behind there. You're going to hear it because the spirit of truth, he's going to lead you into all truth. He's going to reveal it. What do I have to do to be saved? Nothing. Sir, what must we do? Repent. Be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Remission of sins. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. That was his answer. Right. &gt;&gt; Well, what else we have to do? Nothing else. Believe. Continue to feed. Continue to eat upon the open word. &gt;&gt; And let God open the word to you. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; It's up to him to do that. He made the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. I may not get through this tonight. All right. Now, that's all right. I'll follow what he says. Do &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; For who? Verse 12. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance. And whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even what he hath. Therefore speak I them in parables, because they seeing see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand, and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah said, "By hearing you shall hear and shall not understand." In other words, they're hearing the rema. They're hearing the word. They're hearing the voice spoken, but they can't receive that voice. Oh, they're hearing it. They're I mean, they're naturally hearing it. All right. But they don't understand. And seeing you shall see and shall not perceive. And seeing see now. And the people's hearts wax gross. Their ears are dull of hearing. And their eyes have they closed. At le any time I they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and should be and their understanding and should understand with their heart. Notice understand with their heart and should be converted. What's a conversion? &gt;&gt; You receive it in your heart. You're hearing this in your heart. And that eagle heard the eagle's voice because he was an eagle to begin with. &gt;&gt; That's the only one that can hear the voice of God is those that were his to begin with. All right. Now in the message in the r the rising of the sun I just want to read something real quick and there he spoke to me this paragraph 12 page two the seven seals will be opened. &gt;&gt; Now watch what he said they were the seven mysteries sevenfold mysteries plural sevenfold mystery. So, seven mysteries unfolded one mystery. What he's saying here, he said the seven mysteries mysteries a sevenfold mystery singular because in Revelation 10:7 it said the mystery singular, not mysteries. All right? The Bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed. Other words, it's going to be revealed in its fullness, &gt;&gt; completed. opened. All right? Because it's been revealed little by little. He's he's revealed it, but he's never let the mystery out. Okay? Now, so and yet we yet a humble little group compared to the world. We've enjoyed these blessings hearing these mysteries and all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man, but by God himself. Lion &gt;&gt; sword was in his hand. &gt;&gt; All right. Whose hand? God's hand. &gt;&gt; And it just fit his hand. All right. So, who was who was what was that sword? It was the king's sword. Not a king. &gt;&gt; The king. &gt;&gt; So, who's opening these mysteries? The king, &gt;&gt; not William Brandham. The king. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Through that prophet &gt;&gt; to what? Heart of bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because we're not ministers of the letter. We're ministers of the spirit. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So now, not by God, by God himself that opened those seven mysteries. Now watch what the seven mysteries being opened is one mystery. Now watch what the one mystery is. He's making it known right here. Don't let it pass you by. The one mystery, sevenfold mysteries, opening one mystery. &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Brandham called it a sevenfold mystery too. See? All right. So the of and what is it of what the church was? Now who's it going to speak to? Somebody right here tonight is speaking to. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Of what the church was. &gt;&gt; How it was in Christ at the beginning. &gt;&gt; And how it would be revealed in the last day. Oh my goodness. Look at this. So, what's the secret? What's the seven seal secret? &gt;&gt; You &gt;&gt; which is what? &gt;&gt; What did he say? You were him. &gt;&gt; What else did he say? You were Christ. What else did he say? See &gt;&gt; Christ the bride taken out of the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What is What are you? You're the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; All that God was, he poured into Christ. First phase. First one of it. First coming. All that all that all that Christ was, he poured into his body, the bride. Second coming. &gt;&gt; What happens after that? to rapture, meeting in the air, wedding supper. What is that? Third coming right back to the millennium. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Eden, &gt;&gt; three, three things. &gt;&gt; Three comingings. How you know? You know that? Do you realize he Christ comes three times? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Once to redeem, pay the price for redemption goes on through the ages. Comes down here. It opens the seals. Do you realize what the seals did? He laid claim on what he redeemed. Where was those redeemed? In that section of the book called the book, bride book. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's the bride book. That's that little book in the hand of the mighty angel, which is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That had his picture taken. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. If you want to go on where I just read to you out of spo rising of the sun, go on and read from paragraph 12 or through paragraph 17 and he'll tell you what he had to go in me. I had to go west caught up into that constellation to fulfill seven. Amen. And what to receive the message of that seventh seal. And I come back here and it's been revealed. Have we caught that? He said in this this last few days meeting me. He said he would meet me in a little room. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Every one of them. And he also but you have to go you have to go behind the veil yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not to that room, &gt;&gt; but into the room of your soul &gt;&gt; and become unveiled by him and come out and you can't explain it. &gt;&gt; You don't know what took place. I don't know. But I'm changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I can see it in the word here, but I can't give it to you. &gt;&gt; You have to go in there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they that were ready went into the marriage. &gt;&gt; And last one, door shut. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And then the Bible says then, then I mean in Revelation, well, we'll get to it in a minute, but I'll say it right now. Then in Revelations, the marriage is come. Verse nine, blessed is he that's called to the wedding supper of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; the marriage supper. Called to it. But the marriage has come, but the going to the wedding supper, brother Bram said, is the rapture. &gt;&gt; Takes you there. The rapture is what takes you to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm I don't want to go out too far. That's another message, but I want to hit the high points of this. Okay? So, we'll lay that aside. I want you to know that was the revelation contained in the seventh seal. So when he opened the seventh seal, let's go to Revelation. Did I read all of that or not? I don't know. Revelations 8:1. Let's go back here. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence. There's what I got to hit right there. There was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour. Now, in paragraph 105 through 109 of Christ, the mystery of God revealed, let me just read this portion. I don't have time. I'm losing out of time here, but in in the Christ, the mystery of God revealed in paragraph 105. And God had a purpose and a hidden mystery. And that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning. The hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind. Are you hearing this &gt;&gt; thought? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That he had in his mind before the before the world ever began. And wasn't it the heart? It's I read it to you Sunday, but I'll say it again. The heart purpose of God, the heart purpose was to choose a bride of his own choosing. &gt;&gt; She was for ordained a part a part of him from the foundation of the world. That was his heart purpose. &gt;&gt; His heart purpose was on the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can read it page page 163 of the church age book, paragraph 163. All right. So he said that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself. Watch what he said. Seeing how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living. &gt;&gt; Then you will understand clearly then I believe what is being done. &gt;&gt; All right. God's great mystery. Paragraph 106. God's great mystery. It's a secret. of how how what it's a secret of how how what you find out later on he's talking about his coming of how he would come all right it's a secret he he brother said he kept it a secret we know he did seven ages he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it no they didn't angels didn't even understand it wasn't revealed to them because it was sealed led up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Even the son didn't know it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; When he would come, the angels didn't understand it. &gt;&gt; They didn't know this mystery of how it would be. They didn't know it. But brother Brandham said later on after he come and and was ascended up and come back in the book of Revelations, now the full revelation of him is made known. And now he's revealing the mystery of how. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's still a mystery of that day and that moment, but we know we're here &gt;&gt; and we know how he comes in bride form. &gt;&gt; The revealing of himself, the son of man is being revealed. &gt;&gt; She has one ministry, the revealing of the son of man. &gt;&gt; That's her ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's not out to to to build up a church, build up an organization. She has one thing to do. &gt;&gt; That's her ministry is reveal the son of man. &gt;&gt; And it was revealed through a son of man. The prophet said, "You're not feeding on a man. You're feeding on the body word of the son of man." The word for the season, the carcass, the fresh meat, the mana. &gt;&gt; And what's it revealing? The mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your name is in that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The book held it. The bel book held the secret of who you are, where you come from. That book held that. It contained names and the book was sealed up until the end. &gt;&gt; He said if it wasn't if it was revealed, Satan would have got a hold of it and done great damage. &gt;&gt; But he can't know this. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Because it's beyond him. It's the third pull. And he can't receive it. &gt;&gt; He can't hear it. He can't understand it. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; See that? Okay. Then he comes down here and he says, he said, "So the angel didn't understand it. He didn't reveal it to him." That's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened, there was silence. Why? Because it's a secret and everything hushed up. They didn't know anything about it. They were awed by it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Here it is. They knew God had promised a revealing. We They knew something was sealed up. And here it is opened. The silence is the secret. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it's been opened. He noticed seven seals were opened. Not six only. Seven. &gt;&gt; It opened. He said it's open. And he said it's already opened. It's opened. &gt;&gt; And he's telling you he's telling you right here. Let me just I got I've got to read this. If I don't get anything else, it's going to be this is it. He said, now watch. He said, so it was silence. Jesus, when he was earth, they wanted to know when he would come. He said, not even the son himself know when it's going to happen. That was silent to him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. See, the son himself, he could only know as God revealed it to him. He said, "The son of himself can do nothing but what God shows me." Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, neither can we. We have the same We are under the same the same um uh uh how do he word that? The son, he could do nothing until God revealed it to him and said, "Neither can the bride." But we don't see it by vision. &gt;&gt; But it's a revelation to you. And you can't do it until it's revealed to you &gt;&gt; because it's done by faith, not by hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. And you can't do it either. That same harmony, that's what he said. The same harmony is to exist that existed between the son and his father is existing now between the bridegroom and the bride. &gt;&gt; She can't move. She can't do it until it's revealed to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's where so many get in trouble. They they feel inspired and they go out no revelation and try to speak something and it doesn't happen. Why? It wasn't a revelation to them. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; We're not how to speak our own thoughts. We're here to speak his thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. My father, Jesus said, "My father workketh hither to." That means he's working at that moment and I work and I can do nothing until he does work. &gt;&gt; And neither can you. &gt;&gt; That's right. So let God have his way on his time and in his time &gt;&gt; because he makes all things beautiful in his time. &gt;&gt; He's not he's he's perfect in his works. He said that in Psalms 18. He's perfect in his work. Well, what he does is perfect. And he said now it turns right around and said then he's made your way perfect. &gt;&gt; The same chapter, same verse, two verses down. And he's made your way perfect. So, who's leading you? &gt;&gt; Will it not be perfect? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. So, we keep going here. Even the son doesn't know. Okay. God has all of this to himself. It is a It's a secret. That's the reason there was silence. That's the reason it's a secret. That's the reason there was silence. Okay. in heaven for the space of a half hour. Seven thunders uttered their voices. Brother Brandham saw the seventh seal open. He looked for the interpretation and he went to those seven thunders. He said, "So, see, it's connected together. What is it?" He said, "It's the coming of the Lord." You see, the coming is a mystery because it's a secret catching away. &gt;&gt; It's not a public show, Brother David. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not publicly known. It's not even revealed to the public. &gt;&gt; She has this secret. She alone knows this. &gt;&gt; That's what makes her an object to others. &gt;&gt; Because they're not motivated by feelings. They're not motivated by senses. They're motivated and directed by him. Revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. All right. They're led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're ministers of the spirit. were led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; Did not he say he would lead you into all truth? Then what are you fretting about? &gt;&gt; What are we worried about? He said when he comes, spirit of truth, he'll lead you into all truth. &gt;&gt; Then if he said it, will he not do it? &gt;&gt; Are you Are you the one that's Are you the one that that is receiving what he promised? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. He said, "I'll never leave you nor forsake you." Are we not believing that promise? &gt;&gt; He said, "Nothing can happen to a believer by chance. It is all ordained." Do we believe what he said? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, see what Satan's against? He doesn't. He hates it when you take your stand upon the word and quit trying to figure it out and just take him at his word and only only underline only believe. Don't add to it. Don't take away from it. Only believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Accept it and act upon it. Confess it. God said so and that's I'm not talking with you, Satan. I'm not even going to discuss this with you. He said I'm healed. That settles it. He said I'm saved and that settles it. &gt;&gt; He said he saved me at Calvary. I believe it. &gt;&gt; And I my works are proving it. I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Amen. Now, okay. And John and they seven thunders under their voices. Seven mysteries. Seven thunders. Seven folds of God. One mystery. And John was forbidden to write it. See the coming of the Lord. That's one thing he hasn't revealed yet. You say, "Well, see, he hasn't revealed it yet." Wait a minute. Up to that time, it wasn't revealed. Up to this time, it wasn't. It's been opened. &gt;&gt; It's already been revealed. &gt;&gt; People looking, looking, looking. Oh my glorious. When he comes, he's already come &gt;&gt; and coming. &gt;&gt; Where's he coming? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In you. &gt;&gt; You're his promised word unveiled, revealing itself. There it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. What are we looking for? We're looking for the capturing. We're looking for the meeting in the air, his third coming. &gt;&gt; What's that opened up to? Wedding supper, millennium. &gt;&gt; See how he comes in such simplicity, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's what he promised. It was the bride. He called it the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just exactly. Go back to the Genesis and find out what was Eve before she was Eve. Mrs. Mrs. Adam. What was she? She was she was the secret of Mr. Adam &gt;&gt; revealed &gt;&gt; unveiled. What was that hidden secret? The seal had to be broke. Adam had to unveil himself. Who was she? &gt;&gt; Him. &gt;&gt; Revealed in another form. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she was the capstone revelation of the creation. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Do you realize this is a capstone message? Do you realize that Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing? &gt;&gt; All right, let's go to Romans. I gota Let's go to Romans. Kid with a couple scriptures and then I a couple quotes and I've got to quit. So I may go about 10 minutes over. So you just bear with me. He has showed it. Now watch what he's saying. He he's revealing of how he will come and when he will come and but and when we know he's come. We know when but we don't know that moment that change will be. Brother Brham said that was the part that was the thing that was in an unknown tongue. Amen. Are you with me? Okay. Now, he said he has showed it. He showed and he just said it's not been revealed yet, but now he's showing it. He's revealing it in every type that's in the Bible. Therefore, the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ. Brother B said, what's he titled this? The mystery of God revealed. Christ is that mystery. Christ in you would be that mystery revealed. All right. The secret the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose. He wanted to achieve in the entire Bible. And all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's great goal is. And now and now in this last day, he has revealed it and shows it. See how people want to pick up on those other quotes, not knowing what they're talking about, and say, "Well, see, he hadn't revealed it yet." That's not what he's telling you. He just said he has. &gt;&gt; All right. So the entire Bible. So he has revealed it and shows it and God's help will by God's help you. He said by God's help you will see you will see it right here this morning. And the Lord has had one has had it what the excuse me what the Lord has had in his mind all along. He has expressed it. All right. Therefore, you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this. What's he what's he talking about? The seven sealed mystery is open. And when it's opened in you, it's the secret of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When the seventh seal is opened, it was a secret. No longer was it a mystery. Now it's a secret. Hallelujah. All right. The secret is opened. The mystery is open. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet said, the prophet said the bride would hear that secret. And that's the only one it's revealed to is the bride. Think of this, brother David. That just shaking it, didn't it? And if he hadn't have opened this book, not a person of one of us would have been would have been lost because he had to come and redeem what he bought and purchased. It come to the time when the book had to be opened. The book, the marriage certificate, the book of those names. And how did he call your name? By revealing the mystery. &gt;&gt; That's what called your name in the book. That's what identifies you as being a part of him. That's what identifies you in as the mystery of himself. &gt;&gt; This is what he's trying to achieve. This is his goal. That was his heart purpose. God's heart purpose was to have a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? And she's she's she's called. She's chosen. and and by her own choosing. So, she's called and chosen. That's what the prophet said. She's called and she's chosen. Amen. All right. So, let's see. I've got to find a place here I can just close this off. Romans chapter 10. Let's go over there real quick. So he he said what a great meaning is to know to know this then to try to bring it to the people. See I haven't went into details to try to explain it as God has revealed it to me. He's talking about the seventh seal. All right. Now to bypass some things there in Romans chapter 10 and then we'll just move through it pretty quick here. Romans chapter 10. And verse 16, he's talking about how how shall they preach except to be sent. It is written, how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good. Okay. But verse 16, but have but they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, or Isaiah Isaiah saith, "Oh Lord, who hath believed our report?" Now, right there, they all heard it, but who hath believed it? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. So faith cometh by hearing. Hearing what? &gt;&gt; You have to read it. Everybody is hearing it. &gt;&gt; Everybody can hear it. &gt;&gt; Everybody has a word. They have the rema. It's right here. &gt;&gt; But they can't understand the thought underneath it. &gt;&gt; So you So you faith cometh by hearing and hearing receiving cometh by the word. Are you with me? All right. Now, but I I say verse 18, I say, see now watch, there's a hearing by the there's a hearing of the logos and there's a hearing of Reema in verse 17. But I say have or what's real faith come by? See, through the word. But I say, have they not or have they not heard? I just what I just said now. Have they not heard? Yes. Verily their sound, that sound is his thought declared in word or speech. That's sound. So have they not all heard? Yes. Verily their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world. But I say, did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy. By them who are no people and a foolish nation, I will anger you. There you are. I was found by a people that I was I very bold and said, I was found of them that sought me not. I was made manifest of them that ask not after me. verse chap Hebrews chapter 4 or chapter 3 his voice has gone out today the Bible said today verse 7 3:7 Hebrews today that's this day as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice logos harden not your hearts in the provocation in the day of the temptation of the wilderness when your fathers tempted me and proved me and saw my works 40 years Wherefore I was wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do heir in their hearts in their heart and they have not known my ways. So I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest. Then it goes down again while it is said today. Verse 15 and you can read the rest of it. Verse chapter 4 verse one. Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it. Verse two, for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them the sound. They all heard it, but not every one of them that heard it could receive it. Not everyone that heard it could receive the voice, understand it. Are you with me? All right. Now, he said, "For as well as unto them the sound went out, the gospel is preached as to us as well as them. But the word preached, the logos preached did not the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with what revelation faith in them that heard it. &gt;&gt; So they didn't have the the t the hearing post. They didn't have the ability to hear. So brother Brandham said concerning the mystery of Matthew 13, he said the mysteries here and this is Scoffield. He referred to Scoffield's understanding of this and he said it the mystery the mysteries here the mystery singular a mystery in scripture is a previously hidden truth I just read that in Christ the mystery God revealed paragraph 105 and so on is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but in which divinely revealed The message has gone out. Everybody's reading it. Everybody hears it. But not everyone can hear it, can hear, can receive it, can understand it. &gt;&gt; All right. Can't receive the voice. Is that true? &gt;&gt; I'm not saying who is and who. I just said that's what it is. All right. Then he said he said it's divinely revealed. But in which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation. So here's the revelation going out but there's a supernatural element. And what's that supernatural element? God given ability to hear the revelation. &gt;&gt; That's the element. That's the supernatural element. So for you for personal for for you personally it to be revealed to God personalizing himself to you by revealing that mystery to you personally. That's that supernatural element is the ability to hear what he's saying to to understand it. &gt;&gt; Not everybody can but they all heard it revealed. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Now, so brother Brandham said in the seventh seal, when the supernatural comes in, that's the mind of Christ. Don't ask me to explain it because he said, "I can't. You'll from now on just either be able to hear it or not hear it." See, I'm not going to explain it. And 1 Corinthians 2:16 said, "They that are spiritual have the mind of God." have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; So there you are. All right. Okay. I'm going to bypass. I'm going to close off now. Just listen carefully. I'll just make mention of this. In Revelation 5:13, John was having a a real jolly time. He said, "Everything heard me praise him and give glory to him." You know the scripture because brother Brandham said he happened to see his name written in the book. Are you with me? And he said also, he said he must have looked past the curtain of time. What's written? He looked past the curtain of time and said, "There's John. There he is." Now, that's He didn't say that just to be He said that for a reason because that's what the bride's doing. &gt;&gt; That's what she sees. My name was there. My name's in that revelation. My name's written right there. Because the mystery I'm having, I have the ability. I'm hearing the mystery and that's called me. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're a part of it to begin with. &gt;&gt; You're the mystery of God revealed. Okay. So So he's claiming what he purchased. Amen. I'm just going to keep moving down here. And we know in Daniel, we know in Daniel. Now just listen to this a minute real quick. Can I just have about five minutes? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Because only one is the is the is one here is the majority that answers. You say, "Well, I answered my mind." You need to say it. All right. Now, now I'm just I'm just relaxing a minute. Now, watch this. He's the great spiritual king over the spirit that's in us because we were in him at the beginning. You see, God in the beginning when he thought of you and thought of others like that thought of himself being tangible. That was his thoughts and he expressed his thoughts &gt;&gt; by word. There it is. That's why you can hear the message because you were in his thoughts. All right. The eternal God had eternal thoughts and that's why he decreed Jacob I loved and Esau I hated. Those were his eternal Jacob had was his eternal thoughts. All right, I'm going to move on. Okay, now so he says here, where am I? Here I've got to go back. Okay, there we are. All right. Now, Revelation 19:11 said, "Heaven opened and heavens consist of the word." Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen. So, he starts his ride and watch what the prophet says. And the body must follow the head. Verse 14. And they that followed him were stimulated with wine and oil, riding right along. What are they coming down? They know those seven thunders, the secret revealed, will issue the thing forth pretty soon. Amen. Issue what forth? Body change. What else will it issue? What was the seventh seal to do when it exploded here? It put out five stars. Remember the seventh seal is the end of time of all things. It ends the time. Remember, it couldn't be made known until the end of time. When the seventh seal was revealed, it identified to you and I were at the end. In fact, that's the exact words of the prophet. Don't you realize that seal being open signifies to us we've arrived. We're at the end because it could only be made known then. You see the importance of the message. You see where we're at? &gt;&gt; There's no more message coming. This is it. &gt;&gt; We're heading the the earth is heading for a for a baptism. Amen. &gt;&gt; These men that are puffing themselves up against the word are going to be destroyed. That's all. And and when he rides forth by the spirit of his word, by the by the by the sword of his own spoken word puts him destroys him. When he's done said, it's said. He's got to fulfill what he said. Is that right? So, we know that there's going to be a a real Armageddon. Amen. We're fighting a spiritual Armageddon right now, but there's a real Armageddon that's going to other words, just like our body change. It's going to come to full realization. So, will that come to full realization? But the starting of the ride, we're riding following him right on this is opened. &gt;&gt; It opens from there into the body change. It opens from there. It goes to the wedding supper. It blows out five more stars. Goes into millennium. goes from there into new heavens and new earth. Isn't that what he said? It ends a time for this. It ends a time for that and right off into he said and it goes right off into eternity. Now, what are you following? You're following his life. You're following the revelation. You're following him because he's your head and your head has come. It's appeared. &gt;&gt; Amen. There it is right there. All right. So now he said the body must follow the head. The wife follows a husband. &gt;&gt; Being that Adam was not deceived, he walked out with Eve. Eve was deceived. She was in the transgression or the or the entire resurrection of the whole body would have come forth in the day of the Lord Jesus when he came from the grave. Other words, he's saying he had to redeem her. She was lost. If she wasn't lost, then the whole body would have come up then. Okay. So, he had to pay the price of redemption and he had to rise again showing that it's that that her con her sin, her iniquity is put on the head of the devil. He's raised victorious over it and you raised with him. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so here we are. He said now he said but he had to redeem her which is his body. Is there anybody that's his body here? He had to redeem her, which is his body. See, it was the price of his blood. Claimed what he he claimed. He claims, excuse me, he claims what he's paid for. He comes to claim what he purchased. See, that's his ministry today. She had to be redeemed in order to come to him. Do you see it? She had See, she had she had to be claimed. She had to be claimed as his possession. He purchased it. That's at the cross. But now he had to come to finish redemption. And what held the mystery of that seventh seal. Amen. So here he comes right here and he's and he comes forth from the grave. He to redeemer which is his body. She has to be redeemed in order to come to him. Do you see it? See it. It couldn't have happened then. The redemption goes on. Now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming. But someday and it's not and we and he but he's saying that so you catch the vision. Someday he comes forth to get this book. John 14 2-3. He comes forth to receive us. He comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him. For the for that's the believer. That's the believer. The words in the book. So what is the seal opening? The words in the book. What is the third pull? The opening of the word. Is that right? The words were closed. And brother Brandham said, "And you," he just says it right here. "And you are the words in the book." And the word is him. All that and all that is in that it's him. And you're those words in the book. Daniel verse 9 12:9 was told to shut up the book until the time of the end the words would be closed that right John were forbidden to write it but now you the word are opened &gt;&gt; the message opens the word you're that word &gt;&gt; all right so the words is him that's the third pull he's opened the word he's opened the sealed mystery of the book. The book is now open. The mystery is now opened. He come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written in the book. He comes forth for this book of redemption. How about you say amen? He comes forth. Have we seen it? For the book of re for this book of redemption whose names are written in the book and I say, do we see it? And will we see it? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. whose names are written in the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb. And here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there. She can't recognize another headship. No sir. There's no bishop or nothing. She recognizes one headship. That's Christ. And Christ is the word. Oh my. I love that. &gt;&gt; She expressed she's his thought expressed. see in her as it was in Adam. We've just been through that. We are not come together to talk about the message. We are come together to get in the message. And the message is Christ. He is the word. That's right. We're to get into it. Get beneath it. Yes, sir. That's what we're supposed to do. We have to get beneath the token. Amen. All right. Can't you see where we're standing? Life is in the grain again. What is it? Just exactly the same grain that went in the ground. The same Jesus in the bride form. Uhoh. Well, &gt;&gt; that's what he said, didn't he? Same power, same church, same thing. The same word. The same word sucked up through these other words through these carriers come out here coming through the wheat plant. Come up out come out of the shuck. Came through the shuck and out of the shuck and come to a head here. It come to a head here. &gt;&gt; What is our ministry? The head. &gt;&gt; What is the bride's ministry today? The head. &gt;&gt; Where was that head? Where was the secret in the pyramid? When he opened it up, what did he open? White stone. And in it, nothing written on it. So I had to go west to get the revelation of that unwritten word. And you're a rock in that rock. For brother Brandham said, there's a rock in the rock. And the Peter, first Peter 2 expla testifies of that. It's the elect. Amen. You're that stone, a living stone. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, I don't have time to go into those. That's a whole message in itself. See, I'm just hitting this. The same Jesus in the bride form. Same words, same word sucked up these, come out here and come to a head. All that life that come up there picked up its people. Now it's forming. Now watch. It picked up its people. Tossle or or or stalk tossle. Amen. Shuck. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Out of the shuck come what? The same grain. Back to the same word. All right. Picked up its people. Life coming through there. Picked up his people. And now it's forming into a head for the rapture. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Who are you a part of that head? &gt;&gt; It's forming into the head. Who's forming into the head? All right. For the rapture, the germ, the germ that was in you at the beginning, the beginning was the word. So the germ that was in you at the beginning, you were in him. The germ that was in you at the beginning found you. right here in your decreed season. It found you. For the word that was in you at the beginning found you. St. John 1 1-2. God forces upward the spirit of God which is what we minister which is the word of God. My word is spirit. We are ministers of his spirit. My word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place. So when the spirit of the bride say come c o m e. What's it saying? Come to your position. Come to your place. The word puts her in her position. It positionally, the revelation of this message positionally places you, bride. It positionally places you &gt;&gt; in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. It positionally is placing you in Christ. So they she says come and let him that heareth say come. So where's the where under her messenger? She's the final voice to the final age. See it's sounding. It's sounding. The voice is sounding. Who's going to hear it? Those that are ordained to hear it. Receive it. Amen. See the voice calling the bride to her position. Come to her position. She is positionally placed in Christ. It that's what makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing. You see your place. Amen. The capstone revelation and she forms into that capstone. What is it? Formed into himself. &gt;&gt; My my my to his very image. So the head the corner that was rejected Jesus said the revel this upon this rock this cornerstone the revelation of who I am upon this revelation of who I am I'll build my church. Amen. So it started at the foundation correctly starts building coming right up to a fine razor edge of difference. Amen. What's the difference? One's able to receive the word the other can't. oath anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. There it is. One hears the word, the other can't. Both anointed, both shout, both have miracles, both have signs, but one can receive the word, the other can't for their season. Now, do you see where we're at? So, Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing. And the prophet said right after that, he said, "Can't you see where we're at?" So what? See what God's doing. He said, "Amen." Let's stand together. What a revelation. What a what a what a resurrection. See? See? My word of spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word. Then she's in Christ. That's what'll put her in her place. No national force will do it. National force is putting Israel there. National force of putting the church in the world council. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the word, the logos is putting the bride in the rapture. In her place, her position. What a resurrection this is. What a resurrection that was. But what a resurrection this is in this brideging of Christ out of dark denominationalism, darkness, dead creeds, graves. Arise, shine, for thy light has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. The message is the love letter to his bride. This message is the his voice, the logos, the thought expressed of his bride. She and she alone is able by grace to read between the lines. There it is. She can receive and hears, understands what is opened. Isn't that wonderful? See where that positions you? See where that identifies you, brother, sister? Then let's let off the pressure. Let's take a hold what we're called to take a hold of that word and walk with it. Enoch walked with God and was not. &gt;&gt; That's the simplicity of the rapture. You walk with God and God's obligated to take you out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's sing a song or two. Here we read between the lines which is his thought expressed in the word. The word promised for today. We're able to read his love letter. Amen. Why? Because we're part of him to begin with. Married. Amen. Let's sing a song. Come and dine. How many's willing to dine on the open word? Do you see the importance of it? This message, my brother, sister, listen.
