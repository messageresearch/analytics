[31:39] uh it worked so we praise God for
[31:42] that amen Matthew Chapter 2 verse1 let's
[31:45] pray first Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[31:50] have one desire tonight Lord and that is
[31:52] to hear from you Lord we could come up
[31:56] here and speak as a man and it might
[32:00] sound good to the ears and tickle the
[32:02] feelings Lord but father it would do
[32:04] nothing for the heart and the soul and
[32:07] Lord that's what we need is a changing
[32:09] of our hearts for Lord when the Seas get
[32:12] high and the wind blows hard Lord that
[32:15] is what holds Lord is at anchor father
[32:18] so Lord tonight I pray you'd speak to
[32:20] the Heart Lord Jesus take these words
[32:22] the simple thought that you have given
[32:24] Lord in your Simplicity in your revealed
[32:28] word father that you would touch us
[32:30] speak to us tonight we thank you Lord
[32:32] for these things in Jesus name we pray
[32:36] amen Matthew chap 2 verse
[32:42] 1 but now when Jesus was born in
[32:45] Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod
[32:47] the king behold there came wise
[32:50] men from the East to Jerusalem saying
[32:53] where is he that is born King of the
[32:55] Jews for we have seen his star in the
[32:57] east and are come to worship him when
[32:59] Herod the king had heard these things he
[33:00] was troubled and all Jerusalem with him
[33:03] and when he had gathered all the chief
[33:04] priests and scribes of the people
[33:06] together he demanded of them where
[33:08] Christ should be born and they said unto
[33:10] him it in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it
[33:12] is written by the prophet and thou
[33:14] Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not
[33:16] the least among the princes of Judah for
[33:19] out of thee shall come a governor and
[33:20] that shall rule My People Israel then
[33:23] Herod when he had privily called the
[33:25] wise men inquired of them diligently
[33:27] what time the star appeared and he sent
[33:29] them to Bethlehem and said go and search
[33:31] diligently for the young child and when
[33:33] you have found him bring me word again
[33:36] that I may come and worship him also and
[33:39] when he had when when they had heard the
[33:42] king they departed and low the star
[33:44] which they saw in the East went before
[33:46] them till it came and stood over where
[33:49] the young child was and when they saw
[33:51] the star they rejoiced with exceeding
[33:52] great joy when they were coming into the
[33:54] house they saw the young child with Mary
[33:56] his mother and fell down and wor woried
[33:58] him when they had opened their treasur
[34:00] Treasures they presented unto him gifts
[34:02] gold frankincense and myrrh and being
[34:04] warned of God and a dream that they
[34:06] should not return to Herod they departed
[34:08] into their own country another way amen
[34:11] Matthew chapter
[34:21] 6:33 but seek ye first the kingdom of
[34:24] God and his righteousness and all these
[34:26] things shall be added unto you may the
[34:29] Lord add a blessing the reading of his
[34:31] word you may be seated tonight all right
[34:34] see this works really good
[34:37] awesome so my title tonight is unashamed
[34:41] possessors of Truth and my subtitle is
[34:44] tenacious Seekers so as I was uh going
[34:49] through some the message and searching
[34:51] some different things and reading some
[34:53] quotes um SE seeking out what the Lord
[34:56] wanted me to speak tonight um I Came
[34:59] Upon it was quick I I thought of the
[35:02] word Seekers and um from there we have
[35:05] what we're going to minister on tonight
[35:07] I had no intentions of preaching
[35:08] anything about uh Christmas as it were
[35:12] but the wise men came to mind when I
[35:15] thought of The Seekers and um so the
[35:19] unashamed unashamed possessors of Truth
[35:23] so praise the
[35:26] lord we have the wise men and they were
[35:29] Seekers of Truth the sign in the star
[35:32] that um the the sign of the star in the
[35:36] heavens made them Seekers they were wise
[35:39] men but once they began to be drawn to
[35:45] the sign the star they became Seekers of
[35:49] truth because they wanted to know what
[35:52] it was the star was pointing them to and
[35:56] the definition
[35:58] of that or not the definition but the
[36:01] Fulfillment of that was truth and um
[36:06] praise the
[36:08] Lord so they read the sign they believed
[36:11] the message the sign had gave them you
[36:13] forgive me I'm a bit nervous just trying
[36:16] to relax still praise the Lord but God
[36:19] is faithful so they followed the star to
[36:22] find the king and they went to Herod and
[36:26] they said where is the king of the Jew
[36:27] so they knew by reading the sign of the
[36:29] star that there was going to be born a
[36:31] king and they praise the Lord so a a
[36:37] reference was made to the star but the E
[36:40] inas excuse me emphasis was on the
[36:42] reason for the star brother Bram says in
[36:46] uh God revealing himself to his people
[36:48] he always sends signs don't you believe
[36:50] it this will be a sign unto you you will
[36:52] find the child wrapped in swaddling
[36:54] cloth is that right the Wise Men
[36:56] followed a star that brought them always
[36:59] God gives signs and wonders and I think
[37:01] it's a sign to let us know that we are
[37:03] in the last day even the unbeliever is
[37:06] without excuse now he says in at Thy
[37:10] word 1951 now he will before certain
[37:14] people sometimes just before masses and
[37:16] multitudes but you remember the wise men
[37:18] what did they see when they followed to
[37:20] Jesus nobody else saw it it passed right
[37:22] over the observatory every planetarium
[37:25] is that right and every city had a
[37:26] planetarium they kept timeing by the
[37:28] stars is that right and isn't it strange
[37:30] that them wise men went right through
[37:32] city after city city after City
[37:34] following a star that even the
[37:36] stargazers and the men in the
[37:37] planetarium in telling the time and
[37:39] things never saw nothing of it they were
[37:42] looking for it that's where it's at you
[37:45] get what you
[37:47] expect so the wise men were looking for
[37:51] the star when they discovered it
[37:54] something about they we don't know how
[37:57] they came to that position but they were
[37:59] looking for the star and they knew that
[38:04] something was fixing to happen and they
[38:07] became obsessed with this star these
[38:10] three wise men I don't know if they if
[38:12] they were together when they discovered
[38:13] it or if because of their Obsession they
[38:15] were drawn together after it amen but it
[38:19] was all that they thought about it was
[38:22] all that they talked about um there was
[38:25] nothing else that they were concerned
[38:27] with there main focus their main
[38:29] discussions was all about this
[38:37] star
[38:39] now we know the star was a sign and so
[38:42] they discussed the sign they talked
[38:44] about the sign they fellowshipped around
[38:46] about the sign and um wise men of this
[38:51] wise men like this stargazers whatever
[38:54] they were they they had many many
[38:56] colleagues they were
[38:57] respected right because they are
[38:59] considered smart amen human beings have
[39:01] a way of laboring someone as smart so
[39:03] therefore they know everything that
[39:05] they're talking about and they lift them
[39:07] up it's just the way of human nature so
[39:09] here you have these respected men but
[39:12] they begin to obsess over this star and
[39:15] they begin to because brother Bram says
[39:17] in that quote all these people reading
[39:18] time for the Stars yet only those Three
[39:20] Wise Men followed him so there was
[39:22] something that they were all missing
[39:24] they could see it but they could they
[39:27] weren't catching the revelation of it it
[39:31] was not exciting anything down within
[39:33] them and we know that as Believers
[39:35] there's a deep call to the Deep there's
[39:37] something to respond and so as it were
[39:39] this was their Destiny so no doubt
[39:41] everybody thought they were completely
[39:43] crazy right amen aren't you glad the
[39:45] world thinks you're crazy tonight the
[39:48] Lord so they talked about this
[39:51] star and then they found
[39:53] it they have the sign amen they found
[39:57] the star they had the sign now what to
[40:01] do what to do now we have the star we
[40:04] see the star we've discovered this star
[40:06] now what are we going to do about it
[40:09] maybe a new doctrine yeah
[40:12] yeah right now everybody says oh these
[40:15] PE these guys have been talking about
[40:17] this star for so long and it's going to
[40:19] come together because you know
[40:20] beforehand right I don't know how many
[40:22] of you saw on the 21st Jupiter and
[40:24] Saturn is pretty cool we we knew it was
[40:27] going to happen so the wise men knew
[40:30] these planets were going to come
[40:31] together to make this star and that's
[40:32] all they talked about no one else cared
[40:34] about it but them and then now it
[40:37] happened now there's proof that these
[40:40] guys weren't completely crazy and so now
[40:43] everybody's talking about this star this
[40:46] star wow look at this star but there was
[40:49] nothing compelling them I'm taking some
[40:50] freelance here there's nothing
[40:51] compelling them to follow after it so
[40:54] what what to do now with the star a new
[40:56] religion maybe not a new doctrine maybe
[40:59] a new religion First Church of the star
[41:02] Maybe Star only yeah amen it's a slide
[41:08] reference praise the Lord but what to do
[41:12] now what to do about this star about
[41:16] this sign well it was time for action
[41:20] and the Sons and Daughters of God are
[41:23] always on the Move that's right there's
[41:26] always in in action yes those if if
[41:30] everyone who they who the wise men Left
[41:33] Behind when they set out on this journey
[41:35] knew of the star and knew of its
[41:38] existence nothing compelled them into
[41:41] action because there was not a
[41:44] convincing there was not a revelation
[41:46] that this star held anything but a
[41:49] significance in the sky and yet these
[41:52] were learned men these were people who
[41:55] understood the stars and understood
[41:56] astrology ology and knew that you know
[41:59] there's a sign there's something going
[42:00] to happen on Earth but yet nothing
[42:03] compelled them to take action upon this
[42:05] sign except for the three wise men there
[42:08] was something in their heart that said
[42:10] we need to go find what this is all
[42:12] about and so they followed the star they
[42:15] followed the sign their focus their
[42:17] Obsession are you catching where I'm
[42:20] what I'm I are you catching what I'm
[42:22] throwing right they were they were after
[42:25] the sign that's all they thought and
[42:26] that's all they talked about but there
[42:28] was something driving them to find the
[42:30] reason behind the sign and there were
[42:34] critics there are always critics there
[42:37] alwayss amen if you want to get rid of
[42:40] critics you're going to have to wait
[42:41] till the
[42:45] Millennium if you bow to every critic
[42:48] there'll be a Critic for the critic and
[42:50] there's nowhere you can go with that
[42:53] there is always critics and Teddy
[42:55] Roosevelt had gave a speech called The
[42:58] Man in the arena and so
[43:01] felt it is not the critic who counts not
[43:04] the man who points out how the strong
[43:06] man stumbles or where the doer of Deeds
[43:08] could have done them better the credit
[43:10] belongs to the man who is actually in
[43:11] the arena whose face is marred by dust
[43:13] and sweat and blood who strives valant
[43:16] who HS who comes short again and again
[43:18] because there is no effort without error
[43:20] and shortcoming but who does actually
[43:22] strive to do the Deeds who knows great
[43:24] enthusiasms the great devotions who
[43:26] spend defends himself in a worthy cause
[43:28] who at the best knows in the end the
[43:30] Triumph of high achievement and who at
[43:32] worst if he fails at least fails while
[43:34] daring greatly so that his place shall
[43:37] never be with those cold and timid Souls
[43:39] who never know VI who neither know
[43:41] Victory nor
[43:43] defeat it is not the critic who counts
[43:47] amen and we as children as Sons and
[43:49] Daughters of God as heirs to the throne
[43:52] as child Children of the king we are not
[43:57] called to simply be satisfied with the
[44:00] star we are not called to be simply
[44:02] satisfied with the with the sign that
[44:04] was in the heavens amen we are called to
[44:08] get into the arena a that you can't sit
[44:11] on the sidelines because as the The
[44:13] Story Goes about the fence the devil
[44:15] owns the sidelines you have to get in
[44:18] you're either in or you're out but you
[44:21] have to see the star you had to come to
[44:24] the star and now something had to had
[44:27] within you you won't be the same after
[44:30] that you because you go away knowing a
[44:32] portion of truth because the sign brings
[44:35] you a portion of the truth amen and so
[44:38] they once you see that is now your time
[44:42] to take action will you step into the
[44:46] arena amen we are called to be soldiers
[44:48] of the Cross to fight a bloody battle
[44:51] amen but God is faithful and God has
[44:54] given us the strength and had God has
[44:56] given us the calling that's the Paradox
[44:58] and I'm getting ahead of myself but
[45:00] we'll just follow the lord that's the
[45:01] Paradox of seeking after God because the
[45:04] scripture says he seeks after us and so
[45:08] you would that the wise men were
[45:10] predestinated to accept the sign of the
[45:13] star but to go further than everyone
[45:16] else to go further than the rest of
[45:18] their their Church to go farther than
[45:20] what than simply agreeing upon a sign
[45:23] that there was a star in the heavens
[45:25] that this thing happened amen those
[45:27] other wise men that didn't follow after
[45:29] the star no doubt talked about these
[45:32] planets that came into existence because
[45:34] to in our day that we live in we know
[45:36] which planets they were so it had to be
[45:38] recorded somewhere and so this they they
[45:40] talked about yeah there there was this s
[45:42] but there was nothing about it that
[45:44] compelled them to take
[45:47] action now the wise men with this
[45:50] Revelation that this star holds a
[45:52] greater truth amen they step forward on
[45:57] ashamed you have to be unashamed to
[45:59] stand among the
[46:01] critics and press on for God you have to
[46:04] be unashamed to go on a crazy Journey
[46:07] who knows how far to find the answer to
[46:10] the sign there has to be something about
[46:13] you that gives you the ability Amen to
[46:15] raise your hand in surrender you have to
[46:19] be unashamed of what you are called to
[46:23] do so there is only one thing to do for
[46:26] the wise men and that was to
[46:29] go the scoffers laughed but it is not
[46:32] the critic that matters they were
[46:34] unashamed of the truth they now
[46:37] possessed and there was just one thing
[46:39] left to
[46:40] do so now they're on their Journey no
[46:44] doubt everywhere they stopped right
[46:45] here's these guys I mean the the uh the
[46:48] the the books and the pictures portray
[46:50] these guys is very well ordained
[46:53] or whatever covered with fancy stuff
[46:56] fancy clothes say so they they look like
[46:58] men of money right according
[47:02] to uh pictures and whatnot I'd never
[47:06] have seen them with my own
[47:08] eyes and um so no doubt everyone's like
[47:11] wow you know they pass through Little
[47:12] Village what are these guys doing here
[47:14] they probably had several more camels
[47:18] carrying their tents and their servants
[47:20] and so on and so forth that was how they
[47:22] traveled then and they had all this you
[47:25] know they were going and then everyone
[47:26] could see their they're people of of of
[47:28] something and so well hey wow where are
[47:31] you going are you coming here where
[47:33] where where are you headed well we're
[47:35] not sure we're just following the star
[47:39] right
[47:41] oh have a nice
[47:43] day
[47:48] right listen if it was something that
[47:50] everyone accepted as a thing to
[47:53] do nobody would have cared otherwise and
[47:55] it wouldn't have just been those three
[47:57] right you're talking millions of people
[48:00] right right only these three men were
[48:03] compelled to follow the star not even
[48:05] the
[48:06] Shepherds everyone comes their own way
[48:08] to the truth the Shepherds were given it
[48:10] a different way the wise men were
[48:13] following the star so where are you
[48:16] going you know you must be on a business
[48:18] trip are are you going to see this so
[48:20] and so of high stature in the city no
[48:23] we're just following the
[48:25] star they were were
[48:27] seeking amen they were seeking in faith
[48:31] they were just following the
[48:34] sign they left what they knew behind
[48:37] them not know not knowing how long it
[48:40] would take I'm going through my notes
[48:42] fast tonight praise the Lord not knowing
[48:46] how long it was going to
[48:48] take if you're following after something
[48:51] like a star I've never done it maybe you
[48:55] have um you it if you don't if you're
[48:57] not told where the destination is you're
[48:59] just following along it's like it's like
[49:01] you someone says I we we'll take you to
[49:03] such and such a place and you never been
[49:04] there before say you're out of town from
[49:05] out of town visiting amen and sometimes
[49:08] it can seem like it took really long to
[49:10] get there and then it's really fast on
[49:11] the way back because you know you see
[49:13] signs along the way of how close you're
[49:15] getting to the destination but on the
[49:17] way there you have nothing you have no
[49:19] point of reference except for you're
[49:21] following or you're riding along with
[49:23] your guide so they had no point of
[49:25] reference No Doubt they had never been
[49:27] to these parts of the world but they're
[49:29] just following after the star that takes
[49:31] great faith SS of God takes great faith
[49:33] it takes great faith for you to sit here
[49:35] tonight and follow after the sign after
[49:38] the revelation of the truth I'm being
[49:41] ahead of myself behind the sign praise
[49:43] the Lord but they knew they would find
[49:45] the answer they had faith that they
[49:48] would find the answer they they they
[49:50] would not have embarked upon this great
[49:53] journey they would not have left their
[49:55] their Prestige and left their nice homes
[49:57] and their own cozy bed they would have
[49:59] never gone after this crazy adventure
[50:02] until unless they actually believed they
[50:04] would find something underneath the
[50:08] star they had a revelation that there
[50:11] was something to be
[50:12] seen amen they were looking for the
[50:15] truth behind the sign and they got the
[50:21] the star led into Jerusalem where we
[50:22] read in the scriptures that they go to
[50:24] Bethlehem and they found the truth
[50:26] behind the sign Emmanuel amen God With
[50:29] Us no doubt they sat with Mary and
[50:32] Joseph and heard the testimony of a
[50:35] virgin giving
[50:36] birth they now had met and seen the
[50:39] Fulfillment of scripture amen they found
[50:43] the reason for the sign the answer and
[50:47] there's one thing that happens when you
[50:49] come face to face for the reason behind
[50:51] the sign when you come face to face with
[50:54] the truth of what your of what you've
[50:56] been seeking for and that that that is
[50:58] that you will never be the same people
[51:01] that have come face to face with the
[51:03] sign they are never the same they go
[51:05] about all they can do is talk against it
[51:08] there's those that have come face to
[51:09] face with the sign and discovered the
[51:11] truth behind it and you can never
[51:14] unconvince them of
[51:16] it amen because why it is a
[51:20] revelation of Jesus Christ these wise
[51:23] men in their own time in their own way
[51:25] received a revelation of Jesus
[51:28] Christ now what was their testimony this
[51:31] is we're getting into the meat of this
[51:32] tonight what was their testimony was it
[51:35] about the star they went they followed
[51:38] the star they found the Messiah they
[51:40] left they went back home and they went
[51:42] on with their lives we hear nothing more
[51:43] of them in scripture but we know they
[51:45] were men and they had to talk about what
[51:48] they experienced so what was their
[51:50] testimony did they talk about the star
[51:53] I'm sure they mentioned it in passing
[51:55] but what what was the focus of their
[51:58] testimony what was the when they told
[52:00] the story as it was in those days to to
[52:03] to tell stories to pass on to
[52:05] Generations down the line what was the
[52:08] story they're told what was the main
[52:10] point was it the star the star was not
[52:14] the main event that's right so what was
[52:17] the main event what was the main point
[52:20] of the story of their testimony that
[52:23] they told after going and finding the
[52:25] truth behind behind the sign it was
[52:29] Christ they didn't they they are now
[52:33] possessors of the truth the sign brought
[52:36] them to the star was not the main
[52:40] event Christ was the main event so then
[52:43] when they went out and they told the
[52:44] testimony of this star that they
[52:46] followed they had to talk about the star
[52:48] because it brought them to it but what
[52:50] did they talk what did they go on and on
[52:52] and on about and what did they say oh
[52:54] you should have been there you should
[52:55] have seen it we heard this this this
[52:57] this and this it was all about that
[53:00] boy the Messiah
[53:03] Emmanuel the star was pushed to the side
[53:06] once you got to the main point of the
[53:09] story right it was simply what brought
[53:13] them to
[53:16] Christ amen they they they they they
[53:19] they followed the
[53:21] star and when they discovered
[53:24] Christ they didn't they're Obsession was
[53:27] no longer around the star amen their
[53:30] Obsession was around Christ
[53:34] amen Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it
[53:38] is impossible to please him for he that
[53:40] cometh to God must believe that he is
[53:43] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[53:45] diligently seek Him amen
[53:49] amen he is a rewarder of them that
[53:52] diligently seek him what was one key
[53:54] ingredient
[53:56] that the wise men
[53:58] possessed they un they were
[54:02] unwavered you think they met obstacles
[54:05] in the way
[54:06] absolutely absolutely you think when
[54:09] they told their testimony there was
[54:11] people that didn't believe them says oh
[54:13] we can well we can look in the
[54:15] chronicles of of Jerusalem um for all
[54:18] the babies that were born in Bethlehem
[54:20] and they were all killed by Herod so
[54:23] there's
[54:24] that well no because Joseph and Mary
[54:28] escaped
[54:30] Bethlehem so there was people who came
[54:32] and and and and and unconvinced some of
[54:35] the people they testified to that's
[54:37] right there's people that came along
[54:39] with their own idea and said well you
[54:41] know the start didn't really
[54:42] happen because you know these planets
[54:45] they can't come together like that it
[54:47] doesn't happen right I don't know prove
[54:50] me wrong I don't think it's happened
[54:51] since May
[54:53] maybe so this isn't no that those guys
[54:56] were just few old few crazy old guys
[55:00] okay yeah
[55:02] no they they they had to face
[55:04] persecution they faced Critics on the
[55:07] way there and afterwards when they
[55:09] shared their
[55:10] experience and they faced obstacles you
[55:13] will face obstacles you will come to
[55:16] things that
[55:18] um let's be honest make you think about
[55:21] what you're doing with your life yeah
[55:24] there is never ever this you know you
[55:27] will never leave the truth as a true son
[55:29] and daughter of God do you think what's
[55:32] going on where am I what am I
[55:35] doing when they were crossing the desert
[55:38] and the winds were blowing 100 miles an
[55:40] hour what am I doing I could be back in
[55:43] Babylon or wherever it was taking a milk
[55:47] bath instead I'm in the middle of the
[55:49] Sahara getting blasted by sand why I I I
[55:53] have enough money I don't need to be out
[55:55] here doing this but something would stir
[55:58] within their heart say don't you want to
[56:01] know what it's all about there was
[56:04] something that drove you to find out
[56:06] what is this all about but there's one
[56:10] difference
[56:11] between people that saw the
[56:15] star and the wise men there's a
[56:18] difference between you and the people
[56:21] that saw the sign and just said there's
[56:23] a sign and they talked about a sign and
[56:26] tell that sign failed them right so to
[56:30] speak because unless you could not tell
[56:35] you could not tell the wise
[56:38] men they didn't see a messiah that's
[56:41] right there was you couldn't do it you
[56:45] you could try your best but you can't
[56:48] could not tell them they never saw
[56:50] nothing they never saw anything excuse
[56:52] me because they met him face face to
[56:57] face and the Bible says they fell on the
[56:59] ground and worshiped him so they knew
[57:01] who he
[57:02] was they brought gold and frankincense
[57:04] and myrh they knew who this young man
[57:08] was this young boy at the
[57:11] time we don't know maybe they came back
[57:14] years later maybe maybe news traveled up
[57:17] the Nile and and you know across the
[57:19] desert and they heard of this man named
[57:22] Jesus who caused a Ruckus in Jerusalem
[57:25] and the surrounding area and was
[57:27] eventually hung on the cross and then
[57:29] everyone claimed he rose from the dead
[57:31] news like that
[57:32] travels they probably heard of that they
[57:36] said we knew we met him we saw him he
[57:41] changed their life why because he was a
[57:43] manifestation of the interpretation of
[57:46] scripture Before Their
[57:49] Eyes God interprets his scripture Man by
[57:52] bringing it to pass he brought the
[57:55] scripture in Isa 7:14 to pass right
[57:58] before their eyes you could not tell
[58:01] them they had not found truth they had
[58:05] been Seekers of Truth and then when they
[58:09] came to the place of of of that
[58:13] interpretation they were now possessors
[58:16] of that truth amen footsteps is
[58:19] possession the Israel the children of
[58:21] Israel were given a Promised
[58:24] Land but
[58:27] only 12 Spies went across Jordan 10 of
[58:30] them couldn't believe what they saw they
[58:32] couldn't accept Victory but there were
[58:34] two that did but those two could do
[58:36] nothing to convince those that didn't
[58:38] see it with their eyes of its
[58:44] truths but the but Caleb and Joshua had
[58:47] a revelation that they could possess it
[58:49] so there is even some that come across
[58:53] Jordan so to speak in the
[58:56] naturally and they experience this
[58:59] things and they go away saying yeah but
[59:02] it's it's it's it's a bunch of Lies
[59:05] Moses said this this this this this and
[59:07] and we there's no way nobody can do that
[59:10] nobody can live that nobody can fulfill
[59:13] that well where is all these things that
[59:15] need to to come to pass and so please
[59:19] don't think I am coming at anyone or
[59:21] trying to make a
[59:24] defense the shamed truth needs no
[59:27] defense from man that's
[59:30] right simply relaying history because
[59:33] history repeats itself amen and we
[59:36] should be encouraged tonight by the
[59:38] desire we have to continue to seek for
[59:42] truth because you cannot seek for truth
[59:44] until he Our Savior Our Father our
[59:48] husband is seeking after
[59:51] us there are truths about you he is
[59:54] seeking out
[59:56] amen he is he is pulling from within you
[1:00:02] the unimaginable amen he is pulling from
[1:00:05] you the ability to say you know what I'm
[1:00:08] sorry you're right into the face of an
[1:00:10] angry person he's pulling from within
[1:00:13] you the ability to stand strong against
[1:00:16] the critics he's pulling from within you
[1:00:20] amen the truths that you didn't even
[1:00:22] know about
[1:00:24] yourself and what is
[1:00:27] oh it's amazing it's him that's right he
[1:00:31] is pulling himself out of you and when I
[1:00:34] say pulling I mean manifesting himself
[1:00:37] on the outward of you because you were
[1:00:39] called and predestinated to this
[1:00:42] position so guess what you followed the
[1:00:45] sign you followed the star you found the
[1:00:47] truth now guess what you're the sign
[1:00:49] amen right the wise men now carried the
[1:00:53] truth with them and they were out as a
[1:00:55] sign to that truth saying this is what
[1:00:59] we saw this is what we experienced amen
[1:01:01] this is what the Revelation and the
[1:01:04] interpretation of these
[1:01:06] scriptures amen now a sign sign is an
[1:01:10] object quality or event whose presence
[1:01:12] or occurrence indicates a probable
[1:01:14] presence or occurrence of something else
[1:01:17] so it just means a sign tells you of
[1:01:19] something else so even the very
[1:01:22] definition of sign does not say I you
[1:01:25] have have
[1:01:27] arrived I am it that's not even the def
[1:01:30] definition of the English word
[1:01:35] sign praise the
[1:01:38] Lord the only reason the wise men would
[1:01:41] have gone away talking about the
[1:01:44] sign
[1:01:46] okay the only reason the wise men would
[1:01:48] have left back home and just had a
[1:01:52] testimony about the star and the sign
[1:01:55] would have been they never ever met
[1:01:57] Jesus that's
[1:01:59] right you can't follow something to a
[1:02:03] place and returned not talking about
[1:02:05] that
[1:02:06] place especially when you go through
[1:02:08] what they went
[1:02:09] through the only way is if they would
[1:02:12] have gone all that way and never found
[1:02:15] anything then they would have gone away
[1:02:17] talking about the sign and all so you
[1:02:19] have people in our day that we're living
[1:02:22] in around the message around the world
[1:02:27] in denominational churches that have
[1:02:28] followed
[1:02:31] signs but never found the truth behind
[1:02:35] it that's right a they never got a
[1:02:38] revelation of the truth of the sign the
[1:02:41] sign was pointing to something they
[1:02:43] followed it they went to it but they
[1:02:45] never found
[1:02:47] truth know the truth and the truth s
[1:02:51] shall set you free without Revelation
[1:02:55] the sign is the main event that's
[1:03:00] right guess what these signs out here on
[1:03:04] the side of the road they come and go
[1:03:07] right they fulfill their purpose they're
[1:03:10] taken down the road construction ahead
[1:03:12] sign doesn't stay there when the road's
[1:03:14] finished amen it goes away and you don't
[1:03:18] go man I I can't drive down this road I
[1:03:21] don't have a sign I is there road
[1:03:23] construction up ahead how am I supposed
[1:03:24] to know there's no sign
[1:03:27] yeah just follow the
[1:03:30] road nothing against my sister growing
[1:03:32] up though I would say you know hey you
[1:03:35] know you can get to such such a place if
[1:03:37] if you just go down let go this you'll
[1:03:39] see it but where do I turn you you'll
[1:03:42] just drive down the road you'll see it
[1:03:43] no you have to tell me where I turn how
[1:03:45] many miles I have to go or which street
[1:03:47] I need to turn right on or what color
[1:03:48] the building is just go you'll see it
[1:03:51] she couldn't do
[1:03:53] that just the way her brain works
[1:03:58] but when you can follow after Christ
[1:04:01] with faith and he says hey just just
[1:04:03] take this
[1:04:05] scripture uh in Acts chap 2:38 repent
[1:04:08] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:04:10] Christ and you will receive the Holy
[1:04:12] Spirit well well how will I how will I
[1:04:13] How will I know what's truth and and I I
[1:04:16] believe this scripture but but how will
[1:04:17] I how will I understand the rest of it
[1:04:19] where where will I turn don't worry just
[1:04:21] drive down the road don't worry just
[1:04:23] walk down the path guess what what in
[1:04:26] the Pilgrim's Progress when when um
[1:04:28] forget his name when he came to every
[1:04:30] every uh obstacle on his journey there
[1:04:33] was signs pointing him in the right
[1:04:34] direction he didn't have to worry about
[1:04:36] figuring out every step all the way down
[1:04:39] the road and riding it all down on a big
[1:04:41] sheet of paper he just had to walk and
[1:04:44] when he came to those places you come to
[1:04:46] places in your life a scripture now
[1:04:48] means something totally different than
[1:04:49] it did before because there's a truth
[1:04:52] within there that God is bringing out to
[1:04:54] show you and point you down the road but
[1:04:56] if you have the faith and the revelation
[1:04:58] of the sign amen you can trust the truth
[1:05:01] behind it and you can trust that God is
[1:05:04] pointing you in the right
[1:05:07] direction sometimes sometimes uh praise
[1:05:10] the
[1:05:13] Lord these um man-made signs that we
[1:05:16] have these man-made maps that we have
[1:05:18] sometimes don't always take you down the
[1:05:19] right
[1:05:21] Road they get you lost they get you
[1:05:24] confused but there's one thing that's
[1:05:26] that is true about God's
[1:05:32] word is
[1:05:35] that he will always steer you straight
[1:05:38] any confusion your you are experiencing
[1:05:41] is because somehow you mixed something
[1:05:43] with your Humanity right you said this
[1:05:46] is
[1:05:48] impossible or I don't understand it God
[1:05:52] doesn't need your understanding that's
[1:05:53] right God will show you in due time if
[1:05:56] you'll still stay faithful and just keep
[1:05:59] following the star I don't know how long
[1:06:01] their Journey take but let's say it was
[1:06:03] it was a couple of years because we know
[1:06:06] he was about two years old when they
[1:06:07] found
[1:06:09] him do you think about 9 months in they
[1:06:12] were like man are we ever going to get
[1:06:14] to the place where the star actually is
[1:06:16] where the star is pointing us
[1:06:20] to how do I stay this when when your six
[1:06:26] okay five do we have how many senses do
[1:06:28] we have five five thank you when your
[1:06:32] five senses tell you you need to give up
[1:06:35] or this isn't possible you have to tap
[1:06:39] into Faith amen and faith comes by
[1:06:42] Revelation that's the six sense thank
[1:06:44] you that's why I was thinking we had six
[1:06:46] senses praise God brother Chris can't
[1:06:49] count that's all
[1:06:50] right um praise the Lord
[1:06:55] so they saw the Fulfillment of the
[1:06:58] scripture therefore the Lord himself
[1:06:59] shall give you a sign behold the Virgin
[1:07:01] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[1:07:04] call his name
[1:07:06] Emmanuel they saw the
[1:07:08] interpretation of
[1:07:11] scripture they had faith that they would
[1:07:14] find that the truth of that sign now the
[1:07:19] Paradox like I said is this scripture
[1:07:21] for the son of man has come to seek and
[1:07:23] to save that which is which was lost he
[1:07:28] he doesn't even say is lost he says was
[1:07:32] why because you were found
[1:07:35] before the Virgin ever heard the message
[1:07:37] from the angel you were found before the
[1:07:40] foundation of the world but God had to
[1:07:43] come and fulfill scripture in your life
[1:07:46] in the day and age that he called you to
[1:07:49] be
[1:07:51] in as a child of God forever seek
[1:07:58] truth you can seek truth in reading your
[1:08:01] Bible you can seek truth in listening to
[1:08:03] the message you can seek truth in prayer
[1:08:06] you need all three of those things
[1:08:07] actually to seek truth but you must
[1:08:10] never stop amen the children of Israel
[1:08:14] stopped they got to a very big
[1:08:17] obstacle the the the amalaki or the
[1:08:19] jebusites and all them Jericho all those
[1:08:22] the Giants in the promised land they got
[1:08:24] to an obstacle and they stop seeking
[1:08:27] truth and they they all died in the
[1:08:30] wilderness but Joshua and Caleb they
[1:08:33] were ten Tena tenacious
[1:08:37] Seekers they sought
[1:08:40] truth they they they they defended truth
[1:08:44] they they stepped out from the promised
[1:08:46] land and to the children of Israel they
[1:08:48] said it doesn't matter what these guys
[1:08:50] say trust me this is exactly what God
[1:08:52] said it would be it is the Fulfillment
[1:08:55] of what we have
[1:08:57] heard amen so be a tenacious Seeker know
[1:09:01] the truth for the truth shall set you
[1:09:04] free that's now guess what there's one
[1:09:07] ingredient the world the world in the
[1:09:09] secular world there's a saying you know
[1:09:10] always ask the question why you know
[1:09:12] don't be confined to a bathtub the
[1:09:14] problem with their ideology is it's
[1:09:16] partially true amen always ask why all
[1:09:20] press and find the answers to what is in
[1:09:23] your heart but guess what sometimes the
[1:09:24] answer is wait amen that's when you
[1:09:28] don't understand something about the
[1:09:30] scriptures or about the message the
[1:09:32] answer is not turn aside and go look
[1:09:34] somewhere else I can tell you right now
[1:09:36] there is no other truth outside of the
[1:09:39] word of God what happens when you come
[1:09:41] to something you do not understand see
[1:09:43] what happens is people focus on that
[1:09:46] that's all they think about and they're
[1:09:48] consumed with this question and they
[1:09:50] think because of this one question all
[1:09:53] the other truths surrounding that must
[1:09:55] be
[1:09:57] false well they don't even know the
[1:09:59] answer to it yet but because they don't
[1:10:01] know the answer you know there must not
[1:10:03] be an answer and the rest of it must not
[1:10:05] be true but if you'll stay the
[1:10:07] course God will show you the children of
[1:10:10] Israel uh Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:10:14] did not discover the truth until they
[1:10:16] stepped into the
[1:10:17] fire right they had to first first step
[1:10:23] in by faith
[1:10:26] into the very thing their five senses
[1:10:29] said said do not do you will die but
[1:10:32] once they stepped into the
[1:10:34] fire they had a shouting Jubilee yeah
[1:10:38] they come out not even smelling like
[1:10:39] smoke sometimes you're standing there on
[1:10:42] the edge wondering should I step into
[1:10:45] the
[1:10:46] fire the word of God says the Holy Ghost
[1:10:49] is a con all consuming fire
[1:10:52] amen the devil's saying you don't want
[1:10:55] to go in there you'll die he's right
[1:10:58] right you will die you'll dial to
[1:11:01] yourself you have to surrender because
[1:11:04] that those three boys were fully
[1:11:07] surrendered to God in order to step into
[1:11:10] that fire you have to be willing to say
[1:11:13] God I don't understand
[1:11:17] why but I know you won't fail me amen so
[1:11:23] if I perish I perish but I'm going to
[1:11:26] see the king if you perish you perish
[1:11:30] but step into that fire and find out for
[1:11:33] yourself because once you do you could
[1:11:35] not tell Shadrach Meek and Abednego that
[1:11:39] uh they survived the fire they didn't
[1:11:41] survived the fire you couldn't tell them
[1:11:43] that you couldn't tell them they didn't
[1:11:45] come face to face with god with Jehovah
[1:11:48] in that fire you couldn't tell them
[1:11:49] because they saw it for themselves they
[1:11:52] saw it with their physical eyes the wise
[1:11:54] men saw with their physical eyes but you
[1:11:57] see it with the eyes of faith and the
[1:11:59] Bible says that is a greater
[1:12:02] Miracle when you see the truth for
[1:12:06] yourself Through The Eyes of Faith you
[1:12:09] you have accepted Jesus Christ and
[1:12:12] that's what it means to know him
[1:12:16] personally amen I know I'm probably
[1:12:18] preaching to the choir tonight that's
[1:12:20] good maybe you need to be a
[1:12:23] reminder praise Lord you are an
[1:12:28] unashamed possessor of
[1:12:30] Truth start
[1:12:33] talking past tense like that scripture
[1:12:36] said right you
[1:12:38] are a woman of Faith you are a man of
[1:12:42] Faith you do possess the gates of your
[1:12:45] enemy you have overcome the world you
[1:12:50] have overcome death say I'm sitting here
[1:12:54] in the pew doesn't matter the truth lays
[1:12:58] within you and that truth before you
[1:13:00] were ever born overcame death for
[1:13:05] you you have the ability to stand
[1:13:09] because you have come face to face with
[1:13:11] Revelation but guess what if you haven't
[1:13:13] maybe you're the wise man and he's only
[1:13:15] a year end you're only a year end to
[1:13:18] your two-year
[1:13:19] journey I have one thing for you don't
[1:13:22] leave church don't stop reading your
[1:13:24] Bible don't stop praying even if you're
[1:13:26] not hearing
[1:13:29] anything I have friends who
[1:13:32] said it's not true nothing
[1:13:36] happened but if they would have just
[1:13:38] kept on knocking that's right you're not
[1:13:41] a hypocrite if you sit in church and you
[1:13:43] don't believe
[1:13:45] amen you're not a
[1:13:48] hypocrite keep on seeking the truth
[1:13:53] admit admit you need so you're not a
[1:13:56] hypocrite if you're honest with yourself
[1:13:58] that you don't understand what's going
[1:14:00] on it's not pretending this is the best
[1:14:02] place for you if you're confused this is
[1:14:04] the best place for you if you have doubt
[1:14:07] we're not telling you to leave because
[1:14:09] you don't believe we're telling you to
[1:14:11] stay because God will reveal himself to
[1:14:14] you guess what this in this place
[1:14:16] there's no
[1:14:18] noise in this place there's no con
[1:14:21] there's no other other voices that's
[1:14:24] right
[1:14:25] physically there is the Devil comes to
[1:14:27] church too in this place there is a
[1:14:30] combined power of Jesus Christ because
[1:14:33] of those around you that have accepted
[1:14:36] the truth amen you don't have your fire
[1:14:38] lit that's okay there's fire here keep
[1:14:43] on coming because God will reveal
[1:14:46] himself to you he promised he would
[1:14:49] right and I'm standing here as a
[1:14:51] testimony just like the wise men that I
[1:14:53] have come face to face face with Jesus
[1:14:56] Christ and if he can do it for me he can
[1:14:58] do it for you the worst thing you can do
[1:15:02] is stop coming to
[1:15:04] church praise the
[1:15:09] Lord how okay so how could they talk
[1:15:13] about anything else besides the truth
[1:15:15] they discovered how can you we can't
[1:15:17] stop talking about it amen the truth
[1:15:20] that we have
[1:15:21] discovered praise the Lord know the
[1:15:24] truth and the truth shall set you free
[1:15:27] amen the musicians will come
[1:15:29] tonight praise the
[1:15:34] Lord it was a little bit shorter than
[1:15:37] normal but have you ever read the book
[1:15:40] of Romans yeah there's a sermon in every
[1:15:44] verse that's
[1:15:47] right I read through that book not quite
[1:15:50] once a month but very often because
[1:15:52] there is so much in there so one thing
[1:15:55] tonight to
[1:15:57] remember you are an unashamed possessor
[1:16:01] of
[1:16:02] Truth be a you are a tenacious
[1:16:06] Seeker un tenacious is I've saying that
[1:16:09] wrong I know
[1:16:11] unwavered you you you're un you say well
[1:16:14] I I Stumble go read Hebrews 11
[1:16:17] tonight then go back and read the
[1:16:19] stories of all those people in that
[1:16:22] chapter and it's full of their mistakes
[1:16:25] but in that chapter when the Holy Ghost
[1:16:28] through the pen of Paul testifies of
[1:16:31] their life what does it say by faith
[1:16:33] Abraham by faith Noah it's a positive
[1:16:37] confession because what God doesn't look
[1:16:39] at your Humanity if he did no one would
[1:16:42] be saved but God looks at the testimony
[1:16:46] of the truth that is within your heart
[1:16:49] that's what he cares about cuz guess
[1:16:51] what you say how can he how can he rely
[1:16:53] his how can he base his his
[1:16:56] understanding of me off of my the truth
[1:16:58] in my heart though the outward would
[1:16:59] betray that sometimes because he knows
[1:17:01] if that truth is in your heart the
[1:17:03] outward will come right into line with
[1:17:06] that truth in your heart and he doesn't
[1:17:07] have to worry about it it's like
[1:17:10] somebody say you say say you you see
[1:17:12] somebody they got a broken down car but
[1:17:15] you know they have $100,000 sitting in
[1:17:16] the bank account you don't worry about
[1:17:18] them they've got the money they need to
[1:17:20] repurchase a new car if they so desire
[1:17:22] God doesn't worry what the outside you
[1:17:25] looks like because the truth within you
[1:17:27] amen will change the outside God doesn't
[1:17:29] worry about your negative confession
[1:17:31] because he knows a positive confession
[1:17:33] of the word into you will bring forth
[1:17:35] the right words from your mouth amen God
[1:17:38] looks at the desires of your heart thank
[1:17:41] the Lord for that thank the Lord that's
[1:17:43] God's Almighty Grace amen so when you
[1:17:46] hear about people and and everything and
[1:17:48] I I'm not trying to bring this up to be
[1:17:50] the dead
[1:17:51] horse but this is just the world we live
[1:17:54] in this is is what's happening around us
[1:17:56] and so we speak about what's relevant if
[1:17:59] you hearing voices that are contrary to
[1:18:01] what you're hearing here or to what
[1:18:03] you're hearing in the scriptures or what
[1:18:04] you're hearing from the
[1:18:06] message just look at their lives amen
[1:18:10] does their life testify truth amen do do
[1:18:15] do does what they talk about does what
[1:18:17] they they is there approach line up with
[1:18:21] the word of God and that's easy to find
[1:18:23] just go read a story or about the men of
[1:18:25] faith in the Bible and ask yourself do
[1:18:27] they line up with that praise the Lord I
[1:18:30] don't that was that was free that just
[1:18:32] came out of nowhere praise the
[1:18:35] Lord amen I feel like I'm repeating
[1:18:38] myself having a hard time stopping here
[1:18:40] maybe you get youall are
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:44] pulling maybe of course you
[1:18:47] are praise the
[1:18:50] Lord amen I'm looking forward to one of
[1:18:52] these days
[1:18:55] not even having to worry about all this
[1:18:57] stuff just go walk the streets of
[1:19:01] gold do do you know that that's a
[1:19:06] reality there's a
[1:19:08] theory that we're all in the simulation
[1:19:11] and it's not really
[1:19:14] reality and
[1:19:16] uh you know what's funny about
[1:19:20] that is uh you kind of are a simulation
[1:19:25] of
[1:19:28] Christ and the rest of the world is is
[1:19:31] in
[1:19:33] reality this is not reality brother B
[1:19:36] says this is a negative of the real
[1:19:39] photo this is this is
[1:19:42] not it was in the mind of God yes God
[1:19:45] knew this was going to happen but this
[1:19:47] is not how God intended it to
[1:19:49] be but he's pulling he he's he sent you
[1:19:53] down and he has faith that you'll
[1:19:54] manifest his word and that you'll come
[1:19:56] but but the true reality
[1:19:58] is the other side a perfect uh I don't
[1:20:03] know uh most of you here have been out
[1:20:05] in the woods imagine the most beautiful
[1:20:07] place you've ever been and then times
[1:20:10] that by an Infinity
[1:20:12] number it's that much better on the
[1:20:15] other side I've had the privilege of
[1:20:17] being in some pretty remote places back
[1:20:19] home and you look and you you cannot see
[1:20:22] the touch of man anywhere
[1:20:26] and it it stir you
[1:20:29] up to think you're going to a place that
[1:20:33] is not been touched by
[1:20:36] Humanity but is 100% pure amen and you
[1:20:40] don't have to fight thoughts too
[1:20:41] toothaches headaches migraines
[1:20:44] frustration computer's not working you
[1:20:46] won't need
[1:20:48] them praise the Lord that is going to be
[1:20:50] a reality one day and I and I I pray
[1:20:52] that if you can hold on to one thing to
[1:20:54] tonight if if if you're
[1:20:57] a let's bow our heads if you're if
[1:20:59] you're a young person or an old person
[1:21:01] and there's questions that you are
[1:21:02] stumbling with if you can hold on to one
[1:21:05] reality and that is
[1:21:07] that God is preparing a place for you
[1:21:11] amen and he has faith in you that you
[1:21:14] will overcome the world sometimes do you
[1:21:18] know sometimes what you have
[1:21:22] is what you what you need is already
[1:21:25] within you sometimes you just have to
[1:21:28] convince yourself of it so start
[1:21:30] confessing positive I am a daughter of
[1:21:32] God I am a Son of God I am an overcomer
[1:21:36] stop confessing that many times the
[1:21:38] devil convinces you that you're still
[1:21:40] Bound by a spirit when actually God has
[1:21:42] set you free but your abil inability to
[1:21:45] accept that Deliverance is causing you
[1:21:48] to stumble remember fear is a liar
[1:21:51] anything that tells you contrary to the
[1:21:53] word of God is a lie but God has said
[1:21:57] you are able you are faithful you are an
[1:22:01] unashamed possessor of the truth you see
[1:22:03] unashamed I I can't even pray in public
[1:22:06] doesn't matter within you is the ability
[1:22:09] to stand unashamed for God dear Lord
[1:22:11] Jesus what a chopped up thing tonight
[1:22:13] Lord I pray none of my own words came
[1:22:15] out my own opinions but Lord it was
[1:22:17] completely entirely you you had
[1:22:19] something to say tonight and Lord we can
[1:22:21] say oh maybe it was a simple sermon but
[1:22:23] that's that doesn't matter if it's
[1:22:25] simple or if it's complex or if it's
[1:22:27] high or if it's low all that matters is
[1:22:29] that your words were spoken tonight Lord
[1:22:32] I trust and I have faith that Lord that
[1:22:34] was so delivered to your people I pray
[1:22:36] Lord the hearts that were touched I I
[1:22:38] don't know I may never know Lord but
[1:22:41] father you know and that's all that
[1:22:43] matters I don't get up here to minister
