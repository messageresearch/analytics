sanctuary [Music] every four what a privilege amen what a blessing God has given us that we can today stand with the acknowledgment and God wants us to actually be confident enough to acknowledge and say I am his Sanctuary amen not just say well if I was worthy if I could this if I could that stand with confidence to say and say God chose me to fill this position and if he chose me to fill this position then I will be able to amen I don't have to go through life it's almost like a complex Saints but it's like Satan has has kind of fooled us that we could go through life going well I would do something for the Lord if I was worthy if I could if I had anything to offer but the word says he's given us a voice amen we can offer our voice to him the word says that he's given us hands to be lifted to praise him we can just lift our hands and fulfill the word of God and his feet amen have come into our feet and he says if we could just walk in the way of righteousness that he would be with us so let's just walk and you'll find the word says that he would lead us and guide us into all truth amen so it's not like I've got to search this out I've got to find this I've got to just let him have his way I've got to just give myself and let God's will be done in me I say God bless you to each and every one amen so good to see each and every one of you today amen it's so good to have brother Adrian and his family it's uh it's a straighter God bless you your lovely children's you know it's just uh it's just a real privilege God lets us be a part of this great family um just bring greetings to you from Brother Abel masonga I don't know I think I posted it my week's been a whirlwind Saints amen I it's on WhatsApp okay I just haven't been feeling well and I thank you all for your prayers I think they called it delirium and you just get up in the morning and you just say I would call in I told sister Jerry if I had anybody to call I would call in sick today but there's no one to call so we just got up and and I believe it was the prayer of the Saints you've just held me in the presence of God and given us strength and we're feeling much better so I services on Saturday and Sunday with brother Abel we might have a Saturday night service so November 4 and 5 is what we'll tentatively announce right now and um just visiting with brother Andrew Glover this morning uh just for a few minutes and uh uh just bring greetings to you from Brother Andrew I've been thinking about him a lot lately and just this morning he he sent me a message and we message back and forth and bring greetings to you from Brother Andrew amen I want to speak to you this morning on the measure of trust we've been looking at all these different measures that God has given to us yes thank you musicians a lovely song service today amen God's given us many many majors my brother and sister and the beauty of it is is God knows exactly how much we now we can sit here and say if I just had and I know this sometimes sounds redundant but I believe God lays it on her heart because it's still necessary to be heard we say if I had more faith I'm sorry God has given you the measure of faith oh you know I I seem to fall down and make mistakes God's given you a measure of Grace and when we totally bomb it he's given us a measure of Mercy that is sufficient my brother and sister we wouldn't call ourselves Christians if we didn't think that the blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient amen that should in itself give us enough confidence to just press forward and to take the promises of God I have an interesting way I want to preach to you today very very lengthy 22 verses Isaac 36 1-22 and we're only drawing a principle out of this story it's not really so much about this story as it is that we recognize the Satan has always used the same tactics he modifies it the age but he is not coming up with a whole new story because you see what worked in the first church age for the devil worked in the second and worked in the third the fourth the fifth the sixth and now we're coming to a showdown you ever really thought about what a showdown is it is the grand finale there will not be a showdown Beyond this my brother and sister the grand finale now we realize when we go in the Millennium and then Satan is loosed again that there's going to be chaos pardon me for speaking this way but it will be hell on Earth a great chaos will come upon the Earth at that time and my brother and sister my heart aches for everyone who has been uh lackadaisical has been uh calloused has been uh non-committed to be in that day to have to face that chaos you know I I read a lovely little bit of history of a family that did tremendous amount of work they went as spies and Couriers to to help in World War II a family of Jewish descent and um they were living in Austria and one day the grandfather says we should leave and they said why life is still good it's not us they're after and the Grandfather said we should leave and it's a story about how this family and the persecution they suffered and to his dying breath the Grandfather said we should have listened to God's voice and left I'm I'm leaving Hallelujah I'm leaving he's called us to leave he's asked us to get ready to leave he's asked us to unpack and then repack amen and I want to listen to that voice because I don't want to be as it were living in the ghetto of laodicea saying I wished I would have listened hmm Isaiah 36 and 1 we'll read a few portions of scripture and then we'll be seated now it came to pass in the 14th year of King Hezekiah and somebody who has good English and Annunciation can go ahead and just speak out if you please uh I I don't even I honestly I don't even know if I attempt to read these because you know when we went to Israel there were certain things that I thought oh this is this is the name of this and then somebody local or the guide would say now we're in the blah blah and I'm like that's not what that says but he's local you take it like Colorado Salida the town of Salida south of Denver is it Salida Salida if you're from Idaho it's Salida so Lord help us Lord help us so I'm going to totally mispronounce these but I've asked for grace and mercy already okay now came to pass in the 14th year of King Hezekiah The Sinner here of king of Assyria came up against all the defense cities of Judah and took them in other words their defense was not sufficient my I'm defending myself praise God I'm sorry our defenses are not sufficient and the king of Assyria sent RAB shika to lock ish to Jerusalem and to King Hezekiah with a great Army and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the Fuller's field then came forth unto him elikum he'll tie his son which is over the house and shebna the Scribe and joa asked for his son the recorder and Reb Sheikh if I don't pronounce them the same each time you'll understand how I'm struggling said unto them say ye now to Hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of Assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trust us and I'm telling you my brother and sister the devil today is going to come to you and say you are trusting in what is this that you are putting your confidence in you are facing the same trial today that you faced last week last month last year what do you have your confidence in well I'll tell you my brother and sister the time comes that God says you know what you've stood you believed you stood solid you didn't turn and run you didn't doubt and today is the day I want to be standing there on the day that God says and today is the day amen I don't want to have quit yesterday I don't want to have quit this morning I'm going to be standing there even if this flesh is still and it will be our greatest in I say us now but they are but vain words I have counsel and strength for war now on whom Dost thou trust that thou rebellist against me Heavenly Father we ask for your blessings Lord lead us and guide us I pray in your precious name amen you may be seated Saints you know how isn't The Devil and the devil said that to you you know why do you try why do you keep pushing back why do you think that you can stand in this day and you can be an overcoming Christian in this day when you have failed so many times my brother and sister we stand today and believe that we are the Overcomers and declare that not because we are self-set it but Christ in US made the Declaration that we're the Overcomer of the age and so as we stand here the devil certainly is going to come and ask you why why do you even try why don't you just give in why don't you just be like everyone else because I am not you are not like everyone else amen and we recognize that what God has done and given to you and I while our flesh fails us but it's the promise of God that we live in and live for amen it is not going to be that we'll stand on the streets of glory and be able to say you know I was a really special guy I did this and I did that the only thing we'll be able to say is I just surrendered I just went and gave myself to the Lord and said whatever Lord you desire to use me for if I am as the prophet showed us if I'm going to be the janitor I want to be a good janitor if I'm going to be he said if you're going to be a bum never work a day in your life amen I'm telling you my brother and sister most of us we broke that way when we were children amen God don't want bums amen God doesn't want a bunch of people that are just lazy it's there that we realize that God has come and we have something in us that clearly identifies us as different as children as young people we strive and try so hard to fit in and God says I don't want you to fit in I want you to stand out amen because when you stand out then the light is shining when you stand out the gospel is alive in your community amen Hallelujah Lo thou trust us in the staff of this broken Reed on Egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and Pierce it so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him that's one portion I can say Amen you start trusting Pharaoh my brother and sister and he's going to pierce you and he's going to bring grief to you he's going to do all of these things but God used Pharaoh amen and if there's a pharaoh in your world today don't sit there and curse that but you sit back and say God did you place this Pharaoh in my life for a purpose and God does knew nothing my brother and sister for vanity does nothing in vain he is there whatever it is you say but man this guy my boss persecutes me well fulfill the scripture and say thank you sir you're fulfilling the word of God Amen he might persecute you worse for it but I'll tell you somebody's going to fulfill that word and we can't have everybody pampering us amen not everybody can just make us the star employee or the star personality someone's going to persecute you and I'll tell you what God will do he will use the common every day to cause you and I to get desperate to get out of here but not to get out of here for getting out of here's sake but to get out of their presence into his presence amen that's what it's all about not just a oh Lord give me a better life amen oh I'll tell you I want a better life because I have eternal life I know I have better life and I want to go right back to the source of eternal life because that's where we came from amen and so it's there oh my brother and sister I tell you God is good to us but if thou say to me we trust in the Lord our God is it not he whose high places and whose altar Hezekiah has taken away now let me just throw a little history in here remember before God comes and shows great Mercy on Hezekiah that Hezekiah had got lifting up he he had come to a place as a king that he'd made so many good Investments he had made so many good decisions he had he had fulfilled you might say in the natural many many good things and had come to a place that he himself in the mirror had looked and thought you know what I'm a great king and God said you know what I know your heart deep down Hezekiah even more so which is an interesting thing of the world we live in today my brother and sister that people are saying well we believe God meant this people who don't know their own mind are saying this is what God meant no my brother and sister what we do is sit back and say Lord let us have your mind so I can understand Lord not explain you not not counsel you but I could understand what it is that you want from me Lord because I will be what you want me to be Lord because I will surrender to that we trust in the Lord our God is it not he now my brother and sister they're almost being mocked here but if thou say to me we trust in the Lord our God is it not he whose high places whose altars Hezekiah has taken away and said to Judah and to Jerusalem ye shall worship before this worship before this altar now some of this my brother and sister we have to remember that Through the Ages God has always brought a judgment back into Israel when they would start to allow the the worship in the Groves and start to have the things taken as it were now my brother and sister anytime leadership starts to remove all the vessels now catch this it's more of a a parable in a sense but anytime leadership started to remove the vessels from the house of God and put them in storage we got a little storage room right here you know we're going to just start taking the things of God we're going to start taking the hard line of the message and we're gonna not get We're Not Gonna Get rid of it nobody's going to be able to come into Grace and say you guys have got rid of the hard line of the message but what we're storing it here out of sight out of mind God said no I want the vessels of the temple to be in the temple and I want the vessels of the temple to be used as I ordain them to be used I want the word to do the words work I don't need man to replace the words work with their work I want my word to do the work amen and when we allow the word of God to come into the temple and do its work then the temple is Holy the temple is a dwelling place to Almighty and so you know people didn't like that but while Hezekiah being lifted up didn't mean he was a complete departure from the things of God and and that's one of the things that we find confusing and I don't want to get into all kinds of political direction today but my brother and sister you look around the message and you'll say oh this brother quit and that brother quit they in many cases for years still fulfilled the work of God and their own heart was not in it you see God doesn't want us just to fulfill it as a wrote as a letter to do it and check it off but God wants a heart amen he wants a heart that says Lord if you want worship Lord I Will Worship You from the hearts not just uh when the song leader says let's worship god oh yes we're supposed to do that but let it be from My Heart Lord Hallelujah and that's why I just go back and like I said I don't want to delve into that I'm going to go back my brother and sister that's how you see churches that were on fire cooling off tapering away until they're able to tell you their long tradition of being message Believers I don't care about yesterday I don't care about what God did yesterday you're going to say what brother Paul well just follow me I don't care what he did my God's present here today he's alive today he's a Healer today he's a deliverer today he's the word today we don't have to look backwards he's present Hallelujah I hope you don't mind me being excited today whose altars hezekiah's taken away and said to Jude in Jerusalem he shall worship before this altar now therefore give pledges I pray thee to my master the king of Assyria and I will give thee 2 000 horses if thou be able on thine part to set Riders upon them well I'll tell you what my brother and sister if the devil's going to give you a gift he'll give you someone to drive that gift yeah I'm telling you what when the devil decides he's going to give you a lot of money he'll give you a lot of money if he's going to give you Authority he'll give you a lot of authority all the little features you can do that the devil's generous because he don't care whether you deserve it or not because he's never done it for your benefit he's done it for his own my right right you know there's a man that was in Mexico and now in glory worked for the cartels probably made them billions of dollars but what we would seemingly think is impossible that a man in that condition it's maybe a tad bit of speculation to say that he's even responsible for people losing their lives certainly responsible for people losing their lives from overdose and their lives wasted from drugs comes in contact with the Sun and it's there influencing him day after day words that he can't get out of his mind and even as they baptized him his cry was Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost my days are not long less than a week he's dead all the years of faithful service to the king of Assyria didn't earn him one drop of Grace but here are you with me but here's a thief on the cross who just gives acknowledgment to our Lord Jesus Christ and he says this day you know we can theologically argue well Jesus didn't go to paragraph Paradise so how could he be that day with Paradise my brother and sister our Lord Jesus Christ God however you want to turn it is all-encompassing he's everything he's Heaven he's Earth he's everything and he says this day you'll be with me in Paradise with speaking to the soul of a man who had nothing to claim and yet was given Grace see the nature of man and the nature of God one says if you're not sold out to me I'll kill you another one says if you're not sold out to me I'll give you Grace till you realize how desperately you need me amen as we look at this how then will thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master servants and put thy Trust on Egypt for chariots and for Horsemen and am I now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it the Lord said unto me now look at this my brother and sister this is how clever the devil is that we'd often times look at this and say you know what um you know they got no Authority you realize that God gave the devil permission right right and that would discourage some people and say why would God do that well God knew what was in you right I'll tell you what aren't you glad you're a chip off the old block aren't you glad that the very nature of God has been deposited in you you say but if I have the nature of God where's it at well let it out let it out you know if you got the door nailed shut it's not going to come out but if you'll ever have courage enough enough trust in God to start pulling the nails out of the door you will see God do great things in your life and those around you but you know we're kind of afraid I think I think some of the brothers are right we're actually afraid to really see God move in an upper room type experience we're afraid to actually lose control of our self and our emotion because well we don't want to be embarrassed or it might not be the right thing we'll take it through the word first and it will be the right thing amen because if it don't go through the filter it won't reach you and so therefore you can live all that God allows through the filter to reach you you can live that will you live that do you want to live that I say Lord I Want To Live every bit of your word that has come to me I want to live that amen I don't want to be over here filtering what God's already filtered well I don't know about this and I don't know about that run it through the filter let the filter do its work let the Life of Christ in you do its work then you don't have to be a skeptic to everyone that shares anything to you you know it either is the word or it isn't but I'll tell you you know I'll take you back to a little practical natural thing you know oh hey this motor has quit why did it quit it's starved for fuel the fuel filter's plugged let's just eliminate the filter and that eliminates the problem said no mechanic ever because whatever plugged the filter is going to plug the carburetor or the injection pump so we've got some that said you know what the preacher he's clogging up my filter I'm going to eliminate them and then they wonder my brother and sister how it is they went from a fervent burning desire to a fanatic oh I'm sorry that was a little straight isn't it because that's what's happening they're moving from being on fire turning into fanatics amen and it's entirely different a fanatic doesn't have to be on fire a fanatic is just simply a fanatic amen has to have no uh or a rhyme no reason no Foundation it is as they declare it to be so we want to be on fire but we don't want to be fanatics Hallelujah this rate will be here tomorrow so let me go right on down through here and bounce a few of these instead of reading every bit of it so he says you know what it's the Lord that said to me go up against this land destroy it and like I said God gives permission amen he he opened the Hedge he let the devil in to job but he wasn't the least bit you didn't see God creeping around the edge of the head job you could do it job you can do it in fact God almost looked to callous look at old job down there scraping them boils with a pot shard that's my son you're not treating him like a son yes I am because the word says that Jesus learned by the adversity the trials the tests anybody got your exemption card today Hallelujah you can print almost anything off the internet maybe you can find an exemption card but you won't find it in the word amen we're going to be tested the word's going to prove Who We Are so just because it looks like God's allowing this to happen in your life is not God forsaking you it's God proving you it's God saying I'm going to take the layer of your personality I'm going to take the layers of your understanding I'm going to take the layers of your stubborn spirit and I'm going to scrape them away with the pot Shard of the word until we get down to living flesh and I want to be living flesh for God I don't want to be Scar Tissue I don't want to be some callous my brother and sister I want to be living flesh Hallelujah and so it's there what happened we jumped down in the scripture a little bit he said you know hey uh let me speak to them in another language and not the language of the Jews in other words we want another language and let me tell you my brother and sister there's another language has invaded our world and is speaking to people and they're hearing another language it's not God's voice they're hearing it's another voice another language that is being there speaking to them wooing them in a language of laodicea and laodicea has invaded the church laodicea has its voice in the church my brother and sister I'm telling you God help us go back to the original voice go back to the original word we don't need an interpretation of what God meant we need to hear that voice and when we hear that voice we'll know it's his voice because something inside of us says that's my father speaking and I want to be I'll tell you my brother and sister I want to be one God help me I want to become one that when God speaks I stop and say Lord if you said stop I stop and if you say left I'm left you say right I'm right but well what do we do we're kind of like a truck with bad breaks we just roll on and on and on until we come to a stop now what was you saying to me I don't want to get caught up but I got I got so many little real life things that go with this Hallelujah verse 13 he tells them cries with a loud voice the Jewish language it says hear ye the words of the great king of Assyria thus saith the king oh my we got the saith here thus saith the king let not Hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you and I'll read that verse right there and I'm saying praise the Lord that's right there is no way on hezekiah's part he can deliver these people Hezekiah is not able to deliver them but I want you to understand this and I'm not defending the preacher it's God who put that in place not me there's times I think Lord why did you put me there I'm not comfortable here I can't do this Lord but I'm telling you what happens is the devil starts with removing certain voices from our life young people please listen to me for a moment when voices come that tell you everything that is around you everything that God has nurtured in you is a lie it's not the truth come with us you can live free you need to stop because there's never a time you're drawn to hear unless they can cut you off from there and so as they cut you off they can move you into their world and here is a voice saying don't trust Hezekiah he can't deliver you there should have been someone with enough courage in the church to have said that's the truth preacher you can't deliver me oh but neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord see where they were heading it wasn't about whether you could trust Hezekiah or not when they got past Hezekiah they went right to the Lord and said you can't trust him either wow saying the Lord will certainly Deliver Us no my brother and sister the devil don't want you to believe you can be delivered the devil wants you to think that this bondage he's got you wind is permanent it's what you deserve and we're right here under anointings we're right here under influence saying that's the truth that's what I deserve if we're here about deserve let's go home my brother and sister let's just go home because there's not one thing we deserve if we got what we deserve the prophet of God even said that if I got what I deserve he'd send me to hell but I would serve him anyhow amen it's not going to be about what I deserve it's about what God has decided of who you are and what we are and why he has called us is God who said I didn't ask if you were capable I didn't ask if you deserved it I gave it to you as a gift a gift of life amen something he poured out upon us oh my so here he is now he starts to bring up some of these gods that they've allowed you know Israel was just horrible you see evidence when you go tour Israel you see evidence here a guide if he knows his history will point out well this used to be this kind of pagan thing in the woods and that pile of stones over there was this over here and my brother and sister it wasn't like you know uh I'm telling you what you know you go down to Georgia Bible Belt and the devil's just as thick in Georgia as he is anywhere else on the face of the Earth it's the Bible Belt well maybe the devil went to church did you guys see that little statement thing uh you know the devil's a believer but he's not a Christian come on beliefs when God speaks he believes just go study through the scripture I went through the Old Testament just looking at some things and you'll see my brother and sister that the being cast out many times they started to say hey don't don't do this let us we'll leave voluntarily and what did Jesus say to them coming out of the Old Testament the principles coming into the New Testament in the Old Testament they got away with these things in a sense you would say comes to the New Testament now and Jesus says be silent you don't even get a voice what's happening to you demon you are cast out you are bound oh come on I'm sorry but my brother and sister it's about time we quit coming to the point we're gonna have a truce with the devil we're going to try and build our own wall around the devil's wall it's about time we just simply kick him out tell him to shut up and leave amen amen and so what happens they start to kind of through their words mocking and then you know they held their peace they didn't even answer going into verse 21 because the Commandment given to them was answer him not you know sometimes my brother and sister we've been given the answer to the devil's question but we don't even have to speak it how about we just live it how about we just get up and let our answer be our life instead of trying to explain to each and every one oh my brother and sister now I've went so long to get to this point have my sermon I I've taken the time more than half oh my I'm shocked but I want you to just draw out of this and look at this we're besieged in this land that we call America United States there is evil on every hand a lot of drama taking place we got men in high places my brother and sister can't even balance a budget can't even run a country and you recognize that some of these men many of these men were successful and still are successful businessmen that can run multi-million or billion dollar companies can't manage our government why in their business they were just maybe Blessed from their business ability but now they've stepped into a role that God said I've cursed and they can't get it right they can't make the right decision because now they're pushing against the will of God and they will never overcome the will of God and we look and say what's wrong with these people my brother and sister it's really not what's wrong with them they are nothing but Tools in God's hand amen and so God moves him and uses them in a fashion that he desires I had a conversation with a brother here recently and he was going on will the government plan this thing brother Paul and they're doing this this way and they're doing them bringing this around here and I I'm sorry you know we're on the telephone I'm glad he couldn't see me because I was kind of like yeah okay but let me tell you something I'm excited about the word is opening life is coming down the sun is rising and shining on the wheat and bringing her to maturity and she is changing in the presence of the sun that's what I get excited about what some lion cheating heathens doing now I don't care about that he's doing what God called him to do but I know what God called you and I to do and that is to soak up the sun amen draw in the presence of almighty God pull it in and let it bring life to you oh hallelujah amen a lot of drama taking place but I want to ask you is that drama part of your story known sir no sir it's in the start part of a big picture but in your story standing in the presence of almighty God in my wedding gown wrapped in the word moved by the word wooed by the word that's my story that should be your story amen because I'll tell you what your story is God's story as the bride of Christ Our Story my brother and sister is God's story we don't have a separate story I need an identity I want my identity to be in Christ amen I'll tell you it's certainly not a laodicean story I'm just going to be lukewarm and fulfill that part of the story sorry I don't want to belong in that story I want to belong in a story where somebody says wow I got to do something I'm on fire Hallelujah you know what happens when people get on fire everybody else runs gets a bucket of water throws it on him we can't have you on fire somehow that might hurt you well maybe what we ought to do now I'll save this with proper etiquette whatever uh maybe we should just be hugging each other so to speak spiritually let's put it that way until we're all on fire instead of running around with a fire hose in the church you know putting out the fire maybe we should let God's fire now I'm not talking about crazy theatrics my brother and sister watch the video sometime back that somebody you know ended the wonder of the world we live in nobody could have filmed this years ago but now everybody's got a phone there's probably ten thousand versions out there some guy running down the backs of the pews I wonder if they were bolted down or maybe he's truly anointed he'd become weightless well he had to have had the Holy Ghost to done that or worked in the circus for a season my brother and sister I had a conversation with a man yesterday called me up started off strange I won't give all the details Anyway said he had a need your church I need money okay that's straightforward enough what's your situation I got injured I've lost my job well he lost his job a long time ago I said well you know there's workman's comp uh there's unemployment there's all this stuff oh but the Lord led me and now I get goosebumps every time the Holy Spirit meets it I meet somebody and I get goosebumps I know that's God and I says well how do you know that a priest told me so now I'm not mocking this man I he was absolute sincere a priest told me that's what the evidence of the Holy Spirit was when I get these Goosebumps and I've been getting more and more and more of them I said have you ever run that through the word huh said no that's how you know if that's true you run it through the word have you taken it back to the word what does the word say Amen well let me tell you about this guy I met at a gas station no no no here draw you back that guy at the gas station got nothing to do with our conversation I said now our church is willing to help you you come to church today I don't think it's wrong to put a caveat on it is it Saints you come to church today and if you can endure preaching today and still be here when it's over we'll help you but he wasn't interested he was looking for a handout so he could drive around and share his version of what the evidence of the Holy Ghost was my brother and sister it's interesting world we live in now look at this I've got to hurry along here somebody say brother Paul hurry amen see now look we you know this is depending on the verbiage how you do it but uh we all look in the word of God in the Haven of Rest right do you realize my brother and sister we have a natural Haven of Rest amen and God called it for our homes right you just go back and and look what how brother Branham lays this out he lays the groundwork that with a token applied on her home that it becomes our Haven of Rest in the natural our security that we can move into and with the blood on our home on our lives then Satan cannot get under the blood right he can't come into the blood our home natural becomes a Haven of Rest to us but that's not sufficient we have to have a spiritual Haven that we can Retreat into as it were in the time of great trial we can come and as it was the scriptures talking about the eagle in the wilderness we have a refuge in the wilderness of laodicea that we can go into and that becomes a Haven of Rest for you and I and the onslaught as the prophet of God taught us it's uh this age you know the greatest mind battle my brother and sister if you don't have a Haven to retreat to in the onslaught of the devil in this day it will cause you to go crazy and I'm sorry to put it that blunt but it's the truth if we're gonna go into the Haven of laodicea then it will take us to the alleys and highways and byways and it will turn us into junk but God has a refuge for us amen now this is going to be another part of another sermon but I felt led to include this my brother and sister Satan knows you're in the land he can read the word of God just as well as anyone can read the word of God just as it was in the days of Herod and they knew that there was a Christ child in the land and herod's solution was to go and just start killing the children that's what we're going to do we're gonna kill the children and surely we'll get this Christ child if we can kill enough children and I'm telling you this world you look out here I'm going to be bold this morning we have a flaunting of young women as prostitutes do they arrest them and prosecute the people doing that no they have whole fashion line for them they have a whole out that for them what is that the devil says if I can kill the children maybe I could kill the last anointed ordained seed of God if I can catch him I could kill that and bind the whole program of God but what he doesn't know is there is a refuge there is a refuge and in the time of adversity he raises up a wall and protects you and I it's not a refuge of the mountain it's not Refuge of the desert it's a refuge of the Holy Ghost In You and I and people say I'm concerned about whether we can be deceived get the Holy Ghost you can't be deceived oh my brothers and sister you see what it is he knows on one side a direct assault against you and he's doing his best to come and antagonistic and send Spirits against you but it's there my brother and sister a direct assault of the word that's in you prophet of God when they said Oh Brother Brahma these thoughts he says just don't let the bird build the nest right right I don't even feel like I have the Holy Ghost brother Brown I have these knock the nest off knock the nest off replace it replace it with something else the word what a lovely replacement it's free it's everywhere yeah my you can't exhaust it you can't run out wow you see Satan knows there's a bride in the land you say well that's obvious that's obvious brother Paul no it's really not because you realize what we sometimes get callous enough that we don't even acknowledge the fact that some things we say and do aren't pleasing to God right if I could put it this simple it just that's right right over our head now I say that not condemning but when the devil sees that knowing how holy God is how pure God is and they just did this and said that and thought that they might not be the bride you see it's not so cut and dried to the devil either he's looking and saying they're making mistakes a righteous God of judgment you see the devil doesn't know what Grace is because he never repented and to know Grace you have to repent repentance is the key that unlocks Grace in our life Satan does not know Grace and so he's just decided I'll just kill a whole society around the whole world every nation every Kindred tongue because he read the book and said God's going to pull him out of every nation Kindred tongue I'll just kill him slaughter them wholesale but spirits of lust and pride and envy and alcohol and drugs and all the minor things that go with all of that and I'll just kill him wholesale because I've got to get the last one I've got to get the anointed one my brother and sister you realize if you're in Christ you're the anointed one right amen anointed to receive the word anointed to live the word you say oh you're replacing him no I'm not we're taking that anointing we're anointed to fulfill that position so we're the anointed one for the position that God called us to and my brother and sister the devil wants to kill you so you can't fulfill that position amen I think you guys did agree with me this morning the undermining of man's confidence in God is incredible talking to an individual here just very recently I just kind of put it out not flippantly but I just kind of put it out he said well you know this and this happened Paul and and uh I said wow and I made a comment to him and he says well you know I used to go to church and pray maybe it's good getting old and bold or I don't care you know I'm going to tell on you young people now the young adults I'm like now if I get boring and stuff you guys have to tell me and they all just and I thought I think they're telling me something but you get to a point it's like I just told her I said why'd you stop oh well there was this it don't matter what they did sorry Saints I know you guys probably think I'm a nice cultured guy but out there work boots dirt grease mud cow stuff I said you're gonna go to hell with them because that's what they did you want to go to hell with them well no really wow the priest told me the poop Goosebumps worth a sign I'll tell you what just a few years ago we were doing some stuff I was out in the middle I'll tell you I was out in the middle of a Hayfield about 2 A.M and I'm standing out there working on a deal that got messed up I got goosebumps turned out it was a big old Badger coming over to see who is in his house yeah what sign are we looking for I'm looking for a word sign I'm looking for the word sign I'm not even going to look at it and you I'm going to look in the mirror and say Lord I need to see the word sign I need to see this sign here I need to wrap this up amen oh Hallelujah look in the midst of Leo to see there's this great voice coming forth and it's powerful my brother and sister you you will see this great voice coming and and do you guys remember here and his name is now I knew I should have wrote it down his name slipped my mind but there was a man who come to uh Kenneth Copeland and all the Pentecostals from the pope carrying a message to him I I can see his face but I cannot remember his name and he made some really bold statements that this this is God this is the voice of Elijah to this day and he dies in an accident on a motorcycle in England and then behind that rise is another great man not nearly as published or whatever as he was that was going around telling everybody that if you don't believe this you've been anointed by the spirit of the Holy Ghost and he dies in a car wreck Our God will not be mocked amen their voice my brother and sister is a great voice the World Hears that voice while they're over here demeaning One Voice they're promoting another voice and it's a great voice and they speak so well of that voice and it's there this God of this evil age is how the prophet said he said I'm the you know they're presentating I'm the voice I'm the authority if you want to be safe make your pledge to me you know where the pledge is it goes back to presentation make your pledge present to me bring your gift see verse 16 hearken not to Hezekiah for thus saith the king of Assyria make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me well I'll tell you what the devil's doing my brother and sister in Romans 12 1-2 it says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is not good and acceptable and perfect will of God I'm here to tell you there's only one thing on this Earth that's of value God's blessed sister Jerry and I with a little land amen we've worked hard we we're we're we're working towards that I guess it's just you know the farmer mentality you need dirt you're going to be a farmer you need dirt and that's well but I'm telling you my brother and sister there's nothing on this Earth that has the value of your soul that's right nothing no amount of land no amount of gold no amount of anything Fine Jewelry art whatever nothing matters the devil knows what is the intrinsic value and he says if I can get you to just come present yourself to me yeah I'll come I will accept you have you noticed the devil never rejects anyone my if the devil had a baseball team so what is it he's not looking at the flesh no looking at the flesh my brother and sister he's looking at this Soul he wants that soul I want that soul but God said come you present yourselves a Living Sacrifice I don't even want to kill you I want you living hallelujah amen but looks subtility Satan just comes I'm trying to jump over stuff sorry uh what's he doing he undermines our trust when you look at someone and you God allows you to bring conversation around in a certain fashion and finally you know you just realize what's happening and and you make a statement that can be just left alone taken either way whatever and then the person just opens up and says yeah you're right now I didn't say they had been angry at God but God discerned that and God opened that little deal now you're right I've been angry at God since I was a young woman why well when they tell you why you feel a little bit uh I think I almost need to sit down this is horrific and if God was a loving God why do you allow that to happen to me well I'll tell you there'll be a young lady sorry to be this bold there'll be a young lady in glory will have the exact same thing happen to her that will be standing at their pure and white Washed by the blood of the Lamb my brother and sister you see we have to recognize how special the gift God has given us this is not just I grew up in church or I I got saved my brother and sister this is an outpouring of the spirit of the very life of God out poured into you and I that nothing Satan can do can rob the life if so Satan would go over and shut the switch of eternal life off but he can't he can't amen oh outright anger you know thinking about this outright anger of unanswered prayers why did we lose this child why did this happen over here what was that unanswered prayers and outright anger to God not God's in control God's perfect will it is I wanted what I wanted and God didn't give it to me let me skip over some more I'm just going to go ahead and say this I almost skipped over sometime back in a conversation individual made a statement if the Lord does not come quickly no one will be saved in one context it the scriptural but they want in a scriptural context they're looking at their own life they're looking at the lives of those around them and they're seeing the cooling down they're seeing the falling away and my brother and sister I really didn't make much comment to this individual because I I didn't want to hurt any feelings and I just was a little stunned amen but you know what comes to me is what does the word say let that become something can we can we do that in our life can we just start making sure that we when we are angry or we disagree or I don't see it that way that we go to the word and let the word speak first and then if we feel like it's wrong come civilly and say I disagree with you and this is why but see people don't even go to the word they just don't like it I don't like that Philippians 1 6. being confident of this very thing do we have any confidence today be confident this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it when till next week until you get too tired to press on until the devil gets too strong no sir until the day of Jesus Christ my brother and sister I'm not worried about what's going on out here the world's getting Wicked and people are getting worldly but that's not my story my story is gonna be Lord I'm gonna be here and I'm gonna serve you by your grace and mercy I'm going to press into this battle Lord I might not be able to do it myself but you promised that you and me I can do it and I believe this now my brother and sister I'm going to go into a little different avenue here but if we my brother and sister don't believe what God Said it can only be because we didn't trust him because you have to trust him to believe him I'm reminded the little story where the dad tells his son they're out mowing the lawn and he's going along there and he tells his son he says you know when we get all done with his son I'll buy you an ice cream it takes a little longer you know big yard trim and everything and they've eaten supper and the dad appears in his sweats or gemmas or whatever you want to call them and his son comes over to him goes dad I need to talk to you and he says what is it son the promise dad being I think a real honest dad he wasn't lying to his son but what happened he's tired it's like promise yeah Dad ah son when we're done with this we'll go get ice cream and the dad gets up out of his chair gets dressed puts his son in the pickup drives into town buys him an ice cream because he had a revelation if he can't trust me now he won't trust me later come on my brother and sister if we can't trust God on the little things what's going to happen when we need to trust him for the big things amen God help us amen and God's Worthy amen he hasn't failed us now and he's not going to start amen now look at this Hallelujah amen Matthew 24 22 to 28 and uh uh you can just reference that amen but I want to draw from the last of that right there is he's talking about as it is you know if they're there if they're here you know don't do that don't run out here don't run out there you know except those days be shortened it says verse 22 there should uh be no flesh saved but for the elect's sake that's you hey can somebody lift a hand and say that's me Hallelujah I am the elect for my sake God is going to change it all for my sake oh you say I don't know if I matter to God he's changing time amen the very measure of time he's changing for your sake Hallelujah Hallelujah sorry I'm preaching so vigorous and so long here but I tell you I stored it up all week sick or not my brother and sister God doesn't just leave you sitting around amen now look at this for it says here in verse 28 for wheresoever the carcass says there will the Eagles be gathered together amen look this is the opening of the seals my brother and sister the revealing the putting on display to take you where the carcass is and people I've had this throat at me at before I'm sorry to say I had no answer for it they said are you trying to tell me that God there's more God here today than there was when my parents uh you know were that you know this person was older like probably 70ish I would say sorry brother David um so their parents were back aways right and they said you're saying we got more now this profit and whatever got more now than my parents had and I really didn't know how to answer that but I'm telling you my brother and sister I got a very simplistic answer for you now the seal is open it's off the book the page is revealed and only add another time in history has God given rapturing faith and now he's given it to a whole body it's not just an isolated case it's two in a whole body I say we got more now than they've ever had Through the Ages got more now of God Amen on display and reveal than has ever been placed on the Earth oh Hallelujah because now he's took a bride right into a Wilderness to the carcass and lets her feed freely on the carcass and rapturing Faith coming out of that word is coming and building up in her Hallelujah Christ himself said I want to be on display I think I'll come and walk in the streets of Nampa Meridian Boise Caldwell and I'm going to do it so openly they can't see me that's wow there it is oh my God look this is the fullness of the manifestation of rapturing faith the line upon line of constant building up amen now you young people you don't probably take vitamins but I've always been resistant to vitamins I don't like vitamins my wife has to always tell me did you take your vitamins and I open up my sacked lunch during the day and there's vitamins but you know when I take vitamins my body says good good I'm just wondering why can't I just take a giant syringe full of vitamin D and just get all the vitamin D I need because I can't handle it has nothing to do with the vitamin D it has to do with me that's right I'm God is giving us a little bit more every single let me open this seal for you let me let you see just who you are and I start to look at that and the little neurons in my brain starts popping and I come to the realization I have no clue who Christ is in me oh can you follow that no clue my brother and sister he in me is so much greater than I can even comprehend I look at this and see a feeble man and God looks and says I see myself and I'm still struggling with myself to see myself and God says look just look at a little glimpse of me right here in you a little glimpse of me right here in you now take another bite brother I'm talking about the apple tree he says that little tree don't need to do nothing but drink and push out drink and push out but if it isn't drinking if it isn't drinking it's not pushing Hallelujah for homework Proverbs 3 1-6 amen tells us Deltas take verse five and we'll move on trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not unto thy own understanding you see my brother and sister if we can't trust him we won't believe him that's it it's not cut and dried if we don't believe God's our healer and we don't trust him to heal us we'll never fully act upon that amen Deliverance got an issue in your life you need deliverance from if you don't actually believe God will can and will deliver you from that and trust him for that never happen that's it and I'll back that up with a quote right here right here Brothers if you put that up on the screen we'll we'll be done here it's only a lengthy quote shouldn't be more than 30 minutes okay now so you'll understand we're talking about this as I have heard but now I see 1965 11 27 65. my brother and sister this is at the end of brother Brown's Ministry brother Brian's laying foundational things for us to come and dig up now yeah to dig up now not to sit and wait for him to be delivered for us but Lord give me a spiritual pick and shovel to dig into the word and see what it is now look at this brother Brown was talking about these brothers that uh the the oil wells you guys know the story about the whole Wells so well they wouldn't listen to it then first before we left that night the place where we were having lunch the Holy Spirit showed me a great crack in the earth that and in that was full of oil and these overflows in kentuckies was just little beds of oil they were pumping from but this come from the mainstream and I said brother Demas it's there so they went searching for said go down and tell us where the oil well is I want you to catch this right here oh no no no no no we don't use the gift of God for commercial amen oh let me throw another deal we're not going to use the gift of God to build a big church we're not going to use the gift of God to have hundreds or thou members my brother and sister will use the gift of God to get a body that is on the carcass eating ready for the Rapture that's what the word is for get you and not ready for a rapture no no he he could tell me where it was at but I I don't have any need of it he's talking about the Lord he could tell me where it was at but I don't have any need of it I wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him this is a prophet of God I wouldn't even have enough Faith to ask him where's the oil he saw the vision of it though he had enough confidence in God revealing a vision to him to recognize there's a spot down there that has oil beyond measure the prophet of God wasn't doubting it but he says he didn't have enough Faith to ask for it see if I had need of it I believe if I'd ask him he'd tell me but first you see your motives and objective has to be right you have to have reasons for this God don't give you those things just because you ask and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of God now I hope some of you don't stumble over this or maybe you've read a little bit ahead here naughty naughty amen see if you want to be well do you what do you want to be well for if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling God what do you want to do with your life when you get healed see there's got to be hmm you've got to have a motive and objective they have to be right according to the will of God and that's when the faith is revealed to you and by God his Sovereign Grace places that faith in there then it's over see now see amen now to make that word true when the Brethren got down there they got one fellow went over and bought a bunch of stuff so Lisa's cheated the other one this way and I said see it won't work now just to make the prophecy sure within a hundred yards of where these men were digging their will some man struck the big gusher and it's there 1100 barrels of oil in a half a day or something or other like that still putting it out right in the mainstream but just make the prophecy the word had been said it was there it was there the rest of them nearly is all dried out everywhere through Kentucky little ponds they pumped them a little while they go it's only the Overflow from this see but because of selfishness other God among it the objectives were wrong signing up a bunch of stuff it would be this way and when they promised they would do it for the kingdom of God now can I just draw this back Lord I want you to heal me so I can go work harder make more money do this do that but if you had a real need and you were going to do something for God the prophet's telling us God's Gonna recognize that right I won't even acknowledge that I have a problem that has to do with my blood and my sugar amen I asked the Lord to heal me but I'll tell you Saints between cauliflower beet juice you guys ever take beet juice amen I would rather eat dirt in a field than take breaches but I feel better I actually have half of mine now I want God to heal me why do I want God to heal me it's been my prayer Lord I want to preach this gospel to my dying breath that's right amen does that mean God's obligated to heal me no but I'll still claim it amen I still believe it amen Hallelujah I don't want it to be selfish see selfish and what's gone amongst it and the objectives were wrong they were doing all this stuff no selfish thing will work your motives and objectives has to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith to ask if your hearts condemn us not then we have confidence see we got to have confidence I want this to be honor and glory of God then faith has a channel to move into and if it doesn't then you've got mental intellectual faith not genuine faith amen my brother and sister Lord help us amen help us my brother and sister that we could come amen let's go to the next is that wasn't all of it was it yeah okay that intellectual faith will get you nowhere might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing you're looking for so job checking himself with the genuine faith that God had given to him that he was just see I love how God led the prophet to bring this through of these men whose motive and objective and they didn't get this now real cut and dried if they had actually believed what the prophet of God spoke to them and trusted him see there's a lot more to the story I I had to just grab that piece if they'd actually believed what the prophet spoke to them they'd have went and following the leadership of the Holy Ghost walked out there so to speak but intellectual Revelation right right of the will of God well I have no problem if God blesses brother Chris and brother David's Ministry I just want mine to be better really what's your motive yeah the word says one plants another Waters and another dose the Harvest reminds me of a man once he repented of these words but he said I was so just Minister said I was so disappointed my child went to Louisiana I've been working with my child for so long went to Louisiana to camp meeting got baptized down there as our own father or Minister I didn't even get a baptize my own daughter really you planted you cultivated you did all of this and in the moment the spirits struck she responds should have been on the other end hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah It produced a seed we have wrong motives oh my God yeah I gotta hurry Sister Sarah you'll help come on hey man I'll start looking over there with you playing and I'll feel guilty and I'll stop what's the reason reason you want to be healed that's the reason you can't get Faith in a sea because you haven't made this thing to God sincerely from your heart like Hezekiah did God give God the reason he wanted his King said his kingdom in order and that's part of the reason I brought this quote or how it tied in you see my brother and sister in all the things that what Hezekiah faced all the king of Assyria and all these negative people and all these come give yourself to us we'll bless you do all of these things it all comes back and God honored and made this come to pass because Hezekiah himself a king who had lost his way had something in his heart a sword please I see my error I need to set my kingdom in order oh God help us I want to set my kingdom in order want everything in my life I want everything in my family I want to set it in order my brother and sister God's a gracious God don't look I preached to you on the measure of time the other day this in a way is an extension of that don't look at it I've got time look at your heart's desire it's your desire just to have Time and Time and Time and Time God give me way more time I do whatever I want at the last moment I'll get my life right know my brother and sister take the time God has given us and in this time let God do the work he desires let God move upon us and change our lives and change the situations around us amen but he tells him right there God sent his Prophet back and told him he'd be healed see but you have to have those things made right first so then as soon as you get those places and know it's been revealed to you by the word of God by Revelation by the word that God what God requires you to do then you have faith genuine Faith oh my brother and sister I don't know what's in your life I don't know why God lays things on our lives in this maybe he's just preaching to me and I tell you let's get our Kingdoms in order amen let's take this measure that God has given to us and apply it today don't leave the balm of Gilead on this shelf and say well someday take that balm and Rob yourself in that balm of Gilead and say Lord give me the grace and the courage to make Kingdom in order today oh sometimes it's facing hard things sometimes it's facing hard things my brother and sister I don't mean to put my own family in the spotlight but years ago a little bit of estranged things that attitude a spirit between me and my children and as the minister as a pastor and and things of life I was just like why can't my children just love me and I started praying and it's like Lord I've done my best why not Lord I'm not saying they didn't love me and I don't want to sound like that they were callous [Music] and the Lord revealed to me one day and said you need to go to them and ask forgiveness and you know I was like Lord what do I need to ask forgiveness for well I'll tell you what if you ask God a question like that you know it's all under the blood and I believe it's under the blood but but God has a book God's got a memory and he started just like there was this and there was this and there was this and there's this and this and by God's grace church I hope you catch what I'm saying it was so hard for me to approach my children individually say I've done you wrong forgive me it was so hard and when it was finished there was such Liberty you see God's Not Gonna God's Not Gonna just gloss over it and move on he wants you and I to take the prophet's words and press into this Hallelujah we love the Lord today I've kept you a little long amen Hallelujah you see Trust and faith are interconnected and I'll say this once again if they had believed the prophet if they had to rest trusted the prophet they would have believed the prophet amen I think it's the same today only there it's not really about brother William Branham these people don't actually believe God they don't trust God Lord help us to trust you let's just stand sing a song or two before we would go today amen please pray for us

this church God wants Liberty in these lives would you do that with me would we just take time and say Lord whatever it is that's slowing me down hindering holding back a little complex a little something maybe reminds me I'm sorry to go into this but just shares reminds me of a situation that I was part of God using something a father [Music] said to a daughter when she was about 10 going on 11 years old and it cut that little girl so deep at 40 years old she said brother Paul this is in South America it's not here why can't I find joy in my selfish and God was kind enough in her prayer and her cry Lord why good her father was passed and she said Lord forgive me for I've held that against my father to say little girl you're so ugly I don't know if anyone will ever want to marry you maybe the dad was in humor but it cut to the heart of this child and laughter is something missing and there she was a wife and a mother and Satan's still binding that to her spirit don't have to dig you don't have to get a jackhammer and pound on yourself to find the sound just a simple Lord what's hindering what's Hendrick [Music] man I love you Saints I shoot till we come together on Wednesday night may God bless you everything you lay hands for every prayer you pray for your family for the families of the church for the bride of Christ pray with Liberty or you can be under burdened Saints
