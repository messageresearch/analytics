[39:21] i
[39:23] want you
[39:29] amen
[39:31] amen that uh
[39:34] i watched a thing the other day about
[39:36] the uh
[39:37] one of the
[39:38] pilot that was supposed to be in the
[39:40] driver's seat for the uh the 20th
[39:43] commemoration or yeah 20th commemoration
[39:45] of 911. it was the pilot that was
[39:47] supposed to be in the driver's seat
[39:49] um of that first plane that hit the
[39:51] world trade centers
[39:54] headed for from boston to l.a
[39:56] and uh
[39:58] good good testimony um but he he ended
[40:00] it with what he'd written the day before
[40:04] prior to him taking
[40:06] it prior to him signing up for that
[40:08] flight and then getting bumped in the
[40:10] last 20 minutes
[40:11] but um
[40:12] he said
[40:14] it was his life um
[40:16] his life
[40:19] i don't know what he called it but
[40:21] but he said um
[40:23] to seek
[40:24] trust and glorified god
[40:27] through humble service and continual
[40:29] prayer
[40:31] to raise up qualified disciples
[40:34] and
[40:37] as quickly as possible so that one day i
[40:39] might hear god say well done my good and
[40:42] faithful servant amen so he wrote that
[40:45] the day before
[40:47] he was supposed to be on that flight i
[40:49] thought that was quite something
[40:51] this guy i believe god hadn't been where
[40:52] he was needed to be obviously so
[40:55] amen
[40:57] let's just sing that little chorus um
[40:59] before brother paul comes i love him i
[41:01] love him because he first loved me
[41:05] [Music]
[41:08] i
[41:11] love you
[41:15] [Music]
[41:22] because he
[41:24] [Music]
[41:25] first loved me
[41:30] [Music]
[41:38] [Applause]
[41:43] oh
[41:45] [Music]
[41:54] i
[41:56] [Music]
[42:14] me
[42:16] [Music]
[42:40] tell him how much you love him this
[42:41] morning
[42:43] i'm
[42:45] [Music]
[43:11] so
[43:17] [Music]
[43:26] [Music]
[43:29] aren't you glad today that you can
[43:32] sing that song with a
[43:34] heartfelt conviction in your soul
[43:37] not just words that we would we would
[43:40] sing not just something that we were
[43:43] taught but
[43:44] it has
[43:45] become revelation to us
[43:48] so thankful
[43:49] for the revelation that god has given to
[43:52] us in this day
[43:54] my brother and sister i think
[43:56] if we just
[43:58] i try not to limit as it were what you
[44:01] would think or have or understand but
[44:04] as we're going to speak a little bit
[44:06] further in our service i think sometimes
[44:08] we
[44:09] don't comprehend the fullness of what
[44:11] god is really doing in the day that we
[44:13] live in doing in our lives
[44:15] i just want to uh just to share a couple
[44:18] things
[44:19] i'm assuming because
[44:22] now if you'll remember
[44:24] sister yulia's brother
[44:26] depends on how you determine him and i
[44:29] uh
[44:30] communicate on the paul level but i
[44:33] think he's called pasha and would that
[44:35] be right as would be his native
[44:39] um
[44:40] he has
[44:41] i think announced to me so i think
[44:43] that's to the world that uh he is now
[44:45] engaged uh to a sister joy ronnie and
[44:49] from pennsylvania and so i'm really
[44:52] happy for him what a wonderful young man
[44:54] and i believe god's got tremendous
[44:56] things in store for him he has an
[44:58] absolute burning zeal for the gospel
[45:00] amen and that's one thing i just love
[45:03] about him and so
[45:04] just happy for that so
[45:07] we just send our congratulations and uh
[45:11] a beautiful young lady sent me a picture
[45:14] and uh just a beautiful young sister and
[45:18] we just pray god's blessings on them
[45:20] now we
[45:22] reported this i think or shared this i
[45:24] think on a wednesday night so many of
[45:25] you would not have uh have known this
[45:28] but we've also received a report back
[45:30] the great appreciation uh from the
[45:33] families that you helped send to the
[45:35] meetings in the ukraine and uh so they
[45:38] have been uh just very happy very uh uh
[45:42] blessed in those meetings and uh i just
[45:45] want to say thanks to you and supporting
[45:48] this church this assembly that we could
[45:50] help those
[45:52] those families many of them uh are are
[45:55] poor enough and we certainly don't speak
[45:57] that you know some people think well you
[45:59] know it's just terrible they're so poor
[46:02] but uh some of us might be a little
[46:04] better off if we were a little poorer
[46:06] we'd probably have to have a prayer life
[46:08] uh to see uh you know our daily needs
[46:11] met instead of our comfort you know
[46:13] taking over our our resources uh making
[46:16] the difference and so god just blessed
[46:19] that to many young people and their
[46:21] parents and that's how it was presented
[46:23] to me were focused on the young people
[46:26] and their parents need to travel with
[46:28] them but uh that god bless them so thank
[46:31] you for supporting the word of god and
[46:33] this assembly amen i want to speak to
[46:36] you today on redemption's manifestation
[46:38] once again
[46:39] and uh i want to as a as a title i want
[46:43] to um
[46:44] uh
[46:45] title it this morning interpreting the
[46:48] vision and uh you see my brother and
[46:50] sister there's other visions besides as
[46:53] it would be the visions that god would
[46:54] give to a prophet
[46:56] would give to seers as it were
[47:00] through the ages the apostles etc
[47:03] you see you and i
[47:05] have to have a vision and as we'll go
[47:07] right into the word this morning we will
[47:09] take this right out of the book of
[47:11] proverbs thank you sister ruth uh amen
[47:14] so we want to uh take this
[47:18] in proverbs
[47:19] the 29th chapter the 18th verse just a
[47:23] simple single scripture
[47:26] to start our thought today
[47:28] and uh proverbs 29 18 says where there
[47:32] is no vision
[47:34] the people perish
[47:36] but he they keep of the law happy is he
[47:39] heavenly father ask your blessings on
[47:41] the word today in the name of jesus
[47:43] christ amen you may be seated
[47:46] now as we look at this we understand
[47:48] through the ages
[47:50] that uh god always wanted his people to
[47:53] be focused my brother and sister god is
[47:55] not wanting us to wander to and fro or
[47:58] lose our vision and and uh just to give
[48:01] a little uh thought as it were of what
[48:04] we're going to speak on today
[48:06] the definition of the word vision is
[48:08] eyesight
[48:10] the ability to see or the ability to
[48:12] think about or plan the future
[48:15] and so we'll look at this and realize
[48:17] what god is giving when he wanted to
[48:20] give to his people a vision that they
[48:22] could
[48:23] see it's not just about
[48:26] as i said prophetic vision coming to
[48:28] prophets and apostles etc but my brother
[48:31] and sister it is that the people you and
[48:34] i need a vision for the day that we live
[48:37] in amen we see in the word that every
[48:39] time the church lost its vision uh it
[48:42] wandered into trouble and we'll see and
[48:45] i use for an example today goshen amen
[48:48] so here is a time that israel now has
[48:51] come and maybe it was lost in the time
[48:54] maybe it wasn't i don't know exactly but
[48:56] you know the word of god was that after
[48:58] that i will let them dwell in the land
[49:00] for 400 years and then he said i will
[49:03] deliver those people and so in goshen
[49:06] god made a covenant to them that he
[49:08] would deliver or take them into the
[49:11] promised land and my brother and sister
[49:13] you know it seems simple as you read the
[49:15] scripture and i didn't include all of
[49:17] them today certainly you can look them
[49:19] up and read them but you see those
[49:22] things were a promise that god made many
[49:25] years so more than 400 years before and
[49:28] god says you know i'm going to deliver
[49:30] you i'm going to deliver you out of
[49:32] their hands but it's not that god just
[49:34] called you out when god calls you out he
[49:37] has some place for you to go amen so he
[49:40] didn't call us as a people out just to
[49:42] leave us sitting out here wondering what
[49:44] our future is but he whatever he has
[49:46] called you out of he has called you to
[49:48] enter into and so it's there as we'll
[49:51] see that how that in goshen uh this
[49:55] covenant is starting to take place and
[49:58] the supernatural my brother and sister
[49:59] they had no ability as it is to deliver
[50:02] themselves out of the hands of pharaoh
[50:05] or out of the the kingdom of of uh
[50:08] pharaoh and and so but god made this
[50:11] promise and so we see these things start
[50:13] to come and they're coming to pass and
[50:16] here is this promise amen to deliver now
[50:20] being fulfilled it is a prophecy that is
[50:23] coming to pass and i say we need to we
[50:26] have my brother and sister the scope of
[50:29] all the years of prophecy all of this
[50:32] scripture through the ages has spoke of
[50:34] this day and we need to be aware and
[50:37] when i say aware don't go try and just
[50:39] study this out but by prayer let
[50:41] revelation show you that the prophecies
[50:44] are coming to pass we are witnesses
[50:47] today if we are paying attention
[50:51] amen
[50:53] if
[50:56] if we're not we can look and say oh my
[50:58] what is happening in our nation look my
[51:00] brother and sister prophecy right in our
[51:02] day right within you know generations of
[51:05] us right here prophecies that said we
[51:07] will see the fall
[51:11] and we'll see the rising
[51:13] and we're seeing that
[51:15] we're seeing corporations and we're
[51:17] seeing nations now looking as it is to
[51:19] the church the one true and only church
[51:22] for advice
[51:24] my brother and sister but yet you see
[51:27] that one true and only church has its
[51:30] own scandals and its own issues and
[51:32] whatever you see what the anointing is
[51:34] they're looking it's the prophecy that's
[51:36] pointing them back it's not the
[51:38] leadership or the value of that
[51:40] leadership it's the prophecy that's
[51:42] causing them to turn and look back to
[51:44] that it is there my brother and sister
[51:46] that the prophecy should be causing you
[51:48] and i in the day that we live in to stop
[51:51] and look to what the promise to you and
[51:54] i is it is not my brother and sister
[51:57] that just simply oh these things are
[51:58] taking place this is prophecy fulfilled
[52:02] this is the word coming to life in our
[52:05] presence amen so you see many of these
[52:08] people coming out of goshen in that day
[52:10] you see the promise was there but these
[52:13] people had a different vision of what
[52:15] was taking place all they cared about
[52:17] brother branham talks about this mixed
[52:19] multitude that was coming out of egypt
[52:21] he talks about the mixed multitude
[52:23] that's in the midst of the church but
[52:25] you see many of these people's vision
[52:27] was simply to get out of egypt
[52:30] it was not a deliverance from their own
[52:33] self not a submission to god almighty to
[52:36] jehovah but it was simply lord i want
[52:39] out of my present circumstance and i
[52:42] will follow this i will follow this plan
[52:45] this program
[52:46] and i'll just be a little bold this
[52:48] morning to say there's too many people
[52:50] around the message that weren't happy in
[52:52] denomination so they followed the
[52:54] message out but they're not looking for
[52:56] where the message was called to take
[52:58] them
[52:59] they just want it delivered from as it
[53:01] were their own self or their own
[53:03] denominational things and it's there
[53:05] that they're not looking they didn't
[53:07] have a vision of where the word for our
[53:09] day said i'm taking you
[53:11] amen oh god help us because you see
[53:14] people have different vision of what is
[53:16] taking place
[53:21] this mixed multitude
[53:25] this vision that was
[53:27] revealed as it were in that land now i
[53:29] want you to just follow because i want
[53:31] to move quickly today
[53:33] you see the vision
[53:34] look saints i'm talking you this morning
[53:36] not not someone else not another place
[53:39] the vision that we have god will test
[53:42] you
[53:44] to prove
[53:45] your vision
[53:51] their vision was started to be revealed
[53:53] the minute they got to the red sea
[53:57] where was the people that rose up and
[53:59] said praise the lord i got an obstacle
[54:02] called the red sea in my way but i've
[54:04] got a god that said he's delivering me
[54:06] to a promised land so whatever this
[54:09] obstacle is it must be removed in the
[54:12] name of jesus christ
[54:14] but instead an obstacle come and it
[54:16] started the red sea started to reveal
[54:19] the vision they held and the revision
[54:22] they held did not cause them to come and
[54:24] have a great revival and crying out to
[54:27] god but it was words of doubt and fear
[54:30] and i just read a little dear deal my
[54:32] brother and sister then that it was on
[54:34] the internet or whatever and it's there
[54:36] and look at the spirit that is in the
[54:38] land today they have no fear of god but
[54:41] they fear the plague
[54:44] that was a spirit of egypt
[54:46] they feared the plagues but they did not
[54:49] have there was no revival broke out in
[54:51] egypt there was no crying out to god
[54:54] they were angry at god
[54:58] but they were terrified of the plague
[55:00] you see the bride of jesus christ was
[55:01] not called to be afraid of the plague
[55:03] they were called to be concerned as as
[55:05] brother isaac just read that it struck
[55:07] my heart it's that i would be pleasing i
[55:10] want to hear the voice can you say amen
[55:12] i want to hear the voice well done my
[55:14] good and faithful servant i don't want
[55:16] to hear any other voice out here
[55:18] no other voice even matters
[55:21] amen
[55:23] and so we see the red sea revealed
[55:26] the vision that they held and the
[55:29] serpents in the wilderness revealed a
[55:31] little bit more
[55:33] of their vision
[55:35] you realize my brother and sister god
[55:37] never brings judgment
[55:40] well giving us
[55:42] as it is a warning but he gives us a way
[55:44] out of judgment god will never judge a
[55:47] people without having provided them do
[55:50] you realize that those people that were
[55:52] dying in the wilderness
[55:55] had a brazen serpent they could look to
[55:59] but that wasn't their vision and they
[56:02] died because of it
[56:04] you say how can that be all they had to
[56:06] do the word of the hour was look to the
[56:08] brazen serpent and you shall live
[56:11] but they could
[56:12] they wouldn't they didn't
[56:16] and then we see my brother and sister
[56:17] the golden calf revealed even more of
[56:19] their vision they come to a place moses
[56:22] is on the mountain and they're like
[56:23] moses is gone we don't know what
[56:25] happened to him we don't know where he's
[56:26] at but what we want to do everybody you
[56:28] know my my this is not a real ring it's
[56:31] it's a it's a
[56:33] but you know they had their rings of
[56:34] gold
[56:36] and they took their earrings it says off
[56:38] and their bracelets and their rings and
[56:39] they cast them in the pot and they
[56:41] melted them down and they poured them
[56:43] and made a brazen calf so quickly
[56:46] from the removal i hope you get this so
[56:48] quickly from the removal of the prophet
[56:50] from their presence telling them day by
[56:53] day what they must do day by day giving
[56:55] the leadership so quickly when he is in
[56:58] the mountain that they said hey let's go
[57:00] back to what we were doing let's go back
[57:02] to where we were from this leadership is
[57:05] not getting us to the land it never was
[57:07] moses leadership
[57:10] it always was god's leadership and i
[57:12] want to say the same today my brother
[57:14] and sister people are saying we're
[57:16] waiting for brother branham to come back
[57:18] look why do we need brother branham to
[57:20] come back it was the leadership of
[57:22] almighty god in our day a vindicated
[57:26] word that a prophet faithfully brought
[57:28] to us and why do we need to go back
[57:30] because he himself said he is here
[57:34] he is here and he is in his people once
[57:37] again amen amen so we didn't need to go
[57:40] back but so quickly
[57:43] so quickly removed
[57:45] that the people their vision
[57:48] was not of the promise that god had
[57:50] given but of the circumstances that
[57:52] surrounded them
[57:56] and you know what comes to a head at
[57:57] katy's barney and you know i've often
[58:00] spoke of this because this strikes me as
[58:02] very real because my brother and sister
[58:04] once again please forgive me for my
[58:06] redundancy but once again we'll see this
[58:09] that the negative
[58:11] had come out so often
[58:14] that the people themselves were doubting
[58:17] what god had in store for them
[58:20] and when the spies went into the land
[58:23] they come back with everything that the
[58:26] word said they would come back with
[58:32] but the ministry amen
[58:34] said you know what church
[58:37] brothers
[58:38] sisters
[58:40] young people
[58:42] it's so hard to live the message
[58:45] in september
[58:47] of 2021.
[58:50] so hard
[58:52] we can't do it
[58:55] laodicea is such a giant
[58:58] in our midst
[59:01] so what we're going to do
[59:03] is reinterpret
[59:04] the vision
[59:08] we're going to restructure it
[59:11] and when we go out and
[59:14] we do these things we're going to just
[59:16] say god understands
[59:18] [Music]
[59:19] but my bible says in acts 2 that you
[59:22] repent
[59:23] you don't say yep god understands see
[59:26] they've changed the vision
[59:28] to god understands when god said repent
[59:32] amen and so it's there the restructuring
[59:35] and the kadish barnia the people had
[59:37] been so under an influence
[59:40] and you say now brother paul why are you
[59:42] making influence well i will here uh
[59:43] make a point here in a minute but my
[59:45] brother and sister they had a choice on
[59:47] that day to listen to what the truth of
[59:50] the promise was which was joshua and
[59:53] caleb right representing christ and his
[59:56] uh support or ministry amen and so they
[59:59] had a choice between believing that
[1:00:02] or believing the multitude
[1:00:05] of ministry amen
[1:00:09] and all they had to do i made this i
[1:00:10] don't know why i'm making the point
[1:00:12] quite this way but
[1:00:13] you see all they had to do that day and
[1:00:15] i want to say this please hear me
[1:00:18] all they had to do was not they didn't
[1:00:20] have to explain it they didn't have to
[1:00:22] have all the bullet points and the
[1:00:24] references and be able to
[1:00:26] speak it all out well this is why that
[1:00:28] happened this and this is coming like
[1:00:30] this all they had to do is come to a
[1:00:32] point and say amen to the word so be it
[1:00:35] lord
[1:00:36] you called me out and i know that you
[1:00:39] call me in and i say amen to that lord
[1:00:43] that's all they had to do saints amen
[1:00:46] and god would activate that in their
[1:00:48] life and they would have walked across
[1:00:49] but they come to the place they no
[1:00:51] longer were able
[1:00:52] now get this
[1:00:54] it wasn't that they were unable to say
[1:00:56] amen
[1:00:57] to the preaching
[1:01:00] they were unable to say amen
[1:01:03] to the word
[1:01:06] see it can be preached
[1:01:08] brother branham says even
[1:01:11] falsehood
[1:01:13] has an element of truth
[1:01:24] what happened kadis barney of the people
[1:01:26] responded it says all of israel cried
[1:01:28] that night and and we know that joshua
[1:01:30] caleb and those with them they cried
[1:01:32] because the people had just rejected god
[1:01:38] not in their mind though their vision
[1:01:40] was they were still israel
[1:01:43] we're god's chosen people
[1:01:45] but in god's vision
[1:01:48] they had to stand on the word not
[1:01:50] wavering not fearing not backing away
[1:01:52] from not parrying it down not trying to
[1:01:55] oversimplify it or make it over
[1:01:57] complicated just simply take the word
[1:01:59] say amen to it and let the power of the
[1:02:02] word move in their life
[1:02:04] and that's all we have to do in the hour
[1:02:05] we live in my brother and sister we
[1:02:07] don't need to over complicate this we
[1:02:08] don't need to oversimplify this we need
[1:02:10] to just look at the word and what the
[1:02:12] word says we say amen to that and then
[1:02:15] let the word change our lives
[1:02:18] amen and so this happens there at cadiz
[1:02:21] barney all because they had not gotten
[1:02:23] god's vision they had their own vision
[1:02:25] they had their ministry's vision you see
[1:02:28] they failed to see god's mighty hand
[1:02:31] they didn't realize that all that had
[1:02:33] happened
[1:02:34] up to this point was god's mighty hand
[1:02:36] on their life and you'll see my brother
[1:02:38] and sister 17 times in the bible that
[1:02:42] uses the words mighty hand and you'll
[1:02:44] see every one of them is talking about
[1:02:46] the power of god not one single word
[1:02:48] about the mighty hand of satan
[1:02:53] but we got to stop and say you know what
[1:02:55] the power that's behind me
[1:02:57] the power as it were that controls my
[1:02:59] life the power that guides me is not
[1:03:02] satan it's not his dominion it's not his
[1:03:05] right it's jesus christ it's the word in
[1:03:08] you coming to life is the guiding
[1:03:10] bride
[1:03:11] amen now we look at this i want you to
[1:03:14] see as we go to revelations uh the first
[1:03:16] chapter 17 through 20 and we'll look at
[1:03:19] this here and when i saw him this is
[1:03:22] john now this is the revelation of the
[1:03:24] end time
[1:03:26] are you with me
[1:03:27] this is not revelation for days gone by
[1:03:29] this is revelation of the end time the
[1:03:32] apocalypse
[1:03:33] amen
[1:03:35] when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[1:03:37] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:03:40] saying unto me fear not i'm the first
[1:03:43] and the last
[1:03:44] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:03:46] behold i am alive forevermore right so
[1:03:49] this right here my brother and sister is
[1:03:51] god declaring to the world i am eternal
[1:03:55] life
[1:03:56] amen so this is our you know controversy
[1:03:59] in the in the religious world when
[1:04:00] brother branham says that hell is not
[1:04:02] eternal
[1:04:09] yes sir
[1:04:10] that would mean hell had to come out of
[1:04:12] god
[1:04:15] not so
[1:04:18] i'm alive forevermore amen and how keys
[1:04:21] of hell and death
[1:04:23] write the things which thou hast seen
[1:04:27] now my brother and sister you can take
[1:04:29] this and move this that thou has seen
[1:04:31] over to take and write the things you
[1:04:35] saw in the vision
[1:04:38] see it's what he saw right there it was
[1:04:41] the vision and what we have now in the
[1:04:43] book of revelation is the vision that
[1:04:46] god revealed to john and john wrote it
[1:04:49] and become the written word to you and i
[1:04:51] so my brother and sister if we get in
[1:04:53] the spirit do you believe in getting in
[1:04:55] the spirit just to read your bible amen
[1:04:57] it doesn't do good to just read it like
[1:04:59] some carnal thing you know like we're
[1:05:01] reading a romance or we're reading a
[1:05:02] western or we're reading history or
[1:05:05] whatever it is it won't do you any good
[1:05:07] to just approach it that way you need to
[1:05:10] get in the spirit when when you get in
[1:05:12] the spirit my brother and sister you
[1:05:14] start to see in the word much deeper
[1:05:17] than the old carnal flesh can ever see
[1:05:20] amen so it's there that it without
[1:05:22] revelation and getting in the spirit the
[1:05:24] very thing that john wrote was meant not
[1:05:27] to just be seen by john but written in
[1:05:30] the in the pages of our bible now that
[1:05:33] revelation is being witnessed or seen by
[1:05:36] a bride in our day
[1:05:38] you realize that you are seeing the same
[1:05:40] vision that john saw on that time the
[1:05:43] same mystery revealed that was revealed
[1:05:46] to john in that day was not to meant to
[1:05:49] remain hidden but it says that in the
[1:05:51] last days that the mystery of christ
[1:05:54] should be revealed i'm just paraphrasing
[1:05:56] this should be revealed to his bride
[1:06:00] so it's not just uh something to go on
[1:06:02] that our mystery remains and we go
[1:06:04] through life wondering what god intended
[1:06:06] god intended for you in the spirit to be
[1:06:09] able to see in the word what john saw
[1:06:14] otherwise the mystery
[1:06:17] past
[1:06:18] with john
[1:06:19] that's right
[1:06:22] so if the mystery passed with john there
[1:06:24] would be no need for you and i to read
[1:06:26] it
[1:06:28] but that's not what the word declared to
[1:06:30] us
[1:06:31] it declared to us we take the book
[1:06:34] we eat it
[1:06:36] and it's going to be sweet in our mouth
[1:06:38] come on
[1:06:39] come on preach with me this morning it's
[1:06:41] going to be sweet in our mouth but the
[1:06:44] minute i have to live what i said amen
[1:06:48] to it becomes hard it becomes bitter to
[1:06:51] us
[1:06:53] but we don't quit do we
[1:06:55] that's not what we were called we're not
[1:06:56] called to be quitters we're not called
[1:06:58] to go back
[1:07:00] amen i'm not called you know my my daddy
[1:07:03] come from a catholic background my mama
[1:07:05] come from actually uh very far back you
[1:07:08] might say through my grandmother and lds
[1:07:11] or if you take it right at what my
[1:07:12] grandmother was bible missionary i'm not
[1:07:15] called to go back to that i'm called to
[1:07:17] go to the word you are called not to go
[1:07:19] back to what you come out of but to go
[1:07:22] to the word so we're not called to go
[1:07:24] back we're called to go forward
[1:07:26] we're called to keep marching keep
[1:07:28] moving amen
[1:07:30] so he's there declaring i am he that
[1:07:32] liveth
[1:07:34] and was dead
[1:07:35] talking to the resurrection behold i'm
[1:07:37] alive forever more talking of eternal
[1:07:39] life and have keys of hell and of death
[1:07:42] in other words i control it
[1:07:46] the devil has not one thing my brother
[1:07:48] and sister we have to be afraid of
[1:07:50] now i hope when you catch this you can
[1:07:52] bring this down further in the service
[1:07:54] right to things which thou has
[1:07:57] saw in the vision
[1:08:00] and the things which are and the things
[1:08:01] which shall be hereafter
[1:08:04] and i put verse 20 on there but you can
[1:08:06] read that uh speaking of the uh seven
[1:08:10] star seven golden candlesticks now as we
[1:08:13] look at this my brother and sister john
[1:08:15] what did john see
[1:08:17] the unfolding word
[1:08:19] see john didn't have just one flash that
[1:08:21] god tried to imprint upon his mind but
[1:08:23] he saw an unfolding taking place he saw
[1:08:27] something coming to pass he saw
[1:08:29] revelation being revealed and it comes
[1:08:32] down and it might be pardon me for
[1:08:34] putting it this way it would be as
[1:08:36] though we were seeing a love story
[1:08:39] unfolding
[1:08:40] you see when we are looking in life and
[1:08:43] we'll just use a young man and a young
[1:08:45] woman for example we'll see them they're
[1:08:47] first
[1:08:48] introduced and
[1:08:50] my brother and sister you know i kind of
[1:08:52] believe in love at first sight but we
[1:08:54] won't go into that but you see true love
[1:08:57] cannot really honestly be manifested
[1:09:00] until it spent about 30 40 or 50 years
[1:09:02] together
[1:09:04] there is the true manifestation of love
[1:09:07] the endurance the test of time the
[1:09:09] nature as it would be being revealed and
[1:09:12] opened up to where somebody would say
[1:09:14] what would your wife do now most men
[1:09:16] would say i don't know i wouldn't
[1:09:18] understand my wife but the truth of it
[1:09:20] is people be able to say what was your
[1:09:22] wife doing this and you'll know because
[1:09:23] you've seen her and watched her and
[1:09:25] lived with her all these years what
[1:09:27] would your husband do well you can just
[1:09:29] say well i don't know he might do this
[1:09:31] he might do that no really what would he
[1:09:32] do well i he would do this
[1:09:35] because it's a revelation that is there
[1:09:37] and so we see how that this book of
[1:09:40] revelation is showing it has a lot of
[1:09:42] negative things god doesn't want us to
[1:09:44] be naive god doesn't want us to sit here
[1:09:46] look my brother and sister you want to
[1:09:48] entertain yourself sorry i have a very
[1:09:49] sick mind when it comes to entertainment
[1:09:51] you want to entertain yourself just go
[1:09:53] on the internet what is the antichrist
[1:09:57] it's biden it's trump it's this it's
[1:10:00] that it's it's a monsanto it's this over
[1:10:03] here and it's that over there you see my
[1:10:05] brother and sister you won't find the
[1:10:08] truth of that because the revelation of
[1:10:11] revelation of the apocalypse amen the
[1:10:13] book is not revealed to them they're not
[1:10:16] seeing the vision coming to pass they're
[1:10:19] not following the timeline they're
[1:10:21] looking at what they think is evil their
[1:10:24] vision
[1:10:25] of what is evil
[1:10:30] i find it interesting
[1:10:33] talk to a catholic
[1:10:36] that says monsanto is the antichrist
[1:10:40] now you don't have to like monsanto
[1:10:42] that's fine but you see my brother and
[1:10:45] sister they don't have revelation
[1:10:47] of what the underlying spirit is
[1:10:50] that's it
[1:10:52] they don't have revelation of what is
[1:10:54] what is what
[1:10:55] are you with me
[1:10:57] so
[1:10:58] john's seeing this vision
[1:11:00] but let's look at this there's a lot in
[1:11:02] the book of revelation that concerns the
[1:11:04] antichrist and the spirit in those
[1:11:06] churches and those people and what they
[1:11:08] will do and what they will say and how
[1:11:09] they will behave but let's focus my
[1:11:11] brother and sister on the portion of the
[1:11:14] book of revelation this is john's vision
[1:11:16] that he has written out and that come
[1:11:19] from god and now we're looking this uh
[1:11:22] the only part that really should matter
[1:11:23] to you is in this vision john sees the
[1:11:27] bride
[1:11:28] john saw the bride a living breathing
[1:11:32] people not figurative not historical but
[1:11:35] a living breathing people that were
[1:11:38] manifesting the word of god for their
[1:11:40] day that's what the whole vision was
[1:11:42] about my brother and sister the vision
[1:11:44] was not to warn you of what will be the
[1:11:46] antichrist because god promptly said
[1:11:49] i'll be with you right that means he's
[1:11:51] here
[1:11:52] i'll be in you amen that means he's here
[1:11:56] to the end
[1:11:58] to the end come on saints
[1:12:00] somebody get excited about this you
[1:12:02] might be struggling with things in life
[1:12:04] you might have discouragements you might
[1:12:06] have whatever but he said you can look
[1:12:08] down to the end and i'll be there
[1:12:13] and not just as a witness i'll be in you
[1:12:16] in other words do you know what that
[1:12:17] means
[1:12:18] that means that you carried christ
[1:12:22] as though you were birthing
[1:12:24] a child
[1:12:26] you carried christ
[1:12:28] to the end
[1:12:30] it's in you
[1:12:31] and it's living
[1:12:33] it's not aborted
[1:12:35] it's not dead
[1:12:36] it's alive
[1:12:39] hallelujah
[1:12:41] you see john's seeing the bride john saw
[1:12:43] you
[1:12:44] imagine now look
[1:12:46] some people say this is a bit too far
[1:12:48] for their taste and that is just fine
[1:12:50] but did you know when the prophet of god
[1:12:52] went
[1:12:53] beyond the curtain of time right have
[1:12:55] you read that story enough to really be
[1:12:57] able to just recount it in your mind
[1:12:58] right now if you haven't go back and
[1:13:00] read it again you see when the prophet
[1:13:02] went beyond the curtain of time and he's
[1:13:05] there and these multitude of people now
[1:13:08] people focus on all these sisters and
[1:13:10] there was no physical attraction no
[1:13:13] whatever and they hugged him and all of
[1:13:15] this they get all this but my brother
[1:13:17] and sister do you realize the prophet of
[1:13:18] god what he's seeing there is seeing the
[1:13:21] bride amen now he's seeing the saints of
[1:13:24] the ages right we don't have an
[1:13:26] exclusive right because of laodicea as
[1:13:28] the bride
[1:13:29] see the bride is all those through the
[1:13:31] ages that god gathered together so he's
[1:13:33] seeing the bride and in that realm of
[1:13:36] the bride the prophet of god get this
[1:13:38] now the prophet of god is speaking in a
[1:13:40] present tense because he's speaking of
[1:13:43] that 90 some year old woman that sister
[1:13:46] that he led to the lord she's there so
[1:13:48] this is not my brother and sister just
[1:13:50] the saints of ages gone by but this was
[1:13:53] a very present time a very present uh of
[1:13:57] vision or revelation to the prophet now
[1:13:59] my brother and sister let me exp
[1:14:01] exfoliate this and take this over the
[1:14:03] prophet of god has the vision and here
[1:14:05] comes the
[1:14:07] worldly church and she's mincing to the
[1:14:10] spirit
[1:14:11] of rock and roll
[1:14:14] it's not always about the music young
[1:14:15] people or maybe even old people that
[1:14:17] still have music problems
[1:14:19] there's a spirit behind it
[1:14:21] because if there wasn't a spirit behind
[1:14:23] it there wouldn't be that kind of music
[1:14:26] so it's there that you be careful please
[1:14:28] i just asked you as your brother as your
[1:14:30] friend as a pastor and be careful of the
[1:14:32] spirit of the music that you listen with
[1:14:34] you say well i only listen to christian
[1:14:36] music my brother and sister there's
[1:14:37] christian music
[1:14:39] now i hope you find the humor in this
[1:14:41] there's christian music
[1:14:43] that i'm listening to
[1:14:45] not directly or intentional or every day
[1:14:48] because i just not a music person
[1:14:51] but i'm hearing that
[1:14:55] and
[1:14:56] you know what happens
[1:14:57] i spent my time in the world
[1:15:01] the words that go through my mind to
[1:15:03] that music
[1:15:05] are not
[1:15:07] christian words
[1:15:11] you say well brother paul there's only
[1:15:12] so much music to put it to
[1:15:15] the spirit
[1:15:16] behind it
[1:15:20] and i'll get in trouble and rightfully
[1:15:23] so if i start hunting or speaking
[1:15:25] anything out
[1:15:26] and i don't want to be i don't want to
[1:15:28] be punished for that
[1:15:30] but you see my brother and sister what
[1:15:31] they've done satan is so clever
[1:15:34] he just put new words on the same spirit
[1:15:36] and the same music and the same beat
[1:15:39] and called it new music called it
[1:15:40] christian
[1:15:42] amen that you listen to it
[1:15:45] and it will bring the same spirit
[1:15:47] that it would whether it was of these
[1:15:50] others and i'm trying to restrain myself
[1:15:53] from even naming names
[1:15:55] but you see my brother and sister it's
[1:15:57] that spirit it don't matter the words
[1:15:59] that's put to it
[1:16:00] it's the spirit that underlines or
[1:16:03] carries it
[1:16:04] and so that's what satan has done he's
[1:16:06] put these new words and called it
[1:16:08] christian but my brother and sister it
[1:16:10] never brings the spirit of god you want
[1:16:12] to judge the music you're listening to
[1:16:14] you listen to that and see if it
[1:16:16] actually truly speaks of jesus christ
[1:16:18] lord and savior and actually brings the
[1:16:20] presence of god to you and if it doesn't
[1:16:23] do that my brother and sister you know
[1:16:25] there's some of this music out here
[1:16:26] don't know why i'm on this but some of
[1:16:27] this music out here that's called
[1:16:29] christian music you listen to it
[1:16:31] objectively and you will find it does
[1:16:33] not speak specifically of one thing
[1:16:36] concerning god
[1:16:39] it's a lot of repetitive words that
[1:16:41] makes you feel good it gets you in the
[1:16:43] mood it gets you in the motion it gets
[1:16:46] you into the deal and people jump and
[1:16:48] shout and twirl and raise their hands
[1:16:50] but my brother and sister that same
[1:16:52] words could be then spoke of the devil
[1:16:54] and would bring the exact same results
[1:17:04] you see this vision that john saw
[1:17:06] concerning the bride john's seen you
[1:17:08] oh let me take this back i got
[1:17:10] sidetracked there
[1:17:11] amen
[1:17:13] look when the prophet of god looks out
[1:17:15] there and he sees the worldly church and
[1:17:17] he comes and they are mincing young
[1:17:19] ladies i'm going to speak just real bold
[1:17:21] this is why brother paul is very much
[1:17:23] against the high heels the prophet of
[1:17:24] god was against the high heels and you
[1:17:26] do this but you look in the vision
[1:17:30] are you with me is it okay this is not
[1:17:32] my vision
[1:17:33] but the prophet of god said he saw that
[1:17:35] christian church and they were mincing
[1:17:39] they were walking in such a fashion
[1:17:41] anyway i won't go there
[1:17:48] there was something seductive about it
[1:17:52] okay i might miss this forgive me
[1:17:55] i'm just getting i realize i'm just
[1:17:56] getting a little old
[1:17:58] but i tell you what you take the same
[1:18:00] girl
[1:18:01] you put her in a pair of flat
[1:18:03] type shoes i'm not talking i'm not
[1:18:05] against heels just be reasonable
[1:18:08] you put it in that and then you put them
[1:18:09] in some big old toe heels and video it
[1:18:12] moms
[1:18:13] if you want your daughters to know what
[1:18:14] they look like you put them in a pair of
[1:18:16] flat shoes and you video them walking
[1:18:18] and then you put them in a set of high
[1:18:19] heels right before you throw them in the
[1:18:21] dumpster and uh you video how they walk
[1:18:23] in them high heels and you'll see there
[1:18:25] is a change
[1:18:26] same girl
[1:18:28] might be the same girl reading her bible
[1:18:30] you know praising the lord thanking god
[1:18:32] for good but there is a change that
[1:18:34] comes with that i don't know where that
[1:18:35] come from that was free today but you
[1:18:37] look at this my brother said it's the
[1:18:39] spirit behind it and john has a vision
[1:18:42] and what he's seeing is the bride of
[1:18:44] christ and here comes the worldly church
[1:18:46] he's mincing along amen barely covered
[1:18:50] horribly i just you know we see that and
[1:18:52] brother branham's grieved in his heart
[1:18:54] and he's like oh lord is this all my
[1:18:57] ministry has produced is this all the
[1:18:59] preaching of the word that god is
[1:19:01] gracious that we then see oh this real
[1:19:04] bride of christ dressed as it was in
[1:19:06] their native clothes amen which is going
[1:19:08] to be with the bride of christ holiness
[1:19:10] regardless of what you call native it's
[1:19:12] hopeliness my brother and sister the
[1:19:14] prophet of god talking about being in
[1:19:15] africa and preaching and there is those
[1:19:18] blanket natives that are naked they
[1:19:20] didn't know any different they're just
[1:19:21] what they are them sisters they're just
[1:19:23] dressed that's life this is the way
[1:19:25] history has been forever but at the
[1:19:27] preaching of the word covered themselves
[1:19:29] up
[1:19:30] and so god dealing with that and when
[1:19:32] god saw he sees a bride and what's she
[1:19:34] doing
[1:19:34] she's not
[1:19:37] i won't mention names i said i wasn't
[1:19:39] going to
[1:19:40] she's not listening to modern
[1:19:43] christian music
[1:19:46] she's not listening to satan's
[1:19:48] version christian music
[1:19:52] she's listening or singing
[1:19:55] onward christian soldier
[1:19:57] why because she identified who she was
[1:19:59] she knows who she is i'm not a spectator
[1:20:01] i'm a soldier
[1:20:03] i was called to fight and i have fought
[1:20:05] the good fight of faith can we say that
[1:20:06] testimony i have fought the good fight
[1:20:09] of faith
[1:20:10] amen
[1:20:13] because you see this vision
[1:20:15] is so much greater than satan wants it
[1:20:18] to be to you
[1:20:20] you see if satan can just keep this
[1:20:23] and intellectual eyes
[1:20:26] if he can intellectualize
[1:20:28] the word to us
[1:20:31] if he can formalize
[1:20:33] the message that's right turn it into an
[1:20:35] old cold letter
[1:20:37] that's it
[1:20:38] you know what i'm afraid saints look i'm
[1:20:40] going to be a little blunt today forgive
[1:20:41] me but i'm afraid too many of us
[1:20:44] have a little checklist
[1:20:46] i've done that
[1:20:49] there's no moving of the spirit there's
[1:20:51] no outpouring of the holy spirit there's
[1:20:53] no sincerity and and dedication and uh
[1:20:57] you know
[1:20:58] surrendering of ourselves we just i did
[1:21:00] this
[1:21:01] and i did this
[1:21:03] and i did this and i did this until oh
[1:21:06] it's all done
[1:21:08] that's not what it's about
[1:21:10] it's about the outpouring of the holy
[1:21:12] spirit in our life amen which is christ
[1:21:15] himself the word made living
[1:21:18] amen so satan's trying to
[1:21:20] intellectualize this to us he's trying
[1:21:22] to formalize it to us
[1:21:25] where we just say i went to church
[1:21:29] i participated
[1:21:31] amen i sang every song they sang when
[1:21:33] they clapped i clapped when they did all
[1:21:35] this and you know what that is bringing
[1:21:37] about that's called the traditionalizing
[1:21:39] of the deal
[1:21:40] oh when we come to do this
[1:21:44] we do this
[1:21:45] and when this happens we do this
[1:21:48] and and uh
[1:21:50] well
[1:21:51] look i'm not against this saint you
[1:21:52] ought to know by now i don't know why i
[1:21:54] shouldn't even defend myself here
[1:21:56] but when we come to the point that we
[1:21:58] can only sing three songs and then
[1:21:59] introduce the minister and this and that
[1:22:01] because that's what it says in church
[1:22:02] order
[1:22:03] we've totally lost what the prophet of
[1:22:05] god was talking about he was talking
[1:22:07] about the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:22:10] not turning the pre-service into a giant
[1:22:13] specials and song service and i'm going
[1:22:15] to sing so people will see me today and
[1:22:17] i'm going to do this and we're going to
[1:22:18] do that and we're going to tell folk
[1:22:20] stories and give history amen i've got
[1:22:22] some stories to share with you i would
[1:22:24] love burning in my heart the grace of
[1:22:26] god what he's doing but you see we have
[1:22:28] to do those things at the right time in
[1:22:30] the right order
[1:22:31] we don't just do it because we feel like
[1:22:34] it
[1:22:35] amen so you see satan wanted to
[1:22:37] traditionalize amen in other words we
[1:22:40] could publish a message-wide book on how
[1:22:43] to hold church
[1:22:45] oh wait we already have that
[1:22:47] it's what people have done to the church
[1:22:49] order book
[1:22:52] you guys sing too many songs
[1:22:54] your pre-service is too long
[1:22:57] the prophet of god said you could preach
[1:22:59] 15 20 30 minutes and the people come
[1:23:02] prayed up they would get it
[1:23:04] well good sometimes we have to preach 15
[1:23:07] 20 30 minutes just to break the ice
[1:23:11] so those that are criticizing at least
[1:23:13] the time of the service and how that is
[1:23:15] going too long don't realize it took
[1:23:17] that long to break through their
[1:23:19] laodicean shell they brought to church
[1:23:21] [Music]
[1:23:23] see we've got to get it right and i'm
[1:23:24] not preaching against your anxious
[1:23:26] saints i'm just telling you
[1:23:28] amen so it comes down to we've we're
[1:23:30] traditionalizing you know what
[1:23:31] traditionalizing was it's a sign
[1:23:34] of a denominational spirit entering in
[1:23:41] now this church triumphant that john was
[1:23:43] preaching to right john wasn't speaking
[1:23:46] to the church defeated was he
[1:23:48] and we didn't come here this morning i
[1:23:50] pray as the church defeated we come here
[1:23:53] as a church triumphant today amen you
[1:23:55] don't have to lift your hand but i hope
[1:23:57] you can lift it in your heart and say
[1:23:58] absolutely i come today and was not
[1:24:01] bound by the spirit of laodicea when i
[1:24:03] come to church this morning amen i am
[1:24:06] triumphant amen so john is speaking of
[1:24:09] these things and what is he seeing he's
[1:24:11] seeing the church triumphant is also
[1:24:14] seeing because of the word and the
[1:24:16] nature of god the church triumphant is
[1:24:18] seeing the unfolding of the word just as
[1:24:21] john saw the unfolding of the word and
[1:24:24] he wrote it i want to ask you this
[1:24:26] morning maybe i'm being blunt what would
[1:24:28] you write when you look at the vision
[1:24:36] pretty quiet around here
[1:24:39] your vision of who you are as a message
[1:24:41] believer
[1:24:43] if it was asked to be put to the page
[1:24:45] what would you write
[1:24:48] we should be able to write i am
[1:24:56] sad discouraged
[1:25:00] weak
[1:25:03] no sir
[1:25:05] i am triumphant
[1:25:08] i am an overcomer
[1:25:10] i
[1:25:11] am the word
[1:25:13] made flesh
[1:25:15] on september
[1:25:17] 19th
[1:25:19] 2021 amen and i will be the same
[1:25:23] tomorrow morning and the morning after
[1:25:25] in the morning after and the morning
[1:25:27] after that is my story this is my song
[1:25:31] this is my story
[1:25:33] hallelujah
[1:25:36] amen
[1:25:38] you know what's happening
[1:25:39] satan's coming
[1:25:41] you know believe it or not it was
[1:25:42] actually quite pretty i'll use it for an
[1:25:44] example you know after it rained the
[1:25:45] other day
[1:25:47] the very next morning
[1:25:48] looking out from behind our house
[1:25:51] just a fog bank going up through the
[1:25:53] little draw little valley right there
[1:25:55] just to fog back
[1:25:56] you couldn't see anywhere
[1:26:01] you know too many of us walk around with
[1:26:02] our head
[1:26:03] in a fog bank
[1:26:05] because satan
[1:26:06] is doing his best
[1:26:08] to cloud your vision
[1:26:11] i i couldn't possibly be the bride i
[1:26:14] couldn't possibly be victorious i
[1:26:16] couldn't because if i was honest with
[1:26:18] you see sometimes it's good we're
[1:26:19] supposed to share you know our faults
[1:26:21] with one another but sometimes it's
[1:26:23] probably good that we're not that honest
[1:26:25] because otherwise we'd be speaking the
[1:26:26] devil's language all the time i failed
[1:26:29] here i failed there and i snapped at the
[1:26:31] wife and i snapped at the children i
[1:26:33] snapped at the husband i snapped at the
[1:26:34] children i think my mom and dad are
[1:26:36] horrible
[1:26:41] why because our vision is clouded
[1:26:44] all we're doing is looking right here
[1:26:46] we're struggling to even see
[1:26:49] what this is all about saints and satan
[1:26:51] don't mind that you believe the message
[1:26:52] and you believe god sent a prophet satan
[1:26:54] don't mind any of that if he can cloud
[1:26:56] your vision to what the true uh vision
[1:26:59] or the true prophecy was for our day
[1:27:03] amen so you see
[1:27:05] brother brown shows us clearly through
[1:27:06] the word that god interprets his own
[1:27:08] word by bringing it to pass now the fact
[1:27:11] that you're sitting here this morning
[1:27:12] and you have a desire to serve god is
[1:27:14] the word coming to pass in the day that
[1:27:16] we live in because satan is doing his
[1:27:19] very best to bring us to a place now
[1:27:21] come on i think somebody will probably
[1:27:23] have to say amen if you really believe
[1:27:25] this in your heart every one of us comes
[1:27:27] against obstacles that we don't have a
[1:27:29] clue how we're going to deal with it and
[1:27:31] we feel like we failed the the the trial
[1:27:34] we feel like we come so short of this
[1:27:36] and we look at that and if we're not
[1:27:38] careful we dwell on that can someone say
[1:27:40] amen we dwell on those things and that
[1:27:44] is not god's vision of who you are that
[1:27:47] is satan's vision of who you are and
[1:27:50] he's clouding your vision that all you
[1:27:53] see is someone who continually falls
[1:27:55] short of what god has called them to do
[1:27:58] but there's that spark that's down in
[1:27:59] the soul there's something that's
[1:28:01] stirring us and we can't quit we can't
[1:28:03] walk away we can't lay down and give
[1:28:06] satan a victory we're gonna stand
[1:28:08] because there's something that's in you
[1:28:11] amen and so god is interpreting his word
[1:28:14] in your life by bringing the very life
[1:28:16] of christ to stand as a pillar in the
[1:28:19] laodicean age the word says to those
[1:28:22] that overcome
[1:28:24] will i make a trash can in the house of
[1:28:26] god no sir he said i will make them a
[1:28:30] pillar
[1:28:32] what is a pillar is not blown by winds
[1:28:34] of doctrine a pillar is not tossed to
[1:28:36] the side a pillar is an integral part of
[1:28:39] the very structure of the building of
[1:28:41] the church of almighty god and god said
[1:28:44] i'm going to put you right there in my
[1:28:46] house and i'm going to make you solid
[1:28:49] and strong to stand the test of time
[1:28:52] amen and when so many are falling away
[1:28:55] my brother and sister you look at this
[1:28:58] come on i don't want to speak negative
[1:28:59] of them i don't i pray they come back
[1:29:02] but my brother and sister if you are not
[1:29:04] a pillar in other words an overcomer
[1:29:07] the day will come
[1:29:09] when the perfect storm
[1:29:13] will toss you to the side that's right
[1:29:18] and you say i wasted my whole life i've
[1:29:20] heard it out of their mouths i wasted
[1:29:23] 30 years
[1:29:24] of my life
[1:29:26] following this message
[1:29:30] what is that
[1:29:32] somewhere along the line they never got
[1:29:34] serious enough with god
[1:29:36] and dug in to the vision
[1:29:39] to realize who they were
[1:29:42] because you see my brother and sister
[1:29:44] this message
[1:29:45] now i don't hold don't hold me
[1:29:47] judgmental to these words
[1:29:49] this message
[1:29:50] is not about all these doctrines
[1:29:53] it's not about god sending a prophet
[1:29:55] it's not about all of this and that and
[1:29:57] what church and what part of the world
[1:29:59] and how big these things are and how
[1:30:01] well we're known
[1:30:02] this message is all about you
[1:30:06] seeing who you are
[1:30:09] in jesus christ
[1:30:10] because if you never see that
[1:30:14] you will never see the true vision of
[1:30:17] the word revealed in our day you have to
[1:30:21] see who
[1:30:22] you are
[1:30:24] oh our pastor he's this most spiritual
[1:30:26] man i will do you a bit of good
[1:30:28] won't do you a bit of good he could be a
[1:30:31] holy ghost-filled man the power of god
[1:30:33] dwelling in him exuding that everywhere
[1:30:35] he goes but if you don't see who you are
[1:30:38] all you'll be able to do is acknowledge
[1:30:40] how great they are
[1:30:41] and the only one we're supposed to
[1:30:43] acknowledge how great he is is christ
[1:30:45] and the word says christ in you is the
[1:30:47] hope of glory
[1:30:48] hallelujah see so we look at this he's
[1:30:51] trying to do this now amen don't let
[1:30:54] satan interpret the word for you
[1:30:57] you know it's interesting let me just
[1:30:59] use this little example
[1:31:00] meet him one man walks out
[1:31:03] says he
[1:31:04] called me a buzzer
[1:31:08] and then you walked out
[1:31:10] someone say amen
[1:31:12] then you walk out and you're happy hope
[1:31:14] you don't mind a little dancing i'm not
[1:31:16] trying to become some pentecostal but
[1:31:18] i'm telling you as i get older it's just
[1:31:19] a little harder to keep from just
[1:31:21] getting loose in the joints and oh thank
[1:31:23] you lord because i walked out you've
[1:31:25] walked out and our testimony our vision
[1:31:28] was he called me an eagle
[1:31:31] hallelujah i'm not a buzzard i'm an
[1:31:34] eagle
[1:31:35] oh people all that
[1:31:37] yeah well that was just a point he was
[1:31:38] trying to make i think it's revelation
[1:31:41] i think it's revelation because too many
[1:31:42] people be i'm a churchgoer
[1:31:45] sorry i don't care you're a church-goer
[1:31:47] you're either a buzzard or an eagle
[1:31:49] because there's only two spirits in the
[1:31:52] church
[1:31:53] and you're eating the dead things
[1:31:55] or you're eating a living word
[1:31:58] hallelujah
[1:32:00] well
[1:32:01] amen don't satan interpret the word deal
[1:32:04] and don't let him mold your vision
[1:32:06] that's right have you ever had any
[1:32:08] setbacks
[1:32:12] come on somebody can say amen to that
[1:32:15] have you ever i want to get down and
[1:32:16] just dig right in your rubbish pile
[1:32:19] have any of you ever yesterday
[1:32:23] fought said
[1:32:24] watched read did
[1:32:27] and then today
[1:32:29] the wheel falls off the car
[1:32:32] and you're like
[1:32:34] god's punishing me
[1:32:36] for yesterday
[1:32:41] well there's a few honest people around
[1:32:46] you know god doesn't work that way no
[1:32:49] sir
[1:32:51] praise the lord
[1:32:53] did say well
[1:32:55] yeah lucifer
[1:32:59] that one right there inside the hedge
[1:33:03] you can do everything you want to him
[1:33:06] oh how many of you want to be a job
[1:33:12] i don't see any hands i don't see any
[1:33:13] amens i don't see anybody jumping up and
[1:33:15] saying me lord
[1:33:18] but i want to be a job regardless of
[1:33:19] what comes with it why because god said
[1:33:23] my servant job
[1:33:25] will stand the test
[1:33:28] i have confidence in my servant job and
[1:33:32] you can do anything you want but take
[1:33:34] his life
[1:33:35] hallelujah you know what that wasn't god
[1:33:37] trying to see if a social experiment
[1:33:39] would work that's a god with confidence
[1:33:41] and he knew that joe would sit there and
[1:33:44] go my what's happening to me why did i
[1:33:47] do wrong and all these friends you
[1:33:48] secret sinner you did this you must have
[1:33:50] done that and job my brother and sister
[1:33:52] read the words you'll see for a little
[1:33:54] season he believed
[1:33:56] but god said now my servant job is flesh
[1:33:58] he's human that's right and so what i'm
[1:34:01] going to do is come down at the right
[1:34:02] time i could sit back and say we'll just
[1:34:05] see what god what's going to happen here
[1:34:07] whether he'll continue to serve me
[1:34:10] what's he going to do
[1:34:12] god knew
[1:34:13] what he do
[1:34:14] the right time he put just a little word
[1:34:17] down to job
[1:34:18] job my servant
[1:34:20] where
[1:34:22] were you amen
[1:34:26] thank you lord
[1:34:28] hallelujah in a minute we're going to
[1:34:30] get if i'll just preach and be quiet
[1:34:32] we'll get to the point of where were you
[1:34:35] amen hallelujah
[1:34:36] well you know what satan interprets the
[1:34:38] word or tries to interpret it to you
[1:34:40] he's trying to mold your veer and i hear
[1:34:42] people say
[1:34:43] oh i'm sorry to bring this out this way
[1:34:46] but i hear people say i do this because
[1:34:49] of
[1:34:50] this
[1:34:51] i'm living like i do because of this i'm
[1:34:55] doing what is because of this i am
[1:34:59] living or doing what i'm doing because
[1:35:02] of a bad ministry that i set under
[1:35:08] i do this because the ministry i sit
[1:35:11] under
[1:35:12] is so wonderful
[1:35:18] have you ever noticed
[1:35:21] that when you have a service
[1:35:24] evangelist been down on his face praying
[1:35:28] anointed of god to bring a word
[1:35:31] and his word to you
[1:35:34] is praise god we're the bride we're
[1:35:35] overcomers we're strong the devil's
[1:35:37] defeated he's underneath my feet and
[1:35:39] people just jump oh praise god
[1:35:41] hallelujah and aisles are full and the
[1:35:43] people oh praise god i just love this
[1:35:45] ministry i feel so strong
[1:35:48] in a month or two another evangelist
[1:35:50] comes that's got a different anointing
[1:35:52] and he says it's time for you to get in
[1:35:54] your closet under your bed and get the
[1:35:56] sin out the reason god's not moving in
[1:35:58] your midst is because of the little
[1:36:00] things and all them people that were in
[1:36:03] the aisle dancing
[1:36:05] oh praise god just love this
[1:36:08] you don't hear a single word
[1:36:11] out of them
[1:36:14] why
[1:36:14] one anointed the spirit
[1:36:17] and the other one is dealing with the
[1:36:19] actual soul
[1:36:20] amen and one give them a vision how
[1:36:23] glorious they are with the true vision
[1:36:25] see both of these brothers preach the
[1:36:27] truth
[1:36:28] but the other one
[1:36:29] says look
[1:36:31] you've got to keep
[1:36:33] if my wife was sitting here i would use
[1:36:35] it for an example just not quite the
[1:36:37] same in a wafer but
[1:36:39] the other one
[1:36:41] says i want you to pull up the hymn
[1:36:44] and i want to see if your hymn's clean
[1:36:45] or not
[1:36:47] because
[1:36:49] the true bride's vision
[1:36:51] is not even one smudge
[1:36:53] amen oh god help us
[1:36:56] god help us not even one smudge
[1:37:00] on the hem of our garment
[1:37:02] but we so love that ministry that's
[1:37:04] telling us we're all going in a rapture
[1:37:06] glorious hallelujah the devil's under
[1:37:08] our feet
[1:37:09] but the one who says i want you to look
[1:37:11] at the hem of your garment today every
[1:37:13] one of you i want you to look in the
[1:37:14] closet i want you to look under the bed
[1:37:16] i want you to get all the dust bunnies
[1:37:18] out of your life i want you to take the
[1:37:20] time to clean the hem of your garment
[1:37:22] and it's a little harder to deal with
[1:37:24] that because that doesn't really anoint
[1:37:26] us to sing and shout but it should
[1:37:30] it should
[1:37:31] because it's god loving you so much
[1:37:34] see we think the one is loving us so
[1:37:36] much and the other one's so hard on us
[1:37:38] he's legalists my brother and sister do
[1:37:40] you know the one over here that's
[1:37:42] correcting you is actually a greater
[1:37:44] sign of god's love to you because he
[1:37:47] wants you to be right he wants you to
[1:37:49] come and be able to be presentable to
[1:37:51] him he doesn't want to see you fail
[1:37:54] hallelujah
[1:37:56] let me go back to this i do it because
[1:37:59] of bad ministry
[1:38:00] i do it because our pastor our ministry
[1:38:02] is so awesome i do this because of
[1:38:05] someone so said to
[1:38:09] i do this
[1:38:12] because the word
[1:38:13] said
[1:38:14] to
[1:38:16] that should be our resting place
[1:38:18] bad ministry i don't know about your
[1:38:20] history
[1:38:22] i think i could be like the apostle paul
[1:38:25] amongst you
[1:38:27] i have seen it all
[1:38:29] i've heard it all
[1:38:30] i've experienced it all
[1:38:32] and i wanted to quit i thought i had
[1:38:35] quit i ran away i come back i gotta see
[1:38:37] it happen all over again
[1:38:41] and i couldn't quite
[1:38:45] because if it was about bad ministry
[1:38:47] i don't know where i'd be
[1:38:52] oh i
[1:38:53] i don't think it was my nature i won't
[1:38:55] be out here in a bar room or a dance
[1:38:56] hall
[1:38:57] i'd probably be on a dirt bike or a jet
[1:38:59] boat or you know up in the mountains
[1:39:01] somewhere on a four-wheeler
[1:39:05] you know worshiping god in the woods
[1:39:08] that's a doctrine in the message
[1:39:11] i'm telling you it's a doctor and messy
[1:39:12] i'm not talking about going camping
[1:39:13] going hunting those things i'm talking
[1:39:15] about those people are like no i don't
[1:39:16] go to church because i i go up in the
[1:39:18] woods and i've got the message and i
[1:39:20] commune with god find me a scripture for
[1:39:22] that one
[1:39:26] i'm not stomping on anybody's toes and
[1:39:27] if i do let me know i'll step on them
[1:39:29] harder
[1:39:31] what i do this because the word says so
[1:39:34] that should be what motivates us now
[1:39:35] let's look at the absolute
[1:39:37] hope you guys didn't put a roast in the
[1:39:38] oven
[1:39:40] the absolute brothers
[1:39:42] amen
[1:39:43] now look at this how did michaela know
[1:39:46] he was right
[1:39:47] he waited
[1:39:49] he had a vision they had a vision too
[1:39:51] but the vision didn't compare with the
[1:39:53] word
[1:39:54] and today the same thing see brother
[1:39:56] brown takes us out of history puts it
[1:39:58] right back in our day and so michaela
[1:40:01] knew he was right because he waited and
[1:40:04] he had a vision but they had a vision
[1:40:06] too
[1:40:07] i tell you what if i had a dollar for
[1:40:09] every time somebody's told me well i
[1:40:11] prayed about it and the lord told me to
[1:40:12] do this
[1:40:14] and you can sit there dumbfounded and
[1:40:15] say um that's contrary to the scripture
[1:40:17] but you see they won't move this there's
[1:40:19] a young man i i cared about him very
[1:40:21] much had a connection with him all the
[1:40:23] years and and he had got divorced and
[1:40:25] was going to get remarried and to a
[1:40:27] divorced woman and i i begged him in the
[1:40:30] name of jesus christ don't do this
[1:40:33] and he looked me in the face and said
[1:40:35] you don't know what god's doing in my
[1:40:37] life
[1:40:39] but i know what the word says
[1:40:42] see i i don't know honestly i don't know
[1:40:44] what's happening in your life but i know
[1:40:46] what the word says
[1:40:49] see so it becomes very difficult and
[1:40:51] people say they feel like they've got a
[1:40:53] green light i prayed about this my
[1:40:55] brother and sister the division man
[1:40:59] and today the same thing make a paired
[1:41:02] his vision with the word and then he
[1:41:04] seen he and the word was together today
[1:41:07] if your vision is contrary to the word
[1:41:09] leave it alone because it's the wrong
[1:41:12] absolute michael's absolute was exactly
[1:41:15] with the word so he could stand and say
[1:41:17] he and what he said and believe it
[1:41:21] i like that
[1:41:23] you know i'm
[1:41:24] really sad to say this and i don't want
[1:41:26] you to feel sorry for me
[1:41:28] but i had a brother tell me brother paul
[1:41:30] you're getting a reputation as a
[1:41:31] hardliner
[1:41:33] legalist
[1:41:36] am i a legalist church
[1:41:43] i don't think i
[1:41:44] am you know why i couldn't speak with
[1:41:47] confidence and say i'm not a legalist
[1:41:51] because i'm only saying
[1:41:54] i'm only saying
[1:41:56] amen
[1:41:58] remember i joked here a few years ago
[1:42:00] about
[1:42:01] the deal i got in the mail the church
[1:42:04] building program
[1:42:06] just three simple payments of i forget
[1:42:08] what it was 675 dollars through three
[1:42:10] simple payments
[1:42:12] triple the size of your church in a few
[1:42:14] months on the program
[1:42:19] i could give you names
[1:42:22] of message people
[1:42:25] they said brother paul we're going to
[1:42:26] move to idaho and attend your church
[1:42:30] and this moment right now
[1:42:33] they don't even serve god
[1:42:37] now you might think i'm a hardliner all
[1:42:39] right when i say thank you lord they
[1:42:40] never moved here
[1:42:42] because then we just have to go through
[1:42:44] the grieving process
[1:42:46] of them
[1:42:47] leaving
[1:42:48] and walking away from the word of god
[1:42:51] you don't think god's hand of mercy is
[1:42:53] upon us
[1:42:54] god's hand of mercy is upon us saints
[1:42:57] why because we're going to take a stand
[1:42:59] and we'll stand with that long enough
[1:43:01] that we can with all of our hearts amen
[1:43:03] not with some little doubt that's
[1:43:05] hanging in the background about is this
[1:43:06] the truth but we know because it lines
[1:43:09] up with the word hallelujah now you see
[1:43:12] let's see god's
[1:43:13] god's vision of you let's just go real
[1:43:16] quick into uh
[1:43:18] oh did i skip over that
[1:43:20] amen
[1:43:22] one was the absolute perseverant let's
[1:43:24] let's do this i want to just reiterate
[1:43:25] this sorry you see perseverant brother
[1:43:27] brown once again says uh when there was
[1:43:30] 400 well-dressed prophets standing there
[1:43:32] saying to ahab and them go up the lord's
[1:43:34] with you michael said go on up if you
[1:43:36] want to but the lord told me and i seen
[1:43:38] israel scattered like sheep on a hill
[1:43:40] and let me just say this saints i i want
[1:43:43] to drive this home to you you'll know
[1:43:44] where i'm at i don't want to see you
[1:43:46] scattered i want to see you gathered
[1:43:48] around the word of god i don't want to
[1:43:49] see you going helter skelter because
[1:43:51] this was a flavor that you lack and
[1:43:53] that's a flavor that you like we ought
[1:43:55] to be men and women enough to stand on
[1:43:57] the word and hold on to the truth even
[1:43:59] if we have to say ouch
[1:44:02] i see israel scattered like sheep on a
[1:44:04] hill why when 400 prophets prophesying
[1:44:07] contrary to what he was how could he be
[1:44:10] so sure because his vision compared with
[1:44:13] the word of god that's the reason he
[1:44:15] noted oh how i wish i had about an hour
[1:44:18] now to preach right there if your vision
[1:44:21] don't compare with the word forget about
[1:44:24] your vision
[1:44:27] my name's not jim jones
[1:44:29] i'm not taking you down to always get
[1:44:31] them mixed up diana
[1:44:34] yeah guyana
[1:44:37] and when everything's falling apart i'm
[1:44:38] not going to ask you to drink the
[1:44:40] lemonade
[1:44:42] why
[1:44:44] because the word
[1:44:46] won't let us go there
[1:44:49] this is not a man's idea this is not a
[1:44:52] man's program this will not be a man who
[1:44:55] makes this fulfill or fail
[1:44:58] it is god himself he said i've come in
[1:45:00] laodicea i hope you catch this i've come
[1:45:03] in laodicea to take you
[1:45:05] to the promised land no different than
[1:45:08] coming down to egypt into goshen and
[1:45:10] saying i have come to deliver my people
[1:45:13] he has made the same covenant covenant
[1:45:16] in the day that we live and i've come to
[1:45:17] deliver my people amen all we have to do
[1:45:20] is catch god's vision and we will see
[1:45:22] exactly what's going on amen god has a
[1:45:24] can anyone show me scripture where god
[1:45:27] ever was sloppy
[1:45:32] did god ever lower the standard
[1:45:34] no sir
[1:45:35] the priests
[1:45:37] walked into the holiest of holies and if
[1:45:40] everything was not in order
[1:45:43] you want to know the attention to detail
[1:45:44] that be there
[1:45:46] you know how men we stand our wives will
[1:45:48] say well how do i look
[1:45:51] sometimes there's no right answer
[1:45:57] but if you knew it was life and death
[1:46:00] you'd be telling your wife
[1:46:03] i don't think that's appropriate that's
[1:46:04] right
[1:46:05] but it is life and death
[1:46:07] yes sir
[1:46:09] imagine
[1:46:11] the high priest
[1:46:12] going into the whole list of hopeless
[1:46:14] how he must have stood there with his
[1:46:16] contemporaries and so brothers go down
[1:46:19] through the list what did god say
[1:46:21] we have the thread we have this we have
[1:46:24] the pomegranates we have this we've been
[1:46:26] anointed with the oil it's dripping off
[1:46:28] of our head down our beard running down
[1:46:30] and dripping on the floor everything is
[1:46:32] over
[1:46:37] and the final
[1:46:39] must have
[1:46:40] christ himself
[1:46:42] upon him amen
[1:46:45] you know what their solution was
[1:46:48] knowing
[1:46:49] that anyone unclean
[1:46:51] cannot go in there
[1:46:55] instead of having tradition
[1:46:58] of perfection in christ
[1:47:00] we tie a rope
[1:47:03] around their right foot
[1:47:05] so we can drag them back out
[1:47:09] would it be much better
[1:47:12] that we would look
[1:47:13] through god's word
[1:47:15] and say lord i caught your vision that's
[1:47:17] it you don't want me to look like leo to
[1:47:18] see you you don't want me to act like a
[1:47:20] legacy of talk like leo to see a sing
[1:47:22] like leo to see him you don't want me to
[1:47:23] dance like laodicea you don't want me
[1:47:25] and people go oh it's this old-fashioned
[1:47:27] yeah it is i'm sorry
[1:47:29] it's just really old-fashioned dates
[1:47:31] back
[1:47:32] before the foundation of the world
[1:47:33] that's pretty old-fashioned isn't it
[1:47:36] reason you know how i wished about about
[1:47:38] an hour
[1:47:40] if your vision don't compare with the
[1:47:41] forget about your vision
[1:47:43] when you know your vision is lined in
[1:47:46] the word
[1:47:47] you talk about a confident saints
[1:47:49] see now right along this my brother and
[1:47:51] sister will look let's see god's vision
[1:47:53] of you are we okay can i can i kind of
[1:47:55] finish this morning
[1:47:56] i i don't want to mess up anybody's
[1:47:58] plans but i'll tell you what my plans
[1:48:00] are to make a rapture and i got to feed
[1:48:01] on the word of god so i'll be ready
[1:48:03] strong enough to make it
[1:48:04] amen now when their eyes were opened
[1:48:06] they knew him brother branham says here
[1:48:08] he says and as i said last evening god
[1:48:11] has lauded that his scripture from the
[1:48:13] beginning before there was any time when
[1:48:15] he was eternal he he'll he is the
[1:48:18] eternal one now i want to say right here
[1:48:19] my brother and sister let me put this
[1:48:21] out this is god's vision of you
[1:48:24] okay this is not a man's this is not
[1:48:26] brother branham's this is god's vision
[1:48:29] he is the eternal
[1:48:31] there was any time when he was eternal
[1:48:33] his eternal one and when these things is
[1:48:36] happening now are only the attributes of
[1:48:38] god's thinking at first it has to be a
[1:48:40] thought then a word and a word when a
[1:48:43] thought expressed is a word and then
[1:48:46] it's spoken
[1:48:48] it has to happen amen amen
[1:48:51] we
[1:48:52] shall
[1:48:54] overcome
[1:48:56] i
[1:48:58] shall overcome
[1:49:02] by the blood
[1:49:04] of the lamb
[1:49:05] by the spoken word
[1:49:08] that's not the correct version
[1:49:12] but there comes a time that you have to
[1:49:14] speak
[1:49:16] and then it's spoken it has to happen
[1:49:17] and the whole thing is god unfolding
[1:49:20] himself in his attributes and then god
[1:49:22] being made material tangible that we can
[1:49:25] talk to speak with in his whole church
[1:49:28] body and everything therefore your name
[1:49:30] was in his thinking that's how you have
[1:49:33] eternal life you can't have it any other
[1:49:36] way
[1:49:37] you see we were in his thinking from
[1:49:39] before the foundation of the world my
[1:49:41] brother and sister this isn't just
[1:49:43] something happening here oh look with
[1:49:45] this message people have an established
[1:49:47] date for the message of the hour
[1:49:52] i understand human thinking brother
[1:49:54] brother branham's ministry started here
[1:49:57] 1933.
[1:50:00] i'm sorry
[1:50:01] the message i believe
[1:50:03] started
[1:50:04] before there was even an earth
[1:50:09] well
[1:50:10] see you can't have it no other way
[1:50:13] amen
[1:50:14] brothers clicked to the other side that
[1:50:16] quote
[1:50:18] if you got eternal life
[1:50:20] you can somebody read it for me
[1:50:25] if you got eternal life you
[1:50:27] always
[1:50:28] was
[1:50:30] see if otherwise you can't just say well
[1:50:32] i belong to church i do this no sir
[1:50:35] see this is back to it i belong to the
[1:50:37] church and that's why i do what i do
[1:50:39] because i belong to the church
[1:50:41] no i'm sorry
[1:50:43] i don't know why i'm going to say this
[1:50:45] lord do i shall i say this
[1:50:48] do you know if you were mormons
[1:50:52] they'd walk right down
[1:50:54] and they'd knock on your door
[1:50:58] god bless you brother
[1:51:00] our research shows you made a hundred
[1:51:02] and five thousand dollars last year
[1:51:05] give us your tithe
[1:51:09] most of you would rebel scream and
[1:51:10] hauler but you wouldn't if he was a
[1:51:12] mormon
[1:51:13] because according to mormon teaching you
[1:51:15] ain't making it to heaven unless you pay
[1:51:17] your tithe
[1:51:20] now look at the view of free moral
[1:51:22] agency
[1:51:23] god opens the door for you to decide
[1:51:25] what you want to do
[1:51:26] nobody's knocking on your door
[1:51:29] see so it isn't
[1:51:30] because i belong to the church that i do
[1:51:32] these things no sir
[1:51:34] eternal life never had uh he started to
[1:51:38] say beginning i'm quite sure anything
[1:51:40] that was eternal never did begin and
[1:51:42] cannot end so you were only in his
[1:51:45] thinking your name who you are and what
[1:51:48] you are that's the only way you could
[1:51:50] ever have eternal life because you
[1:51:52] always love i think i'm just gonna
[1:51:55] praise the lord
[1:51:56] i always was hallelujah it was not the
[1:52:00] day that i got over my rebellion it
[1:52:02] wasn't the day i did this the day i did
[1:52:05] that it was god's ordained plan that i
[1:52:08] always was a son of god hallelujah that
[1:52:12] ought to make you happy when you look
[1:52:13] back on yesterday or last week or
[1:52:15] whatever struggles you've had
[1:52:17] disappointment you've had how you
[1:52:19] critically thought about yourself and
[1:52:20] the devil's condemned you i want this to
[1:52:23] rise up in your thinking devil it wasn't
[1:52:26] just because of this is the reason i am
[1:52:28] it's because i always was part of god i
[1:52:32] always was his position he always
[1:52:35] claimed me
[1:52:36] and it won't be some failure on my part
[1:52:39] that will kick me out of the kingdom of
[1:52:40] god because the word will come and
[1:52:43] change me
[1:52:45] oh hallelujah
[1:52:47] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:52:49] oh
[1:52:51] you see
[1:52:53] the whole thing is
[1:52:54] god unfolding himself in his attributes
[1:52:58] god being made material
[1:53:02] now what's this deal around the message
[1:53:04] saints
[1:53:05] of these people that almost act like
[1:53:07] when brother branham's reading the word
[1:53:09] and talking about god in you that that's
[1:53:12] just a reference
[1:53:14] to the holy ghost and you have to
[1:53:16] reference it as the holy ghost it can't
[1:53:17] be any other fashion because he's
[1:53:21] he said how many times
[1:53:24] go look it up
[1:53:26] how many times
[1:53:28] the prophet of god speaks of
[1:53:30] god
[1:53:31] in you
[1:53:34] if it been once
[1:53:36] we might have put it off to a figure of
[1:53:37] speech
[1:53:39] twice repetition of the figure of speech
[1:53:44] in the hundreds
[1:53:46] i think he knew what he was talking
[1:53:47] about
[1:53:48] but yet there's spirit that has invaded
[1:53:51] the message
[1:53:55] you know what i think it is
[1:53:57] i think it's a denominational spirit
[1:54:01] i think it's people that want to be
[1:54:03] whatever they was before
[1:54:06] and
[1:54:07] believe the message at the same time
[1:54:10] amen
[1:54:12] that's right well hallelujah
[1:54:15] hallelujah
[1:54:18] this is what satan's trying to hide
[1:54:19] saints that's right he's trying to cloud
[1:54:21] your vision that if you ever had eternal
[1:54:24] life it's because you always was
[1:54:26] and the reason that you're here and you
[1:54:28] believe the word in your life has been
[1:54:30] changed is because god gave you eternal
[1:54:32] life you're not here by a mistake it's
[1:54:34] not some accident that you accidentally
[1:54:36] just got into this and i'm hanging out
[1:54:38] with this fellowship god's shaking those
[1:54:40] out
[1:54:41] do you know i do you want to know a
[1:54:42] timepiece
[1:54:45] would you like a little timepiece today
[1:54:46] not a deep revelation
[1:54:48] did you know that the first initial
[1:54:51] spirit that was amongst the apostles and
[1:54:53] amongst those early believers and those
[1:54:55] early preachers is when they saw a tear
[1:54:58] they wanted to go right out there
[1:55:02] and jerk that thing out of the ground
[1:55:04] and god says no don't do that don't do
[1:55:06] that
[1:55:07] lest
[1:55:08] while you jerked a tear out of the
[1:55:11] ground
[1:55:12] you would uproot
[1:55:14] the true wheat
[1:55:18] you want to know timepiece
[1:55:21] the tares
[1:55:23] have come to maturity
[1:55:27] it's where we're at saints the tares
[1:55:30] have come
[1:55:31] to maturity
[1:55:32] you know what that also means
[1:55:35] somebody speak it for me
[1:55:37] it means the wheat
[1:55:39] has also come
[1:55:41] to maturity
[1:55:42] we're no longer looking at green plants
[1:55:44] we're looking at people
[1:55:46] and you say brother paul you've been
[1:55:48] preaching harder and harder you've kind
[1:55:50] of been a little more critical brother
[1:55:51] paul that's right saints
[1:55:53] we're going to because the days of
[1:55:55] nonsense the days of all the immaturity
[1:55:58] all of that is now behind us
[1:56:01] and as the song says i can hear
[1:56:04] the combine
[1:56:11] let me just skip back so so we can move
[1:56:14] on
[1:56:16] you see
[1:56:18] this word my brother and sister is a
[1:56:19] supernatural vision it's empowering the
[1:56:22] bride
[1:56:23] this little
[1:56:24] look down on lady
[1:56:28] i got some friends that are just
[1:56:30] brutally outspoken
[1:56:34] not being disrespectful in a sense but
[1:56:36] just how they communicate
[1:56:40] they just can't believe
[1:56:44] paul
[1:56:46] why do you make your wife
[1:56:49] dress
[1:56:50] like she does
[1:56:53] and i'm getting a little blunt as i get
[1:56:55] older i'm sorry
[1:56:57] it's so she won't look like your wife

[1:57:10] 50 plus year old women
[1:57:12] 30 pounds overweight
[1:57:14] in spandex and flip flops
[1:57:17] and their daughter's t-shirt
[1:57:21] and they think they're attractive it's
[1:57:24] an anointing
[1:57:26] no one would go out in public now now
[1:57:28] forgive me i got i got just boiled and
[1:57:31] grilled and toasted and went up in
[1:57:34] flames over the fact that i said
[1:57:35] something about we're message believers
[1:57:37] and we fellowship around food and we're
[1:57:39] all fat
[1:57:41] i i got roasted over that
[1:57:43] i i didn't even remember ever saying
[1:57:45] that
[1:57:46] but i got roasted over that you call
[1:57:48] this all fat
[1:57:50] i'd uh okay i'm sorry
[1:57:52] i didn't mean it like that
[1:57:54] i didn't mean it like that
[1:57:56] but you see my brother and sister the
[1:57:58] spirit of the age what it's doing
[1:58:00] they don't see themselves according to
[1:58:01] the word they see themselves according
[1:58:03] tradition and their church has come to
[1:58:05] accept it i've told you about my friend
[1:58:07] larry and how their church has a break
[1:58:08] halfway through and he loves that break
[1:58:10] because he doesn't like sitting that
[1:58:11] long plus he needs to get outside and
[1:58:13] smoke a cigarette and visit with his
[1:58:15] pastor
[1:58:18] come on saints it's not what we're
[1:58:20] called to be
[1:58:21] we're not called to be and we start
[1:58:23] lowering the standards in this assembly
[1:58:25] we won't be long till we look like them
[1:58:30] only way you could ever have eternal
[1:58:32] life is because you always was amen
[1:58:35] see
[1:58:36] this little look down lady that christ
[1:58:37] calls his bride right prophecy is
[1:58:39] declared prophecy is coming to pass now
[1:58:42] let's look across this right here just
[1:58:44] my very last quote and then we'll come
[1:58:46] sister ruth if you just come that'll
[1:58:47] prompt me not to carry on
[1:58:49] amen
[1:58:50] so look at this now
[1:58:52] look what the prophet has said right
[1:58:53] here saints this is a quote i have
[1:58:55] quoted over and over again through the
[1:58:56] years maybe not so much lately but it is
[1:58:59] something that just strikes it rings
[1:59:01] resonates in my heart it is a permanent
[1:59:03] if i could say it my little ipad i study
[1:59:06] on it is a permanent locked in quote in
[1:59:08] my quote deal there i have just a
[1:59:10] handful of them this one is permanently
[1:59:12] locked in there because it means that
[1:59:14] much to me now look at this when a man
[1:59:17] once catches that vision
[1:59:19] right not theological not teaching not
[1:59:23] this or that but a real vision where he
[1:59:26] sees and can insert himself into the
[1:59:29] vision you know this is a whole other
[1:59:31] sermon but look at this saints you
[1:59:33] realize when john's talking about the
[1:59:35] vision when paul is talking the vision
[1:59:37] paul says look
[1:59:39] i was
[1:59:40] faithful
[1:59:43] to the heavenly vision
[1:59:46] oh king agrippa
[1:59:49] i'm just going to let you know right now
[1:59:51] whatever you think i have been faithful
[1:59:55] to this vision amen oh i hope i can say
[1:59:59] that at the end of my life
[2:00:01] when a man once catches that vision of
[2:00:03] the invisible god
[2:00:05] and know that he's always present right
[2:00:08] there is something that stabilizes that
[2:00:10] man's thinking it stabilizes his action
[2:00:13] and in the time of prosperity and
[2:00:15] comfort
[2:00:19] the time of distress and trouble
[2:00:22] it'll still make him look upward and
[2:00:24] above the things that are happening
[2:00:26] around him
[2:00:27] because he's looking at the unseen yet
[2:00:31] what did god give israel in goshen amen
[2:00:35] a promise amen
[2:00:39] yet by promise and now
[2:00:41] how abraham not only did he see the
[2:00:43] unseen and the reason he believed it
[2:00:46] i like this and i apply this to my life
[2:00:48] saints i'm telling you this is a and
[2:00:50] i've got a lot of ouches if you guys was
[2:00:52] around paul a day in and day out of his
[2:00:55] life you would hear paul say ouch a lot
[2:00:58] but it is here my brother and sister why
[2:00:59] do i believe it why do you believe it
[2:01:01] the reason he believed it is because god
[2:01:04] said it amen
[2:01:06] and if we being dead in christ we are
[2:01:08] abraham's seed and if the spirit that
[2:01:10] was in christ dwells in us it does the
[2:01:14] same thing it takes every divine promise
[2:01:16] of god that's in his bible and calls it
[2:01:19] present tense and rests itself upon
[2:01:22] there amen go forward brothers where if
[2:01:25] you look out with your eyes and you see
[2:01:28] now that our nation is shaking and
[2:01:30] trembling this quote just fits our world
[2:01:33] war clouds are flying everywhere
[2:01:37] do you know that that our
[2:01:39] highest military leaders
[2:01:44] one of them
[2:01:45] spoke out a turn in a interview
[2:01:50] our nation
[2:01:51] which is said to be the strongest nation
[2:01:54] on earth
[2:01:55] is afraid
[2:01:57] this is what the man said we are afraid
[2:02:00] of a frontal attack
[2:02:02] from china
[2:02:05] you see where we're at
[2:02:07] no longer a nation that can stand and
[2:02:09] say
[2:02:10] we are the superpower
[2:02:14] what's it doing
[2:02:16] trembling that's it
[2:02:18] trembling shaking it down
[2:02:21] you know what it's doing for the bride
[2:02:23] yes
[2:02:25] letting her know
[2:02:26] there's only one place of refuge
[2:02:29] you're not going to be able to run and
[2:02:30] hide your bunkers no
[2:02:33] none of that will work
[2:02:37] every sign jesus said is happening amen
[2:02:41] oh let me go back i want to war clowns
[2:02:46] are flying everywhere every nation under
[2:02:49] distressed and perplexed of time every
[2:02:51] sign that jesus said would happen is
[2:02:53] happening there would be signs in the
[2:02:55] heavens above and in the earth below and
[2:02:57] great things would be taking place
[2:03:00] like flying saucer and mystic things
[2:03:03] taking place
[2:03:04] now look i think this is funny
[2:03:07] most of you would never be up at this
[2:03:09] time but in the middle of the night
[2:03:11] there's a guy on the radio sometimes you
[2:03:13] have to do whatever you got to do to
[2:03:14] stay awake
[2:03:15] when the ac down at 50 degrees don't
[2:03:18] keep you awake
[2:03:20] i hope brother sergey you don't drive a
[2:03:21] truck like this and brother vasily
[2:03:23] but i drive a tractor in the middle of
[2:03:24] the night like this there's not a lot of
[2:03:26] traffic out there and there's this guy
[2:03:29] on the radio and you talk about it just
[2:03:30] weirds me out
[2:03:32] because he's talking about oh we have
[2:03:34] these reports
[2:03:36] of these little men
[2:03:38] and one of them they landed
[2:03:41] they landed their ship
[2:03:42] there's a big oval in the parking lot of
[2:03:44] the walmart in las cruces new mexico and
[2:03:47] one of those men landed his ship
[2:03:50] and got out and asked the people
[2:03:53] who's your leader
[2:04:00] that keeps you awake for a while
[2:04:03] wow
[2:04:05] are these people weird or what
[2:04:10] but then the prophet of god said
[2:04:13] oh don't worry about them they're just
[2:04:15] investigating angels
[2:04:18] and if one of them landed
[2:04:20] in your front yard and said who is your
[2:04:22] leader
[2:04:24] would you be going uh i guess it's joe
[2:04:26] biden
[2:04:30] no sir if it's an investigating angel
[2:04:32] and you're the bride of christ you could
[2:04:34] be going well i'm here to tell you
[2:04:35] little man in the saucer jesus christ is
[2:04:39] my leader
[2:04:41] hallelujah well identified once and for
[2:04:44] eternity who my leader is
[2:04:47] amen i don't have to worry about what's
[2:04:49] happening in the white house what they
[2:04:50] did right or wrong my brother and sister
[2:04:52] because i'm not of this earth and
[2:04:54] neither are you
[2:04:55] hallelujah so look what's happening if
[2:04:58] you want to do that go in the middle of
[2:04:59] the night art bell
[2:05:01] you'll just hear the weirdest things you
[2:05:03] ever heard in your life guys talking
[2:05:04] about well now we mystically blah blah
[2:05:07] blah and we've done this and we did this
[2:05:09] and we bent these straws and i believe
[2:05:11] them unbelievable
[2:05:12] i believe them all kinds of mystic
[2:05:14] things
[2:05:16] but those mystics my brother and sister
[2:05:18] under the ministry of the apostle paul
[2:05:20] got converted to be real christians
[2:05:22] amen
[2:05:23] so all they need to do is hear the
[2:05:24] gospel i'm sorry i said i was just going
[2:05:27] to be done and i just can't help myself
[2:05:30] amen
[2:05:31] great things would be taking place like
[2:05:32] flying saucers mystic things taking
[2:05:34] place but he commanded his church
[2:05:37] hey hallelujah did anybody know his
[2:05:39] church
[2:05:40] amen
[2:05:42] lift up their heads in that day and to
[2:05:45] look up for the unseen christ will be
[2:05:47] appearing pretty soon but if we only
[2:05:49] walk by sight we would be children of
[2:05:51] darkness sure enough now but i'm so glad
[2:05:53] to know that there is a life that shines
[2:05:55] in every believer's heart until the
[2:05:58] eternal day when jesus christ shall come
[2:06:01] hallelujah saints

[2:18:29] we shall believe the report of the lord
[2:18:34] for his report says i am healed
[2:18:40] his resources
[2:18:43] am sealed
[2:18:45] his report says i am free
[2:18:50] his reports his
[2:18:53] victory sing this verse again
[2:18:55] because some of you are
[2:18:58] just
[2:18:59] not into reports i guess
[2:19:03] or maybe
[2:19:04] the devil gave you a negative report
[2:19:08] let me just tell you how report cards
[2:19:10] are
[2:19:12] when i was in school
[2:19:14] i had a teacher
[2:19:16] she said paul i need you to come sit
[2:19:18] down talk about your report card okay
[2:19:21] i sat down
[2:19:23] and says paul you've done everything
[2:19:26] there is to do wrong in my class
[2:19:29] you're tardy thirty sometimes
[2:19:32] you don't pay attention you don't do
[2:19:34] your schoolwork
[2:19:36] and right there in front of me
[2:19:38] took a red ink pen
[2:19:40] and in my final grade
[2:19:43] in my last year of school no not my
[2:19:46] senior year school my last year
[2:19:49] i put this great big f
[2:19:51] in the box
[2:19:53] and i said but you just told me a few
[2:19:55] days ago that i had a d minus minus
[2:19:57] minus
[2:20:00] she said
[2:20:01] let this change you
[2:20:04] because i know that there's more in you
[2:20:08] you'll be a success in life but you're
[2:20:10] going to have to focus
[2:20:14] i remember walking out that class that
[2:20:15] day and said i know where that teacher's
[2:20:17] cars are and i should just make all four
[2:20:19] of them tires go flat
[2:20:21] i should die should i should i should i
[2:20:25] [Music]

[2:20:30] this same teacher
[2:20:32] just told me

[2:20:37] in life
[2:20:40] i looked at that report card i hid it
[2:20:41] from my mother i told her i said mom i
[2:20:43] don't know i think i misplaced that day
[2:20:47] my mama never went to the teacher you
