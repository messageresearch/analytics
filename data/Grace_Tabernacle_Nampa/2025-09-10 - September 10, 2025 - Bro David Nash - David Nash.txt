Um, feel like I have to apologize for my handwriting. Um, I was holding up the piece of paper and writing it down a couple minutes before the service. So, let's uh go to number 840 8:49. In the harvest fields now ripened, there's a work for all to do. Ark the voice of God is calling to the harvest calling you. Little is much when God is in it. Labor not for wealth or fame. There's a crown and you can win it if you go in Jesus name. Does the place your call to labor seem so small and little? know it is great if God is in it and he'll not forget his own. Little is much when God is in it. Labor not for wealth or fame. There's a crown and you can win it if you go in Jesus name. When the conflict here is ended and our race on earth is run, he will say if we are faithful, welcome home, my child, well done. Little is much when God is in it. Labor not for wealth or fame. There's a crown and you can win it if you go in Jesus name. And we enter heaven's portals and our Savior's face. We see cares of life will be forgotten. We'll be happy, glad, and free. Little is much when God is in it. Labor not for wealth or fame. There's a crown and you can win it. If you go in Jesus name. Oh, little is much when God is in it. Labor not for wealth or fame. There's a crown and you can win it if you go in Jesus name. Amen. All we stand together in invite brother David sing number 749 refiner's fire purify my heart let me be as gold and preious silver purified My heart let me be as gold pure gold refiner's fire.

Deep within refineer's fire. Oh, my heart's one desire is to be holy, set aart for you, Lord. I choose to be holy. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I forgot the Bible. I got it. &gt;&gt; I think your will. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was glad when they said, "Let us go into the house of the Lord." And with the harvest and all the other people closing out their summertimes, we're a little uh sparse. But that's okay because we living here by a divine promise that whether two or three of us. &gt;&gt; And there's another place where it said if any two agree and ask for something, &gt;&gt; you can have what you ask for. And we know the message of the hour says that's you and God. &gt;&gt; So if you and God can agree on something, you can have whatever you ask for. God bless you, sister. And so, we're just happy to be here this evening. I thank brother Paul and we uh tweaked something as we were going down the stairs this morning taking care of the goat. And uh my daughter called this afternoon and Deborah was telling him, "Yeah, he's having a little hard time walking. So, if I went, it's only just because there's a a kink there." But uh as uh then she goes, "Oh, it's going to be a really good service." She's been around the block and she knows. So, praise the Lord. Could we do that is the song you started with there in moments like these while we're standing, then we'll get right into it. In moments like these, I sing out a song. I sing out a love song to Jesus. In moments like these, I lift up my hands. I lift up my hands to the Lord singing I love you Lord. saying, "I love you, Lord." Singing, "I love you, Lord. I love you in moments like these. I sing out a song. I sing out a love song to Jesus. us. In moments like these, I lift up my heart. I lift up my heart to the Lord. saying, "I love you, Lord." Singing, "I love you, Lord." Singing, "I love you. Lord, I love you. Just softly on the chorus, singing, I love you, Lord. singing beautiful love you singing I love you Lord I love You gracious heavenly father, we know that singing and songs has are like prophecy. In fact, if we looked in the book of Psalms, we find place after place where they are prophesying words unto thee, Father. And so, as we sing this tonight, you have heard the hearts of your people. And we realize that when we project love to you, you project love back to us. And we realize also from the scripture, it says, "For God so loved the world that you gave your only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should have everlasting life, not perish. Father, so we thank you tonight. I give you myself, Lord Jesus. take control of this man. Take control of my heart. Take control of every heart here in the name of Jesus Christ that you might be magnified and glorified above all things tonight. And and if it should be that that service would last to where we'd leave this place, may we leave with our hearts full of your love and grace in the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. Praise the Lord. We uh I don't like to leave you standing, but let's let's turn first to uh and I know this is really familiar. We mentioned it many times. John the 11th chapter. We uh uh we hear different things and how people uh talk about rapture and we're going to and this isn't to put anybody's down particularly, but they'll say, "Well, I've had young people come before it like youth camps and oh, how you know, how can how can I make the rapture?" And let's just clear up a few things tonight, Lord willing. uh because I think you'll find it a little different than what the normal way of looking at things is. And this is where Jesus Lazarus has died. We know Lazarus was uh Jesus and we went through a few services back about what it actually means. And one of the meanings there is the glory of Israel. And so he is going Jesus is going down to raise Lazarus or raise the glory of Israel from the dead because the glory in Israel was dead. That's why Jesus was there. So he's going there to raise up the glory of Israel. That's one of the definitions anyway. And we'll start there and it's with about uh we'll start with verse 20. So chapter 11 verse 20. Then Martha, as soon as she heard Jesus was coming, went and met him. But Mary sat still in the house. Then said Martha unto Jesus,"Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died. But I know that even now whatsoever thou wil ask of God, God will give it to thee." Jesus saith unto her, "Thy brother shall rise again." I want you to pay attention to the sequence as we go into this. So he speaks or prophesies, "Your brother will rise again." Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die, believest thou this. So now let's just turn over uh little different approach to this this evening to John the 14th chapter and uh we'll start there at the 17th verse. So John 14:17 he said even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. &gt;&gt; Okay I will not leave you comfortless. I will I will come to you. Okay, I will come to you let yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also. At that day shall ye know that I am in the father. I am in my father and ye in me and I in you. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we've read your word tonight. May you bless it in the name of Jesus Christ. God, just open our eyes by revelation of Jesus Christ as our brother spoke about Sunday. We thank you now and make it personal to each heart in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And for those who might be out there on the internet tonight or or listening in, God bless you. We appreciate you being with us in spirit. And so, please be seated. So, we look at this and you know, in modern English language, we call it rapture. And so we think about well what is this rapture? And we most often we think about it if we were to go back to Corinthians it talks about we shall not all die we shall be changed. So we realize in another place it says we shall be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye. And I suppose I've probably told this before but one time I got really into this. I was praying and praying about what is a moment? Well, we know it's a time space and I I got, you know, well, it's a and so when you get serious about it, it's an unidentified identified space of time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, it's a specific identified space of time that's unidentified. So, I'm going, okay, all right. So, I was praying about this for actually many days. And so, you know, I'm just going, Lord, what's this all about? out and I remember I I believe it was I went to the the drive-thru somewhere and the the little lady comes on the phone and said uh you know I'll be with you in a moment. I'm going here it is I'm going to learn what a moment is and about 2 3 minutes later you know here's your burger or whatever is we were getting and you know okay so that's what a moment is so 2 3 minutes it's all going to be over right well so then I go down to the doctor's office a little bit later and as I walk in the door she hands me the little thing and says here we'll be with you in a moment there's that word again so about 15 20 minutes by the time you get everything filled out. I'm going, "Okay, so a moment might be 3 minutes, might be 20 minutes because it's an unidentified identified space of time. So, this is really good." Well, that afternoon I had to go down and get my license plates renewed. Now, Idaho is good compared to some states. And they said, "Take a number and we'll be with you in a moment." About an hour and a half later, I was going up to get my drop live my license plates. So, uh, you have this. All we know is it's a time frame. We don't know how long exactly because it might be 3 minutes, might be 20, might be might be two or three days depending on the situation that brings it forth. But we know that during that moment somehow there's going to become a body change in these these mortal bodies are going to be changed from one body into another body. And that body is as Paul was talking to Isaac and Isaac and we had the same conversation about I can't even remember the name of the what it was we were some kind of new science that they're starting to figure out. if you speed things up fast enough because there's certain things they figured out move faster than the speed of light. And that's like the little electrons that go around the that those actually goes and and they say that the nerve synapse in your body is actually travels faster than the speed of light. And I remember when I had, you know, here I'm limping a little bit today. I remembering what it felt like 18 years ago when they told me I'd never walk again. and they had a tube right they'd stuck in there along my spinal cord and when they pulled that tube out I'd never felt they said this is going to feel strange and and they were draining the fluid off my spinal cord when they took out part of my backbone and when they yanked that tube out I could feel it instantly in every like cell of my body and it felt really strange I will agree but it was there almost like before it happened it was so fast. So and if they if we are changed to where we become like that kind of construction we can begin to move and they said if you can ever move that fast you can go through walls you could get hit by a car and never even know the car hit you because you're and they've have documented cases of this thing these things kind of things happen. In fact, they had pictures of somebody that was in the street and a truck hit them, but they were still standing there after the truck went by. You go, "How does this happen?" Well, the person was a Christian and they were praying and they didn't see the truck and was too late, but they were still standing there after the truck went by. And there's other cases, documented cases through history. So if we're looking at this and we think about rapture and we think about Jesus after the resurrection and how that he could move from one place to the other place instantly. So we're looking for some kind of a body change to where we can move instantly. And in one place, you know, we've heard it said that you can travel like a thought. Well, how fast does a thought travel? Well, if the nerve syninnapse is faster than the speed of light, how fast is the thought &gt;&gt; behind it? We're just we're going to look at scriptural things about the rapture tonight or what we call rapture. It's actually body change or also called translation. And as we begin to think about these things now, we saw there where Jesus here he is. He's coming down to raise up Lazarus. And Lazarus, you know, the glory of Israel, the strength of Israel, the oak tree experience, all those things that Lazarus, the name Lazarus means. And each one has a specific thing that goes along with it and how that when he goes there and the first thing that Martha says, if you had been here, my brother had not have died. So, she's got faith that there's something about Jesus that's different because she calls him master. And I believe that's like rabbi or raoni. I didn't happen to look it up there, but it's she's calling him, you are the master. You are, you know, God in a man or what they call the Messiah. And so when she gives him that recognition and she said, "If you'd have been here, my my brother would not have died." And the first thing he does is he prophesies to her. He says, "Your brother will rise again." Now, she was well trained. She believed in a resurrection. She'd been around the Pharisees. They're the ones that believed it. The Sadducees didn't. But so she and she said, "Yay, Lord, I know that my brother will raise at the last days." in the general res in in the resurrection of the and he goes the word always corrects the error she gave true doctrine there will be or there is I don't know how to explain it a general resurrection for those that go on and that aren't as we would say believers or Christians. So she told the truth that was the common doctrine of the day and it was absolutely true doctrine. But the word because Jesus is the word in the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God is God. Always will be God. So Jesus Christ the word became flesh. So this is the word in flesh. and the word the word now there's a difference when you say you know in English word because there's what we call remma what is in this book is called the remma &gt;&gt; which mean it's the written it's the letters but the logos is the thought behind the sequence of words &gt;&gt; that's the logos so she gave the absolute truth truth in what she said. But the word or the logos, the general sequence of the I am God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Corrected the error. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He corrected the error because he said he said, "I am." Who's the I am? &gt;&gt; We we all know who the I am is. When Moses was in the wilderness, he said, "Who should I say sent me?" When God has sending him down to Egypt, he said, "Tell him I am sent you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Then when Jesus, we just read it there. He said, "I am." And she said, "He he'll rise again, but he said, I am the resurrection." &gt;&gt; Who is the resurrection? Is it a thing that we're waiting for? There will be a manifestation. &gt;&gt; But how do we get into or translate it into that revelation? I am &gt;&gt; because it's not a thing that we're trying to jump into like like like you're going to go swimming or something. No, the swimming pool is inside of us because he said, "I am." Who's speaking? Jesus Christ. The I am God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the Old Testament, Jehovah of the Old has become Jesus of the New. And the I am God that was there is now manifesting himself in a fleshly body through as we know Jesus Christ or what we call the God man. He was half God, half man because he was living in a fleshly body. But that fleshly body was birthed by what? by the word of God. Behold, a virgin shall conceive. And as that word when spoken by Isaiah, as that word began to travel through history, it started laying out a sequence. We call it sequencing. And and they use it in computer language. One of these other brothers, I'm sure, could tell you more about it. And how that that sequence builds a and as it goes through history. And well, you want to see know what the sequence is? It's pretty easy. You go back, I think it's the first of Matthew, and so and so begat so and so, and so and so begat so and so, and so and so, and it goes all down through that genealogy that if you want to go to sleep, that's a pretty good way to do it. Sometimes it really works. You start reading some of those long genealogies. Boy, I'm going, come on, man. What's this mean? Well, it's actually the sequence of God bringing about the word that Isaiah spoke back there from the I am God &gt;&gt; because the angel of God had come to Isaiah and all those other prophets. &gt;&gt; And when he spoke, it was God speaking as we would think of the beginning in this in this sense of Jesus Christ. He's telling us how that beginning is going to come to pass. And then he lays out the sequence. This one begat. This one begat. This one begat until when it comes time to for Jesus to come on the scene. What did it say? Well, it comes down to an angel appears to Mary. And the angel said, you know, behold, thou art most favored among women. And as he he he goes begins to talk to her and he tells her, "You're going to have a son." And she and valid question. She goes, "How's this going to happen?" Uh, come on. The way kids get here is not what you're telling me. But he said, you know, and he begins to tell her. He says, "The Holy Ghost." Who's the Holy Ghost? The I am. &gt;&gt; Just in a slightly different form. He said, "The Holy Ghost or the I am will overshadow you." So, who's the father of Jesus? &gt;&gt; The I am. And and you're it'll overshadow you and you'll bring forth this forth this son. Well, what was her answer that so pleased the Lord was, "Be it unto me according to what?" Your word. &gt;&gt; Well, what word? This word or the thought behind the word? The thought behind the word was this sequence is about to go into a new phase. It's been sitting there all these years, you know, going through that lineup and then it gets to Mary and it says now the sequence is going to begin because Jesus had a beginning. That's why he's not, as some people say, the eternal son. Pentecostal dogma, it it's not God because Jesus had a beginning. And yet the God of no beginning, no ending, or what we call Melzdc in another place is the God that created that beginning. &gt;&gt; And we know he's the beginning because if we turn to Revelations, I forgot what it is. Revelations 1, he says, "I am." Who's the beginning? The I am. But then he comes back and says, "It's Jesus Christ." It's because the I am created himself &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the heart of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Exposed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I know we went through this, but I'll just drop it in for there's a few people weren't here before. When David gets the sword from the altar and it was wrapped and David is called in the book of Acts a man after God's own heart, he received the heart of God because he took that from the heart of the altar and he pulls it out and it's wrapped. Well, what's it was talking about? It was showing us Jesus Christ because the word is a sword in the book of Hebrews. And so the word as a sword was revealed how he had to unwrap the sword. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word or the logos of the I am is the sword of the word. And that sword of the word was wrapped. And then you advance that sequence again going through time. And what is it? Then he had the shepherds abiding in the fields keeping watch over their flock by night. And he says, "Lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord showed upon them." And and they were sore afraid. The angel says, "Don't be afraid, for to you this night there is born a Savior who is Christ the Lord." And what was the sign? The same sign is the sword head that David took from the altar. You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling cloth. &gt;&gt; The baby was wrapped, the sword of God, the very from the heart of the altar of God is the sword of God, which is the word of God. But it's not just this the little tinky letters in your book or your Bible or in your cell phone or wherever you look at them. It's the thought behind the word. It's the personal experiences. As our brother was talking about Sunday, it's the personal experience between you and God, between me and God. And that God, that personal I am God. &gt;&gt; Is to live within us. &gt;&gt; Repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. You shall receive what? The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Who was the birth father of Jesus? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, Mary, yeah, you can have the you're going to have the baby because you'll be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; which is the logos heart thought of God pouring himself into the womb of a woman. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; We know the woman types the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All through the Bible or we would call the church, the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; And what does he do with the woman? He puts Christ in her. And that brings forth a baby. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are we afraid of people? &gt;&gt; Why are people afraid? &gt;&gt; If you have received Jesus Christ, you will produce Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You're not going to make pumpkins and watermelons or something else. &gt;&gt; It's going to be the God of this Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, back to the subject. So Jesus said, "I am the resurrection." So what is the resurrection? It's the I am. &gt;&gt; It's the personal God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you receive him, where does he live? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, we read it in John 14. &gt;&gt; I am in my father, you in me, and I in you. &gt;&gt; Huh? And I shall be in you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. &gt;&gt; What I are we talking about? Jesus just told us the I am is our resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why a Christian should have no fear. If they kill us, well, I am lives in here. &gt;&gt; Lives right down there in a little place. And they even click medical science in the heart. They say there's a little tiny room in your heart. And this is, you know, this is my I can't say pet peeve particularly, but I look at it like this. They call even medical science calls it the house of the soul or the room of the soul inside your heart. Just a little tiny tiny room. Well, if the Holy Ghost is in that little tiny tiny room and he's our resurrection, every time your heart beats, bloop bloop, that blood has to pass right by what? The Holy Ghost. Now, who's the creator? Well, we know in Colossians, I believe it is. It says, "All things were created by him, for him. Without him, there was nothing made that was made." And and I believe it repeats that. I think it's in Revelations 4, chapter 5, right in there. And I think there's a third place it says it, but I I don't remember where it is. But if you go back to Genesis, says in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. In where? The beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when that prophecy or that word from Isaiah came all through the sequence, Jesus Christ became the beginning. But it's the beginning of what? The manifestation of the I am God. &gt;&gt; Okay. I am I am in the father and you in me and me in you. So, and if we have that Holy Spirit experience in our hearts and every time that heart pumps, that blood has to pass by. What are they? What's it passing by? The creator of the entire universe. All things created by him, for him, and without him there wasn't anything made. And that's I'll drop this in maybe for somebody online out there. If you're worried about your sin, what we call sin, which is unbelief. It's not all the attributes of sin. I mean, those come because of unbelief. Unbelief in what? &gt;&gt; Unbelief in God's word, but not just the letters. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right. &gt;&gt; But unbelief in the thoughts of God expressing Jesus Christ. And if you're worried about it, there's a place that says if we confess our sins, they go into the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Well, we know that other places in the scripture when it talks about God says he knows all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz well, he created everything. Of course, he knows everything &gt;&gt; and he knows all things and he knows the beginning. He knows the ending. He knows all this. But you know, if we have a sin and it says if we confess it and he drops it into his forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. You know, we had a prophet's message that said, uh, it's like if you had a great big tub of, you know, like one of those 55gallon drums of bleach and you put all the sins, uh, uh, your whole life in a little eyropper, and you take it and you drop it in that bleach. He said, that bleach is so strong, it completely annihilates those cells and things that were in it. It annihilates it because chemically it absorbs it into the bleach. And he said in one place he says, "So it's like it never existed." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, God knows all things. &gt;&gt; But if it never existed, God won't acknowledge it because it never existed. Because he created all things. And if it's not part of the creation, it &gt;&gt; think about this. Your sin never existed. &gt;&gt; If you have confessed your sins, they don't exist. &gt;&gt; They're gone, friends. &gt;&gt; And not even God will remember them. &gt;&gt; I might jump yet tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus said here, I am the resurrection and the life. And the word there is Zoey which means God's life and and I puzzled over that for a long time like the the moment right and he said and he said you know I there he said though he were dead yet shall he live. Well why is he going to live? Because the I am is the resurrection. And if that blood has been pumping past that Holy Ghost, well, if you're one of those that's not going to be alive and remain as one another place in the scripture says, don't matter. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because every time that blood went past there, the creative power of God was creating that person as a resurrected saint. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was creating you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He's creating all of us right now for one or the other. I don't I can't tell you who's who or whatever, but God knows. &gt;&gt; And he is creating you to either be a resurrected saint, which is one of those that when they died, they didn't really we Christians never die. We just step from one dimension into another one. &gt;&gt; Just now think about it. How do you do that? Because you're traveling faster than the speed of light because you're traveling at the speed or the thoughts of God. And in uh 1 Corinthians 2:16, let's just read that. We're we're okay, I think, timewise. Uh because we're moving at the speed of thought. &gt;&gt; And in 1 Corinthians 2, I'm still I'm working on this new Bible. I'm getting more and more through it, and I really like it, but I'm still slow. So give me okay he said uh 2 and 16 he said for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him. So you have to know the Lord &gt;&gt; to be instructed by him because then it says, "But we have the mind of Christ." &gt;&gt; We have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; And the mind of Christ there were the guys on the road to Emmas. Remember that? And and here they were walking the wrong direction because they're leaving Jerusalem and they were preaching the gospel to Jesus. Well, yeah. You know, we've had this prophet on the scene. Just think about this, okay? Oh, yeah. Well, why are you guys so sad? Well, well, there was this great mighty prophet on the scene. So, he's they're telling him about a prophet. And they said, "And we thought that he should be the Messiah. So, now they're talking about this." And, you know, it was that close. You think these people out here don't have problems with it? Of course, they have problems with it because it was that close, friends. And then we thought that this prophet was now God. And so they and so they're preaching about that and and then they could go a little another step. They said and then here this morning the sisters went down there. And can you believe this? They said that he wasn't in the tomb and told and told the other disciples that he raised from the dead. And there was an angel in there. She said that spoke to her and told those those girls that. And so they're preaching all this stuff to Jesus and they don't even have the Holy Ghost yet. H &gt;&gt; interesting. &gt;&gt; Interesting, isn't it? Yeah. And you wonder why there's problems in the message or in religion as a whole because there's out there that can preach at you about the death, burial, and resurrection and not have the Holy Ghost because they never got a personal experience with Christ. How do you get it? You ask him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just ask. It's like if you need a drink, just ask. I'll give you the, you know, I won't give you this bottle, but I'll give you a bottle. You know, who knows what what I had in this beard today. But so you understand, we just ask him. And when you ask him, he'll come upon you and he'll cause you to what we call repent. He will cause you to do those things. And for some people, you know, for me, I woke up on the floor covered in tears like I'd been in a shower. For other people, maybe they don't have so much they're packing. And there's I remember the story about the one guy that uh all he did was pick up a tract off of a car and I believe the track said something like uh where are you going to spend eternity? And it really it shocked the man. He was like, "Oh, wow." They say he wadded it up and threw it in the garbage. H and but that from that day on he started searching. He went to this church and that church and this church and that doctrine and this and that and this and Billy Graham, Oral Roberts, all the bigname guys. And finally, he thought, "How do I get this Holy Ghost? I've been prayed for. I I've danced. I've shouted. I' But I just don't feel like I I got it." And somebody said, "Well, there's a prophet down there. Maybe you should go see him." And some people, I guess, even said, "Well, maybe blasphemed or something." Because in his life, he didn't feel like he had what he was supposed to have. And when he goes before that prophet's vision, he said, "Oh, I see you picking up that tract and I see you wadded it up and you threw it away." But he said, "That's when you got it." &gt;&gt; That's when you got it. And the guy goes, "What?" He said, "Because that's what led you &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; here. How simple is this? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and I am the life." And he says, "We have the mind of Christ." Well, the mind of Christ when after they, you know, had told him all that stuff, he he calls them fools. You fools. slow of heart to understand what all that the prophets and the law had spoken because Jesus Christ is all over the law. He's all over the prophets because it's him in in shadow and type form. And so he calls him fools and he, you know, they're he's he's waving goodbye. Hey, see you guys around. They're going, "No, no, no, no. stay, stay, stay with us tonight. So he said, "Okay." So he goes in and to the I guess they call it an inn. And and when they're in there, they he starts to break the bread at the meal. And when they see the breaking of the bread, the Bible said their eyes came open. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that breaking of the bread signified a change from an Old Testament law which was still valid even when Jesus was there because he told the lepers, "Go down, show yourself to the priest and make the sacrifice." The law was still in effect until death, burial, and resurrection. And so he he turns to him when they saw that part. What happened? What did the mind of Christ do with Jesus? Gone. Where did he go? I don't know. Anybody got any ideas? I don't know where he went. Just says that he did. He vanished when they re when they recognized him. He vanished. &gt;&gt; Let that soak in for a second. When we recognize him, we don't have to see him here in physical form. &gt;&gt; Because he's here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the form of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And what's the next thing it did? The word had corrected the error and they turned around and headed straight back to Jerusalem because the word says that's where the Holy Ghost was going to be poured out. So they had they got their words corrected and away they went. And it's the same way with us as Christians. Might happen like that 3 minutes through the drive-thru or it might be like the license plate place. I don't know. Each one of us is different. We each have a part to play in this gospel of Jesus Christ. So he said, "I am the resurrection and the life." And that Zoey life, it just I looked at it and looked at it and looked at it and I prayed and prayed and prayed. I said, "I don't quite understand exactly why this is used like that." And one day the spirit of the Lord, he had mercy on me. Some kind of I was a logger, come on. And a firefighter. I wasn't a priest. and and he just said, "Where is the mention of death?" Uh, it's not there. So, if it's talking about eternal life, it's talking about a life without death. And what do we call the rapture or the translation, the body change? It's the ability to walk out of this off this planet without death. Well, but Paul said, "I die daily." Yeah, you're right. We die daily. That is our death is to die daily to sacrifice our desires, our needs, our wants, whatever it is that if it's you can have all anything you want if it's in this book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if it's not, then we sacrifice that. We lay it on the altar of our heart and say, "Lord, please take that out of me. &gt;&gt; Just take it out &gt;&gt; because I want to be full of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; And so it's the ability to walk out of here without death because how by the mind of Christ because the same mind that took him disappeared from those guys and emus where's the next time you see him? All the disciples are gathered together in Jerusalem and what happens? He comes walking through the walls. How you doing, guys? &gt;&gt; What did that? The mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be with what? I'm in the Father. The Father's in me and I in you. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be with his disciples so that they could have the same experience or the same mind that he did. He showed him. How did he just do that? How? Well, it was Philillip, wasn't it? Philip got the revelation somewhere along the line because here he is. He's, you know, they was in a big revival meeting. Brother Brandham said in a big revival meeting. Got this, you know, like the geese. What What makes what? What? Why did we start hearing geese two days ago? Well, because something in those geese said, "It's time to get out of the north country because it's getting ready to get cold." And there was something that in them they needed to see that so that they would know that's possible. All things are possible. And here was Philillip. He gets that thing that I got to get out of this meeting. I don't know. There's something going on here and I'm I'm just not comfortable. Yeah, they're having a nice revival, but Lord, I just I want to go eat a sandwich or something. I don't know. And so he he leaves and when he leaves, all of a sudden, you know, here's this guy in a chariot and reading a Bible. It's so simple, friends. &gt;&gt; It's so so simple. This this guy's reading a Bible. the the uno I think he was from Ethiopia if I remember and he's he's there and he's reading the Bible and Philip just asks do you know what you're reading you ever see people like that &gt;&gt; you ever ask him &gt;&gt; we should &gt;&gt; you know what you're reading the guy goes not really need somebody to teach me well here's a man full of the Holy Ghost say oh where was the Holy Ghost the teacher is the Holy Ghost and it's in Philillip and he gets in the chariot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he pre begins he starts taking the same scriptures and stuff that probably that Jesus gave him on the road to Emmas showing him Jesus Christ in the scripture. They didn't have the New Testament yet. So he had to be using the Old Testament to show him Jesus Christ. And the guy, hey, I want to get baptized. How did he get the jump from the Old Testament to getting baptized in the Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ without a New Testament being there? But he did. And he went and got baptized. And as soon as he got baptized, what happened to Philillip? The mind of Christ out of there. It is very possible, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very, very, very possible. All things are possible to those that believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we see this he said in the beginning are uh you know I am the resurrection and the life and then we look at what the requirements were the you want to know what the requirements is everybody well can I make it can I do well if we're putting this rapture this rapture thing this body change way off in the future what are we doing &gt;&gt; we're doing the same thing as well. Jesus is coming. He's coming. He's coming. And ignoring the fact that he's here right now. &gt;&gt; I'll say that again. He is here right now. &gt;&gt; Not in the form of the man on Calvary. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said he's the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; the man on Calvary today. That's the God that's here right now. And I remember we mentioned this a while back but the words there is from the Greek is copulative cumulative cumulative and what that means is a very close relationship that accumulates. It's like you get put a man and a woman together in in wedlock and what's it produce? Produces something children. And so Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today produces forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the what's it say there? It says, "And whosoever lives and believes in me," where do you have to be? In me. I'm in the Father. Father's in me. I in you, you in me. And so if we are in Jesus Christ, you are in the I am who is the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Scripturally, I'm just doing this scripture. Okay. If we stay in the scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. So we are if you are in Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What in the world? Why are we afraid? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I think about again mentioning you know brother Brennham and he said he got to the place to where he said you know if I'm a Judas he goes make me a really good one &gt;&gt; because I love him. I love him so much. &gt;&gt; And when we get to the place to where we love God more than anything in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we love him so much that we don't even care what happens to us beyond this veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're just getting ready for service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That means okay. God says now I can use you. &gt;&gt; That's it. Exactly. that my opinion but thank you brother sir &gt;&gt; because when we get because why because all fear is gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and the only thing he said was whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Now I'm not saying uh you know there's a there was a doctrine went around that said I can't die. That's not what it says, &gt;&gt; right? you know, and they found that some of those people that said they couldn't die did die. &gt;&gt; Well, it's nice to claim it. That's fine. But if you do, make sure you got the resurrection in there, too, because it's all in Jesus Christ. It's all in your personal experience with Jesus Christ. And the only says, do you believe it? Believest thou this? That's the requirement. &gt;&gt; Do we believe it? Do we believe that I have the mind of Christ? &gt;&gt; Well, man, you sure did some stupid stuff. You, you know, dumb stuff yesterday. &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, I did. You know, the enemy's right there going and you're going, "Uh, well, no, he said I have it." Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I do something or say something that I shouldn't, then the only place to go is to that bucket of bleach. &gt;&gt; Because if it hits that bleach, it never existed in the first place. You are absolutely totally. He that is justified is sanctified. He that is sanctified is glorified. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Why? because it all comes from that jump of sequence from mortal to immortality. Praise the Lord. Let's just look at the type and shadow as we get ready to close in Hebrews the 10th or 11th chapter. I I love because he's our type in shadow. Now there there was a big question came up one time when I was in Panama. They couldn't figure out out, you know, about Enoch and, you know, where did Enoch go? What did he Well, there's a a place in one of the message books where brother Brennham said that he was he didn't go all the way to glory. No, he just moved without death into the regions of the saved. the ones that when Jesus came up out of uh out of hell after preaching to those in hell that and he went by there and you've heard that you know the mighty conqueror and Enoch was with that group because that was the group he was born into &gt;&gt; or with so to speak and so but he had enough rapture power change power he did it without dying. He just walked over. Just walked over. And And so we look at here in Hebrews 11:5. By faith. How did he do it? By faith. He had faith. That Enoch was translated that he should not see death. And he was not found. Because God had translated him. Thank you. God translated him. And before his translation, he had a testimony. And that testimony pleased God. Again, we're just looking at this by way of the scripture. Nobody's I don't have a pet peeve doctrine or anything, but what the scripture says that Enoch was translated I don't see ablar espanol. Anyone? Poito, please. Uh, see, uh, you're not going to do it. She won't do it. And I if I could, how about I use that a lot. And to translate that for you, that means what am I doing here? &gt;&gt; I use it a lot when I'm in Spanish countries. But what just happened? You heard me speak from one man the mind of English and it was translated in sequence into another language into the a mind. I love to go to countries and get into their language because if you get into their language, you start understanding their mind. Was talking about brother Eric. We got, you know, I had a wonderful time with him here, you know, cruising around and talking about the things of the Lord and stuff. And Japanese language, you know, there's a big difference between right brain, left brain. And those people are very culturally different. They say that the whatever side of the brain they use, it's the same kind that we use for music and art. Well, there's art everywhere in Japan. Why? because that's what's in their mind. And it said that he was translated, but that translation when his mind was said he was translated that he shouldn't see death. What do you mean he could not see death? Okay, if this was death tonight, just and Enoch, we don't know what happened, how it happened, it just said he walked with God and he wasn't there anymore. Then if he's walking along that road and there's death, that's what he sees because he couldn't see death. I'm just tell That's what it said, right? I'm not making this up. He just couldn't see it. &gt;&gt; Couldn't see it. Why? because his mind had been translated from an earthly fleshly mind into the mind of God. And you can go back and read about him. I think it's Genesis 3, I think it is, and how it said that he was it said he was translated so that he couldn't see death. A and here because God had translated him. So God translated. Well, I wonder what God what language God was using. Are you understanding? He was translated because God had translated him. God put his mind into Enoch so that Enoch, he just couldn't see death. It just wasn't there. Wasn't in his vocabulary. It's not in God's vocabulary. &gt;&gt; And if God, we are in God. &gt;&gt; Where does that vocabulary exist? &gt;&gt; Right here. Because I am the resurrection. I am the life. Who is the I am that lives in you and me. But now remember I said watch the sequence because when Jesus came on the scene and she exercised faith that's this first word second word right there faith when she exercised faith. Oh if my brother master that's Messiah God &gt;&gt; if you'd have been here my brother wouldn't have died. She's exercising faith to tell him and she even says nevertheless whatever you ask God will give it to you. So Enoch was exercising that faith and that faith brought a translation or a changing of his mental conception or his language from an earthly one to a heavenly one. God had translated him. But before his translation, he had this testimony that he pleased God. You ever read Enoch's testimony? It actually tells us what it is. Does anybody know where it is? You're smiling. Let's look at Jude. We'll finish with this. Been such a wonderful group, but I want to get you out of here by 9. I'm I'll have to hurry here, but it's this is only just a little bit. Jude, it only has one chapter and and it's talking about spots in your feast of charity, the feast and the feeding without fear, clouds and about all the bad guys. Okay? And it comes down in verse 14. And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these things, saying, "Behold, the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his saints." H to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. what he's telling us the change of order. Enoch was trying to tell the people or he was telling the people. How did he do it? He prophesied. He prophesied just like Jesus turns back to her and says, "Thy brother will rise again." He's telling her there's going to be a change for the glory of Israel. It's coming again. It's going to come forth again. And here's Enoch saying, telling them, he prophesied of these things. Behold, the Lord cometh with 10,000 of his saints. What's his prophecy? Behold, the Lord comes. That's a present tense. Come. Because come in Hebrew can go mean the same as going. Because if I I came out tonight or I you know I I come here tonight but I had to go from that room to get here. So it's a coming and a going. And he said he comes what comes with 10 thousands of his saints. He's prophesying about the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go home and look at the cloud picture and then tell me about it. But it is also prophesying to execute judgment. Now I we don't have time to go into Isaiah. Maybe some other time and we can see where the break is in Isaiah where it changes from what we call grace to judgment. But the highest form of judgment there is or I mean the highest form of grace is actually judgment because only the judge has the power to look at your case and go never did it. Get out of the courtroom. You never did it. Get out of the courtroom. So what is this rapture? It's Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's Christ in me because he is my rapture or my body change. He is my resurrection. He is my life. Let us stand. Sister, please come. God bless you. We made it. Three minutes under the wire. And I do that just simply because because I do. I don't know why. I can't know everything about his life. Praise the Lord. How about do you know that uh I now see I want I'm thinking of it in Spanish. There's that change there. Lord, you are so precious. Okay, start. Sister brother Alex, you be out of here. I do it in A. I don't know what key you do it in. It says G, but I think A is for baby. Lord, you are so precious to me. Lord, you are so precious to me. And I love you. Yes, I love you because you first love me. Oh Lord, you are &gt;&gt; so gracious to me. Lord, you are so gracious to me and I love you. Yes, I love you because you first love me. We always sing that part again. And I love you. Yes, I love you. because you first love me. I want to do something here just as we as Alex comes. I'm going to sing it in Spanish because it's a different mind. But to show you how that when Enoch was translated, they go together in a sequence. So, I'm going to sing it from if I could do it in Japanese, I would, but I I I know it in Malagasi in Fr. I used to know it in French. And so, I'll sing it in Spanish and you guys sing it in English. If you know it in Spanish, sing it with me. I'll sing it in Malagasi. I remember it. Jes. So he su I'm Jes. So s I'm [Music] such a treey tree. me alone sor to mercy oh so part of me sor to prey oh so part of meote [Music] for king me and I love you. Yes, I love you because you first love me. Gracious heavenly father, we thank you for this service this evening. Pray that every heart receives something from you that will help them in this liflong battle, I guess we call it. Father, they they'll go out of here strong. And as they sang that song before service, purify me, oh God, let your word come now and purify every heart and life as we just for a few more songs now in the name of Jesus Christ. I love you. I thank you as we give you this service. Thank you, brother Paul, for having us tonight. and for each one in attendance and for those online. God bless you and thank you. [Music] Amen. Maybe we can just sing that song. Justified D. [Music] I was sitting alone in one dream about what I'm supposed to do. I can't deny the times I've made mistakes. I can't hide from him. He knew. But I know that deep within my soul, I feel sorry. Honest I do. So I just cry and say, "Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me, Lord. Will you?" Oh, justified. I'm justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Justified. Oh, justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. He looked at your perfect picture without blame, spot, or wrinkle. He didn't look at you where you are now. He looked from eternity. He said, "You're just trapped in that body. You by past your theophony. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Oh, justified. Justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Justified. Justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Let's sing. I'm justified now. Oh, I'm justified. I'm justified. I have not done it in the first place. I'm justified. I'm justified. I'm justified. I have not done it in the first place. I'm justified. Amen. Well, praise the Lord. I thought of that song. I don't think we've ever sang it. Maybe we can just sing the chorus. Um, I'm going to be gone. You can look that up. That's the one. Chorus. I'm going to be gone in a twinkling of an eye. I'm going to be gone. I won't have time to say goodbye. I'm going to be gone. It could be while I'm singing this song. I'm going to be gone and it won't be long. I'm going to be gone. One more time. I'm going to be gone in a twinkling of an eye. I'm going to be gone. I won't have time to say goodbye. I'm going to be gone. Could be while I'm singing this song. I'm going to be gone and it won't be long. I'm going to be gone. One last time. Oh, I'm going to be gone in a twinkling of an eye. going to be gone. I won't have time to say goodbye. I'm going to be gone. Could be while I'm singing this song. I'm going to be gone and it won't be long. I'm going to be gone. [Music] Amen. Can you show me the verse? Maybe we could try. I think we have time. This soul getting better every day. It's getting worse. So much fighting and confusion going on down here on Earth. But don't let that bother me cuz I'm not here to stay. I know my Lord is coming soon and I'll be called away. I'm going to be gone in a twinkling of an eye. I'm going to be gone. I won't have time to say goodbye. I'm going to be gone. Could be while I'm singing this song. I'm going to be gone and it won't be long. I'm going to be gone. Oh, it could be just any morning. It could be at night or noon. We don't know just when he's coming, but we know he's coming soon. I can say with calm assurance, this old world is not my home. One of these days you're going to look for me. Praise God. I'm going to be gone. I'm going to be gone. Oh, in a twinkling of an eye, I'm going to be gone. Won't have time to say goodbye. I'm going to be gone. Could be a while. I'm singing this song. I'm going to be gone and it won't be long. I'm going to be gone. Oh, I'm going to be gone and it won't be long. I'm going to be gone. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you all. You're dismissed. [Music] Oh yeah. [Music]
