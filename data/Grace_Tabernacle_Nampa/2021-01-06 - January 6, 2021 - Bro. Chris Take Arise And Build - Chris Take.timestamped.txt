[40:37] 17 then said I unto them you see the
[40:40] distress that we are in how Jerusalem
[40:42] lieth waste and the gates thereof are
[40:44] burned with fire come and let us build
[40:47] up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no
[40:49] more a reproach then I told them of the
[40:51] hand of my God which was good upon me as
[40:54] also the king's words that he had spoken
[40:56] unto me and they said let us rise up and
[40:58] build so they strengthened their hands
[41:01] for this good work but when s balot the
[41:04] horonite and toah the servant the
[41:06] ammonite and gesim the Arabian heard it
[41:09] they laughed us to scorn and despite us
[41:11] despised us the critics and said what is
[41:15] this thing that you do will ye rebel
[41:17] against the king then answered I them
[41:19] and said unto them the god of Heaven he
[41:22] will prosper us therefore we his
[41:24] servants will arise and build but

[43:03] or what is the place of my
[43:05] rest hath not my hand made all these
[43:08] things ye stick necked and uncircumcised
[43:11] in heart and ears you do always resist
[43:13] the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do
[43:16] ye may the Lord add a blessing to the
[43:18] reading of his word you may be seated
[43:20] tonight my title
[43:25] tonight is aise and build amen my
[43:29] subtitle is bethl we know that bethl
[43:32] means the house of
[43:35] God praise the Lord so we read here in
[43:37] the scripture Stephen is
[43:40] saying that the Lord is looking for a
[43:43] house to dwell in he doesn't dwell in
[43:45] Temple made with hands he now has come
[43:47] to dwell in a people amen that's what
[43:50] Calvary was the change of dispensations
[43:52] now the Holy Ghost is given freely we no
[43:55] longer need the temple
[43:57] on the Earth but he's looking for temple
[43:59] for a place to live a house to live in
[44:02] amen so you amen filled with the Holy
[44:05] Spirit are bethl the house of God Amen
[44:09] and so we read in Nehemiah that um
[44:11] they're build rebuilding the walls of
[44:13] Jerusalem I tell myself every time I'm
[44:15] not going to roll up my sleeves or take
[44:16] off my jacket and I do
[44:19] both praise the Lord amen so Nehemiah
[44:23] went back to Jerusalem to begin building
[44:25] the walls the uh
[44:28] for for ease of speech I'm going to call
[44:31] them the enemy because I cannot repeat
[44:33] those names from memory but the enemy is
[44:35] is uh coming against Nehemiah and the
[44:37] guys there that are working on Jerusalem
[44:40] and um they're afraid that's why the
[44:42] enemy attacks you you know that it's
[44:44] because he's afraid so they're afraid
[44:46] they see Jerusalem being built back up
[44:48] right that they're over there in Syria
[44:50] or Samaria and uh they've got things
[44:53] pretty good right they're buddies but
[44:55] buddy buddies with Nebuchadnezzar but
[44:56] then
[44:57] um or Babylon because this was exes at
[45:01] this time but but then now there's this
[45:03] uh rebuilding of Jerusalem they thought
[45:05] they were in with the bosses in Babylon
[45:08] and then here comes along this news they
[45:10] did not get word of Amen Nehemiah while
[45:13] he's handing the cup to the king that
[45:15] the king says Nehemiah you look
[45:17] distressed and we'll read this and he
[45:18] says oh oh King uh you know let let
[45:21] forgive me for speaking freely but my
[45:23] heart is burdened for Jerusalem so the
[45:25] king gives him a note gives him some
[45:27] time off and sends him to Jerusalem and
[45:29] so now there's a threat being built up
[45:32] why because the walls of Jerusalem are
[45:34] being built again and so the Lord is is
[45:37] is coming back this is after the 70
[45:39] weeks of Daniel and now it's being built
[45:42] back up because God is once again in
[45:46] favor of his of his children and uh but
[45:50] to to to get to to that point we need to
[45:52] just step back in history a little bit
[45:55] to the fall of Jerusalem turn with me to
[45:57] 2 Kings chapter
[46:01] 25 praise the Lord 2 Kings chapter
[46:11] 25 if you'll notice if you want to go
[46:13] back this evening or tomorrow in your
[46:15] devotions you can read just a couple
[46:17] chapters before this is when Josiah is
[46:20] King so just you know he restores the
[46:23] the temple restores the word he asks the
[46:25] priest to come read it and there there's
[46:27] a time of restoration a time of
[46:28] returning of the word but yet because
[46:31] there was yet not something that could
[46:32] instill within a man's heart that could
[46:34] keep him from sinning or keep him from
[46:37] from angering God and and because the
[46:40] law as we know was impossible to keep
[46:44] and U and a man would fall by the law so
[46:48] God his great plan was to send us Grace
[46:50] and the blood of Jesus Christ and so you
[46:52] see just after Josiah is King we see the
[46:55] end of jerus Jem in this point in
[46:58] history and um 2 Kings 25 verse 1 and it
[47:03] came to pass in the 9th year and this is
[47:05] 10 verses so bear with me of his reign
[47:07] in the 10th month in the 10th day of the
[47:09] month that Nebuchadnezzar King of
[47:11] Babylon came he and all his host now he
[47:13] is returning back if you go into the
[47:15] beginning of chapter 24 just after the
[47:18] death of the King after Josiah uh it
[47:21] says that jeho Kim became
[47:23] Nebuchadnezzar's servant for three years
[47:25] then he rebelled against him so
[47:27] somewhere in there there was a pact made
[47:29] or something and you forgive me if my
[47:30] history is incorrect but now he Rebels
[47:32] against them so Nebuchadnezzar comes and
[47:36] um he
[47:38] uh besieges the city and so forth but
[47:41] then but Jerusalem's Still Standing
[47:43] there's still a king and so that's where
[47:44] we pick up here and so in the 10th month
[47:47] the 10th day of the month that
[47:49] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came he
[47:51] and all his host against Jerusalem
[47:53] because zedekiah rebelled against the
[47:55] king of Babylon there we go and the city
[47:57] was
[47:58] besieged oh excuse me and all his host
[48:00] against Jerusalem and pitched against it
[48:02] and they built forts against it round
[48:04] about so they were planning on staying
[48:06] as long as
[48:07] necessary amen the enemy has come in and
[48:10] camped about the city and the city was
[48:12] besieged unto the 11th year of King
[48:19] zedekiah and on the n9th day of the
[48:21] fourth month the famine prevailed in the
[48:24] city and there was no bread for the
[48:26] people of the land and the city was
[48:28] broken up and all the men of War fled By
[48:31] Night by the way of the gate between two
[48:32] walls which is by the King's Garden now
[48:35] the chales were against the city round
[48:37] about and the King went the way toward
[48:39] the plane now if I'm correct Jeremiah
[48:41] gave told zedekiah to give himself to
[48:44] Nebuchadnezzar and all would be well but
[48:46] zedekiah refused to obey that word from
[48:49] the Lord and he ran and this is what
[48:51] happens here and the army of the chales
[48:53] pursued after the king and overtook him
[48:54] in the plains of Jericho and all his
[48:56] army
[48:57] were scattered from him so they took the
[48:59] king and brought him up to the king of
[49:01] Babylon to riblah and they gave judgment
[49:04] upon him and they slew the sons of
[49:06] zedekiah before his eyes and then put
[49:08] out the eyes of
[49:10] zedekiah and bound him with feather feds
[49:13] of brass and carried him to Babylon and
[49:15] in the fifth month on the seventh day of
[49:16] the month which is the 19th year of the
[49:18] of King Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon
[49:21] came nebu zaran captain of the Guard a
[49:24] servant of the king of Babylon unto
[49:26] jerus Jerusalem and he burnt the house
[49:28] of the Lord and the King's house and all
[49:29] the houses of Jerusalem and every great
[49:31] man's house burnt he with fire and all
[49:34] the army of the chis that were with the
[49:36] captain of the Guard Break Down The
[49:37] Walls of Jerusalem round about and so
[49:40] from there on that from that point in
[49:42] history for we see Daniel and the the
[49:45] the the three Hebrew children and the 70
[49:47] weeks of Daniel up to Ezra and Nehemiah
[49:51] and so um Nehemiah comes to a place so
[49:54] first of all the children of Israel
[49:55] stepped out from behind the will of God
[49:58] I have a quote I'm going to skip ahead
[49:59] to it brother brandham says in the angel
[50:01] of the Lord 1951 when Israel got out of
[50:03] the will of God they suffered for it we
[50:06] will too so you be reverent and remember
[50:08] that now amen amen that's straight and
[50:11] that's not to scare
[50:13] you as to say because the Lord is
[50:16] gracious and he will give you a little
[50:18] spanking and get you back in behind his
[50:20] will but there's places in the message
[50:23] where it says that brother BR says that
[50:25] if you the devil can't get to you step
[50:27] till you step out from behind the will
[50:28] of God and so the children of Israel
[50:32] stepped out into this place and we see
[50:34] the destroying of the walls of Jerusalem
[50:37] if we pick this story up in Nehemiah
[50:39] chapter 1 we have a few scriptures we're
[50:41] just turning back and forth to tonight
[50:43] but apparent maybe you guys some of you
[50:45] need to
[50:47] practice where's Nehemiah again Nehemiah
[50:51] 1 verse 1 the words of Nehemiah the son
[50:54] of hakah and it came came to pass in the
[50:57] month just SL in the 20th year as I was
[51:01] in Shu shushan the palace that hananiah
[51:05] one of my brethren came he and certain
[51:07] men of J Judah and I asked them
[51:09] concerning the Jews that had escaped
[51:11] which were left of the Captivity and
[51:13] concerning
[51:15] Jerusalem and they said unto me the
[51:17] remnant that are left of the Captivity
[51:19] there in in the province are in great
[51:21] Affliction and approach the wall of
[51:23] Jerusalem also is broken down and the
[51:26] Gates thereof are burned with fire and
[51:28] it came to pass when I heard these words
[51:30] that I sat down and wept and mourned
[51:32] certain days and fasted and prayed
[51:35] before the god of
[51:37] heaven so Nehemiah gets this news and
[51:40] he's he's stricken down because his home
[51:43] Jerusalem is in Ruins uh those that are
[51:46] there that are living there that are
[51:47] surviving are underneath great
[51:49] Affliction and uh he he he he he's
[51:52] weeping over this and he's praying to
[51:54] the god of heaven and you can read his
[51:56] prayer there but he's beseeching the
[51:58] Lord he's saying Lord you know keep the
[52:00] Covenant and and mercy for so he says in
[52:03] verse 5 he say and I beseech thee Oh
[52:05] Lord God Of Heaven the great and
[52:07] terrible God that keepeth Covenant and
[52:09] mercy for them that love him and observe
[52:11] his Commandments let thine ear now be
[52:14] attentive and that eyes open that thou
[52:16] mayest hear the prayer of thy servant
[52:18] which I pray before thee now day and
[52:20] night for the children of Israel thy
[52:22] servants anden I guess we're going to
[52:24] read the prayer and confess the sins of
[52:26] the children of Israel which we have
[52:27] sinned against thee both I and my
[52:28] father's house have sinned so he goes on
[52:31] to say we've dealt corruptly and all
[52:33] these things and he says in verse 11 oh
[52:34] Lord I beseech you let now thine ear be
[52:36] attented to the prayer of thy servant
[52:37] and the prayer of thy servants who
[52:39] desire to fear who desire to fear thy
[52:42] name and prosper I pray thee thy servant
[52:44] this day and Grant him Mercy in the
[52:47] sight of this man for I was the king's
[52:49] cup Bearer so he's saying he's
[52:51] beseeching the Lord say give me favor
[52:53] with the King that I may ask to go back
[52:56] to Jerusalem to begin to rebuild and
[53:00] um there on a little bit further he he's
[53:03] before the king and um so God sends
[53:07] Nehemiah back and Nehemiah has
[53:10] instructions he has a certificate that
[53:12] he's allowed to start building from the
[53:14] King but it was a secret thing and so he
[53:17] goes back and he begins to he he he goes
[53:20] back with some delegates of Babylon and
[53:22] in the middle of the night he Saddles up
[53:23] his horse and he goes and he inspects
[53:25] the city and he says he says he did this
[53:28] in the night so they that were with him
[53:29] wouldn't know what he was doing so not
[53:33] only the king sounds like knew Nehemiah
[53:36] was his desire was to rebuild the walls
[53:38] of Jerusalem everyone else thought he
[53:40] was just going there to check things out
[53:43] and visit it but we see here that
[53:46] Nehemiah begins to rebuild the walls of
[53:48] Jerusalem and there's a a great list of
[53:51] everyone that pitched in and helped and
[53:53] um everyone took their place around the
[53:56] city they begin to rebuild the walls and
[53:58] they rebuil they were rebuilding the
[54:00] walls of Jerusalem against adversity and
[54:03] the Ws of the enemy the the enemy was
[54:05] coming at them from all sides they
[54:07] started with with threats they started
[54:09] with laughing and scorning them as I
[54:12] said they were the critics amen but as
[54:14] we heard the critic doesn't matter amen
[54:17] and so and so they're they're there
[54:18] they're working and and in verse chapter
[54:20] 4 it says and and conspired all of them
[54:23] to Nehemiah 4:8 conspired all of them to
[54:26] get to come and to fight against
[54:28] Jerusalem and to hinder it 4:1 15 and it
[54:32] came to pass when our enemies heard that
[54:33] it was known unto us and God had brought
[54:36] their counsel to not that we returned
[54:38] all of us to the wall everyone unto his
[54:41] work so they continued to build and they
[54:44] kept guard the men that were building
[54:46] that were working had their sword on
[54:48] their side and then there was the other
[54:50] half of them were standing
[54:52] roundabout guarding those that were
[54:54] working with The Sword and the spear and
[54:56] the different weapons of warfare they
[54:58] were on their guard as they were were
[55:01] rebuilding the City
[55:04] Jerusalem and uh we I'm going to pick
[55:06] read it again for remembrance we read at
[55:08] the beginning 7 uh Nehemiah 2:20 then
[55:12] answered I them and said unto them the
[55:13] god of Heaven he will prosper us
[55:16] therefore we his servants will arise and
[55:18] build that's where I get my title from
[55:20] but ye have no portion nor right nor
[55:23] Memorial in Jerusalem the devil has no
[55:26] right to your city the devil has no
[55:29] right or Memorial to your city God
[55:32] before the foundation of the world s
[55:34] handpicked you selected you to be here
[55:37] today to hear the news of today to to be
[55:40] caught up in this world excuse me caught
[55:43] in this world and but he has given you
[55:46] an an anointing he has given you the
[55:49] power and he's telling you to rise and
[55:52] build amen you are the house of God so
[55:55] we as Christians must continue to build
[55:58] while being on guard against the ATT the
[56:01] attacks of the enemy amen we get
[56:03] attacked sometimes we lose a couple of
[56:06] bricks maybe we lose a whole section of
[56:08] the wall and but God is saying rise up
[56:10] and build because he desires that you be
[56:14] the house of God Amen praise the lord we
[56:17] must fortify our families our personal
[56:20] walk with the Lord our Brethren around
[56:24] us boy that's where the devil lik to get
[56:26] in god starts to get you to talk about
[56:29] somebody else to spread rumors amen you
[56:32] you you've seen the the the funny
[56:34] stories right it starts off over here
[56:36] you know uh Paul Paul Johnny caught his
[56:40] finger and it gets 10 people down and
[56:42] Johnny cut his finger off amen the word
[56:45] goes through gossip goes through and
[56:47] then things grow and things get out of
[56:49] hand if they never would have said
[56:51] anything or gossiped about anything like
[56:53] that amen that would have never happened
[56:55] and so we're called to support and
[56:58] fortify the Brethren around us and the
[57:00] body of Believers that we serve with
[57:03] amen amen you are not just a called to
[57:06] sit on the Pew here at Grace Tabernacle
[57:09] you're are called to be a part of that
[57:11] sometimes that means calling up and say
[57:12] Hey brother I didn't see you in church
[57:14] is everything okay is all well I had a
[57:18] preacher one time I don't remember his
[57:19] who it
[57:22] was but he said you hear somebody who
[57:24] stopped going to church you call him and
[57:26] you he basically said you chew them out
[57:29] you tell them they you they know where
[57:30] they're supposed to be and why aren't
[57:32] they there and what's going on because
[57:34] the devil sneaks in and he likes to to
[57:37] get people off and say you know no one
[57:39] understands your problems no one knows
[57:40] how you feel and then and then if we're
[57:43] not careful you know we we don't shake
[57:44] their hand not meeting anything by it
[57:46] but the devil slips in and says see you
[57:48] don't belong here you're you're not
[57:50] you're not here and then your friends
[57:52] out over here in maybe another church

[58:08] here look how well you fit in if you're
[58:10] fitting in with the
[58:12] world you need to arise and build your
[58:15] wall right praise the Lord there's a
[58:17] concept my do my um daughter was
[58:19] learning and as was a bucket Dipper or a
[58:22] bucket filler meaning if you uh call
[58:25] someone names well then you're a bucket
[58:27] Dipper you're taking from that person
[58:29] but if you encourage them you're a
[58:31] bucket filler this is kind of funny
[58:33] because a picked it up and he Lena
[58:35] you're being a bucket
[58:38] Dipper but I ask you tonight are you a
[58:42] builder or a destroyer are you helping
[58:45] your brother see see every every every
[58:48] available family was working on the
[58:51] walls of Jerusalem they rebuilt the
[58:52] walls in 52 days
[58:56] of a big city why because they all did
[58:59] their part they all stepped up they they
[59:02] didn't they didn't worry about their own
[59:04] houses when you get to the the end of
[59:06] this of this what they did they it says
[59:08] None of the houses were were repaired
[59:10] yet they spent all their time right they
[59:12] weren't they weren't selfish in trying
[59:14] to to hold hoard their time into their
[59:16] own self if they would have done that
[59:19] guess what they would have never got the
[59:20] walls of then it wouldn't matter if they
[59:21] had an nice's house on the Block but
[59:24] they all stepped up to their position
[59:27] they all arose and begin to build up
[59:29] Jerusalem and the walls around it
[59:31] because those that was the very thing
[59:33] that would bring them the protection
[59:35] that they needed against the enemy many
[59:38] times we're we get caught up and we're
[59:40] building up our house so to speak within
[59:43] the walls and um we're making sure our
[59:47] job is well taken care of and we're
[59:49] making sure we have that nice Lexus or
[59:51] that nice BMW or that nice Mercedes or
[59:54] that lifted Ford or or that uh lifted
[59:57] Chevy excuse me and um if we're not
[1:00:01] careful we get caught up in that and our
[1:00:04] walls go to shambles around us and um
[1:00:07] it's the very thing that you're you're
[1:00:10] putting your time and your effort into
[1:00:12] that's not of God that's not now you
[1:00:15] need that something there nothing wrong

[1:00:23] want you to say you're a hypocrite
[1:00:27] everybody wants a nice Tru there's
[1:00:28] nothing wrong with that but if you're
[1:00:30] forsaking your walk with the Lord for
[1:00:32] that then maybe you ought to go with a
[1:00:35] little Dodge

[1:01:49] around you in good standing praise the
[1:01:52] Lord that is what keeps the enemy out

[1:01:58] age he says now why did this have to be
[1:02:00] so why was it that the seed of the
[1:02:03] serpent must come this way Man was
[1:02:05] created for God man was to be the temple
[1:02:09] of God the place of God's rest the Holy
[1:02:12] Spirit was the place of God's rest the
[1:02:15] Holy Spirit was man so in man the temple
[1:02:19] he reads acts 7: 46:51 we'll pick up
[1:02:22] after that Satan has known this all
[1:02:24] along he also wants to indwell man even
[1:02:27] as God so does but God has reserved to
[1:02:31] himself that right Satan cannot do that
[1:02:36] God Alone appeared in human flesh Satan
[1:02:38] could not and cannot do that he does not
[1:02:41] have creative Powers the only way for
[1:02:43] Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do
[1:02:46] was to enter the serpent in Eden even as
[1:02:49] he entered by evil spirits into the
[1:02:51] swine at go gadara God does not enter an
[1:02:55] animal but Satan can and will to
[1:02:57] accomplish his ends he could not have a
[1:02:59] child directly by Eve as God did by Mary
[1:03:02] so he entered into the serpent and then
[1:03:04] beguiled Eve he seduced her and by her
[1:03:07] did Satan have a child vicariously Cain
[1:03:10] bore the full spiritual characteristics
[1:03:12] of Satan and he goes on and he says no
[1:03:15] wonder the holy spirit said that Cain
[1:03:16] was of that Wicked one he was so Man was
[1:03:19] created for God that the
[1:03:22] enemy cannot he says here um that God
[1:03:27] has reserved the right for himself to
[1:03:29] indwell in man and the enemy cannot do
[1:03:32] that but what happened was Eve Let Down
[1:03:34] the Walls amen a a word came and that
[1:03:38] word was contrary to the word of God and
[1:03:42] anything contrary to the word of God has
[1:03:45] one intent and that is to break down
[1:03:47] your wall amen now those attacks come
[1:03:51] and walls have to be kept in repair but
[1:03:54] what happened was Eve let the enemy slip
[1:03:58] in and because of that now we have flesh
[1:04:02] what we have to deal with but even then
[1:04:05] it was all part of God's great plan
[1:04:09] amen Man was created for God to be
[1:04:12] otherwise is destruction you see someone
[1:04:15] who is who in the world they're they're
[1:04:18] they're influenced and they they're
[1:04:20] anointed of the
[1:04:22] devil it brings destruction on their
[1:04:26] life it brings destruction on their
[1:04:28] bodies physically you see a
[1:04:30] deterioration why because man was not
[1:04:32] created to be anointed like that what
[1:04:36] happened to Cain right amen and and and
[1:04:40] Cain Cain went out and now we have you
[1:04:42] know all this this problems in the world
[1:04:45] because of what happened there in the
[1:04:47] garden of the E of Eden I lost my train
[1:04:49] thought there forgive
[1:04:50] me but God desires to dwell inside of
[1:04:54] man and we are a house built for him
[1:04:58] amen Matthew 7:2 24-27 says therefore
[1:05:01] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[1:05:03] and doth them I will liken him unto a
[1:05:06] wise man which built his house upon a
[1:05:08] rock so what gives you the ability to
[1:05:12] arise and build and keep fortified it is
[1:05:14] the word of God you don't have to
[1:05:17] physically start putting bricks around
[1:05:19] your house if you did people would be
[1:05:21] wondering where's your building permit
[1:05:22] and what you're doing and um they would
[1:05:26] call you crazy but they already do so
[1:05:29] that's all right amen but when you hear
[1:05:31] the word of God it is the word of God
[1:05:33] that builds up your walls but yet you
[1:05:37] are called as an individual as a son or
[1:05:40] daughter of God to rise up to take your
[1:05:44] place to do your part guess what the
[1:05:46] children of Israel still had to cross
[1:05:48] over Jordan themselves God didn't lift
[1:05:51] them up and carry them across so to
[1:05:53] speak he provided the way but first the
[1:05:56] priest had to step into the water first
[1:06:00] the children the three Hebrew children
[1:06:01] had to step into the fire amen before
[1:06:04] God came along and paved the way and
[1:06:09] when when God when God parted the Waters
[1:06:11] of the River Jordan amen he was giving
[1:06:14] he was he was surrounding them with his
[1:06:17] protection when he sent them into the
[1:06:19] promised land to begin to take it and to
[1:06:21] begin to defeat the enemies just like
[1:06:23] you are doing God has anointed you and
[1:06:26] given you what you need to fight against
[1:06:29] that amen and what is the very first
[1:06:32] thing that children of Israel did when
[1:06:34] they crossed into their promised they
[1:06:37] tore down some walls amen that's the
[1:06:40] first thing you did when you received
[1:06:42] Jesus Christ as your savior and God
[1:06:44] filled you with the Holy Ghost it was
[1:06:46] time now to bring down those walls but
[1:06:49] guess what you can't do it on your own
[1:06:51] maybe there's a Jericho in your life it
[1:06:53] doesn't have to be something crazy and
[1:06:55] something weird it could be something as
[1:06:57] simple as Pride or something as simple
[1:06:59] as your job is now coming before your
[1:07:01] walk with the Lord or or your nice truck
[1:07:04] is coming before you have a Jericho in
[1:07:06] your life amen amen it's now time for
[1:07:09] you to what all they did was March
[1:07:12] around it and then they worshiped they
[1:07:15] yelled they blew the trumpets they
[1:07:17] yelled in Victory while the walls were
[1:07:20] still standing but it was that
[1:07:22] Declaration of Victory which is what a
[1:07:25] test of faith that brought the walls
[1:07:28] down you show God that you are willing
[1:07:30] to to look
[1:07:33] foolish
[1:07:34] yeah and then Shou in Victory when
[1:07:37] there's still an enemy that's right amen
[1:07:41] and he says okay I'll bring those walls
[1:07:44] down they if they would have tried to do
[1:07:46] it on their own if they would have built
[1:07:47] great Machines of warfare and tried to
[1:07:49] bring it down guess what they would have
[1:07:51] been totally defeated but because Joshua
[1:07:55] took the word of the Lord and then acted
[1:07:58] upon that amen the children of Israel
[1:08:02] received the
[1:08:04] victory but then sin came in the camp
[1:08:07] with
[1:08:09] Ain something in the
[1:08:13] walls wasn't right the enemy slipped in
[1:08:17] because one man went against God's word
[1:08:21] amen anything in your life that goes
[1:08:23] against God's word is hindering the
[1:08:26] strength of your walls that's right amen
[1:08:29] praise the Lord the rains will descend
[1:08:31] the floods will come the winds will blow
[1:08:34] and beat upon the house but it will fall
[1:08:36] not for it is founded upon the rock
[1:08:39] which is what a revelation of Jesus
[1:08:41] Christ that's why that is so so so
[1:08:44] important and why the devil hates it so
[1:08:47] much because it is that Revelation that
[1:08:50] will hold you in the storm amen that's
[1:08:54] right it is that Revelation that
[1:08:56] Revelation is
[1:08:59] that is revelation is the stone amen the
[1:09:04] holy spirit is the mortar that's right
[1:09:07] praise the Lord you can't have one
[1:09:10] without the other there is no wall
[1:09:12] without the Holy Spirit and revelation
[1:09:15] of the word of God because those two go
[1:09:17] hand in hand amen God gives you the Holy
[1:09:20] Ghost upon your faith as a confirmation
[1:09:22] of the faith you have but what is faith
[1:09:25] faith is revelation so Satan will tear
[1:09:28] down the walls of Jerusalem he cannot
[1:09:30] dwell unless the walls are torn down so
[1:09:33] he is always attacking them amen why
[1:09:36] doesn't he attack the drunk on the
[1:09:39] street there ain't no walls that's right
[1:09:42] why does he attack you because you've
[1:09:44] got a nice fortified City amen if you
[1:09:48] quit building and fortifying your walls
[1:09:51] will be penetrated you finish it right
[1:09:54] just as this is the type of the parable
[1:09:56] of the man that cleaned his house you
[1:09:58] finish the walls man they're looking
[1:10:01] nice I mean they are thick you can run
[1:10:04] three Chariots of breast around them you
[1:10:07] got big beams in the doors a big old bar
[1:10:10] across to lock it but then you sat back
[1:10:13] and you thought I have arrived oh Lord
[1:10:16] help us you have never arrived right you
[1:10:20] are never
[1:10:22] too you have you have never had too too
[1:10:25] many years in the message to go to the
[1:10:27] altar that's right you have never had
[1:10:29] too many years in the message to repent
[1:10:32] to someone and ask for forgiveness you
[1:10:35] have never had too many years in the
[1:10:37] message to not be moved by the word of
[1:10:40] God when it's being preached and show
[1:10:42] some emotion you're not called to sit in
[1:10:45] the back because you have
[1:10:48] arrived that's right you're no different
[1:10:50] than a Pharisee you have arrived to
[1:10:52] blindness to your own problems is what
[1:10:54] you've done
[1:10:55] amen and what happens you sit back you
[1:10:58] take a break you go to the Bahamas not
[1:11:01] actually and your walls start to fall
[1:11:04] apart that's right cuz guess what
[1:11:07] there's no work being put into it amen
[1:11:10] you're not maintaining it man Zig
[1:11:13] Ziggler he was an inspirational speaker
[1:11:15] and a Christian had a lot of good stuff
[1:11:17] he says I recommend he says inspiration
[1:11:20] is very important I recommend a daily
[1:11:22] dose you can't just hear something
[1:11:24] really good or or go to a really good
[1:11:26] service and be good forever why because
[1:11:30] the effects that that has upon you the
[1:11:33] effects a morning devotion or a time in
[1:11:36] prayer or a tape listen to has upon you
[1:11:39] as soon as you receive that effect and
[1:11:41] you're strengthen the devil starts going
[1:11:42] at you that's it at you and it will
[1:11:46] deteriorate if you don't continue to add
[1:11:49] to continue to add to to that and that
[1:11:52] is fortifying the walls around you you
[1:11:56] that's it so remember why did the walls
[1:11:58] of Jerusalem get destroyed in the first
[1:12:00] place the children of Israel got out of
[1:12:02] the will of God anytime right anytime
[1:12:06] you are not spending time with the Lord
[1:12:09] every single day you're technically out
[1:12:11] of the will of God God has called you to
[1:12:13] a close relationship with him anything
[1:12:17] that that comes between it and you now
[1:12:20] don't you don't want to take this
[1:12:22] overboard because we live in the world
[1:12:25] don't quit your
[1:12:27] job that's right get up earlier amen I
[1:12:31] got free pointing back at me on that one
[1:12:34] stay up
[1:12:35] later yes sir some of you know don't you
[1:12:38] already stay up later enough I'm just
[1:12:40] kidding I'm kidding sorry that was Chris
[1:12:43] forgive
[1:12:44] me so had they stayed with the Lord and
[1:12:47] kept their walls fortified they would
[1:12:49] have never fallen we see under the rule
[1:12:52] of of Josiah it was peace right of
[1:12:55] strength because they were bringing the
[1:12:57] word back it is our neglect that causes
[1:13:02] the walls of our city to fall that's
[1:13:05] right that's right you say well well
[1:13:08] well you know we're supposed to just
[1:13:09] wait upon the Lord be still and know
[1:13:11] that I'm a go I am God that is
[1:13:15] scripture but just like lots of other
[1:13:17] scripture it can be taken out of
[1:13:20] context be still does not mean give up
[1:13:23] that's right on doing your apart and do
[1:13:26] nothing that's it that's exactly you
[1:13:28] know okay natural types of spiritual
[1:13:30] what happens if a man just sits and does
[1:13:34] nothing he loses all
[1:13:37] strength he gets
[1:13:39] soft he gets
[1:13:43] grumpy he gets
[1:13:47] fat yes and hungry for junk
[1:13:52] food we are called how do you possess
[1:13:56] what are you called to do possess how do
[1:13:59] you possess footsteps action you are
[1:14:03] being called to action arise and build
[1:14:06] guess what Nehemiah if he never would
[1:14:07] have went to
[1:14:08] Jerusalem if he never would have got
[1:14:10] everyone to start building the walls
[1:14:12] there would have never been any
[1:14:14] walls you say well well well Jerusalem
[1:14:17] was was part of God's plan and it's the
[1:14:19] children of Israel yes but you have to
[1:14:22] do your part amen praise the Lord you
[1:14:25] have to do your part so we must arise
[1:14:29] and build can we talk about this without
[1:14:32] going to James chapter
[1:14:37] 2 James chapter
[1:14:40] 2 verse
[1:14:47] 14 what doth it profit my brethren
[1:14:49] though a man say he hath faith and ha
[1:14:51] not works can Faith save him they say oh
[1:14:55] brother you're trying to make us all
[1:14:57] Catholics no their their works are done
[1:15:01] in in
[1:15:04] uh
[1:15:06] unbelief right their Works do not
[1:15:09] testify of Christ their worth worth
[1:15:13] excuse me their Works testify of
[1:15:16] religion that's
[1:15:18] right I wish I had that quote my wife FR
[1:15:21] me the other day it was some blanket
[1:15:23] statement saying you know
[1:15:25] uh religion is called to bring us all
[1:15:27] together religion is is is is being kind
[1:15:30] to one another and loving everyone and
[1:15:32] not excluding people and all this stuff
[1:15:35] and I
[1:15:36] said you're right religion is called to
[1:15:40] do that but Christ said I come to bring
[1:15:43] division between a mother and his her
[1:15:46] son or son and his
[1:15:49] father that's where people misunderstand
[1:15:51] Christ that's right brother R says when
[1:15:55] when Jesus braided that Whip and beat
[1:15:57] the money changers out of the temple
[1:15:58] that was compassion go out on the street
[1:16:01] tomorrow go to Starbucks and ask the
[1:16:03] person checking ask the tell her what
[1:16:06] does compassion
[1:16:10] mean praise God that's right but why do
[1:16:13] they hate it so much because they the
[1:16:17] spirit that they're under hates the
[1:16:19] spirit of
[1:16:21] Christ
[1:16:23] exactly man is
[1:16:26] funny because we just change definitions
[1:16:29] of words that's right we decide that
[1:16:32] this word is is just you know it's it's
[1:16:34] just too rude we're going to change what
[1:16:36] it means or or it's it's too
[1:16:39] like
[1:16:42] salty we are called the children of God
[1:16:45] to be salty guess what being salty means
[1:16:48] nowadays you're cantankerous you're
[1:16:51] grumpy you're
[1:16:53] offended amen
[1:16:56] you think oh it's silly that's funny but
[1:16:58] it's the devil that's exactly right
[1:17:01] because now you say I'm salty people
[1:17:02] laugh and say oh are you feeling grumpy
[1:17:06] no I'm feeling anointed of the Holy
[1:17:10] Ghost amen James chapter
[1:17:13] 2:14 uh 15 if a brother or sister be
[1:17:16] naked and destitute of daily food and
[1:17:17] one of you say unto them depart in peace
[1:17:20] be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding
[1:17:22] you give them not those things which are
[1:17:23] needful to the body
[1:17:25] what do it
[1:17:27] profit even so faith if it ha not works
[1:17:30] is dead being
[1:17:32] alone that's right yeah a man may say
[1:17:35] thou Hast faith and I have Works show me
[1:17:37] thy faith without thy works and I will
[1:17:39] show you show thee my faith by my Works
[1:17:43] thou believest that there is one God
[1:17:45] thou doest well the Devils also believe
[1:17:47] and
[1:17:48] tremble that's the big thing oh well you
[1:17:50] just got to believe Bible says you just
[1:17:52] got to believe
[1:17:56] you do yeah but there has to be a change
[1:17:59] that's right amen that's the big gospel
[1:18:01] denominations come as you are they leave
[1:18:03] off the end part yeah
[1:18:06] change amen come as you are until it's
[1:18:10] expected of you to know better praise
[1:18:12] the Lord but wilt thou know oh vain man
[1:18:15] that faith without works is dead was not
[1:18:18] Abraham Our Father justified by works
[1:18:20] when he had offered Isaac his son upon
[1:18:23] the altar
[1:18:28] seest thou how Faith wrought with his
[1:18:30] works and by works was Faith made
[1:18:32] perfect and the scripture was fulfilled
[1:18:34] which sayith Abraham believed God and it
[1:18:36] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[1:18:38] and he was called the friend of God ye
[1:18:41] see then how that by works a man is
[1:18:43] Justified and not by faith only likewise
[1:18:46] also was not Rahab the Harlot justified
[1:18:48] by works when she had received the
[1:18:49] messengers and had sent them out another
[1:18:51] way for as the body without the spirit
[1:18:53] is dead so faith without works is dead
[1:18:56] also Rahab
[1:18:59] acted upon the message she
[1:19:02] received she got a message from
[1:19:07] those spies
[1:19:09] that her walls of Doubt her walls of
[1:19:14] bondage to sin were about to come down
[1:19:18] and she said good Master what must I do
[1:19:21] to inherit eternal life they said cast
[1:19:23] the red Scarlet robe out the window and
[1:19:26] your whoever is in this house will be
[1:19:30] spared God has come to bring down the
[1:19:33] walls of bondage to separate you from
[1:19:36] your sin and whatever is in the house
[1:19:40] covered by the blood of Christ will be
[1:19:43] spared amen for the glory of God she
[1:19:47] accepted in faith the word that they
[1:19:50] gave her and acted upon it she could
[1:19:53] have heard the word many people have
[1:19:55] heard the word but not everyone has
[1:19:59] casted the red Scarlet excuse me the
[1:20:03] Scarlet rope out the
[1:20:05] window guess what whoever walked by saw
[1:20:09] that rope hanging there amen everybody
[1:20:12] knew Rahab lived
[1:20:14] there right oh what's she doing now
[1:20:17] she now is she
[1:20:21] advertising she had to stand up and say
[1:20:24] you know what this is really weird a
[1:20:27] rope out the
[1:20:29] window but they told me to do it amen
[1:20:34] and I have faith so I'm going to amen
[1:20:37] act upon
[1:20:39] it amen
[1:20:41] around anywhere the message anything
[1:20:45] people say oh I received the word I
[1:20:48] heard it it was fantastic but there's no
[1:20:52] Scarlet thread rope hanging from their
[1:20:56] window you say you say you have faith
[1:20:59] but I see no outward appearance of that
[1:21:02] faith that you have all I see is walls
[1:21:06] of the enemy cuz guess what the devil
[1:21:08] tears down your walls then he comes in
[1:21:10] and builds his own that's right but you
[1:21:13] can't have two cities in the same spot
[1:21:15] that's right one has to be moved aside
[1:21:18] for the other to be
[1:21:19] built amen but God has given you the
[1:21:22] ability God has come with a message
[1:21:24] message amen God has come with w w with
[1:21:27] with a message to you saying arise and
[1:21:30] shine for thy light has come light
[1:21:33] pierced the darkness in rahab's life
[1:21:36] light pierced into the darkness of her
[1:21:39] family and with the destruction of
[1:21:41] Jericho brought her her freedom but the
[1:21:45] story doesn't end there as we well know
[1:21:47] she went on to be in the lineage of
[1:21:50] Christ guess what God came along broke
[1:21:54] down your wall set you free gave you a
[1:21:57] place in the city of God surrounded by
[1:22:01] the walls of faith and Revelation and
[1:22:04] then he placed you into the kingdom of
[1:22:07] God it doesn't matter where you lived
[1:22:09] before it doesn't matter the walls that
[1:22:11] you had built in your life before God
[1:22:14] has come and restored you to your
[1:22:18] promise because rad was always in the
[1:22:21] mind of God she had a memorial there was
[1:22:24] a Memorial of Rahab in Jerusalem and it
[1:22:28] was time for her to go back to her place
[1:22:31] that she was called to be you say she
[1:22:33] was a gentile doesn't matter what you
[1:22:35] are or what the world calls you or what
[1:22:38] the world has labeled you you are called
[1:22:41] there is a memorial of you in the new
[1:22:43] City Jerusalem that has your name on it
[1:22:46] there's a seat there's a house there's a
[1:22:48] street with your name on it amen and God
[1:22:52] has given you the strength and he has
[1:22:55] called you bethl the house of God Amen
[1:22:58] where God dwells there is freedom
[1:23:01] because God and because Christ is truth
[1:23:04] and where the truth is there is freedom
[1:23:08] amen you are built building walls around
[1:23:11] you but those walls bring you freedom to
[1:23:14] worship god oh oh the world says be open
[1:23:18] to
[1:23:19] everything be open to you need to be
[1:23:22] don't be so closed-minded
[1:23:26] don't be so don't you know be
[1:23:28] inclusive include everybody except for
[1:23:32] the
[1:23:33] truth except for the truth because guess
[1:23:36] what cockroaches hate
[1:23:39] light they want to hide in the darkness
[1:23:41] that's
[1:23:42] right there is nothing new Under the Sun
[1:23:45] don't ever think what you're going
[1:23:47] through has never been gone through by
[1:23:49] anybody
[1:23:50] else that was some Backwoods English
[1:23:54] there
[1:23:55] you are not experiencing anything
[1:23:58] someone hasn't experienced as well
[1:24:00] that's
[1:24:01] right lean on the brothers lean on the
[1:24:04] sisters as a bride of Christ come
[1:24:07] together amen Reach Out say you don't
[1:24:09] have to tell them just say look I need
[1:24:11] some prayer today I need some fellowship
[1:24:14] can I talk to you on the phone and just
[1:24:16] talk about God Amen you know it's good
[1:24:20] to address problems but don't stop there
[1:24:24] go on and talk about Christ because when
[1:24:28] you do he comes near and when he comes
[1:24:30] near what happens miracles happen amen
[1:24:33] praise the Lord so you see you say you
[1:24:36] have faith what do your walls look like
[1:24:39] that's
[1:24:40] it you say you've accepted the word for
[1:24:43] your
[1:24:44] hour what do your walls look like are
[1:24:47] there are they leaning in spots because
[1:24:50] you don't have time to make it right my
[1:24:53] uh my grandpa was a a a blocky when he
[1:24:56] was a young man and uh he was on this
[1:25:00] one job him and him and this guy he
[1:25:02] worked with all the time they thought on
[1:25:04] the same wavelength he said they could
[1:25:05] lay a thousand block a
[1:25:09] day and they were laying this
[1:25:12] wall and they were up I think three
[1:25:14] tiers of scaffolding and they had moved
[1:25:17] so fast the whole wall was still green
[1:25:19] and if you push it it would go like this
[1:25:22] well the scaffolding fell down for
[1:25:23] whatever reason they had to jump on the
[1:25:25] wall and they're up there you know
[1:25:27] wobbling all over the
[1:25:29] place now it was it if you don't take
[1:25:32] the time to make sure your mortar sets
[1:25:36] you get to billing into the skies and
[1:25:38] guess what it comes tumbling down you
[1:25:41] have to take the time with Christ take
[1:25:44] the time to make sure it's done right
[1:25:46] take the time to make sure you're
[1:25:48] fortified it's like the the the seed
[1:25:50] that fell and sprung up really quickly
[1:25:52] but then but then uh the attack came and
[1:25:56] it and it crumpled underneath the
[1:25:58] pressure that wall that they were
[1:26:00] building up they built it too fast and
[1:26:03] it wasn't had no strength behind it so
[1:26:05] you say oh well I have bricks and I have
[1:26:07] mortar and I I have all this stuff up
[1:26:09] there but it's all willy-nilly and it's
[1:26:10] all
[1:26:11] wobbly it looks like the
[1:26:15] message but there's no strength in it
[1:26:17] that's it it sounds like the message it
[1:26:20] sounds like the word of God I should say
[1:26:22] but there's no strength in it amen
[1:26:25] they they they talk it they say what
[1:26:27] that comes out of their mouth oh it
[1:26:28] sounds and lines up with everything but
[1:26:31] as we have seen in recent times they can
[1:26:34] preach it yeah for years and never have
[1:26:38] a revelation of it that's exactly right
[1:26:40] they had walls with no strength to
[1:26:44] them are the gates open because you are
[1:26:47] too busy at work you rushed off left the
[1:26:51] gates wide open
[1:26:55] amen praise the
[1:26:57] Lord so in the Garden of Eden the
[1:27:01] serpent or excuse me the
[1:27:03] devil slipped in to Mankind through the
[1:27:08] serpent put injected his seed into Eve
[1:27:10] through the serpent he broke down the
[1:27:12] walls of
[1:27:14] mankind
[1:27:16] but there came a
[1:27:18] Nehemiah a message from an angel Mary
[1:27:21] you shall conceive of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:25] God said you know what it's been Time
[1:27:28] Time After Time Gone by that my children
[1:27:31] don't have what they need to stand
[1:27:34] against the Ws of the devil Satan you
[1:27:38] thought you had the victory but I'm
[1:27:40] sending
[1:27:42] Nehemiah so God came down took went to
[1:27:46] Calvary for your sins and sent the Holy
[1:27:49] Ghost to give you the ability so never
[1:27:53] again will the walls of Jerusalem in
[1:27:55] your life lay waste because God has
[1:27:58] given you Nehemiah amen with the word
[1:28:01] that says arise and build amen that's
[1:28:05] right then the physical Jerusalem in in
[1:28:08] uh 96 or 830 I saw two different or I I
[1:28:13] thought it was 8030 then I saw 896 so
[1:28:15] you forgive me was it was once again
[1:28:17] taken down you see Jerusalem laid waste
[1:28:19] the city right but that's not where God
[1:28:22] was anymore God was now in his
[1:28:25] people but then you see the bride the
[1:28:29] seed of God goes into the Dark
[1:28:32] Ages the walls so to speak right the
[1:28:36] seed goes down into the ground martyr
[1:28:38] after martyr but then
[1:28:42] Nehemiah came back
[1:28:45] amen all the things that were lost in
[1:28:48] those Dark Ages all the parts of the
[1:28:50] walls that were broken down a as the
[1:28:52] word of God in those Dark Ages God sent
[1:28:56] Nehemiah and he took all those loose
[1:28:58] ends all those things that were were
[1:29:00] messed up the gates the broken Gates the
[1:29:03] Broken Walls he brought it all together
[1:29:05] and he built it back up again and once
[1:29:08] again the walls of Jerusalem are built
[1:29:11] up again now I'm taking this into a
[1:29:13] different type here now you can find
[1:29:16] refuge in that City that's it there you
[1:29:19] are you can find refuge in that City
[1:29:22] that God has come and built it back up
[1:29:24] again the world is in chaos out
[1:29:29] there right but you have Refuge amen
[1:29:35] amen the invitation is open for anyone
[1:29:38] to find refuge in the city it's funny
[1:29:41] how we as humans we as people we fight
[1:29:44] against the very thing that can give us
[1:29:46] Refuge that can give us peace we push so
[1:29:50] hard to get out of the gate and into the
[1:29:55] wild because we know what
[1:29:57] best the bills are due I can't come to
[1:30:06] church the bills are due I can't pay my
[1:30:09] tith the bills are due
[1:30:13] whatever blank insert your excuse
[1:30:18] there but God has provided a City of
[1:30:22] Refuge for you he has provided you peace
[1:30:26] he says Shalom amen Shalom I give you
[1:30:29] peace outside is all fear do you want to
[1:30:32] go outside the walls into this chaos no
[1:30:35] sir you say
[1:30:38] no I hope you're not right but I would
[1:30:41] rather sleep at
[1:30:43] night than be a billionaire yes sir I
[1:30:47] would rather have my wife and my kids
[1:30:50] than be Bill Gates amen sir that's right
[1:30:55] Steve Jobs right he had it all the money
[1:30:59] the brains the best product as far as
[1:31:02] technology was concerned yet when he
[1:31:05] died he said what was it it was
[1:31:07] pointless he says if I could give it all
[1:31:11] up to be to not be here dying with
[1:31:14] cancer I
[1:31:15] would come down to the end of the road
[1:31:19] what matters the
[1:31:22] most the the Lord provided a City of
[1:31:25] Refuge for the children of Israel and
[1:31:26] I'm coming to a close here I so sorry I
[1:31:28] didn't realize I had so
[1:31:29] much maybe we'll have a part
[1:31:34] two praise the Lord actually Sister Amy
[1:31:36] will you come
[1:31:42] Sean I'm I feel GL to just stop it right
[1:31:45] there the Lord is asking tonight what
[1:31:47] house will you build me that's right
[1:31:51] what does your house look like your
[1:31:53] walls
[1:31:55] is it strong and fortified or is it
[1:31:58] crumbling in parts so is not a
[1:32:02] a words to scare you I don't I don't I'm
[1:32:05] not getting
[1:32:08] that we have to do it daily exactly
[1:32:12] right we have to mix up the
[1:32:14] mortar I I uh we laid block with my
[1:32:17] grandpa and I I was the young guy so I
[1:32:19] did all the mortar mixing my goodness
[1:32:21] that mortar better be right if it's too
[1:32:24] soupy the bre the blocks won't set if
[1:32:27] it's too hard you can't work it you
[1:32:29] can't get it on the blocks the right way
[1:32:31] so it had to be perfect had to stick but
[1:32:34] not
[1:32:36] droop so it takes
[1:32:38] work you have a part to
[1:32:41] play and then guess what you set a block
[1:32:44] I've seen my grandpa set a block tap it
[1:32:46] into place level level level nope pull
[1:32:50] it off scrape the mortar off do it again
[1:32:54] knock it said it my dad wasn't experien
[1:32:56] so my dad pulled him off all the
[1:32:58] time but at the end of the day say my
[1:33:02] say say my grandpa set it in a couple in
[1:33:04] one try set three dad took several tries
[1:33:09] at the end of the day both blocks for
[1:33:11] sure some people takes them a little bit
[1:33:13] more time to set a
[1:33:15] block
[1:33:16] but that's why God looks at the desires
[1:33:19] of our heart he sees the work he sees
[1:33:22] the effort he sees the desire you're
[1:33:25] sitting there and you say I don't
[1:33:27] understand I have so many questions just
[1:33:29] keep laying the that's it just keep
[1:33:32] building your wall how do you build your
[1:33:34] wall feed on the word of God see
[1:33:36] everything goes back to that did you
[1:33:38] know that a no matter how great the
[1:33:40] sermon or how deep into the word of God
[1:33:43] you get it all goes back to that you
[1:33:44] have to read it you have to pray you
[1:33:47] have to feed on it you want to build
[1:33:49] your walls even if you don't understand
[1:33:51] it just read the Bible amen that's right
[1:33:54] even if you don't understand that just
[1:33:56] listen to the message even if you have
[1:33:59] nothing to say pray
[1:34:02] that's there's been many times where
[1:34:04] I've sat there and I I felt bad because
[1:34:06] I had nothing to say but just sitting
[1:34:09] there with my eyes closed thinking and
[1:34:11] feeling the presence of God I was
[1:34:14] communing with my Lord amen sometimes me
[1:34:17] and my wife in the evening we just sit
[1:34:18] there we don't got nothing to say we
[1:34:20] just sit there in each other's presence
[1:34:22] amen sometimes times that's all you have
[1:34:24] to do as a young man I struggled with
[1:34:26] things I had hardships I had friends who
[1:34:29] did things to me I had difficulties what
[1:34:32] is this what is the preacher saying I
[1:34:34] don't understand Lord give me Revelation
[1:34:36] give me Revelation give me Revelation so
[1:34:38] I would go out the back and I would sit
[1:34:41] there by myself and just just pray in My
[1:34:46] Heart Lord reveal yourself to me Time
[1:34:51] After Time After Time Again going to
[1:34:54] church feeding the best I could still
[1:34:56] making the same
[1:34:59] mistakes God is faithful and if you can
[1:35:01] do it for me he can do it for you cuz
[1:35:04] one day my eyes open wide and I tell you
[1:35:07] I cannot ever unsee what I saw and I
[1:35:12] went back and I went back to the
[1:35:15] scriptures and all the stories I read I
[1:35:18] felt like there was something missing it
[1:35:20] was there amen
[1:35:24] doesn't matter what you read you find
[1:35:27] Christ amen you find Christ but what did
[1:35:29] I have to do I had to
[1:35:32] persevere did I feel like a failure you
[1:35:35] bet did I did I feel like like why I
[1:35:39] remember laying in my bed one
[1:35:44] night and I knew of this girl around the
[1:35:46] corner I thought you know I to just slip
[1:35:48] out the window and go
[1:35:50] off just go off do my own thing
[1:35:54] I I wanted
[1:35:56] to I couldn't that's it I couldn't
[1:36:01] move I I it wasn't because my parents
[1:36:03] would be disappointed it wasn't because
[1:36:05] I would offend people it's because I
[1:36:06] just couldn't do it there were time I
[1:36:10] think about times after times after time
[1:36:12] when I was a teenager and and the things
[1:36:15] I think back now and I realize I was
[1:36:17] this close without even knowing it very
[1:36:21] naive

[1:36:25] you think you know it all and then yeah
[1:36:27] actually
[1:36:28] don't but that's okay you'll come to
[1:36:30] that
[1:36:32] realization this
[1:36:34] close I not even knowing the Trap was
[1:36:37] there The Edge was right there standing
[1:36:40] foot poised to step and something just
[1:36:42] turns me around that's right I didn't
[1:36:45] even know it was there cuz I couldn't
[1:36:48] see it but he knew he knew amen and by
[1:36:53] the gra of God I stand here today in his
[1:36:57] serviceall not because of I I did
[1:36:59] something but because God said you're
