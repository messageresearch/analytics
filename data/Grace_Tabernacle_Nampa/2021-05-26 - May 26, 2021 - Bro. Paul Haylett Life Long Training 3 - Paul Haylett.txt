here this evening amen so tonight i hope you kind of brought a sense of humor with you just a little bit of the scripture tonight struck me in a humorous fashion and i hope you don't find it offensive as i express that amen we'll be taking our our thought tonight um once again lifelong training we'll be taking that from uh proverbs the 23rd chapter verses one through five and uh just to uh look at the wisdom god bless you thank you so much this evening the wisdom that has contained has been contained through the generations in the scripture that we could take in this day to use for our benefit amen uh don't you like it when you can garner something of wisdom that that is directly beneficial to your life and uh that's always a beautiful thing amen so for those that are not with us tonight i know our brother tim uh always has to get up in the wee hours is how i view it of the morning to go to work brother david's sister and i and sister ruth are i believe in ohio or somewhere in that vicinity um i think brother sergey is and sister yulia and the family are visiting family uh so we just want to each one to list everyone but to each one remember them in prayer amen you know our sister kerry is helping mason as you would fulfill his desire to be a lacrosse player and to do well with that and and uh these are some of the things we get to enjoy in life so we just want to uh remember each and every one let's stand as we go to proverbs the 23rd chapter and uh we'll just look at these verses right here uh and uh we'll draw a little thought tonight uh from the first five verses of the 23rd chapter when thou sittest to eat with a ruler consider diligently what is before thee and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite be not desirous of his dainties for they are deceitful meat labor not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom well thou set on eyes upon that which is not for riches certainly make themselves wings they fly away as an eagle toward heaven heavenly father we just ask you to be with us tonight as we just take these thoughts from the book of proverbs these gems of wisdom and lord just look at them tonight and use them father to help us as we press forward in this life lord to know that every thing that would be placed before us in the natural father in the spiritual lord you have ordained for sons and daughters of god to use these for their benefit and father you have certainly sealed us according to the word uh lord you have sealed us father uh to the day of our redemption lord so knowing that whatever factors whatever things take place in the world around us father you have already made the way through it for us and we say thank you tonight lord just ask for your blessings upon the word upon the saints in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated saints on i think you probably kind of saw what i was talking about just a little bit of humor there but you know you would think about this i think in a way it would apply to any house that we might go to but we consider diligently what is before us before thee you know and i think it would apply to every house but here it says in the scripture when thou sittest with a ruler someone important uh you know consider diligently what is before thee and uh you know there's a phrase that says if it's too good to be true it probably is and sometimes we have seen through history we've seen the times we see in the first and second church ages how that they directly courted the christians to pull them into an alliance with them because they're trying to unite their kingdoms and so they had feasts and they had all kinds of things and we see men like constantine realize if i can pull the christians in and get their uh their allegiance and make them feel welcome then it will make my job much easier and yet the christians as brother branham says in the church age book they went and they had no business being there and so it was that they were in the midst of the kings and and rulers and it was there and you know they should have considered what was before them and you know the scripture here kind of gives us the idea that it's you sitting there with the ruler of what kind of food or whatever is given before you but i believe we can with uh with good diligence stretch this to what is the purpose why are we here at this table why are we here in this atmosphere and the scripture tells us that uh what fellowship does light have with darkness and we know that satan often times would try to woo in a certain fashion now my brother and sister we know also as the prophet gives uh a a little emphasis to that uh to bring us to the place to understand that sin will always take us further than we intended to go and so we'll see how that that uh time comes brother brown speaking there uh how that you would go and and because you're trying to please the host that uh maybe you would agree or do things that you would not have normally done and so i think when you sit down to eat with the ruler yeah sit down to do that that we should diligently look at what is before us not just simply in the realm as it were of the food but why are we here and what is the motive and and why did i accept this and you know sometimes my brother and sister once again taking some other thoughts from the message sometimes we go into something believing that we are the influencer only to find out when it's finished that we are the one that has been influenced and so we have to be really careful to understand why we are there and why people maybe want to be your friend so so to such a degree amen so you look at this and now i want to just kind of step into what i consider a little humorous part of this and i don't know maybe my humor is warped if it is forgive me but you know uh and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite and brother jason and i were joking in the back room just a little bit the guy that sits down at the king's table the ruler's table and he's just shoveling it in could i have some more send some more scraping the platters clean you know not a very good image amen to do that so you know it's telling here hold the knife uh put the knife to thy throat not someone else doing it but you literally causing your own self to have some form of decorum you know and uh you know oftentimes uh uh it is that it's hard somebody i mean let's face it i don't want to embarrass anybody but you know somebody makes a good apple pie and oftentimes there are fellowships there's two different sisters make two apple pies and and uh they're they're different from each other but they're both good and so i feel obligated to make sure that neither one of them is offended uh that there would be any of their pie left and so you know you have to be careful because then people are like uh you're eating another piece and it gives an image that you're kind of welcome can i use the terms that brother jason and i was using it gives the the idea or the image that you're a pig you know and and that's not a good image that's not something we want so you know it's kind of uh showing us here that you know if you're a man of appetite that's fine you know maybe stop as it were just forgive me this is a different age but stop it you know at burger king or wendy's or mcdonald's on your way home if you're still hungry but don't make a pig out of yourself don't don't you know leave that image and it says be not desirous of his dainties for they are deceitful meat and you know there's there's many times my brother and sister i won't go into it tonight but i have been in a situation i guess maybe why this resonates with me i've been in a situation before where someone was if you'd use the term that is common in the world someone was intent on whining and dining me and the real truth behind it was they wanted something from me and they wanted me to to come to a place and it's funny that sometimes what they want from you is not an object it is not money but they want to hear their point of view coming from your mouth think about it and they're willing to go to a great effort to whine and dine to get you to come as it were to their point of view so we look now and and this is kind of a little bit more where the direction of our fought tonight will be going labor not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom will thou set on eyes upon that which is not for riches certainly make themselves wings and they fly away as an eagle toward heaven and you know we live in a world that everything's focused the markets up real estate values are up uh all these kind of things promoting promoting promoting it's all about uh the money it's all about what uh it is there and i have a friend his in-laws on a very strategic piece of property and not very long ago people come and said we're gonna offer you just a ridiculous amount of money a 1.85 million and they said nope this is our home has been for 40 some years we're not moving and the same real estate lady come back four or five days later and said uh my principals have said they'll offer you 2.2 for it someone else a whole different person comes and says we'll give you 3.1 the last news is it's 5 million but yet the man is looking at where his family has been all these years and he has a degree of security i guess in his retirement and these people are flabbergasted that he is turning down five million dollars for 21 acres of land and so you know there they can't comprehend because to them there's no way you can resist something like that but you see the money didn't mean anything to him and brother branham says in the message believe us thou this he said i never desired to be rich i've i believe solomon i believe had the most level prayer to god that i ever heard he prayed that god wouldn't make him so rich that he would forget god and yet not to make him so poor that he would have to steal so just the comforts of life is what we desire is that right that's about where the most of us stand i guess and very fortunate and thankful to have that and now this is a prophet's word so when people sometimes get all nervous you you know message believers we don't talk about money we don't talk about successes we don't do this because somehow it sounds carnal but here's the prophet of god kind of dealing directly with that and laying this down you know what we don't want to be rich enough that we somehow start to forget that god is our provider and we don't want to come down into a wretched state where we would be tempted to to take something that was not ours and you know i remember as a young man uh that i used to change sprinkler pipe on a farm next door to an orchard and now as a young man i did not give it uh one thought to to walk out into the orchard in the season and pick an apple and eat it but one day we were there changing sprinkler pipe and here's these apples and i picked an apple and i'm munching on it when the manager of the orchard drives up and he gets out and he's angry and he says you know paul haylett because he knew my family paul haylet do you know you are a thief and it was then that the light turned on up to that point i never thought that i was stealing from them but see from his perspective i was stealing something of value from them and so we look at this sometimes and we just want to find the balance of perspective and i like this as brother branham says you know uh that he felt like this was the most level prayer to god that he ever heard how he's balancing this out lord i'd just like to have a little comfort in my life just a little security to enjoy some good things in our life and i believe we can say amen tonight can we not that we we don't we don't need to be fabulously rich we don't need to be caught up in all of these things but to be able to how now most of the time my brother and sister when we talk about the comforts of life cares of life it's often preached in kind of a negative connotation right the cares of life the comforts of life are going to distract you from serving god but yet i would like to just present a balanced thought to you tonight that uh god's okay i believe god's just fine with you finding a comfortable level in life but we just hold that old motto seek ye first the kingdom of god this scripture let it resonate with us seek ye first the kingdom if the good things of life come and life gets comfortable don't become so comfortable that the spirit of laodicea overtakes you amen hallelujah it's possible saints people can get so caught up in that amen now as we look at this we'll find now in first timothy 6 5 we'll find now i'm going to just kind of take the first scripture and we're going to jump out of it into a quote and we'll come back perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of truth in other words absolutely absent of truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself so when people start to look at this and believe that a natural success denotes some kind of a upper spiritual position a elevated spiritual position the prophet of god says right here in the message presuming he said in kingston jamaica at the racetrack last year where the lord was blessing they had a pentecostal minister there and i was with the christian businessman and i said we had from cuba from haiti from the islands around business and been sitting there last night and what did you fellows i said i'm ashamed of you now you've got to catch this because i'm i'm not going to go into the whole discourse but brother branham's talking about that there was a pentecostal minister there with him at the moment that he's talking about this and he's he's he's speaking to him as it were speaking to that man i'm ashamed of you what did you talk about a fleet of cadillacs i was a little bitty fellow in business down in the glory glory to god this is what he's recounting how their story would be i was a little bitty fellow in business down on the corner glory to god hallelujah the lord gave me this and the lord blessed this and the lord blessed that i said them men sat and looked at one another and i said i've been with you long enough till you know i knew their hearts the lord let me know it i seen what they was thinking about what are you telling them they belong to these big formal morgues we know he's talking about churches and they're prosperous they're billionaires i said how different you are always bragging about what you got and how much you accumulated in this much time how different it is from the original pentecost they sold everything they had and give to the poor i said you vice versa it them people knows all about what it means to be rich they want to find something that satisfies and got some life in it now if you go into the message presuming and go on this pentecostal uh preacher is telling brother branham that he was wrong that selling all that had and giving to the poor was a mistake because he says you know then when there come a little contention talking about whether it's of the holy ghost or not come a little contention he says they didn't even have a house to go back to and that was a mistake and brother braham says no that's what god wanted he wanted them to then go and disperse and preach the gospel to the world not go back home and shelter themselves in that house and then the talk about the fussing and the fightings but to go and i i encourage you to go read that now when you look at that my brother and sister the prophet of god is upset because they have come to this place that really instead of talking about the word of god they were there talking about their accomplishment talking about how big their church was how many people what they have and we can certainly look in the world today and you can see how that this prosperity gospel has come what they're doing the scripture says they're tickling the ears of the people they're not telling them the truth they're telling the people what the people want to hear but the underlying motive is they want to build up something that would then support or do what they would want in their style so we'll see how it is supposing that gain is godliness right here the scripture says from such withdraw thyself when people promote the size of the church the economics of the church the wealth of the church when they start to promote those things the scripture is telling us withdrawal from that pull back from those things because that is not how we measure godliness amen so we look at this now we'll go back to the scriptures verse six amen and it says but godliness with contentment is great gain it doesn't say contentment with a little bit of godliness but it's telling us godliness being the emphasis of this uh this uh uh sentence that uh we would come that if we are godly and we're content in our situation serving god there is what we would call great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out you know there's always the humorous jokes about you i've never seen an armored car pulling a hearse it's just not how it works we don't get to take it in fact i remember a man that i know quite well and he he kind of condemned me a little bit or no not condemned convicted me a little bit he made a statement like this he says paul why do you work so hard and i said i don't know i guess i enjoy it and he goes you realize you're just going to die and leave that to your children and i thought yeah what am i doing my children oh i have a daughter here tonight children don't deserve it and he said that's right let them work for their own but i'm sorry i i do like to work i like to build i like to create things you know as it were put things together it's not really creating but put things together but we can see the point because we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be there with content isn't it interesting in the day that we live in i get invitations on a very regular basis to go to motel up in boise to hear a speech on how that i could uh do this this and this they don't really reveal what that is but we have you know a five-step plan a 10-step plan that will make you fabulously wealthy a millionaire in six months now i wonder how many people go and buy all the books and buy all the literature and buy all of this stuff and the man who is doing this probably every six months gains another million because he's not really in the promotion business he's in the book business and that's what he's selling to people and they get caught up in the idea because you see there's something that grasps some people the idea of getting rich with no effort anti-scripture right going to sweat amen you're gonna live by the sweat of your brow you're gonna do this god never god never created the ponzi scheme god never put together all the get rich quick things god says you know what it's fine you guys just go and sweat and save and become stewards and and do all of this thing and and you will be all right you will find some comfort you will find this comfortable life so you look at this ma and there's kind of a reason right saints because you read the scripture amen but they that will be rich fall into temptation and to snare scripture tells us there'll be very few rich people make her to heaven but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lust which drown men in destruction and perdition so this isn't really much of a promotion for getting rich is it especially as a christian we're going to get rich we're going to fall go into perdition no sorry that's not what god called us to do amen for the love of money now it doesn't say that money is the root of all evil but the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith so these weren't heathens that he's talking or referencing they have aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows so it was inflicted by themselves or they brought themselves to that place to be inflicted with many sorrows now my brother and sister the word of god does not say that a rich man will not make it to heaven it just says it will be very difficult and very few will do it so if god blesses you you know if you're the guy who invents the widget and 10 million people buy a widget and you now have money just make sure that you put god first now you might say what's a widget brother paul it's whatever you want it to be amen but you know make sure we put god first you get a pay raise that changes your whole world you get something goes good you inherit money whatever it might be don't look at those things as hey this is a game changer for me just continue to serve god and hold on to the very principles that god laid in your life and the beginning and you will be blessed amen but now o man of god flee the word of god kind of putting a little roadblock to our process of pursuing wealth of getting rich of looking for an easy life hey don't look at me that way this is the scripture amen flee these things and follow after righteousness and godliness and faith and love and patience and meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou are also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses isn't that really our first and foremost that we are that we profess we are sons and daughters of god called before the foundation of the world let that be no matter what blessings come in your life in the natural let that be a spiritual blessing that we come that we fight that good fight of faith in other words always pressing in always seeking as it were the advantage of of the growing in our faith you know the apostle paul said i'm happy to see you growing in faith so we want to pursue that and lay hold on that and eternal life my brother and sister you know i was just reading some stuff and they're doing some research amongst christians and the numbers are falling amongst the people professing to be christians that actually believe there really is a heaven and really is a hell and so in that realm what it is is people are viewing as an encouragement these things are speaking as encouragements to living a good life and so my brother and sister as it is the devil is watering down all of the gospel to a place that people are not really seeing that their behavior has a dire consequence but i believe as sons and daughters of god we should look at this and say you know what i believe that we have a great reward eternal life and there is as it were dire consequence for not living the word of god and so we see how satan continues to water this down and uh the wealthier people are the less inclined they are to believe that they have to be obedient to the bible i think that might be why saints you know maybe by god's grace we could take some of you to places like south america where they don't have a lot of prosperity most of us would say wow believers really live like this this is really the circumstances they live in but you will see great faith i remember one time in paraguay a sister crying because she's embarrassed that sister jerry would come and surely sister jerry lived in a nice home and she would come into her home because her house was this just a little concrete deal with just wires run on the wall and nothing furniture very basic and the sister was a little embarrassed but you see my brother and sister by god's grace we don't view that that way we don't look at it and say oh these would be the ones we fellowship with because they have nice things and and these here don't have anything nice that so we we ignore them because as sons and daughters of god real believers of this message we are not looking at the possession we're not looking at the color or a texture or what of the cloth we're not looking at the fashion we're looking at the heart and the soul and the character of that individual and therefore we can worship with and we can and call friendship with and embrace those regardless of the place in life that they are because you see this message brings liberty and liberty isn't just something that is to the rich it is also to the poor because my brother and sister you can look in the world we live in today the prophet of god prophesied it and the things that are happening in the world today are proving it that we are becoming an increasingly neurotic people and there's a direct correlation people taking pills to get up the prophet of god spoke these things and pills to go to sleep a pill for this they have problems oh what is happening here this woman flirted with my husband at this party and this and that and our world and this is not perfect and i don't like that you see my brother and sister they live in another world that has a false reality but you take a son or daughter of god that does not have two nickels to rub together that is filled with the holy ghost and the word of god and the prophet bull declare him a rich man oh hallelujah and that is what we need to look for amen fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life my brother and sister there's nothing i hate worse than shaking hands with a man that's got a limp wrist it just bothers me to no wind i i don't want to be rude but i i just like somebody just shake your hand they don't have to crush your hand and i don't want to crush theirs i'm the guy with the little hands i'm the one that usually gets my fingers pretzeled but my brother and sister you know there's just something but you know if you can't lay hold on eternal life not not some just patty cake i i i believe god sent a prophet i believe this and this is okay patty cake patty cake i want somebody that's going to stand up i want to see sons and daughters of god believers of the message of the hour stand up and say i am laying hold on eternal life you devil will not pry it out of my hands the cares of life won't pry it out of my hands no amount of money pride out of my hands no nothing's going to pride out of my hand i have laid hold on eternal life hallelujah and has professed a good profession before many witnesses now i don't want to get distracted but in my bible by my chair there i just been reading some very interesting scripture and in that you know some of those scriptures are talking about how we've been delivered from a bondage that satan would take us at his will aren't you glad that god can work in your life that the devil can't just decide to walk into your house tonight and say i'm going to disrupt disrupt their world i'm going to tear it apart i'm going to do this no he's been bound and he can no longer come at his will to take my saints come on somebody ought to be shouting hallelujah because you know that's just no different than the devil just coming in and you going and pulling your key ring out and say hey don't bother picking the lock don't bother kicking the door down i'll just give you the key we've not only took the key from him we have put the seal on the door of the holy ghost and he can't kick the door down he can't pick the lock he cannot do anything to get into this house hallelujah somebody ought to be saying thank you lord for that because i'm telling you my brother and sister what a game changer that is in our lives when satan then finds himself that he might still torment right job wasn't exempt but he will do this in such a fashion that in the end god will be glorified and that's what we're living for is to glorify the lord amen so you look at this and and we understand now my brother and sister this is something right here that i hope you follow me tonight are we doing okay amen i hope you follow me tonight because as these thoughts are unfolding to me i i just it struck me and and i thought you know praise the lord uh there's just something about us we're we're now let me just put it this way so we have clarity i've moved from whether you have riches or you're poor and and uh don't let riches deceive you i move from that from something worth fighting for amen now look at this quote here in the mighty conqueror brother branham says they said arnold von winkering what will you do now i want you to read this quote in a different context than just reading a quote can you put your name in there let me just put it this way they said paul daniel haylett what will you do and he turned towards the oncoming army he looked it all over he found where the darkest in the midst of the spears was right he wasn't out here saying now guys i'm going to go over here where there's a lone man over here and i'll fight with him while you guys go down here this man knew that was a difference had to be made maybe it was a difference in his family a difference in his church a difference in his nation he had a stick in his hand and he threw it down he said follow me and fight with all you've got could we personalize this tonight amen fight with all you've got with what you have to fight with and he threw away his stick through his hands in the air and screamed make way for liberty make way for liberty and as he rushed towards that great bunch of spears a hundred shining spears reaching out to pick him up and as he plunged into them he grabbed his arms out a whole arm full of them and threw them into his chest and screamed make way for liberty and such a display of heroism it rallied the army and those men those men behind followed with their sticks and clubs and they beat that army out of their land and they've never had a war since what was it because one man had the zeal and heroism about him to be a conqueror do we have anyone who wants to be a conqueror tonight amen our lord jesus you know brother branham goes on and talks about how our lord jesus come and he took everything my brother and sister not just something to make us feel good but he took everything into himself and found it in death and left it deaf hell in the grave left it uh powerless before you and i today and so there we are standing upon the word of god we have something worth fighting for would you agree with me tonight we don't have just some little washed out thing and we've just become message believers going to a message church quoting message quotes we have something worth fighting for and i'm going to lift a hand tonight and say lord give me the courage to be able to go and to declare and to shout to them make way for liberty grace tabernacle it's time for us to press in and face the enemy and make way for liberty in our household he is there brother branham in other quotes says you know he was their lovely little wife and them lovely little children and knowing that if they lost the war that that army would ravish their wives and take their children to be slaves and use them and he said he could not stand that he knew he had to make a difference brother paul just out on the limb tonight come on saints it's time for us to stand up and say you know what devil we're making room for liberty and grace tabernacle we're gonna not let this be uh and uh we're not looking as it were our wives being ravished but it would be the spirits of the age my brother and sister and to see that some people who profess to believe the same thing as you are no longer in the flesh their clothing their habits identifiable with the same standard you profess i'm not criticizing them but i'm telling you someone's going to stand up and make way for liberty someone's going to take and say you know what i can face the devil i can pray for that individual i can pray for this situation i can claim the victory i can profess this i can make the claim and have courage enough to stand up and say i am more than a conqueror amen this is not just a bunch of phony stuff my brother and sister we have this are are we real tonight i want you to pinch yourself everybody reach out pinch yourself are we real tonight i say we are real we have real problems in marriages and families and this and that and finances and whatever but none of that has anything to do whether the promise of god is true or not and it has nothing to do with whether you can have the courage to stand up and say i am more than a conqueror and i will pursue the enemy and i will make a way for a liberty in my life the lives of my family the lives of those in the church or he had a choice he could have just figured out what it would like be like to live in bondage we have that decision don't we i wouldn't make it for you you can decide bondage or liberty what do we want tonight saints hallelujah even was it patrick henry give me liberty or give me death lord either make us a victorious army or take us home i don't want to be around here a church that's whipped a church that's always like oh i'm not saying we are saints but i don't want us to be a church it's like oh whoa quote quote but nothing ever happening nothing ever powerful enough to shift the dynamics of the lives of the people in this church i say tonight that we make a vow to ourself i promote this to you tonight make a vow to yourself that you're going to be one that stands up and says make way for liberty make way for the holy ghost to move in the midst of our church make way for the power of god to answer prayers make way that our young people won't be just living on mom and dad's testimony but they will know god is real i say this so much so that i believe god take our young people to camp and make way for liberty that when they come home we'll look at them and say something happened to you not just all our team won the volleyball that can't be something more than our team did this and our team did that let it be a time that our young people would come home and say i got the holy ghost i know i got the holy ghost god move powerfully in our midst and then let them have a voice that comes and declares make way for liberty if another young person did not receive that we don't just sit back and say okay whatever we're going to take that and we are going to fight for that hallelujah amen colossians the first chapter and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now happy reconcile you know what that means there's a defeated enemy behind this an enemy that wanted to make you captive to bind you to keep you in as it were his service but it means he's conquered because you've been reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard which was preached to every creature which is under heaven wherefore i paul have made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and philip that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church so paul is declaring i'm going through this great battle and i have sacrificed and given myself to this to be a benefit to the body believers i've done this not to be recognized as a great man but to lift up the body which is the church that's what he's doing he's telling us do your part arnold what are you going to do paul what are you going to do place your name in there what are you going to do we can choose to be another church in another city or we can choose to be the victorious church of jesus christ proclaiming victory to those who believe defeat is all they'll ever experience even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generation but now is made manifest to his saints you know there's nothing more real about this scripture my brother and sister than to realize according to what the prophet of god preached in the seals and the breach and and we catch this down through the church age book that look at this this that has been hid from ages and from generations a prophet of god talking about messengers of every age how there was just a certain portion that was lotted to them and being revealed and it come and that was all they could express luther could not preach this message wesley could not preach this message wigglesworth and smith and all their mothers could not preach this message but it comes down that a prophet of god in his own words comes and says i didn't come with a new revelation i didn't come with new things i come to take all the loose ends and i come to bring them together and tie it all together for you what the mystery now being revealed had to have a loose end and loose in a loose end pulled together and expressed now in one great mystery but my brother and sister the mystery that remains is still a mystery but the word of god said that the mystery has been revealed amen hallelujah and this is not doctrine this is scripture amen amen to fulfill the word of god is what he says in verse 25 that's what it was all given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hid from ages from generation now made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches you know i'm a wealthy man amen i am so incredibly wealthy beyond even what this world can measure now if you want to think about this i know this might be a far-fetched but i just want to stir your minds the prophet of god talked about all those people elvis presley oh my all those other names you guys would remember the quotes and he said he s they sold their gift now look my brother and sister the world placed a value on the gift that god had given them the world didn't give him the gift do you know that the millions that elvis presley made was already would have been allotted to him if he had given it to christ he had the wealth but you see he couldn't stand to have his treasure laid up as the scripture says in heaven he wanted it laid up here so because he didn't keep his heart right didn't keep his heart washed and cleaned and committed soon the values of this natural life started to increase in his mind and he became willing to trade the gift of god for the revenue of the world and in the end my brother and sister we understand the story of elvis presley no doubt most of us have seen enough about that story to understand he died a man most miserable he died literally with no one he could say loved him and as far as many would know due to the circumstances of his last hours he might not even been able to say that god loved him my what it would be to trade all the things of this world all of this to measure the riches to be able to say god loves me i love him and he loves me and there's no other place that i would long to be but in his arms you see there's a great richness in the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ and you the hope of glory there is so much more than silver or gold right there saints to know we stand upon the word of god and god is not only with us he is in us amen it is now i want you to think about that it is now revealed to us every day of our lives that goes by there's something more we see of this mystery unveiled to us but yet you know what we can put this in past tense can we not and say it has been revealed to us we are not coming to something that is just new and never seen before but god's been maturing as the apostle paul said i i'm thrilled this is a like a different version of it but i like it it says i am thrilled to see you growing quickly in faith not languishing not wondering is god real will god answer my prayers but growing quickly grasping hold and if you want a basis in scripture for that just go look at the parable of the 11th hour worker my brother and sister it didn't take him 40 years to have a faith that would rapture him god grew that faith in him quickly oh god help us god help us just to press forward amen hallelujah has been revealed to us the riches of the glory of this mystery sister emmy would you come i'll tell you saints i i'll speak for myself tonight i say it makes a believer want to shout make way for liberty make way for liberty make way god's fixing to move i'm fixing to stand i'm going to fight i'm not going to run i'm not going to expect someone else to carry the weight i'm going to be an example i'm going to stand up and i'm going to be an example that i can be one that can carry now look i say this only as a measurement how big was your flame when you come to church tonight don't say that to condemn anyone don't misunderstand but i just want you to encourage we can bring not a magnifying glass to find our lick of fire but we can come with a lick of fire that the world has no doubt that man's on fire that woman's on fire hallelujah i pray to god tonight something encourage your heart amen just to realize right here in the scripture all these little things little nuggets just laid out amen and here we're here to be good ministers of the gospel to stir up your pure minds amen hallelujah hallelujah i know some of you are probably shocked but brother chris's spirit washed over on me and uh and uh that's you know that's the one thing about it it's nice you know i got a nephew that i can blame things on and he just smiles and takes it keeps pressing on amen he steals my sermons and then puts a spirit on me not to preach so long some little comment he made i thought i'm sure he meant that for me something about it don't take a lot of time just need to be focused oh my hallelujah i love you chris amen
