time in my life um I was writing my bicycle and this tune came to me of the chorus and I looked it up and um it was just like my dad was telling me from Heaven that it's going to be okay so the Lord did work out what I was going through and blessed me through it so it's been a very long time since Tim and I did a medley with the chorus of this song and uh forgive my mess ups and uh just pray the

this place our art will come me in this place the prophet taught us that the Holy Spirit the Lord will just come wherever he is welcome and uh so as we just enter into the service today we just uh we just want to enter in just say Lord you're welcome here here's my heart it's open and I I just give it to you amen amen is this okay there's a note here uh they want the congregation understand that camp is only open to the church here right now so it will be uh March 10th before it's open so as you share with your friends and encourage them uh don't don't be telling them they can sign up right now okay so he so we want really you know it says we want to give everyone within the congregation the opportunity but we sure like everyone of everyone of this assembly to to um uh be in Camp so I say God bless you and give you opportunity first pick just want to remember brother Adrian and sister aah um they're hoping to come in the next few weeks to come visit us again and um so just lift them up in prayers as they're up there in CIS spell kind of by themselves and you know sometimes you know we just uh our dear sweet little epha we just want to remember her she just came see going in this cycle of feeling better and then uh you know having pretty high fevers um and so just please a special prayer and uh I say this with a bit of humor um we don't often announce birthdays but uh sister Carrie has undesignated number uh that uh has come up almost like a lottery or something it just popped up and anyway you know it's just good it's just good you know we're going to grow old anyway we might as well grow old serving the lord amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord I want to speak to you today uh it's kind of on the topic once again stepping out you know I think that we really need to step out my brother and sister Satan if he would uh would uh box Us in now I know this doesn't sound real spiritual but I hope you'll catch the significance behind it I was just uh looking into the life of a gentleman uh and it's not really about the money made but just the point uh that he he tried to start several businesses through his life and uh I think bankrupt four different times things just failed and uh he was 71 years old and um he had a whole different approach to business he decided at that age that he was going to do this work not to make himself rich but he was going to do this work because it was something he had a passion for and at 71 years old he founded a company that went on to gross him hundreds of millions of dollars and uh the reason I bring that up is um it's never too late to get on fire to serve God never too late for us to say I'm all in and I'm not going to do it because I get to go to heaven I'm going to do it because I get to serve the Lord amen and that really should be the whole Foundation or fundamental for us is Lord I just want to serve you you know the marriage vow says in sickness and in health for richer for poor I wished we could apply that as much to our spiritual as we could to the Natural and uh God help us today I want to talk to you about God's work God's business amen let's turn to our Bibles in Psalms the 1 chapter: 1-6 and I tell you this morning I I just will be unabashed to tell you that I want to be blessed amen I I look uh uh in the natural we look at this and the scripture says that if we would just follow these things that the lord has laid that he would bless uh the work of our hands he would bless our families all this and uh I I just not ashamed to tell you I want to be blessed but I put the measure of spiritual blessing far above all else amen because if we are rich and know not the Lord then we have accomplished nothing amen blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff With the Wind driveth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of right of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity to come together Lord Saints of like Precious Faith father we just lift up each and every brother sister young and old father for this little natural sickness that is upon the land just keeps coming around but father you're our healer and we believe in that and father we speak forth the words of Life Lord let healing virtue flow through this body of Believers let our health be restored to each one young and old father that we can stand be in the house of God in strength strength father and Lord truly I lay upon my heart today because we have had the sniffles and these things Lord we haven't been to see our brother Bob sister Joanne but father our heart is there with them Lord we just ask you father just to touch them Lord and father it is a season your word says that we've been called to and we know father Lord that that in that time designated by you Lord that you would call us home and Lord it is a heart's desire each and every one of us I believe to be those that are alive and remain at the coming of Our Lord but father we just commit these things to your hand that your will be done father we thank you for the grace and mercy and the testimony of those around us our sister rler father for all the struggles of Life Lord Jesus she has stood all these years father and she has been faithful father and we just ask you Lord Jesus what your heart's desire is for her Lord this coming of a natural Crossing father Lord it is not to be feared but it is to be rejoiced father that we get to come into your presence and the thing that we have labored and longed for all these years father coming to fruition but still in our flesh Lord we we have sorrow father for these Lord as our families pass over our parents pass over lord there's a sorrow within us in the natural but Lord there is a joy that is down in our soul to know they have run the race and they have been faithful and all we can do is say thank you Lord thank you very much Lord father for you have placed a great host of witnesses before us Lord and we thank you for that bless this day I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know as we would look through this this we we recognize that we would not be able to even stand a single day in the age that we live in without the Lord at our sign Satan has come as a roaring lion he has come great influence we look in the world today my brother and sister and everything that has been prophesied is coming to pass and I for one don't personally keep a scorecard as it were of what has and hasn't but we see the word of God is coming to pass being fulfilled in the day that we live in and I think that we sometimes fail to recognize just exactly how blessed we have been to be called in this day and it is not something that we were just on the end of the list but my brother and sister it is actually according to scripture quite the opposite that we are coming down to Herald the Fulfillment of the word the full manifestation of the word for the age and not only this age but all the other ages before it that scripture say says that they without us could not be made perfect and I desire to be perfect in the eyes of the Lord and I know that there are saints that are uh passed on before father before the father and they are rooting for us as it were that they want to see us rise up in Victory now my brother and sister as I brought this out I think it's wonderful that we are here today to be able to prosper naturally it is the scripture says good for a man to be able to be a partaker of the fruit of his labor and so it is not that we would look at that as a significant Mark but it is just a blessing that God allows upon our lives and we look in the word and see as the Apostle Paul spoke so clearly that it is not here and now that we live for but it is to be in the presence of God but if we're going to be here our hearts are yearning for there and it is that we are in this condition and this place right now to fulfill the word of God so we know that our passing from this life cannot take place until our work is finished and it is uh sometimes a a little bit uh hard for us as humans I think it is a natural tendency that we take the word of God sometimes and and feel like we we need to bring this to pass we need to do these things and and we can make something happen but my brother sister I believe that we need to catch the fact this is God's work he's the one that laid the foundation for it he's the one that knows the purpose for it it is not of our own doing nor can we fulfill the word of God in and of ourself but it is the word of God coming to pass nonetheless and I would just like to point out in verse five real quick here it says therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment now my brother and sister the ungodly do stand in the Judgment but you have to go into the root of what this is that it is there my brother and sister the ungodly will not come into the judgment and walk out unscathed they will not walk out in their condition that they entered into the Judgment but Sons and Daughters of God have come as the prophet of God teaches us and I thank you for that Lord because there is so much in denomination today that is laying a root on just pure Grace live any way you want God will pour His grace on you but this word of God this work that he has called you and I to he has given us strength to fulfill the word amen not to have a bypass not to have an excuse not to have a way around but my brother and sister it is that God said no I'm going to take you through the fire and I'm not even going to let the smell of smoke rest upon you now when we come into the Judgment my brother and sister I believe every one of us would have you might say an apprehension that would be there Lord am I fulfilling the word am I doing what I should be doing help me Lord I want to but my brother and sister when you take the principle of scripture and that laid out my brother and sister you will come through the fighter of judgment without even the smell of smoke upon you and so God is preparing you and I to be able to SP stand in this day and the ungodly they're not going to still be standing after the Judgment my brother and sister their Position will not remain steady their Position will not be carried on but they will be judged by the word of God and it is there I say thank you Lord that you would judge us now that we could now walk with confidence into the Judgment now Isaiah 55 it tells us here for my thoughts are not your thoughts amen look at that my brother and sister there's no way that you and I can truly comprehend the mind of God we have an understanding of that we have a a revelation that's been given us but when we are in the presence of God I I I'll brand this as opinion so that if you look at it slightly different maybe you're looking at the ears and I'm looking at the tail I don't know but you look at that my brother and sister we are trying to quantify God by our thinking we're trying to to put ourselves into this body of Believers often times by our thinking and it is there that we have the idea that God's going to judge here and judge there and this is how it's going to be well I tell you our thoughts are not God's thoughts amen and our ways are not his ways amen for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts isn't this amazing sometimes we try to step out and by revelation we can to a degree and explain what we think God must be meaning but my brother and sister I would much rather by God's grace just step into the word and let the word be what the word was intended to be just let it come to pass and by Revelation let the Lord open our eyes to what he sees and how he wants it done and how he's moving people my brother and sister you can look I didn't bring all these quotes and and things to talk about this but you look and there were those there was a time in the Tabernacle where there was strife and there was struggle and there were those that had went off and started churches and there were those that had some different little points of view and they were starting to call people buzzards and starting to call them blackbirds and starting to be very uh critical of that and the prophet of God says don't you do that those are our brothers amen now you could be sitting there and be saying but but they are maybe over like here and over there but you see God sees the end from the beginning all we see is what is before us we see some that seem to be drifting away but we see some that are being pulled in and my brother and sister it's all in God's time amen it might be that we have passed from this life and God will still be doing the work God will still be moving God will still be bringing things to pass and we have to stop and say now is this according to my thinking my ideas or what I'm sure is this is what the prophet meant or do we stop and say Lord let me Focus back to myself let me be a living epistle let me be an example that they could look to and say you know what there is a better way to live there is a better life to live there is a position for me and so it is that we see how this is where our thoughts for as high for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways amen and anybody know how far it is from here to there a professor once asked a graduate students as they're talking about time and space and the speed of light the speed of sound and he just throws that out right in the middle of a a uh a speech if you call it whatever they call it a a you know he's there and he says you know how how far is it from here to there and some students lifted their hands thinking they had an answer but my brother and sister God's ways are so much higher than our ways higher amen as it is as the scripture says amen is the heavens well where do the heavens start science actually has a point that they declare that the heavens start but is that God point is that where God said the heavens start that's where science says when the atmosphere is too thin to live in they say that's where the Heavens start but my brother and sister the heavens are wherever God said they are not what science said it was and so it's just showing very symbolically that we have no way to even measure how much higher the heavens are than this is that than our ways are and so as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither I need to slow down I'm just racing along here G ging but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sewer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it now I want you to catch that it's going to accomplish what he pleased and and it will prosper the very pinpoint thing this gospel may seem like a shotgun approach but it's actually pinpoint accuracy when you're there dealing with people and God anoints it that the words be spoken to be the very words that are they circulating in their own mind might be easier to say well you know that that was there it's a prophet he can discern that but what is it when God uses just plain old everyday people and can speak so clearly through plain old Everyday People God putting it right to a purpose amen and then he prospers that purpose so as we look at this I just want to go on here today just now in the sermon this is sermon I've been studying uh brother brandham in the message then Jesus came and called he talks a lot about uh uh very various things but a lot about Lazarus Martha and Mary but look right here Luther had the evidence of his age Wesley of his age Pentecost of its age but we're in another age now my brother and sister we can call this the eighth day we can call it the bride's age but I'm telling you this is the age of the culmination of the word of God of the ages it is the finished time this is when the wheat is in the maturity stage in the presence of the sun we can look and see how these things are coming to pass and God is is bringing this so clearly now my brother and sister you go out here to today and you will find many I I've been studying on this and you'll find many uh churches use almost the same vocabulary that that we have around the message I I'm I guess a little bit prejudiced I believe that there's more of these denominations studying the message than they're ever willing to uh admit to amen you'll find uh that there is a lot of reference uh that there what didn't used to be but a lot of reference about the seals a lot of reference about the church ages but the prophet of God said they'll be coming uh uh to a time and a place that there is a a uh a seeking of the oil they're they're Desiring more and and they're digging in deeper and and you know the word of God is now been made a global we think about it as a international economy a worldwide economy well my brother and sister the gospel has uh been made a very much Universal worldwide gospel and it must be that way because it's every nation Kindred and tongue but it's also put out there that they can seek after the oil it has to be there to attract them that they would be coming forth and seeking that and it's a fulfilling of the word and you know sometimes if we're not careful we get sympathetic in that and we say well I don't know you know it seems that uh uh that we're we're cutting them out no don't cut them out amen you give all that you can give encouragement uh support uh witness everything that you can give don't be stingy with it you share it openly just pour yourself out to them amen cuz you never know amen you never know where I was just talking to a brother and he was telling me about how that a billboard was placed a little sign placed at a an intersection and and there was a lady that uh worked in that uh convenience store on that corner and um you know she was looking out the window of this convenience store and where the sign was placed she could read the sign and said there that every day she's looking at that sign and finally one day she says I'm just going to go see what that website is and she goes in there and she reads that and and she's like that's interesting and and she goes back to the website again and she goes back to the website again and finally one day she says you know I'm going to ask for Sunday off and I'm going to go over and I'm going to visit that church and just see and she's there at that church and it is so Counter Culture to to her life and what she's living and and she's there and something strikes her heart and after a few visits she says I'd like to be baptized and in that she goes and gets baptized and here's her husband kind of a hard shell of a man but it is there in a short while he says man something has changed my wife and I like it and he says I think I need to come and join in what she's doing and and it's there my brother and sister you might say the billboard has no voice going to that church walking through the door of the church didn't do it for that lady but there's life inside that church there's a holy ghost that's living inside that body of Believers and coming into the presence of that it had an impact upon them I say God let us be that kind of church let it be that the impact would be there we can't save the world we'll touch on that in just a little bit but I tell you my brother and sister those that God has called us to touch let us touch them positively let us touch them in such a way amen now as we look at this uh uh Luther had evidence of his age Wesley of his age Pentecost of its age but we're in another age those things are are good but like the baby has got a finger and eye and nose but after a while he has to become a human being he has to become a matur child then be born isn't it amazing how this is referenced here it's talking about a baby being carried in the womb of a mother has to become a matured child before it can even be born and then another maturity comes into its life and we would often put that maturity to a timeline you know in the late teens mid to late teens are starting to come into a maturity we call adulthood but my brother and sister as they would come and give their heart to the Lord there's another maturity that must come to pass you see it's not just one event in our life type that back to the spiritual but God bringing a maturity amen and that mature child then be born have a soul a body Spirit can move around now we find out all of this Jesus has declared a and just a few just those who he had ordained to life sought him think about it I was just watching a little news deal on the current status of a part of Israel there and here is the language of these soldiers and because it's a public broadcast they have bleeped them out and here's these Israeli soldiers Jews by birth but as they interviewing them it's ble and it comes to mind to me not judging those men they can be saved but the scripture says not all of Israel is Israel and amen and so here is Jesus dealing with these people and in Israel in that day it says right there just those just a few just those who he ordained to life saw him not great crowds his crowds could never be like Caiaphas crowds now look at this my brother and sister here is the Messiah walking on the Earth but he's setting a pattern for us to witness today that it never this message will never draw the crowd that this world out here can draw it will never be a mega church with with 20 30 40,000 people uh you know coming into a service two or three or four a day coming into these Services it will never be drawn to that but it's drawn to the ones that Jesus called amen that's small number and and you know if we're not careful we think oh there's not very many of us here this morning everyone that God Called to be here this morning is here that doesn't mean it's not Sons and Daughters of God sometimes circumstance and work and health and those kind of things but I trust that you follow what I'm saying God knew exactly who would be sitting on the Pew this morning knew exactly every detail of it but see Caiaphas could have called the whole nation together Jesus called just a few together not many knew him thousands times thousands when he come on the Earth he went through the Earth and they never even knowed he was here so will it be again he'll come to those who are called to life he knows who is called to life and he he'll not it's his business to take care of that you see we're worried about well I got to say the right thing to this person brother Trevor sister Carrie they have a lot of public interaction amen some of the others brother him a lot of public interaction some of us not so much and we're worried will I say the right thing what do I say to these that's not your work that's his work that's his uh uh uh prerogative to anoint you but we have to be a vessel that is ready and willing and cleansed to be used we can't be over on The Wash Rack in the dirty dishes my brother and sister he wants us washed top to bottom in and out to be ready for his service but it's up to him amen are you with me how we've labored sometimes and agonized what do I say to these people but God called us I don't need you to know what to say to them I need you ready to be used as a conduit I'll pour into you what I need to pour into them but we labor so hard and we stumble over it and often times put ourself in the way because we're trying to do the work and it's God's work amen it's God's business now we live in such an interesting world you want to speak see what the spirit is on the land today is just go and I actually I tell you don't because it's not worth it but in doing research you you go and my brother and sister you see this nonsensical representation of God's work in this day you've now got Mega ministers that are like going well you know I we don't believe in divorce until they decide they want a younger wife then suddenly they found an Avenue in the scripture that justifies it and they just trade their wife in but their wife goes on in this particular case and she just founds her own Ministry she liked the millions and she founded her own Ministry and then she goes and ends up becoming a tabloid uh you know deal that she's had an affair with another preacher and nobody leaves their Church their Church doesn't split there isn't people rise up and say this is against the word they just say oh yeah they're human it's like a soap opera living out on the platform do you see the condition the world's come in says they would make the word of God to none effect and there's the evidence I don't need to judge them you don't need to judge them their own life testifies you see and then because there's nothing there any deeper in the congregation and I hope you catch why I'm speaking this my brother and sister it's there this is a representation this is actually it's not about the preacher and his marriage condition and his his um um you know social and all of these things my brother and sister it has actually nothing to do with any of that it is Satan's deception literally there will be millions of people that says my pastor did it it will be all right for me now my brother and sister as pastors as ministers we make mistakes please don't follow our mistakes follow the word amen you know if we have a if a man has a struggle in his life and and he has you know I I knew a brother one time that used to exaggerate pretty hard and I I made a comment now I hope you guys don't look bad at this here I made a comment one day I said man so and so exaggerates and my wife she was just being honest this as many years ago she goes you know what you exaggerate almost that bad and I was like what are you talking about but I stopped and started to examine my life and realized I had a I don't know what do you you call of us Spirit of exaggeration Spirit of the oversiz something I don't know but you know my brother and sister you realize but you see God has a time and a place because we are Sons and Daughters of God that he won't let us carry on in that spirit and keep moving on and on and on in that Spirit he'll come a time and say you're my son and you need to be living according to the word and I'm going to bring this out and put it right in front of your face and give you the opportunity and the unction to correct it and maybe we still sometimes you know have a little something we just kind of embellished it just a little bit it's not intentional it's not to me me a lie but it's there that something's in our nature but when that happens God's got a checkpoint right there Amen brother Sergey and I was talking I hope you don't mind me referencing this brother Sergey but about that halling that little that little deal you know that they found brother brandom's office and and it's there and when you read that my brother and sister you start to realize what's happened in your life God's not going to allow you he might allow them he might allow them but he is not going to allow you because he's put a higher calling on your life and so it's there that we go through life with these struggles and we say but Lord and it's there that we wonder why me or what's happening but it's God fine-tuning us and we don't judge them over that my brother and sister because you can't be what you aren't or as it is down in the South if you ain't you ain't just straightforward so all that this happening is not going to hinder God's work see they can call the whole world together my brother and sister exactly what's happening in the world Council of churches they're drawing together amen when you read little things that just catch your attention you know things such as uh you know uh different denominations the Catholic Church giving them property to build their spiritual Embassy in Rome now you can't tell me my brother and sister that they're ever going to come to you and I and say we're going to give you the money and the building to have a representation so you can preach about us being the Harlot no it's not going to happen my brother and sister but when it becomes compromised that the word has been brought to un effect it's all right come on over join us you're no threat to us amen the Holy Ghost is no threat to them my brother and sister because they've rejected the Holy Ghost they've rejected the spirit of God and they're so in their own thinking that we have it we have it but that spirit is not for the Catholics alone right right I won't beat that I'll leave it alone amen now they can draw the whole world together and of course we know they are it's prophesied but the Lord knows who he's called aren't you glad aren't you glad something stirring in your heart I know I was called this is who I am I'm not here by accident I'm not already planning my exit well in a way we're planning an exit out of here amen but not out of the word amen and so it's there and uh you know there's no fear in this because the simple scripture sometimes is so deep so powerful so magnetic uh when the word says my sheep know my voice you realize we could preach for years on that topic alone my sheep what identified sheep not any old sheep he didn't gate cut them if you understand that term in livestock world this is not dat cut Sheep amen we just need 50 we need a 100 we need 500 oh close the gate no it is that one that one that one that one God's choosing yeah but see in man's mind this is why God's ways are so much higher than our ways in man's mind he's going to choose the uh you know the very intelligent and the Very goodlook and the Very physical appearance and this that and the other but you know when God chooses he might choose a little bum lamb he might choose you know one that looks a little ragged doesn't look so healthy amen you know one that looks like it needs a little doctoring God would choose them and he says that's the one I want and everybody would scratch their head why them it doesn't matter what man thinks right God's ways are so much higher than our ways it's God's choice amen hallelujah reminds me one time when I was a young man working on a ranch this guy's buying these cattle and and this one steer there just kept charging at us just trying to run over us and finally the guy says I'm tired of this I ain't buying that one cut it out and so as they send it down the alley I I was the one and and uh uh you know chickened out I guess you would say cuz this this thing's running down the alley with his head down run as fast as he can and I wasn't going to over there and try and pin that gate cuz I knew that thing was going to beat me to the gate latch and so I just threw the gate out there and when it saw the gate swinging towards it it ran over here and jumped and jumped about seven or8 feet in the air and ran right into overhead AP poost broke its neck fell down in the alley dead it's like you deserve that but how many times we've shied how many times we've jumped out of the path that God has set us in how many times as it was with the old draft horses we've got tangled up in the traces how many times and God says no I called you to life and life it will be see we've heard it preached around the message and it is true in a certain category my brother and sister that you know be careful you don't send away your day of Grace but do you realize as the Bride of Christ God will not let you go to that position he might take your life premature he might make your life so miserable that you will crawl back but God is not going to just put you out there and say I hope they make it he's already spoke eternal life over your life amen he's already called you and wrote you into the Lamb's Book of Life and there will be arguments people will say but brother brandham said brother brandham said but my brother and sister predestination will hold am amen and is not a willy-nilly thing that might be and might not be ah we've seen men come to the place remember the story of the preacher or the man he was there in the garage and he was just so discouraged he tells the boy go get me a case of beer and the uh the car lift collapses kills the man and people would like and they tested the lift and said there's nothing wrong with this lift that we don't understand but you see before that man could take that position that the devil had anointed him to God took him home amen you might say well but he would have failed he might have failed that was the flesh that failed and God in the soul says no I've already claimed him he's mine and I will not let him go hallelujah oh I know it gets complicated my brother and sister and the devil's given us plenty of alternative ideas but God's ways are higher than ours amen I don't get up in the morning thinking you know I hope I don't go to hell today I get up in the morning saying Lord help me to make it through the day to be pleasing to you let my life today be a life that I can stand before you without condemnation amen the scripture says that these Sheep amen only know his voice and another voice they will not follow but let me put it a little stronger they can't follow they can't follow my brother and sister see the bride she only knows the the voice of the bridegroom look what God's doing in our lives my brother and sister we will be like I'm studied this and I studied that and I I realized this uh this Doctrine wasn't right and God moved me over here or this Behavior wasn't right and God moved me let you understand that it was God telling you not you figuring it out God telling you this isn't where you belong you need to get off of the fence you need to quit eating the thistle through the fence you need to get over here in the good grass come over here and and it's the word of the Lord that is calling it because you can't follow that voice see this bride only knows the voice of the bridegroom her beloved now this could get a little touchy so I'll try to keep it very sanitized she doesn't have a boyfriend she has a husband now I I trust that we can censor this correctly but if you go and look in Webster and see the very close but subtle difference of those two if I can word this correctly keep it very sanitized one has a right to that relationship one wants a relationship with no obligation and there is the difference the voice of one who has claimed me enough to put the ring on my finger and the one who only wants to use me for a relationship was that clear enough I don't want to go any further you see how this is my brother and sister there's a lot of difference in those two having a boyfriend or a husband amen we are not a boyfriend to Jesus Christ he is our bridegroom amen he has claimed us amen he's put the ring on our finger and he has brought us but look my brother and sister how clever Satan is he's brought up so many voices he's raised so many voices in the day that we live in there literally is a voice for everything and so it's there whether it's a voice for the liberal side of the word a voice for the legalist side of the word but my brother and sister you will find and it takes quite a bit of going through the message but you'll find the prophet of God is laying out for us that the Bride is a balanced bride amen she knows my brother and sister it's one thing remember the little story you know of how they say to greet a a husband uh a husband's been off to work he's been working hard and a wife comes and greets him at the door she throws her arms around him and makes him feel so good that he's home here with his family but if once he gets past his wife the house is a pig pin my brother and sister the Euphoria of the kiss at the door is going to fade because it's still a pig pin and my brother and sister if the house is spotless clean but there's no affection to the husband amen he's going to come home to a spotless house spotless children everything perfect but inside he's going to be filled with a great vacuum that is not being filled and he's going to yearn for something to fill that vacuum and many times the prophet of God lays this out we won't go into it but someone the devil will put them someone in the office he'll put someone in the market he'll put someone in the house next door to fill that void and it's in that void then the trouble starts and people say but I was a good wife' but you see this bride of Christ is a balanced bride her house is clean and she's there to tell them I love you Lord I love you Lord I need you Lord you are so good to me I care for you I want to be your wife I'm proud to be your wife I'm happy to be your wife amen but my brother and sister the bridegroom has come back and he reciprocates this and he also lets us know I love you I care for you I provide for you I trade my my life for you amen see how balanced this bride is she's got something to stand on she's not as one brother said plowing this ditch and then going over and plowing that ditch but she's come right back to the center of the road and the word and the leadership of the holy spirit is bringing the word out in our life my brother and sister I'll tell you what I'll just say it out loud I'm proud of you I'm proud of you as a church we're human we have a little little fuss here and oh the little there and a little whatever but what do we do we keep coming back into the word we keep coming back and making things right and setting things in order and getting over our flesh and getting over our emotion and getting over our complexes and pressing forward as Sons and Daughters of God you see this is the kind of bride the word is producing one that's balanced and even if someone does say something very direct you can take the spirit of Christ and say Lord forgive for give them they know not what they do and walk on I'm can I speak just a little bit blunt if Christ acted like all of us do at some point in our life we'd see in scripture something about the reference to those worthless bombs no good but you see he says Lord forgive them they didn't even know what they were doing help us find that kind of balance help us kind the thing that the devil it's not you Saints it's the devil trying to come and drive a wedge into the body of Believers he's trying to cause it so that there's a drama just like I was talking about out there so there's all kinds of well why did this church split well this preacher preaches too hard and this one preaches too this and this one this and this and this and everybody then segregates and says well I just want to hear a preacher that tells me I'm going in a Rapture I'm going to go over here I I want to I like it hard I like my hide Tor I'm going to go to over here with this one that says you'll be lucky to make it in the Rapture and then others will be saying you know I I I just I just want to be able to eat and grow eat and grow the prophet of God actually puts it drink and grow drink and grow drink and grow because you see all the rest of this is nothing but Satan's drw to keep you and I from focusing on the word of God and then pretty soon one teaching brings us over here and we're trying to we're trying to be better people in the sense of I can do it I can do it I can do it well let me tell you I shared a quote here sometime back you might remember it you might not where brother bradam says I used to think that I I'm paraphrasing it I used to think that I could do it and then I just quit I can't do it I'm holding on to Jesus just quit he's holding on to you amen it's not what we can do Saints this is God's work this is God's business amen he's in the saving business Amen in the church ages did I finish that yeah yeah seven Church ages have you noticed in Revelations 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that Hearth say come see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit I I love that my brother and sister because you see we don't need to learn uh two languages as it were we don't need to try and figure out just how to say it just say what the word says amen as the same as the spirit she is a word bride proving she has the spirit in every Church age we hear these words he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the spirit gives the word and if you have the spirit you will hear can can we say Amen to that if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age as those true Christians took the word for their age I tell you that just makes my heart so happy and men we don't got to worry about how this is going to come out and wait there might be some of this I don't quite understand if you have the spirit you will have the word amen and when you're in the word it draws a spirit even closer to you which means that it is an unending Revelation as you come closer to Christ he comes closer to you and I want you to think about the young man and the young woman uh godly people according correctly amen wanting to please the Lord what happens it starts by a young man maybe opening boys listen to this amen might start with a young man opening the door amen and standing there smiling like some silly kid as she walks by but then there Comes A Time you know oh I'm going to go get a drink I see your cup is empty can I fill your cup and after a while this young lady realizes man none of these other boys treat me like he treats me and then she reciprocates that all these other girls won't even look at him but she smiles here and there what is happening they're drawing together slowly slowly amen coming together and as it does it starts to warm up in a positive way amen and pretty soon he's able to somewhere along the line you know Express oh you look beautiful in that dress today or your hair the way you're doing I really your hair is beautiful that way and she doesn't creep her get away from me because something in her says oh yes I like that compliment they're drawing closer and closer and closer until one day they find themselves in an altar and their husband and wife you see what we see in the natural that relationship is fixing to take another step closer that's not a public display isn't that what the prophet of God said this last this last work that God would do in the bride is not going to be a public display it is when they take that relationship and take it to its highest level now my brother and sister does that mean that relationship at that point in time is as high as it will ever get no it's just another stage of maturity that carries on till you can sit one day and people been married 40 50 60 70 years and can say my love is still growing now think about our relationship with the Lord amen as the days go on how much sweeter this relationship is and so it's there you see amen have you noticed Revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come uh and see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word bride proving she has the spirit and in every Church age amen I'm reading it again in case you wonder in every Church age we hear these words he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the spirit gives the word now my brother and sister when the word don't line up some people I I'm getting a little hard on this pray for me I'm kind of getting tired of people doing things just contrary to the word contrary to the message and people are like oh give them a break you know come on my brother and sister if the word is false false then the spirit is false and if the spirit is false sooner or later it will give a word that is not correct come on let's stand up we we don't need to babysit these spirits of unbelief but we don't need to crucify them either but it's time for us to stand up and say that's not on the word I can't accept it uh nice people but it's not on the word I can't accept it instead of offering them an excuse or a for the wolf to bite you again I believe that was a Russian story about the little boy that found the wolf pup took it home and the parents said oh that's that's a wolf pup you can't have it and he convinces them cries oh it's my doggy my doggy and you know it grew up full-fledged wolf and one day they come home and the Wolf is laying there contentedly asleep and there's no little boy you see the spirit my brother and sister as much as you think you've tamed it is not tame it's either subject to the word of God or it's a fullblown Hungry Wolf I hope I hope you don't take that too harsh but it really is time for us as the bride of Christ the message to stand up and say look I'm sorry the little ISM you've always did you know uh it's kind of like when you write a letter professional letter wrote one I think in my life you know and uh you know and then at the bottom when you go to send that you have some other things you're sending with it so you put a little attachment on it you guys know what I'm talking about some of you know how to do that I have son-in-law wife daughters they know how to do that well I don't even need to go there anymore I can just get my granddaughter to do it yeah she was coaching me the other day oh grandpa if you do this and this I guess I could do this for you well it just makes me want want to just learn how to do it myself and then I thought why should I why should I but you see what happens is is when these spirits come when the Holy Spirit speaks the word backs it up but when another voice speaks there's always an attachment and when you open that attachment sometimes it hangs on I'm using a computer for an example but just think your own life amen sometimes you might as well take that computer and just almost practically go throw it in a dumpster because what was in the attachment has now corrupted everything in that computer and that's what the devil's trying to do he's trying to give us the message plus the Bible plus you can find the prophet of God talking about this amen we don't need the message plus we don't need the Bible plus amen we just need the pure p word of God and the message is here to open the book for us we need to just settle for what is there we don't need a new excitable Revelation one time I preached at a church and I made I I'm trying to cure myself of These Foolish statements I just made a statement about you know I never feel like I have enough money and if you have some spare money you could give it to me and had a brother who I knew had money after church come up to me and said were you being serious no please brother I'm sorry I ever even mentioned it that's not the point I was making if I got more Revelation than you can I just give you some if you got more Revelation than me can you just give me some you can't give and take what God gives and takes it comes out of the word it comes direct to your heart because when it becomes a secondhand understanding or Revelation or life there's room in there for the attachment to corrupt us amen we're not here to be corrupted we're here to stand on the pure word because what the spirit says this bride's going to say amen hallelujah I'm probably lost you here I need to hurry up and finish amen so it's a word bride that proves she has it now Revelations 2210 through1 17 very interesting these are the scriptures and I I'm going to forego reading all of that but we come right down here to this Foundation of verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely amen that ought to be a foundational thing to us my my brother and sister because those scriptures above it speak pretty strong amen you know he that's unjust is going to be unjust still right who is filthy is going to be filthy still none of those things pertain to a bride of Christ who by Revelation has heard the pure word of God come from the Throne of God the River of Life flowing out from the throne it's coming right down to your doorstep your doorstep your doorstep your doorstep my brother and sister we don't need to divert it over and to a swamp to store it we don't need to take some sample put it on a shelf to store it we need to drink and when we drink of that if there comes a season of drought in your life you have got the Water of Life to sustain you and you won't be running over here trying to satisfy and running over there trying to satisfy you can hunker down and say this might be a drought in my life I'm not as on fire as I should be right now but Lord I know amen that I know who I am and that your word is true amen because without that my brother and sister we'll find ourselves being pulled boy this is a dynamic Minister this is a dynamic Minister and maybe they are but maybe they're not the minister for you maybe their gospel as it is is not the gospel for you today in this stage of your life you know I'm not trying to cut anybody in or out but now let's hurry along John 11 we see that Martha is there with Jesus and uh she's she's lamenting if Jesus had been there amen and Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him Mary was still in the house you know Mary was too domestic amen that's not a bad trait but still then Martha said to Jesus Lord if thou has has been here my brother had not died so she's pinning it down that that almost like Lord don't understand why you weren't here cuz if you had been here we heard the news that you heard that Lazarus was sick but yet you went to another more distant City but if you had been here he wouldn't have died how many times my brother and sister have we approached God lord if you had just changed this it wouldn't have been like this well if he' had changed it for sure it wouldn't have been like that you wouldn't have learned the lesson you wouldn't had the spiritual growth you wouldn't have caught the revelation and so we're always looking as a brother and Chile we know for the easier path amen let's not go let's find an easier path an easier way my brother and sister I want to go the way that God called me to go if he tells you to go straight down the mountain or straight up the mountain don't complain go amen Martha said to Jesus if you had been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee so look at the look at brother Chris been preaching on these twins here now look at that twin spirit that was there if you had been here he wouldn't have died but wait I know looks like a contradiction to me why wasn't you here let's just turn the words around the way I see them why wasn't you here H but nevertheless anyway um you know I know that no whatever you ask of God God will give it thee and Jesus says to her see this is where the word is coming to pass right in our midst but we don't comprehend it are you with me it's coming to pass right in our midst we don't comprehend it because our thoughts are not as high as his thoughts our ways are not his ways and we're interpreting God's word through our filter yeah Jesus sayith to her thy brother shall rise again now look at this my brother and sister we don't want to Short change the word don't let the devil Short change the word for you we hear this often people having questions about rapturing faith in fact they have questions about faith period much less rapturing Faith but what's happening the devil's short changing the word to them because the prophet already gave us the explanation said that's already in you it's just going to be released we don't necessarily want to go through the fight the battle the struggle to release faith can we be honest with each other today amen God says here you know what I need you to do I need you to run through the fire fear fear Rises up reasoning Rises up emotion Rises up I don't want to run through the fire now does God have to explain to you and I now if you'll just start right here and then you will just look here and you will then just go through the fire I won't let the fire touch you so now when you come out on the other side you're going to be perfect no that's not how God works God said I'm going to take you through the fire come go but he said I'll keep you I'll keep you I'll guard you I'll Shield you I'm your provider but our human element can't see the whole picture Martha's human element can't see the whole picture Jesus said your brother's going to live and she says oh I know that he will rise in the resurrection and Jesus follows right behind that and says I am the resurrection amen that it was there oh all you got to do is just believe because he is in fact going to rise in the resurrection and I'm here amen hallelujah I hope that makes you as excited as it makes me amen you see Resurrection Life my brother and sister is not way out there the prophet of God Is Right Here Right Now Resurrection Life is in this building today it's in his word today it's in his bride today and we need to stop and say Lord I just want the resur ction life I don't know how it's going to come and how it will be displayed but I believe that it's here you know you hear some wonderful stories a prayer line somebody sitting in their chair doesn't even go through a prayer line receives their healing but somehow we get in our mind I need to have this brother that brother these brothers pray for for me Resurrection Life our healer is right here and if you can't receive it sitting in your chair you probably won't receive it going through the line because we're actually the red light or the green light not the preacher you imagine you imagine if a minister just had an absolute gift of healing well would happen around this message wherever he traveled wherever he traveled there would be crowds of people crowding in just so they could touch the hymn of His Garment wrong garment wrong himym that's not the one we're called to touch okay let me close let me close amen so amen I'll just skip over you catch the point on Martha amen see you don't even look at the time of distress you know when Jesus the word spoke Martha the bride spoke the word in return she didn't come up with another message she didn't say but Jesus what about this and you said and wherever it was when this was spoken amen she caught it why in continuity because the word the bride will only speak the word and the word has been spoken amen sister Sarah would you come we'll just skip over a few things here that are maybe a little redundant amen so what's this bride going to do she's going to speak in continuity to the word you see this is God's business and we're just called to speak the word now I want to ask you how hard is it for us to speak the word yeah that might be construed as a trick question when we're anointed by a spirit of leod deia sometimes it can be pretty hard to just speak the word we want to call a preacher or somebody that we have a lot of confidence and we got to do this we got to do that or we could just speak the word you know that's when the prophet of God that's when the prophet of God said you you mothers you Housewives you got a sick baby you don't need to call the preacher you need to go in there and in faith lay your hand on that child claim their healing in the name of Jesus Christ God will honor that Faith amen and when that ever happens and you see that happen it boosts your faith to realize God hears my prayer God wants to fulfill his word through me and in there we gain and come a little bit closer talk about my brother and sister one last little thought to drive home David the ruddiest little spoiled child of the [Music] family until that day the bear come grabbed a lamb David had a choice run all the way back to the house get Dad and all the servants take care of it or we'll just take care of it I'm a Son of God I'm a son of Jesse we know who we are goes over grabs that old bear by the beard grabs him by the Jaws amen slays a bear slays a lion my brother and sister they wondered how he could come down there and look across at Goliath and say what he said they're like well but do you realize nowhere nowhere in that Army was another person who had killed the bear and killed the lion and I hope you don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say here the Philistines and maybe even all of those who say they are Israel amen will not have the experience this bride has in dealing with Satan she is defeating Satan on his own ground we don't have to run back and find someone more powerful someone we have more confidence in our confidence is in Christ our confidence is in the word and when we meet Satan my brother and sister this is not boasting ground this is what God is doing and I guess we can boast on the Lord but God's allowing you to find victory in little things in your life and victory is moving you from little things to bigger things to bigger things to bigger things to bigger things and
