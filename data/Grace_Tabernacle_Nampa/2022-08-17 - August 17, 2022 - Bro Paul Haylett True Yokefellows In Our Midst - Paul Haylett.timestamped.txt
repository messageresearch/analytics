[37:11] I don't know that you could hide I I
[37:14] know we're not the most memorable people
[37:17] on Earth ourselves but
[37:20] I actually met you a couple times met
[37:22] you and Happy Valley many years ago
[37:25] and um
[37:27] met you at and there in Hickory uh when
[37:30] we were had the privilege to visit you
[37:33] and your wife uh sang a special you guys
[37:36] are definitely blessed and then you got
[37:39] some friends there in Hickory that send
[37:41] texts that say brother Keith headed your
[37:45] way
[37:46] and and they even added kind of I think
[37:48] there might have been a smiley face or
[37:50] something he's a good man
[37:52] so so you know brother Keith I think
[37:55] you're just loved amen so
[37:57] you know Saints I have an unspoken
[38:00] request if I name the family uh most of
[38:03] you or if not all of you would know them
[38:05] uh but it needs to remain as an unspoken
[38:09] request that
[38:11] um brother and sister is being taken to
[38:14] the courts by their own family now their
[38:16] family is not Believers and they are
[38:19] taking them to the courts
[38:21] and uh just uh ask that you would lift
[38:25] this unspoken request up before the Lord
[38:28] uh concerning some some issues there and
[38:33] I believe my brother and sister are
[38:35] correct I believe their family has got
[38:37] just a slight Spirit of vindictiveness
[38:39] about it so if you could just lift up
[38:42] this unspoken request I would appreciate
[38:45] that I would like to go to the font
[38:49] we've been on Wednesday nights here for
[38:51] a bit to thank you sister Emmy brother J
[38:54] Sean uh just always good and certainly
[38:58] appreciate our brother Keith those are
[38:59] beautiful songs I appreciate them
[39:02] um you know our present circumstances
[39:04] Saints you know we just look at this and
[39:06] realize from day to day you might say
[39:09] well this is my present circumstance you
[39:11] know some people live
[39:14] with afflictions In the Flesh and the
[39:17] Apostle Paul talked about these these
[39:20] Thorns that were in his flesh
[39:22] so we realize that as we go through life
[39:25] and these present circumstances that we
[39:27] face that God has already provided amen
[39:31] he is our provider it's already been
[39:34] provided oftentimes we get down and we
[39:37] say Lord I need you to do this but the
[39:40] word of God says the answer is already
[39:42] on the way and so we just want to you
[39:45] know just look at our present
[39:47] circumstance and realize that God's got
[39:49] it all in control and uh so we just want
[39:53] tonight to just take out of this
[39:55] scripture as we've been talking on the
[39:58] Yoke uh just love how the scripture
[40:02] brings this out and
[40:04] true yoke fellows
[40:06] in our midst and kind of an interesting
[40:09] thought isn't it but it's right in the
[40:11] scripture amen it's placed right there
[40:14] in the scripture and so let's just stand
[40:17] and we'll turn into Philippians 4 and uh
[40:20] tonight I think as we go along here uh
[40:23] you will recognize this scripture but I
[40:26] think sometimes we focus on certain
[40:29] portions we don't always focus on the
[40:32] whole and so tonight I just want to kind
[40:35] of bring this to you Philippians the
[40:37] fourth chapter verses 1 through 13.
[40:41] therefore my brethren dearly beloved and
[40:44] longed for my joy and Crown
[40:48] so Stand Fast in the Lord my dearly
[40:50] beloved these are these are terms of
[40:53] endearment Saints
[40:55] I beseech Judas and I beseech senses
[40:59] that they be of the same mind in the
[41:01] Lord and I entreat thee also
[41:05] true yoke fellow
[41:07] help those women which labored with me
[41:10] in the gospel with Clement also and with
[41:14] other my fellow laborers whose names are
[41:18] in the Book of Life
[41:20] now that is the kind of company
[41:24] we want to keep
[41:26] we want to be in the company The
[41:29] Fellowship of those whose names are in
[41:33] the book of life amen more specifically
[41:36] the Lamb's Book of Life amen
[41:39] we'll just uh let you be seated heavenly
[41:42] father I ask you to come tonight just
[41:44] open this make it real father must admit
[41:47] as I studied this seemed like I had a
[41:49] couple things that seemed to just hold
[41:51] me back but I asked for Liberty tonight
[41:54] Lord just to speak into the word of God
[41:56] father to be able to let the word just
[41:59] come alive in us Lord that we could walk
[42:02] out tonight and say was it not a truly
[42:06] wonderful to be in the house of God
[42:08] tonight Lord bless the Saints I pray
[42:11] each and every need amen you may be
[42:14] seated
[42:15] now yolk fellow here before we go on in
[42:18] this scripture I want to just lay this
[42:20] out yoke fellow has quite an interesting
[42:23] uh definition as you pair the two words
[42:26] and it's a a result it is an associate a
[42:32] companion a friend
[42:34] a buddy
[42:35] appear
[42:36] a helper
[42:38] so
[42:40] I entreat you also my associates
[42:44] oh my companions my friends
[42:47] my buddies my peers my helpers
[42:50] so we look at this quite a broad thought
[42:53] in the sense of of how it is describing
[42:56] these people that he is uh talking to
[42:59] and once again want to make this uh
[43:02] emphasis uh these are as as he's sharing
[43:06] this he's declaring these are people
[43:09] whose names are in the book of life amen
[43:13] that actually gets me very excited
[43:15] because you see I get to duplicate
[43:18] exactly what he was in that position
[43:20] tonight because I am here with those
[43:23] whose names are in the book of life amen
[43:25] we are not here as it were worshiping
[43:28] amongst the Heathen we are not
[43:30] worshiping some false god somewhere but
[43:33] we are worshiping the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:36] amen El Shaddai amen all of the
[43:40] definitive description descriptive names
[43:43] uh of uh our God Amen and here we are
[43:46] worshiping together amen excuse me I got
[43:49] kind of a dry tongue here tonight for
[43:51] some reason amen
[43:54] rejoice in the Lord alway again I say
[43:57] rejoice let your moderation be known
[44:01] unto all men the Lord is at hand and I
[44:04] find it interesting my brother and
[44:06] sister that there is a lot of things
[44:08] that are lawful but they are not
[44:10] expedient there's a lot of things that
[44:13] that are not bad for us as long as we
[44:16] are in moderation you know as the
[44:19] prophet of God showed us we can do a lot
[44:21] of things too much but we can never pray
[44:24] too much so don't let the devil try to
[44:26] keep your prayer life in moderation amen
[44:29] but you look at this and be careful for
[44:32] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[44:34] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[44:36] requests be made known unto God Amen I
[44:40] want to read that again because that
[44:41] really truly is a powerful verse right
[44:43] there be careful for nothing amen but in
[44:47] everything by prayer and supplication
[44:49] with Thanksgiving let your requests be
[44:52] made known unto God on now my brother
[44:55] and sister there's a lot of things that
[44:57] we can ask for it's not what we're
[44:59] asking for but it's how we're asking and
[45:02] so we are not Beggars God did not call
[45:04] us to be Beggars you don't need to come
[45:06] to the throne as a beggar but you can
[45:09] come boldly to the throne and as we come
[45:12] with the right motive and the right
[45:13] objective the word of God says that he
[45:16] would answer our prayer he would speak
[45:18] to our hearts he would give us what we
[45:21] have need of so be careful for nothing
[45:23] now you know my brother and sister as
[45:26] we'll do I just want to deviate into
[45:27] this you see in the world we live in
[45:30] today people take these scriptures not
[45:33] just this one in particular but they
[45:35] take these scriptures and they pray for
[45:37] wealth and they pray for all kinds of
[45:40] things and actually find those things
[45:42] coming into their life but my brother
[45:44] and sister the reason that God can give
[45:46] to you the desires of your heart is
[45:49] because he knows your desires are not
[45:52] locked up here in a carnal layer to
[45:54] seeing World your desires are to come in
[45:57] the Kingdom in his presence that's what
[46:00] you desire as a True Believer amen so
[46:03] it's there that we we just know that we
[46:06] ourselves are the limiting factor of our
[46:09] prayers and stuff being answered be
[46:12] careful for nothing but in everything by
[46:14] prayer and supplication with
[46:16] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[46:18] known unto God and the peace of God
[46:22] which
[46:24] passes all understanding amen we can't
[46:28] comprehend my brother and sister what we
[46:30] need to do is just claim it just believe
[46:33] it just say Lord I need some peace in my
[46:35] life I need some peace in my family or
[46:38] whatever the circumstance might be don't
[46:41] try to figure out how God's going to
[46:43] bring that peace to you just claim that
[46:46] peace amen and wherever the holy spirit
[46:48] is there's peace my brother and sister
[46:50] and the peace of God which passes all
[46:53] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[46:55] Minds through Christ Jesus now my
[46:58] brother and sister I have this in bold
[47:00] letters verse 8 I would actually like
[47:02] you to read it with me because I think
[47:05] this as being a very commonly quoted
[47:08] scripture is actually a very very
[47:11] powerful scripture because you see my
[47:14] brother and sister the devil would like
[47:16] to come in now we have a a a a
[47:19] chalkboard in our garage and I need to
[47:22] read it more often because sometimes you
[47:25] know I don't take what I read there to
[47:28] heart and you know the prophet of God
[47:30] told told us don't let any negative
[47:32] thing come from your lips don't speak
[47:34] those negative things and you know uh uh
[47:38] sister Jerry just the other day she kind
[47:40] of comes up there you know in the deal
[47:42] and she's
[47:45] and I'm like what are you trying to say
[47:49] look brother and sister the devil
[47:50] sometimes he slips in so cleverly it
[47:54] just anoints us to just kind of speak
[47:56] negative things would you read this with
[47:58] me
[47:59] finally Brethren whatsoever things are
[48:03] true whatsoever things are honest
[48:07] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[48:10] things are pure whatsoever things are
[48:14] lovely whatsoever things are of good
[48:17] report if there be any virtue and if
[48:21] there be any praise think on these
[48:25] things now I want to ask you Saints not
[48:27] in a judgmental fashion but can we can
[48:32] we fulfill this scripture
[48:34] can we find enough things in our life
[48:36] amen to to fulfill that to uh is there
[48:40] true things in our life is there honest
[48:43] things is there just is there pure is
[48:45] there things that are lovely things of
[48:48] good report if there be virtue if there
[48:50] be praise
[48:52] we should not have to delegate or or go
[48:56] back into things that are of the
[48:59] negative nature and so we recognize the
[49:02] spirit of laodicea is there very common
[49:05] to influence us very present in the
[49:08] world we live in my brother and sister
[49:10] God did not take us out of this world in
[49:13] fact I love how he dealt with the uh the
[49:16] apostles that he brought them out he
[49:19] saves them he cleans them up and then
[49:21] turns right around and sends them right
[49:23] back out into the very world he drew
[49:26] them out of because you see that's how
[49:28] we're effective we're not effective
[49:30] hidden our hiding places in Christ it's
[49:34] not in some cave here on the Earth today
[49:36] but we are here to go back out into the
[49:40] world Amen and to share the Gospel of
[49:43] Jesus Christ amen verse 9 says those
[49:47] things which ye have both learned and
[49:50] received and heard and my powerful here
[49:54] seen in me
[49:57] now common denote uh comma denotes that
[50:00] space of time so he's giving a pause
[50:02] there and now he's telling us do those
[50:05] things don't just talk about it don't
[50:07] let it be something we hear about in the
[50:09] house of God but let these things be
[50:12] active let something be happening and
[50:15] the God of Peace shall be with you but I
[50:17] rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at
[50:20] the last your care of me hath flourished
[50:23] again wherein you were also careful but
[50:27] you lacked opportunity
[50:29] may God add His blessings to the word I
[50:33] I believe this is a very positive verses
[50:35] that's why tonight I'm tying this into
[50:38] our thought uh very positive
[50:41] encouragement to the believer
[50:46] to bring us
[50:47] to a place to stand together
[50:50] now my brother and sister this body of
[50:52] Believers is separated
[50:55] by you might say time space and distance
[50:58] but this body of Believers is one body
[51:01] and there is a Unity that is brought
[51:04] forth in the day that we live in there
[51:06] is a Unity that is coming forth now I'm
[51:09] not I'm not told my just forget those
[51:12] things Paul amen so you see my brother
[51:15] and sister we're not looking for a
[51:16] man-made Unity there is uh opportunity
[51:19] people say we're we're trying to bring
[51:21] Unity into the message that brother and
[51:24] sister the real true Unity is not in
[51:27] this group we call the message but it is
[51:30] in the word of God it is the Holy Ghost
[51:32] himself that is now anointing Believers
[51:36] True Believers around the world right
[51:39] now anointed by the same Holy Spirit
[51:42] drawing us together one body of
[51:45] Believers amen and so it is a
[51:48] mini-membered body but still in spirit
[51:51] it is one body and so we stand together
[51:54] as as Believers around the world today
[51:58] the same Holy Spirit doesn't have a
[52:01] different gospel on the other side of
[52:03] the Earth but it is the same gospel and
[52:05] you know I shared with you here recently
[52:08] of of situations from my uh childhood
[52:11] and how that words that were preached to
[52:14] the young people and I don't know it
[52:16] might have caught some of you off guard
[52:18] I ask you you know these young people
[52:20] that heard this but they they ended up
[52:23] going and leaving and going away and I
[52:26] asked you what were they
[52:28] and I think some of you might have been
[52:30] surprised when I told you to see these
[52:32] people are backslid today not serving
[52:34] God and you might have been surprised
[52:36] when I said they were believers
[52:40] but you see they actually believed what
[52:43] was taught to them what was preached to
[52:45] them what was projected to them they
[52:48] actually believed that now imagine if it
[52:51] would have been that the gospel the true
[52:53] Gospel of Jesus Christ would have been
[52:56] preached to them in encouragement amen a
[52:59] standard raised up that they would be
[53:02] caught in the moment now we know that
[53:04] all things are according to the will of
[53:06] God but my brother and sister we don't
[53:08] know what the future is we're seeing
[53:10] around the world today people who have
[53:12] been away from the message for for
[53:13] periods of time I'll just leave it at
[53:15] that I know one up to 40 years and
[53:18] they're coming back and their their uh
[53:21] testimony is that they've been 40 years
[53:23] unhappy
[53:25] but God finally broke through the
[53:27] bitterness and and the wall the callous
[53:30] it was there and they've got to a point
[53:32] it's like what am I going to do and they
[53:35] just come and the Holy Spirit dealing
[53:37] with them and their thought is why don't
[53:39] I try Christ again
[53:41] you see it wasn't in a lot of cases it
[53:44] wasn't that our Lord Jesus Christ
[53:46] disappointed them it was how he was
[53:49] presented to them that was the false
[53:52] sight of that so we look at this and
[53:54] realize that we do not want to as a
[53:57] church as a Ministry we don't want to
[54:00] present Jesus Christ in a fashion that
[54:03] is discouraging but we want to present
[54:06] him in a fashion that is encouraging
[54:08] amen so when our young people or whoever
[54:11] it might be when they hear the word
[54:13] preach let them be Believers of the word
[54:16] that is preached to them let it be a
[54:19] word that is something they can take a
[54:21] holds of and know that God loves them
[54:23] not just loves them in word only but my
[54:26] brother and sister or God wants to pour
[54:28] His blessings pour His Spirit into them
[54:30] and it's up up to us you and I to create
[54:34] this atmosphere amen so there is these
[54:37] as we read this scripture there were
[54:40] these that were uh uh a true yolk fellow
[54:43] they were laborers that were were
[54:45] laboring amongst that and in this case
[54:47] he's speaking of of these sisters amen
[54:51] so as we bring forth a positive message
[54:54] which brings forth forth a positive life
[54:58] can we say Amen to that
[55:00] if we're hearing a positive message
[55:04] it will influence us to a positive life
[55:09] if it's presented that you may or may
[55:12] not make the Rapture then what you will
[55:14] dwell is in that cloud as our brother
[55:17] sang this song There Lord let me be
[55:19] Sanctified in what I say and do that you
[55:22] know some of us that are just uh uh a
[55:24] little more outspoken maybe or whatever
[55:26] you know that's something we need to
[55:29] hear to be encouraged that we can remain
[55:31] Sanctified and live this life and face
[55:34] every challenge that is in our daily
[55:36] life in our present circumstance but if
[55:39] we are told that we have failed and we
[55:42] hear that long enough you've all read
[55:44] about the monkeys and how that they put
[55:46] one in there and they wouldn't let it
[55:48] get the banana and then it went on until
[55:50] the monkeys themselves wouldn't let the
[55:52] new monkey even try to get to the banana
[55:55] so it is a behavior I'm not calling you
[55:58] monkeys
[56:00] but it's a behavior that's learned
[56:04] when you go into churches that worship
[56:06] my brother and sister and converts or
[56:08] people move into that church my brother
[56:10] and sister that one individual doesn't
[56:12] take worship away from that church the
[56:15] worship then becomes something that the
[56:17] new believer is pulled into because
[56:20] there's an influence there's a realm
[56:22] there and if you have that's not that
[56:25] same group but a similar group that
[56:27] doesn't worship at all you can have
[56:29] someone who's a worshiper come into that
[56:32] assembly and they will not be
[56:34] comfortable not worshiping but if
[56:36] they're not careful over time they will
[56:39] not lift their voice they will not lift
[56:41] their hands you will not hear the gospel
[56:43] as it were proclaimed from them as
[56:46] Worship in the service so it's there
[56:48] that we come and we bring forth an
[56:51] influence amen and I say we want to be
[56:54] true
[56:55] yolk fellow
[56:58] not woke fellow
[57:04] yoke fellow
[57:06] we don't want to be so sensitive about
[57:09] everything
[57:11] that if I'm worshiping God I think I
[57:13] better not because the people on the
[57:15] other side of the church might not want
[57:17] me to worship
[57:19] you imagine the message the devil's
[57:21] going to give to you every day of your
[57:24] life
[57:26] don't worship now the chickens might not
[57:28] like it
[57:31] but you see my brother and sister as
[57:34] fellow yoke fellows our job is to be
[57:38] helpers
[57:39] amen now to be a true yoke fellow
[57:43] one must be in or under the same burden
[57:47] remember the prophet of God's in Mexico
[57:49] and he's praying for that elderly man
[57:51] and he he uh you know some people say
[57:53] well anybody can kind of say that but my
[57:56] brother and sister when you get to the
[57:58] place that your spirit is groaning in
[58:01] your desire to help someone else your
[58:04] desire to make an impact in their life
[58:06] brother Brown saying my suit coat's too
[58:08] small my my shoes aren't big enough what
[58:10] can I do for this man but what I can do
[58:13] is I can pray for him I can enter into
[58:16] this spirit and groan in my spirit in
[58:19] true uh desire to see God move in that
[58:22] and sometimes it is in life my brother
[58:25] and sister we don't have enough money
[58:28] Tim packed or pull everybody out of
[58:30] their financial situation but we have
[58:33] enough prayers to
[58:34] we have more than enough prayers to make
[58:37] a difference
[58:39] but you see to be a fellow yoke fellow
[58:43] you have to be pulling in the same
[58:46] direction
[58:48] now if you've ever been around horses in
[58:50] your life that have been in tandem
[58:54] if you have one Desiring to go One
[58:57] Direction and one to go a different
[58:59] direction you find chaos you find a
[59:02] great struggle there so when he is
[59:05] speaking of this in this context my
[59:07] brother and sister he is actually has uh
[59:10] you might say an underspeak of there is
[59:14] unity in this body of Believers there is
[59:17] Unity that these Believers can pull
[59:19] together they can join together and go
[59:23] in the same direction with the same
[59:26] purpose that's true Unity that's not a
[59:28] Unity we can get by going and singing
[59:31] together it's not a Unity that we get by
[59:33] all slapping each other on the back
[59:35] after we have a breakfast that's not the
[59:38] kind of unity my brother and sister this
[59:40] is people who are be willing to be if I
[59:43] could just bring it in this fashion
[59:45] they're willing to be tied so close to
[59:48] another brother or a sister to sister to
[59:52] be able to say that whatever God leads
[59:55] we not I but we will follow
[59:58] amen that's where a body of believer
[1:00:00] starts to make an impact in the world
[1:00:03] around them is not when I believe God's
[1:00:06] leading me this way and another in the
[1:00:09] church says God's leading me this way so
[1:00:11] I guess we have two separate programs
[1:00:13] God's got one program amen God doesn't
[1:00:16] have multiple programs as it were if you
[1:00:18] follow me now you look at this so they
[1:00:21] must be pulling in the same direction
[1:00:23] now look at this my brother and sister I
[1:00:25] tried to this is a Wednesday night I'm
[1:00:28] trying to control myself from Old Habits
[1:00:31] but full adoption I believe you you'll
[1:00:34] catch this full adoption gives us the
[1:00:37] ability to be yoked to Christ
[1:00:40] and to one another
[1:00:43] without full adoption we cannot we will
[1:00:45] constantly have a struggle of the
[1:00:47] direction you'll see sometimes within a
[1:00:49] church there's a struggle part of the
[1:00:51] church wants to go this way part wants
[1:00:54] to go this way but there has to be
[1:00:56] something that binds that group of
[1:00:59] Believers together and that is when we
[1:01:02] in full adoption have the ability to
[1:01:04] stop and let God put the Yoke on
[1:01:08] not man's joke not the devil's joke
[1:01:12] God joke you can go study this maybe
[1:01:15] we'll speak again next Wednesday or so I
[1:01:17] don't know but look at this my brother
[1:01:19] and sister God's got a yoke he wants you
[1:01:21] to wear
[1:01:22] it's not like I've been delivered from
[1:01:24] the Yoke of the devil and now I'm free
[1:01:26] no God wants you to be yoked to him he
[1:01:30] wants you to go in parallel with him
[1:01:33] that means the direction he's going
[1:01:36] you're going what his desire is is your
[1:01:40] desire it's not Lord thy will be done
[1:01:43] and my will will be done but lord it's
[1:01:47] my will is your will and your will is my
[1:01:49] will that we can walk in tandem or
[1:01:52] parallel with our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:01:55] not fight him
[1:01:56] not hide him
[1:01:58] you know years ago
[1:02:00] I hope this makes sense to you in in my
[1:02:03] thought years ago he's passed on now but
[1:02:06] there was a man had had a very large
[1:02:09] Ranch at that time it got broke up by
[1:02:11] inheritance but he had a very large
[1:02:13] Ranch and you know sometimes they could
[1:02:15] not uh uh it spanned from out here in
[1:02:19] the Hawaii's all the way to the Bruno
[1:02:20] Canyon
[1:02:21] we're talking about land that was so to
[1:02:24] speak his it's government ground but he
[1:02:26] he wrenched on that it went for a
[1:02:29] hundred miles south in the Hawaii's and
[1:02:32] they would sometimes take two three four
[1:02:34] years to go back and do a Roundup but he
[1:02:37] was the kind of man that when he did a
[1:02:38] Roundup every animal was going to go and
[1:02:41] he had this big old ox and he would
[1:02:44] catch these big old three and
[1:02:45] four-year-old steers that would not do
[1:02:47] it and they would tie them to that ox
[1:02:50] and so is that Ox Who Loved home
[1:02:54] they fed him grain at home
[1:02:57] they would tie this big old steer to
[1:03:00] that ox and then all he did is turn him
[1:03:02] loose
[1:03:04] and sometimes you know
[1:03:07] his children which I was friends with
[1:03:09] one of them
[1:03:11] he'd say Dad what do you think and he
[1:03:13] says well son don't worry about it it
[1:03:15] was a long ways out there
[1:03:18] and then one morning they would come and
[1:03:20] there at the water trough and the Corral
[1:03:22] at the ranch would be this ox
[1:03:25] well this big feisty believer I mean
[1:03:28] steer
[1:03:31] at that point
[1:03:33] whatever Direction the ox wanted to go
[1:03:35] this tear said I'm good with that
[1:03:40] amen sometimes God ties us to things
[1:03:43] because he knows what it's going to take
[1:03:45] to bring us to the place that we'll say
[1:03:48] Lord thy will be done not my will
[1:03:52] oh look even our lord Jesus learned by
[1:03:55] the things that he suffered oh how much
[1:03:59] more so my brother and sister that we of
[1:04:02] this human nature have got to come to a
[1:04:05] place that we can freely from our spirit
[1:04:07] say Lord thy will be done and we don't
[1:04:11] want to balk against the Yoke we don't
[1:04:13] want to fight against it it don't want
[1:04:15] to be a constant bottle of rebellion but
[1:04:18] God's looking for us to come to the
[1:04:20] place that we recognize I'm a Son of God
[1:04:22] I'm a daughter of God I was meant to go
[1:04:25] this way and God's not going to lose me
[1:04:28] he's not going to take me halfway
[1:04:30] through the Wilderness and say well if
[1:04:32] you're going to keep kicking I'll just
[1:04:34] turn you loose
[1:04:36] but he said I purchased you
[1:04:38] and I will deliver you
[1:04:41] amen we ought to thank the Lord for that
[1:04:44] Hallelujah because some of us still
[1:04:47] every once in a while fight the yoke
[1:04:51] so we have to be pulling in the same
[1:04:53] direction you see the real believer and
[1:04:56] the make-believer
[1:04:58] will never be good yoke fellows together
[1:05:02] right the scripture says for us not to
[1:05:04] be unequally yoked you see because
[1:05:07] there's no way that we can be yoked to
[1:05:10] the unbeliever and look I'm talking in a
[1:05:13] spiritual context tonight there's no way
[1:05:15] we can be tied to the unbeliever and end
[1:05:19] up going in the same direction they'll
[1:05:21] either lead you away from the cross or
[1:05:23] you'll be leading them to the cross and
[1:05:26] my brother and sister if they're an
[1:05:27] unbeliever you know sometimes you read
[1:05:29] and we get this feeling like well Lord
[1:05:32] just you know kind of feel like you're
[1:05:34] just going to save everybody or kind of
[1:05:36] save all this no prophet of God comes
[1:05:38] along and says you know a mother ask a
[1:05:41] question will will my children be saved
[1:05:45] Stark reality Saints
[1:05:48] the prophet on one hand tells us apply
[1:05:50] the token claim them in the name of
[1:05:52] Jesus Christ
[1:05:53] and then a mother asks a question will
[1:05:55] my children be saved
[1:05:57] go study it out the prophet of God says
[1:06:01] they'll be saved if that's seed
[1:06:04] is in them
[1:06:06] a stark reality
[1:06:09] be hard for a mother to believe she
[1:06:10] bursts someone that didn't have the seed
[1:06:13] of God
[1:06:15] but a stark reality my brother and
[1:06:17] sister so you know no matter how good
[1:06:19] you know how many times you know the
[1:06:22] message had kind of a rash I hope it's
[1:06:23] went away
[1:06:25] but kind of a rash there you know that
[1:06:27] was going to have you know like a
[1:06:29] marriage conversion
[1:06:31] I'll marry this really cute boy that's
[1:06:33] not saved but you know over time I'm
[1:06:35] pretty sure that he wants to serve God
[1:06:37] he loves me you know and I love the Lord
[1:06:39] so surely they'll my brother and sister
[1:06:41] you you can't do that
[1:06:43] amen you can't because you're from the
[1:06:46] very get-go being yoked to something
[1:06:48] that wants to go a different direction
[1:06:49] vice versa young men young women so you
[1:06:52] look at this what God wants us to do if
[1:06:55] we're going to be yoked we got to be
[1:06:56] yoked to him first
[1:06:58] amen and then we become yoked as it is
[1:07:01] in marriage and business and all the
[1:07:03] rest of these things and fellowship in
[1:07:05] the body of Believers but we have to be
[1:07:07] yoked to Christ first and he's not going
[1:07:10] to lead you to be yoked to unbelief
[1:07:14] the prophet of God said he will never
[1:07:16] lead you away from his word
[1:07:18] amen
[1:07:20] so you see here it's not impossible for
[1:07:23] the wise we just heard this last week in
[1:07:26] some Ministry on the wise and the
[1:07:28] foolish
[1:07:29] it's not too impossible for the wise and
[1:07:31] the foolish to be truly yoked together
[1:07:34] I didn't say unbeliever Saints I said
[1:07:36] foolish
[1:07:38] you see their desire that they have as
[1:07:41] foolish virgin is not the same intensity
[1:07:44] it's not the same level of commitment
[1:07:47] it's not the same desire to search out
[1:07:50] the Deep things of God yes they've heard
[1:07:52] the message
[1:07:54] oh let me put this out there too some
[1:07:57] people believe the foolish virgin is the
[1:07:58] denomination out there but my brother
[1:08:00] and sister that is not close enough to
[1:08:02] make the scripture work the foolish
[1:08:04] virgins right in there amongst the
[1:08:07] message claiming they have a god-sent
[1:08:10] prophet
[1:08:13] come on I know that's a little straight
[1:08:15] but people say well no no that's someone
[1:08:17] else that's the devil lying to you
[1:08:19] because then you can lay down on the job
[1:08:22] amen you know uh go back to the ruble
[1:08:25] family you know they had a big old steer
[1:08:27] one time that uh just when that big old
[1:08:30] Ox started back towards the ranch that
[1:08:32] big old steer said huh you know what
[1:08:34] I'll just lay down
[1:08:40] and my friend Jerry says
[1:08:42] Dad how are we going to get that back
[1:08:44] they just laid down he said don't worry
[1:08:46] about his son it's not our problem we've
[1:08:48] turned it over
[1:08:49] and they had a name for the ox blue I
[1:08:51] think it was we've turned it over to
[1:08:52] Blue it's Blue's job
[1:08:55] two weeks later
[1:08:57] blue comes in the yard
[1:08:59] with this big old steer that's got the
[1:09:01] hide War off of him on every side you
[1:09:04] can imagine because he laid on his left
[1:09:06] he got drug on his left he laid on the
[1:09:08] right he got drugged on the right he put
[1:09:10] his knees down he got his knees skin
[1:09:12] amen he was skinned from the tip of his
[1:09:15] nose to the tip of his tail and all blue
[1:09:17] was thinking there's grain ahead of me
[1:09:19] there's grain ahead of me I'm going home
[1:09:21] I'm going home
[1:09:23] amen I hope you catch the spiritual
[1:09:26] context amen otherwise you know it's
[1:09:30] there and if the foolish virgin as it
[1:09:32] were I'm not judging them
[1:09:34] we just want to keep the fire lit Saints
[1:09:37] we don't want to sit around and say well
[1:09:39] if God wants me to this pick up the word
[1:09:42] this is God speaking pick up the word
[1:09:44] Lord what do you want me to do he
[1:09:47] already told us Saints a Prophet come
[1:09:49] and set it all in order but it's right
[1:09:52] here for us to read after it was said in
[1:09:55] order it's still in front of us he
[1:09:58] didn't take it away he left it here and
[1:10:00] if we are supposed to be on fire don't
[1:10:03] let somebody else tell you it's okay to
[1:10:06] let the fire burn out once in a while
[1:10:09] no sir we're called to keep the fire lit
[1:10:12] all the time
[1:10:14] Hallelujah
[1:10:15] so it's nine to impossible for wise and
[1:10:18] foolish to be truly yoked together
[1:10:21] oh we share a common message
[1:10:24] but look at the world they share a
[1:10:26] common Bible
[1:10:28] and look at the disparity
[1:10:30] that's there
[1:10:35] does the wise and the foolish share a
[1:10:37] common commitment
[1:10:42] they want to serve God
[1:10:45] they want to be right in the eyes of God
[1:10:49] but the final step
[1:10:52] the final step the final effort
[1:10:56] it takes a Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:11:01] to bring this old flesh into commitment
[1:11:04] for the final step
[1:11:07] amen oh it's not something we can do
[1:11:10] Saints
[1:11:11] amen God's done great things in our
[1:11:13] midst I think every one of us could talk
[1:11:16] of the things that God has done but my
[1:11:18] brother and sister to realize that God
[1:11:20] is the one that is moving us forward God
[1:11:23] is the one that says not to stop here
[1:11:25] this is not your final resting place but
[1:11:28] you must keep pressing on and it's the
[1:11:31] Holy Ghost because when you quit last
[1:11:34] time
[1:11:37] yeah
[1:11:38] when you quit last time it wasn't a man
[1:11:41] that got you up it wasn't a woman that
[1:11:43] got you up it wasn't some great preacher
[1:11:46] that got you up it was a holy ghost amen
[1:11:49] and said you know what I'm yoke to you
[1:11:51] and I'm going back home amen I'm going
[1:11:54] back to my place and you are gonna go
[1:11:57] with me amen and I'm sorry to use such a
[1:12:00] simple country analogy but if you are
[1:12:02] skinned from head to toe you're still
[1:12:05] going God's not going to let you just
[1:12:07] sit on the side and languish away saying
[1:12:10] well I tried to help him he says that's
[1:12:12] my son that's my daughter that's my seed
[1:12:15] and I've never lost a seed I've never
[1:12:18] misplaced a seed I've never had a seed
[1:12:21] die on me and so you better get right up
[1:12:23] and I'm gonna put some life in you and
[1:12:26] we are going on
[1:12:27] Hallelujah I thank the Lord for that
[1:12:30] amen because I tell you some of us are a
[1:12:32] little more temperamental than others
[1:12:34] and when the temperamental type when
[1:12:36] they're High boy watch out get out of
[1:12:38] their way but when they're low you
[1:12:40] better watch out because they'll be
[1:12:42] shrapnel when they crash
[1:12:44] and God says but I don't care that's my
[1:12:46] still my seed
[1:12:48] whether you were high yesterday and
[1:12:50] you're low today or vice versa it
[1:12:52] doesn't matter you're my seed and I will
[1:12:54] make the way before you and I'll bring
[1:12:57] you to that place
[1:12:58] amen because
[1:13:02] I'm going to make you a yoke fellow
[1:13:05] who wants to be a yoke fellow
[1:13:07] Hallelujah he's going to make us be yoke
[1:13:10] fellows not by force my brother and
[1:13:12] sister but by that deposit of his own
[1:13:15] nature his own life his own desire that
[1:13:18] deposit down in US comes and it breaks
[1:13:21] through all of the the hard shell as it
[1:13:24] were that Satan's tried to put on you to
[1:13:27] keep you from breaking out and being who
[1:13:29] you're called to do and God just keeps
[1:13:31] pecking away and taking that amen and
[1:13:34] breaks it away until boom there we are
[1:13:36] and we say boy I wished I could have
[1:13:38] been this way years ago God's perfect in
[1:13:40] his time
[1:13:42] God's perfect in his time Saints
[1:13:44] amen
[1:13:48] now the foolish and the wise we can say
[1:13:52] on this that they share a common
[1:13:53] commitment but yet they don't
[1:13:57] because you see one
[1:14:00] was not committed to have oil
[1:14:04] until they realize the very key that
[1:14:06] would put them in the marriage supper
[1:14:09] is at the moment
[1:14:12] Saints let's not
[1:14:14] let's not lay around
[1:14:17] let's not just party as it were with the
[1:14:20] world
[1:14:21] until we hear the words the bridegroom
[1:14:24] coming
[1:14:25] see that's not what God wanted God
[1:14:27] wanted you and I to be on fire and when
[1:14:30] we saw that our oil was getting a little
[1:14:32] bit low oh you know some of us I I don't
[1:14:35] mean to inject myself into this but I'll
[1:14:37] just tell you the nature of how some of
[1:14:39] us are I run out of gas one time as a
[1:14:42] teenager and it's interesting because I
[1:14:44] wasn't really out of Gauss it's just the
[1:14:46] hill I was driving up it was so steep
[1:14:48] that the gas wasn't there to be sucked
[1:14:50] into the carburetor
[1:14:51] and so my dad looked me in the face
[1:14:55] after he'd come and rescued me
[1:14:57] and uh it's an interesting story you
[1:15:00] know uh
[1:15:02] actually the house I walked to went and
[1:15:04] knocked on the door a very fancy house
[1:15:07] knocked on the door the door opened as a
[1:15:10] girl I went to high school with
[1:15:12] I I wouldn't say that we were friends
[1:15:14] but we weren't enemies but she opens the
[1:15:17] door and she looks at me and goes what
[1:15:18] are you doing at my house
[1:15:23] yeah I'm wondering what am I doing
[1:15:26] my dad come and he put this and this is
[1:15:28] the point I really want to make
[1:15:29] my dad set me down and he said Son
[1:15:33] it costs just as much money
[1:15:36] to drive on the bottom of the fuel tank
[1:15:39] as it does the top
[1:15:42] of the fuel tank
[1:15:44] have you noticed you never see someone
[1:15:47] pulling the gas station
[1:15:49] and put two dollars worth of gas in a
[1:15:52] car that's got 7 8 of a tank
[1:15:55] of gasoline
[1:15:57] it is the human nature
[1:16:01] that when the needle has has quit
[1:16:04] bouncing at the bottom
[1:16:08] those of you that drive like that need
[1:16:11] to repent
[1:16:17] and I've got scripture to back it up
[1:16:23] keep it full
[1:16:25] keep it full Saints don't be in this
[1:16:28] desperation all the time oh Lord help me
[1:16:33] I O Lord Oh Lord oh no my brother and
[1:16:36] sister keep it full
[1:16:38] it doesn't cost you any more to keep it
[1:16:40] full than it does if you're bouncing it
[1:16:42] off the bottom keep it full
[1:16:46] but it's the nature of humanity that we
[1:16:49] drive and we drive I should stop
[1:16:51] now the fact that I had any of you
[1:16:53] remember Twinkies
[1:16:55] yes you know they're this thing that
[1:16:57] they say Will Survive a nuclear
[1:17:00] Holocaust
[1:17:01] they say you should store Twinkies
[1:17:03] because they will last a hundred years
[1:17:07] I'm sorry to admit with shame I used to
[1:17:10] be a Twinkie addict
[1:17:15] and my excuse to buy Twinkies was I got
[1:17:17] to stop put gas in my car
[1:17:20] regular fill it up
[1:17:22] almost every day I was maybe the guy two
[1:17:25] two bucks gotta top the tank off gotta
[1:17:28] have a reason to park right here and the
[1:17:30] Twinkies are only 10 steps away through
[1:17:32] that door
[1:17:33] then they actually put a little drive up
[1:17:35] service window there and when I was
[1:17:37] getting gas the older couple that owned
[1:17:39] it would open the window how many
[1:17:42] Twinkies do you want Paul
[1:17:45] hmm
[1:17:47] yeah
[1:17:50] pray that we would come into the house
[1:17:52] of God
[1:17:53] as such a spirit about us such a nature
[1:17:57] about us that the Holy Spirit would say
[1:17:59] my son my daughter is here for a
[1:18:01] refilling tonight we're going to have a
[1:18:03] good time in the house of God tonight
[1:18:05] because my sons and my daughters I know
[1:18:07] them I know their hearts desire I know
[1:18:10] their life and they are here tonight not
[1:18:13] just to go to church but they're here
[1:18:15] tonight regardless of how much is gone
[1:18:18] out of the cruise they are here tonight
[1:18:20] to refill it I want to be that kind of
[1:18:23] Christian that kind of believer that the
[1:18:26] Lord would know my heart and when I
[1:18:28] would come that the word of God he would
[1:18:30] anoint the preacher he would anoint a
[1:18:33] song leader he would anoint somebody
[1:18:34] singing a special song that it would
[1:18:36] anoint and we would say yes Lord yes I
[1:18:40] need a refilling tonight
[1:18:42] and some of the world the foolish would
[1:18:44] say what are you talking about there's
[1:18:46] barely any room
[1:18:48] yes Lord top it off
[1:18:51] fill it up Lord
[1:18:53] you see
[1:18:55] my point I'm trying to make there
[1:18:58] is we do but we don't share a common
[1:19:01] commitment
[1:19:03] because the foolish virgin
[1:19:05] went so far Saints as to the day they
[1:19:09] heard the voice behold the bridegroom
[1:19:11] cometh
[1:19:12] the scripture says
[1:19:15] that their lamp their vessel Cruise
[1:19:17] however you want to put this
[1:19:19] was empty
[1:19:21] it wouldn't sustain Flame
[1:19:25] so
[1:19:27] are you with me
[1:19:28] same commitment but not
[1:19:33] because one has this desire I must keep
[1:19:35] this full
[1:19:37] I must keep this lamp
[1:19:40] trimmed and clear
[1:19:45] so we look at this and I'm not trying to
[1:19:47] be harsh tonight you know that but will
[1:19:50] they share the same reward
[1:19:52] no no
[1:19:54] one got to get up and go with the
[1:19:57] bridegroom
[1:19:58] and the door is closed and one is
[1:20:00] searching for oil but can't find it
[1:20:02] because that is then in the season that
[1:20:05] when they were going to go buy oil
[1:20:08] it was not available
[1:20:22] amen how can we plagiarize the gospel
[1:20:24] though
[1:20:25] now
[1:20:26] in the message return in Jubilee brother
[1:20:28] Brown says a servant now
[1:20:30] I'll make a little shift here I hope you
[1:20:32] can shift with me a servant now remember
[1:20:35] a servant gets his reward or his wages
[1:20:39] but he was never to be free in the
[1:20:41] Jubilee
[1:20:44] I want you to catch this now
[1:20:47] there are people here and God's healing
[1:20:49] them
[1:20:50] God's answering prayers
[1:20:53] is that our reward
[1:20:56] we could get really technical couldn't
[1:20:58] we
[1:20:59] but it's truly not our reward
[1:21:03] that's not what we're living for right
[1:21:05] now we're not living
[1:21:07] to be healed we're not living to be
[1:21:09] blessed those are attributes that God
[1:21:12] pours out and manifests to us to show us
[1:21:15] that he is present and with us and
[1:21:17] fulfilling his promise amen God Is
[1:21:20] Bigger my brother and sister than his
[1:21:22] promise I heard the prophet say that the
[1:21:24] other day God is bigger than his promise
[1:21:28] in other words he doesn't have to labor
[1:21:30] to fulfill that promise he's bigger than
[1:21:33] the promise amen so this servant will
[1:21:36] never be free in the Jubilee no sir a
[1:21:39] servant was not free in the Jubilee that
[1:21:41] was not born in Israelite now look my
[1:21:44] brother and sister you'll catch this and
[1:21:46] I know you will but I just feel a need
[1:21:47] to elaborate just a little bit we did
[1:21:50] not become Sons and Daughters of God
[1:21:53] we always were
[1:21:55] right so we didn't get converted into
[1:21:59] this we were born into this
[1:22:03] amen
[1:22:05] so not freeing the Jubilee that was not
[1:22:07] born a Believer I mean an Israelite he
[1:22:10] had to be born in order to be free in
[1:22:12] the Jubilee He got His wages so as a
[1:22:15] servant gets his wages and many people
[1:22:17] get their rewards Jesus said about the
[1:22:19] Hypocrites said they have their rewards
[1:22:21] but you're different yes that's what
[1:22:23] Jesus was saying in John 8 about the
[1:22:25] Jews they said we are free and he said
[1:22:27] the servant does not abide in the house
[1:22:29] but when he gave them birth there was no
[1:22:33] longer they were no longer servants they
[1:22:36] were sons and joined heirs with him in
[1:22:38] the Kingdom that's the way the church is
[1:22:40] it's joint heirs with Christ in the
[1:22:42] Kingdom Heirs of all things to God
[1:22:44] through him
[1:22:45] amen and now we find that the church
[1:22:48] moved off the same direction that its
[1:22:51] forefathers moved in and the first
[1:22:53] organizations of the churches of
[1:22:55] churches it had been that way down
[1:22:57] Through the Ages but they were never
[1:22:59] never the servants will not be free
[1:23:03] come on I want that to soak in
[1:23:05] the servants will not be free they will
[1:23:08] not hear the word they will not believe
[1:23:11] the word the servants they heard the
[1:23:14] trumpets sound that priest riding
[1:23:16] through the land sounding this trumpet
[1:23:18] that every man was free sounded out
[1:23:21] throughout
[1:23:23] Liberty all out the lands and every man
[1:23:26] that was born to Jew knowed he could go
[1:23:28] back to his inheritance I don't care how
[1:23:31] far he was sold what happened he could
[1:23:34] go back because he was born in that
[1:23:36] house he was in his father's house born
[1:23:39] but the servant didn't know what he was
[1:23:42] doing
[1:23:44] see what's happening in the day my
[1:23:45] brother and sister we hear a lot of
[1:23:47] people
[1:23:49] I'm a Christian I'm a Christian I'm a
[1:23:51] Christian
[1:23:53] but you see without hearing the Jubilee
[1:23:57] which can be typed as the word for our
[1:24:00] hour that's what set us free was not the
[1:24:03] church my brother and sister it's the
[1:24:05] word of the hour is what set us free
[1:24:09] so we have heard the Jubilee call and
[1:24:13] because we are not servants we are Sons
[1:24:15] and Daughters we can respond and I say
[1:24:18] God help us to respond don't don't wait
[1:24:22] don't linger don't don't sit back to see
[1:24:25] what will happen this is God's promise
[1:24:27] to you and I
[1:24:29] amen
[1:24:30] they will not be free they'll never hear
[1:24:32] the word they will not believe the word
[1:24:34] the servants they heard the trumpet
[1:24:35] sound that priest riding through the
[1:24:37] lamb through the land my brother and
[1:24:39] sister we've heard it it's went through
[1:24:41] the land
[1:24:42] sounding this trumpet that every man was
[1:24:44] free
[1:24:45] sounded out throughout Liberty all out
[1:24:48] the lands and every man was born to do
[1:24:50] note he could go back to his inheritance
[1:24:54] oh I'm reading this again Saints this is
[1:24:56] not by accident I'm reading this on
[1:24:57] purpose to you I want you to catch this
[1:25:00] I don't care how far he was sold
[1:25:04] in that one of the devil's favorite
[1:25:06] tactics you've gone too far for God to
[1:25:10] forgive you or save you
[1:25:12] no that's a lie of the devil we can't go
[1:25:15] too far when we're Sons and Daughters of
[1:25:16] God might have been sold and resold and
[1:25:19] resold and resold and resold but when
[1:25:22] the Jubilee sounded and the Word was
[1:25:24] brought forward we are free amen amen we
[1:25:28] can take that word of God and stand on
[1:25:30] it
[1:25:31] ah Hallelujah because he was born in the
[1:25:34] house he was in his father's house
[1:25:37] but the servant
[1:25:39] didn't know what he was doing oh my
[1:25:45] now look at this
[1:25:49] there had to be
[1:25:53] there had to be
[1:25:54] something
[1:25:57] that caused these people
[1:26:00] to respond
[1:26:03] I was born in the message
[1:26:05] pretty common phrase to hear in the day
[1:26:07] and age we live in
[1:26:09] we've got a young people here tonight
[1:26:12] born in the message
[1:26:16] won't get you
[1:26:18] any further down the road
[1:26:22] than anyone else
[1:26:27] but Born Into The Kingdom
[1:26:33] the road might be Rocky
[1:26:36] but you know what God will do
[1:26:38] he'll send some of those fellow servants
[1:26:40] as they were also referred to
[1:26:44] and they'll somehow just come up beside
[1:26:46] you
[1:26:48] you say oh I credit brother so and so
[1:26:51] sister so and so for helping me in on my
[1:26:53] hard times
[1:26:55] do you know that was actually Christ
[1:26:59] just walking in flesh
[1:27:02] it's amazing to me in the world we live
[1:27:04] in and the time and how much of the
[1:27:05] word's been revealed that people still
[1:27:07] would balk at the idea that God has come
[1:27:10] down and stepped into flesh and is here
[1:27:12] and it's my brothers my sister I call
[1:27:15] him brother Trevor I call him whoever
[1:27:17] but it's Christ
[1:27:21] it's Christ no man can get us through
[1:27:23] this
[1:27:24] no sister can get us through this
[1:27:27] but Christ is there what is this my
[1:27:30] brother and sister these are as it is
[1:27:32] some of this that we are speaking of
[1:27:34] here these are yoke fellows amen they're
[1:27:37] your brothers your sisters your
[1:27:39] companion your friend buddy peer helper
[1:27:42] but they are there because God in them
[1:27:46] is leading them to do this
[1:27:48] God is leading and guiding inspiring to
[1:27:52] do this it's not they themselves you say
[1:27:55] these are good people they help everyone
[1:27:56] my brother and sister we need more than
[1:27:59] a free lunch
[1:28:06] both of them were working for the same
[1:28:08] Master sold under sin many of
[1:28:11] Pentecostal tonight has sold the same
[1:28:12] way O Brother return go back to your
[1:28:15] original inheritance all of your yours
[1:28:18] turn and go back it's time to go back he
[1:28:21] that now the Heathen slave could not do
[1:28:24] that he didn't know nothing about it
[1:28:26] after all a heathen means an unbeliever
[1:28:28] an unbeliever in the word many of them
[1:28:31] will take dogmas and rituals and Creeds
[1:28:33] of the church instead of listening to
[1:28:35] the real word
[1:28:37] and when the real word sounds itself out
[1:28:40] right because this Living Word is the
[1:28:43] person of Jesus Christ amen and so when
[1:28:46] this sounds out
[1:28:49] they don't know what you're talking
[1:28:52] about I'm sure that you've experienced
[1:28:54] that when you go to witness of the Lord
[1:28:56] Jesus Christ and people say I don't have
[1:28:58] a clue I don't even I really don't even
[1:29:00] want to know
[1:29:02] they don't know what you're talking
[1:29:03] about they want to call you a Holy
[1:29:05] Roller they want to call you like they
[1:29:07] did the forefathers 50 years ago in
[1:29:09] Louisiana crazy like it was back in the
[1:29:12] days of Paul in the way of heresy that's
[1:29:14] the way I worship the god of my
[1:29:16] forefathers
[1:29:17] now sorry this is a lengthy quote but
[1:29:19] I'm not sorry because I I thought it was
[1:29:21] very good see the Heathen don't know
[1:29:23] nothing about it I want to ask you
[1:29:25] tonight do you know something
[1:29:27] amen we're not heathens we know
[1:29:29] something why is it because the Holy
[1:29:31] Ghost has come down and revealed amen
[1:29:34] this word to us and when Christ is
[1:29:37] revealed to us my brother and sister we
[1:29:39] can never be the same the prophet of God
[1:29:40] said the Bible becomes a brand new book
[1:29:43] oh it's not for us to read between lines
[1:29:46] to boast of but we read between the
[1:29:48] lines because we are seeing not just a
[1:29:52] God but our God Amen the Lord Jesus
[1:29:55] Christ is there in the word reaching out
[1:29:58] to us and by God's grace we can see that
[1:30:00] amen unbeliever makes him a heathen it
[1:30:04] was only for the elected God's chosen
[1:30:07] that's the way it is today
[1:30:11] come on
[1:30:13] God's chosen we're not talking history
[1:30:15] here tonight Saints we're talking about
[1:30:18] our day amen Our lives our children our
[1:30:22] families our marriages we're talking
[1:30:24] about all of this that pertains to us
[1:30:26] right now
[1:30:28] amen not him that runeth or him that
[1:30:30] willeth it's God that has Mercy it's God
[1:30:33] that does it God by his grace Jesus said
[1:30:36] no man can come to me except my father
[1:30:38] draws him that's what's been happening
[1:30:40] the whole time isn't that amazing oh you
[1:30:43] know like I said the last time you quit
[1:30:53] yeah you might have been laying prostate
[1:30:55] I can't prostrate uh
[1:31:00] you can't take a pill for this
[1:31:04] you might have been just laying flat out
[1:31:06] give up give out whatever God's there
[1:31:09] he's just keeps
[1:31:11] Paulie
[1:31:13] drawing us
[1:31:15] and along the way we say I don't know oh
[1:31:18] how did you get delivered from from
[1:31:20] those cigarettes or from that alcohol or
[1:31:22] whatever it is
[1:31:24] well God's got a 42-step plan and I
[1:31:27] followed it to the letter
[1:31:29] no sir
[1:31:31] go to church just read a lovely
[1:31:32] testimony
[1:31:34] man went to church not a church going
[1:31:36] man the night before he'd been in a bar
[1:31:38] drunk
[1:31:40] goes to church
[1:31:41] tried to quit smoking
[1:31:43] but instead of quitting it got worse he
[1:31:45] went from smoking a few cigarettes today
[1:31:47] to smoking three to four packs a day
[1:31:51] goes to church
[1:31:53] gets up the next morning
[1:31:57] and he starts looking around grabs a
[1:31:59] cigarette packs shakes a cigarette out
[1:32:02] holding it in his fingers
[1:32:04] and he said I'm disgusted
[1:32:08] never picked it up again
[1:32:13] well we can explain that his iron level
[1:32:15] and the sulfur and the blah blah blah in
[1:32:18] his blood caused the smell of the
[1:32:20] tobacco to you know
[1:32:23] yeah
[1:32:26] for sure yeah
[1:32:34] no man can come to me except my father
[1:32:35] draws him all the father has given me
[1:32:37] will come to me it's God's grace that he
[1:32:39] chose the church before the foundation
[1:32:42] of the world that church will hear the
[1:32:45] word of God now I hope tonight I'm
[1:32:47] talking to that church I'm quite
[1:32:49] positive I am they'll turn every Creed
[1:32:53] down they'll turn every organization
[1:32:55] every denomination that's contrary down
[1:32:58] and they'll serve God by the power of
[1:33:02] the Holy Ghost amen they certainly know
[1:33:04] the trumpet sound my sheep hear my voice
[1:33:07] what are you talking about the word you
[1:33:11] say that's god's voice I say that's
[1:33:14] god's voice amen and that voice has been
[1:33:18] speaking to us my brother and sister and
[1:33:20] there has been a bride that is
[1:33:23] responding amen but look this yoke
[1:33:26] fellows are hearing the same voice it
[1:33:29] wasn't just the preacher the prophet of
[1:33:31] God talked about that we don't need just
[1:33:33] an anointing clergy we need an anointed
[1:33:36] body to receive the word not just people
[1:33:40] sitting there under that inspiration of
[1:33:42] anointed clergy oh they're so great
[1:33:44] they're so great they have such Spirit
[1:33:46] the body of Believers the fellow yoke
[1:33:50] fellows are anointed and hearing that
[1:33:53] same voice and then we come under that
[1:33:55] anointing and we start lifting up those
[1:33:58] around us we start becoming of a service
[1:34:00] to the body in other words we could go
[1:34:03] and we could go home and we could say
[1:34:05] what is the things in my life amen it
[1:34:08] might not hurt you to do this what is
[1:34:10] the things in my life that I want God to
[1:34:12] do write them out on a page and then put
[1:34:15] that page over there and say Lord anoint
[1:34:18] the body of Believers to pray for those
[1:34:20] needs and then take another page and
[1:34:23] write the needs of the body of Believers
[1:34:26] down and you pray for these and God will
[1:34:29] anoint the Believers to pray for the
[1:34:32] needs of your own life it will Works my
[1:34:34] brother and sister but you know the
[1:34:36] human nature we write the list of our
[1:34:38] needs down and we pray over our needs
[1:34:41] when we should be praying for the body
[1:34:43] we are not yoke fellows when we're
[1:34:45] praying for ourself
[1:34:47] where yoke fellows when we're praying
[1:34:49] for one another
[1:34:51] to lift up the body of Believers because
[1:34:53] you see God knows your need
[1:34:56] and then God anoints those in the body
[1:34:59] to recognize your need also
[1:35:02] have you ever notice some Believers will
[1:35:04] just never
[1:35:05] they just never never
[1:35:07] will bring up their struggle
[1:35:11] you won't hear a single word about their
[1:35:12] struggle
[1:35:17] well I'm too spiritual I don't want to
[1:35:20] no you're not really a yoke fellow is
[1:35:22] what you
[1:35:27] you're holding
[1:35:29] if you don't mind me saying it your
[1:35:30] card's so close to your chest
[1:35:34] but I tell you
[1:35:35] when the scripture said confess your
[1:35:37] faults one to another
[1:35:39] they're not talking about the chip in
[1:35:41] the paint and the hood of your pickup
[1:35:45] not talking about the fact that you made
[1:35:46] a five cent error in balancing your
[1:35:48] checkbook
[1:35:50] it's time for the body of Believers to
[1:35:52] say I go to church Lord
[1:35:55] with servants
[1:35:56] I go to church with yoke fellows I go to
[1:35:59] church where those people that their
[1:36:01] whole heart's desire is to lift the body
[1:36:04] of Christ up it's not there to cut it
[1:36:07] down it's not well if I confess what's
[1:36:09] happening in my life people won't
[1:36:10] respect me any longer not if you go to
[1:36:13] church with real Believers amen I want
[1:36:15] to go to church with real Believers amen
[1:36:18] I want the Holy Ghost as it were now
[1:36:20] this I'll sound bad and I I don't know
[1:36:22] how to say it any other way I if the if
[1:36:25] the unbeliever is coming to church with
[1:36:26] us and he's negative and he's going to
[1:36:29] look at your faults and make a deal out
[1:36:30] of it I pray somehow
[1:36:33] they get offended and leave
[1:36:37] now some of you say brother Paul that's
[1:36:38] just horrible
[1:36:40] but
[1:36:41] remember the prophet of God preached on
[1:36:44] those contrary spirits
[1:36:46] moving
[1:36:48] he speaks of it this little lady with
[1:36:51] cancer
[1:36:53] now brother Ron Spencer had put it this
[1:36:54] way that old dumb devil
[1:36:58] but look what happened the prophet of
[1:36:59] God's praying for that lady he's got
[1:37:01] cancer
[1:37:03] and that Spirit starts crying out to
[1:37:05] another spirit
[1:37:06] all it did was expose that there was
[1:37:09] another lady over here needed
[1:37:10] deliverance from this same thing
[1:37:13] if that devil had had any sense he'd
[1:37:15] abduct under the pew
[1:37:17] and and put his hands over his head and
[1:37:19] just tried to wait it out
[1:37:21] but you see his buddy because the
[1:37:23] devil's got his own yoke fella
[1:37:25] he's got his own little group
[1:37:27] brother Brown says he's got his own
[1:37:29] little church
[1:37:30] in all the officers for that church
[1:37:39] they'll turn every organization every
[1:37:41] denomination contract down turn it down
[1:37:43] done why because
[1:37:46] his sheep hear his voice
[1:37:49] amen what is God doing he's telling his
[1:37:51] joke fellow pray for this now I'm
[1:37:53] getting fixed in the clothes here sister
[1:37:55] would you just come
[1:37:57] amen
[1:37:58] you see my brother and sister there's
[1:38:00] there's something
[1:38:03] as we look at this we recognize
[1:38:10] it's a lot of voices in the messages
[1:38:12] they're not
[1:38:14] which one you're going to listen to
[1:38:21] so and so so-and-so or so and so or so
[1:38:25] and so
[1:38:28] or so and so
[1:38:30] or the word
[1:38:34] I think we ought to all get back to
[1:38:36] giving the preachers the word test
[1:38:39] oh no that's not confronting them at the
[1:38:41] back door and tell them you think you
[1:38:43] mispronounced that sister's name that
[1:38:46] the scripture that you started the
[1:38:47] service with
[1:38:49] you know I tried to look that up and
[1:38:50] there's even a deal on the computer
[1:38:52] pronounce that name and my computer
[1:38:54] froze when I typed that name in there to
[1:38:58] see if I could figure out how to
[1:38:59] pronounce it and the computer froze and
[1:39:01] just went into the pinwheel
[1:39:03] and I was like even the computer can't
[1:39:05] pronounce that name
[1:39:08] but God knows who I'm talking about
[1:39:13] you see what do we do
[1:39:15] we give the word test to the preacher
[1:39:17] like I said that's not meeting him at
[1:39:19] the back door and telling everything you
[1:39:20] didn't like
[1:39:22] that's where
[1:39:24] oh this might seem like I'm tricking you
[1:39:26] and I'll be honest out front it kind of
[1:39:28] Almost Is
[1:39:30] I'm going to give tonight the preacher
[1:39:32] the word test
[1:39:34] I'm gonna take everything he said
[1:39:38] when I get home tonight
[1:39:40] back to the word of God
[1:39:44] we'll see if he's telling the truth or
[1:39:46] not
[1:39:46] [Music]
[1:39:47] well you know what happens when people
[1:39:49] do that
[1:39:51] they come out of there invigorated and
[1:39:53] motivated and delivered and revelated
[1:39:56] and how many more words I can do the
[1:39:58] whole time they're given the preacher
[1:40:00] the word test the word is working
[1:40:03] mightily in them
[1:40:05] and you know if you've got a good Holy
[1:40:07] Ghost filled preacher you'll
[1:40:10] not find air as it were
[1:40:13] oh no let's not get to the point that
[1:40:15] pronunciation
[1:40:17] do you catch that brother Daniel he
[1:40:19] mispronounced several words the other
[1:40:21] day I just almost shut down on him
[1:40:24] I was almost like if he can't pronounce
[1:40:26] these words in the Bible correctly I'm
[1:40:29] not listening to him
[1:40:32] said no real believer ever
[1:40:35] foreign
[1:40:37] so we have this degree of tolerance as
[1:40:40] it were
[1:40:41] for the humanity
[1:40:43] but everything else has to match the
[1:40:45] word
[1:40:46] and as we dig in the word to prove
[1:40:50] it proves in us the very Life of Christ
[1:40:54] because we respond to what we study to
[1:40:57] what we read what we feed on Amen as I
[1:41:00] said before remember the old deal you
[1:41:02] know parents used to give this to us all
[1:41:04] the time you are what you eat
[1:41:07] well I'll tell you what spiritually
[1:41:09] brother and sister we are
[1:41:12] what we
[1:41:14] oh let's crave let's get a diet let's
[1:41:19] consume the word
[1:41:21] amen
[1:41:22] let's take the word you know I'm still
[1:41:24] not over brother Stevens deal let's be
[1:41:28] daringly foolish
[1:41:30] to pursue the leadership of the Holy
[1:41:33] Ghost
[1:41:35] daringly foolish to step out of our own
[1:41:37] security
[1:41:39] and accept the word of God
[1:41:42] you know Galatians
[1:41:45] 6 9 says let us not be weary and well
[1:41:48] doing for in due season we shall reap if
[1:41:51] we faint not
[1:41:52] as we have therefore opportunity and
[1:41:55] you'll find that God affords you a lot
[1:41:57] of opportunities
[1:42:00] let us do good into all men
[1:42:03] now my brother and sister that wasn't if
[1:42:05] they're related to me or they go to my
[1:42:07] church or they go to my church and I
[1:42:09] like them it was all men especially unto
[1:42:12] them who are of the household of faith
[1:42:13] oh my brother and sister how we should
[1:42:17] be lifting up
[1:42:19] supporting
[1:42:20] [Music]
[1:42:21] if not indeed in prayer those in our own
[1:42:25] assembly and those of the body of
[1:42:27] Believers around the world we should be
[1:42:29] lifting them up strengthening them
[1:42:32] not having to be reminded
[1:42:35] that there's a need somewhere
[1:42:38] not having to have it be as it were on a
[1:42:41] screen or a special deal but when we
[1:42:44] hear it I like there's some amongst us
[1:42:47] they have their prayer list
[1:42:52] it's good for us that are over a certain
[1:42:56] prescribed age
[1:42:57] to have lists
[1:42:59] if you can remember where you put them
[1:43:03] but you know I think it'd be good maybe
[1:43:05] we start our prayer list to make sure
[1:43:08] that sometimes these little needs are
[1:43:10] sister Souls
[1:43:12] our sisters in Norway that we're in that
[1:43:14] tragic wreck
[1:43:16] God by his grace and mercy
[1:43:19] uh just preserve them
[1:43:22] sometimes little things that happen just
[1:43:24] kind of slide off of our thinking Lord
[1:43:27] help us
[1:43:29] to be those fellow
[1:43:33] that are there Dependable standing
[1:43:36] lifting up praying for
[1:43:41] [Music]
[1:43:42] do you know that Galatians 6 is a
[1:43:46] unrecognized Ministry
[1:43:51] I want you to think about it Saints it's
[1:43:53] not just scripture it's a Ministry
[1:43:56] irregardless of age
[1:43:58] or gender
[1:44:00] or office
[1:44:02] this is a Ministry for all of us
[1:44:05] this is a Ministry by which we can each
[1:44:08] one Excel
[1:44:11] Hallelujah
[1:44:14] okay I have one more I'm going to skip
[1:44:16] over that right there I've got one more
[1:44:18] I just want to share with you
[1:44:20] Satan's eating this is not in my thought
[1:44:22] I just was reading have been reading
[1:44:25] Satan's Eden
[1:44:26] and I just like this thought it was a
[1:44:29] good quote I wanted to speak to you
[1:44:32] something
[1:44:33] to bring something to Enlighten you
[1:44:37] the promise of God for this age see
[1:44:40] something not something that somebody
[1:44:43] else was in some other day
[1:44:46] but something and when when them things
[1:44:48] are all right we all refer to those
[1:44:50] things
[1:44:51] but I thought I would try to bring
[1:44:53] something to your mind with these
[1:44:56] scriptures I got written here that would
[1:44:58] Enlighten you to know and make you a
[1:45:01] better soldier in the field that you're
[1:45:03] fighting in now
[1:45:06] what field you're fighting in
[1:45:07] [Music]
[1:45:09] it's the one you're in now
[1:45:13] to learn the tactics of the enemy
[1:45:16] so that you can block everything before
[1:45:18] it gets to you
[1:45:21] see that's the main thing is to learn to
[1:45:23] keep the punches off of you
[1:45:25] as much
[1:45:27] as you can
[1:45:28] I just encourage you Saints just take
[1:45:31] this I kind of pluck this out of Satan's
[1:45:33] Eden but you see we have the answer to
[1:45:37] the Satan's question we have an answer
[1:45:40] to his desire we have the answer to all
[1:45:43] these things
[1:45:44] [Music]
[1:45:46] just take the word
[1:45:48] defend yourself with the word
[1:45:51] that will cause you
[1:45:53] to become a yoke fellow
[1:45:56] because you will read in the word I
[1:45:59] respond to that and God doesn't give
[1:46:02] this to us just to give it to us he
[1:46:04] gives these things to us for purpose so
[1:46:07] take the word you get the inspiration
[1:46:09] you have someone come on your heart
[1:46:12] don't say oh that's good I'm thinking
[1:46:15] about brother or sister so and so
[1:46:18] God didn't do that for you just to let
[1:46:21] it slide away stop
[1:46:23] pray
[1:46:25] you wake up in the middle of the night I
[1:46:28] don't say this boastfully Saints but I
[1:46:30] woke up it actually led to a very very
[1:46:32] bad day on Tuesday for me I was just
[1:46:35] extremely tired I woke up at 2 15 in the
[1:46:38] morning I could not go back to sleep I
[1:46:41] hope you all don't mind that I prayed
[1:46:42] for you over and over and over again
[1:46:45] I hope that's not offensive to anyone
[1:46:48] that if I couldn't sleep I was at least
[1:46:50] going to beat the devil up while I was
[1:46:52] laying there in bed
[1:46:54] you see we have the answer
[1:46:57] but I don't believe God lets us stay
[1:46:59] awake just so we get up in the morning
[1:47:00] and say I had a bad night and I actually
[1:47:03] don't want to apologize and I said I had
[1:47:05] a bad night I actually had a really good
[1:47:06] night because I prayed from that into
[1:47:08] the valley to that end of the valley I
[1:47:10] prayed from that direction to that
[1:47:12] direction and I did my very best to
[1:47:14] cover everything in the middle
[1:47:17] because I realized if I can't sleep
[1:47:20] if I just lay here and let my mind
[1:47:22] wander I'm just wasting my life
[1:47:25] so I'm going to just make a difference
[1:47:29] let's make a difference
[1:47:30] let's be fellow
[1:47:33] yoke fellas

[1:47:54] know what God called me to go to church
[1:47:56] with these people
[1:47:58] not so they could rub me raw and make me
[1:48:01] aggravated well maybe

[2:00:02] find it comfortable to be in church with
[2:00:06] us
[2:00:07] he'll find himself with no place to hide
[2:00:10] he'll find himself a no person to hide
[2:00:13] in you know he's just talking about this
[2:00:16] the other day a little subject
[2:00:18] the prophet of God says you know if you
[2:00:20] could just look around
[2:00:22] those theaters
[2:00:24] I trust none of us have been hanging out
[2:00:26] in those kind of places
[2:00:28] the prophet of God you read that quote
[2:00:30] and you think about it you won't want to
[2:00:31] hang out there he says because those
[2:00:33] demons
[2:00:34] are hanging in the rafters and hanging
[2:00:36] along those walls
[2:00:38] those demons in there just wait to get
[2:00:41] on someone
[2:00:42] well you know what brother Paul that's a
[2:00:44] bad note to leave us leaving church now
[2:00:46] I got a good note for you the angels are
[2:00:49] here with us
[2:00:50] angels are all about us the word says
[2:00:53] they surround us wherever we go they're
[2:00:56] with us hallelujah I think I'd rather
[2:00:59] walk with the angels and walk with the
[2:01:01] Devils amen so let's just make a
[2:01:03] commitment to pray for one another walk
[2:01:06] as it were with the angels call on the
[2:01:08] Lord for the needs of this body God
