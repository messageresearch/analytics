gear for the cap god's chosen [Music] hallelujah is it good to be here tonight amen you know sometimes i hope i'm not misunderstood here but sometimes i i just simply love coming to church um kind of sounds like a little selfish motive but it it's my break from the world out here it's my break to come into the presence of god with saints of like precious faith and just just block all of that out and once again we're happy to have brother peter with us and brother oleg god bless you amen i know you probably was there on i-5 and took a wrong turn and ended up here but you and brother pavel god bless you you know i i jokingly say i like powell so much because we share a name but he's a very fine young man and tonight brother alex has as let me know that there's a little problem with the internet so we'll have scriptures but we won't have quotes and i hope that's not a deterrent we'll just have a few things once again i want to speak to you uh from the book of proverbs i age old proverbs and and i want to title it tonight if you desire wisdom and i believe every one of us here tonight desires wisdom i know that we kind of make this in a broad sense brother person sister concha uh look at the sacrifice to come so far for communion uh to stay over you know have to drive home tomorrow i believe and and uh but there's just a hunger in god's people and uh we're desiring the wisdom and it's uh as the word says it's not the wisdom of this world but we're desiring god's wisdom and we're desiring god to deal with us and so as each one of us comes and uh it's just good to see everyone not to embarrass anyone but good to see sister alice here tonight uh sister alice i will embarrass you i love you girl and uh and she's just a special girl amen and uh turning into a young lady and and uh you know it's just good to see this you know each and every one i was commenting to sister jerry the other day that it's scary to see our young people growing up so quickly we have albums or or piles and piles of pictures that need to go in an album and a lot of our children just looking through this and here here is children just little i i i just i won't i won't get sentimental here or whatever but it's just precious when you look at that and now they're growing up and it's good to see them worshiping the lord let's just stand and turn in our bibles to uh the book of proverbs the second chapter now if you go back into one of our earlier uh um wednesdays out of the book of proverbs this will be scriptures that we have already read but i want to tie together this thought about wisdom so we'll turn in proverbs the second chapter verses one through three the scripture says my son if thou wilt receive my words now that my brother and sister is the challenge of our day is for people to be able to receive the word of god to receive what is spoken it's easy enough to claim or say i'm a christian it's easy enough to say i belong to this church but it's easy enough my brother and sister to vocalize it but we have to receive it and to receive that is not just to acknowledge it exists or acknowledge that there is a general acceptance of it but to receive that you must take that in and there's where the difficulty lies if thou will receive my words and hide my commandments with thee so that thou incline thy ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding yea if thou criest after knowledge and lift us up thy voice for understanding heavenly father we ask you to come this evening lord for those who are not with us tonight lord we just send your holy spirit to be with them lead guide strengthen comfort lord and father we ask you to speak to us tonight here father as we have come together lord just to rally around the word of god not around man not around a building but you lord is why we have come asking you to speak to us in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated so as we would look at this my brother and sister i want to focus for just a moment on verse 3 there if thou criest after knowledge and lift us up thy voice for understanding these are not simple you know when the prophet of god said that we should pray for revelation my brother and sister i believe um now if i if i'm not speaking in the right context forgive me but i believe we don't put enough emphasis on that we would maybe in our prayer sometime oh lord give me some revelation but the scripture here out of the book of proverbs says that we should be crying after knowledge we should be crying for understanding and we look at this as we there's there's too much to cover this tonight but uh look at this and realize that the wisdom and how it is my brother and sister it's not just a simple little passing prayer of lord give me wisdom in this situation or or give me you know some revelation over here but it is something that should be a heart's cry it should be something that is coming from deep within us to desire to know because my brother and sister when we can make this connection and i pray i'm not trying to oversimplify it i don't want to make it sound like it's some really deep thing but when we can make the connection of knowing the mystery of god is directly connected to crying out for knowledge and wisdom and revelation because there you're telling god i want to know you now my brother and sister we can live what they call the superficial parallel life and many people do that you'll see this now sorry to bring this in a negative context but you'll see that sometimes when a marriage has failed or faltered that people will choose for the sake of the children or sake of the family name or reputation they will live parallel lives it is not a life that is connected it is not a life that is intertwined it is not a life that has a degree of intimacy but they are existing in the same house and existing under these conditions but not connected and i'm afraid sometimes my brother and sister people are living in this house in a parallel life without the intimacy of the word in their life and and it's there that we must get beyond this the simply a spirit of the day that we live in that i belong to the message our grace tabernacle is our home church that is it's not about that my brother and sister it is all about jesus christ the reason we live as it were in this house is him amen not not to come and be identified my brother and sister you know and i don't say that everyone who might use these words would fall into this category but often times uh i in the years gone by i've heard people say things like well i've been following the message for 40 years well my brother and sister they followed it for 40 years in the wilderness and they're still there come on i don't want to be a follower i want to be this message i want to be so close the mirror image of jesus christ that people would say you know what i see you now don't get the idea that we're going to suddenly wake up and we're this perfect image and never makes a mistake and never does this but people can see christ in you my brother and sister they can literally see christ in you sometimes you do business as it were maybe very simple in context and people will say things like what's different about you well i'm a extraordinary individual i'm very i'm very let me but am i very you see we don't find much in ourself to boast about we don't find much in ourself to say the reason that i'm different than this world is because i'm this this this and this the reason we're different than this world is jesus christ and christ alone isn't it beautiful and i'm not ashamed to say there's nothing extraordinary about me i'm not ashamed to say that without him i would probably be a complete failure i'm not ashamed to say that i want to be like him and i want to be different than laodicea there's nothing of laodicea out here my brother and sister that is so appealing amen now you look at this so i i just want to encourage you and i'm encouraging myself tonight i want to encourage you that we should get more serious about crying after knowledge and crying out for understanding which we're desiring as the prophet said to pray for revelation it shouldn't be superficial lord if you've got nothing else to give me give me a little revelation it ought to be something that becomes a benchmark of our prayer life to to reach out and say lord i want to know you because this my brother and sister is the revelation of the mystery which is christ in you and i and and we can't uh we can well we could oversimplify i guess could we oversimplify christ in us how could we how could we oversimplify christ in us we could sum it up by simply saying christ in me christ in me that's it there's there's no other quantifiers i don't need to have christ and my 401k christ in my investments christ in my real estate christ in my education he says there's nothing we can add to this it's christ in you the hope of glory there's what makes that benchmark difference in our life that sets us apart from the world that we live in and you know my brother and sister i um it wasn't an influence in this service tonight but i was watching a little clip and and you know it's really sad because they're interviewing young people in some of the uh very preeminent universities of the united states and these are uh you know not freshmen fresh out of high school these are are people who are graduating with very high degrees and different things and and uh it was heartbreaking to to uh listen to their response because you see they have been robotically ch uh trained they have answers to questions but the questions come from a box or a can you know there's different names that they've used in different times and places but there's a a young man a minister has went to college campuses and he's went amongst these students he himself i believe has a master's in something or other and he got saved imagine that and it's interesting because he asked these fellow students you know where are you going to go when you die oh don't tell us that stuff we know where you're going but there is no god that is what i ask you i didn't ask you whether god exists or not i ask you where are you going to go and they get nervous they start wringing their hands and they don't want to talk about it but you see my brother and sister isn't that one of the beautiful things about the gospel is it comes and it starts out with us having a very vague understanding of where we're going to go when we pass from this life and as time goes of the opening of the word our confidence is not a confidence in an intellectual understanding that there's heaven and hell it is not an intellectual understanding of the diagram of all of the universe and creation but it's a confidence that comes because this relationship is growing and we now have a confidence of who we are and where we stand and what it's all about do you realize how much of a mystery that is my brother and sister that is not just some simple thing oh yeah we go to heaven no my brother and sister the real reality as they were praying over the prayer here and stuff and it struck me and these words have struck me you see the prophet of god says when she knows who she is i'm paraphrasing it when she knows who she is she'll become an invincible army and that's what god's doing see he's giving us knowledge my brother and sister it's not textbook knowledge it's soul knowledge it is knowledge down in the depths of who we are he's giving us knowledge of who we are how precious is that that we're not just sitting here saying i'm a message believer or i'm a christian but this knowledge coming down is being poured into us and we then are stabilized by this knowledge and wisdom that has come from the revelation of the word now i don't know maybe you guys don't go through struggles maybe you don't have trials maybe problems don't come your way but to those of you that do isn't it wonderful to know that we are then stabilized by it's not this book knowledge not a carnal knowledge but a knowledge in the soul of who i am and we can then stand on that and be able to say you know what yes i i made mistakes or i had bad thoughts or or something come along but you know what i know who i am and and thank you lord for this stabilizing of this knowledge that has come for this is the revelation my brother and sister of the of the mystery of who we are in jesus christ see oftentimes if we're not careful we spend so much effort trying to validate the message and we forget that we are the message we forget the whole purpose that god come to reconcile the world to the word and the word back to the world that we're the reason he did that and so we're out here taking the message as some abstract and we're trying to validate it when we ought to just stop and say you know what i am the reason god sent a prophet in this day i am the reason the word has been opened up and revelated i'm the reason for that but you know what we all oh woe unto me woe and me i i make mistakes and i won't unto me but but but brother branham was a vindicated prophet okay that's good my brother sister you'll find that if people want to argue over his validation or vindication my brother and sister they're missing the whole point they are missing the whole purpose of the scripture they're missing the whole reason god did this because the very reason god did this a portion of is sitting right here tonight and this is the reason a revelated word come in our day to put you and i into our place that we could stand by a knowledge of the word not knowledge of intellectual meant by the knowledge of the word that we can stand because it's only in that position of standing that we are able to recognize this is where i must go and i must go forward otherwise we can go around in circles and we can struggle here and struggle there and question this and question that never gaining the full realization or revelation of what the whole thing is about wisdom and revelation are to be sought after my brother and sister not to wait till it comes now i want you to understand there is a fine line in this that we can get confused because if we take in a man's method to seek after wisdom in revelation then we will go off in an ism are you with me we'll go off and it is and we'll start taking the last one out of this quote something over here put a scripture in here come up with this and create our own thing but my brother and sister it's to be sought after and i validate that by the simple fact the prophet of god said pray for revelation first and foremost pray for revelation so he's laying a foundation for you and i to seek after this lord i don't have to just sit here now remember the prophet of god also told us if you don't understand something you don't just walk away from it you take that and set and let god answer that so sometimes we have to have patience do we know what patience is amen there are some days i think i left my patients at home and i have become the patient but god's grace and mercy it comes down does this now colossians the second chapter um we'll look at this now colossians 2 6-8 amen no okay we're good colossians 2 6-8 as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord now let me just jump back real quick i hope that i'm not jumping around too much for you but just a few verses ahead it says my son if thou will receive my words okay so it's putting out as it were we're going to say just a small question mark if thou will receive my words so what we're going to do is focus on the reception part the receiving of it verse 6 says as ye have therefore received so we went from the question mark of if you'll receive it to now speaking of we have received it can someone say thank you lord you no longer no longer looking out if we can receive this but we can stand and say thank you lord i have received the word for my hour that's beautiful isn't it as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so wonky in him very simple you've received it i would hope tonight that every one of us here and might listen to this at some point in time would be able to lift a hand and say i have received so there's our commission now you've received it start walking in it don't walk next to it don't walk before it walk behind it or be sighted my brother and sister walk in it amen don't come up with another idea of what i should do or what we should do or what the church should do or what brother branham should have done listen to a little video clip that a man made here recently and this man was talking about this very dynamic ministry of william branham and uh you know it just is very i thought wow this is a wonderful endorsement but he gets down to the end and says you know if he'd just did this and if he just did this and if he'd just did this his ministry would have been successful and i thought to myself with lettuce and i thought what what how does he describe successful exactly right but the word of god said this isn't going to be done as an open show it's not going to be a tbn special it's not going to be broadcast to the billboards and whatever the the message of the highway and byway my brother and sister is you and i we are the message to the highway and the byway we are not gonna rely on you know the the billboard on the freeway to do the work people drive by it yeah whatever another religious whatever but when they see the word they see the word walking and talking and they see the word oh but paul i make mistakes this is so cool are we allowed to use that word in church this is so cool saints when we make a mistake and god deals with us god deals with us the world don't see someone walk back in and say you know what i had the wrong attitude i want to apologize god dealt with me who dealt with you not the judge not the sheriff not this not that it was almighty god and my brother and sister that is a message that if they're willing to receive that god actually moves upon people to walk back in and apologize to strangers that's not going to be a phenomenal that oh yeah that happens to me every day no it don't work that way you see we have become we have become the billboard we have become the message of the highway and the byway hallelujah as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him now i hope you don't mind me kind of dissecting these things for a few minutes tonight but my brother and sister have you ever i know you have i'll just put it in that way i i you you're driving down the road after a big storm and there is a big beautiful tree that stood in the yard and now it's uprooted and it didn't break off at the trunk it didn't get sheared off but all of its roots have just been peeled out of the ground and all of the roots are now just standing up but if you look really careful none of the main roots no no tap root no anchor root it's just all on the surface you know what causes that too easy never had to search for moisture i got this beautiful little tree in my yard i water it every day mistake never puts a root down everything that's there you know what's happening my brother and sister we're creating rootless christians we're creating a rootless gospel oh no no we don't want you to suffer we're going to pray prosperity prosperity prosperity on you remember what we just preached this last sunday sometimes god wants you to go through the fiery trial sometimes god wants you to get shook in every way possible and you might even face this mind battle this mind game where you're like i don't even know if i'm saved i don't even know if i can go on and serve the lord oh i don't know i don't know but you see what happens is you do have roots so you can't just you know this is just a cartoon i remember from my childhood i don't know why it's just silly you know and you see the tree out there well i'm in the backyard and they're all in the front yard why do i have to be in the back i'm not going to be in the backyard anymore and in the little cartoon he just pulls his roots up goes out to the front yard no wherever god placed me amen amen lord i need roots that will stand the pressure of loudness when the hard hot winds blow i don't want to wither up and die when the laodiceans spirit becomes so powerful my brother and sister that people say oh the antichrist is here it's this it's that no my brother's sister the antichrist spirit is here but they haven't seen nothing yet rooted now remember if there's no roots there can be nothing above it that will be sustained right amen shallow roots ultimately will not support rooted and built up in him established in the faith amen i love how this scripture brings such balance you see it's not established in the church it's in the faith as you have been taught so there has to be some good teaching there had to be some preaching that causes you and i to stop and examine where we're at and you know sister jerry made a comment and i i'm not rah-rah and pat myself on the back but she made a comment she goes you know i i never looked at it quite that way uh that the reason people are offended when they're judged is because they're not judging themselves now see if we come to church and say you know what lord what the preacher said was right and i've got to deal with this and i'm asking you lord i'm putting it under the blood because i'm unworthy and that kind of an atmosphere that kind of a thing is not healthy lord it's not what a christian should be and when you've judged that and the preacher gets up to the pulpit and says you've got something you're hiding something you're holding something back you're not surrendering you don't get up and go he can't talk to me that way and the reason is because you already talked to yourself that way and you realize okay he's just reminding me what god's already spoke to me he's not picking on me it's out of the mouth of two or three witnesses in the holy spirit dealing with your heart and maybe then the preacher speaking on those things and then i've seen this happen in my own life is it okay i judge myself a little bit before you and then you'll go home and you're thinking okay you know that's more than once i i've kind of heard that lord and then you go home and you put on a tape or something and the prophet of god goes and you're like there it is there it is what are you doing you're judging yourself see so therefore you can't get offended by the preaching of the word i i just i i love these these words here in colossians um rooted and built up in him established in the face that you've been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving thank you lord for correcting me thank you lord for the fiery trials right are these not scriptural thank you lord for what's happening thank you lord that you have called me that ought to be one of our greatest thanksgivings that we give every single day is thank you lord for calling me amen but look at this now and and i i don't want to go into it but i just want to make an emphasis because i believe verse 8 is what is happening in our religious world right now in the world of christendom right now what is happening is we have too many people who are being spoiled through philosophy they're preaching all the rudiments of the gospel right right but it's there that without the life right without the life behind it right brother branham emphasized that the gospel my brother and sister is the life behind the word so without the life behind the word you can go click onto something a radio or whatever it might be and listen to somebody preach and go my that is powerful they must be listening to brother branham that's a comment sister jerry and i make to each other all the time little things here and there oh they must be listening brother branham my brother and sister they may never have listened to brother branham they're catching that anointing of the day but there is no life behind it and so what happens is they're spoiling the people through all these words of healing and deliverance and blessing and they're spoiling them in this philosophy that's empty and so then it becomes a vain deceit after the tradition of men then look at the scripture there after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world after the foundational teachings of the world can i put in my own words tonight they have conditioned them to a vain version of the word empty version of the word so they believe they have it i should have snatched onto the quote that brother jason just read me talking about why you should go to church because you're the priest why you should lead your family because you're a priest i should do all these things maybe brother jason can share that later but you see we do that because of what we are or who we are so we're not here to be spoiled isn't it nice to be spoiled though now if i was to throw a little tantrum tonight would you guys give me what i want see some of you say no but you don't know what i want what if what i said i wanted was every one of you on the altar crying out to god if that was the case yeah but you see just look at the world we live in need to cater to the church we need to fill it up we have a building program we have this program we have that program and so what they're doing is they're catering but to get the church full they have to bring them into the rudiments of the world we've got to have this and we're going to have that and we're going to have that and that and when it's all done it's not after christ amen right wow isn't that so let me just sum up this little portion as we move forward they become shallow rooted christians lord help us but i think it's happening in the message we have people that hardly know what the prophet taught but they can identify i'm a message believer my brother and sister that's not good enough the fiery hot winds of laodicea will blow you've got to re be rooted deeper than god sent a prophet amen now proverbs the 9th chapter in the tenth verse the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom so we want wisdom right i think we could all agree tonight we want wisdom so we have now the starting point to get to a place that we understand this word in the hebrew is not fear as in quaking with anxiety but it is the reverence amen so the reverence of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding now this knowledge is not as though we would learn my brother and sister in a seminary that we could go and and tie this together and tie that together i've got plenty of references in my office that tie every scripture in the bible and and ties it all together in a very complex web where you can go and say what is this word and how many other places is it used in this fashion or under this definition we can do all of that but my brother and sister in the knowledge of the holy if i can just put it to you tonight our brother put it in his prayer amen hallelujah we are the bride the wife of jesus christ now to have that knowledge we will not do that in absentee sister jerry told me the other day i've been married to you 38 years and i haven't figured you out yet and i'm like i've been married to you for 38 years and i haven't figured out near as much as you figured out now you think i'm just doing i'm making a point we've been trying what happens to the christian his relationship if he's not even trying that's right we'll never come to the knowledge and the understanding of jesus christ we have to do our homework as it were we have to put out the effort we have to study and the scripture people say well that's kind of applying to the preacher but study to show yourself approved study to know what you believe my brother and sister it's kind of sad that we can come to a place the message having been around so long in so many forms and so convenient to us and and many people and and i'll just raise my hand okay so i don't look judgmental act judgmental there's things well i don't understand it's right here in the message but you see we've chose to just sit and say amen without as it were opening the book and looking what is it i believe now i was going to title this sermon a little bit different i was going to title it if you have questions because how do you find answers for questions now we're going to just take this more in a carnal uh approach how do you find answers for questions no you don't ask siri you search for them right now what's happened this spirit now i'm not going off on this but i just want to lay this in here what's happened is this spirit is common people say well i have questions unanswered questions and i feel like my pastor failed me or this person failed me or that person failed me but what does the scripture say one it says seek ye first the kingdom of god it doesn't say seek ye a pastor or evangelist that can tell you it throws it back on us to search this out also it shows us that we have in multiple scriptures shows us that we have a responsibility to be the apt pupil we have the responsibility to be studious uh the whole scriptural type brother branham uh uh elaborates on that that his son would show himself worthy he gets good grades he studies and it comes then into adoption but if we're just going to sit and wait well i i had questions they never got answered so i i ended up just leaving i ended up just quitting because they didn't answer my questions what i'd like to do that i've never actually had the opportunity the one person actually kind of come to that basically looked at me and shut me off and walked off but are we are they is humanity actually doing their part to seek out the answer come on somebody say amen say ouch say something say time's up see the fear of the lord so we got to come to a reverence that it's not about what our church was this i want to reiterate this this is not about a relationship of you and your church and so i walked away from the church because there was nothing there my brother and sister you can't if you have a real relationship with jesus christ you can't walk away there's nowhere to go now the definition of wisdom is experience this is the brief uh definition uh experience knowledge and judgment so you must have to have wisdom you must have experience in what you're dealing with and you must attain a degree of knowledge right we can't say that we're wise in the way of whatever this is this is i like to use computers for an example because i well i can usually find the on button but i couldn't say i have wisdom when it comes to that listening to brother prashant and my son-in-law brother isaac yesterday discussing computer stuff and i actually like the conversations because then i can zone out and sit over there and go yeah yeah yeah interesting yeah can you repeat what it was well yeah you take a piece of sand or something like that and you give it some intelligence and you put it in your iphone and that what you told me brother person just like that so see you have to have experience and then you have to have knowledge but you know those two are no value at all if there's no judgment now i'm not talking about judgment as in being judged or to be sentenced right or wrong but to have judgments of when and where and how to apply this right the scripture tells us do not throw the pearl before the swine so some people will say i'm never i i've heard this saints and and you know you get distressed because there's been some poor teaching people say i never witness to people because i'm not going to throw the pearl before the swine no i'm sorry my brother sister is where you have to have knowledge you know you have to have this experience you have to do this then you have have to have judgment when someone has a real heart's desire for something of god they're not the swine but you don't go so slinging the message or slinging scripture in front of somebody who's just there to prove you wrong just there to take a scripture another scripture or something and prove you wrong so we have to have experience and knowledge and judgment now i want to hurry along here uh proverbs the 14th chapter verses 8 through 12 says the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way now this is a small h in this my brother and sister so it's not actually speaking of our lord jesus christ it's not speaking of god it's us having understanding of the way we have been called the path that we have been called now i've heard people say before well you know the lord led me here but if it had been up to me i would have done this you know what you really are in your mind you're at odds with what god has called you to do now the scripture tells us also in the book of proverbs that we should not do or serve god grudgingly so we have to accept it it's either god's will or it's not and if it's god's will then don't say i have a different mind than god has because you can't then say i have the mind of christ i have another mind but the folly of fools is deceit fools make a mock at sin now i won't repeat you know in my studies i won't repeat some of the things that i come across at this but you talk about mocking it sin is when they debase themselves and then laugh and in this one deal this very i guess the world thinks a respectable person is like well christians are prudes thank you lord amen thank you lord i'm glad i'm a prude because you see they're just fulfilling this scripture and so am i so are you amen amen so they come and they knock at sin but among the righteous there is favor the heart knoweth his own bitterness and a stranger doth not intermittal with his joy the house of the wicked shall be overthrown but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish you know i've told this story many times here in the church of brother back east uh amen you know never had much in life and then they got old he you know to take care of himself he had a whole family there that uh took you know care of their parents and um somebody talking to this brother about you know uh how that he ended up financially you know in the natural in his position and um and the brother just said well you know i just always worked it just was always god provided enough to support the family but i'm rich he was rich he had quite a few children well in my thinking had like seven eight nine children all of them serving the lord all of their spouses serving the lord all of their children serving the lord and some of their children now getting married and serving the lord would you trade that for anything i don't think so when we're young we'd say well it doesn't matter but when we get older you look out and see the legacy of god moving in your family see god doing this you realize you're rich when you get to the other side imagine as it were this is just a human interpretation of and imagine the crown that god's going to give this man that he left behind a legacy of those whose faith rose up to meet their day and their faith was sufficient and their children get these saints their children saw god in mom and dad the children saw god and grandma and grandpa the children saw god and their siblings oh my amen there's not enough money on earth to buy that you talk about being rich there is a way which seemeth right into a man but the end thereof are the ways of death now let me hurry along now look at this i don't know i don't want to act like i'm some real free thinker outside the box but have you ever thought about the fact that satan serving satan has no reward and no reward is offered amen people labor for the devil for free unless of course you place value on worldly pleasure and if we place value on that then some of these people are billionaires there's nothing that places value on that so satan has no reward has offered no reward nothing does he encourages people nothing to encourage them to live for offers the reward of the present tense now the prophet of god lays this out several different places but he said there's actually only two laws in the universe the law of life and the law of death jesus christ brings life and satan brings death and so as we look at that we just realize my brother and sister how that these things of the scripture are played out right around us but yet sometimes we just it goes by us and we don't we don't recognize it now i wish we had the quotes here but it is what it is tonight in the pool of bethesda brother brown preached this in 1950 he's speaking of man he says he destroyed himself with his gun powder if it's electric lights he pulls gases out of the earth wisdom run to and fro knowledge shall increase and they brought their self a hydrogen bomb now i don't know what they're going to do automobiles i mean look at this we're worried about a virus get this it's a lovely little fact that that one of these radio commentators brought up while we are worried about and they had these hard numbers were worried about a virus cars have continued to kill people at the same pace and no one said we must get rid of the car i'm going to vaccinate our car you see heart disease still taking its toll the flu disappeared they cured the flu when the coronas showed up but you see my brother and sister what it is is man is destroying himself now brother branham says this automobiles every time a man god destroys nothing oh here it is beautiful god destroys nothing you know saints now i want to put this maybe it doesn't apply to anyone here but maybe you'll just have it somewhere hard people will be angry at god for years for things that happened in their life angry i'm not talking about there just have a question mark angry at god i won't serve a god like that god destroys nothing man destroys himself by worldly wisdom the first conflict that ever come in the world was because somebody was seeking after worldly wisdom instead of simple faith in god my what if cain you know our lord jesus offered him the opportunity he come he couldn't help that his understanding was such that he brought every beautiful melon and and fruits and vegetables and flowers and all of this and laid it all on the altar and then when the word come to correct him he just got angry and the holy spirit if you want to put it that way because it is god right prophet of god shows us clearly it's a whole god the holy spirit comes down and deals with him and says all you have to do is just repent say lord i'm sorry i thought this was what i i was supposed to do give me revelation lord i'm going to get down and pray for revelation imagine if cain had got down on that day and prayed for revelation instead by wisdom he said my offering that offering was gross that was disgusting it was bloody and it was just horrible mind was beautiful and painless so he sought after worldly wisdom instead of simple faith so you see how that this wisdom that god's wanting to give to you and i saints there's some of you very educated i'll just speak it out i know you won't take no offense there's some of you here that are too smart for your own good but we just on sunday saw where the prophet of god says you know god saves rich men i'll make the declaration god saves really smart people but it's when we seek the wisdom of the world over simple faith in god's word that we have an impasse when we believe that we can solve the sin equation ourself you know almost like a synthetic blood our version you see isn't it interesting and i won't go in depth because there's so much in this isn't it interesting that the spirit of this age is in spirit of separation satan is coming the word of god says that it would be mother and father and son and daughter everybody against everybody but it's also the age you say how would that happen because it's the age god said come out of her my people so satan has to come and mirror that so while the bride of christ is being called out of this world and something's stirring her and she's had to make some hard decisions can any of you say amen on that they that you've come at times in your life that you've had to make decisions and there's been family members that you know thought you would lost your mind and things happen and because you have faith in your heart you've had to make the decision to just keep moving on in the word of god for this day and so god is coming and bringing separation amongst the bride but the bride is also just simply being called out of this world my brother and sister that there's a lot of pleasures now can we be honest with ourselves today there's a lot of pleasures that we as humans would enjoy but the word of god says i don't want you in the swimsuit on the beach i don't want you over here doing this i don't want you doing that now this is not a blanket law that comes from the pulpit i'm talking about the holy spirit dealing with lives i'm talking about about the holy spirit you know dealing with us that that so so you know little things that we would look at now it doesn't mean we never go swimming doesn't mean we never do these things my brother and sister we just realized god wants us to do things in a certain fashion so we do those according to what a christian would do we we don't go out and behave like the world we don't present ourselves like the world amen uh you know it it's just i i'll get my foot in my mouth if i keep going down that route but i i just want to tell you he's calling us out of the spirit of this age and there's as the scripture says there's many things that are but they are not expedient and the holy spirit's what gives us the knowledge that this is not expedient this might be you know just use my good friend brother trevor an example that that we have to be careful i might you know have a desire to do something and it's not wrong but when i do that if it cause my brother trevor issues in his life then wisdom shows me i don't do that i pull back from that because we don't want to be the detriment amen so see the world is calling the word i mean is calling the bride out of the world he's calling on her by revelation that she sees then and pulls back from those things now ephesians the first chapter verses 15 through 18 says wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers isn't that wonderful i love this paul's speaking to the ephesians here he's telling them i just heard i didn't even see it i just heard what god was doing in your life now saint you're not going to find i this sounds creepy forgive me but you're not going to find brother paul peeping in the windows of your house you know like is this family doing right is this family doing right are they doing right are they going to do no because i have much more confidence in you and i have that much more confidence in the holy spirit that as sons and daughters of god the holy spirit leading us and as the reports i want to put it this way as the reports of what god is doing comes back i praise god and i stand upon that i hear of your faith i hear of prayers that were prayed and prayers that are answered and decisions that i would if i would come i would say don't do that don't do this don't do but see it's not my job i'm not a dictator and so you know you go and you pray and then you hear well we decided to do this and you know that was the holy spirit leading that individual leading that family and we praise god we hear of that and so we cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in our prayers i try to practice this scripture right here i try to practice this right here that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you and this right here i got so excited i've read this scripture so many times but it hit me today just today at noon time as i was trying to finish up this it may give unto you wisdom spirit spirit hallelujah the holy ghost coming down and it's not just some kind of wisdom i can do this i've got wisdom to do this but it's the spirit of almighty god stirring the hearts of sons and daughters of god giving us wisdom the right words to say the right time and the right things and and it's there that the holy spirit moves down and it says you know as the scripture says that that don't even try to find your own words don't even try to find your own way just let god move upon you this is the spirit of wisdom god dealing with us how it can be that you can be going and somebody you know that just is not religious at all but one day something comes and you just make a statement to them and then they pour their heart out well we've got this issue in our family there's this disease there's this happen will you pray for us well that doesn't come from just us we don't have oh i'm just so smart i figured this out what is it it's a spirit of wisdom god coming down saying just say these words but he doesn't come down and say now i would just want you to say these words you just feel are you with me you just feel overpowered i've got to speak to him i don't even know why they're not religious they don't care but something inside of you so speak and many times they come afterwards and say my wife my child brother-in-law sister-in-law mom dad whatever we got better yeah thank you for praying you can't buy that kind of influence you can't buy that kind of testimony but the spirit of wisdom coming upon you can lead us to present jesus christ to this world in that fashion hallelujah i hope i'm not too intense for you tonight hallelujah may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him my brother and sister to me that encapsulates that whole idea right there it is just right there we need the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him hallelujah to be able to look in our bible why does the world this is homework i could give you go online my brother and sister and search out scriptures and look at how many of the key scriptures that people write into these forums and say i read this over and over and over and over again and i don't understand and then the forum whatever you call them the form master guy he says oh this is what that means and you're like no it doesn't how do you know the answer because the spirit of wisdom and knowledge and revelation has fallen on you you see if it was just simply an explanation we could just get a tape of the prophet or a book of the prophet just give it to him and they'd have the answer it doesn't work that way does it you could tell them go read that scripture 50 times it'll come to you but if 50 times it still hasn't come to them are you with me tonight it's the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him has fallen on you god's gift to you tonight today amen that we could come in the riches oh the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance is in the saints oh my i just love that scripture you see there's lots of spirits out here saints i walked in the story the other day and i won't mention nothing because there's some parents here that slap me silly and i shouldn't anyhow i walked in a store the other day song i haven't thought of in the eon of time and it's playing on the radio and that little spirit stirs you and the words to a song that you think you've forgotten are you with me but there's a spirit an anointing with that the prophet of god says anointing on music and that spirit comes down [Music] because there's a spirit an anointing there now do you think that's by accident i don't think so i think the devil knows how to set a snare lots of spirits but the word of god tells us to cry out for the spirit of wisdom and revelation will you do that i just ask you saints will you do that will you just put that in it directly in a prayer in your prayers lord i'm crying out i'm seeking lord i'm desiring to have the spirit of wisdom in revelation hallelujah now in god's only provided place of worship um brother brown says here listen 11 28 65 saints now i'm not a date person i know i've had people tell me before well if it's before 63 or if it's here or if there we don't well i'm sorry i i believe these things you know god corrected him good example brother branham you know dealing with the horse riders you know thought the white horse holy spirits and different things like that god corrected them but my brother and sister i don't believe uh that uh you know what was preached before 1960 or before 1956 has any less value than those things preached afterwards that's just how i feel about it i have had people look me in the face and say well the quote you read uh was before this certain date so therefore we don't feel like it's valid well you just don't feel like it's valid i think it's valid amen so if we're going to get really valid 11 28 65 ought to be about as valid as it gets now if in the human heart there's a longing like methodist baptist presbyterian catholic all these others trying to find that one true way and they're told by their priests and pastors and so forth that this is the true way okay can i put some rubber on the road is that not what we do we're here preaching this is the way this message is the way it's what we preach so this applies to us they say the priest says there's no salvation outside the catholic church well each church takes his their own idea some of them won't admit it but they just do it by their action um is this still applying to us in this day your action speaks louder than your word it's just in other words they're just more of a this is rough isn't it this can't be right because our prophet's just kind of like grandfather and he's always kind and he's not going to skin us because we believe the message boy you guys are just they're just more of a hypocrite than the catholic is ouch ouch let's practice that ouch the catholic confesses it right out i believe that this is the only thing but they won't do that they hide it but their actions prove what they're thinking see well i'll tell you what the word of god says whatever is done in secret will be made open so this right here that when people have actions and they're really trying to steer people in a certain direction but they'll never come out and say it they'll never come out well saints i'm not going to toot my horn but i'll tell you this but i believe of this message has been preached to you from this pulpit over and over and over and over again and i would say if i have ever put something that was a seed or something in there that wasn't correct i would pray that somebody would say brother paul that that didn't that didn't ring that wasn't what the prophet said that's not what the scripture says because you see the only way we can come and truly be ministers of the gospel is to approach this as a eunuch and that is we have nothing to put in ourselves we have nothing to gain we are just here to do what god called us to do because you see if we hide it sooner or later our actions will betray it and then why would we waste our time is that too blunt to put it that way why would we waste our time now there's got to be then one place because there is a desire in the human heart to find it and i think the word of god has now listen careful saints i think and uh le can i amend this section of this quote before i even read it amen hallelujah and i think that the word of god has the answer for everything that we have need of so god has the answer and let's search for it now in the scripture then if god would show us by the scriptures the only place the only ground the only oh look how brother brown throws us in the only denomination if it's so the only way that god will meet a man then we should hold to that because we found the truth of the bible what it says so he throws this denomination in there my brother and sister in such a fashion you word it any way you want this is the way i read it you just go ahead and you word it any way you want but god's got one place where he has placed his word one place it's not over here have you ever noticed i hope this don't hurt anybody's feelings but have you ever noticed that the pros can use certain quotes and the cons use the same quote now that's kind of hard to figure out who's right or is it hard no sir we take this interpretation of quote we take this interpretation of a quote and we run it through the filter and you'll know which one is correct i'm going to close sister emmy if you would come saints i have a prayer request i have to laugh just thinking about what brother chris preached that night now these message deals you know we do this and we got an unspoken prayer request so i'm i'm going to make this one a spoken prayer request so i don't have to judge myself by what brother chris preached that day and i say that in humor nobody get bent out of shape i'm going to place a prayer request before you as a church pray for me that i will have the spirit of wisdom and revelation and i will pray for you that you will have the spirit of wisdom and revelation now if we as a body of believers are praying for one another not selfishly right not ever just putting ourself up there lord give me but we will take the time and the effort to to pray this through the lord give wisdom and revelation to my brother my sister going right through the church amen i like this how it works you can pray for north of the freeway and then you can pray for south of the freeway and you can play for west of here and west or east of there and then you can cover the whole church without forgetting a single individual and pray for the spirit of wisdom and revelation and if we'll do that my brother and sister god says that he will give us the desires of our heart and we as a church will have the spirit of wisdom and revelation amen you love the lord tonight i don't know why we preachers say that because i know you do but you know it's just a beautiful thing when you realize my brother and sister just exactly what god's doing because he says right here in this quote because there is a desire in the human heart to find it you are no different i am no different we have a desire to find the truth of god's word in this hour and he promised you know this one of the things that many years ago when i was struggling my own my own experience you know it i i just have to say it it can be hard when you're raised in the message and then you backslide the word of god says you you're actually very fortunate that god would call you back [Music] [Applause] but i used to hold to this [Music] because i did have an experience when i was a teenager i held to that this work [Music] oh my brother and sister we're coming right down to the days the scripture is just being fulfilled so fast before us we don't say this out of fear we say it out of the realization that these things are happening it's here this is the season this is the time the scripture told us about [Music] but we must recognize he put the desire in you we didn't put it but he himself and he says this work this desire this thirst i put in you look at this is it okay if i interpret the scripture to you this way tonight this this thirst this desire that i put in you i will come along and satisfy i will be the one that will pour it out and bring satisfaction and peace and joy and love and hope in your life i will make you complete oh isn't that so beautiful my brother and sister god help us all lord help brother paul amen that just we can just stop sometimes and just calm our spirit and say you know what lord i just need you to pour a little something in right now i need you to just pour a little bit of the calming effect of your holy spirit into my life right now lord i just feel a little unsettled do you ever feel that way i think some of us you know maybe a little more high anxiety than others lord help us those of us that get all wound up and think that my old bushy tail would have fallen off by now as many times as i ring that thing up in a knot but we got to stop and then say you know what lord you're in control you're the answer nothing here in this world is the answer hallelujah hallelujah open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see you [Music] open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my home i want to see you i want to see you [Music] to see you high and lift it up o shining in the light of your glory [Music] pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy [Music] holy holy holy [Music] i want to see you let's stand and sing the song again oh come on brother jay help me stop my heart lord open the eyes of my hall of paul's heart lord i want to see you i want to see you [Music] let this be our prayer oh lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see you to see you hide and lifted up oh shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy [Music] holy holy holy holy holy holy [Music] holy holy holy i want to see you can we just lift a hand and say lord that's my heart's desire tonight lord just pour out a spirit father upon us lord a spirit of wisdom father and lord a spirit of revelation father that we be able in the hour that we live in father lord you said that the mystery would be complete now lord we believe what your word says and father that means lord that there's many things in the word of god that would have to be revealed by you to your bride no one else is going to reveal it no preacher no theologian you lord lord let us remember [Music] the prophet of god refers to cain instead of taking simple faith he tried to find it in his own wisdom lord we want your wisdom we want your revelations father let us express it from our hearts to you and have confidence lord that you will come and answer according to thy word hallelujah [Music] blessed of glory [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh this is my story oh this is my song i praising my savior on the day long oh this is my story oh this is my song i am praising myself all the day long and perfect sunday [Music]

inside that is that's mission god help us can i lift my hands before you without it looking weird and say lord help me with my submission factor help me lord that day by day that i would just be able to just submit not let this all flesh my thinking my emotions my feelings my complex rise up lord i can just submit it to you [Music] and then just rest because you know what i want to be happy you ever had that feeling some of you are very mentally solid but some of us aren't oh that sounded strange didn't it some of us are always saints i'll just admit to you i've spent my whole life from a little boy wondering what i was missing maybe something i'm missing that's why my whole life have thrown myself i did things i did them in extreme because i thought that might satisfy something missing that i'm coming to realize it's all right here perfect submission being able to stand and know that's all at rest know that i can be happy in my savior i can watch and i can wait and i can look above and i can be filled with his goodness and i can be lost in his love o heavenly father lord i pray tonight father you just come you know my heart you know my desire lord i just pray you'd
