me up hallelujah amen well this morning we just have a little things that we want to share brother david and sister diane have driven up to sandpoint be up there with a little group of believers there and i think brother emanuel from bcf is is up there preaching and uh one of these days we'll have brother emmanuel here he's a very fine brother very devoted to the word of god so we just want to pray for them they have a lovely time this morning uh brother rohr sister mona you know that visited us here really recently their little group their little family group up there so we want to just uh ask god's blessing upon their service today we want to welcome brother isaac's cousin sister elizabeth tallrud amen the beautiful young lady in the back for those of you don't know so she's just here kind of helping out with the family during the harvest time so god bless you and i pray you have a good visit here amongst the uncivilized amen and then we this morning miss our brother chris sister kristen but we get to welcome little ali rose grace amen and to the congregation a little six pound eleven and a half ounce uh my you know what that size uh now hope nobody misunderstands not offensive you know after uh little sammy was born and we have this little giant in our midst we go over there to hold little alley rose and it's like my what are we gonna do with this little kid but she's sure a cutie she's got just a beautiful smile and we thank the lord for a healthy baby healthy and easy delivery amen so just remember our sister kristen uh still you know just a little blood pressure issue coming but we believe it's overcome already conquered in the name of jesus christ amen so we just stand upon that amen well let's just stand for the reading of the word this morning i want to once again just speak to you on redemption's manifestation my brother and sister we have received the greatest gift come on we have received the greatest gift that has been given to mankind and that is jesus christ himself in our midst amen he said i'll be with you even in you and you know we as humans and i've done this many times and i ask you definitely forgive me if i've said something before and didn't follow through but as humans it's easy for us to say you know what i'll do this or all that and then you entirely forget about it it's something you really did mean but it slips away from you but our lord jesus he didn't forget a thing he made a promise to you he said i will keep that promise and he will amen now you know maybe this morning maybe you just uh humor me if you would call that and just repeat after me uh the phrase and i think it's good for us to confess from our lips my prayer makes a difference amen i believe we have to believe that or else pretty soon we'll just simply give up on our prayers amen but my prayer makes a difference the word of god said it would and i believe the word so i just confess to the world today my prayer makes a difference amen i want to speak to you this morning on the two vines and two attractions and as we'll look in the word of god today i trust it will be a blessing uh to you now i want to just jump over here real quick to just remind you a little bit of where we're at we're looking my brother and sister at this and it'll take us i think probably a year so we might be like brother donnie and have part 275 but you look at this and realize my brother and sister in this pattern here we have to a lesser degree but we have two vines we have two attractions amen you'll notice as i've said before on both sides someone is sold out anybody sold out this morning amen so to be sold out amen but look the troubled ground if you would call it i i'm not so concerned as it were i mean we want to preach the gospel we don't know who is and who isn't but we're talking about those that are completely sold out i'm not so concerned about those who are sold out to satan amen my brother and sister and i'm not so concerned about those who are sold out to jesus christ where we really labor is to convince by the gospel right the preaching of the word that person that's in that middle ground in that troubled place where satan's really drawing them now it does not exempt us as being sold out from all the challenges of life are you with me you'll be sold out i'm i'm not gonna as long as there's breath in this body i will serve the lord that doesn't mean satan's not gonna come when you're down in the scripture as it says and the song says in the valley of despair satan's going to come and tell you see i told you so see i told you so but we have a response for that if we'll remember and that is it is written it is written i'm going to stick with the written word so we look at this and as we're looking at the two vines and the two attractions you'll find that there is always something that satan would make his world right satan's eden attractive he's got something whether it's a music you know i i find this ironic i'm thank the lord that i've overcome it but you know when i was a young man backslid from from you know being raised up in the message listening to the music that i listened to uh it was very attractive to me i was just walking in a store the other day and one of the songs from my youth it was what i used to call one of my favorite songs i was playing on the radio and you know instead of like getting into that something spoke to me and said look at that you used to be attracted to that but you see god comes and he breaks that attraction amen now bear with me okay this morning he doesn't break that attraction by telling you you're going to hell if you listen to that you're going to hell if you listen to that you're going to hell if you listen to that how he breaks that attraction is he places something more attractive in front of you you see you will be drawn to whatever is most attractive to you so god doesn't come by his word and say you know what i'm just going to condemn you over and over again until you quit that now what he does is he places something more attractive and what's down inside your soul responds to that attraction now let's just go in the word you know because sometimes things in life you know we have to get the right context to get the right answer amen romans the seventh chapter quite lengthy scripture we'll read a portion of it and allow you to be seated now here we're looking at paul speaking to the romans and i believe all of us relate to these scriptures here i relate to the context of it uh for it's very much enlightening to the battle you might say to the condition of humanity romans 7 and 9 for i was alive without the law once now let me just interject this this is a man who knows nothing about god come on you see without the presence of god in our life this world out here seems perfectly normal for i was alive once for i was alive without the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and i died and the commandment which was ordained to life i found to be unto death in other words he recognized he was lost for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me whereof the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but sin that it might appear sin worketh death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become sinful boy that's a paradoxical statement right there for we know that the law is spiritual and i am carnal sold under sin amen for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me now this is a revelation right there in itself saints because the devil would try to tell you you you made a mistake you did something said something thought something that that's who you are but the apostle paul brings us a revelation he brings us a clarity here amen it's sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man can someone say amen to that but i see another law and my members warring against the law of my mind bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death look that very next verse oh i find it powerful i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin you say how can you rejoice in that because my brother and sister as a prophet of god showed us very clearly god looks down into the heart remember those quotes we shared the other day he looks down into the heart it wasn't the man with the ability it was the man with the heart and that's what it was he said about david he's a man after my own heart hallelujah heavenly father we ask for blessings upon your word today ask lord that you would just come and speak to us we pray for those who are not able to be with us today lord we just ask you to touch them our sister sue with family lord brother chris and christian with their baby brother dave and diane traveling and those that i might have missed today lord just thinking about brother manasseh off to university and father ask you to be with him lord for your guiding hand upon each one in the name of jesus christ we ask amen you may be seated you know i think if we have a true revelation of these scriptures here that it goes a long ways in the in the battle of our mind amen that that will recognize that just because we make a mistake a situation in our life uh that that is not the real us amen now these are not to be used as an excuse this is not something like a gold mass go collect 200 but it's something my brother and sister that we can hold in our heart and recognize that when we come to a place that we come short or we stumble that that doesn't mean that we are not a son or daughter of god it does not mean that we have fallen from god's grace and i'm going to take this into a just a little short avenue for just a moment that uh we'll touch on again maybe later but i want to lay this groundwork this morning that you actually should be thankful for sin in your life now that seems like a paradox doesn't it why would brother paul say that because my brother and sister without sin in your life you would not recognize the enormity of god's grace and love for you amen if we were all just perfect little beings we would never comprehend what our lord jesus has done for us and so when we uh have uh you might say come in contact with the depravity of sin and recognize that we are lost my brother and sister then that gives us a very clear picture of the enormous incredible beautiful grace of god uh the blood shed at calvary for you and i amen actually said shed before the foundation of the world it gives us a very clear picture truly of what god has done for us now this is not for us to go out and be partakers of sin so that we might know a greater depth of god's grace i think most of us have faced enough sin to recognize that god's been very good to us amen now as we are taking our thought this morning i just want to uh just come and give you the definition of um the attraction amen attraction is something interesting or enjoyable that people want to visit see or do the act a process or power of attracting to offer something of interest something that attracts or is intended to attract people by appealing to their desires and tastes amen so you look at this and realize that in the world we are living in today the two vines have two diametrically opposed attractions to them but yet they're not really all that different my brother and sister you know uh mankind they like a good rallying speech you know kind of uh you can do this kind of a speech you know and not to speak ill of of these companies but you know companies like say amway and some of these others have really tapped into that where where you'll have these dynamic speakers a conference full of people and they basically walk out of those conferences and they believe they could sell amway to a lamppost amen they are so convinced that everybody needs amway so you see it's not just something that uh come to church it is actually something that reaches into the very nature or desire of mankind and and everybody wants to be encouraged everyone wants to be accomplished and so as we'll look at that today uh we look at these two sides these two vines these two attractions we'll see that uh sometimes you say well you know sometimes we go to church and it seems like the preacher doesn't preach much different than the service he preached last week but yet we walk away from the house of god uh revived we we walk away encouraged and feeling empowered because something inside of us is attracted to the word of god and so as the word comes forth we don't say hey i've heard that before we say amen amen because it is real and we can hear the word of god preached over and over again now my brother and sister there's some contrary spirits in the land that say well we've heard enough of the word what we need to do now is just worship my brother and sister that's not what the prophet of god told us amen the word of god has preeminence to the believer amen praise and worship are part of it we want to give a full measure but my brother and sister it's the word that we are after amen that's the priority and when we break this all down and realize as the prophet gives us a very clear picture that man i think uh knew but didn't really express so much remember this written word is just god on paper amen so when you are attracted to the preaching of the word you are actually attracted to god amen it's not just something that we read the bible talked a few minutes went home no you can honestly say we went to church we were in the presence of god amen and and then we went home amen now if you don't believe so we live in a different age although it's probably still kind of the same or at least seems the same to a younger generation but when sister jerry and i were courting i wrote her box full of letters amen and not just one here not just one there that was our principle way of communicating and the letters i received from her now i hope you don't think this is weird but take it back to what the prophet of god said about the word of god when she would write me a letter what she was expressing is i was reading between the lines especially when there was more and more commitment between us a reading between the lines that letter my brother and sister was her what it expressed was her amen and when we have the written word of god that's god expressing himself to us you know when the prophet of god said you need to read your bible every day you know what he was telling you you need to come over here and enter into the presence of your bridegroom every day because when you read that word anointed with the holy ghost that's god in your presence hallelujah thank you lord that we can have uh partakers kind of like our love letter amen so you look at this and realize what god is doing is he's coming down and there's these attractions in the world and this is why i've often preached that you can do almost anything on earth and still serve god a hundred percent you say well brother paul i i don't know some churches say we just can't do this and can't do that i'm sorry i'm just expressing my own personal feelings like that you want to fly the airplane fly it if you want to jump out of the airplane jump out of it you can do that and serve god amen but if we come and find that our attractions start to pull us away from the presence of god then we need to become cognizant of what our attraction is doing and so we move forward my brother and sister uh recognizing that these two spirits in the framework of the church they have this diametrically opposed but yet you would find that the characteristics or the similarities are incredible amen you'll find that people are devoted faithful they are the caught up in and give time money energy uh on both sides of this amen and so you'll see that these two spirits in the lives of god's people is the warfare that the prophet of god was talking about that satan is here trying to tug you one direction and the spirit of god now look at the difference that satan satan will manhandle you but god is a gentleman satan will trick you god will woo you now i tell you what no man would ever want to say well this is my beautiful wife i tricked her into marrying me what you want to be able to do is say you know what this beautiful lady right here i wooed her yeah i'm all rugged and got scars on my face and not too good to look at but i i wooed her i i i reached down something into her life and i touched a vein of something that that moved her to the place that she said you know he might not be much to look at right the scripture said our lord jesus wasn't much to look at right but do you look at that and say you know what he's the one that cares for me he's the one that it will will watch out for me and support me and and hold me close doesn't have to be something good to look at amen reminds me of a sister new years ago she had an apron she said don't marry for looks looks don't last cooking does and so you know my brother and sister there's a lot more to life you know than than just looks amen hallelujah oh if y'all don't mind me being a little humorous i actually used to be kind of pretty good looking too or at least i thought i was amen so these two spirits in the framework of the church amen the two spirits that are warring in the life of god's people my brother and sister paul uh was speaking here in the scripture and brother branham draws from this amen paul speaking of the greatest battle ever fought was this warfare that goes on when a man or a woman doing their best to serve god and other spirits coming i try to do good and i find that when i do good evil is present with me you think i'm trying to do god a service here i'm trying to serve him why can't we get rid of that my brother and sister that spirit is there he has access you know just like it was with job god said you can do anything you want to him but don't take his life now you talk about that my god just threw job out to the wolves no my brother and sister that's not what god's plan was god was so supremely confident in his relationship with job that he said you can do anything you want he won't quit oh i want to be that kind of man amen you say oh paul you might be asking for great trials or sickness or or things coming i don't care if god would express he had that kind of confidence in me i will stand hallelujah not got any give in me amen not me give in you hallelujah amen so you see this coming forth this greatest battle ever fought and certainly in the day that we live in my brother and sister you'll see things like gospel music amen they'll come along they use the name of jesus they they talk about that many of those songs oh if you listen they have zero content they're not there to to stir your soul you know repetitiously he loved me he loved me my brother and sister who's the he they're talking about amen for the word of god says if you love him you'll do his commandments and so it's not just that he loved you where's the love you're returning back not a one-sided relationship not a one-sided marriage or one-sided friendship but you see for a man and a woman to have a successful marriage or relationship they have to both give and they have to both love and return that love amen so it's not about what god done for us my brother and sister part of this equation as a prophet of god now excuse me this wasn't part of my thoughts today but as the prophet of god said he's one half i read you the quote here the other day he's one half this bride of christ makes up the other half they have to come together you can't just say well we're the bride of christ well where's your bridegroom i don't know and i don't care no you have to be joined to him to make the complete picture amen and so god moving in this now i want to just lay this little groundwork my brother and sister why it comes that we say well you know uh we're all message people we're all believers you know why do you preach about sin and why do you preach about this well my brother and sister because it's ever present it's a battle that we all must face because you see sin even comes down to just simple doubt is a sin amen now if sin is not recognized it is never resolved so if we just simply have fear in us fear of tomorrow or fear of a doctor's diagnosis or whatever it might be if we have fear in us and we decide that fear is perfectly normal then i can operate you know nervous in the night nervous in the day because of this diagnosis or these words my brother and sister people declare that's normal well i'm just human i talked to an individual just a few days ago well i feel that way but that's normal i'm a human well i'm sorry i'm going to take an entirely different position my prayer changes things amen my prayer makes a difference amen the prophet of god said whatever you confess is what is going to ultimately come upon you the bible says what you fear will come upon you amen so what do we do we come to the place we stand upon the word of god and i recognize i have a fear i shouldn't have god's my comforter he's my provider he's my refuge he's everything to me i have no reason to fear amen you realize the word of god god will never take you somewhere he won't keep you amen so you look at that that sin unrecognized is never resolved and satan's desire is to keep man that he would never know so if he thinks this world out here drinking dancing drugs is normal and no one ever testifies that it's not oh my you see my brother and sister you have to recognize your shortcoming to recognize the grace of god that's why as church we don't hide it all under the under the bench and say well we're all making a rapture we believe the message we believe the message we're all making a rapture praise the lord no we need to recognize our shortcoming but our shortcoming doesn't rule us amen the grace of god comes down and we lay it on the altar and we put it under the blood and it's finished and we can walk away with a liberty amen hallelujah now i want to just go into the sermon thirst brother brown says in this the age of high breeding hybriding and they even have got the churches today till they're hybrid that's right they get in here they just go to church it's a lodge instead of a church a church is a place where people come together and worship god in spirit and in truth so there is our worship and the word right there amen and today it's a lodge we go there and have a little time shake hands and fellowship some black coffee in the back of the building and go home till next week we've done our religious duty now it's a perverted age and satan is perverting these thirsts that god put in some church goers no you let's bring it down personal accountability he put that thirst in me he put that thirst in you amen don't go looking behind you well brother so-and-so could probably listen to this he needs a little more hallelujah maybe raise your fork instead of throwing it put it up so somebody does throw it over their shoulder you can catch it hallelujah well praise the lord amen the word of god tells us judgment comes before blessing so lord judge me because i want blessed amen so you look at this satan's perverting these thirsts that god put in you to thirst satan is perverting them now if you want to know the right now brother brown kind of is he's juggled right there i think you look at that he's kind of pausing he's going to say one thing he says another kind of he says you want to know the right perversion if you you women want to be pretty oh my we're going to put a little rubber on the road here this morning now how many of you sisters want to be pretty some of you never raised your hand oh my goodness you know what the opposite of pretty is maybe i should put it this way get a counterbalance answer out of you how many of you sisters want to be ugly none of you raised your hand so i'm assuming you just didn't lift your hand before and is that safe to say come on saints come on we're not dead we're alive here this morning amen now the women wants to be pretty take first timothy 2 9 that's the adorning themselves in modest apparel apparel with a christ-like spirit meek subject to their husbands boy this would just get some angry excuse me i'll cough so that will hide that for some of you and so forth that's the way that you should be adorned your life you live right now look my brother and sister often times people would think and i've encountered them that you start talking about a wife being subject to her husband and they feel like you're meddling but you know what i would say that every daughter of god would want to find that right balance amen and she would want her husband to find that right balance because the husband should be there lifting her up as it were now the prophet of god said every man should respect his wife he should honor her but he said when we come now i'm paraphrasing this when we come to the place we worship the woman then we are reflecting the spirit of the day yes sir reminds me of a brother one time was sharon with me he says you know brother he said we have a sister in our church and the brother was just speaking straight on us he says she is the ugliest woman i've ever seen in my life what's that brother the ugliest woman i've ever seen in my life she comes from hillbilly stalk she's got a great big hook nose her ears point straight out her teeth point every which direction and she's the most beautiful sister you've ever seen did you follow that you see the problem is we're looking to the natural when we needed to look to the spiritual because in the flesh she was just some hillbilly stalk you know rough looking girl amen but as a daughter of god she's the most beautiful sister now i want to ask you which one would you want to be the most beautiful woman on earth and go to hell or be that one with them snaggle teeth as the same brother said she could eat watermelon through a picket fence now my brother and sister the thing is she's a prayer warrior he was just making the point i'll never probably ever meet this sister but he's making a point that people look on the outside but the inside is really what a christian sees because there is the life of christ someone that is living is sold out is not concerned she's not gonna have to go get braces now if you got them no problem i'm not speaking on that but you don't have to go get braces and don't have to go get her ears pinned and she doesn't have to do this and doesn't have to do that so it look good my brother and sister she recognized by revelation that she could adorn herself with a christ-like spirit and that would then overpower anything of this flesh now remember god made her just like she was she's not an accident this church of god does not have to be i should go get this advertisement i just shared it with brother jason it come from some pin company how that we can come if we want to raise the prestige of our church we can give away their ink pens if we want to increase the attendance we can give ink pens as gifts to attract people to come to church if we want our image in the neighborhood to be gathered we could go from house to house giving away their ink pens hallelujah my brother and sister that's not what it's about we're to adorn herself and this is not for sisters only this is for us we are the bride of christ to adorn herself with a christ-like spirit amen you should that's the way you want to should be adorned your life you live amen because here it is the very nature of god is what the world will actually remember when it's all finished amen your neighbor is going to know you but what kind of a christian you were not by what kind of car you drove amen he perverts the true nature of god the true thirst of god of the body and soul by lust for sin sin a perversion now we find out a person today the way they've took that perversion thirst for god thirst for to be pretty and all these thirsts for for water they've turned into satisfying that with drinking the thirst for joy everybody wants to have joy can we say amen thirst for fellowship all these great thirsts that god has put into us that we might thirst after him god made you to thirst after him and we try to satisfy it with some other kind of thirst amen i want to liken this to you this morning to attractions right you go out here well we got to get the latest fashion we got to this we got to have the latest of this that and the other we've got to be seen with this or seen with that let the world know we have something my brother and sister that won't satisfy amen it's god in that place he didn't put it for us to satisfy something that we just have to have he wants us to have that same desire for him oh my god made you thirst after him we try to satisfy it with some other kind of thirst some other kind of a perversion of the correct thirst see how it's in the natural see how it's in the spiritual we think as long as we join church that settles that's all we have to do well that is absolutely wrong no god wants you to thirst for him and as a heart panteth for the water brook my soul thirsts after thee o god see see amen now listen i like this right here i i this kind of it's got a little humor i guess to me in it he said now if that deer was panting for the water brook what if somebody come along another buddy dear hey buddy what are you doing over there do you realize that you don't have to live this is okay right here buddy dear let me share a secret with you let's do some things together it was a buddy dear as a young married man that got me to go into a pool house on friday nights and shoot and pool to the wee hours of the morning a buddy deer yeah oh dear what a buddy yeah another buddy dear could come along and say say i'll tell you what i i could do i know where there is a mud hole down here come on well the deer wouldn't want that i wouldn't do any good hallelujah but that old buddy deer my i don't know if you guys really i should confess this much but there used to be a place with some pretty good pool tables in the city of caldwell called the watering hole but really what it was was a mud hole and a buddy deer said hey paul come shoot pool with us who's us well the rest of the young men in the church come on saints not one rose up and said whoa what are we doing we're christians we all snuggled up close to our buddy deer and went down to the watering hole ironic isn't it saints that the watering hole is really a mud hole full all kinds of pollywogs stomped into whatever well the deer wouldn't want that wouldn't do him any good and there's nothing can satisfy that thirst that's in the human being until god comes in oh can we say thank you lord this morning when that thirst is there and you're longing and it draws us in different directions the lust of the flesh and the lust and pride of life it draws us off into all kinds of things but when god comes in he must have it or die and no person has a right to try to hush or satisfy that holy thirst that's in him by the things of the world no sir it's ungodly to do so and if you thirst for god don't shake hands with the preacher and put your name on the book if you're thirsting for god there's only one thing to satisfy it that's meet god and if you're thirsting for god that's the only way you could meet him is to do that amen no substitute i don't care saints i'm going to be a little blunt i don't care that you identify completely with the message you've got the pictures on the wall you've got the right books you wear whatever if we are satisfying that thirst in us with any other thing then the word of god amen god himself right in the word amen any other substitution the prophet of god just said right here that's ungodly i don't believe any one of us here this morning would say well i'm going to be ungodly no but we will allow things to creep into our life that draw us away from the word of god and draw us away from what god has called us to now i want to just look here now you all a little quiet this morning that's okay that's fine amen but i just want to just want to lay this out to you because you see saints for us to truly rejoice in the word of god you've got to have liberty amen you've got to be broken free from the shackle as i've told you before there's no way you're going to go down there and put your ear on the post let them drive that all in your ear and be satisfied the rest of your life you were called to have the freedom the liberty of god to have the holy ghost in abundance amen not just to live a life that goes from service to service and weak to weak hoping that someday you'll find a deliverance that god has called us to a liberty he said who i have set free is partially free no he is free indeed amen don't let these little things creep in don't let these little foxes as it were come in and spoil your vine amen now brother branham says here in the message life he said a brother was testifying to me this morning he was called to the ministry when a little boy and then he fell and he said and he said uh but then he came back with more of a call to preach than ever before that's beautiful you see what it was when he became a christian he got in the wrong environment see and that environment influenced him see and you just keep holding around with that kind of environment you see it it influences you i hope you're reading between the lines of what i'm saying oh saints look i i just want to be straightforward with you you might not leave with a smile today but you'll leave with the word ringing in your ears amen you come to the point my brother and sister you've got to read between the lines sometimes you got to know what god's telling you and the environment that you're living in you say well i don't hang out in the world i don't hang out anywhere but if the environment you're hanging in is not bringing you to the cross not bringing you to calvary not bringing you back to the word of god undiluted i i don't know you know sometimes i just get on a bender and forgive me i'm just human but my brother and sister i just everything i read everything that's happening my dear wife sending me 300 quotes a day everything is just coming out and over and over again i keep hearing the prophet of god saying just one word don't let them come with one word different don't change one word don't believe one word different my brother and sister the bible he what is he doing he's reiterating it to us and maybe it needs to be reiterated more don't even allow don't listen to even just one word that's different amen because that influence oh i hope you're with me yes i'm preaching this prejudice amen a christian got in the wrong environment c environment influenced him see you just keep holding around with that kind of environment an environment that changing of one word is okay that's not a big deal it wasn't a big word uh come on that environment will influence you i hope you're reading between the lines of what i'm saying see it influences you in that environment okay i'm gonna say it depending on whether they like it or not my brother and sister this has been spoke to me man says something off the word of god someone defends and says oh don't worry about it it's just message myth i kid you not those very words ah no big deal message myth really it's off the word so what does it do i don't know if you caught it i want i want you to catch it it influences you in that environment oh oh i get it it's okay if we have some myths in the message it's okay that we have some things that that that this one told this one that told this one that this told was told this one told this one told this one and it's not right but look it goes way back it goes all the way back to when the prophet was still here so it must not be too no influences you in that environment that suddenly it's okay to speak something that doesn't line up with the word it's in that environment it influences you in that environment and first thing you know you become part of that environment and you go into it well i know we're not saying it right and we're not quoting it right and we have nothing to back it up in the message or in the scripture but you know here i am gonna sing a song to you that i shouldn't i heard it from a friend of a friend of a friend huh come on you guys have seen the rockwell painting where the man tells the woman i think it is starts off man tells the woman and it's several lines of a person telling persons telling person telling person telling person and the last square is the man back with the original person and he's angry because it's no longer the same story you think we should guard whatever influences we're around saints and you think we ought to take it you know i'm sorry you're an elder or you're this or you're that i respect you but what you're saying doesn't line up with the word amen it's not a myth it's not a myth my brother and sister it's false doctrine it's a false word right if one word will bring a curse upon you that's what this scripture says just one word will bring a curse upon you no my amen now you know here i am sounds like i'm beating a horse you'll find whatever the attraction is will be directly connected to an environment come on let me put it to you this way i won't name the brother's name but he says i refuse to quote the prophet well be patient he said if you need me to say brother branham said for you to believe what i'm saying you should know the message well enough to know i'm telling you the truth do you follow that you see for it to be quantified that we'll be able to say amen to it we've got to hear now brother branham said what about the word ringing true the word coming and the word in you sing amen to each other but when people come to a place unless they're sure brother branham said that they're not going to respond he said i'm sorry i'm not going to say brother branham said i'm going to preach this message to you and if you don't know the message well enough maybe take notes and figure out if i'm telling you the truth or not pretty pretty direct way he puts it my brother and sister because you see what it is we've come to a time and a place our attractions are everywhere but the word of god and we come to church and don't know if the preacher is telling the truth or not because we have no point of reference where is our attraction to study this message to read our bibles to be so engrossed into this that when the preachers preaching we can say hallelujah that's the word right there amen that's what he said to the romans that's what he said to the corinthians that's what he said in revelation my brother and sister but people have no point of reference because their attraction is to everything houses lands this that's and the others and that the word of god is a secondary thing and we're no different than the prophet of god was talking in that last quote about they just come to church come on look the day is coming saints you know i love you i want to see every one of you in the rapture i don't mean to sound harsh i don't mean to sound uh brutal i don't mean to sound grating but my brother and sister one day it'll be all over right amen he's not coming with a billboard announcement he's coming as a thief in the night amen and so it's time for us to just put everything in its right place and put these things off to the side put them i i'm no problem i own a boat okay but i don't let a boat dominate my life i'm not on a lake this morning or a river somewhere this morning in the boat justifying something else my brother and sister i enjoy the pleasure of tooling around on the water and burning expensive gasoline but you look at that when that thing moves into a place that i can't go to church because i have a boat i can't this because of that i can't this because of that you see mother and sister it's fine enjoy some of these natural pleasures of life but don't let them draw you from the presence of god amen you need you owe it to god oh i i guess i'm gonna get rough if you're watching youtube or you're watching television you ain't got time to uh watch your bi read your bible and and uh uh you know study the message my brother and sister then the devils deceived you amen you got to throw these things those are called distractions amen you've got to throw those things out because you see there comes a time and influence influences you in that environment and the foolish virgin right brother ram said you couldn't touch their life right couldn't touch their life but why didn't they have oil they lived the life come on saints they weren't drinking they weren't smoking they weren't slipping out at night and dancing but they didn't have the oil they come so far they came so far and then they hit a little blockade because they were too busy there's an influence that come in that environment come on am i being too hard this morning look i i want each one of you to stop and say okay lord am i giving sufficient time and i lift my hand i'm guilty i'm guilty just like anyone else but i i'm i'm not trying to promote myself but i'm gonna lift my hand and say lord forgive me amen that that i don't let this influence come and influence me in that environment where hey i'm a message believer i've been in the message a long time oh i'm a preacher you know so i'm going to be all right i've got a i've got a preacher's exemption it's here somewhere i don't know i mean i know a house one you know god's gonna give me some special uh dissessation of grace because i was a preacher no sir he said if you're gonna meet god that's the way you come you meet him amen oh let me put it back to you you're not going to stand before the throne one day and say but i'm a friend of a friend of a friend it won't work you've got to be one on one with him saints a reminder okay and the reason i preach this is because i actually love you so much it hurts i wake up in the middle of the night and i pray for all of you amen i pray and i pray and i pray and i you know i tell you that's a perfect thing don't go to a doctor for insomnia if any of you got insomnia amen don't go to a doctor for insomnia just pray the devil will say oh he's praying i'll let him sleep and if you don't sleep just think all the time you have to pray for the saints hallelujah it's a double blessing amen two-headed sword oh hallelujah okay my oh my worst time go you see my brother and sister what's happening is is matthew 24 28 declares to us wherever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together now my brother and sister this is not a vulture convention this is an eagle convention amen where the carcass is ultimately the eagles i hope this won't offend you but you see the vultures want to wait till the carcass is old enough that they can come and say well brother branham really didn't get this right you know because the carcass after a while is is getting stale you know we do this but is this a living word this this carcass that the bride of christ is feeding on is a living word it's not old it's not stale it's not a bygone era amen it's not a myth it's the truth amen so where the carcass is there you're going to find some eagles feeding and you look at that and realize just how beautiful it is that when the eagles can come together around the corners that they are there my brother and sister they're not arguing on the carcass this is some place where all of our divisions even in the message has a divisive spirit with it that they're arguing it's either my my argument saints i'll just tell you where i'm at i do argue on the word forgive me it's either correct or it's not there's my argument i don't care that this brother preached it or that brother preached it i don't care who's elevated or who's been demoted or whatever else it's either truth or it's not and if it's not true i'm not going to sit there and feed on it because that's not the carcass and you've never seen a bunch of eagles sitting there on the carcass my brother and sister debating they're eating now if you've ever watched a bunch of hyenas sister jerry and i had the privilege being in africa and watching hyenas behavior i'm telling you saints they argue about everything we went on a night ride on a bus a tour bus out of one of the posts there with brother gideon's sister kathy we're driving along there sister jerry's like oh i'm creeped out because you know the hyenas are actually a lot bigger than they look and these things are loping beside the bus that we're on and their ears are bobbing above the side right here and as they're running along they're running following the bus you know it's just something to happen and they're running along and then all of a sudden there's no hyenas there because they're in the middle of the road back there then they get up buses left us next thing you know they're running beside the bus again and then they're gone and they're in the middle of the road well i'm headed to the rapture i gotta catch up come on come on come on saints get these divisive spirits out of the house oh god we're here to get to the carcass we're here to feed on that carcass we're here to say this carcass is good this is the word of god the word for our generation the word for our day we're not here to fight over it we're here to eat it right oh if we just spend more time eating it and less time fighting over it hallelujah and those natural hyenas were still really creepy because they are well they just are now look i want to close out with this little thought here i got way more notes my goodness ah question answers brother brown says this he got in the prayer line and i was praying for him and i said do you believe chief and he said that's right and i said well you believe that god will heal you he said that's right i said you'd be a good boy he said that's right i met him about a week later brother fred sofman i believe was there it was when they when the tet meeting was going on it was phoenix and i met him a little later on in the week and i said are you doing all right chief that's right come to find out i talked to what's that missionary's name up there that old man with a white mustache up there now see if his wife had been there she could answer that question because i found out that anything i haven't figured out my wife remembers phone numbers people's names you know what i'm talking about brothers amen you talk about god blessing you hallelujah other people have to carry a smartphone amen come to find out the missionary's name old man white mustache up there with to the apaches i can't think of his name oh fine old fellow his wife was healed of cancer you know he said brother brown that's all he said i taught him to say me sick that's the only thing he could say that's right so that's about it you see that's right me sick i'll tell you what saints i'm gonna just throw this in here right now it'd probably be good if some of us believers would be able to say you know what me sick that's right me sick be able just to admit there's something in my life there's something bothering me something i've been dragging along i've got all this baggage me sick that was a very muted response somebody told me had one time was converted received the holy ghost and said to him how are you getting along he said pretty good pretty bad i know some believers like this how you doing brother i guess all right well maybe not how do you mean pretty bad pretty good he said well since me received the holy ghost right here good positive confession there's been two dogs in me one of them a black dog and one of them a white dog they can't hardly gallop beside the bus without stopping and fighting in the street they argue all the time they growl and fight at one another and said the white dog wants me to do good and the black duck wants me to do bad said well chief which one of them wins the fight come on saints i don't care how long you've been in this message what life you live you could be living a perfect life you have to admit we face this struggle right here that depends on which one chief feeds the most so i think that's a good answer here see there just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of god that does it amen can every son of god be so anointed till he can do miracles signs and wonders is this the next question i'm going to come back to that other quote we'll talk about that in a minute the very next i i thought they were just ordained of god to connect right together can every son of god be so anointed until he can do miracles signs and wonders or is this just is this at the directions of the holy ghost yes it is at the directions of the holy ghost if you're a son of god or a daughter of god whatever you are when you have received the holy spirit then the holy spirit directs you to do things hallelujah now i'm just going to deviate back around here make a nice little u-turn my brother and sister the struggle we have in life wait let me just stop it's not you it's people like you it's people like me that they come down to a place the other day i just got faced against a little thing the other day that just reminds you how feeble the mind could be a little situation that we're in some business and and my brother and sister i don't mean to make a deal out of it but i'm talking you know we're talking about not little business not five dollars we're talking about thousands of dollars and you know the other day i could have just done a certain little thing would have made me several thousand dollars but you know in the flash you go well you know this was this and that was like this and so that would be perfectly acceptable but another voice comes and says would you trade eternal life for five thousand dollars and the answer is of course not now i might be the only one here that faces those kind of things but i rather doubt it what would we trade eternal life for i hope the answer is nothing take this whole world but give me jesus you see it becomes a cornerstone of our life that we cannot get away from that and you say well brother paul what do you mean we can't get away from that the holy ghost that is in you will not let you leave the word the prophet of god says the holy spirit would never take you away from the word so when we can confess today i've got the holy ghost thank you lord have some confidence but when that voice speaks you've got to listen you can't say well i deserve this i did this and this for them and never got paid it would be perfectly fine and another voice says what would you trade nothing i have my answer nothing amen you see because the holy spirit is going to direct us to do the word bring us oh my you know what i've run out of time you realize every one of these sermons i've preached on this thing right here i just have to drag it forward because there's just not enough time i want to leave you just the slightest hint of where we would be going down the road and that will be go study in your bible genesis 13 and you'll see right there that this is the time when abram lot or family but they're bickering there's a struggle going on there's two dogs at war now neither one you go back and study the scripture go back and study history neither one was really wrong but one was more right than the other now you say why do you say that brother paul because none of us can stand before god in our own righteousness we have things that we're doing right but we still have those things that we do that aren't right but you'll find as it comes down it comes into a whole time of decision and we'll see of this anointing my brother and sister if we put it that way this atmosphere this attraction as we look in genesis 13 amen you're going to see that given an opportunity i want you to see this now given the opportunity everyone says you know what you choose lot you choose abram didn't say you go down there i want you to catch this he didn't say you go down there in the plains you go down there to sodom and gomorrah and do the best you can do he gave lot the opportunity you choose now do you see this you might call it the law of attraction which is more of a theory than a real law lot got over there looking down off the plains of mamrie and they look back and here's a land that just goes forever and ever there's nothing out there and he looks down here and he says wow there's rivers there's planes there's people there's this there's that there's the city i'm not making fun i find it interesting i do joke about it sister jerry insists maybe some of the rest of you would be advocates of this sister jerry insists that you can take something apple orange candy bar t-bone steak and you can hold it in front of you and close your eyes keep on stake it's good other things [Music] feels like it's pushing me away now she only just does that trying to make a point with me you shouldn't eat that hold that out there and see what your body tells you well i'll tell you what my body just told me that hershey bar tasted good but here's a lot looking down on the plains and sodom forgive me saints i i don't mean to just make mockery i just want you to catch it lot was looking down on the planes and it just pulled him the attraction was so great right when you read some of the commentary of men like spurgeon and stuff you'll find that lot thought he could go down to sodom and live an overcoming life in sodom but by revelation abram abraham as i like to put it because he was always abraham amen he received a name change but he was always abraham abraham you know what i don't know let's speculate now seriously let's speculate for a moment here i think personally abraham knew where lot was going that's why he could offer that to him you pick because you see the track record of the attraction and they're fighting abraham sends his people out they dig a water hole lot comes along and says we're family wear this i have just much right to this water hole you do fighting constantly now i'm going to stop right there one for the sake of time two i want you to study that if you would find time revelation 13 revelations i mean revelation 13 genesis 13 genesis 19 my brother and sister you're going to see there that there's something about that that drew him there and i'll just give you this much the prophet of god says these things happen because the word of god has to be fulfilled has to be not might be but has to be fulfilled you know what's drawing the bride of christ to the word prophecy that must be fulfilled amen you know the scripture says no man has sought god but god has sought man amen when you see this call this hunger in your life just stop don't fight against these things just stop and say lord i trust you to lead me i trust your guidance lord and i'm asking you to just show me with clarity give me revelation illumination lord that i can just walk into it because you see my brother and sister let me just close with this sister emma if you'll come my brother and sister let's not be so spiritual and fool ourselves there's things out here in this world we find attractive there's things in the age that we live in look i'll just be honest with you you drive down the road now we all have our little weaknesses you drive down the road i see some really nice shiny duramax pickup driving by with the right rims it's the right color got the right things on it and i look at that and i think wow what a nice pickup what tops that is when a cherry red or bright little corvette drive spot and i'm like jerry's like don't forget you are driving sorry i just i just find them beautiful i find them attractive but you see if my soul is worth ten thousand worlds and yours is worth ten thousand worlds what is something like that compared to our salvation now i'll tell you saints there's been many a time i've found a good buy on a corvette and i thought ought to buy this thing this is a killer deal but a voice spoke to me and said sure paul drive up to church [Music] drive up to church and get out of something like that when there's saints that are labor and struggle and just get by and just oh you know just go ahead or you know what's worse than that you know the preacher who at least drives up to church in his corvette has enough courage to show you what he's done what's worse is the impulse to hide it now i'm not talking about the preacher anymore i'm talking about every one of us the impulse i can hide it i'm sorry the word of god says whatever we've done in secret god will make open live a transparent life saints amen when the attraction of this world rises up just remember greater is he that is in you that is he that is in this world amen imagine all that nice shiny aluminum all that nice shiny steel all that chrome will turn into elements and go right back to the earth again one day it's not worth our soul amen the attraction my brother and sister now the vine of god the word of god will always draw you to the things of god amen oh i pray this morning you know i hate to say it this way but i never even got to the good stuff but you know the story about chief was in my sermon about four weeks ago and i never got to him till now so we've got a ways to go but i want you to understand saints we're in a warfare [Music] just allow yourself to have the liberty to be drawn to the things of god put god's work first and he says i'll give you everything else seek ye first the kingdom and all you know he never said what all was but i believe you know if you wanted a cabin in the mountains i believe that might fall into the all you want to live in a nice house you want to drive a decent car you want to enjoy a few pleasures of life that that can fall in the all but just seek first the kingdom hallelujah because there's an old phrase and i'm closing now brother jay i don't really have any songs if you would have something for us amen my brother and sister if it's too good to be true it probably is but the word of god is true amen right in the very next thing i was going to go into the scripture says he's never seen his children begging bread just trust him amen recognize the spirit for the day stand on the word of god even nook saints even if it tears the height off of you young people even if you think brother paul is just kind of boring and redundant please i ask you in the name of jesus christ just give thought to the word of god and ask god to make it real to you because it is real you know i get redundant i'm sorry i i just realized told jerry the other day i think i'm getting old because you know it's like uh yeah you already told me that story okay did i no you already told me that one i'm getting old saints but look at this my brother and sister this word of god when we had the opportunity i say we meeting myself i was already broke away i had no connection to no church i was away from family i was doing what i wanted i had my own money my own life i might have even come to your house and slept on your floor or your couch if the door had been left open i just went wherever did whatever see this is real i was at that state the world would say he's at complete liberty he has freedom he has money he has time space all this to do what he wants but you see there was a tug there was a tug that couldn't be overcome and it kept tugging me and tugging me and tugging me and i found myself no longer happy i'm a married man i'm no longer happy going down to a pool room in the middle of night can i just share a little brief spot of that story i hadn't overcome that i was still interested then sister jerry you had a visitor staying at our house she was from a different state and she was there and and i come into the house at like 1 30 in the morning and i opened the front door and this little lady her name was legena and i opened the front door and she's standing there and housecoat and i'm a little shocked i'm like oh and this is this little
