[32:26] I'm tangled all up in Jesus tangled all
[32:40] up in yeah well long long time ago I did

[33:02] free when I got down on my knees praised

[34:00] wrapped up in Jesus and wrapped up I'm
[34:37] up
[34:40] [Music]
[34:46] [Music]
[34:57] [Music]
[35:13] well I want to just take a moment before
[35:15] brother Chris would come to the
[35:18] preaching of the word and just talk to
[35:19] you for a moment Church I believe we all
[35:24] kind of understand what's going on in
[35:26] the world around us and well I'm not
[35:29] going to directly reference those quotes
[35:32] and stuff this morning to not take up
[35:34] that time we understand the age that
[35:37] we're living in the prophet of God you
[35:39] can go look and the message he says
[35:41] they'll be in the end times germ warfare
[35:43] and we realized my brother and sister
[35:46] regardless of what circumstance or what
[35:48] is the condition out here we are in a
[35:51] warfare
[35:52] we are not as Christians just getting a
[35:56] pass you know go by go or whatever and
[36:00] collector $200 this is a warfare from
[36:04] the beginning to the end and in this we
[36:08] can take a position and say well we're
[36:10] simply not going to do this or do that
[36:14] but the scripture clearly teaches us
[36:17] that we must use wisdom you know we can
[36:22] there's many types it's interesting to
[36:24] see believers across the nations they're
[36:28] different points of view some are saying
[36:31] you know you're being foolish by not
[36:33] following the guidelines lock yourself
[36:35] in your house others are saying the
[36:38] prophet of God said that as it was in
[36:42] Goshen you put the blood over the door
[36:45] and the death angel will not come to
[36:47] your house and so we want to find the
[36:50] correct balance of wisdom you know the
[36:55] scripture tells us when the doors are
[36:57] open to come to the house of the Lord
[37:00] yet we don't want to open the doors
[37:02] foolishly if it will be detrimental to
[37:05] two sons and daughters of God I'm going
[37:08] to speak plainly
[37:09] they say that brothers and sisters like
[37:12] brother Bob and sister Joanne are very
[37:14] susceptible and so we don't want to put
[37:18] them at risk about we want to also
[37:21] recognize here again
[37:23] where the Holy Ghost is God is in
[37:26] control and you look at this you can go
[37:29] back in the message brother Branham
[37:32] talks about viruses he talks about
[37:34] epidemics he talks about these things
[37:36] it's covered my brother and sister and
[37:38] so what we want is to have wisdom not
[37:42] fear we do not want to be controlled by
[37:45] fear concerning coming to the house of
[37:48] God but we want God's wisdom and at this
[37:51] time in the state of Idaho because we
[37:54] are to render unto Caesar what is
[37:56] Caesar's be obedient to the law because
[37:59] we're a believer doesn't mean we set our
[38:01] own speed limit all right so it was
[38:05] where we're subject to these things and
[38:08] at this time the state of Idaho has a
[38:10] recommendation that when you read that
[38:12] it would tell us that we should not meet
[38:15] so that's the state of Idaho's
[38:18] recommendation is that if there's more
[38:21] than ten people we do not come together
[38:23] do not meet but by the same token it's
[38:29] not the law that's a recommendation amen
[38:32] are you with me
[38:33] so we don't want to push against these
[38:36] things but we want to also recognize
[38:38] that if we and we're still praying about
[38:42] this if we continue to meet if you're
[38:47] sick please don't come to church we have
[38:50] the ability to stream the service you
[38:52] have the ability to go on a computer and
[38:53] be a part of this service and I saw a
[38:57] lovely recommendation on how to go to
[39:01] church when you are quarantined or in
[39:04] your home and just a beautiful deal get
[39:08] out of bed get dressed
[39:13] eat your breakfast don't think you can
[39:17] show up late for church and when they
[39:20] pray you pray when they sing you sing
[39:23] and when they worship you worship and
[39:25] when the word is preached and it touches
[39:27] you you say Amen and so if that's where
[39:31] we end up going I just encouraged each
[39:35] one of you to
[39:37] approach it that way not to sit in our
[39:40] recliner in our bunny slippers for the
[39:43] bowl of Cheerios in our lap thinking
[39:46] we're going to church amen
[39:49] are you with me yes you know in the Dark
[39:53] Ages a very very difficult time but the
[39:56] prophet of God showed us that
[39:58] spiritually we are in the dark ages
[40:00] again and there was plagues but my
[40:05] brother and sister we also see that many
[40:07] mighty miracles took place in those
[40:11] times and and like I said I don't want
[40:13] to deviate and get too deep into this
[40:15] but some lovely quotes and things that
[40:18] brother Branham brings out that my
[40:21] brother and sister this is the time
[40:24] viruses brother Branham says now viruses
[40:27] the doctors don't even know what they
[40:30] are they can't even give them a name so
[40:34] what do they do we have coronavirus what
[40:38] did that come from
[40:39] they just gave it a name there's all
[40:43] these things they're just trying to cope
[40:45] then the Prophet goes on and says you
[40:47] know they can give you and brother
[40:50] branham actually speaks positively about
[40:53] well they can give you something for
[40:56] that virus they can give you something
[40:58] but it won't heal you gods our healer
[41:02] [Music]
[41:03] the prophet of God also in another place
[41:06] speaks up and says that the Holy Ghost
[41:09] in you is what seals you from this world
[41:14] so I need to find a balance we need to
[41:18] find a balance because we realize
[41:21] whether we're talking children sometimes
[41:23] older not everyone has the Holy Ghost so
[41:27] we don't want to say we're going to just
[41:28] do what we're going to do because the
[41:30] Holy Ghost seals us because we don't
[41:32] want to put those who do not have the
[41:34] Holy Ghost in a position where it might
[41:36] come back to them so believing that the
[41:41] Word of God says that we should come to
[41:43] the house of God when the doors are open
[41:45] I need you to pray with me
[41:47] that we'll have wisdom to
[41:51] keep the doors open or to close them and
[41:54] stream services I'll just be honest with
[41:59] you I have a tendency to say my life is
[42:02] in the Lord's hands it's not my hands
[42:05] but I don't want to put that upon you an
[42:11] obligation that I should not put upon
[42:13] you so each and every one of you if we
[42:17] go to streaming I would ask you please
[42:21] be faithful to go to church even if it's
[42:23] on the computer in your house if we
[42:26] continue to have services here in the
[42:29] sanctuary I would ask you to have wisdom
[42:32] as I said don't come to church sick if
[42:36] you realize you've been you know exposed
[42:38] now when I say expose my brother and
[42:40] sister I think it was my grandchildren
[42:42] that gave me these sniffles and I I woke
[42:45] up Monday morning with a sore throat and
[42:47] I said Lord I refused to accept this I
[42:50] woke up Tuesday morning with a sore
[42:53] throat I said Lord I refuse to accept
[42:56] this all week long I've had a sore
[42:59] throat and I continually say Lord I
[43:02] refuse to accept this I woke up Sunday
[43:07] morning I don't have a sore throat amen
[43:10] now did that was the passing of whatever
[43:13] virus that was well we can all take our
[43:17] position but I've confessed it I refuse
[43:20] to accept it right this is what the
[43:22] prophet of God said about our healing
[43:24] just proclaim your healing and refuse to
[43:27] accept any other verdict Amen well I
[43:32] want to say this morning Saints let's as
[43:36] believers make our confession this
[43:40] morning that we are sealed by the Holy
[43:43] Ghost and this epidemic just as the the
[43:47] Death Angel was in Goshen is to pass
[43:50] over us we refuse to accept the fear
[43:54] amen even the world is acknowledging
[43:57] fear how fear is controlling it now we
[44:02] as believers if the world
[44:04] out there recognizes the power of fear
[44:06] how much more we as believers should
[44:09] recognize that we have been delivered
[44:12] and are no longer subject to that yoke
[44:15] of bondage but we can claim our liberty
[44:19] in Jesus Christ so will you pray with me
[44:22] we were seriously considering not having
[44:25] church this Wednesday till we decide
[44:28] exactly what is happening supposedly the
[44:31] state of Idaho is on the very verge of
[44:34] saying that there would be no meetings
[44:36] like this and so we haven't made a
[44:41] decision we will be interacting with the
[44:44] brothers officers of the church and
[44:46] we'll make these decisions in the
[44:48] meantime I want you to get up in the
[44:50] morning and say he who is free is free
[44:55] indeed and walk through your day
[44:58] declaring that the Holy Ghost is in me
[45:01] and has surrounded me it's above me
[45:04] below me and I've run into the refuge
[45:06] amen which is Jesus Christ god bless you
[45:09] once again please remember us in prayer
[45:12] and our brother David Dean Hart I
[45:15] believe we'll be travelling home a
[45:17] brother David sister Diane Ruth this
[45:19] coming week brother David is in Dewey
[45:22] Arizona preaching at the church there
[45:25] with her brother Ted miss Sedley today
[45:27] and of course we want to remember
[45:28] brother Ken Curtis we don't see our
[45:31] brother Steve's sister Emily today
[45:33] hopefully and they're not sick but just
[45:36] be mindful of those around you the body
[45:38] of believers and pray for them god bless
[45:40] you
[45:52] thanks Paul's like now you can get them
[45:55] all excited again well I do remember
[46:00] when brother rich was here we took him

[53:23] of the master race over why don't we
[53:41] stand this morning a man was the touch

[56:00] second Kings chapter 2 verse 13 he took
[56:06] up also the mantle of Elijah that fell
[56:08] from him and went back and stood by the
[56:11] bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of
[56:14] Elijah that fell from him and smote the
[56:16] waters and said where is the Lord God of
[56:18] Elijah when he had also smitten the
[56:21] waters they parted hither and thither
[56:23] and Elijah went over 2nd Kings chapter 4
[56:27] just turn the page
[56:37] verse 38 one more page and Elijah came
[56:43] again to Gilgal and there was a dearth
[56:45] in the land and the sons of the prophets
[56:47] were sitting before him and he said unto
[56:49] his servant set set on the great pot and
[56:53] seethe pottage for the sons of the
[56:54] prophets and one went out into the field
[56:57] to gather herbs and found a wild fine
[56:59] and gathered there of wild gourds his
[57:01] lap full and came and shred them into
[57:03] the pot of pottage for they knew them
[57:06] not so they poured out for the men to
[57:08] eat and it came to pass as they were
[57:10] eating out of eating of the Potters that
[57:13] they cried out and said o thou man of
[57:15] God there is death in the pot and they
[57:17] could not eat thereof but he said then
[57:19] bring meal and they and he cast it into
[57:22] the pot and he said pour out for the
[57:23] people that they may eat and there was
[57:25] no harm in the pot 2nd Timothy chapter 2
[57:49] take a Timothy chapter 2 verse 15 study
[57:54] to show thyself approved unto God a
[57:56] workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[57:57] rightly dividing the word of truth but
[58:01] shun profane and vain babblings for they
[58:03] will increase unto more ungodliness and
[58:05] their word will eat as death a canker of
[58:08] whom is hymenaeus and philetus who
[58:10] concerning the truth have erred saying
[58:12] that the resurrection has passed already
[58:13] and overthrow the faith of some
[58:16] nevertheless the foundation of God
[58:18] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[58:21] knoweth them that are his let everyone
[58:23] that name was the name of Christ depart
[58:25] from iniquity amen president would make
[58:29] the Lord out of blessing the reading of
[58:31] his words may be seated this morning
[58:35] praise the Lord
[58:38] what title this morning is there's
[58:43] poison in the pot and my subtitle is
[58:47] where is the god of Elijah Amen praise
[58:53] the Lord so coat off here when we talk
[59:00] about poison in the pot and we talk
[59:04] about the meal that Elijah thrown in the
[59:06] meal was flour and that is that meal is
[59:10] a type of Christ false doctrine is the
[59:14] death in the pot the man went out and
[59:18] gathered gourds when he shouldn't have
[59:20] any and instead of peas we'll read a
[59:23] quote here in a minute and he had no
[59:26] revelation of what to put in the pot and
[59:29] throwing the meal in the pot to heal the
[59:32] pot was Elijah's revelation of Christ
[59:36] and you don't have to throw the pot out
[59:38] just throw Christ in the pot amen and
[59:42] the bride's ministry is to preach Christ
[59:44] to this generation and you can't preach
[59:47] Christ if you don't know him but the
[59:50] balance says in the message the power of
[59:52] decision he says eating what living
[59:56] alone Israel didn't go out and try to
[59:58] get some Wild Oats and break them up and
[1:00:00] make some core
[1:00:01] case though he's referring to the man
[1:00:03] that they ate in the wilderness he says
[1:00:05] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:00:06] tonight got too many Wild Oats that's
[1:00:08] your diet you need a good old-fashioned
[1:00:11] Bible diet is what you need the pastor
[1:00:12] will tell you the truth about the Bible
[1:00:14] thank God we got plenty of them but
[1:00:17] notice the wild oat diet you know there
[1:00:19] was a bunch of preachers one time who
[1:00:20] was in the seminary and there was a
[1:00:24] prophet come up to see them and you know
[1:00:26] they went out to get some peas to make
[1:00:28] some pottage and they put on a great big
[1:00:30] pot to cook it up and one of them
[1:00:31] preachers went out and you know what he
[1:00:33] done he picked a lap full of gourds and
[1:00:35] put it in there and thought it was Peas
[1:00:37] this is now a guy that didn't know the
[1:00:39] difference between gourds and peas is
[1:00:40] pretty bad shape another spot pot he
[1:00:43] says then another message brother mom
[1:00:45] says boy a man that doesn't know the
[1:00:46] difference between a peas and the gourd
[1:00:48] is some preacher he's on to say says I'm
[1:00:53] telling you some people tonight in the
[1:00:54] ministry don't know any better than that
[1:00:56] that's right don't know the difference
[1:00:58] between the power of the Holy Ghost and
[1:01:00] fanaticism skip on down a couple lines
[1:01:02] in paragraph 48 says but there happened
[1:01:04] to be a man there that had a double
[1:01:06] portion you know what he done he just
[1:01:08] went out and got a handful of meal and
[1:01:10] thrown into the pot he never destroyed
[1:01:12] the pot he never destroyed the pottage
[1:01:14] that was in the pot he just took a
[1:01:16] handful of handful of meal and throwed
[1:01:19] it in there and said eat there's life in
[1:01:21] the pot he says what did that meal
[1:01:23] present meal come through a meal
[1:01:25] offering which was a sacrifice which
[1:01:27] come from the meal offering speaking of
[1:01:29] Christ the little birds they grounded
[1:01:32] they had to grind every grain just the
[1:01:33] same showing that the grinding of the
[1:01:35] meal in the sack showed that Jesus
[1:01:37] Christ was the same yesterday today and
[1:01:39] forever and if Christ in that day in a
[1:01:42] mess of poison could bring life the same
[1:01:44] thing today put Christ in a mess of
[1:01:46] poison doctrine will bring forth life
[1:01:48] divine healing and the resurrection and
[1:01:50] the power the Holy Ghost just like it
[1:01:52] was on the beginning what we need today
[1:01:54] is past Christ into the church get away
[1:01:58] from a lot of these long-nosed theologic
[1:02:00] doctors that we got hallelujah you think
[1:02:03] I'm crazy because maybe I am but let me
[1:02:05] alone I feel good crazy you feel good
[1:02:07] crazy this morning a man he says let me
[1:02:10] lose myself and find it Lord Indy I'm a
[1:02:12] lot happier this way and
[1:02:14] 49 he says all right notice the meal
[1:02:16] made the difference said don't dump it
[1:02:18] all out now just take the same material
[1:02:20] it'll give you life that's what Christ
[1:02:21] does when you realize him to be the same
[1:02:24] yesterday today and forever
[1:02:25] it changes death to life it changed
[1:02:28] death to life with these people and I
[1:02:30] grabbed a couple pictures so you can see
[1:02:32] this is a wild pea and the next one is a
[1:02:36] wild gourd the very big difference
[1:02:39] between the two so when brother Brennan
[1:02:41] says a man that doesn't know the
[1:02:42] difference well it's some kind of man he
[1:02:44] wasn't he wasn't far off so it wasn't
[1:02:47] the flower itself that Elisha threw
[1:02:50] enough into the pot it was the anointing
[1:02:53] behind the flower amen just like your
[1:02:57] flesh man there's nothing special about
[1:02:58] your body
[1:02:59] it's the anointing that Christ has put
[1:03:01] upon it you can use it's the instruments
[1:03:03] there's nothing wrong with the piano
[1:03:04] whether it's anointing that the piano is
[1:03:06] played it's the anointing on your life
[1:03:09] that the song and the music that you
[1:03:11] sing out in your life to Christ as you
[1:03:13] live your life day to day that song the
[1:03:16] way you sing that song and portray
[1:03:17] yourself to the world is through the
[1:03:20] anointing it has nothing to do your body
[1:03:21] is no different than the man out there
[1:03:24] on the streets maybe you have a few less
[1:03:25] holes if you have a few less tattoos or
[1:03:28] no tattoos there are some superficial
[1:03:30] differences but you still have a head
[1:03:32] hair eyes nose mouth hands feet you go
[1:03:35] on but the difference is the anointing
[1:03:37] that Christ has placed in your life and
[1:03:39] that anointing comes from the Holy
[1:03:41] Spirit so when the pot had there was
[1:03:43] death in the pot a man a preacher
[1:03:45] brother madam says went out to gather
[1:03:47] the food for the pot now what is the
[1:03:49] food and as Christians of food is the
[1:03:51] Word of God and when someone without the
[1:03:54] right anointing goes out and gets and
[1:03:56] gleans from the Word of God and leans
[1:03:59] and comes back and makes some part some
[1:04:01] pottage he's gonna put wild gourds
[1:04:03] instead of the word of God otherwise
[1:04:05] he's gonna miss his opinions with the
[1:04:07] pot and what happens is it produces a
[1:04:09] pot with death in it but then people
[1:04:11] want to go and throw the whole message
[1:04:13] out they want to throw the pot out with
[1:04:15] the pottage they want to throw all of it
[1:04:16] out and say you know what none of that's
[1:04:18] no good but what happened was somebody
[1:04:20] put wild gourds in the pot somebody
[1:04:22] mixed their revelation with the word of
[1:04:25] God and he seemed all all
[1:04:28] Elijah's dippers throw a handful of meal
[1:04:30] in there the message as a whole amen
[1:04:33] there is things that people come and
[1:04:35] they say this that or the other and they
[1:04:37] have their false doctrine and stuff with
[1:04:38] that they still those from the message
[1:04:41] it's just that they took their idea and
[1:04:43] mixed it in so it's the same message but
[1:04:45] when you mix that same message with
[1:04:47] Christ you get the correct
[1:04:49] interpretation and that feeding on that
[1:04:51] brings forth the life of Christ in your
[1:04:54] body in your life so it's not the
[1:04:56] message books and your Bible for say
[1:04:59] it's the anointing bring revelation
[1:05:01] through those words this Bible itself
[1:05:05] excuse me for being so plain this thing
[1:05:07] itself will not save you the Word of God
[1:05:09] in it the words won't save you a
[1:05:13] revelation of what God is trying to say
[1:05:16] through those words is what saves you
[1:05:18] because we have people across the world
[1:05:20] today some of them maybe they're
[1:05:21] streaming they're still having services
[1:05:25] and they're reading this Bible but there
[1:05:27] are a thousand a million miles away from
[1:05:29] Christ because there's not the word the
[1:05:33] actual English word that saves you it's
[1:05:35] the anointing the revelation of who
[1:05:37] Christ it to you to people can read the
[1:05:39] same scripture and disagree on the
[1:05:41] meaning two people can read the same
[1:05:43] quotes and disagree on the meaning amen
[1:05:46] but it takes the anoying of Christ the
[1:05:49] best of God it takes the anointing the
[1:05:51] revelation to give you that sustaining
[1:05:54] power to bring life into the pot amen so
[1:05:58] that meal is a type of Christ and
[1:06:00] brother Brown says in spiritual food in
[1:06:02] due season this this message came up
[1:06:05] over and over again in my search so if
[1:06:07] you had I recommend you all of us should
[1:06:09] have plenty of time being selected home
[1:06:10] now go listen to this one it's a three
[1:06:12] hour I think
[1:06:13] but a three or four hour but it's it's
[1:06:15] really good Alliance weather but this
[1:06:17] morning so he says in he says you
[1:06:18] remember when Elijah later on had called
[1:06:21] down after that meal offering that he
[1:06:23] had Christ and sustained the widow's
[1:06:25] house with it so for the man if you are
[1:06:28] student of the message he confuses
[1:06:30] Elijah with Elijah all the time so when
[1:06:33] he says the widow's house he's thinking
[1:06:35] about Elijah but he says notice later on
[1:06:37] when he called fire and out of the
[1:06:38] heavens and so forth and proved his
[1:06:40] sinning of
[1:06:41] prophets spirit he says so he's speaking
[1:06:43] of Elijah in this quote notice in the
[1:06:45] wilderness when he was laying down there
[1:06:47] under the juniper tree and the angel
[1:06:49] came down with the same kind of meal and
[1:06:52] baked some cakes and fed him and a
[1:06:54] little later on he put him to sleep
[1:06:55] again and woke him up and he had some
[1:06:59] more meal cakes baked there for him and
[1:07:01] he went in the strength of those cakes
[1:07:02] for 40 days glory to God he's the same
[1:07:05] yesterday today and forever oh how we
[1:07:07] love him spiritual food in its season
[1:07:09] what brother but I'm saying is this the
[1:07:11] same meal that that Luo woman had in her
[1:07:14] pot it's the barrel that never went ran
[1:07:16] dry and when you see there at the
[1:07:18] beginning of Elijah's ministry what does
[1:07:20] he throw in the pot he throws the meal
[1:07:22] but they had the same revelation that
[1:07:24] spirit of Elijah God takes a man but
[1:07:26] doesn't take his spirit and Elijah as he
[1:07:28] says when the light was off he said I
[1:07:30] want a double portion of your spirit and
[1:07:32] so he was given a double portion of his
[1:07:35] spirit and weaned on it and he did
[1:07:36] double the miracles and everything that
[1:07:38] Elijah did but that meal that type of
[1:07:40] Christ that's the food that's going to
[1:07:42] carry you through
[1:07:43] he says spiritual food in it sees it and
[1:07:46] this morning I'm here to tell you that
[1:07:47] we are in the season everything that
[1:07:50] brother Branham has talked about and the
[1:07:52] two kind of things he considered to come
[1:07:54] amen we are in that time that people are
[1:07:56] crazy they're not going to go crazy the
[1:07:59] world is going to continue to get worse
[1:08:02] and worse as we go on but we are there
[1:08:04] and we have arrived in the times that we
[1:08:08] have heard about and talked about and
[1:08:10] preached about the next thing we're
[1:08:12] waiting for amen is to get out to get
[1:08:14] out of here praise the Lord but the only
[1:08:16] thing that's going to keep you but the
[1:08:18] barrel says the rapture is a revelation
[1:08:20] the only way you're going to get that's
[1:08:22] that's the same way as you caught a
[1:08:23] revelation of the opening of the seven
[1:08:25] seals you've got a revelation that water
[1:08:27] baptism is in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:08:29] those revelations this is good the same
[1:08:31] revelation but let us as a rapture is a
[1:08:33] revelation how do you get revelation you
[1:08:36] get revelation when you feed on the word
[1:08:38] underneath the anointing of Christ the
[1:08:40] Christ of God you have to have that
[1:08:42] anointing you have to be Holy Ghost
[1:08:45] filled you have to have that double
[1:08:46] portion but the venom says when Christ
[1:08:48] went up and a and was left the earth
[1:08:53] after his ministry Jesus
[1:08:55] hehe sent the Holy Spirit down upon the
[1:08:58] apostles he sent them a double portion
[1:09:00] the Bible says these works you should
[1:09:02] you should do greater works but the
[1:09:04] venom seen in the early part of this
[1:09:06] ministry he said well we can't do
[1:09:07] greater works it'll just be more but as
[1:09:09] his revelation unfolded to the Prophet
[1:09:12] what yes the Prophet had to grow and had
[1:09:17] a great gain revelation and
[1:09:18] understanding that's why you have to
[1:09:20] take an idea from 47 all the way through
[1:09:23] 65 because you can't just take it here
[1:09:25] and if it doesn't line up with the rest
[1:09:27] say that it's the truth
[1:09:28] amen and so I feel like I'm stepping on
[1:09:32] some toes this morning so I'm not trying
[1:09:34] to amen praise the Lord so what what you
[1:09:37] need I'm getting back into my train of
[1:09:40] thought here what you need is maybe I'm
[1:09:42] not supposed to stay in my train of
[1:09:43] thought
[1:09:44] we'll just Lille to the Lord and so
[1:09:46] praise the Lord I'm gonna have to go
[1:09:49] back him out I can't remember where I
[1:09:50] was we are in the season amen
[1:09:52] we are at our caitiff I left a loose in
[1:09:56] I'm sorry I cannot remember what I was
[1:09:58] saying when I said I was stepping on
[1:10:00] toes Oh have you forgive me if you
[1:10:03] remember shout it out so we are as
[1:10:06] though as the bride of Jesus Christ that
[1:10:09] the grip thank you thank you the greater
[1:10:12] works oh brother branham he said he said
[1:10:14] they know that means more works but then
[1:10:16] later on as his revelation expounded he
[1:10:18] understood that no it is greater works
[1:10:20] because God Jesus when he was here on
[1:10:22] earth he didn't take air he didn't he he
[1:10:26] created water wine from water but
[1:10:28] brother branham out hunting he spoke
[1:10:30] something into existence he spoke a
[1:10:32] squirrel into existence and he said that
[1:10:34] that's the third pool the saints of God
[1:10:36] we were living under the third poem even
[1:10:38] that's why our pastor brother Paul he
[1:10:40] got up every morning and said I refused
[1:10:42] to accept this what was he doing he was
[1:10:44] speaking amen his healing into existence
[1:10:47] and that's what you have to do to speak
[1:10:49] the salvation of your children in to
[1:10:51] exist and speak the healing of your body
[1:10:53] into existence and speak the revelation
[1:10:56] of Christ into existence if you know
[1:10:59] that there are things that you're
[1:11:00] missing you have questions in your heart
[1:11:02] and you haven't had them answered
[1:11:04] they're getting to speak that into
[1:11:05] existence and God through His grace and
[1:11:08] His mercy
[1:11:08] because he is true and he has promised
[1:11:11] that will give you that revelation he
[1:11:13] will come along and he will make it
[1:11:14] plain to you Amen to sow it as he has
[1:11:17] done to many others praise the Lord but
[1:11:19] saints of God we are in the season we
[1:11:22] are at our Kadish Barnea
[1:11:23] the Bride of Christ has come to the
[1:11:25] River Jordan so to say Amen and Joshua
[1:11:28] and Caleb have gone over and I've seen
[1:11:32] the land and said hey the fruits are
[1:11:34] good we can go in and take the land but
[1:11:37] there are many people who don't yet have
[1:11:38] that revelation that they can be
[1:11:41] victorious do you know what you know
[1:11:43] what someone that doesn't want to accept
[1:11:44] you know things well there has to be
[1:11:46] something more to come there has to be
[1:11:48] something else to happen they're afraid
[1:11:50] to say this is the day they're afraid to
[1:11:55] say it is here they're afraid to stay
[1:11:58] why because it's going to call them up
[1:12:00] to a higher calling and their lives
[1:12:02] aren't ready to step up a little bit
[1:12:04] higher but you get your life in tune
[1:12:07] with the law of the earth with the word
[1:12:08] of the hour you get your life in tune
[1:12:10] with the message God begins to call you
[1:12:12] up a little higher and a little higher
[1:12:14] and instead of being afraid to step up
[1:12:16] to that next step that step up in faith
[1:12:19] into the higher calling in Christ you
[1:12:21] are excited because you know that with
[1:12:23] that with that higher living without
[1:12:25] higher calling God's going to reveal
[1:12:27] himself to you in a greater way so if
[1:12:29] you have something in your life that you
[1:12:31] need a revelation that you need to have
[1:12:33] a question about look around on the
[1:12:34] outside look around at what's going on
[1:12:36] around you and how you're living your
[1:12:37] day-to-day life and maybe there's
[1:12:39] something you need to get rid of amen
[1:12:41] for God to come in and expound your
[1:12:42] revelation amen with revelation comes a
[1:12:46] humble confidence we're missing that
[1:12:48] mentioned that last Sunday morning with
[1:12:50] revelation comes a humble confidence
[1:12:52] Joshua and Caleb stood for the people
[1:12:55] confident not arrogant and said we can
[1:12:58] take the land don't be afraid we can
[1:13:00] take the land even they had a revelation
[1:13:02] of the promise that God had given to
[1:13:04] them you think they were the only ones
[1:13:06] who heard the promise that the promised
[1:13:08] land was theirs no everyone else heard
[1:13:11] the same thing including 10 other spies
[1:13:13] and if I'm I can have the liberty this
[1:13:15] morning I'm gonna call these spies
[1:13:16] preachers these 12 preachers went across
[1:13:19] the Jordan amen the preachers are called
[1:13:21] to go into the word
[1:13:22] and find and glean the things from deep
[1:13:25] in the word not that they have to be
[1:13:26] deep as in over your head but there's a
[1:13:28] special anointing that comes with with a
[1:13:30] preacher and he can find these things
[1:13:32] that that the lay men in the end Kent
[1:13:35] can't always find and and and God that's
[1:13:38] what God brings and uses the fivefold
[1:13:40] ministry and so these Moses said all
[1:13:42] right you preachers go over there go
[1:13:44] find out go find us the revelation go
[1:13:47] find us excuse me the revelation go find
[1:13:49] us what it is the word says about the
[1:13:51] promised land can we do this can we
[1:13:53] overcome it and they go and they heard
[1:13:56] the same word they were preaching the
[1:13:58] same word they were both all twelve were
[1:14:00] preaching about the promised land but
[1:14:02] only two said it's ours 10 said that you
[1:14:07] know the Bible says they said that it
[1:14:08] was they couldn't take it but you know
[1:14:10] what they were saying it's not ours I
[1:14:14] stand here today before you every
[1:14:16] promise in the word is yours what does
[1:14:21] the devil want to do he wants to
[1:14:23] convince you the promise isn't yours
[1:14:25] because it's too hard to attain did God
[1:14:28] say we would stand here and be just be
[1:14:31] you know pushed and guided and and and
[1:14:33] and carried through life no he said hey
[1:14:37] all right son you've accepted me as your
[1:14:39] Savior you've been filled with the Holy
[1:14:41] Ghost time to put your armor on and it's
[1:14:44] not like David trying on Saul's armor
[1:14:46] this fits perfectly you have everything
[1:14:49] you need to overcome the enemy in your
[1:14:52] life you just have to be careful who
[1:14:58] you're listening to Caleb and Joshua
[1:15:01] knew beyond a shadow of doubt they could
[1:15:04] take back their land take back their
[1:15:08] land it's already yours every proper you
[1:15:12] need a promise of maybe there's a
[1:15:14] promise in the word maybe you know the
[1:15:16] healing of a sickness and you say well
[1:15:18] I'm perfectly whole it doesn't matter if
[1:15:21] you need it now it's still yours there's
[1:15:24] countless promises in the Word of God
[1:15:26] that you have not needing today but you
[1:15:28] may need at some point but it doesn't
[1:15:30] matter all of it is yours Joshua and
[1:15:33] Caleb knew they were taking back their
[1:15:36] when they crossed over Jordan you know
[1:15:37] if the difference between them and the
[1:15:39] other guys was they said Wow doesn't it
[1:15:41] just feel like home here these are the
[1:15:44] preachers they start you start bringing
[1:15:46] up this the open Word and these things
[1:15:48] and and then they start getting really
[1:15:49] really tense and afraid why because that
[1:15:53] spirit that they're anointed with is
[1:15:56] afraid of the anointing of Christ
[1:15:59] because that anointing of Christ is what
[1:16:01] exposes those spirits in their life that
[1:16:03] are preaching the false doctrine um but
[1:16:06] you get into the presence of God for
[1:16:08] long enough that's why you have to
[1:16:09] humble yourself what what keeps you
[1:16:12] holding on to something in your life
[1:16:13] that you need deliverance from you need
[1:16:15] to overcome is pride you're not willing
[1:16:17] to humble yourself because you say well
[1:16:19] I can figure this out I can do this but
[1:16:21] saints of God I stand here they say you
[1:16:22] need God you cannot do it yourself
[1:16:25] you cannot overcome in yourself you
[1:16:26] cannot overcome this world this virus
[1:16:29] you can't overcome doubt in your life
[1:16:31] without Christ amen we believe that
[1:16:35] Elijah amen is a type of the bride and
[1:16:38] brother says in it is the rising of the
[1:16:40] Sun that's actually one of my favorite
[1:16:41] messages he says that same quickening
[1:16:45] power of God represented in both of
[1:16:47] these prophets look at their names are
[1:16:49] almost the same Elijah Elisha see the
[1:16:52] bride and the groom one of them is mr.
[1:16:54] Jesus the other one is mrs. Jesus you
[1:16:57] see almost the same just between the he
[1:17:00] and sheep see so the bride Amen Elijah
[1:17:03] is a type of the bride and what did
[1:17:05] Elijah do Elijah took a handful of meal
[1:17:07] and threw it in the pot amen
[1:17:11] chew on that for a second and the bride
[1:17:13] has a double portion of the Spirit of
[1:17:16] Christ it's in the message that's not my
[1:17:18] words if I read if I took everything
[1:17:21] that I said this morning and I found a
[1:17:22] quote for it we would just stand here
[1:17:23] and read quote that's why you have to
[1:17:26] know the message of the hour you say oh
[1:17:27] well that's brother Chris's idea I'm
[1:17:29] telling you this morning it's not my
[1:17:30] idea nothing that I preached by the
[1:17:32] grace of God I pray every time I speak
[1:17:34] Lord let me not mix my words in with
[1:17:37] yours but let it be all yours
[1:17:38] and when you go on the message and you
[1:17:40] begin to read the message and God begins
[1:17:42] to inspire you my guess they give you
[1:17:43] revelation then you hear stuff that's
[1:17:46] not verbatim the quote but it fits in
[1:17:49] perfectly because Bella perhaps that you
[1:17:51] got to read between the lines
[1:17:52] that doesn't mean you roll in there and
[1:17:54] say you make up your own doctrine that's
[1:17:56] not what it is you can read the message
[1:17:58] of the hour read the word and begin to
[1:18:00] see the thought of God expressed you
[1:18:02] begin to see the heart of God expressed
[1:18:04] to you you can only put so much heart
[1:18:06] into physical words but you can put all
[1:18:10] your heart into the anointing of Christ
[1:18:12] God it says you want he said I know you
[1:18:15] there's no way you'll be able to make it
[1:18:16] by the words that's how I went from the
[1:18:18] law to grace he says so I'm gonna give
[1:18:21] myself I'm gonna give my life and I'm
[1:18:24] gonna give you a double portion of my
[1:18:26] spirit you are anointed you are filled
[1:18:29] with the Spirit of Christ you know what
[1:18:31] that means you've already overcome the
[1:18:32] world because he's how to overcome the
[1:18:35] world you already have eternal life
[1:18:38] because he is eternal praise the Lord
[1:18:41] amen amen praise the Lord Luke 9 verse
[1:18:45] 20 he says he said unto them but whom
[1:18:49] say ye that I am Peter answering said
[1:18:53] the Christ of God the anointing of God
[1:18:57] Christ is an anointing your soul is the
[1:19:02] holiest of holies in your earthly temple
[1:19:04] there is nothing special about your body
[1:19:07] like I said there was nothing special
[1:19:09] about the Ark of the Covenant itself the
[1:19:11] box with the gold plates and the
[1:19:13] cherubims that was just a physical
[1:19:16] office an object but God chose that
[1:19:19] object to anoint with his spirit just
[1:19:22] like your body there's nothing special
[1:19:23] about your body but God has chosen to
[1:19:25] anoint it with his power and his
[1:19:28] presence praise the Lord brother man I'm
[1:19:30] Nessen the message chooses your body is
[1:19:32] worth about 84 cents
[1:19:33] it's your flesh praise Lauren it is the
[1:19:37] anointing of God the Christ of God upon
[1:19:40] the vessel that makes the difference for
[1:19:42] his Lord he says why Christ speak 1959
[1:19:45] Nicodemus well expressed it when he came
[1:19:48] by night he said good master we know
[1:19:50] that thou art a teacher come from God
[1:19:53] amen they couldn't hide it we know that
[1:19:56] you're a teacher come from God for no
[1:19:57] man can do the things that you do
[1:20:03] the work that you do let's go Appa was
[1:20:06] with him they realized that he was
[1:20:09] approved of God anointed of God he was
[1:20:11] God servant the Pharisees and the
[1:20:14] Sadducees the ones who came to tempt him
[1:20:16] the ones who who preached against him
[1:20:18] knew in their heart he was the anointed
[1:20:20] of God now watch her brother Branham
[1:20:22] says here in the square I found this
[1:20:24] just incredible
[1:20:26] he says the church had to recognize it
[1:20:28] though they hated him they called him a
[1:20:30] devil that tried to find all kinds of
[1:20:32] excuses but when it come to face the
[1:20:35] facts they believed that he was the
[1:20:37] Anointed One but they thought more of
[1:20:39] their tradition than they did the
[1:20:41] anointing of God God have mercy that we
[1:20:45] never put our tradition above the
[1:20:47] anointing I've got oh so well the song
[1:20:49] yer didn't sing exactly 30 minutes and
[1:20:51] he didn't take up the offering at 45 if
[1:20:53] you started 10 30 you know 15 he didn't
[1:20:55] take the offering up 15 minutes in
[1:20:56] between and halfway through the song
[1:20:58] service am I gonna set preach only
[1:21:00] preached an hour and preach an hour that
[1:21:03] preacher preached half an hour
[1:21:04] that preacher preached an hour and a
[1:21:05] half that preached two hours don't say
[1:21:07] no conduct or in doctrine putting your
[1:21:11] traditions oh I can't stand up and
[1:21:13] praise God in the middle of the
[1:21:14] preaching because I don't want to be out
[1:21:15] of order I don't wanna I don't want to
[1:21:18] lift my hands and lift my voice in in
[1:21:21] church because because I don't want
[1:21:22] everyone to look at me I don't want to
[1:21:23] be out of order what so we're gonna
[1:21:25] tradition is to come in you you praise
[1:21:28] God you worship God in the song sirs but
[1:21:30] then you sit and you fall asleep in the
[1:21:33] preaching oh you you you you you you you
[1:21:38] can go to you can go to these things
[1:21:41] that are just singing and my goodness
[1:21:44] then people are all fired but you put it
[1:21:46] you can put a preacher up there they're
[1:21:49] falling asleep why because they need the
[1:21:51] anointing of the music to get anything
[1:21:53] started in your life but I tell you
[1:21:54] today if you Christ inside of you and
[1:21:57] then you begin to hear the word and
[1:21:59] something begins to rise within you
[1:22:01] because there's a deep responding to the
[1:22:03] deep there's a deeper spawning through
[1:22:05] the call it's something begins to move
[1:22:07] inside of you since I've been in
[1:22:09] churches been in services well the
[1:22:11] inside of me is just bubbling up and go
[1:22:13] while on the outside I'm just bouncing
[1:22:15] the kid you don't always know you don't
[1:22:18] always know but I'm telling you the Word
[1:22:21] of God the anointing of God the Christ
[1:22:23] of God in your life it will spawn when
[1:22:25] the word comes across the pulpit that's
[1:22:27] why a lot of times you see you know you
[1:22:30] can go on you can watch the services and
[1:22:32] then forgive me God for for saying this
[1:22:34] plainly in jeffersonville know people
[1:22:37] are all hyped up and they're all
[1:22:39] shouting and saying this things but
[1:22:41] they're shouting so loud they're not
[1:22:43] listening they're hearing that they're
[1:22:45] hearing these pop phrases and these
[1:22:47] familiar words come across in there yeah
[1:22:49] amen amen amen but they're never sitting
[1:22:51] down and saying does this line up with
[1:22:53] the word and then we can try to get your
[1:22:55] emotions all worked up and try to get
[1:22:57] you all excited but if we don't preach
[1:22:59] the Word of God that excitements gonna
[1:23:01] die as soon as you walk out the church
[1:23:02] doors not that excitements not gonna
[1:23:05] carry you Monday morning
[1:23:06] Tuesday morning amen that's why you have
[1:23:09] such a low success rate but nothing
[1:23:11] against youth camps that because the
[1:23:13] kids just get all hyped up and that's
[1:23:15] all it is then that you got to take the
[1:23:18] time to find Christ we as preachers I'm
[1:23:21] getting all excited right now too but we
[1:23:22] as preachers we have to take the time to
[1:23:24] say do you get it are you getting it and
[1:23:27] preach the word preach the word across
[1:23:30] the not not to not to just get you all
[1:23:33] excited and say the things you know a
[1:23:35] lot of preachers you hear they just they
[1:23:36] just they're preaching but all they're
[1:23:38] saying is these these phrases that they
[1:23:40] know will get the people excited and get
[1:23:41] everyone shouting and everyone making
[1:23:43] all this noise but do their life bear
[1:23:46] the fruits praise the Lord Wow
[1:23:49] amen don't let your traditions win over
[1:23:53] the anointing of God don't let tradition
[1:23:56] stop you from moving
[1:23:57] oh brother Chris that's your idea is it
[1:24:00] a paragraph well the number is not there
[1:24:03] the hand of the Lord came upon him 1954
[1:24:06] and Elijah done eight miracles in his
[1:24:08] life
[1:24:08] Elijah done sixteen miracles in his life
[1:24:10] and you people who claim to have the
[1:24:12] Holy Spirit then afraid to trust God for
[1:24:14] the supernatural I don't understand him
[1:24:16] I cannot understand it but a double
[1:24:18] portion of the blessing is on the church
[1:24:20] and we're afraid to move what's the
[1:24:22] matter with you friend I'm kind of
[1:24:24] wondering
[1:24:28] 19:54 the handle or came upon him it can
[1:24:35] pull the quote in the table and I can
[1:24:36] show you
[1:24:36] I didn't splurge my words in there he
[1:24:39] says I can't understand how a double
[1:24:41] portion that the blessing is on the
[1:24:42] church and we're afraid to move oh
[1:24:44] brother I'm just waiting on the Lord how
[1:24:47] long are you gonna wait before you stand
[1:24:50] up and cross over Jordan with Caleb and
[1:24:52] Joshua oh you say you say well brother
[1:24:55] Chris that they had the Promised Land
[1:24:57] that was a promise that God had given to
[1:24:59] them it was according to the word did
[1:25:02] God transport them across the river
[1:25:04] Jordan no Joshua and Caleb and the guys
[1:25:08] they had to get their feet wet they had
[1:25:10] to get themselves all muddy the Jordan
[1:25:13] River was muddy we know that because of
[1:25:14] the story of name and I don't want to go
[1:25:15] wash myself myself in the Jordan perfect
[1:25:19] transition right there naman had to go
[1:25:21] down to the river say oh I accept my
[1:25:24] healing and naman was expecting just the
[1:25:27] flowery words be healed O king or he
[1:25:31] wasn't a king
[1:25:32] captain naman be healed he was gonna
[1:25:35] feel all sensation on his body and he
[1:25:36] was gonna be transformed no huh he had a
[1:25:40] walk through the muddy banks of Jordan
[1:25:41] climbing that dirty nasty muddy river
[1:25:45] wasn't polluted it was just dirty and
[1:25:48] gross you ever seen him oh you guys
[1:25:49] have-have him all around here to tank a
[1:25:52] water tank you ever seen a water tank
[1:25:53] with the cows drink it's a nasty little
[1:25:55] pond that's probably what the jordan
[1:25:57] river looked like if brush enough the
[1:25:59] the the the well it would have been a
[1:26:01] river so there wouldn't have been algae
[1:26:02] on top but you know what I'm saying
[1:26:03] brushing aside the muddy weeds and
[1:26:05] climbing through the mud why he hadn't
[1:26:07] make that step forward yes God had given
[1:26:09] him his healing but God said first you
[1:26:11] need to wash in the river children amen
[1:26:14] Josh when Caleb had to get their feet
[1:26:16] wet to go and claim their promise
[1:26:18] sometimes you have to move to claim your
[1:26:21] promise
[1:26:25] that can be manifested in many different
[1:26:27] ways we're moving to a different Church
[1:26:32] from moving spiritually and and then
[1:26:36] putting things
[1:26:37] Amen when you smooth Psalms you have to
[1:26:40] get rid of stuff and the natural man you
[1:26:42] do get rid of stuff sometimes when you
[1:26:44] need to move spiritually you need to let
[1:26:46] go let go of well that's how I was
[1:26:50] taught you know what that is that's
[1:26:53] tradition when you say why I can't let
[1:26:57] go of this and you constable is this
[1:26:59] true because I heard this all my life
[1:27:04] when even though you know that doesn't
[1:27:07] line up with the word but you accept it
[1:27:09] anyways because well it's it's it's a
[1:27:11] comfortable you know tradition is
[1:27:13] comfortable tradition is very
[1:27:15] comfortable that's why what sometimes
[1:27:18] you go to another country god bless my
[1:27:20] sister coming over here she understands
[1:27:22] it everything is different
[1:27:25] you're not as comfortable it takes time
[1:27:28] to say it takes five years to readjust
[1:27:30] the living in another country everything
[1:27:32] is different it's not traditional you
[1:27:34] know in America we do things different
[1:27:36] than then over in Ukraine and Russia but
[1:27:40] you know they do stuff different than we
[1:27:42] do over here it's the same way if I went
[1:27:44] over there I'd be Wow okay where's you
[1:27:47] know where's the pizza shop you know
[1:27:52] what I'm saying praise the Lord Amen so
[1:27:56] here we have Elijah a type of the bride
[1:27:59] some time along here this morning I'll
[1:28:01] get to my sermon Elijah the type of the
[1:28:03] bride and he Elijah receives a double
[1:28:07] portion from Elijah and Elijah he said
[1:28:09] is presented with a part of pottage a
[1:28:12] hat that is full of poison
[1:28:13] that's poison in the pot and he says
[1:28:16] under the anointing of that double
[1:28:18] portion which we're calling the Holy
[1:28:20] Spirit he takes the meal which is Christ
[1:28:23] and puts it in the pot the Bride of
[1:28:27] Christ isn't called to go about
[1:28:30] spreading their ideas they're not called
[1:28:32] did you know the bride has a ministry I
[1:28:35] was in question and answers by the man
[1:28:37] was asked does the bride have a ministry
[1:28:39] and he says yes the bride has a ministry
[1:28:41] that's the time that we're in now
[1:28:43] whether you get up and preach has
[1:28:46] nothing to do with it
[1:28:47] did you know that you can be a well
[1:28:49] respected person in a
[1:28:51] group of fellowship and you say
[1:28:52] something contrary to the Word of God
[1:28:54] you plant doubt in those people's heart
[1:28:56] because they respect you for who you are
[1:28:57] on the contrary you you recognize you
[1:29:01] have that position of respect and you
[1:29:03] you preach the Word of God you're gonna
[1:29:06] lift the people higher you don't have to
[1:29:08] get behind the pulpit to preach a
[1:29:09] message you don't have to get a pope
[1:29:11] buying the hope it's a to be part of the
[1:29:13] McBride's ministry so here it is Elijah
[1:29:17] says hey there's death in the pot you
[1:29:18] recognize another brother and sister
[1:29:20] that there's death in the pot you begin
[1:29:22] to speak Christ to them you throw a
[1:29:24] little me a handful of meal in their pot
[1:29:26] and watch God you don't have to go get a
[1:29:28] new person you use the same pot in the
[1:29:30] same pottage you just throw a little bit
[1:29:32] of Christ in you watch God bring that
[1:29:34] death and make it into life amen but I
[1:29:38] just felt the need to throw this in here
[1:29:39] when I was now studying it up because so
[1:29:41] many times a lot of the faults and and
[1:29:43] the issues we have are on the message
[1:29:45] now amen ever since believe the sign
[1:29:47] which that's not the only instance but
[1:29:50] that's the big one right now is people
[1:29:52] have fallen away because they lifted up
[1:29:54] a man higher than God and then they saw
[1:30:00] that man's faults but Elijah a type of
[1:30:05] the bride had a double portion of cry of
[1:30:07] the holy spirit of Elijah but he's
[1:30:09] walking through one day and the 42
[1:30:11] children come out laughing at him
[1:30:12] calling him old bald head your brother
[1:30:14] man says the message he said he wasn't
[1:30:15] old he went bald young I have a good
[1:30:18] friend of mine and back home who's bald
[1:30:20] young and there's hope and so he got
[1:30:26] offended he turned around
[1:30:28] Elijah was a double portion let me tell
[1:30:30] you something if you knew Elijah and you
[1:30:34] saw him receded of a portion the the
[1:30:39] flesh Manion you would want to lift him
[1:30:41] up this is a man this is a godly man and
[1:30:46] which is nothing wrong with that but you
[1:30:48] lift him up so high
[1:30:50] you think he's perfect and he has no
[1:30:52] faults and then you see the backside of
[1:30:54] Elijah and now you turn and say well the
[1:30:57] whole thing's bad throw the pot with the
[1:30:59] pottage out what does it lie to do he
[1:31:01] calls she-bears out of the woods to kill
[1:31:03] 42 children
[1:31:04] as your pastor ever called murder down
[1:31:07] upon children but he speaks the word
[1:31:09] across the pulpit and you become
[1:31:10] offended you say well I'm gonna throw
[1:31:12] the whole thing out because I can't
[1:31:13] accept that when it's God's speaking
[1:31:15] truth under the anointing of Christ
[1:31:17] trying to bring your life into a higher
[1:31:19] position as you say oh you you if you
[1:31:21] were to saw Lysa or seated up a portion
[1:31:24] and you were to saw him do that
[1:31:25] how would you have felt don't sit there
[1:31:29] with your sunday tie and your dresser on
[1:31:31] and say oh well I wouldn't have cared
[1:31:33] you would have who would have been
[1:31:35] questioning this man Elijah you see even
[1:31:38] a prophet we get mad and kicked the dog
[1:31:42] and you want to say that brother needs
[1:31:43] the Holy Ghost or we get upset that's
[1:31:46] why it's such a such a bad thing to talk
[1:31:49] to I mean it can work it can work and
[1:31:51] there is instances I an example of one
[1:31:54] instance there's a lot of us that work
[1:31:55] together are believers but there is a
[1:31:57] lot of situations where you know though
[1:32:00] believers work with one another and you
[1:32:01] see though you see the flesh man coming
[1:32:03] in Monday morning just tired and grumpy
[1:32:05] you go this man don't even have those
[1:32:07] ghosts you see him yelling or smash his
[1:32:11] hand with a thumb up his ham his thumb
[1:32:13] with a hammer and you he starts yelling
[1:32:16] and hollering no not cussing because
[1:32:19] then you would be questioning him amen
[1:32:25] praise the Lord amen but that's what
[1:32:32] happens people lift men up and that
[1:32:34] until God actually brings those men down
[1:32:37] to sure that people hey you don't need a
[1:32:38] man to serve me you need me amen amen
[1:32:43] um but LeBaron says in the Prophet
[1:32:46] Elisha in 1954 he says now
[1:32:47] could you imagine after that blessing
[1:32:49] being promised this young preacher how
[1:32:51] he kept his eyes right on Elisha I tell
[1:32:54] you if somebody said look over here
[1:32:56] Elisha or some noise happened over here
[1:32:58] Elisha kept his eyes right on Elisha he
[1:33:01] wanted that double portion and if you
[1:33:04] want that double portion tonight keep
[1:33:06] your eyes on Jesus don't pay any
[1:33:08] attention to what the devil says what
[1:33:11] the critic says what the unbeliever says
[1:33:13] keep your eyes set on calvary saying
[1:33:15] lord you promised it
[1:33:18] amen if you want a double portion you
[1:33:20] got to keep your eyes on Christ just
[1:33:23] like the story of the boy that rode his
[1:33:24] bike across to the other two before
[1:33:28] whatever was he won all the other guys
[1:33:30] that were you know good riders fell off
[1:33:32] and they said well how'd you do and he
[1:33:34] said I just kept my eyes on the goal
[1:33:35] amen as Christians we have to keep her
[1:33:37] eyes on the goal because guess what the
[1:33:39] outside noise is going to get louder and
[1:33:42] louder and now when you're trying to
[1:33:44] record say trying to record a song they
[1:33:47] have a they have a way to them to bring
[1:33:50] the and forgive I don't know the
[1:33:52] technical term to bring the the input
[1:33:54] into the mic to bring and cancel out the
[1:33:57] noise on around the around the outside
[1:33:58] it's called the noise gate you know
[1:34:00] however long however much you you said
[1:34:03] it as soon as you close off of the mic
[1:34:06] it picks up your voice but doesn't pick
[1:34:07] up the voices around you I mean you got
[1:34:10] to get right into Christ that noise gate
[1:34:12] 100% closed so you don't you don't hear
[1:34:15] after you got your headphones on and and
[1:34:17] you're singing into the mic you're
[1:34:19] singing your song for Christ you're
[1:34:20] singing your life for Christ and the
[1:34:21] rest of the world you can't hear the
[1:34:23] noise all you have is a direct
[1:34:24] communication a dialog with Christ it's
[1:34:28] not a monologue it's a dialogue because
[1:34:30] he doesn't have to speak back with an
[1:34:31] audible voice but he can feel it's
[1:34:33] anointing in your heart I was I was
[1:34:35] really I read I don't know if any of you
[1:34:38] do the our daily strength it's an app
[1:34:39] the devotional app and I read it one day
[1:34:41] and he was talking about you know you
[1:34:43] know ask for revival in your life and I
[1:34:45] was walking along where I was driving
[1:34:46] along and what I was doing and and I
[1:34:48] said lord I pray I was thinking about I
[1:34:50] said lord I pray you were a revival in
[1:34:52] my life
[1:34:53] that's all I said and all of a sudden
[1:34:55] there was just sweet anointing and I
[1:34:58] said you know what the Lord was pretty
[1:34:59] pleased with that request that was
[1:35:01] dialogue that was dialogue you
[1:35:05] constantly say Lord I need this I need
[1:35:06] that I need this I need that that's
[1:35:07] monologue you begin to say thank you
[1:35:10] Lord there's a visible there's a there's
[1:35:12] a there's an obvious difference when you
[1:35:14] pray and you say you know you begin to
[1:35:16] to testify of who Christ is you begin to
[1:35:19] say thank you begin to praise him you
[1:35:22] don't never once have to ask for the
[1:35:24] healing of your sore throat because when
[1:35:25] you get done praising him guess what
[1:35:26] your heal why because what brings the
[1:35:28] healing the anointing of
[1:35:32] president Lauren and your faith in that
[1:35:34] atmosphere amen um the bride's ministry
[1:35:38] there called the throne meal in the pot
[1:35:40] sometimes well distr up the waters to
[1:35:43] Elijah took the mantle of Elijah said
[1:35:45] where's the god of Elijah and struck the
[1:35:47] water that's why I said you have being
[1:35:49] Christ and have a humble confidence
[1:35:50] because sometimes there's too many
[1:35:51] people there too she she pinched the to
[1:35:54] afraid to speak up you're too afraid to
[1:35:56] say where's the god of Elijah it's too
[1:35:59] afraid to stand up and say you know what
[1:36:01] that's not what the word says yes be
[1:36:05] careful there okay you don't want to
[1:36:06] start arguments but you know what I'm
[1:36:08] saying this morning prophet Elijah in
[1:36:10] 1850 Elijah in 1954 again just number
[1:36:13] couple paragraphs down he says notice
[1:36:15] now as Elijah went up
[1:36:16] Jesus promised a double portion of his
[1:36:18] spirit to the believers the things that
[1:36:20] I do show you also even greater and on
[1:36:23] the day of Pentecost when he went up on
[1:36:27] the day of the Ascension on the day of
[1:36:30] Pentecost the same Holy Ghost was upon
[1:36:33] him come again upon the church and I
[1:36:37] wanted today people who claim to have
[1:36:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and claim
[1:36:41] that they have kissed the rims of the
[1:36:43] cup of blessings of God how can we hold
[1:36:45] our peace when we see things going on
[1:36:48] the way it is it's time to take this
[1:36:50] holy spirit that we're anointing with
[1:36:51] and say where is the God that was upon
[1:36:53] Jesus Christ where is the God of Abraham
[1:36:55] Isaac and of Jacob where is the God that
[1:36:58] was on our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:00] that's the blessings and as in this that
[1:37:03] great crisis there you had someone to
[1:37:05] turn back to this quote is so fitting
[1:37:08] for this morning as in the great crisis
[1:37:10] out there you have someone to turn back
[1:37:12] to he says although Elijah was gone here
[1:37:15] was the one that poured water on his
[1:37:17] hand that had a double portion of his
[1:37:19] spirit so is this sick in sinful world
[1:37:21] today looking to a real Church of the
[1:37:23] Living God that's you in this crisis who
[1:37:26] possesses a double portion of his spirit
[1:37:29] what can you do in this time brother our
[1:37:31] answer shouldn't be who's going to be
[1:37:33] the next president or some theology we
[1:37:35] should give to the limb give to them the
[1:37:37] Living God the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:37:41] cuz he goes down to find out
[1:37:44] in this great crisis your call as a
[1:37:46] bride of Jesus Christ
[1:37:48] underneath the bride's ministry to go
[1:37:50] out into the sick and sinful world today
[1:37:52] and see and give to them the Living God
[1:37:54] the resurrected Lord Jesus you talk to
[1:37:57] somebody and you see the fear in their
[1:38:00] eyes you begin to say you know what
[1:38:01] those are scripture in Psalms 46 first
[1:38:04] one the Lord is our strength and a very
[1:38:06] present help in a time of trouble but
[1:38:08] also our refuge and strength a very
[1:38:10] present help in a time of trouble
[1:38:11] because I tell you what when there's a
[1:38:13] crisis people's hearts are softened
[1:38:15] towards God because they're afraid and
[1:38:17] they know because they were created by
[1:38:19] God whether or not they confess that God
[1:38:21] is alive and God is real they were
[1:38:23] created by God there's something in
[1:38:25] their heart that identifies you know
[1:38:27] what God can solve this and then but you
[1:38:29] have been given the ministry to go along
[1:38:32] and say you know uh you don't have to
[1:38:34] have a spirit of fear if you get the
[1:38:36] Spirit of Christ he will give you peace
[1:38:38] he will give you confidence he will give
[1:38:40] you sound mind I mean we are not called
[1:38:42] to bring a Ministry of confusion people
[1:38:45] go around and they have their own ideas
[1:38:47] and all they do is cause problems I mean
[1:38:50] I think it was in back in Thanksgiving
[1:38:51] when I was here I read the court brother
[1:38:53] said brother Branham says don't run with
[1:38:54] this doctrine and get all weird don't
[1:38:57] get all weird if you think it sounds
[1:39:00] weird it probably does don't repeat it
[1:39:04] don't go beyond I've had a brother
[1:39:08] Ronnie and then he's told me that you
[1:39:10] know as a as a young preacher I got so
[1:39:11] much to learn and he said you know
[1:39:13] preach what you know you as an
[1:39:16] individual as a Christian preached what
[1:39:18] you know what you know that you know
[1:39:21] that you know that's a brother around
[1:39:21] says don't try to preach these great
[1:39:23] doctrines to them just preach to them
[1:39:24] what Christ did for you because you know
[1:39:28] and there's a big difference in the
[1:39:29] anointing when you're preaching
[1:39:30] something that has directly affected you
[1:39:33] and that's directly spoken to you and
[1:39:34] has directly affected your life and your
[1:39:37] heart that your anointing
[1:39:38] there is powerful then you get out here
[1:39:40] then you start getting you know into all
[1:39:42] these other doctrines and stuff that
[1:39:44] that this person did you know they're
[1:39:46] just afraid to the coronavirus they
[1:39:47] don't care about serpent seed you
[1:39:50] understand what I'm saying then it gets
[1:39:52] gets all intellectual and then you find
[1:39:53] yourself in an argument and then you
[1:39:55] both go away and happy and afraid
[1:39:58] for his dolorous we're not called again
[1:39:59] bring a Ministry of confusion even
[1:40:01] amongst mother
[1:40:02] well did you so did you hear you know I
[1:40:06] read this quote I thought it was
[1:40:07] interesting oh you know it contradicted
[1:40:10] with what father Graham said over here
[1:40:11] what keep your mouth shut all you're
[1:40:15] doing is spreading doubt if you have a
[1:40:18] doubt about it take it to Christ take it
[1:40:20] to your pastor take it to another
[1:40:22] preacher I'll take it to your pastor if
[1:40:25] you go to this church because you take
[1:40:27] it to another preacher you might be
[1:40:28] talking to one of those ten that won't
[1:40:31] overdrawn and said we can't take the
[1:40:32] land so don't come to me for advice go
[1:40:35] to your pastor not that I'm one of those
[1:40:38] tears my goodness I'm just getting all
[1:40:40] I'm taking a lot but it's not in Jesus
[1:40:43] right now praise Lord amen a testimony
[1:40:49] you will testify of the revelation of
[1:40:51] Christ because that's what's going to
[1:40:53] carry you through you can can't preach
[1:40:55] Christ if you don't know him if I didn't
[1:40:59] know my uncle Paul there's no way I
[1:41:01] could describe what it look like or what
[1:41:03] his behavior is or how he has to have
[1:41:05] eggs and bacon in the morning got to
[1:41:07] have me in the morning it has to have
[1:41:09] breakfast if I don't know him I can't
[1:41:11] tell you that stuff right I can't tell
[1:41:14] you about Christ if I haven't met Christ
[1:41:16] amen there's death in that pot because
[1:41:19] preachers and people don't know Christ
[1:41:21] Christ so they pick gourds instead of
[1:41:23] peas and you saw what you saw the
[1:41:26] pictures of how obvious the two are now
[1:41:29] when you have a revelation of Christ
[1:41:31] false doctors and doctrines I haven't
[1:41:34] need to get up here and preach to you
[1:41:35] all of the false doctrines and I don't
[1:41:36] need to get up here I don't need to name
[1:41:38] them all for you with the revelation of
[1:41:40] Christ if I'll ever let revelation you
[1:41:42] see those two pictures out obvious and
[1:41:44] plain of this it's the same thing with
[1:41:45] Christ when you have a revelation it's
[1:41:47] obvious to you and sometimes we can
[1:41:51] become carnal we can become indifferent
[1:41:53] because to us it's so obvious but to
[1:41:56] them it's not because they what's wrong
[1:41:58] with you well they just need revelation
[1:42:00] and if you just go in you blast some out
[1:42:02] of the water and you say what's wrong
[1:42:03] with you why can't you figure this out
[1:42:05] why can't you get this all you're gonna
[1:42:06] do is chase them away
[1:42:08] and that as we know isn't gonna get you
[1:42:10] anywhere you need revelation to rightly
[1:42:13] divide the word of truth we read that
[1:42:15] scripture in the beginning it's in 2nd
[1:42:17] Timothy chapter 2 verse I think it's 18
[1:42:21] 7 or 15 as Lord I'm closing here we need
[1:42:30] we don't need your revelation you might
[1:42:36] have had the same revelation as me if
[1:42:38] you're a believer you have the Holy
[1:42:40] Ghost but I don't need your revelation I
[1:42:42] need my own revelation of Christ to me
[1:42:48] we need the Christ of God producing
[1:42:51] within us a revelation
[1:42:53] that's why believers don't read the
[1:42:56] Bible like a newspaper what does that
[1:42:59] mean that means reading the Bible
[1:43:00] outside of the anointing and you don't
[1:43:03] have to go in and and and and fast for a
[1:43:06] day and pray for 36 hours together the
[1:43:09] anointing you say Lord I'm about to open
[1:43:11] your word speak to my heart the Bride of
[1:43:16] Christ is coming into maturity and the
[1:43:19] times that we're living in they're
[1:43:21] getting away from all these this hypes
[1:43:24] and this worked up stuff - nope they
[1:43:28] have they have a humble confidence they
[1:43:30] know who they are in it when they know
[1:43:32] when they speak God's obligated to
[1:43:35] answer it
[1:43:36] so they open their Bible and they say
[1:43:38] Lord speak to my heart that's all they
[1:43:40] have to do and Christ will Scott will
[1:43:42] speak to them yeah something that that
[1:43:46] you know we can stand with conference
[1:43:48] excuse me before the enemy we can say
[1:43:50] Satan get lost you know why those those
[1:43:55] are the devil says if we don't know who
[1:43:56] you are and they beat up those guys and
[1:43:57] they some running naked they didn't know
[1:44:01] them because there was no Christ inside
[1:44:03] of them but you have Christ inside of
[1:44:05] you the devil knows who you are and he
[1:44:06] trembles he trembles he's scared he's
[1:44:09] scared to death this morning in this
[1:44:11] building he's got his virus spread all
[1:44:13] over the world he's causing panic and
[1:44:14] frustration and fright but you guess
[1:44:16] what hit you think his the guns are
[1:44:18] trained on them no he's got his gun
[1:44:19] trained on us today he's got
[1:44:21] guns trained on every believer in the
[1:44:22] world right now because he's trying to
[1:44:24] bring fear into your life and if you
[1:44:26] accept that fear you've just given
[1:44:28] victory to the enemy you say Lord I
[1:44:30] don't want to accept this for you not
[1:44:32] giving me a spirit of fear but of power
[1:44:33] and of love and of a sound mind praise
[1:44:38] the Lord
[1:44:39] fear is a powerful thing but Christ the
[1:44:42] love of God is far more powerful it's
[1:44:46] the most powerful force on the planet
[1:44:48] amen of the musicians will come I don't
[1:44:49] know how long I've preached hopefully I
[1:44:51] preached long enough and then preach too
[1:44:52] long so stop going around adding gourds
[1:44:55] to the pot and then if you don't know
[1:45:00] which ones to go order which the P don't
[1:45:02] even bring them to the table
[1:45:04] get across the river Jordan in the
[1:45:07] presence of the Lord and get your double
[1:45:09] portion Jordan is death to self Elijah
[1:45:12] had to cross the river Jordan with
[1:45:14] Elijah to receive the double portion
[1:45:16] just like you as a Christian you have to
[1:45:17] cross over death to self the River
[1:45:19] Jordan you have to confess your your
[1:45:24] your false your weaknesses your and you
[1:45:26] have to say Lord I can't do anything I
[1:45:29] surrender all to you and when you
[1:45:32] surrender then God can come and do his
[1:45:33] work within you go across River Jordan
[1:45:37] surrender to Christ get your double
[1:45:39] portion then come back out here and
[1:45:41] start spreading the meal starts gonna
[1:45:44] start going around and spreading Christ
[1:45:46] not your own ideas not your opinion not
[1:45:51] your distrust in this person or your or
[1:45:53] your or what you think this person is or
[1:45:55] the problems this person is causing
[1:45:58] gossip don't go around spreading all
[1:46:01] that go around talking about Christ
[1:46:03] someone says you know what did you hear
[1:46:04] about this pastor just announced the
[1:46:06] message oh that's crazy
[1:46:07] did you know Christ has given me an
[1:46:09] overcoming power
[1:46:12] there's always a way to turn the
[1:46:14] conversation back into Christ and if and
[1:46:18] there's always a way to turn the
[1:46:20] conversation back into Christ if you I
[1:46:24] don't know if I if you if that person is
[1:46:30] a godly person and they've just gotten
[1:46:33] their eyes off of that they'll agree
[1:46:34] with you and you'll start having good
[1:46:36] fellowship but if it's press if someone
[1:46:38] if it's someone you shouldn't be
[1:46:39] fellowshiping with fellowshipping with
[1:46:41] and you keep speaking Christ speaking
[1:46:44] Christ and they keep you know getting
[1:46:46] weird and turn the conversation back
[1:46:48] until they finally go well just have a
[1:46:49] nice day man and they walk away you just
[1:46:52] need to go back and pray for them
[1:46:54] there's something down in their heart
[1:46:56] man that needs to be changed
[1:46:59] stand in humble confidence you read you
[1:47:03] know what there's nothing wrong with
[1:47:05] keeping up to date don't start going
[1:47:10] reading reading people's opinions about
[1:47:12] the pandemic reading people's opinions
[1:47:14] about the virus it's fine knowing what
[1:47:17] does the governor say to do that's fine
[1:47:19] you know you'd be foolish if you just
[1:47:21] kept your head stuck in the sand but
[1:47:23] don't feed on that because that's the
[1:47:26] that right now that's the devil's gospel
[1:47:29] he's preaching you know he started out
[1:47:32] in February I'm opening a new series
[1:47:34] called coronavirus and the thing he's
[1:47:39] preaching it in in his church
[1:47:41] Satan's Eden called Kovan 19 in part 19
[1:47:47] he's spreading the gospel of fear but do
[1:47:51] you realize that you have an incredible
[1:47:53] part to play as a son and daughter of
[1:47:55] God
[1:47:56] God is calling you to rise up and begin
[1:47:58] to spread the gospel of peace blessed
[1:48:01] are the feet of those Amen
[1:48:03] however it goes that spread the gospel
[1:48:05] the good news for the gospel of peace
[1:48:07] our feet are sha our feet are shod with
[1:48:09] peace what does that mean why is it your
[1:48:11] feet because you have to walk around you
[1:48:13] have to go spread it out when someone
[1:48:15] comes with you to fear and they want to
[1:48:16] talk about even though even believers
[1:48:17] they need encouragement say well God has
[1:48:19] not given us the spirit but a power and
[1:48:21] of love and of a sound mind and you pray
[1:48:23] listen you got to trust God the the
[1:48:27] crazier the world gets the more and more
[1:48:30] and more stuff like this is gonna cause
[1:48:31] us to look into only one place and
[1:48:34] that's to Christ we have to stop looking
[1:48:37] at a be profane and we have this up
[1:48:38] looking to advil nothing wrong with
[1:48:40] those but you can't put your faith in
[1:48:42] them because they didn't heal you Christ
[1:48:44] healed you through the ibuprofen we
[1:48:46] heard that from our pastor praise the
[1:48:49] Lord
[1:48:50] so where is the God that was upon Jesus
[1:48:53] Christ it is within you now strike the
[1:48:58] water and cross over where is the god of
[1:49:02] Elijah where's the God of Abraham Isaac
[1:49:04] and Jacob
[1:49:05] where is the God the anointing of Jesus
[1:49:06] Christ stay with me it's in me it's in
[1:49:11] me say it again it's in me the state the
[1:49:15] Spirit of Christ is within me a the
[1:49:20] devil comes and says you need to be
[1:49:21] afraid you can't even go to church
[1:49:22] anymore you need to be afraid you need
[1:49:24] to be scared put you find a cozy corner
[1:49:29] with your bunny slippers in here full of
[1:49:31] Cheerios Union you need to you need a
[1:49:34] counter in the corner to be afraid say
[1:49:37] now I don't accept that Satan
[1:49:41] but I accept the power of Christ I just
[1:49:45] I feel so noted right now thank you God
[1:49:46] accept the power of Christ there is
[1:49:51] nothing in this world you have to fear
[1:49:54] except the power of Christ it's right

[1:50:01] if you will all you have to do is get
[1:50:02] off your seat and come and take it from
[1:50:04] me accept the power of Christ it's a
[1:50:07] free gift to you you say Oh
[1:50:09] those words are so familiar I always
[1:50:11] hear the preachers say it that's it
[1:50:13] still truth today you have to accept the
[1:50:16] power of Christ you turn it down you
[1:50:18] maybe you you only have two options
[1:50:22] except the power of Christ or accept the
[1:50:25] spirit of fear you did not want you
[1:50:29] accept the other period there is no
[1:50:32] middle of the road there is no fence to

[1:54:15] look look at this I was thinking about
[1:54:18] this you know one time you know a person
[1:54:21] you might call him a critic or whatever
[1:54:23] they said well you know these message
[1:54:25] people got their blinders on amen they
[1:54:29] got cognitive dissonance well my brother
[1:54:32] and sister the cognitive dissonance if
[1:54:34] you don't know the definition of it look
[1:54:36] it up in the dictionary later but you
[1:54:39] know it's kind of like ignoring the
[1:54:40] facts that are before you well who
[1:54:43] dictates the facts amen the world's got
[1:54:46] one set of facts if you don't lock
[1:54:48] yourself in your house you're gonna die

[1:54:53] sing that song here in just a minute my
[1:54:56] set of facts says the name of the Lord
[1:54:58] is a strong tower that I hide in amen
[1:55:01] you know when they start dying inside
[1:55:04] their houses my brother and sister go
[1:55:06] back to go back to Egypt they didn't

[1:55:13] house hallelujah well we got the Holy
[1:55:16] Ghost in our house amen we got the blood
[1:55:19] over the doorpost and we don't have to
[1:55:21] be afraid of anything
[1:55:23] amen hallelujah so thank you lord but
[1:55:27] they say you know you've got cognitive
[1:55:28] dissonance you're ignoring the facts
[1:55:30] well I'll tell you the fact is I never
[1:55:33] belonged on this
[1:55:34] I don't belong here now and I'm not
[1:55:38] claiming it in Satan's Eden as my home
[1:55:41] I'm claiming it after it's burnt over
[1:55:43] the Holy Ghost and fire is what is
[1:55:47] keeping me alive hallelujah
[1:55:50] anyway this same person's like well
[1:55:52] always message people got blinders on

[1:55:59] glad this morning I got blinders on all
[1:56:02] I can see is the end of the goal amen I
[1:56:06] see the finish line I see Christ I don't
[1:56:09] see what's going on over here
[1:56:11] I don't see what's going on over here
[1:56:13] but I'm riding my bicycle
[1:56:15] hallelujah down that little narrow
[1:56:18] gospel plank and I'm gonna ride it
[1:56:21] because I'm not looking at this side or
[1:56:23] this side I'm gonna ride it right to the
[1:56:25] end and I'm gonna be successful and as
[1:56:27] it were I'm gonna get my own bicycle and
[1:56:30] that's the one I'm gonna ride on the
[1:56:32] streets of glory hallelujah hallelujah I
[1:56:35] said all right if I preach for just a
[1:56:37] second Amen I was just reading and and
[1:56:40] I'll probably bring this back up again
[1:56:42] in a message but I was just studying and
[1:56:45] brother branham says here now you know
[1:56:47] they they talk about viruses and they
[1:56:50] talk about all of these things and
[1:56:51] brother branham says you know they say
[1:56:53] that the biggest killer is heart disease
[1:56:56] but brother branham said I'll just
[1:56:59] paraphrase it here brother branham says
[1:57:00] no they're not right
[1:57:02] the biggest killer is sin disease
[1:57:05] hallelujah see I'm not afraid of this
[1:57:08] virus and how many it'll kill amen I'm
[1:57:12] not afraid of any of these things out
[1:57:14] here my brother and sister I'm afraid of
[1:57:17] the sin disease and I don't say that as
[1:57:20] in a fear but you know I look at that
[1:57:23] and say you know what I'm more concerned
[1:57:24] about the sin disease so I just want to
[1:57:27] make a little announcement my brother
[1:57:29] Chris was preaching I felt like the Lord
[1:57:30] laid on my heart we will have church
[1:57:32] Wednesday night
[1:57:33] because I'm more afraid of the sin
[1:57:35] disease than I am of the disease out
[1:57:38] here I'm more desirous to be in the
[1:57:42] presence of the Lord than I am in the
[1:57:45] fear of the devil
[1:57:47] hallelujah so Wednesday night 7:30 in
[1:57:50] case' any of you amen
[1:57:53] as I said earlier I don't take that back
[1:57:55] we want to use wisdom we want God's
[1:57:56] guidance we want to be good stewards and
[1:58:00] but I believe we also follow the
[1:58:03] leadership of the Lord amen so you know
[1:58:06] what you know you think about that sin
[1:58:09] disease well just take the whole world a
[1:58:11] couple of blinders on take the whole
[1:58:14] world just give me Jesus that's what I
[1:58:18] want to see I want to see Jesus
[1:58:19] hallelujah
[1:58:21] well Alleluia know there's something
[1:58:24] brother Chris sadness I got to get it
[1:58:25] off my chest here you know reminds me of
[1:58:29] a little story I read in history I
[1:58:31] believe it was World War one between the
[1:58:34] French and the Germans and the Germans
[1:58:37] were sending soldiers and they were
[1:58:40] creeping and crawling in the darkness of
[1:58:43] night and the fog and they were I hate
[1:58:47] to bring this up in church this way but
[1:58:49] they were slipping into the lines and
[1:58:51] they were killing these French soldiers
[1:58:53] so a buddy might wake up in the morning
[1:58:56] maybe had fallen asleep at his post of
[1:58:58] duty and his friend beside him had been
[1:59:03] mandated to death in the darkness of the
[1:59:06] night
[1:59:07] and it instilled a fear into the heart
[1:59:11] of these soldiers their testimony become
[1:59:16] the enemy is behind our lines in other
[1:59:20] words we're completely the enemy is
[1:59:22] everywhere we don't know where the enemy
[1:59:23] is at in the very earliest hours this
[1:59:29] was a time at there that that the fog a
[1:59:33] season the weather the fog would settle
[1:59:35] in you couldn't hardly see and the
[1:59:37] Germans after having done this for many
[1:59:40] days creeping into the lines and killing
[1:59:42] these French soldiers and one morning in
[1:59:45] the darkness and the fog of the early
[1:59:48] morning the Germans started clamoring
[1:59:50] and blowing their their horns they still
[1:59:53] use them in those days many times they
[1:59:55] blew their horns and the the French
[1:59:57] understood that was the horn that said
[2:00:00] charge attack and the French because
[2:00:04] fear had permeated their lives they
[2:00:09] didn't rise up out of the trench and
[2:00:11] fight they rose up out of the trench and
[2:00:13] ran my brother and sister you might say
[2:00:17] well we've we've had some tough times
[2:00:19] brother Paul maybe in my life my family

[2:06:26] forgot to announce earlier was on my
[2:06:28] list and I forgot to announce it our
[2:06:30] brother doing fair will not be able to
[2:06:33] be with us this next weekend is they
[2:06:36] won't let him across the border now it's
[2:06:39] funny what has happened in our nation
[2:06:41] that my brother and sister will turn
[2:06:44] heaven and earth will plow the highways
[2:06:46] will do everything for some social
[2:06:49] events some sporting event or whatever
[2:06:51] and I'm just amazed at the condition of
[2:06:53] our country when they say that a
[2:06:55] minister going to preach the gospel it's
[2:06:57] not essential but that's where they
[2:07:01] stand and brother Dwayne won't be able
[2:07:03] to come because they won't let him
[2:07:04] across the border so I kind of you know
[2:07:08] sometimes I won't call it the spirit of
[2:07:10] fear but you kind of like well we'll
[2:07:11] pull back so that's what I'd like to
[2:07:13] announce we won't have young people's
[2:07:16] again on Friday night
[2:07:17] kind of a special event that we were
[2:07:19] having with our brother Dwayne here as a
[2:07:22] real burden for young people so I have a
[2:07:25] real burden for young people so we're
[2:07:26] gonna have prayer meeting this Friday
[2:07:28] night for all who can make it all who
[2:07:31] desire

[2:07:34] able to come we're not looking down on
[2:07:37] you but I encourage you make the effort
[2:07:41] make the effort amen when we were just
[2:07:44] down in Phoenix I preached on reaction I
[2:07:47] won't say too much because I might
[2:07:49] actually preach that same thought here
[2:07:51] but my brother and sister if you want a
[2:07:53] reaction out of God you've got to put a
[2:07:56] little action into it
[2:07:58] amen the prophet of God speaks on that
[2:08:01] he talks about them stepping out in the
[2:08:02] prayer line now those of who have made
[2:08:04] the action to step out to receive their
[2:08:07] healing you watch the reaction so I just
[2:08:12] say to you Saints this morning
[2:08:14] you want God to do something put some
[2:08:18] action put some action don't sit in the
