[29:24] as the shackles of sin
[29:26] doubt
[29:28] brother trevor i'm telling you there's a
[29:30] time that fear strikes the heart of
[29:32] every man
[29:34] but this
[29:35] fear that we would feel preparation
[29:37] might be another word for it we feel in
[29:39] the flesh
[29:40] is not what's associated with our soul
[29:44] amen
[29:45] reminded me of a time many years ago our
[29:48] kids were little we visited the grand
[29:49] canyon you know how kids are they just
[29:51] go trucking up there and they
[29:54] and i can remember i'm still about 10
[29:56] feet away and it's like
[30:02] and then when they turn around go dad
[30:04] isn't it beautiful you're like
[30:09] well that's not what our soul should
[30:11] experience
[30:13] our soul should be able to say
[30:15] it's mine
[30:17] morning new night no matter what's
[30:19] happening it's mine amen
[30:22] amen now
[30:24] sister sophie
[30:26] i believe is is it joshua come and
[30:28] visited us
[30:33] okay okay
[30:35] is he related to you somehow
[30:39] distant do you claim him
[30:43] anyway he asked me
[30:46] to
[30:46] uh if we as a church would just remember
[30:49] him in prayer
[30:50] amen had a nice little conversation with
[30:53] him the other day seems like a fine
[30:55] young man
[30:56] just pray he was going to take a a trip
[30:59] i don't know what happens here what the
[31:01] deal is but he said he was going to go
[31:03] to africa because there was some girl
[31:05] that he
[31:06] was attracted to or something
[31:09] and
[31:10] so just desired our prayers amen i just
[31:12] don't know how that goes now i don't
[31:15] know how to word this because i don't
[31:16] want to just blurt it all over the
[31:17] internet but
[31:19] sister tomah's brother
[31:21] brother roman
[31:23] was staying with a brother in germany
[31:26] and the brother in germany contacted him
[31:28] and says i don't feel good
[31:30] so if you were planning to go to the
[31:32] airport tonight to see brother roman
[31:34] don't
[31:36] don't knock
[31:37] you might call because that won't matter
[31:39] but
[31:40] anyway just uh
[31:42] there's there's the possibilities and
[31:44] whatever and so brother vasily called me
[31:47] this afternoon and said please just
[31:49] uh
[31:50] because he knew sister jerry and i was
[31:52] going to drive to the airport tonight to
[31:53] greet him he's like please no one come
[31:56] so anyway we'll just leave that at that
[31:58] okay everybody got the message
[32:01] amen well isn't it good to be in the
[32:03] house of the lord tonight
[32:05] amen
[32:06] somebody said amen amen amen
[32:10] so as we look at this i want to speak to
[32:13] you once again a continuation of what we
[32:16] spoke on thank you musicians i
[32:18] appreciate that so much
[32:20] you know the other day
[32:22] sunday
[32:24] just
[32:24] was thinking about how beautiful it is
[32:27] we have
[32:28] talent
[32:29] we only have two instruments because
[32:31] sister heidi is a wall on the job
[32:34] and um
[32:35] but anyway i remember the days when
[32:38] when we sang a cappella a lot
[32:42] and
[32:43] i thank the lord for the musicians in
[32:45] our midst and the beautiful voices amen
[32:49] i want to speak to you once again
[32:51] tonight on our present circumstances
[32:54] and if i would title this tonight
[32:56] drawing this out
[32:58] uh of the scriptures uh i would i would
[33:02] give a title to it god hath
[33:04] chosen
[33:05] and uh you know isn't it wonderful when
[33:08] we realized that it wasn't us making
[33:11] these decisions we we feel like it was
[33:14] we want to say it was and and it's
[33:16] interesting on one part you got people
[33:19] on the far of the spectrum saying and i
[33:22] and i and i and i and they mean it
[33:25] literally like as though they accomplish
[33:27] something then the other end of this
[33:29] spectrum is is it couldn't possibly be
[33:34] i
[33:36] but we have to find the balance and the
[33:39] prophet of god come
[33:41] laid a balance out for us aren't you
[33:43] glad tonight we can have balance
[33:45] amen we don't have to fall off amen
[33:48] happy to see our brother scott i know
[33:50] he's here the other day but you know
[33:52] just this whole covert thing it's kind
[33:54] of like being out in the world right
[33:56] everywhere you go you're going to rub
[33:57] shoulders with the world but we as
[34:00] believers can just claim deliverance
[34:02] from this protection from this amen you
[34:05] know this might not be as fearful
[34:08] as what daniel experienced in the lion's
[34:11] den and then that brings up a whole deal
[34:14] did daniel experience fear in the lion's
[34:17] den
[34:18] i'm going to say that he did
[34:21] that there is that human element
[34:24] that when a lion roars
[34:27] it would cause us to shake
[34:29] but did you know that sometimes and and
[34:32] i won't go into this tonight it's not
[34:33] our topic but did you know that
[34:35] sometimes god allows us and i would say
[34:38] a lot of times let me put the god allows
[34:41] you to experience
[34:44] first
[34:46] and then
[34:47] faith kicks in
[34:49] we don't walk into the situation i'm
[34:51] untouchable
[34:53] no sir we walk into that we're human
[34:56] we walk into that but when the lion
[34:58] roars when the circumstances come then
[35:02] faith kicks in and we realize i have no
[35:04] other alternative but to trust the lord
[35:07] and that in itself i believe is a great
[35:09] revelation that when you have a multiple
[35:12] we'll be talking about some decisions
[35:13] tonight when you have a multitude of
[35:16] decisions to make to be able to stop and
[35:19] single them out and say my decision is
[35:21] to trust the lord my decision is to
[35:24] believe the word that is a great
[35:26] revelation my brother and sister because
[35:28] we've been given in the world we live in
[35:30] tons and tons of
[35:32] options
[35:34] but the bride of christ always chooses
[35:37] her bridegroom
[35:39] never chooses another
[35:41] she's not looking i'm getting ahead of
[35:43] myself amen
[35:44] let's just go here
[35:45] and look at this now i want to say this
[35:48] this kind of a repeat from last
[35:49] wednesday
[35:51] as we speak on these present conditions
[35:53] we're not going to
[35:55] look at or focus as it were on the
[35:58] condition of the world
[36:00] we have the sideline of the condition of
[36:02] what the world is we see how the
[36:04] scripture and we're seeing how it's
[36:06] manifested and it all it isn't always
[36:08] manifested the same way we thought it
[36:09] would be
[36:10] but god's doing it anyhow amen and then
[36:13] we see and we're not looking at what the
[36:16] nations are doing my brother and sister
[36:18] we're we're seeing how that the nations
[36:21] are being tossed and driven as it were
[36:24] and the winds upon the sea and a nation
[36:26] says we're not and then something
[36:28] happens and they do and so that goes
[36:30] both ways where we're not looking grace
[36:33] tabernacle tonight is not looking at
[36:35] what other churches in the message are
[36:37] doing
[36:39] can't say well they seem spiritual will
[36:42] follow in their footsteps we need to be
[36:45] prayed through saints that we as grace
[36:48] tabernacle not a different vision than
[36:50] the word has but we as grace tabernacle
[36:53] have our vision
[36:55] that we are on track in the mind of god
[36:58] moving forward not always playing follow
[37:01] the leader as it were and we'll also
[37:03] talk about leaders but you look at this
[37:05] my brother and sister that we were
[37:07] called as a sovereign body of believers
[37:11] to find our own entrance into the throne
[37:14] room of almighty god to find our own
[37:17] place that we stand face to face with
[37:19] the revealed word and it coming forth
[37:22] and my brother and sister it is not a
[37:24] time that god says nope nope all of the
[37:27] things that's left in the word must have
[37:29] an interpretation
[37:31] do you realize the interpretation is
[37:33] given because the word is of no private
[37:35] interpretation so the word's already
[37:37] been broke open
[37:39] it's already been broke open and then we
[37:41] as the eagles of the age know what to do
[37:45] with the word that's been revealed to us
[37:47] we don't sit there and look at it you
[37:49] know brother brown talking about the
[37:50] buzzards sitting on the limb looking
[37:52] down you know of what that is waiting
[37:55] for it to get cooked enough on the
[37:56] highway
[37:59] but we as the bride know when the word's
[38:01] been opened to us what to do with it now
[38:04] we're going to preach on that tonight oh
[38:05] my we got a lot to preach on i better
[38:07] get going hallelujah
[38:09] amen but what we as believers are doing
[38:12] in this present age is what we need to
[38:14] focus on
[38:15] that's what's important to us not what
[38:17] they're doing
[38:19] but what are we doing
[38:21] and i say lord let us dig into the word
[38:24] amen let us oh i hope this doesn't sound
[38:26] grotesque to you but let us dig in so
[38:29] deep that when we raise our head back up
[38:31] we have got the blood all over us not
[38:34] dainty eaters
[38:37] not dainty eaters my brother and sister
[38:39] let's dig into the word of god
[38:42] hallelujah
[38:43] hallelujah
[38:45] ephesians the fifth chapter
[38:47] and this is the same
[38:48] scripture we used last wednesday just
[38:50] want to to build upon that a little bit
[38:58] i love this i love ephesians five it's
[39:01] uh it's a wonderful
[39:02] piece of scripture that speaks to the
[39:05] heart
[39:06] let no man deceive you with vain words
[39:11] for because of these things cometh the
[39:14] wrath of god upon the children of
[39:16] disobedience in other words replacing
[39:19] the pure word with vanity
[39:22] and vanity in this case would be the
[39:24] preacher
[39:26] singular plural whatever it might be
[39:29] ministry
[39:30] making you feel good about yourself
[39:33] while ignoring
[39:36] the glaring air
[39:39] in other words looking in the mirror of
[39:41] god's word and say don't worry about
[39:43] that
[39:43] go by your emotion
[39:46] do you feel like a christian
[39:49] well let's not answer that because i
[39:51] could tell you some days leave you not
[39:53] even feeling
[39:54] like a christian so the vanity side says
[39:58] oh you know everything's fine-tuned you
[40:00] know and so perfect and oh and this and
[40:03] make you feel good a little chuckle and
[40:05] a little humor and a little something
[40:08] and
[40:09] and
[40:10] half of those people sitting there in
[40:12] that crowd
[40:13] they don't know if they're in or out up
[40:15] or down
[40:16] but when they go there
[40:18] a good motivational speech
[40:21] have you have any of you ever gone to a
[40:23] motivational speech
[40:25] i'm telling you you can see these
[40:27] multi-level marketing deals those guys
[40:29] have mastered that and you walk in
[40:31] they're a skeptic and you walk out
[40:33] saying wow i only had to give them 1200
[40:36] and i'm gonna be a millionaire
[40:39] six months later they can't even find
[40:41] the literature the wife has thrown it
[40:43] out the kids have scribbled on it and
[40:45] they could care less don't ever mention
[40:46] uh mlm to me ever again
[40:49] and the guy who became a millionaire was
[40:52] the guy who was standing up front
[40:54] but for that moment
[40:56] they all felt
[40:58] like they could conquer
[41:00] they're going to convert everyone at
[41:02] work every one of their relatives
[41:05] everyone in their coldest sac forget the
[41:07] cul-de-sac this whole subdivision
[41:11] but then door after door and rejection
[41:13] and all these issues and they realize
[41:14] that they hate speaking to people
[41:17] and they are not going to spend the rest
[41:19] of their life inviting 20 people at a
[41:21] time to their house for tea and crumpets
[41:26] but yet that spirit invaded the church
[41:34] okay i better get going
[41:40] be not therefore partakers with them for
[41:42] years sometimes darkness but now
[41:45] can someone say now
[41:48] but now are ye
[41:50] light in the lord walk
[41:54] as children of light what an instruction
[41:56] right there just start walking but walk
[41:58] as children of light
[42:00] for the fruit of the spirit is in all
[42:02] goodness and righteousness and truth
[42:04] proving what is acceptable unto the lord
[42:09] and have no fellowship with the
[42:11] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[42:13] reprove them isn't it amazing though
[42:16] sometimes in the public realm
[42:19] we
[42:20] and i include myself oftentimes
[42:23] feel compelled
[42:24] to just be silent
[42:28] and the devil comes along and says see
[42:31] you don't have any courage
[42:33] but did you know
[42:35] the atmosphere you put off
[42:40] it's the atmosphere you put off did you
[42:42] know it's the atmosphere you put off is
[42:44] why you can touch the screen of your
[42:47] smartphone
[42:48] and cause it to react to each key
[42:52] it is sensing i don't know the right
[42:54] term so forgive me if i don't have it
[42:55] but it's sensing the energy in you it's
[42:58] it's drawing an energy to you that
[43:00] connects it to that key because how can
[43:02] you have a piece of glass over the key
[43:04] uh the face of your phone and be it like
[43:07] you're dimpling it no it's not it's the
[43:09] energy
[43:11] so you have energy in you and if your
[43:13] energy is there submitted to the lord
[43:16] and these things are happening your
[43:18] energy will then be fighting but it's
[43:20] not you it's the lord that fights the
[43:23] battle
[43:24] it's not us that has to make a statement
[43:27] but it's god in us that is there
[43:29] declaring and pushing back against
[43:31] laodicea
[43:33] thank you lord i love that
[43:36] amen
[43:38] and have no fellowship with unfruitful
[43:40] works of darkness but rather reprove
[43:42] them for it is a shame even to speak of
[43:45] those things which are done of them in
[43:48] secret but all things that are reproved
[43:52] sorry about that brother alex but all
[43:55] things that are reproved are made
[43:57] manifest by the light
[43:59] for whatsoever doth make manifest is
[44:02] light
[44:02] wherefore he saith awake thou that
[44:05] sleepless and i say that tonight let's
[44:08] awake church and if we're not on fire
[44:10] for god let's get on fire for god let's
[44:13] let's not be taking a nap as it were but
[44:16] let's be on fire and arise from the dead
[44:19] and christ shall give thee light see
[44:21] then that ye walk circumspectly not as
[44:24] fools but as wise redeeming the time so
[44:28] one of the things of wisdom is redeeming
[44:32] the time
[44:33] because the days are evil
[44:36] wherefore be not unwise but
[44:39] understanding what the will of the lord
[44:41] is and i would just ask a question is it
[44:43] not our hearts desire to do the will of
[44:47] god to know the will of god walk in his
[44:50] will
[44:51] live in that in this world to live in
[44:54] the will of god
[44:55] heavenly father we thank you tonight
[44:58] lord just help us to be concise
[45:00] lord and clear
[45:02] bless the saints i pray today in your
[45:04] name amen you may be seated
[45:10] now i read the definition of circumspect
[45:12] the other day but i just want to um just
[45:14] touch on it again very quickly thinking
[45:17] carefully about possible risks before
[45:19] doing or saying something it is also
[45:21] careful to consider all circumstance and
[45:24] possible consequence to be prudent
[45:28] to be cautious
[45:30] now my brother and sister
[45:32] do think carefully
[45:34] is something that we can do and you know
[45:37] sometimes satan comes and anoints people
[45:40] you know they they have tried for years
[45:42] to place this overall uh title or
[45:46] umbrella over the message calling it a
[45:48] cult and and you know people then when
[45:51] they go to the internet i have dealt
[45:53] with some people before that they're
[45:55] like hey i went and looked up your
[45:56] church and i think you're really fine
[45:58] people but and you know because
[46:01] everything on the internet is true in
[46:02] fact i mean george washington said so so
[46:05] it's there that we look at this that
[46:07] sometimes people become so cautious
[46:09] because they're afraid of the
[46:11] consequence of being tied to something
[46:14] but aren't you glad by the grace of god
[46:17] that we have found a liberty to look
[46:20] into the perfect word of god and it
[46:23] bringing the liberty in fact it has
[46:25] brought so much liberty that we are not
[46:28] looking my brother and sister for a
[46:30] deliverance as it were from a physical
[46:33] body but we as a sons and daughters of
[46:35] god are looking for a deliverance in the
[46:38] spirit realm to our spirit being the
[46:41] spirit of god desires to be united back
[46:44] together again and it's not a uniting
[46:47] that makes us come and give some
[46:49] unwavering support for some kind of a
[46:51] building or a program or a man or a
[46:54] personality as some kind of group but
[46:57] it's there that god is working upon us
[46:59] as individuals now if you can be in a
[47:03] cult and think and act as an individual
[47:06] that's not a very strong cult in fact
[47:08] i've said it before i say it again this
[47:10] is a worse managed cult on the face of
[47:12] the earth
[47:14] they have they're just doing a terrible
[47:15] job about forcing everyone to follow
[47:18] their ideology but when we come into a
[47:21] place and i'm a little ahead of myself
[47:22] but it'll be fine we come to a place
[47:25] that there's another leadership in our
[47:26] life there's something that's stirring
[47:28] us there's something that's drawing and
[47:31] we use the word compel but sometimes the
[47:33] word compel can be used in actually the
[47:36] opposite effect so we'll kind of just
[47:38] waver on the use of the word compel but
[47:40] we'll touch again here in a minute my
[47:43] brother and sister now look at this
[47:45] we're not moved by the fear of being
[47:47] wrong that's right
[47:49] amen
[47:50] we're not moved by the fear of being
[47:52] wrong because the word of god
[47:56] said i will lead you
[47:57] and guide you okay if we have a leader
[48:00] we're in the wilderness or we're in the
[48:02] jungle and we've got a leader that knows
[48:05] where it's going
[48:06] knows where we need to go and knows the
[48:08] best way to get us there and we have
[48:10] full confidence that and he said i will
[48:13] lead you
[48:15] so our job then is not to question that
[48:17] leadership our job is to follow
[48:20] our job is to not get so far away from
[48:23] him that he turns right or left or a
[48:26] crook in the trail and we're there then
[48:28] lost
[48:29] no my brother and sister we've already
[48:31] been redeemed from being lost now what
[48:33] we got to do is follow and i say lord
[48:36] help us to just stay as close as we can
[48:38] to you lord that you would lead us and
[48:41] guide us into all truth and my brother
[48:43] and sister if we can believe there's a
[48:45] rapture
[48:46] and if we can believe that there is a
[48:48] word for our hour then we should be able
[48:51] to
[48:51] believe and stand with full confidence
[48:54] in the fact that god through the
[48:56] leadership of the holy spirit will lead
[48:57] us and guide us to all truth
[49:00] my brother and sister it is a spirit of
[49:02] fear when people come and they're afraid
[49:06] they're afraid well you know there's
[49:07] going to be wolves in sheep's clothing
[49:11] how about you just turn your wolf
[49:13] detector on
[49:15] there's going to be those seducing
[49:17] spirits
[49:18] turn on your seducing spirit detector
[49:22] there's going to be those that twist the
[49:24] word then turn on your twisted word
[49:26] detector
[49:28] amen this is called the holy ghost
[49:31] amen this is not something manufactured
[49:33] by somebody this is something that god
[49:36] didn't even it's not even manufactured
[49:38] in you you know that it was deposited in
[49:41] you
[49:42] amen god didn't come along and say i
[49:44] need a little of this and i need a
[49:45] little of this and i need a little of
[49:46] this god said i have placed in you as a
[49:49] prophet put these words everything you
[49:52] need to make the rapture
[49:55] amen so we don't got to go through life
[49:57] well i need to run over here because
[49:59] they've got a new startling doctrine i
[50:01] need to run over here because they've
[50:02] got a profound statement over here i
[50:04] need to run down here because this
[50:06] person has personality i need to run
[50:08] over here because they're flamboyant no
[50:11] you got to run to the one that said i'll
[50:13] lead you
[50:15] and when you get in that presence you
[50:16] don't have to worry about getting lost
[50:18] in a jungle in a desert in a mountain
[50:21] place or a canyon you don't have to get
[50:23] lo worry about getting lost in the
[50:25] avenues of laodicea
[50:27] he's there
[50:29] hallelujah
[50:31] and we have a spirit that's come upon
[50:33] the message my brother and sister it's a
[50:35] spirit of fear people are afraid well i
[50:37] don't know i don't understand that so
[50:39] instead of we were discussing this the
[50:41] other day instead of putting this on the
[50:43] shelf and saying lord you'll reveal it
[50:46] they just get afraid of it and run
[50:49] that's right and when they run from my
[50:51] brother and sister they never seek the
[50:52] mind of god for the revelation of what
[50:54] that is
[50:56] because you know
[50:57] most of the time what these doctrines
[50:59] are are truth with just a little bit of
[51:02] seed of discrepancy throat in there
[51:05] now imagine some people will throw
[51:08] 99.9 percent truth out because they're
[51:11] afraid of the one-tenth of the
[51:13] discrepancy instead of going into the
[51:16] word and saying lord reveal this to me
[51:18] and when you see the discrepancy it will
[51:21] never move you in the wrong direction
[51:23] ever again in your life you have nothing
[51:25] to be afraid of
[51:26] but people say well well i don't know
[51:28] i'm afraid of this i'm afraid of that
[51:31] they never preached this to me when i
[51:32] was a youngster i've never heard that
[51:34] preached before well my brother and
[51:36] sister i'll tell you how that works i
[51:38] was up in a place one time hold some
[51:40] meetings and i was really tired we
[51:42] traveled and and i'm in a room and i i
[51:46] simply just had no energy and i said
[51:49] lord you know what um i just need you
[51:51] and the lord led me to a scripture we
[51:53] won't go there tonight but the lord led
[51:54] me to a scripture and i'm there on my
[51:57] knees with my head on the bed and and i
[51:59] i just was thinking and it was like open
[52:02] up your bible open my bible the lord led
[52:04] me to a scripture i preached it that
[52:06] night it stirred people's hearts not
[52:08] paul doing it the holy spirit doing that
[52:11] and then the response of some that were
[52:13] there was
[52:14] i looked it up while you were speaking
[52:17] and brother branham never once preached
[52:19] on that scripture
[52:23] okay
[52:24] was it real or not
[52:26] was it true
[52:30] it was scripture
[52:33] there was another paul that wrote it but
[52:34] it wasn't this paul
[52:37] but you see people get so caught up are
[52:39] you with me so caught up it's relevant
[52:42] if they can find it in a sermon in a
[52:44] quote in a word phrase and they'll
[52:47] believe that but if it's the word and
[52:50] it's not there then they are not going
[52:52] to touch it even though it come directly
[52:54] from their bible
[52:56] spirit of fear coming in
[52:58] amen
[52:59] ruled by this spirit of being wrong
[53:01] afraid of being wrong
[53:03] and i understand that we want to be
[53:05] right tonight don't we
[53:06] amen but we have a spirit of liberty and
[53:09] i've got a father who has said i will
[53:12] open my word to you and the mystery of
[53:16] christ will be revealed before his
[53:19] return and so i have no fear because i
[53:22] have a guide who said don't go that way
[53:25] come this way don't do that and will
[53:28] come and take scripture and show you
[53:31] because people say well i don't know i
[53:32] think that scripture might not be right
[53:34] hello
[53:36] no all scripture is given
[53:39] all scripture is given it's our
[53:41] interpretation
[53:43] it's our understanding
[53:45] how we view it
[53:46] so we don't need to pray that the
[53:48] scripture would be added or taken away
[53:50] we need to pray lord give me your mind
[53:52] so i can see what you were saying here
[53:54] amen you see because we don't want to be
[53:57] constrained by the word
[54:00] now the word constrain
[54:02] in the dictionary actually has a very
[54:04] short definition it means forced
[54:07] we don't want to be forced by the word
[54:08] that's not what it's about my brother
[54:10] and sister being forced oh
[54:12] oh oh the bible says i can't lie
[54:15] i guess i have to stop lying
[54:19] that's being constrained that person
[54:20] will not survive the test of time in
[54:22] laodicea
[54:26] sounds judgmental i don't mean it to be
[54:30] but if you're constrained by the word my
[54:31] brother and sister then you were forced
[54:33] into conforming to something
[54:37] and that's oftentimes it sounds a little
[54:39] critical but i'm just going to say it
[54:40] anyhow that's where you see some of
[54:42] these testimonies well i was raised in a
[54:44] message home young people please listen
[54:46] i was raised in a message church
[54:49] in a message home and i was forced
[54:53] never a relationship with the lord
[54:56] never a mention about god stirring their
[54:58] heart god leading them to truth it's i
[55:02] was forced
[55:04] i was forced
[55:06] and soon as i could i was 18 i broke
[55:09] free from that
[55:11] so that i could act like the rest of the
[55:12] world
[55:14] you see not to be constrained by the
[55:16] word or by man
[55:19] i pray never comes across
[55:22] and i say this here again tonight
[55:23] especially to our young people i want
[55:25] you to never think brother paul is
[55:27] trying to force you
[55:29] what i want you to do is volunteer
[55:31] yourself to the lord and say lord open
[55:34] and shine the light on me
[55:36] because the light is what makes all
[55:38] things manifest it's the light that
[55:40] makes it all real
[55:43] my brother and sister we can go
[55:45] you know it's um it i won't go there no
[55:49] that's not good don't go there paul
[55:51] but but you look at this see we're not
[55:54] looking for the forcing in fact the
[55:57] prophet of god said the holy spirit is a
[55:59] gentleman and so the gentleman
[56:02] would never force you
[56:05] now this is a funny but not so funny
[56:06] story
[56:07] this man was raised as a gentleman he
[56:10] spent a lot of years in the military
[56:11] once again they reinforced that behavior
[56:14] and he's walking into a building had a
[56:16] big heavy glass door and as he walks in
[56:19] his wife is with him he opened the door
[56:21] for her to pass through sees this lady
[56:24] coming and he's holding the door and
[56:26] this woman starts in on what i guess you
[56:28] would call a feminist rant and she's
[56:30] like why would you think i need you
[56:34] to hold a door for me
[56:37] and he thought about it a second and
[56:38] just stepped through and let go of the
[56:40] door only while she said one thing she
[56:43] acted on another anyway she got crunked
[56:46] in the head and squeezed between the two
[56:48] big glass doors and then she was angry
[56:50] because you did that on purpose and he
[56:52] says no i was responding to your words
[56:55] that you didn't need me
[56:57] i didn't come as and it's quite profound
[57:00] i didn't come as the man in your life i
[57:03] come as a gentleman in the life of my
[57:06] wife but it didn't stop at my wife
[57:12] broke the heel on her high-heeled shoes
[57:14] that's why sisters y'all not wear them
[57:16] things
[57:17] you'll bust them in the door
[57:21] i could say some more words there but
[57:23] i'll just choke them
[57:25] back down
[57:27] you see
[57:29] compelled is a very similar word
[57:30] denoting a certain degree of force
[57:34] but my brother and sister who we are no
[57:37] matter what the circumstance of our age
[57:39] is who we are is a people that is moved
[57:43] by the presence of almighty god we are a
[57:46] people that are moved by the holy ghost
[57:49] that is not what should move us emotion
[57:52] is present when the holy spirit is
[57:54] moving but emotion should not be the
[57:56] factor that moves us it should be the
[57:58] presence of almighty god just as i spoke
[58:01] to you here a few weeks ago i don't
[58:03] remember exactly when but you can have a
[58:05] day that you don't want to relive a day
[58:08] that everything goes wrong you have a
[58:10] headache your back hurts your this that
[58:12] and the other and you go and somehow you
[58:14] walk in the doors of the church and you
[58:17] sit down and your thought is i should
[58:19] have stayed home until the presence of
[58:22] almighty god moves around you and
[58:26] suddenly you have a revival going on
[58:29] suddenly that spirit that was tormenting
[58:31] you all day over something you said or
[58:33] did or somebody said and did to you is
[58:36] suddenly gone why because we've come
[58:38] into the presence of almighty god and he
[58:41] is a prince of peace
[58:43] and we know that presence when it comes
[58:46] and settles upon us we can honestly
[58:48] without a single person people say well
[58:51] i just noticed
[58:52] not church these are real words of
[58:54] critics i just notice in that church
[58:57] it's when the song leader or the
[58:58] preacher says do you feel the presence
[59:00] everybody's
[59:02] like they're just puppets
[59:06] well i'll tell you what it is
[59:09] can i be real tonight
[59:11] what it is is we're sitting there
[59:13] the presence of god is working on us
[59:16] working on us
[59:18] and what went wrong today
[59:20] this broke and that broke and this
[59:22] didn't work and this problem
[59:26] and the children are misbehaving
[59:30] got a smile out of them
[59:33] but we walk in here
[59:35] and the presence of god starts to wash
[59:37] and scrub
[59:40] and maybe the minister or the song
[59:41] leader does say
[59:43] do you feel the presence of the lord
[59:44] let's worship him but all that is is a
[59:47] catalyst like a key that causes us to
[59:49] just go ahead and break that last bit of
[59:51] bondage and lift our hands but you see
[59:54] people
[59:56] that have never been there
[59:58] don't know all they can do is take that
[1:00:01] back and place it in a carnal realm and
[1:00:04] say this is what i've experienced
[1:00:08] you know like at a ball game
[1:00:10] not that i go to them haven't been to
[1:00:12] one or watched one or done much but you
[1:00:14] know the ball game
[1:00:16] they look out in the stands and all the
[1:00:18] fans you know
[1:00:22] well what do they do that let's do a
[1:00:25] wave
[1:00:26] all of a sudden an announcer is like
[1:00:28] let's do a wave
[1:00:30] you've got 25 000 people that are
[1:00:32] watching their favorite team be beat up
[1:00:37] but they still got something in them yes
[1:00:40] a wave
[1:00:42] and they jump up
[1:00:44] yes
[1:00:48] knock over their popcorn their hot dog
[1:00:50] and everything else that they're doing
[1:00:52] trip and fall over the seat backwards
[1:00:54] but i wasn't that so nice
[1:01:02] but the holy ghost comes
[1:01:05] give it liberty we don't have to say
[1:01:07] let's have a wave
[1:01:08] you know that might be something we
[1:01:10] ought to introduce let's start right
[1:01:12] over here
[1:01:15] and right after we get up from the altar
[1:01:17] we'll give a wave
[1:01:21] oh forgive me my terrible humor
[1:01:24] but you see what happened
[1:01:26] people don't they don't understand
[1:01:28] because they're used to being
[1:01:29] constrained
[1:01:31] they're used to being kind of led into
[1:01:33] this
[1:01:34] but you see the redeemed come to a place
[1:01:37] that the word is alive to them and
[1:01:38] something starts bubbling up inside of
[1:01:40] them maybe it is the preaching of the
[1:01:42] word that's doing it but that's
[1:01:44] irrelevant because they're recognizing
[1:01:46] christ is here the holy ghost is moving
[1:01:48] in our myth and he wants to be
[1:01:50] manifested in me and i want him to be
[1:01:53] manifested in me and i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:01:55] react to that moving of the holy spirit
[1:01:58] and so we start to come because you see
[1:02:00] my brother and sister we have a present
[1:02:02] circumstance can you say amen to that
[1:02:05] and it's either going to be we're in the
[1:02:06] circumstance of laodicea or in the
[1:02:09] circumstance of a revealed word that has
[1:02:12] come in our hour and we're going to
[1:02:13] choose what circumstance becomes our
[1:02:16] guiding light becomes our our governing
[1:02:18] force amen so you look at this my
[1:02:21] brother and sister
[1:02:24] it's a dynamic the leadership of the
[1:02:25] holy spirit moving in our midst is a
[1:02:27] dynamic the world can understand
[1:02:30] in fact it's a dynamic that many people
[1:02:32] with the title of christian don't
[1:02:34] understand they get excited we had a
[1:02:37] visitor one time i was always sad she
[1:02:39] never came back she said i will see you
[1:02:41] in a couple weeks she drove truck for a
[1:02:42] living
[1:02:44] i'll see you in a couple weeks
[1:02:46] she said i so enjoyed the sermon today
[1:02:48] it touched my heart i just been reading
[1:02:50] a scripture and she said and one of the
[1:02:52] best things about this church and this
[1:02:54] atmosphere here is the lights were on
[1:02:56] and i was in a mushroom growing in the
[1:02:58] dark
[1:03:00] but why is that spirit my brother and
[1:03:02] sister
[1:03:04] what spirit likes darkness
[1:03:07] what moves in the darkness now the holy
[1:03:09] ghost can move anywhere anytime any
[1:03:11] place but we're looking at the overall
[1:03:12] picture what is the spirit that likes
[1:03:15] darkness and what does the word testify
[1:03:18] of and that's where all of our churches
[1:03:20] are going darkness light strobes and all
[1:03:24] of this kind of stuff i i clicked on a
[1:03:26] deal the other day i just thought well i
[1:03:28] want to see where where this church is
[1:03:30] going well i didn't have to look very
[1:03:32] far to figure out where they're going my
[1:03:33] brother and sister i didn't know if it
[1:03:35] was church or a rock concert
[1:03:38] that's how far they've gone that's right
[1:03:40] here in this valley
[1:03:42] amen now look did you know
[1:03:45] that all christians are followers
[1:03:50] now we live in a world that everybody's
[1:03:52] saying i want my own identity
[1:03:54] now pardon me i don't mean to make fun
[1:03:57] of this but it's a good example
[1:03:59] they're wearing their shirt untucked
[1:04:01] with a t-shirt underneath and kind of a
[1:04:04] flannel shirt with either the sleeves
[1:04:05] cut off or rolled up
[1:04:07] and their belt
[1:04:09] now this is a miracle they they must
[1:04:11] have you know
[1:04:12] kind of like
[1:04:13] oh i shouldn't even say that anyway
[1:04:16] but they must have some kind of inner
[1:04:18] hidden suspenders because their belt is
[1:04:20] wrapped right here
[1:04:23] and i just watched the other day i
[1:04:24] stopped and got gas and the the deal
[1:04:26] that wouldn't work right i had to go
[1:04:28] inside the store
[1:04:29] and i got quite an eye opening in there
[1:04:32] and uh here's a man big burly muscular
[1:04:34] guy and and he stand there at the
[1:04:36] counter nice he nodded his head smiled
[1:04:39] at me i was a lot better than a big guy
[1:04:41] growling at you
[1:04:42] and um anyway so he gathers up he had
[1:04:45] some i don't remember soda pop and some
[1:04:48] different stuff and some chips and he
[1:04:50] gathers that out and he goes over and he
[1:04:52] makes it as far as the door and he has
[1:04:54] to stop and go
[1:04:57] and then he went out and his pickup was
[1:04:59] parked down the parking lot and as he
[1:05:00] starts that direction he keeps having to
[1:05:02] stop and do that and then he drops one
[1:05:04] of the bottles and finally he's just
[1:05:06] holding this real precariously and just
[1:05:08] holds his pants up and just walks over
[1:05:10] there to his pickup
[1:05:12] i wish i'd had a video of that and i
[1:05:14] would have loved to have shown it to him
[1:05:15] in a moment of sanity
[1:05:18] a grown man my brother and sister
[1:05:21] so the spirit of the day see is
[1:05:23] anointing people to come in a condition
[1:05:26] that a grown man i say growing up i'm
[1:05:29] talking chronological age uh it would
[1:05:32] come and present himself in public like
[1:05:34] that now i want to take this a step
[1:05:36] further that we have those kind of
[1:05:39] spirits invading the church
[1:05:42] people are coming into the house of god
[1:05:44] no i would never wear pants cinched
[1:05:47] around my bottom with my bloomers
[1:05:49] showing i would never do this no what
[1:05:51] they will do is come into the church in
[1:05:54] flip-flops beach shorts a tank top with
[1:05:57] their little i wish that was in maui
[1:05:59] sunglasses
[1:06:01] and they believe they're honoring the
[1:06:02] house of god do you realize that man
[1:06:05] with his underwear showing
[1:06:07] dragging his pants along on the floor
[1:06:09] has just as much respect in the eyes of
[1:06:11] god as a man with million dollars coming
[1:06:14] to church and flip-flopping shorts
[1:06:16] see how darkness come in it just come in
[1:06:18] a different avenue the shadow is long
[1:06:21] over here it's short and dark over here
[1:06:23] and people say well i've got a little
[1:06:24] light my revelation well my brother and
[1:06:26] sister we're not looking for a little
[1:06:28] light we are looking for the light
[1:06:30] we are looking for the life that goes
[1:06:32] with the light
[1:06:34] hallelujah
[1:06:35] amen
[1:06:37] no christians are followers
[1:06:39] now you can look in your bible make a
[1:06:41] reference jesus repeatedly said follow
[1:06:44] me
[1:06:46] follow me
[1:06:47] follow me
[1:06:48] kind of paraphrasing it because the
[1:06:50] words are a little bit different but the
[1:06:51] apostle paul said follow me as i follow
[1:06:54] christ
[1:06:56] i think as the niv says imitate me as i
[1:06:59] imitate christ and people would say whoa
[1:07:01] that don't sound right but you got to
[1:07:03] get to the context they didn't really
[1:07:04] miss it that far whatever i'm doing in
[1:07:06] christ you do in christ
[1:07:10] if i put him as preeminent you put him
[1:07:12] as preeminent if i worship him you
[1:07:15] worship him if i ask him for healing you
[1:07:17] ask for healing it's not that far off to
[1:07:20] say the imitate part right but we're not
[1:07:22] talking about just being imitators we're
[1:07:24] talking about being real
[1:07:26] we're talking about having the substance
[1:07:28] of jesus christ
[1:07:30] amen so it's there jesus said follow me
[1:07:35] will we follow this advice
[1:07:37] we have a choice my brother and sister
[1:07:39] we have a choice in in the day in our
[1:07:41] present circumstance
[1:07:43] we live in the darkest age that was ever
[1:07:45] on the face of the earth my brother and
[1:07:47] sister and it's here that we have the
[1:07:50] option to
[1:07:52] follow to the minute degree of jesus
[1:07:56] advice follow me
[1:07:58] follow me follow me
[1:08:01] amen
[1:08:02] now some people would say well we
[1:08:04] believe that the bible is just an
[1:08:06] encouragement well to my heart it was a
[1:08:08] command
[1:08:10] it wasn't an option it wasn't uh you
[1:08:13] know maybe this will encourage you
[1:08:14] follow jesus
[1:08:16] in my heart i'm not going to speak for
[1:08:18] your heart you have to speak through
[1:08:19] your heart in my heart it was a command
[1:08:21] follow me and my heart responded oh you
[1:08:25] know what it is i mean i didn't give my
[1:08:26] heart back to the lord as a teenager i
[1:08:29] wasted a lot of years that if i could
[1:08:31] redeem that time i would pay the price
[1:08:33] to redeem that again but i can't
[1:08:37] but you look at that and i look at those
[1:08:39] things and i say oh lord that if i would
[1:08:41] have just followed you
[1:08:43] if i would have just followed you if i
[1:08:45] would have listened to my heart
[1:08:48] instead of
[1:08:50] man's words
[1:08:52] if i would listen to my heart instead of
[1:08:55] my peers
[1:08:57] if i'd listen to my heart
[1:09:00] instead of my worldly friends
[1:09:05] well paul you're a special case i'm sure
[1:09:07] i am sometimes they put the word basket
[1:09:09] in front of case
[1:09:11] but what i know is i won't trade what
[1:09:13] i've got for what they've got
[1:09:18] first corinthians
[1:09:20] 11
[1:09:22] says be followers of me
[1:09:24] even as i also am of christ
[1:09:29] so as paul is speaking to the
[1:09:30] corinthians he's he's encouraging them
[1:09:34] you know in the day and age we live in
[1:09:35] people would be like now just another
[1:09:37] preacher i ain't going to follow a
[1:09:38] preacher
[1:09:40] i don't need a preacher
[1:09:41] some voices in the land say the
[1:09:43] preachers are the problem
[1:09:46] well there are some preachers that are a
[1:09:47] problem but my bible says that he would
[1:09:50] send these men for the perfecting of the
[1:09:52] saints of the body so if god said that
[1:09:55] they were part of a perfecting i'm not
[1:09:57] going to look at the false ones over
[1:09:59] here i'm going to look for the real i'm
[1:10:02] going to look for the one that has
[1:10:04] something of intrinsic value to offer to
[1:10:07] me that is not expecting to be lifted up
[1:10:10] and just shouted to the heavens of what
[1:10:12] a wonderful man they are and glorious
[1:10:14] they are and we ought to give them this
[1:10:15] and that and buy them a jet airplane
[1:10:17] no you look for the one that has a
[1:10:20] compelling uh uh uh not a compelling
[1:10:23] i i i was not wanting to use that word
[1:10:25] but
[1:10:26] okay you understand where i'm coming
[1:10:27] from one that is compelled in a way it
[1:10:30] is forced
[1:10:32] man i tell you what i've seen a lot of
[1:10:33] people brother branham summed it up this
[1:10:35] way the ones that want to be the
[1:10:36] preacher are not called and the ones
[1:10:38] that don't want to be or call so there
[1:10:40] is a compelling
[1:10:43] there is a compelling on that
[1:10:45] but the apostle paul would be so bold in
[1:10:47] this day i don't know if people could
[1:10:48] deal with him he would be out here
[1:10:50] telling them just follow me
[1:10:52] because i'm following christ you just go
[1:10:55] ahead and just follow me and people
[1:10:58] would be like oh cult cult cult
[1:11:01] cult
[1:11:03] huh
[1:11:04] except for those that have true
[1:11:05] understanding would look and say you
[1:11:07] know what i see christ in that man
[1:11:09] and it don't have to be the preacher
[1:11:10] okay let's just move beyond that i see
[1:11:12] christ in that sister i see christ in
[1:11:14] that man what is it you're seeing the
[1:11:16] evidence of the word that said he would
[1:11:17] be manifest in this day
[1:11:19] he would have been manifest in this
[1:11:21] multi-member body that he calls his
[1:11:23] bride it would be manifest in them it
[1:11:26] wouldn't be a cloak that covered them
[1:11:29] but it would be a life inside of them
[1:11:32] amen now let's look here in ii peter the
[1:11:35] first chapter
[1:11:36] once again going forth as followers
[1:11:42] ii peter 1
[1:11:45] for
[1:11:46] we have not followed
[1:11:48] cunningly devised
[1:11:52] fables a man could sit down
[1:11:56] this will sound harsh
[1:11:58] but you want
[1:12:00] a cunning devised fable
[1:12:03] how many of you have read the book of
[1:12:05] mormon
[1:12:07] in so many portions it parallels the
[1:12:09] bible
[1:12:11] but you see the word says if you add one
[1:12:14] word
[1:12:15] or you take one word away
[1:12:18] so they write a parallel book
[1:12:21] and then they say it's just as divinely
[1:12:24] anointed and ordained as the bible is
[1:12:30] and there's like 17 million people on
[1:12:32] the face of the earth that agree with
[1:12:33] them
[1:12:36] because there's 17 million people it
[1:12:38] must be true
[1:12:40] no it's cunningly
[1:12:42] devised
[1:12:46] and i'm not faulting them i have many
[1:12:48] many members of our extended family
[1:12:51] that's in that and they're good people
[1:12:54] but i haven't found the scripture said
[1:12:56] that
[1:12:57] because we were good we were going to
[1:12:58] make it that's right
[1:13:01] when we made known unto you the power
[1:13:04] and the coming of our lord jesus christ
[1:13:05] but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty
[1:13:09] now my brother and sister this is a
[1:13:11] point that i really want to drive home
[1:13:12] but quickly
[1:13:14] it's not that my mama told me daddy told
[1:13:16] me i heard somebody this preacher that's
[1:13:18] my favorite internet preacher he said
[1:13:21] but this is a word of god that is
[1:13:24] declaring to you what is valid is the
[1:13:27] eyewitness
[1:13:29] amen you know as that song goes how's
[1:13:30] that brother jason
[1:13:33] i don't know i was there or something
[1:13:37] yes i was there when jesus saved me
[1:13:40] see not not somebody telling you you're
[1:13:41] now saved but being there when he saved
[1:13:44] you now the devil will bring confusion
[1:13:47] right remember the young man that was
[1:13:48] searching for the holy ghost went here
[1:13:50] went there when what comes to the
[1:13:51] prophet of god brother branham just
[1:13:53] turns him right back and says when you
[1:13:55] were first introduced to the gospel you
[1:13:57] know what happened right there and he
[1:13:59] tells him something inside of me and i
[1:14:01] cried out to the lord and brother brown
[1:14:03] says that's when you received the holy
[1:14:05] ghost he made this huge circle the devil
[1:14:06] kept brushing him off
[1:14:08] but you see it's there we should know
[1:14:11] the experience that we have and here
[1:14:14] again i'm sorry young people not to pick
[1:14:16] on you but our experience shouldn't be i
[1:14:18] was at camp and all the kids did it and
[1:14:20] so i guess i've got it too our
[1:14:22] experience should be i met god
[1:14:25] if the whole camp didn't meet god i met
[1:14:28] god it was a personal experience to me
[1:14:31] and it changed my life no i've never
[1:14:33] went out and never danced and i've never
[1:14:35] this and i've never done that none of
[1:14:37] these things but i was prone to take a
[1:14:40] cookie and lie about it i was prone to
[1:14:42] say it wasn't my fault they did it i was
[1:14:45] prone to all these little things like
[1:14:47] that but something happened something
[1:14:50] changed me
[1:14:53] hallelujah
[1:14:55] amen
[1:14:57] oh
[1:14:59] i'm lost i don't even know where i'm at
[1:15:02] for he received from god the father
[1:15:04] honor and glory when there comes such a
[1:15:06] voice to him from the excellent glory
[1:15:09] this is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[1:15:11] pleased and this voice which come from
[1:15:13] heaven we heard when we were with him in
[1:15:17] the holy mount i'm telling you that is
[1:15:20] resurrected and brought to life right
[1:15:21] here in this day when we are with him in
[1:15:25] that holy presence amen you're going to
[1:15:27] hear god speaking and it's not going to
[1:15:30] be a voice that says well the lord told
[1:15:31] me to do this and a year 2 10 later nope
[1:15:35] i'm doing this over there i would like
[1:15:37] to corner some of these people and take
[1:15:39] them back in remembrance to the day when
[1:15:41] they said the lord spoke to me and told
[1:15:43] me to do this now god's either a liar or
[1:15:46] you are and i'm not going to vote for
[1:15:48] you
[1:15:50] i mean i'm not going to vote against god
[1:15:52] you get this
[1:15:54] amen so you see what's happening
[1:15:56] this voice
[1:15:58] i'm just going to kind of preach these
[1:15:59] scriptures not read all of it but you
[1:16:01] see it's this voice that we have and
[1:16:03] it's got to be the original voice it
[1:16:05] can't be something that's been watered
[1:16:07] down and it isn't a voice that has to
[1:16:09] come through 10 people to get to you
[1:16:11] it's not even a voice that has to come
[1:16:13] through the preacher to get to you
[1:16:15] and so it's there my brother and sister
[1:16:18] and the voice came from heaven when we
[1:16:20] were with him in the holy mountain
[1:16:22] we have also a more sure word of
[1:16:24] prophecy i'll touch on that in a minute
[1:16:26] if i can just get to it where until you
[1:16:28] do well that you take heed as unto light
[1:16:31] that shineth in a dark place until the
[1:16:34] day dawn and the day start arise in your
[1:16:36] heart and my brother and sister and
[1:16:38] maybe i sound a little strident tonight
[1:16:40] i don't mean to but the problem is we
[1:16:42] got way too many people who have never
[1:16:44] seen the day star they have never seen
[1:16:47] that they are following a message
[1:16:49] because their family did or it just
[1:16:52] seemed right it was better than any
[1:16:54] church they ever experienced but that
[1:16:56] isn't the answer you've got to see the
[1:16:58] day star you've got to meet him face to
[1:17:00] face and you're gonna trust him enough
[1:17:02] that you would let him lead you out of
[1:17:04] your present circumstance
[1:17:07] hallelujah
[1:17:09] amen
[1:17:10] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[1:17:12] the scriptures of any private
[1:17:14] interpretation for prophecy come not in
[1:17:16] old time by the will of man
[1:17:19] but holy man of god spake as they were
[1:17:22] moved by the holy ghost
[1:17:24] now i want to just throw something out
[1:17:25] there just i'm just going to do it i'm
[1:17:27] not going to justify myself we see these
[1:17:30] spirits going around the land
[1:17:32] that are justifying well
[1:17:35] marriage and divorce when brother
[1:17:36] branham preached it many people didn't
[1:17:37] understand and i'll say amen to that
[1:17:39] because brother branham himself told
[1:17:40] people they didn't understand it but
[1:17:42] it's there my brother and sister they
[1:17:43] come now and say but we have an
[1:17:45] interpretation we have people who were
[1:17:47] at the prophet we've been this and we've
[1:17:48] been that and we've studied that we've
[1:17:50] analyzed the very words that brother
[1:17:51] branham said in this paragraph and and
[1:17:53] brought it back through and it's a
[1:17:55] revelation
[1:17:59] it is
[1:18:00] but the prophet of god said it needs to
[1:18:02] be a sure word
[1:18:04] and he said and if you want to know what
[1:18:06] it means you take it back to the written
[1:18:09] word
[1:18:10] of
[1:18:11] god
[1:18:13] not to an interpretation of a man here
[1:18:15] or a man there but take it back to the
[1:18:18] written
[1:18:19] word of god
[1:18:21] and that word is not up for
[1:18:23] interpretation
[1:18:25] amen i'm sorry do i sound strident
[1:18:27] tonight
[1:18:28] okay
[1:18:30] i'll maybe make fun of brother andrew
[1:18:31] but my ear mic is just a little messed
[1:18:33] up
[1:18:35] my left ear is kind of plugged
[1:18:39] for the prophecy come not in old time by
[1:18:41] the will of man
[1:18:44] my brother and sister
[1:18:45] 65 years ago is a long time 70 years ago
[1:18:48] it's a long time
[1:18:50] that was not the will of a man
[1:18:54] that was not the will of a man amen
[1:18:57] that was god coming and taking his own
[1:19:00] understanding and him declaring this
[1:19:03] that i understood in a certain way god
[1:19:06] come and corrected me
[1:19:10] that's not the understanding of a man
[1:19:14] because you know what it does it makes a
[1:19:15] man look like he doesn't know what he's
[1:19:16] talking about when he's got recorded
[1:19:19] words saying this means this and come
[1:19:22] back later and say i was wrong that
[1:19:24] means this
[1:19:26] but when you're letting god
[1:19:29] then you don't care
[1:19:30] you're able to just move on and say this
[1:19:33] is what the lord showed me
[1:19:35] now to be
[1:19:37] circumspectly verse 15 of our original
[1:19:40] scripture see then that you walk
[1:19:41] circumspectly not as fools but as wives
[1:19:44] now let's look at this
[1:19:45] did you know that research
[1:19:48] shows that humans make
[1:19:51] how many decisions a day
[1:19:55] at least one
[1:19:59] and some days that decision should be i
[1:20:01] should have just pulled the pillow over
[1:20:03] my head stayed right where i was at
[1:20:06] 35 more than 35 000
[1:20:10] decisions
[1:20:12] a day
[1:20:14] now in that
[1:20:16] they are
[1:20:18] counting the decisions your body makes
[1:20:20] in motor skill
[1:20:22] right how many of us
[1:20:25] well if you ever see me sometimes i've
[1:20:27] fallen off of the steps of this platform
[1:20:29] but
[1:20:30] my body just made decisions right the
[1:20:32] whole coordination of this
[1:20:34] but 30 more than 35 000 decisions a day
[1:20:40] so
[1:20:41] the reason i bring that up is because
[1:20:43] you see
[1:20:44] that we
[1:20:46] are influenced
[1:20:48] by incredibly amount an incredible
[1:20:52] amount of outside influence is brought
[1:20:55] to bear upon us
[1:20:57] and so it's there and and i don't want
[1:21:00] to belabor this too long but i want to
[1:21:01] ask you what's your influencer right
[1:21:04] exactly
[1:21:05] what is your influencer there's
[1:21:07] influence into the decisions you make
[1:21:10] every single day what is the influencer
[1:21:14] who is the influencer
[1:21:16] you see we even get to make a decision
[1:21:19] of who or what is going to be our
[1:21:22] influencer
[1:21:24] uh you know on the on all the social
[1:21:26] media those of you that are adept at
[1:21:28] that kind of stuff they have a status
[1:21:31] now that they've raised up that they
[1:21:33] give to people that have a certain
[1:21:34] amount of followings or or comments or i
[1:21:37] don't know what that is and now they've
[1:21:39] given them the title of influencers
[1:21:42] well i'll tell you what i come across
[1:21:44] the deal the other day and i'm
[1:21:45] embarrassed to admit it but it maybe the
[1:21:47] lord led it for a reason and so you just
[1:21:49] like okay who are these influencers and
[1:21:51] i'm scrolling through that and i'm
[1:21:53] thinking i wouldn't want any one of
[1:21:55] these people to influence me
[1:21:59] until i come to one he was a farmer
[1:22:03] but i don't know what kind of man he is
[1:22:05] he might be a blasphemer
[1:22:08] i have no idea so do i decide because
[1:22:11] he's a farmer i have a i have something
[1:22:12] in common with him brother trevor do i
[1:22:14] do i just then accept his influence
[1:22:17] no sir this is when the prophet was
[1:22:19] talking about giving it the word test
[1:22:21] not the one where people went when i was
[1:22:23] a kid oh i tell you what talk about
[1:22:25] being embarrassed gabriella when i was
[1:22:28] about your age you know there was such a
[1:22:30] spirit was on the church that was over
[1:22:31] there in greenleaf that they would be in
[1:22:33] the grocery store and they had to ask
[1:22:35] somebody
[1:22:36] god sent a prophet you believe that and
[1:22:37] they'd go i don't know nothing about it
[1:22:39] you're satan's seed
[1:22:43] i was like i don't think i'm hanging out
[1:22:44] with these people any longer
[1:22:48] because even without the holy ghost in
[1:22:49] my life at that age i knew that wasn't
[1:22:52] the right way to do it
[1:22:54] and i'm telling you even to this day the
[1:22:56] message has a black mark
[1:22:59] among some old families in that area and
[1:23:02] you know why because just virtually
[1:23:04] every one of them was told
[1:23:06] that they were satan's seed
[1:23:11] you know what's even worse
[1:23:14] the people who told them that
[1:23:16] don't even serve the lord today
[1:23:22] see how those spirits can be
[1:23:24] you know what that is that's a proud
[1:23:25] spirit
[1:23:26] that's a selfish spirit
[1:23:29] so what is happening
[1:23:31] is we're coming into a day that god said
[1:23:33] i'm going to come down i'm going to live
[1:23:34] in you and then i'm going to let my life
[1:23:36] and you be what's manifested
[1:23:38] and when that is manifested you won't
[1:23:40] have to tell your neighbor at all you're
[1:23:42] a christian they're going to say this
[1:23:43] person's different
[1:23:44] there's something here and you won't
[1:23:46] need to go through the neighborhood
[1:23:48] telling them all going to hell unless
[1:23:50] they believe you
[1:23:54] yeah tough picture isn't it
[1:24:00] who's the influencer
[1:24:03] what is the influencer that's right
[1:24:06] you see i'm going to put this and i
[1:24:07] believe you'll understand what i'm
[1:24:09] saying if someone is not walking in
[1:24:10] heavenly places then please do not let
[1:24:13] them become an influencer in your life
[1:24:17] you say well i don't know brother paul
[1:24:19] not all these people you know financial
[1:24:21] advisor he might not be a christian but
[1:24:22] he knows investment that's right but
[1:24:25] just keep searching and praying and
[1:24:26] you'll find one that's got the holy
[1:24:28] ghost and does financial advising then
[1:24:31] you can trust that man
[1:24:34] hmm
[1:24:36] y'all quiet tonight
[1:24:40] well just hold on while i restring my
[1:24:42] weed eater here
[1:24:47] see if they're not walking in heavenly
[1:24:48] places how can they ever give you advice
[1:24:50] that have never been there themselves
[1:24:54] you cannot count upon the advice of
[1:24:56] someone that would talk about how good
[1:24:58] and how glorious and what this means and
[1:25:00] whatever if they've never been there
[1:25:02] themselves
[1:25:06] i remember one time taking a tour of a
[1:25:07] submarine
[1:25:10] vancouver british columbia and the river
[1:25:11] there
[1:25:12] i believe that was a russian submarine
[1:25:14] like from the end of world war ii korea
[1:25:17] era i think maybe korea era
[1:25:20] and i remember we took this my
[1:25:22] brother-in-law took me for a tour
[1:25:23] through this boat
[1:25:25] and uh i was just amazed
[1:25:27] that you know
[1:25:29] they didn't waste anything on polishing
[1:25:31] they didn't waste anything on making
[1:25:33] somebody feel comfortable
[1:25:35] you didn't find a recliner
[1:25:37] you didn't find a feather mattress you
[1:25:40] found bunks that were about that far
[1:25:41] apart and only about five feet long
[1:25:44] you found a deal where they had to feed
[1:25:46] the people in a series
[1:25:49] because the dining room was just this
[1:25:51] little single table that was there and
[1:25:54] they put the food under the deal and you
[1:25:56] didn't ask the cook or tell the cook i
[1:25:58] want another piece of fried chicken
[1:26:00] you ate what they served you
[1:26:02] and there was a man in the boat there
[1:26:04] and he was going on and on and on and on
[1:26:06] and on and on and on and on and on about
[1:26:08] this and i thought man you're annoying
[1:26:10] we're we're on a you know a tour through
[1:26:12] this boat you're just annoying why don't
[1:26:14] you shut up
[1:26:15] and there was a man in front of him
[1:26:17] three or four people in front of me
[1:26:20] and he he finally just stomps
[1:26:23] it might have helped that he was a great
[1:26:24] big guy
[1:26:26] but he stops he turns around he looks at
[1:26:28] this man and he says i take it that you
[1:26:31] must have served
[1:26:32] on one of these submarines
[1:26:35] the guy's like
[1:26:37] no but i read a book
[1:26:41] my brother and sister
[1:26:43] there's only one book
[1:26:45] only one book that would give you the
[1:26:47] kind of experience that you could boast
[1:26:49] about
[1:26:51] but the real experience god wants us to
[1:26:53] have is the experience by experience
[1:26:57] the experience by experience is the one
[1:26:59] that the devil cannot take away from you
[1:27:01] that is the one that when your children
[1:27:03] see the experience by experience that
[1:27:05] they won't be looking at it they can see
[1:27:07] mama and daddy oh maybe i'm getting on
[1:27:09] the wrong turf here but they can see
[1:27:11] mommy and daddy fuss at each other a
[1:27:12] little bit and know that they still have
[1:27:14] christians for parents when they can
[1:27:16] come to a place that everything around
[1:27:18] them seems like there's this great
[1:27:20] degree of hypocrisy because everybody's
[1:27:22] being buffeted but they can look at that
[1:27:25] and realize i'm in laodicea and the
[1:27:27] devil's doing everything he can to
[1:27:29] disrupt lives and destroy and come in
[1:27:32] the midst of the church and cause chaos
[1:27:34] but what i do see is they are not
[1:27:37] shifted as though they are unsifting
[1:27:39] sand but they are standing solid even in
[1:27:41] the struggle they have of the day
[1:27:43] they're still standing they still get up
[1:27:45] in the morning and they still want god
[1:27:47] to lead them they get up in the
[1:27:49] afternoon as it were and they still are
[1:27:51] saying thank you lord for blessing this
[1:27:53] day and they come to the evening time
[1:27:56] and they're able to say lord you were
[1:27:58] with us today and we thank you once
[1:28:00] again and they come and what does that
[1:28:02] do it helps stabilize that young person
[1:28:05] when they realize i don't have to act
[1:28:07] like some perfect little statue i don't
[1:28:09] have to be that i can live
[1:28:12] i can live and my god understands
[1:28:14] and i'm come in my heart and say lord
[1:28:16] forgive me of my shortcomings today and
[1:28:19] the voice of god will come down in your
[1:28:21] heart and soul and say i understood your
[1:28:23] circumstance
[1:28:25] i
[1:28:26] lived it that's it
[1:28:27] i
[1:28:28] lift it
[1:28:29] i understand
[1:28:31] and he comes and gives us then more
[1:28:33] strength for the day
[1:28:35] oh hallelujah
[1:28:37] now look my brother and sister
[1:28:41] there's enough carnal advisors out here
[1:28:43] you don't even have to look for them
[1:28:45] they'll volunteer
[1:28:47] what we're looking for
[1:28:49] is something like out of first
[1:28:51] corinthians here
[1:28:54] for the preaching of the cross
[1:28:57] is to them that perish foolishness
[1:29:00] talk about a word test
[1:29:02] is this foolishness to you
[1:29:05] i don't need advice from you if this is
[1:29:08] foolishness to you because where i'm
[1:29:11] going you've never been so you can't
[1:29:13] possibly give me advice about what to do
[1:29:16] to get there
[1:29:18] that's the problem
[1:29:19] the scripture says the blind leading the
[1:29:21] blind scripture also says they stand in
[1:29:23] the door won't go in themselves and
[1:29:25] won't let anyone else go
[1:29:27] oh what we want is an open door
[1:29:30] an open door
[1:29:31] i believe when when esther was wanting
[1:29:34] to go see the king there were those that
[1:29:36] would have stood in the door for her but
[1:29:37] they didn't know how to defy the queen
[1:29:39] and not face the consequence and so they
[1:29:42] had to let her go but they wanted to
[1:29:44] they wanted to hinder
[1:29:47] they wanted you
[1:29:48] to believe that you don't need true
[1:29:50] repentance this might be a little deep
[1:29:51] young people but i want you to catch
[1:29:53] this
[1:29:54] they want you to believe that you have
[1:29:56] two souls
[1:29:59] they want you to believe that you are
[1:30:01] not going to have to get on fire for god
[1:30:04] until the prophet comes back
[1:30:13] they also want you
[1:30:15] to submit
[1:30:17] your access to the throne
[1:30:20] and give it to them
[1:30:22] and they'll go to the throne for you
[1:30:26] not recognizing that's nothing more than
[1:30:29] a laodicean catholic spirit
[1:30:34] never forfeit
[1:30:36] what god has given you
[1:30:38] stand on that
[1:30:40] yes my brother and sister i have two
[1:30:42] souls
[1:30:45] get you all shook here oh no our pastor
[1:30:47] believes in two souls i have the one
[1:30:49] that was unconverted and it died and i
[1:30:51] have one now you've got to go with me
[1:30:53] figurative okay because that's not the
[1:30:56] dynamic but i got one that was cast down
[1:30:59] as it were it was lost it was filled
[1:31:02] with darkness it was covered with black
[1:31:04] all over and i've got another one that
[1:31:06] stands today before the throne of
[1:31:08] almighty god that's been washed by the
[1:31:10] water of the word amen i'm not packing
[1:31:13] two souls with me when the devil rares
[1:31:15] his head up the whole unction of the
[1:31:17] holy ghost is right behind that to say
[1:31:20] you need to correct that paul you need
[1:31:22] to stop paul you need to
[1:31:24] repent of over that can you say amen
[1:31:27] amen so that but see how these spirits
[1:31:29] are they come in they want to present
[1:31:32] this in such a way
[1:31:33] but the the preaching of the cross to
[1:31:36] them that perish foolishness but unto us
[1:31:39] is there any us here
[1:31:41] but unto us which are saved it is the
[1:31:44] power of god for it is written i will
[1:31:46] destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring
[1:31:49] to nothing the understanding of the
[1:31:50] prudent where is the wise where is the
[1:31:53] scribe where is the disputer of this
[1:31:56] world hath not god made foolish the
[1:31:58] wisdom of this world my brother and
[1:32:00] sister and that's why we got way too
[1:32:02] many scholars in the message they've got
[1:32:04] it all figured out in an intellectual
[1:32:06] realm for after that the wisdom of god
[1:32:10] the world by wisdom knew not god it
[1:32:13] pleased god by the foolishness of
[1:32:15] preaching right
[1:32:17] you know when uh some many times after i
[1:32:19] preach i have to come read this because
[1:32:20] that reminds me okay this is the way god
[1:32:23] wanted it i sure feel foolish
[1:32:28] i'm not trying to boo-hoo
[1:32:30] might have sounded like it but i didn't
[1:32:31] mean it
[1:32:32] honest
[1:32:34] please believe me
[1:32:35] i meant that
[1:32:40] jews require a sign the greeks seek
[1:32:42] after wisdom
[1:32:44] but we preach
[1:32:46] christ
[1:32:48] we've got no other message my brother
[1:32:50] and sister we preach christ
[1:32:53] amen
[1:32:56] christ crucified and used a stumbling
[1:32:58] block in the greek's foolishness but
[1:33:00] unto them which are called
[1:33:03] see how beautiful this is to them that
[1:33:04] are called both jews and greeks christ
[1:33:07] the power of god and the wisdom of god
[1:33:09] because the foolishness of god is wiser
[1:33:12] than man and the weakness of god is
[1:33:14] stronger than man for you see your
[1:33:17] calling can someone say i see my calling
[1:33:20] for you see your calling brethren how
[1:33:22] that not many wise men after the flesh
[1:33:24] and not many mighty men
[1:33:27] not many noble
[1:33:29] are called
[1:33:31] wow
[1:33:32] how incredible it is
[1:33:34] to be called
[1:33:36] now if i could put this in this kind of
[1:33:38] a type then that there had to be someone
[1:33:41] that had a knowledge of who
[1:33:45] to call
[1:33:48] most of us you know have some kind of
[1:33:49] contact whether it's at the house
[1:33:51] whether it's with stuff you know a case
[1:33:53] of emergency
[1:33:55] called great and ethel
[1:33:57] and a phone number
[1:33:59] they know who to call
[1:34:02] god come along
[1:34:04] and through the opening of the book
[1:34:07] now i want to only say this figurative
[1:34:09] no doctrine please don't misunderstand
[1:34:11] me
[1:34:12] but you see my brother and sister
[1:34:15] in that book
[1:34:17] figuratively here i'll put it to you
[1:34:19] in the front of that book
[1:34:21] that had all
[1:34:23] the names
[1:34:25] the lamb's book of life
[1:34:28] there was a little
[1:34:29] note
[1:34:30] up front
[1:34:33] when the lamb
[1:34:35] slain
[1:34:39] call these
[1:34:43] do you follow me
[1:34:46] the lamb is slain
[1:34:50] it ain't going to be a cell phone in
[1:34:51] your pocket
[1:34:53] it was something down inside
[1:34:55] started buzzing
[1:34:57] something that caught your attention
[1:34:59] and while i come back and double back on
[1:35:01] the words that i spoke it started
[1:35:04] to compel you
[1:35:07] but not in the force that goes with the
[1:35:09] english definition of the word compel
[1:35:12] there was something
[1:35:15] the deep
[1:35:18] don't you love how the prophet laid that
[1:35:20] out so simple the deep
[1:35:23] the really deep
[1:35:26] calling into the deep
[1:35:31] and that changed us
[1:35:33] because that calling
[1:35:35] we couldn't do away with
[1:35:37] can i have just a couple more minutes
[1:35:40] rush along here amen
[1:35:43] so you look at this
[1:35:45] what has happened verse 26 see not many
[1:35:48] noble are called but god and this is my
[1:35:51] title but god has chosen
[1:35:55] see it didn't just happen saints it
[1:35:57] didn't just stumble upon this god chose
[1:36:01] the foolish things of the world to
[1:36:04] confound the wise and god hath
[1:36:07] chosen the weak things of the world to
[1:36:11] confound the things which are mighty and
[1:36:13] the base things of the world and things
[1:36:15] which are despised
[1:36:17] hath god
[1:36:19] chosen
[1:36:21] oh i hope you're catching this tonight
[1:36:23] and things which are not to bring to not
[1:36:26] those things that are what was it god
[1:36:29] chose those things
[1:36:31] they didn't just come about god chose
[1:36:33] them just as he chose you and i to be in
[1:36:36] the lamb's book of life to receive the
[1:36:38] seed of life now my brother and sister
[1:36:41] it's there this gets real tricky because
[1:36:43] it's in the verbiage but you see every
[1:36:45] man is born with a soul that soul comes
[1:36:48] in that baby everyone has a soul and so
[1:36:52] some would say well i got saved at this
[1:36:54] point of time but it kind of defies the
[1:36:57] what the scripture says that he chose
[1:36:59] you before the foundation of the world
[1:37:01] but i want you to understand my brother
[1:37:03] and sister it takes a activation of the
[1:37:06] holy ghost to bring to life in you the
[1:37:10] seed
[1:37:11] if that seed can be there some people
[1:37:13] say they don't have a seed they don't
[1:37:14] have a seed they have a seed but it
[1:37:17] never was dermatized but god placed in
[1:37:21] you the life that could be dermatized
[1:37:24] and then he chose to dermatize it
[1:37:27] oh thank you lord amen thank you lord
[1:37:31] hallelujah
[1:37:32] so you look at this the things god's
[1:37:35] chosen the foolish things and god had
[1:37:37] chosen weak things look at this i'm a
[1:37:40] fool my brother and sister i just say
[1:37:42] you know i make so many decisions that
[1:37:44] are just i look back on them i think
[1:37:46] that was ridiculous why did i make that
[1:37:48] decision the wife agrees on the
[1:37:50] ridiculous part and i look at that oh
[1:37:52] why what why did i do that but at the
[1:37:55] moment i was under anointing and often
[1:37:57] times it's anointing of the carnal
[1:38:04] let's look for something to blame on
[1:38:05] somebody
[1:38:09] i love dirt bikes
[1:38:12] i want one really bad
[1:38:14] i'm an old man i'm gonna have to put
[1:38:16] training wheels on it i don't know
[1:38:18] but brother trevor buys one and it just
[1:38:20] makes it worse
[1:38:22] brother titus rides one
[1:38:24] and i hear him describe how much fun it
[1:38:26] was it takes me back to his age
[1:38:29] gideon
[1:38:30] he goes out crash and burn everywhere
[1:38:33] wide open just go let's do this
[1:38:36] titus technical
[1:38:39] and i look at every one of those and say
[1:38:41] yes oh i forgot brother adam
[1:38:44] he's like yeah
[1:38:46] gideon went down the trail titus went
[1:38:48] down the trail i never caught up with
[1:38:50] him i kept crashing
[1:38:52] i know those days too
[1:38:58] but
[1:39:01] but
[1:39:03] but
[1:39:06] i can't follow this brother
[1:39:08] i can't follow that brother i can't
[1:39:10] follow that brother
[1:39:12] i've got to follow
[1:39:14] what the holy spirit
[1:39:17] leads me
[1:39:19] and how many times i'm making a point
[1:39:21] here i hope you catch this how many
[1:39:23] times
[1:39:24] i followed the flesh
[1:39:27] and never followed the leadership of the
[1:39:29] holy spirit
[1:39:31] and you know what
[1:39:33] praise the lord i'm here i look good
[1:39:35] don't i
[1:39:36] well i didn't mean it that way
[1:39:40] don't even answer
[1:39:44] but you know what brought me here
[1:39:47] it wasn't paul
[1:39:50] wasn't paul
[1:39:51] i had to follow
[1:39:53] leadership
[1:39:55] i had to look at this and say you know
[1:39:57] what
[1:39:59] the lord has chosen
[1:40:01] foolish things and i'm one of those
[1:40:03] that's
[1:40:04] amongst the foolish things and weak
[1:40:07] i'm so weak
[1:40:08] saints it scares me
[1:40:10] i think oh how to be a mighty christian
[1:40:12] by now but do you understand god chose
[1:40:14] us to be weak so that he could prove how
[1:40:16] mighty he is because when we are strong
[1:40:19] we can do it ourselves and can someone
[1:40:22] say amen
[1:40:24] so god wants us to be weak so that we
[1:40:27] have to cling to him that we have to
[1:40:30] trust him and we come in our own eyes as
[1:40:33] foolish that we won't even trust ourself
[1:40:36] any longer and we have to say lord i
[1:40:38] need you to show me i need you to lead
[1:40:41] me i need you to guide me because i'm
[1:40:42] foolish
[1:40:47] and then what he did he says okay now
[1:40:49] that i've placed you in that position
[1:40:52] i'm going to take those things which are
[1:40:54] despised
[1:40:55] things which are not
[1:40:57] to bring to not
[1:40:59] the things that are
[1:41:01] oh if i can just refer back real quick
[1:41:03] here all those ladies imagine in the
[1:41:07] in the in the i don't know what you call
[1:41:10] that i can't remember my brain scramble
[1:41:13] all those young ladies want to be king
[1:41:15] and i can see them in there saints maybe
[1:41:18] i'll over dramatize this but i can see
[1:41:20] him
[1:41:21] i've got notice
[1:41:22] i go to the king tomorrow
[1:41:26] down to the salon
[1:41:30] they're in the chair and they're rocked
[1:41:32] out it's all right brother they're
[1:41:34] rocked back in the chair you know some
[1:41:35] of you ladies know what i'm talking
[1:41:36] about and they're washing the hair and
[1:41:38] they're curling it and they're putting
[1:41:40] on their eyebrows
[1:41:44] they got their hands up there
[1:41:46] they're like you know i don't know if he
[1:41:48] likes long nails or not but i like them
[1:41:52] so give me some that look like eagle's
[1:41:54] claws
[1:41:59] don't forget my toes
[1:42:01] but don't make them nails so long i've
[1:42:03] heard this on good advice
[1:42:05] don't make them so long because they'll
[1:42:07] cut your nylons
[1:42:09] your stockings
[1:42:11] but i want enough
[1:42:12] i want enough there that they'll notice
[1:42:17] and
[1:42:19] i was looking at the latest issue of
[1:42:21] vogue for believers
[1:42:27] and
[1:42:28] you know we can't scoop out our dresses
[1:42:30] because that goes against what we
[1:42:31] believe
[1:42:33] so no problem just prop the dress up
[1:42:35] right there and i'll leap off the
[1:42:36] balcony into it
[1:42:43] and then
[1:42:44] when they're invited into the temple
[1:42:48] they're up there
[1:42:52] they think they look really good
[1:42:54] but really the truth is all they're
[1:42:56] trying to do is stay on their feet
[1:42:59] because they're wearing these ridiculous
[1:43:00] ridiculous shoes
[1:43:02] that the king's doctor told them
[1:43:05] will break the bones in your feet and
[1:43:07] make you crippled in your old age but
[1:43:10] they were like all i got to do is
[1:43:11] impress the king
[1:43:14] and then they're back because you guys
[1:43:16] realize oh i hope you catch this
[1:43:17] spiritual
[1:43:19] you realize when they cycled through the
[1:43:20] presence of the king
[1:43:22] and they weren't chosen
[1:43:25] they come back into a position
[1:43:28] they're not
[1:43:29] oh catch this
[1:43:30] they're not happy
[1:43:32] in the king's house
[1:43:35] and they're not happy
[1:43:36] in the world
[1:43:39] and they literally spend the rest of
[1:43:41] their life
[1:43:42] miserable
[1:43:45] and that's where esther
[1:43:48] she said you know what
[1:43:51] i think now mr chamberlain
[1:43:55] what is the king like well believe it or
[1:43:57] not he's very conservative
[1:44:00] no one else asked no one else cared
[1:44:03] but she did
[1:44:07] if he was my king
[1:44:09] my husband
[1:44:10] what would he want
[1:44:14] well there was a little advice you know
[1:44:15] this man had been in the message i mean
[1:44:17] he'd been in the king's house
[1:44:19] long time
[1:44:21] he's very conservative
[1:44:23] i know he likes
[1:44:25] white
[1:44:27] and i know he likes this
[1:44:30] and he loves hair like yours
[1:44:32] long and beautiful
[1:44:36] you see esther didn't go in there saying
[1:44:39] i've got this figured out
[1:44:41] i've got this covered
[1:44:42] you just wait and see all dazzling
[1:44:45] she went in there with a meek and a
[1:44:47] contrite spirit
[1:44:49] and what happened
[1:44:50] it was the base things of the world
[1:44:53] which
[1:44:54] was despised
[1:44:56] imagine you're the only girl going to go
[1:44:58] see the king
[1:45:00] who's not gussied up
[1:45:02] in the fashion
[1:45:04] of the day
[1:45:07] i imagine they mocked her a little bit
[1:45:09] until they woke up one day and they were
[1:45:10] like i sure hope she don't remember that
[1:45:14] i sure hope that she won't but that's
[1:45:16] all right because you see the bride is
[1:45:18] going to be there she's not going to
[1:45:19] have vengeance on her mind she's going
[1:45:21] to have and she's going to have grace
[1:45:23] and mercy
[1:45:25] but she's not going to be emotional
[1:45:26] about it and i got sidetracked there
[1:45:29] amen god hath chosen
[1:45:31] now
[1:45:32] uh first peter 1 18 just to 25 readed
[1:45:36] his homework
[1:45:38] it's actually beautiful
[1:45:40] scripture amen the precious blood of
[1:45:42] christ as of the lamb without blemish
[1:45:45] without spot now i want to just come
[1:45:47] here and i want to very quickly close
[1:45:49] this out and standing in the gap if uh
[1:45:52] um let's see go like that
[1:45:55] let me go like that is this okay just
[1:45:57] one more quote
[1:45:58] my look at all the stuff i skipped over
[1:46:01] amen
[1:46:04] now look at this now above this you're
[1:46:06] gonna find that brother branham is
[1:46:08] talking about um
[1:46:11] uh uh the
[1:46:13] prophecy that was spoken uh
[1:46:16] and and it was there my brother and
[1:46:18] sister that you see danny henry i was
[1:46:20] anointed uh of god
[1:46:23] speaks out and here is victor ledoux and
[1:46:26] this in the previous paragraph right
[1:46:27] there and he was a a a full-blooded
[1:46:31] frenchman and he speaks this now as he's
[1:46:34] speaking these words uh he's making this
[1:46:36] declaration now realize my brother and
[1:46:38] sister there's a lot of prophecy
[1:46:40] concerning you and i
[1:46:41] there's a lot of prophecy in the word
[1:46:43] that we don't even recognize this
[1:46:45] prophecy but it is prophecy
[1:46:48] we see isaiah is clear full of it amen
[1:46:52] ezekiel is clear full of it ecclesiastes
[1:46:55] it gives so many references that we look
[1:46:57] at and it you can read it as simple
[1:46:59] scripture but with the enlightening
[1:47:01] don't try and manufacture but with
[1:47:03] enlightening of the revelation of the
[1:47:05] holy ghost you'll look in that word and
[1:47:07] realize that we're talking about you and
[1:47:09] i in this day where we are standing
[1:47:11] right now
[1:47:12] and people are like well we we don't
[1:47:14] believe in all this stuff well okay but
[1:47:16] god spoke the same thing through a
[1:47:18] prophet in this day that he spoke
[1:47:19] through those prophets in that day and
[1:47:22] tied them together wove that together
[1:47:24] perfectly
[1:47:26] okay
[1:47:27] so as we look at this these words now if
[1:47:29] i could just do these are words that
[1:47:31] were spoken over brother brown and
[1:47:32] brother brahms sharing these but these
[1:47:34] words these very words can be
[1:47:37] yes sir or are words for us
[1:47:40] words to attain to words to live for
[1:47:44] and he says now here is what it said
[1:47:47] speaking of the prophecy the voice
[1:47:49] because thou has chosen the narrow path
[1:47:52] it's decision time saints
[1:47:54] decision time or what path are we going
[1:47:56] to choose
[1:47:57] big wide whatever comfortable
[1:48:01] you know the bigger the road the bigger
[1:48:03] the gutters and the more trash
[1:48:05] there is to be found
[1:48:08] because thou has chosen the narrow path
[1:48:10] the
[1:48:11] harder
[1:48:16] way i'm trying brother alex to
[1:48:20] only read one message book at a time
[1:48:23] but i just read the other day
[1:48:26] where the prophet of god
[1:48:27] i would call it prophecy
[1:48:30] said the churches will make it easier
[1:48:33] and easier
[1:48:36] no wonder they don't like us
[1:48:39] no wonder they don't like us no
[1:48:40] shortcuts around here
[1:48:42] you don't get free biscuits and gravy
[1:48:44] just because you come
[1:48:46] yeah
[1:48:48] so look at this
[1:48:51] a narrow path
[1:48:53] a harder way that has walked
[1:48:57] in your own
[1:48:58] choosing no compelling
[1:49:01] no forcing
[1:49:03] come on saints
[1:49:04] i believe that these words that were
[1:49:06] prophesied over the prophet and
[1:49:08] interpreted weren't just for the prophet
[1:49:10] all that was in christ was born to the
[1:49:12] church and all was in the church was
[1:49:14] poured into you and i amen so this was
[1:49:17] not just strictly a word for the prophet
[1:49:19] that's what i believe i'm sorry if i'm
[1:49:21] wrong correct me but it's there so what
[1:49:24] is this it's coming down a narrow path a
[1:49:26] hard way that we chose
[1:49:29] wait i'm sorry i'm not strong enough i'm
[1:49:33] foolish i'm weak i can't choose that so
[1:49:37] what happened my choosing was god
[1:49:40] working in this coming around in such a
[1:49:43] fashion that a craving
[1:49:46] a craving as it were if you'll just bear
[1:49:48] with me on this thought a craving that
[1:49:50] must be satisfied a longing that must be
[1:49:54] fulfilled and it was not god
[1:49:56] strong-arming us it was not god dragging
[1:49:59] us to an altar by our ear it was god
[1:50:01] allowing us to sit in our pew to sit in
[1:50:04] our easy chair and say lord this is what
[1:50:07] i want i want to serve you lord i want
[1:50:09] to be closer to you i want to live this
[1:50:11] life lord give me the strength give me
[1:50:14] the courage lord give me the desire to
[1:50:17] live this life and we would sit there
[1:50:19] and say well i no we can't say i did
[1:50:22] that yes we made the
[1:50:25] the the effort you might say we pick up
[1:50:28] our bible
[1:50:30] we pray
[1:50:31] we study
[1:50:33] but it was christ in us
[1:50:36] there is our hope in glory
[1:50:39] and is not in our self it is christ in
[1:50:42] us that is our hope in glory if you
[1:50:44] don't mind me changing those words
[1:50:46] hallelujah
[1:50:48] amen
[1:50:50] now i can see that moses had to make his
[1:50:52] choice too see
[1:50:54] thou has picked
[1:50:56] the precise and correct way amen
[1:51:02] precise
[1:51:06] i'm going to go over here and if that
[1:51:08] don't fit me i'm going to go over here
[1:51:10] and if that don't work i'll come back
[1:51:11] here and if it won't i'll just go start
[1:51:13] my own church
[1:51:16] i see it happen
[1:51:19] i see it happen
[1:51:22] you've
[1:51:23] thou hast
[1:51:24] come on i want you to take this like god
[1:51:26] was speaking to you tonight
[1:51:28] now has picked the precise
[1:51:30] and correct way
[1:51:32] correct decision
[1:51:34] and it is
[1:51:36] my way
[1:51:38] amen
[1:51:39] underlined
[1:51:41] my way these brother brahms words here
[1:51:43] underline my way the holy spirit
[1:51:45] speaking back there was an emphasis
[1:51:47] there
[1:51:48] oh if god could come down in our midst
[1:51:50] tonight my brother and sister god would
[1:51:52] be making an emphasis to you you are
[1:51:55] choosing the right way you are living
[1:51:57] the right life don't stop don't get
[1:51:59] distracted don't peel to the right or
[1:52:01] left just keep going in the precise way
[1:52:05] not sloppy christians but in precision
[1:52:11] because of this momentous decision
[1:52:14] a huge portion of heaven awaits you
[1:52:16] awaits thee
[1:52:17] what a glorious decision now listen
[1:52:20] close
[1:52:21] what a glorious decision thou hast made
[1:52:23] and i want to emphasize it tonight if i
[1:52:25] could if you could just receive that
[1:52:27] from my lips tonight that you have made
[1:52:30] a glorious decision and god has
[1:52:33] vindicated it to you
[1:52:35] god has made it real that this is the
[1:52:37] life you were called for this was what
[1:52:39] you were manufactured for
[1:52:43] hallelujah right you're gloriously and
[1:52:45] wondrously made amen this is what god
[1:52:48] put you together for was to be the one
[1:52:51] to stand here as a vessel of honor
[1:52:54] washed by the water of the word and he
[1:52:56] said that's good i've got you washed
[1:52:58] i've got you steadied and now i'm going
[1:53:00] to fill you up
[1:53:02] oh hallelujah and then we get all
[1:53:04] nervous oh god's asking me to pour out
[1:53:06] and i don't know no let him let him he's
[1:53:08] got more to pour in
[1:53:10] he's got more to pour in if he asks you
[1:53:11] to pour out you've got more he's got
[1:53:13] more to pour in you
[1:53:15] oh what a glorious decision what a
[1:53:17] glorious decision that has made this in
[1:53:19] itself is that which will make and come
[1:53:21] to pass the tremendous victory in the
[1:53:24] message of our opinion
[1:53:30] that's what i told you god never fails
[1:53:32] jay
[1:53:33] that song right there
[1:53:36] speaking of love
[1:53:37] speaking of the divine amen
[1:53:42] see what it is
[1:53:44] not a victory and
[1:53:46] i've memorized the doctrine
[1:53:49] it's not a
[1:53:50] victory and we can hold tighter reign on
[1:53:53] the people than any other church
[1:53:56] it's not what we have done
[1:54:00] it's what he
[1:54:01] has done
[1:54:03] in us
[1:54:05] all
[1:54:06] saints i don't know if that made sense i
[1:54:09] skipped over some stuff there i actually
[1:54:11] thought i could get that preached and if
[1:54:12] i could just stay in the middle of the
[1:54:14] road i could
[1:54:17] but look at this
[1:54:19] the lord
[1:54:20] has chosen
[1:54:23] you know what he chose
[1:54:25] he chose you
[1:54:28] to come
[1:54:29] make bring to pass a tremendous victory
[1:54:33] tremendous
[1:54:34] victory amen this bride
[1:54:37] is not a defeated bride
[1:54:40] she's not a bride
[1:54:42] that is going to just make it in by the
[1:54:44] skin of her teeth
[1:54:49] sister ruth as you would come i've got
[1:54:50] to stop
[1:54:52] otherwise i'll be going back and
[1:54:53] preaching what i skipped over because it
[1:54:55] all ties together so beautifully

[1:54:59] for you tonight saints but i'm telling
[1:55:00] you there's so much that ties in here it
