TRANSCRIPT
========================================
No sir, &gt;&gt; I'm in him. &gt;&gt; I've always been in him. &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Brown said, "If you weren't in him in the beginning, you'll never be in." So, I want you to stop right now and in spite of every struggle that we have, every battle that we face, every shortcoming we see in oursel and those around us, realize to be in him right now, WE HAD TO ALWAYS be in him. And if we were ALWAYS IN HIM, LET'S HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THIS is nothing more than a speed bump, a little stumbling stone that was put in our path to get us to quit. &gt;&gt; If we see that, if we don't, it'd be time for us to get in an altar. Amen. Maybe at home, the closet, whatever, and say, "Lord, I believe I'm a do son of God, a daughter of God." Amen. Every time [snorts] we have to have an expectation of another junction coming up. Do you realize that when revelation comes to us, faith has to come in the junction for you to be able to act on the revelation. See, we need to understand that just because something opens to you doesn't mean you're going to take that and live that. It takes faith to bring that to a place. Brother Vitali, I really enjoyed his morning services there and he made a great emphasis how and the and the platform was quite tall there. So it made a great great example and he was talking about how we come to a place we talk about faith. We hear the word all of these things but when faith really comes to be uh on display in our life. Brother Vitali walked right out put half of his foot off the platform. I was thinking man with balance like I have he's fallen off of there but he's a young man. He's healthy. And then he put his leg all the way out there. He said, "You know what? We can stand like this all day long. &gt;&gt; And it won't do us one bit of good." &gt;&gt; Faith says, "Let it go." And when you let it go, that step becomes your next step. &gt;&gt; But without letting that go, we can stand here as message believers all day long. God sent a prophet. I am healed. Here's revelations of the word. I see the mysteries of the thunders. I see the vials. I see this. I see that. And we're just standing there all day long, not taking a step. God wants us to step into that word. Step into that revelation. Amen. Just step into that presence because there is where we come to the next junction in our spiritual walk. And people would say, "I don't know about that." You don't know about that cuz you've never been there. You never done that. If you've never jumped out of an airplane, you can't describe what it's like. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Sue shared a book with me. She's always lovely about buying me stuff. And a man's talking about how and the army. Amen. He went to parachute school and he said it was fine. They had a tower like 25 ft tall and they go up there and it's got a line hooked and and that when they told them to step off, they stepped off cuz the ground's right there. But when they got up in a plane up there a few thousand feet high, some of those men got up to the door. Amen. And they got a hold of that door. And in this one case, I thought it was funny because the the the jump master actually had a parachute on. Praise the Lord. Otherwise, he'd be dead. Amen. There's this man got a hold of the door frame and when the jump master tried, a sergeant tried to push him out the door, the man turned around, grabbed the jump master, AND THEN FELL out the door. Amen. After that, the next time up in the plane, the jump master got to him. before he got to the door, he said, "You ever do that again, I'll knock you out and throw you out of the plane unconscious." Now, I tell you, I think sometimes God is telling us, you are going to take the next step. I'm going to put things in your life that you are going TO GET SO DESPERATE THAT YOU NEED A DELIVERANCE. I need to TAKE A NEXT STEP, LORD. I GOT TO MAKE IT. AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW, BY DESPERATION, you take this step. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it also describes in that book how when they were jumping over Normandy on D-Day and the flack and the machine gun, the the the uh tracer rounds are flying up, one man fell to the floor, crawled to the back of the airplane, got a hold of the seat, and they couldn't pry him loose. &gt;&gt; He was not going in the rapture. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that a fair example? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Because he couldn't take that next step. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God wants you and I. &gt;&gt; I don't know what your next step is, brother, sister. I don't know. God doesn't I don't need to know what God's got for you. What we have to do is realize this mystery unfolding in us requires us to keep walking. There's no stagnant. We're not going to come to a Red Sea and say, "I wished I was in Egypt." Amen. We're not going to come out here amongst the serpents and say, "I wished I WAS IN EGYPT." WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET OUT IN the middle of that wilderness and say, "I wished I was in Egypt." WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RALLY CRY AS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. I'M LOOKING to a PROMISED LAND. I'M PROMISED A LAND BEYOND THE RIVER. I'M GOING TO POSSESS THAT LAND. I'M GOING TO WALK IN THAT LAND, AND THAT LAND'S GOING TO BE FRUITFUL to me. My family's going to have THE HOLY GHOST. I'M GOING TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. THE WORD'S GOING TO COME TO PASS IN OUR LIFE. WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. WE'RE GOING TO claim what is rightfully ours. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not going to sit back and say, "I want to go back. I want to go back. I WANT TO GO BACK." WE'RE GOING TO be here anointed with a spirit. I want to go to that promise that God has given to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. [snorts] If there was ever a time to be an expectation, it is [snorts] now. Now, in the handwriting of the wall, I better get going here. Amen. At the junction of each age, we've had several junctions of time. When time runs out, man's ability fades. We're not exempt from that. And as we would notice in the Antalovian destruction, now I just want to set a little background for what I want to bring to you in the Antalovian world after Cain and Abel and then Seth was raised up to take Abel's place representing the death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the just one. Man being to man began to spring out from these two boys. And if you'll notice, men become wise and smart, but the shrewdness never come through the side of Seth. All the scientists, all the smart, all the intelligent, all the educated men come through the side, the side of Cain because they'd eaten from the tree of knowledge, of course, but of good and evil. But the other side was a humble side. Now, I'll just want to throw this in just to when I was a young man, they said, "This is the reason why you shouldn't go to school and get any kind of education." And you know what it yielded? I'm sorry to put it this blunt. It yielded a bunch of unlearned, backslid children. their education or lack of did not affect one thing in their spiritual walk because they weren't taught to trust God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They trusted themselves anyway, which is the very thing that God was speaking against through the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Education's not of the devil. What you do with that education determines what the outcome will be. &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] And then it become a place where the world was full of great scientists became wicked yet religious. I want to focus on this. We'll touch on this in a minute. [snorts] Become wicked yet religious. There come a junction of time that God had to judge the sin. And when he did before his great judgment was passed, he sent prophets, angels, supernatural, great signs and wonders, then destruction. Sounds familiar. At the coming of the children of Israel, the church had cooled off. They had gone [snorts] down there to be masters of Egypt. and so forth. And they come and there come on the scene prophets, angels, message, supernatural, judgment to Egypt. In the days of the coming of the Lord Jesus, the church had cooled off again. Sin had set in the church. There come an angel and appeared to Zachcharias, a prophet cometh on the scene. Then the supernatural was done. Then judgment to Israel, and she was scattered to the four winds of the world. So this wasn't just an accident. People in history would say, you know, Israel, the reason they ended up in all these places of the world was they were chasing riches. Well, we won't deny that might in their mind might have been chasing riches, but it really was God scattering them &gt;&gt; because his word has to come to pass. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, look at this. Amen. And my most beloved friends, we're at another junction. We had 1500 years of dark ages in Catholicism. Along came Martin Luther, cooled off. Along come Wesley, cooled off. Along come the Baptist, cooled off. Along come Pentecost, cooled off. And it never went to a cooling off. It got lukewarm. And just before the great cooling off or lukewarmness of the Pentecostal church, there has come again on the scene the supernatural and prophets and great messages and the healing of the sick and the raising of the dead. It's God's signpost. We're at the end time. Now, this is not something we preach to make anyone scared. Amen. I don't look at the day on the calendar to be scared of what day of the week it is. I look at it so that I am informed of the time that I'm in. And this is what the word's doing. Some people say the message is there to scare you. My brother and sister, it is. Every day I look at the calendar realizing in a few days I owe the bank a whole bunch of money. Does that make me scared? No, it doesn't. I'm just informed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm informed. I'm not scared. &gt;&gt; My wife has the money to pay the bank. I don't have to worry about it. I'm informed. Amen. We're at the end time and the church is lukewarm, just cooling off and going away. Can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; We look around the world. If I could just block in those next few words. It has &gt;&gt; to be &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; that way. Don't be scared of that. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm afraid of being deceived. Don't be afraid of being deceived. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word is not talking about you. Amen. You've been called of God. He holds a title deed to you. You don't have to worry about Satan running in and snatching it out of your hand. He holds the title deed. It's paid for. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got the blood of Jesus Christ paid in full upon it. God said it would be that way. But the warning is to him that has ears to hear, let him hear what Paul says to the church, what preacher here, pastor there, what the spirit. This is why we got to be in the word. This is why we got to do it. It's not going to be a man that saves us. My brother and sister, people have this idea if Brother Brandon was here today that the message churches would be entirely different. I say it would not be. It's going to take anointing of the Holy Spirit in our lives, anchor to know that we have been called in him before the foundation of the world. It will take that kind of revelation to hold us in this day. &gt;&gt; Talking to a brother here just recently and he made a statement to me. He says Paul, he says, "Isn't it interesting? Many of the people that were around brother Brandham in those meetings in those days as young people," so they're still living today. Many of those young people have turned their back. They saw the supernatural. They saw the signs and wonders. They saw the miraculous. They've turned and walked away from it. &gt;&gt; And then we both agreed this scripture is true. Better having not seen &gt;&gt; but believed. Yes, &gt;&gt; there it is. Seeing it won't make us receive it. &gt;&gt; In fact, they got we were discussing this. They got confused. They got confused. They decided that brother Brandham was the answer. It was the word he brought us was the answer. But it was so supernatural, so incredible, so outstanding, so above and beyond that they missed that he was only a messenger and the messenger to the Leodysian age, not Jehovah, the messenger. So we come to a crossroad here, a junction. It hath ears to hear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Okay, let me just hurry along here now. We're living saints in a time that people speak so openly, so incredibly about our Lord Jesus. You'll be in a conversation with someone and they're just like, "Oh, this this happened. The Lord was dealing with me. I I did this. The Lord told me to go over here." And these things are not dead ends, things they're being blessed. These are things that are coming to pass. They're saying, "Now, the Lord told me this and this and this and that come to pass and the Lord said this and come to pass." And if you're not careful, you're going to be thinking, "Man, the Lord doesn't do that for me. The Lord's not coming and waking me up in the midnight hours all the time and and telling me, "Go look at this scripture, this scripture, tie this to, and when you meet this, you know, red-headed man tomorrow, you tell him this, this, and this, and you don't know him. You don't know nothing about him, but he'll know that I'm speaking to him." Does that happen to us? Not often. I will say it has happened. And you sit there and you're a little stunned. You're like, "Wow." But then something sparks. But they're not living the word. Do you know, Brother Trevor, there's actually in the United States several prophecy schools that you can go attend classes to learn how to prophesy. Interesting. See where they're taking it? It's no longer a sovereign move of the Holy Spirit on your life, but now we're going to teach you how to tap in to those hidden things that God had, right? Brother Brandham talking about the first, second, third pole. He says, you know, I I explained it and they imitated it and I wish I wouldn't have. You know, the whole example of the fishing reel and that whole thing. See what happens is Satan's looking and when he recognizes that now trust me I'm not being critical of these people actually in this particular case my heart aches but they're talking about this miraculous stuff how God guided them over here and God guided them here and this happened and this happened and this happened and the Lord spoke to me and this happened Married multiple times their whole things about their lives are just don't line up with the word I'm not being judgmental I'm telling you this is why the prophet of God said it has to line up with the word because all of the lion vanities can cause prophecies to take place and people to speak as though they were face to face, lip to ear with God. But they don't live out the word. I'd rather be silent my whole life [snorts] and be living the word. Because you see, we see this in the word, my brother and sister. Remember, speak less, live more. I read this I read this comment the other day and it struck me. Speak less, live more. Let your life speak for itself. I was like, there it is. Reshaping different words of what we already know. But there it is. Speak less, live more. You don't have to go out here and say, "I'm a Christian. I'm a Christian. I'm a Christian." They'll see you're different. &gt;&gt; And pretty soon they'll figure out. &gt;&gt; They're not a Buddhist. They're not this. They're not that. &gt;&gt; Huh? Must be one of those religious fanatics. It's a little shocking when someone comes up to you and asks you a question like that. So, Paul, are you one of those religious fanatics? You know, I'm glad my reaction was what it was. I stuck my hand out and said, "Glad to meet you." &gt;&gt; Why, my brother and sister, you're going to be identified with something. &gt;&gt; Let's be identified with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need to be ashamed of that. He's done something supernatural in our lives. This is not just some common little thing that happened. We stumbled over it. It's not like you went into the five and dime store and found a bargain somewhere. This is God coming down pouring his mystery of who he is, of his will, pouring it into you and I. It ought to be something we rejoice about. Amen. Satan shouldn't be able to take that victory from us. Amen. And that's exactly what it is, a victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, as we look, you see, our lives are not a secret. &gt;&gt; We were called to fulfill the word for the world to see it. Amen. [snorts] Remember now, brother Brandon preaching about the queen of the south, how she come and that she would judge. Amen. Her life would judge. She traveled all that way because she wanted truth. She wanted the word. And brother Brown then goes and now we won't even cross the street. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; See how see how what's happened in our day. Now, don't misunderstand me. I understand circumstances. I understand that we live in a complicated world. Amen. [snorts] I know some churches we visit, they work shift work, you know, work in factories at night. They don't dictate that, but that's the only good job in their community. And so, it comes a time they can't be in church. Amen. But you look at that and realize that God looks on the heart. &gt;&gt; And if we can and we don't, then God knows that also. &gt;&gt; And so, it's there. Look at this. Now, when their eyes were open, Amen. Let's just go through this real quick so we can done. How many read this sermon when the omnipotent speaks miracles happen? Did you you believe that? Certainly. Omn omnipotent spoke at every junction. At every junction, every junction. An omnipotent God come down to every You guys are on the front row. [laughter] At every junction, Sister Carrie, there was an omnipotent voice speaking. &gt;&gt; Man, that just makes my heart just just stir. It makes it bubble. It's like I didn't just happen to come here. I didn't just happen to do this. I just didn't happen to. An omnip omnipotent voice was speaking at every junction of our life. And yet we'd sat here today and say, "I sure don't feel special." Well, the devil might be just lying to you. Or maybe God's allowing the devil to dig up your garden. Might be that season, &gt;&gt; you know, and then God's going to put his sunlight on that. And that sunlight's going to cause a change in us. And that change is going to be for our good. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's not going to allow the devil to destroy you. &gt;&gt; He's not going to allow it to destroy your relationship with him, your relationship and the body of believers, relationships in and period. Amen. It's not going to allow him to destroy that. He will allow go for a season because God knows it's going to mold our character and when we come out of that, we'll be stronger for who we are. Amen. But at the moment, no correction seems good. [snorts] And this junction and this is the junction of all junctions. This is the end time. The end of the whole history of the world is right now at hand. You can expect omnipotence to speak. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; We can expect omnipotence to speak. That should be our approach to come into the house of God. It's going to speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it. You can expect the greatest and mightiest miracles that's ever happened on the earth will happen in the next few years to come. If Jesus terries, it will be. Then watch for Satan. See, now look at this. We can draw this line. Let me just cut this off for a moment. We need to believe that when God is speaking to us, he is speaking to us, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We We hear God's voice. He's He's causing us. We read scripture. It stirs our heart. It speaks to us. Amen. And we come and we get we get excited and we look at little things and see how suddenly this and this tie together. Amen. So omnipotence and omnipotent God is speaking to his people. And then brother Brandham comes right behind that. Oh, it would have been so good just to left it in the glorious realm. Oh, praise God. Omnipotence is speaking. Oh, praise God. God is speaking to us. Brother Brandham comes along and says, "Hey, let me just kind of bring you back down to earth just a tad bit." Amen. Then watch for Satan to raise up his too. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You ever notice the cycle of Christian life? We talk about it. Praise God. I was on the mountaintop. It was so glorious. I saw the sun rising. I saw the sun set. I saw the beauty, the majesty of God. How did I get in this valley? Lord, hast thou forsaken me? What did I do wrong? Are you punishing me, Lord? Did I fail you? Am I even? I'm not preaching to you. I'm preaching to people like you. And one of those people like you is named Paul. Amen. Lord, are you mad at me? [clears throat] Then we realize, watch for Satan to raise up his too. When all heaven turns loose, all hell turns loose. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; too. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do we know what he's talking about? &gt;&gt; We do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll see it. We are not exempt, saints. Don't let the devil beat you as though you're some sort of failure. And that's why you're in this valley in the condition things are right now. Amen. It's because all of hell. Amen. Now look, maybe I'm taking too much in these words, but where I come from, the word all meant everything. So everything that hell has has been turned loose against you &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want you to get back on that mountaintop. He wants to keep you down there in that valley where it's littered with big boulders and cliffs and all kinds of things that you can't deal with. Amen. But look at this now. You'll know when all hell turns loose that heaven has turned loose, too. Let's make the decision. Which one are we going to receive tonight? Amen. Which one are we going to claim? Which one are we going to possess? Am I going to say all hell is broke loose and my life is out of control and everything is ruined or am I going to turn my EYES TO GLORY AND SAY LORD IF THE DEVIL IS LOOSE ROARING LIKE A LION THAT MEANS YOU ARE LOOSE HERE TOO AND I'M LOOKING TO YOU LORD YOU ARE THE GOD OF MY SALVATION THE GOD OF MY DELIVERANCE THE GOD OF EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE AND I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK AT HELL I'M SORRY YOUNG PEOPLE I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK AT HELL HELL'S UGLY HELL DESTROYS HELL IS LIKE A CANCER, BUT I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE REDEEMER AND I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVETH AND I KNOW HE HAS CALLED ME. I KNOW THAT HE'S GOT THAT OPEN BOOK STANDING THERE AND MY NAME IS ON THAT PAGE. SATAN, I'M SORRY. YOU WASTED YOUR TIME BECAUSE MY NAME IS ON THAT BOOK. &gt;&gt; I haven't seen IT WITH MY EYES, BUT I'VE SEEN IT IN my spirit. I've seen it by revelation. [snorts] Amen. Hallelujah. It's prophesied there'd be Jane Janus and Jambre on the earth in the last days who would almost impersonate the real thing so close to deceive the very elect if possible. Now, I'm [snorts] going to speak real direct to this. There's way too many people around this message that are scared to death. They're going to be deceived. Come on. said it would deceive the very elect. &gt;&gt; I'm not changing the word. Don't misunderstand me. But we can put a solid period right there because we cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; That's what the word said. If we can be deceived, my brother and sister, after God has poured all of the revelation of his word, which is himself, right, revealing himself, and then he would stand back as an angry God and just let you step off the great abyss into hell. That doesn't go with what brother Brown said when he said, "Even if I knew I was going to hell, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; I would serve him. Anyway, &gt;&gt; anyway, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; There is what shows what the very spirit or nature of God is. &gt;&gt; That it wouldn't be, well, I'll just go live in your way because I I'm I'm lost anyway. For one, that's the devil talking. Amen. And when you have a firm revelation of who you are in the word, Amen. the devil's never going to stop talking. Now, I don't want to go into this because it can go a long ways, but I'll just put it this way. Some of us might not be so spiritual as others, cuz some of us wake up in the middle of the night to find the devil tapping on the nightstand. &gt;&gt; Sir, &gt;&gt; I want to talk to you. I want to tell you about every mistake you ever made. I want to tell you that your chances of making the rapture are zero. and you can't fall asleep because he's there. You're going to talk to me or we'll just have a one-sided conversation. Remember when you were 14? Remember when you were 21? Remember when you were 28? Remember when you were 40? Remember when And I'm sorry, Satan. My Lord's over here saying, "What sin?" That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you talking about &gt;&gt; whose voice tonight, saints, would we choose to listen to? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one &gt;&gt; that has turned all of heaven loose to bless you and I &gt;&gt; or the one who's turned all hell loose to destroy us. We're at that junction. &gt;&gt; We're seeing, now I don't want to speak negative here, please, but we're seeing that coming to pass. I used to think this this certain person been around the message for 40 years. If I could just be like them. They're on wife number three and they're a drunk now. &gt;&gt; I'm glad God didn't allow me to be like them. &gt;&gt; Amen. God didn't say go be like brother so and so. God said be like me. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's our answer. Don't be looking to somebody else thinking they're all spiritual. They're all wise. They got answers to our problems. Our answers are in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not in a man, not a wise man, not a skilled man, not an educated man. Whatever it is, our answer is in the word. We get in the word, we'll find our answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, [snorts] we're looking for all of that. Amen. Let me just go on a little bit. [snorts] Amen. See, now I want to bring this out once again, this out of the quote. So, you can expect omnipotence to speak. You can expect the greatest and mightiest miracles has ever happened on the earth will happen in the next few years to come. If Jesus terries, it will be. What's the next few years? [snorts] Next few years. Well, there's a quote there. You've probably read it. Brother Brown said, "Lord might tar for a hundred." That's right. &gt;&gt; And he says here, next few years. Is this a contradiction? &gt;&gt; No. Next few might be a hundred. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But what's time got to do with you and I? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are eternal beings in Jesus Christ. Sister Vikica, will you come? Amen. Let's not let the devil Amen. bring us to our junction and cause us like Israel to stop and say, "I think it'll be easier to turn and go back." Now, I want to be real graphic and I want to be graphic for a purpose because you see, there was that generation that was ordained to go into the promised land. Now, can you imagine, take this to any person, any place, any way you want to do it, but can you imagine you're now with the family unit and you're in the wilderness and there's been a person in your life called grandpa. He's always been there. He's always been strong. He's always been an example. But grandpa allowed himself to get under an anointing. And when he should have said amen to the word and stepped forward to possess a promise, he was maybe looking over at brother so and so to see if brother so and so says amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So when he should have said amen to the word, he let another man's influence. Now here's a younger generation. We understand the word. Amen. and they're walking through the wilderness and they see grandpa stumble and they see grandpa get all dizzy and they see grandpa lay down and die right there. God's promise must not have been true. My brother and sister, the promise is true &gt;&gt; to everyone who will believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a matter about grandpa, grandma, this preacher, that preacher, this church, or that church. It's you and the promise. Amen. And when they stood there as young people remembering Joshua's words and realizing, I have to go possess the land. I have to. They went into the land [music] and we'll see this. You know the story. Caleb's daughter, she's already married and she comes one day and says, "You know what, Dad? I have a promise. [snorts] But I don't want just the lower spring." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to really be blessed of God. I want the deep high revelations of God. I want the low revelations of God. I want this to [music] be the land that was given to me to not just be a message believer. [music] &gt;&gt; But to come to a junction where I can stand and say, "My God delivers. My God is real. My God is true. My God is faithful." Had nothing to do with Joshua. But Joshua spoke the words that encouraged them.
