[33:20] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[33:23] God in the face that's the person of
[33:27] Jesus Jesus

[37:04] have a skull field just across the other
[37:07] side verse 20 at that day what day when
[37:12] the message of the seventh angel
[37:14] Revelations 10 the open of the Seven
[37:16] Seals
[37:18] comes Amen in that
[37:20] day it's going to come to full reality
[37:23] full Revelation for what purpose full
[37:26] Revelation full faith a perfect faith
[37:28] for what purpose the change or the the
[37:31] the full realization of what we have in
[37:36] substance amen all right so he said so
[37:41] he said at that day we know that the
[37:43] prophet identified that scripture as
[37:45] this day you shall know not imagine not
[37:49] hope not a make believe that I am in my
[37:52] father ye in me and I in
[37:56] you he
[37:58] amen amen so we're going to proceed on
[38:02] this I am because he is I am now you may
[38:07] be
[38:08] seated I'd like you to go with me over
[38:10] to St John
[38:15] 11:25 Martha meeting Jesus at the grave
[38:18] of
[38:22] Lazarus and Jesus said in verse 23 saith
[38:26] unto her thy brother shall live again
[38:29] Martha saith unto him I know that he
[38:31] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[38:32] the last day but Jesus said unto her
[38:35] Jesus said unto her I
[38:37] am the resurrection and the
[38:41] life amen I am the resurrection and the
[38:45] life who are
[38:51] you you can't be the I am he's I am you
[38:54] can't be in him and not be the I am and
[38:57] if he's Resurrection is life that's who
[38:58] you
[39:01] are then fear
[39:05] not there is no fear hallelujah amen how
[39:10] can you pass away when the I am can't
[39:12] pass
[39:14] away all right so he said I am the
[39:17] resurrection and the life he that
[39:18] believeth in
[39:20] me he that believeth in me when were you
[39:23] believing in him that before the
[39:25] foundation of the world you were portion
[39:27] of himself you were the thought of
[39:29] himself existing you were the substance
[39:32] in him that had to be expressed he
[39:35] thought of you he it was a thought of
[39:39] himself he wanted to be
[39:43] bride he had an attribute to be bride he
[39:47] had an attribute to be a husband so he
[39:49] had an attribute to be a bride he had
[39:51] attribute to be a
[39:54] wife that was in him that was a part of
[39:57] of him that was a portion of him that
[39:59] had to be expressed and when it was
[40:01] expressed it was a word it was logos and
[40:04] the logos had to be
[40:08] manifested amen amen all right so he put
[40:12] his thought into manifestation and so
[40:14] you being predestinated word for this
[40:17] season written in the Bible for this
[40:19] season becomes that word living made
[40:22] manifest in
[40:25] flesh Hallelujah because he wrote of you
[40:27] in here this is him you can SP to point
[40:31] to this scripture and say it's written
[40:32] of
[40:33] me right point to the scripture just
[40:36] like he did say it's written of me amen
[40:40] hallelujah amen
[40:48] so he said
[40:53] here he said not he said all that God
[40:56] I'm I'm quoting what he said all that
[40:58] God was he poured into Christ all Christ
[41:01] was or is was poured into his body the
[41:05] bride is poured into his body the bride
[41:08] that's the second fold of a three-fold
[41:11] manifestation of the seven
[41:15] seal of the
[41:17] mystery amen the mystery of himself
[41:20] that's what it
[41:21] is remember he said it's unfolded in a
[41:24] three-fold manner three-fold purpose and
[41:27] that secret could only be known to his
[41:31] bride amen so if you have and know the
[41:34] secret and it's opening in you who are
[41:38] you you're his
[41:41] wife all right and nothing can nothing
[41:44] can nothing shall be able to defeat the
[41:47] I
[41:48] am nothing can stop the I am it's
[41:54] Eternal it came from God it goes back to
[41:56] God Jesus knowing he came from God and
[41:59] went back to God so what about us that's
[42:02] the Revelation he's
[42:06] unfolding that's the message of the
[42:08] seventh
[42:09] angel all right so he says here the
[42:12] headship and the body now it's not them
[42:15] people he said but the headship and the
[42:17] body has become one
[42:20] unit not the not the humanness the body
[42:23] of Christ himself has become one unit
[42:27] yes it's God manifested in his people
[42:30] this is in Christ The Mystery of God
[42:32] revealed paragraph 591 he said the
[42:34] headship and the body has become one
[42:36] unit it's God manifested in his
[42:40] people that's the reason the husband and
[42:43] wife is no longer
[42:46] Twain he's he's he's he's pointing us to
[42:49] a man to a manifestation and the reality
[42:52] of his message they're no longer Twain
[42:57] this at the days of the voice of the
[42:59] seventh angel the mystery of God and
[43:01] that voice of the seventh angel the
[43:03] trumpet you look at you look at the it's
[43:07] a a linear I don't know how many have
[43:09] that linear uh uh the Greek words of the
[43:12] New Testament anyway it calls it the
[43:14] trumpet that's amen the days of the
[43:18] voice of the seventh angel the trumpet
[43:21] sounds the mystery of
[43:24] God is finished
[43:30] amen so we we'll come into that just a
[43:32] little bit here so it's God manifested
[43:34] in his people that's the reason the
[43:35] husband and wife is no longer Twain
[43:38] they're
[43:40] one they're one all right God and his
[43:44] church is
[43:47] one then if he if we're not if but we
[43:51] are one then whatever he is we
[43:55] are and I say I am being little I am
[43:59] because he's the capital I
[44:03] am amen are you with me I have to be
[44:06] that and that I am is
[44:09] eternal and it's eternal life and it's
[44:13] manifested in flesh glorifying and
[44:15] manifesting the
[44:18] sun all right so he said it's they're no
[44:22] longer Twain they're one God and his
[44:23] people Christ in you God's Great
[44:28] Faith Revelation God's Great Revelation
[44:32] is Christ in you what is Christ in you
[44:34] then the substance of things hoped for
[44:37] the substance of the thing
[44:40] promised the evidence of Things Not
[44:44] Seen amen you have it already Christ in
[44:48] you has given it and identified that you
[44:50] are in him you are
[44:54] one okay so so we see here he said God's
[44:59] Great Revelation glory to God what are
[45:01] we doing even bearing his
[45:05] name bearing his name what goes with
[45:09] that
[45:11] name everything that name goes for
[45:14] everything that name pertains to we're
[45:16] bearing that name we become that name
[45:19] made
[45:21] manifest amen all
[45:25] right okay so he said I'm just picking
[45:29] this up here on being one I want you to
[45:31] hear
[45:34] this the church will come through
[45:37] justification through Luther
[45:39] sanctification through Wesley through
[45:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the
[45:43] Pentecostal brother brandham said the
[45:44] Pentecostals was the last great
[45:48] Reformation he said but we're beyond
[45:51] that we didn't do away with that we're
[45:53] beyond that because the baptism of the
[45:55] Holy Ghost of the new earth makes way
[45:57] for the Holy Ghost himself to come right
[45:59] down in Perfection back to the word
[46:02] again what are we coming back to word
[46:05] who are we the
[46:09] word that's it what can who can defeat
[46:12] the word the word is impossible can't be
[46:17] defeated
[46:19] amen see so he said now the the
[46:23] word through these through these through
[46:26] the these processes amen three
[46:30] processes what's the the justification
[46:32] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost
[46:34] constitutes what the new
[46:36] birth
[46:38] amen then what's
[46:40] growing himself is growing in you what
[46:44] is he growing what is he manifesting
[46:46] himself in Bride
[46:49] form so the message of the hour is
[46:51] Christ in Bride form the message of the
[46:54] hour is the bride coming of Christ
[46:59] and so we see he said and and it'll go
[47:03] or it'll go through baptism of holy
[47:05] ghost or the Pentecostals and go and
[47:07] then proceed right on proceed watch
[47:10] proceed right on into the Perfection of
[47:13] the son of
[47:14] man how is he perfected how is Adam
[47:18] perfected where was the capping Stone of
[47:21] Adam of the ministry of Adam where was
[47:23] it what was the capping Stone of all
[47:25] creation
[47:30] the
[47:31] bride she was the Caps she was the
[47:34] capping off of all that Adam
[47:38] was she was in Adam a part of Adam had
[47:41] to be expressed as
[47:44] Adam are you with me so it was a
[47:47] finished mystery of Adam because there's
[47:49] still a mystery to be unveiled that
[47:51] would fulfill and bring to full
[47:53] manifestation Adam because he was both
[47:55] male and female
[47:58] and there had to be an expression of
[48:00] himself in the bride
[48:02] form
[48:05] Hallelujah and he says now with that
[48:07] expression of himself and bride form
[48:08] we're ready to go back to
[48:11] Eden because that's the message of the
[48:14] hour back to we're going heading back to
[48:16] Eden which is his third
[48:20] coming how many you know
[48:22] that when's his third coming when he
[48:25] steps with his bride right back upon the
[48:27] Earth again in the
[48:31] Millennium amen the the Earth has a
[48:34] baptism and who steps upon it the I
[48:37] am who steps upon it when you receive
[48:40] the baptism who steps upon in your Earth
[48:44] and begins to develop you and it begins
[48:46] to change you and it begins to mature
[48:48] you just as the Earth will become
[48:50] matured who's the city dwelling
[48:55] there amen
[48:58] how's that mountain going to come to
[48:59] pass because that mountain that body
[49:02] that that Earth has got to have a change
[49:04] doesn't it just like you have to have a
[49:06] change but what's bringing you to that
[49:08] change the unveiling of I
[49:11] am in
[49:14] you is your change that you have as a
[49:17] substance in you now see there's no more
[49:23] fear I'm talking as an individual I
[49:25] speak to other IND individuals
[49:28] here there's no fear in perfect love and
[49:32] you can't have his faith without his
[49:36] love so let's go back here he says now
[49:38] so the pent and go it'll go from the
[49:40] Pentecostals right into the Perfection
[49:42] of the son of man that when husband and
[49:45] wife will be the same self
[49:48] persons other words person so what is I
[49:52] am speaks of a single person is that
[49:54] right the I am speaks of a of a person I
[49:57] mean speaks of a of it's a personal
[50:00] pronoun of an of a
[50:03] person you
[50:05] understand so what person is
[50:08] it you see you
[50:11] see what did he do for us at
[50:14] Calvary he opened his
[50:17] life poured out his life is that right
[50:20] for who to Quicken for what purpose to
[50:23] Quicken that seed he will was the full
[50:27] seed is that right but he had a wife
[50:31] yeah that was in him and had to be
[50:33] expressed that's
[50:35] right so she was body of his body flesh
[50:39] of his flesh bone of his bone that's
[50:42] what the bride
[50:43] is Same Spirit she doesn't have another
[50:47] Spirit she has the same spirit amen
[50:52] right manifested in flesh
[50:57] that's right it's right exactly right
[51:01] all right now so you see It'll be this
[51:04] same selfers God will be so manifested
[51:07] into his bride his church till they'll
[51:09] be they'll both be the
[51:13] same don't tell me we're not coming
[51:16] close to that there's a bride right at
[51:18] the point of maturity here today I
[51:20] believe that with all my heart she's
[51:22] maturing exactly as she as the word said
[51:25] she would into the very person of Christ
[51:28] himself manifested in flesh it's a
[51:31] different flesh the only difference
[51:32] between us and the calvary man is a
[51:34] different flesh
[51:36] man there's still a spiritual birth we
[51:39] weren't born we weren't born we were
[51:41] born this man was born by sexual birth
[51:43] what we're all every one of us so we
[51:45] were defeated to begin with he didn't
[51:47] come by sexual birth he but he came by a
[51:50] spoken word
[51:51] birth and so have we spiritually come
[51:55] through a spoken word
[51:57] birth which will have to be translated
[52:00] into a new
[52:02] body exactly right amen praise be to God
[52:07] the seed is being preached the Son of
[52:09] God is ripening the seed there's got to
[52:11] be light here there's light here you
[52:13] realize that when the when when there's
[52:16] when Dawn comes there's a space of time
[52:18] between Dawn and the rising of the
[52:21] sun there's time between time

[52:29] we can get out of the way so Israel can
[52:31] have their
[52:33] message where are we at do you recognize
[52:36] your day in this
[52:37] message amen you are the one being

[52:52] still Bride on Earth that will be
[52:53] changed in a moment and a twinkling of
[52:55] an eye amen when that last one comes in
[52:58] the finality of it Sheil that

[1:06:14] which is the revelation of the son of
[1:06:17] man Hallelujah you say that's a big
[1:06:20] order but it's it's too big for David
[1:06:23] but it's not too big for he that is in
[1:06:24] me
[1:06:26] he's doing it perfectly as he said he
[1:06:28] would it's all his achievement it's all
[1:06:30] his work it's all himself it's here in
[1:06:33] us working through us it's all him and

[1:06:56] going through and look at the word

[1:07:00] Deliverance for
[1:07:01] it it's already yours what do I got to
[1:07:04] do take it take his word don't add your
[1:07:08] opinion to it don't add your feelings to

[1:07:12] word and say the word said so in my
[1:07:14] heart I absolutely believe it and what I
[1:07:16] believe I have
[1:07:21] now the just shall live by faith faith
[1:07:24] in what faith is in the word now let me
[1:07:27] read to you what I read here or I didn't
[1:07:29] read I quoted it because I didn't have
[1:07:30] it to read but but in the message
[1:07:32] perfect
[1:07:34] faith brother Brown said this and I'll
[1:07:37] come back to what he said earlier I mean
[1:07:39] before this a Believer are you a
[1:07:43] Believer I want you to get the depth of
[1:07:45] this quote it's more than just a surface
[1:07:49] mental idea he's saying something here
[1:07:52] to us a Believer is you want to know
[1:07:55] what a believer is the believer is the
[1:07:58] faith of
[1:08:01] God that
[1:08:03] moves in
[1:08:09] you was he the Living
[1:08:14] Word was he in
[1:08:18] action then what is the bride she he
[1:08:20] said she must and is the word living and
[1:08:24] in action
[1:08:27] amen she's the Bible bride other words
[1:08:31] she's the
[1:08:33] word for her day and season this is the
[1:08:36] season that it would be him in Bride
[1:08:40] form you want to know where he's coming
[1:08:43] people don't even see it they got it all
[1:08:44] they got all kinds of ideas about his
[1:08:46] coming
[1:08:49] right but we have the true revelation of
[1:08:51] his coming and we are the revelation of
[1:08:54] his coming
[1:08:57] amen
[1:08:58] hallelujah these aren't ideas this is
[1:09:01] the word this is the truth that's why I
[1:09:04] am is the truth I am is the way I am is
[1:09:08] the word I am is the
[1:09:11] resurrection and the life you are the
[1:09:14] resurrection and the life because you
[1:09:17] are the I am you're in him he's in
[1:09:21] you you say he's in me if that seed
[1:09:24] isn't in he can't be in
[1:09:27] you if you are not that predestinated
[1:09:29] seed there's no way for God to be in
[1:09:35] you but when you are that seed and he
[1:09:38] quickens that seed and it recognizes the
[1:09:41] seed recognizes the word for the hour
[1:09:44] for the season for the time and acts it
[1:09:50] out not not trying to make believe and
[1:09:53] pump up this and pump up that it does it
[1:09:56] automatically because if I had the
[1:09:58] spirit of Christ I would live what
[1:09:59] Christ lives if I had the spirit of
[1:10:01] bethoven I'd write music if I had the
[1:10:03] spirit of Dillinger I'd be a murderer
[1:10:05] why because I have his spirit and if you
[1:10:08] have the spirit of God how are you going
[1:10:09] to disbelieve any word of
[1:10:14] it so when the that seed is quickened
[1:10:17] down you're that seed quickened the
[1:10:18] lights come upon it the water poured
[1:10:20] upon it and it quickened that seed to
[1:10:22] life
[1:10:26] amen and you say I've always been that
[1:10:29] word the old Catholic priest said
[1:10:31] brother brand he said Mr
[1:10:33] brandom God is in his
[1:10:36] church he said brother brandom said no
[1:10:39] he said God is in his
[1:10:46] word now I hope you get a hold of
[1:10:49] that amen because what's in you that
[1:10:52] Christ in you birth in you will recogniz
[1:10:55] the word you cannot go out there and say
[1:10:59] well well I I just believe this I
[1:11:01] believe this word yeah I'm not qu
[1:11:04] disqualifying the fact that you believe
[1:11:06] it you can't be a seed and disagree with
[1:11:09] the
[1:11:10] word you can't be his seed and disagree
[1:11:13] with the word because the word is the
[1:11:15] seed and if you are that word how can
[1:11:18] you disagree with
[1:11:24] it oh the Holy Spirit can't be in you
[1:11:26] and live some other life but his word
[1:11:29] manifested in the season and the hour
[1:11:32] that is present that it's here to
[1:11:36] do because it come to your time your
[1:11:39] time your season and here you are living
[1:11:41] out that part that God said you would
[1:11:44] live out you're that portion of that
[1:11:47] word you didn't live in another time if
[1:11:51] I lived in Luther's time I would believe
[1:11:53] with all my heart justification by faith
[1:11:56] I do today if I lived in Wesley time I
[1:11:59] believe in sanctification by the blood I
[1:12:01] do
[1:12:02] today only it's opened even further to
[1:12:05] us today if I live in Pentecostal time
[1:12:08] and I had and I was in that time that
[1:12:10] was my age I would believe in the
[1:12:12] restoration of the gifts and the baptism
[1:12:14] of the Holy Ghost but if I stay in that
[1:12:17] babyhood I'm not going to mature so
[1:12:19] there had to come a sunlight and a sun
[1:12:21] in its strength for you and I to mature
[1:12:24] into him his very
[1:12:27] being and that was kept a secret before
[1:12:30] the foundation of the world until the
[1:12:32] hour of the seventh Angel's message
[1:12:35] which is the seventh seal which is
[1:12:37] Revelations
[1:12:40] 10 and now it comes into a body you
[1:12:44] begin to eat of that word open to you
[1:12:46] you can't get enough of that and you
[1:12:48] grow into the very thing you're eating
[1:12:50] amen and you're and he's prophesying
[1:12:53] through you amen preaching through you
[1:12:56] and you become the final voice to the
[1:12:58] final
[1:13:02] age see it's not David it's not David
[1:13:06] out here this brother that brother this
[1:13:07] sister sister no it's
[1:13:12] Christ you've come from God you're
[1:13:15] returning back to him the whole thing
[1:13:17] has have been the the the mystery of
[1:13:19] redemption it's every bit of it comes
[1:13:22] right back around now we're coming right
[1:13:23] back to what what we didn't realize in
[1:13:25] the beginning we realize here at the end
[1:13:28] that's exactly what restores us and sets
[1:13:31] us totally
[1:13:34] free amen amen amen he had to manifest
[1:13:38] his attributes do you understand he has
[1:13:41] to manifest his as a savior a husband a
[1:13:44] bride a wife a Healer all these
[1:13:47] attributes of himself a
[1:13:50] deliverer he has to manifest himself as
[1:13:52] the Victor he had to manifest himself
[1:13:55] Victory and you're his victory you're
[1:13:57] his faith and you're his victory because
[1:13:59] the believer is the faith of God other
[1:14:01] words the believer is the revelation of
[1:14:03] God
[1:14:08] himself which the Revelation is the
[1:14:10] substance of things hoped for the
[1:14:13] evidence of Things Not

[1:23:01] aable in here what about in
[1:23:04] here there ought to be something
[1:23:05] bubbling in here if you're going through
[1:23:07] the hardest trial the hardest stress and
[1:23:09] persecuted and cast down and everything
[1:23:11] the Bible just we just said you know

[1:23:29] wrong with the church a bride people
[1:23:31] that are not suffering why do I want to
[1:23:34] suffer no but the suffering is only to
[1:23:36] glorify him manifest him show that he's
[1:23:41] present Hallelujah God's got genuine
[1:23:45] gold they want to say gold is 2,
[1:23:48] something dollar an ounce I'll have you
[1:23:49] know it's beyond the
[1:23:51] worlds an ounce
[1:23:55] I may be an
[1:23:57] ounce of gold but I'm the same gold
[1:24:00] that's a whole
[1:24:01] gold I may be a shaving of it but I'm
[1:24:04] still that gold that gold is the I am
[1:24:07] and I'm a shaving then I am just as I am
[1:24:09] as he is that spoonful of water says the
[1:24:12] same chemical as the whole water that
[1:24:14] ocean I may be a spoonful of that ocean
[1:24:17] but I'm the
[1:24:19] ocean then I'll just remain in my place
[1:24:22] and carry out that portion that part by
[1:24:25] his power by his Revelation by his
[1:24:28] victory so I am his faith and I am his
[1:24:34] victory I am his
[1:24:37] Revelation Christ in me identifies that
[1:24:40] I am his Revelation because Christ in me
[1:24:43] brings the word that he spoken and
[1:24:45] uncovers it and reveals it to me
[1:24:47] personally there's your
[1:24:49] evidence not the emotion right I don't
[1:24:53] say there 's not emotion with it but you
[1:24:56] can have all the emotion you want and
[1:24:58] still go to hell you can have all kinds
[1:25:00] of emotion of the Holy Spirit present
[1:25:02] cast out devils and still be
[1:25:05] lost because that Spirit I'm not talking
[1:25:08] about the soul I'm talking about the
[1:25:09] middle middleman that middl man can be
[1:25:10] Anointed with the genuine Holy Ghost
[1:25:12] receive a baptism of the genuine Holy
[1:25:15] Ghost and still not be the word
[1:25:18] inside the word recognizes the word the
[1:25:21] word manifests the word the word is the
[1:25:23] word
[1:25:29] Hallelujah Glory all right I heard
[1:25:33] brother Neville say this morning someone
[1:25:35] might have been asking why I didn't
[1:25:36] preach on the Holy Ghost why I didn't do
[1:25:39] this here it is the Holy Ghost is the
[1:25:42] action in you the Holy Ghost is the
[1:25:46] action in you
[1:25:51] moving the Holy Ghost is the action you
[1:25:54] it's a life not an
[1:25:59] emotion I can have all kinds of emotion
[1:26:02] out here and still be the I am on the
[1:26:05] inside I can have all kinds of
[1:26:07] frustrations all kinds of things as he
[1:26:09] judging me by that or is he judging me
[1:26:12] by what he is the word having come
[1:26:13] through the blood how can he see me any
[1:26:15] differently than himself he looks
[1:26:18] through the
[1:26:19] blood the Holy Ghost token identifies he
[1:26:22] has to look at the blood through the
[1:26:23] blood to me
[1:26:24] and he can't see me in air he can't see
[1:26:27] me he sees me faultless he sees me
[1:26:31] perfect and he said this is the message
[1:26:33] to you bride rising of the sun this is
[1:26:35] my message to you you're standing
[1:26:39] perfect glory to God Amen that's right
[1:26:45] he promised he would send you Heavenly
[1:26:46] light to ripen that word seed that was
[1:26:49] sown for this day you are that seed sown
[1:26:54] amen
[1:26:55] my it had to be spoken the only way you
[1:26:58] can be birthed is by the spoken
[1:27:02] word that little Eagle didn't know what
[1:27:04] an eagle meant he could be called an
[1:27:05] eagle he told he was an eagle but until
[1:27:08] that voice he heard that voice something
[1:27:09] resounded on the inside then he knew he
[1:27:12] was an
[1:27:15] eagle where's the evidence then see that
[1:27:18] you're an
[1:27:20] eagle amen amen all right
[1:27:25] the word is the seed that is so or sowed
[1:27:29] amen so watch it in action not an
[1:27:32] emotion not some sort of fleshly
[1:27:34] evidence but it is a person I am is a
[1:27:39] person and eternal life is a
[1:27:45] person I have eternal life then who's
[1:27:48] what person are you he said I'll build
[1:27:50] my church upon the foundation of the
[1:27:52] revelation of who I am

[1:38:11] said and start feeding on the open book
[1:38:14] if you don't have any desire and pulling
[1:38:16] yourself to feed on that open book I'm
[1:38:18] sorry for
[1:38:19] you cuz you're not recognized the day
[1:38:22] and the season you're in not recognizing
[1:38:24] the message of your day you're too taken
[1:38:27] up with fleshly ideas too taken up with
[1:38:29] the things the Earth which is nothing
[1:38:31] but temporal and it's passing away and
[1:38:33] it's
[1:38:35] dying and we have life and we have it
[1:38:39] more abundantly he said I've come to
[1:38:41] give you life and give you more
[1:38:43] abundantly so start believing in who you
[1:38:45] are quit looking at what you're not
[1:38:48] don't you realize the word has separated
[1:38:51] that and Jesus had had faith in the word
[1:38:54] that he said what he was it's written of
[1:38:57] me can't you go back and say it's
[1:38:58] written of
[1:39:04] me I came from him do you realize you
[1:39:07] came from him
[1:39:09] bride amen you're the promised word for
[1:39:12] the hour you're the promise of the hour

[1:39:16] the open
[1:39:18] book you're the record of eternal life
[1:39:21] you're him the eye am I'll finish right
[1:39:25] here didn't David and the Psalms the
[1:39:27] prophets and all speak of him I am the
[1:39:29] bread of life that come from God out of
[1:39:32] Heaven amen I'm the bread of life that
[1:39:35] came from God out of Heaven amen I am
[1:39:37] that tree of life from the Garden of
[1:39:39] Eden isn't that exactly what he said the
[1:39:41] bride was the tree of
[1:39:45] life amen what is it's the tree he's you
[1:39:48] said no no no no he's the Tree of Life
[1:39:50] yeah but he's got a
[1:39:51] bride and that bride can't be something
[1:39:54] other than him so she is also the Tree
[1:39:56] of Life the bride tree the prophet said
[1:39:59] you can't make it together and you not
[1:40:01] make it perfect can't full have the full
[1:40:03] Revelation without that bride
[1:40:05] tree Revelation
[1:40:07] 10 he said the seventh he said notice at
[1:40:11] the opening of the seventh seal Seven
[1:40:13] Seals Revelations 10 which is the
[1:40:15] message of the seventh angel the full
[1:40:17] word is to be born into manifestation
[1:40:22] again I'm just capping it off what we
[1:40:24] said tonight all right and Vindicated by
[1:40:27] the spirit of God in the full strength
[1:40:30] as it was when he was here on Earth
[1:40:33] manifested in the same way doing the
[1:40:35] same things that it did when he was here
[1:40:37] on Earth
[1:40:38] amen isn't that what we saw isn't that
[1:40:41] what was declared to us isn't that what
[1:40:42] Vindicated a
[1:40:45] prophet that he had the word for the
[1:40:49] hour and then that word the hour went
[1:40:51] into flesh and here we are manifesting
[1:40:54] that same word who are we then we are
[1:40:57] the

[1:44:27] of the pond that dark smudy
[1:44:32] Pond but brother
[1:44:36] sister let's realize something
[1:44:39] here Matthew 14:27 the last scripture I
[1:44:43] want you to read this while you're
[1:44:44] standing Matthew 14:27
[1:44:57] 26 and in the Fourth Watch of the night
[1:45:00] Jesus went unto them walking on the
[1:45:05] sea where is he
[1:45:09] today and when the disciples saw him
[1:45:12] walking on the sea they were troubled
[1:45:14] saying oh it's a spirit you better leave
[1:45:16] it alone Brother David be careful it's
[1:45:18] it might be a spirit on you
[1:45:23] say to you I don't to say it to me but
[1:45:24] I'm saying I'm preaching it tonight I'll
[1:45:26] be careful you want to you don't want to
[1:45:27] you don't want to get too serious with
[1:45:29] this now you know you know people
[1:45:30] misunderstand you know why because
[1:45:32] they're carnal
[1:45:35] minded not spiritual
[1:45:38] minded he that is spiritual minded
[1:45:40] what's the Bible say he discerns the
[1:45:43] difference between what is spiritual and
[1:45:45] what is
[1:45:46] natural is that right all right so see
[1:45:51] to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:45:54] peace all right then he said then but
[1:45:57] straight way Jesus spake unto them and
[1:45:59] I'm going to leave you with
[1:46:01] this be of good
[1:46:03] cheer it is

[1:46:14] world and you can't be that word seed
[1:46:17] alive in you without having the love of
[1:46:20] God in you because you can't have that
[1:46:23] faith without God's love they go hand in
[1:46:25] hand that faith that I've just spoke of
[1:46:28] tonight works by the love of God which
[1:46:31] God
[1:46:34] is don't try to put him on a don't so
[1:46:38] many don't understand agape love they
[1:46:40] make it felo feeling friendship and I'm
[1:46:44] nothing against that but Agape loves
[1:46:47] much
[1:46:47] [Music]
