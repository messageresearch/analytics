[4:49] I know.
[5:03] As I journey through the land, singing
[5:07] as I go,
[5:10] pointing souls to Calvary,
[5:13] to that crimson flow.
[5:16] Many arrows pierce my soul from
[5:20] withoutin.
[5:23] But my Lord leads me on through him. I
[5:28] must win.
[5:30] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[5:34] face.
[5:36] There to sing forever
[5:39] of his saving grace
[5:43] on the streets of glory.
[5:46] Let me lift my voice.
[5:49] Cares all past home at last ever to
[5:54] rejoice
[5:56] when in service for my Lord. Dark may be
[6:00] the night.
[6:02] But I'll cling more close to him. He
[6:06] will give me light.
[6:09] Satan snares may vex my soul. Turn my
[6:13] thoughts aside,
[6:15] but my Lord goes ahead, leads whatever
[6:20] be tight.
[6:22] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[6:27] face.
[6:29] There to sing forever
[6:32] of his saving grace
[6:35] on the streets of glory.
[6:39] Let me lift my voice.
[6:42] cares I'll pass home at last ever to
[6:46] rejoice.
[6:48] And when in valleys low I look toward
[6:52] the mountain high.
[6:55] And behold my savior there leading in
[7:00] the fight
[7:02] with a tender hand outstretched toward
[7:05] the valley low.
[7:08] guiding me. I can see as I onward go.
[7:15] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[7:20] face
[7:22] there to sing forever
[7:25] of his saving grace.
[7:28] On the streets of glory.
[7:32] Let me lift my voice.
[7:35] Cares all pass home at last ever to
[7:40] rejoice.
[7:42] When before me billows rise from the
[7:46] mighty deep,
[7:48] then the Lord directs my bark. He doth
[7:52] safely keep
[7:55] and he leads me gently on through this
[7:59] world below.
[8:01] And he's a real friend to me. Oh, I love
[8:06] him so.
[8:08] And oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[8:13] face
[8:15] there to sing forever
[8:18] of his saving grace.
[8:21] On the streets of glory.
[8:25] Let me lift my voice.
[8:28] cares all pass home at last ever to
[8:32] rejoice.
[8:36] Amen. God bless you friends. Good to be
[8:38] with you. God bless you to our visitors.

[8:52] is sweeter than the day before.

[9:12] one I'm waiting for.

[9:29] strong. E flat.

[10:02] one I'm waiting for.
[10:07] Every day with Jesus
[10:10] is sweeter than the day before. One more
[10:14] time. Oh, every day with Jesus
[10:20] is sweeter than the day before.
[10:25] Every day with Jesus,
[10:29] I love him more and more.
[10:34] Jesus saves and keeps me. And he's the
[10:39] one I'm waiting for.
[10:44] Every day with Jesus
[10:48] is sweeter than the day before.
[10:53] Amen.

[19:50] sing number 680.
[19:52] We'll just sing the chorus.
[19:59] Be possible to lower it a little bit. I
[20:00] don't think I can.
[20:06] I
[20:08] surrender
[20:10] all.
[20:15] I
[20:16] surrender
[20:19] all.
[20:24] All to thee, my blessed
[20:30] Savior,
[20:32] I
[20:34] surrender
[20:36] all.
[20:40] Oh, I
[20:42] sder
[20:44] all.
[20:48] I
[20:50] surrender
[20:52] all.
[20:55] All to thee,
[20:59] my blessed
[21:02] savior,
[21:04] I surrender
[21:08] all. One more time.
[21:12] I
[21:13] surrender
[21:15] all.
[21:19] I
[21:21] surrender
[21:23] all.
[21:27] All to thee my blessed
[21:33] savior.
[21:35] Amen.
[21:36] Surrender
[21:38] all.
[21:42] Verse four. Let's sing verse four there.
[21:46] All
[21:48] to Jesus.
[21:51] I surrender
[21:54] all
[21:57] in myself to thee
[22:04] with thy love and power.
[22:09] Let thy blessing
[22:13] fall on granted, Lord. Amen. All I
[22:18] surrender
[22:20] all.
[22:24] I
[22:25] surrender
[22:27] all.
[22:31] All to thee, my blessed
[22:37] Savior.
[22:39] I surrender
[22:43] all.
[22:47] How many is willing to surrender all?
[22:50] Amen. All means all. If you are
[22:54] surrendering to someone or an army
[22:56] surrenders to another army, they lay
[22:58] their weapons down and they they lay
[23:01] themselves down and they give over to
[23:03] that enemy.
[23:06] They just surrender all. They they let
[23:08] go.
[23:10] I thought that was very appropriate for
[23:12] what's on my heart tonight. Brother, God
[23:15] bless you. Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[23:23] Amen.
[23:24] It's definitely what we need to do is
[23:28] surrender. It takes a surrender. You
[23:31] know, the world doesn't want to
[23:32] surrender. You know what the world does?
[23:34] It surrenders to its own self.
[23:37] but surrendering to themselves not
[23:39] getting them anywhere
[23:41] &gt;&gt; because there's only one thing that'll
[23:43] that'll give you eternal life that'll
[23:45] bring you out of this mess that we're in
[23:48] and take you home and that's Christ
[23:50] himself only. That's all there is to it.
[23:52] There's nobody else can do that.
[23:55] It's only Christ. There's only one way
[23:58] out and that's through Christ. When you
[23:59] say I surrender all, we're singing that
[24:01] song to him. Then you surrender all.
[24:04] That means that means who are you
[24:06] surrendering to? You're surrendering to
[24:09] the creator of heavens and earth. You're
[24:11] surrendering to the one that brought you
[24:12] into this life. You're surrendering
[24:15] yourself to the word because he is the
[24:17] word. In the beginning was the word and
[24:20] the word was with God and the word was
[24:23] God. So anything that would add to or
[24:25] take away from that word
[24:28] is going to pervert that word. And
[24:31] that's what that's what a lot of
[24:33] Christianity has done today. So-called
[24:36] Christianity because to be born again is
[24:38] to truly be a Christian
[24:41] is have Christ living in you. And that
[24:43] takes a surrendered life. That takes a
[24:46] submission, a surrender to him, the
[24:48] word. So let's bow our heads in prayer
[24:52] before we go to the word. Our heavenly
[24:54] father,
[24:56] how we love you and how great thou art
[24:59] to be so mindful of us once again to
[25:02] bring us together, Lord, once again to
[25:06] have this freedom that we have to be
[25:10] assembled together, knowing it's not
[25:13] very many, but you said where two or
[25:15] three are gathered together in my name,
[25:19] there am I in the midst. So Lord, you're
[25:22] here. You're here to set free. You're
[25:25] here to deliver. You're here to heal.
[25:28] You're here to do all that you promised
[25:29] to do and said you would do. You're here
[25:32] to do it. All we have to do is accept
[25:35] it. You say, "How can we be set free?
[25:38] How can I give my heart and life to the
[25:41] one that brought me here? How can I
[25:43] submit myself to him?" That's just
[25:46] receive what he did for you.
[25:49] He paid the penalty of your sin. You
[25:51] say, "Well, what is sin?" Sin is
[25:53] unbelief. Lord, something that they left
[25:57] the promise. They they rejected the
[25:59] promise in the beginning. And that
[26:01] thrilled the whole human race into
[26:03] unbelief. But Lord, you made a way out
[26:06] of that by giving by coming down
[26:08] yourself,
[26:10] Lord, in the fullness of the Godhead
[26:11] bodily in one man, Jesus Christ. and
[26:14] through that shed blood brought life to
[26:17] those that would receive you. Not only
[26:19] brought salvation but healing, brought
[26:23] peace. And Lord, you did that because
[26:26] you desired and wanted and would and
[26:30] have accomplished the redemption of your
[26:32] own people, your own elect, your
[26:34] children. Lord, you come for your
[26:37] children to redeem them back to where
[26:39] they where they came from. And so we're
[26:42] thankful that we have an absolute. The
[26:45] absolute isn't ourselves. The absolute
[26:47] isn't our feelings. The absolute is the
[26:50] word. And we thank you for giving us
[26:52] your word. That word you've gave us is
[26:55] eternal. It cannot fail. It cannot fall.
[26:59] And you cannot lie. And so Lord, you've
[27:02] kept your word. You've always kept your
[27:03] word. You can't change your mind. You
[27:06] what you expressed into a word is
[27:08] forever settled. And so, Father, we give
[27:11] you praise as we open the word now and
[27:13] bring this tonight. We ask you to touch
[27:15] lives. We ask you to deliver lives. And
[27:19] Lord, may you fulfill your purpose in
[27:21] bringing forth the context of this
[27:23] message. I know that in myself, I can do
[27:26] nothing. I'm expecting you to speak
[27:28] through me. And for your glory and
[27:30] honor, I ask this in Jesus Christ's name
[27:33] who is now present. And asking in the
[27:35] name of the one that's here veiled
[27:37] behind skin. Lord, in believers, in
[27:40] Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[27:44] Amen. While you're standing, I'd like
[27:46] you to turn with me to the book of Luke,
[27:49] the 9inth chapter.
[27:58] And I have some scriptures here. My my
[28:01] title that I'd like to have or take
[28:04] tonight is deny or other words, I would
[28:07] say crucify.
[28:09] But deny the idol of self
[28:15] or I could say denying the idol of self
[28:20] and it takes vigilance.
[28:23] So we want to and don't my my subject is
[28:27] don't let self become an idol that you
[28:31] bow down to
[28:34] because an idol an idol is just an
[28:38] object. But an idol and I'll go into
[28:40] what an idol is here in just a moment.
[28:42] But in Luke 9:23, "And he said to them
[28:45] all," and we're speaking to us tonight.
[28:47] "And he said to them all, if any man
[28:50] will come after me,
[28:52] let him deny himself, take up his cross
[28:56] daily
[28:58] and follow me."
[29:00] And then I'd like you to turn with me to
[29:02] the book of First John.
[29:05] 1 John the 5th chapter
[29:10] and the 21st verse
[29:15] and then we'll go to another scripture
[29:16] and then I can have you be seated.
[29:22] St. John 5:21.
[29:25] Little children. Are there any children
[29:28] here? I'm not talking about children
[29:29] being little. I'm talking about children
[29:31] of God.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; We're all little. He's the great one.
[29:35] We're all his. We are his children. He
[29:38] that believeth what he's done and
[29:40] believe what he's given you and can
[29:43] receive it are the children of God.
[29:45] Amen. God has children. You didn't know
[29:47] that, did you? God has seed.
[29:51] Amen. And he said and he said to those
[29:53] seed, he said, "All that the father,"
[29:55] this is what Jesus said, "All that the
[29:57] father that was dwelling in him, God was
[29:59] manifested in flesh in him." And he
[30:01] said, "All that the Father hath given me
[30:04] will come to me, and I can lose none of
[30:07] them." So if you're one of them, you
[30:10] can't be lost. All it needs is for you
[30:12] to hear the truth, for you to hear what
[30:15] God did for you, and accept it, believe
[30:18] it with all of your heart, and follow
[30:20] what he said do, and he'll do the rest.
[30:23] Amen. So it's a committal to him.
[30:26] There's no other greater power than a
[30:27] total complete committal to God, to his
[30:30] word. There's only two powers in the
[30:33] earth today.
[30:35] That's the power of God and the power of
[30:37] Satan. There's two powers.
[30:40] And and every person, everything is
[30:43] controlled by one of those powers. Amen.
[30:46] So, we're not looking. And Satan isn't a
[30:49] man isn't a person with big horns and a
[30:51] forkid tail. No, he comes right down in
[30:54] a two-piece, three-piece suit.
[30:57] Amen. He's a deceiver. He deceived the
[31:00] first one in the beginning because he
[31:03] got them away from the word. And if he
[31:05] can get you away from the word, because
[31:07] see, in the beginning was the word.
[31:11] Amen. Everything. That's the original.
[31:14] Jesus said, "I am the way and I am the
[31:17] truth and I am life." Before we get too
[31:19] far, let's let's read the next. So in
[31:22] 5:21, 1 John 5:21, little children, keep
[31:27] yourselves from idols.
[31:30] Amen. How many would say amen?
[31:33] &gt;&gt; And I'd like you to turn to First
[31:34] Corinthians.
[31:37] Keep yourselves from idols.
[31:41] Now, we know that in the Bible, it
[31:42] speaks of many that were idol
[31:44] worshippers,
[31:46] but we'll go on a little deeper than
[31:48] that. It's not a stone we have laid up
[31:50] here or some something here that we're
[31:52] But an idol can be anything.
[31:56] Amen. Amen. So, first Corinthians 10 and
[31:59] verse we'll start with verse 12.
[32:03] Wherefore let him that thinkketh he
[32:05] standeth take heed lest he fall.
[32:12] There hath no temptation. That word
[32:14] temptation is a testing, a trial.
[32:18] There hath no temptation taken you. But
[32:21] such is common to man. But God is
[32:25] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[32:27] tempted above that you are able. But
[32:30] with but will with the temptation also
[32:33] make a way to escape.
[32:36] So other words, you're tempted. He's
[32:38] right there for the believer. You're
[32:40] going to be tried. You're going to be
[32:42] tested. But he's right there to make a
[32:45] way out. And he's made a way out. He's
[32:48] given us his word
[32:50] that can never fail. The Bible Jesus
[32:54] said, "Heavens and earth will pass away,
[32:55] but my words shall never pass away."
[32:58] Heaven and earth will. We're almost
[33:00] coming to a climax. We've already come
[33:02] to the end. How much longer? I don't
[33:05] know. But everything that Jesus said
[33:08] would happen is being happening.
[33:10] Earthquakes in diverse places,
[33:14] moons, stars, men's hearts failing for
[33:16] fear, volcanoes, everything is in a
[33:19] disruption. Why? Because it's at the
[33:22] end.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; But at the end, we were promised to have
[33:25] a message.
[33:26] And that message is the word of God
[33:30] that's come to us. Amen. in this hour
[33:33] and in this day through a means that he
[33:36] said he would come by and that's he
[33:38] would send his word through a prophet.
[33:40] Amen. And so God's word always comes to
[33:43] prophets. Amen. God Satan has the
[33:47] perversion of that. Satan has the
[33:49] opposite of that. See, he tries to
[33:51] pervert, add to, and take from God's
[33:53] word and do anything he can to hybrid
[33:56] it. There's a lot of hybriding today,
[33:58] isn't there?
[33:59] You see, but but this word can be
[34:02] hybrid. It's perfect. It's flawless. And
[34:06] you can't add to it and take away. It's
[34:08] perfect in itself. Amen. So, let's read
[34:11] here further and I'll have Wherefore, my
[34:13] dearly beloved, he's made a way. He'll
[34:15] make a way out. He said, "Wherefore, my
[34:17] dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. You
[34:21] may be seated." God bless you. So, let
[34:25] us flee. It didn't say just sit and just
[34:28] let it go by. Just flee idolatry. Amen.
[34:32] Idolatry before we read any further
[34:34] scriptures, idolatry
[34:37] is
[34:44] don't let he said now if you want deity
[34:47] now deity there's only one one deity
[34:50] that's God himself deity. If you want
[34:53] deity in your midst, then welcome and
[34:56] receive the word. Don't let anyone or
[34:59] anything get between you and that word.
[35:05] Amen. Don't let anyone or anything get
[35:09] between you and that word. Always take
[35:11] him first. Keep fortified for he is your
[35:15] fortress. Amen.
[35:18] Amen. So don't let anything
[35:20] &gt;&gt; get between you and that word. Now
[35:33] our nation, our nation is greatly
[35:36] covered over with idolatry.
[35:39] Why? Because something's come between
[35:41] the people and the word.
[35:44] They're not serving the word. They're
[35:45] serving an idol, something else instead
[35:49] of the word. And it says here, but
[35:52] that's see now now we might not worship
[35:55] wooden animals and so forth because we
[35:57] want to think of idolatry, but that's
[35:59] not all idolatry consists of. We
[36:02] sometimes make our automobiles, our
[36:04] clothes,
[36:07] &gt;&gt; our videos,
[36:08] our games, our food,
[36:11] anything.
[36:13] Anything. Anything
[36:15] between you and God is an idol.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Anything that comes between you and God
[36:21] is an idol. It can be yourself. And and
[36:24] I'm making this very clear.
[36:28] He said, "Deny yourself,
[36:31] take up your cross." What does cross
[36:32] mean? Death. What does the cross mean?
[36:35] If you deny yourself and take up your
[36:37] cross, you're crucifying what you think
[36:40] about the word. You're crucifying your
[36:42] own ideas, your own your own thinking
[36:45] about it, your own feelings over the
[36:48] word. Don't put any of that before you
[36:49] between you and the word. The word is
[36:52] complete. It doesn't need your ideas put
[36:56] to it. It doesn't need your
[36:57] interpretation. It does not need your
[36:59] opinion.
[37:01] You accept the word. To put anything
[37:04] else between you and that word, even
[37:06] your own feelings,
[37:07] &gt;&gt; even your own reasoning. Satan will try
[37:09] to reason with you. That's exactly how
[37:11] he got Eve in the beginning to fall by
[37:14] reasoning her against the word.
[37:18] Amen. So she took and she had to accept
[37:22] that first in her mind. There's
[37:23] something had to come there. She had to
[37:26] receive what the enemy was telling her.
[37:28] And you have an adversary today.
[37:30] Anything that's against the word is your
[37:32] adversary. anything that would come
[37:34] between you and believing that word.
[37:37] Just like a little child, just accept
[37:39] what he said, believe it and go on.
[37:42] Don't change it. Just stay with it.
[37:45] Amen. Anything that'll come between
[37:47] that. You can lift yourself up and
[37:48] think, "Well, I'll take care of this.
[37:50] I'm able to do this." No, you're not
[37:52] able to do it. If God gave you a promise
[37:55] and something comes in your thinking,
[37:56] your reasoning, your imagination, your
[37:59] feelings, anything contrary to that
[38:01] word, you put it before you and you bow
[38:04] to that, that's an idol. You need to get
[38:06] rid of that right away
[38:08] because nothing shall come between you
[38:10] and the Lord. If it does, it's an idol.
[38:14] And that's why we must crucify daily.
[38:17] crucified, take up our cross, deny
[38:19] oursel,
[38:20] kill our own thinking about it, and take
[38:22] the word. And Jesus said, "That's the
[38:25] way you follow me." And that has to be
[38:27] done daily because we're in a battle.
[38:30] We're in a battle. We are fighting a
[38:32] great battle. And the battleground isn't
[38:34] out here somewhere. The battleground I'm
[38:36] talking about, it's right there in your
[38:37] mind.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; There's where Satan will meet you. Satan
[38:41] chose the mind. God chose your heart.
[38:44] God chose the heart for the soul for to
[38:47] control you. You're not, you know, you
[38:49] you're outward here. You think this is
[38:50] all it. But if you take, you're a spirit
[38:52] being. I'm I'm I'm looking at you. I
[38:55] don't really see you. I see what's
[38:57] outside, but I don't see what's inside.
[39:00] What's the inside is what I'm talking
[39:02] to. That's what talks back to me. You're
[39:05] a spirit being. But inside that spirit,
[39:07] you were first a soul. And that soul had
[39:10] to come either from God as a seed of God
[39:12] or didn't. And that when you hear the
[39:15] word of God for your hour. It's like
[39:17] it's like the little illustration.
[39:20] You probably some may never heard this,
[39:22] but it's like the old farmer that put an
[39:24] eagle egg under a hen. Found the eagle
[39:26] egg. He put it under the hen. Well, the
[39:28] hen would set on that eagle egg.
[39:31] And because of the atmosphere of the
[39:33] hen's heat, the little eagle the egg
[39:36] hatched. But he was a strange looking
[39:39] bird because he wasn't a chicken. He was
[39:42] an eagle
[39:44] and he was that to begin with. And he
[39:47] couldn't stomach what was around him. He
[39:50] couldn't he didn't know what the
[39:51] clucking meant me meant. He didn't speak
[39:53] their language. He was different. What
[39:56] made him different because he was an
[39:58] eagle to begin with. He was caught up
[40:00] under the chicken yard, under the under
[40:03] the hen. But one day, the old mother
[40:07] eagle, she started looking for that
[40:09] young one that she knew she laid that
[40:11] egg. And she began to fly over and she
[40:15] saw him down there in that chicken yard.
[40:18] And she screamed to him and he looked up
[40:20] because that scream was something that
[40:22] responded within him because that was
[40:25] the scream of an eagle and he was an
[40:27] eagle to begin with. And that's exactly
[40:29] the way it is today. That little eagle
[40:32] heard the word of an eagle and he knew
[40:34] that's where he come from.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; And so he responded. There's many that
[40:40] won't respond. You know, God likened us
[40:42] to sheep.
[40:45] You know, a sheep can't defend itself.
[40:47] You know, a sheep is totally helpless.
[40:49] Do you know a sheep has to have a guide?
[40:51] It needs a shepherd.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; And we all like sheep have gone astray.
[40:57] Amen. Isn't that right? What the
[40:59] scripture said? Because when we when
[41:01] when the fall was in the beginning, it
[41:03] threw the whole human race into death.
[41:06] Because that that that
[41:09] took place was not an original way of
[41:12] God bringing forth children.
[41:14] Amen. Because Eve was only committed to
[41:17] Adam. Eve came out of Adam. God took her
[41:21] out of Adam. She was a part of Adam. But
[41:24] then she talked to the beast. And the
[41:26] beast was an upright being. I mean the
[41:28] serpent. The serpent was not a snake.
[41:32] The serpent was upright. He could talk.
[41:35] He communicated with Eve. And he said,
[41:38] and he got her to when the when the
[41:41] promise was God gave him one thing to
[41:43] keep. Don't eat of that tree of
[41:45] knowledge.
[41:48] But she was seeking for knowledge.
[41:52] Amen. She wanted to know why God would
[41:54] not allow her to eat of that tree. She
[41:56] wanted to know. So, Satan gave her a
[41:59] reason why.
[42:01] And when he did that, she he said, "You
[42:04] know, you were made for that purpose.
[42:06] You're a fruit bearer."
[42:09] That's right.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; And and and and God's trying to hide
[42:13] something from you. She wasn't able to
[42:15] wait. She wasn't willing to wait until
[42:18] God fulfilled the scripture.
[42:22] But she brought forth by by her
[42:24] receiving. First, she had to receive in
[42:27] her mind what Satan was telling her
[42:30] because God gave him a promise. You will
[42:33] not eat. If you eat of that tree, you
[42:35] shall die.
[42:37] Well, it wasn't a literal tree. That
[42:39] wasn't an apple. It wasn't a pear. It
[42:41] wasn't an apricot.
[42:43] It was life she received seed. She
[42:46] received the reasoning. Satan anointed
[42:48] that serpent. And that serpent could
[42:50] cohabitate with Eve.
[42:54] And because of that, she brought forth a
[42:57] son, but it wasn't Adam's son. She
[43:00] turned around and gave to Adam. And
[43:03] Adam, knowing what would happen if he
[43:06] took what God said don't do, he would
[43:08] throw the whole human race and
[43:10] everything else because he controlled
[43:12] nature. He controlled the earth. He was
[43:15] given possession of it. And when he did
[43:17] that, he throw the whole human race into
[43:19] death. Now, I'm just going to follow the
[43:22] Holy Spirit here tonight. I know many of
[43:24] you understand that there's others that
[43:26] don't. And I'm just going to follow what
[43:28] the Lord wants me to do, what he wants
[43:30] me to say.
[43:32] And when she when he did that, it threw
[43:35] everything underneath him into death.
[43:36] And death entered the human race right
[43:39] there. There was no death prior to that.
[43:42] But God in God instead of laying it lay
[43:46] like that, he provided right there
[43:49] something to clothe them with. They
[43:50] tried to clothe themselves through their
[43:52] own knowledge
[43:54] because they were they because I'm going
[43:57] to say this because they were naked and
[43:59] didn't even know it until that took
[44:02] place. Then they realized they were
[44:04] naked and began to want to cover up
[44:06] their shame.
[44:08] God said, "Who told you you were naked?
[44:10] Have you partaken of that tree?" And now
[44:14] now now today we see nakedness
[44:18] everywhere
[44:19] &gt;&gt; and they don't know it again.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. What what blind what kept
[44:26] them hid from it to begin with? It was
[44:28] stripped away and now they're hid by
[44:30] their own lustful desires. See? See now
[44:34] now and God said, "But I'm going to have
[44:36] I have a remedy. I'm going to provide a
[44:38] lamb." And that's exactly what Abel
[44:40] brought with Cain. They built an altar.
[44:44] They wanted to get back to God because
[44:46] they were put out of the garden.
[44:49] Amen. They wanted to find favor with
[44:51] God. And so in order to find favor, they
[44:54] built themselves an altar or a church
[44:56] and come to worship.
[44:58] And when they came to worship,
[45:01] then then Abel brought a different
[45:04] sacrifice than Cain. Cain brought the
[45:06] fruits of the field, something
[45:07] beautiful. He made his altar beautiful.
[45:09] He went to great effort.
[45:12] to work those works. He went to a great
[45:14] effort to bring about the sweat of his
[45:16] brow to bring a beautified church.
[45:18] Everywhere you see now, you have beauty
[45:20] everywhere.
[45:22] But that beauty was not received. God
[45:25] did not accept Cain's sacrifice. He he
[45:28] tried to find favor with God through his
[45:30] own effort.
[45:32] But Ca but Abel because Abel was a
[45:36] different seed.
[45:39] You remember they were brothers but they
[45:41] were half brothers.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Eve because she was named Eve before she
[45:48] her name was Eve she was the mother of
[45:50] all live I mean excuse me she before her
[45:52] name was Eve she was Mrs. Adam.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But after the fall Adam said your
[46:00] name shall be Eve which means the mother
[46:02] of all living.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, you know, it's kind of
[46:08] interesting. If you think apple made the
[46:10] made him see they're naked, we ought to
[46:12] pass the apples. Don't you think? You
[46:14] see, it didn't make them see it. What
[46:16] made them see it was that they aired in
[46:20] not believing what God said.
[46:23] That's why God hates idolatry. That's
[46:25] why God hates fornication. And he said,
[46:28] "They that commit those things will not
[46:31] see the kingdom of God." That's that's
[46:34] the earthly that's the that's the that's
[46:37] the humanness. That's the that is sin.
[46:41] Sin is not smoking and drinking and all
[46:43] these things. Sin is simply not
[46:46] believing what God made the way for you,
[46:48] the word of God. That's sin. And the
[46:51] wages of sin is death.
[46:54] So every man because of that fall is
[46:56] born now in sin, shaping iniquity, come
[46:58] in the world speaking lies. And I don't
[47:00] say man being a man. And I'm talking
[47:02] about men and women, humanity.
[47:05] Amen.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. They're born in sin,
[47:08] shaped in naked, but the gift of God,
[47:11] which is what we're going to we're
[47:12] providing here that he provided at
[47:15] Calvary because he took all my sin. He
[47:17] took it upon himself. See, because of
[47:19] that fall, nobody could redeem another
[47:22] person. There was nobody that could do
[47:24] that.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Nobody could do that.
[47:28] There was no man. There's no man. Every
[47:31] one of us were born in sin. Who could
[47:32] who could die for another and and and
[47:35] give them eternal life? Nobody. They
[47:38] fell from it, didn't they? But there but
[47:40] there's had to be a remedy somewhere.
[47:42] And God himself created himself in the
[47:47] womb of a woman called Mary. Mary had no
[47:50] sexual intercourse with
[47:53] with Joseph. Before she even came to
[47:57] Joseph and knew Joseph, she was found
[48:00] with child of the Holy Spirit. That's
[48:02] God himself. And God created that blood
[48:04] cell. God created himself. And why you
[48:07] say did he have to come through a woman?
[48:09] Because the fall came through a woman.
[48:12] She received the wrong seed in order to
[48:15] correct that. God had to come
[48:18] through a woman now to redeem back which
[48:20] was lost. He won't let his children lay
[48:23] lost. They have to he has to do
[48:25] something. So God himself stepped down.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; That was the perfect sacrifice. That was
[48:32] the perfect lamb that Abel by revelation
[48:35] God revealed to him what the sacrifice
[48:37] would be. And he dragged a lamb and he
[48:39] cut the lamb's throat and the lamb was
[48:41] bleeding
[48:43] dying. And that exactly was what God
[48:48] accepted. He said he accepted Abel's
[48:50] sacrifice, but he denied Cain, but gave
[48:53] Cain an opportunity to do what was right
[48:55] by accepting Abel's sacrifice and doing
[48:58] likewise, but he denied it. Why? Because
[49:01] his father wasn't Adam. Adam was a son
[49:04] of God. Adam came directly from God. He
[49:06] was a son of the serpent. And that
[49:09] serpent wasn't a human, but it was so
[49:11] close to a human that it could
[49:14] cohabitate or that seed, that germ would
[49:16] unite with a woman's seed. But you'll
[49:19] never have that happen today because
[49:22] what happened to that serpent? That be
[49:24] that serpent wasn't a snake. As I said,
[49:26] it was a beast. It was upright. It was
[49:28] just like a man. It was a big fellow.
[49:31] Amen. He was a beautiful person. He
[49:34] talked very intellectually. He talked to
[49:36] Eve. Here, I'll give you a reason why.
[49:38] Because God knows if you partake of
[49:40] that, why? You won't die. God said,
[49:42] "Well, God said we would, but oh, surely
[49:44] you won't." See, right there, he left
[49:45] the word
[49:47] and they did. So, you've got to remember
[49:49] God will keep his word.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; That's why we don't just throw the book
[49:55] around. It's just not a book to read.
[49:56] It's not history book. It's a book of
[49:58] life. There's a thought behind these
[50:01] words. And God put that thought and hid
[50:03] it in it in scripture. and those that
[50:06] have an ear to hear. He said, "My sheep
[50:08] will hear my voice, and his voice is his
[50:11] word."
[50:14] &gt;&gt; You're not sitting here by chance. God
[50:15] provided everything for you to be right
[50:18] here tonight. Nothing happens by chance
[50:21] with God. Nothing happens by chance with
[50:24] a Christian because all things work
[50:27] together for good to them that love God,
[50:29] to them that are the called according to
[50:32] his purpose. Amen.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; So nothing can happen by chance. He
[50:36] provided your coming here. He provided
[50:38] before the world began. You have no
[50:40] choice of your parents. You had no
[50:42] choice how you'd come here. You have no
[50:44] choice. But here you are tonight. And I
[50:47] say, "Who was it that brought you here?
[50:48] You think I did?" No, you didn't.
[50:51] Because Satan would have not wanted you
[50:53] to come here tonight to hear the truth.
[50:56] So God brought you here. Yeah.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Whether you realize it or not, God put
[51:02] something down in your heart that you
[51:04] were hungry. You don't even realize you
[51:06] were hungering. They that hunger and
[51:08] thirst for righteousness shall be
[51:09] filled.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm coming to my message here. I
[51:14] don't have much. I'll be I'll be I won't
[51:15] take a long time here,
[51:18] but you got to realize that there was
[51:20] two different seeds. And Eve was the
[51:23] mother of both of them,
[51:24] &gt;&gt; but Adam was not the father of both.
[51:30] That Cain that we know of was not Adam's
[51:33] son. No place in the Bible does it say
[51:36] Cain was Adam's son. The Bible said Cain
[51:39] was of that evil one.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; And he and his and his father was a
[51:44] murderer from the beginning. And he's a
[51:46] thief. And he comes to destroy and to
[51:49] steal what God's trying to give to you,
[51:51] life.
[51:53] Amen. See, there has to be original of
[51:55] anything. You cannot have a a bogus
[51:59] dollar or a or a or a counterfeit
[52:01] without it coming off of original.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; There has to be an original. You can't
[52:06] have wrong unless there's right. You
[52:09] can't have error unless there's truth.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; There has to be that first.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; You see, Satan is a perverter. He He And
[52:19] there's a there's something he cannot
[52:20] defeat, and that's the word of God. And
[52:23] when you receive the word of God, when
[52:25] you receive it, God told us how to
[52:27] receive it. He said, "I give you a gift
[52:29] that I give to you. You don't work for
[52:31] it. You don't have to do anything to
[52:33] receive it. It's given to you freely.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; He gives it to you. It's just whether
[52:38] you want to accept it or not. He died
[52:41] for you. He shed his blood. That blood
[52:42] was perfect blood. That blood was not a
[52:45] man's blood. It didn't come by sexual
[52:47] intercourse. It came by a divine spoken
[52:49] word creation
[52:51] of God himself. He put it in in Mary.
[52:54] Mary had no affair with Joseph. It
[52:56] wasn't Joseph's seed.
[52:59] See, the Bible said, "Unto us a son is
[53:01] given a virgin." Way back in Isaiah, a
[53:04] prophet said, "A virgin shall conceive
[53:06] and bear a son, and his name will be
[53:09] called Emanuel," which means God with
[53:11] us. Amen.
[53:14] It was God with us. God himself stepped
[53:16] down. No one else could take that place.
[53:19] So God himself, because of the love that
[53:21] he had for you, stepped down and took
[53:24] your sin upon his body, took it and laid
[53:26] it upon the head of the devil and took
[53:28] every bit of judgment that you should
[53:30] have had. See, because you were you were
[53:33] you comeded in sin. You were you were
[53:35] you you're already jailed. You when when
[53:38] you were born, you were defeated.
[53:40] You come to this earth defeated. And
[53:42] you've been wondering where your
[53:44] identity is. If you're wondering where
[53:45] your identity is, he's telling you
[53:46] tonight where is your identity. Your
[53:49] identity is in Christ.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; He's given you the word. He's giving you
[53:54] his eternal word. His word cannot fail.
[53:57] You can put you can rest on it. You can
[53:59] trust it. And so don't try to project
[54:01] yourself into it. Because when you do
[54:04] when you reject inject yourself without
[54:06] unless you crucify and lay yourself down
[54:09] and follow that word, you've put
[54:11] yourself as an idol
[54:13] &gt;&gt; before you and God before God.
[54:16] He's given us reasoning. Nothing's wrong
[54:18] with reasoning, imagination, memory,
[54:20] conscience, see, taste, feel, smell,
[54:22] hear, not a thing. Unless they disagree
[54:25] with the word.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; And if they disagree with the word, then
[54:29] here's what you need to do. faith. Faith
[54:33] which is God's faith. Bible said we
[54:35] don't we don't receive God by works.
[54:37] There's nothing you can do to merit
[54:39] God's favor.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; The Bible said for by grace which is
[54:43] God's enablement to you giving you the
[54:46] ability to receive from him. Grace saved
[54:49] you. For by grace are you saved through
[54:52] faith. And that's not of yourselves. It
[54:55] is the gift of God. God's given you a
[54:57] gift. You say, "What do I have to do to
[54:59] get it?" Accept it.
[55:01] receive it.
[55:05] Why would you reject? How could you
[55:07] reject something that's eternal? See,
[55:09] you can't. It would be you'd be you you
[55:12] wouldn't have a right mind. That's what
[55:13] Cain Cain did not accept it because he
[55:16] couldn't.
[55:19] But he offered to it. It was offered to
[55:21] him. He made the decision not to.
[55:25] And we sat with the word realizing what
[55:27] God's done for us. God did it for us.
[55:30] God sent that. And when that that when
[55:32] that blood was left that body and the
[55:35] judgment that we should have stood, we
[55:38] were we were doomed to die. But
[55:40] something took our place
[55:43] &gt;&gt; and wrote across his word, pardoned,
[55:48] &gt;&gt; pardoned David. Pardon him. Why? Because
[55:50] I realized I was a sinner. I accepted
[55:53] what he did for me and I repented and
[55:55] turned around. I was going one way, the
[55:57] wrong way, and now I'm going the right
[55:59] way. I turned around. I repented. I
[56:01] said, "Lord, I've lost. I was wrong. I
[56:04] have sinned. Forgive me. And he that he
[56:06] that will he that will come to me, I
[56:09] will no wise cast out."
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's forgiven us all of our sin,
[56:14] healed our sicknesses. Everything we
[56:17] have need of has already been provided
[56:19] &gt;&gt; already. Just think of that. everything
[56:22] you need
[56:23] &gt;&gt; because you are a person on the inside.
[56:26] You're not a Everybody wants to judge by
[56:28] the outside. You if you try to judge
[56:31] yourself when the word says a certain
[56:33] thing and you say, "Well, I can take
[56:35] care of this. I do this." No,
[56:38] you've got to accept the word. You've
[56:40] got to accept the truth,
[56:42] not lift yourself up. Y when you put
[56:45] yourself up there between you and that
[56:47] word and take what you think, take what
[56:49] you feel, take what you reason, that's
[56:51] contrary to the word and contrary to
[56:53] what God said,
[56:56] then you've placed an idol between you
[56:57] and God.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Flee idolatry, little children,
[57:03] &gt;&gt; flee it.
[57:05] Leave it alone. God's given you
[57:06] everything you need to bring forth that
[57:08] goal that he put inside of you, his own
[57:11] life. Amen. Amen. So, so you you when
[57:16] faith when God's faith God's faith will
[57:19] take its rest place on his eternal
[57:22] unmovable word. That's where faith takes
[57:24] its rest
[57:27] in the immovable eternal word of God.
[57:29] And when the five senses of the body or
[57:32] spirit disagree, see there's five senses
[57:34] of the body. See, taste, feel, smell,
[57:36] and hear. Your spirit being in there
[57:38] which has imagination, reasoning,
[57:40] memory, conscience, and affection.
[57:42] Right?
[57:43] &gt;&gt; That's your spirit man
[57:45] &gt;&gt; controls that spirit man. But inside of
[57:48] that is a soul. And that soul either
[57:51] came from God or it isn't of God.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; If it isn't of God, you'll never receive
[57:56] the word of God. If it is of God, you'll
[58:00] accept my sheep will hear my voice.
[58:04] Any man's voice is his word. You had to
[58:06] think it to say it. Anytime you speak a
[58:09] word, you have to think it first and say
[58:11] it.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; That's what God did. In the beginning
[58:14] was the word. There was a thought behind
[58:16] that. And the word was God and the word
[58:19] was with God and the word was God.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; And then the word became flesh and dwelt
[58:25] among us in Jesus Christ. And because of
[58:28] acceptance of that life, that life can
[58:30] come in you and live its life through
[58:31] you.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes you an oddball to the
[58:34] world.
[58:37] But I have life. You have life.
[58:41] Amen.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't There's none. Everything
[58:45] we see around us is temporal. We don't
[58:48] live by what we see. We live by what we
[58:50] believe.
[58:53] Amen. All right. So when when these five
[58:56] senses come up and disagree with faith,
[58:58] they disagree with the word of God, then
[59:01] leave the five senses alone.
[59:04] When Jesus make when he speaks his word
[59:07] and makes you a promise, that inside man
[59:10] says that's true. The outside man, which
[59:14] is your enemy, your adversary, that's
[59:16] the outside man. You want to know the
[59:18] biggest enemy you've got?
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Is you.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; This outer man, this carnal man right
[59:27] here is the biggest enemy I've got.
[59:30] It'll contrary everything I want to do
[59:32] because this man has not been born
[59:34] again. What's in my soul has been born
[59:37] again
[59:38] &gt;&gt; and I have the life of God in me. That's
[59:41] why I cannot deny this word. I believe
[59:43] the word.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. See the Bible said Jesus said you
[59:49] must be born again. It's not enter into
[59:51] your womb mother's womb the sec first
[59:53] second time. No, it's a spiritual birth.
[59:57] He that's born of spirit is spirit. He
[59:59] that's born of the flesh is flesh.
[1:00:02] Amen. This flesh is passing away. You
[1:00:05] know it. You're getting older. I'm
[1:00:06] getting older. It will be no many too
[1:00:09] many turns the sun and I'll leave.
[1:00:12] Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; But that inside of me, that inside of
[1:00:16] the inside is eternal. And the Bible
[1:00:18] said if I body, if this earthly
[1:00:20] tabernacle be dissolved, I have one
[1:00:22] waiting for me.
[1:00:24] Amen. And you say, "Well, where is your
[1:00:26] mother and father?" My mother and father
[1:00:27] in bodies that are young,
[1:00:30] brand new. You said, "How do you know
[1:00:31] that?" Because we had one to go beyond
[1:00:33] the curtain of time
[1:00:36] according to the word. Amen. And tell us
[1:00:39] exactly what the scripture said. It went
[1:00:41] right with the scripture.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; There was a body waiting. There's a
[1:00:46] young body waiting that never gets old
[1:00:48] again. Never will. But in order to make
[1:00:51] that, you have to accept what Jesus did
[1:00:54] for you.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; And by acceptance of that,
[1:00:58] amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Then you can be received. You receive
[1:01:01] his life. How can you die? You say,
[1:01:04] "Well, I'll die." You die here, but that
[1:01:06] can't, but you can't die. He that liveth
[1:01:09] and believeth in me shall never die.
[1:01:11] Jesus said, "He that believeth in me
[1:01:13] shall never shall never die."
[1:01:17] Amen. He that has me, how can you die
[1:01:20] when you have the eternal one and you
[1:01:22] being born again are born of that word?
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; You can't die. You see what the people
[1:01:28] have done? They've left the word. When
[1:01:31] you leave the word, you leave him. Amen.
[1:01:34] Because he's the word. To put anything
[1:01:36] between you and that word. You put
[1:01:39] something else that you'll bow to.
[1:01:41] You've left the word. And you had in
[1:01:44] order to believe the devil's lie, you
[1:01:46] have to reject the truth first.
[1:01:49] In order to believe his lie, you have to
[1:01:51] deny the word first.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Let's lay down ourselves. The Bible
[1:01:58] said, the Bible said this in Proverbs
[1:02:01] 3:5. It said, "Trust in the Lord with
[1:02:03] all thine heart,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; and lean not to your own understanding,
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; but in all thy ways acknowledge him, and
[1:02:12] he shall direct your path."
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you what you want? You can't
[1:02:18] figure out your path. You have to be
[1:02:20] led.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; A sheep goes astray, it's gone. He can't
[1:02:24] It can't defend itself. A horse can
[1:02:26] kick. A bird can fly. A sheep lays
[1:02:29] helpless.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Why did he make us that way?
[1:02:32] Because we were made to depend entirely
[1:02:34] upon God.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; If you depend upon yourself, it's going
[1:02:39] to lead you in the wrong direction.
[1:02:40] Depend upon education, it will never set
[1:02:42] you free.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that can set you
[1:02:45] free and that's Christ.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, anything that comes between
[1:02:50] you and God as an idol, sometime we make
[1:02:52] our churches idols. We should never do
[1:02:54] that. God is the only one we should
[1:02:57] worship. And it's not just in church.
[1:02:59] Going to church will never save you.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; You can go to church every day of your
[1:03:04] life and be lost. It's the acceptance of
[1:03:07] his life. He poured out his blood. That
[1:03:09] blood was perfect blood and it's loosed
[1:03:10] you from sin. It set you free.
[1:03:14] You say, "But what do I have to do?"
[1:03:16] Nothing. You just have to receive it,
[1:03:18] believe it, and accept it and do what he
[1:03:21] said.
[1:03:23] Just obey his command. He'll take care
[1:03:25] of the rest of it.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; He's provided it all.
[1:03:29] Amen. You already were his. Before the
[1:03:32] world began, you were his. You always
[1:03:35] were a son of God. Just like the eagle
[1:03:38] always was an eagle. And when he come in
[1:03:40] contact with the word, what'd it do?
[1:03:43] Something inside of that person leaped
[1:03:45] to life and said, "I've never heard it
[1:03:47] that way. I believe that." Amen. So,
[1:03:50] let's let's just go a little bit further
[1:03:52] here.
[1:03:54] Philippians 2:13 said, "For it is God
[1:03:56] which workketh in you."
[1:04:01] For it is God which workketh in you both
[1:04:03] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:04:08] So why would we look to our feelings and
[1:04:10] our senses? Let's lay down that idol.
[1:04:13] Let's not lift that idol up. See? Amen.
[1:04:17] Because we because that's just an idol.
[1:04:19] See, we better destroy your enemy. You
[1:04:22] better destroy your enemy. You say,
[1:04:24] "Where's my enemy?" Like I said, the
[1:04:26] greatest enemy you've got
[1:04:28] right here. We need a place of yielding
[1:04:31] to the spirit. And a man never knows
[1:04:34] what it is to live a victorious life
[1:04:36] until he's completely overcome who
[1:04:40] himself.
[1:04:42] That's the biggest enemy. Another place
[1:04:44] said the greatest enemy. I'm reading
[1:04:46] from a prophet of the word here.
[1:04:50] You believe that? All right. All right.
[1:04:53] That's the biggest enemy you've got is
[1:04:56] yourself. Now, I'm not You say, "Why do
[1:04:58] you trust that?" Because the Bible said
[1:05:00] God would do nothing, but he would
[1:05:01] reveal himself first. If he's going to
[1:05:03] do anything, he reveals himself first to
[1:05:06] his prophets. The word of the Lord comes
[1:05:08] to his prophets. All the way through the
[1:05:10] Bible, they spoke God's word. Those that
[1:05:13] rejected lost. Those that accepted it
[1:05:16] received life.
[1:05:18] All right? So the biggest enemy you've
[1:05:20] got is yourself. That's the reason you
[1:05:24] can't rise in faith because you got
[1:05:25] intellectuals there. Your intellectual
[1:05:27] part says, "Well, this or that." It's
[1:05:29] reasoning. As I said, if the if the God
[1:05:32] makes you a promise and the inside man
[1:05:34] says, "That's the truth." And the
[1:05:36] outside man but said, "But that's not
[1:05:37] the truth to you." And here's the reason
[1:05:39] why. What are you going to do? You let
[1:05:41] go of the outer man
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; and take you deny the outer man. You
[1:05:46] take that inside man. Trust in the Lord
[1:05:49] with all thine heart and lean don't lean
[1:05:51] to your own understanding. As soon as
[1:05:53] you lean to your own understanding, you
[1:05:55] raised up an idol between God and
[1:05:58] yourself.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:01] All right,
[1:06:04] Mary. When the word came to Mary and
[1:06:06] said, "Well, how will this be? You're
[1:06:08] going to have a son, Mary." Here's an
[1:06:10] angel of God speaking there with the
[1:06:12] word of God and told Mary, "You're going
[1:06:13] to have a son."
[1:06:17] And Mary said, 'How can this be knowing
[1:06:19] no man? Because that's never happened
[1:06:21] before. How can me, a virgin, have a
[1:06:24] child without a man?
[1:06:28] He said, "The Holy Ghost will overshadow
[1:06:30] you." And that holy one to be born in
[1:06:32] you will be of the Holy Ghost himself.
[1:06:35] Amen. So as I say, Jesus blood was
[1:06:38] perfect blood and his blood is the only
[1:06:40] thing that can loose you. It's not that
[1:06:43] we have the the actual blood in our
[1:06:45] hands here or here before us, but it's
[1:06:48] that faith in that shed blood that
[1:06:51] brings that blood, that life that's in
[1:06:53] that blood to an effectiveness to you.
[1:06:57] It transforms you because you've
[1:06:59] accepted him. Amen. He that receiveth
[1:07:03] me, I will in no wise cast out. He that
[1:07:06] asks forgiveness, I will forgive him.
[1:07:09] Amen. I'm I'm just forgive him of his
[1:07:12] sins. See? So,
[1:07:16] it's just your decision. All right. Now,
[1:07:20] so that's that's an idol. So, I say we
[1:07:22] better destroy our enemy before your
[1:07:24] enemy destroys you.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You destroy him.
[1:07:32] And as I said, you can't believe the
[1:07:34] devil's lie until you have disbelieved
[1:07:35] God's truth. You have to accept it. Eve
[1:07:39] had to accept what Satan was telling her
[1:07:41] through that serpent. She had to accept
[1:07:43] it in her mind before the act could be
[1:07:45] taken and done. She had to receive it
[1:07:48] there. She had to deny the word of God.
[1:07:50] Take what he said. And you can see what
[1:07:52] happened. It brought death.
[1:07:55] So there's only one thing that can bring
[1:07:56] life. Reverse the crime. He had to come
[1:08:00] back through a woman. Jesus did. But
[1:08:02] that was not by sexual birth. That was
[1:08:05] by the word, spoken word as it was
[1:08:07] should have came in the beginning and he
[1:08:10] brought it back under the word. And now
[1:08:12] where's our absolute? It's the word.
[1:08:15] That's why the Christians today, a real
[1:08:17] Christian is an oddball to anyone else.
[1:08:20] That's why they dress different. Because
[1:08:22] why? Because they're living according to
[1:08:24] what God said for them to do.
[1:08:27] You see, it's a victorious life. It's a
[1:08:29] beautiful life. You don't really have
[1:08:31] joy until you know the Lord. You don't
[1:08:32] have know what peace is until you know
[1:08:34] him. You say, "I got peace." Without the
[1:08:37] Lord, you have no peace.
[1:08:40] Amen. Without him, you have no joy
[1:08:43] because you you say, "I got joy. I got
[1:08:45] happiness." But it's only temporal. But
[1:08:47] we're not talking about temporal things.
[1:08:49] We're talking about eternal. Those
[1:08:50] things that are seen are temporary.
[1:08:52] They're temporal. The things that are
[1:08:54] not seen are eternal.
[1:08:57] And there's only one eternal, and that's
[1:09:00] God himself.
[1:09:02] Amen. So, so if we go over here to first
[1:09:06] first Peter, if you'd like to turn me
[1:09:08] over to First Peter,
[1:09:23] First Peter and um
[1:09:27] like
[1:09:32] Chapter 5.
[1:09:41] And let's begin reading with the fifth
[1:09:42] verse.
[1:09:45] Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves
[1:09:47] unto the elder, and you and all of you
[1:09:49] be subject one to another, and be
[1:09:51] clothed, this is what I'm driving at, be
[1:09:53] clothed with humility, for God resisteth
[1:09:56] the proud, and giveth grace to the
[1:09:58] humble.
[1:10:00] Humble yourselves, therefore, under the
[1:10:02] mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
[1:10:05] you in due time, casting all your care
[1:10:08] upon him, for he carth for you. Be
[1:10:12] sober, be vigilant. There's the word I
[1:10:15] want to use. Be sober. Be vigilant. Be
[1:10:17] on guard. Be aware.
[1:10:20] See, because because your adversary,
[1:10:23] your enemy.
[1:10:26] Now, you say, "Well, that enemy is
[1:10:27] Satan." Yet, the enemy the greatest
[1:10:29] enemy you've got is right here. Satan
[1:10:32] will try to use your senses to get you
[1:10:35] to try to disbelieve God's word. Don't
[1:10:38] you disbelieve God's word. God's word is
[1:10:40] flawless. As I said, it doesn't need
[1:10:42] your opinion. It doesn't need a second
[1:10:44] opinion about it. What he said is truth.
[1:10:47] All truth. Absolute truth. And it is
[1:10:50] impossible for it to not happen. You
[1:10:53] believe it. It's got to happen. You put
[1:10:56] it under faith and put it in faith. That
[1:10:58] faith has got must bring that word that
[1:11:00] he promised to pass because that was
[1:11:02] God's way of doing it. Believe and you
[1:11:05] shall receive it. Believe you receive it
[1:11:07] and you shall have it.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? Ask whateversoever
[1:11:12] you desire when you pray. Believe you
[1:11:14] receive it whether you feel anything or
[1:11:18] not. Mary said when that angel said
[1:11:20] you're going to have that child, she
[1:11:21] didn't stop and think, "Now wait a
[1:11:22] minute. Now wait a minute. That never
[1:11:24] happened. That's impossible for that to
[1:11:27] happen." She didn't question it. Before
[1:11:29] she felt anything, she said, "Be it unto
[1:11:32] me according to thy word." And you know
[1:11:36] the rest of the story. She brought forth
[1:11:38] that son and that was Emmanuel. That was
[1:11:42] God with us. That was God himself formed
[1:11:45] himself in a body. He created the egg.
[1:11:50] That wasn't Mary's egg. And he created
[1:11:53] and he created the germ. That was not
[1:11:56] Joseph. That was God himself. What did
[1:11:59] he come to the earth to do? Shed his
[1:12:01] blood. take the judgment that you should
[1:12:04] have taken yourself.
[1:12:08] Amen. You were bound for one thing, to
[1:12:10] die, but he took your place.
[1:12:14] And because he took your place and
[1:12:16] pardoned you,
[1:12:18] you're free. Absolutely free. He who the
[1:12:22] son sets free is free indeed.
[1:12:26] And if perfect blood has loosed you,
[1:12:28] there's nothing to be condemned for.
[1:12:29] There's no judgment. He took all of your
[1:12:31] judgment in himself.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; There's you don't have to stand before a
[1:12:36] white throne judgment now to be judged.
[1:12:38] You you are already judged. The word of
[1:12:41] God, your name was written in that book.
[1:12:43] You were able to hear and receive the
[1:12:45] word of God and and hear and receive it
[1:12:47] now. And that word's become your
[1:12:50] absolute.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[1:12:55] anything that stands between you and God
[1:12:57] is the idol. It takes it takes the place
[1:13:00] of God. What's that idol do? It takes
[1:13:02] the place of God. Why call me Lord,
[1:13:06] Lord, and do not the things that I
[1:13:09] command or say for you to do?
[1:13:13] See, everything teaches you away from
[1:13:15] the word. Education, science, theology,
[1:13:19] they're all of the devil. They will be
[1:13:21] destroyed and they'll come to nothing.
[1:13:24] There's only one thing that's going to
[1:13:26] stand. That's the word of God. And if
[1:13:29] that word be in you, then heavens and
[1:13:31] earth will pass away. But you cannot
[1:13:33] pass away.
[1:13:37] You say, "Well, what if this body goes
[1:13:39] to it's got to go to dust, but there's a
[1:13:41] soul in there that can't die. You'll
[1:13:43] enter another body." The Bible said,
[1:13:45] "All that the father has given me will
[1:13:48] come.
[1:13:50] No man can come except my father as he's
[1:13:53] doing now draws you except my father
[1:13:57] draws him. You can't come. You've got to
[1:13:59] come through one way. There's only one
[1:14:01] way provided by God for life.
[1:14:06] You must come by the way of the door.
[1:14:08] And Jesus Christ is the door to that
[1:14:10] sheepfold. You enter into that, you
[1:14:13] found refuge. You found protection and a
[1:14:16] mighty tower. and the righteous run into
[1:14:18] it and are safe. There's no other door.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no other door. That's why
[1:14:25] the devil hates the word. That's why
[1:14:28] Jesus defeated him
[1:14:31] out there in that desert.
[1:14:33] He said, "Why? You're God. If you be the
[1:14:35] son of God, you're hungry. Create
[1:14:37] these." He said, "Man shall not live by
[1:14:40] bread alone, but by every word that
[1:14:42] proceedth out of the mouth of God." He
[1:14:44] went back. He came back with the word
[1:14:46] and said, "It's written and Satan had to
[1:14:48] depart."
[1:14:50] If Eve would have done that to begin
[1:14:52] with, there would have been no death.
[1:14:55] If she'd said, "No, God said God said,
[1:14:57] "I'm going to stay right there." No
[1:14:59] matter how much he tried to pound, he
[1:15:02] No, God said it. She stood right there.
[1:15:04] She didn't bring herself up as an idol.
[1:15:10] Are you with me tonight? Do you
[1:15:11] understand what we're saying? I'm I'm
[1:15:13] mixing two things a little bit, but God
[1:15:15] has a purpose in that. You understand?
[1:15:18] The main thing is don't lift don't raise
[1:15:21] yourself up
[1:15:23] and place yourself between you and God.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; He started the work, he'll finish the
[1:15:31] work.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; He that began the work will finish it.
[1:15:35] He that called you, faithful is he that
[1:15:37] called you, who also he will do it. You
[1:15:40] don't do anything to earn salvation.
[1:15:43] There's nothing you can do because it's
[1:15:45] already provided for you.
[1:15:48] Amen. All right.
[1:15:52] Amen. So we see here then be sober, be
[1:15:56] vigilant because your adversary the
[1:15:58] devil is a roaring lion. Walketh about
[1:16:00] seeking whom he may devour.
[1:16:02] Whom steadfast who resists. Resist him.
[1:16:06] Resist means to turn him down. Resist
[1:16:08] him. steadfast in the faith,
[1:16:12] knowing that the same afflictions that
[1:16:14] are accomplished in your brethren that
[1:16:17] are that those same afflictions in them
[1:16:19] are in you that are in the world in
[1:16:21] them. But the but the God of all grace
[1:16:24] who hath called us unto his eternal
[1:16:26] glory by Jesus Christ after you have
[1:16:29] suffered a while make you perfect,
[1:16:31] establish, strengthen, and settle you.
[1:16:35] All right.
[1:16:38] Jesus himself learned obedience through
[1:16:41] what?
[1:16:42] Through the things he suffered. There's
[1:16:45] going to be suffering, but God's with
[1:16:46] you. When things raise up, things that
[1:16:49] you don't understand. There's many
[1:16:50] things I've gone through and things
[1:16:52] right now I don't understand. But I put
[1:16:53] it in God's hands.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; And when they're in his hands, he said,
[1:16:58] "I'll never leave you. I'll never
[1:17:00] forsake you. I will fulfill. You will
[1:17:03] know. You will hear. You will receive
[1:17:05] when you need to receive. So let God do
[1:17:08] his work. All you need to do is believe
[1:17:10] what he said and stand right there.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; And there's no way you hold that word.
[1:17:16] Satan has no ability to defeat you.
[1:17:20] Amen. All right.
[1:17:23] Remember, it's God which workketh in you
[1:17:25] both to will and to do of his good
[1:17:28] pleasure. 2 Corinthians 3. I'm I'm
[1:17:32] sorry. 2 Corinthians 10:3
[1:17:41] for through but though for though we
[1:17:44] walk in the flesh we do not war after
[1:17:48] the flesh
[1:17:50] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:17:53] fleshly are not carnal. So we don't war.
[1:17:57] We do not war. We are in a battle.
[1:18:00] Though we're in the flesh, we don't war
[1:18:02] after it. So lay down your thinking. Lay
[1:18:05] down your reasoning. Your warfare, your
[1:18:08] your It says right here,
[1:18:11] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:18:14] carnal. That's human. That's carnal.
[1:18:15] That's fleshly.
[1:18:21] But mighty. What is it? What is your
[1:18:24] What is the weapons of your warfare? But
[1:18:25] mighty through the word, God is the
[1:18:28] word, but mighty through the through God
[1:18:32] to the pulling down of strongholds.
[1:18:37] You see, you got to realize you didn't
[1:18:39] come from little single something,
[1:18:41] little single cell, little this. No, no.
[1:18:43] God placed you here. God knows, Satan
[1:18:47] knows that, right? Well, because he
[1:18:49] himself was created by God
[1:18:53] to be used as an instrument
[1:18:57] so that God's attributes of himself as a
[1:19:00] savior, as a healer, as a deliverer,
[1:19:04] etc., etc., etc., right down the line
[1:19:06] could be known.
[1:19:08] God will not lose his own. He's a
[1:19:11] provided a way out of this chaos. All
[1:19:15] you see around you is insanity. It's
[1:19:17] chaos and you know as well as I do. How
[1:19:20] do you get out of it? There's only one
[1:19:22] way. Jesus said, "I am the way."
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, if there's all the
[1:19:30] chaos, there had to be something that
[1:19:32] wasn't chaos to begin with.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; There's always a counterfeit to an
[1:19:36] original. There's one thing Satan can't
[1:19:38] do. He cannot create. He can only
[1:19:41] pervert.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; There's only one creator. That's God.
[1:19:47] There's only one eternal. That's God.
[1:19:50] Someday Satan will be nothing. He will
[1:19:52] be annihilated. See, you and I couldn't
[1:19:54] annihilate anything, but God can
[1:19:56] annihilate it and do away with it.
[1:20:00] You see, so nothing ought to cater.
[1:20:03] We're not here by chance. We didn't come
[1:20:05] into this hour by chance. We didn't come
[1:20:06] into this age by chance. And God has a
[1:20:08] word for us in this time.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] Amen. And it's the way of truth. And
[1:20:16] it's a way of life. And it and it's
[1:20:18] deliverance and it's salvation.
[1:20:20] It's redemption.
[1:20:24] It's your freedom. Absolutely free. You
[1:20:27] say, "Well, I'm free. I'm not bound to
[1:20:28] anybody." Yes, you are. You're bound to
[1:20:30] yourself.
[1:20:32] There's someone leading you. It's either
[1:20:34] God or this devil leading you. And God
[1:20:36] is the word. You've got to be led by
[1:20:39] something. You are likened to a sheep.
[1:20:43] You can't lead yourself.
[1:20:48] Amen.
[1:20:49] Amen. That's the truth. See, we could go
[1:20:53] a long ways on that. I could just keep
[1:20:54] preaching all night on this, but I I
[1:20:57] can't do it. I'm ready to close now.
[1:20:59] Galatians 2:20 said, "For it is God, for
[1:21:02] I mean that we are crucified with
[1:21:04] Christ."
[1:21:06] When Christ was crucified, his children
[1:21:09] were crucified with him. They were in
[1:21:10] him. The sin question is finished.
[1:21:14] There's no condemnation to them that are
[1:21:16] in Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:21:19] flesh but after the spirit. Amen. No
[1:21:21] condemnation. No judgment.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; You pass from it. For the spirit for the
[1:21:26] law God's laws operate.
[1:21:30] God's natural laws operate. But there's
[1:21:32] a law of the spirit. There's a law of
[1:21:33] faith. And the law of the spirit hath
[1:21:36] made you free
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; from the law of sin and death.
[1:21:40] Amen. You have an outer man that's
[1:21:43] against you because that outer man's got
[1:21:45] to die. But there's an inner man
[1:21:48] that can't die, that will hold steady to
[1:21:51] that word. That's that little eagle in
[1:21:53] there. That's why you either hear the
[1:21:55] word of God or you will reject the word
[1:21:58] of God.
[1:22:00] See, right here tonight, every one of us
[1:22:03] are brought to decision.
[1:22:06] either settle it right now that this
[1:22:07] word is your absolute and I'm going to
[1:22:09] live for him or go the other way. You
[1:22:13] have a choice.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; But remember this,
[1:22:19] God in his own infinite knowing said, "I
[1:22:23] will predestinate and elect my bride and
[1:22:27] they will choose me because I knew that
[1:22:29] they would do so before the foundation
[1:22:31] of the world. And because of that, I
[1:22:33] chose them."
[1:22:35] There you are. The Bible said he who
[1:22:37] chose me.
[1:22:39] I didn't choose him to begin with. He
[1:22:42] chose me because he knew
[1:22:45] that I would meet him at the word. 12
[1:22:48] years old. I sat in the seats just like
[1:22:51] you. Heard the word preached of my own
[1:22:54] salvation.
[1:22:56] And I was convicted over that.
[1:22:58] Conviction's good because you realize
[1:23:01] you've done wrong and you need a sal you
[1:23:03] need a savior.
[1:23:05] There's only one deliverance. You can go
[1:23:07] on in your life and go on have probably
[1:23:10] be blessed. Have this and that have that
[1:23:13] and have this and all of it will be
[1:23:15] nothing because there's nothing you can
[1:23:17] take with you.
[1:23:20] Amen. But one thing, life.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You never brought anything into
[1:23:27] this world. Naked I came into this world
[1:23:29] and naked I will go out. There's not one
[1:23:32] thing. So what's what's meaningful? What
[1:23:34] is meaningful? It's what your soul
[1:23:37] whether you're going to be you're going
[1:23:38] to receive the truth and be freed or not
[1:23:41] be free. You're going to end up at the
[1:23:43] end. One of the one of those other
[1:23:45] places
[1:23:47] you'll be condemned or be received. And
[1:23:50] you have to make the decision now.
[1:23:53] I mean now. I don't mean I trust
[1:23:56] tonight, but it doesn't mean I'm talking
[1:23:58] about now in this time and hour. You've
[1:24:00] come face to face with the truth.
[1:24:04] Amen.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; It's sad when a person knows the truth
[1:24:08] and then turns away from that truth
[1:24:09] knowing to do good and won't do it. It's
[1:24:12] called iniquity. But the Bible said he
[1:24:14] laid the iniquity of us all upon him,
[1:24:17] upon him. He was wounded for our
[1:24:19] transgressions. Yeah.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53:5. He was wounded for our He
[1:24:24] was wounded for David's transgressions.
[1:24:26] You put your name in it. He was wounded
[1:24:28] for David's transgressions. Bruised for
[1:24:30] David's iniquity. The chastisement of
[1:24:32] David's peace was upon him. And with his
[1:24:35] stripes, I'm already healed. You say,
[1:24:38] "What do I must do then? Receive him."
[1:24:40] And there was a unic one day that Philip
[1:24:43] was trans translated to
[1:24:47] went to that unic. So I'm sitting
[1:24:50] reading the same thing I just quoted you
[1:24:53] and said and Enoch and and the B and the
[1:24:56] scripture the Holy Spirit said to
[1:24:58] Philillip go connect yourself with that
[1:25:00] man and he questioned him. He says who's
[1:25:03] the scripture speaking of and so and so
[1:25:06] Philip took him through the scripture
[1:25:09] said this is who he's speaking of. He
[1:25:10] said then what must I do to be saved?
[1:25:12] said,"Repent, be baptized in the name of
[1:25:15] Jesus Christ, and you shall receive this
[1:25:17] gift of the Holy Ghost that I'm talking
[1:25:20] about, eternal life." And what is
[1:25:22] eternal life? It's himself. So, he comes
[1:25:24] in and lives in you and keeps you and
[1:25:27] holds you and walks with you.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a man called Enoch in
[1:25:32] the scripture
[1:25:34] that walked with God one day and was not
[1:25:36] because he walked with God. Who are you
[1:25:39] walking with this tonight?
[1:25:42] What are you believing?
[1:25:44] Who are you walking with?
[1:25:47] You said, 'What do I do? Remember they
[1:25:49] asked Peter on the day of of Pentecost
[1:25:51] when they come, they come out of that
[1:25:53] building filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:25:55] thought they were drunk. He said, "We're
[1:25:57] not drunk. This is only the third hour
[1:25:59] of the day. We're drunk in the Holy
[1:26:01] Spirit because God has kept his promise
[1:26:04] and we're recipients of that." and those
[1:26:06] and the and Peter just preached a little
[1:26:08] short sermon
[1:26:10] and and they said, "Well, then what must
[1:26:13] we do to be saved?
[1:26:16] What must we do? We're convicted. We're
[1:26:18] we're convinced this is right. Now, what
[1:26:20] must we do?" And Peter gave him the
[1:26:22] remedy. Excuse me. It wasn't a remedy.
[1:26:24] He gave him the cure.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; He gave them what God required.
[1:26:31] And 3,000 souls were brought into the
[1:26:33] kingdom of God right there.
[1:26:35] What called them? What was in them that
[1:26:38] would receive that call? That same
[1:26:42] person, that same word is right here
[1:26:45] tonight.
[1:26:47] Amen. No different. He's not changed. He
[1:26:50] can't change. He remains the same
[1:26:52] yesterday, today, and forever. Just
[1:26:54] think, you can trust something that
[1:26:55] can't change. Science changes, education
[1:26:58] changes, all those things. Satan uses
[1:27:01] every bit of that. You know that right
[1:27:03] at this time,
[1:27:05] Satan tried to give the kingdoms of the
[1:27:07] world because he won it through Eve.
[1:27:09] See, he g tried to give it to Jesus and
[1:27:11] Jesus knew he would get it, take it
[1:27:13] back, and he said, "Thou shalt not tempt
[1:27:15] the Lord thy God."
[1:27:17] Amen. So there you are.
[1:27:20] He will be done away with. You know
[1:27:22] who's going to possess every bit of this
[1:27:24] earth? Will be those that are his seed.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. His children.
[1:27:32] We own it all.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; The world thinks they got it. They don't
[1:27:37] got anything.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; They got vanity. They got something
[1:27:40] that's just a balloon that's ready to
[1:27:42] pop. Why? We could go on and on. The
[1:27:45] dollar is not worth anything. How many
[1:27:48] trillions of dollars do we owe now? The
[1:27:50] the the Federal Reserve. We borrowed it.
[1:27:55] What's How do you get out of this mess?
[1:27:58] There's only one way.
[1:28:01] Amen. And that's through Jesus Christ,
[1:28:03] our Lord. Do you love him?
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm gonna leave you just a couple
[1:28:09] things.
[1:28:11] My duty is to bear his name, not mine.
[1:28:15] Amen.
[1:28:17] Don't try to be a big something. Try to
[1:28:19] be a little something. It takes
[1:28:21] humility, humbling ourselves before God.
[1:28:24] Just let him work through you. in James.
[1:28:28] Let's just go over there because
[1:28:30] remember the Bible said, "He that
[1:28:31] humbles himself shall be exalted. He
[1:28:33] that exalts himself shall be abased,
[1:28:35] brought down."
[1:28:37] James 4. I have a lot of things I'm just
[1:28:40] bypassing now. Just going to be
[1:28:42] quitting. I'm going to close this off.
[1:28:44] James
[1:28:47] 4
[1:28:57] and verse seven. Remember, the seed of
[1:29:00] God shall possess the gate of the enemy.
[1:29:03] There's no gate the enemy has, but what
[1:29:06] the seed of God will possess. That's all
[1:29:08] there is to it. We possess every gate of
[1:29:11] that enemy.
[1:29:13] Amen.
[1:29:14] We are possessors. A lot could be said
[1:29:17] on that. James 4:7.
[1:29:21] Submit yourselves.
[1:29:25] Submit yourselves
[1:29:29] be therefore to God. There it is right
[1:29:32] there. What do we start off with? I
[1:29:34] surrender all.
[1:29:37] Submit yourselves. That's the first
[1:29:39] thing. Submit yourselves to God. That's
[1:29:41] the word. Submit yourself to what he
[1:29:43] said. Resist the devil and he will flee
[1:29:48] from you.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; What do you resist him with? Your
[1:29:51] intellects? No. Your reasoning? No. Quit
[1:29:54] trying to figure out a way. Just take
[1:29:56] what God said, believe it, stand with
[1:29:58] it. No matter what happens, comes or
[1:30:00] goes, God has a perfect time to manifest
[1:30:03] that word before you and for you. All
[1:30:06] right? So, draw nigh to God and he will
[1:30:09] draw nigh to you. You want to know how
[1:30:10] to come to God? Draw nigh to him. Draw
[1:30:13] nigh to him and he will draw nigh to
[1:30:14] you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners.
[1:30:16] Purify your hearts, ye double-minded.
[1:30:20] Amen.
[1:30:23] As I said, for me to live is Christ, to
[1:30:26] die is gain.
[1:30:28] I'm crucified with Christ. Nevertheless,
[1:30:30] I live. Yet not I, but Christ liveth in
[1:30:34] me. And the life that I now live in this
[1:30:37] flesh. I live by the faith. Not my
[1:30:40] intellects, not my feelings,
[1:30:43] not what it looks like. I live by the
[1:30:45] faith of the son of God. His own faith
[1:30:48] who saved me. Amen. I live by his faith
[1:30:51] who loved me and gave himself. What did
[1:30:55] he do? He gave himself for you.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; That's what I live by.
[1:31:03] Amen. Amen. That's exactly what we live
[1:31:06] by.
[1:31:14] There's one thing we got to master if we
[1:31:16] expect to fulfill God's desire in our
[1:31:18] life. That is, we have to master the
[1:31:20] thought of human ability.
[1:31:23] There you are. You've got to lay it down
[1:31:26] daily. Paul said, "I die daily." Jesus
[1:31:28] said, "Daily. Take up your cross and
[1:31:31] follow me." All right.
[1:31:34] So, if we ever get to a spot where we
[1:31:36] think that we can do it with our own
[1:31:38] intelligence, you've tried, you've
[1:31:40] tried, you've tried, why not just deny
[1:31:43] yourself, take the word of his promise
[1:31:46] and go forward with it, regardless of
[1:31:48] what children say, parents say, this one
[1:31:52] says, that one thinks, you obey God. You
[1:31:54] obey his word, and God will take care of
[1:31:56] the rest of it. All right? You have to
[1:32:00] take your stand. You say, "Well, if I
[1:32:02] take my stand for the word, I'm going to
[1:32:04] hurt so and so. I would rather hurt so
[1:32:06] and so than to lose eternal life and my
[1:32:08] savior."
[1:32:12] Amen. Because we got to have everything
[1:32:14] you do must have an absolute. So what is
[1:32:17] your absolute? What is the final word?
[1:32:19] Who governs you? The umpire of a ball
[1:32:22] game is I mean the ball game is umpired.
[1:32:24] Excuse me. The ball game is directed and
[1:32:26] controlled by an umpire. He's the
[1:32:28] absolute.
[1:32:31] Amen. If he says strike, you can argue
[1:32:33] all you want to,
[1:32:36] but you just might as well settle in
[1:32:37] your mind that it's a strike whether you
[1:32:39] think it is or not. And if God says a
[1:32:42] word, you've got to settle it in your
[1:32:43] heart. That's the word of God. And I
[1:32:45] believe what he said, and that settles
[1:32:47] it.
[1:32:50] If God said something, just like a
[1:32:52] little child, a little child just says,
[1:32:55] "I accept it." They don't argue with it.
[1:32:57] Daddy said so.
[1:33:02] Daddy, you'll keep his word. Amen.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's right. There's
[1:33:09] only one way, and Christ is the way, and
[1:33:11] Christ is the word that lives in you.
[1:33:14] Now, I'm I'm Let me just read this.
[1:33:19] There was a question. I brought this
[1:33:21] before, but I feel to read it again
[1:33:22] tonight. There's a question that's been
[1:33:25] comp that was given. And he said, "I
[1:33:26] can't give over completely to Jesus."
[1:33:30] Let me spend the rest of the time on
[1:33:32] that there. You can't surrender Jesus.
[1:33:34] Why? He said they he said, "Why not?" He
[1:33:38] said, "Why can't you surrender? Why?
[1:33:40] What's the matter? If you're a woman,
[1:33:42] don't you have to surrender to your
[1:33:44] husband to be a wife? Surrender all you
[1:33:46] are? A little lady when you married,
[1:33:49] virtuous, fought all your lives to stay
[1:33:51] virtuous, to stay a virgin. But one day
[1:33:55] you found a man that you loved. You were
[1:33:58] his completely. The things that he that
[1:34:01] you fought for all your life and tried
[1:34:03] to live clean and clear and virtuous.
[1:34:05] Now you surrender every bit of that to
[1:34:07] one man. Is that right? You put yourself
[1:34:11] completely in his hands. You are his.
[1:34:13] All you have stood for in decency and
[1:34:16] moral and everything like that. Now you
[1:34:19] turn over to a man because you surrender
[1:34:21] yourself to the man. Can't you do the
[1:34:24] same thing to Jesus Christ?
[1:34:27] Just surrender yourself that way. All
[1:34:30] that I am, all my mind, all my thoughts.
[1:34:34] Certainly. And the reason I know you can
[1:34:38] because there's something out there
[1:34:39] calling for you to surrender. And it's
[1:34:41] the devil standing in your way. Amen.
[1:34:44] You see? All right.
[1:34:48] The only thing you have to do to beat
[1:34:50] the devil is rely on Christ and humble
[1:34:52] yourself and let him lead you. There's
[1:34:56] no other way. Your intellectual powers
[1:34:58] will never do it. Just rely on him.
[1:35:03] Amen. Amen.
[1:35:07] Praise the Lord. That's right. Remember,
[1:35:10] there's You say, "Well, you don't know
[1:35:11] what I'm going through." Forget what
[1:35:13] you're going through. Put it in God's
[1:35:14] hands. Just put it in his hands. Let go
[1:35:17] of it. He's already with you. He allowed
[1:35:19] it. He You couldn't have gone through
[1:35:21] what you're going through unless he
[1:35:22] allowed it to you. Nothing happens by
[1:35:24] chance.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; That settles it. It doesn't have to take
[1:35:28] you to figure it out. You just believe
[1:35:30] what he said. He gave you the way out of
[1:35:32] it. You're being tested, but he made the
[1:35:34] way out.
[1:35:35] So, believe him.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; All right. Now
[1:35:43] just simply
[1:35:45] simply do this
[1:35:49] just lay your life in his hands and say
[1:35:51] here am I Lord
[1:35:57] just lay your veil take take take when a
[1:36:00] when a woman is committed when a bride's
[1:36:02] committed to the groom in the east this
[1:36:05] was this is how the marriage took place
[1:36:07] she takes takes off her veil, places it
[1:36:10] over the man's the groom's shoulders,
[1:36:12] signifying not only is she under his
[1:36:15] dominion, but that she has transferred
[1:36:18] her rights to him, that he is the head.
[1:36:22] Now, brother, sister, you that are born
[1:36:25] again, you're married to him. Where have
[1:36:28] you laid your veil? Where is it laying
[1:36:31] right now?
[1:36:33] Amen. What we lay it on his shoulders.
[1:36:37] Lay it on Jesus Christ's shoulders. Let
[1:36:39] him have it. Put it in his hands. And
[1:36:42] you go on happy, rejoicing, and God will
[1:36:45] take care of everything you have need of
[1:36:46] in it. Promised it. Amen. That's it. You
[1:36:51] just lay that veil.
[1:36:54] You You just let him take care of it.
[1:36:56] He's responsible for you. And when you
[1:36:58] lay that veil on his shoulders and
[1:37:00] submit yourself to him, the Bible, the
[1:37:02] scriptures say, and he said you he he
[1:37:06] the Lord has accepted that obligation to
[1:37:09] care for you. Then he's in you're in his
[1:37:11] hands.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; You cast your care upon him. He He cares
[1:37:16] for you. Amen. Let's stand together. God
[1:37:19] bless you.
[1:37:24] God wants surrender. How can God show
[1:37:27] you realities before you surrender
[1:37:29] yourself to him? You've got to
[1:37:31] surrender. Make a complete surrender. We
[1:37:34] cannot use one ability.
[1:37:37] Amen. Now, stop and think about that.
[1:37:41] You say, "Well, well, God, he gave me
[1:37:43] ability. Then give the ability to him
[1:37:44] and let him use it." But don't you try
[1:37:46] to use it to provide for yourself. You
[1:37:49] let God take care of that. God doesn't
[1:37:51] need your ability, human ability. God's
[1:37:54] already given you the ability to believe
[1:37:56] him. Amen. You can't get You can't go
[1:37:59] home on your own. You're not going to
[1:38:01] make it. You say, "If I do enough good
[1:38:04] works, I'll make it." No, you won't. The
[1:38:07] world's full of good works, good people.
[1:38:10] That'll be lost. They won't make it.
[1:38:12] Good works won't save you.
[1:38:15] I believe in good works, but get the
[1:38:18] Holy Spirit in you first, then the works
[1:38:20] will follow.
[1:38:22] You believe the word and the works will
[1:38:25] follow that you're a believer. Let's not
[1:38:27] be hearers only, brother, sister. Let's
[1:38:30] be doers of the word. When the word says
[1:38:32] something, let's act on it.
[1:38:35] Amen. Just act on it. The problem is
[1:38:38] that we're not willing to act on it.
[1:38:40] Then will I say, do you believe it? Then
[1:38:43] why not act on it?
[1:38:47] Because you're fearful that it won't
[1:38:49] work.
[1:38:51] That's why you're fearful God won't keep
[1:38:54] his word is the reason we don't act on
[1:38:57] what he said.
[1:39:01] Amen. When he said something, you
[1:39:03] believe it. How do we act on it? Simply
[1:39:05] this. It's simple as this. You take it
[1:39:07] and believe it and let nothing else come
[1:39:09] between you and that word. That's acting
[1:39:12] on it.
[1:39:14] If it requires a movement, if if Peter
[1:39:17] remember I mean Moses, he said, "Why cry
[1:39:20] to me Moses? Speak and go forward."
[1:39:22] What' they have to do? Go forward.
[1:39:26] Amen. He told them to go forward. They
[1:39:28] started marching through to a to a
[1:39:33] the sea, not knowing how they get
[1:39:36] across. But Moses already spoke it. This
[1:39:39] enemy you see today, you'll see no more.
[1:39:41] God had to provide a way.
[1:39:44] They started marching toward that sea
[1:39:47] and the sea opened up because they were
[1:39:50] willing to act upon. Moses acted upon
[1:39:52] what he spoke and believed it.
[1:39:56] Believe you receive what you asked for
[1:39:58] before you feel anything. Believe he
[1:40:00] gave it to you. Say, "Well, I don't see
[1:40:03] anything." Well, that's not faith. Faith
[1:40:05] believes you have what you don't see.
[1:40:10] But believe you will see because you've
[1:40:13] already received what he promised.
[1:40:17] Now you can chew on that for the rest of
[1:40:18] the week. Amen. Amen. I love him. Amen.
[1:40:23] That's This is rich. What a beautiful
[1:40:25] thing is to lay our life in his hands
[1:40:27] and say, "Here am I, Lord." How many's
[1:40:29] willing to do that tonight? Here am I,
[1:40:32] Lord. I have both my Here am I, Lord.
[1:40:36] Just use me.
[1:40:38] How many want wants him to use you? Just
[1:40:43] he cares. Do you? There's people lost.
[1:40:46] Do we care about that?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Are we here as a witness of his life? We
[1:40:51] carry the light that does that scatters
[1:40:55] the darkness. Satan hates light, but we
[1:40:58] are the light because we are his life
[1:41:01] made manifest. We are his light. Amen.
[1:41:06] Here
[1:41:07] am I, Lord. Just use me, lead me, guide
[1:41:10] me, and direct me in the way that would
[1:41:13] be pleasing unto me, Lord. No, it didn't
[1:41:16] say that. He said pleasing unto thee.
[1:41:21] And then don't murmur because as soon as
[1:41:25] you murmur, it's coming from another
[1:41:27] source because there because there's no
[1:41:30] murmuring in God. If he said something,
[1:41:32] you don't murmur. There's no murmur
[1:41:34] about that. It brings joy. He's got to
[1:41:37] keep his word.
[1:41:39] Do we believe him that way?
[1:41:43] Then don't murmur. No matter what the
[1:41:45] path is, stay with it anyhow. And God
[1:41:48] will work it right.
[1:41:51] Just stay with it anyhow. God will work
[1:41:54] it right. The footsteps, the Bible said,
[1:41:56] the footsteps of the righteous is
[1:41:59] ordered of the Lord. Amen.
[1:42:04] That's right. The steps of a good man is
[1:42:06] ordered of the Lord. Do we believe that?
[1:42:10] Amen. All right. Then there's no more
[1:42:13] nothing to complain about.
[1:42:17] Amen. Nothing. You say, "I didn't like
[1:42:19] that guy that come over there and didn't
[1:42:20] get off his phone soon enough and I
[1:42:22] didn't make that light."
[1:42:26] And we want to do what? Chew him up one
[1:42:29] side and down the other. I could give
[1:42:30] him a No. No, God allowed him to stop
[1:42:33] right there in front of you. There was a
[1:42:36] purpose for that. We don't understand
[1:42:39] how this how the shepherd leads. You
[1:42:41] don't have to understand. You trust him.
[1:42:46] Amen. Do you believe he's leading you
[1:42:48] perfectly? All right. Then every little
[1:42:50] thing that happens that way, there's no
[1:42:52] reason to murmur or complain about it.
[1:42:53] No way. I might give him a honk,
[1:42:57] wake him up,
[1:43:00] but I had to miss that light. I could
[1:43:02] have made it through if he hadn't
[1:43:05] delayed so much.
[1:43:07] See, watch the carnal man raise up.
[1:43:10] But God ordered your steps. Now, who's
[1:43:13] right?
[1:43:16] That's just a little thing, but that's
[1:43:18] exactly the truth.
[1:43:21] That's how easy it is to get over on the
[1:43:22] carnal side. I say, God, let us become
[1:43:25] so aware of what we're saying and doing
[1:43:29] that it pleases you. And when I don't
[1:43:32] think it ought to happen the way he
[1:43:33] plans it to happen and makes it to
[1:43:35] happen because I've given myself to him,
[1:43:37] you've got to have trust that he's doing
[1:43:39] exactly what he said. He has complete
[1:43:42] control.
[1:43:45] Amen. If you don't, then what are you
[1:43:48] raising up in front of him?
[1:43:51] another way, another something. See,
[1:43:53] another feeling, a sense,
[1:43:59] you just stay with the word. God will
[1:44:01] take care of all of it.
[1:44:04] Your steps are ordered and that
[1:44:06] scripture is true.
[1:44:09] Amen. I'd like to sing
[1:44:13] a song or two here.
[1:44:17] Listen, there's the only right you have,
[1:44:20] I'm going to tell the believers here
[1:44:21] tonight, the only right you have is a
[1:44:24] surrendered selfwill to God.
[1:44:30] And then God does the leading from then
[1:44:31] on. The only the only way to be led by
[1:44:34] the spirit of God is keep gentle and not
[1:44:37] know a whole lot.
[1:44:40] Amen. Just trust him. Trust him.
[1:44:45] Let's sing that song. I didn't plan to
[1:44:47] sing it, but it just come my mind just
[1:44:49] now. Trust and obey, for there is no
[1:44:53] other way but to trust and obey. The
[1:44:58] Bible said if you love him, you can say
[1:45:01] all you want you love him. But if you
[1:45:02] love him, you'll keep his commandment
[1:45:06] because love is trust. Amen.
[1:45:10] Okay.
[1:45:14] tr I can't and o that's got to drop it
[1:45:18] down a little bit
[1:45:22] trust and oy
[1:45:26] for there's no other way
[1:45:32] to be happy
[1:45:34] in Jesus
[1:45:38] but to trust and oy day
[1:45:43] when we walk with the Lord
[1:45:47] in the light of his word.
[1:45:52] What a glory
[1:45:55] he sheds on our way.
[1:46:01] While we do his good will,
[1:46:06] he abides with us still
[1:46:10] and with all who will trust and oy.
[1:46:18] So trust and oy
[1:46:22] for there's no other way to be happy in
[1:46:30] Jesus
[1:46:32] but to trust and oy
[1:46:38] shadow can rise.
[1:46:42] Not a cloud in the skies,
[1:46:46] but his smile quickly
[1:46:49] drives it away.
[1:46:55] Not a fear or a fear.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Now, excuse me.
[1:47:06] Will we trust and oy?
[1:47:12] Trust and oy
[1:47:15] for there's no other way to be happy in
[1:47:23] Jesus
[1:47:25] but to trust and oy.
[1:47:30] Let's just sing another song here and
[1:47:32] before we're dismissed
[1:47:38] that that one I mentioned, God, he will
[1:47:40] make a way. God will make a way. You
[1:47:42] believe God will make a way.
[1:47:47] God will make a way when there is no
[1:47:49] way.
[1:47:51] Amen. I can testify of that all through
[1:47:53] life. He's made ways where there's no
[1:47:55] way. I've seen him do wonders and
[1:47:58] miracles. I've seen him raise the dead.
[1:48:00] I've seen him chase storms and change
[1:48:02] storms and move storms completely out of
[1:48:05] the way just by a word. Seen animals
[1:48:08] healed here. Recently, I just prayed for
[1:48:09] a dead a dead um hummingbird and it come
[1:48:15] back to life.
[1:48:18] Prayed for a little bird that hit the
[1:48:19] window and knocked. I don't know if he
[1:48:21] died, but he was laying there on the on
[1:48:23] the porch and Ruth and I prayed for him
[1:48:25] and he perked right up and set him down
[1:48:28] on the feeder and he left.
[1:48:33] Seen a crow that was dying. Now,
[1:48:35] brother, sister, that's nothing. I had
[1:48:36] nothing to do with that. I'm giving this
[1:48:39] as a testimony of his presence.
[1:48:42] He knows. He hears. He knows exactly
[1:48:45] what you're thinking right now.
[1:48:48] He knows what's come through your mind.
[1:48:50] You don't have to say a word. He knows
[1:48:51] it. Every little thought, every little
[1:48:53] move, he knows it. You can't hide from
[1:48:55] him. The Bible said the word of God is a
[1:48:58] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:49:00] the heart.
[1:49:02] As I said, this is for his glory.
[1:49:05] There's none good. There's not a man,
[1:49:06] not a man living that's good. I'm I'm
[1:49:09] not good. There's nothing good in me.
[1:49:11] Don't look to man. Look to him. Let him
[1:49:14] be living in you. Let him guide.
[1:49:18] Those things weren't done just to brag
[1:49:20] about. I'm not bragging. I'm telling you
[1:49:22] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:49:24] forever. All he asked is for faith. I
[1:49:26] never We never prayed for them, but it
[1:49:29] was in it was inspired to pray for them.
[1:49:32] That wasn't me. That was him.
[1:49:35] Nobody can raise up. Nobody can create
[1:49:37] but God.
[1:49:39] No man has that ability. There's nothing
[1:49:41] good in a man.
[1:49:45] It's not the holy man. It's the holy God
[1:49:48] in the man.
[1:49:50] Not a holy mountain. It was the holy God
[1:49:52] in the mountain.
[1:49:55] Who could raise dead but God himself? He
[1:49:58] raised up his own son.
[1:50:02] He God himself said through Jesus
[1:50:04] Christ, I have power to lay my life down
[1:50:06] and I have power to raise it up.
[1:50:10] Well, brother, sister, he's the same.
[1:50:13] Amen. Amen. Let's sing this song. God
[1:50:18] will make a way.
[1:50:22] Oh, where there seems to be no way.
[1:50:28] He works in ways we cannot see.
[1:50:35] He will make a way for me.
[1:50:40] He will be my guide.
[1:50:45] Hold me closely to his side
[1:50:51] with love and strength for each new day.
[1:50:57] He will make a way.
[1:51:03] God will make a way. One more time.
[1:51:07] Listen these words now. God will make.
[1:51:10] He's not a respector of persons.
[1:51:13] He'll make your way. He'll lead you.
[1:51:16] He'll guide you.
[1:51:19] He works in ways we cannot see.
[1:51:26] He will make a way for you. He will be
[1:51:33] my guide. Who else would you want your
[1:51:35] guide? Hold me close. He can't fail. His
[1:51:39] ways are perfect.
[1:51:42] With love and strength for each new day,
[1:51:48] he will make a way.
[1:51:53] God will make a way. God bless you. Be
[1:51:58] with you. Expect to receive the word on
[1:52:01] Sunday. Come back rejoicing. Come back
[1:52:04] expecting. God bless you.
[1:52:22] Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:33] Amen.
[1:52:41] Yeah.
[1:53:13] Lord Jesus God.
[1:53:26] I say, "Lord, why do I
[1:53:30] why do I?" Because there's an outer man
[1:53:33] there. But I'm thankful that it's sealed
[1:53:37] that I am a true believer. I'm thankful
[1:53:40] for that, Lord.
