good trip um thank you musicians had a good trip and uh just bring greetings back from Church there in Anchorage and on our most Tabernacle out there in chivac um God seemed to to deal with everybody's heart last week and um you know we we fought some some Spirits the first couple of nights but really went to prayer and God broke through on the third night so I know that God never lets his word return to him void and the devil will try to tell you and convince you that somewhere you've gone off but we don't put our faith in our feelings we put our faith in what God has given us in his word and showed us showed us to do you know that think of that story of a deacon man in uh Siberia there was a during the Communist Regime in Russia there was this pastor who got arrested and sent off to prison they took his family and sent them to the middle of nowhere Siberia to basically die and um they had eaten their last meal and went to bed the mom and the kids went to bed and it was a blizzard out and pretty much without intervention they're going to wake up either they're gonna wake up or they're not gonna wake up it was a life for death and 30 something 60 miles away and then no cars blizzard um God spoke to the heart of this Deacon and told them middle of the night get up hook your horse to your sled load it full of food and go to this house and he's like that's crazy if I do that I'm gonna die and and uh you know the Wolves will attack me and eat my horse and eat me and and everything and it's a blizzard out and everything and God spoke to his heart again and he said it didn't say you had to come back I just said you had to go and sometimes and he went and he came back and he he came back alive he came back fine but what uh I read that I thought what an invaluable lesson as believers we don't always know the rest of the story we don't know the the the the next five steps but we know the next step we know who holds the next few moments of our life and and getting to that place where we just rest in the hands of God I mean what what a what a powerful place it would be to to go through life and not fear I think I think we have to have a good perfect body but there's been individuals through history who have who have who have testified of living in a place so close to God that it's faith and nothing else fear is just darkness fear is not its substance faith is a substance and faith is light and we can take a hold of that take a hold of the word of God says it starts in the mind that's where it starts but it moves down when you accept it it moves down into your heart now it's now it's doing the changing in your life but getting to that place it takes absolute faith absolute faith in the word that God has given you to accept that for it to move from a thought from an intellectual idea down into something inside your heart amen so next time you don't know how you're going to get back remember he just said go hey man you want to stand up tonight with me and turn into your Bibles to Galatians chapter one Galatians chapter one verse 1. Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead and all the Brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia Grace be to you and peace from the god from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our father to whom be glory forever and ever amen I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that you have received let him be accursed for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ it's powerheads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we pray that you would come and speak to our hearts tonight Lord we we want to hear from you Lord we don't want to hear my thoughts we don't want to hear my opinions Laurie we pray that you would just settle your atmosphere down here Lord Jesus in this place Lord you've given us a promise in your word that you would be we're two or three are gathered in your name or asking you to come down tonight Lord Jesus and just settle in and speak to us we ask Lord let me pull up our feet under the table of the of of the of the kingdom of God and the bread of life would be served tonight Lord that we would partake of your word that you could speak to us we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you can be seated tonight this scripture here Paul's speaking and he he's speaking to the Galatians and he's marveling because he says you I I'm amazed that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ so something happened something happened with the Galatians something came along and and you know something moved them you see there the the value that we hold in our position in Christ or the position that we hold in Christ is invaluable and sometimes the Devil Hill he'll come along well he was always coming along everywhere you go he's coming along he's tagging along and he'll use things he'll use things in your life to to lay a hook in your flesh and it's our jobs when we we see the hook to to pluck it off I know that's an interesting example but so it comes to my mind the devil throws his his hook and he tries to to hook something so anything can happen I mean we we are we're humans and anything can happen somebody can say something or somebody cannot say something or we just get burdened down with life and every day we have to get up and we have to pretty much do the same thing we did yesterday and you know if we're not careful we we forget we forget what started us off in the first place maybe maybe you forgot why you took that job in the first place maybe you forgot why you you were led to this church in the first place because the devil loves the number one thing that the world deals with today is depression that's a big deal and I'm in traveling around in different places the last just the last little bit I've come into contact with that spirit in in ministering and at first I didn't I didn't know what it was I I couldn't figure out what was going on I just felt just got out the pulpit to preach and I started falling asleep just and it was and this is just a weird way of putting it but I was I couldn't I couldn't hold a train a thought I couldn't I couldn't keep continuity with what I was saying and I was just praying like Lord what's what's going on and sometime later I I found out that there were some individuals battling suicide in the in the building and I and I hit that again in another place for a couple of different services and because what happens is is we can't we can't explain the gospel to you we can't explain the message to you I can't I can't take a quote and and and dissect it and pull sentence here in a sentence here and make it and and explain it to you I can't I can't read you a scripture and try to explain it to you and and when you serve God and you look for an explanation you will find many times you will find discouragement you're not looking for Revelation you're not looking for Christ you're looking for an explanation you're looking for the answer to the question why and when you when you start getting into this position where in your mind you're looking at a situation you're looking at your church you're looking at what's going on around you and you start saying why is this person doing this why is this person not doing this why am I doing this if you focus on that and you look for an explanation instead of strength instead of Revelation instead of the leading of the Holy Spirit you come from it from a man's point of view and you look for an explanation you will find discouragement because what you're doing is you're you're looking outside of Christ you're looking for a way to to make sense it's like people try to make sense of the world look the world doesn't make sense we're not we're not here to figure out why the world is the way it is when I figure out why the the the politics are the way they are why all this stuff is happening if you try to figure out why or how Biden got elected or or anything on the extreme side of things or figure out why you know is it that that I I want to get a job and I have to have a vaccine or why why all this stuff you will find yourself it discouraged because your focus is removed from the word of God but when your focus is on is on the word and you're saying and you say and instead of looking at something and saying okay well maybe this is the reason why or maybe this is the reason why or this or that and instead you say you ask God to show you what he's doing you find strength the scripture says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and when we push ahead and we push ahead on our own abilities our own thoughts our own opinions our own explanations of things you know the word says casting down vain imaginations you want to there's many things that can be evade imaginations but you know one vain imagination having an argument with somebody in your head because you are putting words in their mouth or having a discussion with somebody in your head and you walk away self-satisfied that you convince them and you've never said a word to them you've convinced yourself that this is how they think this is how they view the the situation I mean marriage it happens all the time right you have two imperfect people coming together to become one because it only happens with the word as our guide so when our when our Focus so what happened in galatia is they got caught up in in everything else there I mean you you talk about drama there was drama at this point in history you had the Jews saying you got to be circumcised the Gentiles saying you don't and then the Gentiles bringing in their traditions and their culture clashing it with the Jews culture he had the Jews holding onto their culture Gentiles holding on to their culture churches starting up Paul would be there for a Time start the church get somebody in place he'd go off to the next place and that church would then I mean just a lot of things were going on but if you've taken you and you go look through the scriptures and you look through uh the book of kings and you look at at the camp of Israel Israel is a type of the church so the kings are pastors Ministries whatever look at the mess the mess that the Israel was in now you can say oh yes well you know they were they didn't have the Holy Ghost they have conversion and everything um the same message are happening all around us and our churches we got people sleeping with people we got problems that and it's all under the umbrella of the message church so if we're not careful we focus on that or even in our own church you know we see hey that person's not doing like they should be doing you focus on them and you try to say look they got a problem and all this stuff instead of praying for them instead of instead of asking the Lord to lead you in conversation with them you get discouraged you get depressed and we are called to have Liberty Freedom the the we're supposed to preach what this in spirit and in truth preaching the word of God sharing the word of God fellowshipping it should be Liberty and freedom who cares how many people come to church on Wednesday night you came God only needs one person the preacher no no he doesn't need a whole crowd and but where we see people go off the rails is they start to focus on that kind of stuff it's able to pews they're still lime green their views and they're comfortable so don't fall asleep who cares you get focused on they'll say well you know I wish he you know the pastor would do this and he doesn't do this and why doesn't he do this and I wish he either pray through or find a different Church you see people get focused it gets all politics like I I was just traveling in a section of the world I won't say where you talk about the politics for years embedded you can feel it when you preach to them it's embedded in their conscience and how they view things and and that's you know what that is that's a religious spirit yeah because Church became a religious Act not a relationship you see we're not called to take up a church doctrine we're not called up to take the message culture we're called to take the doctrine of Christ and the culture of Christ the culture of Christ loves a brother whether they agree or not loves now I didn't say gives their money to I didn't say goes to their church I said love them you can like our Pastor said before just stuck with me he could vehemently disagree with somebody and still love them if you go turn with me to First Corinthians chapter 13. they uh I kind of had this focus on faith lately and I was in in brother uh I think brother Sam's house the Samus is the Ruth I was in the restroom and they had this thing on the wall and it was that scripture in Corinthians about Above All Else um says and now First Corinthians 13 verse 13. and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is love and I and I I read that and it just it hit me because I've been studying faith and you look at Faith is a revelation and it takes Revelation to see God it takes Revelation to know Christ in your day to know the present God I am it takes Faith revelation yet greater than that is love and I thought Lord I don't know I I still don't claim to have it figured out how that works because brother bear says the greatest force in the world is love and maybe I'm misquoting that so you go double check that but it's not love as in as in filio like common person to person or you you love your dog or you you love your cat or you you know you love tacos it's it's a love that that you have to have in order to you have faith and you have hope and and these three of these three abide together but the greatest of these is love Christ is the perfect representation of love so for us to get Christ and here's how it works for us to get Christ we have to have faith and revelation and then we get Christ now once we have Christ and we cultivate that relationship from within us comes this called brotherly love it's a love that you have for the for the children of God brother says the mature bride when see they see somebody not doing well or or or or they disagree with that's not you know living out to the scriptures that the bride a mature bride will love them and pray for them right you see you can you can have a there's people who don't leave don't believe the message anymore who have a revelation of serpent seed but they missed Christ because vultures food do you know what vultures food is Eagle food gone bad that fish that was fresh one time and the eagle was eating it and then he moved on to new fish and that fish rotted and now the vultures eating it you see we can't you know we say well we can't preach Noah's message today and we laugh because that's so obvious but you can't live on your faith from last you need food today I can't live on that steak I ate Friday night I gotta have food Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday today what happens is you get you get focused and you forget the point the point is Christ the point is isn't how well you can know the scriptures how you well you can know the message or how well you know conduct order and Doctrine and how a church should be run if you if you if you focus on that aspect of of things you you disconnect okay it's like it's hard to I'll say this just very tongue-in-cheek okay it's hard to forgive somebody you don't know they're strangers whatever get on you know you'll never see them again that jerk and you belong with your life but if that's somebody you love that you have to see all of the time you want to fix that you want to make that right because you love them see that said tongue-in-cheek terrible example because the point across someone you have invested a relationship with when something goes awry you're quick there to fix it you're quick to to patch it up and to make it right but if you if it's all become laws and rules you disconnect brother man lost the feeling of the people remember because he got discouraged he he was preaching against the sin and he was preaching against all this and maybe I have the story a little bit off but it brings the same point and he lost his connection with the people he lost his love for the people he didn't lose his revelation he didn't lose his faith he lost his love and he had to go take a break and then God came and showed him and everything and so on and go read the story so you don't take my facts for my opinion my words for facts because I don't have it right here and I haven't read it in a minute but he lost the love of the people When you pray for somebody the best thing you can do is get yourself in their shoes because you feel for them and when you pray for somebody who who's gone going through something that you've gone through there's a there's a there's a touch point there that you can't get any other way you know having been healed of food allergies when somebody has that prayer has that desire I I can connect with them there's a love for for them I want to see them receive the same thing just like when you receive Christ and you see people who don't have Christ if you have been serving God and it usually we say over time because it doesn't happen right away over time and you start to apply it and it's just well I go to church Wednesday and I go to church Sunday and I read this book and I read this scriptures and I and I read these chapters and I go through this and and it's just a bunch of emotions and it's just a religious act you disconnect from the love and it is the love that holds the power you understand the scriptures but you stopped progressing because revelation is the most powerful is I'm contradicting myself I should have had this quote Revelation is more important to us than we realize that's what it was so we need Revelation but you need love too you gotta have all three love separated from that you'll find yourself you lose you lose relationship see Faith Revelation puts you in that position provokes you to that position where you have a relationship with Christ but you have to keep going on you can't stop you can't live on that of the past so Galatians they they they they found the disconnect and let's go back now and we're in First Corinthians 13 let's start with the verse first verse it says though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol see if I just would have read this we wouldn't have had all that confusion I am become as the sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not love I am nothing you see you see there's been people that I know who don't serve the Lord anymore who had faith and the miraculous in their life but they were missing a key in element verse 3 and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing so you can have the faith to give your body give yourself over in death and and not have not charity and you're it's no good charity suffereth long and is kind envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil boy we we all we we're all just fell off there we just you know a couple of verses in on charity and we're all praying for grace Rejoice not rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth Bears all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish vanish away for we know see bear verse 7 beareth all things he you want to push back against against discouragement love but what is love what that's Christ right brotherly loves at the top of the pyramid it's Christ your relationship with Christ it dries up it's hard to Bear all things it's hard to endure all things it's hard to not get complacent it's hard to to not see the faults in everybody around you you meet people and and and and uh well I don't want to go that direction for he says for we know in part verse 9 and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child that when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abided faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity in the revelation of Jesus Christ a search age book he says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her now it says she will be an invincible Army she gets a true revelation of the true church and if the church if the bride gets the true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework okay so the brag is revelation of the two spirits and by God's spirit discern now watch it's not just that you identify them it's that through the spirit of Christ which comes through a relationship you get power in your life through a relationship with Jesus Christ which is love Christ that's the Pinnacle and you have this connection with God now that I'm not saying love is the Holy Spirit somebody felt was thinking that but it's that you have a connection with god with Christ God's spirit so now through God's spirit you discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit then Satan list is powerless before you so you can't just identify them you can't just discern them you have to also withstand them we will never have the power of Christ when we're Anointed with the power of religion it's not about it's just accepting it because we preach it here you gotta you got to know the word of God it's not about that that you come and you serve in the house of God you've got to have a relationship with God and if you serve if you serve apart from relationship you get bitter you get discouraged you get depressed boy I I don't even know who this is for this is just for me as a man a shot in the dark but I have to just trust the Lord you see so it's withstanding what is that what is that oh that's false Doctrine no no that's bitterness Pride arrogancy discontentment those are all anti-christ too often we read that and we think big and and the pope and you know the uh it's a but the Venom is God and all these things well yes that is Antichrist but so is a bad attitude that's the spirit of the devil right and we are called as the people of God to pursue perfection we're never going to be perfect in this body but don't use it as an excuse we are required to pursue perfection pursue and what is that that's a promise be a perfect even as I am perfect that's what those are Christ's words that's a promise and if we push towards that we take in faith gives us revelation of Christ Christ gives us the love that we need to endure all things to Bear all things to to Rejoice not an iniquity to rejoice in the truth to never fail to hope for all things to think no evil to not be easily provoked to not seek our own agenda or our own position to to not behave unseemly it gives us the ability to suffer long to be kind to not be envious of another brother's position in church or or envious of another brother's job or or another brother's stuff or another sister's skirt that we we that's what gives us that strength we walk this path and we get to that position now we can stand discern and withstand you can't Skip One you can't do it without you can't do it backwards you can't Skip One you gotta you gotta go the way God ordained it can't jump over the fence you got to come through the gate who who is the door to the gate well it's Christ how do you get to Christ well you gotta total surrender look total surrender comes from complete faith complete faith comes from total trust you gotta trust God all the way then you have faith see it's why God does stuff in your life to show you look you can trust me that's why he has testimonies in the word of God proves his word of God for that says God proves his word so he proves his words he shows you over and over and over again you can trust me you can trust me he comes in your life and he does things and he he changes you and he shows you how he changes you so you can trust him when you have trust you have faith in him and you begin to see God if God can keep his word here then what he's telling me is truth now Revelation begins to work in your life and with that comes a personal relationship as you receive Christ for yourself you meet somebody who's given themselves to God who really has the Holy Spirit there's a sweetness about their spirit that's love that's true love when you really love your children you discipline them God's love he really loves us he takes us sometimes and he he puts us on the backside of the desert or he takes a few things from us or he makes a few things harder than normal sometimes to show us we're not as holy as we thought we were but I want I want in my life Satan to be powerless yeah yeah I want it in in our church Satan to be powerless the devil loves to sneak in and hide in the secrets hide in the the word shared or the text shared here that no one else sees he loves that he loves a a tongue that'll just go loose and gossip all over the place see Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them and this day the scripture is fulfilled he he gives us this quote he says so the church really is in birth pains tonight again for the Deliverance of the son son of God to come again all of our theologians all of our systems all of our denominations has rotted right out from under us so we are in birth pains and a message from God always throws the church in heavier pains a message from God always throws the church in heavier pains but after a while she's going to be delivered of a bride that'll bring forth Jesus Christ to his bride and then thinking this man had disagreed with me so much when I raise up to speak this message I turn in my Bible he's sharing a story now okay I'll leave that part of the quote out just want to make the first part so we are in birth pains and the message from God always throws the church in heavier pains you see God now now you can take that that's that's the church right God starts to stir things up world over for the message Church you start seeing this and that and we're getting closer to the end as he's separating the the weed and the the weeds and the wheat and it's birth pains because God's birthing a bride from the church who's birthing Christ The Life of Christ will you bring that on down home to your own church says God God brings a word or God says something maybe it's in a service or maybe God speaks to the pastor and leads him in a certain direction it's it's it's it's a message from God now I'm not talking about just here and here I'm talking about something that's definitive everyone says wow this is happening it's birth pains and when we can when we if we get caught up if we get caught up in in trying to explain well well maybe he's making this decision because of this or maybe this person's doing this to be whatever you put you just put it in there and instead and don't focus on the fact that okay God this is happening because God you set this church up god Set us all here God put us here God brought me from Alaska to Arizona to Idaho you know Sasha and sister Julia from Washington Ukraine Washington back to Ukraine North Carolina Ohio here you see you see oh God let us here and then things get a little tricky things get a little uncomfortable or immediately start to doubt did God really but in the good times they said oh yes God sent us here when the times get hard don't just think because the times are hard well I'm doing something wrong or I'm in the wrong position look when you're in position when you're in your position the devil is going to fight you tooth and nail because he wants to do what he did to the Galatians soon remove you to soon remove you from the Gospel of Truth so that you go you can go read the book of Galatians and I'm going to too because it's not fresh enough in my mind but pandemonium chaos confusion in the church now there's situations a lot different than ours they had things going on there but we're so that we get caught up here's what I'm trying to say we get caught up in it's a person it's that person we put it we say their name in our heads instead maybe God is using them to push you a little higher because they're not necessarily doing anything wrong you just don't agree disagreement is great if you have a counsel everybody always agrees you need to get a new Council you need people in there so I really appreciate with arriving because me and him we think a little different but we always come to conclusion based on the word based on the facts presented and I'll say this and he'll bring it over here and then I'll bring it over here and he'll bring it over here right but there's if there's a love there we don't argue we don't fight we're just having a conversation we're having Fellowship and that's just an example there's other other people in my life like that and so as a church if you just expect it all to be everybody okay everyone needs to agree on the pastor that's very important but I'm talking about directions now I'm not talking about people directions of the church or or different things happening I don't know what's happening I've been traveling I don't know what's going on if there's anything going on but obviously God has something to say so I'm listening and we get caught up in in in that in the humanity of the situation we're quick to see that person's making a mistake or because it because it's affecting you negatively you say that person is making a mistake but maybe your world view is no longer aligned with God's will maybe you like the Galatians you got off somewhere if you you've got discombobulated you got because you know you just everything's happy go lucky so God likes to come in and not fluff the feather pillow remove the feather pillow to get your attention because we can't get comfortable here we can't get comfy cozy we gotta we gotta be realizing we're in a battle and we gotta fight because if we let down our guard the devil's gonna slip right into the church so the church is in birth pains he says Church natural Church spiritual there is a church natural that these women here type and there's a church spiritual also so the natural church and the spiritual church cannot be heirs together they are they are two different separate times two different separate peoples under two different separate Covenants he says that's why the Rapture is different and will only be for the Royal Seed of Abraham it cannot be come by the natural carnal seed of the church so right there you will never produce Christ based off of church doctrine now the church doctrine can be accurate but if you just receive it as well the church says it so that's it and you conform you don't be transformed you're going to you're going to find yourself focused on Humanity focus on The Human Side of the positions God has given us in the body of Christ everybody has a position you're going to get focused on the human side of things you're going to get caught up in politics and you're going to find yourself living a religious life and you're children will suffer your spiritual life will suffer oh you can have it all figured out at church but outside of the church it's a mess because you're focused see it's not it's the carnal seed of the church won't bring it but the spiritual City says it cannot come it'll have to be the Royal seed of the word of God the Roy through Abraham the Royal seed that's why he says that's why the Rapture has to be first so the Rapture is our goal getting out of here is our goal so all we can do to to to push towards that goal to press towards that goal to shake off the you know what's the spirit of late to see a laziness oh I'm just too tired you're never going to stop being tired preaching to myself now you're never going to stop being tired because the devil loves to use that you're too tired to go to church you're too tired to say Amen you're too tired to listen you're you're oh well I just you know I've I've gone through Seasons where I thought I was getting sick a lot turns out I was just lazy anybody who's home sick forgive those words unless you're home for the wrong reasons God bless the pastor I'm leaving Friday but what happens is we get we just get lazy with life lazy in life we we need to be good stewards of what God's given us good sewage of our time and it takes hard work it takes hard work to get up in the morning when you need to see I said when you need to some of us don't have to get up at four in the morning but we have to get up at seven so whatever your life is all right some of us have to get up at 10. one guys the four o'clock guy says man I wish I was the 10 o'clock guy 10 o'clock guy says man I wish I was the one o'clock guy it's all in your your perspective on where you are in your life but it's getting up when you need to and that's just not very spiritual thing to say but it's the truth and and if we we get lazy in our Natural Life you'll see that start to manifest spiritually and you start to say well I read my Bible yesterday I'll live off of that he said well over my Bible two days ago I'll live off that or I listened to a tape last week I'll I'll be good I I I need to relax I'm going to put on a you know whatever something else and instead of getting to keeping yourself from this complacency because when you get to a point of complacency when you get to a point of of this where you just well you're just kind of going through the motions the point I'm trying to make tonight is when you get to that position that's when you get off and that's when you start missing more church or that's when you start getting caught up in the politics of church or or or your Viewpoint of the the offices in the church you start to find all the faults with everybody because you got off and you lost your love but staying close to God keeps you from we constantly have to it's like it's like you're you're driving a a car that needs to be aligned right so you got the you're driving like this and you're going straight right the devil's constantly pulling it's like you're driving through the wind right you drive down the freeway the wind's blowing perpendicular to the freeway it's blowing 60 miles an hour you drive like this because you're holding the car to the wind if you just put it straight like you normally do when there's no wind you'll go flying off the road but as soon as the devil starts to buff at you you have to turn into the wind it's like when the waves in the ocean come out of ship a ship has to turn into the waves and accelerate so run towards the storm to take the waves because if you turn you try to turn a run from the waves the wave will catch you sideways and just sink your ship but you turn head on and you face the waves you accelerate the power I'm talking about a storm a storm you're you're exhausted you're cold your hands are almost Frozen to the steering wheel every bone in your body hurts and you still have to ride the wave behind every wave is another wave is one more wave at the end of every wave there's just one more that's how you have to live it say God you're in control Lord You're my anchor because you throw the anchor Out The Anchor Holds you in position but you still have to ride the waves you still have to face the ways you know it's like brother Isaac I don't know if you remember he shared that that story and I'm closing keep it short tonight of the buff I think it's the buffalo when they see a storm start to roll over the mountains and come down to the plains where they are I mean could be nasty storm they all turn and they run at the storm to get to the other side of it where it's already passed when the storms come into the church run towards them you you don't you don't run towards him on your own feet you actually don't even move at all you just get on your knees and you pray and you pray God I need Faith because I gotta trust you I need faith in Revelation I need Clarity I need leadership of the Holy Spirit God I need you most of all because I need to have love for my brother he'd have love for my sister and a passion a passion to to get up and you know it's like if you you love your job you got a passion to get up someone doesn't have to beg you to work because you're you'll love it you're right there you know you love your wife you love your family nobody has to beg you to be a good father you're just you're there you're with them you're taking care of them you're invested in them same it is with the church here you say maybe you're questioning whatever you're questioning just pray say God if you want to move me move me if you want me to be here then may it be so real and personal to me and give me let me portray The Life of Christ to have love to find a passion to support a passion to press forward because not every time when we lose Steam not every time does that mean that God wants to turn us that could just mean the devil's blowing a little bit harder let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we thank you Father tonight I mean just jumbled up but Lord I pray that you would just take it and the little nuggets here and there and you would speak to the heart of your children tonight father we just we love you and at the end of the day at the end of everything our one desire or one focus is to see you glorified is to see you magnify so see you manifested in our lives and the lives of your people and Lord that that happens through a journey that's a process Lord there's no it doesn't happen overnight it's a it's a it's a constant daily surrender to you Lord so I just pray you give us a strength Lord the inspiration the focus that we need in these trying times that we live in Lord to prepare us father for the next wave we ask in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you know I I was I had um I don't know who to turn it over to but I had a whole sermon um and I had it prepared and in the the office did everyone started to come in started to worship um I just knew that wasn't what to preach so I walked into the pulpit not not even having a clue what to preach and just leaning on the Lord so if it was a bit jumbled back and forth you know why I was just trying to find God's will because um he's in control can we sing that song He's in control he's got it all in control foreign [Music] way down [Music] he's got it all all in control I put my life if it is [Music] life in his head s away every road I walk down I'm sure it is in his place I put my love in his head my father knows what I need my father knows I go through he knows what's best for me my father knows what I need I was thinking that was my name [Music] I have a maker he formed my heart and before even time began my life was in his hands He Knows My Name he knows my everything he sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call I have a father he calls me his own and he'll never believe me no matter where I go He Knows My Name he knows my every thought he sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call He Knows My Name He Knows My Name he knows my everything he said he sees each tear that falls [Music] foreign [Music] and I was on the verge of giving over the strength Within Myself just wasn't there but something keeps holding me every day I see helping me Faithfully to overcome My Tribe is guiding me constantly [Music] giving me victory quality something keeps holding me Satan laid before me his Temptations [Music] for Revelation the strength I need to keep me in his grace something keeps holding me thank you every day I see helping to overcome he's guiding me constantly [Music] something keeps old holding something keeps holding me every day I see me and giving me victory he's a reality something keeps on holding me God bless you your dismissed [Music] foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music]
