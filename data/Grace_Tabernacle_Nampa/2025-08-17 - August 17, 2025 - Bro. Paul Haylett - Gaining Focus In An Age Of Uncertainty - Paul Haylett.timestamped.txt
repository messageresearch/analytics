[2:41] Since we don't have any uh screen there,
[2:44] do you have do y'all have your Bibles?
[2:47] Let's turn to Psalms 19.
[2:50] Uh,
[2:52] God bless you this morning. This is not
[2:56] sung exactly as the psalmist wrote it,
[2:59] but it's pretty close.
[3:02] Uh, so it's Psalms 19 and it starts
[3:06] about
[3:10] you love the Lord this morning.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; I love the Lord. And
[3:16] we people ask me, well, what are your
[3:18] plans, Brother David? And I always tell
[3:20] him, my plan is to plan for the
[3:22] unexpected
[3:24] because that's what usually happens and
[3:26] that's why we're here this morning as we
[3:28] are. So, uh, it starts out there in 19
[3:32] about the, uh, seventh verse. If you
[3:36] have your Bibles there, let's see.
[3:43] That's might be too high. Let's try
[3:45] this. The law. That's gonna be too low.
[3:49] The law of the Lord is perfect,
[3:54] converting the soul.
[3:59] The testimony of the Lord is sure,
[4:05] making wise the simple.
[4:10] More to be desired are they than gold,
[4:15] yay, than much.
[4:17] Go.
[4:20] Sweeter also than the honey
[4:25] and the honeycomb.
[4:28] Y'all know this song.
[4:31] Okay, let's start at the first again.
[4:33] The law of the Lord is perfect,
[4:39] converting the soul.
[4:44] Testimony of the Lord is sure,
[4:49] making wise the simple.
[4:55] More to be desired
[4:58] are they than gold, yay, than much fine
[5:03] gold.
[5:06] Sweeter also than the honey.
[5:11] and the honeycomb.
[5:17] Statutes of the Lord are right,
[5:23] rejoicing the heart.
[5:28] The commandment of the Lord is pure,
[5:34] enlightening the eyes.
[5:39] more to be desired
[5:42] are they than gold than much fine gold.
[5:50] Sweeter also than the honey
[5:55] and the honey comb.
[6:01] The fear of the Lord is clean,
[6:06] enduring forever. Ever
[6:11] the judgments of the Lord are true,
[6:16] righteous allto together,
[6:21] more beired
[6:24] are they than gold, gay than much fine
[6:29] gold.
[6:32] Sweeter also than the honey
[6:37] and the honeycomb.
[6:42] More to be desired are they than gold.
[6:48] Then much fun gold
[6:51] [Music]
[6:53] sweet
[6:54] and
[6:58] the honeycomb.
[7:02] And some singing more over by them is
[7:06] thy servant warned. Is thy servant
[7:10] warned.
[7:13] And in keeping of them
[7:19] there is much reward.
[7:25] Praise the Lord. You're going to have to
[7:27] sing loud because I have all of this
[7:30] piano in front of me and I can't hear
[7:33] you.
[7:34] In fact, if y'all wanted to move up
[7:36] closer, that would be nice. This This
[7:39] morning is like informal service. This
[7:41] doesn't have to be church is what lives
[7:43] in our hearts. It's not what's
[7:45] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[7:46] &gt;&gt; here. So, you're here to enjoy the
[7:49] service.

[8:24] three verses. Blessed assurance.
[8:28] Is that going to be too high?

[8:33] this key? Blessed. Is that a better key?
[8:36] Yeah.

[8:41] Oh, what a foretaste

[14:37] Praise the Lord. I don't I don't know if
[14:39] there was any prayer requests. I don't
[14:41] see any up there. Was there any prayer
[14:43] requests from any anybody? This Let's
[14:45] just stand up. Are is everybody just st
[14:49] sitting around like what's happening
[14:52] here? What's happening here is this is
[14:54] an informal service. God bless you this
[14:56] morning. I love you. I'm glad you're
[14:57] here.
[15:00] This is not what we're used to doing,
[15:02] but God bless our pastor here, Brother
[15:05] Paul. Said, "Brother Dave, would you
[15:06] mind taking the song service? There's no
[15:09] one else to do it." So, here we are. Uh,
[15:12] any prayer requests, special prayer
[15:14] requests from anyone?
[15:18] Everybody's so quiet.
[15:21] There's one. God bless you, ma'am. What
[15:22] do you have? I pray for my children and
[15:24] grandchildren.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a bunch of hands right
[15:29] right here going up for us also for that
[15:33] one. I got one prayer request on the
[15:35] phone this morning. Uh a woman in San
[15:38] Francisco
[15:39] because of the tariff situation. Most of
[15:42] their uh
[15:44] business is from Asia. So they're having
[15:46] a lot of problems. And she had a meeting
[15:48] this morning said, "Please pray for our
[15:50] meeting with the Asian people." So, uh,
[15:54] financial needs, there's a lot of them
[15:57] now in these days that we're living.
[15:59] And, uh, my hands are up for those, too.
[16:02] I imagine I see some other hands. So,
[16:05] uh, any others? Yes, sister K
[16:09] brother Pashant and Sister Ka, little
[16:11] Isaac. They have a they have some very
[16:14] interesting new situations that the Lord
[16:18] just needs to come on this evening for
[16:19] them.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Okay. you just lift them up and getting
[16:23] all of this worked out.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Of course. Any others? I know there's
[16:29] more because I
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Gideon and sister Billy just got
[16:33] married yesterday. Just like to lift
[16:34] them up, too.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord. Others? Others?
[16:39] They're in the back. Anyone? Yes.
[16:42] Trevor, why don't you go ahead since you
[16:44] brought the last one, go ahead and bring
[16:46] these requests up for everyone.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; Up there or just right here?
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Wait, whatever you want, brother. This
[16:51] is informal. You just do.
[16:56] Are we even online?
[17:00] Well, God bless you saints.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; We'll take these needs to the Lord.
[17:07] Heavenly Father, thank you father for
[17:08] this time together.
[17:10] We ask Lord that even in this informal
[17:14] service, Lord Jesus,
[17:17] which I believe is just fine for the
[17:20] invitation for you, Lord, I first and
[17:24] foremost would like to invite you to be
[17:26] here, Lord. And we believe that you are
[17:28] here present in the souls, in the hearts
[17:30] of each believer, Father. And Father, I
[17:33] pray that you would just anoint our
[17:36] faith to believe. not just to believe in
[17:39] you, but believe you, Lord, to have you
[17:43] speak to each heart this morning.
[17:45] Father,
[17:46] we long to hear you tell us that you
[17:49] love us.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; And yet, we also know, Father, that uh
[17:52] if there's correction needed,
[17:54] &gt;&gt; we pray for that correction, Lord. We'd
[17:56] rather be corrected here and not be
[17:59] wanting at the river.
[18:03] Father, Lord, you heard each request for
[18:06] children and grandchildren and for
[18:09] Pashant and Akancha and little Isaac,
[18:11] Lord, and their situations there and
[18:14] Gideon and Lily and their new marriage,
[18:17] Father, and every other request on the
[18:20] hearts of the believer. Father, we just
[18:22] pray, we know that you know what it is,
[18:24] and we just ask, Father, that you would
[18:26] answer each one. And we believe that you
[18:28] will, Father, take control of this
[18:31] service, Lord. speak to our hearts
[18:33] through brother Paul.
[18:35] Bless the remainder of this worship
[18:37] service. Father, we love you. We ask
[18:40] these things in the precious name of
[18:42] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Um,
[18:46] we can turn to Psalms 51.
[18:51] Again, the songwriter was really close
[18:55] with these words, but not completely.
[18:58] So, bear with me. Uh and it would start
[19:02] about the 10th verse.
[19:05] Yes, please, brother. Thank you.
[19:09] Uh
[19:14] so Psalms 51:10,
[19:16] [Music]
[19:21] create in me a clean heart,
[19:26] oh God,
[19:30] and renew a right spirit within me.
[19:39] Create in me a clean heart,
[19:44] oh God,
[19:48] and renew a right spirit within me.

[21:35] and renew a right spirit within
[21:40] me
[21:43] on every eye closed. And I want you to
[21:47] sing it to him as though this is an
[21:49] empty building. Sing it to him with all
[21:52] your hearts as we get ready to turn this
[21:56] service to brother Paul. Create in me a
[22:00] clean heart,
[22:04] oh God,
[22:08] and renew a right spirit within me.
[22:16] Create me a clean heart,

[22:57] the joy of thy salvation
[23:03] and renew a right spirit within me.
[23:12] Oh, cast me not away from thy presence,
[23:19] oh Lord.
[23:22] Take not your Holy Spirit from me.
[23:28] Restore
[23:31] unto me
[23:33] the joy of thy salvation
[23:39] and renew a right spirit within me.
[23:49] Hallelujah.
[23:54] Hallelu.
[23:59] Hallelu.
[24:04] Hallelu.
[24:07] [Music]
[24:10] Hallelu.
[24:15] Hallelu.
[24:20] Hallelujah.
[24:21] [Music]
[24:25] Hallelujah.
[24:30] I love you Jesus.
[24:35] I love you Jesus.
[24:41] I love you Jesus.
[24:47] I love you, Jesus.
[24:52] I love you, Jesus.
[24:58] I love you, Jesus.
[25:04] I love you, Jesus.
[25:09] I love you, Lord. Oh, let's just lift
[25:14] our hands and just thank the Lord for
[25:16] his grace and mercy today.
[25:19] Just thank the Lord for his hand in our
[25:21] lives and what he's doing that he walks
[25:25] with us and he talks with us. He's
[25:27] leading us along this journey. He's our
[25:30] provider. He's our comfort. He's our
[25:32] peace. And Lord, we say thank you for
[25:35] that. We thank you, Lord, that you are
[25:38] everything that we need today. every
[25:41] need, Father, that we have, you already
[25:44] have the answer for it. And Father, we
[25:47] just come and say thank you, Lord Jesus,
[25:50] for your grace and for your mercy today
[25:52] in our lives. We just ask you, Father,
[25:55] come down in this service, Lord. Just
[25:57] speak to our hearts. Encourage us, Lord.
[26:00] May your presence be known to each and
[26:02] everyone, Lord. We thank you. We thank
[26:06] you, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I believe we can
[26:11] say it's good to be in the house of the
[26:13] Lord today. Amen. And prayer requests. I
[26:16] had it written down but I didn't bring
[26:18] it out. And so sorry I don't want to
[26:21] sound duplicate but remember brother
[26:23] David, sister Diane, sister Ruth as they
[26:25] will be traveling once again uh coming
[26:28] back home from the funeral. And um those
[26:31] of you I don't know who all would have
[26:33] received it, but Sister April sent out a
[26:36] very interesting little uh deal. Did any
[26:38] of you receive that from Sister April?
[26:41] Um anyway, she's just talking about how
[26:44] the little church that she has attended
[26:46] several times there in Thailand, uh the
[26:49] minister got up and said, "Hey, I feel
[26:51] like I've been corrected that um there's
[26:55] such a movement for speaking in tongues
[26:58] being the evidence of the Holy Ghost."
[27:00] And uh then he just went through and
[27:02] started to share how that there has to
[27:05] be a life that goes with it. It's not
[27:06] just about speaking in tongues, but
[27:09] there's a life that goes with this and
[27:11] that evidence comes out of that life.
[27:13] And and uh um sister Carrie brought up
[27:17] already, brother Persant, sister Aona,
[27:20] we just want the Lord to come on their
[27:22] on their behalf and these situations.
[27:24] You know, uh we look at what's happening
[27:26] in the world today and how there seems
[27:29] to be so much chaos. there has to
[27:32] there's so much uncertainty and um we
[27:36] just look at that and realize that this
[27:38] is exactly the way God wanted it.
[27:40] Nothing is out of control.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; So we look at that and think oh my there
[27:45] just seems to be everything going
[27:47] sideways. I would say today that um we
[27:51] stand on the word of God everything is
[27:53] perfectly in its place. Everything's
[27:56] perfect. Amen. We have a lot missing
[27:59] today. Unfortunately, I'm slightly
[28:01] envious of them. They're up in the
[28:03] mountains camping and uh so we we just
[28:06] want the Lord to be with them on their
[28:09] journey home from that. Uh we have quite
[28:11] a few that would be online today and uh
[28:14] we certainly want the Lord to just bless
[28:17] them and uh I just always think about
[28:20] our sister Dorcas and suffering there in
[28:23] her flesh. We just ask the Lord to uh to
[28:27] just touch our sister and just give her
[28:29] a complete healing. And um those that
[28:32] are out of fellowship as we've kind of
[28:35] already covered that in a way. There are
[28:36] those uh of our own family, those of the
[28:39] body that that have kind of went astray
[28:42] a little bit uh not recognizing who they
[28:45] are totally in Jesus Christ. And we want
[28:48] to just remember them. Amen. Uh to lift
[28:51] each and every one of those up. I want
[28:53] to speak to you today on uh the thought
[28:56] or title of gaining focus in an age of
[28:59] uncertainty.
[29:01] And so as we are here today, we look at
[29:04] this the age is more chaotic than ever.
[29:07] the time, the news. it it would be uh as
[29:11] uh I seen a little it was actually like
[29:13] a little cartoon uh thing and it showed
[29:16] a bottle and it said uh anxiety take two
[29:20] daily and uh you know that's the day
[29:23] that we live in right a lot of anxieties
[29:26] a lot of people concerned but here again
[29:29] God is completely in control so we want
[29:32] to we want to just speak on this thought
[29:34] of gaining focus because you see what's
[29:36] happening in this hour right now.
[29:39] Satan's here to distract us, to get us
[29:41] to look away. But the word of God, the
[29:44] book is open, is it not?
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as the book has been open, it
[29:49] has caused the bride of Christ to be
[29:52] more focused. It shows us who we are,
[29:54] where we're going, what is going to
[29:56] happen. Now, what happens out there?
[29:58] Don't Now, I don't want to sound like we
[30:00] don't care. We do care. But the thing is
[30:02] is here's the bride of Jesus Christ and
[30:05] she's focused on her bridegroom. And so
[30:08] that's really where her care is. She's
[30:10] not she's not worried about what's
[30:11] happening down the road or around the
[30:13] globe in that context. She cares about
[30:16] her relationship with the bridegroom.
[30:19] Amen. With her Lord and Savior Jesus
[30:21] Christ. Amen. Let's just turn our Bibles
[30:23] this morning. So glad glad to be here
[30:26] with you and um glad to see each and
[30:28] every one of you here today. Amen.
[30:31] Proverbs the 3rd chapter verses 1-6.
[30:45] My son,
[30:47] forget not my law, but let thine heart
[30:50] keep my commandments. For length of
[30:52] days, and long life, and peace shall
[30:56] they add to thee. Let not mercy and
[30:59] truth forsake thee. bind them about thy
[31:01] neck, and write them upon the table of
[31:03] thine heart. So shalt thou find favor
[31:06] and good understanding in the sight of
[31:09] God and man. I want to read verse four
[31:11] again. So shalt thou find favor and good
[31:16] understanding. Amen. That's what we
[31:18] desire today is have good understanding.
[31:20] We want to understand what God is
[31:22] speaking, what his plan is. What not
[31:25] just a plan for a world, but his plan
[31:26] for our life. Amen. We we want to
[31:29] understand that. And here uh the book of
[31:32] Proverbs, it's being laid out showing us
[31:34] that we will have good understanding in
[31:36] the sight of God and man. Trust in the
[31:38] Lord with all thine heart and lean not
[31:40] unto thine own understanding. In all thy
[31:43] ways acknowledge him and he shall direct
[31:46] thy paths. Heavenly Father, we just ask
[31:49] you to come this morning. Speak to our
[31:50] hearts, Lord. We have needs, Lord. We
[31:53] have desires, Father, and we just commit
[31:56] them to you, Father, for we know that
[31:58] you are in control of all things and you
[32:00] have the answers that we need. So, we
[32:02] come today, Father, just to pour out our
[32:05] heart's desire. And Lord, because you
[32:07] know our hearts, we do not necessarily
[32:10] even have to voice them for you to know
[32:13] what our need and desire is. And we lift
[32:16] those to you, Father, and ask thy
[32:17] perfect will be done today in the name
[32:19] of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated
[32:24] &gt;&gt; as we're looking and and I don't know
[32:26] you know we all approach things in life
[32:28] a tad bit different and uh so I am
[32:31] constantly uh looking kind of taking a
[32:37] snapshot uh of what the world around us
[32:41] is is uh happening. Not that uh I want
[32:44] that to set the course of my life. I
[32:46] don't want that to cause me to be happy
[32:48] or sad. But I I I just uh you might say
[32:52] put a a finger on the heartbeat of of
[32:55] the world today. And you know people are
[32:58] baffled and perplexed. Uh I I don't mean
[33:01] to focus this to my world but in the
[33:03] world of agriculture uh there is a great
[33:06] paradox. People are saying what what is
[33:08] going on? Why why are these things you
[33:11] know happening? uh it's affecting
[33:13] people's lives, their their mental
[33:16] health, their emotional health, their
[33:18] financial health, and they're baffled
[33:20] and they're perplexed. But my brother
[33:22] and sister, the scripture, if you go and
[33:24] start digging through the meanings of
[33:26] some of these scriptures, you'll you'll
[33:28] find that this is the time that is
[33:30] fitting perfectly with the word. In
[33:32] other words, it's already been
[33:34] prophesied that this would come in this
[33:36] time that the people would be baffled.
[33:38] they would they would be to where they
[33:40] they're confused about what is going on
[33:42] around them and why it is. And the word
[33:45] perplexed and baffled are are pretty
[33:47] much in the same context. You know, they
[33:50] come to a place that it's almost as
[33:52] though they're uh paralyzed a little bit
[33:56] to to what should we do? What what is
[33:58] the right thing to do? What direction
[34:00] should we go? And you know, even to the
[34:03] point that people are are there and
[34:05] don't even realize they're actually
[34:07] speaking the scripture out. Now, talking
[34:09] about people not necessarily uh really
[34:12] desiring or focused on serving God, but
[34:15] they find themselves unwittingly, you
[34:17] might say, under the influence of the
[34:19] age, they're actually speaking these
[34:21] things that are in scripture. People
[34:23] declaring this is no age, no time to
[34:26] have a child. this is uh you know an
[34:28] evil time, a confused time. We we
[34:32] shouldn't do this. We shouldn't bring a
[34:33] a child in and we shouldn't this and we
[34:36] shouldn't that and and we've got to do
[34:39] this and you need to go and you know I I
[34:41] just was listening to a little deal and
[34:43] the guy was touting how the economy is
[34:46] going to collapse. There's all these
[34:48] signs that uh have happened in nations
[34:51] in the past and they're coming to a
[34:53] point that it should uh it's going to
[34:55] collapse and you should buy gold because
[34:57] gold's going to be your only security.
[35:00] But my brother and sister, the word of
[35:02] God says that being filled with the Holy
[35:04] Ghost and being in Jesus Christ is our
[35:07] only security. Amen. So we can't find a
[35:11] a fortress, a tunnel in the rock
[35:13] somewhere. We can't store up all our
[35:15] food. We can't store up everything that
[35:17] we would need to survive this. My
[35:20] brother and sister, what we need to do
[35:21] is be in Christ the rock. Amen. And when
[35:24] we are in Christ the rock, we would find
[35:27] that he will take care of us. Amen.
[35:29] Whether it's a brook in the wilderness
[35:31] as he was with the prophet Elijah. And
[35:33] then, you know, God is such a uh such an
[35:36] awesome God, if you would put it that
[35:38] way, that when God wanted to move
[35:40] Elijah, he just dried up the brook. You
[35:43] know, that seems almost cruel. you know,
[35:45] why why would you do that? Couldn't you
[35:47] have just, you know, written him a
[35:49] letter and explained why he need to do
[35:52] that? But that's not always how God
[35:53] works. Sometimes God just dries up the
[35:56] brook. Amen. He wants to feed you in the
[35:58] wilderness, he'll send a raven to do it.
[36:01] Amen. But if he wants to move you, he'll
[36:03] let you get thirsty and he'll let you
[36:05] get hungry to cause you to move where he
[36:08] wants you to be. Now, his leadership is
[36:11] perfect if we'll listen. And uh so as we
[36:14] look at this, we're li we're looking in
[36:15] a day, my brother and sister, that uh
[36:18] there is a lot of baffled people, a lot
[36:20] of perplex perplexed people. Uh they
[36:23] don't understand this. And you know, I'm
[36:26] going to put this and hopefully you'll
[36:27] understand the context, my brother and
[36:29] sister. Has nothing to do with the
[36:31] president of the United States. Has
[36:34] nothing to do with the president of
[36:36] Russia. Has nothing to do with the
[36:38] politics of the world. It has nothing to
[36:41] do with economics and droughts and
[36:43] floods. It has all to do with the word
[36:45] of God being fulfilled.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God will fulfill his word. He
[36:51] will make it happen. And so we just want
[36:55] to stand in a position and say, you know
[36:57] what, Lord, I want to be in the center
[36:59] of your perfect will. I want to be in
[37:02] that place that you called me to be. And
[37:05] when we recognize that we as sons and
[37:07] daughters of God, that's who we are
[37:08] today, right? And when we recognize that
[37:11] we are sons and daughters of God, then
[37:13] we will recognize that we are being held
[37:16] in the very hands of God. We are there
[37:19] at his heart. Amen. We're never out of
[37:22] his thoughts. We're never out of his
[37:24] that you know, Satan would like to
[37:26] convince you that you would get so far
[37:29] out of the will of God that there's no
[37:31] way for you to fulfill the will of God.
[37:33] But the word of God says that God would
[37:36] always bring you back. as he talks about
[37:38] in the scripture, the lost sheep of
[37:40] Israel. Amen. He may have taken them
[37:42] through hard times, but he always
[37:44] brought them back and he's putting them
[37:46] back in their correct position. And
[37:49] that's where God's dealing with you and
[37:50] I the same way. Amen. We might be on the
[37:54] fringe, you might say, for a moment or a
[37:56] bit of time. And so, we look at that,
[37:59] but realizing that God has said, you
[38:01] know what? I chose you. I paid for you.
[38:04] I hold the title deed to you. You are
[38:08] mine. Amen. And when we recognize that,
[38:11] we'll realize that Satan has no more
[38:14] right to you than he has a right to
[38:17] heaven.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16th chapter verses 3-9.
[38:27] Commit thy works unto the Lord and thy
[38:30] thoughts shall be established. You know,
[38:34] sometimes now, look, I I I just I don't
[38:37] know exactly how to say this, but often
[38:40] times, my brother and sister, we say
[38:42] we're going through great mind battles.
[38:45] Anybody have mind battles sometime?
[38:47] Great great battle that's going on. But
[38:49] you see what we need to do is realize
[38:52] that these things are all connected as
[38:54] it would be not one independent out here
[38:58] something just uh out here but you when
[39:01] you commit your works to God. Amen. And
[39:05] your thoughts are then established
[39:08] you'll realize that part of the mind
[39:11] battle is a self-inflicted
[39:13] thing.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[39:17] You know the saying that's out there,
[39:19] the man who says he can and the man who
[39:22] says he can't are both right.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Because the man who says he can't,
[39:31] his actions
[39:33] will reflect what he's testifying of.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; I can't. Yeah.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; So everything that he says and does and
[39:42] thinks and everything is there I is
[39:46] affecting his thoughts are affecting his
[39:48] works and his works are affecting his
[39:50] thoughts and it becomes a cycle.
[39:56] Brother Gideon Retie many years ago
[39:58] preached a sermon getting out of the
[40:01] wrong cycle cycle breaker different
[40:03] titles that go with that as it was
[40:06] posted in different ways. But you see,
[40:08] there comes a time, my brother and
[40:09] sister, there's a cycle that we all get
[40:12] into. And as we get into this cycle,
[40:15] we'll find we say, "Well, I I'm just
[40:16] into something and I can't break it."
[40:19] You'll find that your actions reinforce
[40:21] the cycle. And your thoughts reinforce
[40:24] the cycle. And it comes to a time that
[40:26] we must stop and say, you know what,
[40:28] Lord, this cycle is not beneficial for
[40:31] me as a son or daughter of God. And I
[40:34] need your help, but I am going to break
[40:38] this cycle.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So then the action starts to
[40:42] change and we start moving out of the
[40:44] cycle. And as we start to move out of
[40:47] the cycle, we start to see things in our
[40:49] life changing. We start to see attitude
[40:52] changing. we start to see every aspect
[40:54] about our life starting to change and
[40:57] Satan will do everything he can to push
[40:59] you back into that cycle. But when we
[41:02] get into the cycle of the word, amen,
[41:04] and we start to read the word and we
[41:06] feed on the word and we start to confess
[41:08] that the word is what we need to live
[41:10] and the word is who we are and the word
[41:13] is changing me, you'll get into a whole
[41:15] another cycle that moves you out and you
[41:18] look back one day and say, "Was that
[41:20] really me? Was that really me? Did I
[41:23] really think like that? Did I really act
[41:25] like that? And you will see, my brother
[41:27] and sister, it's not a man who took you
[41:29] there. But it was the presence of the
[41:32] Holy Spirit dealing with you, starting
[41:34] to break the cycles of our life. And as
[41:37] we'll look at that, see, we'll see that
[41:39] our thoughts and our our works and our
[41:42] thoughts being established in the word
[41:44] of God. This is the maturity of a
[41:46] Christian. This is where a Christian
[41:48] starts to come. You know, as a
[41:50] testimony, you know, I ain't what I
[41:53] ought to be. Oh my, my brain's going to
[41:55] go blank on there. You know what I'm
[41:57] talking about. But praise God, I'm not
[41:59] who I used to be.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a lot of room for us to
[42:02] grow and we can see our mistakes and we
[42:05] see where we should be growing. But I
[42:07] want you to also look and see that you
[42:09] are not the same person that you have
[42:12] been in the past because God is now
[42:14] establishing
[42:16] uh thoughts in your life and action in
[42:19] your life. Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; The Lord hath made all things for
[42:24] himself. Yay, even the wicked for the
[42:26] day of evil.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; I always found this to be a very
[42:29] profound thought. Some people would say,
[42:32] "Well, John 3:16, for God so loved the
[42:34] world that he gave his only begotten
[42:36] son." But you realize not everyone wants
[42:38] to be saved.
[42:41] There's a lot of people who like living
[42:43] like they live. There's something inside
[42:46] of them that embraces that. And so we'll
[42:50] look here as we read this scripture. Now
[42:52] this doesn't make me happy because it
[42:54] looks as though some people are
[42:56] unsavable. But um says the Lord hath
[43:00] made all things for himself. Yay even
[43:02] the wicked for the day of evil. So you
[43:06] realize that in this whole grand scheme
[43:08] God knew who would believe and who would
[43:11] not. He knew who would step out in faith
[43:14] and who would not. He knew who would say
[43:18] amen. So be it to the word. And who
[43:20] would not? And people say, "Is God
[43:23] forcing us to believe?" No. He just
[43:25] knows your heart.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Knows my heart. And when he sees that,
[43:30] my brother and sister, I I want you to
[43:32] just think about this. It's been
[43:34] something that's been on my heart quite
[43:35] a bit lately. If you wonder about where
[43:38] you fit in the whole plan, mistakes. I
[43:40] won't even ask you if there's anyone
[43:41] here who makes mistakes. I'm just going
[43:43] to assume that there is.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Is that safe?
[43:48] Yeah.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:53] [Music]
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Have you reached David's level yet?
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Not me. Yes, you.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, you.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; God does not have degrees of sin.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:16] And God turned right around and said,
[44:17] "David is a man after my own heart."
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; What?
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; When you read all of the things that
[44:26] David said and all the things that David
[44:28] did, how could he be a man after God's
[44:31] own heart? I'll tell you how. Because he
[44:34] knew how to repent.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; He knew how to say, "Lord, I'm sorry."
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the prophet Samuel comes to
[44:41] him and says, "Hey, about this little
[44:43] sheep, and one man has many, and one has
[44:45] one, but the man with many takes the one
[44:48] that has one and takes his sheep." And
[44:50] David righteously says he should die.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; You realize he was prophesying his own
[44:57] judgment.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; But God said, "I have grace.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; I have grace for you, David."
[45:08] Oh my brother and sister, don't let the
[45:10] devil condemn you.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Don't let him tell you that you just
[45:13] going in that cycle just going to come
[45:15] back the same thing. That's who you are.
[45:17] That's what you'll always be. Well, let
[45:19] there be a cycle. All right. Forgive me,
[45:21] Lord.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Lord. I made a mistake, but
[45:24] forgive me, Lord. And my brother and
[45:26] sister, because he has grace, he comes
[45:29] and says, you know what? They have a
[45:31] repentant heart. They're after my heart.
[45:34] Amen. Because they will ask for
[45:36] forgiveness, they are after my heart.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Everyone that is proud in heart is an
[45:43] abomination to the Lord. Though hand
[45:46] join in hand, he shall not be
[45:49] unpunished. By mercy and truth, iniquity
[45:53] is purged. Now, I find iniquity is a
[45:56] very interesting thought because the
[45:58] scripture says because of iniquity, the
[46:01] love of many shall wax cold. So it's
[46:04] there knowing what we should do but not
[46:06] doing it would slowly take the heat out
[46:09] of our relationship. We'll start to to
[46:12] get lukewarm and ultimately if we don't
[46:15] change that cycle we'll get cold. But
[46:18] look how this works now my brother and
[46:20] sister. It is there that mercy and truth
[46:24] are what do away with iniquity.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Can we separate that? I'm going to just
[46:30] cut truth off. just mercy. Mercy can
[46:35] take away iniquity,
[46:36] &gt;&gt; but God says truth needs to come. But we
[46:39] can have truth with no mercy and still
[46:43] not be finished.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; So God using those two together.
[46:51] He has mercy on us, but he gives us
[46:53] truth. And it's truth that breaks a
[46:55] cycle of iniquity.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; And by the fear of the Lord, men depart
[47:00] from evil. When a man's ways please the
[47:03] Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be
[47:05] at peace with him. I always love that.
[47:08] Amen. How you can see down through the
[47:10] years through history that when when God
[47:13] would be with a man, would be with a
[47:15] nation, would be with a government,
[47:17] would be with that, you'll see how that
[47:20] there would be those times that peace
[47:22] would reign. And you can look back as
[47:25] just a type. You can look back through
[47:27] uh the history of Israel and when they
[47:29] had kings that were serving
[47:32] wholeheartedly and committing the nation
[47:34] to serve God wholeheartedly to stand
[47:37] upon the word of God for that hour,
[47:39] Israel had peace. But soon as a king or
[47:42] a leadership would come in that would
[47:44] not stand on the word, you would see
[47:47] that suddenly Israel's enemies would
[47:49] start to rise up against them. And so
[47:52] it's there all through this cycle over
[47:55] and over again through the Old Testament
[47:58] that there would be those that would
[47:59] come in and it didn't matter of age. We
[48:02] think that wisdom comes with years, but
[48:04] my brother and sister, wisdom comes with
[48:06] revelation. Amen. And so there it is
[48:09] that we'll see a a young king who says
[48:12] we have to serve God and his nation is
[48:15] raised up in a culture of peace and
[48:18] prosperity. And then we'll see those
[48:20] that says, "We're just interested in the
[48:22] power. We don't really care what God
[48:24] said. We just want to be in control."
[48:26] And it's there that the proud heart then
[48:29] brings the enemies out of the woodwork.
[48:31] It starts to bring disaster and drought.
[48:33] And you know, sometimes we'll see it as
[48:36] has been in the world news here in the
[48:38] recent time. You know, sometimes too
[48:41] much rain is just as devastating as too
[48:44] little. And so you'll see that all these
[48:46] floods like we're having in our nation,
[48:49] you know, my brother and sister, you see
[48:51] I we'll think if it will just rain, but
[48:53] if unless it rains according to the
[48:55] word, Amen. when that comes down, man
[48:59] would feel like, oh, praise God, our
[49:01] church is having a revival, is that
[49:03] revival led of the Holy Ghost or is that
[49:05] a man-led revival? Amen. So they feel
[49:08] like it's God. But really, in reality,
[49:10] it's man. And so that's just as bad as a
[49:13] church that's dried up. Amen. You got
[49:15] shouting, you got running, you got
[49:17] screaming, you got all of these things.
[49:19] But if it's not something that registers
[49:21] down in the heart, if it's not something
[49:23] that was from God poured out into the
[49:26] soul, Amen. it will soon dry up. Amen.
[49:29] Every flood is followed by a drought.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; And every drought is followed by rain.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; But not every rain turns into a flood.
[49:40] Got it?
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[49:43] &gt;&gt; You see, these are cycles that God is
[49:45] bringing about in our life. Amen. So, we
[49:48] don't want to be too far to the right.
[49:50] We don't want to be too far to the left.
[49:52] God's word centers us. Amen. And so,
[49:55] we're coming in a time in an age now
[49:58] with all the politics, all the stuff uh
[50:01] that is here. And if I mention polit
[50:03] political type stuff, forgive me, but
[50:05] it's just a reference point. Uh amen. as
[50:08] our nation is prophesied that United
[50:10] States would be bankrupt. And my brother
[50:13] and sister, I don't know if you you
[50:15] caught this, but back a few months, the
[50:17] Office of Management and Budget uh come
[50:20] along and said, "By our projections, the
[50:23] United States could never pay its way
[50:26] out of its national debt." And so you
[50:28] look at this, my brother and sister,
[50:30] we're slowly moving forward, but it was
[50:32] prophesied that the nation would be
[50:34] broke.
[50:36] And I prophecy will come to pass because
[50:38] it already is. And it's being testified
[50:42] by people who are not thinking about it
[50:44] in the same context that we would. But
[50:47] you see, there has to come a time
[50:49] because Revelation says, the book of
[50:51] Revelation says that there'll come a
[50:53] time that the beast will control
[50:55] everything. And so it will be there as
[50:58] the debt is paid uh by means that you
[51:01] might not even understand. Now, one
[51:04] time, Brother Eugene Brown preached here
[51:06] in the church and and uh some of you
[51:08] might remember it, but he preached a
[51:10] sermon that just seemed to be, you know,
[51:12] like where are you coming from, brother
[51:13] Eugene? But he was talking about how
[51:16] nations, how governments, how they would
[51:18] look at it. And do you realize that the
[51:20] government looks at you a as a forum?
[51:23] They're not going to announce this to
[51:24] the world, but they look at you and they
[51:27] have actually offered you up as
[51:30] collateral to our debt. Mhm.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; That sounds strange, doesn't it? Wait, I
[51:35] didn't sign anything. But did you notice
[51:38] back, you know, probably two and a half
[51:40] decades, 20, 25, 30 years, they changed
[51:43] it from the government had debt. Now
[51:45] they make statements like every man,
[51:48] woman, boy, and girl in the United
[51:50] States owes this much of the debt.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; So it's coming out. You say those are
[51:58] just simple words. No, that's how they
[51:59] look at you. And they're looking at you
[52:01] as in your lifetime you will pay X
[52:05] amount of taxes, you will do this, you
[52:07] will do that. That will be to produce
[52:09] this portion. Now my brother and sister,
[52:12] whether you like it or not, as a citizen
[52:14] of the United States, uh uh and being
[52:16] here in the United States, they have
[52:18] full expectation of you contributing
[52:22] to their well-being.
[52:25] It's not the well-being of the nation
[52:28] &gt;&gt; because the well-being of the nation
[52:29] would be they would make us debtree,
[52:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:32] &gt;&gt; But you see, there comes a time by
[52:34] prophecy in the book of Revelation that
[52:36] comes a time that there has to be a debt
[52:38] that cannot be paid. Do you see a
[52:40] parallel?
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. A debt that cannot be paid. Amen.
[52:44] But our Lord Jesus stepped in and said,
[52:46] "I'll pay your debt." But in the book of
[52:49] Revelation, the beast is the one who
[52:51] steps in and says, "I will pay that
[52:54] carnal natural debt." Amen. And people
[52:57] will be happy to receive the mark to be
[53:01] debtree.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; You can't serve Jesus Christ today
[53:06] without being marked.
[53:09] But it's not in your forehead as it
[53:11] would be. Now, let's just touch on that
[53:13] for a moment. Some people when they read
[53:15] the book of Revelation think the mark in
[53:17] the forehead is is like being branded or
[53:20] a microchip. You remember years ago it
[53:22] was in Florida. A grocery chain in
[53:24] Florida did a great experiment. They it
[53:27] took them a while to get enough
[53:28] volunteers to to sign up for it to
[53:31] really be a relevant experiment. But uh
[53:33] they were they were offering it was a
[53:36] very large grocery chain there and they
[53:38] were offering to have a microchip
[53:40] inserted in the back of your hand and
[53:42] you had to submit certain information
[53:45] you know bank account numbers etc etc to
[53:47] validate this. But people who are so
[53:50] looking for convenience amen the age
[53:54] that we have need of nothing
[53:56] &gt;&gt; we're lovers of pleasure.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; We don't have time to pay for our
[54:01] groceries.
[54:03] So, we would have a little microchip and
[54:05] you gather your groceries and you go
[54:07] through the thing and it scans your
[54:10] groceries and you just put your hand up
[54:12] there and
[54:14] and you leave. That's right.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; You know, it took all of 30 days for the
[54:19] hackers to hack that system and people's
[54:22] accounts were drained of tens of
[54:24] thousands of dollars for one cart of
[54:27] groceries.
[54:29] Now my brother and sister, people said
[54:31] that is the mark of the beast.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; No, it's not.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; It's when the people themselves agree,
[54:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:41] &gt;&gt; When they themselves embrace
[54:44] and say what is happening is good.
[54:49] You see, these
[54:51] are the signs that God is giving clarity
[54:53] to the bride of Christ that we don't
[54:55] fall into that mental trap.
[54:59] We don't fall into that spiritual trap.
[55:02] You see, my brother and sister, Jesus
[55:04] Christ already paid the price. No one
[55:05] else can pay it for you.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing that needs to
[55:09] happen is for us to believe and trust
[55:13] and claim what God has already done for
[55:15] us. Amen. We don't need another savior.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; We have a savior.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you see how it works. Now,
[55:22] this sounds political, but I don't mean
[55:24] it. People believe Mr. Trump, and I
[55:26] believe I I actually kind of, you might
[55:28] say, am a supporter of some of the
[55:30] things that he's doing. I I see the end
[55:33] uh thing that he is shooting for. But my
[55:35] brother and sister, I don't need Mr.
[55:37] Trump to be my savior. Amen. He'll
[55:40] fulfill the word that God called him to
[55:42] and you will fulfill the word that God
[55:44] called you to. Amen. But he's not going
[55:47] to save you. And when you got a nation
[55:50] that owes in the trillions or whatever
[55:52] it is, my brother and sister, you know,
[55:55] I think it's in the trillions, isn't it?
[55:56] The debt. Yeah.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; 30 something trillion. Amen.
[56:02] Nobody's going to save the nation
[56:04] financially, my brother and sister. Even
[56:06] their own office of management and
[56:08] budget says there's no way we can do
[56:11] this. Now what I'm wanting to you say
[56:14] why are you making this point? Because
[56:16] God is brought his word to you and I
[56:19] that we could get focused on what is
[56:22] going to save us. Amen. What he called
[56:25] us to. Amen. In an age of uncertainty,
[56:28] people say, "I'm anxious about the
[56:31] future." I'm telling you, I know what my
[56:34] future is. I know what God called me to.
[56:37] I read the word, but it's not just
[56:39] reading the word because many read the
[56:41] word, but the word is speaking. And
[56:43] there's something been placed inside of
[56:45] us to understand what it is saying.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, my brother and
[56:50] sister is brother David. I like that,
[56:52] brother David. How that fits in with my
[56:54] thought. Amen. So, he's there and
[56:57] brother David, I couldn't even pretend
[56:58] to repeat what he just greeted, you
[57:01] know, out with our brother, you know,
[57:03] those words. But my brother and sister,
[57:05] what I do know, amen, is when God speaks
[57:08] to me, I don't have to go to to Google
[57:11] and ask it to translate it.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is coming down speaking
[57:16] to us. We say there's things in the word
[57:18] of God. I do not understand. I'm
[57:21] uncertain about this. I'm uncertain
[57:23] about that. Just let the spirit speak.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Revelations 2, Revelations 3. Amen. Hear
[57:30] what the spirit is saying to the
[57:32] churches. God is speaking in this day
[57:35] that we're living in now. God is
[57:37] speaking. It's not that God is silent.
[57:39] It's that we're not listening.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; I hope that doesn't come across too
[57:44] strong, but it's a fact. We're caught up
[57:46] with this over here and guess over
[57:49] there. We're focused, my brother and
[57:50] sister. You know, now this is not what
[57:52] we want to call irresponsibility.
[57:56] that I I'm just going to I'm just going
[57:58] to live on the borderline of poverty
[58:00] because praise God, God will take care
[58:02] of me. My brother and sister, the word
[58:04] says that we should have stewardship
[58:06] over our kingdom.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; If you got animals, you need to feed
[58:10] them.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've got a car, you need to
[58:14] change the oil.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you got a house, you ought to
[58:17] put a new roof on it every once in a
[58:18] while. Amen. This is called stewardship.
[58:22] But my brother and sister, none of that
[58:24] will replace the stewardship of our
[58:26] soul.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; None of that will will replace what God
[58:30] has called us to feed ourselves. I've
[58:33] always used this analogy and I stand
[58:35] with it. None of us are crazy enough to
[58:37] think we could get in our car this
[58:39] afternoon and drive all the way to the
[58:41] East Coast without stopping for gas
[58:43] somewhere.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; TripleA loves people like that. They get
[58:49] to come rescue you.
[58:52] I'm being facitious. They don't they're
[58:54] like, "You just passed five gas stations
[58:56] and you're sitting here in the middle of
[58:57] nowhere empty." But look how this is in
[59:00] in the spiritual walk. People are
[59:02] passing a refilling or refilling a
[59:05] refilling
[59:06] because we're too focused on something
[59:09] else. God says, "I want you to slow
[59:12] down. I want you to pull in here. I want
[59:14] you to get filled with the spirit. I
[59:16] want you to let the word be poured into
[59:18] you. And when the word is poured into
[59:21] you, your soul will be restored. Go
[59:24] study the scripture of what it's talking
[59:26] about. Create in me a clean heart. What
[59:28] was that? It was create something that
[59:31] was never there. No, my brother and
[59:33] sister. It's talking about restoring
[59:35] something that was already existing.
[59:38] Create in me a clean heart. Is there for
[59:41] sons and daughters of God saying, "Lord,
[59:43] restore me back to the position." This
[59:45] is where David was at. restore me back
[59:47] to the position that I know I belong in.
[59:51] It's not restore me to something I know
[59:54] nothing about, but restore me back to
[59:56] the position, the place that I know I
[59:59] belong in. And I think sometimes God's
[1:00:02] trying to get our attention, but he's
[1:00:03] kind also.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's not a bully, right?
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Prophet said the Holy Ghost is a
[1:00:11] gentleman.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. the type of the dove.
[1:00:16] You look at this.
[1:00:19] When a man's ways, verse seven, please
[1:00:21] the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to
[1:00:23] be at peace with him. And I tell you,
[1:00:25] regardless of what the world is around
[1:00:27] you, it's nice to have peace. Better is
[1:00:30] a little with righteousness than great
[1:00:32] revenue without right.
[1:00:35] A man's heart deiseth his way, but the
[1:00:39] Lord directth his steps.
[1:00:42] And I'll just put it this way. We got a
[1:00:44] lot of young people and stuff. If the
[1:00:46] Lord leads you, you know, I come I grew
[1:00:48] up in a generation that they would tell
[1:00:50] you young people, don't go to college
[1:00:51] cuz, you know, you'll just go there and
[1:00:53] backslide and the devil will rip up your
[1:00:55] life. But I'm telling you, the word's
[1:00:56] already covered that. Just get filled
[1:00:58] with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Seek you
[1:01:00] first the kingdom of God. You go off,
[1:01:03] you get an education in the university.
[1:01:06] Amen. And as long as you're seeking God,
[1:01:09] you're bulletproof in the university.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Is it okay to put it that way?
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; You're absolutely bulletproof because if
[1:01:19] God's already sealed you, Satan can't
[1:01:21] even get in there to unseal you.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. But that comes, that sealing comes
[1:01:28] not from saying, "I once was filled with
[1:01:31] the Holy Ghost." But that constant
[1:01:33] refilling, that constant seeking the
[1:01:36] will of God, the mind of God. Amen. Go
[1:01:39] to university, come right out of
[1:01:41] university, go on in life, get married,
[1:01:43] have a career if that's what it is. And
[1:01:45] you go and people say, "I don't know how
[1:01:47] they did that." I'll tell you how they
[1:01:49] did. They caught a revelation that they
[1:01:51] themselves was in control of how they
[1:01:55] approached the university. It wasn't the
[1:01:57] devil that was in control. They were in
[1:02:00] control. And they said, "I'm going to
[1:02:01] seek the Lord and I'm going to go there
[1:02:03] and I'm going to follow his will. I'm
[1:02:05] going to follow his direction. I'm going
[1:02:07] to follow his guidance and I'm going to
[1:02:09] follow the Holy Spirit and he's going to
[1:02:10] lead me and guide me to all truth."
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; See, we're gaining focus.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; It's no longer we hope we make it
[1:02:18] through this world unscathed.
[1:02:22] No soldier fights in a battle without
[1:02:26] being wounded in some form.
[1:02:31] But you don't have to die on the
[1:02:32] battlefield.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Wednesday night, I believe it was
[1:02:39] emphasis come out of the the sermon.
[1:02:42] You're more than a conqueror.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; You can't be defeated in this day and
[1:02:49] stand on the word and say, "I'm more
[1:02:50] than a conqueror." That's defeated.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:02:57] You're either defeated or you're a
[1:02:58] conqueror.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; And the word says you're more than a
[1:03:01] conqueror.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; So that means you've even stepped beyond
[1:03:04] that. You say, "But you don't understand
[1:03:06] the challenges I have in your my life."
[1:03:09] Yeah, I understand that. I may not
[1:03:10] comprehend the challenge you have, but
[1:03:12] are you going to believe your challenge
[1:03:15] or the word?
[1:03:17] And if the word says you're more than
[1:03:19] victorious, more than a conqueror, then
[1:03:21] why don't you just stand on the word and
[1:03:22] say, "Lord, I believe that and I'm going
[1:03:24] to confess that and that's who I am and
[1:03:26] that's what's going to happen in my life
[1:03:27] and I'm going to walk out of here a
[1:03:29] conqueror." Amen. I'm not going to get
[1:03:31] drugged out of here by my heels,
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; but I'm going to be able to stand here
[1:03:35] as a conqueror.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, we got to come uh to an
[1:03:41] understanding that what the world is out
[1:03:44] here, my brother and sister, and what it
[1:03:46] looks like.
[1:03:48] We're so influenced by these things,
[1:03:51] this external things. We're so
[1:03:53] influenced by it that we start to look
[1:03:55] at this and we start to say, "Oh my uh
[1:03:58] um you know what what's going to happen,
[1:04:00] you know, if there's famine on the earth
[1:04:02] and this and that." Well, I tell you, my
[1:04:05] brother and sister, uh there was once a
[1:04:07] a a a mother
[1:04:10] and the meal barrel was getting empty.
[1:04:13] The land is in a drought. In fact, they
[1:04:16] say that it was such a bad drought that
[1:04:18] even all of the sticks to create a fire.
[1:04:21] Had been picked up. There was nothing
[1:04:23] hardly to even make a fire with.
[1:04:27] Everybody had scavenged everything that
[1:04:29] they could put in their little stove.
[1:04:32] And a prophet comes down, prophet Elijah
[1:04:35] comes down and instead of sympathizing
[1:04:37] with this woman, I want I want you to
[1:04:39] understand how God works because he
[1:04:41] wants to bring certainty to you and I to
[1:04:45] get rid of our anxieties of whether he's
[1:04:48] in control. And a prophet Elijah comes
[1:04:50] down and as he comes up to her and and
[1:04:52] he would greet her, he he he says, you
[1:04:56] know, hey, um look, before you cook that
[1:04:58] meal, you know, and she says, well, I'm
[1:05:00] just cooking the last one. then me and
[1:05:01] my son are going to die.
[1:05:04] He says, "Make me one first."
[1:05:07] Can you believe how greedy that preacher
[1:05:09] was?
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. I want you to see a little
[1:05:14] humor in that. But it's the truth. If
[1:05:16] you had the wrong attitude, the wrong
[1:05:18] spirit, you'd be saying, "The preacher
[1:05:21] wants me to feed him when me and my son
[1:05:24] are going to starve to death." That no
[1:05:27] good preacher. I knew they were all like
[1:05:29] that.
[1:05:33] That's why I don't even go to church
[1:05:35] anymore cuz all the preachers are like
[1:05:37] that.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; But she had a revelation. See, the
[1:05:42] uncertainty was taken away. Was it
[1:05:44] Elijah that took her uncertainty away?
[1:05:47] No, it was the spirit. It was God
[1:05:49] speaking to her heart. Amen. So, it was
[1:05:52] there that God give to her an
[1:05:54] understanding. and she goes over there
[1:05:57] and she makes a cake for the prophet and
[1:06:00] presents it to him first. So many types
[1:06:02] that go with that. But you look at that,
[1:06:05] she followed what was spoken and instead
[1:06:08] of saying I he's got ulterior motives,
[1:06:10] he's greedy, he's selfish, he's that,
[1:06:12] she had a revelation. Something swept
[1:06:14] over her and she was like, you know
[1:06:16] what, I'm just going to obey this. I I
[1:06:19] just I just feel like I should do that.
[1:06:21] She gained a focus and as she so she
[1:06:24] makes that and now imagine my brother
[1:06:26] and sister how her life changed by just
[1:06:28] simply obeying those simple words and
[1:06:31] she made a cake for the prophet and then
[1:06:33] she goes back to the meal and she goes
[1:06:36] back to the oil and there's just as much
[1:06:39] in the vessel as there was when she made
[1:06:41] the cake. Amen. and she makes another
[1:06:44] cake maybe for her son first and she
[1:06:46] goes back to the meal and she goes back
[1:06:48] to the oil and the same thing is
[1:06:51] happening. Amen. Because God come and
[1:06:54] took away all the uncertainty. He took
[1:06:57] away all the anxiety. He took away all
[1:07:00] of the human thinking and she said, "I'm
[1:07:03] just going to follow what God is
[1:07:05] speaking to me." She doesn't declare,
[1:07:07] "I'm going to follow this man Elijah."
[1:07:10] Oh,
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; she's following the leadership of the
[1:07:13] Holy Spirit.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; And she started to gain focus. And I'm
[1:07:19] telling you, my brother and sister, when
[1:07:20] the meal and the oil never failed, she
[1:07:23] was there day by day, just as you will,
[1:07:26] if you trust God the same. That
[1:07:29] confidence in God's word was reinforced.
[1:07:32] Not every month, but every single meal
[1:07:35] of every single day, God come down and
[1:07:38] said, "I'm going to remind you and I'm
[1:07:40] going to reinforce to you that in this
[1:07:42] time of uncertainty, a drought on the
[1:07:44] land, the animals are dying, people are
[1:07:47] dying, but she's going back and the meal
[1:07:50] and the oil was there, a constant factor
[1:07:53] in her life because God takes care of
[1:07:55] his own."
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God said, "I'll never leave
[1:07:59] you or fail you or walk away from you,
[1:08:01] abandon you." He said, "I'll be with
[1:08:04] you."
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; In this time of increased uncertainty,
[1:08:10] people are baffled and perplexed
[1:08:13] and humanity is embracing
[1:08:16] its own version of right and wrong.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; my brother and sister. You think about
[1:08:22] it. The scripture says that there would
[1:08:24] come a day that they would say that good
[1:08:26] was evil and evil was good. So it's men
[1:08:29] actually you say, "Oh, oh, oh, this is a
[1:08:32] devil." The people had to let the devil
[1:08:33] in.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Right? Because you can resist the devil
[1:08:37] and he will flee.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; So it's actually the people and their
[1:08:41] way of approaching it said, "You know
[1:08:43] what? This makes sense to me. I'm just
[1:08:45] going to reason this out." Yeah,
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; I think I think what I'm doing is just
[1:08:53] fine.
[1:08:55] Have any of us ever thought that
[1:08:59] what I'm doing right now is just fine
[1:09:06] and how wrong we can be.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, your word says that you'd guide my
[1:09:14] footsteps.
[1:09:17] And this August, is it 17th?
[1:09:20] We need him to guide our footsteps.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; If ever there was a time in our life, we
[1:09:25] need God to guide our footsteps. This is
[1:09:28] the time.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; And mankind embraces their view above
[1:09:36] the word of God. So, you know, there
[1:09:38] there's kind of a little bit u of an
[1:09:41] argument around, you know, the the
[1:09:43] countryside, you might say, and some
[1:09:46] people say, well, praise God. Uh, the
[1:09:49] message is the absolute.
[1:09:53] But just listening the other day,
[1:09:55] Brother Brandham says the Bible
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; is the absolute.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Now, let's stop here. I don't want to
[1:10:02] confuse anybody. I'm not trying to draw
[1:10:03] lines or cause warfare.
[1:10:06] But if you're taking the message as in
[1:10:08] the printed page
[1:10:10] and the Bible as the printed page, which
[1:10:13] one are you going to stand with?
[1:10:19] Is there separation?
[1:10:21] Is there a difference?
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; If you understand it, interpret it
[1:10:28] correctly,
[1:10:30] no difference. Sorry.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; But we can lean to our own understanding
[1:10:37] and we'll slowly
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; start to drift
[1:10:41] to where this is what we need. We don't
[1:10:43] need that.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; But find balance because you don't want
[1:10:47] to be over here saying this is what I
[1:10:49] need and I don't need that cuz we didn't
[1:10:51] understand this until that came. Amen.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; See, so God's not telling us that, you
[1:10:58] know, you got to you got to just uh wipe
[1:11:00] away everything here.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Question and answers.
[1:11:09] Brother Brandham, I'm paraphrasing this.
[1:11:11] Your ministries here,
[1:11:15] do we need preachers?
[1:11:20] Absolutely. The scripture says therefore
[1:11:23] the perfecting
[1:11:25] of the body of believers.
[1:11:28] You see, we got to just be careful. But
[1:11:30] you see, God has brought a clarity to us
[1:11:34] from the word that we could actually
[1:11:36] gain focus to realize that we, you know,
[1:11:40] I I'm tend to be uh, you know,
[1:11:43] secondhand vegetarian.
[1:11:46] You guys know what a secondhand
[1:11:47] vegetarian is?
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Confused. confused. No, actually,
[1:11:53] Brother Trevor, you're closer to
[1:11:54] secondhand vegetarian than you think.
[1:11:57] The cow eats the grass. We eat the cow.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; But we're not called to be secondhand
[1:12:08] believers.
[1:12:11] You've got to eat the book.
[1:12:14] When John is there and the word said,
[1:12:15] "Eat the book." It will be sweet in your
[1:12:19] mouth and bitter in your belly. You're
[1:12:21] not called to take someone else's. Yep.
[1:12:24] I ate the book. It was sweet in my
[1:12:26] mouth. It was bitter in my belly. Now,
[1:12:28] depending on how your constitution is,
[1:12:30] whether you can handle this bitter in
[1:12:32] your belly part, maybe don't eat it
[1:12:34] because I'll tell you what it is. That's
[1:12:36] not what the word said. The word said
[1:12:38] you have to take the book and you have
[1:12:41] to eat the book and it's going to be
[1:12:44] sweet in your mouth and bitter in your
[1:12:47] belly. Why would it be bitter in your
[1:12:48] belly? Because it's going to cause your
[1:12:50] flesh to conform to the word.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Who wants their flesh to conform to the
[1:12:56] word?
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want my flesh to control
[1:13:00] my life. I want the word of God to
[1:13:02] control my life. I want the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:05] Amen. in Revelations 2 and 3. Amen. What
[1:13:08] the spirit saith unto the churches, I am
[1:13:12] the church in this hour. You are the
[1:13:15] church in this hour. Don't look back
[1:13:17] through history and think, oh, they were
[1:13:19] some special people. If you were moved
[1:13:21] through time and was at Ephesus, you
[1:13:24] because you are a seed of God would be
[1:13:26] right there saying amen to the word. But
[1:13:28] in that day they had to eat the book and
[1:13:31] it was bitter in their belly and they
[1:13:33] made sacrifice of their own life to
[1:13:36] receive the word. Are you with me?
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it will not be that we will
[1:13:42] walk on flowery beds of ease that God's
[1:13:45] just going to make it all some
[1:13:46] intellectual concept that we can say,
[1:13:48] "Oh, that's it." And we're saved. My
[1:13:50] brother and sister, you're going to eat
[1:13:52] the book. I'm going to eat the book.
[1:13:54] It's going to be sweet in our mouth. And
[1:13:56] I say it is sweet in our mouth. And it's
[1:13:58] going to be bitter in our belly cuz this
[1:14:00] flesh is waring against the spirit.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it will war against the spirit
[1:14:06] every day of your life until the Lord
[1:14:08] takes you home. But you're more than a
[1:14:11] conqueror. Amen. This flesh is not going
[1:14:14] to defeat the Holy Spirit that called
[1:14:17] you from before the foundation of the
[1:14:19] world.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of God in you is
[1:14:23] invincible.
[1:14:31] Proverbs 21. Got to love these things
[1:14:34] out of the book of Proverbs.
[1:14:36] Proverbs 21 and2. Every man, every way
[1:14:39] of a man is right in his own eyes, but
[1:14:41] the Lord ponderth the heart.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:14:48] maybe I'll just skip over that part.
[1:14:51] Amen. And in the message, look, just
[1:14:56] drawing a little out of this. It says
[1:14:59] here, what are you looking at? You say,
[1:15:01] "Oh, I belong to the Assemblies of God.
[1:15:04] I belong to the United Pentecostal. I
[1:15:06] belong to the meth Methodist, the
[1:15:07] Baptist." You're still focusing yourself
[1:15:10] away.
[1:15:13] Focus yourself on Jesus Christ.
[1:15:17] Yeah.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just apply this in a very
[1:15:20] straightforward and blunt method. If you
[1:15:23] think the answer is is because you
[1:15:25] believe the message of this day, that
[1:15:27] that's your answer, my brother and
[1:15:29] sister, you've missed the mark.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; I don't care what name we hang over this
[1:15:33] door. I don't care what schooling you
[1:15:35] might see and teaching we've had. The
[1:15:38] whole reason that we're here and the
[1:15:40] whole reason that God has opened up this
[1:15:43] word in this hour was to introduce you
[1:15:45] and I to Jesus Christ.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our relationship is not with a
[1:15:50] man. It's not with a church. It's not
[1:15:52] with some educator. It's not with some
[1:15:54] theologian. It is with Jesus Christ. And
[1:15:57] anything outside of Jesus Christ is
[1:16:00] going to be lost.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Pretty blunt,
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; but it's true.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:07] Focus yourself in on Jesus Christ. Hear
[1:16:11] and the answer come back.
[1:16:14] All thy sins which are many are all
[1:16:17] forgiven.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; focusing on the right thing.
[1:16:24] What does it do? It gets rid of all the
[1:16:27] uncertainty. When we have that
[1:16:29] relationship,
[1:16:32] people say, "Praise God, I got so filled
[1:16:34] full of God, I don't need to go to
[1:16:35] church anymore." But that's not what his
[1:16:36] word said.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Actually, let me put my own
[1:16:40] interpretation on that. If you've got
[1:16:42] the Holy Ghost,
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; you can't wait to go to the house of
[1:16:48] God.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz you want to hear brother Paul
[1:16:52] preach.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Because God promised he would meet you
[1:16:57] here. Wow.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Now, imagine, let's just go back uh for
[1:17:01] for
[1:17:03] Jerry and I, it'd be quite a few years,
[1:17:05] but you know, you go back and there's a
[1:17:08] young man or a young woman that you
[1:17:09] really like, and you know, you you tell
[1:17:12] her, "Look, um, I'll meet you at Dairy
[1:17:14] Queen 5:00."
[1:17:18] She shows up at Dairy Queen and
[1:17:21] you never show up.
[1:17:26] The next time
[1:17:29] you say, "Hey, meet me at Dairy Queen."
[1:17:32] She's going to be skeptical.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; And you don't show up.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; You'll be really lucky if there's a
[1:17:42] third time, man.
[1:17:45] Either that or she's Oh, can I say this
[1:17:48] a little humor? She's desperate.
[1:17:54] And people say, "I went to the house of
[1:17:55] God and God never met me there."
[1:17:58] Are you sure you showed up at the right
[1:18:00] place?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Because he said he would be where two or
[1:18:05] three are gathered together.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; That's not if the circumstances
[1:18:10] work out.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; That's as sure as him paying for our sin
[1:18:17] with his own precious blood.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Expectations. wonderful sermon. I come
[1:18:25] expecting I never fail to meet him here.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Not this building, not these walls, but
[1:18:31] in the promise that he gave that if you
[1:18:35] would go and you would be there, I'll
[1:18:38] meet you in there.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, we got to get away from
[1:18:42] all of these distractions and get down
[1:18:45] to a certainty. Well, I can meet God
[1:18:47] anywhere. I had a friend, unfortunately,
[1:18:48] he doesn't even serve God today, but he
[1:18:50] used to tell me, he says, "Oh, Paul,
[1:18:52] it's no big deal. I can just go up on
[1:18:54] the mountain and meet God up on the
[1:18:56] mountain." But if God's down in the
[1:18:58] valley
[1:19:00] and you're on the mountain, are you
[1:19:02] meeting him
[1:19:05] and you say, "Meet me, young lady, at Mc
[1:19:08] at Dairy Queen." And then he goes to
[1:19:10] McDonald's,
[1:19:12] you're going to have a tough time
[1:19:14] reconciling that relationship. Cuz the
[1:19:17] difference between a, you know, a
[1:19:19] Wendy's burger and McDonald's burger is
[1:19:21] enough to ruin any relationship.
[1:19:24] Excuse me. I couldn't resist that.
[1:19:28] So, look at this. I'm sorry. I I
[1:19:30] shouldn't be trying to be a comedian.
[1:19:34] But let's not get caught in this same
[1:19:35] mindset today. Let's not get caught in
[1:19:38] this thing that, you know, God's
[1:19:40] obligated to meet me where I want to
[1:19:42] meet.
[1:19:44] But let's get this and get the
[1:19:45] uncertainty out of our mind that God
[1:19:48] said, "I've got a chosen place of
[1:19:50] worship. I said where I would meet you
[1:19:52] and it's not going to be out here and
[1:19:55] it's not going to be out here, but I'm
[1:19:57] going to meet you in my word."
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to meet you in there. So
[1:20:01] now look at this. Now remember there's
[1:20:03] this time this story the quotation about
[1:20:06] uh uh brother Brown speaking to a
[1:20:08] Catholic priest and the Catholic priest
[1:20:11] being well schooled sincere
[1:20:15] followed what the church had taught him
[1:20:18] and said you know what um
[1:20:22] going to
[1:20:24] you know the Catholic church is the
[1:20:26] answer basically it's what's going to
[1:20:28] judge the world now brother Brandham in
[1:20:31] this conversation says, "Okay, um,
[1:20:35] if you're going to the world's going to
[1:20:36] be judged by the church, which form of
[1:20:39] the Catholic Church,
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; the Roman Catholic or the Orthodox?
[1:20:44] Which one of those is it going to be?"
[1:20:48] And so, you see, my brother and sister,
[1:20:49] if we're sitting here looking now, which
[1:20:51] version of the church, I'm going to
[1:20:53] bring this a little more home. I hope
[1:20:54] you don't mind. It's kind of personal to
[1:20:56] drive it home like this, but which
[1:20:58] version of the message?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:01] We got a version of the church. Now,
[1:21:03] what version of the message?
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; We got a lot of versions.
[1:21:08] I'm telling you, every time, I don't
[1:21:10] know why this is in my brain, but not
[1:21:12] that I go that often, but every time I
[1:21:14] go to Stella's, I walk in there and I
[1:21:15] think, "Yep, this is just about like the
[1:21:17] world we live in." You got Who wants
[1:21:20] pistachio butternut cookie cream or
[1:21:23] something? Who invented that? Don't
[1:21:25] raise your hand.
[1:21:28] But somebody must like it.
[1:21:32] Now me, I'm boring. You guys know that.
[1:21:34] I don't have to tell you. I walk in
[1:21:36] there and it's like chocolate chip,
[1:21:38] mint, or vanilla.
[1:21:41] Which one?
[1:21:44] Some of you guys got an eyebrow lifted
[1:21:46] up so far. You're just like, "What?"
[1:21:51] Cookie dough.
[1:21:54] I like my cookie dough put in the oven
[1:21:56] at 3:25.
[1:21:58] Not in a bowl.
[1:22:03] So who are we going to judge this by?
[1:22:06] Your flavor
[1:22:09] or my flavor?
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Your understanding or my understanding?
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says neither.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; It's going to be judged by the word.
[1:22:23] There we have a constant we can hold on
[1:22:25] to in good days and bad days in the in
[1:22:28] the monsoon and in the drought we can
[1:22:30] hold on to that. Amen. So you know what
[1:22:33] the problem is with that is every
[1:22:36] version believes everyone who doesn't
[1:22:38] believe their version is wrong.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; But the scripture says it's of no
[1:22:43] private interpretation. So when I start
[1:22:46] to interpret the word to you and say
[1:22:47] this is what it means you need to be
[1:22:50] cautious. You need to stop and say,
[1:22:51] "Okay, where's he going with this?"
[1:22:53] Because it's no private interpretation.
[1:22:56] It doesn't matter what Paul Haley
[1:22:58] thinks. It's what the word says that
[1:23:01] matters. Amen. And when we can come back
[1:23:03] to a constant anchor of our soul, we can
[1:23:07] stand there and say, you know what, the
[1:23:09] wind blew me this way for a season of my
[1:23:12] life, and the wind blew me this way for
[1:23:14] a season of my life, but I'm anchored in
[1:23:16] the anchor. And whatever way that I get
[1:23:19] blown, I can't get too far away because
[1:23:21] I'm anchored.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; And when we have that, my brother and
[1:23:25] sister, God will always bring his bride
[1:23:27] right back. He'll let he'll let us drift
[1:23:30] a little bit. You realize how that
[1:23:32] works, right? If you've ever been on a
[1:23:34] reasonable size ship in deep water, they
[1:23:37] drop the anchor. When the wind blows
[1:23:39] from the north,
[1:23:41] you're at the south end of the anchor
[1:23:43] chain. And then the wind shifts and
[1:23:47] starts to turn and you'll find yourself,
[1:23:50] you're still at the end of the anchor,
[1:23:53] but you're no longer in the same
[1:23:55] position you was before.
[1:23:57] And even in the same storm, in the same
[1:24:00] 24 hours, you might make a complete 360
[1:24:03] circle, but as long as the anchor holds,
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; you are still there.
[1:24:11] You might have looked at that from here.
[1:24:13] Then you might be looking at it from
[1:24:15] here. And you might be looking at it
[1:24:17] from here. And you might be looking at
[1:24:19] it from here. But as long as the anchor
[1:24:22] holds, Amen. You might see things a
[1:24:25] little different when you're young. You
[1:24:26] might see a little different after
[1:24:28] you're married and starting to have
[1:24:29] children. You might see it a little
[1:24:30] different when you're middleaged. You
[1:24:32] might see it a little different when
[1:24:34] you're old. Amen. Just think about
[1:24:35] Brother Bob and Sister Joanne as it was
[1:24:38] coming to the end of their life. and to
[1:24:40] sit there and I had lovely conversations
[1:24:42] with them. Sister Joanne holding my
[1:24:44] hand, looking up, tears pouring out of
[1:24:46] her eyes. And she goes, "Brother Paul, I
[1:24:50] thought so.
[1:24:52] I thought serving the Lord was so
[1:24:54] precious when I was young,
[1:24:57] but it's so much more precious
[1:25:01] right now.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; And she's coming to the end of the
[1:25:06] life." Now, I want to know, how much do
[1:25:07] we as humans love life?
[1:25:12] Think about it. I'm not talking about,
[1:25:13] you know, the carnal side, but I'm just
[1:25:16] talking about humanity.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; We love life so much our bodies battered
[1:25:21] laying in a hospital fight to live.
[1:25:25] That's right.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; And they're like our sister Joanne,
[1:25:29] brother Bob, laying there right at the
[1:25:31] end of their life,
[1:25:34] literally coming, seeing the mist, the
[1:25:36] veil before them and saying, "This is
[1:25:39] the most precious moment I've ever
[1:25:42] experienced in my life."
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; You see, the word took all the
[1:25:49] uncertainty
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; away.
[1:25:53] No fear of tomorrow
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; because you know who holds tomorrow.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; And this is where it is. We don't have
[1:26:01] to be in that place cuz we're old.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can be in that place today.
[1:26:05] It's like, Lord, what do I do in my
[1:26:06] future? young lady when we were there in
[1:26:09] Belgium. Young lady, she come. It's a
[1:26:11] long story, but I'll just tell you, she
[1:26:13] was there and they were having prayer
[1:26:15] and and uh you know, it was interesting
[1:26:18] because there was a lot of young people
[1:26:20] up in the front and she was there and
[1:26:22] chairs pushed around and she was there
[1:26:25] and she was like, "Lord, I I don't know
[1:26:28] what my future holds." She had just
[1:26:29] finished her university studies and the
[1:26:32] area she was from. There's really was no
[1:26:34] church. A and she was wondering, do I go
[1:26:37] back there? That's where my family's at.
[1:26:39] Uh, you know, the church was there is a
[1:26:42] little bit cold and formal. Do I go
[1:26:44] here? Do I go there? Lord, I need some
[1:26:46] direction. I It could be. Now, she
[1:26:48] wasn't looking at Paul as though Paul
[1:26:50] was somebody special, but God had
[1:26:52] touched her heart and we're there. And
[1:26:53] she's like, "If brother Paul would just
[1:26:55] come and pray for me, Lord, I would feel
[1:26:57] like my future would be clear. It would
[1:26:59] be settled. I might not know exactly
[1:27:01] what to do, but I would come and I would
[1:27:04] know that you were guiding my future."
[1:27:06] And, you know, as I was going through
[1:27:08] the chairs, praying for young people,
[1:27:10] and there was a big mass of chairs, and
[1:27:12] I skirted around her, and I went on down
[1:27:15] the line, as it were, and and just was
[1:27:17] praying for other young people. got all
[1:27:19] the way over in the other side of this
[1:27:21] uh little uh uh amphitheater building a
[1:27:24] and uh prayed for some young people over
[1:27:26] there. Some indifferent young ladies
[1:27:28] that sat through the whole youth
[1:27:30] service. You wonder why did you pay
[1:27:32] money and travel to come here to set in
[1:27:34] a service the whole time
[1:27:38] to see them on their faces crying out to
[1:27:40] God,
[1:27:42] Lord, forgive me.
[1:27:46] We prayed with them and as I started to
[1:27:48] go back something caught my attention
[1:27:51] and I thought I did not pay pray for
[1:27:53] that young sister
[1:27:56] and something with such a strong urge I
[1:27:59] just started pushing the chairs. She
[1:28:02] literally they'd push the chairs around
[1:28:03] so much it was like a barrier around
[1:28:05] her. I just started pushing the chairs
[1:28:06] out of the way. I finally got out there,
[1:28:08] reached over some chairs, laid my hand
[1:28:10] upon her shoulder and I said, "Lord, out
[1:28:13] loud." I didn't know what I was praying.
[1:28:15] I'm talking about God coming to take
[1:28:18] away the uncertainty of the day that we
[1:28:20] live in. And I had no idea this young
[1:28:23] lady. I don't know what country was
[1:28:25] from, what name she had, what her life
[1:28:28] experience was. I just reached over that
[1:28:30] chair as it were. And I just laid my
[1:28:32] fingers on her shoulder and I said,
[1:28:35] "Lord, let our dear little sister know
[1:28:38] that the way before her is clear."
[1:28:42] exactly what she was thinking, exactly
[1:28:45] what she needed from the Lord. And I
[1:28:48] know this because when it was all over,
[1:28:50] the next day she come and says, "Can I
[1:28:52] talk to you?" And she started pouring
[1:28:54] her heart out. My brother and sister, I
[1:28:56] had no idea to pray that the word, Amen,
[1:28:59] that her life would be clear before her,
[1:29:01] that you would guide it. But God knew
[1:29:03] and he wanted to take the uncertainty
[1:29:06] away from that young lady. And God's
[1:29:08] here this morning to take the
[1:29:10] uncertainty away from you and I. Is this
[1:29:13] word of God in this hour true or is it
[1:29:16] not? Amen. He says it's true. The word's
[1:29:19] vindicated that it is true. This is the
[1:29:23] word for the hour. And God wants to
[1:29:25] confirm to you and take your uncertainty
[1:29:29] away from you. What about this doctrine?
[1:29:31] What about that doctrine? Forget about
[1:29:33] the doctrines. God will straighten your
[1:29:35] doctrine out. Amen. If you're a son or
[1:29:37] daughter of God, God will come and put
[1:29:40] you on the right path. But what you got
[1:29:42] to do is be submitted to him first
[1:29:45] because he'll say, "I want you to walk
[1:29:46] over here." And we'll say, "I want to
[1:29:48] walk over there."
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; But he's here saying, "Look, if you'll
[1:29:52] just trust me, I can take away all of
[1:29:55] your uncertainty.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; I can prove to you that I'm here with
[1:30:01] you today and I'm leading you and I'm
[1:30:04] guiding you." People get so caught up. I
[1:30:07] I don't know about this. I don't know
[1:30:09] about that. I didn't see it. And I don't
[1:30:11] understand this the same way. My brother
[1:30:14] and sister, why don't you set that to
[1:30:15] the side? Cuz the God that saved your
[1:30:18] soul, let me put it this way, the God
[1:30:20] that created your soul, that saved your
[1:30:22] soul, can certainly give you the truth
[1:30:26] to take that soul into eternity.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not about what I'm thinking,
[1:30:31] not about what you're thinking. It's
[1:30:33] about what God is thinking.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; let me just
[1:30:44] move right along.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; You know, it's funny. When you're
[1:30:47] studying, you think, "Ah, I don't even
[1:30:49] know if I've got enough to get through
[1:30:50] the service." Then you get up here and
[1:30:53] it somehow unzips itself and you're
[1:30:55] like, "Wow,
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; the Lord."
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I barely scratched this thing and
[1:31:00] time's up. Amen.
[1:31:04] You see, let me go ahead and just read
[1:31:06] this out of Ephesians the 2 chapter
[1:31:09] verses 4-10.
[1:31:12] But God who is rich in mercy for his
[1:31:14] great love wherewith he loved us. Can
[1:31:17] someone say amen to that?
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Oh man, he has showed us how much he
[1:31:21] loves us.
[1:31:23] Even when we were dead in sins, hath
[1:31:25] quickened us together with Christ. By
[1:31:27] grace ye are saved. He has raised us up
[1:31:30] together and made us sit together in
[1:31:33] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Now
[1:31:36] look at this. Some people unfortunately
[1:31:37] there's some theology out here you know
[1:31:40] that God is a taskmaster and people are
[1:31:42] like be careful you know you got to this
[1:31:44] and got to do that. My brother and
[1:31:46] sister when it said he made us to sit
[1:31:48] together in heavenly places God didn't
[1:31:50] do that by force.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; God didn't grab you and force you to go
[1:31:54] over here and to walk and sit in
[1:31:56] heavenly places. God started moving in
[1:31:59] the heart,
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; started moving in the soul. And it's
[1:32:03] actually the Holy Spirit that's doing
[1:32:06] the moving. It's the Holy Spirit that's
[1:32:09] causing us
[1:32:12] the uncction.
[1:32:14] Pardon me for using an example, but that
[1:32:16] young lady standing the chair is just
[1:32:17] one young lady.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Just one young lady. There's hundreds
[1:32:22] there.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. I had already prayed for I
[1:32:25] don't know probably a good quarter of
[1:32:28] the young people that was there probably
[1:32:30] already prayed for a hundred people my
[1:32:31] own self there and I'm walking back
[1:32:34] across the the the the chairs you know
[1:32:37] it was bleachers coming down and chairs
[1:32:38] in front and I was walking back across
[1:32:40] there and something says you didn't pray
[1:32:43] for her
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; three or four steps later something says
[1:32:51] go pray for her. That's right.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; This is the kind of moving that the word
[1:32:56] is talking about. God's going to move
[1:32:59] us, my brother and sister. Now, imagine,
[1:33:01] I've seen this happen, so don't don't
[1:33:03] take it too humorous, and I certainly
[1:33:05] wouldn't act this out because I wouldn't
[1:33:07] be wrong. But, you know, I'm not going
[1:33:09] to come down here and throw my arm
[1:33:10] around this sister's head and say, "I
[1:33:12] think you got to go to the altar and
[1:33:14] drag her up here now. I think you need
[1:33:17] to pray through."
[1:33:20] It happens.
[1:33:24] But that's not what the Holy Spirit
[1:33:25] does. He just comes right down here and
[1:33:28] he just starts moving in our life.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; We're a little bit Is it okay to use the
[1:33:35] word depressed amongst Christians?
[1:33:39] Some people act like you're claiming it.
[1:33:42] But you might be just a little
[1:33:43] depressed.
[1:33:46] And you pick up your Bible.
[1:33:49] I don't know about you, but this happens
[1:33:50] to me.
[1:33:52] I pick up my Bible. I start reading.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; What do I got to complain about? Thank
[1:34:04] you, Lord.
[1:34:06] Thank you, Lord, for your mercy on me.
[1:34:09] All depression. Holy Spirit. Did the
[1:34:12] Lord come in and say, "I'm going to kick
[1:34:13] that spirit of depression out." No. He
[1:34:15] just sent his word.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; He sent his word. He That's what he's
[1:34:20] doing. He's sending his word to us.
[1:34:22] That's what's moving us from the old man
[1:34:25] that was in that cycle
[1:34:27] is his word.
[1:34:31] Will we take the medicine?
[1:34:34] Are we happy where we're at?
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Well, praise God.
[1:34:43] I don't like taking medicine.
[1:34:46] I don't like being depressed.
[1:34:51] We're not talking about Xanax.
[1:34:54] We're talking about the word of God.
[1:34:57] But have you ever noticed how hard Satan
[1:35:00] fights you to keep you from reading your
[1:35:04] Bible?
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Phone rings. You just remember the 42
[1:35:12] things that you haven't done for six
[1:35:14] months, but suddenly it's desperate in
[1:35:16] need of.
[1:35:19] Come on. Am I telling the truth?
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; What is it doing? God is coming and he
[1:35:25] is removing
[1:35:28] the uncertainty,
[1:35:30] shifting the focus back to his word.
[1:35:34] He says, "Read my word.
[1:35:37] I know you got schoolwork.
[1:35:40] I know you need to go to bed because you
[1:35:41] got to get up and work hard tomorrow.
[1:35:44] Just read my word.
[1:35:48] No, you don't need to call that person
[1:35:49] that you've ignored their call for six
[1:35:51] months now. Read my word.
[1:35:54] And Satan's there. Oh, got a priority.
[1:35:56] Got a priority. I got to do this. Got to
[1:35:58] do that.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; What God is trying to do is bring us
[1:36:03] where we're focused on his word.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that will take away your
[1:36:09] anxiety. That will take away your fears.
[1:36:12] It will take away everything you have
[1:36:15] that's currently hindering your life.
[1:36:18] And that applies from right here in the
[1:36:20] pulpit to the very back of the building.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; That God wants to take away our
[1:36:25] uncertainty.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll just save I'll just save uh
[1:36:32] some of this. Um you could read it. I'll
[1:36:36] I'll preach on it, but you can read in
[1:36:37] Habac the 2 chapter verses 1 through3.
[1:36:41] Uh do we got a moment? Can I just read
[1:36:43] it?
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Habac 2 1-3. I will stand upon my watch
[1:36:49] and I will set thee upon the tower and
[1:36:52] will watch the sea that he will say unto
[1:36:54] me, what shall I answer when I am
[1:36:56] reproved? And the Lord answered me and
[1:36:58] said, "Write the vision. Make it plain
[1:37:02] upon the tables that he may run that
[1:37:06] readth it." Now, how is that person ever
[1:37:09] going to run if they never read it?
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; So, God wants them to read the prophecy.
[1:37:15] Amen. They wants them to see this vision
[1:37:19] laid out before them. And when they read
[1:37:21] it, there's such power, such inspiration
[1:37:25] in that vision that they will run.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my. For the vision is yet for an
[1:37:32] appointed time, but at the end it shall
[1:37:34] speak and not lie. Though it tar, wait
[1:37:37] for it, because it will surely come. It
[1:37:40] will not tarry. My brother and sister,
[1:37:42] it all comes back. We got to read it. We
[1:37:46] got to be a partaker of it
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; and it will change our lives.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Brother David, would you come? Amen.
[1:37:54] I've got quite a bit more here. Amen.
[1:37:57] Some stuff I think's really good,
[1:38:00] but Amen.
[1:38:04] One last. The rapture 65. this rapture
[1:38:08] which is coming to pass and anything
[1:38:11] that God has in the line of his word,
[1:38:13] there's always something to come out to
[1:38:15] upset that if it can. It's Satan's
[1:38:19] purpose to do that. You ever notice
[1:38:23] right after services, church, personal
[1:38:26] time, God really blesses you,
[1:38:29] Satan appears right on the heels of
[1:38:31] that, doing everything he can to upset
[1:38:35] you.
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:40] Praise God. I'm delivered from my
[1:38:41] temper. The very next day, 42 cars cut
[1:38:45] you off in traffic
[1:38:49] and you didn't overcome 42 times
[1:38:54] and you're like, "Oh Lord, I guess I
[1:38:55] wasn't delivered." No, you were
[1:38:57] delivered.
[1:38:58] The devil is there trying to cause you
[1:39:02] to let go of what you were delivered.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's what Satan's trying to do.
[1:39:07] He's trying to upset you to where you
[1:39:08] step back and say, "Okay, Satan, let's
[1:39:11] have a truce. You don't bother me. I
[1:39:13] won't bother you." But you can't say
[1:39:16] that you're victorious and an overcomer
[1:39:18] and have a truce with the devil. Amen.
[1:39:22] You are called to be victorious.
[1:39:25] Hallelujah.
[1:39:27] Oh my. So much good stuff here. Amen.
[1:39:32] Well, I, you know, just not used to not
[1:39:35] having the song program. Let's just
[1:39:38] stand and sing a couple songs before we
[1:39:40] dismiss.
[1:39:42] I pray that something was said today
[1:39:44] might be a little encouragement to you
[1:39:47] that to remember see that in this age of
[1:39:51] uncertainty God is going to not we're
[1:39:54] not hoping he will but God is going to
[1:39:57] give you something an absolute that you
[1:40:01] can hold on to that you can stop with
[1:40:04] this uncertainty am I or am I not this
[1:40:08] is not like a little girl out in the out
[1:40:10] in the yard with the clover. He loves
[1:40:13] me. He loves me not. Maybe boys do that,
[1:40:17] too. I don't know. He loves me. He loves
[1:40:20] me not. He loves me. He loves me not. He
[1:40:22] loves me. He loves me not. Get another
[1:40:23] one.
[1:40:26] No, this is us with a certainty.
[1:40:29] He said he loves me.

[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Above all, do you know that song,
[1:42:58] Brother David?
[1:43:00] start singing it rather will you?
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Well, that won't work. Let's see.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know, I think we've become
[1:43:09] too dependent on that screen right
[1:43:11] there.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; That's true. I think you're
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; we don't even have a song book in in the
[1:43:15] whole sanctuary here. I think maybe it's
[1:43:18] time to reestablish the song book. At
[1:43:21] least we
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; above all see
[1:43:24] above all nature
[1:43:29] above all
[1:43:33] above all
[1:43:36] and
[1:43:40] above all
[1:43:43] and all the roots of men.
[1:43:49] Mhm.
[1:43:52] Oh my.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'll have to learn it,
[1:43:54] brother. I'm Praise the Lord. I should
[1:43:56] know.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; This is why some brothers are called to
[1:43:59] be song leaders.
[1:44:02] Have you ever noticed just like the
[1:44:03] other day,
[1:44:05] Brother Alex comes up right there at the
[1:44:08] end of service, maybe never even
[1:44:10] noticed, you're so used to it, but he
[1:44:12] stepped right up here and
[1:44:14] just the right song. just got a hold of
[1:44:17] the atmosphere in the church and just
[1:44:20] carried it right on out. Just the right
[1:44:22] song. That's a man that's called to lead
[1:44:25] songs. Have you ever noticed very few
[1:44:27] preachers make good song leaders?
[1:44:31] It's not what they're called to do.
[1:44:33] That's right.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's guys that are called to
[1:44:36] shovel a ditch and there's guys that are
[1:44:38] called to drive the tractor that shovels
[1:44:40] the ditch. Quite a bit of difference
[1:44:42] there. Amen. Isn't that right, Brother
[1:44:43] Cody? Yeah. Amen. I was called to be a
[1:44:46] tractor driver. Amen. Oh, let me find
[1:44:50] this song here real quick. Above all,
[1:44:54] than here. Praise God.
[1:45:01] Well, it's not even in my song book.
[1:45:06] Oh my. Oh my.
[1:45:10] Oh my. Oh my. Saints, I hope you can
[1:45:14] forgive me.
[1:45:17] Hallelujah. All to Jesus I surrender.
[1:45:20] Amen. We should read it again.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; To Jesus.
[1:45:28] I surrender
[1:45:31] all.

[1:52:00] their resting place in the heart of your
[1:52:03] believers. Lord, speak to them, Father.
[1:52:07] Encourage them, Lord. Remind us, Father,
[1:52:10] we're not a part of the chaos of this
[1:52:13] age, this world. We've been called far
[1:52:16] above it into heavenly places. And Lord,
[1:52:19] you've come to deliver us, Father,
[1:52:22] Lord, from all of the anxiety,
[1:52:25] all of the questions, Father. For,
[1:52:28] Father, when we recognize that you
[1:52:30] already have the answer, and you've
[1:52:33] already sent the answer on the way to
[1:52:35] us, and you've made your word a living
[1:52:37] word, Lord, a life-changing word. I pray
[1:52:42] father today that you bless each and
[1:52:44] everyone. Lord go with them, lead them,
[1:52:46] guide them father as we come back
[1:52:48] together on Wednesday. May, Father, we
[1:52:51] be able as we pick up and read the words
[1:52:55] written of the vision, Father, that it
[1:52:58] would bring life to us, bring joy to us,
[1:53:02] Father, Lord, healing,
[1:53:05] bring virtue to us, Father, Lord,
[1:53:09] restoration.
[1:53:10] Whatever we might need today, Father,
[1:53:13] it's there in the written words of the
[1:53:16] vision. We thank you, Father. I ask you
[1:53:19] to bless each and everyone today, their
[1:53:22] patience, Father, for us as we've
[1:53:23] labored, Lord. Just ask you to just
[1:53:26] bless them for it in the name of Jesus
[1:53:28] Christ. Amen.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
