for the service this morning the preaching of the word lord may you come father may i you move the pastor aside lord jesus father that the word of god could come forth uninhibited lord jesus by our feelings our preconceived ideas lord jesus father that we'd be open to whatever you would have to say to us this morning we thank you for your presence that is already here lord it is always we know it father to be true but it's always a wonderful thing to see your promises come to pass lord and your promise said where two or three are gathered in your name you would be here and father we now see the fulfillment of that promise this morning lord you have brought your word to pass you have vindicated it you have interpreted lord father now may we receive it this morning i ask we love you lord

may have your seats [Music] and i want to welcome everyone this morning those are joining us on the internet and god bless you and you just feel this presence as we were feeling his presence here this morning and then this morning i asked sister nadia if she would sing for us she sang that song lord i believe in you and i was thinking about that this morning and that's like that'd be a wonderful song to have some just create an atmosphere our lord would be pleased in amen [Applause] though i can't see [Music] it seems so far away [Music] i have a deep and a speaker of joy that makes my face to stand lord i believe in you i'll always believe in you though i can see you with my eyes deep in my heart your presence i find lord i believe in you and i'll keep my trust in you let this whole

believe lord i believe amen that's all he asked of us i believe amen as we get ready to turn the service to our pastor i have yet to master the verses yet but let's send the course let the worshipers arise amen key of g uh 1051. feel like standing and worshiping stand and worship amen let the worshipers arise let the sons and daughters i'm surrendering my all i surrender to the just surrendered her in this morning oh let the worshipers arise let the sons and daughters say where i surrendering my all i surrender to the king [Music] ring my all i surrendered to the king let the worshipers rise when the sons and daughters sing right surrendering my home put that first verse up brother alex if you would please [Music] think about the world we're living in we might not be able to sing this but look at those words right there father i see you see it's not the preacher it's not men i see you father drawing a line in the sand hallelujah now you think about that i'll get off my sermon this morning on this right here but you think about that line in the sand we think well some people will say well god's cutting some people out and some people in i'll tell you what he's doing my brother and sister people say well it's not fair it's not fair that god would save some and judge others do you realize if we got what was fair every one of us would go to hell this has nothing to do with fear this has to do with god's grace and i say thank you lord that your grace is sufficient and your grace chose me hallelujah otherwise there's none of us righteous none of us are holy but the line that he drew in the sand my brother and sister is also a two-way street you see it shows you what side you're on and it also showed the devil the line he can't cross amen we stay in the word we just stay in the presence of almighty god and his presence is with us amen see i want to be standing on your side lord and i want to be holding your hand lord so let your kingdom come well praise the lord his kingdom's coming regardless but i want it living in me i don't want to just talk about the kingdom of god has come we see the signs we see the evidence we see this here the prophet of god saying he is here some people are going no no that can't be if he's here he's off the mercy seat but go study the message the prophet of god said that god is on the mercy seat of the believer all the time hallelujah this is my prayer this is my plea good to be in the house of the lord today amen just uh i think you know there was something i told you i was trying to remember brother vasily i think back on the road let's just lift him up in prayer definitely a tough world out there amen um brother alex could you bring up the uh slide that i had some time back you probably almost forgot i forgot it but um the one that's got the three kinds of believers the little breakdown graph now saints i hope you this morning don't mind just kind of a tad bit of humor if we could ever i was watching some news online and if we could ever get that guy that was running around the uh congressional building with a buffalo head on we could ever get him converted he would change the worship in your church yeah for goodness sakes a man so uninhibited that he could run out in public with tattoos and paint in a buffalo head in his shorts and they call us crazy you can do anything in the name of the world and you're all right you do anything in the name of the lord and you're a radical boy i'll tell you what if this is not the word coming to pass when it said that they would call good evil and evil good oh look at the world we're living in but praise the lord it said when we saw that don't get all dejected and start looking down like oh what's wrong what's going to happen no look up your redemption is nigh hallelujah amen well thank you lord hallelujah thank you brother jason sister emmy amen very encouraging uh sister naughty i appreciated that i was so engrossed in my thoughts i never lifted a hand to even give praise to the lord and encouragement to you um but uh that is i love that song i believe amen hallelujah i've got nothing i've got nothing else to do but belief i i look in the world out here and i see all the chaos and oh wasn't it wonderful to receive a stimulus check amen deposited in your bank account you just contributed to the bankruptcy of the united states of america and we can say thank you lord because a prophet said that this nation would be completely broke and come to a place it must be bailed out and there would be only one to bala now look at this in this short course of years we absolutely double the national debt and yet there's a debt behind the debt that they don't tell us about and that is the one where they secured you that's right as the guarantor of the debt sounds very conspiratorial on saints when this breaks open sons and daughters of god i think will it'll break that last little veneer that we have when this breaks open and we will be there and see the absolute enormity of what god saved us from oh hallelujah i say i'ma let's lift our hands if you would amen just give a little thank you lord for your saving grace it's not just from our sin my brother and sister but it's from an insanity and god is saving us from an insanity hallelujah hallelujah so if you would let's see let's just go right here so you probably haven't seen this for a while because i've been focused mostly on this side of being sold out but instead of preaching this all the way through i've kind of reached a little point i want to come and instead of like i said the other day jumping all the way over to being sold out on lucifer's side i i'm going to kind of something i was just reading just part of my my devotions my bible that's by my chair there and and you know i just read along it takes me sometimes weeks to get through a single chapter and uh you know i was just reading the other day and so we're going to kind of have a a little thought today if it would be my brother and sister because while this is nothing special right when brother paul put this together it wasn't like some revelation came to me but i want you to look at that and i want you to realize how profound a little graph like this is that anyone could have created it's very profound because you see uh it is this absolute uh separation amen that brings a contrast in our lives it's the absolute separation that shows us that without god's grace in our life uh we actually would have get this now many of us would be saying no i'm lost i would have been lost i would have been lost but and i don't disagree with that but i want you to understand the most profound separation is not between here and here the most profound separation is is that we could have went all the years of our life believing we were serving god in a religious spirit only to wake up lost as we spoke to you the other day the rich ruler amen so the most profound so what we're going to do today by god's grace we're just going to kind of have a little blending here but i'm still can't quite get away from just preaching to the bride amen it's hard to get too excited about preaching about the lost amen if they want to get saved don't let anything hinder you give your heart to the lord don't hold back don't say well if i could see this if i could see that if lightning would strike only the tulips i i could believe no take the song sister nadia i believe just let your heart believe we were created to believe amen we were not created to to have a doubt or a fear of god that's satan's influence and that's why the world is going to be in such a profound agony when that anointing comes off and they realize how little it took for satan to deceive them that's going to be the people that are going to sign cry a nash gnashing of teeth see those that are sold out to the devil lucifer they're going to gnash their teeth because they're angry but there's going to be a lot of people who are in this middle ground their teeth are going to gnash to realize how little it took for satan you know america has such an issue right now we're going back and we're living history 300 years as it were ago and we're recriminating people you know the founding fathers of america they lived in their day just like we live in our day and imagined if the day would come that everything we've done would be looked in retrospect and someone would say see how evil they were how bad they were how unkind they were and i saw a deal the other day and this woman is talking about how that we should go to mount rushmore and blow the faces off the mountain because it's uh one domineering man and two slave owners on land that was stolen from the indians well the prophet of god even talks about how our nation didn't do right to our native americans right and we're going back and we're reliving uh what was slavery and all of this and it's interesting the narrative of all of this my brother and sister because you see what satan is doing i hope you catch this satan is doing is he he's not causing the people to look forward see that's what the true word of god preached to you will cause you to look forward you're not looking back to what you was but you're looking to what god said you are but look what satan's doing he's taking nations and causing them to look back amen and all that looking back does i don't care right in your own life now those of you that made mistakes that's right well do you bitter good to look back our hope is in the lord that is looking forward so what they're doing is they're looking back to our nation they were slaves and and they were this and they were that but you know let's study real history and we'll realize that all through the ages no matter what your color people were taken and sold as slaves think of the little jewish girl amen but god sent her there so that she could testify i would that my master would know that there is a god a prophet in israel would have been better if she'd never been taken prisoner and raised in her own household but you see my brother and sister we look forward lord thy will be done so i want to hurry up and get going here because we're getting started a little late and i'm a little slow but we're going to be kind of a blending of this today so amen if we'll just come i want to preach to you today this is a season um this is a time i mean i was looking at the screen here excuse me this is a time that we will live or die by the word test and we'll draw this out of uh judges the 12th chapter and uh in that my brother and sister we will then take these things and look at the word of god today so we just thank the lord for god's grace and mercy amen judges the 12th chapter starting with the first verse and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and went northward and said unto jephthah wherefore passes thou over to fight against the children of ammon and did us not call us to go with thee we will burn thy house upon thee with fire that sounds like some real friends isn't it you didn't invite us to the party so we're going to burn your house down i'm telling you i don't need friends like that amen this story goes much deeper and we'll touch on that in just a minute and jephthah said unto them i and my people were at great strife with the children of amen and when i called you you delivered me not out of their hands so really what we have saints here is a more of a jealousy issue because um the men of ephraim were actually afraid to go up against the people of amen and to them they wanted not just to go bail jephthah and the gideonites out they wanted a formal invitation that they might have been able to come and enjoyed all of the the pomp and circumstance of an alliance joining together but my brother and sister no matter what your battle is we're not here to create alliances that are outside of god's word god would rather you fought alone than to bind yourself to someone who proves to be a hindrance to you you can say but this person is my friend i enjoy this company on that are you uh fighting for exactly the same thing if you're not you'll find yourself actually unequally yoked hallelujah and so we look at this he says unto them i and my people are a great strife with the children of amen and when i called you you delivered me not out of their hands and when i saw that you delivered me not i put my life in my hands and passed over against the children of ammon and the lord delivered them into my hand now we'll touch in just a minute at the great cost that came for them being delivered into his hand wherefore then ye come up unto me this day to fight against me then jephthah gathered together all the men of gilead and fought with ephraim and the men of gilead smote ephraim because they said ye gileadites are fugitives of ephraim among the ephraimites and among the menacites and the gideonites took the passages of jordan before the ephraimites and it was so that when those ephemerites which were escaped said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him art thou and ephraimite if he said nay now i hope you can follow where we're coming i'm taking this context of scripture a word test then said they unto him say now should be left and he said sibyleth for he could not frame to pronounce it right then they took him and slew him at the passages of jordan and there fell at that time of the ephemites forty and two thousand you see it was a word test heavenly father we just ask you lord for your blessings upon the service today lead us guide us father be in full control we ask in your name amen you may be seated now we look here at this great conflict that took place and i think my brother and sister if we would just look at a little human element we would find that probably jephthah was not uh in a frame of mind to to play games with these people because while they kind of claimed to be their brothers or part of you know a a relationship there uh they were simply in something for themselves and if we'll just uh if you would just uh you got your bibles open still just go back to the 11th chapter and you'll find the backstory or the history of what is happening here and as jephthah is fighting against amenites coming down that the battle is very sore and he he raises up into a position that he says lord if you will let me uh be victorious in this battle then lord whatever it is that i see when i come to my home i will offer that up to you as a sacrifice all my brother and sister the lord comes on the scene so you know god heard that prayer the lord comes on the scene gives them the victory but yet when he goes back to his house the very first thing he sees is his precious daughter and she comes running out to him and she can't understand why her her father's countenance is fallen and he is distressed and she presses him to know why and he shares that now this little girl doesn't speak words like father you've betrayed me and how could you do this to me but she understands and so she's there and uh you know the agreement they make is that she would be able to go with her friends and bewail her virginity now some people reading that carnally it's interesting when you you uh read these kind of things that the interpretation that people put to the scripture but in this my brother and sister her bewailing her virginity was her looking on into life and she was bewailing the fact that she would never have a husband she would never bear a child she would never be a mother she would never get to raise that child and she goes and she spends a time and she comes back and she offers herself back to her father to jephthah and jephthah breaks the law amen for there was a law in israel that absolutely forbade you to offer your child as a sacrifice there was a religious faction in israel at that time malek and those that were in that that would offer children probably not their own children it's okay to offer your children but not mine they would offer children as sacrifices believing they were pleasing god brother branham talks about that taking place in africa people have birthing a child and believing they were pleasing god take that child to the riverbank and feed it to the crocodiles to spirit spirits don't die but spirits take on religious connotations and we'll find people that through their lifestyle and the beliefs that they embrace that are contrary to the word of god would offer their children up as a sacrifice in the day that we live in are you with me amen offer their children up as a sacrifice even though they don't go physically take their life they've offered them up into a secularism they've offered them up into a watered-down religion mom and dad don't want to conform to the word of god so they just pass that right on to their children and wonder why their children end up being a product of laodicea amen so the spirit is still here hallelujah my brother and sister this is why we as parents amen as ministry of a church ought to stand strong on the word not compromise for nothing amen you know often times even our own children many years ago would made little statements like well so-and-so gets to do that well good we're not so and so amen and you're not so-and-so's children hallelujah so we want to stand strong on the word parents we're not here to offer our children up as some kind of sacrifice but i want to display this before we go on you know for many years i've spoke to you just a little phraseology you might say that the vow is greater than the law and i take that out of this scripture right here because god honoring jeff this vow even though jephthah broke the law are you with me you don't find god repudiating jephthah for breaking the law god actually honors him for keeping his vow my brother and sister we make a vow to the lord jesus christ we should do everything within our ability to keep that vow and i'm telling you that vow has great value amen that vow is is so incredible my brother and sister you might say well it might put me at odds with the with the old testament law keep the vow hallelujah amen so you look at this great conflict that's coming and and jephthah battles the ammonites and god comes down and he makes this vow to the lord and and that moves on now ephraim comes and says you know what we've got a grudge to settle with you uh because you didn't let us actually share in this defeating of the ammonites it's just gideonites all the community the newspaper the evening news is all talking about the how the ephermites went over there and beat the ammonites and if you had given us our part our name would also be in there and so there's a little grudge that they have a little struggle that they they have there and you know what happens is is when this comes and and this behavior now my brother and sister you know uh uh pardon me for putting it this way but you know people are like well you know what you know brother branham said we should no matter what you know be brothers and sisters and i would say amen to that amen but you know what i'm going to come burn your house down and you still got to be my brother that's not my brother and sister what a prophet of god was talking about that's not what the word of god's talking about that i can treat you terrible but you must treat me nice my brother and sister now it might be good for our character hallelujah but remember i don't remember who said this tozer or spurgeon you know said be careful how you let people treat you you are training them and we ought to come to the place that while we can love someone are you with me and still vehemently disagree with them and have the courage enough to say what you're doing is wrong you cannot come and disrespect brothers and sisters in christ and then turn the word around and say but you gotta love me anyhow you see the whole foundation they're building that on is incorrect now we should as sons and daughters of god be able to say lord forgive them lord help me amen i don't want to be influenced by this and end up with an attitude i don't want to do this but you see somewhere along the line someone's going to have the courage to tell these people you can't have it your way and god's way at the same time unless your way is god's way and so it's there in this battle of the ephraimites they come and you know they decide we're we're going to prove the point that you know uh uh uh the gideonites beat the ammonites so we're going to beat the giddy knights and then we can tell the whole world we're the best hallelujah in modern times that might be our church is having a bigger revival than your church you know if god was moving in your midst like he was moving in our midst this would happen or that would happen or you wouldn't have any teenagers or young people in your church struggling to serve god if you had what we had i'm sorry i'm not in that battle with you amen our battle is not down the road or over the mountain or across the desert our battle is right here and we'll stay right here in our land and we'll fight our battle and we'll fight for our children and for our families amen and for those in our midst that's what we'll do amen so they come to settle this this grudge and they go to war and when this battle is over saints i hope you catch the depth of this when this battle is over it become a mixed multitude it says that the gideonites they possess the approaches to the jordan river so you might say they possessed all the crossing point the bridge you might say across the river they controlled it but look at this mixed multitude my brother and sister i want you to understand this and think about three kinds of believers while you're thinking about this this mixed multitude would come to the crossing of the river and the gideonites did not just look at them and say because of your shoes you're an ephemite because of your trousers you're an ephemeric because of your shirt you're an ephemeric because of your haircut you're an ephraim i know my brother and sister this mixed multitude joined together there was no way think about this three kinds of believers no way to separate this they're looking at these people and they don't know what they're looking at this could be a gideon gideonite this could be an ephraim i and they ask him are you an ephemeric nay but god has a way and has had a way all through the generations when the prophet of god talked about the word being a separator in our day he didn't just pull that out of a hat somewhere and say i'm going to just make up a principle and apply it and throw it out here he could come right back here and take it right into the word of god and then brother branham talks about the word test amen you can look it up he talks about give a word test and so what it is that you go back right here and so what did they do when they would come are you nephremite nay what kind of believer are you are you a make believer nay are you an unbeliever nay we'll give you a word test we're going to give you a word test and we want you to pronounce this simple word which is not simple i'll be honest with you i got my daughter to look it up on the pronunciation thing and had to listen to it a few times see and i'm still not sure i got it quite right because you know how do you say that word i don't know how to say that word i need help how to say that word and you know they have all these wonderful gadgets we call technology the very thing that causes you to waste hundreds of hours of your time but you can waste that extra time that you save looking up the words pronunciation and he says i'm going to give you a word test all i need for you to do is say the word should be left now you know my brothers and sisters that speak french those of you that would speak spanish look i speak idaho english that's not even a proved form of english but those of you that speak french and you speak other language spanish etc you know that there's certain things you must do with your tongue and the way you pronounce things you know like in spanish you know you gotta roll do i get that close no my daughter said i flunked you got to do certain things and here they are now faced with a life and death test over the word why did they pick that why couldn't they used a word like um i don't know house i mean everyone can say house are you with me everyone can say i'm a christian why can't we just settle for the words i'm a christian or let's condense that out even a little easier everyone can say i'm a believer so why can't we just bring it down to the simple words of saying i'm a believer and if i say i'm a believer then nobody bothers me never nobody looks or nobody questions or and my behavior is no longer important what i actually believe is no longer important and what i do in my life is no longer important because i said but what do they do they come with a word by divine inspiration no doubt you say the word i was going to look up to see what should be left means and i forgot this morning but my brother and sister he knew there was one thing that by their cultural training and by their schools you might say and who they were as a people there was one thing they couldn't fake and that's the holy ghost i mean that was that word one thing that cannot be faked and they're there now each man saying no i'm not an ephemeric good pass the word test and they got up there and no matter how i can imagine i i'm not meaning to be funny but i can just imagine the guy there you know okay all you got to do is say should be left and the man's like sibuleth no that's not right give me another chance uh sibiulev no you didn't get it right have mercy guys one more chance i've got it cbf a little better but still not sorry you're an ephraimite lost his life over the word test are you with me saints you see this very simple thing right here of a word test and we come right down into the day that we're living in and the prophet of god says it'll come right down to you and i and to those that would come my brother and sister they would make a rapture those that would come into that position they will pass the word test amen brother branham says god the holy ghost could no more lead you away from the word amen he can't lead you away from the word i've got the holy ghost but i believe this over here no we have a word test i've got the holy ghost i believe the word and even if i find myself wrong i'm not going to stand on i believe what i believe because i was taught this as a child and i won't move from this no the holy ghost will cause the individual in the word test to look at that and say you know what i need another chance lord oh aren't you glad god's uh god give second chances amen and the lord had come along and we would have maybe said no it's in the name of the father in the name of the son the name of the holy spirit and the word would speak to us and say no that's not right and god would deal with us and one day we'll recognize hey this is who i am i'm the word and the word very clearly shows this lord forgive me that i believe that but i believe your word now but my brother and sister if you're an ephraimite amen you can't just become gideonite that's right once you are an ephemeric born in ephemeri you will always be an ephemeric the prophet of god said if you are in god now you were in him in the beginning you were always in him amen we didn't just come down here and receive the lord jesus christ and become converted undocumented you might say in the plan of god my brother and sister god knew that the word would come to us he knew that we would embrace that word that it would find a resting place in the heart and the soul of sons and daughters of god hallelujah hallelujah excuse me if i get a little excited i'm telling you saints i wish i could have the i don't know why maybe it was just for this reason but i woke up about 20 this morning amen and just laying there in bed and there was such an inspiration come over me i should have got out of bed and started writing but i was so tired and i thought lord i pray actually prayed this prayer lord let me just remember this anointing in the morning amen i should have got out of bed there's some essence i believe that has escaped me but my brother and sister when you realize that you look in this mixed multitude that we are living in right now amen brother brown talking about israel was a mixed multitude coming out amen look at this how they look similar i'm telling you in many cases the unbeliever looks like the make-believer look like the believer you can't pick them apart by their looks amen they walk similar they talk similar but there must be some way must be some way to separate them right we're coming down here right you don't the word says you don't go out in the wheat field and start pulling up the tares lest you would pull up the true wheat the true seed amen so it's got to come to the harvest and there in the harvest the wheat is gathered in the garner and the tares are bound so coming into maturity and i know this is a farmer and those of you would know too uh you come when it gets to the maturing time it's not so hard to tell the difference between the wheat and the rye and the wild oat and the thistle and the whatever amen but boy early on the year when the field's just the green and lost you go out there and start trying to decide you know what i think you're a terror you go tear a real believer out disrupt their life ruin it no that's not how it works we gotta do it but you see we're coming we're not we're not in the we're not in the uh uh um uh what we would call the vegetative state as believers we're coming into maturity amen so it's no longer that we sit back and people uh you know they think you're mean cruel harsh judgmental but my brother and sister when they were walking through their roguing the field of the wild oats and the rye they didn't apologize to it you're not wheat sorry you go in a different pile you go in a different bundle but we've come into such a touchy feely world we don't want to offend anyone so what we're going to do is we're going to preach it a little bit softer and hope that somehow you grasp this you know what you're doing you're starving the bride and making the tear feel comfortable that's all it comes down to i'm here to feed the bride i'm sorry i don't i pray with all of my heart there's no tear in the building today but i'm here to feed the bride and if it makes the tear uncomfortable then we just have to live with that because if we get all touchy feeling you know i tell you i do my best to hide this but i'm actually a very emotional person i'm the kind of guy that sees something sad and i i start crying i i did it yesterday just a little something in it and i was like oh my goodness and this tears come in my eyes that's kind of i am and something i have to guard against i'm also raised up as a child one of those huggers i don't think about it i'm just one of those it's like oh god bless you oh wait that's a sister nothing carnal it's just my nature amen i don't want to embarrass sister gabriella but i i'm i'm telling her i i she's like a granddaughter to me you know sister sarah how old was she when you moved here just a baby first family outside of my own children and become a habit to wrap my arms around this little girl and let her know i love her but she's turning into a young woman so please forgive me if you ever see me in the foyer give her a hug i i'm breaking that habit because she's coming into a young woman right she's no longer a baby but you see i love her and by my very nature do you understand what i'm saying by my very nature i want to just give her a little hug just a little let her know i love you girl people misunderstand i don't want you to misunderstand sister jerry's my encouragement she's like paul she's a woman now she's right there you have to you have to let go let's see our old nature sometimes hard to break and so you see it we come into that realm where where because of our nature i want you all to be happy i want you all to like me so if i water the word down the prophet of god give an indictment to a weak pulpit for sending souls to hell i don't want to be guilty of that amen i want to stand firm but i want you to know i love you each one of you i just hugged you but you see we got to stand firm on the word of god because if we don't every bit of our effort is wasted if we end up like that rich man who passes and wakes up in hell oh it won't do us a bit of good amen so there has to be a way to tell them apart now brother branham says here and the spoken word is the original seed amen he says here give it the word test that's the way to tell whether it's right or wrong that's just just give it the word test see what it says about the word any spirit see what it says about the word any spirit if it denies the word it's not of god see no matter what it is if it denies the word it's not of god look give it the word test and see what happens now look saints this is not amen oh hallelujah word test brother branham doesn't say give them a word test and see how kind they are no give them a word test to see if they still love you give them a word test to see if they'll stand with the word you see that's all that really matters you know i'll tell you right now just speaking from my heart to you this morning when the preacher gets more worried about what you think about him than he thinks about the preaching of the word then you need to run or have another pastor or whatever because you see that's nothing but that's nothing but a spirit you see it's not an association test he didn't say anything about now look who they hang out with if they hang out with the right people then overlook all of this i know brother so-and-so oh my now look saints this is uh something a little tender to some people okay i don't mean it to be crass or harder or i'm not trying to be edgy but look at this my brother and sister we have people who are like oh my they were with brother branham i'm telling you you don't dare let go of your wallet you don't dare take a word that they said you'll find there's nothing to verify any of the stories that they pour out to you and that's rightly so many things take place in personal but i'll let you know right now my brother and sister if you want to know where brother paul stands you can find it right here it's not going to be because i know brother george smith sorry brother george for including you in our service this morning although he did text this morning and say he was praying for us and that might be the reason right there my brother sister it is in a position because i know brother george smith and can consider him a bosom friend it makes no difference brother george is either on the word or he's off the word and from brother george's point looking back our direction we're either on the word or we're off the word it's not an association amen it's not that we can name drop there's no test about who can name trump well you know we are standing here and this brother was with the prophet that's good did he have the holy ghost that's what i want to know did he have a revelation of the word that's the only thing that matters to me there was a lot of people walk with the prophet you look at this it's a wonderful story tommy osborne my brother and sister he sits there in the coliseum in portland oregon and he looks at brother branham and tommy osborne's own words now this man did not go on to follow the message but i'm telling you the power of god in the presence of god and tommy osborne's ministry was failing he would go into cities and it used to have nice crowds and it was dropping and god wasn't moving he sits there in the coliseum in portland oregon he looks down there and tommy osborne's testimony is uh for the first time in my life i saw god in the flesh and something spoke to him and said if you will do that for him i will do that for him then i will do that for you but my brother look at this come on people get all bent out of shape about these things tommy osborne's ministry went on to circle the world people were healed people were delivered all kinds of the supernatural but tommy osborne did not embrace even some of the basic scriptural things that were right here not in the message in the bible but you see he tapped into that he caught a revelation that we can approach this in this fashion and god will honor his word now look i want you to line up with the word of god i'm not i'm not trying to give you an out but i'm telling you my brother and sister if you will challenge god in the sense that if he said it i believe it and you believe it with all of your heart you wait and see if god will not honor your word and your claim to that and will bless you and so much sore my mother brother and sister if you will submit yourself to god just surrender you know what our biggest problem is we want it our way i want it hard way this is how it should be no i'm sorry my brother and sister being associate with god won't do it god and i are friends that's wonderful i'm glad you and god are friends when you're going to let him in hallelujah when are you going to let him in you can talk about god did this and god did that and god said this and god said that why don't you let him in hallelujah and no longer become a debate it'll become a life hallelujah now look at this to them it was a pronunciation test right if you had been an ephemeric and you would have been able to pronounce that you would have just blew your way right through it but my brother and sister you'll find the word of god says from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh that's exactly right you know we got a problem in the world today i'm just going to speak blunt to you this morning i wasn't going to but i will we got way too many ministers they're falling like flies around the message why because they could pronounce it but it wasn't revelation they said all the right things that's right well you know what amen god sent a prophet i believe that with all of my heart amen is he my savior no i'm sorry i had to cut it off right there he was the one who pointed me to christ he's the one that let me see it in such a fashion that it became so real to me that nothing's going to change my mind but he's not my savior never was never will be but i believe that god ordained my life to cross the path of this revealed word and when it crossed that path something changed amen so here it's not about me pronouncing it right well god sent a prophet god sent a prophet god sent a prophet that's good we can pronounce it oh but my brother and sister where's the word test amen that word test comes down and produces the word right one of the very first things you think about this very first things go back to genesis we won't go off into this but one of the very first things that god places in his word was the seed amen oh my brother and sister it comes down the importance of this seed we can talk about it we can talk about it right now i'm growing this beautiful corn crop wait it's january corn they'll grow in january in idaho i can talk about how great my crop is going to be the evidence of what i believe is whether i slap the seed in the ground or whether i just go out there and and just haphazardly do it or whether i become very meticulous hallelujah brother jason will know sometimes you can't get any work done for crawling behind the planter i always laugh brother brown says now a farmer he'd plant a seed he doesn't go out there every day and dig it up to see how it's doing i know what brother branham was saying so don't don't think then i'm counterdicting this but brother branham wasn't a farmer there's hardly a day goes by in the spring after we have planted that we're not out there digging up a seed is there enough moisture to get the seed out of the ground you see you have to decide that you can't decide it after the fact right remember the parable of the sower when that seed gets started if there's not sufficient moisture the life springs forth but when the conditions are not right the seed dies you can't resurrect that seed in the natural we're out there digging is there sufficient moisture in the ground there is the next day oh look at that it's putting out a tail i know you guys i don't know where your enthusiasm's about no these are wonderful things these are wonderful things you go out there the next day and it's not just putting out a tail the tail has put off now and i can't pronounce all those fancy little words they have for that but that little tail has now put off this little micro hair root oh hallelujah it isn't just enough god sent a prophet hallelujah something's taking root hey man something's sinking down roots amen and you can go out in the field i remember one time i was planting corn for a guy called him up and i said um you know you got to do something different i said uh um my plant will barely go in your ground and he said i got time to do something different planted anyhow so we went out there and he paid us to plant his corn but my brother and sister we always take a shovel along i couldn't get that shovel in the ground imagine what his corn crop turned out like but i tell you what when that seed lands in the good soil oh hallelujah what is that that's that channel that the holy ghost brings it right down my brother and sister the prophet of god talks about that channel and we want that channel that goes right down to the soul so when that revelated word of god comes right down and he hits that channel it comes right down here and hits in our soul and something takes place amen we don't need someone to drive it home to us it's putting out its roots it's doing everything it's popping up above the soil unfurling a leaf it's saying right there hallelujah i have produced a seed but you say where's the seed it's in me hallelujah i don't got to go somewhere and find a seed i don't need a book how to produce that seed that seed is in me oh hallelujah that life of christ is in me oh my you see it's not about our pronunciation otherwise i'd fail amen but what the word that we're anointed to speak when the fiery trials come will you pass the word test whole another kind of word test will you pass the word test hi my name is shadrach they're fixing to throw me in the furnace god has betrayed me oh no king let me tell you if god lets me burn up regardless i will serve him if god chooses for me to be eaten by a lion in the den then my god is in control hallelujah we need to learn to pass a word test amen we don't want to speak the devil's language i'm not a very good christian i'm weak i'm this i'm that amen let the word they hit the channel of your soul come right down in there and let that take betting ground in your soul that when the time comes and troubles are upon you oh brother paul how could we in the time of need speak to that mountain and it be moved i'll tell you how because the seed i believe that seed is in there already and god anoint that and you say this is a time nothing else will work nothing else will work i can't get a friend i can't get to government nothing's going to change nothing but in the name of jesus christ who is my husband who is my bridegroom who is my creator he is my savior in his name i believe [Applause] and then we have life-changing events oh hallelujah because you see if you want to put it down in simple words in those fiery trials you'll either speak victory or you'll speak defeat it'll come in a lot of different words it'll come in a lot of different explanations but you'll be speaking one or the other victory or defeat i'll tell you i get excited about this not to relive things in the past but i remember a sister in south africa amen the devil come in like a tornado ripped her family apart amen we were preaching there and something stirred my heart and you you shaken your shoes afterwards because you're like lord what did i say to that sister but i stood there on the steps of their camp meeting building and i told that sister right to her face in front of witnesses god will give you your children amen amen oh years went by i would i think i shared that with the church she sent me uh emails and whatnot and pictures she wanted me to know brother paul my last one gave his heart to the lord and not only that he brought his wife actually was his girlfriend he was living with her and brought her with him and god saved both of them and they got married in the back room of the church and went on to serve god the sister my brother and sister i remember looking that sister in the face that day and i'm telling you a sheer faith in god that calls her to say i believe that brother paul because it was in a dire strait a son that thought he was elvis he had a good voice too hallelujah anyone to teach it to all the kids and the ministry of the church had to take a hard stance and tell him you won't like walk back in the doors of our church you're not welcome here oh my goodness that's rude what if he was a seed yeah what if he was amen what if he was but what if yeah what if god said i've never lost to one amen amen well brother paul i don't embrace that book tough love well good i'll embrace tough love on you and maybe by revelation you'll embrace it on your family amen no my brother and sister let's not beat around the bush that's right come on what we've got to do is have what it takes for word test amen now we're not talking we're not talking a 70s word test though that you earned around the message in the 70s you might not recognize this but in in the 70s the message was a very very hard line very hard line as a child growing up in the church in them days it was nothing for a deacon to walk up the aisle of the church sorry sister naughty and just slap you on the back of the head straighten up or i'll deal with you after church i really want to serve god i just love going to church now no 70s i'll tell you i'll give you a word test if you don't believe it like i do you're of the devil no no i'm sorry that word test got scuttled that was a man's idea i'll tell you the word test we're standing on today my brother and sister and it's not one where i have to come to your house brother david brother chris come to your house force it this is the word test to the true bride because the holy ghost has hit the channel and come right down in you and you pick up your bible because you want to you read your bible because something inside of you desires that and the bible becomes a lie and it tells you to quit your smoking and quit your drinking and quit your dancing and quit your doing and not quit defiling your body and you look at that and say it's the word it's the word and while i like that stuff i'm gonna obey the word and you say well i'm gonna do it what you don't realize is you're taking the word test your own self amen it's a self test hallelujah i'm sure glad they didn't do this online homeschool stuff when i was a kid because i'd got an a in everything yeah see the believer you know everyone's a believer today come on everybody's a believer today amen but the real true believer when the word comes he opens up that channel the prophet of god talks about us going down there and cleaning out that channel and a real believer cleans that channel out when the holy ghost falls it goes right down into that channel and comes right into the soul amen hey amen i did put this note in here i guess i kind of forgot i did luke 6 45 amen a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good amen you can't just fake that my brother and sister you can't fake it when you're not happy but you still do the right thing you can't fake it in the times of great distress when you still say lord thy will be done you can't fake that you can't fake it when there's no one else there to to determine your direction but you something inside of you says that's what i want hallelujah and an evil man of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh oh god let me pass a word test amen let me say amen to the word no matter how hard it hurts oh you know that song listen to my heart i pray maybe this will give a little deeper significance to that because sometimes my brother and sister the old mouth and the old heart seem to be in a conflict with each other sometimes you know sister jerry she's just ruthless but sometimes i get just feeling a little down underneath a little cloud and i'll start like remembering she's like oh yeah negative no don't look down at her i needed that i needed somebody to remind the preacher to live what he preached oh did i did my inner voice come out wow sorry about that delete that from the record please look when the right words come i want you to think about this not all preaching my brother and sister makes a difference in your life not all preaching makes a difference in your life only the preaching that you led in makes a difference in your life that's right brother david will be our favorite villain this morning brother david preaches something real straight and it skins both of your knuckles and you're like you might as well act like you're going to the restroom and go home because you see you've shut yourself up and nothing else that's said is going to make i didn't get much out of that service no that's right i heard you close the door i heard the key and i heard the chain on the latch i don't know why i didn't get much out of this service i guess brother david's preaching just don't do it for me thank you for being my villain brother david but you know the word that makes a difference in our life prophet of god told us it ain't the man that brings it it's the atmosphere so the preaching that makes a difference in our life is the one where we come in and we throw open the doors oh lord i need to hear from you today lord let your word come right down to the channel of my soul today and you walk out of church you know brother david said this and this and brother david did say i never said that but you see what they heard was not brother david's voice it was a voice speaking to their life and my brother and sister let me just tie this to you this way that was what happened my brother and sister hattie wright is sitting there listening to a prophet of god talk about the moving of god the moving of the holy spirit and she's there and she says that ain't nothing but the truth i want to know was she talking to william branham or was she talking to god if she was talking to william branham then william branham had to give her what she asked are you with me if it was william branham then william branham would have been responsible to provide to her what it was that she spoke but she was talking to god and she said that ain't nothing but the truth well i have my favorite preacher well hallelujah i have my favorite dessert too i like brother so-and-so because he presents the message in such a sweet dignified fashion and i really appreciate his ministry because every time i hear him preach i walk out feeling so good about myself spurgeon says if a minister preaches and doesn't offend someone he has failed at his job now i don't know who that spurgeon guy was i think he was just some random guy off the street but i embrace what he has to say hallelujah what time is it somebody no don't answer look at this when the right words come what are those right word saints those are the ones you accept i don't care how good the preaching is i don't care how much you like the preacher you've got to accept it doesn't say debate it doesn't say research it what you will accept amen let's go back to hattie wright interesting how do you write this hillbilly no education made so little money that people couldn't understand how they even existed had a crippled sister two rebellious sons my goodness here just second i mean my kids aren't serving the lord i don't know if god hears my prayers lousy lousy woo if god loved me come on saints i've heard this out of believer's lips if god loved me he'd give me a better job brother you don't understand i felt like saying this to that brother that time brother you don't understand what little money you have right now you do such a horrible job with it i can't imagine if you had a lot of money let me one of those watered-down preachers at that moment in my life and i was like yeah okay brother i'm sorry he probably wouldn't call me friend right now if his this paul that was there i'd tell him brother you need to go listen to dave ramsey you need to read your bible it actually has the best budgeting program hey man you got so many holes in your pockets you know what i just happen to know because i is dropped on the trustee talking to your pastor that you ain't paid ties in a year and you're trying to borrow money from the church because life is so hard when you catch the real principle of the word of god you will go back and say i don't care if we have to eat soda crackers and branch waters i'm going to say amen to this word and i'm gonna and then oh hallelujah i hope you'll forgive me for my craziness but then you'll feel something rustling in your pocket and realize the holy ghost is in there so and will hold up hallelujah and you go out there and that old car that would barely start yesterday fires right off and drives like a top amen but no no i don't like it the preacher when he preaches about ties did i just mention tyson it's all about the money it's all about the money i want your money like i told a brother years ago that was ripping into me about that if i wanted more money saints i'd quit being your pastor and i'd farm more ground because corn don't back talk [Laughter] come on i'm glad you guys got a sense of humor this morning you see my brother and sister it's the anointing of the holy ghost got to find its betting place it's got to find the correct place and we have to open up and receive that word and when we open up and receive that word you say well brother paul i come to church in the right attitude i come and it didn't really seem to make a difference will you just wait you just wait god is faithful he says i haven't forgot your labor of love you just be faithful amen she was anointed to speak the right words how about you and i can we this morning say lord anoint me to speak the right words i don't want to speak what i feel i hope you have a little sense of humor this morning i heard last night even yesterday news travels so fast sister kerry might be standing up in church tomorrow sister kerry don't be embarrassed amen but everybody loved the idea that sister carrie might be leaning against the wall over here too sore to sit down i crawled around on floors for three days working on my nice house my knees hurt so bad i can't hardly stand here you guys want to hear about that i want to hear about how hard my life is my first world problems no what i want to hear about is the power of almighty god that will come down and we'll save our children we'll heal our bodies and the time of discouragement will take us and lift us up into heavenly places i don't want to hear about problems my brother and sister i'm not going to look behind me and i'm not going to look down in a crazy world where people will run through the congressional deal with a buffalo head on their head and and do and wash out windows and do all of this craziness and nation against nation and wars and rumors of war and pestilences and plagues i'm not gonna worry about the problems i'm gonna look to the promise and as long as there's life in this body i can breathe out i want to claim the promise amen because the promise is more real than my problem is hallelujah it all depends on the size you give credit to your problem if you look at your problem have you ever noticed that the only time i wake up in the middle of the night knowing oh what am i going to do about this is when i haven't let go of the problem i'm telling you i've had this in my life go to bed at night a major dilemma and get down beside the bed lord you know i need a good night's sleep and father you know paul can't fix this so lord i'll just give this to you i hope you don't mind lord that this looks actually like a trash can but i'm going to deposit it right here on the altar and you go to bed and you sleep all night long and you get up the next day and somehow the problem doesn't seem quite as big but the devil will come roaring maybe with a phone call maybe with an email maybe with a tax come back what about your problem what about your problem well i'll tell you what i'm not talking to anybody but the lord right now but lord when i heard and when i read about your word and the life it produced i something inside of me said that ain't nothing but the truth hallelujah oh my god hallelujah i've got to quit first corinthians 2 9 says but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us well this is so presumptuous isn't it we're standing there it's revealed to me i don't know about you saints but it's revealed to me amen are you with me it's revealed to me this is revealed to me but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god amen amen for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god do you realize my brother and sister we talk about the holy spirit and we we preach about the holy spirit receive the holy spirit young people press into it get the holy ghost like we could go to winco and purchase it it's become such a tossed out thing that it's almost as though it has no value help us lord is right brother trevor help us lord do you realize saints when god does these things for us that's the spirit of god right in your children's bedroom at your desk for school at the factory at the whatever that's gone that's not all i just felt the spirit of the lord move upon me praise the lord go on no my brother and sister that's god's mercy come down breathing on us breathing on us coming as the prophet of god says he's wooing us he's speaking to us hallelujah this is not just like oh i felt something oh praise the lord well anyway no we ought to we ought to revere that we ought to say thank you lord thank you lord amen now we have received not the spirit of the world i'll tell you what the spirit of the world will do oh wait i'm the pastor and i can't let that inner voice out in case i discourage someone i'll tell you what the spirit of the world will do it'll cause you to say and do things that you're ashamed of oh but i'm a christian i've got the holy ghost i don't care the spirit of this world will cause you to think and do things you're ashamed of well praise the lord not me well okay let's see what they say comes before the fall now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god hallelujah thank you lord lord i got my hands up today i'm receiving lord everything that you are giving everything that's free lord i want that today hallelujah oh no that's not like the deal brother isaac told me about one time i don't remember it was a video clip or something people standing in front of the church and the pastors up there and he's talking about them now god will bless you the more you give the more god will bless you you know i'd like some of you to finally get blessed the preacher's standing up there and he starts doing the saying money money money money money money and you know what all of a sudden money started floating down but the problem was the camera swung a little bit too high and so people got excited and run it up started grabbing the money because it's floating down it's real money but then the preacher you see he wanted his money back or the church's money back or whoever's money it was back and so people are running up there grabbing that and they're telling whoa stop you put that right up here on the platform dude wait you told us to ask for money come on saints some of us treat the holy ghost the same way praise the lord god moved in the service today hasn't been in my house for a year isn't with me when i go to work but he's oh he's sure strong in church well just go ahead bring it all up here and leave it on the platform you don't need to take it with you no that's not what it's about it's time for us to realize if you're going to be able to pass the word test you've got to be reciting come on you've got to be reciting you've got to be eating you've got to be in the presence of the word constantly you've got to find the carcass you can't say oh i took a bite off the carcass that was so good and left it behind no sir you got to come back every single day to the carcass every single day to the presence every single day that my words would be pleasing to god every single day my actions every single day amen hallelujah because the day will come when you're the weakest amen and you'll have to pass a word test sister emmy would you come musicians please let's look at this verse 13. yes sir which thing's also we speak words not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth that's right that work test my brother and sister is called intellectual i remember talking to a brother one time remember me i'm a high school dropout sorry i was talking to a brother one time and i pronounced the word i knew i mispronounced it but i didn't actually know exactly how to pronounce it and the brother corrected me i said well thank you brother and we're talking a little longer and i mispronounced another word and he corrected me and then it seemed like the frequency got sooner and sooner so i wondered how many he had ignored on the front end of the conversation when it seemed like every other word he was like no that you didn't pronounce it right you didn't use that word in the right context you didn't finally i was like who's having this conversation i'll sound judgmental my brother's english was really good and he knew a lot of big words and he had letters and whatever after his name but he doesn't serve god today because the word test that mattered he didn't pass [Music] sounds hoarse don't it his life's the reality of that i'm not judging him the scripture says to judge yourself but see we want to speak the words which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual hallelujah you love the lord today oh man i tell you i love the lord the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they're spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is not judged of no man that doesn't mean we walk around judging everybody yeah i don't think they're a believer i don't think this i don't think that's also talking about for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ hallelujah amen look i my oh my i thought i didn't got enough notes up here for nothing we'll be out by 11 45. i guess that was on monday [Music] when a man once catches the vision of the invisible god and knows that he is always present you see this what changed the difference someone might say you know brother paul what what was the what was the effect of the message on you well we were good family that was nazarene we were good god-fearing people [Music] you went to church on wednesday night you went to church on sunday the rest of the time you did whatever you wanted a married man three children a godly wife you know what made the difference for me i hope this doesn't bother any of you it wasn't the words that god sent a prophet didn't make the difference for me it was the effect of the message that he carried to us and well in my thirties when i woke up one day and i caught a vision [Music] that this god that i can't even see is right here with me it's no longer me against the world but it's god in me there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking i don't know if you're familiar with the phrase wilder than a peach orchard boar you know what that phrase is that's an old hog that's out in the peach orchard when the peaches have fallen on the ground and they've laid there and they've started to rot i've witnessed this with my own eyes this is real this reality calves will do the same thing they go out there and they start eating these half rotten peaches and then you got this pig that's drunk [Music] and when he's drunk pardon me he thinks he can do anything [Music] but when he wakes up from that [Music] realizes that all he's done is made a fool out of one himself catches that and that vision starts to stabilize his thinking [Music] it stabilizes his actions and the time of distress and trouble he won't look in a bottle he won't look in a bong he won't look in all this garbage of this world he'll look up the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the unseen amen yet by promise oh hallelujah now how abraham not only did he see the unseen and the reason he believed it was a revelation that is so simple people are missing it god said it i didn't have to say it brother branham didn't have to say it we don't have to pin it to this guy spurgeon tozer this one that one whatever my brother and sister god said it who god used to speak it is irrelevant god said it and god brings his word to pass if we being dead in christ we are abraham's seed and if the spirit that was in christ dwells in us it does the same thing it takes every divine promise of god that's in his bible and calls it present [Music] tense and rest itself upon there hallelujah i'm gonna pass a word test amen when i need to say amen to it i'm gonna be able by god's grace it's gonna be hurt it's gonna be painful you guys don't think the preacher doesn't sit up here sometimes and go ouch sometimes our own preaching you think oh if you saw my notes this morning you say how did he get all he got out of that i don't know but there's times our notes are such and we're going this way and what the reality of it is is we walk out of church repenting come on saints i'm telling you the truth we walk out of church repenting because god's dealt with our own heart the preacher i'm talking about dealt with his own heart in the service and we realized lord i'm not doing all i could do lord i i didn't necessarily do the right thing there lord oh we're not talking about horrible things but you see god's a refining firing he says you know i got to put a little more heat back on you paul got a couple more things to get out of you and sometimes you think well okay the lord would let me sit in church and somebody else would preach it and i would say amen to and go home sometimes you talk about the real irony of this when god allows you to preach the very thing that convicts your own heart that causes you to go home and repent over oh hallelujah tell me god's got a sense of humor hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yes okay we're gonna call it good right there amen brother jay help me amen [Music] this is the evening time it's later than you think we look at what's going on in the world my brother and sister they're at it again oh if the economy gets any worse the dollar devalues any further we might go in a recession and all of you poor people you you need to support the government we'll take care of you well i'll tell you what i found is whenever i support the lord he takes care of me hallelujah this government's going to fail hallelujah yeah praise the lord my hope is in the lord not in the government [Music] amen this is the evening time it's later than you think right now the bride is now for her lord to me all things are ready now [Music] the evening time is here oh this is evening time it's later than you think the bride is prepared now for her lord to be all things are ready now my [Music] the evening time is here listen to my heart [Music] how do you explain oh how do you explain do you describe that love that goes from east to west and runs as deep as it is [Music] [Music] when words cannot express the love we feel but we long for you to hear let's stand worship the lord [Music] [Music] and we will use the words we know to tell you [Music] just listen to our hearts if words could fall like rain all my words lord from these lips of mine if i had a thousand years i would still run out of time so if you listen to my heart every beat will say thank you for the life lord thank you for the truth and thank you for the way [Music] that [Music] and we will use the words i know to tell you what an awesome god you are when words are not enough to tell you about love just listen to our hearts if words could fall like rain from these lips of mine and if i had a thousand years i would still run out of time so if you listen to my thank you for the truth thank you for the way [Music] i love you lord [Music] just listen to my heart just let your heart speak to it oh hallelujah [Music] your anointing word of jesus life changing stabilizing strengthening redeeming you washing oh thank you lord thank you lord it's not just words lord you've blessed us with a life oh blessed is with your life lord holy hallelujah thank you thank you thank you oh thank you jesus oh thank you lord jesus you know the thoughts of that song the word is working mindfully in me can we say amen to that let's sing that brother jason sister emmy the word is working mightily why it's because it's the word i let in the more i let in the more it does its job hallelujah aren't you glad hallelujah i stand here today you know i was talking to a man and it breaks my heart that people feel this way this man was telling me he says well brother paul my problem with ministers is because through the years around the message i've been lied to preached false doctrines too and he said when i listen to a tape i don't have to have any guard up i can just listen to it and receive it breaks my heart with your words like that we should as sons and daughters of god to be able to come in the house of god just open our heart up and just receive one my brother and sister if our mind is the filter versus the holy ghost being the filter we've got a problem god help us each and every one not to come to guarded not to come trust god pray the prayer lord don't let me hear don't let me hear anything contrary lord just block it from me it's not coming to church all all guarded up like well brother paul's gonna say something and it's gonna be no i'd rather you just say you know what i pray every service lord just block anything if you said it was an opinion you said something the lord just blocked it from me i didn't know you even said it i'm telling you it works sister jerry and i set through time sister sue would have been part of that year's past ministers up here you know in the church we was in there at that time in star idaho and they were preaching things underhanded real slippery things we'd walk out of church get in the car be driving home jerry and i look at each other i don't have much education but i don't think i'm stupid no comments but i look over at sister jerry and i would say did you understand what they were saying sister jerry look at me and go i couldn't figure it out saints we're not clever not clever we weren't there and some intellectual whatever no we're not clever we're approaching it and just based simplicity and i'll tell you god come right down and those very things that took people away and messed up lives and tore families apart and we didn't even get it hallelujah thank you lord for a holy ghost filter saints i want to encourage you you pray about it it's up to you i'm not here to dictate your life you know that but don't come to church all guarded up come to church with the holy
