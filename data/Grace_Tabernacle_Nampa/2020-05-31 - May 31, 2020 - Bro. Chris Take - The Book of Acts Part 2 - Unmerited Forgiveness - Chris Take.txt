where we came from but you get used to the cooler wetter pretty quickly so but I pray this morning that in the house of God would be cool and refreshing for us amen proverbs chapter 25 verse 21 says if they an enemy be hungry give him bread to eat and if he be thirsty give him water to drink for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head and the Lord shall reward thee Luke chapter 6 verse 27 Luke 6 verse 27 but I say unto you which hear love your enemies do good to them which hate you less than that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him that smite a--they on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take that coat also give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh away thy Goods ask them not again and as you would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise for if you love them which love you what thank have ye for sinners also love those that love them and if you do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for sinners also do even the same and if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what think have ye for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again but love you your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind under the unto the unthankful and to the evil be therefore merciful as your father also is merciful judge not and ye shall not be judged to condemn not you shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven given it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again as bara heads Heavenly Father Lord be since your presence is here father Lord and we feel you father but but loyal even beyond that father we have faithful chases that you are here this morning and fathers that sixth sense Lord that we need to tap into your presence this morning father to tap into that realm where Jesus were Lord him questions are answered father to tap into that realm or bodies are healed father souls are delivered Lord father we ask that you just come this morning Lord speak to our hearts Lord Jesus we have need no father to hear from you Lord Jesus Lord nothing has changed Lord the world getting gotten a garden crazier and crazier father and thousands of years have passed but Thor just says your disciples sat at your feet Lord when you walked in shores of Galilee father so today we have the same need to sit at your feet this morning Lord and hear your words father Lord it's time draws to an end and the culmination father of the Bride of Christ Lord and that the world begins the Lord continues to grown father for the manifestation of the sons of God may we take this morning in the words that you give to us Lord and father apply them Lord to our lives that Lord we could go farther forth into the world and shine your life for Jesus I pray O God that you would soften each heart Lord no woman no one here this morning would be hard or Jesus her father would be pliable or Jesus father would be willing to accept oh Jesus correction willing to accept father Lord encouragement or willing to accept father forgiveness and willing to give forgiveness out or God we love you Lord and we thank you for all these things commit this into your hands now the reading of the word the speaking of these things Lord we ask it in your name we pray Jesus Christ amen you may be seated praise the Lord this morning my title is the book of Acts part 2 and if you think number one is missing don't be afraid I already spoke it here it's been a few weeks maybe a month or two but I did I ministered on the / overtaken by Christ and we talked about how Philip and he was translated out - or transported to meet the eunuch and the eunuch was riding in his chariot and he says you know how can I understand these things lest someone teach me and Philip begins to expound to him the things of God and the eunuch says you know what what there's water here let me be baptized and so that was so part 1 looking at town how Christ is overtaking our lives in this day and age that we live in and our time and here and that how another book of Acts is being written we have a quote here from 1964 God has provided lamb but the venom says how many in here would like for God's provided land to open a lamb to open your eyes so you can see him here now present a man there's several quotes our brother man talks about another book of Acts but I picked this one for led to pick this one because he how he starts at how lure we desire for our eyes should be open amen so that we can see him here now present not a God in the past but a God that's present but the man says all the time people are looking back to see what God has done and looking forward to see what God will do but never catching what God is doing in the present a Manning he says would you raise your hand say God opened my blinded eyes let me have my veil took off of my heart Lord that I might understand and now how will he be known how will we know him by his nature what he does his works he said I am the vine ye are the branches now the branch bears the fruit not the vine the vine energizes the branch and if the branch ever brings forth or a vine brings forth a branch it has grapes on it the next vine comes out or branch out of that vine will have grapes on it if the first church that come off that vine it was a Pentecostal church and with all the gifts if that ever really puts out another branch they'll write another book of Acts behind it that's what they had in the days of the Apostles and the Apostolic age never ended and then that was great controversy in the time of the brand I'm probably still today whether or not that those things were still prevalent I had someone one time a Baptist very loosely a Baptist um tell me that you know well we've moved beyond that stuff we move beyond the speaking in tongues and and all that stuff to move to a perfection and trying to tell me that that stuff isn't prevalent anymore but this morning I'm here to tell you that God still does and is doing what he did in the book of Acts and then he goes on to say he said Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises to you and to your children and to them that's far off even as the mini our Lord God shall call amen skip down to the last paragraph 150 says Lord open our eyes and let us see that provided Lamb you promised that you would reveal yourself in the last days like you did at Sodom when the Son of Man was being revealed we pray God that you'll grant it now we are your subjects Lord we are your vines amen this morning amen there is another book of Acts being written the vine has put forth another branch so the vine is not going to the vine has put forth another branch and I believe that that is you this morning I believe that is me this morning and it's interesting you think about the book of Acts and and how there was many many believers but not all of them were mentioned in some way or another some of them were and their testimonies are written down and so I begin to think what will the book of Acts say about me what will it say about you what does it say about you are you written in there Amen I believe if you're living a life for Christ and you have dedicated yourself to serving God and men until the day that you die the song says then I believe that your are being written about but what is it saying amen it is is your your the book of your that's being written is it saying that you persevered and that's you that you Terry that you that you pressed on a man or is it saying that you gave up and that you let yourself fall by the wayside and then I believe when what happens is sometimes God because guess what your books not completed yet so it's still an edited it's still being edited and then we fall by the wayside here and sometimes there we we have moments of where there is no revival in our lives but guess what you can restore that God will go back and he'll after it'll delete a few paragraphs maybe a couple pages and then restore your story amen praise the Lord but the first book is our example even with the first book of Acts we saw the ushering in of the bride amen we saw the transition from the dispensation of the law for the dispensation of grace it's funny when you start to talk about these kind of things some people get a glassy look over their eyes because it's trigger phrases and they go oh here we go deep things again I understand and they turned their self off pay attention this morning catch it amen I tried that when I when I maybe it's a fault I have but when I preach I try to say the same thing with different words so people don't get that glassy look on her face amen I'll do my part God can take care of the rest praise the Lord but the second book of Acts is the ending or the the the crescendo of the Bride of Christ amen it's the culmination it's everything that they wanted in the first book it's everything that they wanted being fulfilled in us him and we are so blessed to be here and in the book of Hebrews says if it was not for us they would not be completed amen so we read the first book and it ends with the death of Paul and the beginning of great tribulation for the bride and man that goes into the dark ages because that seed was planted in the first book but the Bible says that C was planned in the first book and I had to go down into the ground through the dark ages and then it raised up again in the Reformation beginning because um if you have the seed and you don't plant it that seeds not gonna bring forth to life any men so the second book ends with the bride stepping into glory amen so I'm just kind of give you an introduction into this series I don't know how many parts hopefully I'm not gonna say that because then I'm gonna have to eat my words later on praise the Lord but we're on part two talking about the book of Acts and I I want to look at this thing in nad we could go on and hunt it on for weeks months years amen but I want my heart's desire is that there's so much in this Minnis the the time that we are in amen as Christians there's there's so much confusion and there's so much there's so much overthinking and then there's books did you know there's books written in the secular world about overthinking because that's an issue we have in this day and age and I think a lot of that comes from the fact that we don't have to do as much right I mean I'm a software engineer I sit down all day for 12 hours well I try to get up and stuff but regardless life is so easy you have plenty of time to overthink if you're working a manual labor job for 1214 hours there's no time to think you just do and back in the old days you know that's what they had to do they had they had to make Amen there they had to survive they had to work with their hands and and bring things and they didn't have the internet to go and and then go and see everybody's opinion and millions of opinions around the world and be consumed by these opinions and so that there was no time to sit and hand over think you know like the Bible says not on this right idleness but the minim says Eilis is the former is a form of idolatry amen you become idle and it and you have these these problems that come out and so my desire is to say you know maybe you don't understand the seven seals maybe you don't understand the even the Godhead maybe there's things that you don't fully understand but there's something in your heart that keeps bringing you back to this place there's something in your heart that keep resonating and and you try to go away from it you try to put it out of your head but it keeps coming back to you it keeps returning back and it keeps reminding you of these things and you say well and then the devil comes in and says well you don't understand it so how can it be true well this morning my prayer and this is my prayer and it has been for some time and in dealing with the youth and I was a part of them so youth leader in Phoenix as well and it's my desire Lord I don't want to to just spew facts and that spew information and and Lord I get up here night and I preach or I talk to the youth I have if you will information I believe that information is revelation inspired of God but I can only speak it you have to accept it and we need and we need the anointing of Christ that's why you the Holy Ghost amen back to the basics but the anointing of Christ you need and and you need to be saying that and speaking those things with that anointing amen there's there there's too many people that speak the things of the message and of the Bible and they here's the thing they might sound the same as someone that's anointed of God they might sound the same of someone that has the revelation they might know how to say the same word but there's no life in it amen there's no life in it and so if we look at the book of Acts amen and then we can just just push aside that the seals push aside the the Godhead those things are important you have to understand those God will reveal those to you in time if you can just stay as steady and stay on the path so let's look at the book of Acts and say what happened then what were they doing how are their lives expressing Christ to the world around him lord help me to put my focus on that if all you do is focus on your questions and focus on your you know these things you don't understand you just fight with doubt find something that you know in the Word of God and watch God begin to build on that because you can eat that I mean you can't give a baby this goes back to this thing and we and when we say it all the time but you can't give a baby unless it's Declan and steak no the baby has to come of age to accept real food up until that point he only takes milk and so many times people have too much pride in their heart to admit there's still a baby Christian and so they continue to try for the steak but they can't digest it and all they do is choke and die you have to humble yourself amen the Word of God says you know the Lord loveth the broken and a contrite spirit of a humble spirit you have to humble yourself and go to that spot that you know go back to the milk of the word because then you'll begin to receive new nutrition you'll begin to receive life and as you receive life what happens you grow and you begin to grow and you begin to grow tell you form the teeth or the ability to accept the revelation of further things in the word amen and brother Branham preached this and preachers around the message say it but we still erred in the same way that says brother Matt says I can't teach Pentecostals the deep things afterward if they don't know their ABCs and people just automatically assume because they're in a message church there beyond the ABCs but you look at their life and you look at the people that sit underneath those preachers who just preach things way over the heads of the congregation never taking them to the beginning taking them to that those things never coming down because we need those deep things there were a mixed congregation there's those in here that can eat that stuff there's those in here that can't and I believe that in this and I believe that an anointed pastor understands that amen praise the Lord but what we have to do as a pastor is as the Shepherd of the flock and I think the Lord we're blessed with a pastor a man that knows how to rightly divide the word of God here so I'm not speaking of our pastor Amen but I believe that a pastor who's a Shepherd of the flock he's like a he's kind of like a um he's got in some ways kind of like a father because you know the father can can he raise his kids but if they if they never receive unconditional love if they never receiving love because they're that man-child a man they can't receive anything from him and and if and if he just beats them up and and and and and then tears them down and always tells them what they're doing wrong and then they go their life without feeling the love they need to develop and a pastor if a pastor does not preach under the anointing of Christ and speak the unconditional love of God amen the people amen the people never begin to feel what it is to love God because how can you love something amen how can you love something that you never receive love from and then we're called to love our means but we're not called to to spend time with him and and try to build relationships within we love them and we pray for them and that's yet a member a father or a pastor has got to express the unconditional love of Christ and unfortunately amen that that that love is so there's places where it priests really hard and that people never feel the love of God they think that God's out to get them then this was praised places on this side words just love love love love love but what it is is it's disgrace disgrace disgrace and it's not true love true love is compassion do you know what brother Brennan said compassion is when Christ braided the whip and chase the money though those people out of the temple beat them out and knock their tables over brother band says that's compassion amen love is not just standing me standing up here and telling you all the time how good you are love is me standing up here all the time telling me who you are in Christ and sometimes that hurts sometimes that hurts praise the Lord praise the Lord we talked to the youth on Friday night and we had a youth meeting in and we talked about how you know we took a match and we said you know the matches is like your soul but you have to strike that match on the matchbox for it to set fire and now whole day that fire is the holy ghost I mean that's striking it that on the box is Jesus Christ and to receive the fire the Holy Ghost it takes friction amen and we're not called to just strike our match once we're called to continue be filled with the Holy Ghost and that takes friction in our lives and we go through things I'm not even on my notes that's a problem when you have your your title as the book of Acts and preach from Genesis to Revelation because it's all in there amen the manifestation of Christ praise the Lord amen mm-hmm praise the Lord I hope I didn't leave a thought hanging there if you forgive me if I did when I went for a drink cause I remember where I was praise the Lord Acts chapter 7 if you want to turn with me there you say you thought I was gonna preach a whole sermon about the book of Acts and never read from acts never fear we have arrived Acts chapter 7 verse 54 okay excuse me so Steven we fifi go back in and then further back Peter and the Apostles they said you know what how can it be for us to stop from preaching and go serve tables so they went out and they they they cast them Lots I think it was or however they did it and they decided on it go picked some men and we'll pick from those men we'll pick a few to be deacons and so that's where the beginning of Deacons was so Stephen was one of the first deacons and Stephen is out preaching and he's out testifying of God and the power that God had put in his life and he was already am a man that that well we'll get to that so here he is here Stephen he's preaching in the streets and and the Sanhedrin and the Pharisees the Sadducees and the Pharisees they pull him into the temple and they begin to accuse him and he so he preaches to them and he ends it with you know you stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you to always resist the Holy Ghost as your father's did so do ye then he says who have received the law verse 53 by the disposition of angels and have not kept it how dare this popper this low man tell the Pharisees and the Sadducees they have not kept the law and so if we find ourselves in verse 54 when they heard these things they were cut to the heart they were convicted and they gnashed on him with their teeth but he being full of the Holy Ghost see even you see it here even in Paul's life you see him preaching to to the Roman that the rulers even even these people they got a chance even though they already turned Jesus down and they had him crucified they were given a chance here in the Bible to accept the preaching of Stephen amen but they and they still were given that choice but they turned it down verse 55 but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of gone and said behold I see the heavens opened and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one Accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet who his name was Saul and they stoned Stephen calling upon and and they stoned Stephen calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord explore destroy these men for no Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep even here we have a man of God amen approved by the word and been accepted by the people of God who preaching the Word of God and now has to pay for that with his life and and he was doing no wrong he was doing he was just showing them the love of Christ and they turned it down he was preaching for God amen yet as he's dying instead of you know praying fire down upon them he says Lord lay not this sin to their charge and this is where we come to unmerited forgiveness is my subtitle this morning unmerited forgiveness and so there was no reason no no no one would have ever questioned Stephen no one would have ever um you know spoke it out in his funeral how he didn't forgive them if he would have just died silent but he didn't a man no one would have faulted him if he would have died calling that the Lord would would put a curse upon them no one would have faulted him but he didn't he died asking God to forgive the very people who were taking his life amen what are we talking about oh when I was preaching about how the book of Acts and and you're the second book of Acts and the miracles are happening in you you were shouting and you were excited but now when I say as he dies as you die you said God forgive them that's a whole nother box of stuff to take so whole that's a whole different thing to take in but that's the friction that we have to experience so things happen in their life that cause us to die inwardly but does that mean swallow our pride it's painful amen caused us to swallow our pride and we say Lord forgive them right didn't you're free because if you harbor unforgiveness Amen that unforgiveness is going to destroy you not the person that harms us even if they don't for you did you deserve your forgiveness you didn't any man you didn't Amen but you see as Stephen died you cannot deny that he knew Christ because he expressed Christ to his dying day and that song was appropriate he expressed Christ why cuz he passed on unconditional love unconditional love is given freely there is no you don't have to do anything and then I love my wife and I love my kids because they're a part of me that's the young and they they had no choice of doing that right that was all God there is no no condition I love them for who they are Christ loves you for who you are and for who you're going to be you say how could God love me when I was in the world and I was getting high and I was drinking beer how could God love me out there because he could see who you are and who you're going to be inside of you how could God love me when I scoffed and spit in his face because that's what you did amen that's what you did when you lived in the world and you sinned you're spitting God's but God who is rich in mercy he saw who you are he saw him even today and you you're in sin Church now which is the best place you can be even if you don't get it even if you don't understand everything just come to church just come to church and keep asking and keep asking amen I've heard people friends of mine that have left the message and they said I asked and I asked for God to show me he was real but he never did he never did so I left because I felt like I was a hypocrite I'm thinking oh my goodness all you had to do was keep sitting and keep asking and keep asking and keep asking but they were chased out of the church by someone who couldn't preach to them underneath the unconditional love of Christ so they felt like they had to leave to keep from hindering the church we are not called to chase you away we're called to preach Christ and if Christ chases you away that's that but if there's something in your heart that says I want God to be real please keep coming please keep coming and keep taking it just keep taking the word and what's going to happen you're going to change because you can't sit there with something in your heart that says Lord I want you to be real to me what is that that's a see gene of God whether or not the outside of you manifests that yet there's something inside of you calling out and I'm yelling because that stirs within me and that excites me I'm not mad you praise God I want the Lord to excite it hurts me sometimes and man it pains me Lord how can i express the love of Christ to someone who laughs in my face how can i express the love of Christ there's someone who just stares at me with a blank look on their face matt has a young amen praise the Lord how can i express Christ that is what we're called to do instead we go and we go around and and I and Lord if I never want to say anything context and our contractors were but Lord why why do we always go around reaching trying to explain things to people instead of expressing we try to explain Christ the people said of expressing Christ the people stop all they're doing is creating confusion all you're doing is causing hardships show them who Christ is that's what we were called to do praise the Lord and that's what Stephen did up until the day the moment he died you know what you know why he did that because Paul was standing there if Stephen would have died without saying Lord laying out this charge upon him Paul would have been guilty of Stephens death but because Stephen said God forgive them as he died Paul was not charged with the death of Stephen how do you know but Stephen never got to stay around and see what happened to Paul he found out later on when Paul joined him on the other side but he never got sometimes you die and you cry forgiveness for the person who shot you down and you may never know what that will do for them you may never know you mean the people that knew Saul at that time had no idea what he was going to be because it's not up to us to decide someone's fate because if it was I wouldn't be here right now and neither would you so don't get all pious on me amen if we we need the Lord because he can see what's inside of you and we can't see it so how dare we pass judgment oh they're not on their toast even you know you said in the congregation you look at me but I had to look at your faces and sometimes you think they're not getting it they'll understand it then you just see time goes by and you say oh they work it they were understanding it because you don't know I don't know I don't know how's the time I don't even know you know you you have maybe have a good friend and and you know you're like hey are you alright man oh yeah I'm fine and they are fine but they have this look on their face right that nothing is fine and then but you know they're tired or whatever it is amen so we can't even we can't even figure our own selves out how dare we try to figure someone else out you know my wife can't stand I had this thing where I don't know when I'm hungry so I get hangry and she goes if you just eat we wouldn't have to deal with you I was like honey I just need you to tell me when I'm hungry praise the Lord Amen John chapter 8 John chapter 8 and verse 1 looked at Stephen who was not guilty of his chart Oh his death now we'll look at someone who was John chapter 8 verse 1 Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery when they had set her in the midst they say unto Him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayst I always wonder where the man was how somehow he got off scot-free this they said tempting him that they might have this is then that's what you get when you have man's judgment not God's this they said tempting him that they might have him might have to accuse him but Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they would heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest given unto the last and man the eldest started first because they lived longer and then they had the more of that wisdom and then to accept and they'd be eatin crow for a lot longer than the younger ones had and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee she said no man Lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more she was caught in the very act completely guilty of breaking the law they had every right to throw stones at her they had no right to throw stones at Stephen but they had every right to throw stones at her because Christ had not yet died on Calvary Jesus says you without sin you cast the first stone and that's what we're talking about this morning unmerited forgiveness if you think you can cast judgment then show me that you have no sin well the man who says we are not as Christians we are not sinners but Christians have sinned little things we do you know cuz of the flesh yet we we stand in judgment to seal the deal cast the stones break break them down we get so caught up in our anger amen like this this whole world is freaking out over this George Floyd thing perhaps that cop was caught in a fit of anger because that man said something to him and now look what he's paying for right then their anger they were ready to kill her take her out of the picture and God says okay you with other sin cast the first stone you can't do it there is time and place for correction but there is never a time a place for you to judge someone in or out love is corrective she was corrected the unspoken sometimes God doesn't have to say anything to you to use coming to his presence and you are corrected the unspoken between Jesus and that woman she was corrected here she is before this this this this holy man is she called him more she had respect for him here she is and there openly saying what she had done it was not hidden anymore and now she stands ashamed and corrected of what she done God says you're forgiven go and sin no more that's what God did for you and does for you you say God forgive me and he does it why are we so quick to turn and say we can't forgive them praise the Lord because where are your accusers now even when you stand and I'm just standing people accuse you and judge you a man but God comes rich in mercy and he asks you now where are your accusers I ask you now that all those sins that you've done that you had remitted where are your accusers that feeling of forgiveness that you felt when you made your life right with God I don't have to ask you to raise your hand cuz I know every single one of you would if you've been there wasn't that the best feeling in the world why wouldn't you want to give that same gift or someone else's why wouldn't you want to give that same gift to someone else amen go and sin no more bull mmm says in the quote waters of separation 1955 Isaac get to that there he says I went over it's a long quote I went over the little restaurant was closed so I just walked across the road to a common little drive-in place every what they call it and as I walked in the door there stood a policemen about my age don't be reading ahead of me brother Tim a man about 40 years old with his arm around a woman playing a slot machine and gambling is illegal in Ohio and there the law he says I thought what is this world coming to a man have you thought that don't lie you did it brethren everybody's afraid of Communists and everybody's afraid that Russia is going to come over Germany is going to come over don't be afraid of any nation whipping us they're not going to whip us were whipping ourselves our own morals is what's polluting us paragraph 19 there was a policeman to uphold the law standing there perhaps a married man with a bunch of children at home playing a slot machine I thought oh mercy I looked back at the back of a young waitress standing back there very vulgar vulgar Lee dressed and some boys half drunk with their arms around her doing things that ought not to be they ought not to do I thought oh my let me get out of here you ever felt that before ma'am and I happened to look to my right and there's had an old lady old enough to be my grandmother probably 65 or better you seen that yes she had on those foul clothes little short clothes and the purple looking stuff on her face and her toenails painted the same way poor old thing her skin was wrinkled and hanging her hair 'hard real clothes the blue looking color have you seen that and how did you feel God have mercy just get me out of here right and I thought isn't that terrible and sitting with two old men and them drunk one of them in summertime was a big R big army overcoat on and I said oh my I said God how can you stand it I said how why don't you wipe it off the face of the earth then I was sitting there thinking that and all of a sudden something struck me and the Lord said for me to sit down and I went oh sometimes the law has to tell you hey hey boy hey girl sit down shut up and I went over in a corner behind the door and started praying I thought Lord it looks like that you just simply tear the whole why will my little Rebecca and Sarah my two little girls have to be raised up here in the world under such as that oh maybe he did see it maybe he didn't but if he can only see it now I thought how can you stand it when it makes a sinner like me shiver to think of such a thing well I got back here on I saw a vision that changed my picture all together I mean that's what God does that's what I believe God is doing this morning if you can accept it as he's changing your picture he's saying look you you you what you're seeing you think is truth you think is the way it should be but I'm here Christ is saying I'm here to show you this is actually what it is well I got back there I saw a vision okay changed my picture altogether I've seen a world a turning and a notice around it was a streak like red all around and I wondered what it was and as I drew close I see myself as a boy and when I would sin well then I seen Jesus standing in front between me and God and his blood act as a bumper every time I do anything wrong it would hit him and he'd say Father forgive him he don't know what he's doing and I'd do something else in the know just like the bumper on a car to keep me God can't stand sin the day you sin you're gone that's all but the blood of Jesus was protecting me the wrath of God from me and my sin would catch it and he'd say Father forgive him he didn't know what he's doing and I looked at I said Lord is my sins treating you like that and the blood running down his face I looked crawled up a little closer and I seen a book there and my name was at the top all kinds of sin wrote on it and I said will you forgive me he touched his side and he wrote pardon thrown it over in the back behind him in the sea of forgetfulness and I said how I appreciate you Lord so is he seeing his sins being forgiven and you've you've seen your sins being forgiven and you you you thank God for your sins being forgiven and God turns around and says now I was willing to forgive you of your sins but you want to condemn her for her I say this morning you've been forgiven of your sins and you felt the freedom and deliverance but yet you'll turn around and catch judges all your brother or your sister and condemn them for their sin saying God forgive them lay not it lay it not to their charge you're not responsible for forgiving them for what they've done outside of you but for what they've done to you you could say God forgive them I forgive them and but the battle had a real turning around right there he says you know we're gonna see and he went and he stopped to walk up to the lady and he said hey can I talk to you for a second and she says oh I already have company and he goes not like that not like that where are you were you ever a Christian and she said yeah she had been a Christian and she taken the wrong row and she had two nice young ladies four daughters and here she was living like this and brother bantam letter to the Lord right there in that cafe I mean it's amazing what God can do through you when you're willing to Humble your own pride amen and pass out that forgiveness Genesis chapter 42 Genesis 42 verse 1 now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt Jacob said unto his sons why do you look one upon another and he said behold I have heard that there is corn in Egypt gets you down bitter and by for us from thence that we may live and not die and Joseph's 10 brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt but Benjamin Joseph's brother Jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest peradventure mischief befall him and the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came for the famine was in the land of Canaan and Joseph was the governor over the land and he he it was that sold to all the people of the land and Joseph's brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth and Joseph saw his brethren he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them whence come he and they said from the land of Canaan to buy food and Joseph knew his brethren but they knew him not knew not him and Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are come now I bring this example and when we'll finish the story because some were not perfect people and sometimes when we're called to pass on forgiveness we don't always do it the first time we we stew over it and we think about and so here's Joseph and we think about he begins to he sees his brother and instantly he ever he ever gone away and then you go back and you see someone for the first time in a couple of years that has done you wrong and you kind of moved on with your life and you forgotten and you see them because you never forgave them and suddenly something with and you just raises up and you're angry at them here's Joseph he's been years gone from Canaan gone through all kinds of things a Amen and here he is and then he sees them again and all those things come back all the offhand remarks and the smacks on the side of the head from his older brothers and and everything else that they did throwing him in the pit Amen telling him in the slavery and everything he went through because they did that to him begins to come up to his remembrance and he remembers Amen how he was shipped of his coat he remembers how how he was falsely accused by Potiphar's wife and now he had to go to prison and then in prison when he's given an opportunity that he's forgotten he's going through all these things all these these disease feelings of anger and resentment towards theirs brothers if you were Joseph well how would you feel when you saw them you're now raised in to a position of authority with the ability to get revenge he could have said they're spies and that could have been the innovator what would you do who would we do one of these days we'll all be rulers raised up to the right hand of God we have to learn here on earth how to rule Amen with the right amount of grace so Joseph was in turmoil he says they're spies he sends them off to prison and and then he feels bad so he gives him all their money back puts him back in the sacks and they go off and Joseph in his heart he knows his famines going to last seven years and he knows they're going to be back it's part of the story you have to fill in the blanks there he knows they're going to come back and so he says he says well you have to leave one guy here and bring me this other brothers you supposedly have you're just younger brother you supposedly have to prove to me you're not spies and so they leave they leave Simeon yes yep and so they go back and take upstairs in no way are you going to take Benjamin Simeon can rot in prison you're not taking Benjamin back but see this was a process that had to take place because God needed to bring them back right needed to bring this this thing together and so they run out of grain and they started getting me hungry and when you get hungry you get desperate and so will they go back amen and I didn't I didn't jot down the scriptures of the in between but you can go back and read it they go back and and they bring Benjamin and then they put the Benjamin the Joseph cup in Benjamin's sack after after having lunch with him and so they go after him and how dare you do all this amen but I skipped ahead here a couple of points I want to make so this anger is raised rising up within Joseph as he sees his brother before he sends him away or or while he's thinking about this you know they have to come back and simians in prison and that's a burden on his shoulders he he knows he probably shouldn't have done that and he's this is this all this is going through him and here here's the very people who unjustly ruined his life or did they this is the paradox of God he say up until Joseph had was up until Joseph was in the place that he can look back on his life excuse me look back on his life when he came out of the dark part and he was on the right hand of Pharaoh until he could look back he had no idea everything was happening to move him into a position greater than he ever thought right now maybe someone is is is is doing what Joseph's brothers did to him to you you have no way of looking into the future and seeing what's going to happen because of it but all things work together for good to those that love God you are called and chosen for this time Esther Esther for such a time as this Esther was stripped of her family raised by Mordecai taken from Mordecai put into the palace then she becomes Queen right now she can look back and she's in a place to make a decision Josef's in a place to make a decision in this look he looks back and and I believe I believe maybe at this point this is when Joseph began to look back and think about everything that had happened because he says in there that will will read it he begin to look back and everything that happened and begins to see how God's hand was in it all along the way people see what happens is people go to prison like Joseph spiritually speaking not actual prisons some of them do but and not actual prison then they go into a place something happens there unjustly or unfairly put in a position maybe by the way they were raised maybe they weren't shown the law that they needed they were put in a position and they say well how can God love me if he did this how Joseph said prison he could have said how can God love me and he puts me here and if he never went to win would have went to prison he would have never talked to the cupbearer and the bit butler the baker the butler and the Baker then he would have never got to be in front of Pharaoh people see we get to a place in life and we think we've arrived we're successful we've come to this place and then partisanship Oliver's wife comes around and you get knocked back down you think my goodness I had it made it's so unfair let that happen why am i here how could God love me you were raised by an abusive parent or or something happened he say well how could God love me if he'd like me to go through that you don't see your future you don't know what God's going to do I can see this this morning because I speak from experience I can't look back and I can say that darkness was for this purpose if I would have not been there and been low I would not be here today whom you pray for preachers because they preach the most effective when they preached from experience Amen so we have to go through things just like everyone else everyone goes through trials but even you can go through things maybe it's jut you go through that just so you can expect from experience you know unless you walk a mile in his moccasins even you whether you're a preacher a housewife a song leader a school girl a school boy just someone living their life notes no special place in the church oh lord have mercy what is that who cares about that I'm no special or more special than you are I'm a servant to the God's people you people need a position you already got a position you're a son and daughter of God you're a child of the king how much better could you ask for you ever you ever see somebody and you know their parents are millionaires my kind of if I was them right guess what you are them tonight you too you are them you're a child of the king you couldn't ask for a better position than to be a child of the king what does that mean why cos you're heir to the throne and all things all things in the kingdom are available to you healing deliverance everything praise the Lord so until you know until you get to a place where you can look back and see what God was doing Joseph he would have had no idea he speaks to the puzzler a little glimmer of hope that happens to us we see a glimmer of hope maybe this is it maybe this is our big break and then you forget forgotten the butler forgets you but it's because the time wasn't right if the Bella would have just went to Pharaoh and said hey there was this guy in the prison he interpreted my dreams you ought to give this man another chance who is this okay well pull him out of prison and we'll make him a slave instead over here in this in this house because he was a house slave right yeah I'm from Potiphar okay well make him a house slave over here in a story but God God world their world over created all famine so he could bring Joseph into position do you think the world around you is just unrelated to you you see the turmoil going on it's for you without it we can't get out of here that's the age-old thing you know people get all bold and they get anointed and they sit by god I'm gonna stand here and I'll give my life you know and at some points the gun at them and it's a different story right but you God will anoint you for the time I a little bit funny when I said that so God will anoint you for what you need but people say oh you know well this is what we want we want the world to fall apart and and then the people that are feeling but scared they feel like ashamed of themselves and they try to act like they're brave too look don't act brave don't pretend to be brave just become more like God that's all that you have to do because guess what this everything that's going on is for you look at it that way don't look at it like it has to happen and oh it's afraid because it's gonna be it has to get terrifying it to be the end no it has to get the way it does just for you so you can be elevated there had to come a famine so Joseph could be elevated there has to come a family in the world and death because so that you can be elevated to your position for the right hand of Pharaoh Genesis chapter 44 we pick up the story here in verse 30 44 verse 30 there's now if therefore when I come okay so he takes him and he says you know we're gonna we're gonna kill Benjamin because he stole the cup or something along those lines you forgive my ignorance there I don't remember the story completely at the moment but here is Reuben speaking they make sure it's ribbon Judah Judah is speaking and he says in verse three says now therefore when I come to thy servant my father and the lad or Benjamin be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life it shall come to pass when he say that the lad is not with us that he will die and thy servant shall bring down the gray hairs as I serve and our Father with sorrow to the grave for thy servant become surety became surety for the lad unto my father saying if I bring him not unto thee then I shall bear the blame to my father forever now therefore I pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lad at bond men to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren for how shall I go up to my father and the lad be not with me let's peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father chapter 45 and Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there should no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren and he wept aloud and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard and Joseph said unto his brethren I am Joseph tough my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were trouble at his presence and Joseph said unto his brethren come near to me I pray you and they came there and he said I am Joseph your brother whom ye sold into Egypt now if therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God that sent me before you to preserve life for these two years have the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be hearing nor harvest and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance God sent me before you a man Joseph being called of God finds forgiveness within him and when he finds that forgiveness he begins to find the will of God because guess what it's kind of the paradox of humanity right if you don't have forgiveness now there's something between you and God now you can't clearly see God's will but if you forgive now God's fear begins to move within you and you begin to see God's hand in the situation now you can turn around and help that very person who caused you pain and the freedom that Joseph must have felt when he forgave his brethren what profit is it to forgive someone who deserves it we read that in the Beatitudes in Luke you know what what good is it to to lend somebody something and an expected in return the sinners do that or and what good is it to give a love and went to someone who loves you the sinners even do that what good is it to forgive someone who deserves it because guess what that first of all first of all no one deserves forgiveness right you have to give that that's that's yours to give that's a power you hold t.c power without character is state tennis because the ability to forgive someone of the ability to have forgiveness to hand out is a power you hold how you use that power is what you'll be judged for praise the Lord then one last story here the musicians would come when most everyone knows who she is Corrie ten Boom if you haven't read her book it's I highly recommend it it's very moving story but she and her sister were were hiding Jews and they got caught and they were sent to the concentration camp and she watched her sister brutally abused she was brutally abused and she watched her sister die and she went on to survive the the concentration camps in World War two I think he was and she now was traveling all around the world speaking of her experience and how God preserved her life and and about forgiveness and she was speaking out somewhere and I think it was in Germany and she she got done speaking and she she's walking out of the the venue and a man steps in front of her with his wife and she recognized him she recognized him as one of the soldiers in the concentration camp and all that anger and resentment and pain and bitterness came back and she felt nothing good towards the man and he says he didn't know she recognized him he said I was one of those sought Nazi soldiers in this concentration camp you were in and you talked about forgiveness will you forgive me she said she ward within herself because she knew she was called by God to forgive him regardless of what she did what he did whether he deserved it or not she was called to hand him forgiveness the gift of forgiveness so she put her hand out she said it felt like a chunk of wood but as the soldier took her hand and she said I forgive you compassion and grace and love flowed through her and she forgave the man completely sometimes God asks us a lot of times God asks us to do stuff that we don't feel at the time we want to do we're upset or mad why do they treat me like that how could they do that to me we're upset god I mercy or upset see how can they go all those years doing that damage to me and to my family and not not even care say it's all my fault maybe you can't shake their hand [Music] but we are called to forgive them and you don't have to do it on your own God will give you the strength God will give you the power to say whether you have whether you get the chance to verbally say it or whether you just something in your heart you have to hand to them spiritually and say god I forgive me it's not gonna be layer of charcoal to forgive to forgive is to extend unconditional loving hand of God we have no problem saying we're God's children the miracles will come but then when it says we're God's children we have to forgive people turn around and walk don't be that person today forget unforgiveness as harbored in your heart is going to create bitterness and bitterness brother Branham says drives the Holy Spirit right out of your life don't let the root of bitterness take control if a root of bitterness has I challenge you this morning to hand out forgiveness we are the second books book of acts to the world are we gonna be like the Pharisees are you gonna be like Stephen and say father I lay not lay not discharged under them basically that's what it's all about saints of God there's some people in the world that will never get everything that we we have in their language maybe they'll never catch a revelation of the seals they never catch a revelation of of the Godhead but they catch a revelation that this is Christ they're gonna be there now as a American citizen speaking English you had that at your hands so when I tell you don't worry about that I don't mean don't ever worry about it don't worry about it right now all in good time will it come and then all in good time just serve God like I mentioned those friends I had they were part of my youth group they were part of my youth group they said you know what I prayed and just God never showed himself a little to me I had experiences and had anointings but it was never real to me they left too soon well we don't know the end of the story right but I know the end of the story just feed on the word don't and when i say feed on the word don't think you have to go get the seven seals if that's where you are please do but if you're not there yet if you don't know if god's real to you that's where you start you just pray we heard that about praying you know you don't just pray one once and then that's all you're allowed to pray that that lady she kept knocking on the judge's door keep knocking the Bible listen says knock twice and it shall be answered or he said to be opened unto you Bevell says knock Abraham and Sarah knock for 25 plus years before the promised son was given to them and you have a promise son who is Christ and he will be given to you if you persist because how do you know how do you know and I know that I I'm taking up too much time but how do you know how do we know that my friends we're not just that close how do we know we don't know that as a parent how do you know your child's not that close how do you know that that that's your forgiveness to someone won't save their life suicide is a real thing in the day and age that we live in I mean how do you know you they're too full of pride and they're paying for what they did but they can't bring themselves to talk to you so they're anointed of a devil to go take their lives but you give them forgiveness and use spirit you hold life in your hand the Bible says there's death and life in the power of the tongue we talk about how that can be gossiping or saying bad things about people but what it can be is is giving out forgiveness giving out praise and encouragement praise the Lord Amen you guys are pulling and I could just keep on preaching me but I'm not going to [Music] and praise the Lord let's bow our heads only father a lot of things were said this morning things that even I needed to hear Lord father you know each heart you know you know each one here that needs to hand out forgiveness father maybe they don't even know it maybe it's buried deep within them the place in the corner their heart they'd forgotten about Lord I pray that you would bring it to their remembrance Lord they could find in their heart forgiveness and lord I lift my hands and those that ever need us well we lift our hands to you and we ask father forgive them Lord in a private private place we can name them but now in your presence we say God you know who them are Lord father give us the strength to forgive them Lord give us a strength to to hand them forgiveness or and lo when the devil comes knocking and tries to bring those old feelings back up because they might never go away I mean in this life have a curse of memory we can't forget stuff like that Lord day when that devil comes knocking to bring us in remembrance of how they wronged us we say no that's not mine to accept anymore because I've forgiven [Music] thank you Lord Jesus thought it's your it's your grace Lord Jesus your mercy it's rewrote
