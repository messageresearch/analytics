[38:21] you know I hope you don't mind I just
[38:24] getting a little more blunt I guess as
[38:27] life goes
[38:28] uh today you know we're seeing our
[38:30] brother Bob come to the end of this
[38:32] natural life but you know as we singing
[38:35] the song it struck me you know the sky
[38:39] not the grave that's exactly and he
[38:41] could still be here and still be alive
[38:45] and take that trip amen but one thing we
[38:49] do know having known brother Bob for so
[38:51] many years uh he is ready amen he wants
[38:55] to just go on and the reward Lord that
[38:57] he has lived uh his I I think we can
[39:01] just say his whole life amen hallelujah
[39:05] and he's looking forward to that
[39:07] certainly we want to remember uh uh
[39:10] sister ulia this morning uh we just pray
[39:13] that um Lord would just grant to her an
[39:16] easy birth a healthy baby amen and uh uh
[39:20] we just we just really look forward to
[39:23] that amen amen so many things we would
[39:27] like to say but we have so little time I
[39:29] would like to speak to you this morning
[39:31] I uh sitting in a harvester for a lot of
[39:35] hours God bless you thank you sister via
[39:38] and or I don't know I always get it
[39:41] wrong violin they're not fiddles uh
[39:45] violins I know same thing but it's a
[39:47] spirit behind it and uh so uh uh anyway
[39:53] um just appreciate this and um you know
[39:57] just uh as I sat in the Harvester this
[40:01] last week uh I listened to the message
[40:05] uh leadership over and over again and I
[40:08] I already shared this with you but you
[40:11] know when I was searching through to
[40:13] find a message to listen to I I struck
[40:16] it because it was my birthday you know
[40:18] and what a reason to pick a pick a
[40:20] message but there was my birthday and I
[40:23] I just listened to it and I I started
[40:25] listening to it and I realized you know
[40:26] I didn't catch all of it so I went back
[40:28] and listened through it again and then
[40:30] you realize I didn't catch all of it you
[40:32] go back and listen through it you
[40:33] experience that amen where there's like
[40:35] a continual Loop of God speaking to you
[40:39] and uh so you know it uh it just just
[40:42] struck our heart today amen definitely
[40:46] we want to uh remember I know our
[40:49] brother darl Ward uh has shared a little
[40:52] of the testimony uh of going out amongst
[40:56] the people that in the hills of
[40:58] Tennessee and uh literally um they took
[41:03] a four-wheeler to carry
[41:05] resources uh people have no gasoline and
[41:08] if the roads were even fit to drive they
[41:10] have no gasoline for their cars because
[41:12] the storm disrupted everything and
[41:14] brother Daryl shared how that when you
[41:17] would show up with cases of water and
[41:20] some
[41:23] food humanity is the same I don't care
[41:26] if they're saved or
[41:27] not and grown-ups adults burst into
[41:31] tears because they feel
[41:34] forsaken amen now we understand brother
[41:37] brand brother brand taught us very
[41:40] clearly that there's always warning
[41:41] before judgment and America certainly of
[41:44] all Nations on Earth has had the warning
[41:47] that's exactly right and judgment will
[41:49] come that's exactly the Bible says so
[41:51] amen amen I want to speak to you on
[41:53] leadership this morning let's turn our
[41:55] Bibles to the Book of Genesis the 22nd
[41:57] chapter and uh sometimes God's
[42:00] leadership doesn't look like leadership
[42:03] in this case we'll see as we look into
[42:05] this actually it looks like a trial it
[42:08] looks like a struggle it looks like uh
[42:11] hard times it it doesn't uh speak to us
[42:14] in a sense that we would just say oh
[42:16] okay this is God's leadership I'll just
[42:18] step into this uh so as we start in
[42:22] verse one amen and it came to pass after
[42:25] these things that God did tempt
[42:28] Abraham
[42:30] my this wasn't just a hey I want to make
[42:33] a point to you it was a Temptation
[42:35] that's right said unto him Abraham and
[42:38] he said behold here I am and he said
[42:41] take now thy son thine only son Isaac
[42:44] whom thou lovest and get thee into the
[42:46] land of Mariah and offer him there for a
[42:49] burnt offering upon one of the mountains
[42:53] which I will tell thee of boy that
[42:56] should have popped a r flag right there
[42:58] right you what the promised son you want
[43:00] me to go kill
[43:02] him but look at this Abraham rose up
[43:06] early in the
[43:07] morning saddled his ass and took two of
[43:10] his young men with him and Isaac his son
[43:12] and clave the wood for the burnt
[43:14] offering and Rose up and went into the
[43:15] place of which God had told him then on
[43:19] the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes
[43:21] and saw the place a far off and he said
[43:24] unto his young men abide ye here with
[43:28] the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder
[43:31] and worship and come again to you
[43:35] Abraham took the word of the burnt
[43:36] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[43:39] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[43:42] knife and they went both of them
[43:44] together and Isaac spake unto Abraham
[43:46] his father and said my father and he
[43:48] said here am I my son and he said behold
[43:51] the fire and the wood but where is the
[43:54] Lamb for a burnt offering Abraham said
[43:58] my son God will provide Bo I tell you it
[44:01] just struck me this morning it came
[44:03] right out right here before us God will
[44:06] provide amen amen I thought that was a
[44:09] very special thing the Lord just allowed
[44:11] to come in that vein amen God will
[44:14] provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[44:16] offering so they went both of them
[44:18] together and they came to the place
[44:21] which God had told him of and Abraham
[44:24] built an altar and laid the wood in
[44:26] order and bound Isaac his son and laid
[44:29] him on the altar upon the wood and
[44:32] Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[44:35] took the knife to slay his son and the
[44:38] angel of the Lord called unto him out of
[44:40] heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he
[44:43] said here am I and he said lay not thine
[44:47] hand upon the lad neither do thou
[44:50] anything unto him for now I know that
[44:53] thou fearest God seeing thou Hast not
[44:56] withheld
[44:57] thy son thine only son from me and
[45:01] Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked
[45:04] and behold behind him a ram caught in a
[45:07] Thicket by his horns and Abraham went
[45:09] and took the RAM and offered him up for
[45:12] a burnt offering in the stead of his son
[45:15] and Abraham called the name of that
[45:18] place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this
[45:22] day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be
[45:25] seen Heavenly Father we come today just
[45:27] asking father guide our words our
[45:29] thoughts Lord there's so many Avenues so
[45:32] many things father to speak on but help
[45:35] us Lord to be focused today Lord in this
[45:38] time father as a gathering together of
[45:40] saints there's many needs in the body
[45:43] father many needs amongst the families
[45:45] Lord many families not here today but
[45:48] Lord we would ask you to focus us on the
[45:51] word father not on those things around
[45:54] us the peripheral oh Lord let us be
[45:57] faithful to lift one another up in
[45:59] prayer to be standing there Lord as the
[46:02] phrase is I've got your back Lord let us
[46:05] have the back of our brother sister
[46:07] father to raise them in prayer Lord not
[46:10] in criticisms and not in negative things
[46:12] Lord but uplifting prayer because Prayer
[46:15] Changes Things We ask you to bless this
[46:18] service today in the name of Jesus
[46:20] Christ amen am you may be seated
[46:30] as we would look at this
[46:31] today I just want to say thank you for
[46:34] those that were lifting us up in prayer
[46:37] as we were out of town
[46:39] harvesting um you know sometimes the
[46:43] trials seem so big the minute you pass
[46:45] through the trial you look and you
[46:47] realize that it really was not as great
[46:51] as we thought it was as we look at this
[46:54] scripture we see a very much of an
[46:56] emphasis here that God will provide
[47:00] everything my brother and sister that we
[47:02] as Christians uh have going on in our
[47:04] life we have to really stop and just
[47:07] look take a moment and look not to get
[47:09] so busy we don't stop and Ponder to
[47:12] realize what God has done for us and
[47:15] what he's doing every single day now we
[47:17] can focus on the natural and look at
[47:20] that and say you know what the Lord's
[47:22] done this this and this but let's not uh
[47:24] get caught up in the natural let's look
[47:26] at what God has done in our own lives
[47:29] how that he has brought us and he he's
[47:32] comforted us and given us strength and
[47:34] protected us and been our provision and
[47:37] every portion of that is a part of this
[47:39] experience and you know Satan would love
[47:42] for us to uh get so caught up in the
[47:44] Troubles of the day that we would not
[47:47] recognize the blessing of the day and uh
[47:51] if we're only thinking of the negative
[47:53] things then we will miss the very uh
[47:56] Beauty beauty that is right before us
[47:58] the beauty of the open word the beauty
[48:01] of reading our Bible and seeing
[48:03] something that we have not seen before
[48:05] something that that was there all the
[48:08] time but now it suddenly fits in place
[48:11] and and and we have to say thank you
[48:13] Lord for that because it is when that
[48:15] word is open to us my brother and sister
[48:18] when we see Revelation in the word it it
[48:21] is building us up God gives it to us to
[48:24] strengthen us and to encourage us and
[48:27] sometimes it corrects us and and we
[48:29] should say thank you Lord for the
[48:31] correction also amen it's not all just
[48:34] about God blessing us but it should be
[48:36] that we should rejoice in the correction
[48:39] of the word and when we uh can get into
[48:42] the word to receive whatever God speaks
[48:45] to us my brother and sister we're coming
[48:47] to the experience that Abraham had amen
[48:51] so as we look at this leadership is uh
[48:54] by short definition headship and
[48:57] guidance amen now we can look at
[49:00] leadership in a term of dictation to to
[49:04] say you will do this and you will do
[49:06] that or you don't do this or you don't
[49:08] do that but my brother and sister as we
[49:11] look through the word we'll realize
[49:13] headship is Christ leading us amen he is
[49:17] there giving us guidance he didn't just
[49:19] write it out some people would disagree
[49:21] with this but he didn't just write it
[49:23] out in a journal and then abandon you to
[49:25] try and find the way way to go but
[49:28] there's the Holy Spirit he said I'll
[49:29] send the comforter to you and when the
[49:32] comforter is with you there is the word
[49:34] in written form but the comforter is
[49:37] giving you insight into what you are
[49:39] reading and it starts to speak to the
[49:41] heart my brother and sister you know
[49:43] it's not just that we would look and
[49:45] want uh to have Revelation but my
[49:48] brother and sister Revelation is
[49:50] something that comes personal to you is
[49:53] there Collective Revelation yes but I
[49:55] would dare to say here today that there
[49:58] are many of us have slightly points not
[50:00] PS that matter for salvation but
[50:03] different points of view on different
[50:05] things of the scripture and God would
[50:07] reveal that to you because he
[50:09] personalized the word to you so we're
[50:11] not talking about doctrinal difference
[50:12] we're just talking about what it means
[50:15] to you amen now it's maybe a little
[50:18] harder we have young people born in the
[50:20] church raised up in the church Godly
[50:22] families they do not fully understand or
[50:25] comprehend the effect of sin in one's
[50:28] life amen they do not comprehend that
[50:30] and when the word being preached would
[50:32] talk about being forgiven from sins
[50:35] there will be those that their mind if
[50:37] they went back into time would look at
[50:40] things that they would not even want to
[50:42] speak in public amen and a young person
[50:45] filled with the Holy Ghost raised in the
[50:47] church amen their idea of sin would be
[50:51] that yes I I did this was tempted to
[50:53] tell a little lie and tempted to do this
[50:56] and yet yet we know of Brothers in
[50:58] different types and places that have um
[51:00] done Grievious crimes and God still
[51:03] saved them that's right you see my
[51:05] brother and sister it's not an exclusive
[51:07] message on the basis of who we are but
[51:11] it's an exclusive message on the basis
[51:13] of who he is amen so we say thank you
[51:16] because sometimes we get caught up in
[51:18] our little microcosm Our Little World
[51:21] there and we kind of tend to look at
[51:23] things and let's just look at Abraham's
[51:26] Journey just real briefly this morning
[51:28] we see Abraham how God starts to deal
[51:31] with him and you know they were Idol
[51:33] worshippers and and by transition we'll
[51:36] see that he takes a step and God deals
[51:39] with him and he takes another step and
[51:41] he separates himself from his family and
[51:43] you imagine you know I'm just going to
[51:45] embellish maybe a little bit but your
[51:47] family is just making millions off of
[51:49] producing idols and and you know the
[51:52] money and the ease of life and all of
[51:54] those good things and God comes one and
[51:56] says separate yourself my brother and
[51:59] sister God is not a respector of person
[52:02] rich or poor when he asks you to
[52:04] separate yourself amen there will be
[52:07] just like Abraham a time that you're
[52:09] coming to a great test amen a great
[52:13] temptation is there to like the Rich
[52:15] Young Ruler to justify well I give to
[52:18] the church and I support this and the
[52:20] orphanage and this and this and this but
[52:22] that isn't what God asked him to do God
[52:24] didn't say up your support for this or
[52:27] that God says sell all thy house give to
[52:29] the poor and follow me what was he
[52:31] looking for same thing with Abraham will
[52:35] you do what I ask you to do or will you
[52:39] reason it and you have I'll give more
[52:42] I'll double my tithe I'll double my
[52:44] offerings I'll do no God didn't ask him
[52:46] to do that amen so here it is we see
[52:49] Abraham's journey and you know the one
[52:52] thing that seemed to make so much sense
[52:54] I mean it's just very practical is that
[52:56] you know I have a nephew and you know he
[52:59] he's seeing you know he's seeing the
[53:01] message of the hour I'm going to take
[53:03] him along with me with him and and I'm
[53:05] going to encourage him but that isn't
[53:07] what God said he didn't say take your
[53:08] nephew he said you know separate
[53:10] yourself and you yourself go and you
[53:13] notice God never really blessed him
[53:15] that's right until he got to the point
[53:17] he did the word that's
[53:19] right God didn't suggest see the problem
[53:23] we have is too many people take the word
[53:25] of God the message of the hour the
[53:26] preaching of the word as suggestions
[53:29] God's not in the suggesting business my
[53:31] brother and sister amen so you look at
[53:35] this Abraham's Journey brings him to all
[53:37] the things you know he goes over denies
[53:40] his very marriage to his wife amen all
[53:43] of these little things that transition
[53:45] in his life and it's all part of a
[53:48] journey it's all part of God moving
[53:50] along I think it's wonderful my brother
[53:52] and sister when you see people that that
[53:55] uh God just saves them like right now
[53:57] and their life just 180 and everything
[54:00] changes and they're just pressing
[54:02] forward in the mark but I'll tell you
[54:04] because I can testify of my own life
[54:06] sometimes God just leads his poor
[54:08] children along amen he doesn't lead us
[54:11] out into the Wilderness but he's leading
[54:14] Us by our own resistance to full
[54:24] obedience the journey in the Wilderness
[54:26] my brother and sister was not God's
[54:29] idea it was man's idea because they were
[54:32] resistant to a full surrender to the
[54:34] word of God they compromised it and said
[54:37] but
[54:38] if and God said but if you won't receive
[54:42] and Obey I'll let you go until you want
[54:46] to imagine I know this sounds harsh
[54:49] forgive me imagine you get to see your
[54:52] grandparents who up to a certain point
[54:56] are are just so strong and
[54:58] healthy but denied the word yeah
[55:01] couldn't hear the voice that's right and
[55:04] it didn't in there though it'd be your
[55:06] lovely
[55:07] parents and they fall in the wilderness
[55:10] also and something starts to permeate
[55:13] their thinking and they start to realize
[55:15] God's serious about this do we believe
[55:18] God's serious about this amen it's
[55:20] Humanity that plays the game it's
[55:22] Humanity that explains it away it's
[55:25] Humanity that holds
[55:29] back I just read recently down Arizona
[55:32] there's a certain Trail a little more
[55:35] for dieh hard hikers than for for
[55:38] beginners and literally there's a spot
[55:40] in that trail where the trail comes to a
[55:44] ledge and the next step is out there say
[55:48] here to the Pew there's a little sign
[55:51] been posted there and says don't go
[55:53] beyond this unless you're committed
[55:56] right
[56:00] the guy writing this says you know I
[56:02] looked at that and I had to ask myself
[56:05] am I
[56:07] committed and when he looked out and
[56:09] everybody he was hiking with they come
[56:11] to that point and they said we're
[56:13] committed they got back and they took a
[56:15] run and they leaped over that and
[56:16] continued on the trail and he said they
[56:19] got out there a few feet and they said
[56:20] are you coming and he said 'I haven't
[56:22] decided yet and one of his own friends
[56:25] says
[56:26] why
[56:28] not what do you got to lose he walks
[56:33] up I got quite a bit to
[56:36] lose but the point being if you're
[56:38] committed and you put the effort into it
[56:40] it wasn't that hard to jump across the
[56:44] chasm commitment will get us across the
[56:47] chasm amen it won't be my brother and
[56:50] sister that we are fully committed and
[56:52] God brought us here to fail that's what
[56:54] Israel thought you brought us to the
[56:55] wilderness they told Moses you brought
[56:57] us to the Wilderness to let us die here
[57:00] but God never answered direct cuz he'd
[57:02] already spoken his word he didn't come
[57:05] and explain it to each one of them with
[57:06] a little pamphlet about how that this is
[57:09] how and this is how and no no he already
[57:11] had told them and they would not make a
[57:13] full commitment and they died in the
[57:15] wilderness blaming God and Moses amen
[57:18] that's right when the real test or trial
[57:21] was themselves that's right refusing to
[57:24] be fully committed that's right and so
[57:26] as we see this transition in Abraham's
[57:29] life he faces trial after trial God
[57:33] comes on the scene Time After Time Can
[57:35] someone say Amen to that amen that we
[57:38] see God coming amen uh time after time
[57:42] and we see this transition taking that
[57:44] place and look how patient God is stands
[57:48] before a king and says this is my
[57:52] sister
[57:53] technically could be a b basis of
[57:57] truth but the reality was it was his
[58:00] wife so he knew he was denying his own
[58:04] marriage vow that's right by disowning
[58:07] her H
[58:10] my but God still patiently moved him
[58:13] along so much that he speaks to a King a
[58:15] man whose word changes lives and
[58:18] kingdoms and whatever and says if you
[58:20] don't go apologize you're as good as a
[58:23] dead man what it looks like in human
[58:26] reasoning that should have been turned
[58:27] around and it should have been God
[58:29] chastising Abraham amen for Abraham to
[58:32] go apologize to the king I misled you
[58:35] but God so favored Abraham and teaching
[58:38] him the lesson that he says you know
[58:40] what king you apologize you are the one
[58:43] who is going to die in this equation and
[58:46] so what what was gaining Abraham's faith
[58:50] in God was gaining amen his courage was
[58:53] gaining amen maturity
[58:56] amen there won't be an immature
[58:58] Christian make it to Heaven that's
[58:59] exactly amen not half R God's not
[59:02] picking green apples amen you know
[59:05] there's something that God is going to
[59:07] do in your life in my life and that is
[59:10] he's going to put you through every
[59:11] trial every struggle there is until you
[59:14] decide I want to be a mature Christian
[59:17] Lord let me face the trial let me face
[59:19] the times in my life when I want to give
[59:21] up when I don't have unction enough to
[59:23] go forward Lord I want you to come
[59:26] and urge me forward but you realize
[59:28] sometimes the urging is not so
[59:32] peaceful it's not so
[59:34] calm God uses dire circumstances
[59:37] sometimes to move us along exactly amen
[59:40] so what's he doing he's bringing
[59:42] maturity by experience amen I say that
[59:45] fits perfectly to the day that we live
[59:47] in as Christians we are being brought
[59:49] into maturity as Christians by
[59:52] experience we're not in Flowery beds of
[59:54] ease God never said I promise you
[59:57] flowery beds of ease amen but he did
[59:59] promise US my brother and sister that
[1:00:01] when we get to that divide he'll be
[1:00:04] there for us that's one thing he
[1:00:06] promised amen and so what's happened you
[1:00:09] know when this thought come to me the
[1:00:11] other day of being
[1:00:12] seasoned the I I hope you have a sense
[1:00:16] of humor this morning sister Jerry had I
[1:00:19] don't remember what it was she might not
[1:00:21] remember either but she'd fixed
[1:00:22] something and she started to put a pinch
[1:00:24] in and put slightly bigger pinch and I'm
[1:00:28] eating supper and I'm like this stuff is
[1:00:30] spicy now you got to understand most of
[1:00:32] you would eat it you would eat it and
[1:00:34] say what's wrong with this it's because
[1:00:36] I'm a but you look at that and it
[1:00:39] struck me you know what we're being
[1:00:41] seasoned that's right amen through the
[1:00:44] trials and struggle of life God is
[1:00:46] seasoning us and we can press on and we
[1:00:49] can uh say that we're going to
[1:00:51] accomplish on our own but yet that seed
[1:00:53] Gene that God placed in US says you know
[1:00:55] what I don't have to do this alone I can
[1:00:58] trust the Lord to take the difference
[1:01:00] amen and give me the strength I need to
[1:01:03] press the battle to rise to the high
[1:01:06] calling in Christ Jesus amen this is
[1:01:08] what we come to the place I can do that
[1:01:10] I can be faithful in church I can have
[1:01:13] perfect attendance I can read my Bible I
[1:01:15] can do all of these things but after a
[1:01:18] while we'll find that there is something
[1:01:21] greater and God says just trust me amen
[1:01:24] just trust me go ahead step out out just
[1:01:26] like the little sign right there don't
[1:01:28] go beyond this point if you're not
[1:01:30] committed and that's coming into every
[1:01:32] Christian's life there's a point that we
[1:01:35] come to that we either turn back come on
[1:01:37] Saints we either turn back or we're
[1:01:40] committed amen amen Lord help me I want
[1:01:42] to be fully committed amen if I have to
[1:01:45] run H you know and and and maybe even
[1:01:48] have a little tinge of fear in my heart
[1:01:51] which this man in his little story says
[1:01:53] even as I leaped I thought Lord if I die
[1:01:56] let it be
[1:01:57] quick you know my brother and sister but
[1:02:00] we're not called to die we're not called
[1:02:04] to die we're called to rise in Christ
[1:02:06] Jesus amen eternal life no separation
[1:02:09] there for the bride for a real Christian
[1:02:12] there's no separation that second death
[1:02:14] my brother and sister that Eternal
[1:02:16] separation is not for you amen it's for
[1:02:20] the one who won't commit Lord help us to
[1:02:23] be committed amen amen
[1:02:26] so we become
[1:02:28] seasoned and we learn by mistakes see
[1:02:31] this is such a paradox in Christ we
[1:02:34] learn by our
[1:02:37] mistakes and we also learn by what we do
[1:02:42] correctly
[1:02:43] right
[1:02:45] so Satan puts a magnifying glass on the
[1:02:49] mistake absolutely lays a page over
[1:02:53] those things done correctly
[1:03:01] right magnify the
[1:03:07] mistake but God edifies those things
[1:03:10] that we do correct
[1:03:12] amen now this would probably sound
[1:03:15] awkward today if I was standing here
[1:03:18] preaching this sermon and I was
[1:03:23] perfect that wouldn't mean I'm only
[1:03:25] preaching to you
[1:03:27] yeah that's
[1:03:28] right but I'm preaching to me
[1:03:33] amen because well I don't know if I'd
[1:03:36] have courage enough to tell you all the
[1:03:38] mistakes I've made in my
[1:03:40] life
[1:03:43] amen but I can tell you with firm
[1:03:47] confidence that what God has done in my
[1:03:50] life amen is Supernatural it's
[1:03:53] incredible amen and in
[1:03:56] credulous something that could be
[1:03:58] shouted from the
[1:03:59] rooftop and you know what's happening it
[1:04:02] seems like now follow me here it seems
[1:04:06] like I'm making more mistakes than
[1:04:11] ever but when I stop and I look back I
[1:04:16] realize in Jesus Christ I've risen to
[1:04:19] height that I've never been before amen
[1:04:23] what's happening is is this Narrows down
[1:04:25] my brother and sister what we used to
[1:04:27] think was no big deal bothers us now
[1:04:31] that's right the things that we used to
[1:04:33] just say oh God understands we're now
[1:04:36] saying Lord forgive me for that thought
[1:04:37] forgive me for that deed forgive me for
[1:04:39] that that's why it seems like you're
[1:04:41] making more mistakes is because God has
[1:04:43] taken the blinders off of us and we're
[1:04:45] now coming what into Perfection amen
[1:04:49] it's no longer that we're just close is
[1:04:51] close enough but now we're being brought
[1:04:53] into the stage the time of perfectionate
[1:04:56] it' be different for different lives but
[1:04:59] what we do know is the life is there
[1:05:01] bringing us into Perfection will we be
[1:05:04] perfect In the Flesh no sorry this flesh
[1:05:07] will bother you as long as you're on
[1:05:09] this Earth this flesh will bother you
[1:05:12] amen anybody want to be seasoned you I
[1:05:16] want to be seasoned absolutely amen I
[1:05:19] want the word to come and touch me in
[1:05:22] every aspect of my life amen I don't
[1:05:25] want one portion for God to say oh I'll
[1:05:27] let that slide I want to be seasoned to
[1:05:31] stand and know who I am what I am in
[1:05:35] Jesus Christ amen so we look at that
[1:05:39] he's there he he's being seasoned he's
[1:05:41] being corrected his mistakes are being
[1:05:45] pointed out to him I'd say it look
[1:05:47] pretty familiar to us right each one of
[1:05:49] us are coming to a place we're starting
[1:05:51] to recognize God is doing something
[1:05:53] Supernatural it's not just oh I believe
[1:05:55] the message for this long it's not just
[1:05:58] that we've been in this church for so
[1:06:00] long or I've held this certain office
[1:06:02] for a period of time but it's a personal
[1:06:04] relationship which is irrelevant of
[1:06:07] office amen amen absolutely irrelevant
[1:06:10] of office exactly right you see God
[1:06:12] didn't just let brother brandham just go
[1:06:14] on with his mistakes he made him correct
[1:06:17] them and one thing I always Marvel about
[1:06:19] is the fact he wasn't bashful about
[1:06:22] telling you and I that he made the
[1:06:24] mistake and how God dealt with him
[1:06:26] amen now what that do make us look down
[1:06:29] on that oh I'm sorry maybe we're cut out
[1:06:31] of a Different Cloth but I look up at
[1:06:34] that and say my he could have no one on
[1:06:36] Earth would have known that but he
[1:06:38] himself and in the one case his wife no
[1:06:41] one would know that he could just put it
[1:06:43] under the covers and that would just go
[1:06:45] away but what does he do he exposes it
[1:06:47] he puts it right out there in the open
[1:06:49] and you know why he did cuz God was
[1:06:51] thinking of me amen and you that's right
[1:06:54] amen that we would recognize we are and
[1:06:57] God's got Grace right there for every
[1:07:00] mistake that's right amen this is real
[1:07:03] leadership that's right amen not
[1:07:05] dictation my brother and sister this is
[1:07:07] leadership God coming back wherever we
[1:07:10] veered off the trail he doesn't yell
[1:07:12] back at us turn right he comes back and
[1:07:17] takes us through that hard time that
[1:07:21] Rocky
[1:07:23] place now look at this I need to move
[1:07:26] along Abraham had come to these places
[1:07:29] in his life we all know the
[1:07:31] story under such
[1:07:33] headship but right in the season that he
[1:07:36] comes under such headship it's not far
[1:07:38] back on the page when you realize he's
[1:07:41] still making mistakes amen right let's
[1:07:44] separate the flesh man that's right from
[1:07:47] the spiritual man right let's quit
[1:07:50] letting the flesh man lead us that's
[1:07:53] right amen the flesh man's only God
[1:07:55] leadership of a flesh or carnal world
[1:07:58] that's right but the spiritual man's got
[1:08:00] the leadership of Jesus Christ amen amen
[1:08:04] who learned obedience by the things he
[1:08:07] suffered that's right so he didn't just
[1:08:09] say just do what I say he said do what I
[1:08:12] did amen are you with me amen so he
[1:08:15] could come back and say I was tempted of
[1:08:18] every Temptation and we stand here and
[1:08:20] say well that's good he was Jesus Christ
[1:08:22] he could say but my brother and sister
[1:08:24] his flesh would tell you I suffered in
[1:08:27] that occasion I suffered in that time or
[1:08:29] season of my
[1:08:31] life amen it's not just
[1:08:36] words cuz you see in the right position
[1:08:38] we can write
[1:08:40] words that would impossible for our
[1:08:42] fellow man to follow
[1:08:46] right easy to write
[1:08:48] those and expect someone else to live
[1:08:52] what maybe we ourselves struggle
[1:08:57] I love military history miss our sister
[1:08:59] Sue today she's given me a whole Library
[1:09:01] full of military
[1:09:05] history many wars my brother and sister
[1:09:08] needlessly people suffered because
[1:09:11] someone far away was able to pin words
[1:09:15] that could not be
[1:09:17] fulfilled but our lord Jesus the words
[1:09:20] were pinned amen and he pinned them or
[1:09:24] had them pinned from his own
[1:09:28] experience and he overcame every
[1:09:30] Temptation every trial every devil every
[1:09:34] circumstance but it even according to
[1:09:38] scripture brought obedience in him amen
[1:09:40] through those trials what was it there's
[1:09:43] a lot of ways to diagram or describe
[1:09:46] that obedience by brother and sister but
[1:09:49] you could put it in a simple term he
[1:09:50] learned obedience in other words he knew
[1:09:53] for a fact it was possible
[1:09:55] for you filled with the Holy Ghost to
[1:09:58] overcome that trial absolutely he wasn't
[1:10:01] giving that to the caral man he was
[1:10:04] talking to Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:10:07] he could then pin or have that word
[1:10:09] pinned in such a fashion you can do this
[1:10:14] sir because I've done it and if I am in
[1:10:16] you and you are in me and we are one the
[1:10:19] word amen it's possible that's it that's
[1:10:23] word let's not get into the the carnal
[1:10:25] man realm intellectual where by
[1:10:28] intellectual words we say if you're a
[1:10:30] Christian you can this if you're a
[1:10:31] Christian you can that if you're a
[1:10:33] Christian you should this if you're a
[1:10:34] Christian you should that my brother and
[1:10:36] sister this is a battle of flesh and
[1:10:39] blood but we also have the spirit of
[1:10:42] Christ the Holy Ghost in us to lead us
[1:10:45] through the trial Amen to bring us to
[1:10:48] the place we should cuz if we're looking
[1:10:50] for perfection in the flesh Abraham's
[1:10:52] out that's it wait Moses is out that's
[1:10:55] right oh my David's definitely gone
[1:10:57] that's right the apostles done right see
[1:11:01] it's something more that's it amen it's
[1:11:04] a life that's on the inside that's
[1:11:06] bringing the outside into
[1:11:08] subjection Hallelujah right exactly amen
[1:11:12] but look at this let me move on Abraham
[1:11:15] had come under such headship when God
[1:11:18] spoke to him he didn't even argue didn't
[1:11:20] even ask for an exilation now I'm
[1:11:22] telling you my brother and sister that's
[1:11:24] incredible because
[1:11:25] God speaks to you and says take your son
[1:11:28] on the mountain and kill him whoa whoa
[1:11:31] whoa whoa whoa Lord this is a promised
[1:11:33] son and uh there's been a mistake that's
[1:11:36] for the
[1:11:38] neighbor but Abraham had come under such
[1:11:41] subjection to the headship or the
[1:11:44] leadership of the holy spirit that God
[1:11:46] speaks to him says take your son offer
[1:11:48] him as a
[1:11:50] sacrifice now my brother and sister it's
[1:11:52] obvious I say this in a little bit in
[1:11:53] humor but truth it's obvious he didn't
[1:11:56] explain this to his
[1:11:59] wife because by morning that son would
[1:12:03] have been hidden so well he could never
[1:12:05] find him that's right see sometimes God
[1:12:09] just deals in his own way that's and he
[1:12:12] knew amen but look this turns prophetic
[1:12:15] do do you realize this turns prophetic
[1:12:18] it's no longer an angel of God it's no
[1:12:20] longer God himself speaking to Abraham
[1:12:23] but they come in the journey to the
[1:12:25] mountain and they're standing there at
[1:12:27] the mountain and he's telling the two
[1:12:28] young Lads you guys wait
[1:12:32] here simple hidden words of
[1:12:36] Prophecy the lad and I are going to go
[1:12:39] to the mountain and worship and we will
[1:12:43] return
[1:12:44] here amen knowing the whole time God's
[1:12:48] expecting him to kill his son but
[1:12:51] Abraham maybe not even realizing it
[1:12:53] maybe he just thought it was words but
[1:12:56] he says we will return amen oh my
[1:12:58] brother and sister do you realize I'm
[1:13:00] not trying to get way off on a limb here
[1:13:02] if you could really go back in your own
[1:13:05] life and realize the words that God has
[1:13:08] anointed you to speak and you didn't
[1:13:10] even realize that they were
[1:13:13] prophecy
[1:13:16] right we're just we're just conversation
[1:13:19] we
[1:13:21] think
[1:13:24] amen so what's what's Abraham do he
[1:13:26] collects all the resources young men the
[1:13:29] wood a
[1:13:31] knife and he heads to the mountain no
[1:13:34] explanation to the why for anyone around
[1:13:36] him but you know along the journey Isaac
[1:13:38] had been raised right amen he knew it's
[1:13:42] not just knowledge head knowledge my
[1:13:44] brother and sisters one thing that
[1:13:45] serves us good amen but Isaac knew how
[1:13:50] the
[1:13:51] function of of the offering worked he he
[1:13:54] hadd been well schooled and he's walking
[1:13:57] along with his dad and he says Hey Dad
[1:13:59] um we've got wood and we've got
[1:14:03] fire but where is the
[1:14:07] offering the
[1:14:14] sacrifice well now son I have to explain
[1:14:17] this to you that the Lord spoke to me
[1:14:19] and um you're dying up on the
[1:14:22] mountain I thought that TR through you
[1:14:26] that people be be as great as the Sands
[1:14:29] of the seashore but maybe that was a
[1:14:34] misinterpretation of
[1:14:36] what was
[1:14:37] spoken maybe we missed an
[1:14:41] understanding no my brother and
[1:14:43] sister Abraham had a personal
[1:14:47] experience and that personal experience
[1:14:50] was so personal when God had told him
[1:14:53] that your son through your son will be a
[1:14:56] people as great as the Sands of the
[1:14:58] seashore Abraham believed
[1:15:01] him come on Saints it's about time for
[1:15:03] us to trust God Amen what he says he
[1:15:07] will do we don't need the devil to
[1:15:09] explain it away where we're afraid to
[1:15:12] run and jump over the chasm amen you
[1:15:15] could be there and say you know what uh
[1:15:18] maybe somebody's fallen and got hurt and
[1:15:20] I'm not going to add my name to their
[1:15:21] list I'm turning back my brother and
[1:15:23] sister it is not so amen when we believe
[1:15:27] the word amen if you're committed you
[1:15:30] can do it amen if you're not committed
[1:15:32] maybe it's time to turn back it might
[1:15:34] sound like I'm encouraging people to
[1:15:36] quit serving God well my brother and
[1:15:38] sister if you're going to serve him
[1:15:39] half-heartedly amen you maybe ought to
[1:15:41] just quit for a while and when you get
[1:15:44] tired of being miserable and unhappy
[1:15:46] maybe you can come back because we serve
[1:15:48] a patient God he'll come back and say
[1:15:50] you ready for the rest of the journey
[1:15:52] now yes Lord I'm ready for the rest the
[1:15:55] journey cuz I realize the spirit of
[1:15:58] leoda now look I I'm I'm sorry you know
[1:16:01] sometimes people don't understand this
[1:16:02] but a as a farmer to our visitors I rub
[1:16:06] shoulders with a lot of people who are
[1:16:08] quite well off and think they're quite
[1:16:11] important and in that realm right there
[1:16:14] you hear all kinds of things and very
[1:16:18] few people would question them because
[1:16:19] you're talking about you're dealing with
[1:16:22] carinal here the man with the money
[1:16:25] and he can say kind of what he wants and
[1:16:27] people just kind of I don't even bother
[1:16:29] to nod my head I don't want it to be
[1:16:31] perceived that I agree with them in any
[1:16:33] form or
[1:16:35] fashion amen you know sometimes you have
[1:16:38] to
[1:16:40] like flesh you are not going to
[1:16:43] agree and there's where Satan gets in is
[1:16:47] because we find
[1:16:48] ourselves by
[1:16:50] agreement or lack of resistance
[1:16:55] and we get ourselves caught up in things
[1:16:56] we say how did this happen because by
[1:17:00] action we
[1:17:02] agreed are you following
[1:17:06] me so he comes answers his son God will
[1:17:11] provide Jehovah
[1:17:13] Gyra amen this is the kind of uh
[1:17:17] confidence we need in God today it's a s
[1:17:21] whatever you know it' be I remember a
[1:17:24] man one time a little story I read that
[1:17:26] there was a man criticizing what did
[1:17:28] your God ever do and the man finally had
[1:17:31] enough of that and he turns back to the
[1:17:32] guy and says well what did your God ever
[1:17:35] do for
[1:17:36] you and he said I ask you first and he
[1:17:39] said when I was a a drunk and a heathen
[1:17:42] just like
[1:17:43] you you know one of our problems is is
[1:17:45] we always put on the little cotton soft
[1:17:47] fluffy gloves when we deal with
[1:17:49] heathens
[1:17:51] amen I know a brother personally how he
[1:17:55] come to serve God was a fellow coworker
[1:17:59] looked at him one day got tired of
[1:18:00] hearing this guy's criticisms of what he
[1:18:03] believed in the Bible and whatever and
[1:18:05] that and he just told him blunt straight
[1:18:08] up he said you know the day will come
[1:18:12] you'll beg God to hear the words I'm
[1:18:14] telling you again because in your
[1:18:15] present State you're going to hell the
[1:18:18] man said how dare you say that that's
[1:18:20] insulting oh telling me my God is a
[1:18:23] phony my God is a liar my God is that's
[1:18:27] not
[1:18:29] insulting you're going to hell if you
[1:18:31] don't change amen the man the testimony
[1:18:34] on that the man went home that night now
[1:18:36] that sounds too harsh we always want to
[1:18:38] put on the little fluffy gloves to deal
[1:18:40] with the unbeliever but if they're a
[1:18:42] real son or daughter of God it'll be God
[1:18:44] that deals with him not you it's not
[1:18:46] your words the man laid in bed half of
[1:18:49] the night and said I'm going to
[1:18:52] hell cuz something in there struck him
[1:18:55] truth down in his heart that he knew he
[1:18:57] was a liar and a fornicator and a this
[1:19:00] and a that my he knew it and he's there
[1:19:02] in bed at night and he's like I'm going
[1:19:04] to hell he was a young man didn't have a
[1:19:06] family in toop I'm going to
[1:19:09] hell went back to work the next day and
[1:19:12] said how are you going to miss hell and
[1:19:14] he said glad you asked amen amen because
[1:19:19] God's got a provided way for every
[1:19:21] individual and here's Abraham amen he's
[1:19:24] there he's put in a quandry I'm taking
[1:19:26] my son my only son amen a promised son
[1:19:30] I'm taking him to the top of the
[1:19:31] mountain and I'm going to kill him amen
[1:19:34] now let me tell you brother and sister
[1:19:36] Jehovah Gyra is not a
[1:19:39] phrase It's a
[1:19:41] reality it's a word it's living amen
[1:19:47] hallelujah amen it's a living promise
[1:19:50] amen now see you got to understand the
[1:19:52] context
[1:19:55] this is stunning when you think about
[1:19:57] it here's
[1:19:59] Abraham under an initial word from
[1:20:03] God Amen Audible
[1:20:06] Voice
[1:20:08] commandment he's going up the
[1:20:10] mountain and as he's going up the
[1:20:12] mountain he actually has murder in his
[1:20:16] heart you realize it he's going to
[1:20:18] fulfill this commandment he's taken his
[1:20:21] only son up the mountain he's got that
[1:20:24] now just let me embellish if you don't
[1:20:26] mind he probably once in a while touched
[1:20:28] that knife he knew exactly what was
[1:20:31] going to happen he knew my brother and
[1:20:33] sister that this son that's walking
[1:20:35] beside him strong brother Bram says
[1:20:37] about 12 or so years old and he he
[1:20:40] walking strong I mean my how proud we
[1:20:43] can be of a son at 12 years old my own
[1:20:46] son was driving semis and tractors and
[1:20:48] loaders and everything at 12 years old
[1:20:51] and my brother and sister he's there and
[1:20:53] he's coming I'm going to ful fill the
[1:20:55] word of God God told me I must slay my
[1:20:57] son and as he's getting closer to the
[1:20:59] deal something had settled down in his
[1:21:02] heart and you can see this was what
[1:21:04] would it take for a man to draw back a
[1:21:06] knife and kill his
[1:21:10] son not in
[1:21:12] anger but to fulfill a commandment
[1:21:15] that's
[1:21:17] right no wonder there are some of these
[1:21:20] Fanatics out here do things they get so
[1:21:22] consumed in their thought a Abraham
[1:21:25] would have been one of them and God saw
[1:21:28] the
[1:21:29] resolve that he had at the same time I
[1:21:33] promise you that Abraham's heart was
[1:21:35] breaking
[1:21:37] amen and he has drawn Back the Knife and
[1:21:40] is starting to plunge that to his son
[1:21:43] and God speaks to him again and said
[1:21:46] just a
[1:21:48] test just a test now I know that's it
[1:21:53] that you'll serve me that's right now I
[1:21:56] know that I can trust you I want to know
[1:21:59] my brother and sister forget about your
[1:22:00] son will you plunge the knife of the
[1:22:02] word into your own heart that's
[1:22:05] it will you follow him enough that you
[1:22:07] would actually sacrifice your flesh oh
[1:22:12] don't get offended at me this morning
[1:22:13] I'm preaching to Paul amen amen I'm
[1:22:16] preaching to myself my brother and
[1:22:17] sister because there's times that I'm
[1:22:19] fully reminded that I am a flesh man
[1:22:23] that's right amen fully reminded of my
[1:22:25] shortcomings in Jesus Christ but look at
[1:22:28] this my brother and sister it was
[1:22:30] shocking when you think about it fully
[1:22:32] committed to kill his
[1:22:34] son but remember the
[1:22:38] prophecy hidden in such simple words
[1:22:41] that's right the lad and
[1:22:44] I will go
[1:22:46] worship you see he told the whole thing
[1:22:49] that's exactly he told it all out right
[1:22:52] there we're going to go to the mountain
[1:22:55] he had no idea what he was saying that's
[1:22:57] right we're going to go to the mountain
[1:22:59] and we're going to worship and we're
[1:23:02] going to return what what brought him
[1:23:04] into that place of worship full
[1:23:07] obedience that's it to the word that's
[1:23:09] right if he'd had anything left less
[1:23:12] than full obedience he would have said
[1:23:14] yeah I'll talk to you in a
[1:23:16] minute now what was it you had to save
[1:23:19] to me that's how most of us respond to
[1:23:21] God Amen Lord right after I've done all
[1:23:24] these things that I've determined I'm
[1:23:26] going to
[1:23:27] do I'll come back and talk to you about
[1:23:30] what it is you were trying to tell me
[1:23:32] amen no amen what God wants is that
[1:23:36] instantaneous amen connection that's it
[1:23:39] he speaks we respond that's right amen
[1:23:43] that's right because if we don't respond
[1:23:45] we just killed our own son y think about
[1:23:48] it that way now I don't want to put too
[1:23:50] heavy a burden on you today but I'm
[1:23:52] telling you my brother and sister
[1:23:53] there's been many a time that God wanted
[1:23:55] to speak to us amen we were too busy to
[1:23:58] listen
[1:23:59] amen now put that over in the natural
[1:24:02] after the knife was buried in Isaac to
[1:24:05] say now Angel of the Lord what did you
[1:24:08] have to
[1:24:11] say
[1:24:12] Amen now maybe there was a little
[1:24:14] personal understanding in there maybe
[1:24:16] Abraham thought I'll slay my son there
[1:24:19] will literally be the blood the life is
[1:24:21] in the blood I'll slay my son and God
[1:24:23] will Super naturally come and raise him
[1:24:26] back up
[1:24:29] again and he was going up there on that
[1:24:31] mindset yep that's what God's going to
[1:24:32] do I'll slay my son I'll have his the
[1:24:35] blood will be on the altar his blood
[1:24:36] will be on me and then God will raise
[1:24:38] him back up because this promise sand
[1:24:41] sand of the sea Shores has to come to
[1:24:44] pass but God said no all I want to know
[1:24:47] is if you'll really do it now some
[1:24:50] explain it way different ways but my
[1:24:53] brother and sister if that's hand was
[1:24:55] already being
[1:24:58] driven and God
[1:25:00] speaks he stops God says I know I can
[1:25:04] trust
[1:25:05] you you want to know I want to know my
[1:25:09] brother and sister God can trust me
[1:25:11] that's right I think every one of us
[1:25:13] should come to a place or be willing to
[1:25:15] come to a place in our life that we are
[1:25:17] so committed to God that we know by
[1:25:19] revelation God would trust us amen as
[1:25:23] ministers we have to come there's a lot
[1:25:26] that preach otherwise but we need to
[1:25:28] come we have to come to a place that
[1:25:30] when we handle the word of God we know
[1:25:33] God trusts us with this
[1:25:45] word let us hurry
[1:25:48] on you know it's easy to forget God's
[1:25:50] promise in the midst of the battle
[1:25:57] in the midst of tying your son up laying
[1:25:59] him on the wood that you made him pack
[1:26:00] up the
[1:26:02] mountain you have the knife in your hand
[1:26:05] be pretty simple forget the
[1:26:11] promise but you see my brother and
[1:26:13] sister if you don't catch anything else
[1:26:15] out of today please catch
[1:26:19] this God's
[1:26:22] promises you hear people say well God
[1:26:24] promised and it's not coming to pass I'm
[1:26:28] not seeing my healing I'm not seeing
[1:26:30] Deliverance I'm not seeing salvation for
[1:26:31] children or a
[1:26:35] spouse I'm not seeing it do you realize
[1:26:38] a promise of God has to be Revelation to
[1:26:42] you amen that's right we have
[1:26:44] Revelations of the godhead and the seals
[1:26:46] and the church ages and and all of these
[1:26:48] things we have Revelations but how about
[1:26:51] you go to a place and approach God that
[1:26:54] his promise to your life my brother and
[1:26:56] sister is a
[1:26:58] revelation not just words on a page
[1:27:00] anybody can ink words on a page but how
[1:27:03] come they don't come to pass is because
[1:27:06] they left them on the page that's right
[1:27:08] and when they pull them off the page and
[1:27:10] it becomes Revelation to them amen I
[1:27:13] amen I I'll be filled with the Holy
[1:27:15] Ghost because the word says so
[1:27:20] amen it's not Christ in your head no
[1:27:24] that's right that's Christ having
[1:27:26] Liberty in the whole
[1:27:28] body he wants more than just your head
[1:27:32] and people say well I gave him my
[1:27:35] heart well from the
[1:27:40] abundance amen that same heart you gave
[1:27:43] away is still got its own opinion yeah
[1:27:46] follows the word when it's comfortable
[1:27:48] and doesn't follow it when it isn't
[1:27:49] comfortable that's right follows the
[1:27:52] word when it needs to follow it and
[1:27:54] doesn't follow it when everything's
[1:27:58] good
[1:28:05] amen my I didn't realize I had near this
[1:28:08] much

[1:28:18] us will you trust me that's it if
[1:28:22] there's no other test that you have in
[1:28:24] your
[1:28:26] life don't take this as all inclusive
[1:28:29] but no other test that you've had in
[1:28:31] your
[1:28:32] life pass the test that God will trust
[1:28:35] you amen do whatever it
[1:28:38] takes that God would look at you and say
[1:28:42] that is my son that is my daughter and
[1:28:48] this is what they
[1:28:51] believe amen got some other things some
[1:28:54] quotes but I just feel Amen to just stop

[1:29:22] and saying you know I've seen some
[1:29:24] people that weren't worth 5 cents and I
[1:29:26] saw God turn them into Saints and I
[1:29:29] witnessed how their lives changed and I
[1:29:31] witnessed what they did and I witnessed
[1:29:33] this and this and this but how about we
[1:29:36] have a testimony that I wasn't worth 5
[1:29:39] cents amen and God changed me and turned
[1:29:42] me from a sinner to a saint that's it

[1:29:48] the
[1:29:50] Judgment so much the witnesses saying

[1:30:29] stop and you say I Heard a Voice tell me
[1:30:33] this if it's contrary to the word it

[1:30:40] voice comes to the word that's right my
[1:30:43] brother and sister there's where we want
[1:30:45] to live we want to live at the point
[1:30:48] that God's voice takes us right back
[1:30:52] right here this this is what the voice
[1:30:54] told me to do
[1:30:56] amen amen amen and last but not least
[1:30:59] we've heard this story so many
[1:31:02] times how did that Ram get missed in the
[1:31:06] first
[1:31:08] place my brother and sister Our God's a
[1:31:11] supernatural God Amen while Abraham's
[1:31:14] working his way through all of that God
[1:31:17] just creates a ram places him right
[1:31:19] there in the
[1:31:21] bush God's provided
[1:31:25] amen amen Jehovah Gyra is here today
[1:31:28] amen I want to ask you what's your need
[1:31:31] that's it have you in all sincerity ask
[1:31:34] God to provide it it because you see my
[1:31:37] brother and sister he's in the providing
[1:31:39] business sir and he will provide
[1:31:41] everything that we need to fulfill his
[1:31:46] promise that's right you see God's not
[1:31:48] going to come down my brother and sister
[1:31:51] and always place it in your hand
[1:31:54] right
[1:31:55] sometimes you have to pursue it that's
[1:31:59] right you have to step out and say Lord
[1:32:03] I want to live a holy life I want to
[1:32:06] live a life that is more of witness of
[1:32:09] who you are not a witness of
[1:32:12] success got lots of witnesses you hear
[1:32:16] people sometimes now this is just a
[1:32:18] little slight moment of event you hear
[1:32:20] people sometimes come back who should
[1:32:22] know better and say well you know we
[1:32:24] just got this big thing here and I made
[1:32:26] all this money from it praise God God's
[1:32:29] blessing me but what about those over
[1:32:32] here that are living paycheck to
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:39] paycheck let's not misinterpret the word
[1:32:42] Lord change our thinking Amen to fit
[1:32:45] your word amen amen God bless you today
[1:32:48] hopefully I I didn't confuse anyone I
[1:32:50] prayed this morning that my thoughts
[1:32:52] would not confuse anyone
[1:32:54] amen so I just pray that it's there
[1:32:58] let's just stand sing a song or two
[1:33:00] before we would
[1:33:02] dismiss this song trust and Obey 529
[1:33:05] come to me this morning while I was
[1:33:08] wrapping up my studies that it really
[1:33:11] comes down we just got to trust
[1:33:14] him and I think we should be bold enough
[1:33:17] to ourself to ask ourselves do I really
[1:33:19] trust
[1:33:20] God if God told me to sell all I have
[1:33:25] that's it could I do it that's it if God
[1:33:28] told me to take my son to the mountain
[1:33:30] could I do it that's if God told me to
[1:33:34] go many years ago over somewhere in the
[1:33:38] Indochina area I can't remember that
[1:33:41] this man was a
[1:33:42] missionary and there was a lepr colony a
[1:33:46] few miles just a half a dozen miles off
[1:33:48] the shore of this island and been turned
[1:33:50] into a lepre
[1:33:51] colony inhabited by thousand thousand of
[1:33:54] lepers and they believed that it was an
[1:33:56] evil spirits the reason these people had
[1:33:59] leprosy and God spoke to this man who
[1:34:01] wasn't a
[1:34:03] doctor he said I want you to move to
[1:34:05] that island and I want you to go and
[1:34:08] pray for those
[1:34:10] people he said his mind first went to
[1:34:12] the fact they're lepers and it's
[1:34:17] [Music]
[1:34:21] contagious but God urged him
[1:34:25] when he first went to the island the
[1:34:27] boat wouldn't even touch the shore they
[1:34:31] made him jump off the boat in chest deep
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:37] water and the people there do you
[1:34:39] realize you coming here is one against
[1:34:42] the current laws but two you'll end up
[1:34:46] with
[1:34:47] Leprosy and he said but God told me to
[1:34:49] come
[1:34:51] here imagine come come on folks let's
[1:34:54] deal with
[1:34:56] this you can be a Christian and a leper
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:01] also and he found a few Christians on
[1:35:04] the island when he told them God told me
[1:35:05] to come here and pray for you
[1:35:08] people there's a few amongst them said
[1:35:10] we could use the
[1:35:12] prayers God didn't send him idly there
[1:35:14] he started holding these meetings and
[1:35:17] talking about faith in God and praying
[1:35:20] for
[1:35:21] people and people who's fingers eaten
[1:35:25] have you ever seen a leper I've met a
[1:35:27] leper he was healed modern medicine in
[1:35:30] his case but it ate all of his fingers
[1:35:33] off to the joints he had little
[1:35:36] stubs he was praying for people and they
[1:35:39] would go to bed with Leprosy and wake up
[1:35:41] with healthy hands and
[1:35:44] feet and when one was
[1:35:47] delivered another had Faith to
[1:35:49] believe could we be the one that's right
[1:35:52] Lord let us must be the one that
[1:35:55] believes let
[1:35:57] belief be
[1:36:00] contagious did you know the spirit of
[1:36:03] Leia makes people lukewarm and
[1:36:08] cold and God placed you right here in
[1:36:11] leoda for you to believe and it to be
[1:36:14] known publicly that's right did did we
[1:36:16] catch the word
[1:36:19] publicly that there are believers in the
[1:36:22] land
[1:36:23] come on Amen finally the government come
[1:36:26] and arrested him and took him off the
[1:36:27] island because they didn't want their
[1:36:30] leper colony to go
[1:36:32] away those Appropriations from the
[1:36:35] government to keep this alive and these
[1:36:37] people got their appropriation also if
[1:36:40] there's no lepers there's no
[1:36:43] funds they wanted the leprosy but you
[1:36:45] see the thing was there marked as a
[1:36:49] leper they considered you always a
[1:36:51] leper and those that had been
[1:36:54] healed
[1:36:55] continued doesn't that sound like the
[1:36:57] Old Testament
[1:36:59] Church one brother Brown talks about how
[1:37:03] Billy Graham said I I go there we have
[1:37:06] all these people saved we come back in a
[1:37:07] year and there's hardly
[1:37:09] any but the Old Testament was one would
[1:37:12] go and come back and there's a body of
[1:37:14] Believers let us be the one Amen Let us
[1:37:19] with real leadership live the gospel
[1:37:23] Hallelujah I wasn't too blunt or
[1:37:25] anything today are we okay okay when we
[1:37:29] walk with the
[1:37:32] Lord in the light of his
[1:37:37] word what a
[1:37:40] glory he sheds on our
[1:37:47] way while we do his good
[1:37:51] will he abides with us
[1:37:56] still and with all who will trust and
[1:38:05] oy oh trust and
[1:38:09] oy for there's no other
[1:38:14] way to be happy in
[1:38:20] Jesus but to trust and
[1:38:27] oy not a
[1:38:29] shadow can
[1:38:32] rise not a cloud in the
[1:38:36] skies but his smile quickly drives it
[1:38:45] away there's not a doubt or a
[1:38:51] fear not a sign and nor a
[1:38:55] tear can abide while we trust and
[1:39:05] oy oh trust and
[1:39:09] oy for there's no other way to be happy
[1:39:18] in
[1:39:20] Jesus but to trust and and
[1:39:25] oy there's not a
[1:39:28] burden we
